00:00:05.290 - 00:00:32.034, Speaker A: Okay, let's. Let's get this show on the roll. Let's do this thing. Voter maybe as well if you're not using headphones. Cool. Someone was about to say something before, just before we get started. All right, guess you forgot.
00:00:32.034 - 00:01:01.850, Speaker A: It'll come back to you. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. This is another community call of the Niftify community. We've got some exciting stuff that we're going to be sharing with you today. I'm strawberry Sith, your resident. And yeah, yeah, lots of really exciting things going on. The NFT industry as a whole has been exploding and likewise has been the loan volume on Niftify.
00:01:01.850 - 00:01:32.650, Speaker A: We are at the singularity, the convergence. Really, there's no better place to be right now and in general, and specifically no better place to be than this specific call. So let's get us warmed up and see what's on the agenda for today. How about, Stephen, do you want to fill us in a little bit on what's been going on with product and some other points of discussion?
00:01:33.630 - 00:01:38.540, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Can you guys, everyone hear me?
00:01:38.990 - 00:01:40.714, Speaker A: Yes. All good.
00:01:40.752 - 00:02:12.930, Speaker B: All right, cool. So I just want to say thanks for everyone coming. This is probably one of the best turnouts early on, so clearly the word is spreading that it's worth coming to these. So hopefully we'll keep the level up for everyone. So I'm going to talk about two things quickly. So just a little bit of news on funding and then I'll give a quick rundown of some of the product stuff that's coming. So we are about to announce that we closed another strategic funding round.
00:02:12.930 - 00:03:23.920, Speaker B: So that should come out in the next couple of weeks in the press and there'll be lots of details on exactly who and amounts and so on. But I just wanted to talk through kind of why we decided to raise what we're getting out of this and just kind of fill you guys in on that. So this round was way oversubscribed, so we could probably have raised twice as much as we did raise. But we were very careful about not raising too much from vcs because really we wanted to leave enough room for the community to have a significant stake in the future protocol. So we kind of capped how much we're raising in this round to leave room for community applications in future rounds. And really, this was a strategic raise that gives us a few things. First of all, it gives us enough capital to keep the current team going for a few years, even if there's a bear market, so we can keep building even if for a time, things kind of cool off as we see happen all the time in the crypto space.
00:03:23.920 - 00:04:19.600, Speaker B: Sometimes there's a lot of hype, sometimes there's a winter and nothing happens. So we really want to make sure that we can keep building even if there's a slowdown in the market in the medium term. Obviously, we believe that over the long run, NFDs are going to kind of become a major part of how we transact and live online. But there's always going to be downtimes in between. So we want to be sure that we can survive that. And then we'll use these funds to fund the progressive decentralization of the product. So over time, moving from most of the activity and kind of moving the protocol forward happening within the team to eventually moving that out into a more of a dow structure and having the community both initiate ideas and also potentially execute on them and actually control some of the funds and strategic decisions of the protocol over the long run.
00:04:19.600 - 00:05:13.838, Speaker B: And then obviously to do that, we'll need a token and these funds will be used to kind of make sure that we do that in a legally compliant way. That kind of has the best possible outcome from everyone. And also the other thing that we're getting from these investors is we've taken in investors from all jurisdictions really that are going to take off. So we've got investors in us, EU, Latin America, Asia, so we kind of have a global coverage there. But more importantly, what we really try to do is pick our investors not purely based on who could write the biggest check. Like I said, we had more people interested in investing than we had space to let in the round. So we picked people that have deep connections and experience in industries that are growth areas for the NFT.
00:05:13.838 - 00:06:58.088, Speaker B: So, for example, we've got investors who are big in the gaming and interactive entertainment fund, so own multiple music scene, so music and full connections. And then a bunch of NFT ogs who kind of really know the space, either building stuff in the space or have large collections of kind of high value assets. Watch the news for more details on that. We'll announce who the investors are and what the funding round is in the next kind of week or so, potentially too, just depending on some pr stuff that we're doing. We just want to make sure that the community is the first people to know about this. And then on the product side, we just completed the first audit for our V two contracts, and we just had a kickoff session earlier this week with a second audits firm that's going to re audit all of that work and then also audit some new stuff on an ongoing basis for us. So we should have two separate audits from two independent auditing firms verifying the next version of the protocol, and then have ongoing audits for every piece of solidity code that goes into the production in the future.
00:06:58.088 - 00:07:55.150, Speaker B: So this will be the first big change to the smart contracts that we have. Up to now, all of the changes you guys have been seeing have been like UX and DAP changes, but didn't touch the core lending contracts, and this is going to be a big rewrite of those. So we'll be much more modular, be easier for us to add new loan products, and there's a whole bunch of features that you guys have been asking for that will go live as part of this. But now this being such a big change where we're actually moving kind of the core smart contract functionality to a new version. Obviously, the risks are much higher for us than making a change on the front end and adding a new page or something. So we're going to be very careful and thorough in our testing. So we've got quite a long alpha and beta testing program that we'll start in the next couple of days.
00:07:55.150 - 00:09:10.550, Speaker B: And then once we then have that fully tested and we're happy that everything is up and running, there will be a transition period where all of the existing loans that are on the existing contract will still execute and still work through the front end, but all new loans that get initiated will get initiated on the new contract. So there will be a kind of transition period where the existing loans that are active on the platform kind of run their course. And while all the new loans are swapped over to the v two contract, as part of that, we will also have an API that should be going live that other people can use to integrate directly with our smart contracts. And this is really the main focus for the technical team. So there might be a little bit of a slowdown on some of the front end changes just because we're all hands on deck making sure that this core upgrade, which really puts us in a good position to build a very modular, upgradable protocol going forward. So this is a really big milestone for us. So really happy that we are almost there now with this.
00:09:10.550 - 00:09:13.530, Speaker B: And that's it from my side.
00:09:15.660 - 00:09:39.312, Speaker A: Sweet. Thanks a lot, man. Those are some really dope updates. I'm pretty excited about it. I'm sure that everybody else, especially whoever is doing some serious activity on the platform, is very excited as well. So that's what you guys heard a little bit on the product and the funding side. Now let's move to HR updates a little bit.
00:09:39.312 - 00:09:52.064, Speaker A: And we've got somebody very special joining us today, Jonathan. And I'm going to let him introduce himself because I think he will do more justice than I will. Jonathan, you with us?
00:09:52.262 - 00:09:56.724, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah. I'm not going to chill myself as hard as you've been chilling me here.
00:09:56.762 - 00:09:57.590, Speaker B: Do it.
00:09:58.840 - 00:10:08.920, Speaker C: Hey. Greetings, everyone. My name is Jonathan. It's great to meet you, all of you. It's my first, very first community call. I've joined Nifty Phi a couple of weeks ago. It's been a bit of a phase in.
00:10:08.920 - 00:11:06.952, Speaker C: So I've been in the space since 2017. I have a background. I had a pretty steep corporate career, which at some point I really couldn't do anymore after I learned how exciting the web three space is and all the paradigm shifts that it has already been causing and will be causing going forward, as, for example, in the NFT space and in monetizing creativity and a lot of other things. So I basically quit my corporate career and did a lot of things in the web three space before joining Nifty five, for example, working for block science, which is the leading token engineering company. So that's a little bit, I think, what I bring to the team. I worked for blockscience for a while, so, blockscience, they engineer crypto economic systems, mechanism design, basically all the complex issues you face when you build crypto economic systems, that's what block science does. At some point, I realized I have a bit of an own opinion how that area should develop.
00:11:06.952 - 00:12:02.924, Speaker C: So I founded my own company called CAD Labs, which is by now also a leading token engineering company in this space. And then after I met Steven about 18 months ago, while we were kite surfing together, I realized how exciting the project that Steven is building is, actually, and what it can become. So I became an early investor and an advisor to Nifty Phi about 18 months ago and stayed very close. And at some point I realized this is really the most exciting thing that I can think of in this space. And then I got more and more involved and really realized this space that we're building in is the cutting edge of the cutting edge, in a sense. If you see the NFT space as sort of a sub vertical of web three, I think it's the perfect time to be building in this space you might have seen on crypto, Twitter. The whole NFT D five space is just getting started, really.
00:12:02.924 - 00:12:28.470, Speaker C: Although we've been up and running for about a year now. So I think really it's the right time. I also think it's the right team. Right. So, Stephen, for those of you who've been around for a while, is just really building a dream team that can execute very efficiently and effectively. So I was very drawn towards joining such an excellent team and I also could pivot basically the entire Cadlabs team into Nifty. So we have a lot of horsepower now to build new products.
00:12:28.470 - 00:12:58.844, Speaker C: I'm also going to be supporting the token model. So we have quite a couple of exciting things over the next few weeks coming. And so, yeah, so that's what I hope to bring to the team. Community management is also something that I'll be supporting. I've spoken to some of you already. I'm super excited to get to know more of you, learn what you want from the project, also like how we do community management. I'm really looking forward to also your input.
00:12:58.844 - 00:13:24.730, Speaker C: Reach out anytime if you have any suggestions. We really want to build a strong project in this entity that's currently in Niftify and then progressively decentralize and get all of you guys involved in that process. I cut it here. I feel I'm taking too much time otherwise, but happy to answer any questions and very excited to be part of this team.
00:13:27.900 - 00:13:47.464, Speaker A: Thanks a lot, Jonathan. Of course. Welcome, guys. Let's all check if Jonathan has learned how the NFT space works with Bam and if he's turned off his direct messages. I want everybody who's listening in to just send loads of hug emojis and direct messages. Nothing else, no explanation, just hug emojis. All the hug emojis to Jonathan.
00:13:47.464 - 00:14:19.240, Speaker A: But seriously though, thanks a lot and great intro. Great to hear your experience and it's just going to continue boosting us. That's going to be fantastic. So one of the things that I know you guys are voracious for during these calls is stats, right? About our progress, about the loan volume, about activity. And since I tend to get that wrong when I post about it in the general channel, let's hear it from somebody who knows the legit information and the numbers. Our Coo SJ.
00:14:20.380 - 00:14:26.780, Speaker D: Hi everyone. I'm going to share my screen. Let's hope it works this time. We did test it earlier.
00:14:28.080 - 00:14:28.830, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:29.520 - 00:14:30.588, Speaker D: Can we see it?
00:14:30.674 - 00:14:33.900, Speaker A: Oh yeah. Love it when things work on the first try.
00:14:33.970 - 00:15:10.280, Speaker D: Oh, me too. Thanks Elad and welcome everyone. It's so great to see so many of you here. October is turning out to be another phenomenal month. I do an investor update every month to all of our investors and every month I seem to feel like a bit of a stuck record and tell them another great month, another great month, another record broken. And I think I'm going to be saying it again this month. So I don't know if you all remember last month we hit $10 million in loans collectively from the start it was around the middle of September.
00:15:10.280 - 00:15:45.524, Speaker D: Well, as you can see, it looks like we may hit 20 million in loans for this month. So within the last six weeks we've done another 10 million in loans. Pretty much. We've got 600,000 to go before the end of August. So please go do some lending and borrowing. Total loans to date is 1874, which this month alone we've done 350 od completed loans. So that's either loans that have been paid back or defaulted on.
00:15:45.524 - 00:16:26.832, Speaker D: So out of the 1000, 801,400 of those are completed and the value of the completed loans is 12 million. So that means we've basically got around 7 million outstanding loans at the moment. Our unique lenders. So since the beginning of time we've had 302 different unique lenders who have lent on our platform and we've had 425 unique borrowers and that shot up significantly this month. Actually we've had over 100 new borrowers this month. As you can see, it just seems to go from strength to strength each month. So far this month we're on 5.9
00:16:26.832 - 00:16:57.032, Speaker D: million. And as I say, if we get another 600,000 we'll be hitting the 20 million mark this month. Our average loan size. Last month we hit a record of average loan size being 21,000 per loan. This month we're sitting on 16 or just under 17,000. And collectively, like from the beginning of time we are on average of just over 10,000 per loan. So this is our loan count.
00:16:57.032 - 00:17:13.730, Speaker D: As you can see, it's another record month, this month of 351. And this is just a bit of an illustration of the various differences between whether we're getting loans in eth or die. I see there's a chat. Is that a question?
00:17:16.100 - 00:17:17.648, Speaker A: It could wait for after.
00:17:17.734 - 00:17:23.380, Speaker D: Okay, so this is just showing the difference between the two currencies.
00:17:24.360 - 00:17:36.950, Speaker A: SJ, sorry to kind of interject. Can you just explain what you're showing and what you're seeing on the screen? Because I imagine that some people are possibly tuning in from their phones and stuff and they're not able to look for you.
00:17:37.560 - 00:17:41.480, Speaker D: Sure. Do you want me to go back a bit or shall I just go from here?
00:17:41.550 - 00:17:43.800, Speaker A: You can just take it away from where you left off.
00:17:43.870 - 00:17:44.056, Speaker D: Just.
00:17:44.078 - 00:17:46.268, Speaker A: If you can explain the visual, that would be great.
00:17:46.434 - 00:18:22.384, Speaker D: This is just a graph showing the difference in loan volume. So this month, for example, we're just under 1400 in ETH loans and just over $700,000 in DAi. And our highest in DAI was just over 700. And this is our highest month so far in east loans. Next slide. So this is just showing the difference between our unique lenders and borrowers. As you can see, this month we pretty much almost on 125 unique borrowers and lenders.
00:18:22.384 - 00:18:52.576, Speaker D: We just under 75. Our highest month was just over 75 in March for unique lenders. I see. There was one question, sorry if this has really been answered, but is there data on default rate of loans? So, yes, there is. I can give you some information on that. So, on loan numbers. So out of the 1874 loans, the default rate on the loan count is 18%.
00:18:52.576 - 00:19:04.500, Speaker D: But if I were to take it over the loan volume, so out of the 19 million or out of the 12 million that's being completed, should I say 8% of that was defaulted?
00:19:06.360 - 00:19:08.132, Speaker A: That's quite interesting, right?
00:19:08.186 - 00:19:22.090, Speaker B: Yeah. So I'll just jump in there. Also, what that implies is higher value loans are less likely to get a default. So we're seeing of the defaults that happen, they tend to skew towards lower value.
00:19:25.340 - 00:19:27.608, Speaker A: And. Yeah, go ahead, Stephen.
00:19:27.784 - 00:19:46.880, Speaker B: I was just going to say we also see a much higher default rate on Ethereum loans than Dai loans. And I think that's mostly explained by the fact that DAI is stable in Ethereum moves. So there's more scenarios where it would make sense to not pay back a loan. If you're taking out a loan in.
00:19:46.950 - 00:20:11.048, Speaker A: Ether, probably the same conclusion can be reached also about the higher value collateral. Right. For the same reason that it's just worth it to pay it back. And I imagine that there's also some semblance of, let's call it lender borrower responsibility. Right. When you're dealing with higher value collateral and higher value, therefore relationships. Right.
00:20:11.048 - 00:20:11.672, Speaker A: In the end.
00:20:11.726 - 00:20:30.270, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. I also think you're just going to see more. It's more likely to see like 50% volatility on something that's worth one ether than something that's worth 100 ether. Right. It's just way more. Just as the numbers go higher, the volatility kind of goes down a little bit.
00:20:30.640 - 00:20:33.744, Speaker A: Got you, SJ. Back to you.
00:20:33.942 - 00:20:46.832, Speaker D: That's all from me, actually. Are there any other questions at all on the stats? I see there's some that I don't think that is stats related I'll leave that one to you, Elad.
00:20:46.976 - 00:20:54.612, Speaker A: Any questions, guys, on numbers, statistics? If we don't have it on hand now, I'm sure SJ will be happy to get it for you.
00:20:54.666 - 00:20:55.024, Speaker B: SJ.
00:20:55.072 - 00:21:02.280, Speaker A: Maybe in general, we can just get for the next call, some more info on aprs and stuff. Would you happen to have it out on hand?
00:21:02.350 - 00:21:05.464, Speaker D: Yes, of course. I've actually got those. I can share them quick.
00:21:05.582 - 00:21:06.004, Speaker A: Sweet.
00:21:06.052 - 00:21:35.940, Speaker D: Let's hear some. Yeah, they're quite interesting, and they vary quite a lot. I don't know how best to explain. So, the shorter the loan, the higher the APR. So this month we've had 49 loans, which are only seven days long. And the average APR for that is 225%, where the 90 day loans, we've had 24 of those. And the average APR for that is 38%.
00:21:35.940 - 00:21:47.240, Speaker D: So this month's average APR is 98%, but it is a little bit skewed by the seven day loans overall. I can give you.
00:21:47.310 - 00:21:50.170, Speaker A: Do you happen to have it segmented by project?
00:21:51.820 - 00:21:54.410, Speaker D: I do. I think. One sec.
00:21:54.860 - 00:21:57.832, Speaker A: If not, we could just publish that for people later.
00:21:57.886 - 00:22:00.908, Speaker D: But I think it's just name one. Name one you want to know.
00:22:00.994 - 00:22:05.660, Speaker A: I think let's do some of the big ones. I'm just very curious. So, for example, first of all.
00:22:05.810 - 00:22:06.172, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:22:06.226 - 00:22:07.656, Speaker A: Hit us with some art blocks.
00:22:07.768 - 00:22:24.404, Speaker D: Art blocks average APR 74% yacht club is 54% crypto punk 34% autoglyph 32%. V friends is almost. Let me just check some games, right?
00:22:24.442 - 00:22:24.692, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:22:24.746 - 00:22:50.670, Speaker D: 98% me bit 36 hash marks 88% so they're all getting pretty high. Average APRs and art blocks is one of our highest contenders. We've had 501 loans from them to date, of which it's made up of $6 million.
00:22:52.400 - 00:23:24.248, Speaker A: Very interesting. Maybe we can. Yeah. Let's consider perhaps, just for the community to publish such info more routinely. I think because I tend to get asked for it specifically from various people in the community. They tend to ask about the projects that they're personally interested in, whether they're executing loans with that project or not. But they're just very curious about stuff in general, and maybe we'll be able to kind of make that info available on the website in general or something in the future.
00:23:24.248 - 00:23:25.160, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:23:25.310 - 00:23:34.120, Speaker D: Yeah, I think we are working on that. Sorry. Someone's amusing. Do you mind putting yourself on mute?
00:23:38.880 - 00:23:41.710, Speaker A: Amazing shop, please.
00:23:43.920 - 00:23:55.136, Speaker D: I think we are working on having some stats on the website for everyone, but I will absolutely update everyone on the general channel. So I'll send some stats each week on there.
00:23:55.318 - 00:23:58.076, Speaker A: Wonderful. That's perfect. Thanks a lot, SJ.
00:23:58.188 - 00:23:59.890, Speaker D: No problems. Cheers, everyone.
00:24:01.540 - 00:24:43.584, Speaker A: All righty. So that was really fascinating. And guys, I'm seeing all of your questions that are coming in, in the chat. They're all fantastic. We're just going to leave them to the end for the question and answer session, if that's okay with all of you, unless it's really specific to what we're talking about at any given moment, and then we'll try to hit in real time. So at this point, I want to remind everybody that we've been trying to get a little more creative with how we're directly engaging communities from other projects and trying to cooperate with them at the grassroots and almost like a public diplomacy kind of level. And the first project that we're trying to do that with is cryptodes, actually, we're really trying to engage their community.
00:24:43.584 - 00:25:23.820, Speaker A: We put together a really cool promotional competition having to do with lending specifically on that asset class. And yeah, it's been really interesting to see how that's developing. If you guys have crypto, it's definitely enter right for a chance to win one of five different meta keys. And also, if you guys know other people from the crypto community, pass the word around. It's only going to help bring more people into the niftify community, which makes everything here better for everyone. So just a reminder on that, you've got all of that info and more under the swamp party category. That's right underneath the community call category.
00:25:23.820 - 00:25:33.680, Speaker A: With that said, I'm going to bring in Annie, our CMO, who's going to tell us about a little surprise campaign that Nifty has been planning. Annie.
00:25:34.260 - 00:26:25.292, Speaker E: Yeah. Hey, everyone. Really happy to see all of you here. Yeah. So we just thought that unfortunately, since we're not as lucky as strawberry to be in New York and to participate in the event because of different travel restrictions, some of you may be lucky enough to be able to make it. So we have one vip ticket to NFT New York, which we are going to give away through a pretty standard Twitter sort of competition because that would help us spread the world and also boost a little bit our Twitter channel for visibility. So I'm going to tweet out the competition details.
00:26:25.292 - 00:27:03.356, Speaker E: The only limitation is, obviously, we want that person who wins to be there and to meet Strawberry as well, and also take advantage of all the amazing things that the vip ticket gives us access to. So basically, the person needs to be either from New York or be attending the event. So it would be a big upgrade for them if it was just a regular ticket. So stay tuned. We'll just tweet it out in few minutes and yeah, spread to the world. Let's see who's going to be there. And we would love to get your experiences afterward about it.
00:27:03.356 - 00:27:26.390, Speaker E: So, yeah, that's what we've got for you. We'll have some more of these kind of things coming soon, but I think this is the really big event that is worth going to and we're really bumped that we can't do it. So the second good thing that could happen is if we can't make it, let someone from the community be able to go.
00:27:27.080 - 00:27:42.010, Speaker B: Yeah, I just want to jump in there saying that I was supposed to go, so you guys are getting my tickets and just because of COVID I wasn't allowed to enter the US. So just thought we'd pass the ticket on to somebody who can make use of it.
00:27:45.680 - 00:28:14.760, Speaker A: Awesome. Vip nifty NYC ticket. Totally worth it, guys. It gets you into the vip dinner, I think, which is at the Edison hotel. And yeah, you'll rub shoulders with all of the head honchos of all the huge NFT projects in the space. And it's just incredible for networking. Whether you want to do it for business or just your own personal sake, the people at that vip dinner are not bad friends to have to put it lightly.
00:28:14.760 - 00:28:55.716, Speaker A: So we'll push out the details on how you guys can have a chance for that ticket a little later. So with that being said, I think that's most of the official stuff that we had planned for you guys. And that's going to bring us to our questions and answer session, which will start now. I'm going to scroll up and see what questions you submitted so far. I do want to say that this is, I think, the most people we've had consecutively on a community call to this point. And to be honest, I don't want that to go to waste. So I want to really open the floor to some of you guys.
00:28:55.716 - 00:29:57.764, Speaker A: Let's talk about all of the stuff that we've been waiting a month to talk about since the last community call. Whoever is less shy, please feel free to unmute yourselves at any given point and holler at us with a question or comment or suggestion that you might have and everybody else, we totally understand. Just continue dropping your questions in the chat and we'll read them out for everybody. So let's start maybe. I think Journey Ape had one of the first questions regarding the whitelisting process, which is something that I personally wanted to talk about with everyone. I'm just going to repost journey's comment right here. And basically, so this asks regarding the whitelisting process specifically and journey apes suggestion was I'm just going to read it out for you that maybe there could be automated and manual pathways that would perhaps also include filters.
00:29:57.764 - 00:30:22.370, Speaker A: So it says manual pathway to address unforeseen scenarios plus add community favorites quickly, an automated pathway with conditions. Okay, cool. Yeah, that's all interesting. And yeah, you guys can read the rest of it there. Journey ape, I don't know. Do you want to come on and unmute yourself and tell us a little bit more about your idea here?
00:30:23.300 - 00:30:28.050, Speaker B: You are particular to expect.
00:30:31.560 - 00:31:20.268, Speaker A: Okay, no problem. Yeah, sorry about that. Okay. In general, we're talking about the whitelisting and I understand that this has been a little bit of a source of frustration sometimes for everyone because things are happening and it comes in waves and we know that everyone wants every project that they're involved in to automatically be whitelisted without many questions asked. So first of all, one of the first things you should know is that originally whitelisting required a lot of manpower. Believe it or not, it was less of an automated process and therefore required a lot more effort and time to do. We've since pushed out an update that makes it much easier.
00:31:20.268 - 00:31:55.720, Speaker A: So we do have the ability to roll out whitelistings more easily now. And you've seen that we're doing that in terms of choosing which projects to whitelist specifically. It's not an exact science because on one hand we want to give as much opportunity to open up our p to p marketplace to as many projects as possible. But we also want it to be quality projects. And I'll just say for a moment what I mean by that. Right. So at niftify, the whole idea here is to help lenders, the right lenders find the right borrowers with the right assets.
00:31:55.720 - 00:32:49.148, Speaker A: It has to be that kind of like triumvirate of a match in order for loans to execute. Otherwise all of our activity just becomes a giant marketing board for people just listing and unlisting and relisting all of their nfts. Some people have a great many number of nfts and that floods the feed for people that might be looking for specific collateral that they want to loan against. So journey apes suggestions will be taken into consideration and you guys have a link to what that looks like. But if anybody else has some suggestions or wants to say something about that, we'd also love to hear from you a little bit of feedback a little bit of creative thought. Feel free to drop that here or send it our way. But long story short on this subject, we will be improving the whitelisting process.
00:32:49.148 - 00:32:57.356, Speaker A: We'll make it easier. We'll make it better in all things considered. Any other questions or comments on whitelisting?
00:32:57.388 - 00:33:43.324, Speaker B: In the meantime, I also just want to make a point saying that when we say quality project, we're not commenting on the quality of the actual artwork. What we're talking about is the quality of the project as collateral. Right. So we're looking at things like what's the secondary market volume? So if somebody gets a default, can they then actually get rid of that NFC if they would like to? What's the floor price if most of the assets are worth less than 0.5 ether? Just practically. Given the gas costs involved, it's not really practical to do too many loans on those kinds of NFTs. So those are some of the considerations we do.
00:33:43.324 - 00:33:51.456, Speaker B: We don't sit and look, oh, we think this one's pretty, or we think this project's cool. We kind of look at some stats and then look at it from that point of view.
00:33:51.638 - 00:33:59.540, Speaker A: Quality for us means, right, for the niftify community, right. It just means will people use this properly as collateral? That's all.
00:33:59.610 - 00:34:24.190, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Like a great example of that is kind of Ens domain. So I think that's a quality project. It's very legit. It's just not the greatest collateral. We've seen loads of them listed, but not really many offers or loans starting on them. So we just don't want the whole of the niftify site and activity fee to be swapped by listings for projects that nobody's actually going to make an offer on.
00:34:25.680 - 00:34:35.824, Speaker A: Right on. All right, let's see what else we've got here. Just scrolling up on the questions. Hello. Hi.
00:34:36.022 - 00:34:36.720, Speaker C: Hi.
00:34:36.870 - 00:34:54.040, Speaker F: Mr. Ranger here. I have a question regarding the loans. If I have an NFT, I think that maybe has been asked before, but when I take a loan and my NFT goes into the smart contract.
00:34:57.660 - 00:34:57.976, Speaker A: Now.
00:34:57.998 - 00:35:25.200, Speaker F: That there has been a lot of utility in nfts and airdrops and stuff like that, our nfts get stuck in the smart contract and the possible airdrops, hence are also stuck in the smart contract. Is there any way that NFTFI could change that? I don't know how difficult it is on the technical side. Is it even possible? Is it too much work? Is it not even conceivable?
00:35:27.220 - 00:36:09.624, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good question. Are we seeing a lot of people asking that. And that's been one of the kind of main focus areas of our research. So technically it's not trivial because there's four or five different way airdrops get done. So there isn't one solution that solves all of them. The other thing that happens is, especially if the airdrop just transfers the NFT to the owner of the NFT, that qualifies it for the airdrop. There's no way easily to know who was like, say we've got five crypto punks or something in the smart contract.
00:36:09.624 - 00:36:42.584, Speaker B: We don't know which NFT went to which one of those. So that's another one of the issues that needs to be solved. We actually have a proof of concept that looks like it solves almost all of these issues. So we are busy fleshing that out and rolling it out. But that would require, that can only go live as part of the v two stuff. Probably not before December, but it's definitely something we're working on. It isn't very trivial, it is quite complicated, actually.
00:36:42.584 - 00:37:24.520, Speaker B: But I think we've got a solution. So it's just a matter of time to make sure, test all of the different scenarios. Part of what we have to do to enable that could potentially just makes security more of a concern with that specific contract, because now all of a sudden, we're allowing people to drain assets out of escrow that weren't specifically put into escrow by them. So we really need to make sure that we double check everything and make sure it's fully audited and all scenarios have been tested properly. But long story short, I think we've got a solution to it. It's just going to be a little bit of time to make sure that it's up to speed and make sure that it's secure.
00:37:25.740 - 00:37:28.504, Speaker F: Perfect. Good news. Thank you very much.
00:37:28.702 - 00:37:29.480, Speaker B: Pleasure.
00:37:30.060 - 00:37:45.308, Speaker A: Thanks for your question, ma'am. Here's another question we got from amazing shops. Any word on when you might reposition the app off of eth to maybe flow or another alternative? Why position off of when you can have both? Stephen, do you have any updates for us on that regard?
00:37:45.394 - 00:38:41.170, Speaker B: Yes, we will have both. So you should see announcement coming from us and the dapper Labs team in the next little while. I just looked at a demo of our UI connecting to the flow blockchain the other day, so this is definitely coming. It is lower priority than getting the next version of the smart contracts out, but we have a separate team working on it, so it should still make good progress. But if there's like a trade off between getting v two of the protocol up and getting flow running. It's probably going to be v two of the protocol, but very shortly after that, you should be seeing live flow assets that you can actually do a loan, fully non custodial, using either flow or FUSD, which is flow stablecoin. So that's coming very soon.
00:38:41.700 - 00:38:55.596, Speaker A: Nice. Do any of you guys listening in today know what the most expensive NFT ever sold on the flow blockchain was? Anybody know?
00:38:55.778 - 00:38:56.604, Speaker B: No.
00:38:56.802 - 00:39:28.020, Speaker A: I have one month of discord nitro membership or the first person to figure it out and to drop it here in this discord channel. Think about that while we're going through the rest of the questions. The most expensive NFT ever sold on flow blockchain. Look it up and drop it here. Next question. Have you thought about developing. This one's from Flywheel, an ISO ISO contract division that can be used to infiltrate discord groups and be able to offer help to more that may need it.
00:39:28.020 - 00:39:32.392, Speaker A: Flywheel, can we get a little bit more elaboration on what you mean here?
00:39:32.526 - 00:39:36.184, Speaker G: Yeah, absolutely. Can you hear me?
00:39:36.302 - 00:39:38.730, Speaker A: Yes. Shoot, you're live.
00:39:39.100 - 00:41:29.532, Speaker G: Nice. I think for right now, this would probably fall underneath specialty finance. So similarly to merchant cash advances or litigation finance, or any other type of unique Pfizer vaccine, ability to lend on future receivable, or just speculation on an increase in price for the asset in and of itself. But what I mean is traditionally with both of those specific industries, but especially finance as a whole, you typically have an ISO. So it's an independent representative who can make a couple of bips or a couple smaller percentage points by working together to connect both funders and the. And I think that what's so unique within the NFT community is having these larger, there's a clear distinction between the larger blue chip projects and ones that are more speculative. And I think there are a lot of people within those larger blue chips that if it made sense to relay the information to fellow community members and if it was incentivized, they would do so.
00:41:29.532 - 00:41:48.156, Speaker G: I think some might look down on it a little bit because it might be seen as like, oh, well, you're not that certain. Or, hey, he doesn't have diamond hands, whatever, as opposed to being a smart financial move. So does that give a little bit more context?
00:41:48.348 - 00:42:32.876, Speaker B: Yes, it does. So maybe Jonathan wants to jump in here too a little bit. So there's one feature coming as part of e two that would help with this. So borrowers can indicate in the new version that they're willing to pay a finder's fee for someone to facilitate the loan for them. So, like a referral fee similar to what you get an open fee. So that's one kind of just general, just kind of at the protocol level integration for that. And then over the longer run, I think we do want to kind of have a community led group of people like that, that kind of work for the DAo that help to facilitate these kinds of loans.
00:42:32.876 - 00:42:37.280, Speaker B: I don't know if you want to say a couple of words about that, Jonathan. I know I'm putting you on the spot.
00:42:38.500 - 00:42:51.450, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm going to divert that and say, let's make this a deep dive next in the next community call, because that's indeed, like, something that we're currently structuring in a small group of people. But I think it makes more sense to make it a deep dive in the next call.
00:42:55.900 - 00:42:57.880, Speaker B: Does that answer your question, flywheel?
00:42:59.260 - 00:43:23.890, Speaker G: Yeah, for the most part. Just one thing I wanted to point out was you had said for the borrower to pay a finder's fee, is there any way to include. Will there also be a way to include a lender having the ability to divert some of the interest that gets paid on the back end to the person who's able to find that?
00:43:24.660 - 00:43:27.330, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a separate mechanism to that, but.
00:43:29.220 - 00:43:30.016, Speaker G: Sure.
00:43:30.198 - 00:43:48.472, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a separate mechanism for that, but I will just kind of look through that again and just make sure I understand what you're trying to achieve there. I just want to double check that that's true. But maybe we can talk through that, like Jonathan suggested, in the next community call, and we'll have some more concrete ideas on that for. Awesome, awesome.
00:43:48.526 - 00:43:55.244, Speaker G: Thank you so much for taking the time to answer my question and really, really big fan here. Very exciting stuff.
00:43:55.442 - 00:43:58.990, Speaker B: Thank you very much. Thanks for the kind words. Really appreciate it.
00:43:59.760 - 00:44:31.220, Speaker A: Love it. Thanks a lot. Flywheel. Dannyson, can you mute yourself, please? Appreciate it. Our next question is from JD Blacklong. I wonder if there's been any analysis to see if there's a correlation between defaulted loans and assets that significantly depreciated, for example, people dumping the nifties and keeping the loaned tokens, the loaned crypto, SJ, maybe? Do we have any business intelligence that we've processed on that specifically?
00:44:31.880 - 00:44:41.050, Speaker D: No, not specifically, but it is something I can have a look into. So give me some time, and I will get back to you on that one in the next couple of days.
00:44:41.420 - 00:44:47.950, Speaker A: Sure. I have a feeling. Yeah, shoot. Steven, I think we were probably about to say the same thing.
00:44:48.400 - 00:45:23.770, Speaker B: I think anecdotally there's a lot of evidence that that happens. The other time that that happens is actually if ethereum price appreciates much faster than the NFT. So it could be the NFT like dropping, or it could be that you could took out a two ether loan when there was ether, went from like three hundred dollars to two thousand dollars in a short period earlier this year. And then we saw like a big bump in the default rate for Ethereum based loans then because the NFT prices just didn't keep up in dollar terms with the appreciation in Ethereum price.
00:45:26.940 - 00:46:05.172, Speaker A: Right. So yeah, I feel like it's just basic lending mechanics and stuff. That kind of thing is going to happen regardless of whether the collateral is an NFT or not. But yeah, we'll get some more specific information on that as it pertains to the activity on our specific platform. Next we've got Daedaiwoom eth. What's the process after filling the whitelisting form for a collection? Is there a mail notification to know if and when it will be added? I filled it for the luchador's collection a few days ago. Okay, so this is what we were talking about previously a little bit.
00:46:05.172 - 00:46:58.100, Speaker A: Right now it's a very mostly manual process. When you guys fill out the Google form, first of all, it checks to see if the project that you're submitting was already submitted or not. And it does that by cross referencing the smart contract address that you put in the form. So the reason that that filter exists is just because I imagine there are multiple people who want the same project whitelisted and they don't have the time to go back and see if somebody actually submitted it or not. So it's just to avoid multiples. If it was submitted already, then your submission just won't show up because it should already be in there. Now, in terms of what we do after that, we do tend to whitelist once a week.
00:46:58.100 - 00:48:07.740, Speaker A: Basically, we view all of the projects that were submitted and that are in the queue and we'll look at their stats as Stephen and SJ were talking about earlier, and we'll see what's more of a fit. We'll tend to whitelist like five or six projects at a time unless there's something extremely significant. And yeah, that's currently the process. I do like this discourse that we had earlier today about automating more of that so that it could check like specific stats or something like that and maybe prioritize ones that do match certain objective and dry criteria. I imagine that that's the direction we'll take it in so that we can just support scalability a little bit more. But right now it's mostly up to discretion, which is also why we have the voting process, because sometimes there's a project that we might consider not to be top priority, but if 60 people have upvoted it, we'll be like, wow, that's a really engaged community and it might be worth whitelisting. Anyway, I hope that answers your question.
00:48:07.740 - 00:49:01.250, Speaker A: Dai dymo, does anyone else have any more questions for us? Take a second to think about it. While you're doing that, I'm just going to say that I do have to go back and actually check what the most expensive NFT sold on flow blockchain has been. So please don't delete your submissions. But I'll do that at some time after the call and I will ping publicly whoever got the right answer first. And I'll also post a link to an article or to stats or something corroborating it so that you can all check it out. Danny sun has a question. Hit us.
00:49:01.250 - 00:50:22.072, Speaker A: I'll play some elevator music for you while you're doing that. Okay, so Danny sun is asking about the safety issue, the one I asked in general. Okay, so if I remember correctly, and Danny sun, do correct me if I'm wrong here, but from what I remember in the, yeah, I got you. From what I remember that Danny sun brought up in the general chat, basically they're asking about how safe is the niftify smart contract. Right? Like they were asking because they like our platform and they want to use it more, especially with the high value assets. They're asking, has anything ever gone wrong with the smart contract? Have people complained about it? Did things magically get lost in there? And the answer is, of course, a resounding no. But I think I'll invite Stephen if you want to give a few more words about that and why it's not possible for things to magically disappear from the smart contract and why we also ourselves cannot forcefully disappear things from the smart contract.
00:50:22.072 - 00:50:23.724, Speaker A: Do you want to add a few words on that?
00:50:23.842 - 00:51:07.076, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So basically, the way the smart contract was written is that the only way to get an asset out of escrow is to either repay or to default on the actual loan. These assets get transferred and the smart contract becomes the owner. Once the smart contract is the owner, the only thing we can do with those assets is whatever is written into the smart contract. So the smart contract is not upgradable. It's not that it goes into like a wallet where we've got the private keys for. It's basically in this actual smart contract.
00:51:07.076 - 00:51:38.150, Speaker B: And then the code of the actual smart contract enforces that it's only the borrower, the lender who can foreclose or repay the loan. And the place that you're asking and the place they were held, where they are held in the meantime, cannot be hacked. So it's a smart contract. So you can never say that it's 100% sure that it's not hackable. But we had it checked by a number of people in the community. The source code has been available. A number of people in the nifty community have checked the source code.
00:51:38.150 - 00:52:20.332, Speaker B: We've also now done, what, 1800 loans and almost $20 million worth of loans. And we haven't had a single exploit. So we're pretty sure that this version of the contract is safe. The next version of the contract, obviously, is going to be have at least two sets of auditors that went through it. But one thing to just remember, even if you're using something besides niftify, just because an audit was done doesn't mean it's 100% safe. It just means that somebody has specifically gone and looked for issues and they couldn't find any. But there's been multiple hacks of smart contracts that have been audited.
00:52:20.332 - 00:52:50.170, Speaker B: So really the best way to know if something is safe is to it has to be out in the market for a long time, have had processed a number of high value transactions, and has proven secure over the long run, which I think our contract has. It's been a year and a half now, a lot of loans, and we haven't a single exploit. And how's it from another south African? Good to see there's more. One of us in the NFT space.
00:52:52.380 - 00:53:37.610, Speaker A: Awesome. So, yeah, and I'll also add one more thing that I did mention in the general channel. I was like half kidding, but I said one of the ways that you can know that things are still legit here and that nothing went wrong is that people are still in this discord, right? Otherwise people would flee for the hills. But in all honesty, that's not far from the truth. If something would have gone wrong through crypto, Twitter, you 100% would have heard about it, right? Like people are looking out for each other in such a way that it just wouldn't be kept secret. But we're looking forward to taking the necessary additional steps to make things even safer, more secure. And to increase user confidence in the nifty platform.
00:53:37.610 - 00:53:49.870, Speaker A: Let's see if there are just any questions here that I still missed. Flywheel, did you have one more question?
00:53:51.840 - 00:53:57.372, Speaker G: I did, but I don't know kind of what everybody's schedule is and I don't want to take it for granted.
00:53:57.436 - 00:53:58.960, Speaker A: But we still got some time.
00:53:59.110 - 00:54:15.670, Speaker G: Sweet. I will take it for granted. Are there currently any team members that have experience in the specialty finance industries? And it said it'll be part one of the question.
00:54:19.320 - 00:54:31.070, Speaker B: Stephen? No, not anyone directly, but we are, like, talking to a number of community members and dows who do have experience in that space.
00:54:31.440 - 00:55:15.836, Speaker G: Okay, interesting. It's. I could rant. I have so much love and passion for specialty finance in general because of the unique problems that they solve, but the great demand in market that enable people to be very profitable from them too. And I don't know, do you guys have a dashboard or do you guys currently have something set up that tracks all these specific KPIs? And is that automated or does that just kind of look like a spreadsheet right now?
00:55:16.018 - 00:55:50.200, Speaker B: Yeah, it's internal. At the moment, we will make a much more fully featured public dashboard available, but like I said, all of our focus on the dev side is kind of working towards version two of the protocol, and then we should have a lot more capacity to do these kinds of things. I actually was thinking it might be good. You mind if we pin you sometime over the next couple of days? It would be cool to have a more in depth conversation with you, just about your experience. You clearly are quite knowledgeable about the space, so we'd love to have a more in depth conversation with you about it.
00:55:50.350 - 00:56:11.228, Speaker G: Absolutely. I would be privileged to be able to hear and answer any question to help you guys with what I mean, I love it. Web three for everything. Oh, my God.
00:56:11.394 - 00:56:27.270, Speaker B: A man out of rights according to our own heart. I think you're about as excited as we are about it. So, yeah, I'd love to kind of just spend some time talking to you and getting to know you a bit better and seeing how your insights could help us.
00:56:30.200 - 00:56:54.030, Speaker A: First of all, fly. Thanks again for everything. But I just got to say that just hearing things from the side and seeing everybody's questions and participation and just the number of people that we got in here today, I'm really feeling that energy. Right? It's like all coming together. It took a while to kind of get things into the flow, pun intended, but it's really happening, and I'm super psyched about all of.
00:56:56.400 - 00:57:26.390, Speaker B: To just quickly, 1 second. So what Jonathan was saying, like nfts are super new. Using them as collateral is even newer than that. So we're kind of like at the tip of the tip of the spear here, right? There's a whole bunch of new NfT users that don't even think that it's possible to do these kinds of things with these nfts, that they're, you know, we're, we're still very early, so we're all going to make it.
00:57:27.800 - 00:57:40.670, Speaker A: We gonna make it. I love it. Nothing better know. Pushing the envelope and being right on the edge, that's like the most exciting thing. Loving it. Okay, guys, last questions. Hit us with them now.
00:57:41.120 - 00:57:46.940, Speaker F: I have just one last question. Are there any plans for a token?
00:57:50.740 - 00:58:13.700, Speaker B: Yes, plans for a token. As soon as we have more kind of detailed information on exactly how it will be structured and how we want to get the community involved, we will share that. But that's kind know, Jonathan and I working very hard on that on a day to day basis.
00:58:14.840 - 00:58:16.470, Speaker F: All right, thank you very much.
00:58:17.000 - 00:59:18.090, Speaker C: To add not only Steven and I, but it's actually I think one of the top priorities at the moment. We have a small team across two streams, across mechanism, design, work stream, looking at some of also the new primitives that are emerging in the Defi ecosystem. We're kind of currently in a phase where we're looking at what are the best practices out there, what are the trends that emerging, what things have been working and have not been working. I think the ecosystem has been evolving a lot there over the last, it feels like an eternity, right, since Defi summer. And yeah, we will be sharing over the next, probably might say like over the next four to six weeks, I think we might be able to share some first ideas of how this is going to look like. But yeah, rest assured that's one of our top priorities and I think it's going to be quite exciting and looking forward to get all of your feedback once we're a step further there.
00:59:18.480 - 00:59:19.276, Speaker F: Absolutely.
00:59:19.458 - 00:59:20.844, Speaker B: Well, good luck to you all.
00:59:20.882 - 00:59:23.310, Speaker F: Big love and see you next time.
00:59:24.320 - 00:59:25.768, Speaker A: Thank you. Thanks a lot, Mr. Ray.
00:59:25.784 - 00:59:26.590, Speaker B: Thanks, guys.
00:59:30.160 - 01:00:25.570, Speaker A: Great. So I think we're going to wrap it up. I did see that there were a few questions here from late comers regarding the funding who missed a little bit of the alpha. And I am aware that there is a discourse here and a lot of demand for community participation. So Stephen, I don't know if you want to touch upon that, but I think that one way or another, right, the community is here and we're continuing to develop it and community will have a role or a way to participate in the niftify platform one way or another. But is there anything you want to add specifically on that or should? And would people just wait for the official announcements to roll out in order to understand everything?
01:00:26.100 - 01:01:33.670, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think we don't want to say things until we're sure about it. So we just don't want to make promises that we then later on figure out actually that wasn't the right thing to do and then we have to kind of go back and walk things back. But like I said in the beginning, we could have raised significantly more money. So we could have done that now and gotten basically enough money and not to need to have to raise again for the foreseeable future. But we didn't want to give all of, we wanted to keep a big chunk of the future protocol aside for community members because we think it's critical to have a community owned protocol to do these kinds of things. We limited how much money we took in from investors to make sure that we had enough money to execute on the plan, but enough of the token network left to be able to make sure that the community is sufficiently engaged and owns a large enough chunk of the protocol going forward. So that is really important to us.
01:01:39.510 - 01:02:05.430, Speaker A: Excellent. So we did put aside an hour for today's session. We're running a little bit over, but I think let's wrap it up here. The team is always available in discord in general. If you guys want to continue conceptualizing, ideating, suggesting stuff, that's what we're here for. Please continue to engage, continue to contribute. We love that kind of stuff.
01:02:05.430 - 01:02:31.566, Speaker A: And yeah, you've been terrific today, guys and gals. Thanks so much for participating and for sticking through the entire session. You guys got a little bit of alpha here today and we'll continue rewarding people with Alpha who come to the community calls. And yeah, who's going to win that discord nitro membership? We're going to see. I'm going to ping you all as soon as I have the official answer. That's it for today. Thanks everybody for coming.
01:02:31.566 - 01:02:36.480, Speaker A: And we'll see you next month for the next community call. Have a great day, everybody.
01:02:36.850 - 01:02:54.120, Speaker B: Thanks everyone. Looking forward to next time and say hi in the discord us. And if you got any ideas, just ping them to us. We're always open to suggestions. Bye, everyone.
01:02:54.730 - 01:02:55.330, Speaker A: Ciao. Ciao.
