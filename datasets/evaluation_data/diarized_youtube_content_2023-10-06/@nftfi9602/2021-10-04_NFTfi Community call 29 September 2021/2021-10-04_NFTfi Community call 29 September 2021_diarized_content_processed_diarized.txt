00:00:00.090 - 00:00:00.750, Speaker A: Daniel.
00:00:01.810 - 00:00:02.990, Speaker B: Hey, Daniel.
00:00:05.010 - 00:00:05.760, Speaker A: Hello.
00:00:10.050 - 00:00:10.800, Speaker C: Okay.
00:00:11.490 - 00:01:49.976, Speaker B: Hello. Hi, nice to meet you. Give me two minutes and I want to join. Sure, no problem. We're just waiting for some more people to join you.
00:01:49.998 - 00:01:52.320, Speaker C: Muted all right? Yeah, is muted.
00:02:24.290 - 00:02:27.502, Speaker D: Hey, I hear you. Good. How's it going?
00:02:27.636 - 00:02:29.280, Speaker C: Good, how are you?
00:02:31.410 - 00:02:34.130, Speaker D: I'm okay. A bit sick.
00:02:35.910 - 00:02:38.660, Speaker B: They can hear. You. Got something going down there?
00:02:39.350 - 00:02:40.500, Speaker D: Yeah, I do.
00:02:42.950 - 00:02:45.380, Speaker B: Well, thanks for joining anyway. I hope you feel better.
00:02:46.890 - 00:02:49.400, Speaker D: Thank you. Thank you.
00:02:54.250 - 00:02:59.538, Speaker C: We need some elevator music or something while we wait.
00:02:59.644 - 00:03:07.050, Speaker B: Was just telling us the story about how every discord bot that can plays music has been sniped out recently.
00:03:07.470 - 00:03:14.000, Speaker C: Oh, really? Is there some sort of fascist music? Rights global. Yes. There you go.
00:03:16.050 - 00:03:25.426, Speaker B: Exactly. So they've all been taken down. So all of these chats are all going to be more quiet than they've been in the past. Yeah.
00:03:25.528 - 00:03:29.220, Speaker C: God forbid we listen to music without paying.
00:03:30.790 - 00:03:43.600, Speaker B: Yeah. Is he going to give it a couple of minutes for people to join?
00:03:46.260 - 00:03:50.480, Speaker C: Did anyone pick up a meridian from the drop yesterday?
00:03:51.940 - 00:03:56.708, Speaker B: No, I missed out. They look awesome, though. They look like sand sculpture things almost.
00:03:56.794 - 00:04:11.210, Speaker C: Yeah. You should see the high value ones, man. They are amazing. They look like beautiful landscapes with mist and stuff. Actually, I'll post some into the chat. I got two.
00:04:12.540 - 00:04:13.290, Speaker B: Nice.
00:04:14.460 - 00:04:16.936, Speaker D: I absolutely love them. I got three.
00:04:17.038 - 00:04:18.030, Speaker C: You got three?
00:04:19.360 - 00:04:25.310, Speaker D: Yeah, I got three. And I almost never get art blocks drops, but this one is just amazing.
00:04:26.000 - 00:04:29.500, Speaker C: Yeah. Do you use Eden network?
00:04:33.760 - 00:04:41.432, Speaker D: I don't, and I didn't mint three. I minted one and then bought like two immediately off the openc.
00:04:41.496 - 00:04:55.330, Speaker C: Yeah, I minted one. I had one failure and then I bought another one straight off the secondary market, which was a great idea because I bought one for like 6.4 and then now the floor is like 12.5.
00:04:56.580 - 00:05:09.972, Speaker D: Yeah. Actually, it was interesting with the secondary market because nobody knew. I was literally like, people were asking in the discord chat how to buy. How to buy because it wasn't showing up in the playground.
00:05:10.116 - 00:05:13.080, Speaker C: Yeah. It was on that weird other contract.
00:05:14.940 - 00:05:28.520, Speaker D: Yeah, the sellers knew how to sell because they had the piece, but the Buyers, they didn't have the contract address and they couldn't buy. So I was like, okay, fuck it, I'm buying another one. This is not the unnatural.
00:05:28.600 - 00:05:30.990, Speaker C: Did you buy one without being able to see it?
00:05:32.320 - 00:05:32.924, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:05:33.042 - 00:05:55.670, Speaker C: You know how you can see is if you go into art blocks and then go onto the gallery and then click onto one that you like, and then from there you can click onto the openc link button. It'll still take you to the preview where you don't see it, but because you've clicked through it from the art blocks, then you would have seen it from the gallery point of view. And then that's how I spotted a few.
00:05:56.680 - 00:06:04.820, Speaker D: Yeah, I was trying to do that, but I was just on a lousy laptop and the art blocks, the gallery didn't load anything, so I just blind.
00:06:05.480 - 00:06:07.130, Speaker C: Well, did you get a nice one?
00:06:08.060 - 00:06:09.690, Speaker D: Yeah, it's pretty nice, actually.
00:06:12.080 - 00:06:13.868, Speaker B: Where are you guys posting this?
00:06:14.034 - 00:06:16.430, Speaker C: I'm going to post one now.
00:06:17.200 - 00:06:21.212, Speaker B: Posting a poll chat. Bumdy. Missed that one. It was really good.
00:06:21.346 - 00:06:33.490, Speaker C: They're beautiful. I think these are going to become super valuable. This one, unfortunately, is not mine, but this one sold for 30.
00:06:34.660 - 00:06:35.410, Speaker B: Wow.
00:06:40.190 - 00:06:42.634, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it's really quite nice.
00:06:42.752 - 00:06:47.180, Speaker B: That's really good. That's very nice.
00:06:47.710 - 00:06:49.900, Speaker C: I'm going to paste the one I got.
00:06:50.950 - 00:06:56.370, Speaker B: It's.
00:06:59.990 - 00:07:08.280, Speaker C: Just taking forever to render now. Wait a minute. I think I saved a picture of it.
00:07:17.850 - 00:07:19.980, Speaker B: There you go. Nice.
00:07:20.670 - 00:07:29.200, Speaker C: That's mine. Oh, that's very nice, Arad. That's my one.
00:07:30.290 - 00:07:32.442, Speaker E: Do they move? Are they dynamic?
00:07:32.586 - 00:07:47.010, Speaker C: They kind of draw when you click. So they draw and stratify. Like, I'll send you the link and you can click through to it and you'll see how it sort of draws.
00:07:54.330 - 00:07:55.880, Speaker E: You're able to get a report.
00:07:57.210 - 00:07:58.120, Speaker C: It's nice.
00:07:59.610 - 00:08:03.798, Speaker D: Yeah. If you want to trade one of mine, I'm open to hearing it.
00:08:03.884 - 00:08:06.470, Speaker C: Okay, well, let me have a look at yours.
00:08:07.790 - 00:08:22.302, Speaker B: Willing to make a deal? That's super cool. So, voter, you just spend all day in the artblocks discord to see these new drops coming? Because this is playground, right?
00:08:22.436 - 00:08:40.530, Speaker C: No, you just go. They have a thing called upcoming things. Upcoming things. And then it adds them all to your calendar automatically. But I'm also on Matt's newsletter because I'm a big fan of. I was. I was like saving all my f.
00:08:40.530 - 00:08:49.060, Speaker C: For this drop? I think so. Well, I mean, I've. Yeah. So far so good.
00:08:50.470 - 00:08:54.760, Speaker B: Okay, cool. So I'm just going to ping people in the discord one more time and then we can get going.
00:09:00.030 - 00:09:07.420, Speaker C: There's my other one, but I like my first one more.
00:09:25.410 - 00:09:27.002, Speaker B: Should we get going?
00:09:27.156 - 00:09:27.860, Speaker C: Cool.
00:09:34.790 - 00:09:35.778, Speaker E: Shall we?
00:09:35.944 - 00:09:39.842, Speaker B: Yeah, let's go for it. Cool.
00:09:39.896 - 00:10:17.742, Speaker E: So thanks, everybody, for joining us for another community call of Niftify. We've got some awesome updates for you this time. We've got some new important team members. We've got some very impressive stats that you'll hear about since the last time you guys have been here and some more neat things here and there. Why don't we kick it off like we always do with a little bit of data. Sorry, somebody say something. Okay, Steven, can you help us out with a little bit of info on volume and such?
00:10:17.876 - 00:11:10.810, Speaker B: Sure. Let me just quickly share my screen with you guys and then we can poke around quickly. All right, so share screenplay we are looking here at our loan volume. So this is just a bit of a picture of historical volume going back to when we started in May 2021, which feels like 1000 years ago now. So you can see things were very slow in the beginning. February, march, it really picked up. And so this is as of yesterday.
00:11:10.810 - 00:11:50.634, Speaker B: So it doesn't include today or tomorrow. Probably end up on like four point five, four point six million dollars. So very steady kind of long term growth this month. We've seen the average value of the loans being very high. So we've had quite a few, I think quite a few high value board API clubs, some high value punks and some vframes. So some super strong high value items, but on fewer loans than usual. So it's been interesting to watch, I think, the markets being a bit flat.
00:11:50.634 - 00:12:41.774, Speaker B: I've also noticed a lot more loans coming through on Dai, so I suspect that's because people are probably quite bullish on Ethereum from here. So that's interesting to see that that kind of happened again. That's the same thing happened last time that Ethereum was quite low on historic basis. So I think that's quite interesting. And then we can have a quick look at the projects, look at loan volume by. So if you look at the different projects, we can see that actually not that useful. Never mind.
00:12:41.774 - 00:13:23.420, Speaker B: That's not the one I was looking for. But yeah, so we're kind of still tracking on supers solidly. The empty market hasn't seemed to slow down for us much, so yeah, all in all, going super well. Also wanted to let you guys know that we've got a new team member, Annie, who joined us in this month. So she's helping us out on the marketing side. So she's been hard at work getting to understand the product and the brand and I think she's spoken to a few of you guys, actually. So I'm just going to hand over to Annie quickly so that she can introduce herself and talk a little bit about what's coming up for us on the marketing side.
00:13:25.550 - 00:14:12.570, Speaker F: Yeah, thanks for the intro, Stefan, and hello everyone. I'm super excited to be here. And I was listening to the first community call, recording the previous one before this when I just joined. So yeah, I'm happy now to be part of the team and to talk to you directly now in this capacity. So just a little bit about myself. I have been in marketing for about 15 years now, and I've seen marketing from different sides because I worked for big brands, but also marketing agencies. And I've done a bit of stuff myself as like solopreneur and kind of digital online marketer.
00:14:12.570 - 00:15:13.178, Speaker F: And after that, four years ago, I completely accidentally got into crypto because I started writing on steemit. I ended up with crypto, had no idea what it was, what to do with it, so kind of fell down the rabbit hole there. Then I started working in crypto. So I was part of an ICO team about three months before the ICO, and then a year and a half after the ICO. After that, I worked in a blockchain marketing agency. So during that year and a half, it was very interesting to work with blockchain projects from many different spheres. Since January until now, I was working in Defi, which was interesting, but I felt that it was lacking a little bit of, I don't know, a soul, more creativity, something more exciting.
00:15:13.178 - 00:16:00.430, Speaker F: So I didn't want to leave the sphere, but I wanted to get to something more interesting. So I dived really deep into the NFT space because I was super excited about it. I got very involved with the NFT artists, the NFT creator communities. In the past few months. I did a few collaborative projects and minting a few nfts myself as well. And that was the point where I realized that working in Defi and being so excited about nfts doesn't make sense. I'd rather look into interesting projects that would be in this space and get involved full time into this whole thing and be part of this exciting journey.
00:16:00.430 - 00:16:58.270, Speaker F: So it felt like Nifty Phi was the nice combination and exactly on the crossroads between DeFi and NFTs. And I think it's very important to pick the projects that have amazing teams because eventually, when you work in a project, you spend more time with the team members than sometimes with your family. So I really, you guys are betting on the right. So that's kind of Michael me in a nutshell, the short version of my story. So I've been with the team already during this month. What we did was we had obviously loads of conversations with Stephen and many others. I had few conversations with you guys as well.
00:16:58.270 - 00:17:59.198, Speaker F: And we did some workshops. We came up with different ideas about the branding, positioning, messaging, now developing PR strategy. We already had the first exposure thanks to their engagement. An article mentioning us talking about watching Steve as a result of the interview he gave out today. And obviously we lived with the competitors. We figured out how we would like to differentiate because we know that at the moment, many are coming to the space, so we're making sure that we keep an eye on them as well. But obviously we can't do everything by ourselves.
00:17:59.198 - 00:19:19.086, Speaker F: Executing the marketing strategy includes lots of different things that will require time and effort. So as the first step for that, we have put a vacancy announcement. So we are looking for a new team member who would join our marketing team and help us out mainly with our Twitter account. Because I'm sure all of you know how important that channel is for this space. And we need someone who would dedicate the time and the skill set to our Twitter exposure growth of the Twitter account and make sure that it gets the attention that it needs to get. So ideally, I know that it's very challenging to find the right person who's ticking all the boxes and not only is very involved and knowledgeable into the NFT space, but also has good knowledge and experience with Twitter and is Twitter native and can kind of grow the accounts very fast and is also very good with engaging with communities. So we'll see how lucky we're going to get and how soon we're going to find that person.
00:19:19.086 - 00:20:03.260, Speaker F: But that person doesn't have to be a marketing professional, doesn't have to have been working in the marketing sphere before, because if they live and breathe Twitter, if they know how to use it, if they feel very comfortable with it, plus are passionate about this whole space, I think that's already a very good combination to start from. So, yeah, I guess that's it from my side. So if you know anyone who would be suitable, please let them know that we need someone to come and become part of the team.
00:20:07.720 - 00:20:32.590, Speaker E: Nice. Thanks a lot, Annie. And welcome. Annie and I actually discovered that I apparently, or we connected on LinkedIn something like a year ago, right? A long time ago. And the message that I sent her with my connection request was something like, so I heard you like nifties or something like that. It was short, poignant, and creepy just how I like it.
00:20:33.840 - 00:21:01.616, Speaker F: Now you're here. I've been looking into the space for quite a long time, and periodically I was kind of sending these messages in my different social media accounts saying that who are the coolest people in the NFT space that I should get connected with, or who can I talk to to learn more about the space and stuff like that? So I'm sure your message was probably a follow up of one of those, another type of creepy messages of mine.
00:21:01.808 - 00:21:49.232, Speaker E: I was just kidding about that. But I mean, everybody's going to find their way here eventually, so it's only a matter of time. And yes, my networking game is very strong, so it was just a cool coincidence and a nice happenstance. Okay, let's see. Thanks again, Annie, for taking the time to fill everybody in on our plans a little bit and telling us a little bit about yourself as well. I'm very sure that the community will continue to enjoy getting to know yourself and also everything you've got planned for us. One of the main things that we bring up constantly and that we're always working on here at niftify is connecting what we like to call the right borrowers with the right lenders.
00:21:49.232 - 00:22:21.810, Speaker E: This whole notion of through the user experience, the user interface, and just the platform in general, making you guys on both sides of the coin connect more easily, which will end up resulting in an executed loan. In other words, a loan that has begun and not just listings or not just people who have liquidity and are looking to provide it and vice versa. So to tell us a little bit more on what we're cooking up on that end, we've got voter, I think, right?
00:22:22.900 - 00:22:43.192, Speaker C: Yes, sorry, I was muted. Yes, it's all good. Hi. Yeah, take it away, man. Okay, so I have a little bit of a new tool that we're working on to show you guys. Let me just share my screen with you. Here we go.
00:22:43.246 - 00:23:03.096, Speaker E: If there's somebody who's using discord for the first or second or 10th time and is not used to streams or something like that, whoever is talking, you'll see that it says or streaming, it'll say live next to their name in the list on the left hand column, just click on their name and then click watch stream to see what they're putting on their screen. Sorry to cut you off, voter.
00:23:03.128 - 00:23:03.356, Speaker B: Go ahead.
00:23:03.378 - 00:23:18.050, Speaker C: No problem. Cool. Okay, so I'm going to show you guys our new negotiation tools that we're going to be working on. Is this sort of zoomed in for everybody enough? Can everyone sort of get a good view here?
00:23:19.220 - 00:23:20.404, Speaker B: Yeah, that looks good.
00:23:20.522 - 00:24:26.490, Speaker C: Cool. Okay, so I'm going to go through the screens from a lender and a borrower's perspective. What I've also done is if you guys see over here, we have lend, which is sort of this pink and then this purple over here is borrow. And all the screens that we design from now on is when you're in a lend view, then the whole UI is going to be sort of in pink. And then when you're in a borrow view, the whole UI, all the little accents and all that sort of stuff are going to be in purple just to make it clear to. So anyway, so this is a screen that somebody who has just listed their NFT on the platform would see. Okay, so basically they want a loan, they've set their desired terms and then they can either remove it or update the terms.
00:24:26.490 - 00:25:26.590, Speaker C: Over here we've got a little offers received. This person hasn't received any offers yet, and these are similar, just a sort of screen showing people what similar offers there are on that particular project. So now a lender sees this same NFT and he clicks through to it and he can send an offer. Okay, so he likes this NFT and he sends an offer through and you get a notification as the borrower and it says you've received an offer. You click through to it and it shows you the screen and it goes down to offers received. And then you get a little window here. This will have all the offers that you've received and then within there you can either, can everyone see my mouse cursor by the way.
00:25:29.760 - 00:25:30.636, Speaker E: Seeing it?
00:25:30.738 - 00:26:05.860, Speaker C: Yeah, you can. Okay, cool. So then you've got three options here. You can accept the offer as is, you can decline it or you can basically counteroffer. So if you want a counteroffer, this little window pops up. It gives you a summary of the offer and then you can send a message to the lender. We set it up so that only the borrowers can initiate a conversation just to avoid people from getting spammed.
00:26:05.860 - 00:27:05.496, Speaker C: So this guy has offered you seven and a half eth or 30,000 die over 60 days with a repayment of 7.8. Blah blah blah blah blah. Okay, so the borrower then can type in a message which he sends through and then the lender receives it. So they have a little conversation. The guy says, I'd be willing to reduce the duration to 30 days if you offered me an APR under 25%. They have a conversation and once they've kind of come to an agreement, then either party, the lender or the borrower can, either the lender can update the terms of their offer or the borrower can counteroffer with his specific terms. So let's say in this case the borrower counter offers.
00:27:05.496 - 00:27:16.210, Speaker C: He clicks on the counteroffer button and he sets the terms of his counteroffer and then the lender accepts it and their loan goes through.
00:27:17.940 - 00:27:18.448, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:27:18.534 - 00:28:06.770, Speaker C: So the nice thing about this, obviously, is that it's often impossible to find somebody who actually has, especially if they don't even have their username set up. It's just a random code or something. It's very hard to find that person and have a conversation and make a deal. So, yeah, that's what we're working on. And then obviously here's the updated offer, and then you can accept it and then carry on with your deal and that's that. So do you guys have any questions? Anything un. Is everything clear to everybody?
00:28:10.020 - 00:28:13.776, Speaker G: Yes, sir. It looks very good and thank you for sharing that.
00:28:13.878 - 00:28:20.870, Speaker C: Okay, yeah, cool. Okay, well, on to the next topic, I guess.
00:28:21.800 - 00:28:32.650, Speaker A: Sorry, there are some questions John is asking. So there will basically be a discord function baked into the platform.
00:28:34.220 - 00:28:53.820, Speaker C: Well, I mean, it's not going to be as fully featured as discord. It's going to be a relatively basic chat. But yes, it effectively is going to allow people to communicate on the platform, which obviously has a lot of advantages because you can't always find that person on discord.
00:28:54.560 - 00:29:20.810, Speaker B: Exactly. And I mean, so discord is more set up for general chat, so you might still want to kind of connect with somebody on discord afterwards. But our tools will be kind of geared around getting to a deal. So you can see that right in the chat, you can make offers and counter offers, and it's probably a general pattern that we'll follow in the future and adding other places and ways for people to communicate with each other.
00:29:22.940 - 00:29:25.450, Speaker D: I do have something to suggest on this screen.
00:29:25.900 - 00:29:28.490, Speaker C: Okay, sure. Let me reshare it.
00:29:29.260 - 00:29:58.300, Speaker D: It's okay, I don't need to see it again. So I think it's not very obvious what's being offered there at first glance, because it was like 7.5 e, 30k die and then repayment value, it's 7.8 e. I think it would be much more clear if the die and the ETH loans, which, by the way, awesome feature. I'm waiting for that. But they should just be separate loans.
00:29:58.300 - 00:30:12.712, Speaker D: Like they look right now, completely separate loans. So you can't confuse like wait, can I accept the Eth loan and then repay the dai? Or why is there both Dai and ETh here? And new users might be confused by that.
00:30:12.846 - 00:30:13.144, Speaker C: Okay.
00:30:13.182 - 00:30:16.760, Speaker B: That's suggesting that it should be two separate offers.
00:30:18.620 - 00:30:30.270, Speaker D: Yeah. In the UI, the user might do it in the same offer, like the same action, but then for the borrower on the UI, it shows as two separate offers, same person.
00:30:30.640 - 00:30:32.750, Speaker B: Yeah, that's actually quite a clever idea.
00:30:34.320 - 00:30:34.972, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:30:35.106 - 00:30:43.970, Speaker B: Because you're going to have to sign, I think you probably have to sign separately for those offers anyway. So you'll have to sign twice. So it actually makes sense to split it into two.
00:30:46.180 - 00:31:21.470, Speaker C: We did set it up so that if you, as the borrower, have specified ranges. Right. So you're saying I'm looking for a loan between five and seven f. If the lender offers you a loan, let's say you say, I'm looking for a loan between five and seven f, between 30 and 60 days, and the lender sends you an offer that meets, that falls within those parameters, then it will automatically accept it.
00:31:22.240 - 00:31:28.880, Speaker B: It can. So you can specify that you're willing to have it automatically accept, but it won't happen all the time.
00:31:28.950 - 00:31:32.210, Speaker C: No, you have to specify it.
00:31:33.140 - 00:31:36.416, Speaker D: But anyway, have you shown the new.
00:31:36.518 - 00:31:41.190, Speaker B: Screen for placing an offer where you can put the ranges? I'm not sure if we've demoed that.
00:31:41.560 - 00:31:44.390, Speaker C: I did show that last time, but I can show it again quickly.
00:31:47.000 - 00:31:48.310, Speaker B: You got to say something.
00:31:53.480 - 00:31:55.496, Speaker C: I think Arad was going to say something.
00:31:55.678 - 00:32:36.016, Speaker D: Yeah, I was going to say that. I think Al and I discussed the auto accept feature a while back. Mean, personally I don't like it. I think it's not good for the borrower, who's not very attentive. I definitely see scenarios where users just want to auto, they click auto accept at ten to 20 e and then somebody two months later makes them the offer and the loan is accepted. And they didn't even see the loan being accepted. And now it's like they default without even knowing.
00:32:36.016 - 00:32:49.690, Speaker D: So for me as a lender, because I mostly lend nowadays, that's actually very good. And I want this, but just for the sake of the customer support and for the platform, I'm not sure I think this is a good idea.
00:32:51.340 - 00:33:18.710, Speaker B: Just a couple of nuances there. So listings will also expire so they won't just hang around forever. So I think that partly kind of cleans things up for people and then the default would be exactly as it is right now. You'll have to opt into this auto accept feature on a per loan basis. It's not a good global setting. So if you as a borrower don't like doing it, you just don't have to.
00:33:23.270 - 00:33:29.090, Speaker H: So will the lenders be able to see if somebody has that auto accept activated?
00:33:29.910 - 00:34:08.798, Speaker B: Yes, you'll be able to see that in the listing. Okay, great. But yes, I don't know how popular it's going to be because exactly like Arad said, I think you give up a little bit of control, but if you've done it multiple times and you know you're responsible and you kind of keep track of your stuff, it's like just a way to kind of automate the process a little bit and make it especially for lenders. If you know that you're willing to give a loan within that range and you know it's going to be accepted, it's very nice to be able to be guaranteed that you're going to get this deal.
00:34:08.964 - 00:34:12.500, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree. It's very good ux for the lender. That would be dope, actually.
00:34:13.350 - 00:34:18.050, Speaker H: And it makes it more likely that a lender will make a loan.
00:34:19.270 - 00:34:50.030, Speaker B: Exactly. So I think it'll eventually become almost like a way to signal that you're serious about accepting a loan, because I think you see things being listed and not never accepting offers even though they get kind of what they're asking for. And I think it's potentially people just fishing to get evaluation for their assets or not really sure if they want a loan or just trying to see what they can get. But obviously, as a lender, you have to kind of now fish through all of those ones to find the people who are being really serious.
00:34:51.970 - 00:34:53.600, Speaker D: Nice. I like it.
00:34:55.170 - 00:35:25.966, Speaker B: Other thing that we're also doing along those lines is that a lender can offer a fee for somebody to find. I mean, a borrower can offer a fee for someone to find them. A lender, in the same way that you can offer a commission in opensea if you want people to find a sale for you. So that's just another way for people to signal that they're seriously looking for a loan today, asking for another look at that screen.
00:35:26.148 - 00:35:27.200, Speaker C: Okay. Sure.
00:35:27.690 - 00:35:28.440, Speaker B: It.
00:35:33.130 - 00:35:41.100, Speaker C: There we go. This one.
00:35:45.550 - 00:35:46.300, Speaker D: See?
00:35:48.670 - 00:35:51.542, Speaker B: Yeah, that's cool. He's having a look. Thanks, Vita.
00:35:51.686 - 00:35:53.722, Speaker C: Okay, take it through.
00:35:53.856 - 00:36:00.400, Speaker D: In the new version, will we be able to see when the listing was made?
00:36:00.850 - 00:36:14.180, Speaker B: Yes, we'll do listings, and not all this stuff will happen all the same time. But, yes, we'll do listing dates. We'll look at views, too. So you'll see how many times it's been viewed. That kind of thing?
00:36:14.630 - 00:36:26.360, Speaker C: Yeah. So here you can see, for instance, you'll be able to even categorize it by when it was received chronologically, obviously.
00:36:28.330 - 00:36:41.820, Speaker D: I'm also wondering if we can move on to a different subject, unless there's more questions. Just let me know when we move on.
00:36:42.830 - 00:37:09.540, Speaker A: Okay. There are a few questions in the chat regarding this presentation. Walter. Okay, so John is asking, will the lender be able to see if the auto accept is activated. This is very helpful from a lender perspective. Similar topic, will lenders be able to set an expiration date on their offer? So two questions.
00:37:12.090 - 00:37:26.854, Speaker C: I can easily add that. Actually, let me make a note of that so that you can see that auto accept is on. But that's just a text field so it would be in the description of the sale here. So you could just say auto accept.
00:37:26.902 - 00:37:34.460, Speaker B: On or like a flag because especially it'll be on the listings page.
00:37:36.910 - 00:37:42.910, Speaker C: It can be a flag. Here I can add one auto accept on. So what was the second question?
00:37:42.980 - 00:37:51.290, Speaker B: Quite easily filter on that. So we can have a filter that shows you only listings that have auto accept on.
00:37:51.380 - 00:37:53.810, Speaker A: Yeah, great.
00:37:53.960 - 00:37:55.460, Speaker C: What was the second question?
00:37:56.390 - 00:38:02.260, Speaker A: Second question was will lenders be able to set an expiration date on their offer?
00:38:04.950 - 00:38:15.290, Speaker B: Yes, they will be as part of the signature expiration dates of the listings now. So we'll probably pick a default, but you'll be able to override.
00:38:16.990 - 00:38:27.790, Speaker A: Cool. And then meta is asking, did you mention the borrower stats, default rate, comma percentage, loans accepted, et cetera.
00:38:31.170 - 00:38:44.370, Speaker B: There is default rates on there. Voto view. Got one that shows scroll to the where you see the user stat.
00:38:49.050 - 00:38:49.960, Speaker C: Hold on.
00:38:52.730 - 00:38:55.880, Speaker B: There we go. So you can see.
00:38:57.210 - 00:39:17.280, Speaker A: Great. Okay, so Mata is happy with the answer. Amazing. And then I don't know if anyone else has any more questions regarding the new fixes. You guys can share that in the chat or feel free to discuss.
00:39:19.090 - 00:39:19.550, Speaker B: But.
00:39:19.620 - 00:39:35.458, Speaker A: We can move on to another question which is not relevant to this. It's about our roadmap regarding the topic. So it says, what are the plans timing of a token? So flying Falcon is asking that.
00:39:35.624 - 00:40:05.840, Speaker B: Yeah, so token, we're kind of doing everything that we need to do technically to make that possible. But the most important thing for us is to be able to kind of distribute that token to people who actually use the platform. And to do that we want to kind of build up a history of usage. So we're not rushing to get the token out. We're kind of looking at, looking at from multiple aspects to kind of build the best long term solution for the community, but still hardworking at it.
00:40:07.650 - 00:40:08.400, Speaker A: Perfect.
00:40:09.090 - 00:40:13.840, Speaker B: And then arud, you had other topic that you want to talk about.
00:40:15.490 - 00:40:17.258, Speaker D: It's really not that important, so I'll.
00:40:17.274 - 00:40:24.260, Speaker B: Just leave it to the oh no, it's fine, go for it. Now. I think we're just basically doing q and a now.
00:40:26.630 - 00:40:33.430, Speaker D: So what's your stance on what are you planning to do with c bonds in the activity?
00:40:33.850 - 00:41:07.470, Speaker B: Yes, we need to remove them. But the thing is we don't have the functionality yet, so we need to build something that allows us to filter those things out. So it needs to go up to the backlog. But yes, what we'll do with them is hide them from the UI. Hide them from the activity feed. We can actually hide them from the activity feed already elad. Maybe we can do that next week and just unsubscribe to the cbond feeds in our discord.
00:41:07.470 - 00:41:32.924, Speaker B: Awesome treat. And then we just need to filter them out from the front end. But that requires a little bit of custom code that we haven't been able to schedule into the roadmap just yet. If you guys want screenshots, I have another question.
00:41:32.962 - 00:41:56.644, Speaker D: Sorry. On that note, because you're adding the upshot valuation and the openc floor to projects, maybe you can add like show high value loans only when you're browsing on the lender tab. So maybe I can filter out quite easily all the ENS domains and the shit I don't care about.
00:41:56.842 - 00:42:29.870, Speaker B: Yeah. So you want to be able to filter by floor price. Yeah, I think we can do. Yeah, you just want something a little bit fuzzy right. Because none of those things are actually accurate. But you can always say, well, only show me things with the average of all of these metrics indicate that it looks like it's worth more than five or something like that. Yeah, that's a good one.
00:42:29.870 - 00:42:44.230, Speaker B: Ideally you'd be as close as possible to that actual asset, but it might actually just be kind of the floor of the project. I think we can come up with something that would work for that.
00:42:48.020 - 00:42:48.770, Speaker D: Cool.
00:42:50.740 - 00:43:00.740, Speaker B: Yeah, so let's just chat about it. We also need to talk because it makes a bit more. We need to then have that data in the database. So let's just chat about it, see if it's actually practical.
00:43:01.080 - 00:43:01.830, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:43:06.680 - 00:43:20.010, Speaker B: And then, and we also, there's about a million other things on the list. Right. So we always have to kind of weigh these things off against other things. So we'll have to just see where it fits into the roadmap. There's a lot.
00:43:22.540 - 00:43:24.250, Speaker D: Sure. Understand.
00:43:25.680 - 00:43:50.630, Speaker B: If you guys want screenshots of some of these screens, just voter, can you just drop some into the chat? Maybe put it in design feedback? There's a channel called under. Where is it? It's in product design feedback. We can drop some screens in there and you guys can have a look.
00:43:51.080 - 00:43:52.950, Speaker C: Yeah, I'll drop them now.
00:43:59.880 - 00:44:38.680, Speaker B: Any other questions? Are there like things that you guys are maybe adjacent products that you think would be interesting things that needs that you see in the market that you think we should be aware of. I take that as a no. If you guys do come up with anything, just let me know. I'm always open to dms or just like mention stuff in bugs or suggestions. We're always looking for feedback.
00:44:41.100 - 00:44:49.880, Speaker I: Maybe just like bundling nfts together. So I'm not sure if that's a feature that's available yet, but low price NFT.
00:44:50.800 - 00:45:14.230, Speaker B: So the smart contracts for that are done. It's with the auditors at the moment. We are fixing a few small issues that they found and should get the final audit report some early next month and then kind of work to pushing that live. So that's definitely coming. It's on the medium term roadback. Thanks.
00:45:17.400 - 00:45:19.670, Speaker H: So another r1, quick.
00:45:20.520 - 00:45:21.270, Speaker E: Sorry.
00:45:21.800 - 00:45:22.550, Speaker D: Hello?
00:45:24.300 - 00:45:56.050, Speaker H: Yeah, this is John. So any plans? Let's just say like the yacht club nfts the board ape at any given time there might be ten or 15 on the platform. Is there going to be any way where I can just make a blank offer to all 15 of that project and let's just say I want to offer ten ethereum at a certain rate and it become basically a global offer? Anything like that in the works?
00:45:56.500 - 00:46:35.550, Speaker B: Yes, it's in the works. It's easy to do at a project level. So like you just said, so ten ether for any board ape, it becomes much more useful when you can add in a little bit of extra metadata. So saying board apes with the following traits or only zombie like crypto punks, that's a little bit more difficult. But it's definitely on the roadmap for design to be fit into the next protocol update, so. Yes, but there's still a few technical things that we need to figure out.
00:46:36.720 - 00:46:37.870, Speaker H: Great, thanks.
00:46:51.250 - 00:47:15.760, Speaker E: Does anybody else have any questions or thoughts or feedback about literally anything at all? I'm really digging the user interface and the direction that it's taking because it kind of reminds me a little bit. Has anybody ever used one of those freelance contracting websites?
00:47:17.540 - 00:47:20.420, Speaker B: Yes. Was it upwork?
00:47:20.760 - 00:47:55.760, Speaker E: Yeah, exactly. You're not taking a loan there, right? It's a project, so you're selling service. It's somewhere like in between selling a nifty and there's just like terms there that you need to discuss. So you have the chat element and you also have the offer and the mean, like in their specific situation. They also have milestones and whatever, which are a little less relevant here, but. Well, John, thanks for joining us, man. Thanks for all your questions.
00:47:55.760 - 00:48:07.030, Speaker E: Also see you next time. And, yeah, and it's just really interesting that everybody will be able to do everything that they need directly inside the platform itself.
00:48:09.320 - 00:48:21.770, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, maybe that's also something to just ask about is are there other places that you would like to be able to speak to users of the platform and in other ways?
00:48:28.000 - 00:48:33.100, Speaker E: Could you elaborate on that question, Steven?
00:48:33.680 - 00:49:17.496, Speaker B: Well, so at the moment, with this demo that we showed, now we're allowing people to start communicating once there's an offer on the table. Another thing I guess that I see happen sometimes is people form relationships between a borrower and a lender, and then they'll kind of pre negotiate a loan, which you can't do with this UI, for example. So I'm just know. So we're solving like the most obvious place where you need to be able to communicate between the borrower and lender. But I'm just wondering, are there other places where it would be useful to be able to chat to someone as a different part of the flow of this making a deal? I don't know.
00:49:17.518 - 00:50:16.990, Speaker E: That's a good question, that maybe the community will want to give in their input. I feel like you can probably take care of everything that you need directly in the chat platform. Plus, at least as far as I'm aware, it doesn't sound like Niftify will be limiting them to chatting only in the platform, which is what the other platforms do, right, for the freelancing and stuff. They tell you that you're not supposed to exchange contact information and they want to keep you in there because that's their money maker in the nifty situation, because trust is a main issue, especially with high value loans. So even if you've traded with somebody or taken a loan or given one on multiple occasions, you'll probably use the platform anyway, just because there's no reason to take a chance. So there's nothing preventing somebody from saying like, hit me up on discord or something like that. But I also feel that it's just the most convenient to keep it all on the item page, don't you think?
00:50:21.490 - 00:51:08.640, Speaker G: Yes, this is a blue camo. I think it's most convenient. Also, is it the most secure when doing stuff like that and on the terms of security? One question I had was, so I was just reading through that you have to sign over in metamask your rights for nifty fi to spend your wrapped eth or whatever coin it is. Is there going to be a feature to where you could turn that on and off? It's your choice. Just for those who are a little oversensitive to granting that access. There's been a lot of products offering services to clear that out. And you can reverify, obviously, but just wondering about that.
00:51:09.570 - 00:51:47.260, Speaker B: Yeah, actually that makes complete sense to be able to remove verification again. There's a million features to build and we just haven't gotten there. And there used to be places where you could just externally go turn that off and shows you who all's got permission to do what's on your wallet. There is a way to do it. It's not directly on platform, but you're right, it should really be a feature in your account section somewhere where you can just go remove access to all of those things. So we are not against it, but it's not currently high up on the roadmap. If people feel strongly about it, let us know.
00:51:47.260 - 00:51:50.480, Speaker B: We can definitely bump it up the priority list.
00:51:53.090 - 00:51:54.080, Speaker G: Thank you.
00:52:01.510 - 00:52:33.110, Speaker I: Going back to that communication and security, it might be worth being able to verify your discord account with the offer, or having some way to do that so that you know, you're not chatting to someone that's impersonating someone else on discord. Because I've had that a few times with NFT communities. Someone messages you an offer and then they kind of try and draw you down the garden path into something that's a bit dodgy.
00:52:33.270 - 00:52:59.010, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes sense. At the moment, you can set your discord handle in your account section, and to do that, you need to sign a message with your private key so that we know that you're the owner of that address. So you can already do that. And that's quite an easy thing to surface as part of the chat, to see the verified discord handle.
00:53:00.550 - 00:53:15.174, Speaker E: I feel like, if anything, that's a good argument for the future use of solely the platform chat. Right. Because that's the way that you know that you're definitely chatting with the owner of the nifty. You have to log in with your metamask anyway.
00:53:15.292 - 00:53:15.910, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:53:15.980 - 00:53:27.050, Speaker G: Agreed. That's where I was kind of coming from, because they could tell you any discord username and then you go out there, third party, and then you're going down a rabbit hole.
00:53:30.770 - 00:53:36.046, Speaker E: For sure. So, Stephen maybe better. Rod. Sorry about that.
00:53:36.228 - 00:53:39.022, Speaker D: I'll add something. I think it would be pretty cool.
00:53:39.076 - 00:53:50.014, Speaker B: Because if there's nothing else from anybody else, I think Stephen is the end. He was talking of the session now.
00:53:50.212 - 00:53:50.778, Speaker C: Steven.
00:53:50.874 - 00:54:01.554, Speaker B: Yeah. Let me know if there's anything else anybody wants to chat about, otherwise we'll be doing another one of these. Again, if there's any topics that you guys would like to cover or suggest.
00:54:01.602 - 00:54:02.354, Speaker C: Is he not hearing?
00:54:02.402 - 00:54:08.700, Speaker B: Welcome to let Nina or myself know and we'll make sure we can put it on there.
00:54:09.070 - 00:54:13.260, Speaker C: Steven, can you hear us?
00:54:16.830 - 00:54:19.122, Speaker I: I think he had muted his headphones.
00:54:19.286 - 00:54:20.366, Speaker C: Something went wrong there.
00:54:20.388 - 00:54:22.480, Speaker E: He just muted the wrong thing.
00:54:23.010 - 00:54:24.000, Speaker D: Oh, man.
00:54:28.450 - 00:54:32.590, Speaker C: Yeah, someone was actually talking. Sorry. Do you want to restart that conversation?
00:54:36.210 - 00:54:41.090, Speaker E: That was a rod, I think you want to go ahead, man. We'll try to get Stephen back here, but we're listening.
00:54:43.110 - 00:55:52.474, Speaker D: Yeah, that was funny. Ok, so I was thinking maybe because as a lender, it's true that what you said, I do have a relationship, I mean, as a borrower as well, I do have often a relationship where most of my volume comes from one or two people who I transact with regularly. And yeah, I talk to them on Discord, but I think it would be pretty cool if you add, I don't want to say social elements to NFTFI because I don't like this way, but a general chatting feature where you can chat with your favorite and establish relationships with your favorite and constant people that you trade with, that you transact with, and, I don't know, add them as friends, be able to chat with them whenever, even when you don't have an active offer. I think it might increase the volume and successful loans. That would be pretty cool.
00:55:52.672 - 00:56:41.354, Speaker E: I was thinking along those lines also before of maybe kind of like, again, like you're saying not for strictly chat purposes, because we also don't want neither borrowers nor lenders to be spammed, but maybe some sort of rendition of a friend list or connection list or something. That's another thing. I think that we can maybe take a few lessons from, from those service provider contracting platforms because they have something like that. For instance, sometimes when, I don't know if it's only after you've already engaged somebody in the past or even without that, but you can invite specific people to bid offers on your service contract. So maybe you can invite people, for example, to give offers on your collateral or vice versa or something like that. Is that like along the lines of something you're thinking about?
00:56:41.472 - 00:57:12.980, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. And I think, as you say, it would be like you don't want people to be spammed. So I think a good option would be that you can chat with anybody. A user on the platform will be defined as associate. If you have transacted before, like you were part of the same loans, and then from now on you can chat with each other directly on the platform and invite him to offer loans and on.
00:57:14.390 - 00:57:50.734, Speaker E: Cool. So, I mean, that's something the team can discuss internally and sounds like a good idea to at least consider. By the way, everybody, I understand that Steven's discord just crashed, so when he was talking, it was just like the final breaths of his software that was going haywire. And there was, of course, no intention of being rude, but I apologize for that. Cool. So I guess we're towards wrapping up here. Anybody have anything else? Members as well? More than welcome to bring anything up.
00:57:50.734 - 00:57:52.274, Speaker E: Daniel, what about you?
00:57:52.472 - 00:58:02.050, Speaker B: I really like the idea of maybe a general chat on your site. It's a really good point. Do you have anything else on your roadmap.
00:58:05.370 - 00:58:10.182, Speaker E: Generally speaking, that we can present today or in a specific direction that you're thinking?
00:58:10.236 - 00:58:17.430, Speaker B: Yeah, in general, maybe also next year or what's the future about NFT Phi?
00:58:19.290 - 00:58:32.160, Speaker C: Stephen, are you back online? We just had a question about what's on the roadmap for the future.
00:58:34.530 - 00:58:37.834, Speaker B: So what do you mean roadmap for the future? Long term, short term?
00:58:37.882 - 00:58:38.670, Speaker C: Long term?
00:58:39.410 - 00:59:43.250, Speaker B: Long term? To answer that question, I think we kind of need to take a step back and think about where are we now in this whole kind of revolution that's nfDs, which is really just kind of digital property rights, and we are just super early. Right. So I think we've got a long way to go. And I kind of see there's this whole DFI world that is aimed squarely at doing things for fungible tokens, erc twenty s, all that kind of stuff. So we've seen this huge explosion of things happening there, and I think we're going to see a similar ecosystem develop, which is geared towards nfTs. And then there's going to be bridges between them. So there's going to be ways to kind of turn non fungible tokens into semifungible or fungible, and then kind of plug them into existing kind of decentralized finance applications.
00:59:43.250 - 01:00:54.170, Speaker B: But on a big picture view, everything, there's going to be more unique digital items than there are unique physical items. And you can think about all of the financial services that you need for physical items like insurance, rentals, loans, and a whole bunch of things that you could never do with physical items that you become now possible because you kind of like programmable digital property rights. That's kind of like the future that I see. I see there's a whole new parallel metaverse, if you want to call it that, with property rights and finance kind of being built online. And nfts are going to be a core foundational part of that. And then Niftify really wants to kind of be there to kind of help build financial tools that are kind of squarely geared towards nfts. So not trying to make nfts into fungible tokens and trying to kind of squash them into a uniswap pool.
01:00:54.170 - 01:01:59.710, Speaker B: More building things that are kind of native to nfts that acknowledge the fact that there's a community around them, that people care about them more than just financial assets. There's an emotional connection to a lot of these assets. Obviously, there are some people who just is purely in it for the money, and obviously there's a financial component to it, but there's more to it in the NFT space than you would normally see in normal defi land. So we want to kind of be a core part of building that infrastructure. So part of the like reason we've designed the next version of the protocol to be more an NFT agreement protocol, of which the first agreements are loans, but we can plug in other kinds of agreements and other types of contracts in there as long as they kind of take nfts as the base and they would produce nfts to represent the positions in those actual agreements. So that's kind of where we see ourselves really focusing on loans and different types of loans for different kinds of use cases, but then also other financial products. In the future.
01:01:59.710 - 01:02:19.370, Speaker B: As this market matures and you see more and more people entering into it, there's going to be other things you need to be able to do in a financial capacity on top of your nfts. Cool. Thank you. Pleasure. Glad that. I hope that was clear.
01:02:20.780 - 01:02:21.850, Speaker D: Very cool.
01:02:27.160 - 01:02:27.620, Speaker B: Cool.
01:02:27.690 - 01:02:28.710, Speaker C: Any other questions?
01:02:34.860 - 01:02:51.220, Speaker B: Yeah, sorry for disappearing on you guys like that. I don't know what happened to my discord. I got a lot of love. At least I'm good for something then, I guess. Okay.
01:02:58.150 - 01:03:01.900, Speaker C: Do you have anything else we want to talk about or are we going to wrap this up?
01:03:02.910 - 01:03:06.586, Speaker E: Not to my knowledge. Let's tie a bow on it and.
01:03:06.608 - 01:03:07.194, Speaker B: Put it to bed.
01:03:07.232 - 01:03:39.620, Speaker E: I guess. We'll thank everybody again for joining us on one more community call. We're already going to start planning the next one for you, and we hope that you're excited, as we are, to see these next updates rolling out. Don't forget to keep on submitting the various projects for whitelisting. You guys have been really excellent in doing that and it's really been helping us out a lot. We know that we need to pick up the pace a little bit on the whitelists and that's going to happen. We have a methodology for that.
01:03:39.620 - 01:03:47.430, Speaker E: So that's another thing to look forward to and just help spread the word in general. But aside from that, thanks again, everybody.
01:03:47.500 - 01:04:07.310, Speaker C: For, yeah, maybe that's something. Sorry, worth noting. It's not something you guys would see, but we actually built a tool that makes it much easier for people in niftify to whitelist so we can expect it to be a bit more dynamic around that. Am I correct, Stephen?
01:04:08.210 - 01:04:38.950, Speaker B: Yep, that's correct. With a very early version of the website, it was a very manual process because we had zero resources and we were kind of having to build absolutely only what was necessary. And then we eventually got around to kind of making the process much smoother and easier. So things that would take us hours to do before take us literally minutes now. So it should be much easier going forward. So we should be much more responsive.
01:04:42.690 - 01:04:47.460, Speaker E: Sweet. Basically what that means. Yeah, go ahead.
01:04:48.630 - 01:05:11.034, Speaker A: I just want to ask the community if the time is convenient for you guys. Like every month that we have our community call or is it something that you would like to change? So the scheduled time is. It's fine. We can keep this on. Every month is something that is fine for you guys.
01:05:11.232 - 01:05:17.740, Speaker C: I think we had a fairly good turnout today, so it seems to be a reasonable time for a lot of people.
01:05:18.990 - 01:05:20.860, Speaker B: Arad, were you going to say something.
01:05:22.510 - 01:05:24.202, Speaker D: I just said works for me.
01:05:24.256 - 01:05:52.520, Speaker B: The awesome. But again, you know, you guys are welcome to if you want a different time or a different topic or want to discuss something that's happening in the markets, we're also happy to schedule kind of ad hoc ones or do more of these kind of little bit more informal things. I quite liked that little discussion in the beginning around that new art blocks drop. So also happy to just have those kind of hangouts from time to time.
01:05:55.130 - 01:05:58.600, Speaker E: We're going to find a new music bot. We're going to make that happen.
01:05:59.290 - 01:06:01.480, Speaker B: I heard you can sing really well. A lot.
01:06:02.250 - 01:06:03.480, Speaker E: Working on it.
01:06:05.850 - 01:06:07.462, Speaker B: All right, cool. Thanks, guys.
01:06:07.596 - 01:06:08.280, Speaker C: Thanks.
01:06:09.290 - 01:06:10.198, Speaker E: Good night, everybody.
01:06:10.284 - 01:06:11.662, Speaker C: Jesse, buddy, thank you.
01:06:11.716 - 01:06:16.090, Speaker D: Goodbye. Thank you, everyone. Bye.
