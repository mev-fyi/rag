00:00:00.090 - 00:01:09.522, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. This is Niftyfi's official Twitter space. We are going to do them on a weekly basis covering different topics related to the NFT space. For those of you who don't know what Niftify is, it's a peer to peer platform where you can get a cryptocurrency loan on your NFT or offer loans to others against their. If, if you would like to join our discord and get more details and engage with our community, the link is on our profile. Other than that, I guess today we're going to have a very interesting conversation because we're going to dive into the NFT history and start sort of going back and looking at where and how things started. And I think Carlini is the best person because back in those days he's been there and then, and we can kind know, discuss this from a person who's done it, who's seen it and who has witnessed everything.
00:01:09.522 - 00:01:15.330, Speaker A: So Carlini would like to start by just introducing yourself and then we can start rolling.
00:01:16.650 - 00:02:02.020, Speaker B: Hi, Carlini. Eight or Carlini been in nfts coming up to four years now, I think month and a few weeks away from four years. Been addicted since. Just going with the space. I guess as it has evolved, I've evolved and I've done lots of different things in the space, from degenning to flipping to buying and holding to losing it all to building it up to building companies. So yeah, lots of different things in the space. Looking forward to talking about the past.
00:02:02.710 - 00:03:07.510, Speaker A: Okay, sounds good. It feels like you've seen it all. When I was tweeting about this and my personal Twitter account saying that we're going to have this conversation, I actually got several messages saying that you've been the person who helped them get into the space. And many people were super excited to learn that we're going to have this conversation. It feels like you have influenced many people and helped them get into the space, which is really cool. Okay, so let's go back in those times when it was all starting, I think almost four years ago, my personal first experience was with cryptokitties. And I have a feeling that back in those crazy times of when cryptokitties almost broke the whole network and clogged it and no transactions were going through because so many people were breeding them back then, I feel like.
00:03:07.510 - 00:03:18.090, Speaker A: Do you think we were using the term NFT because I hadn't heard it back then? Were we using that term or not? Did it come later?
00:03:18.240 - 00:03:45.026, Speaker B: Yeah, I'd say so. I don't know. If that's rose tinted glasses, but it should be quite easy to check the cryptokitties discord. I'm just trying to find which folder I've got it in. I'm sure I didn't leave the discord. Surely not cryptokitties. NFT old let's.
00:03:45.026 - 00:04:11.226, Speaker B: It's just loaded. There are so many messages. Yeah, there's a lot of NFT in the cryptokitties discord in 2017. So I think we were using it. It's just a bit of. I'm scrolling through the old messages in the discord and it's Jimmy, it's Alan. That's just the first page of nfts.
00:04:11.226 - 00:04:55.626, Speaker B: It's derpy. All of these guys. Witty kitty, which some of you are known as basketballer. Yes, we were using NFT back in 2017, but really, the whole community was pretty much just on this one discord at the time, at least the active community. So there wasn't really. I think one of our main mistakes as a community was not focusing on Twitter, because discord, you have to get people into discord and then you chat, but Twitter, you just sort of chat and people can stumble upon you, whereas it's hard to stumble upon a discord. So I think that may have slowed our growth back in the day.
00:04:55.808 - 00:05:32.950, Speaker A: Yeah, I would agree with that because I think the same thing was for cryptos and icos and things like that, because then those people were concentrating on telegram as well. So there wasn't really a public social media that was talking about this topic. So much for the masses. So going back to those times and to cryptokitties, how did you end up there? Like, how did you learn about it? How did you discover it? And what was your experience from the very beginning, when you heard about that whole concept, what were your thoughts?
00:05:33.930 - 00:06:04.462, Speaker B: Well, I'd already been in crypto. I think I bought bitcoin in 2015, not much at all. And then I bought Ethereum 2016. Again, not any sort of significant amount. And I mined some bitcoin at some point. So I was aware of crypto. I had crypto and I had lots of different wallets.
00:06:04.462 - 00:06:41.340, Speaker B: I didn't have metamask, and I liked Ethereum more because I knew it could do stuff, but I hadn't done anything with it. And then when I first learnt about NFts, I was in the hospital. So it's sort of dated because my son was not born at that time. We were in the hospital because of complications with him, and we had to stay the night. Now, my wife had the bed and I had a chair. So I also had my laptop. And I was just sitting there.
00:06:41.340 - 00:07:35.790, Speaker B: I was on one of those hospital tables that are supposed to slide over a bed. So it's like a u shape. I had that sort of under my chair, and I was sitting right back because it had gone under sort of a normal chair seat where it was not designed for how I was using it, but it works. And I was just scrolling the Internet and I saw news articles on cryptokitties. And I was into Pokemon cards at the time, and I had Ethereum, and cryptokitties was pretty much mashing Pokemon cards with Ethereum, with, I guess an early Pokemon game and the day trader man. And I couldn't sleep anyway, so can't remember how I transferred the eth. Maybe I bought the eth, but I had to install metamask, send over the ethereum.
00:07:35.790 - 00:08:42.354, Speaker B: And I was just sucked in from there. I remember watching, there was a guy on twitch streaming pretty much the whole time this craziness was going on, which was maybe the floor craziness was maybe a week long. And he was just, if people think, explanation, mark, floor is bad now, this guy was just streaming the floor price for pretty much seven days. And I remember when we nearly got to 0.1 floor for cryptocitties, I was just thinking, the way the model is built, this is just going to collapse. Because it was almost a bit like the tokens that we're seeing now, the staking tokens, where the supply starts so small in the first few days and you want to collect it to then breed a new NFT. And then, because there are so few of these nfts, people are buying them for three, four, five eth, which then drives up the price because people want to buy the token and the supply of that token is so small.
00:08:42.354 - 00:09:21.342, Speaker B: But at some point that NFT is going to drop in price because the supply just keeps growing and the price of the token will drop. And that's kind of what was happening with cryptokitties. And we could see that coming because everyone was, the phrase that you used is cryptokitties killed ethereum, which was commonly reported at the time. But it's good to look back and think the way it killed Ethereum is it took gas to 100. That was crazy. At that time, gas was under one nearly all the time. Cryptokitties took it over 100.
00:09:21.342 - 00:10:10.666, Speaker B: And now if gas is at 300, so three times worse than when cryptokitties killed Ethereum, people are like, oh, what's minting must be going a bit slow if it's at 300. So we've come quite a long way. And now obviously the price of ethereum is all time high. So when you compare the prices just to do anything now to when Ethereum was killed, it's so much higher, which is kind of crazy. So I guess origin story of nfts is in a hospital watching a stream all night on the floor of cryptokitties. Price buying I ever bought two cats or four cats, and then I would just breed them, wait, breed them, sell the whole thing, start again. And I was just hooked.
00:10:10.666 - 00:10:46.540, Speaker B: I don't really know what it was because at the time I was making more money gambling, but it wasn't as fun. This breeding was a game I was playing a game that was making me money, whereas if I was doing my job, I'd be making more money, but it wasn't as fun. So I was hooked in by. I don't know, when you think fun game, you don't think, click, buy some cats, breed them, sell them. But there was just something about it and I can't really put my finger on that.
00:10:47.310 - 00:11:31.146, Speaker A: Maybe. As you mentioned, the fun element is very important because back then it was like this whole ico hype and a crazy roller coast on that level, right in that sphere. And there were lots of tokens and crypto trading and loads of things happening on the other side. But I feel like this was so much simpler and easy to comprehend and as you mentioned, fun. That barrier to entry and kind of the whole process was way more pleasurable. So many people were kind of gravitating towards that. And maybe that is something to you to tell me.
00:11:31.146 - 00:12:01.780, Speaker A: How was the community like? Because I feel like I was in the ico kind of communities back in the times because of my job. It was very mixed, right? There was a bit of toxicity, there were really healthy communities, but it was very mixed kind of combination of different type of people, like speculators, people who believed in the space, et cetera, et cetera. How was it on the crypto kitties side of things?
00:12:03.750 - 00:13:03.234, Speaker B: There were a few weeks at the start that is probably just going to be unrivaled forever in the space. That sounds like a crazy thing to say, but I liken it almost to back in the day when we were kids, when you played a game, there weren't that many games. When online gaming came along, there weren't really that many games you could pick between. So if you picked a big one, there was a good chance your friends were playing as well, and you could play with them, and that would be great. From a massively online role playing game back in the day, you would pick mainly between World of Warcraft or runescape. Like, there were two games to play, and if you're into that thing and your friends were into that thing, there was a good chance you were playing with your friends. Right now, there are so many different games people are playing.
00:13:03.234 - 00:13:30.762, Speaker B: People download games into their steam library. There's a steam sale. You buy 20 games and you've probably only played one of them from a year ago. There's just so many options, and we're almost in that space now of nfTs. There are just so many different projects that people say, oh, you couldn't replicate the board ape community. But at the time of board apes, there were also other communities. There had been year long communities.
00:13:30.762 - 00:14:26.942, Speaker B: There had been two year long communities. Cryptokitties was pretty much the start of NFT communities because, yes, punks were first, and there's pepe on bitcoin and then spells of Genesis and all of this. But when you actually look at discord numbers, I think the cryptokitties discord still has more posts than the punks. And cryptokitties has been dead but not active for two years or something like that. And punks has gained popularity massively as the alpha place. So I put out a tweet a few months, maybe a few weeks ago about the figures. And cryptocitties pretty much started in December as a discord by the end of 2017.
00:14:26.942 - 00:15:00.170, Speaker B: So one month, there were more posts in that discord than three years of punk posts, maybe two and a half years. Something around there, I can't fully remember the tweet, but everyone in the space was in that discord. It wasn't the place to be. It was the only place to be. There was just no other sort of alpha, or you don't go here to find out this. It was the only place. And the other big thing was the mystery.
00:15:00.170 - 00:15:41.138, Speaker B: No one understood when you would breed the cats what was going to come out, and it was on chain. But we didn't know that. We weren't experts right now, you could come up with something on Ethereum, and it's probably cracked that day by someone. It took so long. We weren't looking at tools to figure this out. We had Google sheets, sort of drop down documents that you had to select your cat, and then it would tell you, okay, so your cat has in position one, it has a. In position two, it has b in position three, it has c.
00:15:41.138 - 00:16:15.242, Speaker B: And you had to sort of figure out what this was and everyone was trying to work out. I was one of the higher end breeders at the time. I potentially bred the most cats in 2017. My wallet bred the second most. And I had lots of wallets because Ui wasn't as good as it is now back then. And if you were trying to focus on one thing, you really needed a different wallet to focus on that one thing. So I was breeding loads, yet still when I was trying to, I guess, complete the Game is breed a fancy.
00:16:15.242 - 00:16:45.694, Speaker B: And there was one called mistletoe, which was like, you'd look at this picture and you go, okay, its mouth is a durable, its color is old lace. I can't remember what it had. Maybe a Christmas hat on, because it was mistletoe. It was the Christmas fancy. There was also another one called Santa Claus. And you have to look at this picture, which someone else has bred. You didn't know that the fancy was out there.
00:16:45.694 - 00:17:15.160, Speaker B: Someone had just accidentally bred it. And then everyone's looking at, like, how have they done that? What's gone on? Because you just saw the fancy and it turns out that to make the fancy, you needed to have a cat of certain traits. But we didn't know those traits. We didn't know how to look at the blockchain and see those traits. And no one did. Dapper did, but they weren't telling us. It was just a time of mystery that everyone cared about.
00:17:15.160 - 00:18:11.530, Speaker B: I've seen people try and replicate, know often now, but the issue is there's just too many things to do. Like, I'm not going to go and try and have fun looking at this when I could go over here and mint this and make money. It's just the way of the crowds. The crowds are going over to see where they can get the alpha to focus on the money, not to have fun. And the mystery was the fun, and it was cracked by a guy called Kai and it became known as the Kai genes. So you'd look at your cats and it would say what the Kai genes were. And that stood for maybe a year or two before dapper officially came out and said, okay, this is what it's called.
00:18:11.530 - 00:18:40.660, Speaker B: So there was just this huge community, the cryptocitties community must be bigger than any. I haven't looked at the figures, but it must be bigger than any of the numbers in communities. Now, just because of that fracturing, we've got more people. I have no doubt about that. Cryptocitties took ages to crack 100,000 wallets. But it did hit 60,000 pretty quickly. Lots of people came in.
00:18:40.660 - 00:19:25.746, Speaker B: Lots of people. It was their first NFT and lots of builders. Now, Openc, they started crypticitties. Axio infinity, they started crypticitties. I remember them sort of going, okay, cryptskitties is great, but you can't do anything. We could add battling to the cryptskitties, but why would we when we can sell our own NFT to fund what we need to do? So in a way, crypticitties is the most important NFT project ever because then Opensea wouldn't exist. And if Opensea didn't exist, I would consider opensea the most important, I guess, non NFT project ever.
00:19:25.746 - 00:19:49.066, Speaker B: And without the two of them, I'm not here talking to you. Probably NFTFi, because I met Mm through CK, wouldn't exist. Half Twitter spaces. Most of you in this audience now probably wouldn't have heard of nfts without cryptokitties. And that's just sort of what led us here, I guess.
00:19:49.248 - 00:20:53.070, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I totally agree. I think it's interesting because back in those days, I had a feeling that, because how much traction it got so fast, I had a feeling that, you know what? Everyone was dreaming about mass adoption of crypto, right? So I had a feeling like if there is any project who would have no chance for kind of being the one who leads the mass adoption, those would be cryptokitties, because that was the only project that I knew that had users for whom that was their first experience into any crypto related things. Right. So they hadn't bought any crypto before that. They didn't really invest in bitcoin before that. They were not about icos, but they all went through this small barrier of figuring out ethereum because they wanted to get a cryptokitty. And I think that was a very interesting phenomena.
00:20:53.070 - 00:21:22.440, Speaker A: So why do you think at the moment? I mean, you mentioned that the cryptokitties community was way more engaged and active than the crypto banks one. Apart from the fact that crypto banks was the first, and there is this historical value behind it, why do you think now crypto banks seems to be, and correct me if I'm wrong, seems to be more popular among the masses than cryptokitties. Is it because of the media coverage or there is something else behind it?
00:21:24.650 - 00:22:01.300, Speaker B: Well, it's sort of a combination of things. Dapper had this huge resource from the cryptokitties, sort of boom. And just quickly, to go back on what you said, there you came to cryptokitties and you thought, this is going to bring people in. But really what you were thinking is nfts will bring people in, but there were no competitors. There was nothing else. There was only cryptocitties, even the people who knew about cryptopunks. You looked at it and you were like, well, what are they doing? It's done.
00:22:01.300 - 00:23:11.420, Speaker B: It wasn't a historical artifact at that point because it was only out a few months ago. So when you're there at that point, what's really the difference between cryptokitties and cryptopunks? Few months a better token. So cryptokitties was the first ERC seven two one. I've seen some tweets about someone claiming it was something else in 2018, November was the first seven two one. But what they really mean it was the first seven two one when it was published. And technically, cryptokitties was a beta or something like that, but it was a better token that led to things like openc being able to use it, which unfortunately, you can't really use opensea with cryptokitties because it's older and it doesn't have all of the things they use. I'm not the technical side of any business, so it's something like the sale from or something along those lines wasn't there.
00:23:11.420 - 00:23:48.534, Speaker B: As for why. So punks are limited. Every single punk has value, which right now is sort of meta. I guess we seem to, in the NFT space, go through meta quite a lot. You can look at projects as we go through, even just this year, and go, okay, so we had the hash mask phase of the FoMO ramp. Then we had the board ape phase, where it would be the zero 0.8 fee, 10,000.
00:23:48.534 - 00:24:42.866, Speaker B: So cryptopunks did the 10,000, board apes did the zero eight. And now if you want to try and maximize your gains, you do 10,0000 eight, because that is just what people are used to. So the limited supply of punks has helped the look. I mean, there's no denying that punks look better than your random kitty. There are fancy kitties that look better, but people still, I don't know if we're not actually a huge community from the collectibles world, because most collectibles, there are millions of them, maybe millions is a bit much. Hundreds of thousands, thousands, and only some hold that value in the real world, Pokemon cards, they go for huge amounts. Maybe we're eclipsing it now with nfts.
00:24:42.866 - 00:25:46.250, Speaker B: But back when I used to talk about nfts. Even just yesterday, yesterday, last year, even just last year, before this huge run this year, Pokemon cards were still selling for more. Some NFTs would sell higher than the highest Pokemon cards, but if you wanted to sell something consistently, it would be a Pokemon card over an NFT. But Pokemon cards, there are hundreds of millions of them, but people still want those charizards. People get addicted to these collections and they find out what is rare, what is valuable, which people haven't done with cryptokitties. There are rare ones. Natalie Sport, I can't even remember what it's called, but the Han Solo kitty that was auctioned off for charity originally, and it comes with a physical, and there's an argument there that it's the second best cryptokitty there is after Genesis, the number one, the first ever ERC seven two one token.
00:25:46.250 - 00:26:28.170, Speaker B: But that's just too much work. There's a lot of complicated stuff going on in cryptokitties and honestly, I've forgotten it. It's been maybe two years since, maybe even free since I've done much in crypticitties and bar low number fancies, which is sort of what I was into at the time. I wouldn't be able to say what's rare now. And maybe that's part of the problem. The punk's look how it's capped. And then sort of just the winning the archaeological dig.
00:26:28.170 - 00:26:58.820, Speaker B: So for a long time we in the punks community were saying the first NFT on ETH because we knew about rare pepes. We weren't pretending to be the first. We just bought. We were the first on Ethereum. I've bought and sold 151 cryptopunks. So I was very active in that discord, in not sure I was active in 2018. I think I was just a lurker until autoglyphs and then I was in.
00:26:58.820 - 00:27:32.206, Speaker B: But we knew it wasn't first. But the important thing is the community continued with cryptocitties. We hit such a high and we almost saw something similar with Topshot that they had to fight. Cryptokitties was like I said, basically every NFT. So if you were in nfTs, you were in cryptokitties at a certain point. And then we ticked over to 2018. Crypto market went bad.
00:27:32.206 - 00:28:00.840, Speaker B: It went real bad. And we saw a lot of NFT ponzies that came out as people were sort of trying to figure out what was going. Crypticitty's launch was still probably one of the best products that has launched. It's probably still top 25 now. Out of thousands and thousands, because it was properly done. It was months in the planning. It was a huge team.
00:28:00.840 - 00:28:57.510, Speaker B: And the issue is dapper thought. They broke Ethereum and put all of their profits into flow. So they went from this big team that just launched something great to eventually maybe three or four people working on it. In the end, I think two. And maybe earlier on this year when Topshot was popping off, maybe no one was working on it because they pulled everyone in to make sure Topshot survived. But when you have this sort of huge run up and then a dump, it's really hard to fight back. And when your team keeps getting taken away to work on, which we didn't know at the time, but the team were taken away to work on the flow blockchain and then presumably at some point taken away to work on Topshot before they launched.
00:28:57.510 - 00:29:44.594, Speaker B: When your product is team driven and you take away the team, you've got problems. Whereas punks is a relic, punks is punks lava labs. As long as they don't do anything horrific, or there's no terrible founder history of them doing something awful, or they kill someone, or as long as they're just people who live their life now, nothing really will affect punks. Because they are not promising a game, they are not promising the next social media build, they are not promising yield. They are promising nothing. They just said, here it is, have it, and it was free and they gave it away. And that just meant there's no risk.
00:29:44.594 - 00:30:37.570, Speaker B: It is what it is, and what it is has been picked up as a relic and is now seen as a flex to have. And because it's so old and pretty rare, people want them. Whereas with cryptskitties, you needed dapper to build, and they did. The product is still apart from Axie. I can't think of another community that has played a game that much. There's probably one, or it depends when you would say cryptokitties stopped, because technically people are probably still breeding, making it the longest game, but they took away the support and the support is needed. I think there are still a few employees working on it, but it's not what it could be.
00:30:37.570 - 00:31:40.874, Speaker B: And when something is not what it could be, you don't have, I guess, investor confidence. People aren't going to dedicate the time to figure out your product if you don't have the team working on it to back it up. And I don't know how to say this well, so sorry, Roham, if you're listening, I don't know if they care axie care about the price of their axes. Axie infinity care about the price of axes. You can see that with how they will amend their ecosystem as the game changes, they change meta so that they're constantly looking over it. Whereas dapper don't really care what happens to the floor of cryptokitties, which should be very low, or the floor of fancy cats or founders or anything like that. There's really not much backing from them now.
00:31:40.874 - 00:32:30.830, Speaker B: Maybe that means they're doing something on flow for cryptokitties and we just don't know. They had teased stuff in the past, but you're sort of, I don't know. We've been hurt by them in the past. They were led by Mack, who now is big head, who does stoner cats. And he was, I guess the word is enthusiastic about what they could do. And he's come out and said, I listened to a stoner cat podcast recently where he said, I wasn't even in blockchain, I was just guy like cats and had this crazy vision. And that was kind of clear from what he promised, because he was promising all these things that ended up just not being possible.
00:32:30.830 - 00:33:09.494, Speaker B: So we'd be watching these live streams and he'd say, china's coming. We'd be like, yay. And there was a phase where if you bred these cats, you could get a chinese bio because they were this confident that it was going to come out in China. And there was another time when they teamed up with Steph Curry and they brought out Steph Curry cryptdies. There were three of them, and they started the bid. You could buy these on a descending auction. And they started off at like 800 ethereum or something, or maybe 150 ethereum coming down.
00:33:09.494 - 00:33:59.740, Speaker B: And before it got to about 145, they delisted them because it turned out they weren't actually working with Steph Curry, it was his media team and he had no clue about it at all. And they famously, in one year after Cryptskitty's launch, said, the game starts now. So everyone was waiting for a game, and then a game never turned up. And it was just sort know, it was just promises and not delivering, when in reality, if they'd held it back a bit, they could focus on what they actually were delivering, which was loads by now standards. But we were just sort of, I guess that would be my answer. Why are cryptopunks worth more than cryptokitties? Supply looks complexity team.
00:34:00.510 - 00:34:35.940, Speaker A: Yeah, and probably expectations, because they didn't set any high expectations to deliver. They kind of delivered everything that they had to already. And it was already out there. I'm just thinking, just imagining this time when it was like four years ago, which is like a huge timeframe for this space, right? Everything is changing daily here. Four years is a long, long time. Even now, when people talk about themselves doing some things in the NFT space, many people just don't get it. Many people kind of.
00:34:35.940 - 00:35:02.400, Speaker A: We can't explain it very often to normies, right? We're these crazy people who are dealing with jpegs and doing something really strange that they don't get, et cetera, et cetera. I just want to try to imagine what it was like four years ago, when it was even weirder than now, how people were reacting when you were kind of talking about this stuff.
00:35:04.370 - 00:36:05.370, Speaker B: Well, at the start, cryptskitties was making everyone money because they're sort of the bottleneck that started. So they would release one generation zero kitty every 15 minutes for a year. And that's why Mack had said what he did after a year, because it was called the kitty clock, and that stopped after a year. And still, that was probably the best auction method that we've seen, maybe ever, because it was a dutch auction. Every single one was a dutch auction. But the starting price of the dutch auction was based on the sale price of the last five sales or something like that. So it would amend as, depending on how quickly the earlier ones have been bought, and back then, because of how many people were flocking in and this low supply and people having to provide the kitties themselves.
00:36:05.370 - 00:36:41.758, Speaker B: So you know how you're a liquidity provider now? I was a kitty provider back then. I was breeding these cats and selling them to people to let them in. And what that allowed me to do was make a profit, tell my friends I was making a profit and they were interested. People were interested in a profit. And back then, it was hard compared to now, if I wanted to get someone into an NFT, now it's 100 times easier than back then. Even metamask was hard. Getting onto metamask was hard.
00:36:41.758 - 00:37:19.080, Speaker B: Just, we had to use my e for wallet to do transactions. It was tricky. But people were lured in by money, and when that stopped, it became tough to talk to people. In, say, early 2018, things were. My crypto celebrities was one of the big ones. Back then, it was a pure ponzi. You would buy a celebrity, which was just an NFT with a celebrity's face on it, and it would automatically list slightly higher.
00:37:19.080 - 00:37:48.580, Speaker B: Maybe, I can't remember the exact percent, maybe 15% higher. And 2.5% of that went to the dev team, and the rest would go to you after the sale. So you would buy for one ethereum, and then it would list it for slightly higher, and then you'd get slightly more back if it sold. And it was just a shill fest of trying to get people to buy undue. And you couldn't list, there was no open sea. You couldn't list this NFT for less than it automatically listed for.
00:37:48.580 - 00:38:24.320, Speaker B: There was a possible way by interacting with a contract, but less than 1% of people could use a contract back then. It was crazy. And when you're trying to tell people that basically everything is a hot potato, then they're not interested. You couldn't sell it. You couldn't go on Opensea and sell it. So at the time it was called dividends were a big thing. So I'm not even really sure if they were nfTs, to be honest.
00:38:24.320 - 00:39:20.880, Speaker B: You'd buy a crypto car, and every sale after that, you would take a small percent and the price would rise. So it was like a FOMO ramp, but the extra price would go to the person who bought before. So if car 15 was sold, the person who'd bought car 1234-5678 910, 1112, 1314 all got a dividend for that sale. So you'd have 15 people trying to shill someone into the 16th, and then you'd have 16 people trying to shill into the 17th. And it was quite hard trying to tell people, this is going to be the future. While it's just a shill fest of buy my new NFT, there weren't really many sort of strong projects. I invested in so many games, and the only one left is axie infinity from that time.
00:39:20.880 - 00:40:05.654, Speaker B: And even axe started with a FOMO ramp back in 2018. They had free separate FOMO ramps for the different types of axes that you were buying. And I remember I kept buying plant because no one else was buying it and it was just cheaper. And I guess people were looking at it pokemon wise where no one really wants barbers all that much. And I guess you just got a lot of crazy looks. And I tell people, I really think this is the future. I remember sitting around a pool at a stag do telling 15 guys in Ibiza, yeah, my cryptokitties, I'm going to retire on these one day because they are.
00:40:05.654 - 00:40:14.400, Speaker B: NFTs will be the future and they will be seen as artifacts. Unfortunately, obviously, that was cryptopunks, not cryptokitties. But I was close.
00:40:16.370 - 00:41:06.354, Speaker A: Mean you've been in this space quite long and you're still here. So obviously things have developed beyond crypto kitties. So what are you looking into? What kind of projects you're interested in and how are you choosing among projects? Because you already mentioned that the space is really crowded. There are loads of projects coming out one after the other. There are legit ones, there are some kind of dodgy ones, there are ones more focused on art. There are some that are kind of probably better for speculative purposes, et cetera. What is your attention just directed at and how do you choose between projects? Because I'm sure many people are really overwhelmed in this space and there's so much going on.
00:41:06.354 - 00:41:10.660, Speaker A: So what's your kind of way of looking at things?
00:41:11.830 - 00:41:53.018, Speaker B: Well, there's kind of a few ways to look at it and it depends on what you're after. So if you just want the quick flip profit, you don't really care too much about the projects. You don't really care too much about their long term view. You more care about the hype around the project. You think you're good enough at gas wars or making new accounts or drawing things for whitelist that you can get into the mints and then maybe pre reveal. Or if you hit a rare, you just flip these and you move on to the next project. You're almost like an NFT day trader.
00:41:53.018 - 00:42:47.490, Speaker B: You're just trying to get that profit, maybe you slight bit of profit and then leave some as a moon bag in each project and then you just end up with ten projects a day where you got a small moon bag. Maybe you take a bit of a loss on some, so you have to take a smaller moon bag on others. And you're looking at socials, you're looking at stats, you're looking at how many people are actually typing in the discord. I'm not doing that. I don't really have the time and I'm kind of over it. It was fun, but burnout happens, and not individually, but sort of as a community. You see people are a bit like, well, we've been minting for so long now it's been 84 years and you're done minting.
00:42:47.490 - 00:43:46.930, Speaker B: You want a stronger project. So that's when from mint it's quite hard to see a strong project because everyone's going to say they're going to do the right thing. You don't want to hear what they say, you want to see what they do. And when all they've done is sell the project, it's hard to figure that out. So if you're looking for long term picks, you kind of want to wait a few days, a few weeks, maybe even months. Right now there's probably some good opportunity if you look back on any project before now, who is still actively building, and then look at how long they've been building and see how impressive you think that building is. What have they delivered? If they're still delivering from last year, that's probably a good project to look into.
00:43:46.930 - 00:44:31.342, Speaker B: And then you've got to look at how cheaply you can get in. Because price does matter. Just because a project is good doesn't mean the price is value. So it's really hard to sort of decide what price is value. You've kind of got to get this list of projects and go maybe even just rank them on how impressive you think the building is, or your confidence that the team will carry on, or your confidence that they'll make it. Compare that with other projects and sort of compare the numbers. So maybe you think one has an 80% chance and it's a two e floor, and then one has a 75% chance and it's a one e floor.
00:44:31.342 - 00:44:57.658, Speaker B: You pick the one e floor. One. Statistically, because it's only a 5% difference. At 75% to 80%, that's an insignificant 5%. It's not like you've gone from 5% to 10% and it's double. And at that level, you have to obviously make the decisions yourself. Because we've seen so many times on Twitter, people will say, oh, this is great.
00:44:57.658 - 00:45:42.454, Speaker B: I think this project is going to flip. Punks, apes, cool cats, whatever. And then you look at their account and they're selling into that hype that they've created. So maybe this is why it was kind of good to avoid Twitter in the early days, because we were somehow even shillier than now, and I guess everyone didn't see it. Whereas right now we have people out there just sort of saying, right, this is what I'm buying, and they'll tweet it out and then they'll dump it on the people who are buying, and it's obvious. And some people are smarter and they might buy of a different wallet. And then some people like me have moved on from the game.
00:45:42.454 - 00:46:39.354, Speaker B: And now I'll tell you to buy my own project. So I now work on one, and I feel like it's kind of fine to say buy mine because I want you to buy mine because I know I'm working hard on it, but someone else might say, bet on it because of me, which that's sort of fine to say, but you never really know people's intentions on Twitter. So you need to come up with your sort of own way that you believe in. Just really look at a project and say, I believe they make it this percent. Look at the floor, compare your percentages. And I guess that's how I would look for value. Right now, I don't really have the time to, so I sort of let them make it a bit and then I'll buy in, but I will see a line.
00:46:39.354 - 00:48:09.180, Speaker B: So I don't currently hold a board ape just because that's 30 ethereum. It's not an insignificant amount of money to me. That would be a big investment, and I don't feel like I have the time to benefit from the community of the board apes. However, I had said on a Twitter post a few days ago, someone put a poll up of if you were never allowed to sell your NFT and you were only ever allowed to own one, what would you buy? And I said I would buy a board ape over a punk right now because I feel if I'm not allowed to sell it, I would gain more from my board ape than my punk over time. So it really depends on your motivations, why you want to buy it and how much you believe in that team delivering and where they're going. So some teams have potential to pixel vault, have brought in so much ethereum that the sky is really the limit with what they can do. And then you have to try to think, right, what's the chances that they hit this game that does this percent? What's their floor at currently? Okay, where do I think it will go? Okay, plug all of that in, compare it to something else.
00:48:09.180 - 00:48:56.262, Speaker B: Compare it to board ape, this floor. They're trying to do this. I think they're going to have this percent chance because they also have a big amount of ethereum they're sitting on. Or maybe we think they sold it fiat. We don't really see these things with the projects. So I hate to say it depends and it's up to the individuals themselves, but hopefully by saying how I would work it out, our percentages will differ. And you do have to just end up trusting your gut and hoping that you're right and knowing that you will buy the wrong thing.
00:48:56.262 - 00:49:47.314, Speaker B: I have bought so many wrong things that are now absolutely nothing. I invested in one game that I think it was 2018. You bought it. I put one ethereum in and I got a certain amount of tokens and it died, went to zero. And now all it does is haunt me because that token went on to become a top 200 token. Like the token just went out of existence or whatever, and someone else has picked up the ticker. So now whenever I plug in my wallet to a new tax checker that will try and figure it out for me because they're all equally terrible, it will instantly give me like 3 billion pounds of this token because I have so much of a token that is now a top 200 token, but it isn't.
00:49:47.314 - 00:50:06.878, Speaker B: So it just gives me fake numbers and just haunts me that I wasted so much money on a game that never, ever existed. I think most people who have been in four years have probably missed more than they've hit and they're all doing well. So just something to think about.
00:50:07.044 - 00:50:39.740, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's part of the journey. I don't think there is any person who has been active in the space and has done zero mistakes and doesn't have big regrets about different projects they aped into. I think it's just part of the journey. It's natural and it happens. There's nothing wrong about it. I think what I'll do is I'll give you a chance to talk about your project because you mentioned it. And then if you have time, we can have few people over to come and ask a few questions before we wrap it up.
00:50:39.740 - 00:50:43.180, Speaker A: What do you think about that? Would that work?
00:50:43.950 - 00:50:49.580, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. I'm obviously very passionate about my own project.
00:50:51.970 - 00:50:53.360, Speaker A: Let's hear about it.
00:50:54.050 - 00:52:04.514, Speaker B: Okay. Well, at the start of the year, with pranks, he started NFT boxes, which was sort of, I described it as a geek box. So in, I don't know, real life don't really like saying that too much, but in real life, it's like a subscription service where you get sent a box and it would have different sort of air quote geeky stuff in it, like a doctor who sort of model or a key ring from Star wars or something like that. And it was kind of like that, but with NFTs, where we would work with artists and put their NFTs inside a, bundle it up into a box and sell that in one go. And the goal was to get everything sort of as on chain as possible, and the artists were automatically paid. And it was great fun. It was three months of just constantly working every day as hard as I could.
00:52:04.514 - 00:52:51.986, Speaker B: And after flipping nfts for three years, I just sort of got hooked into actually building something of substance. Like people liked what we were putting out, people wanted these things. And it wasn't just people who were trying to flip for a profit. And I guess I got the builder's bug at that point and I wanted to really build out what we had, bring in people and sort of build it up. But myself and pranksy were 50% owners each of the business and we didn't really agree on the direction and we were sort of pulling either way. And it was just to the detriment of NFT boxes. So I offered to sell my shares in the business to him and move on.
00:52:51.986 - 00:54:08.940, Speaker B: And because we'd set up as a company in the UK, which again is probably what a good thing to look at. If you can find an NFT project that's set up as a company, you can be more sure that they're here to stick around, because it was a company. It took so long to do this sale. We had to get it valued, we had to get the accountants in, we had to get so much sort of legal advice just to sell the business from someone who owned 50% to someone who owned 50%. It was a long process and I missed sort of building during that time. And I'd asked some people if they wanted to work with me at NFT boxes and then they couldn't. And I said, hey, you guys wanted to work here, why don't you work with me on something else? So we sort of spitballed what we wanted to do, and the goal was something that we would enjoy doing, that we could see ourselves sticking around doing, that we could build out and that people would want and it would help them.
00:54:08.940 - 00:54:42.850, Speaker B: Board apes weren't where they are now at the time. They were maybe too ethereum, but even then you were seeing board apes have changed my life. This is great, I love it. This is my forever ape, all of that. And we wanted that. We wanted people to be having their lives changed through something that we've done. And we sort of sat down in a pub trying to work out, right, what are we actually going to do? And I said earlier about meta and how nfts go through meta.
00:54:42.850 - 00:56:08.260, Speaker B: We stuck to the launch meta 10,000, it was 0.08 e we just stuck to what was we did what you did to sell out that then gave us funds to build. And the key part of the project is the Kitty bank, which is a collection, a wallet of nfts that we bought from our original sale and are sort of linked to your cat. And that kitty bank has now gone over the value of our original sale. So the kitty bank is worth more than the 800 Ethereum that we took in, which we're very happy with just because it shows that isn't our wallet, that's the community's wallet, which they can gain via the nfts that they get. So that kitty wallet is Kitty bank is going to be fractionalized into 100,000 pieces, and each one is going to be inside an NFT that is either your cat, there'll be 10,000 cats and 80,000 airdrops because we will airdrop one NFT a month to each 10,000 cats for eight months. And that sort of ties everything together.
00:56:08.260 - 00:56:54.526, Speaker B: What I tried to avoid was the board ape kennel club, which up to now has had zero utility. No one uses a profile picture and you can't do anything with. I know they're going to build it out and they now have funds to do a lot with that. But when we were working on sort of building up our project, I wanted to make sure that almost every NFT had its purpose. So these eight airdrops have the Kitty bank token inside it. And I am now allowed to say that legal is currently signing off on it. I've had sort of typed confirmation and we're working to properly launch these tokens.
00:56:54.526 - 00:57:37.434, Speaker B: We do have another token coming as well. But this token, the kitty bank token, could potentially, by some people, be seen as a fund. So that's what we've been trying to work around, avoiding and making sure that we're dotting the I's and crossing the t's. We're not just launching this and saying, this is what it is, we're launching it and properly doing it. And I have to set up a business that just manages the kitty. So the Kitty bank is almost like your NFT is backed by nfTs. So I like to say back when money was backed by the gold standard, the goal is that you don't actually claim your kitty bank token.
00:57:37.434 - 00:58:23.038, Speaker B: You never would go into the bank and say, here's a dollar, give me a dollar of gold. Like just no one did that, but they knew that they could. So the goal is that the kitty bank sort of becomes the NFT standard, not the gold standard, the NFT standard, where it doesn't really matter what the floor is, because at any time people can drop that floor and it gets lower and lower and lower. What we have is a real floor. Most projects real floor is zero. There's literally nothing backing most NFT projects. Whereas we currently have a kitty bank worth over 800 Ethereum that we're trying to grow secondary revenue goes into it more than we get.
00:58:23.038 - 00:58:59.900, Speaker B: In fact goes into it more than we get as the team and the NFTs in it. Hopefully if we're bullish on the space, only grow as well. And that is I guess the very core of the project with so many other layers. We've got the profile picture community that we're trying to build out. I've been hiring people left, right and center to be involved in helping build out the community. I'm looking for someone to help build out the IP. We're looking to put out sort of an animated video.
00:58:59.900 - 00:59:53.062, Speaker B: We've been working with Iky to. Let me just check it is this. Our first airdrop was a hoodie that has an NFT attached that can't be sold itself. So it links a physical to the NFT world. So anyone that has that physical has the NFT which means we know we could have a section on our site that anyone with that physical hoodie could access. Or maybe there's like, let's say we do a hundred million board ape sort of style sale and we have our own clubhouse. What if there's a vip section that you can only access with this NFT? We're still in a very early stage of not just NFTs but physical meets nfTs.
00:59:53.062 - 01:00:42.220, Speaker B: So the things that we can actually do there are only growing and we'll learn from other projects and we're seeing other projects learn from us having their own kitty bank like things going. And basically I'm exploring everything. We started as a profile picture project because that was how you could sell. That was how you would sell when we sold. And now I'm just trying to build it into a community that people will desire to be in. They'll be rewarded to be in with IP, with games, with access, with education. Anything that's thrown my way I'll consider.
01:00:42.220 - 01:01:38.726, Speaker B: I might drop a picture alpha that I was sent today right now into the Penelope's discord general that I'm pretty hyped about. It's a figurine that we're having made where people will be airdropped a token and they can claim this. They will give up their kitty bank tokens for it. And we're trying to get this NFT token inside it as well so that we can know that someone has this physical and they haven't sold it and that could also give them access. Maybe if you have all the physicals you can have access. There's just so many different things that you can do that as the space grows, we're looking to add. So the next big step, I think, is going to be these staking tokens where you stake your NFT and you get a token.
01:01:38.726 - 01:02:34.190, Speaker B: But the difference is instead of focusing on giving your rewards to whoever has your original NFT, you allow people to use this token that their original NFt yields to get the rewards. So you use it as a utility token that people are rewarded to get by holding your NFT. But it means they can be rewarded without having to leave the community. So lots of projects are trying. I'm fairly skeptical on how many are launching legally, and the legal advice I've been given is if you buy into one of those projects, you're not going to be in trouble, but the people who launch them could be, and that would then tank the price of your NFT. So if you see it as an investment.
01:02:36.050 - 01:02:40.094, Speaker A: It can be considered as a security token. That's what you mean, right?
01:02:40.212 - 01:02:52.740, Speaker B: From that perspective, not even that far. Just if they launch a token, doesn't really matter what it is if they haven't launched it properly. So even before it's considered a security, it could be an issue.
01:02:53.510 - 01:03:41.220, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's the beauty of the space. You're looking at so many elements in your project, and the more the space develops, there are so many new opportunities and ways to develop it even further. So, yeah, I encourage everyone to have a look at it and get more details, just to sort of remind everyone. This is the Niftyfi official Twitter spaces. We're going to do them on a weekly basis. For those of you who don't know, Niftify is a platform where you can get a cryptocurrency loan on your nfts, or you can offer loans to others against their nfts. So you can go ahead and check the link on our profile and join our discord at discord niftify.com
01:03:41.220 - 01:04:09.910, Speaker A: join and ask any questions or talk to our community members and the team. So you're more than welcome to come and join us and we would love to talk to you about what we do. So, yeah, I'll just get loftus over because he had requested to come up and ask your questions. It's quite a bit and has been patiently waiting. So let's see if he. Hello there. Welcome.
01:04:09.910 - 01:04:18.910, Speaker A: How are you doing? You have to unmute yourself. Hello.
01:04:25.660 - 01:04:27.130, Speaker B: May have walked away.
01:04:28.640 - 01:05:05.400, Speaker A: I think he lost hope that we would put him on. Probably, yeah. If anyone else has any questions and would like to request to come up, just send me a request and I'll put you up. Feel free to send a request. And love to. If you hear us, you can unmute yourself and ask your question. Okay.
01:05:13.300 - 01:06:12.384, Speaker B: Hey, how's it going, guys? This is toner, and I'm fairly new to the NFT space since about April or March. And I just wanted to know back in the crypto kitty days who were considered the know, that term wasn't thrown around at all because you can't really have an OG in a space that's been born right in front of you. But there were, I guess, I don't know how to phrase it. That doesn't sound cringe, really. Community leaders, people, those looked up to. There was sort of slightly after cryptokitties, there was the ox seven whale. Which ox seven start of their wallet.
01:06:12.384 - 01:06:54.880, Speaker B: And at the time, the levels they were buying into all of these ponzies, they basically saved everyone in the space. They kept the space alive because they would always buy in last. If ox seven was buying in, you'd know you're moving on because they were buying the bag at the end. And the percentage of the market that they were spending know it was the equivalent of Vincent van Doe plus Snoop Dogg plus add up all the whales. Now add up all the whales. And that was the percentage of the market that they were. They were the whale.
01:06:54.880 - 01:08:16.280, Speaker B: And then a bit later on, Coco joined and cocoa was an early whale, an ox seven was kitten mittens, who happens to be someone with, I don't even 600,000 nfts maybe now a crazy amount. But when you think back to those times and who was sort of the people that were looked up to and active, say, at the end of 2017, it would be Jimmy, Alan, a couple of the mods at the time, probably someone who hasn't been heard of, called Derpy psych out and jihas have you actually say his name with your mouth. They went off to do Axie, but they were very active in the space and had sort of like a following. Like I said, I was the second highest breeder at the time. So I think Alan had coined me HMS Carlini eight because he clung to my ship. He would buy my scraps back in the day. Mm.
01:08:16.280 - 01:09:05.196, Speaker B: From this podcast, NFTFI was active in the space freak, who I believe went on to Axie Alexo, who's now big in Topshot. Papa CK was probably the biggest. Papa was sort of a legend. He created a plugin that made the game way more incredibly, incredibly more playable. And I'd say he's like the only one who hasn't really gone on to stay in the space. He's still around, but I don't know what he's doing. Go west, BTC Derek, I think these were mainly the big guys.
01:09:05.196 - 01:09:33.920, Speaker B: Thank you very much for that. But is it possible for you to speak about how the communities collaborated and then what platforms were specifically in use? Everyone knows of Opensea, but now we've got other chains and things like that. Thanks. Google Docs. My for wallet Discord, that was pretty much it. It was ethereum. There was no consideration of other chains.
01:09:33.920 - 01:10:26.550, Speaker B: I don't think they even had nfts or if they did, no one knew about them. So it was all run through discord. Cryptdies website collabs happened on Google Docs and if you wanted to do anything sort of remotely interact with a contract, you go to Myifa Wallet for that. And there wasn't really anything else. Collabs were chatting in the discord. I know most art seems to be what gets a lot of people in, but this was pre, I don't want to say pre art, but it was pre NfT art sort of being in any way popular. So there are 60,000 people in the space.
01:10:26.550 - 01:10:44.830, Speaker B: They're all in cryptokitties. And looking back, there were some people in art, but you're looking at less than 500, probably less than 100, maybe less than 50 in comparison to. It was collectibles. Nfts were collectibles at that point.
01:10:46.240 - 01:10:46.556, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:10:46.578 - 01:11:10.950, Speaker B: I'd heard them called digital wallet avatars. Yeah, lots of weird things. Back when we were still trying to figure out what was really going on and what we were and what we were going to be. And some people have really come in and sort of taken that mantle and gone, you know what, we're going to be called this and we're going to do it this way.
01:11:13.160 - 01:11:30.730, Speaker A: Okay, I think I'm going to butcher your name. I'm sorry about it in advance, but I think Zelther his. Yeah, he has his on top. So you can talk, you can ask your question.
01:11:33.100 - 01:11:33.850, Speaker C: Yes.
01:11:37.820 - 01:11:38.728, Speaker A: Go ahead.
01:11:38.894 - 01:11:56.460, Speaker C: The earliest, I like to use sort of means from dot who twice, he who twice, so I guess pronounces dot twice.
01:11:56.760 - 01:11:59.940, Speaker B: It Zolt tries.
01:12:00.360 - 01:12:28.540, Speaker C: Yes. And about the NFT Phi loans don't have to be a specific floor level one of the developer meeting that only projects above a 1.5 floor are able to be used for loans.
01:12:34.640 - 01:12:43.730, Speaker A: Can you repeat the question? I think you're chopping something is with your connection. I couldn't really hear the question. Could you try to repeat it, please.
01:12:44.980 - 01:13:01.780, Speaker C: Yes. Well, one of the other, I think, admins said that only projects with above a 1.5 ethereum floor are able to be used as collateral.
01:13:03.740 - 01:13:55.530, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, got it. So you're asking about niftify loans and NFT collaterals, right? Nifty NFT projects that you can use as collaterals are those projects that have been whitelisted on the platform. And we are whitelisting projects every week. So the community usually proposes the projects that they would like to be listed and there is a process that they go through and there is a form that we fill out. And also the team looks at the projects as well, proactively based on different criteria. So if you join the Discord channel and go to the list, you're more than welcome to propose few projects and we'll make sure that we look at them.
01:13:55.980 - 01:14:02.040, Speaker C: I did propose a project, but the problem is it didn't appear in the Trello.
01:14:03.520 - 01:14:04.364, Speaker A: It isn't what?
01:14:04.402 - 01:14:10.700, Speaker C: Sorry, I did propose a project, but it didn't appear in the Trello.
01:14:12.480 - 01:14:15.180, Speaker A: It doesn't appear in the Trello.
01:14:15.840 - 01:14:18.380, Speaker C: Yes, not in the pending.
01:14:18.960 - 01:14:29.090, Speaker A: Okay, I see. If you come back to the Discord channel and just remind us about it, we will have a look and see why it doesn't show up in the Trello. Okay.
01:14:29.640 - 01:14:32.310, Speaker B: Yes, thank you.
01:14:33.080 - 01:15:03.756, Speaker A: No worries. Thank you. I'll just want to check. Lovetus, are you still around or not? If. No, if anyone else would like to come up, I think we'll just take two more questions, maybe Carlini, and then probably it's getting quite late, so we will be slowly wrapping it up. So whoever has any questions.
01:15:03.938 - 01:15:05.150, Speaker B: Sorry, I'm here.
01:15:06.080 - 01:15:07.544, Speaker A: Okay, Carlin, go ahead.
01:15:07.602 - 01:16:17.024, Speaker B: Yeah, Carlini, just real quick. I know you've mentioned in the past about holding off on burning or redeeming the kitty bank tokens because it's just way too early in that process. Do you have any idea of when it might become a good idea for that? Or is that something that has to be wait until all of the tokens are distributed from the airdrops? Or how does that work? Well, currently we don't have that functionality purely because of what happened with our board ape. We fractionalized a board ape before mutants, and we didn't end up getting our serum. It was automatically burnt because it was in a wallet that couldn't accept another NFT in its fractionalized form. So that sort of made me think a bit about all the other options that are out there. And we're seeing right now with these tokens so we've got two Genesis kongs.
01:16:17.024 - 01:17:01.472, Speaker B: If we fractionalize the wallet right now, we're fractional. It doesn't have the ability to give us those bananas, or if another token starts yielding, or someone. I'm quite surprised no one's added a token for punks. I think you could probably have quite an elite level token that you just launched if you think lute and loot gold that sort of way for punks. And we've got a punk, so if that was to come out, we wouldn't be able to stake for the yield either. So we're sort of waiting for the ability to properly fractionalize. And then also we're waiting on the sign off from legal.
01:17:01.472 - 01:17:45.456, Speaker B: But as of today, that's getting even closer. We're not yet incentivizing anyone to burn. So as it is right now, you should, in theory, never want to burn your token, because the value of your NFT should always be above the value of the token. So the token is inside the NFT, and if the token is worth ten, your NFT should be worth more than ten. Whatever ten is, there's just no reason for it to drop below. So it's not even like the NFTX pool and the floor where they sort of move together. This should just be, the NFT will never go below that.
01:17:45.456 - 01:18:50.260, Speaker B: And there could be times when maybe one of the NFTs in the wallet jumps, for whatever reason, something is announced and it doubles in the span of a few hours. And maybe there's an arbitrage opportunity and people want to burn their nfts. We will probably in the future add incentives to make people want to burn. So maybe you'll get your kitty bank tokens if you burn, but also you'll get this that we can provide. So we do want to incentivize people to do it, but in theory, in its current form, if the market was perfect, the kitty bank would work by raising the floor of the NFT rather than you wanting to burn it at any point. But we are thinking about ways to make it worthwhile on a sort of permanent basis. We want to avoid short term windows as much as possible, because right now you just can't keep up.
01:18:50.260 - 01:19:32.048, Speaker B: This is just too many things, I think. I've got dream loops and I just missed a mint for their whatever. And on different wallets I've got trolls and I could mint record a music NFT, and I don't know if I can still do that. I'm not in all of the projects, so people that are in all of the projects. I don't know how they're keeping up. And that's why we're putting out videos and we're putting out a weekly update video just to try and keep people up on the space. But I guess our project, in theory it should work by upping the floor of the NFT.
01:19:32.048 - 01:20:10.896, Speaker B: But we will be looking to incentivize burning further down the line when we're more, I guess, settled. Right now we're just working to keep our promises. So we've said we will deliver an NFT every month and that's easy. But I want it to be good. I don't just want to drop an NFT, I want there to be a purpose. So I'm constantly currently working, trying to build up all of these purposes and now I'm trying to constantly work on our staking token and how that can come in. But yeah, we will incentivize it.
01:20:10.896 - 01:20:23.280, Speaker B: But right now, how it is, you probably shouldn't be thinking about burning. Sounds good. I appreciate it. Cool, thanks.
01:20:24.610 - 01:20:45.060, Speaker A: Okay, well, I would like to thank you so much for your time and everyone else who stuck around during the whole period and listened to our conversation. Thank you very much for your time and attention, everyone. And thank you Carlini for sharing your stories and insights. It was very interesting. Thank you very much.
01:20:46.170 - 01:20:48.166, Speaker B: No problem. Thanks for having me on.
01:20:48.348 - 01:21:21.038, Speaker A: Okay, awesome. Thank you. So everyone, thanks a lot again for tuning in and we will notify you about the upcoming spaces happening next week. So hopefully see you there. Meanwhile, check us out@mistfi.com and make sure you join our Discord channel because there you can have more thorough conversations and talk about what we do. Because these spaces are not the place where we would like to sort of concentrate on the product itself.
01:21:21.038 - 01:21:48.486, Speaker A: We'd rather have really nice conversations about the space and cover topics that you might be interested about. Everything else related to what we do. Obviously our website and Discord channel are the places where we have the full purpose and you will get all the information. So hopefully that would be enough. Okay, that's it. So everyone have a great weekend. Thank you very much for everything and we'll see you in the next week.
01:21:48.486 - 01:21:49.330, Speaker A: Bye.
01:21:49.490 - 01:21:50.210, Speaker B: Happy Friday.
