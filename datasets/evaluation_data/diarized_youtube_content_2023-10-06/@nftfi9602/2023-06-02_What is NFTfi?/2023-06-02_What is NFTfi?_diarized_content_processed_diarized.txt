00:00:00.730 - 00:00:40.570, Speaker A: What is niftify? Niftify allows you to use your nfts to get a crypto loan. It is safe, secure and anonymous. NFT holders can borrow wrapped ether, USDC, or Dai by using their nfts as collateral in exchange for loans provided by lenders in a peer to peer fashion. Let's walk through the entire process. A borrower comes to niftify and lists an NFT specifying the loan terms. Lenders then start placing loan offers. Once the borrower accepts a suitable loan offer, their NFT goes into an escrow smart contract and the loan amount is transferred from the lender to the borrower.
00:00:40.570 - 00:01:20.882, Speaker A: When this happens, the loan duration starts and the borrower has two options. The borrower can repay the loan, but in case of failure to do so, the loan will default. Let's look at the repayment process first. The borrower must return the loan amount plus interest as specified in the loan terms. Once repayment is complete, the NFT is immediately returned to the borrower. If the borrower is unable to repay on time, the lender can foreclose on the loan and the collateral is transferred to the lender. This is the most basic and simple explanation of how niftify enables NFT lending.
