00:00:50.050 - 00:01:38.260, Speaker A: It. All right, guys, we're going to get this party started and kick it off a little bit. We say this every time, but we really got to get some background music in here or something for the warm up. Next time, next time, I promise. Welcome back, everybody, to another nifty fi community call. We've all missed you since the last one. I've missed you personally since I've been traveling abroad.
00:01:38.260 - 00:02:10.624, Speaker A: Before we get started, just going to say we have a few reasons that we do these calls in the first place. And that's to update you guys on what we've been up to since the last community call to give you guys a bit of an update on what's going to happen towards the next community call. And of course, to connect with all of you, listen to your suggestions and get any feedback. Let's get some updates because you know that that's probably my favorite part. And I'll share a little personal anecdote with you guys. So when I was growing up, age reveal. Coming up.
00:02:10.624 - 00:02:45.484, Speaker A: There used to be a show on a channel in the US called Nickelodeon. And the show is called Global guts. It was a bunch of teenagers doing these weird, outlandish invented sports. But every so often the host would point at this chick and he would say, let's go to the scoreboard, mo. And that's how I feel every time I say the following. Let's go to the stats. SJ, what do you got for us? Sorry, I'll give her a cue again.
00:02:45.602 - 00:02:47.150, Speaker B: Sorry, I'm trying to record.
00:02:48.160 - 00:02:49.036, Speaker C: I'll set you up again.
00:02:49.058 - 00:02:49.740, Speaker A: You ready?
00:02:49.890 - 00:02:50.360, Speaker B: Yes.
00:02:50.450 - 00:02:51.756, Speaker A: Let's go to the staff.
00:02:51.868 - 00:03:00.896, Speaker B: SJ, let me share my screen. 1 second. I'm having technical difficulties trying to record.
00:03:00.998 - 00:03:05.940, Speaker C: This is the best intro I've heard on any community call ever. You left him hanging.
00:03:08.200 - 00:03:10.790, Speaker B: Okay. Can you see my screen?
00:03:14.760 - 00:03:27.776, Speaker A: Yes, it is. Yes, we can. Everybody. If you click on SJ, the top left where it says live under the call voice channel, that'll load the share screen for you. Go ahead, SJ.
00:03:27.908 - 00:03:51.260, Speaker B: Cool. So update on stats up to today. So total loans to date is 2252 and total loan volume we're nearing on 30 million. So we're on 28.9 million in loan volume. Total completed loans is 1857. So that means loans either repaid or defaulted.
00:03:51.260 - 00:04:10.952, Speaker B: Total completed volume is 18.6 million. Unique lenders to date is 330 and unique borrowers is 478. So our loan volume this month. So last month we closed on 8.5 or 8.6 million this month we're ready on 6.8
00:04:10.952 - 00:04:35.504, Speaker B: million. And it looks like if I normalize it to the rest of the month, it looks like we all beat last month. At one stage it looked like we were going to hit 10 million but I think we may hit 9 million this month. So fingers crossed. The average loan size is the highest it's been for a while. So we're on 22,000 for this month. As you can see it's obviously higher than any other month.
00:04:35.504 - 00:05:01.660, Speaker B: So let's see if it stays the highest for this month. Our loan count again we are on 309 for this month. If I normalize it it looks like we'll hit 400. So we might be a bit lower than last month. But I think the loan volume per loan is a lot higher this month. Then this is the total loans. Whether they were in die or wef and currently in die.
00:05:01.660 - 00:05:21.544, Speaker B: We own 1.2 and we own around 800 Ethan loans for this month. Unique lenders and borrowers. So we getting there almost the same as last month. We creeping up so hopefully we'll match last month as well. Last month was the best month yet. And then I've got some more info.
00:05:21.544 - 00:05:58.844, Speaker B: So our top lender is now on 4 million in loan volume and their first ever loan was last month on the 11 October. So since the 11 October they've done 230 loans, earned themselves $209,000 in interest and done 4 million in loan volume. The next highest first loan was on the eigth of July and their loan volume is 2.1 million and they've earned $48,000 and done 132. And the third highest is. Their first loan is on the 2 September. They've done 1.7
00:05:58.844 - 00:06:26.164, Speaker B: million in loans, earned themselves 168,000 and done 49 loans to date. Our top borrowers. There we go. Our top borrowers first loan was in May this year. They've loaned to date 2.4 million and they've only paid 62,000 in interest and done 135 loans. Our next highest borrower started in June this year and they've done 1.8
00:06:26.164 - 00:06:49.996, Speaker B: million and only paid eleven k in interest. So that one's doing really well for themselves. And done 23 loans. Then our third highest is 1.1 million starting in August this year and paying twenty one k in interest. Also doing 23 loans to date. And then I know there were some questions last month on defaulted loans so I thought I'd do the highest ones.
00:06:49.996 - 00:07:32.232, Speaker B: I pulled off the highest defaults for to date. So the highest project is art blocks with 52 loans and $689,000 worth of defaults. Their highest loan that was defaulted was $7,000. The next highest was async art with only one loan, but it was obviously a high value loan. At 200k. We've had three v friends defaults, a total value of 89, and the highest default was $41,000.19. Hash masks at total value of highest one was 14,000 and then 25.
00:07:32.232 - 00:07:43.790, Speaker B: Decentraland total value was 67,000 and the highest loan there was 4.5. And that's all from me. Elad, back to you, unless there's any questions.
00:07:48.850 - 00:07:57.540, Speaker A: I've got an interesting question, actually. So do you happen to know if the defaulted loans were in wrapped eth or.
00:07:57.910 - 00:08:02.020, Speaker B: Oh, it's something I'll be able to pull off. I'll add it to the list for next month.
00:08:02.630 - 00:08:10.934, Speaker A: All right. I'm just curious if it had to do with the fluctuation in the EtH price or not. I'm curious about that.
00:08:11.052 - 00:08:11.686, Speaker B: Good question.
00:08:11.788 - 00:08:14.326, Speaker A: Steven, you got any knowledge about that or something?
00:08:14.508 - 00:08:24.442, Speaker B: I can actually have a look quickly. Are there any other questions that I can answer while I'm looking? Are there any other questions?
00:08:24.576 - 00:08:36.034, Speaker A: Let's see. I don't see any other questions, but interesting comment from Arad, who is apparently trying to talk but his mic isn't working. Says that ten minutes ago there was another r block default of six east.
00:08:36.102 - 00:09:03.350, Speaker B: Yes, I just saw that, but I'd already pulled my stats. I'm sorry. I saw it after I pulled them. Let me tell you, most of them on ETH, it looks like. So we've got 47 defaulted loans in Dai and 271 in ETH.
00:09:05.130 - 00:09:23.534, Speaker A: Interesting. Very interesting. Thanks for that, SJ. I think Danny Sim might have a question. You want to unmute yourself? Danny Sound, if you want to unmute yourself and ask your question, is it in the chat?
00:09:23.582 - 00:09:25.540, Speaker D: Yo, yo, yo, can you hear me?
00:09:25.910 - 00:09:28.120, Speaker A: Yeah, we. What's up? Welcome.
00:09:29.610 - 00:09:35.640, Speaker D: Listen, how's it, my fellow South Africans? How are we doing, man? Anybody else?
00:09:36.010 - 00:09:37.750, Speaker A: We got an infiltrator.
00:09:38.730 - 00:09:40.200, Speaker C: Hey, how's it going?
00:09:40.830 - 00:10:15.934, Speaker D: Oh, man, I got to tell you, you guys have changed the game for me. Seriously. I'm so happy that I was brave enough to jump in with both feet into NFT Phi, as strawberry knows, because he was the first one to welcome me in the discord. My main concern was putting these high value assets on this contract out of my wallet, and I couldn't be happier. It's changed the game for me. I've had a good run. And to all those who might be listening and thinking about putting their assets up for lending I mean, I couldn't be more pleased.
00:10:15.934 - 00:10:59.410, Speaker D: I do have a question, but congrats and thanks. And I've been trying to onboard, by the way, some OG friends and they're all very scared about putting their assets up. Just so you guys know, this may be one of your biggest barriers because I'm talking to people that have been in crypto for years. They've been in NFT for a year already, since last year, cryptopunk owners. And they think I'm nuts to put my assets in some NFT five wallet. Having said that, my question is, I'm not a tech guy, so it might sound a little bit naive the way I'm asking the question, but as far as I'm understood, there's going to be a version two. In version two, there's going to be a few things that will change.
00:10:59.410 - 00:11:42.526, Speaker D: For example, we'll have larger, we'll be able to lend for more than 90 days. As far as I've understood, it can be any amount of days that the two agree upon. So as far as I've understood, there's a v two. What happens to what's going on in version one right now? Is it better, safer for me to just pay back my loans, get my assets back into my wallet, wait for v two, and then eventually create another lending mechanism or. I'm very scared about my punk going from one contract to another. So give me some dates and what's going to happen so I can plan exactly how I'll transfer from one to the other.
00:11:42.708 - 00:11:43.502, Speaker B: Good question.
00:11:43.556 - 00:11:49.380, Speaker C: Okay, cool. Yeah, that's a really good question. I'll take that SJ, if you're okay with that.
00:11:49.830 - 00:11:52.034, Speaker A: That was a Steven question if I've ever heard one.
00:11:52.072 - 00:11:54.610, Speaker B: Yeah, I was just about to hand it over to Steven.
00:11:59.210 - 00:12:39.090, Speaker C: It's a very good question. And then the way that we've designed the system is that what will happen is all loans that were started under v one will complete under v one. So no migrating of loans, no kind of risk to any existing assets that are in there. We'll have the old contracts live. We'll have the new contracts live. Any loans that have started before the switch over date will complete on V one. That's part of the reason we also didn't want to do long term loans just yet, just because we didn't want to get stuck with 18 month loan on v one when we knew v two was coming around the corner.
00:12:39.090 - 00:13:33.474, Speaker C: So the v one loans will complete as is. The front end will then switch over after a specific date. All new loans would then go on V two, and then eventually, once all of the V one loans have completed successfully, we will lock the existing contract, which will mean no new loans can go through there. So we'll just basically pause it. But anything that was existing in the system will still be able to complete, so there's no risk to any existing assets. If you do want to do a longer term loan, you'd have to wait until then, and then things like being able to renegotiate. And a lot of those features won't automatically retroactively apply to any loans for started under v one.
00:13:33.474 - 00:14:02.330, Speaker C: So you'll only be able to use those features if your loan was a v two loan. And then we also have rollback plans and all those kind of things to make sure there's no issues. We're doing very extensive testing to make sure everything is up to speed. We've got one audit report back already. We're doing another audit from a second auditing firm. So we'll have audit reports for that too. So, yeah, I hope that answers your question, Danny.
00:14:04.770 - 00:14:25.714, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely. Great news. I wrote it in the chat. This is exactly what I wanted to hear. And Stephen, I think it might be good to know. I don't know exactly what I'm suggesting here, but like I said, I know some people that they got great assets. They need liquidity, and they're too afraid to even look into nifty Phi, even though I'm vouching for it.
00:14:25.714 - 00:14:36.840, Speaker D: So I'm thinking maybe a few more spaces around this topic, maybe even me and you just going back and forth. And I try and get these friends of mine coming in and listening to us talk about it, but.
00:14:39.770 - 00:15:05.460, Speaker C: To answer questions directly from them. Yeah, more than happy to do that. It's definitely something that people need to, kind of need to understand a little bit what happens technically to kind of be secure, that we can just run off with your assets. So we also are working on kind of better documentation around that, just on the website so that it doesn't require so much explanation from you.
00:15:06.630 - 00:15:08.354, Speaker A: I'll just add one more.
00:15:08.552 - 00:15:44.640, Speaker D: Maybe also, like your prmarketing team, maybe like some testimonials, like just cheesy. Like I just lent my punk and I then made two x with the weath and I don't know, just to kind of get the word out there, because I'm guessing that you've got more people willing to lend than those willing to put up high value assets. I could be wrong, and maybe it's tilted the other way, but I'm not going to be lending money to anybody, I'm just putting up my assets. But enough said and I see you're on it. I'll also dm you and maybe just get a schedule together for that spaces. But first let me talk to all my buddies and see when's a good time.
00:15:46.610 - 00:15:47.360, Speaker E: Thanks.
00:15:48.130 - 00:16:39.054, Speaker A: Yeah, Danny son, don't forget also that let's learn from our experience together. If you manage to bring them into the community, I'm sure we can set their minds at ease a little bit. Joining the community has no risk and costs literally nothing. And there are plenty of people here that will be happy to help and give those testimonials here live until we do something more official with it later. But in addition to that, don't forget the beauty of blockchain, right? That things are on chain and everything is pseudo anonymous but still transparent. Meaning that anybody can just show if they're willing to, of course, that their assets went into the smart contract successfully and back from the smart contract successfully. And it's very easy to prove that people are using this and that they're enjoying the benefits.
00:16:39.054 - 00:16:40.830, Speaker A: But thanks for your great comments.
00:16:41.730 - 00:16:43.374, Speaker D: Can I just respond to that?
00:16:43.492 - 00:16:44.898, Speaker A: Of course, yeah.
00:16:44.984 - 00:18:06.918, Speaker D: So you remember when I came into the discord, my most important concern was, but has it never happened? Has every single asset always, no matter how tiny, gone back to the original owner or to the lender because of a default on repayment? And I insisted and then I went to do my own research and once I figured, okay, I mean, I did my first loans with some smaller assets to do the whole mechanism and make sure, but then I leaped in with the bigger assets and I get what you said, maybe bring them into discord where I figured my stuff out. But I do think that somehow maybe NFTFI needs to do a little bit more promotion. A single asset has never been compromised. And that's what convinced me when I felt that that was being said to me and it was truthful and I tried to confirm with other sources, I was like, if not a single asset, and punks have been at the time I was considering loading my punk in and punks had been already in and out of the system, many of them. And I was like, hold on, if nothing has ever been compromised, then it's going to be very unfortunate for me to be the first person. And I'm not very convinced that that comes across in your communications, but I get your point, I'll try to get them into discord. But as you know, many people are in too many discords.
00:18:06.918 - 00:18:08.970, Speaker D: So it's not the easiest on Ram.
00:18:09.790 - 00:18:11.260, Speaker A: We will 100%.
00:18:13.070 - 00:18:28.370, Speaker C: I think the way that you phrase that, or like, just the fact that no assets ever been compromised out of however many loans we've done, I do think that's a very strong point, and I think it's definitely something that I think we can do a better job of explaining.
00:18:29.350 - 00:19:01.018, Speaker A: Yeah. And I'll also say that I'm sure it's something we'd love to consider adding and making stronger in our communications. But I have a feeling that in the end, whoever is conscious about it or suspicious or a little weary of it, then the best thing that's going to assuage them is just checking it for themselves. Right. And doing their own research. And whoever's going to come into the community, they're going to get the same tolerant, patient response that you received, which is basically, your concerns are legitimate. Let's help you check it together.
00:19:01.018 - 00:19:14.110, Speaker A: Right. That's what the blockchain is for. Partially. And yeah, when they're ready, right. With enough nurturing and care, they'll join our community of borrowers and or lenders. But an excellent point that you raised, and we really appreciate that.
00:19:14.260 - 00:19:20.260, Speaker D: Two quick things, Stephen. I'm trying to make a friend request so we can dm here. It doesn't allow me, so if you could.
00:19:21.350 - 00:19:24.290, Speaker C: I put that off. I was getting so many scam.
00:19:26.870 - 00:19:39.930, Speaker D: Thing. And the other is maybe to summarize, my whole concept is like once in a while there should be a tweet that just says this many days have passed, this many wheats has been lended zero assets compound.
00:19:41.950 - 00:19:45.930, Speaker A: Like a nuclear factory. There have been this many incident.
00:19:48.670 - 00:19:49.130, Speaker E: Because.
00:19:49.200 - 00:20:08.494, Speaker D: The number zero is very powerful number. It's the most beautiful number in math, in my opinion. And so you've got these two other numbers which are growing exponentially. Well, one is growing linearly, but the other one exponentially. And then the third number is always zero. So it's always know. And I do think that the early adopters in NFTFI have an edge.
00:20:08.494 - 00:20:37.674, Speaker D: This is what I've been trying to tell my friends, because I use the liquidity from NFTFI to get into Wolfgang, for example. So I've made that loan back and it's not even an issue. And I have friends who are scrambling to find liquidity by selling assets. And that's not as liquid as everybody. I think we have an edge. And this is your job to promote, in my opinion, and summarize my idea. You got it.
00:20:37.674 - 00:20:41.580, Speaker D: It's clear. And Steven will talk thanks.
00:20:42.190 - 00:20:43.740, Speaker C: Awesome. Cheers, man.
00:20:44.110 - 00:21:11.318, Speaker E: Can I add quickly, Danny, this is Jonathan. I also work with Niftify, so I think that was superb input. Thank you so much for that. One thing you just mentioned are testimonials, and I think if anybody would be open to give a testimonial, I think if you just ping us, we'd, I think, happily use that. I don't think we would be able to. We know many of you guys, obviously, but generally, we wouldn't have access to the identity of our users. Right, I understand.
00:21:11.318 - 00:21:14.520, Speaker E: So just ping us if you'd be open to that, I think.
00:21:16.490 - 00:21:17.560, Speaker A: Word up.
00:21:18.090 - 00:21:37.066, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, this conversation is being recorded, right? There you go. My testimonial is, you have my voice. Use it, make a video out of it. And, you know, I'm og in the community because of my pfps. So there you go. You can get the ape community, the punk community, the Pixelvolk.
00:21:37.066 - 00:22:03.400, Speaker D: I've got all these pfps that you guys can gel into. I'll even thank you because I get free market for my pfps, but it's a win win. You have the testimonial. Get a marketing person working. I'm not a marketing person, but get a little Gary Vee person working on this and get the content out there, because you've got the fucking amazing product. I mean, you did the hard part, and it's worked, and I'm happy, and lenders are happy.
00:22:04.730 - 00:22:23.014, Speaker E: Our Gary Vee person is called really like your. I like your idea as sort of a concept. I mean, your testimony will start right with that, but I think it could be a recurring thing. So I think that's a fantastic idea. Thanks so much for that input, gentlemen.
00:22:23.062 - 00:22:49.700, Speaker A: Thanks for your discussion. Sorry to be that guy, but I just want to push us forward a little bit so we can manage to get to everything that we have planned for today. All right, but thank you for everybody who just participated in that discussion. Stephen, let's go back to you for a second. We had some exciting funding announcements that I'm pretty sure everyone's been privy to, but why don't you remind everybody what that's been and tell us all how those resources have been put to good.
00:22:53.190 - 00:23:44.278, Speaker C: I mean, we spoke about it last time, so I don't want to kind of go over it too much. You Guys have all seen the funding announcement. Really, what this is giving us is Runway for at least two years, basically, meaning that no matter what the crypto markets do over the next two years, we can keep the current team going without having to ask anybody else for money and kind of keep building this product. And even if we start seeing like an NFT bear market, we're going to still be here because we're in for the long run. We started out when I think what crypto punks were, you could buy one for one ether, one and a half ether. So we saw the vision then, and like a 30% pullback is not going to scare us away. So we're in it for the long run.
00:23:44.278 - 00:24:36.706, Speaker C: And this capital kind of gives us the ability to ride those kind of times out without having to go scrambling for money. It also allows us to actually grow the team a little bit. In February this year, it was like me and strawberry, and at the moment we've got roughly 15 people working on the project full time. We're expanding on the front end side, too, so hiring two or three more full time front end developers and hopefully we can start pushing things further. And then the other thing is, these investors that we brought on weren't just kind of just crypto investors. A lot of these investors are very strategic for us. So, for example, reciprocal.
00:24:36.706 - 00:25:17.710, Speaker C: They're a VC based out of New York. But Michael, the person that we deal with there, he's a big art collector and his best friend is one of the largest private art advisors in the world. And he's actually also joined the cap table. So he's got a very deep experience in the art world and connections into the traditional art lending market, which is super useful for us. The other fund that kind of extends us outside of the crypto world is town ventures. So that's Ashton Kutcher and Guy Osseri. Guy is Madonna's manager, and he's also got the VC firm with Ashton.
00:25:17.710 - 00:25:54.850, Speaker C: And they're full on into nfds. So they've done a bunch of NFT investments and they're really trying to connect the entertainment world. And I think that's going to be a big growth area for NFTs going forward. And then we've got some funds investing in us out of Asia. I think we're going to see a lot of growth in the market in that. So really this kind of gives us a broader kind of investor base with connections into new industries that we see kind of growing. Another good example of that is Galaxy Interactive.
00:25:54.850 - 00:26:45.140, Speaker C: They are Galaxy Digital's gaming and metaverse kind of focused investment firms. So they've got a lot of deep connections in the gaming industry. So it was really strategic for us to kind of get people who know we had all of the top funds from the crypto space invested in our first round. And in this round we kind of expanded that out into all of the markets that are going to be growth markets for nfDs, I think in the next twelve to 24 months. That's it. We'll have more news for you guys on token launch plans in the new year. A lot of this money is also going to go towards doing that and getting that kind of up and running and ready to announce to you guys.
00:26:47.670 - 00:27:03.240, Speaker A: Rock on. We like it. We like the funding. Anybody have question about appropriation of resources? Good. Then we'll move on.
00:27:04.330 - 00:27:04.934, Speaker F: Cool.
00:27:05.052 - 00:27:23.840, Speaker A: So one, let's say subject that's been a matter of friction has been the whitelisting process, which we do quite selectively, but we've been working on improving that. And let's hear from Jonathan about what we're doing about John.
00:27:25.170 - 00:27:48.994, Speaker E: Ah, yeah, thank you. So I think we consider ourselves very lucky to have a community that's very straight with us. So one of you guys at some point said, what are you guys doing with your whitelisting process? It's complete trash. You're not reactive enough. It's not clear enough what the criteria are. There is not enough new assets. And then we kind of ask around and that's kind of, I think what the general sentiment was.
00:27:48.994 - 00:28:33.954, Speaker E: So really appreciate that. We're also a little bit, I think general, we're a bit, let's say a feedback addict. So keep doing that. We love feedback and if it's straight, we can handle that. And so what we did is we revamped that process a bit because also internally it was a bit of an annoyance every week where we had a lot of discussions back and forth and it wasn't really clear who decides that and how do we decide on assets and the order in which we list them. So basically now what we do is we do it both proactively and reactively. So the process that you know, from the whitelisting channel and that's described on the Google form, I think that stays in place and you can be sure that all of your suggestions are heard and picked up at the same time.
00:28:33.954 - 00:29:19.662, Speaker E: Every Monday we've now gathered a database. We pulled some data from OpenC that gets automatically updated and we ranked that. And we now said we look at assets that are above one e floor price and I think 150 eth trading volume. We know these are not like perfect criteria and we do some qualitative checks as well. But basically every Monday we select five assets and we also look into what you guys have suggested. And then on Wednesdays and Thursdays is when we whitelist these assets. And just also I think an important point to discuss here is the bottleneck has not been so much on the selection of the assets, although that's also been in noise, but really on the community activation.
00:29:19.662 - 00:30:11.394, Speaker E: So in the past we've just whitelisted these assets, but we've really lost a lot of potential here because we actually didn't get really in touch with these communities that benefit hugely from being whitelisted. Right. So that's something also that a couple of you guys mentioned to us. Like you said, are you guys not reaching out to these communities? I mean, why are you leaving that value for the platform, for the protocol on the table? And so what we now do is we have a structured process and we're still experimenting. What's the best way is to actually, let's say, go into a pachy penguins community and make these guys aware that their nfts have just really gained in utility. And this is also something that is still a manual process and we're still trying to iterate and get that more smooth. So whenever we whitelist an asset, we want these communities to know about that and to come in.
00:30:11.394 - 00:30:44.974, Speaker E: Ideally, just motivate a couple of these folks to come directly in, try it out and our experiences, as many of you have described, once you try it and you see that it works and what the benefit is, then many of these users become excited fans and loyal platform users. So that's kind of the new process. About three to five assets every Wednesday and Thursday. We listen to everything that you suggest. Please keep doing that. If anyone here feels he would be excited about helping us reaching out to these projects. Right.
00:30:44.974 - 00:31:19.594, Speaker E: So that's an opportunity to get in touch with a new project every week. Right. So if you're generally not afraid to reach out to new communities, to new folks, we can definitely do with some help on that front so we can be even faster and get the word out that these nfts have added utility and liquidity. Now, that's what we have planned. That's what we're starting next Monday. I would love to hear whether that's something that you guys find appealing. If that's a step forward, I hope so.
00:31:19.594 - 00:31:22.330, Speaker E: And yeah, please keep giving us feedback.
00:31:23.710 - 00:31:29.820, Speaker C: Jonathan, if people are keen to help out, should they just contact you directly? What's the best way?
00:31:30.190 - 00:31:38.880, Speaker E: Yeah, you can just actually, I'm not exactly sure whether my dms are open. I think they are still, I'm not getting spammed so much.
00:31:39.570 - 00:31:45.986, Speaker A: I think let's make use of the whitelist channel. That's a great place to put all suggestions and discussion regarding the whitelisting process.
00:31:46.088 - 00:31:46.594, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:31:46.712 - 00:31:53.474, Speaker E: All right. Yeah, just suggest it in the whitelisting channel if you're keen to help out. Awesome.
00:31:53.672 - 00:32:11.446, Speaker A: Great. Thanks a lot, Jonathan. So you heard it, guys. If you have suggestions or all sorts of feedback regarding whitelisting, please put it in the whitelisting channel. And then whatever instance if necessary, then Jonathan or someone else from the team will also follow up with you by DM. Great. Thanks again, Jonathan.
00:32:11.446 - 00:32:19.290, Speaker A: Let's now go to Annie Niftify's CMO. What do you have cooking for us? What's.
00:32:21.790 - 00:33:19.166, Speaker F: Everyone? So yes, I mean, first of all, thank you very much for the feedback. I made notes, definitely it was something we were working on, but we'll fine tune the communication even further. And yeah, I had noticed that concern of people being worried about their high value assets being at risk if they had to try things out. Well noted. Thank you very much. Well, we are apart from whitelisting processes and different other processes that we're discussing and trying to put things into a more smooth working way. What we're also trying to do is we're experimenting with different type of campaigns online and we're also trying to put a bit of this week, for example, we tried to put more fun touch to things.
00:33:19.166 - 00:34:11.118, Speaker F: So we had launched the meme contest. It's still going. We still have few days to create more memes and to see how it goes. I think, strawberry, you also pumped the channel for memes. After the contrast, it will be continuing going on. So we will have more things coming in terms of content, which is just going to make things more fun. The other things that we're looking into, we have different ideas that we will be rolling out in terms of not only activating other communities but also how we're going to work with you guys as a community and how we're going to try to get your help in a more structured and more useful way.
00:34:11.118 - 00:34:44.186, Speaker F: So we're looking into ambassador program ideas, we're looking into different campaign ideas where I definitely would be more in touch with you and we will have more discussions and I'm looking for more involvement from the community and we'll be doing things together. I think we will be talking more about marketing focused activities next week when we will have more tangible things to.
00:34:44.208 - 00:36:03.380, Speaker E: Share with you, if I may add one sentence here. So actually, several of you have reached out to us and offered to help in various ways, and we had several conversations and we're really, truly grateful for that. One thing that I'm also really grateful that you're actually bearing with us is to structure this collaboration a bit better. Like, as Steven said, we've grown from, I think, two to 15 people now within a couple of months, and there's really quite a couple of sort of just housekeeping stuff that we have to do as a project internally and to get processes smooth and to operationalize a lot of things and the interface between us and the community at this point, this is something that is a top priority and that we're actively looking into, but it's not going as fast as we would have wished, so bear with us. And we want to find ways to structure this collaboration because there's so many of you out there that I think can do a lot of things much better than ourselves. Even so, there's folks out there here that probably can do better sort of user support than we could have ever, and we want to reward that. Just know that we're on it and we'll be in touch with a structure that hopefully works for everybody.
00:36:04.950 - 00:36:23.660, Speaker A: Coolness. Thanks a lot, Jonathan, and thanks a lot, Annie. Stephen, real quick, just before we proceed, so somebody actually just mentioned this in the general channel, but I think they've experienced a high gas fee bug for the first time. What's going on with that? What's the latest situation?
00:36:24.830 - 00:38:05.420, Speaker C: Yes, so what's happening is a couple of people have started basically, instead of, because there's no easy way to bulk cancel your offers, which we will, by the way, make a way to do so that you don't have to in the future. What people have been doing is because the markets have been changing so much recently and we've kind of seen prices drop. Instead of canceling each offer, they just went and removed permission for NiftyFi smart contract to manage their wealth or die. And then what that basically means is if you try to accept one of their offers, the transaction would fail because we don't have permission to move that money and we don't have a check on the front end to check that every single time before we do the transaction, because we prompt for that in the beginning and this hasn't been an issue in the past. So as part of V two, we are moving to a full API, which will also become available for other people to integrate with us. But as part of that API, there will be a method that for every smart contract interaction, there's a Javascript method that we can then run to double check every possible thing that could go wrong in that transaction and give much more. Either hide offers that are just not possible to accept because the person doesn't have enough money, or we don't have permission to manage those assets, or if there's some other reason the transaction might fail, we'll give much more clear feedback on what that actually is.
00:38:05.420 - 00:38:38.360, Speaker C: But, yeah, in general, super high gas fees means that there's something that would fail as part of that transaction. And then metamask estimates really high gas fees. So we've got a fix for that. We're right on the verge of releasing V two. So for us to retrofit that into the old code base, when that's going to go away in a few weeks, is a little bit of a waste of effort. So if you guys can just bear with us for a short period of time, once V two goes live, a lot of these issues should go away.
00:38:38.890 - 00:38:44.600, Speaker A: Is there anything specific that a user can do at the moment in order to get past that?
00:38:46.250 - 00:39:12.240, Speaker C: No, because the thing is, it requires the actual lender to give us permission. It's not possible to complete the transaction if our smart contract can't move funds out of the lender's wallet, into the borrower's wallet. So, unfortunately, if those assets, if we don't have permission to move it, this is the blockchain. Right? Like, we can't force that to happen.
00:39:13.190 - 00:39:18.660, Speaker A: But are you saying that this occurs usually in a situation where the asset is part of a.
00:39:21.750 - 00:39:42.074, Speaker C: When the lender actually just said, niftify smart contract can't manage their dye or wet. So basically, we just can't actually move that money. So it's more to do on the lender side. It's not to do with the NFTs. It's more the ERC 20s. That's an issue.
00:39:42.272 - 00:40:14.820, Speaker A: Got you. All right, man. Thanks for that explanation. Really appreciate it. And we'll continue communicating it to anyone who's currently experiencing that problem. Since you've got the mic already and you gave in between your sentences a little bit of v two alpha, why don't you keep that going a little bit and tell us if there's a range or a date where we can expect V two. If there's any further features, you can tell us about it, and maybe any further features you can't tell us about it.
00:40:15.350 - 00:40:53.102, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. Basically, we are kind of in final testing, we're not adding any new features. We're just trying to make sure that everything works. So kind of finding small issues fixing them and then kind of running through all our full kind of test suites. Obviously you can imagine that this is quite time consuming because we have to start loans, finish the loans, pay them back, let them default, test that for loans that got started in v one and then we move to v two, make sure that they still work. So there's just a lot of cases that require quite a lot of kind of testing on our side.
00:40:53.236 - 00:40:54.706, Speaker E: And like I said, we really want.
00:40:54.728 - 00:41:45.186, Speaker C: To make sure that we get this right, but we are aiming for first or second week of December, if barring not like that, we don't find any difficult to fix all major bugs. But yeah. So first or second week of December is probably the date that you can expect it. Not all of the features will immediately be available on the front end. So there's a few things that we'll kind of enable once we've kind of to v two. Moving to V two has been a kind of very big change for us because we're kind of moving from something that really, when we started building nestify the aft market didn't exist in the way that it does now. We kind of tried to keep things as small and as simple as we could.
00:41:45.186 - 00:43:17.326, Speaker C: And moving to V two is more than just kind of adding new features. We've kind of re kind of platformed and architected the system to be very modular, allowing us to add support for new NFT types and new loans and all these kinds of things in a much kind of more modular way going forward. So it's a very big change. We've gone from a single contract to multiple smart contracts that are kind of individually kind of upgradable and, well, it's not upgradable, but we can replace them with better and improved versions. There's all of that that's happening and then we need to kind of like move to that new foundation and that includes also the API. And then we can kind of enable some of these new features that are in the smart contract in the UI that will kind of come in the kind of weeks that follow the main ones that you'll see kind of coming soon is, I think the one that I'm most excited about is kind of renegotiations and that would really allow people to kind of, instead of having to struggle to kind of, if you're going to be a couple of days late or you want to repay early or you want to extend the loan period, all of those things now become much more kind of supportive natively in the actual platform. And then there's a few other things that you'll see as they come.
00:43:17.326 - 00:43:34.946, Speaker C: I don't want to give all of the secrets away. That's kind of that. And then there's also some other things that we're doing to kind of help make it easier for other projects to integrate with us and kind of make us available directly from inside their platforms. But those will kind of come in.
00:43:34.968 - 00:43:39.140, Speaker A: The new year only sounding pretty good to me.
00:43:39.670 - 00:43:40.094, Speaker C: Yes.
00:43:40.152 - 00:43:41.238, Speaker A: Anything else you wanted to add?
00:43:41.324 - 00:44:11.120, Speaker C: One other thing that's coming soon is that we are adding a little Twitter bot and that will just tweet out new big loans over a specific threshold very similar to the activity feed, but just like an automated Twitter one, it won't go on the kind of main and niftify Twitter account, so you won't get spammed by those things if you're not interested. But we will tweet out bigger loans that are over a certain threshold kind of in the next few.
00:44:13.650 - 00:44:54.990, Speaker A: I mean, I personally love Twitter bots and I use them a lot. Everybody here is probably familiar with Twitter bots, either belonging to various specific artists or various specific projects. The ones that I follow personally, for example, include the crypto voxels bot, the Decentraland bot, the hackathao bot x copy, and a few others. So yeah, it'll be pretty exciting to get a nifty five bot as well so that everybody can be up to speed on what's happening in terms of executed loans. Let's go to Jonathan for a second and I'll ask him a question. Now, you guys can all say that it was worth being on this call for the alpha you're about to get, but Jonathan, when token.
00:44:57.810 - 00:45:42.298, Speaker E: I was hoping that we don't turn into when token community, but it's also understandable that this is a topic that we've teased many times about the token launch, so there's no secret that we're working on a token. However, we've been getting quite a couple of questions. Many team members have been getting a lot of questions, and we've sort of agreed that we communicate about the token launch a bit in a more sort of a clear way without causing any confusion. And that means to take a bit of a step back and basically say there will be a token. We're targeting Q one. We're working quite hard on it. We have a team of two and a half FTE on it, working on it.
00:45:42.298 - 00:46:53.154, Speaker E: We also already have a couple of simulations going, but what it is and what it exactly does, we will communicate comprehensively when we can do so without leaving any questions open, just because we think it's less confusing for everyone and just the professional thing to do at the same time. Also, we're not really in a rush to launch the token. We are in a position to launch a token if we need to for some reason, to avoid harm from the platform, if that would be necessary, but we don't think that will be necessary. At the same time, we are very focused on v two, so there's really quite a couple of powerful surprises I think you'll find in the roadmap that we have not talked about yet. And the further we are on the product market fit journey, the better. Also, ultimately, for the token launch and for the token, and we want to make sure that the token model really then is really a fit for scaling this platform and the future extensions that we've planned into a leading public utility supporting the financialization of NFT. So we're focused on product market fit and there's really opportunities left and right.
00:46:53.154 - 00:47:28.494, Speaker E: It's actually quite stunning kind of what kind of opportunities are left and right. And we think the further we can push it out, the better it will be for the token launch and for the project. But we are targeting Q one and we will be ready to launch if you need to earlier. Yeah, so that's, I think, what we agreed to internally to say about the token launch. I know that there's a couple of open questions. Please also feel free to ask in the Q A. We have a bit of time, I think I want to quickly just talk about one other topic and we're actually quite excited about this.
00:47:28.494 - 00:48:08.294, Speaker E: We have sort of a quote unquote thought leadership series coming out. We really want to contribute to the discourse in the web3 space about the financialization of NFTs because we believe that NFT finance will become quite an accelerator for the NFT space and for NFT based economies. So we will come out with some content there and we hope you're guys excited. We hope you will engage in that content. We put quite some research on it on a sort of semi academic level, I would say. And so, yeah, just want to encourage you to really engage with that. It's going to be a series of articles, there might be some quite exciting collaborations.
00:48:08.294 - 00:48:29.860, Speaker E: We're currently looking into how we can really position ourselves as the player in the space, contributing to the, let's say, epistemological exploration in that sense of that industry that we're a part of from a first principles perspective. Yeah. Strawberry, back to you.
00:48:30.310 - 00:49:02.330, Speaker A: Sweet. Thanks. A lot, Jonathan. That's some interesting stuff, and I'm personally looking forward to just seeing what else nistify can contribute to the Defi realm in general. And I also personally feel, I hope that people here will agree with me, that taking our time with the token is the appropriate thing to do if we want to launch a legit token that actually does stuff. Right. And it's not just a purely speculative nonsense, but yeah, thanks a lot for that summary and that information, guys.
00:49:02.330 - 00:49:44.920, Speaker A: Let's open up the floor to some questions and answers or some feedback. If anybody has anything about today's session specifically or about things that have been going on in general, anyone that has questions that were asked during the course of the session and that I apologize for not getting to, please feel free to resubmit them now or to just either raise your hand or unmute yourself and go ahead and ask or say whatever you'd like, whatever's on your mind. Anybody have anything for us? Should I hum some jeopardy music while you guys are thinking? Do.
00:49:55.690 - 00:49:57.610, Speaker C: Things, strawberry.
00:50:01.950 - 00:50:34.290, Speaker A: Okay, so if nobody has any questions, then I guess let's close out this session. Unless somebody from the team has something extra that they'd like to add. No? Okay, so we'll close with a few final comments. First of all, thank you, everybody, for joining us today. We really appreciate everybody's comments and suggestions and feedback during the course of the session. And of course, you being so attentive and joining us in general, we could use your help a little bit. If you believe in niftify.com
00:50:34.290 - 00:51:07.550, Speaker A: and in this team specifically. I believe, like, I recognize all of your names already, right? You guys have been here to quite a few community calls already over the course of a few months. I mean, you've done some loans or you've borrowed some, and you know that we're trying to do things in a legit way, right? So if you believe that and you appreciate it and you agree with it, please help us spread the word. Tell people about niftify. Tell them about your borrowing or lending success stories. Retweet our stuff. Anything that you can do to help spread the word, bring people into the community would be of great assistance for us.
00:51:07.550 - 00:51:48.042, Speaker A: In addition to that, reach out to us if you'd like to help us in more specific ways. For example, if you want to take part in outreach to new NFT communities, right when we're whitelisting new projects, or if you want to help, I don't know, write up documentation or get involved in some other way that we haven't even imagined yet, and that you'd like to suggest, please do get in touch and we'll see if we can collaborate, bring you in on it, or just make you a part of the process. That'd be really terrific. Don't be shy. We're very nice people, usually. And yeah, we'd really love to talk to you either way. So that's it for today, everybody.
00:51:48.042 - 00:52:01.460, Speaker A: Thanks again for coming. Steven, John, Annie, SJ, if you guys want to say, wave goodbye and we'll see everybody in next month's community call.
00:52:02.230 - 00:52:03.010, Speaker B: Cheers, everyone.
00:52:03.080 - 00:52:03.730, Speaker C: Thanks, everyone.
00:52:03.800 - 00:52:04.740, Speaker A: Thanks for coming.
00:52:06.870 - 00:52:07.440, Speaker E: Thanks, everyone.
