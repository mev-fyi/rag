00:00:00.090 - 00:00:26.920, Speaker A: Plan for next year. Hopefully all good things. So tonight what we're going to do is just update you a little bit on the year end stats. Some of our plans for 2022. Look back on a little bit on 2021, where we were then and where we are now. It's going to be quite a short one. And then at the end, we'll just announce the Eth giveaway winners right at the end of the call.
00:00:26.920 - 00:01:02.638, Speaker A: So I see it's like a relatively small group here today, so it's probably going to be quite intimate and feel free to ask any questions at any point. Just drop something in the call chat and then either Annie or Nina will just bring it up and then we can try and answer any questions you might have. So I'm going to hand over to Annie to just give us an update on the end of year stats, and then I'll follow up that with a little bit of update on what we got planned for 2022. Annie, over to you.
00:01:02.804 - 00:01:32.714, Speaker B: Okay, sure. Hello, everyone, and welcome. Happy to see you all here as Stephen sat. It's a small group, but I'm sure it's going to be fine in terms of ambience. So basically what I'll do is I'll try to share the screen, and this time I want to show you a new dashboard. So for those of you can you see my screen first of all, let me just double check that first.
00:01:32.832 - 00:01:34.490, Speaker A: Yeah, we can see.
00:01:34.640 - 00:02:34.410, Speaker B: Okay, cool. So for those who have followed us, I'm sure you've heard about the codeless conduct hackathon that happened last week, and it was a no code web three hackathon. We were one of the sponsors and there was a bounty, and the bounty winner is the guy who created the dune dashboard. So I think this is good in a sense that you will no longer need to wait for another community call to get more detailed analytics and more data. You can just come here and see most of it yourself. So from now on, I think it would make sense to follow this dashboard when we are presenting and add more stuff to it if you have more questions, or I'll just add more figures that are missing in here, but this will be kind of the thing that we will be following. This is the first iteration.
00:02:34.410 - 00:03:16.940, Speaker B: With the time, I'm sure it will get better, but this is what we've got at the moment, and I think it's pretty good already. This was something we weren't presenting before, but it's available here now on this dashboard, you can see the average APR over the time and we are, on average for December, around 77% APR for all the loans up to now. Sorry, I couldn't hear that. Hello?
00:03:17.950 - 00:03:20.342, Speaker A: I think that was just background noise. Annie.
00:03:20.406 - 00:03:52.674, Speaker B: Oh, okay. Sorry about. So, basically, the APR numbers are presented in different forms here. Unfortunately, we have some kind of mismatch between the real numbers and these first two numbers. 506% for seven day loan is not the average. So we'll look into it and fix that. But basically, you can dig into more details related to the aprs.
00:03:52.674 - 00:04:44.230, Speaker B: You can see everything here in terms of the average aprs per each project. So when you hover over here, you will see the full list and the average for each one represented there, which is giving more details. So, going to the things that we usually present here are the numbers. Basically, this month we are at around 363 loans up to now. I think, like, looking at the track record, we will be probably, hopefully get over last month's numbers as well. So everything is on track. In terms of volumes, we have already passed 6 million total volume loan for December.
00:04:44.230 - 00:05:28.038, Speaker B: Last month, we almost reached 10 million. So we'll see how it goes this month. But it looks pretty healthy this month as well. So in terms of cumulative loans, at the moment, we are at 37.4 million. Total volume up to now, those have been from 2745 loans and from which the total unique sort of completed ones were 2211. And you can see the interest here.
00:05:28.038 - 00:06:15.650, Speaker B: Basically, cumulative interest is 972,000. Sorry about that. So if you look at the top lenders and top borrowers tab here, you will see how many percentage each of them represents. The top three are the big, big volumes. So basically, our top lender already passed total 6 million. He's at around 6.276,000. And he's made in interest 345,000 and completed 400 loans.
00:06:15.650 - 00:06:55.310, Speaker B: So very impressive numbers indeed. The second biggest lender is at 3.1 million with interest earned of 223,000. And those are coming from 72 loans. And the third biggest lender is at 2.2 million with 51,000 in interest from 136 loans. So if we look at the borrowers on the other side, our top borrower is at 2.6
00:06:55.310 - 00:07:25.740, Speaker B: million with interest of 71,000 from 144 loans. Second biggest borrower is at 1.8 million with 1.1 million. One point, sorry, 11,000 in interest and from 23 loans. And the third one is at 1.3 million.
00:07:25.740 - 00:08:35.508, Speaker B: So you will see all the other wallets as well here. Basically, when you hover over the thing, you will see all the details of the other loans in terms of biggest assets. As you can see here, we have art blokes, we have board apes being the first top two, and then those are followed by crypto punks. The last thing that is not included here, but I know you guys were asking for it, so SJ made sure that we have those numbers as well for you. The top defaulted projects, we had art blocks, 72 projects, loans from art blocks, which was for 942,000 in volume. We had 32 loans from hash masks that were defaulted. One async art, four vfriends, and six postcards.
00:08:35.508 - 00:08:50.070, Speaker B: Those were, like, the top defaulted projects. So that's what I've got for you. If you need anything else. Yeah, let me know and I can dig into the numbers.
00:08:50.680 - 00:09:29.970, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks, Annie. If anybody's got any questions to shout, or if you don't feel like comfortable speaking, just drop the questions in call chats and we'll take it from there. So, yeah, thanks for that, Annie. And then I just wanted to give a really quick update. We did do a podcast, I mean, a medium article on our plans for next year, but I thought I would just kind of reiterate some of them here and then kind of give everybody a chance to kind of ask more detailed questions. I've seen quite a lot of conversation in the general channel about some of these features, so happy to answer any questions people have about them.
00:09:29.970 - 00:10:19.040, Speaker A: So, like I said, we are almost ready to go with protocol V two. We're really excited about it because I think this kind of really lays the foundation for us to kind of build something kind of really fantastic going forward. Like I said, the first version of the contract was we did this back a crypto punk for less than one ether, you could get an autoglyph for less than two. And we weren't really sure that there would even be a market for this kind of product. So we really built the simplest possible thing we could build. And then, obviously seeing amazing support we've gotten from you guys and huge growth in volume. It's clear that there's something here, and we're onto something.
00:10:19.040 - 00:11:38.996, Speaker A: And so what we really wanted to do with this next version is kind of lay the foundation for us to build a protocol that is easily extendable, easily upgradable, supports different kinds of loans and potentially other types of agreements, and also is easy for people to integrate with us. Basically, what that means is, besides all the new features that we're adding in V two, we've also rearchitected the whole system to go from a single smart contract that handles everything to a bunch of upgradable smart contracts that we can register new ones of and upgrade over time so that we can continue adding new features. So we're looking to launch that early. In Q one, we are running through the final set of tests. We've gotten full audits on the actual smart contracts. We also now running full security audits on kind of every part of our infrastructure to make sure that we are safe completely end to end. A lot of projects don't bother with the non smart contract audits, but there's been a couple of hacks recently, especially the badger Dao one where the actual smart contracts weren't compromised but the UI and the front end was compromised.
00:11:38.996 - 00:12:52.556, Speaker A: So we're going to really feel that it's super important for us to make sure that every piece of our technology stack is as fully up to date and secure as we can possibly make it. I'm going to list a few of these features that are kind of, all of them are natively supported by the smart contracts that are going live very soon. We won't enable every single one of these features all at the same time from the front end because there's a little bit of kind of ux work to be done on some of them, but we'll kind of be, over the course of the next couple of months be kind of releasing them one by one. We'll announce the order in which that's going to happen kind of early next year. But some of these things that we are really looking forward to are ELC 1155 support. One of the things we did in the smart contract is we made it very easy to kind of write a wrapper for different ERT standards that then kind of make them act in a similar way inside of our protocol. We can use different standards in the same loan agreement without having to rewrite the loan agreement.
00:12:52.556 - 00:13:29.420, Speaker A: This kind of makes it much easier for us to kind of add future support for different standards. And the first one of that is EOT 1155s. Thanks for waiting. I know it feels like it's taken very long, but like I said, we didn't just go duplicate what we did with seven to ones. We kind of built a whole new system that makes it much easier for us to kind of add new standards as they develop over time. Next big one is ERC nine nine eight support. So ERC nine nine eight is a standard that essentially defines an NFT that can own other nfts.
00:13:29.420 - 00:14:04.708, Speaker A: And this is how we propose to use bundles. So what you would do then is you would build up a bundle of multiple nfts. They would then be turned into a single NFT that owns all of the sub nfts that supports. You can have both nine, nine, eight and same bundle. And then you can essentially take out a loan on that. And then moving things in and out of escrow is just a single transaction. Instead of requiring multiple transactions, we also extending the loan duration to unlimited durations.
00:14:04.708 - 00:14:51.480, Speaker A: So in the near future, instead of just having 714, 30 and 90 days, there would also be an option for custom where you can just pick an expiry date. And that can be any point in the future. So much more flexible loan periods. We're also allowing prorata loans. So in a prorata loan, you would be able to, at the moment, if you repay a loan early that loan, you would still pay the full repayment amount, as if that you kind of completed the full loan period. But with prorata amounts, we don't allow kind of partial repayments. It will have to be a full repayment, but you can make that repayment early and save on the remaining interest for the rest of the loan period.
00:14:51.480 - 00:16:06.000, Speaker A: Another big thing, which I think is probably the thing I'm most excited about, is loan extensions and renegotiations. This will allow the borrower and lender to agree on new terms for an existing loan without having to finish the actual loan. And this can be done either before or after the loan term expires. So if you don't manage to repay a loan in time, as long as you manage to make an agreement with the lender, and you both agreed on a new loan term, you can extend the loan term to any new period that you want. There's also the option to require an additional payment from the borrower to the lender to kind of offset some of the risk of potentially taking on these new things. But I think that's going to be the main thing that we see often in support requests is people asking for help, trying to kind of just extend the loan period because they're missing their payment by one day and they want to be able to still honor the loan without actually losing the assets. So I think that's going to be a super useful thing, especially for borrowers.
00:16:06.000 - 00:17:20.950, Speaker A: We also allowing listings with binding terms. So the way that this would work is, as a borrower, you can say, I'm looking for a loan between ten and twelve ether for 30 days, and I'm willing to accept any APR under 50%, say. And then if a lender comes along, and then you can mark that as saying I'm willing to accept any offers that fall within this range that would then allow lenders to a find people that they know are seriously looking for loans. And then if they make an offer that falls within that range, the loan would automatically get started. It's important to remember though, that you have to choose when listing that you are willing to accept any offer that falls within that range. So if you still want to do it the same way as we've currently done it, where there's no obligation for you to accept a loan, you can just do that without marking that you're willing to accept any offers that fit within a range. So this should make it much easier for lenders to find serious borrowers and kind of smooths out the process for them on that side.
00:17:20.950 - 00:18:36.590, Speaker A: And then the other thing that we're adding is in the same way that you currently have an NFT that represents the lender's position in a loan. We're also now creating an NFT that represents the borrower's position in a loan. So this would essentially allow you, if you see that you're not going to be able to make your repayment period, you could always sell that obligation to somebody else and at least recoup some of the difference between your loan amount and the market value for your NFT. The thing that we're really excited about on these things actually is we're speaking to a number of people and protocols that are looking to integrate with us and using these NFTs that represent these debt positions or loan obligations as primitives inside other protocols that allows them to deploy more capital and kind of give better rates and faster loan turnaround times for everybody on the platform. So really excited about that. And like I said earlier, in general, I think it's just kind of the start of NFT money legos in the same way that you have money legos in the kind of broader defi ecosystem. So excited to see what people build on top of.
00:18:36.590 - 00:19:26.880, Speaker A: So that's it. If anybody has any questions on those, happy to answer them, drop their questions in chat. We can kind of circle back to this at the end if anybody thinks of something in the meantime. But really looking forward to seeing your feedback on this. And hopefully these are some of the things that you guys have been asking for. There's also a whole bunch of other things that are not smart contract related that we will also kind of be working on. We're hiring a couple of more front end developers so we can execute even faster for you guys on the UX improvements, things like filtering, being able to in your filter criteria have exclusions and not just inclusions.
00:19:26.880 - 00:20:34.260, Speaker A: There's a whole bunch of cool stuff we got planned there. So keep those suggestions coming. In the suggestions channel, we watch them all and really try to kind of build the things that you guys are asking. So that's it from there, some other new things coming up. We are, in the same way that we have our activity channel, we are also creating a new Niftify Twitter account that'll be a niftify Twitter bot. And this will tweet out not every single loan that gets done on the platform, but we'll have loans value so that we can see, get a little bit of marketing going on some of these higher value loans and people can follow them who aren't necessarily part of our actual discord. So we'll announce when that goes live in discord and hopefully you guys can follow that and tweet it out when you're one of your loans, it's across that threshold.
00:20:34.260 - 00:20:42.630, Speaker A: So up next, we've got Jonathan. He's going to talk a little bit about our token economy. Jonathan, over to you.
00:20:43.900 - 00:21:30.736, Speaker C: Yeah. Hey, everyone. I wanted to first of all ask if there are any questions regarding the v two features, because I think we didn't really give you guys the time to ask questions. So I'll just pause here quickly if there's any questions regarding all of this cool stuff that Stephen just talked about, this is the time for it. All right? Otherwise we'll just move on. You were just comprehensive enough there, Stephen. And the other thing that we wanted to mention is, for those of you who've read this article, onwards and upwards that we've written, the second part that we are focused, the second big topic that we're focused on over the next couple of months is the nifty token economy.
00:21:30.736 - 00:22:55.776, Speaker C: And we've said this many times, and I think from the very beginning, way before I even joined the project, long term vision was always to build a fully decentralized, permissionless, user owned NFT finance utility. So we're trying to build a protocol that is user owned and user operated in the long run because we believe that this way, the technology that we've been building will have the maximum impact on the NFT space. And this vision obviously requires us to tokenize both the value accretion in the current protocol and how it evolves and in future versions, and make that, and distribute that value in the form of a token. But also it requires to tokenize the agency over the protocol, obviously, so it can be governed. So we will have a token and we will design a token economy and especially also validate the token economy before we launch it. We're already spinning up some simulations and what we'll end up with is a token economy that has really powerful incentives and incentive aligns all the stakeholders involved in Niftify currently and going forward. And what we do want to just mention is that we've decided, because there was a lot of questions and we want to be really clear about what we're going to build there.
00:22:55.776 - 00:23:32.696, Speaker C: And this is why we will only communicate in writing about it. So the next sort of chunk of information will come early 2022. Yeah. This is to kind of keep our team focused, but also especially not to confuse anyone. So yeah, I hope you guys are bearing with us. We're a full steam ahead on the token economy and we'll announce news soon on this front. Another thing that's coming that I'm personally very excited about because I've worked in it together with Cadlabs is this NFT finance article series.
00:23:32.696 - 00:24:37.280, Speaker C: It's a bit of an ontological exploration of the NFT finance universe. We're hopefully pushing out the first article before Christmas still, and the idea is that we kind of have an ongoing stream of articles coming out that really add new information or different perspectives to the discussion around what is NFT finance and where is it going, where do we fit in with all our projects. So I hope you guys are all excited about that. There's going to be one, for example, about the infrastructural similarity of NFT art and collectible markets, which are the markets that kind of dominated for a long time, the NFT space. This might be changing a bit into 2022 then, on the one hand, and on the other hand, traditional art and collectibles markets. And I think we have done quite some deep research and will be able to contribute interesting aspects there, which, yeah, I hope you guys are looking forward to and will be engaging with that content. It'll be written.
00:24:37.280 - 00:25:31.668, Speaker C: We're writing it a bit not on an academic level, but on sort of a, even not semi academic level, but quite a sort of complex level in a sense. And it is currently in review with a guy who's lecturing at Harvard. We have it in review with a guy at Imperial College London. So we're really trying to engage some of the thought leaders in the space, and we hope that this will position niftify, really as a project that's contributing knowledge to the space and lead to a brand which differentiates. And we're kind of building a moat, I think, by investing into that specific topic. Yeah, I think that was it from my side. I think now we have time for just some general feedback questions about anything that you guys want to talk about.
00:25:31.668 - 00:25:42.650, Speaker C: I think we have enough time. Praise whatever's on your mind. I'll just pause here and then we'll end up with a couple of things you can help with if you're interested in.
00:25:51.500 - 00:25:54.860, Speaker A: Looks like you were also pretty comprehensive there, Jonathan.
00:25:56.960 - 00:26:12.384, Speaker B: Well, to incentivize someone to give a question, I guess the person who asks the first question will be the one who will help me pick the winner of the one. It's going to be nice.
00:26:12.502 - 00:26:39.704, Speaker A: I don't know if that's a prize or a punishment. Cool. Okay. I think don't have too many questions this time around. Maybe we should just move on to the next section. We're always free to kind of chat to everybody in general, so just shout if you've got any questions that weren't answered here. So I do have a quick one, guys.
00:26:39.704 - 00:26:53.070, Speaker A: Yeah. So I'm just curious to know how is the token going to impact loans at all, for example, using it as a collateral or things like that?
00:26:56.500 - 00:27:19.430, Speaker C: Yeah, so this is something that we're not yet communicating about. So I would have to hope that you have some patience there with us. But you can trust that the token economy, the incentive system that the token is instantiating, will be strongly incentivizing loan activity, obviously.
00:27:20.940 - 00:27:23.448, Speaker A: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.
00:27:23.534 - 00:27:39.710, Speaker C: Thanks for the question. Very excited to see some oxmonts here in the community.
00:27:42.240 - 00:27:44.620, Speaker A: Should we move on to the next section?
00:27:45.760 - 00:28:24.836, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the next section is really just wrapping it up. I think we wanted to, first of all, say thank you because many of you have actually supported us on Twitter quite a lot in recent days. I think especially around the Nexo launch. I think we just felt like we have a real community that's supporting us and that's setting things straight on Twitter if it's not correct. And yeah, just wanted to say thank you. Please keep doing that. We try and have our eyes everywhere, but a lot of things obviously fall through the cracks.
00:28:24.836 - 00:29:15.688, Speaker C: There's so much happening on crypto Twitter. So we really appreciate if you kind of stand up for us and support us and other things that you can help us with. This is really, I think it's not a construction site, but we need to get better at getting high quality assets onto the platform quicker. So we even have an internal leadership board now a team kind of who is better at activating these NFT project communities. Right? So we try and reach out to these projects and kind of educate the NFT holders about these new possibilities that they now have. But this is something that we could absolutely use support with. If you want to see, for example, the lenders, if you want to lend against specific assets, then by all means, obviously paste it in our discord.
00:29:15.688 - 00:29:45.024, Speaker C: But also consider going into these discord panels and making some noise about Nifty. So this is something we could definitely use help with, like and retweet our content on Twitter. That always helps. And yeah, just help us educate the space. We're really at the very much at the beginning. This is just on an adoption curve. It's not even discussion around where we are, but very much at the beginning.
00:29:45.024 - 00:30:30.004, Speaker C: We need to spread the word, educate folks, and then we'll see pretty rapid growth also, if you want to get involved in a more structured way. So we are looking for community members who help us first, as I said in community outreach, also, another thing we want to do is write up better documentation. So with a couple of things. If you're good at copywriting, if you understand our platform inside out, that's something that we'd love to get in touch with you. We just have too many things that we could do them all at once. The more support we have, the quicker we can move forward. We also have a community moderator, an ambassador program that we will talk about next time.
00:30:30.004 - 00:31:12.130, Speaker C: So if you're interested in being a moderator in the community, an ambassador, you can also just shoot us a message already, even before we officially kind of announce that program. And another thing we're doing is we're coming up with a security sort of protocol for discord. So we just want to make sure as things towards the token launch will heat up and we're going to go through all the ups and downs like all disco communities. And we just want to be ready and have a protocol and processes that work. If you're somebody who feels you have a good idea about how best practices work in other discords, this is also something we're currently actively working on. Yeah. Steven, anything to add?
00:31:13.140 - 00:32:01.516, Speaker A: Yeah, I just wanted to just again reiterate what Jonathan was saying. Like, it really is awesome to kind of have a community like you guys jumping in, helping set the record straight about some of these claims that other people are making on Twitter. And it really is very gratifying for me to 18 months ago, Nifty didn't exist, and now we've got this awesome community of nearly 5000 of you now and to kind of feel the support and love that we're getting from you really means a lot to me and I really just wanted to say thank you. Um, cool. So I think that's it. You've got anything else to add, Jonathan?
00:32:01.708 - 00:32:30.790, Speaker C: No, I think that's it for 2021. I think if there's no more questions, we wish all of you happy holidays. I hope you get the chance to recharge a little. It's very difficult in this space. We know we will mostly push through in our team but we are taking a couple of days off the gas paddle. But yeah, we're in a sprint and we're excited to be on that sprint and on that journey together with you. See you next year, I guess.
00:32:31.400 - 00:32:32.572, Speaker B: Bye. It.
00:32:32.626 - 00:32:35.932, Speaker A: Thank you everyone. See you guys next year. Thank you guys.
00:32:36.066 - 00:32:36.940, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:32:37.090 - 00:32:37.790, Speaker B: Thanks.
00:32:38.800 - 00:32:39.528, Speaker C: Bye. Bye.
00:32:39.544 - 00:32:40.650, Speaker A: Bye everyone.
