You can now sort them by loan value, interest, duration, repayment, and by the most recent offers. Next, you can set the maximum APR and the table will refresh accordingly. Another feature is the filter. By the most common loan durations, you can also filter loan offers by currency. Listing an asset on Niftify is free and does not require moving your NFT out of your wallet.
