00:00:00.680 - 00:00:03.405, Speaker A: Hello. Hey.
00:00:04.025 - 00:00:50.375, Speaker B: So I'm basically integrating the stuff from E Simulate into Escall for our client. So as you may know Geth already has the state overload and we are just now getting it. So there was enough demand for it from the Gnosis partners and others. So so soon we'll have it also in all of the 4e like calls and yeah and awaiting your comments on the updates for the assimilate. Lucas reviewed the pr so now we're just waiting for you to try it out and say what. What is your opinion Makes it better, makes it worth and stuff.
00:00:52.015 - 00:00:57.351, Speaker A: You don't have any known issues at the moment that you need to work on it or is it ready on your side?
00:00:57.383 - 00:01:17.995, Speaker B: In a way there are already there are issues related to hashing but to fix those we definitely need to start with the current state of affairs to fix the like the fields that are returned and stuff like that so that you would compare post turfles.
00:01:19.085 - 00:01:20.045, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah.
00:01:20.165 - 00:01:33.505, Speaker B: So yeah in my understanding all the issues that are currently on Trello are hash related so if you see any other please send me one directly in telegram or something like that because yeah, it's hash. Hash all the way.
00:01:36.165 - 00:01:50.225, Speaker A: Yeah, I have currently issues that when I'm running the test test suit and the get is for some reason having being old version and I don't know what is causing that. But yeah, Sina is returning tomorrow then I try to go through with him.
00:01:50.925 - 00:01:51.685, Speaker B: Yeah, perfect.
00:01:51.765 - 00:01:52.741, Speaker A: To see what's wrong.
00:01:52.853 - 00:01:53.665, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:01:55.485 - 00:01:59.705, Speaker A: Is there new nethermind version yet? I guess not yet.
00:02:00.005 - 00:02:01.597, Speaker B: So the one that I've sent to.
00:02:01.621 - 00:02:08.941, Speaker A: You, I mean in the one branch of Netherland is that it seems like.
00:02:08.973 - 00:02:17.143, Speaker B: Released it Simulate probably was released without it. Lukasz, do we have 1.28 release only.
00:02:17.199 - 00:02:19.595, Speaker C: In RC if you want to.
00:02:20.135 - 00:02:22.195, Speaker B: So yeah, I can update them.
00:02:22.895 - 00:02:27.647, Speaker C: We can still add ETF Simulate second PR if it will be ready.
00:02:27.831 - 00:02:39.565, Speaker B: Yeah, let's do that then I'll try to do make today so that we'll get the Escall state update and ETH simulate if it will be all right.
00:02:40.345 - 00:02:46.605, Speaker C: Yeah, as soon as it's approved. Yeah, I remember I had a few smaller comments there.
00:02:47.225 - 00:02:48.765, Speaker B: Yeah, we'll fix that.
00:02:49.985 - 00:02:51.845, Speaker A: Do we have other stuff to discuss?
00:02:53.305 - 00:02:54.685, Speaker B: Not from our side.
00:02:56.825 - 00:03:00.833, Speaker D: On our side we're waiting for Cena to update the latest.
00:03:00.889 - 00:03:01.129, Speaker C: Right.
00:03:01.177 - 00:03:03.105, Speaker D: Clarity.
00:03:05.075 - 00:03:31.745, Speaker A: The issue is that the latest version that we are getting from the docker and that that seems fine but then our test suite is getting it from the GitHub and then for some reason that GitHub version doesn't seem to be the newest version and I don't really understand how that can be the case because I thought that the Docker version is built from the GitHub version, so that's why it's quite weird.
00:03:32.765 - 00:03:39.945, Speaker D: Okay, so I was waiting on Sina for that. We have run the test suite against another mine version we installed though. Is that correct?
00:03:41.805 - 00:03:51.105, Speaker A: Yeah. But the test suite mostly compressed the nodes to each other so that the issue is I cannot really see if there's issues in nethermind. The GAD is behaving like.
00:03:52.165 - 00:04:06.883, Speaker D: I see. So we're kind of blocked on testing nethermind until we get working because the tests are really just comparison to see whether they agree or not. And so we can't do that as long as get not working. We need to see enough for that because we don't know why it's in this weird state. Okay.
00:04:06.979 - 00:04:12.891, Speaker A: Yeah. But she doesn't be coming back tomorrow from the holiday so I can discuss with him about it.
00:04:13.043 - 00:04:17.415, Speaker D: Okay. So hopefully this week we'll get that tested for you guys.
00:04:18.115 - 00:04:24.105, Speaker A: Yeah. Hey Bubble Fuch.
00:04:25.205 - 00:04:35.545, Speaker C: Hi. Sorry I don't have much context here. I just saw this on the protocol calls list and was hoping to listen in and find out what it's about.
00:04:39.245 - 00:04:50.575, Speaker D: Give you a couple of links. One second. 484 pull request. Is that right? Yeah.
00:04:50.655 - 00:04:51.047, Speaker A: Yep.
00:04:51.111 - 00:04:54.155, Speaker D: Here's Lincoln Chat is what we're discussing.
00:04:54.655 - 00:04:55.183, Speaker B: These.
00:04:55.279 - 00:05:06.995, Speaker D: These updates lately have been very short just because we're basically just making sure everybody's on the same page and we're moving forward. We're getting very close to getting this finalized and into main. Net clients and so these calls are short.
00:05:08.935 - 00:05:11.195, Speaker C: Sweet. Appreciate it.
00:05:13.305 - 00:05:14.845, Speaker A: I guess we don't have anything else.
00:05:17.145 - 00:05:31.725, Speaker B: Yeah. If you guys could add the slides, the latest slides to the PR that may be helpful for the visitors. Like see the up to date info on istio.
00:05:33.505 - 00:05:38.291, Speaker A: You mean the slides and maybe that link to the YouTube as well for the presentation, I guess.
00:05:38.433 - 00:05:40.395, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe that would be great.
00:05:40.815 - 00:05:43.375, Speaker A: Okay, I can add those and update.
00:05:43.415 - 00:05:49.595, Speaker B: The link for the. Net and mind implementation as it is master now.
00:05:51.175 - 00:05:52.435, Speaker A: What implementation?
00:05:52.855 - 00:05:58.995, Speaker B: So currently it states it links to the branch that was deleted already and it is.
00:06:02.455 - 00:06:04.275, Speaker A: It's in the slides, I guess.
00:06:06.515 - 00:06:15.495, Speaker B: No, inside it is updated in the like post of GitHub execution APIs pull request.
00:06:17.435 - 00:06:19.015, Speaker A: Oh yeah, that's true. Yeah.
00:06:20.075 - 00:06:20.935, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:06:23.275 - 00:06:26.775, Speaker A: But I guess it's not really as yet. But it's just the domain.
00:06:28.515 - 00:06:29.335, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:06:30.125 - 00:06:33.545, Speaker A: Okay, talk to you later.
00:06:34.725 - 00:06:36.065, Speaker D: See you guys later.
00:06:36.405 - 00:06:39.365, Speaker C: Thanks all. Thanks, bye.
