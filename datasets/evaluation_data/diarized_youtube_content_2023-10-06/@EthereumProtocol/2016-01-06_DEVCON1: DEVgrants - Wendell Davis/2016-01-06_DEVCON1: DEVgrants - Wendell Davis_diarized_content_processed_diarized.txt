00:00:09.610 - 00:00:15.626, Speaker A: Okay, everybody. Hi. So I'm Wendell. I've been running since August, I'm sorry, April.
00:00:15.658 - 00:00:17.438, Speaker B: The Dev grants program, which some of.
00:00:17.444 - 00:00:43.702, Speaker A: You may know about. This was basically a program to kind of give some funding to projects on the side that weren't necessarily core, core development, but maybe actually quite related to it. And this says, not a bounty or a seed program. And this was something that was initiated by Dev. And I think it's been actually quite successful. And I want to kind of give some examples of some of the things that got funded.
00:00:43.766 - 00:00:47.158, Speaker B: So sing was an Ethereum Android client.
00:00:47.254 - 00:01:03.134, Speaker A: And this is something we gave five k to, which was built and is available, and it's something you should check out. Eth embedded. Some of you guys may have used this. This is actually a tool and a tool set for actually having Ethereum on embedded devices.
00:01:03.182 - 00:01:09.202, Speaker B: So we're talking about raspberry, Beaglebone, things like that, and Casper, of course.
00:01:09.336 - 00:01:38.710, Speaker A: This is a really important piece of the coordinative project, and we are really excited about that one, of course, as it seems like you are too. And Metamask as well. So, metamask, you guys probably saw Kumobas'presentation. This is a really exciting development, because basically, this is probably how most people will access the apps for quite some time. So all of these essentially were allocated under an initial tranche of funds.
00:01:38.870 - 00:01:40.954, Speaker B: And I would say that this program.
00:01:40.992 - 00:02:00.980, Speaker A: Has been pretty successful because almost all these programs, these applications were successfully built. So the good news is that we have found another $100,000, and I want to tell you a little about that. That's thanks very much to omise. They're a thai japanese payment processor, and Thomas Greco is here to say a word about that.
00:02:10.490 - 00:03:01.458, Speaker C: So, Omise is a fintech company offering payment and value transfer services in the Asia Pacific region. Our offices are in Thailand and Japan.

Please join us to help fund this work on open standards that are for public benefit.
00:03:01.458 - 00:03:15.980, Speaker C: If we work together, remembering the public good, our work will be happy and useful, and everyone will benefit. Thank you very much to all Ethereum developers, volunteers, and sponsor companies for making our contribution possible.
00:03:18.270 - 00:03:39.486, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Okay, so one of the things, the last slide was actually contact information. So if you guys have an idea or either something that you want to apply with, please just write to grants@ethereum.org or check us out at Twitter at dev grants. So thanks very much.
