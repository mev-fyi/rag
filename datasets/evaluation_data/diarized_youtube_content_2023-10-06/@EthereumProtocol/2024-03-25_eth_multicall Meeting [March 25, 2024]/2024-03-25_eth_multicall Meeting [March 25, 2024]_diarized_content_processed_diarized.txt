00:00:00.440 - 00:00:38.874, Speaker A: Let's begin from my side. I finally got all my tests up and running, merged the latest branch into it, and will ship you the docker image soon ish. And I would ask you to run the tests carefully because there were extremely large amount of fixes and mergers and remerges. So if you could like test also the old stuff, it would be good. And of course, all the things that are now fixed in Trello should be in there.
00:00:39.454 - 00:00:39.790, Speaker B: So.
00:00:39.822 - 00:00:48.394, Speaker A: Yeah, sorry for long delay, but we had a little bit of the merge hell and now we finally fix it.
00:00:49.294 - 00:00:50.834, Speaker B: So is there a new container?
00:00:52.024 - 00:00:55.280, Speaker A: I think in like 30 minutes it will be out there.
00:00:55.312 - 00:00:56.080, Speaker C: Okay.
00:00:56.272 - 00:01:07.764, Speaker A: And I saw that there was large discussion on this week, so if you could highlight what happened on the chart, it would be really, really appreciated.
00:01:13.544 - 00:01:45.194, Speaker B: It's about the base feed that we want to develop. Base fee. And what went in the production in the mainnet just a couple of weeks ago is that there's a blood base fee, which is kind of like named wrongly because there's a base fee per gas. So we feel that it should be remade, named similarly. So now there's a pull request that would change it to the block base fee. Basically peripheral plugs.
00:01:46.144 - 00:02:13.103, Speaker A: I was looking at it and my head went a little bit crazy because it is always here using like snake case, and it is mainly camel case in all of our APIs. So my question would be, do we want to keep it with this underscores? Is it from some APC's or can we keep it can case as we usually do?
00:02:14.443 - 00:02:25.543, Speaker B: That is just about the spec. Not about our spec. I mean in their spectre using the camel case or the snake. Well, I know what it's called. The underscore is the snake case.
00:02:26.803 - 00:02:36.623, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't remember. But the basic idea is do they have RPC? Any RPC calls bound to this naked case?
00:02:38.864 - 00:02:53.684, Speaker B: There's the block based fee, the eat block based fee, I think, which is a bit annoying that that exists now, but I guess. Is there eat base fee as well? No, that's. You had to get the block to get the base fee. So it's a bit different.
00:02:55.224 - 00:03:36.330, Speaker C: So there's the 4844 or whatever number it was spec itself, which I think in those specs they usually use underscores. So it really depends on who's writing it. That is unrelated to what ends up in the RPC's. The RPCs always end up with. I forget whether it's snake or camel, but they don't necessarily match the casing. That's in the spec itself, if that makes sense. So this is to say we should have ETH simulate match the RPC, the standard RPC casing, whatever that is, regardless of what the 4844 spec says.
00:03:36.330 - 00:03:39.294, Speaker C: And that's normal behavior for how this process works.
00:03:40.154 - 00:03:40.974, Speaker B: All right.
00:03:48.234 - 00:03:56.946, Speaker C: Aduk here I can someone remind me, is Jason RPC for ethereum usually snake or camo? It's been a while.
00:03:57.090 - 00:04:01.034, Speaker A: At least in our one it is usually camel.
00:04:02.094 - 00:04:02.526, Speaker B: Okay.
00:04:02.550 - 00:04:08.874, Speaker C: I believe it's neither mind matches guess for the parameters and whatnot. So I'm guessing that means they're both camel.
00:04:11.094 - 00:04:16.994, Speaker B: That would be bad if the RPC would be. Some of them would be camel and some would be snake. Yeah.
00:04:17.774 - 00:04:25.594, Speaker C: So we'll have ETH simulate match whatever the standard is so it sounds like Camel and it's okay. That doesn't match 4844.
00:04:29.144 - 00:04:38.764, Speaker B: But I hope they will change that. But I know how difficult it could change now afterwards. I guess now it's on some teams list, so I don't know what that means.
00:04:39.144 - 00:04:44.684, Speaker C: Are you talking about the changes that g eleven proposed? Yeah.
00:04:45.704 - 00:04:45.992, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:04:46.008 - 00:04:57.064, Speaker C: So my guess is it sounds like there's no pushback on that. So that one might actually go through to get the renames of those variables to blob. Have blob included?
00:04:58.084 - 00:05:08.464, Speaker B: I am quite surprised if there's no pullback because some of the things will break, I guess because they have been using the wrong names. Unless they will make it so that the board names are there.
00:05:09.444 - 00:05:26.284, Speaker C: So I think that nothing actually uses those yet. Does it? Like there's no communication, there's no communication between clients that uses any of those. It's just some. Something in your code that you would refer to.
00:05:29.304 - 00:05:46.384, Speaker B: Yeah, that's the eid blob get. There's one that will get. But I guess we don't propose to change that. But I don't really care if that was changed. But you of course would be better.
00:05:47.284 - 00:05:58.104, Speaker C: I think the key is you just propose your spec change right around when everybody is exhausted from pushing to get a release and then no one will push back on your proposal. So like I'm just too tired.
00:05:59.164 - 00:06:04.864, Speaker B: It sounds like us government getting some random rule through and you just bagged it with the others.
00:06:06.724 - 00:06:09.704, Speaker C: Sure, throw it in as pork with something else.
00:06:16.664 - 00:06:45.194, Speaker B: But I guess after we get this through then we could propose to get that it get blob. Blob. What is the get page fever block that there would be that kind of method, but it could get blob base fee. That's bit confusing. That's named different than it's in that method. But yeah, it's still quite different. Different kind of method.
00:06:46.814 - 00:06:53.274, Speaker D: I'm afraid that will be harder to rename the method if people are already using it.
00:06:54.174 - 00:07:10.924, Speaker B: Yeah, but you could create a new method and then deprecate that old one. And do we have any other updates?
00:07:13.224 - 00:07:22.364, Speaker D: Not much for me. Didn't do a lot of simulate stuff last week but I don't know if there is also a lot to do on my end.
00:07:24.904 - 00:07:37.174, Speaker B: There is no at the moment. I think now when the nethermine is kind of further along then I will do more testing and then I probably will find some bug in the get. If there's going to be some mismatches.
00:07:39.034 - 00:07:44.498, Speaker C: You could release the mainnet. Oh yeah, that's one easy one main line.
00:07:44.546 - 00:07:45.254, Speaker B: I mean.
00:07:46.154 - 00:07:52.962, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean ideally we should freeze this pick before we merge.
00:07:53.058 - 00:07:59.354, Speaker C: Yeah, I've been out for a while. Have we made any significant changes to the spec recently?
00:08:00.134 - 00:08:01.114, Speaker D: Last week.
00:08:02.174 - 00:08:03.394, Speaker C: Oh okay.
00:08:05.534 - 00:08:21.814, Speaker B: But we're just renaming a couple of things and then one unit Corvette to 64.6. So quite small ones but they are still somewhat breaking. Naming one is quite breaking if they.
00:08:23.714 - 00:08:37.994, Speaker C: My guest server ran out of its 1.8 terabyte drive and so I wiped the database and started over. So we have until that runs out of disk space again. I think my nethermind server also is going to run out of disk space and so hopefully I can, this will.
00:08:37.994 - 00:08:38.682, Speaker B: Be the last time I have to.
00:08:38.698 - 00:08:46.654, Speaker C: Wipe it before I can just outsource to some third party. But need to get into the main clients to do that. That's why I want it.
00:08:47.294 - 00:08:48.634, Speaker D: Yeah, hopefully soon.
00:08:52.854 - 00:09:01.194, Speaker B: Is the get changes reviewed by other get developers so they would be kind of easy to get. So there's no missing processes for those.
00:09:02.414 - 00:09:30.624, Speaker D: Usually reviewed by two people. But yeah, I mean now ish is a good time because the hard fork is over. So like we are merging more stuff. Like I had one big pr merge last week so there's more appetite for getting big changes in.
00:09:37.884 - 00:09:49.884, Speaker B: Actually is this change done in get that we renamed the validator index for camel case to that. Or I wonder, wonder was it like that in get before it was just, just a bug in the spec and it would, didn't change the get.
00:09:50.744 - 00:09:53.084, Speaker D: We were on camel case I believe.
00:09:54.544 - 00:10:19.864, Speaker B: Okay, so that was just a bug in the spec. Okay. So kind of we didn't change anything and then I removed the blob page fee from the header because it wasn't part of there and I guess get wasn't returning that anyway, because it wasn't there for long.
00:10:22.524 - 00:10:25.344, Speaker D: The blob phase fee.
00:10:27.164 - 00:10:38.924, Speaker B: Yeah. So when you're, it's returning, then I added that we are also returning the blob face fee as. Yes, in the block. But then I removed as it wasn't actually part of the block.
00:10:39.744 - 00:10:41.124, Speaker A: So where it is now.
00:10:43.104 - 00:11:00.034, Speaker B: You can set it, but it's not returned as an object. That's because it's not part of the header. You can override blob base fee, but you cannot see what it was, what it is for the block.
00:11:04.254 - 00:11:05.110, Speaker D: Okay.
00:11:05.262 - 00:11:08.434, Speaker A: Then we'll need to remove it from at least our implementation.
00:11:10.254 - 00:11:12.910, Speaker B: Are you returning it currently?
00:11:12.982 - 00:11:20.126, Speaker A: Yes, probably. I read your standard, like when I implemented it two or three weeks ago. When I implemented it.
00:11:20.150 - 00:11:28.034, Speaker B: Yeah, I added it there because I thought it was a part of the header. But then Sina said it's not there. So then I removed it.
00:11:31.094 - 00:11:45.054, Speaker D: Right. So wait, I haven't renamed it though yet. So we can, we have blob base v as inputs. Yeah, it's called blob base v. It's.
00:11:45.094 - 00:11:48.274, Speaker B: Blob base v. That's the new one.
00:11:48.574 - 00:11:50.750, Speaker D: Blob base voice.
00:11:50.782 - 00:12:03.484, Speaker B: No, base vapor. Oh yeah, it is that. Yeah, because we are waiting for that thing and I should, I think we should keep it what it is at the moment. Unless they change it in the spec.
00:12:03.864 - 00:12:04.764, Speaker D: Okay.
00:12:05.544 - 00:12:52.924, Speaker B: Yeah. So that's maybe something that we need still to do the change. If we can get that change through. But I don't know what's the timeline? Is it someone going to discuss about it? It's on the team's list here. I'm not sure exactly what does mean that's there. They want to move that spec to final, but then it has some, it's listed there as a clarification. So maybe it's coming there or not, but let's wait for it.
00:12:52.924 - 00:13:17.144, Speaker B: Okay. As Lucas had time to look at the validator, different differences and the validation mode. Not really. Oh, maybe you can do that. It looks like I want.
00:13:18.044 - 00:13:45.614, Speaker A: Yeah, I think as soon as we'll push today's docker image we'll be able to look at them. And now we have like cleared out the basic things that definitely happen before the block is published. So we know for sure what happens to each transaction in what order. And it will be like fast passed write out. So I'll do it probably later today. All right. And you'll be able all to look at it.
00:13:47.274 - 00:13:56.054, Speaker B: Sounds good. Have you been running the test? If there are more matching with get with the hash level?
00:13:57.714 - 00:14:00.334, Speaker A: Not yet. We have not done that yet.
00:14:04.814 - 00:14:10.726, Speaker B: Well, I guess we don't have anything else. Starting schedule. Yes.
00:14:10.830 - 00:14:11.954, Speaker A: Thank you all, guys.
00:14:13.334 - 00:14:14.314, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:14:15.134 - 00:14:15.734, Speaker D: Thanks.
00:14:15.854 - 00:14:16.430, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:14:16.502 - 00:14:18.554, Speaker C: Bye bye.
