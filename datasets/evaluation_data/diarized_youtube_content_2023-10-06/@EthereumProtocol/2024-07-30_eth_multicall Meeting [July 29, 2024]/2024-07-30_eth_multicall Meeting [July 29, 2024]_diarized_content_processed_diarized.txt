00:00:01.240 - 00:00:02.965, Speaker A: All right, so shall we begin?
00:00:03.865 - 00:00:04.685, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:05.545 - 00:00:40.415, Speaker A: So from my side, I finally got to update functionality on the. On the Blob base fee. So it's now settable and we'll finish the merge conflicts and we'll push out an image today or early tomorrow. So that's it with us. So this was the last, I think like major part of functionality that we were missing. And after that I'll be able to clean up all the rest, like minor issues that we had. That's it.
00:00:42.235 - 00:00:43.655, Speaker B: I don't have any updates.
00:00:45.235 - 00:01:13.315, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks. Same here. Just that the one PR that I depended on, it got merged, but. Yeah, but some people from the team are now on vacation, so. Yeah, we have to see when people will have time to take a look at it.
00:01:17.065 - 00:01:27.765, Speaker A: Yeah, perfect. So you are basically one PR from being like mergeable into the guest main. Net. Yeah, guest main.
00:01:29.505 - 00:01:43.975, Speaker C: Basically right now my pr, the main pr, it just has to be reviewed and possibly merged. And if by that time we find more issues, then I will fix them. Otherwise I think it's ready.
00:01:47.115 - 00:01:48.215, Speaker A: Yeah, perfect.
00:01:50.475 - 00:02:00.859, Speaker B: If there's a new version of the Nethermite, then I could test against get again and see if there's differences. And I'm expecting there still to be some differences, so be nice to tackle those two.
00:02:00.987 - 00:02:04.575, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll ping you up as soon as I'll push it out.
00:02:06.395 - 00:02:11.185, Speaker B: Nice. Do we have any anything to discuss?
00:02:12.325 - 00:02:19.145, Speaker A: Maybe we could ask our new friend that joined. When will be the podcast out?
00:02:21.245 - 00:02:23.345, Speaker B: I don't know if anyone knows about it.
00:02:23.685 - 00:02:31.785, Speaker D: I think Pooja said it's ready, will be released shortly. I'm guessing that means this week.
00:02:32.845 - 00:02:36.105, Speaker B: I think it must be said that would be this week.
00:02:43.285 - 00:02:45.825, Speaker D: Yeah. The Peep and Eat podcast.
00:03:28.705 - 00:03:32.525, Speaker A: Would you share the link on Telegram?
00:03:34.425 - 00:03:36.005, Speaker B: I can share Dashboard.
00:03:45.025 - 00:03:48.125, Speaker D: Wait, why did you guys have two different links? Are those different things?
00:03:48.825 - 00:03:51.285, Speaker A: No, they're same with different tails.
00:03:53.435 - 00:03:56.055, Speaker B: Yeah, there's the tracking code.
00:03:58.915 - 00:03:59.695, Speaker D: Sorry.
00:04:03.875 - 00:04:05.335, Speaker A: All right, perfect.
00:04:08.675 - 00:04:15.255, Speaker D: So sounds like we're close to done with all of this. Fingers crossed.
00:04:19.725 - 00:04:35.405, Speaker B: Well, I'm expecting there to be more things to do when the OLEG gets a new version out. Then I can again compare the clients to each other. And at least I'm expecting that the hashes will be different in some cases and that's probably something that we need to debug at some point.
00:04:35.565 - 00:04:55.845, Speaker A: Yeah, and by the way, if you would be able to list the cases when they are the same, that would be also like potentially quite informative. We will be able to list that like list of cases where people may be sure that if you do this and that you can be sure that hashes are reliably same.
00:04:56.825 - 00:05:14.875, Speaker B: Yeah. And before, there were still a lot of differences on the that the output of the it simulated. Those variables that were included were a bit different. That also caused a lot error almost of the test failing because those were different. But maybe that's fixed now.
00:05:16.135 - 00:05:18.023, Speaker A: Yep. All right.
00:05:18.159 - 00:05:22.235, Speaker B: That was because we added huge amount of those in the quite somewhat recently.
00:05:24.455 - 00:05:26.795, Speaker A: Okay. Do we have anything else for today?
00:05:28.375 - 00:05:29.315, Speaker B: I do not.
00:05:30.655 - 00:05:35.391, Speaker A: If not. Thank you all and I'll bring you all soon. Thank you.
00:05:35.583 - 00:05:36.079, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:05:36.127 - 00:05:36.383, Speaker D: Thanks.
00:05:36.439 - 00:05:37.071, Speaker B: Bye.
00:05:37.223 - 00:05:37.663, Speaker A: Okay.
00:05:37.719 - 00:05:37.975, Speaker D: Thank you.
