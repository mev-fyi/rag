00:00:23.750 - 00:00:43.186, Speaker A: Thank you very much. So yeah, presenting colony. I apologize in advance. I'm probably going to be quite shit at this today. I'm very tired. Just got back from consensus. I don't know if any of you have heard, but we were representing for Ethereum at the startup competition there where we won, so.
00:00:43.288 - 00:00:45.700, Speaker B: Fuck yeah. Thank you.
00:00:48.070 - 00:01:24.800, Speaker A: So try and explain a bit about this, talk a bit about dows and what we're doing specifically within that space. But as this is such a completely nebulous term, we should probably start with a bit of nomenclature. I'm just going to use the term dow, but there are so many other different terms and even though I'm working in this space, I've got no idea what the differences are between them. People try to put some different terminology around them. So I'm just going to stick to that after exploring a little bit around.
00:01:25.730 - 00:01:26.654, Speaker C: The beginnings of it.
00:01:26.692 - 00:02:23.380, Speaker A: So type of decentralized application which incentivizes people to do some stuff that they all agree on without there being any central point of authority that coerces them to do so. So sounds like some techno bullshit, but there's lots of them, obviously, that you're already familiar with given the audience. But the prototypical version, I would argue, was bitcoin. Probably don't need to explain that any further, I'd imagine. But Auger is another really good example. And the interesting thing about these is that they provide those kind of incentives without there being any central authority that forces them to do the work. But what they can do is entirely based on what the developers of that system defined that it could do.
00:02:23.380 - 00:03:50.400, Speaker A: So then we moved on quite some considerable distance with our esteemed colleague and his team over here in the DAO, which is obviously, as you know, being funded at the moment is doing awesome stuff, great thing, and its role is pretty much to act. I mean, correct me if I'm wrong if I misstep at any point in saying this, but it's pretty much to act as a sort of amazing seed fund that helps to finance the future of the Ethereum network with a business model. And what that allows people to do is to collectively create it. There is no issuer. The Dow is issuing its own tokens when people volunteer to participate in it, and people are able to make proposals, and then people are simply able to vote according to their ownership on whether or not they would like that proposal to be funded. Presumably most of the proposals are going to include some kind of promise of what a revenue stream is going to look like or what benefit that the Dow is going to receive, and that will be distributed amongst all of the people who own the Dow tokens. Missed out anything good? Cool.
00:03:50.400 - 00:04:51.294, Speaker A: So that's amazing. And hopefully what we're doing is going to be very complementary to that, and maybe we'll even be able to integrate it. So what we think of colony as being is something that the slocky guys called a pure doubt, or true doubt, I suppose, which is something which goes beyond it being decision making, like a board level governance kind of mechanism. So encapsulates governance, but also management as well. And when I say management, I actually don't mean management, I just mean getting shit done in the same kind of non coercive, collaborative, incentivized way. So enables you to build companies with people from all over the world without needing to trust any of those other people and earn ownership rather than by purchasing the tokens, but by doing work.
00:04:51.332 - 00:04:54.210, Speaker C: Although you could also, of course, purchase tokens.
00:04:56.310 - 00:06:07.978, Speaker A: Yeah, companies which can move at the speed of mean. Why do we have companies still which are hierarchical and slow and riddled with single points of failure, when we are able to communicate so much more quickly internationally? And it seems like there are many different organizational approaches which are starting to take hold, which recognize that as companies scale, it's becoming increasingly difficult for them to keep up with the speed with which the market changes nowadays. So Colne is a self organizing framework for organizations on the Internet. It covers governance, as I mentioned, and not management. So, creation of tasks, decision about what stuff needs to get done, the coordination of all of the people who are participating in that, the quality control, remuneration and resolution of disputes. So, as I mentioned, there's no real concept of hierarchy. It's a difficult thing to pin down.
00:06:08.064 - 00:06:11.610, Speaker C: When all you've got is addresses, essentially.
00:06:12.910 - 00:07:28.180, Speaker A: So influence or hierarchy is emergent. It's a consequence of your ownership, of how trusted you are and what kind of merits you've developed as a consequence of your behavior. And it facilitates complex decision making and distributed authority. So if you imagine in the organizations in which you all work, if everything that you ever did, you had to have consensus with the entire organization, decisions to buy a new notepad might take longer than you'd ideally like. So what colony allows is a sort of permissive approach by default, which uses, I suppose, game theoretic or crypto economic approaches to ensuring that people are heavily disincentivized from trying to defraud the rest of the group. So the structure of colony is basically in two lumps. We've got the network, which we loosely calling root colony at the moment, thanks to rune from maker for that name.
00:07:28.180 - 00:08:14.142, Speaker A: And that is an open source network of contracts which is available for developers, or rather will be available for developers who want to build any kind of DaO. If you want to build an insurance dow, you could do that. If you want to build, let's say, a collaborative blogging platform wherein the editing and the creation of content and the revenue gets split between everybody, you could do that too. So very much a modular toolkit. We are also building an application, which is our idea of what a good interface to a DAO would look like. And I'll get into that in a minute. But it's a DAO in the box.
00:08:14.142 - 00:08:24.580, Speaker A: It's very, very generic. You could use it for doing any of the things that I previously mentioned. And it will be as easy to start a colony as it is to start a Facebook group.
00:08:26.250 - 00:08:31.510, Speaker C: So hopefully that's going to mean that quite a few people are getting into the Ethereum ecosystem.
00:08:33.130 - 00:08:54.766, Speaker A: So how it works in practice is you can find projects that you're interested in, do work, get paid for doing that work, earn some reputation based on how valuable what you've done was and what the other people who already held reputation thought of it. And the more reputation you have, the.
00:08:54.788 - 00:08:59.360, Speaker C: More influence you have over how other things happen.
00:09:01.090 - 00:09:21.766, Speaker A: So this is what it looks like at the moment. It's going to be pretty familiar to anybody who's used to using things like Trello or Asana. It's basically based on Kanban like principles. It will be for both web and mobile. And this importantly is just a dumb front end. It does not touch any of the.
00:09:21.788 - 00:09:28.650, Speaker C: Logic whatsoever which goes on. It doesn't need to operate through a mist, it will work on any current browser.
00:09:31.950 - 00:10:02.738, Speaker A: So I'd mentioned the network calling that a root colony at the moment. And so that network owns, or that colony owns and operates the network. It will provide various services to the network, including arbitration of disputes, third party arbitration of disputes, and ideally something we're working on at the moment is to enable that to provide a sort of distributed oracle service which will bring in external data.
00:10:02.824 - 00:10:06.760, Speaker C: But don't ask me any questions about that because that's far too early.
00:10:09.050 - 00:10:32.560, Speaker A: It will provide services and it will collect fees. So every time a bounty is distributed to somebody for doing some piece of work, there will be a fee which the root colony will decide on what that fee is, and that fee gets distributed to all of the people who own the root colony tokens. And that distribution will happen later in the year.
00:10:33.570 - 00:10:34.430, Speaker C: This is us.
00:10:34.500 - 00:10:52.626, Speaker A: We are the team. Colin. He formerly founded a company called Virtual, which was a fully distributed team, grew to 450 people before it was sold last year. Dr. Alex came from his following his.
00:10:52.648 - 00:10:54.750, Speaker C: Phd at Cambridge and the rest of.
00:10:54.840 - 00:10:57.350, Speaker A: The engineering team, who are all awesome.
00:10:57.500 - 00:10:59.366, Speaker C: And I'm the dog's body that sort.
00:10:59.388 - 00:11:57.054, Speaker A: Of does everything that nobody else knows how to do. Our roadmap is we're just a few weeks away from having a live mvp, which we've got about 470 ish people lined up to start using. And what transpired when we've done this beta intake form to get those 470 people was that one of the most appropriate initial use cases appears to be companies who are like digital agencies. They're dev shops, design agencies, and so on, because they're typically quite small organizations who manage lots of external contractors, and they want to be able to open their organizations up a bit more, get those people more involved without actually increasing.
00:11:57.122 - 00:12:00.300, Speaker C: The number of employees that they have.
00:12:01.870 - 00:13:12.394, Speaker A: So we think that that's a really interesting beachhead for creating organizations like this, because when it gets to full Taoism somewhere down the road, it means that rather than you having thousands of dreamers throwing shit at the wall, like you get on a lot of things, you'll start off with a core group of people who are actually doing valuable stuff and who are vetted by the organizations who brought them on board as being of quality. So what are the challenges around dows? There's two big ones, really, regulation and the law in general. Token issues, token issuances, token sales, initial coin offerings, whatever you want to call them, are thrown around with abandon in this space. There have been so many, and the vast majority of them are absolute and flagrant securities issuances, which is a very, very dangerous thing to get involved with. Some people have very cleverly sidestepped that.
00:13:12.512 - 00:13:16.398, Speaker C: Others have not been quite so smart. And we're going to see what's going.
00:13:16.404 - 00:13:53.074, Speaker A: To happen a little bit down the road where that's concerned. The other challenges are around legacy organizations. So how can a dow, which looks, feels, smells like a company, but actually isn't a company, how can that interact with the real world? And what status do the people who participate in the DAO find themselves in? According to my understanding, and if there's any lawyers in the room, please speak up about this afterwards. It would be an unincorporated association.
00:13:53.122 - 00:13:55.018, Speaker C: It would be like a partnership, a.
00:13:55.024 - 00:14:04.778, Speaker A: General partnership, wherein all of the people who participate in the Dow, bearing in mind you don't know who the other people who in the Dow are jointly.
00:14:04.794 - 00:14:08.362, Speaker C: And severally liable for everybody else's actions.
00:14:08.426 - 00:14:23.970, Speaker A: Which sounds not ideal. So, yeah, we'll have to see how we figure that one out. There we go. That is us. Join us on slack. Come and get involved in the conversation. And, yeah, hit me up.
00:14:24.040 - 00:14:25.140, Speaker C: Ask me some questions.
00:14:38.810 - 00:14:56.026, Speaker D: So this is really a general Dow question, but I'm hoping you've solved it. How do you stop a 51% attack on the Dow where, say, I invest enough to gain 51% of the shares, or I buy out the shares at a later date, and then I put a proposal in to send all the money to myself?
00:14:56.128 - 00:15:00.030, Speaker C: Fortunately, I don't need to have solved that, because the slocket guys have sold it.
00:15:00.100 - 00:15:00.894, Speaker D: They have sold it.
00:15:00.932 - 00:15:02.000, Speaker C: They've sold it.
00:15:02.610 - 00:15:04.970, Speaker A: So what they've done has been audited.
00:15:05.050 - 00:15:15.586, Speaker C: We'll copy it. Thanks.
00:15:15.688 - 00:15:18.446, Speaker A: So I saw that you said bitcoin.
00:15:18.478 - 00:16:08.530, Speaker C: And token payments will be available, but also fiat currency. So how is that verified? So that is not something which is an on chain activity. We'd like that to be. If there's anybody again in this room who's doing anything like that, let me know. But that is more for this initial beachhead of people who actually couldn't give a monkeys about it being on a blockchain. They would rather it not be on a blockchain because they wouldn't have to deal with any of the limitations around it. And so for those people, we're offering things on a private chain, and we'll be offering some kind of integration with something like stripe or something else, which will facilitate their ability to have payments come in from their clients who are paying them in pound, shillings and Pence and getting dispersed to all of their people.
00:16:08.530 - 00:16:16.870, Speaker C: But it's not a Dow functionality. Exactly. Maybe it will be in the future. Somebody clever comes up with the solution.
00:16:26.910 - 00:16:49.102, Speaker E: So my question is sort of about the structure of a Dow in terms of the voting. And do you think that a Dow is suitable for the majority of forms of organization, or do you think that organizations often require a strong leader or a strong single person who can sort of drive it forwards? So how do you avoid the tragedy of the committee?
00:16:49.246 - 00:17:25.198, Speaker C: Interesting. I don't think that they are actually mutually exclusive concepts. I think that the immediate thing that gets jumped to a lot of the time is, okay, there is no central authority. That means there's no leadership. And that really isn't true of open source projects. For example, I think that the leadership, rather than being, what's the word, passed down, like, conferred upon people, is in fact emergent based on the merit that people demonstrate, and I think that's probably a healthier way to go about it. Obviously.
00:17:25.198 - 00:17:36.560, Speaker C: However, that is a pretty crazy concept, that people should be leaders based on their qualities rather than just some arbitrary political reason.
00:17:42.960 - 00:17:53.556, Speaker F: Hi Jack. I'm one of the 470 people who put in a submission for the price beta. But do I understand that you're restricting that to digital agencies opening?
00:17:53.688 - 00:18:22.132, Speaker C: It's not being restricted, it's that those are the people that we are initially wanting to work with or trying to work with on the basis that they're probably going to be our hardest customers to please. If we do please them, then we'll have got functionality which is very, very useful to other people as well. Okay. And we want to be able to manage our own resources. We're a small team, so we can't.
00:18:22.196 - 00:18:24.184, Speaker A: Really just give it to everybody because.
00:18:24.222 - 00:18:32.200, Speaker C: The amount of feedback that we'll get will just be overwhelming. So we want to three people, five people, and so on and so forth.
00:18:32.280 - 00:18:32.812, Speaker F: Okay.
00:18:32.946 - 00:18:34.588, Speaker C: Solving issues as we go. Cool.
00:18:34.674 - 00:18:35.308, Speaker F: Thank you.
00:18:35.394 - 00:18:41.296, Speaker C: No worries. Hello. As a way of payment, do you.
00:18:41.318 - 00:18:45.100, Speaker A: Think it will be possible to use other ethereum token?
00:18:45.260 - 00:18:55.330, Speaker C: And I was thinking about the stable coin from dai. Yeah, actually this is, is this public? I don't know.
00:18:56.900 - 00:19:02.324, Speaker A: You will be able to use Dai. Thank you. In fact, you'll be able to use.
00:19:02.362 - 00:19:07.510, Speaker C: Anything which is compatible with the consensus token standard. Thank you.
00:19:17.440 - 00:19:18.190, Speaker G: Thanks.
00:19:19.440 - 00:19:43.040, Speaker H: I work for a development and design shop, so it's almost like a perfect fit. But in the real world, you have to obviously spec the work, find out who's most appropriate to actually do the work, review the work, maybe go through cycles, get it back and then sign it off. So what are the mechanisms for that? If you have this committee or network?
00:19:43.200 - 00:19:43.860, Speaker C: Let's answer.
00:19:43.930 - 00:19:49.368, Speaker H: Not everyone's appropriate for evaluating the work that's done.
00:19:49.534 - 00:19:55.592, Speaker C: Right. Let's get into it. So are you familiar with Trello Asana, stuff like that?
00:19:55.646 - 00:19:56.036, Speaker H: Trello?
00:19:56.068 - 00:20:06.620, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay, so this is probably most similar to Trello. Actually create a card like the highest level of what that task is that needs to be delivered.
00:20:07.600 - 00:20:09.324, Speaker A: This will enable you to open something.
00:20:09.362 - 00:20:20.610, Speaker C: Like this, which will enable you to create your very detailed brief about it. You'll be able to add some tags, which are the specific skills that are necessary. And everybody within their profile has got skills that they claim to have.
00:20:23.700 - 00:20:24.112, Speaker A: Rather.
00:20:24.166 - 00:21:14.630, Speaker C: Than you then thinking, who can I get involved to do this? The system will automatically notify the people via whatever channels you select that there is something that is potentially pertinent for them. So if you've got a slack team, for example, that you've got all your people in it, will have a slack bot that will tell all those people, they'll be able to come on, they'll be able to claim it, or you'll be able to assign it to somebody. You will then be able to also manage the whole of the conversation around that specific task within this panel. And once that task is completed, you'll be able to make the payment from that panel in due course. It will also generate all the necessary compliant paperwork that you'll need for both sides. So you'll get invoices, you'll be able to provide receipt, payment, do all that stuff.
00:21:15.400 - 00:21:22.630, Speaker H: Okay, but sorry, it's still a network of people who are wanting to do a project.
00:21:23.960 - 00:21:42.700, Speaker C: It's a network of people that if you're creating it as your own dev shop, you will be able to specify who those people are. Right. So it's not just an undifferentiated mass of minions who you don't know who they are. It doesn't have to be that way. He can be, but doesn't have to be.
00:21:42.850 - 00:22:05.060, Speaker B: Okay, thank you. So I have a question. So how does it work on mobile? Because as far as I know, the ethereum nodes cannot work on mobile. That's one question. And the second is, what's the difference between your project and bitnation?
00:22:05.400 - 00:22:39.064, Speaker C: And bitnation? Right, okay, so first question is that you don't have to be running a geth node for any of this. This communicates with a hosted geth node. You don't have to use our hosted geth node. You can also choose to run your own local one. If you don't even trust us to hold your encrypted keys, that's fine. How do we differ from bitnation? Is that bitnation is. I mean, it's not really designed for project management.
00:22:39.064 - 00:22:44.050, Speaker C: It's not designed for starting a company. It's something else.
00:22:47.220 - 00:22:48.930, Speaker B: And one last question.
00:22:50.020 - 00:22:53.532, Speaker C: I think we've got two competing questions. One at the front, one at the back.
00:22:53.606 - 00:22:55.590, Speaker B: Okay, we'll do two questions.
00:22:56.120 - 00:22:56.852, Speaker A: You were first.
00:22:56.906 - 00:22:57.910, Speaker C: You were first.
00:22:58.440 - 00:22:59.696, Speaker A: Just shout really loudly.
00:22:59.728 - 00:23:00.630, Speaker C: It'll be fine.
00:23:03.640 - 00:23:16.708, Speaker I: Okay, so just building on the question before last, so if I had a small development team using Trello, could I then migrate from using Trello to your product, first of all, as a Trello replacement?
00:23:16.804 - 00:23:17.448, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:23:17.614 - 00:23:37.980, Speaker I: And then if I'm working on a project and it grows outside the bounds of my team's skills or capabilities, is your USP, then unlocking a bigger pool of potential resource that then I could go outside of that team and very quickly, in kind of an easy, scalable way, get another visual designer, someone, an additional person to help out with CSS, et cetera.
00:23:38.060 - 00:23:40.080, Speaker C: Exactly. Okay, neat.
00:23:49.380 - 00:24:31.368, Speaker G: I have in fact two questions. The first one is this kind of platform exists already, so I want to know how you differentiate yours from theirs. Like fivers and platforms like that, where you can actually say, I've got a work to be done, and you pitch and you just essentially get the job done. And you even decide on logo, for example, or which one you prefer. You select three people out of 30 and you select the last one and then you get your illustrator of Photoshop. So that's one thing. The second thing is my mate is the CTO of bounty factory and they're not live yet, but he's also on the ball of yes, we hack.
00:24:31.368 - 00:25:06.936, Speaker G: Yes, we hack with an h. And I'm wondering how colony, for example, for a project like that could help. Essentially what they do is they have a bounty, if you want, for security audit for things like that. And they say, okay, you come with a problem and we will essentially try to solve it. What they have to build in order to set up this business and make it run is a payment platform and a platform in general to set up all those problems. That could be that, but I'm wondering if this is one of the use case.
00:25:07.118 - 00:26:08.504, Speaker C: It could well be the way it differs from any of the other crowdsourcing platforms like fiverr people per hour, weWork, or indeed any of the other bounty type platforms like Kaggle and innocentive and stuff of that nature. Sorry, bounty source. Yeah, there's loads of them. The way it differs from those is that those are external tasks, external projects which are managed by an individual. This is designed in the first instance, which is the first very most limited case to be like an incentivized open source within a not in open source. Does anybody know assembly? No, a couple of people. So assembly was basically based on open source model of you having some people who are core developers or core members of the team and then loads of participants.
00:26:08.632 - 00:26:11.676, Speaker A: But critically, you could be part of.
00:26:11.698 - 00:27:18.300, Speaker C: The organization on an ad hoc basis. That's not true of something like upwork or fiver, where somebody posts the task that they want done and then that one person, it's a relationship between two people. Essentially this is a relationship wherein you are participating in an organization, you are a regular contributor to a design agency, to a company of some description. So it removes an enormous amount of the onboarding and relationship creation, the transactional costs which are inherent to working with freelancers. So that's really its purpose. And where it differs from assembly, apart from the fact that assembly was absolutely shockingly awful for project management, is that assembly died and it took down everything with it. We could die, but smart contract network upon which our application is being built can't die.
00:27:18.300 - 00:27:40.490, Speaker C: And so we very much encourage other people to build competing interfaces which interact with the same smart contract network, such that there is never that risk. You do not have to worry if you're going to build your organization on top of colony as to what happens if we go away, just like you don't need to worry what happens if the country goes away.
00:27:42.940 - 00:27:43.690, Speaker G: Okay.
00:27:47.020 - 00:27:52.250, Speaker C: Usually that seems like it might be a worrying point to end on.
00:27:53.180 - 00:27:54.200, Speaker B: Okay, thank you.
00:27:54.270 - 00:27:55.670, Speaker C: Pleasure. Thank.
