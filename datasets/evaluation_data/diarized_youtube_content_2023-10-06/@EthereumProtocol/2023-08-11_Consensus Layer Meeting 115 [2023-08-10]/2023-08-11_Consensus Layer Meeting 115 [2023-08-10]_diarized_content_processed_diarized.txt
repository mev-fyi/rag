00:00:22.710 - 00:00:25.898, Speaker A: You all right?
00:00:25.984 - 00:00:46.438, Speaker B: Hey, guys. Yeah. So today I will be covering the Oprah dev core. This is meeting one one five. Copy and paste in the agenda here. Let's see. Okay, so first on the list is definite eight status.
00:00:46.438 - 00:01:22.780, Speaker B: So as far as we know, definite seven has been tore down. So definite a is the next one. So from the last meeting, even on Monday's danet testing code, it sounds like it was blocked by four seven eight. But then we made a decision to not block by four seven eight. So I guess in terms of client status, when are we comfortable with Devnet eight start date? Yeah, does anyone want to give an update here?
00:01:27.230 - 00:01:30.570, Speaker C: So maybe we can just start from testing?
00:01:31.970 - 00:01:32.334, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:32.372 - 00:01:55.830, Speaker C: So I've posted a link for Hive. I think most of the. Can we mute Matt somehow? Yeah. So from the hive perspective, I don't know if Mario's here. He isn't, so. Ok, I can just cover it for now. There were a couple of config issues.
00:01:55.830 - 00:02:27.040, Speaker C: Those have all been fixed now. And you can see that most of the tests are indeed passing. So Barnabas and I are now just working on getting on updating our local testing tools and we'll just post a link on how different client teams can just make sure that there's no inconsistencies. And in the meantime, if the client teams themselves are feeling confident, then we're happy to start planning it and launch it early next week.
00:02:28.870 - 00:02:56.196, Speaker B: Sounds good. Does any client team have an objection with the timeline that is early next week? All right, sounds good. Sounds like that's easy. We'll do definite eight early next week. And Barnabitz just asked our clients somewhere. Ready, I guess I can speak for prism. Yes, we are ready.
00:02:56.196 - 00:03:02.110, Speaker B: But yeah, I guess the question is, is any client that's not ready for early next week.
00:03:08.780 - 00:03:17.630, Speaker D: With Ericon? We are still working on fixing the hive test, so we might be ready, but it's not certain.
00:03:20.000 - 00:03:21.900, Speaker B: Okay, thanks for the update.
00:03:22.400 - 00:03:26.640, Speaker E: Do we have an image that we could use already for Ergon?
00:03:28.020 - 00:03:48.070, Speaker D: No, not yet, but it will be in our default branch. But it's not working yet. But next week it might be, but I don't know for sure. We'll make an effort, certainly.
00:03:53.200 - 00:04:28.560, Speaker B: Okay, sounds good. Are there anything else we want to cover for definite a before we move on? Okay, I got a thumbs up. Okay, so the next topic is four seven aa. So from my understanding, there's a debate going on between regular contract versus system contract. And the discussion is mostly on the El side. So the Cl side is fairly simple and easy to reason. So I guess the decision by which way to go will be made in the next Acde eco.
00:04:28.560 - 00:05:07.420, Speaker B: So it doesn't make sense to make the decision here, but is there anything that people want to say to push towards further consensus? Okay, team say that already decided for the smart contract. Yeah, I guess I'm just going through the agenda that sounds like we don't want to make a decision here because most of the EL are not. I guess some of the ER are not here. So it seems like it's better to make a decision in the net. Acde eco.
00:05:07.780 - 00:05:08.336, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:08.438 - 00:05:09.520, Speaker F: Can you hear me?
00:05:09.670 - 00:05:10.416, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:10.598 - 00:06:07.410, Speaker F: Okay. Yeah, so we did decide to use a smart contract rather than a recompile and light science has a pr for that. The thing we still need input from the El team for, and that it would be good to decide by the next Acde, is how we deploy that contract. Whether we just deploy it with like a regular transaction for the fork, or if we couple it with the fork so that during the fork activation we also do a contract deployment. That seems to be the biggest question. And then as for the actual contract code, light client TR has a first pass at it if people want to review that and potentially suggest improvements or optimizations. We're also starting to reach out to auditors to formally review the byte code to make sure that it sounds.
00:06:09.780 - 00:06:17.590, Speaker B: So script. Thanks for the update team and Matt. Anything else you just want to cover here or from anyone else?
00:06:22.840 - 00:06:23.300, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:06:23.370 - 00:06:52.984, Speaker B: It looks like the hype change already as well. There is a hype issue 8118. Thank you Mario. Okay, so next on the topic is the four choice filter change for confirmation rule. That is pr or issue 3431. So the TLDR is that there is a new four choice filtering change. It's a simple two liner, it's a refractor, it has new tests.
00:06:52.984 - 00:07:17.510, Speaker B: So there is some debate on whether to support changing for choice logic at the specific boundary as a part of the net release so we can group them as close as possible versus do not enforce. May Cal or anyone have any input for this PR or issue?
00:07:25.790 - 00:07:46.260, Speaker E: From the comments that are in this issue, I can conclude there is a slight preference and not to implement the strict forking logic here and just make this change into the DenP release of the clients. So.
00:07:49.830 - 00:07:59.960, Speaker B: Right. And even with the release, we can assume most clients release will be grouped together within like two to three weeks. So yeah.
00:08:04.090 - 00:08:13.900, Speaker E: And the question is, is there any concerns with this way of making this change?
00:08:25.240 - 00:08:37.800, Speaker B: POTUS is not here. I was talking to POTUS and seems like Prism may have this change implemented already, so there's something to double check within prism. But yeah, does any other CL team have any concerns or input?
00:08:40.780 - 00:09:03.520, Speaker G: I'll just say from Lighthouse, supporting the change at the epoch boundary is something we would be able to do if people do have preference for that. As far as whether we should, I personally would have to dig into the change itself more to understand if there's any risk in not doing it at an epoch.
00:09:08.830 - 00:09:59.160, Speaker H: For Teku, I think I already shared that we would have a slight preference for not forking out a specific epoch, but releasing a version prior to the Deneb upgrade that supports the new fork choice, just because it's a tiny reduction in complexity to do so. And it just makes testing and all of that more straightforward. Having a sense for the risks that that would open up. There would be a very short window of time where potentially clients have there are multiple versions of the fork choice out there. The circumstances in which that could cause trouble seem to me very remote, but I don't know if anyone has a better sense for that than I do.
00:10:05.080 - 00:10:41.010, Speaker E: Yeah, I think that the probability that something happens on the main net that will cause a split between the clients that have this upgrade and between those that don't have this upgrade is really low. So it's more an edge case, very much even more edgy on the main net. If there is the preference of the client teams not to activate this on epoch boundary, then this probably the way to go.
00:10:48.010 - 00:11:19.870, Speaker B: So it sounds like there's no strong objection that we can move forward and is there like a pr that to merge based on this? Is that 3431? And there's also test that go with it. So would you say the next set of plan is essentially to approve and merge this PR 3431?
00:11:21.280 - 00:11:40.530, Speaker E: There is the comment from lion, which sounds reasonable to me that we should merge this when the main network epoch for the nope. Is like merge this pr and create test factories for it.
00:11:42.180 - 00:12:20.170, Speaker B: Okay, so sunset we are blocked by the net hard fork epoch and new way, but we do have rough consensus here that this is what we prefer. Okay, sounds good. And next topic is 3472, which is we want to clarify aggregation behavior. It looks like currently clients do things slightly different. Like for example Lodestar aggregate attestation. As attestation comes versus prism it aggregates at 6.5 2nd.
00:12:20.170 - 00:12:34.290, Speaker B: So the motivation of this issue and the spec is so that client could be more consistent is pop here. Do you want to give like a high level intro for the pr?
00:12:35.460 - 00:13:37.472, Speaker I: Yes, the motivation is that I noticed that PCM etiquette etiquette, the association that alive only before 6.5 seconds. So for the session that alive between 6.5 and 8 seconds will be not included in the PC etiquette. And that is why we are this PI is to specify specifically that the high end should include all the SSD that arrived before x second. But in my opinion, the high end should not change. The high end should not work too much on implementation to be consistent because I don't think it's worth spending time, but I think it's at least a good idea to be specific in the specification.
00:13:37.616 - 00:14:15.890, Speaker B: Yeah, I tend to agree and I read through the issue. It sounds to me there is just couple points on what language should use because trendy validator spec doesn't really use must and should. Right. And it sounds like it will be nice to start using those keywords more often. And then at the end it sounds like we're agreeing that must and must, meaning that you must aggregate at a second and then you must send. It's kind of impossible because there's always delay. So sometimes it's between shoot versus shoot versus something like that.
00:14:20.670 - 00:14:22.380, Speaker I: Yeah, that makes sense.
00:14:23.710 - 00:14:57.280, Speaker B: Does any client teams have any inputs for this pr? Yeah, if there's no input, I think it sounds to me, yeah, there is some sort of agreement here, so we can just take you to the pr and I don't think POTUS is here. POTUS is the one that's been voicing. But yeah, it sounds to me if today we can use the shoe keyword, not the mouse keyword, we should be able to merge this pr.
00:14:59.330 - 00:14:59.934, Speaker A: But yeah.
00:14:59.972 - 00:15:03.300, Speaker B: Thank you, Paul, for opening the pr. This is great.
00:15:06.780 - 00:15:07.192, Speaker A: Cool.
00:15:07.246 - 00:15:39.568, Speaker B: So the next one is for choice. Proposal boosts incorporation. So this one modified the unblock, so it awards the proposal boost to the first block rather than the last block. So this was part of the postmolton for the RPC unbundling attack that was described in Michael's post, and then such that proposal boost is only set once per slot. And then from the pr it seems like this is safe to roll out gradually. So that's nice. And.
00:15:39.568 - 00:16:13.100, Speaker B: Yeah, does any client team have any input on this 3352? And I believe I've seen a few approval already, so sounds like there is no strong disagreement there, but yeah. Does anyone have any voice or input on this one? Yeah, if there's no input, I think we can merge this by end of this week. Shall we? Yeah, I think that's what we're looking for.
00:16:14.270 - 00:16:15.114, Speaker A: Yes.
00:16:15.312 - 00:16:31.920, Speaker B: Cool. All right, going through the agenda again. Looks like we covered everything. Yeah. Oh, Perry wants to talk about 2 million validator tests. Yeah, Perry, go for it.
00:16:32.610 - 00:16:33.070, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:33.140 - 00:17:09.914, Speaker C: Hey, so the last weeks, last week, week and a half, we've been running these big validator testnets. We've had, I think, three relatively big attempts. The first two weren't that successful. Beacon chain test two was the one we had last week. There's a detailed analysis posted over here. I can send you guys a link to the logs as well as some profiles that we've taken from last week as well. But essentially at the 2.1
00:17:09.914 - 00:18:07.066, Speaker C: million mark, we weren't able to finalize the theory at the moment is that there were too many validator duties, some blocks coming in late, leading to not enough attestations being propagated throughout the network. So even though we were seeing something like 80% proposals, we were only seeing between 40 and 45% of attestations on the network. So we dropped down the overall validator set size to 1.4 million now. And we also dropped the number of keys per node to 3300. And we had the Testnet genesis earlier today, and this testnet Genesis looks successful. We're seeing relatively healthy rates of participation, so hovering around the range of 80% to 90% proposals and similarly 80 to 83, 84% attestations.
00:18:07.066 - 00:18:44.220, Speaker C: So hopefully this testnet is a bit more useful for client teams in order to run profiles on. We leave it up until tomorrow morning. So it would be great if you guys can have a look, if you can collect whatever profiles you need to, and so on. And we'd officially be making the proposal to have a 1.4 million validator set public testnet for Holski. And if there's any reason we shouldn't be doing that, and we shouldn't be creating the Genesis state with that size, then we'd love to hear about it now or over the next week, of course.
00:18:47.950 - 00:18:48.410, Speaker A: Great.
00:18:48.480 - 00:19:13.700, Speaker B: Thanks, perry. Anyone have any updates or feedback questions for Perry? I guess I have a question. Whether is 2 million still the goal that we're working in the background, or are we satisfied with 1.4 million right now?
00:19:17.110 - 00:19:35.462, Speaker C: At the moment, I think I would just go with 1.4 million. I think 2 million would require a decent bit of work from a lot of clients, and we're not necessarily sure if you want to have that in a public test network coordinating. It'll be a lot harder.
00:19:35.606 - 00:19:36.378, Speaker A: Got it.
00:19:36.464 - 00:19:37.340, Speaker B: Makes sense.
00:19:39.070 - 00:19:49.374, Speaker C: Also, we'll have enough ether in the 1.4 million Genesis states to grow it to 2 million eventually. So we just buy more time and do it eventually if we need to.
00:19:49.492 - 00:20:08.260, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes sense. And you would mention that the proposal is about 90%. Surge rate attestation is about 80% to 83%. So the clients that's missing the attestations, do they also know that?
00:20:11.430 - 00:20:23.720, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't think any single client is missing all the attestations. I think it's more of every client isn't able to do 100% of the attestations. They should.
00:20:24.430 - 00:20:25.420, Speaker B: I see.
00:20:27.550 - 00:20:27.914, Speaker A: Cool.
00:20:27.952 - 00:20:35.290, Speaker B: That's great. Yeah. I would encourage people to take a look. And this is happening on the Discord interrupt channel, right?
00:20:35.440 - 00:20:42.720, Speaker C: Yeah, that's right. And everyone who's used to it has access. The IP addresses are in the same place as you always find them.
00:20:43.410 - 00:20:44.334, Speaker A: Great. Yeah.
00:20:44.372 - 00:20:51.470, Speaker B: Thank you, Perry, for the update. Very useful. And thank you. Barnaby just posted the Grafana link as well. That's also very useful.
00:20:51.550 - 00:20:52.594, Speaker E: Thank you, guys.
00:20:52.792 - 00:20:57.490, Speaker B: Anyone have any inputs for the testnet or the testing status?
00:21:03.900 - 00:21:04.312, Speaker A: Cool.
00:21:04.366 - 00:21:27.060, Speaker B: So that is it. From the agenda's perspective, does anyone have any open discussion, closing remarks? Great. Be the shortest, awkward FCO. Thank you for making my job very easy. Yeah. We will talk in two weeks.
00:21:29.030 - 00:21:29.890, Speaker A: Bye.
00:21:30.230 - 00:21:31.278, Speaker B: Thanks, Terrence.
00:21:31.374 - 00:21:32.302, Speaker A: Thank you, guys. Bye.
