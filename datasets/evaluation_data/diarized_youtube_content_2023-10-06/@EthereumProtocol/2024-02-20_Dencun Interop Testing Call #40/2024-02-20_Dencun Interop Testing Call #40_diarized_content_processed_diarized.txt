00:00:01.210 - 00:00:15.760, Speaker A: Cool. I guess we can start. Yeah, maybe anyone from the client teams want to give an update. Where you guys at your releases? Are they already done? Is it planned this week?
00:00:17.490 - 00:00:29.462, Speaker B: Peco already released. We may release another version before mainet. Not sure, but current release is already.
00:00:29.516 - 00:00:30.120, Speaker C: Ready.
00:00:32.730 - 00:00:46.490, Speaker D: Followed star we have already cut our rc and we'll release it either today or tomorrow and we'll basically might have some follow up improvement releases but not really related to Dunnup.
00:00:48.110 - 00:00:56.110, Speaker A: Okay good. Would you guys want us to wait for your follow up release for the main shadowfall or can we go ahead with the RC release?
00:00:57.330 - 00:01:02.750, Speaker D: You can go ahead with the RC release. I can share you the RC version.
00:01:03.590 - 00:01:15.794, Speaker A: Awesome. That sounds good. Do we have any other client team here? Anyone else want to give us an update on releases? Yes.
00:01:15.832 - 00:01:46.640, Speaker E: So Nethermind already released on Friday and on Friday spamming. We found an issue with not keeping capacity of blob pool under heavy spamming. I'm working on it right now and it's likely that after fixing it we will release one more version, but it's not critical. So we released on Friday and there will be no problem if people will go with it. The hard work.
00:01:48.370 - 00:01:57.940, Speaker A: Could you give us an idea on how much you had to spend to qualify spamming? Like how much ether was spent to cause the issue?
00:02:01.670 - 00:02:28.578, Speaker E: When I'm using my spammer, I'm organizing like 500 if from Testnet and using into spam, but I think if I would collect it from accounts at the end, it will still be 300 or 400 left. So the real cost would be lower. And most of these transactions it's possible to send transactions which will not be included.
00:02:28.674 - 00:02:29.222, Speaker A: Really?
00:02:29.356 - 00:02:43.570, Speaker E: So if you send a lot of transactions with Max blob gas equal one, it will probably never be included. But you can spam with it. Hardly.
00:02:45.270 - 00:02:54.580, Speaker A: Got it. Yeah, that makes sense. Thank you. And I think Barnabas was also looking into something with cats on the weekend, right?
00:02:55.750 - 00:03:10.300, Speaker F: Yeah, there was some performance issues. Also regarding blob transactions, their block building took over 2 seconds and some of the blocks were not proposed because of that.
00:03:12.030 - 00:03:12.602, Speaker E: Got it.
00:03:12.656 - 00:03:34.340, Speaker F: There's a fix now and it's been rolled out and it seems to be working. But we've been spamming with the blob fuzzer and it just seemed to be able to recreate the same issue. So it would be nice if we could have another set of large blob spamming experience.
00:03:35.910 - 00:03:49.080, Speaker E: Yeah, I will repeat the Friday experiment for sure. Like for now I'm trying to just fix our issue to test it on already fixed version sounds good.
00:03:51.130 - 00:03:57.160, Speaker A: Awesome. So that probably means there's also another get release over the next week. I guess.
00:03:57.950 - 00:03:59.820, Speaker F: I would assume so, yeah.
00:04:01.950 - 00:04:29.640, Speaker A: I already see it's tagged to the next milestone. Okay, good. I also see there's a Bezu release that's been done web. Three signers done as well. And the other clients are still remaining, I guess. Do we have anyone else from the other Cl teams? I think the Cl teams mainly said they'd be making releases this week.
00:04:37.220 - 00:04:47.510, Speaker F: Yeah, I think Terrence mentioned the prism will be ready in Thursday. Okay, but Casey just joined, so maybe he has an update for us, too.
00:04:50.890 - 00:04:55.062, Speaker A: Just for one text case. You were asking about releases, I see.
00:04:55.116 - 00:05:07.974, Speaker G: Yeah, we are just getting started with know. Actually, I don't have a solid answer for you. We're testing a few things out right now, but that was our original goal.
00:05:08.022 - 00:05:28.900, Speaker A: So hopefully that sounds good. Okay. Was there anything else that was found this week that we want to talk about? Barnabas, you want to maybe give an update on Devnet twelve?
00:05:32.220 - 00:05:49.710, Speaker F: I mean, there's not much happening other than the blob spamming and the geth issue that we found, but we seem to have very high participation rate right now on Devnet twelve, so I think most of the clients are pretty okay.
00:05:55.560 - 00:06:09.076, Speaker A: Yeah, that sounds good. Yeah, I guess that probably means we're still waiting for the client releases. Hopefully that happens this week. And if that does, then we're looking at Mainnet Shadowfok this week. Otherwise we'd be looking at Mainnet Shadowfalk next week.
00:06:09.118 - 00:06:09.708, Speaker H: Right.
00:06:09.874 - 00:06:18.430, Speaker A: And I think Tim wants to wait at least till. Or we agree that we wait at least till the shadow fork is done before the blog post goes out.
00:06:23.120 - 00:06:38.230, Speaker F: Regarding the Shadowfork, it looks like all of the clients have synced up except Aragon. None of the Aragon nodes have synced up and one rest node, but all other pairs seems to be fine.
00:06:39.240 - 00:07:17.170, Speaker A: Yeah, that's good. I think we have similar answer for the girly sync test as well, because that's beyond the blub expiry window. And I think Ericon might still need another d. That's like ten ish percent. So I still give it a day and see what happens there. I see we also have people from some layer tools, right? Could we maybe get an update on. If you guys have started testing blobs? Is everything going okay? I saw there were some governance proposals on optimism, for example.
00:07:19.620 - 00:07:32.724, Speaker C: Yeah, I can give an update on that. So we've made a proposal of governments, I think, three days after Denkun, 18 march so far.
00:07:32.762 - 00:07:33.124, Speaker D: So good.
00:07:33.162 - 00:08:03.960, Speaker C: No objections, but don't know exactly how that's going to turn out. I believe it's Tuesday. We'll be upgrading sepolia to that particular op stack release. This is called the echatone release for op stack. It's already running on op Guerrelli and we've done a couple Devnet hard forks with it as well, so we believe it's ready to go. There may need to be a couple of last minute tweaks, but we don't expect any big changes in it. So overall in pretty good shape.
00:08:03.960 - 00:08:09.650, Speaker C: So this is for both base mainet as well as op Mainet. That would be the March 18 date.
00:08:10.340 - 00:08:46.600, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you. So you were saying something, cannabis, I guess one follow up question I had was I have heard from other people asking as well that traditionally RPC providers have only provided El RPCs. Do you guys have the same problem? And if so, where are you getting the blob data from? Do you know if RPC providers are having issues offering the Beacon API?
00:08:49.180 - 00:09:09.070, Speaker C: We haven't received a lot of feedback on that, to be honest. We run our own RPC providers, our own RPC nodes, so not entirely sure, but we also work with Quicknode and they haven't really expressed any concern about it. But it's possible I'm not in the loop there.
00:09:10.160 - 00:09:14.272, Speaker A: Okay. It might also just be one of those things where they just have to spin it up.
00:09:14.406 - 00:09:15.090, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:09:26.640 - 00:09:41.090, Speaker A: And are you guys already looking at hive Cancun to check for field tests, for example, I think there still are some engine cancun field tests on nethermind for example. Also.
00:09:46.520 - 00:10:09.900, Speaker H: So from Nethermind side, those hypes are known issue not related to Cancun. And the solution is on PR. I think this one, which you link are a little bit outdated. It's not the current result of hive tests.
00:10:14.740 - 00:10:18.640, Speaker F: The image on hive is outdated or hive is outdated.
00:10:20.340 - 00:10:50.830, Speaker H: I'm not sure. We have our workflow and we have totally different results. I think on hive Cancun there was image nevermind Cancun used from Cancun branch and right now we are working master and it still executes very old tests. And I think there was one page which execute the new test. But let me try to find.
00:10:53.940 - 00:10:56.130, Speaker A: I can change the source for sure.
00:10:56.820 - 00:11:01.490, Speaker H: We can ask Mario. Oh, I have this page.
00:11:02.260 - 00:11:09.556, Speaker A: Yeah. I think I should also have access to make deployment change. So it should be easy, it should.
00:11:09.578 - 00:11:24.650, Speaker I: Be running the right tests. I think just there's an issue with running the tests on hive Cancun. When I run locally, there's maybe five. I think it was five test failures for nethermind, but nothing major. I think there were all error code changes.
00:11:27.120 - 00:11:56.028, Speaker H: Error code changes are fixed on branch. It's not merged, but it's totally nothing that we should worry about. And as you can see on this hive test two page. But this is very. No, it's fresh execution. We are passing all of the tests. Hive test two is better than Hive Canton.
00:11:56.028 - 00:11:56.960, Speaker H: Am I correct?
00:11:57.030 - 00:12:05.480, Speaker A: Casser? Yeah, they run on different instances, so definitely.
00:12:07.710 - 00:12:30.190, Speaker I: There'S something weird that's going on that has been a struggle to find out why. Why some of the tests are failing. Maybe it's running the parallelism too high. I think when we overhaul hive and the Hive CI, we'll aim to fix that, but it's not really been a huge priority.
00:12:39.370 - 00:13:46.370, Speaker A: Yeah, sounds good. It also looks like they're running different commits, so it could just be that one of the commits changed something. I think we're still on. No, we're not on a fork. Okay, we can dig into that later, but I guess if people are running it locally in their own Cis, that's the best view of what's going on. Is there any other topic people wanted to bring up today? I don't think there's anything in the agenda besides releases for today. I guess if there's nothing else, then we can end the call.
00:13:46.370 - 00:13:48.290, Speaker A: Have a nice day, everyone.
00:13:49.460 - 00:13:50.304, Speaker I: Thanks.
00:13:50.502 - 00:13:51.436, Speaker A: Cool. Bye.
00:13:51.468 - 00:13:54.140, Speaker I: Thanks, guys. Bye.
