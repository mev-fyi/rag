00:00:16.570 - 00:00:44.214, Speaker A: Hello, my name is Tim Coulter. I'm a developer at consensus. One of the projects that I've been working on is, as you can see, the App Store. I'm going to start this off with a leading question. How many people here have a smartphone? Great. So you pretty much know what I'm going to be presenting on today. So the DAP store, what is it? It's very basic.
00:00:44.214 - 00:01:41.600, Speaker A: It's a marketplace for distributed applications, just like the Apple App Store, Android App Store. But when you get a little bit more detailed, it's also a registry. So it's a place to find things. Why make the DAP store? The general reasons are to promote a DAP economy. So people who are creating dapps or are creating value for the network have a way to get reimbursed for their value, a way to distribute apps or Dapps and provide publicity for them, and then developer support for various features that every developer may not want to write themselves. And I'll get into those in a second. So some of the features that the DAP store have or has is all the things.
00:01:41.600 - 00:02:57.010, Speaker A: The first ones are the basic features, obviously listings of dapps, search, purchases, reviews, other features that it comes with or that provides value to developers. For instance, is onboarding and user acquisition to make that process easy. For instance, a find in the DAP store button, or as you might see with iOS apps, find in the App Store. The one thing that makes this DAP store different than the normal App Stores that you're used to is that you're not actually downloading anything. So what this is actually providing is instead of an economy where you're buying something specific, you're instead buying a license. And so if you get a license for adapt and there's no end date for that license, then it's basically you're buying free to use, not free to use a license that you can use to the end of time, or at least till the app is available. But if you add an end date, then that provides or creates a rental economy, which is possibly beneficial to some DAP developers.
00:02:57.010 - 00:03:43.460, Speaker A: A feature might be tight DAP integration. So when you have this license economy, your DAp can then check the registry, check the license registry and see does this user have a license for my DAP? And if so, then you either let them use the app or you don't. So you can find some access controls across the whole network. Some other things that might be in the future is currency tools. So it's great if you can buy a DAP in ether, but if you're trying to make your DAP attractive to the general public. Maybe you want them to buy in USD. So one possible way that we might provide some value is do that conversion, or at least make that easy.
00:03:43.460 - 00:04:24.346, Speaker A: Another one might be company stores. So if you have a company with many dapps, you might want to brand the DAP store or a portion of the DAP store to your store and be able to advertise your daps. That way, another source of revenue might be ad opportunities. So maybe you want to promote your DAP. If the DAP store becomes a place where anybody or where everybody goes to purchase dapps, then it might be very useful to you to, for instance, place an ad on the front page. We have more ideas. Very short presentation.
00:04:24.346 - 00:05:17.810, Speaker A: I have 15 minutes. So the DAP source, what is it and why? And so now where and when? I'm happy to announce that the DAP store is live now that we released it today at Devcon, so you can find it at DApstore IO. What you need right now, you're going to need an Ethereum node to check it out. We're going to be working on that to make it easier to access a little bit later. But what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and click on this. I know I was told, oops, let's full screen that I was told that I wasn't supposed to be running an go Ethereum node, but right now I am. And so this is actually the live network.
00:05:17.810 - 00:05:43.034, Speaker A: We currently have four apps on it. These are all consensus apps. For instance, I'm going to go ahead and click into BTC relay. And you can see that BTC relay has a description and has some screenshots. What I'm going to do is instead of using the live network to demo this, I will use a local network. And this went away. I full screened it.
00:05:43.034 - 00:06:15.454, Speaker A: Excuse me. No, that's wrong. Exit full screen. So I'm going to go ahead and turn off this go Ethereum node and start up ethersim. Erie and I have worked pretty hard together to make Ethersim better, so I'm really happy about that. And so what I'm going to do, the DAP store is a truffle dap. So I'm going to go ahead and deploy it to ether sims.
00:06:15.454 - 00:06:38.410, Speaker A: So truffle deploy. And what's going to happen is it's going to deploy the contract. Oh, you know what? I don't want to compile them. I'm not going to wait for that. No, compile. So it's going to deploy the contracts to that ether sim that you just spun up. It's going to run some post deployment scripts for the development environment.
00:06:38.410 - 00:07:02.660, Speaker A: It runs a script that adds in some demo data and that's going to finish up here in a second. Let's wait for that. If you notice, ethersem is processing all the calls and transactions. So great. Now we're going to serve that on localhost. Check it out over here. Perfect.
00:07:02.660 - 00:07:42.894, Speaker A: And then we have if it loads up our DAP store on Ether sim. So what I have is I have seven of the eight dapps that are live right now. I'm going to go ahead and add one for this demo. So go ahead. And this right here will soon be Persona integration. And right now, so right now it's just an anonymous user, but add a new DAP, you get information about the DAP. So the Dap I am going to add right now is called Dow wars.
00:07:42.894 - 00:08:18.694, Speaker A: It's a distributed. Peter, how do you say that? Distributed smart contract program game. So Dow wars. Right. We're going to give it a unique id which is not really used right now, but we hope for that to be used. I have the logo over here, which is a pretty sweet logo. We're just going to go ahead and put that in smart contract programming game and Dao wars currently lives at a GitHub repository.
00:08:18.694 - 00:08:51.026, Speaker A: Now it's not a DaP that you can use yet, but at least it could benefit from the publicity of the DAP store at least being in it. So I'm going to go ahead and take the description from the GitHub repository. Go ahead and hit next. Submitting a transaction now we got to add a version that people can start using. So this version is going to be 0.2.0 again, the place that you can find dowers right now is at this location. I'm not going to write anything new about this version.
00:08:51.026 - 00:09:15.840, Speaker A: That's optional. But I'm going to add a couple of screenshots, or actually one screenshot and I have it right here. So right now, as you'll see, screenshots are hosted elsewhere. Eventually we hope for them to be hosted on ipfs. Go ahead and finish up with that. And what you'll see is you have your page for the DAP store and you can begin perhaps selling your DAP. So one more thing.
00:09:15.840 - 00:09:49.240, Speaker A: This user is a developer, I suppose is registered as a developer in the system, but obviously this user could purchase Dapps. I'm going to go ahead and get it free, purchasing it for $0, of course. And you can open it up, it brings you to exactly where you want to go. If I wanted to go see which purchases I've made, I can go click over here and you'll notice that Dow war shows up. So that's where we're at now we have, oh, five minutes. Great. We have a lot of things we want to do, but I'm going to go ahead and use those five minutes for any questions.
00:09:49.240 - 00:09:55.720, Speaker A: Yeah, sorry, I guess I didn't alert you about that first question.
00:09:58.730 - 00:09:59.190, Speaker B: Questions.
00:09:59.260 - 00:10:00.120, Speaker A: Okay, cool.
00:10:11.730 - 00:10:21.278, Speaker C: When it's in another context, context of another domain, how you make sure that it's openable like you're running in the normal browser.
00:10:21.454 - 00:10:21.938, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:22.024 - 00:10:28.600, Speaker C: So the DAP itself has to check a specific contract to check if this current user is allowed to use it.
00:10:29.130 - 00:11:00.542, Speaker A: Yeah. So the way that it would work is your DAP would integrate or know where the license registry is and you would have your own key or address for your DAP. And then you'd go look at the registry and say, does this user, does this address have a license for my DAp? And if so, is the license valid? And then you would either restrict, if it is valid, you would let them use the DAP and if not, you would restrict them from access.
00:11:00.676 - 00:11:05.050, Speaker C: So you would use web three e accounts to check what identity the user has.
00:11:05.140 - 00:11:23.394, Speaker A: Yeah. Right now we're using addresses. Yeah. This is all web three. It should run and miss. Although I probably need to do one or two tweaks to the code, but that's the idea. Well, I guess I was going to say it should run missed.
00:11:23.394 - 00:11:24.040, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:24.490 - 00:11:25.240, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:11:26.010 - 00:12:01.938, Speaker B: Okay, we got time for one more question. So when you meant you're going to purchase the app. Yeah. Why is the purchase coming via your app and why won't the app simply use you as a catalog and then you are. Because what the depth gets from the depth store is just exposure. Because the whole micro payment and selling something to the user in the end can be perfectly done via Ethereum. Doesn't need to go through the depth store.
00:12:01.938 - 00:12:06.710, Speaker B: So what's the purpose of having the purchase concept?
00:12:09.290 - 00:12:17.800, Speaker A: Well, some of the features that might be interesting to provide is. Well, let me just make sure I understand your question.
00:12:20.110 - 00:12:23.434, Speaker B: Why am I purchasing the app via the depth store?
00:12:23.552 - 00:12:23.882, Speaker A: Why?
00:12:23.936 - 00:12:36.986, Speaker B: I'm not just using the depth store as a catalog to see something and then inside the app, completely separated from your depth store, the transaction of purchasing is just between the depth and the depth user.
00:12:37.098 - 00:13:24.560, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, let me put it this way. What if you wanted to make your DaP available to people who want to use different currencies, who don't want to use, say, ethereum or want to use your app, but don't know too much about Ethereum, but to be exposed to it. Like they don't want to run a node, or maybe they don't want to run a wallet, but you want to expose them via the browser. One thing that the Dapster could do is provide that conversion for you. Now, if you're just asking where this button should be, if you're just saying that maybe I can have a DAP store button says buy it on my own website, well, that's definitely a feature we can provide and that can integrate directly to the store.
00:13:29.570 - 00:14:08.294, Speaker D: Right, sorry. Yeah, so it was intended like mist, like the DAP store that we all have discussed in the past as a catalog first, where people can select bookmark decentralized apps that they're interested in and certainly not pay for those. But there may be some business models in which people would want to pay. Developers would want to be paid upfront or would want to lease their Dapps or something like that. So Tim made that a use case as well. It's a way to organize your Dapps as well.
00:14:08.492 - 00:14:22.860, Speaker A: That's a good point. If you, if you put an app in the or adapt in the DAP store today, you cannot sell it. It's released currently free, so those features will be added later. Looks like my time's up. Thank you.
