00:00:00.440 - 00:00:26.938, Speaker A: So I'll begin. We've shipped image that you've tested. We are doing the reviews. Reviews are in progress. One was done already and another one is ongoing by look. And we've got a few issues on Trello from Kilari and we are fixing them. And I think the updated image will land tomorrow.
00:00:26.938 - 00:00:48.374, Speaker A: So I think by tomorrow you'll get an updated document that will be where the Trello issues will be fixed and the results of the first review will be in. And also we'll update the the master branch contents. First off, that's it with us.
00:00:50.754 - 00:00:59.864, Speaker B: Hey, yeah, as for me, I implemented.
00:01:00.444 - 00:01:01.424, Speaker C: The new.
00:01:04.684 - 00:01:44.574, Speaker B: Strategy without phantom blocks. I was just working on publishing a new docker image that works for AMD 64. So I'm going to push one within the hour. But yeah, I haven't got around to checking the errors that Killari reported, but those were from before the Phantom block change. So I'm actually curious if like how things are going now that we have this update.
00:01:48.114 - 00:01:49.778, Speaker D: Yeah, I need to run the test.
00:01:49.826 - 00:02:17.793, Speaker C: Again when both are running non phantom blocks and then see how, how determined and get. Are they still agreeing on each other or not? Do we have anything else to discuss? I don't think there's anything new for a while.
00:02:25.133 - 00:02:30.073, Speaker D: Is Nethermind still planning on going into pushing it to master soon?
00:02:31.133 - 00:02:43.854, Speaker A: Yeah, basically we'll get the second review from Luke Ash. We'll do the fixes on top of that review, and after the fixes will land, we'll be able to push it to master. Yeah.
00:02:46.754 - 00:03:12.814, Speaker C: I was worrying about that because after that then I'm sure that there will be still some discrepancies if you get the Nethermine. But then I'm not sure how big deal that is, but if somebody start to use them, it seems like right away and then they might be. Things arise that it's different from get an ethermine. Like we haven't been able to test that hash differences, for example, because we have been keeping changing stuff.
00:03:15.074 - 00:03:25.094, Speaker E: I would say, don't worry, we won't announce it or even if we will, we'll say it's still in development, like in a better stage. So changes may come and that's it.
00:03:26.954 - 00:03:53.534, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm fine with its advertisement. It's still better and it sounds good, but yeah, then I find that in the main branch. But I hope people know that it's in the beta and don't expect it to work completely everywhere. I know what the status. Forget on that. If there's planning on pushing it to master at the same time or later.
00:03:54.874 - 00:04:14.854, Speaker B: I would like to basically make sure that spec is final and it's working before I ask for the others to merge it. So I would wait a bit more.
00:04:24.774 - 00:04:25.634, Speaker D: Okay.
00:04:26.254 - 00:04:27.514, Speaker C: Do we have anything else?
00:04:33.654 - 00:04:39.034, Speaker E: How is that thing going? What's the status? I was late a bit.
00:04:41.414 - 00:05:25.844, Speaker C: I added quite many tests that nethermines test a couple of cases for the cat that we need to be fixed and then quite many for netterminds. But then as the nettermind is progressing, then we sometimes find bugs in the get, because then there's discrepancies and then not all of those bugs are in nethermines. So that's why I've been hoping that the nethermine and get are getting closer and closer to each other. So it's easier to test them. Because I can easily see that the output are different. But I feel that there's still a lot of cases where the letter might is not that we know it's different results from the get. So I'm hoping that those will get fixed.
00:05:30.224 - 00:05:34.044, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll fix and update an image soon.
00:05:37.624 - 00:06:01.354, Speaker C: So after those are fixed and I write it again and then I can report new. Because there were quite many bugs. But I think some of them were caused by one of the same issue. So I'm hopefully that when that one is solved, then it all of tests will pass after that. But if you are running my test suit, then you should see right away which you're fixed, unfixed, which are not.
00:06:07.394 - 00:06:09.334, Speaker A: Yeah, it seemed also devon trail.
00:06:17.474 - 00:06:20.534, Speaker C: I guess we don't have anything else. Sina dropped off.
00:06:31.954 - 00:06:33.134, Speaker F: Nothing for me.
00:06:37.854 - 00:06:40.234, Speaker D: Okay. Talk to you next week then.
00:06:42.694 - 00:06:44.494, Speaker F: Yes. See you later.
00:06:44.574 - 00:06:46.034, Speaker G: See you. Bye.
