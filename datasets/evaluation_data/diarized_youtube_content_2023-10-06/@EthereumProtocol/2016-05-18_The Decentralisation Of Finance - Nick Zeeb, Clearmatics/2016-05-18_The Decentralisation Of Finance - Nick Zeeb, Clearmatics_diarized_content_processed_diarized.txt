00:00:07.560 - 00:00:08.110, Speaker A: You.
00:00:10.000 - 00:00:51.528, Speaker B: Thank you, everybody. Thanks for coming, everyone. Tonight on this may the fourth. Thanks for sharing it with us. I want to spend a little bit of time tonight to tell you about our sort of thoughts around how Ethereum can be used in finance. And actually, one sort of meta thought we have about that is that in order to make any meaningful change with a technology like Ethereum, is that you actually really need to understand what the current system is, how it works, and what the problems with it are. It's not really good enough just to know, oh, here's this wonderful thing called Ethereum that we can use magically to solve all these problems that we don't really understand.
00:00:51.528 - 00:01:15.036, Speaker B: It's actually quite important that you understand a domain in which you operate in order to have the maximum impact. So it's a bit like saying, I know solidity, therefore I can go and change anything I want. And that is true, but that's a bit a statement. That's a bit like saying, I know English, therefore I'm ready to write a medical textbook. Right. You need to understand not just the language, but also the domain.
00:01:15.148 - 00:01:15.970, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:01:16.740 - 00:01:44.024, Speaker B: Right, so tonight I want to start off with a bit of education about the domain of finance. And finance is interesting because it's one of the things that we interact with every single day. Right, of our lives. But there's many misconceptions around it. So I want to talk about a few of them and help sort of spread the idea of what's actually happening in finance. And then I want to talk a bit about what we're doing to try and make this situation better. So, yeah, I want to kind of red pill, blue pill you.
00:01:44.024 - 00:02:40.296, Speaker B: So if any of you are squeamish about what's actually happening behind the scenes with your real money, leave now, because there's a lot of misconceptions around it and I want to talk about a few of them. So slop echo here. Right, let's start with the first one, right? You've all seen one of these before, right? Like, it's a ten pound note. It's valuable, it's money, it's how you pay for things, it's how you get your lunch without having to kill each other. So my question to you is, as a starting question, is, why is this actually valuable? Right? Why do we all care about these ten pound notes as to who has them and who doesn't? Well, there's actually a clue on the british money that's right here. It says, this is valuable because anyone who owns this, who has this piece of paper, that's better. Has a promise from the bank of England that the bearer of this piece of paper can demand the sum of ten pounds at any time.
00:02:40.296 - 00:03:15.296, Speaker B: So obviously it's valuable because of that, right? Because you can just rock up to the bank of England, go downstairs the gold vault, and say, okay, I'd like my ten pounds worth of gold, please. Right? That's why it has value, right? Fail. No. Unfortunately, the first myth, and most people probably know this, is that since almost 100 years, in 1931, Britain came up the gold standard. So the only thing that actually gives this piece of paper money is that we all believe it has money, that we have faith in the bank of England that will defend the value of this thing. So modern money, fiat money, is really a collective delusion.
00:03:15.328 - 00:03:16.436, Speaker C: We all share that.
00:03:16.458 - 00:03:53.536, Speaker B: We have this thing that we all care about. And really, ultimately, in the electronic age, all it really is is a database entry. That's all money is right now, right? It's a number in a database somewhere. And when you go and check your ATM machine, hopefully it looks like that. So that's the first thing, right, let's talk about another one, right? So here is a picture of the typical London apartment, right? This one's actually quite cheap. You don't even need 63 million pounds to buy it, so it's a good deal. So my question to you guys is, when people take out these mortgages, right, to buy these kinds of houses, to.
00:03:53.558 - 00:03:54.576, Speaker C: Do this kind of thing, where does.
00:03:54.598 - 00:04:11.368, Speaker B: All this money come from? Like, who comes up with this money that you get in your mortgage, right? Yeah. Well, we all know the answer, right? It comes from little old ladies like this one, who are saving up for their pension, right? There's loads of them. They got all this money lying around, and when you need a mortgage, you just borrow some of theirs and the.
00:04:11.374 - 00:04:12.890, Speaker C: Bank makes sure it's all okay.
00:04:13.340 - 00:04:56.020, Speaker B: But actually, I think we all know that that's kind of not true, because there simply couldn't possibly be enough little old ladies to pay for these London mortgages that we're getting, right? Like, this just doesn't somehow fit right, what's actually happening underneath. And this is another really important thing to understand about modern finance. And the bank of England actually recently made a publication two years ago about what's actually happening. So most people probably don't know this, but when you actually take out a loan of any kind, the financial institution that's giving you that money is making up that money. That money is being a new entry in a database that did not exist before. It comes out of nowhere. When you borrow it, you lend it into existence.
00:04:56.020 - 00:05:00.168, Speaker B: And there are limits around how much money a bank can give out and.
00:05:00.174 - 00:05:01.560, Speaker C: How much collateral it has to have.
00:05:01.630 - 00:05:32.000, Speaker B: But essentially anyone who takes out a loan is increasing the money supply. So when you pay back your mortgage, conversely, the problem is you're actually shrinking the money supply. That money, when you pay back your mortgage or any other loan is actually destroyed and it goes away. So in fact, the vast majority of money that's flowing around today comes out of somebody having taken out a loan somewhere, and then that gets recycled through the economy and people take out more loans based on that money as collateral and more loans are based on that.
00:05:32.070 - 00:05:33.856, Speaker C: So it can happen several times in.
00:05:33.878 - 00:06:09.756, Speaker B: The cycle that more money is created by people taking out loans. The vast majority of money actually is created like this. So that gives us an interesting insight. That means that if we want to change how much money is flushing around the system at any one time, what we can do is we can make it more or less expensive for people to take out loans. And that's exactly what's called monetary policy and that's exactly what the governments do. Right? When there's a recession right around here, they go and drop the base rate as low as they can and say, hey guys, please, please take out some loans, spend some money.
00:06:09.858 - 00:06:11.468, Speaker C: Things aren't going so well.
00:06:11.634 - 00:06:52.908, Speaker B: Now, unfortunately, there's a bit of a problem, right? There's this like lower barrier. It's kind of hard to go much below zero, although it is being talked about. So when you hit this sort of cliff here and you can't go much lower, you've kind of flatlined here. Then what do you do? You still want to stimulate the economy. You still want people to take out more money and put more money in the system to make sure the economy recovers. So if people won't bother taking out more loans because you can't make it any cheaper, what you do is something called quantitative easing. So what you do is you actually, just as the central bank, you go and just print money, you just don't wait for anyone to borrow it, you just go and do it yourself.
00:06:52.908 - 00:07:46.392, Speaker B: So what the process is is that the central bank goes and says, right, what we need is more money in the system. We will just create it and we will use that money ourselves to buy stuff. Now the problem is, what do you buy or who do you give this money to? Basically is the question, right? Do you just give it to your friends? In some places that is what actually happens. So in a slightly more civilized society, what we do is we go and buy government bonds with it. We go and buy up the government debt on the free market that then gets held on the balance sheet of the central bank that is used against this money. The only real problem is, I guess, that what you're doing is you're making that government debt more expensive, which means that anyone who's holding that government debt has now made some money because you've just boosted the price of it. And let's face it, how many of us own government bonds? Right, probably a few in your pensions.
00:07:46.392 - 00:08:04.756, Speaker B: But mostly it's people who are quite wealthy, so those people tend to benefit more. Also, it helps the governments, right? Because if you're printing us money and you're buying up government bonds, you make it cheaper for governments to borrow because you're buying up their debt, you're raising the price for it. So the interest they have to pay.
00:08:04.778 - 00:08:05.910, Speaker C: On is much lower.
00:08:06.600 - 00:08:17.156, Speaker B: So that's where we are right now. That's what's happening right now around the world. Another issue that's interesting in finance is that this is probably what a modern.
00:08:17.348 - 00:08:19.130, Speaker C: Banking computer looks like.
00:08:19.580 - 00:08:42.316, Speaker B: The systems they use maybe aren't quite this ancient, but they are old, very old. Some of the payment technology problems we've seen, perhaps you guys remember this one? Yeah, it wasn't good. Basically. I'm not picking on RBS here by any chance. It's just a particular example. This is kind of typical. Many banks have problems like this.
00:08:42.316 - 00:09:17.708, Speaker B: And it's interesting as well, because if you look at some of the sort of consumer facing applications for money, you see it on your mobile phone app that does something, or you look online, on your banking app, on your banking website, if you go only a few layers, like below what you're looking at below the surface, you're jumping back decades, possibly generations in terms of technology, what's actually handling that money? Underneath, you're talking like mainframes, crazy old computer languages, all sorts of things that are problematic. And the industry knows this, right? So this was a response that the.
00:09:17.714 - 00:09:21.004, Speaker C: British Bankers association gave to what happened here.
00:09:21.122 - 00:09:59.464, Speaker B: So we know there's an issue that these systems are really old and need updating. Here's another interesting situation that most people don't know about. So there's this kind of hierarchy in terms of where money is deposited. So at the very top is usually your central bank, right? So it's the bank of England or the Federal Reserve in America. And you have this group of people who have access to the central bank and being able to deposit money into the central bank. So this gives them the ability to hold money somewhere in an institution that, by definition, can't default. They can't go bust, they're just not.
00:09:59.502 - 00:10:00.730, Speaker C: Allowed to by law.
00:10:01.180 - 00:10:31.772, Speaker B: Everyone else, including hedge funds, building societies, charities, or even the little old lady we saw before, have to deposit their money with some of the commercial banks. And that carries with it potential risk. Right, because these can fail over here. So I want to talk about the concept of knowing about where your money actually is. So my question to you is, how much is ten pounds worth if HSBC are holding it for you? I'm not picking HSBC. They happen to be my bank.
00:10:31.836 - 00:10:33.564, Speaker C: So they're quite a good bank.
00:10:33.692 - 00:11:14.812, Speaker B: That's probably worth around ten pounds. What about here? What if these guys hold your money, right? How much do you trust that? How much is that worth? Well, these people weren't so sure, so they thought they better go and check. This was the first bank run in the UK in about 150 years where people just lost faith in the system and took out all of their money because they were scared, right? Because they didn't know what was going to happen. Now, luckily, the government does protect accounts up to a certain amount of money. So currently the limit is 75,000 pounds. If you have that or less in your bank account and your bank defaults, you will be compensated within some sort of time game guarantee.
00:11:14.876 - 00:11:16.576, Speaker C: And this is how much they've paid out already.
00:11:16.678 - 00:12:13.452, Speaker B: So that is okay. But above that number, for a financial institution, that money could be gone if they default. In fact, when this does happen from time to time, that banks default. Another big problem we have in the system is that institutions can become too big to fail. And this is particularly problematic, because what that means is that if a bank knows, or an institution knows it is too big to fail, it kind of knows that the risks that are associated with it going wrong are borne by you guys, by the people, by the public. So they've socialized their losses, but if they do well and they make profits, those aren't coming to you guys, right? Those are being kept by the system. So this is a dangerous situation to be in, that if you allow institutions to become too big to fail, then we all have to basically bail them out when they go bust, because the implications of what happens when we don't bail them out are too bad in terms of what can happen to the outcome.
00:12:13.452 - 00:12:38.952, Speaker B: So it's kind of an important thing to make sure that these institutions don't become too big to fail. There's a lot of work happening around that that people are doing, like living wills or segregating banks between retail banks and commercial banks and investment banks and things like that. But it's a very serious problem that we need to fix, basically to make sure no institution, ideally, is too big to fail. So if people make bad choices, they suffer for it, the shareholders suffer for it. They were supposed to be in charge.
00:12:39.016 - 00:12:40.190, Speaker C: But not the people.
00:12:41.520 - 00:12:45.096, Speaker B: Lastly, here's a question, right? How much is ten pounds of BHS.
00:12:45.128 - 00:12:46.204, Speaker C: Vouchers worth right now?
00:12:46.242 - 00:13:38.764, Speaker B: Right? So this is another example where people are putting money in things and not realizing that there's actually risk in what you're holding, right? Like as the people who ordered the iPhone six off phones for you found out when the company went bust, right? If you give money to a company, they're not covered by any guarantee, like banks are, you are holding risk against that company. So that is probably worthless. Lastly, it doesn't just apply to fiat money, right? Like, how much is a bitcoin worth if it's at Montgox, right? Yeah, exactly. The point I'm trying to demonstrate here is the concept of counterparty risk. Like, know where your money is and who's holding onto it, because that matters as much as how much money you have. And that's an important concept with what we want to do. And what is our first foray into the use of Ethereum as a technology.
00:13:38.882 - 00:13:40.540, Speaker C: In the financial space?
00:13:40.690 - 00:14:15.464, Speaker B: So my point was earlier that really the only place that ten pounds is worth, always ten pounds by definition, is if these guys are holding it for you, the central bank. Right? Anyone else? There's counterparty risk. So here's how we want to use Ethereum. So at clearmatics, what we're building is a private consensus chain that we want to deploy in the financial space where financial institutions join as part of a consensus computer based on Ethereum. And the first step in what we're using this for is to create something.
00:14:15.502 - 00:14:16.852, Speaker C: We'Re calling settlement coin.
00:14:16.916 - 00:14:42.448, Speaker B: It's essentially a token for which we've created a system that ties the value of this to being essentially as if it was held at the central bank. So no matter who defaults or who's holding this in the system, if any of these nodes fail as financial institutions, the node that's holding this only has risk against the central bank. And that's actually a really important situation.
00:14:42.534 - 00:14:43.564, Speaker C: In the financial markets.
00:14:43.612 - 00:15:46.948, Speaker B: If you can eliminate this counterparty risk in the system, you've made the system safer, because if you're holding these all with, say, Lehman Brothers. If you go bust, you've got problems, right? Because you may never recover it because the money's gone. So in this situation, we can use the power of a blockchain to essentially transfer these around in legally binding ways using simple cryptography, which lowers the cost and increases the speed of being able to move around money risk free. Now, for us, this is really just the beginning, right? We think that we're quite early on in the space. We think that the creation of what we're calling a consensus computer and a consortium network based on Ethereum is essentially able to do a lot more things than just move counterparty free money around. Although that is a big first step. We believe that it's important to work with the existing financial players, educate them around what we can do, show them an example that is obvious to them that they want this because it's better than what they're doing now.
00:15:46.948 - 00:16:02.972, Speaker B: But once that's in place, we think there's a lot more we can do with a consensus computer, because really, for the first time in technology, in the history of technology, we can take processes that are shared between institutions, like clearing and settlement, and all other kinds of.
00:16:03.026 - 00:16:05.436, Speaker C: Calculations we do around financial institutions, like.
00:16:05.458 - 00:16:13.696, Speaker B: Agreeing as to how much money is owed by whom, to who can be done on a consensus computer, where it's computed in such a way that we.
00:16:13.718 - 00:16:14.892, Speaker C: Agree a financial contract.
00:16:14.956 - 00:16:28.196, Speaker B: We can see what that contract is, we can cryptographically sign it. And then once we have a way of representing real, as I said before, money in the system, these contracts can act just like their legal counterparts, which.
00:16:28.218 - 00:16:31.440, Speaker C: Are much slower and more inefficient and more expensive.
00:16:31.600 - 00:17:00.044, Speaker B: So we kind of see this as just a beginning of what can happen when you introduce this technology. But it's important to figure out a way to introduce it in a way that the existing institution can see. Yeah, this is useful for us. This is a good first step. Let's go from there and see what happens, and then we can build on it. So one last thing that I want to say is that I still think we're really quite early on in this space. I think we're kind of like the computer was in 1943, sort of thing.
00:17:00.044 - 00:17:23.744, Speaker B: It's like we can kind of see a vision of where this is going. But personally, I suspect that the vision we have right now of where it can go is probably much, much smaller than where it can really go, because we just haven't seen what's possible yet. And I think this is something that happens a lot in the history of technology. Like when we first invent a new technology, the very first thing we tend to do with it is we do exactly what we did before. We just do it faster or cheaper.
00:17:23.792 - 00:17:24.148, Speaker D: Right?
00:17:24.234 - 00:17:53.644, Speaker B: Like when we invented the printing press, the first thing we did with it was copy the Bible, because before we did it by hand and it was annoying and expensive. And only later did we realize, oh, wow, now we got this technology, we can do lots of other things with it, right? We can have novels, we can have textbooks, we can have pamphlets, all sorts of things. Even with the Internet, right? We had the Internet. The very first thing we did with it was we go, okay, great. We can send electronic letters to each other. Fantastic. Or we can build a giant yellow pages where every company tells us about their products and their prices or whatever else.
00:17:53.644 - 00:18:35.980, Speaker B: And only later do we realize, or once the obvious use cases are exhausted, do we realize there's things we can now do that weren't possible at all before. And things like cryptocurrency, blockchains, social networking things can exist that weren't possible or not even imaginable beforehand. So lastly, I want to say we're a company that's hiring, so if anyone's interested in what we do and our mission, this is the dream team with one of our advisors standing there in the middle. If you guys are interested in what we're doing, you have development experience or even business experience. Please come and speak to us afterwards and help us make finance great again in our mission. So thank you very much. Cheers.
00:18:35.980 - 00:18:43.070, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:18:44.580 - 00:18:56.532, Speaker D: Thanks, Nick. Very interesting. Thank you. Obviously, you've got private blockchain. This is not on the public Ethereum blockchain. You're using your own blockchain, correct?
00:18:56.586 - 00:18:57.044, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:18:57.162 - 00:19:00.260, Speaker D: So what made you choose to do that with Ethereum?
00:19:01.800 - 00:19:04.192, Speaker B: Why did we make it private? Or why did we choose Ethereum?
00:19:04.256 - 00:19:07.636, Speaker D: I can see why you made it private. Why did you choose Ethereum?
00:19:07.828 - 00:19:26.476, Speaker C: So we think that Ethereum is actually the most advanced and tested technology in this space. We think the model that it's using in terms of an account based system, in the sense that it has this abstract virtual machine where you can use a language like solidity and compile into.
00:19:26.498 - 00:19:28.140, Speaker B: Bytecode, is actually really useful.
00:19:28.880 - 00:19:47.312, Speaker C: So we think the whole Utxo model is kind of problematic for what we want to do. It's just needlessly complicated for our application. And we also think that the idea of a VM is kind of a great idea because it doesn'tie. Us to a specific language. Right. Because it's Turing complete in the bytecode it executes.
00:19:47.456 - 00:19:50.756, Speaker B: We can not only write conduct in solidity, but we can actually invent our.
00:19:50.778 - 00:20:07.656, Speaker C: Own languages and compilers that can help our customers better model the financial contract that they actually want to have on this system. It doesn't have to be written in what we recognize as solidity, but we could have a more functional based language, or languages that are more easily provable, maybe not even necessarily turn complete, to.
00:20:07.678 - 00:20:09.896, Speaker B: Make it even easier to prove certain statements about it.
00:20:09.918 - 00:20:15.676, Speaker C: Because once you agree with someone on the blockchain that you and I are going to swap $20 billion, we want.
00:20:15.698 - 00:20:17.368, Speaker B: To be pretty damn sure that it's.
00:20:17.384 - 00:20:22.848, Speaker C: Going to do what we think it does. So we think for all these reasons, Ethereum is a really good choice right now.
00:20:23.014 - 00:20:25.584, Speaker B: And for us, it's actually really important.
00:20:25.702 - 00:20:36.188, Speaker C: That the community, and we want to help the community do this, is to modularize the system as much as possible so we can do things like easily swap in and out different consensus algorithms.
00:20:36.284 - 00:20:38.324, Speaker B: In a private blockchain setting. It doesn't make a lot of sense.
00:20:38.362 - 00:20:59.864, Speaker C: To use proof of work, right? We don't want Goldman Sachs trying to buy more graphics card than Morgan so they can mine more blocks. That's just a bit crazy in our situation. So we want to be good citizens in this situation. We want to help the community make sure that the code is modular. Things can be replaced, there's other languages. And crucially, what we want to do as well is we want to open.
00:20:59.902 - 00:21:01.256, Speaker B: Source all the code that we write.
00:21:01.358 - 00:21:02.796, Speaker C: Because to us, not only do we.
00:21:02.818 - 00:21:06.396, Speaker B: Believe that's the right thing to do, but actually, luckily, in this day and.
00:21:06.418 - 00:21:36.096, Speaker C: Age, it's actually our customers, the financial institutions, who don't want to have us replace one centralized intermediary that they are currently having to interact with, with one that's distributed, but is beyond their control as well. So we want to not only give them open source code, but we want to give them code where we can make guarantees about what's actually running and they are also in control of. This brings along new challenges, of course, like how do you manage and deploy such a network? Because it's now running distributed against a bunch of institutions, and banks have strict.
00:21:36.128 - 00:21:37.636, Speaker B: Rules about firewalls and all this sort of stuff.
00:21:37.658 - 00:21:54.510, Speaker C: So some technical challenges to solve. But we think it's quite exciting, and I'm very happy personally, that we get to open source all this stuff and hopefully contribute back a lot to the actual community to make the public system more modular. And anything else we find any performance improvements, we will also want to share.
00:21:55.120 - 00:21:56.972, Speaker B: And privacy is the other big one for us.
00:21:57.026 - 00:22:19.380, Speaker C: So obviously, even in a private blockchain, you still don't want to have every bank see the trades every other bank is doing. So the work we want to do as well is to find solutions for keeping certain things private, whereas other things we want to be able to have transparent and ideally have give the regulator in the space a view of what's actually happening.
00:22:19.450 - 00:22:22.004, Speaker B: If they can in real time see what trades are being done, and only.
00:22:22.042 - 00:22:33.096, Speaker C: They can because they have the right decryption key that can also help make the system more safe so that trades aren't being hidden, they get a real time access to what the traders are actually doing.
00:22:33.198 - 00:22:34.936, Speaker B: So if some risk is building up.
00:22:34.958 - 00:22:37.352, Speaker C: Somewhere or people are doing dodgy stuff.
00:22:37.406 - 00:22:38.296, Speaker B: They can see that in real time.
00:22:38.318 - 00:22:55.890, Speaker C: And they have cryptographic proof of what's happening. So even the regulators are encouraging us in terms of what we're doing, which is a nice situation to be in. Usually as a technology startup, you're fighting regulation. Well, we actually have regulators who are interested in what we're doing, which is a great space to be in. So slightly long answer, but thanks for the question.
00:22:58.420 - 00:23:21.210, Speaker E: Who issues the settlement coin? Yeah, actually I've got a few questions. Let me ask them. Who issues the settlement coin? Who are the participants? You say it's private. Who are the participants? Are they banks, are they other organizations? What sort of technology are you planning to use for the privacy side of things? And that's it.
00:23:21.980 - 00:23:22.904, Speaker C: Okay, sure.
00:23:23.022 - 00:23:28.312, Speaker B: So we're not entirely public yet about.
00:23:28.366 - 00:23:38.616, Speaker C: Exactly how we're doing this, just because we're a startup and we're still slightly in stealth mode about the exact method that we're using to employ this situation of how we issue these settlement coins.
00:23:38.648 - 00:23:40.510, Speaker B: But we will come forward with that.
00:23:40.960 - 00:23:58.310, Speaker C: Soon enough where we'll share the exact details of how this is actually working. What was your second question? There was a privacy one. Who are the members? Also, it's something that's in discussion right now. We definitely have interest from the financial world. We aren't public yet about who's involved, but we will make an announcement on that.
00:24:03.640 - 00:24:07.888, Speaker B: No, well, okay, so the privacy thing.
00:24:07.914 - 00:24:10.184, Speaker C: Is something that we're actually still actively working on.
00:24:10.222 - 00:24:11.544, Speaker B: Like, we're looking at all the different.
00:24:11.582 - 00:24:29.630, Speaker C: Approaches, the same ones that Vitalik talks about, like homomorphic encryption, zero knowledge proofs, ring signatures. All of these things are things that we're currently researching in terms of what the solution can be to this and the research we do on this. We want to publish and share with the community when we find the right solution for what we're doing.
00:24:38.840 - 00:25:01.230, Speaker A: So one of the things that's happening in the. In the financial services market is there's these consortiums that have built up r three, which I'm sure you know, and others which are emerging all over the world. So there's some in the Middle east, there's some in the US. So my question to you is, how is what you're doing collaborating or competing with what they're doing?
00:25:03.280 - 00:25:06.732, Speaker B: Yeah, so you're right. We're not the only company in this space.
00:25:06.866 - 00:25:32.310, Speaker C: We take that to be a healthy sign that there's something happening here. And it's a huge space. Right. That's the first thing to say. I mean, this is amazing how much money gets sent around. And it's not just in sending settlements, like for settlement coin, but there's clearing, and there's all sorts of other processes that happen between banks that are currently happening and being duplicated in back office operations that can all be automated by this kind of technology. So we think it's a huge space.
00:25:33.560 - 00:25:35.376, Speaker B: In terms of who we will work.
00:25:35.418 - 00:25:51.964, Speaker C: With and who our friends or competitors or frenemies are. We're quite open. Like, we actually have a member of our board, sorry, an advisor to our company who's actually working for one of our frenemies, for lack of better word.
00:25:52.002 - 00:25:52.156, Speaker E: Right.
00:25:52.178 - 00:25:57.068, Speaker C: Tim Swanson is one of our advisors to our company. So we're quite close with r three.
00:25:57.234 - 00:25:58.348, Speaker B: Some of the other people in the.
00:25:58.354 - 00:26:15.750, Speaker C: Space are doing interesting things, like we're watching what's happening with hyperledger and things like that. We are more Ethereum based than they are. We think ethereum is the better way to go. We think the whole Utxo model is just not suitable. We think there's a good technology out there that works well. Ethereum. And we want to work with that.
00:26:17.160 - 00:26:17.572, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:26:17.626 - 00:26:20.310, Speaker C: And so it's a big market, and.
00:26:21.720 - 00:26:22.708, Speaker B: Some of the places we're going to.
00:26:22.714 - 00:26:42.104, Speaker C: Start in is like the OTC post trade space. So if you work in finance, the idea that we already have situations where banks are collaborating with each other, doing things like bilateral margining, all this kind of thing, we think is ideally suited for being computed on a consensus computer. Digital asset holdings.
00:26:42.152 - 00:26:42.316, Speaker B: Yes.
00:26:42.338 - 00:26:47.676, Speaker C: They're another good company. Again, we think Ethereum is the better choice for the technology for this.
00:26:47.698 - 00:26:48.332, Speaker B: But you're right.
00:26:48.386 - 00:26:59.852, Speaker C: I mean, yeah, there's a lot of people in the space, and it's a big space, and I can see why? Because there's a lot of interest from the financial world as well as the regulators and investors.
00:26:59.916 - 00:27:02.880, Speaker B: So, yeah, we wish them the best of luck.
00:27:06.180 - 00:27:24.488, Speaker F: I wasn't going to ask this, but you've said OTC so many times, I have to do it. So a few years ago, no one could have necessarily predicted the, well people were talking about where, say, bitcoin itself was going to head. And, of course. Are you familiar with BTCOTC community?
00:27:24.654 - 00:27:25.368, Speaker B: No.
00:27:25.534 - 00:27:26.312, Speaker C: Tell me about that.
00:27:26.366 - 00:27:59.476, Speaker F: The yeshiva. Anyways, they're part of the whole drama with the drama that's been going on for the past. Well, twelve months, really, and six months. Can you walk me through. I mean, obviously, it's a very different situation in that. In this situation, you have a community of potentially banks and other organizations. So we're not going to necessarily have, like, the major players in the fork we have right now, or have been having is kind of core BTC developer team and a foundation and then anonymous users around the world.
00:27:59.476 - 00:28:17.160, Speaker F: Right. So there's differences in contrast. But could you end up in a similar situation where the Singapore banks are like, nana, we're forking, and then north american banks are kind of. Do we not end up with kind of the same human element?
00:28:19.100 - 00:28:24.776, Speaker C: Sorry, I'm not quite sure I'm familiar with the background of this. Do you want to just come find me afterwards and then let's talk about it? It's probably easier.
00:28:24.808 - 00:28:26.700, Speaker F: I was referring to the bitcoin fork.
00:28:27.280 - 00:28:29.016, Speaker C: Sorry, which actual fork?
00:28:29.128 - 00:28:31.644, Speaker F: Well, the one that's been talking about.
00:28:31.682 - 00:28:33.124, Speaker C: The classic versus core.
00:28:33.192 - 00:28:33.808, Speaker F: Correct.
00:28:33.974 - 00:28:35.996, Speaker B: Okay. You're wondering what happens if somebody forks.
00:28:36.028 - 00:28:37.264, Speaker C: Our code and does their own thing.
00:28:37.302 - 00:28:37.552, Speaker F: Exactly.
00:28:37.606 - 00:28:38.604, Speaker C: Consortium is fighting.
00:28:38.652 - 00:28:39.216, Speaker B: Okay, sorry.
00:28:39.238 - 00:28:44.608, Speaker C: I understand the question now. Yeah, well, I mean, the source guy.
00:28:44.614 - 00:28:48.256, Speaker B: Is open in source. People can do what they want with it, but alongside this, in a private.
00:28:48.288 - 00:29:00.004, Speaker C: Chain context, there would be, like a governance model around this and agreements about what we're doing here. So having a bunch of individual banks in this network who go and fork off their own chain, we think, is unlikely.
00:29:00.132 - 00:29:02.504, Speaker B: But it's a consortium model.
00:29:02.542 - 00:29:02.696, Speaker E: Right.
00:29:02.718 - 00:29:30.688, Speaker C: So if some of the members of the consortium have a problem, there would be a governance process over which they can air it and we can figure out what the right solution is. It's not quite as public and problematic in the way that the bitcoin has very different ideologies about whether something should be just used for settlement or whether we want to have every coffee on the blockchain. But you're right. I mean, it's a blockchain. Right. It could have participants who have very different goals. But we think these people are much more aligned because they're much closer in their aims of what they want to do.
00:29:30.688 - 00:29:47.368, Speaker C: They're all financial institutions, they want to be able to interact with each other. The thought that they're going to split and have problems in accepting each other's transaction and blocks to them makes the whole system much less useful. So we think it'll be less problematic, but we've yet to build it and see what happens. So we'll find out.
00:29:47.534 - 00:29:49.370, Speaker B: Okay, two more questions.
00:29:55.700 - 00:30:21.848, Speaker G: So we just had a question around the OTC post trade space. So the image that you showed up before seemed to focus a lot on kind of bilateral agreements between banks, but obviously kind of the real world. The way that it seems to work in OTC there is that there's a lot of middlemen and third parties. So things like custodians, clearing houses, things like that. So I was just wondering, without asking you to give away any trade secrets or anything, how you guys are kind of planning to involve those entities as well?
00:30:21.934 - 00:31:32.092, Speaker C: Yeah, that's an excellent question. So one of the things we want to build is actually a decentralized clearing network, one where the clearing is done by consensus. So when you enter into a trade, you agree as to what the terms of that trade are in a smart contract, but you also agree as to what source of market data you will use and what valuation methodology you'll use, something like the SIM model or something. So recently we did a collaboration with Opengamma, an open source pricing library, and showed how we can integrate their technology into an ethereum based blockchain where smart contracts can make calls out to their code in Java, use their valuation methodology, and do a consensus computation around the idea of how much this is worth and therefore how much margining needs to be deposited with a contract. And in combination with something like settlement coin, we can not only consensus compute what the margining requirements are, how much something is worth, but we can actually do the actual financial cash flows, the settlements of the thing automatically as well. So yes, we want to move away from basically all financial intermediaries is our personal aim, and for that we want to build what we're calling a decentralized clearing network.
00:31:32.156 - 00:31:34.460, Speaker B: That would be the step two after settlement coin.
00:31:34.540 - 00:31:38.210, Speaker C: What I haven't talked about tonight, because I only had 25 minutes, but yeah, thanks.
00:31:38.660 - 00:31:40.390, Speaker B: And last question here.
00:31:40.840 - 00:32:00.490, Speaker H: Yeah, thank you. I just like to ask the question that why banks need such a thing, because in the blockchain probably the integration is going to be much tighter that we currently have in financial system. Probably banks will be able to develop all that technology by themselves.
00:32:02.380 - 00:32:04.344, Speaker B: I mean, banks have technology teams who.
00:32:04.382 - 00:32:21.628, Speaker C: Can work on things, but they have issues as well, because if, say, Morgan develops, not picking on Morgan, but if a particular bank develops this solution, the other banks won't trust it. They actually need someone like a startup who is neutral and independent, who builds.
00:32:21.644 - 00:32:23.490, Speaker B: A system that they can all trust.
00:32:24.500 - 00:32:58.436, Speaker C: So our plan is to work with them, with their innovation labs, to come up with the best ideas and be a company who can actually build a solution where people aren't thinking, oh, well, I can't join this because that's the Goldman Sachs chain. I'm JP Morgan. No, we're a neutral party to the system. That's, I think, our main focus. That and the fact that in practice, I think a startup company like ourselves has more flexibility in what we can develop and what processes we have in place to get this thing deployed, rather than those bureaucratic problems that happen in big banks.
00:32:58.468 - 00:32:58.616, Speaker E: Right?
00:32:58.638 - 00:33:13.616, Speaker C: Like they have these innovation labs and they're working on stuff, but maybe their boss doesn't even know what they're working on. They don't understand it. It tends to be more difficult in a big bureaucratic context to make this happen. And even then, their competitors don't trust it. So we want to work with these.
00:33:13.638 - 00:33:14.816, Speaker B: Guys, and there's some very smart people.
00:33:14.838 - 00:33:18.690, Speaker C: Who work at these innovation labs and we're working with some of them.
00:33:19.380 - 00:33:21.232, Speaker B: Okay, thank you. Okay, thank you.
00:33:21.286 - 00:33:21.504, Speaker D: Sorry.
00:33:21.542 - 00:33:22.720, Speaker B: Come find me afterwards.
00:33:27.380 - 00:33:27.870, Speaker D: Five minutes.
