00:00:15.130 - 00:00:15.390, Speaker A: Hello.
00:00:15.460 - 00:00:42.140, Speaker B: Today I'm in north London at the offices of Providence to speak to Jesse Baker and Yasa Steiner, who are the co founders of this exciting startup. Provenance is a platform to build transparent supply chains, and they're using Ethereum's technology to give suppliers and consumers information they can trust about the products. Thanks for having us. So, firstly, could you tell us a little bit about yourself, how you came to work together and how you came up with idea behind?
00:00:43.070 - 00:00:44.314, Speaker A: Sure, sure.
00:00:44.512 - 00:01:26.578, Speaker C: So I'm Jessie Baker. My background's in manufacturing engineering. So I've been looking at how we might create more transparent supply chains for almost a decade, I guess, and started Providence a few years ago to try and think of a grassroots approach to supply chain transparency. We started building a network and then I met kind of, we met in the queue at a small Internet of Things conference in Berlin and both were pretty keen on the blockchain.
00:01:26.674 - 00:01:29.000, Speaker A: Started talking about provenance on the.
00:01:33.450 - 00:01:39.420, Speaker B: And then how did you decide to create provenance on Ethereum? On Ethereum, yes.
00:01:40.610 - 00:02:29.434, Speaker C: Well, for me, it was like the lost key to fit the lock. Like a big challenge with supply chain transparency is it's very difficult to create end to end supply chain transparency without compromising, well, revealing the identity and perhaps compromising what happens within the supply chain itself. And the method I was using, and we still use it, providence around forming a network and using a more participatory social experience works if you want to be 100% transparent. But the blockchain allows us to kind of take that to a next level. Yeah.
00:02:29.472 - 00:02:50.018, Speaker A: So it was quite an exciting time when we both met last May. So I came across Ethereum and provenance basically at the same time where I was still working as a consultant. I worked on circular economy. So the way how to share and reuse products, components, materials. Can you tell us a little bit.
00:02:50.024 - 00:02:52.820, Speaker B: About circular economics where exactly?
00:02:53.350 - 00:03:34.946, Speaker A: Yeah, so the idea is basically, I mean, the way how we currently produce and manufacture is quite a linear way. So we extract materials, create products, use them and dispose of them while wasting enormous material value and effort that's been put into the products. So the idea is basically to close the loop and kind of reuse the materials, and it's really difficult to track products and feed them back into the loop. So that's one thing we would like to achieve using the blockchain. So securely tracing tracking materials and can.
00:03:34.968 - 00:03:39.060, Speaker B: You exactly explain what you aim to achieve with Providence? What's your.
00:03:42.630 - 00:03:42.946, Speaker A: Mean?
00:03:42.968 - 00:04:32.978, Speaker C: So there's a large social mission behind Providence. In fact, it's set up as a social enterprise. And really it's designed to empower all kinds of actors along product lifecycles to create a more transparent system for everybody. And really why we're aiming for transparency, there are lots of reasons, but the main one is around trying to reduce exploitation within supply chains of lots of types of exploitation, from social and societal impacts that supply chains have to environmental devastation, I guess. So really our kind of grand remit is around addressing that problem and kind.
00:04:32.984 - 00:04:39.858, Speaker A: Of in an interesting way. So in a positive way, by helping companies to shine that actually use good business practices.
00:04:39.954 - 00:04:51.370, Speaker C: Exactly, yeah, we're trying to build like cutting edge pioneering tools for the good guys. Yeah, the people that want to have a more transparent approach because they've got little to hide.
00:04:51.870 - 00:04:59.340, Speaker B: So what's the difference between your projects and other projects concerned with ethical sourced products? What's the main difference?
00:05:01.310 - 00:05:51.334, Speaker C: Well, there are quite a few projects in this area. Quite a lot of them are the brands themselves or they are retailers who are looking to be more transparent about the products they sell. In fact, just this year we've seen quite a few new initiatives. Even Amazon has got an initiative to help open up the supply chains on a couple of their product lines. So that was kind of interesting. But provenance doesn't sell any products and we don't intend to ever be a retailer of goods. So what's important to us is brokering the information and being a way that information can flow to consumers and through different stakeholders and supply chains.
00:05:51.334 - 00:05:52.720, Speaker C: So that's quite a big difference.
00:05:53.490 - 00:05:56.590, Speaker B: And how have you found building on Ethereum?
00:05:57.330 - 00:06:26.806, Speaker A: Yeah, that was basically, I mean, in some ways it was a lucky coincidence. So I came across the two projects basically at the same moment. So Jesse had already been thinking about using the blockchain, kind of the opportunity for tracking things immutably on the blockchain. Yeah. And then I heard about a talk in Berlin in May and so, yeah, that luckily happened at the same time.
00:06:26.988 - 00:06:30.460, Speaker B: And can people contribute to the project in any way?
00:06:31.390 - 00:07:08.338, Speaker C: There are so many ways. So although provenance as a company has been around for a little while, I mean, more than a year, the work we're doing with Ethereum and the DAP is kind of still pretty early days. So we're really interested to find partners that might be keen to pilot this, particularly companies that are independent and have a supply chain that perhaps is a bit more complex. But then, yeah, we're looking for all kinds of people to get involved.
00:07:08.434 - 00:07:24.106, Speaker A: Developers, developers who are interested in designing smart contracts, how to make this work in the legal system when it comes down to transactions and things should be accepted as an actual transaction that has taken place. Definitely.
00:07:24.208 - 00:07:52.670, Speaker C: There's a lot of work we're doing around physical tagging as well of goods because it's all very well having digital incidences of products existing and being linked to the blockchain, but we're talking about real physical material things. So a lot of the kind of experiments and design work we're doing is looking at RFID and NFC and lots of ways that we can link physical things to providence so directly.
00:07:52.750 - 00:08:04.342, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. And I understand you have received funding from the EU and UK government. Was this helpful? What happened was like a big change for your company.
00:08:04.476 - 00:08:22.282, Speaker A: Yeah, that was actually pretty exciting. I mean, it was really exciting. The starting point for our work. So we had been working on an article and then started working on these proposals. We get money granted both by the European Union and the UK government, which will basically enable us to build what we are aiming for.
00:08:22.416 - 00:08:25.520, Speaker C: It's nice to know that other people think it's a good idea.
00:08:26.210 - 00:08:32.158, Speaker B: Can you give us an example how you can use a blockchain in a company in the supply chain? Exactly.
00:08:32.324 - 00:09:17.198, Speaker A: Yeah, of course. So one thing that we've been talking about, and it's probably a really tangible example, is bicycles, like where people would be interested in what exactly is the grade of the steel that's been used, what's the kind of paint, what's the impact of the paint on the environment. That could be data metadata that people would like to additionally commit to the blockchain or any type of services that then are done during the lifecycle of the bike. So if you brought that bike back to the manufacturer for getting a wheel exchange or things like that, and then you want to sell further onwards that bicycle, that's kind of important information to have and would increase and show the true value of the product.
00:09:17.364 - 00:09:20.720, Speaker B: So these are kind of data you would like to track. Right.
00:09:21.090 - 00:09:55.382, Speaker C: So the exciting thing about this is before the invention of Ethereum and the blockchain, if you wanted to make that supply chain transparent, you would have to reveal the identity of every single person along a supply chain along with the accompanying data that could support what grade the steel was, where the paint had come from, the environmental impact. But now we can allow for some pseudo anonymous information. So perhaps you can see the grade of the steel without having to reveal the mine or the steel works necessarily.
00:09:55.526 - 00:10:00.326, Speaker A: Still maintaining the whole continuity, the whole chain throughout the lifecycle.
00:10:00.438 - 00:10:07.230, Speaker B: And the company are still competitive because they don't have to reveal everything exactly about how they produce stuff.
00:10:07.380 - 00:10:16.338, Speaker C: Yeah, it makes a lot of sense for all the actors in the supply chain. Yeah. You aren't reducing people's competitive advantage at any step.
00:10:16.504 - 00:10:23.246, Speaker B: Are you building any physical technologies around provenance? Something like Nadware?
00:10:23.438 - 00:11:03.758, Speaker C: Yeah, we are. So an important part of this is connecting physical things and materials to the blockchain. So we've been investigating lots of different tagging methods from some quite lo fi tagging methods like chemical tagging and even just etching and engraving so that we can give things unique identities. But then also we've been looking at digital tags, so chips and also RFID and NFC, which is radio frequency identification and it allows you to, quite a few phones have got NFC capability now. So you can just touch your phone on the tag and find out. Exactly.
00:11:03.924 - 00:11:06.618, Speaker B: So thanks for being with us, Jesse and Yata.
00:11:06.714 - 00:11:07.502, Speaker C: Thank you.
