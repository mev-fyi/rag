00:00:12.570 - 00:00:25.026, Speaker A: There was one slide that caught my eye about the cavalry being the government. What about the cavalry being a reputation system? Sean, maybe you have a comment. Reputation systems are a good self regulation mechanism.
00:00:25.098 - 00:01:23.206, Speaker B: Oh, self regulation I quite like, but it doesn't solve all the problems, of course, because self regulation also means that you have to accept the terms of it, which are fine if you bought into it and you've signed off on it by your participation. But not everybody who's involved may be a direct participant. They might be impacted on the outside. Take, for example, driving your car down the road and someone else bumps you. It's some external factor. And of course, there are going to be people who are within the virtual world that we all are working on, but there are also a lot of people who are outside that world, and sometimes we'll bump into them. So in those cases, self regulation, of course, won't work.
00:01:23.206 - 00:01:42.720, Speaker B: It'll work within the community, within the participants of a particular contract, because that's what they've bought into. Will it apply to other people who are impacted? Definitely not. And where will they go running? They'll go running to the other thing, the law. And they'll expect people who have.
00:01:44.530 - 00:01:45.194, Speaker C: Rules.
00:01:45.242 - 00:02:07.974, Speaker B: To go by and principles to uphold, principles that ultimately we all rely on in a civilized world. And they'll go and want those external arbitrators to do something about it. Yes, self regulation, but it won't solve everything. Right.
00:02:08.012 - 00:02:32.734, Speaker A: So it sounds like there's this chasm to cross into the real world where the problems that you describe become apparent. So, for example, the self driving car running ethereum ends up in an accident, not because of its fault, but because there was a drunk driver at that intersection who's liable. And the fact that the person sitting in that self driving car would then rely on the existing legal system in order to defend their interest.
00:02:32.852 - 00:03:24.094, Speaker B: Absolutely. I mean, there's the wonderful example, isn't there, with self driving cars, of coming up with the ethics of deciding whether in order to avoid running over a dog, you drive into a concrete wall at 70 miles an hour and kill your occupants. But then that can be programmed. But the owner of the wall might have something to say about it and will want recompensing by the self driving car. Or who owns the self driving car? Who does it belong to? It's always someone I want to hold accountable, really, but I want to hold someone accountable. My wall needs to be rebuilt, and.
00:03:24.132 - 00:04:23.374, Speaker C: That'S what the purpose of the law is. As I was saying, the lens that you look at the problem through. And whether it's a macro lens, whether it's a micro lens, will affect the way you perceive the answer if you look at it as a micro lens. Specifically, can we build a self regulating system on the blockchain? The answer is yes, of course we can, as long as we're only self regulating other people who have opted in to that regulation, that ecosphere. Now, if you then, as Sharon was saying, take that, you look at it in a macro lens and say, well, actually, this operates in the real world, and if it wants to interact with the real world, then you need to make it accountable to the real world rules and the real world laws. Now, it's quite feasible to build a blockchain based technology that never interacts with the real world. And as long as we're all comfortable with that, and it's a purely private sphere, then that's fine.
00:04:23.374 - 00:04:46.040, Speaker C: But that's not what most people want to do. They want to be able to get their money in and out of this. It's not fantasy football. And that's the challenge that we have, and that's where the politics comes into play. Whether you're going for a libertarian, highly deregulated space, butting up against this very regulated world that we live in.
00:04:47.130 - 00:05:20.690, Speaker B: The other problem is that things change over time. We haven't really thought about how, when we code a smart contract where it's simplified, but it's easy, it's simplified, and it'll do just what it's coded to do. And that's. That's great, because we all then understand it. It's the best kind of contract we can have. No vagueness, no english language to interpret. It's very clear what it will do.
00:05:20.690 - 00:06:04.954, Speaker B: But sometimes the outside world changes, and we often go to the law to help us through, help us deal with changes. So the obvious contract that comes to mind is a marriage contract, an arrangement between two people. And we all know that in the ideal world, that's forever. And that's the whole point of it. The commitment is forever. But in the real world, people snore or they don't put the top back on the toothpaste tube, and it becomes incredibly irritating. And eventually toothpaste tubes become broken relationships.
00:06:04.954 - 00:06:35.354, Speaker B: And then we have to say, well, this set of rules that we wrote at the beginning, very simple set of rules about living together, some vows that were made, so on and so forth, that we got to undo those, but there is no provision for doing that within the rule. So we got to go outside and get someone to help us with that similar, you need a divorce contract. That's what you're after. Absolutely, yes. A marriage contract on the blockchain with.
00:06:35.392 - 00:06:38.860, Speaker A: A killer called I want half. That's how they called it.
00:06:39.310 - 00:06:43.040, Speaker B: Brilliant. What about when you've only got one child?
00:06:43.570 - 00:07:26.380, Speaker A: Well, I mean, that's the thing, what you're describing. It's interesting because first of all, the contracts are immutable, that's true. But they can be proxied through gateways which redirects it to another contract. And you can imagine a system where the people who run the contract say it's not autonomous and actually is run by a cooperative of like minded people who opted in, are able to then change the rule. And you can even imagine a system like futurki where people could vote on the rules and you end up with those self organizing societies, if you will, which as long as they don't interact with what you describe as the real world, as in the mid space. And again here I would argue actually calling this the real world. For many, calling myself the virtual world is the real world.
00:07:27.870 - 00:07:58.210, Speaker B: I do a lot of work in the Isle of Man, and the first time I went, I made the mistake of calling the UK the mainland, and I learned never to do that again. It's the adjacent isle, so we have the adjacent universe that we live in. There's this stuff and there's the other stuff. They operate in parallel.
00:07:58.710 - 00:08:25.854, Speaker A: Isn't there an arc? Somebody raised the point that there were losses, for example, Parker in the bitcoin world, and pump and dump was raised. But isn't that an issue with any low liquidity system and completely unrelated to the properties of bitcoin, and the fact that this decentralized Dito for Mount Gox, you can't blame bitcoin technology for Mount Gox, which is a centralized PHP based server, as far as I understand, where people simply centralized it and run away with the money.
00:08:25.892 - 00:08:28.990, Speaker D: As far as I know, someone has to be accountable.
00:08:29.570 - 00:08:35.060, Speaker A: Well, in this case, it was pretty clear that the entity Mount Gox and its leader Mark Copoulos were.
00:08:36.790 - 00:08:38.174, Speaker D: Responsible and they were accountable.
00:08:38.222 - 00:08:40.706, Speaker A: I mean, the fact that they're in Japan has nothing to do with the.
00:08:40.808 - 00:09:10.910, Speaker D: Well, actually, Sean raised a nice point before she said, well, next week we'll have the advocate general who will be expressing their opinion on what this crypto stuff is. If, for example, the advocate general decides that it is to be treated as money, then all the regulations applicable to money will come into force, which means that pump and dumps will become legal.
00:09:12.050 - 00:09:20.622, Speaker B: Which is they already are even in a common law system, you still have.
00:09:20.676 - 00:09:46.230, Speaker D: Several people in the crypto world still organizing these quite cyclically on a regular basis. Now, to be honest, I don't know how often that happens in the sort of traditional currency forex market, for example. But the way that I've experienced it is that this is done quite blatantly in broad daylight.
00:09:47.210 - 00:10:18.274, Speaker B: Those cdos that you were talking about before, the cause of the current financial, the 2008 one, the most significant potentially, that was a pump and dump scheme, because you pump up all these worthless mortgages, and so long as people think there's value in them and more people keep coming into them, it's fine. But eventually someone's hell holding the baby and the worthless land.
00:10:18.472 - 00:10:59.002, Speaker C: But the pump and dumps are illegal in the sense that there's laws against them. And those laws can be translated to bitcoin. And if bitcoin is regulated, then that can become illegal. If bitcoin isn't regulated in that way, and that the regulations don't say bitcoin is illegal, pumping and dumping in that marketplace is illegal, then it's free to do. And it's a risk people take by doing it. The reason regulation exists is to protect people against risks that they perhaps don't know they're taking or haven't thought through. And that's the same with Mount Gox.
00:10:59.002 - 00:11:40.394, Speaker C: Mount Gox failed because of the technology failure. Now, banks are regulated to build their technology in a way that it shouldn't fail, like Mount Gox failed. And if Mount Gotts was built to banking regulatory standards, it wouldn't have failed like it did. So again, it's one of the challenges of working with a technology like this and being in at the outset, is that we're there before the regulation is, and that's the risk we take. But you can't expect your nontechnical friends to be interested in this marketplace and then understand the vagaries of THP exploits and the risks that they're taking. And that's what regulation is designed to try and do.
00:11:40.432 - 00:12:07.990, Speaker A: But do you see the irony of the Mount Gox issue, where you have this eminently decentralized currency, which you hold, and you are ultimately, as a bitcoin holder, responsible for its own safety, by, I don't know, using cold storage, or printing out keys on a piece of paper, putting in a bank vault, ironically enough, and the fact that actually a lot of people were storing their bitcoin and putting in the care of a third party, which bitcoin was designed to eliminate.
00:12:08.410 - 00:12:57.014, Speaker C: Completely ironic but also a response to the fact that perhaps people don't fully understand the technologies that they're dealing with. And that's not a problem that is going to go away. And so the option is only treat people as sophisticated investors or the equivalent, and that's what banks do with certain classes of securities that are high risk. They will only allow people who meet certain criteria to invest and trade in them, or to say, well, look, it isn't that kind of technology. Anyone can do it and it's at their own risk. Now, if you're a government, you don't have a political view on this matter. You want to treat it in the way that you believe your dmos would want you to do it as a whole.
00:12:57.014 - 00:13:11.654, Speaker C: You would probably take the view that what you need to do is regulate it because it's not fair to treat it as unregulated, because some people are going to lose that for that reason, because they don't understand what are they going to regulate.
00:13:11.702 - 00:13:18.902, Speaker A: Because you mentioned the idea of taking, for example, say, cryptocurrencies are money. So that's a form of regulation.
00:13:18.966 - 00:13:19.338, Speaker B: Correct.
00:13:19.424 - 00:13:50.920, Speaker A: That would be executed by a government or the eurozone or something of that nature. But then I suppose what will happen is some people will argue, well, my emoney is not a cryptocurrency, it's a metacoin. And we're going to end up in this debate around semantics. So then the next best thing would be to ban anything that's, or regulate anything that's blockchain based. And if you were to abstract it even further, you'd say, well, let's forbid encryption, for example. Because, I mean, there are rumors that the UK government is looking to.
00:13:51.930 - 00:14:02.140, Speaker B: It's not a rumor, I mean, it's a specific proposal and being worked on. And it's of course not going to work because it shoots the other.
00:14:02.510 - 00:14:03.546, Speaker A: Why is it not going to work?
00:14:03.568 - 00:15:17.294, Speaker B: Why is it not going to work? Because any backdoor in encryption is going to weaken the encryption and render it effectively useless. The only kind of encryption that might work is the encryption which has no backdoor and which can resist for long enough in time. Attempts to crack it so purposefully, putting in a backdoor, renders it useless. Now, why does that matter? Why won't it work? It won't work because all the other stuff that the government want to do to prevent financial crime through, for example, identity theft, as just one example, relies on, guess what? Encryption. And so weakening it is impractical. It was a stupid thing to come up with. And the government is now stuck with having said that it will do it because it's worth a few votes, it's purely political.
00:15:17.294 - 00:15:24.900, Speaker B: And now it's got to find a fudge and weaken their position on it because otherwise they'll weaken all the bank security.
00:15:25.270 - 00:15:40.674, Speaker A: And that's exactly, I would argue that actually it wouldn't work because the terrorists, because this is what we're talking about, preventing terrorists from exchanging information with each other. That's how it's packaged as, isn't it? The terrorists will simply say, okay, you've banned encryption.
00:15:40.722 - 00:15:41.074, Speaker B: Wonderful.
00:15:41.122 - 00:15:59.594, Speaker A: Well, I'll just continue using it. It's open source, I'll donate it from GitHub. That's why it doesn't work. So this concept of we're going to try to protect you by imposing regulations that ultimately are going to be forming a bit of a business prevention unit for many are simply ineffective.
00:15:59.642 - 00:16:34.442, Speaker B: At the very least it won't meet in any significant way. It won't meet the stated objectives. That's absolutely right, because the clever terrorist is the one who has no phone line in his. Remember bin Laden never had a single telephone line coming into his compound. He never used technology at all. So he was totally off the grid and he relied on human messengers. Ultimately that turned out to be the weak link.
00:16:34.442 - 00:16:58.658, Speaker B: But nevertheless, you're absolutely right, it won't work in terms of what it's supposed, what its stated purpose is any more, I argue, than say, current antimoney laundering framework really works in any significantly effective way. It doesn't. It catches zero point something percent of what supposed to.
00:16:58.744 - 00:17:07.318, Speaker D: Well, yes, that's an institutional failure there rather than sort of in abstract terms, whether or not regulation is good or.
00:17:07.324 - 00:17:21.610, Speaker B: Bad, well, it's not fit for purpose. I mean, the framework doesn't work. What it's designed to do does not achieve the end result, but it does it at incredible cost and inconvenience to society.
00:17:23.070 - 00:18:11.882, Speaker C: This is where I see the risk in the libertarian agenda and pursuing it. I'm very sympathetic towards it. But equally, the encryption and the law enforcement angle is a very interesting one because let's take Tor, the encrypted network. Now the idea of that is that nobody can say what you're actually doing on that network and whether you're using it and how you're using it. Now the NSA, I think, were able to watch by pattern analysis. They couldn't tell what you were doing, but they could tell by pattern analysis. They run, obviously, nodes and they are seeing what's going through their node and they could look at your traffic and see whether through pattern analysis, they could pin that on you.
00:18:11.882 - 00:18:50.918, Speaker C: Now, while it's not illegal, all that they know is that I'm running Tor. When it becomes illegal, they know that I'm committing a crime. So even if I'm doing nothing illegal over the network, it's worth their time to pursue it. They can shut it down. And eventually you get a network where the only people running it are people who are trying to commit crime. So their argument at least is they draw an assumption between the use of encryption technologies and the committing of a crime, and therefore they can focus their intelligence gathering on that assumption. Now, I don't particularly agree with that, but if you're David Cameron, for example, that might be an attractive idea.
00:18:50.918 - 00:19:37.806, Speaker C: That might be something that appeals. And that's why I say, I think that pursuing the libertarian angle is divisive. It creates this idea that it's us against them. It's the kind of technologists against everybody else. Actually, what this technology has the power to do is be very helpful to the real world if deployed in the right way. And by doing that, just as the Internet has opened up communication to the world, yes, it's regulated, yes, there are elements that are watched, and yes, it has facilitated even terrorism in some cases. But on the other hand, it's allowed people to communicate on a global scale.
00:19:37.806 - 00:20:08.750, Speaker C: It's allowed cultures to interact that were never able to interact before. And even when there is terrorism, it allows the easier investigation and tracking of it, and allows for as many terrorist acts that it's facilitated. Others have probably been stopped. We'll never have those stopped. So if we can move the debate in that area, I think it helps. Now an example, let's take your driverless car example at the beginning. Let's imagine that that car is heading towards a crash of, I think you said a dock, and it has the choice of going into a brick wall instead.
00:20:08.750 - 00:20:34.402, Speaker C: And it chooses the brick wall. The very act of going into the brick wall could trigger an insurance payment from the car to a central fund so that the owner of the brick wall has someone to claim against to recover the value of rebuilding the wall. And he knows that he doesn't have to go through, firstly, find out who crashed. Secondly, track him down. Bring a legal claim based on paper. Go through a small claims process. It's just automatic, it's very efficient.
00:20:34.402 - 00:20:36.406, Speaker C: And so those are the applications that.
00:20:36.428 - 00:21:15.410, Speaker D: Will, that's where regulations and the blockchain can interact very collectively. And as we were mentioning before, it seems that there is an institutional failure, institutional weakness. Now, the good thing about the blockchain, for example, is that it's completely transparent and it's a recorded ledger of all past actions taken on there. So that could be a tool to be used. And I think that they might be even be contemplating it. I hope so for their sake, because otherwise we'll have other more banks dealing in mexican cartel money, so on and so forth.
00:21:15.850 - 00:21:28.666, Speaker B: The report came out this week. Guess which place in the world is the money laundering capital of the world? That's it. Absolutely.
00:21:28.768 - 00:21:30.730, Speaker A: Give this man an orange jumpsuit.
00:21:35.070 - 00:21:37.194, Speaker C: Does anybody have any questions for us?
00:21:37.312 - 00:21:48.320, Speaker A: Yeah, we can open up for questions, I think. Sorry, do we want to pass the mic around in order to record the Q A, George? Also, it'll be easier for some people to hear at the back.
00:21:50.370 - 00:22:31.020, Speaker B: Whilst the mic's being set up and someone's about to fill in a claim form for tripping up over a Barclays accelerator chair. The interesting thing about the driverless car accident is that the question now is that the driverless car has logic that says, actually, I took this action because of the dog. I think that the dog is to blame. And since you can't get the dog, well, the dog's run off anyway. But no, we got the dog and it's the owner of the dog and his insurance company that should pay.
00:22:32.270 - 00:22:42.858, Speaker C: That's why dog owners often have pet insurance. And unlike a cat, which is a free spirit, a dog is your responsibility. And if the dog insurance says no.
00:22:43.044 - 00:22:45.458, Speaker B: It was your choice to go into the wall.
00:22:45.624 - 00:23:26.062, Speaker C: Well, and that will depend on the normal legal system that we have, which is around. Exactly. We can't avoid standards, tortious claim for liability. And that's why we need. Those are the areas where the blockchain is going to interact with the real world, and that's what's going to keep us lawyers and compliance professionals busy, rather than the big questions about politics and jurisprudence. And that will be the bit that I'm more interested in focusing on, because I think that's the bit that for you guys that are building technology, we'll be able to help you with.
00:23:26.196 - 00:23:32.350, Speaker B: I was looking forward in retirement to becoming a mature student and learning about jurisprudence.
00:23:34.310 - 00:23:43.518, Speaker C: Like everything, you can scale it up to politics and philosophy and back to the Greeks and the Romans.
00:23:43.694 - 00:23:45.570, Speaker B: Don't mention the Greeks.
00:23:46.470 - 00:23:54.694, Speaker C: And the challenge of that is it distracts you from the day to day of, actually, how do we take this innovation and make something really good and really powerful with it?
00:23:54.732 - 00:24:17.006, Speaker E: So we have a question, Sean, just to raise a point. Cods are abs. You said they were worth fact. They're not. Not one has actually ever defaulted. The credit crunch was because the credit agencies overvalued them. So to say they were worthless is not correct.
00:24:17.006 - 00:25:10.906, Speaker E: Secondly, with regard to self regulation now I've been following bitcoin and that for about a few years now, and all this thing about self regulation, self regulation. And after Mount Cox collapsed, everyone went, well, we knew about it. Well, why didn't you tell anyone? So even in our bitcoin community, there are a few people out there who know what's going on and still didn't give the transparency that we're supposed to be proud of. So I think thing about regulation is why we need it. And the third point is I'm into the Internet of things and that's where we're going. And that's where the blockchain is going to sit on side by side. And when we get into the Internet of me, that's when the blockchain and everything else will become even more stronger.
00:25:10.906 - 00:25:32.054, Speaker E: And I don't think there's been an accident. I think Google done over a million miles on their car and had one accident. And if you're in the risk world, you're supposed everyone's now rethinking how they value risk. That's just a couple of points I just want to make, that's all.
00:25:32.252 - 00:26:11.570, Speaker B: I think they're excellent points. And yes, I think I may have exaggerated to make a point earlier on about pump and dump, and maybe the example wasn't perfect, but I think we get the gist. I think one of the points I'd like to pick up on what you were saying about self regulation is it means different things to different people. In the ethereum world, self regulation means the contract regulates itself. Everything is in the code.
00:26:11.640 - 00:26:15.170, Speaker A: That customer protection could be baked in the arc.
00:26:15.930 - 00:26:52.000, Speaker B: And in the virtual currency world, self regulation might mean something different. So we can all be proud of living in a country where there's an holistic government policy on virtual currencies and holistic in as much as it takes into account not the narrow lens of a particular regulator, but rather a government perspective, taking into account all government departments, those that are the Hangham and Floggham home Office, through to the let's get.
00:26:54.550 - 00:27:21.626, Speaker E: I don't think our government's that bad. I think they know they run cross party committees, they understand where the cryptocurrency is going, they understand where the digital guard digital world is going. They need help. They're asking people to help. And I don't think it helps for people to sit and go, we live in this world and the rest of the world don't want to know us. I don't think that's right. I think they do.
00:27:21.626 - 00:27:43.070, Speaker E: And there's more and more people coming. Speaking from experience, a year ago, there only been a handful here. Now, in the last six months, for every meeting I've turned up, the numbers have doubled. And I hope this is the way forward, that even in next year, the double pandemic will continue doubling.
00:27:47.410 - 00:28:27.040, Speaker B: With the governments. Sure, like some of them, are very much looking to look into cryptography and to cryptocurrencies and all that kind of stuff. It's a problem of silos in that you have certain elements in certain groups, like, obviously, sharm. The UK DCA has done incredible work talking to some of those groups. However, there's others who just have no clue and there's no communication between those groups. And that's why we have ridiculous things like the idea of trying to ban cryptography coming out, because it's just misunderstanding and lack of communication in general. Any more questions? Woody? I'd like to wait another question on the question.
00:28:27.040 - 00:29:11.360, Speaker B: This government in this country, necessarily, as it happens, in relation to the digital currency space, in widest sense, I think it is enlightened. I think it's actually approached it in the right way. The people who are running the team, politics team, are absolutely on the ball, fighting for crypto in the european arena, very actively doing so on this point. I agree with you. They're just messed up. Cryptography was just a headline that seemed very good on the day.
00:29:14.770 - 00:29:18.526, Speaker D: You mentioned the UK government, if I'm correct, in.
00:29:18.548 - 00:29:19.120, Speaker C: The.
00:29:21.250 - 00:29:28.820, Speaker D: Sweden case, the UK submitted, made a written submission in favour of this case.
00:29:29.190 - 00:30:45.210, Speaker B: Unfortunately, we couldn't persuade the treasury to persuade HMRC to put in with these kinds of cases. There's a process where obviously the parties involved make their case, but because it's about european law, the member states can also put in an intervention so they can state their position, their view and put it before the court. And it's a voluntary thing. Also, some european institutions can do that as well. And unfortunately, the only two countries that did were Germany and Estonia. Estonia wants to tax every aspect, basically wants to treat virtual currencies as a vatable commodity, and Germany, who want exchange type commissions to be vatable, and Britain, which had come up with the most wonderfully pragmatic approach. March last year, was this.
00:30:45.210 - 00:31:30.860, Speaker B: Yes, last year, on the taxation of virtual currencies. Incredibly pragmatic. Said it isn't money, but it works like money, so we'll treat it like money for VAT purposes. A very pragmatic position, and then wasn't prepared to push that before the court. However, the European Commission did as an institution, and the commission agrees with the UK position. So the UK position did actually get put before the court, but unfortunately we didn't have the money to pay a lawyer to go to Luxembourg that week.
00:31:32.670 - 00:31:45.200, Speaker E: I'll just make one point. The UK DCA is a marvelous organization, and those people here who aren't members for a sake of 20 pounds should join because they do an awful, awful lot of work.
00:31:47.810 - 00:32:15.160, Speaker B: It's always nice that my colleagues and I on the UK DCA are recognized and we all volunteer and we try and promote the cause of all this crypto stuff. So thank you for that. Yes, 20 quid, if you haven't already, in bitcoin, of course. Ukdca.org. There's a question that was your free advertisement. Come over. There's a question over there.
00:32:15.160 - 00:32:17.720, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:32:20.270 - 00:34:16.670, Speaker F: I had a question about codification of law kind of came up a few times this evening already, and some of you were kind of more for, and some of you were kind of against a little bit. I saw a really interesting talk a few years ago from a very interesting academic based at goldsmiths. I think he started off as an architect, but slowly got into architectural forensics as his field of research. And his best known work is that he was looking into the way in which Israel, in certain incursions in Gaza, being aware of the definitions of international law that describe war versus skirmishes or incursions. Israel had been very careful to not damage architecture in Gaza when killing people, so that when investigators would come to see the area, they would not judge their actions as war, but would instead classify them legally as being skirmishes or something smaller than war. And they succeeded effectively in doing that and getting away with that with no problem, just by leaving enough architecture intact for it to not look like large, heavy artillery had been used. In that case, the codification of law would have clearly favoured Israel were it not for the, let's say, humanist interest of this particular academic, who incidentally was Israeli.
00:34:16.670 - 00:34:41.270, Speaker F: The matter wouldn't have gone any further, but he managed to actually open up a discussion about it and further investigation. My question then is, for those of you who are pro the codification of law, or the potential codification of law, how would you see that humanist aspect still sitting alongside that, or where would that play a role?
00:34:43.770 - 00:35:19.710, Speaker D: I don't think it's about being pro or anti. It's about not using the law as a weapon, but rather as a shield. That's a solid principle in english law. So if in the case that you quoted, Israel deliberately used the codified laws to its advantage in order as a weapon in that case, then that goes against, I think, it's the principles of equity in english law. Yes. So it depends how you use it. You must use it as a shield, not as a weapon.
00:35:19.870 - 00:35:25.880, Speaker F: But where would that judgment be made? In an artificial intelligence system.
00:35:31.210 - 00:35:32.726, Speaker A: You need to pass the mic.
00:35:32.908 - 00:35:33.906, Speaker G: Litigation lawyer.
00:35:33.938 - 00:35:34.726, Speaker B: So I deal with a lot of.
00:35:34.748 - 00:36:30.250, Speaker G: Disputes, and it's a really interesting area how dispute resolution, the right to a trial, right to justice, the right to put your point across, feeds into a whole automated system around how a contract plays out, how a specific decision like that plays out. And automating it runs into all sorts of problems, because, as we all know, the real world is awkward, difficult, intangible, open to interpretation. And when you enter the world of disputes, everyone puts across their disputes in entirely different ways, can argue things from different points, can analyze things from different perspectives, and you run into an awful lot of trouble very quickly, which is why you have the smart barristers looking at the points. The judges very experienced, drawing on vast principles of common law in the UK, of course, qualified systems in Europe, and, yeah, it's a very messy area to run into. More an observation, really, than a comment.
00:36:33.230 - 00:37:21.638, Speaker C: That's a very pertinent comment. I think that's absolutely right. I work as a non contentious lawyer mainly, and 99 point something, percent of what I do probably never sees a court, because people are largely happy to follow the rules that they've agreed in the contract and they'll follow them. And when they do see, when something does go wrong, it will come down to exactly, I think, as the gentleman at the back said, a disagreement on definition or meaning, or potentially fact. Actually, usually not fact. Usually the facts are clear. The dispute is around what was meant or how something should be interpreted.
00:37:21.638 - 00:37:41.834, Speaker C: And that needs a legal system that is flexible enough, as the gentleman was just describing, to be able to respond to that. And that's why it's very difficult to codify the law to a point that a programmer might recognize as absolute or verified.
00:37:41.962 - 00:37:52.606, Speaker G: Yeah, everything has to be codified in a binary fashion, essentially, doesn't it? But if you're arguing over a point, you've got to open out that binary coding, be able to understand it and analyze it from a legal perspective.
00:37:52.718 - 00:38:20.886, Speaker C: But that's not to say that you can't codify for the x percent of cases that work, as long as people are happy with what's been codified and the process has run. Occasionally contracts create the wrong result. Doesn't mean that things get litigated. Sometimes people are prepared to live with that cost as a negative externality of an overall other more efficient system than litigating every contract.
00:38:20.998 - 00:38:41.026, Speaker G: And interestingly, institutions are more likely to want to do that than individuals because they're more pragmatic about it. And cost in litigation as a cost of business, essentially. So if they can save overall on litigation costs by netting off against the savings they'd achieve by having pre automated contracts, they go for it. Individuals differ. Very personal.
00:38:41.128 - 00:38:41.940, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely.
00:38:42.870 - 00:38:52.786, Speaker G: People will litigate as an attack method, use it as a method of attack rather than a shield.
00:38:52.898 - 00:39:23.086, Speaker C: But if you take a relatively closed loop ecosystem like trading, you could theoretically work out within this class of securities, how many historically have ended up in disputes, and what's the average quantum of that dispute been, and put a number on that, and then you could honor, if that trading was taken into the bitcoin world, then take some of the metacoin or the value fragments of it, and send that off to an insurance fund which is there to pay out when something goes wrong.
00:39:23.188 - 00:39:23.598, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:39:23.684 - 00:39:42.722, Speaker G: What you could do around that is, instead of rely on the actual core based system, you could set up an arbitrary system and build that into the contract. So there is any argument that needs to be played out within a discretionary based forum, you dictate the remit of that forum and subscribe via the contract to an arbitrary forum instead of the courts.
00:39:42.866 - 00:40:46.170, Speaker C: Absolutely. And one of the things that we looked at when we had the UBS session was how you would do that and use the New York Convention on Arbitration, which is, I'm sure you're very familiar with as a way of avoiding the need to look at what lots of different countries'regulatory systems are, because as long as this is a private exchange, a private contract in the private sphere, and it's not doing anything which is against public policy in any other countries in which you're working on, then largely the court systems are agnostic to what you're doing now. The only legal interaction comes then is enforcing something when it goes wrong. And that goes into a very archaic system of international treaties between countries about who will recognize each other's judgments. And that's where using something arbitration is a more modern way of doing it. There's no reason why you can't have eight if we all subscribe to. I think, as a gentleman, you're absolutely right describing a computer based, blockchain based arbitration system.
00:40:46.170 - 00:41:01.950, Speaker C: If we all agree that that is the ultimate arbiter of this private economic agreement that we have, then that works very well. And that, along with insurance and fund, for example, creates a really nice closed loop ecosystem that can really drive efficiencies in some of these markets.
00:41:03.190 - 00:42:00.660, Speaker D: I just wanted to mention, actually, that the UK is currently exploring online dispute resolution systems as an extra layer to put on top of the existing court system in order to save costs. I don't know, many of you have heard maybe that the Ministry of Justice has cut a lot of costs in terms of legal aid, so on and so forth. And as Chris mentioned, the system is quite archaic. So what they're trying to implement, or they're considering implementing, is an eBay style online dispute resolution system so that the court system can be streamlined. Now, that's very unfortunate for a person like me, who's a wannabe barrister, because I would be thriving on those litigations. But it does make the entire system more efficient and hopefully serving the interests of justice a little bit more.
00:42:03.270 - 00:43:16.490, Speaker C: It's a fantastic development and it's actually something that I'm trustee of the society for Computers and Law, and our president, Richard Susskind, is very much involved and has been advising on that initiative. And it's something that I'm very strongly for. It doesn't deal with the ultimate issue of what happens if a judgment goes against you and the other person doesn't pay up. And that's in the small claims court in the UK, then it's reasonably simple. But in an international trading environment, on the blockchain, where you might be transacting with people that you don't know what country they're based in, it becomes a lot more difficult. Let's say if there is somebody forges or hacks or splits the blockchain, and there's competing versions of the truth, then somebody might have to arbitrate that. And that's where having the fact that blockchain contains a value, as well as a codification of the law, allows you to be creative and create alternative to insurance, and largely create a buyer protection style mechanism.
00:43:16.490 - 00:43:36.130, Speaker C: That means, look, it might not be right, you might have been the bad actor, but for the overall efficiency of the market, there's a fund here that we've all paid into a tiny percentage of each transaction, and that fund will pay out to make you good. We don't know we're not determining right or wrong. We're just keeping the market efficient.
00:43:37.110 - 00:44:25.106, Speaker B: And the idea of a fund is particularly attractive in a world where you can't necessarily even identify the other parties over whom you might otherwise want to enforce an outcome. So in the crypto world, the real world identity of parties is not a given. I mean, it's voluntary. So who are you going to enforce it over? Well, you are. It's not even a question of jurisdictions, of going across jurisdictions. It's a question of even identifying who the other person is.
00:44:25.208 - 00:45:13.358, Speaker D: Yeah. The aspect of the digital identity is probably one of the most complex, not only legal, but also, I think, technological, technical issues in the blockchain sphere. And in fact, on 24 July, we're doing a hackathon with the theme on digital identity and the blockchain, because a lot of companies out there are trying to understand how to verify and how to make sure that the person you're transacting with is indeed who they are. Until you don't do that, you will not be able to transact higher value items, such as a car, house, so on and so forth. You will only continue to be able to transact, for example, for bitcoin, for your coffee.
00:45:13.454 - 00:45:14.274, Speaker C: That's about it.
00:45:14.312 - 00:45:19.330, Speaker D: Because that's how much money or monetary value you're willing to lose.
00:45:23.590 - 00:45:40.380, Speaker C: I have some thoughts on that. I think that is true to an extent. That problem exists in any exchange of value. In a private contracting. When you're writing a contract with somebody, what you often want to do is check that the person that you're contracting is who they say they are.
00:45:40.750 - 00:45:43.050, Speaker D: High value trades with someone you don't know.
00:45:43.120 - 00:45:43.498, Speaker C: Correct.
00:45:43.584 - 00:45:50.438, Speaker D: Some people might do it with their passport or as a minimum proof of address, so on and so forth.
00:45:50.534 - 00:46:36.666, Speaker A: Are you sure about this? Because if you think about the smart contract holding value, like Chris was saying earlier, as well as the escrow agreement, and you were already intending to say, sell your cars in exchange of, I don't know, let's call it metacoins. And they're there. You know for sure that the person who holds the public key has the private key to actually sign these transactions, because that's how they entered the contract in the first place. So you're assured that you don't know their physical identity, as in the mid space identity, if you will. But you do know that they hold that amount of money, or at the very least, the money is in the escrow contract, and that the money will be returned to you should the car not be transferred further and not use a car, let's say, well, let's stay.
00:46:36.688 - 00:47:03.762, Speaker C: With the car because I think the car is really interesting because, and this comes back to the interaction again with the real world. It's fine to say, look, I no longer have the car, it's gone, and instead I've got the money, fine. But then when the car runs over the dog and somebody comes after the driver of the car and the DVLA come knocking on your give the police your address and the police come knocking on you, you say, well, I sold the car.
00:47:03.896 - 00:47:12.786, Speaker A: You transfer the car, public and private, key to the other owner, and it acts as an immobilization system and so on. And it sounds far fetched.
00:47:12.818 - 00:47:24.330, Speaker C: No, I completely agree with you, Tesla, but you've got to then link that to a central registry or database of car ownership. Precisely.
00:47:27.230 - 00:47:59.890, Speaker A: One aspect that I found quite interesting, and we'll take another question after that, is that we're actually already thinking about those futuristic sort of, hey, you got your self driving car and it's running over this dog. But should I hit the wall? Here I am with my frontier release, and we're thinking about basic stuff like supply chain management and prediction market. Well, they're not exactly basic, but they're digital and they're self contained. So they would work quite well. But I think when you start hearing people talking about apache gunships, avoiding archaeological artifacts.
00:48:00.050 - 00:48:00.374, Speaker B: Why?
00:48:00.412 - 00:48:06.920, Speaker A: Because there's an IoT system that reads on the block, we're not there yet. Guys, we don't have to panic about this just yet.
00:48:07.770 - 00:48:36.418, Speaker D: But no, going back to the car example that you mentioned, the fundamental question is how do I know that you are actually the owner of that car? As you said, we know that the funds are there, we know the car is there. But the problem is that I don't have proof and you have not provided me proof that you did not steal that car. So you might forge the documents. How can I know? These are the questions.
00:48:36.504 - 00:49:31.220, Speaker B: Of course there are no documents because the documents don't exist in this world that Stefan's talking about. And given his track record of having to wear orange jumpsuits, I would really think twice about buying a car from him. But I don't know it's him who's selling it to me, so it doesn't really matter. But this is the friction between those kind of real world questions. Because we ask those questions about the reputation of the seller or his ability to prove good title or because what you don't want is to spend the money on the car. That transaction goes very cleanly. But the real owner of the car then says, I found my car and is entitled to get it back.
00:49:31.670 - 00:50:07.982, Speaker A: I think the problem here is, and it's something I've seen a lot in crypto, and particularly in the Ethereum world, is you've given this tool, and ethereum is ultimately a very flexible tool because everything can be written in code. So anything you can think of, and people tend to then obsess about fully decentralizing absolutely everything. So in this case, so you get stopped on the road, you sold your car on the blockchain, hey, tough luck. The registry document is not in your name. You're going to jail for sure. But that's not how it's going to happen. I think you could still sell your car and you would still transfer the registration to the owner and other owner as part of a hybrid model, so to speak.
00:50:07.982 - 00:50:29.654, Speaker A: Same thing for the insurance. It's not going to be fully decentralized. AXA is not going anywhere. But they could say, actually prove that they hold some type of fund on the blockchain, or at least leverage the immutability of the system to show that they've taken the necessary steps to cover certain claims. So it's not an all or nothing, I think this all or nothing approach, of course, every time you end up with the dog argument, the all or.
00:50:29.692 - 00:51:37.846, Speaker C: Nothing is an interesting academic exercise to talk through, because what the blockchain represents, to me at least, is, whereas the Internet is fundamentally untrustworthy by its very nature and was built like that, the point of the blockchain is it's solving the trust problem. It's a distributed network of trust and value. And those are two things that while the network of information has been solved, those value and trust points haven't. You can imagine artificial intelligence machines, for example, wanting to trust each other. And how do they trust each other? They're not going to be looking up each other's eBay ratings, they're going to want a more sophisticated way of doing that, and that's something that the blockchain can solve. So how it interacts with the real world is where we lawyers have to figure out how the existing regulation applies, just as we did when the Internet became mainstream. And we had to look at, well, how does copyright apply to the Internet?
00:51:37.958 - 00:52:02.100, Speaker A: Another interesting, I think, friction point. The gentleman actually left the room, but the gentleman that was sitting there was making the point of, well, I'm Kigox. Nobody knew yet. Everybody sort of knew, right? And it's true, we all knew. Everybody in the field knew, hey, don't put your money in there, you're going to get ripped off. Similar thing here with what we described. There seems to be all those things that we are aware of as part of this, people ready into the field, but not everyone is.
00:52:02.100 - 00:52:10.920, Speaker A: Don't we have a responsibility to maybe advertise it more? And how can we do this? Or is this going to be forever a niche system?
00:52:12.330 - 00:53:03.846, Speaker C: Well, the car, as ever, car analogies are brilliant because the used car sale on the blockchain here, you can imagine, can you imagine a mashup between used car dealers and Reddit, which is what online secondhand car sales would become if transacted in that way? Now, the challenge with that is you're going to have people there who are selling things that perhaps something, as gentleman said, faulty or unload worthy. And then the real world consumer protection legislation is going to have to figure out how to deal with that. Now, there's two arguments. One, this is very complicated, or two, it's very simple. It will deal with it in the way that it's always dealt with. It just the exchange of value will take place over this shared value system that we have. I completely agree with you.
00:53:03.846 - 00:53:18.006, Speaker C: We don't have to reinvent everything. What we need to do is look at the intersects and then we have to work out how existing law needs to be adapted to meet that. We've almost started with the most complicated bit of this technology, which is currency.
00:53:18.118 - 00:53:18.394, Speaker B: Right.
00:53:18.432 - 00:53:46.574, Speaker C: And we're trying to solve that first because trying to solve the intersect between technology and currency and banking and finance is much more difficult than trying to solve the intersect between technology and consumer affairs or technology and distributed the Internet, for example, copyright. Now that was a difficult issue to solve, but not half as difficult as it's going to be to solve securities trading.
00:53:46.622 - 00:54:09.434, Speaker A: And identity is going to be key to all this, because, as you said, we need reputation systems. Without identity, we can't have them. And I've heard of this project where they're issuing id cards on some Blockchain, like, say, the bitcoin one. Here's the thing. They're showing me this thing on their blockchain and I go like, I don't recognize this blockchain. I recognize only this other blockchain. Here you have your initial problem.
00:54:09.434 - 00:54:20.080, Speaker A: Is it only if we both agreed to a jurisdiction? In this case, the jurisdiction would be which blockchains? We both agreed on that these trades actually become possible.
00:54:21.010 - 00:54:24.290, Speaker D: It all seems the idea of who watches the watchers.
00:54:27.270 - 00:54:28.420, Speaker B: One more question.
00:54:33.170 - 00:54:34.874, Speaker A: There's a question over there, George.
00:54:35.002 - 00:55:12.140, Speaker B: Two. Okay, we did two. Can you talk a little bit more about smart contracts and what's the current state in terms of. I think, Chris, you had mentioned that there was some discussion on smart contracts at UBS for using it in trade, finance, et cetera. What's the current status? Is it something that's available to be deployed out there in the markets, or. There's a lot of flux, especially around the legal issues, which kind of render it more in the realm of let's discuss and will act at some point in future.
00:55:12.750 - 00:55:41.030, Speaker C: It's a good question. I think the answer will depend on who you ask. If you ask somebody who is at the forefront of Ethereum, they will probably give you ten different contracts that you could trade tomorrow. If you ask somebody in an institutional bank, they will say they haven't got there yet. The difference is, if you're trading on an ethereum, you're on your own. You're buying into that ecosphere. If you're trading through your bank, you have the protection of those banks.
00:55:41.030 - 00:56:24.958, Speaker C: And this was public, it was made available as a meetup, and we all went along and the people involved in it have been blogging about it. You can go and read about it. They're interested in looking at this technology and seeing how it might impact what they're doing twelve months, two years, five years from now. And I think that people like that we're in a Barclays space, assume that's no coincidence. The institutions are interested in this, and that's a good sign. And they're spending money on fantastic rooms like this. And that's a good sign that in five years time, this will be very mainstream activity.
00:56:25.134 - 00:56:30.454, Speaker A: Yeah, I think from a technical perspective, we're still crawling and we have yet.
00:56:30.492 - 00:56:31.800, Speaker B: To learn to walk.
00:56:32.490 - 00:57:09.994, Speaker A: We're not there yet. Clearly, there's still plenty of things to solve. Scalability is one. How do we implement IDT and reputation as well in a decentralized way? That's a huge challenge in itself. And also a point I'd like to make is I've seen a lot of people referring to articles in the press where they hear big names like Ubs and so on, and they think, oh, that's know it's accepted. Or, you know, we had this bitcoin conference in Brussels where we were both there, me and, you know, a lot of people looked at that and I saw some people know. European Commission now recognizes bitcoin as a currency.
00:57:09.994 - 00:57:32.360, Speaker A: And it's like, no, they're just exploring this stuff. It's not because you have a big name out there looking at it, that they're going to necessarily implement it, they're just looking at it. That's what all large companies do. You probably have similar research group at Google, IBM and so on. Looking at our stuff, that doesn't mean they're going to adopt it tomorrow. So yeah, it's very early day. I'd limit the hype a bit here.
00:57:33.370 - 00:58:44.010, Speaker C: I once made the vow never to use the word paradigm shift in any context, so I'm not going to. But what I would say is that just as the Internet created an environment in which information became much freer, so has this technology got the potential to create an environment in which value exchange becomes much freer and the institutions are just as interested in that as the individuals. And I think there is a good chance that what we're thinking about and talking about now, just as when the Internet first came up, people were talking about how do you put the whole world on the Internet? And what happens if there's no borders anymore? And that hasn't come to fruition. Nor will some of the more left field things that we're talking about tonight. But some of them will, yes, and we don't know which yet. And it's going to be interesting to help guide those conversations and input on them and you guys in the room, and we'll be developing them. Very exciting.
00:58:44.170 - 00:59:06.766, Speaker B: Andreas Antonopoulos makes a very good point. He said it's taken 25 years for the Internet to get to where it is today. The Internet of value is faster, but it's going to be 15 years. And I think that's.
00:59:06.798 - 00:59:07.378, Speaker C: Good point.
00:59:07.464 - 00:59:14.620, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe one of the last questions and then we can head up to the pub.
00:59:15.150 - 00:59:15.850, Speaker B: Hello.
00:59:16.000 - 00:59:42.510, Speaker H: Good presentation as always. Just a quick question then. So we could kind of apply blockchain to everything, but what path do you see to actually get people to opt in and use it? In a recurrent use case in a real world application, because you talk about the real world, but banks are kind of the real world, but just more in terms of general consumers and people have money to spend on stuff. So where does the blockchain start in real life? Using ethereum, which is obviously better than bitcoin.
00:59:42.590 - 00:59:43.460, Speaker B: That's all.
00:59:47.430 - 01:00:28.654, Speaker C: I'm happy to take a shot at that. Who knows? And to be fair, that's up to you guys. The people who are interested in developing this, you have to invent the use cases and the startups using this will create the things that people want to use. Something I would like to see I'd like to see somebody finally crack micro payments. That opens up a whole world of ecommerce, yet that doesn't exist at the moment. And why hasn't micro payments been cracked? Because the individual transaction cost of each exchange is expensive and will outvalues the actual value wanting to take place. Now with something like cryptocurrency, that isn't the case potentially.
01:00:28.654 - 01:00:35.860, Speaker C: And so this opens up opportunities in the micro payments, but very exciting. If somebody could do that.
01:00:37.990 - 01:00:55.606, Speaker B: I think the only thing I can add to that, and I think really good point made. But the only thing I can add to it is that because you're really asking the mass adoption question, it could.
01:00:55.628 - 01:01:06.830, Speaker H: Be in a business environment or anywhere. It doesn't have to be everybody in the world, but just one specific use case, either B two c or b two b, where you see this happening the most likely in the short term.
01:01:08.210 - 01:01:45.690, Speaker B: Not happening in the short term. I think that the time horizons are driven by desire rather than by practical application. This is an evolution, my own perspective, and I'm an old person. There's only two really old people here. There's Michael in the front row there, and me. Well, I'm not far behind. I came here on my senior rail path.
01:01:45.690 - 01:02:23.800, Speaker B: These things never happen that fast. And when I hear short term, it worries me because there's an expectation that this stuff will suddenly sort of click and one of these things will be a big hit. And I just don't see it. I think this is incremental and it's in development. And when we look back in 15 years, we'll say this bit and this bit and this bit. Now we're where we are today and we can't reverse that, and we won't want to. Who knows who's going to run with it first?
01:02:24.490 - 01:03:21.558, Speaker D: Well, for me, apart from the b to b. So business to business or business to consumer, sort of part of the market, I'm more interested in seeing the application of blockchain technologies in the way that your government or your state relates to you as a citizen. So how more transparent that relationship can be. Because one of the trends at the moment, globally, my opinion at least, is that there's a sort of a distrust. So one of the ways that blockchain technology can be sort of used as a use case might not be business. It might be something just as a mechanism or as a tool in the relationship that you have with your government. GTC, government to citizen, yes.
01:03:21.644 - 01:03:22.006, Speaker C: But no.
01:03:22.028 - 01:03:38.990, Speaker D: The good thing about the blockchain is that everyone can put the participate as well. And so it can make the process of democracy more transparent. And we all know what happens when people collaborate with each other. I mean, or cooperate with each other. Better things happen, in my opinion.
01:03:41.570 - 01:04:10.440, Speaker B: I've died, which I take to be a serious message to me. We all understand democracy, don't we? Greek people were given the opportunity to democratically choose whether or not to take it or leave it. And their government have just gone back yesterday to Brussels with a proposal that was actually the one they rejected on.
01:04:14.490 - 01:04:15.240, Speaker E: More.
01:04:16.670 - 01:04:37.194, Speaker B: Sorry, Mike, we couldn't hear you. It was an even worse proposal, in fact. If you want to hear how we can use ethereum to solve the greek problem, tune into Sky News tomorrow morning at 1030, when I'll be there with Ismail army of world Bermit telling the world how to do it with the help of Ethereum.
01:04:37.242 - 01:04:39.274, Speaker A: Mike, on Sky News tomorrow. What time is it, Mike?
01:04:39.322 - 01:04:40.926, Speaker B: 1030 on digital view.
01:04:40.948 - 01:04:41.326, Speaker C: Yes.
01:04:41.428 - 01:04:45.186, Speaker B: At Sky News. Yeah, I was trying to resist that plug, but there we go.
01:04:45.288 - 01:04:46.706, Speaker A: You couldn't resist it.
01:04:46.808 - 01:04:49.780, Speaker B: What time? Sorry, which 1030.
01:04:52.150 - 01:05:02.200, Speaker A: On Sky News, you say? Right. Well, thank you very much, guys. That was a really good evening. Thank you to our panelists. I think they've been excellent. And thank you.
