00:00:24.730 - 00:00:35.830, Speaker A: We we spoke very impromptu at a previous Ethereum meetup, and it's nice to be invited back to the slightly longer presentation about our project, which is called prominence.
00:00:36.250 - 00:00:37.606, Speaker B: You can find us on Twitter at.
00:00:37.628 - 00:01:16.550, Speaker A: Prominence hq and we really appreciate your thoughts and comments as we go. So every single product has a story, from the shirt you're wearing to the house you live in. Each of them have been on a journey, people of places and of raw materials. And some of those product stories are pretty tragic. We saw garment factory collapsed in Bangladesh, the effects of climate change some might attribute to our behaviour as consumers the horsemeat scandal. The list goes on and on. Yet rarely do we know much about the story behind the products we look at when we go shopping.
00:01:16.550 - 00:02:16.932, Speaker A: We find it quite difficult to make a positive choice. Yet some companies are taking steps to make more socially and environmentally positive products, and every day, things exchange hands. Priceless objects that feature in museums and in art galleries sometimes change hands with little more than a paper certificate. And the materials in our physical world are increasingly getting more precious as we rip the earth's crust through all the raw ones. And we start to look around the world to see if there are any others that we might be able to turn into new products. Increasingly, it becomes more and more useful to be able to track our materials as they come into no longer being needed due to things such as plan obsolescence. So at prominence, we're building a platform to look at this, to look at how we might make our product supply chains more transparent.
00:02:16.932 - 00:03:35.670, Speaker A: The project was hugely motivated by looking at how we make decisions as consumers. We often buy things based on price and aesthetics and perhaps functionality, but rarely do we buy things based on whether the company pays tax or the wages that people got in the creation of the product. So initially we find it prominent to build digital tools for the good guys, the pioneering businesses that do have a story to tell that's a little bit more positive, or that are taking steps to make their story more positive and therefore want to talk about it. So tools to help the pioneering businesses, the ones that want to show their supply chain is good. But there was a bit of an issue in that having, sorry if I can say, okay, yeah, it works for small companies. And we've already been working with several thousand small, independent creators of products who all have relatively simple supply chains in the grand scheme of things, and therefore weren't really squirming too much about making their supply chain more transparent in order to convey the value of their products to consumers like you and me. However, when you look at large companies and we start to think about mass large scale transparency of products, there becomes to be a bit of a problem.
00:03:35.670 - 00:04:57.580, Speaker A: Larger companies don't really see the competitive advantage of revealing their full supply chain. In fact, some might say the asymmetry of knowledge of companies like Unilever and like DP, humongous companies is what keeps them competitive. So we've got this issue with not being able to make supply chains fully transparent for larger companies and the need to have some kind of pseudo anonymous methods as we transfer products through supply chains, but still would like to be able to find out certain attributes such as whether products are organic or whether they've got a fair trade certification. So then we discovered Dapt and Ethereum and the blockchain and realized that there was a key to this, our lock of supply chain transparency. And that's really where we're at right now, which is looking to speak to the pioneers that really want to change the game for everybody. And we're starting to imagine and actually create now a digital guarantee for products that provides total authenticity and accountability, traceability for products. We're working across number of different sectors, from super precious things like art and diamonds, all the way to quite abundant things like tea and coffee.
00:04:57.580 - 00:05:16.500, Speaker A: And we believe that the blockchain particularly can be a real step change technology that can seriously affect how we understand our material world and how much we know about certain things we buy and how stakeholders within a supply chain understand the large value web therein.
00:05:20.440 - 00:05:21.092, Speaker B: Right.
00:05:21.226 - 00:05:22.772, Speaker A: So this is where we are.
00:05:22.826 - 00:06:06.398, Speaker B: So we started building a decentralized application built on Ethereum to track our material things that we surround us, that we have around us. So we're using the Ethereum blockchain. Okay, so this is a bit small. I'll read it out. So what's the actual benefit? So we think it's an ideal tool to achieve full end to end supply chain transparency. Like a seamless method to track and record the data, the transactions, whatever happens along the supply chain. It's an ideal tool to guarantee full authenticity, where the products come from, what story is behind them.
00:06:06.398 - 00:07:12.564, Speaker B: And it's also a really good tool to track our material asset bank that surround us, to track material value and make sure that materials are fed back into the loop after the lifetime of a product. Let's go back. So how does it work? So each stage of the product, of the product's lifecycle is locked onto the blockchain along the lifecycle with unique digital tax signatures. Most of you might know how it works. So it's a set of things that come into this ecosystem. So the blockchain signatures smart contracts, but also we need to link kind of these dumb material things with unique digital tax. So yeah, each and everybody as an actor in the supply chain will sign whatever happens along the supply chain and gradually this will form a chain of.
00:07:12.602 - 00:07:16.660, Speaker A: Custody along the chain.
00:07:17.800 - 00:08:13.290, Speaker B: So it's probably instructive to look at a use case. So it's an easy one. It's just a bicycle, but what might be of interest to a customer in the end? So for example, the actual grade of steel that goes into the bicycle might be important. Or further onwards. Wait, further onwards, the welding. How is the bike actually assembled at the manufacturer? What's happening in the shop? And then finally a customer might be interested in recording whatever happens along the usage time of the bicycle. So whether it's been serviced properly, parts exchanged, because the user might want to either rent out the bicycle or sell it afterwards to another friend.
00:08:13.290 - 00:09:11.970, Speaker B: So. Right, so we think provenance is for companies that look for leap in progress and want to build on the blockchain and who are interested in the honest story behind the product. But where are we actually? So we've done some user experience design, we've done some wire framing, we've done some basic contract coding, some really basic prototype. Right. And now we are basically looking to take this more seriously. So Jesse and I met basically last May at a small makers conference in Berlin. Basically at the same time finally when I also came across Ethereum, which was kind of a lucky coincidence, Jesse had already been thinking about the blockchain, how to use it.
00:09:11.970 - 00:09:20.656, Speaker B: And then we started looking for serious funding and we're quite excited that we just got money awarded by the European.
00:09:20.688 - 00:09:24.212, Speaker A: Union and also the technology strategy board for building.
00:09:24.266 - 00:09:42.936, Speaker B: This is, I think, where other people come in. So we're looking for partners, makers that want to pioneer technology with us, but we're also looking for an extension of.
00:09:42.958 - 00:10:28.280, Speaker A: Our team for developers, designers. So yeah, making things better. Yeah. Okay, we'll go here. Cool. Yeah, so we're looking for some extra people to come and join us on this adventure as we've just got some money in the bank. We really like the idea of bringing a whole new set of people, a whole new set of stakeholders to Ethereum and adapt world that probably haven't made use of what it can do until now.
00:10:28.280 - 00:10:39.530, Speaker A: And we believe it can be a real catalyst for social change, which is super exciting. So we love to hear from you. Please send us a message, get in touch. And yeah, we're around all night, so.
