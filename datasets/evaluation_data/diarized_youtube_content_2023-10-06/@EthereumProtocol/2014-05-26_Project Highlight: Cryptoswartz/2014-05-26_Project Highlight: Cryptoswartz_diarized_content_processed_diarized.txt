00:00:21.610 - 00:00:27.560, Speaker A: Welcome, Vlad and ethan. Vlad, do you want to introduce yourself quickly?
00:00:28.570 - 00:00:37.654, Speaker B: Sure. I'm Vlad, one of the co inventors of cryptosworts. Among other things, I guess.
00:00:37.852 - 00:00:38.934, Speaker A: Okay. And you?
00:00:38.972 - 00:00:46.200, Speaker C: Ethan, other co inventor, also among other things pertaining to the Internet and life in general.
00:00:46.570 - 00:00:52.334, Speaker A: So Cryptoswartz is the project that you presented at the hackathon in Toronto last month?
00:00:52.452 - 00:00:52.894, Speaker C: That's right.
00:00:52.932 - 00:00:55.598, Speaker A: And did you guys win a prize for that? Didn't you?
00:00:55.764 - 00:00:57.854, Speaker C: Yeah, we came. Awesome.
00:00:57.972 - 00:01:04.420, Speaker A: Awesome. So can you tell us a little bit more about what crypto Schwartz is, how it works, what its purpose is?
00:01:04.870 - 00:01:05.726, Speaker B: Shotgun.
00:01:05.838 - 00:01:07.460, Speaker C: Sure. Yeah, go for it.
00:01:07.910 - 00:01:31.740, Speaker B: So cryptoschwartz is a platform where you can identify content, hashtag it, upvote, and download the hashtags in a way that you're rewarded crypto tokens if you predict the way people vote later. So we hope that it's going to be an incentivization layer for constructing semantic web for all sorts of content that can be basically linked to with.
00:01:32.510 - 00:01:38.394, Speaker A: So it's like a Reddit where you can earn something if your content is popular. Is that the idea?
00:01:38.592 - 00:02:10.018, Speaker C: Yeah, but it's not just about your content, it's about how you rank the content. And we're trying to move away with just this brute force upvote, downvote mechanic that's so prevalent on the web and actually introduce a semantic aspect to it so that users, they only get rewarded for voting on tags, not on content itself. So you vote on a label on the content. Right. And so it's not just about the people producing the content, it's about the people that are accurately describing it and ranking it, essentially.
00:02:10.114 - 00:02:14.790, Speaker B: Yeah. And it's not about value judgments as much as it is about accurate descriptions.
00:02:15.770 - 00:02:16.182, Speaker A: Okay.
00:02:16.236 - 00:02:17.990, Speaker C: But it can't be about value judgments.
00:02:19.230 - 00:02:26.380, Speaker A: What sort of technical challenge did you encounter when you built it, and where are you in the deployment of that project?
00:02:27.230 - 00:02:57.640, Speaker C: Well, we're still pretty early on. Obviously, one of the main concerns with the decentralized system is a secure consensus mechanism. So we're not going to build a blockchain ourself. We're thinking of doing this on Ethereum, obviously, and so we've got that out of the way. But to build a publishing system with voting and where you're rewarding for voting, we need a secure reputation system as well. And so we're very sort of early in the stages of figuring out how that's going to work.
00:02:58.170 - 00:03:03.960, Speaker A: It sounds like reputation systems are at the core of pretty much everything on Ethereum going forward.
00:03:04.490 - 00:03:10.122, Speaker C: Yeah. The future of the Internet is going to hinge on the reputation systems we come up with. Right.
00:03:10.256 - 00:03:26.480, Speaker A: And could those reputation systems be shared across multiple applications? So you have your cryptoswarts sort of social network tagging and so on. Could somebody building a decentralized eBay could leverage this as well to extract reputation formation from that?
00:03:26.930 - 00:03:48.360, Speaker B: Yeah. So there's a couple of concepts of reputations. There's reputation for someone, like, to someone, and then there's reputation, which is more like an identity. An identity is kind of like a collection of reputations. So anyone should be able to access your identity and look at the reputations that you have to different dows, for example.
00:03:48.730 - 00:03:49.142, Speaker C: Right.
00:03:49.196 - 00:04:05.180, Speaker B: So you might have a reputation for crypto shorts. You might have a reputation for some other daos, and another dao might be able to access those reputations in order to make a judgment about whether or not you're likely to contribute or something.
00:04:05.550 - 00:04:08.940, Speaker A: How do you plan to monetize something like this, if at all?
00:04:09.470 - 00:04:12.720, Speaker C: It's self monetizing. Right.
00:04:13.650 - 00:04:37.670, Speaker B: So the way crypto Schwartz works is that the tokens that are issued for predicting other people's votes are the tokens that are required to use the system. So if the system is fun to use and people love it, then the tokens are going to have a price, and it's going to be monetized for the users based on their accurate, socially predictive use of the system.
00:04:37.740 - 00:04:49.814, Speaker A: Right. And that's the users obviously benefiting from having identified early, either axe content producers and so on. What about you guys? Do you get a cut of this? If so, how?
00:04:49.932 - 00:05:23.694, Speaker C: Well, we're early adopters, and the fun thing about all these crypto technologies is, yeah, they're open source. And in the long term, the inventors don't get to control the project, and the inventors don't get to benefit forever, disproportionately, because we get in it early, then if we're producing content early, then we'll reap rewards from that. But the important thing is to build a system that can compound value instead of eating up the value of all its users. Right. We want to give back to the users because they're doing so much work anyways. Right. They're spending all day on Facebook and Twitter.
00:05:23.694 - 00:05:25.426, Speaker C: They should be getting rewarded for that. Yeah.
00:05:25.448 - 00:05:28.090, Speaker A: And right now, it's the advertisers that get rewarded.
00:05:28.190 - 00:05:29.720, Speaker C: Of course. Yeah, exactly.
00:05:30.090 - 00:05:31.400, Speaker A: All right. That makes sense.
00:05:34.170 - 00:06:28.886, Speaker B: Another way that we can monetize it, in a sense, is that for anything living on ethereum, you need to pay expenses in ether and if your users are paying expenses in the sub currency, then there's a conversion that takes place between the user fees return on the sub currency and the ether, which is required for operations. So any excess ether can be used to pay back investors that provided the initial ether which was used while the sub currency doesn't have any price. So if we invest in the system, then we can be repaid from the fees that the users use on the application later. And the idea is to have the profit be basically as minimal as you can, given the fact that you don't want it to go bankrupt. Because if it goes bankrupt, then kind of it grinds to a halt.
00:06:28.998 - 00:06:29.660, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:30.350 - 00:06:35.210, Speaker A: So are you guys a startup? Are you looking for investors? What are your general plans?
00:06:37.390 - 00:07:17.510, Speaker B: We're discussing it. So right now my favorite model is to have a nonprofit that starts up Daos or DACs, and where you can make profit in those DACs, but those are separate entity from the nonprofit which funded their development, because the development itself actually can't easily be directly funded by the investors in the DAC unless you pre sell shares in the DAC. And that has legal consequences or implications, or it kind of might exist in a legal context. That's cumbersome.
00:07:19.930 - 00:07:29.526, Speaker A: How do you see sort of the future of crypto Schwartz unfold? I mean, do you have a release schedule? Obviously, Ethereum is not live yet, so it's not until December, I imagine.
00:07:29.718 - 00:08:15.370, Speaker C: Right, well, you know, so we're sort of working on our own version of the pytherium client and sort of making it work for everything cryptoschwartz needs so that we can test it on our own. But like I've said, sort of cryptoswarts going big is going to depend on us solving a number of technical problems, the main one probably being reputation. Another nice one would be data hostage and storing to be able to monetize that or incentivize that. But in the coming year, we'll probably see this thing live somewhere. It'll be centralized to begin with, and we'll try and bootstrap it to get some trustworthy people putting reputable content on it so we can sort of test out the dynamics of the thing and basically have a test net going, I'd say, in the next year or so.
00:08:15.440 - 00:08:21.840, Speaker A: All right, brilliant. Where can people learn more about this? Is there a blog post or website or something?
00:08:22.210 - 00:08:27.950, Speaker C: We have some Google Docs, but we're working on putting everything together in a sort of nicer presentation.
00:08:28.930 - 00:08:44.958, Speaker B: We're still in the research stages in terms of figuring out how it'll actually work in a way that's not exploitable the way we initially designed it at the hackathon as a proof of concept turns out how to attack vectors that could be exploited by an arbitrarily small group of users.
00:08:45.054 - 00:08:46.098, Speaker A: Okay, fair enough.
00:08:46.184 - 00:09:31.540, Speaker B: Fair enough. That's an issue and we kind of addressed it at the hackathon, but we didn't really realize how big of an issue it was until more thought was put into it. Right. I think maybe this interview will be a really good source for people to learn about crypto Schwartz. Here's a really neat aspect, crypto Schwartz is that you don't need cooperation from the platform who's posting the data that you're hashtagging. So if you post a really great Facebook status update, I can identify know if it's public, and then people can upload and downvote hashtags on it. And then we don't need to compete with Facebook's network effect to ride on their network effect.
00:09:31.540 - 00:09:53.720, Speaker B: And then if Facebook is so kind as to give you an ethereum public key, then we can give you tokens if a lot of attention is drawn to your status update. And then we don't need to negotiate with Facebook for that. But they, if they want to benefit their users, will be so kind as to maybe give us a little logo with a little hashtag thing on it, or at very least a public key.
00:09:54.810 - 00:10:01.390, Speaker A: That's awesome. I think you're going to get a phone call from Mark Zuckerberg just after publishing review, I think. Awesome.
00:10:01.460 - 00:10:02.800, Speaker C: That'd be nice. Yeah.
00:10:03.730 - 00:10:14.942, Speaker A: All right. Well, cheers, guys. Well, thank you very much for your time and we'll catch up again fairly soon and learn more about what you've built since then.
00:10:15.076 - 00:10:16.142, Speaker C: Cool. Great, good.
00:10:16.196 - 00:10:19.050, Speaker A: Thanks very much, guys. Cheers. Bye.
