00:00:19.930 - 00:00:33.160, Speaker A: Welcome, everyone. Today we have Airlock, a team that we discovered at the hackathon in Toronto in crypto we trust. Joining me today we have John, Alex and Zach. John, do you want to introduce yourself quickly?
00:00:33.530 - 00:00:44.810, Speaker B: Sure. My name is John Garrett. I currently live in southern Ontario, Canada, and I'm an it professional by trade with a focus on the physical electronic security industry.
00:00:45.310 - 00:00:47.050, Speaker A: Awesome. What about you, Alex?
00:00:47.710 - 00:00:55.360, Speaker C: I'm Alex Leverington. I'm born and raised in Texas and I'm the programmer on the team.
00:00:56.290 - 00:00:58.110, Speaker A: Okay. And Zach?
00:00:59.090 - 00:01:08.114, Speaker D: Hi, I'm Zachie. I live in Toronto. I'm a software developer. I have a background in computer science and I've been into wearable technology over the past year.
00:01:08.312 - 00:01:14.020, Speaker A: Brilliant. Brilliant. So can you guys tell us a little bit more about your project, the elevator pitch, so to speak?
00:01:15.370 - 00:01:37.562, Speaker B: Sure. Essentially what we're trying to do at the very basic level is to integrate raspberry PI with Ethereum contract. Basically we have a piece of software that would run on the PI and it would monitor the state of a contract and the output on the GPIO pins of the Raspberry PI would trigger based on the state of that contract. Cool.
00:01:37.616 - 00:01:41.840, Speaker A: So are you guys trying to say decentralize Airbnb, for example?
00:01:43.010 - 00:01:53.460, Speaker B: Absolutely. That was our use case scenario that we used at the hackathon, and it's one of the most applicable use cases that we were able to come up with.
00:01:53.830 - 00:02:02.180, Speaker A: Brilliant. So if you plan to decentralize Airbnb, then all transactions will be peer to peer, so to speak.
00:02:02.550 - 00:02:03.300, Speaker B: Correct.
00:02:06.170 - 00:02:13.910, Speaker A: How do you monetize something like this? That's a common question that people have about Ethereum or Ethereum based applications.
00:02:16.170 - 00:02:45.154, Speaker C: We can monetize that through services, also through the contracts themselves, requiring a fee to execute the contract. It sort of depends on the property and how it's locked up and of course going and selling the hardware and installing the hardware as well. But there's a couple of avenues for generating revenue from it.
00:02:45.272 - 00:02:50.340, Speaker A: Cool, so you're talking about hardware. John, can you maybe show us what it looks like?
00:02:51.030 - 00:03:32.602, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So what we have right now, obviously, is nothing that we've designed or manufactured, but it's kind of the tools of the trade for the industry I'm involved in. So basically what we're looking at here, what I'm going to focus on is the electronic strike here. And basically it just replaces a standard non electronic strike on a door and when voltage is applied to it, it unlocks. It's essentially a very simple product in and of itself. Now there's also other things that can be on the door, as far as door contact, can monitor the state of the door, whether it's open or closed, as well as other inputs that can be utilized as well.
00:03:32.756 - 00:03:39.986, Speaker A: Brilliant. Brilliant. So the Ethereum is Ethereum. The plan is to have Ethereum on the Raspberry PI itself, correct?
00:03:40.088 - 00:03:43.220, Speaker B: Or a version of an Ethereum client? Yes.
00:03:44.630 - 00:04:04.890, Speaker D: Just to add to that, we're not really focusing specifically on Raspberry PI. We're looking more broadly at sort of the Internet of things and embedded systems. So wherever we have kind of microcontrollers, which are kind of crypto secure, that's the direction that we want to go in where we can run software that is speaking to Ethereum on embedded systems.
00:04:06.750 - 00:04:11.100, Speaker A: So what you're saying is it could be applicable to say something like zipcars, for example.
00:04:12.110 - 00:04:44.134, Speaker D: Right, exactly. Wherever we can get a microcontroller with an embedded software system running, that's kind of the space that we're looking at. And just to kind of go a bit broader than Airbnb, that's, as John said, one of the more commercial applications that will resonate with a lot of people when you try and explain to them what we're trying to do. But effectively, what we're looking at is the intersection of smart property, the sharing economy, the Internet of things, and then, of course, the new generation of, I guess, the blockchain technology.
00:04:44.252 - 00:04:44.534, Speaker C: Right.
00:04:44.572 - 00:04:48.310, Speaker D: So we kind of sit in the sweet spot of these spaces.
00:04:50.730 - 00:04:58.650, Speaker A: Do you have any other sort of application that comes directly to mind in terms of what you could do with that type of technology beyond opening doors?
00:05:02.690 - 00:05:52.890, Speaker D: Well, we've explored the idea of lockboxes in urban centers as one of the areas that would be interesting to look at at this point, given the early stage of kind of where the technology is and where the adoption in the mainstream is, it's going to be very interesting to see which areas kind of we get most traction in. I suspect it'll be in communities where bitcoin and ethereum is going to be widely adopted. And on the other side, it could potentially be in spaces where there is a need for or a desire to kind of push the standard of security away from what is out there in the market today to something more secure and something decentralized.
00:05:53.310 - 00:05:59.662, Speaker A: Brilliant. So you guys are officially a startup. Are you looking for investors? What's your plan?
00:05:59.716 - 00:07:08.146, Speaker D: Basically, yeah. So right now we're a founding team of four. It's myself, Alex, John and Nate. We came together at the hackathon, and coming out of it, we had a really good dynamic. So we decided to continue with building out the technology and exploring the ecosystem and the community to see what type of support we'd be getting. So far we've gotten some good interest from some of the local kind of Toronto based incubated spaces that we're looking at kind of getting into so that we can step it up from where we are right now and kind of formally incorporate and move forward and have some sort of short term milestones for three months, at which point we expect that some of the underlying technology would, specifically ethereum would be further developed and the market would be clearer for us. So we're looking to get onto that track of getting smaller amounts of investments so that we as a team can get started, potentially grow the team a little bit and get, I guess, some proof of concepts or some co working spaces set up with kind of contract based decentralized electronic security systems.
00:07:08.258 - 00:07:20.060, Speaker A: That sounds great. So in terms of where people can learn more about your project, maybe follow your progress, is there a website or GitHub, repo or Twitter you guys would like to mention?
00:07:20.910 - 00:07:42.670, Speaker D: Yeah, our website is up. It's airlock me. There's some information about us, a little bit about the pitch that we have going in at the moment, and hopefully we'll be updating that with some content about what we're doing, where we are. We have a little blog going, so it's still early days for us, but this is kind of how things start.
00:07:42.820 - 00:07:43.834, Speaker A: Brilliant. Brilliant.
00:07:43.882 - 00:08:11.000, Speaker C: Cool. We have a GitHub account, GitHub.com airlock, and right now the only thing we have posted there is the ethereum code required to watch the blockchain contracts for triggering the GPIO. And I'm sure we'll be posting some other things up there as well as we get them tested and built out.
00:08:11.450 - 00:08:20.454, Speaker A: Great. Well, that sounds all great, guys. I'll post the link into the YouTube video description and thank you very much for your time today and I'm sure we'll catch up with you soon.
00:08:20.592 - 00:08:22.880, Speaker D: Yeah. Nate, are you on the.
00:08:24.770 - 00:08:26.014, Speaker C: Couldn'T, we couldn't get him.
00:08:26.052 - 00:08:27.578, Speaker A: Nate couldn't make it, unfortunately.
00:08:27.674 - 00:08:43.326, Speaker D: Oh, that's too bad. Nate is really kind of one of our founding members who's got a lot of interest in the space and has really been kind of on the visionary side of our thinking here. So we've been good to have him, but maybe he'll share some of his thoughts in a blog post which we.
00:08:43.348 - 00:08:48.150, Speaker A: Can share with be. That would be great. Yeah, blog to track your progress would be wonderful.
00:08:49.210 - 00:08:49.814, Speaker B: Definitely.
00:08:49.932 - 00:08:55.480, Speaker A: Brent well, thank you very much for your time today, guys. We're just under ten minutes, and I'm sure we'll speak to you soon.
00:08:55.930 - 00:08:56.850, Speaker D: Thanks, Stefan.
00:08:56.930 - 00:08:57.426, Speaker A: Bye bye.
00:08:57.458 - 00:08:58.066, Speaker C: Thank you, Stefan.
00:08:58.098 - 00:08:59.970, Speaker D: Bye, guys. Bye.
