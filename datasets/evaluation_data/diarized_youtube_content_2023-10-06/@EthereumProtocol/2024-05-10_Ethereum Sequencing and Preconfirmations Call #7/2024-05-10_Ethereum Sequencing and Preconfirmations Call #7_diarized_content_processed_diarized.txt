00:00:08.320 - 00:01:10.344, Speaker A: Okay, welcome everyone to sequencing and preconfirmations, call number seven. Today we have a couple of presentations, one by me on bootstrapping base pre conformations. How do we go from zero to one? And then we also have a talk from Sasha, who's going to share the lido perspective on pre confirmations and restaking more generally. So without much ado, let me try and share my screen and get started. Okay, bootstrapping base preconfirmations. This is a fairly short talk, but hopefully has a couple ideas that might be new to you. So the talk is in two parts.
00:01:10.344 - 00:02:14.164, Speaker A: First of all, I want to highlight two small tweaks to the design that I've been talking about so far. And those two tweaks kind of help with the bootstrapping process, in my opinion. Then two, I want to talk about the coordination game that's involved. It's kind of this multi party, complicated game, and how can we try and simplify it to get to mainnet as quickly as possible? Okay, design ideas. So idea number one tries to solve the problem of the empty look ahead. So in the if research posts on base preconfirmations, there's basically this requirement that in order to have pre confirmations at every slot, you need at least something like 15% to 20% of validators opted in so that you have a nonempty look ahead. At least one sequencer in the look ahead 20% of all each stake is about $20 billion.
00:02:14.164 - 00:03:02.584, Speaker A: So we're asking a lot in terms of operators opting in. And there's this really cool idea from lime chain, which I call sequencer fallbacks, which basically totally removes this requirement. We can basically launch with one single validator that opts in as opposed to 20% of validators. So the idea is super simple. It's basically picked a sequencer at random whenever the look ahead is empty. So you basically look at the registry of sequences that have put down collateral, for example, 1000 eth. They are candidate sequences, but it so happened that right now there's none of them in the look ahead.
00:03:02.584 - 00:04:13.002, Speaker A: We'll just choose one at random. Now, one of the questions you may have is, isn't this a little complicated? Because now the Atslaw N plus 31, this random sequencer doesn't have proposing rights. And so all the pre conformations that they've made, they can't actually guarantee settlement. But there's kind of a few remarks here, like remark number one is that ethereum layer one is already relatively censorship resistant. If you want to get a transaction on chain, you can get it usually within one slot, like in the next slot, but with extremely high probability, you can get it within, let's say, four slots. And so for the first 28 slots, 32 minus four, it's actually very, very safe for this random sequencer to be giving preconfirmations. And what they can do is they can stop at slot 28 giving preconfirmations, because those are kind of more risky preconfirmations.
00:04:13.002 - 00:05:05.220, Speaker A: And so, in some sense, we've reduced the problem from having 32 slots without preconfirmations to just having four slots without preconfirmations. So that's already quite nice, but it turns out we can do a little bit better, especially during the bootstrapping phase. So what we can do is look at the next sequencer, who will show up eventually in the look ahead. And there's several cases. Like case number one is that these two sequences in green are actually the same entity, and that might actually happen with relatively high probability at the beginning if there's only one or two gateways. Another possibility is that these guys are actually friendly to each other, like they know each other, they trust each other. So it could be the titan relay and ultrasound relay, for example.
00:05:05.220 - 00:05:56.464, Speaker A: We loosely collaborate this weak trust involved. And so what you can do is basically ask this sequencer to take into account all the preconfirmations that were made here, even though they might not be settled on chain yet. And so, yeah, especially during the early days, where I expect just a handful of gateways, all of which will know each other, all of which will probably be participating in these calls. I think we can actually have preconfirmations at every single slot, even with a tiny fraction of the validators actually opting in. Any, any questions on this first idea of sequencer fallbacks?
00:05:58.684 - 00:06:22.684, Speaker B: Sorry, I don't understand. What happens if the sequencer from n plus 33 gives preconformations from n to n plus 32, and it overloads where it could not respect them, and now it falls back to, it comes to their own slot. Do they have to fulfill all of them? What if they're given more than the block space they have access to?
00:06:24.144 - 00:07:23.696, Speaker A: Okay, so there's several things here. Like, first of all, is that the sequencer slot, n plus 33, they only have precedence over these three slots, n plus 32, all the way up to n plus 33. They don't have the ability to do preconfirmations here. Another thing is that in general, as a sequencer, you don't want to give out too many preconfirmations, because otherwise you might grow a backlog, as you said, that you can't fulfill. And so really what you want to be doing is as you give preconfirmations, you kind of want to include them on chain relatively quickly. And here for this random sequencer there's opportunities to clear the queue as he goes along. But for this n plus 31, this is especially problematic to give preconfirmations because basically if they give a preconfirmation, they basically need to make sure that it arrives in this slot.
00:07:23.696 - 00:07:44.234, Speaker A: It settles here in this slot. But if they're friendly with the pre conferred slot, n plus 31, well, this friendly sequencer will just say, okay, even though you didn't get your pre conformation included here, I'll try to just include it in this one or this one. I'll kind of take it under my umbrella, if that makes sense.
00:07:44.774 - 00:07:59.154, Speaker B: And that's why there's a window between 31 and 33, because the slot might not arrive by 33. What's the relationship between n plus 33, n plus 32 and n plus 31?
00:08:01.574 - 00:08:50.284, Speaker A: So N plus 31 and n plus 33, these are controlled by the same sequencer. And these here are all controlled by the same sequencer. So that's already one key difference. And the awkward part is basically this transition phase when we go from one sequencer to another one. And basically what I'm arguing is that this transition phase is actually just a few slots, is something like four slots. If you can get a transaction on chain within four slots with very high probability, then that's a relatively small transition phase. But you can basically get this transition phase down to zero if these two guys know each other, which more likely than not is going to be the case in the first few weeks and months.
00:08:51.504 - 00:08:56.724, Speaker C: In the current setting it's assumed that the sequencer is sequencing for the whole epoch, right?
00:09:01.284 - 00:09:31.934, Speaker A: Not necessarily so. I mean, in this specific slide then yes, the random sequencer is for the whole epoch. But in general, if there's lots of green sequencers here within the slot, then they'll have only fractions of epochs. Does that answer the question? So if there's like three sequences in this epoch, then they will each have one of three parts of the epoch? Justin?
00:09:32.354 - 00:09:47.054, Speaker D: Yes, just as a quick remark, another option there is for each of the gray slots to have one of these randomness there, just to mention it as an option there.
00:09:47.554 - 00:10:46.724, Speaker A: But one of the difficulties with doing that other option is that you're increasing the number of transition points. So here there's only one awkward transition point, whereas if you have lots of random ones, you might have 32 awkward transition points. And the awkward transition points can either be smoothed out with this assumption that you can get transactions on chain within four slots, that's fine. Or with this kind of, this friendliness assumption that these entities actually know each other and they're talking to each other. I mean, this notion of forwarding pre conformations from one entity to another could also be helpful whenever this sequencer just can't handle the load. So there's more than 30 million gas of pre conformation requests in this slot. And basically the sequencer here needs to tell users, okay, please start talking to this other sequencer.
00:10:47.464 - 00:10:54.524, Speaker C: So in that case, we're kind of creating a preconf pool just like we have transaction pools.
00:10:57.304 - 00:11:11.044, Speaker A: Yes, you could say that sequences in the look ahead are kind of like a pool. It's like a scarce resource, and once it's fully consumed, then you can try and go to the next one to get a preconfirmation.
00:11:12.564 - 00:11:19.828, Speaker B: Sorry, slot n plus 31 is twice on the slide. Is that an error or is that intentional?
00:11:19.956 - 00:11:26.024, Speaker A: Oh shit. Yeah, that's an error. That should be 32, 33, 34. Apologies for that.
00:11:36.724 - 00:11:46.574, Speaker B: Okay, so wait, so the proposal of the sequencer that's not n plus 33 is actually n 34, so that's in the next epoch.
00:11:47.914 - 00:12:31.234, Speaker A: Yes. So they're not part of look ahead like right now, but they will be in look ahead eventually. Okay, yeah, sorry, that's a typo here. I got my numbers wrong. Now the, the other idea is to try to solve the problem that at the very beginning there will be like zero incentives to provide pre confirmations. It will be kind of a loss leading type of activity. And asking pre confers to put down stake that can be slashed in my opinion, is a really big ask, especially with nascent code, which could be buggy.
00:12:31.234 - 00:13:08.486, Speaker A: And so the suggestion that I have instead is what if we relax, relax the slashing to just freezing. So we still require sequences and gateways to put 1000 ETH because that's eventually what we're going to need. But instead of slashing it, we just freeze it whenever there is a bad event. So there's two types of bad events. There's the state defaults and live defaults. If either of these happen, then you freeze the stake for one week, for example, or one day or some amount of time. And during that amount of time that entity can't provide pre confirmations anymore.
00:13:08.486 - 00:14:12.894, Speaker A: So it's almost like a timeout. And sure this entity will be suffering the opportunity cost of money, which for 1000 if is actually not totally negligible. And so what I expect this cost of money to potentially be greater than the MEV opportunity and whatnot from sequencing in the early days. And so what I expect will happen if we do ask sequences to put in with a thousand neves is that we won't see any tourists. We will only see people who really care about bootstrapping this network. So go ahead. Or is it just maybe just someone who is not muted? Okay, any questions on this slide here?
00:14:16.454 - 00:14:25.354, Speaker C: Can't we do just, like, when we bootstrapped frame two, like, for a year, we have reduced penalties?
00:14:27.094 - 00:14:46.234, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great idea. I mean, we could have a curve which literally starts at zero, zero slashing, and then over time kind of ramps up to 100% slashing, and it could be a tapered thing. Yeah, for sure. Is there an argument to have more.
00:14:46.274 - 00:14:50.714, Speaker E: Issuance towards the people that are running these relays?
00:14:50.794 - 00:14:53.218, Speaker A: And as a result, the time value.
00:14:53.266 - 00:14:54.626, Speaker F: Money is even higher because now you're.
00:14:54.650 - 00:15:20.574, Speaker A: Missing out on potential rewards. So issuance from the l one to compensate. Yeah, yeah. This changing issuance is like a huge kind of wins. It is something that's not done lightly. I don't think that's feasible.
00:15:20.874 - 00:15:23.334, Speaker C: I think users should just pay for it.
00:15:26.634 - 00:15:52.514, Speaker A: Yes. At the very beginning, there will be literally zero pre confirmation requests until integrations are made. And, yeah, so really, the people who will be coming in at the beginning, for example, ultrasound, we're interested in helping out with preconfirmations. We're happy to have a loss leading business, and sometimes that's what we've been doing for years now.
00:15:55.934 - 00:16:06.800, Speaker F: But, yeah, just the only challenge, maybe this is an initial stage, is like, let's say you only have two of these and they both get frozen. So you're kind of people.
00:16:06.872 - 00:16:07.360, Speaker B: That's the one.
00:16:07.392 - 00:16:18.088, Speaker F: But, like, I forget who said you could do, like, the curve. So you, like, get this. You know, initially there's, you know, maybe it's only freezing for an hour, and then over time, you start to increase that or something like that, but that.
00:16:18.096 - 00:16:18.560, Speaker A: Could be a problem.
00:16:18.592 - 00:16:21.804, Speaker F: It's like you, if you freeze two of the five out, you know, what are you going to do?
00:16:24.344 - 00:16:44.938, Speaker A: Right? That's a good point. Yeah. I mean, one thing we could do is if there's one sequencer left, then it's unfreezable because it's the last remaining one, but, yeah. Did you say two of the five? I mean, yeah, once he gets an upcoming.
00:16:44.986 - 00:16:49.522, Speaker F: It's not a big deal. I think it's just like, initially have to think about how we fade it in, I think.
00:16:49.578 - 00:16:50.146, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:50.290 - 00:16:53.334, Speaker F: And people get their handle hand around this and things.
00:16:54.774 - 00:17:11.654, Speaker A: Right. I mean, I think users might also be willing to suffer, like, the degradation at the beginning, because in some sense, this is an additional feature that wouldn't be present otherwise. So in some sense, it's strict improvement.
00:17:11.814 - 00:17:27.254, Speaker C: Well, users would be using a base roll up that would be competing with roll ups that already have pre conformation. So they actually kind of already used to having preconfirmation.
00:17:28.274 - 00:17:53.972, Speaker A: That's true. But taiko at first will launch without preconfirmations. And so in some sense, for taiko users, it is a strict upgrade. But, yeah, point taken, Andrea. I think this is a good point. We should think about how long to freeze if we do go down this direction. Okay, so those were the two tweaks to the, to design that might help with bootstrapping.
00:17:53.972 - 00:18:43.810, Speaker A: And then part two is just thoughts on the coordination game. And I think to a very large extent, the effort to get from zero to one is like 80% coordination, and it's something that I do want to help with in 2024. So one idea is basically to use Taicho as a template, as a shelling point. Taiko will be the first mover. It will launch its mainnet, I believe, this month. The nice thing about Tyco is that they're, as far as I can tell, completely opinionated on specifics of the pre conformation design. Right now, they're head down working on their main net without preconfirmations.
00:18:43.810 - 00:20:07.866, Speaker A: And as far as I understand, they've been talking with all sorts of entities that could help them out, build out the infrastructure. So there's these consultancies, lime chain and nevermind, and there's startups that are also working on pre conformation. And so what I hope will happen is that all these entities kind of compete with each other and share ideas, and then Taiko ends up picking the best solution, or at least a solution which is good enough, and that whatever they pick is kind of good enough to become a shining point for everyone to copy. And so one of the things I want to make sure is that Taicho doesn't rush in between when they launch on mainnet without pre conformations and when they actually do pick the pre conformations, that there is a real process of deliberation involved. The other ideas that I have are regarding credible neutrality. So if we want, like, this initial selection by Taiko and this initial infrastructure to catch on to the whole ecosystem, it needs to be credibly neutral. And there's basically two parts to preconfirmations.
00:20:07.866 - 00:20:54.206, Speaker A: One is how do you elect the sequences? And in some sense, Taiko will have monopoly power there in terms of setting the example. And then you have the sequencer commitments, like what types of commitments are made and how is the slashing done. And the nice thing here is that the sequencer commitments is like a totally open market, totally permissionless. And in some sense, Taiko has no power, no power here. So they have full power here and no power here. Now, one of the things that might be a big advantage while bootstrapping is that there's going to be very, very low mev. There's going to be little activity, little mev, which means that we might actually not need redistribution.
00:20:54.206 - 00:21:49.006, Speaker A: There's a lot of teams out there thinking about tickets and redistribution. Well, if there's no MEV, there's maybe no need for redistribution. And one of the advantages of having no redistribution is that it means that you might not need to have a token. And so having no token could, at least in the short term, be a way to gain more credible neutrality. And then on the sequencer commitment side of things, as I mentioned, it's totally permissionless for anyone to come in with proposals for commitments. And one of the things that I think would be potentially a bad thing is if different pre confers, give out different types of pre conformation, there would be a mess from the point of view of the user. You wouldn't have a very homogeneous market here.
00:21:49.006 - 00:22:42.082, Speaker A: I have two suggestions. Maybe the simplest suggestion is just to go with the status quo of how preconfirmations are done. What is the status quo is basically first come, first serve. And this is something that wallets like metamask have already integrated in. And so there's probably specs out there where there's already a notion of a pre conformation request, a preconfirmation promise, and all we need to do is add the freezing and the slashing whenever this promise is not respected. One of the really nice things here is that from the point of view of wallets wanting to provide pre confirmations, there's very little room for maneuver. They either connect to the next pre confer or they don't connect to the next pre confer.
00:22:42.082 - 00:23:58.100, Speaker A: So from their perspective, it should be a very simple integration and pretty much the same integration that's done with centralized sequences, except that behind the scenes it's a rotating one. So instead of having just one IP address that you connect to, you just change the IP address that you connect to at every slot. Then there's the more messy, but maybe more rewarding way forward, which is that we start doing all sorts of exotic preconfirmations and we have these very advanced and sophisticated preconfirmation markets. And I think diversity is great, but maybe the more organized way of doing it is first there's a standardization phase and then there's diversity of implementation. So there's in some sense agreement on what the protocols are. And then there's diversity of implementation as opposed to having a plurality of protocols, which kind of lead to this fragmented user experience from the point of view of users. Okay, now here's a little timeline of how I think about progress in 2024.
00:23:58.100 - 00:24:51.604, Speaker A: And I think 2024 is the year where we go from zero to one. So how do we get there? So today we have the call number seven, and then we have the Taiko launch happening later this month. And in terms of events that will help out, there's the three of them that I want to highlight. So we have these two sequencing days that are happening, one in Zuberlin and one at EFCC and during Edge City in Zuzalu. One of the ideas that I have is to organize a whole sequencing week. So for five days we just focus on sequencing in person in Thailand, which is where HCT will happen. And what I'm hoping will happen is that each of these events where we actually meet in person will be a catalyst for a major milestone with preconfirmations.
00:24:51.604 - 00:25:52.608, Speaker A: So for example, in Zuberlin, where we're going to be spending multiple days together, I'm hoping that by the end of it or a few days later, we will have some sort of death net for pre conformations. And so yeah, what I'm hoping will happen is that a lot of the teams currently building preconfirmation infrastructure do come to Zuberlin. And at least within this hacker house, we can have an initial devnet for EFCC. There's going to be again a sequencing day. And I'm hoping that a few days later, after that we can have a testnet. And then seven months between now and Edge city, I'm hoping we can basically have main net. I don't want to push things to December because usually not much happens in December, but I think we can actually get Tyco mainnet preconfirmations.
00:25:52.608 - 00:26:27.584, Speaker A: Well, not just Tyco, but for everyone around this amount of time that feels reasonable to me. And I think what will happen is that once we have this in main net, all sorts of other base roll ups can come in. So for example, rise, which is a base roll up. They said they want to launch in q four, which is perfect timing, because pre confirmation will be ready, hopefully by then. That's it. Happy to. To take questions, and then we can move on to Sasha's talk.
00:26:27.584 - 00:26:48.224, Speaker A: So, yeah, happy to take questions or comments on the design ideas, the two design ideas that I presented, or some of the coordination tactics that we can use.
00:26:51.784 - 00:26:54.924, Speaker E: How many people do you think are going to.
00:26:55.424 - 00:26:57.808, Speaker A: I can hear a voice. Can you speak a little bit louder?
00:26:57.976 - 00:27:05.444, Speaker E: Sorry, it's my microphone. How many people do you think will opt into being pre conference based on that timeline?
00:27:07.624 - 00:28:02.736, Speaker A: Right, well, yeah, one of the things that we won't have by 2024 is execution tickets or execution auctions, which completely decouple validators from pre conformations. And so when we talk about a pre confer in that context, we're really talking about pre conformation gateways, which is basically the entity that, as a validator, you delegate to. I'm expecting at least one, which would be like the ultrasound relay coming in as a pre conformation gateway, but I'm hoping that others will come in. Titan expressed interest. Chain bound expressed interest. Maybe Lido could come in with a pre conformation gateway. Coinbase might come in.
00:28:02.736 - 00:28:09.794, Speaker A: I think we might have a handful, you know, by the end of the year. At least that's my hope.
00:28:12.534 - 00:28:59.910, Speaker D: Justin, can I. Can I add one more thing in here to Simon's question? I think something that we should consider is the incentives of the proposers to actually opt in as part of Simon's question. And in order for proposers to get in, it needs to be very easy for them. And if it's as easy as essentially having an upgrade on map boost or a drop in replacement of Mavboost, I think it's going to lend itself to much easier early participations by proposers. So I think this is something that also the flashbots team should be part of this conversation, because for me, they hold a significant key towards the adoption.
00:28:59.942 - 00:29:00.874, Speaker E: Of all of this.
00:29:02.874 - 00:29:29.184, Speaker A: Right, agreed. Yeah. I think in the ideal case, it's basically a tiny modification to Mavboost. There's no additional computational resources or bandwidth or anything like that. Basically, instead of connecting to a relay, you connect to a gateway, and it's the same flow. Otherwise the gateway gives you a header to sign. You sign it, and then that's it.
00:29:29.184 - 00:29:32.064, Speaker A: Ellie.
00:29:33.164 - 00:30:00.324, Speaker G: Yeah, so I'm just trying to get my head around the different pieces of infrastructure that needs to be built for this to work. So I think that we have the modification to Mevboost. Like a modification to existing relays so that they can be these pre conformation gateways. Presumably some interface for a user to actually request a pre confirmation through some wallet or something. Is there any pieces I'm missing?
00:30:01.824 - 00:30:25.864, Speaker A: Right. We also need a registry on chain for the gateways to register and post collateral and get frozen. In terms of the integration with the wallet for the users, I think that already exists for wallets like metamask. Yeah.
00:30:26.724 - 00:30:39.744, Speaker D: Andrew, can you talk a little bit more about that? Maybe to just give a little bit more info? What's in there in metamask? Like, have they proposed the standard for pre conformations? And they have embedded in metamask.
00:30:41.564 - 00:31:22.114, Speaker A: Right. So I actually haven't looked at the metamask code base, but my understanding is, as a user, if you're using optimism or arbitrum and you kind of click send on metamask, you get the green checkmark immediately. That's part of the value proposition of arbitrum and optimism. In some sense. There is already an API endpoint to send a transaction to a sequencer and get from the sequencer a confirmation or promise that your transaction will be included in some way. And here's your price. You already know how much you're paying.
00:31:22.114 - 00:31:39.674, Speaker A: And so really what needs to change is the recipient of this API call, instead of being the same entity, the centralized sequencer, every single time. It's a rotating gateway. Eli, have you had that?
00:31:40.774 - 00:32:00.854, Speaker G: Yeah, I guess. As far as this registry for posting collateral, um, it seems like I don't, at least as far as I understand, I don't think Eigen layer, like, could quite support, you know, posting that level of collateral. So is the plan not to use something like restaking for this initial, uh, like this initial testnet and kind of roll, like roll our own or. What are your thoughts?
00:32:02.194 - 00:32:49.508, Speaker A: Right. So I did talk to Sriram about this, and he did mention that it is possible to, to take multiple validators and expose the whole group against like one slashing condition. So if something bad happens, actually, like, you know, 30 different validators get slashed at the same time. Having said that, like, in some sense, the gateways, if we think of them as being relays or entities like that, like, they, they don't necessarily stake. And so, like, restaking for them might not be, might not be the natural move. Yeah. And there is also a concern about credible neutrality.
00:32:49.508 - 00:33:40.114, Speaker A: Like, if we do pick Eigen layer, then that is some sort of opinion that's being made. So I don't have a strong opinion here. My guess is that a thousand neph is like a small enough amount that like the additional yield from staking that you're missing out on is maybe not too much of a big deal. And also one of the nice things about doing this is that again, the opportunity costs might be higher than what you stand to make with pre confirmation tips. And so really those who are showing up in the market are truly serious and in some sense altruistic, as opposed to being a tourist kind of spamming and potentially degrading the experience early on.
00:33:40.934 - 00:33:41.874, Speaker G: Makes sense.
00:33:44.454 - 00:34:40.756, Speaker F: Andrew, I just wanted to say I'm not sure why my Zoom still says grabben Howard, I'm no longer there, but showing my some efforts we have going out. So a couple of us are coming together and talking with a lot of proposers about would they be amendable to adapting, um, you know, things propose or commitments more generally, but our focus is pre conf initially, but also inclusionless. And so far the conversations have been quite receptive. I think it's, you know, not the big, big validators, but the ones that are more on the frontier side. So maybe even by June in Berlin, we'll have a devnet on our side with how we're kind of thinking about plugging in proposer commitments to the proposer and have a good sense, better sense around, you know, what are their requirements, how do they think about this? Even though the pre comp market isn't huge, trying to get some bootstrap going, so probably in June we'll have a lot more information. But if others are doing this, we're happy to engage and help doing this as open source, open development projects. So no specific company or team behind it.
00:34:40.756 - 00:34:42.504, Speaker F: So hopefully incredibly neutral.
00:34:44.804 - 00:34:51.584, Speaker A: Very nice. I think, Andrew, you'll be coming to Zubalin, right?
00:34:52.844 - 00:34:54.944, Speaker F: I'll be there, making it all the way to Berlin.
00:34:55.324 - 00:34:55.708, Speaker A: Nice.
00:34:55.756 - 00:35:45.784, Speaker D: Justin, can I highlight a little bit of concern, just on the practical side about the timeline? As people that have looked into the implementation side of this, you kind of, some implementations might require some forms of validation of the BLS keys of the proposers, of the validators, of the l one validators. And just wanted to err, a word of caution that if this is part of the implementation for some of the devnets or testnets that are there, the vector updates needs to happen in order for the EAP, for BLS verification to happen. And I'm not sure when this is scheduled for, just it might impact the timelines that you are mentioning here.
00:35:46.964 - 00:35:51.724, Speaker A: Okay, got you. So that would be a gas efficiency, right? Yes, yes, yes.
00:35:51.764 - 00:35:59.620, Speaker D: This is when you want to, for some reason you want to prove something about the validators, the specific validator in the validator set.
00:35:59.812 - 00:36:01.504, Speaker A: Right. That makes sense.
00:36:02.724 - 00:36:25.894, Speaker C: Do you have an idea of the gas cost with the currently proposed gas prices? Because I'm trying to petition for reducing the gas cost of the EIP 25 37, but I had no feedback so far. Having an actual application would be helpful to lobby.
00:36:32.874 - 00:36:34.010, Speaker D: No, I don't.
00:36:34.162 - 00:36:37.334, Speaker A: If this was for me, I don't, I don't either.
00:36:38.914 - 00:36:39.974, Speaker C: Okay, thanks.
00:36:42.714 - 00:36:53.924, Speaker A: Okay, next up we have Sasha who will talk about thoughts on pre comps from lido contributors. Sasha, the floor is yours.
00:36:54.504 - 00:36:55.884, Speaker E: Can you hear me okay?
00:36:56.184 - 00:36:57.004, Speaker A: Yes.
00:36:57.424 - 00:37:29.868, Speaker E: Okay. I'll just put up my screen quickly and say hi, bad Internet. So I'm going to cut it, see if I can share it. Okay. Desktop. Okay. Can you see my screen okay?
00:37:30.036 - 00:37:30.784, Speaker A: Yes.
00:37:31.524 - 00:38:46.836, Speaker E: Okay. So here's the talk on Lido, on preconds. It's, you know, it's quite high level. It's not meant to be super technical, and it's more like the end is basically open questions and a small call to action. The background on me is I'm currently a Lido contributor researcher. I've been base royal upfield since I heard about Justin, since I heard Justin present his vision back in October. Some relevant context today is Hasu has just proposed a suggested path forward for lido in terms of the high level takeaway here is that the mission hasn't changed, but there is a need to respond to how much the market has changed over the last few months.
00:38:46.836 - 00:40:15.734, Speaker E: And one of those, one of his suggestions is supporting Ethereum aligned validator services. Now there's obviously questions about what, if you're malign, you know, how to even define that. And one sort of, there are key constraints from, from our side with respect to not imposing any additional risk to stakers and not turning SDE into a restaking token. One sort of fundamental model here is, you know, you can think of me boost, every me boost as a sort of restaking service in the sense that validators opt into additional constraints with the possibility of penalties, at least if they are operating using Lido. And there are several contributors. I mean, to give some sort of context for this, this talk. Like I'm, I was very excited about based roll ups back in October, November, and I raised it with a bunch of contributors that were more on the research and development side because at the time I wasn't in the research in lido research, I was more on the government's team.
00:40:15.734 - 00:41:35.084, Speaker E: But everyone was sort of very bandwidth constrained. And there wasn't really, while people were excited, there wasn't really any time to sort of think about how we could help here. But a couple of weeks ago, Eugene and Sam, two sort of core lido contributors, reached out and said they were working on thinking about how to do this. And so that kind of led me to, to reach out to Justin and led to this talk. And sort of the high level here is Lido does want to continue pushing the envelope forward with respect to staking, and that means sort of actively exploring these sorts of validator services. So the expectations from our side is that, at least from a number of contributors, out of preconce will be the next widely adopted validator service after MeV Boost. But there'll be an evolution, not a substitution, with MeV Boost, and that there'll be the first of possibly a handful of Ethereum aligned sidecars.
00:41:35.084 - 00:42:42.144, Speaker E: So there are sort of three potential directions here. The first is base preconce. Clearly lido can offer access to its block space, but this would have to be opt in from a subset of the validator set. And because we don't want to increase, we want to be prepared for any sort of tail risk scenario. It would, it would involve probably an operator bond or collateral of some sort and an insurance fund. Ideally it would support trustless fashion, but that doesn't have to be there at the beginning. I'm going to skip over this because it's not that relevant.
00:42:42.144 - 00:44:08.244, Speaker E: Yeah. And so extending sort of base precons in general, we sort of see, or I see tree cons as the first of possibly a handful of ethereum aligned validation services, inclusion lists being one, another possible one. The key here and why kind of, we've been hesitant to say anything so far is like this doesn't work if Lido inserts itself as a point of influence or point of failure. So this is like what I liked about Justin's talk, for example, is that there might be a way to do the bootstrap pre comps without needing like 20% of the validated set to, to opt in. And I think that would be great. That would be like actually like a, more of a motivator for Lido to get involved because we don't want to take away from the neutrality of this. I don't think it works if Lido is kind of, if it's dependent on Lido.
00:44:08.244 - 00:45:11.052, Speaker E: So three high level sort of values guiding philosophy. North Star here is the first is like redemption risk to users absolutely should not be increased like Lido's brand truth, in my opinion, is really rooted in its security culture, almost bordering on paranoia. Like, it's hard to sort of get a sense of that from the outside. But when you're like working in the trenches there, it's like I've never quite seen. I've never seen as much attention to edge cases given as I have with the Lido devs. Yeah. So again, that it needs to stay focused on what makes it on its edge.
00:45:11.052 - 00:46:28.014, Speaker E: Right. Users need to always know the risks they're taking and where they're, you know, what conditions their funds are being subject to, what constraints and conditions. And part of that involves thinking very long term and not letting, you know, short term market cycles, or just avoiding the sort of, the madness of crowds and sort of zooming out and saying, okay, actually we need to build something that is long term resilient. So open questions here. I mean, these are quite recent. From my end, I've just sort of started diving deep again into based roll ups. So after November, I was caught up in dual governance research and.
00:46:28.014 - 00:47:34.070, Speaker E: And didn't have time to engage in these calls. But I've caught up with the calls and these questions are really focused on incredible commitments, because that's what I've been diving in this week. And so just reading them out, it's unclear to me at least, what the best way to ensure credible commitments today is and how to ensure this path is future proof. It's also unclear to me, whoever lido can just start with reputational collateral rather than economic collateral. If we do go with economic collateral, are enough node operators willing or able to post bonds? How large should the bond be? I mean, Justin mentions 1000 eTh. I think that's, that's one hypothesis. Maybe we also need an insurance fund to handle worst case scenarios.
00:47:34.070 - 00:48:55.744, Speaker E: But then there's a question of how large should that be? Lido's recently made a lot of strides with DVT, so is there a way to leverage that, to simplify things and make commitments more credible? Can you kind of lower the economic collateral if you have commitments that are enforced by several validators? Again, I'm not sure. Are there any ips that could make existing commitment designs more elegant? I haven't had the time to dig in yet. Do we expect there to be one winning precon, framework or protocol, or a plurality that can interface seamlessly together? Again, it's fuzzy. For me, it's the delineation between framework and protocol. Maybe there are many frameworks, one protocol, again, don't see that clearly. Can Lido kind of choose a framework without discouraging experimentation. Should Lido be open to experimenting with more than one framework or protocol? Can lido meaningfully improve the liveness guarantees of based roll ups? So this sort of relates to a post by chainbound, I think, that was released yesterday.
00:48:55.744 - 00:50:14.870, Speaker E: One thing that jumped out for me there is, there seems to be, at least with the current design, a there is a liveness trade off with their way of looking at things. And part of the promise for me, at least originally in November with based roll ups, was the fact that we could inherit the liveness guarantees of DL1. Now, if we're relying on an external entity on top of the proposal, how much does that matter? I think they frame it really well. The question that they ask, which is, you know, what does it mean to be based? Is there a spectrum? What does a spectrum look like? How do the dimensions of finality and liveness? It's still unclear to me how to weigh up finality versus liveness if we're thinking about being based as a spectrum. My intuition is still that likenesses should be weighted, probably more. But. But again, it's like a loosely held, loosely held opinion.
00:50:14.870 - 00:51:20.474, Speaker E: And then, you know, it's also unclear to me whether lido can improve this in any way. Yeah. And then finally, sort of more broadly, is there any way we can help bootstrap these base preconce without discouraging experimentation or influencing the outcome? Again, credible neutrality is what makes Ethereum special. It doesn't make sense to, to help with based roll ups, which is about, you know, reinforcing what makes Ethereum special, if we're going to detract from that. And in closing, sort of mini call to action, I'm open. And Eugene and Sam, who are sort of driving the research and development here, are open to collaborate with anyone who can help answer these questions that wants to work with us. Feel free to email me and I'll share my telegram and Twitter in the chat.
00:51:20.474 - 00:51:27.304, Speaker E: Okay? That's all. I don't know if I have time for questions.
00:51:28.284 - 00:52:25.234, Speaker A: Yes, we have time. We have seven minutes left. Thank you so much, Sasha, for the presentation. I mean, for me, the big takeaways are that, like, one lido is now excited about BIsPi confirmations. This was new to me, even just a couple of weeks ago, and it's partly because you now have more time on your hands, because you've pushed the research for dual governance. And then the other big takeaway for me, which is very nice to hear, is that you didn't really like the idea of using lido as a mechanism for bootstrapping to get the 20% because in some sense that meant preconfirmations rely on Lido and. Yeah, that's great to hear that you do care deeply about credible neutrality.
00:52:25.814 - 00:52:45.384, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean like, obviously if you like the only perception people have from Lido is on sort of Twitter battles, then you don't get that. But I think it's something many people within lido deeply care about. There's no, yeah, this doesn't work if, if we're detracting from that in any way.
00:52:50.604 - 00:52:52.744, Speaker A: Any questions for Sasha?
00:52:54.884 - 00:52:56.364, Speaker C: Well, hey Sasha.
00:52:56.524 - 00:52:57.544, Speaker E: Hey Rami.
00:53:00.284 - 00:54:16.034, Speaker C: So what did I want to ask? Yeah. Regarding reputational collateral, I think it's interesting because like if we want to ship reconf boosts or whatever's the name, commitment boost fast, I see two technical issues. One is restaking parts if we need to connect to a restaking protocol, eigen layer or something else. And two, it's a part with how do we, for builders, we ask them to, hey, please include this. While in the past they were used to building a blocks fully on their side. So if we can remove the economical restaking that makes it easier to implement. So I think that's, we also have like we rely on relayer a lot and they don't have any stake.
00:54:16.034 - 00:54:25.724, Speaker C: So it's not like it's the first time that we do this either or something that's opt in, right?
00:54:26.144 - 00:54:58.174, Speaker E: Yeah, I think like it's, again, I think it's like a, I mean my intuition and people can disagree here, but is that it's like the simplest way to move it forward. But, but there might be a trade off in that. Maybe it, like it puts too much reliance on, on Lido. So yeah, I again open to more thoughts on that, but agree, it's like it does simplify things, but is the trade off worth it? I'm not sure.
00:55:04.954 - 00:55:21.754, Speaker A: I mean, if we rely on reputational collateral, then Tyco needs to explicitly have a whitelist of who they consider to be reputation worthy. And then that might affect the credible neutrality, a little bit of the sequencer selection mechanism.
00:55:22.494 - 00:55:50.194, Speaker C: Well, the idea that we have internally is that we commit to a date where we remove the training wheels to say, and even for testnet, we will likely use this to prove the concept before we add any complexity regarding restaking. Or maybe we can push Ethereum l one to include one of those PEPC FNC things.
00:55:56.014 - 00:56:43.558, Speaker A: Gotcha. Okay, good to hear that you're considering it for the devnets and testnets. Any final question before we wrap up the public part of the call and open it up to the private after discussion. Sasha just shared his telegram. Handle in the chat if you want to talk to him directly. Okay. Thank you, everyone.
00:56:43.558 - 00:56:54.174, Speaker A: This wraps up the private public part of the call. Now opening it up to anyone who wants to bring up any topic of the choice.
