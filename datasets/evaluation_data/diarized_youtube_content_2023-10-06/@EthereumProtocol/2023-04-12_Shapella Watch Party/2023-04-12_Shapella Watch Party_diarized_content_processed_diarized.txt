00:02:37.830 - 00:05:04.948, Speaker A: Satan did always our hey everybody, and welcome to the Chappellapo app art paint party. This is the first 15 minutes of the Chappella upgrade stream. After that, this canvas stream will end, but the canvas will go on for a few more hours to make way for the official eth staker hosted stream over on the ethereum.org YouTube channel. So yeah, just some basics about the canvas. What you want to do first is go over to the top right and sign in. Make sure to sign in with the address that holds any of the valid entry PO apps.
00:05:04.948 - 00:05:54.360, Speaker A: Like if you purchased the entry poap, make sure that you use the correct address that holds that after you are signed in. Sorry, I'm not looking at the screen. A palette will appear on the bottom right with 16 basic colors, and when you hover over that palette, a light to dark palette will appear on the left of that color. So select one of those and then just start placing pixels. If you have any trouble placing pixels at that point, please just try reloading the page. Just note that there is a cooldown of I think it's 5 seconds by default, and the more entry pops you have, the shorter your cooldown is. Another really useful feature is that you can right click any pixel that you see and quickly grab that same color.
00:05:54.360 - 00:06:40.152, Speaker A: That is a great tool for coordinating art with your friends and it just saves a ton of time. Plus you can see if someone's attacking you, you can see who it is, so you can go yell at them on Twitter. Aside from that, if you scroll down, you can see how many pixels are being placed, who's in the leaderboard, and yeah, I think the other most useful feature is that if you have some friends that don't have poaps and they're trying to join last minute, you can delegate one of your active eligible poaps to them. So you'll just click delegate and type in their ens or paste in their address, hit delegate and boom. They now have a little bit of pixel placing power. If you don't like what they're doing, you can always revoke it. So yeah, right now I am going to start placing some pixels myself.
00:06:40.152 - 00:07:17.610, Speaker A: I have a few things I want to get set up. So let's get this going. All right? Oh, might actually. Is it going to work? I'm using a hardware wallet with this, which I have heard does work. Now, I remember in the past there was some issues using a hardware wallet. As long as your hardware wallet directly connects to metamask, you shouldn't have any issues. Although I did just do it through frame and it was also perfect.
00:07:17.610 - 00:07:46.844, Speaker A: All right. A lot of these people in the center are going to be very disappointed when this centerpiece starts recording in progress. Got it. All right, so that one's going. I recognize some people in here from the bankless community. Nifty chat rocket pool. Spence.
00:07:46.844 - 00:08:09.032, Speaker A: I'm not quite sure. I know we had a long conversation at ethnic, but I don't remember. What community are you with? Are you going rogue? What's up? Right now I'm actually trying to help Dapnode get the logo in, but I'm going to help Alex there with Nifty chat as well and maybe some. Cool, cool, cool. Yeah. I'm a big fan of Dapnode's logo. I love the gradient that they use.
00:08:09.032 - 00:08:24.788, Speaker A: Just perfect. It's beautiful. All right, sorry. I'm going to kind of go dark here for a second while I set up some stuff. This is a little complicated. It kind of looks like the shuttle. NASA shuttle.
00:08:24.788 - 00:09:04.700, Speaker A: What do you call that thing? The cockpit right here in front of me. That's a massive overstatement. It's a bunch of tabs on Firefox. That's the truth. All right. Yes. Thank you for mentioning that.
00:09:04.700 - 00:10:39.376, Speaker A: These poap art parties are always just completely like, I never know how they're going to go, and I can already see this canvas is going to get so full so fast. I cannot believe I'm starting to see an FTX logo on this canvas. That's as funny as it is. Wow. Yeah. That is a really cool new feature. I think that was added right before the merge canvas.
00:10:39.376 - 00:10:56.820, Speaker A: That was the first time I had seen it. So since the merge canvas, there's been only one other. I think we did the ens, not happy hour ens anniversary. Right with you, slobo. That was a big party as well. That was cool. Yeah.
00:10:56.820 - 00:11:20.154, Speaker A: I think these have been happening at the correct cadence where every few months is like, oh, cool, another poap art party is happening. That's awesome. Not too much, not too little. I could do this every week. This is actually just so much fun just seeing if these things can actually happen the way that the communities try to coordinate them. I'm watching it right now. Okay.
00:11:20.154 - 00:11:29.166, Speaker A: I'm seeing whack. Awesome. You're up there. Are you going with the full name or are you going with whack? Whack. Whack. Attack my full ens. So I'm going to get it all there.
00:11:29.166 - 00:12:38.274, Speaker A: Good luck. You are up there among the stars. Yeah, I'm already getting people kind of encroaching, so I'm going to have to start fighting soon. In a nice way. Yes. Wow. Yeah.
00:12:38.274 - 00:13:20.160, Speaker A: This will definitely keep going for at least, I'd say an hour, but given how fast this canvas is filling up, I mean, it's been eight minutes and it's getting there. It'll be going for at least another hour and a half or so. I do want to mention to everyone in this canvas, call when this stream ends, we're not going to jump back into the main Chapilla stream zoom room. Sorry, I'm trying to get those words right. All right, I can see bankless appearing next to, I don't know what the tower is called. Does anybody know in Shanghai that big sort of space needle? Surely there's a name behind it. But bankless is appearing there right on the left.
00:13:20.160 - 00:13:40.788, Speaker A: Oh, I see another bankless logo, too. Nimbus client. Yeah, I used them for a very long time. I had to switch, though, because they didn't support. Actually, they do now. They do now support failover client, which is great. I might switch back because I loved the super low power requirement and ram requirement that it offered.
00:13:40.788 - 00:14:54.288, Speaker A: Great client there. Chappella seeing that, too. Right on the right side of the tower. Where is evM? Where are the EV mavericks? Where are you guys? I am still not completely set up. Wow, it's nice when you make. Yeah. After the canvas ends, they'll appear a little moto on the bottom left of the canvas you can just hit.
00:14:54.288 - 00:15:31.734, Speaker A: And that's actually always the way that I post them on Twitter. Immediately after is I go through and I just screen grab it as it goes. That being said, I'm going to mint this one. I should have minted the merge canvas so it looks like there's maybe about four minutes left of the stream. Are any of you guys in your guilds having luck? I mean, bankless is almost finished. Whack. Whack.
00:15:31.734 - 00:15:54.074, Speaker A: You're almost there. I'm doing good. I got some person helping me, which is really nice. Always. I don't even know who they are, but a couple of people are helping me. Poap I e is helping me. And I think there's someone called Nono, which is funny.
00:15:54.074 - 00:16:17.020, Speaker A: Whack, because you were the one that didn't want to delegate your poaps to anybody to help. I know, it's really nice. So I'm not going to complain about people helping me. I'm very competitive when it comes to these things. Hi fizz. Yeah. So at any point if you see someone attacking your art or helping you, you can just right click and see who they are.
00:16:17.020 - 00:16:43.646, Speaker A: I'm waiting for you to send me a file. Oh, I am almost on that. I can do that. Yes, I can. Over on discord. Sorry for the delay. Like I said, I'm sitting cockpit of a NASA shuttle right now with all.
00:16:43.646 - 00:17:23.434, Speaker A: I knew you would forget. Yeah, I did too. And that's funny because I remembered to forget. For me, they're always like a rush to try to get what I have helped coordinate or I have planned to get done. It's always hit or miss whether or not it happens. All right, there we go. So I think there's about a minute and a half left of this canvas stream and I'm going to just sort of name off some of the awesome participants that I see.
00:17:23.434 - 00:17:41.354, Speaker A: Rocket pool. You're always making an appearance and I am forgetting the name of those guys, but they're always here too. 1 second I'm going to find out. I have to name drop them unless somebody. Oh, wait, there they are. That's ens vision on the top, right? Yeah. Good job.
00:17:41.354 - 00:18:14.534, Speaker A: I'm glad to see you guys here again. I saw you there on the last canvas that we did and on the merch canvas, I believe. And a nice robot next to what I assume is the hodler con logo, the pineapple appearing next to that. So I'm sure that wizards of hex is there. Good to see you here, ev mavericks. I see a logo on the bottom, middle rightet says poap somewhere in the middle. And also there is definitely a rocket pool token appearing.
00:18:14.534 - 00:18:56.434, Speaker A: And I'm really hoping it's the racket pole logo. Given the roundness of it, I think that it's beautiful. I'm seeing a lot of communities that I don't recognize the names of, and honestly, that's great. Just the fact that poop art is expanding and going further out than even I am aware of is a testament to how fun it is. Just people want to be part of this. And I think everyone who has placed a name or a logo below the Shanghai skyline. Actually, no, I guess you won't be completely destroyed.
00:18:56.434 - 00:19:15.466, Speaker A: But it depends on what the centerpiece guild makes of your art. They may convert it to window lights, I don't know, but you can see the centerpiece is taking hold. It's really starting to make an appearance. Oh, something else is not happening. That should be. Which is the sunset in the background. Interesting.
00:19:15.568 - 00:19:19.740, Speaker B: Becca? Yeah. You ready soon?
00:19:36.640 - 00:19:41.250, Speaker A: Thank you guys for taking part in this early canvas stream. It's going to be a good time.
00:20:36.210 - 00:21:25.390, Speaker B: Everyone, welcome to the Chappella viewing party. Today we have East Taker and the Ethereum cat herders hosting us. We are watching the Shanghai Capella network fork, and we are super excited to have you here with us. We are going to go over a lot of information about what the Chappella fork is, what you should expect, what this enables, the different eips that are also going into this, into the execution layer. And we have some expert speakers for you here and to give us an overview of. And then after that we'll get a poop and we'll also go over, there's a poap canvas happening right now where you can go drop pixels. It's Poap app, poap art slash.
00:21:25.390 - 00:21:59.158, Speaker B: And if you just go to there, it'll show you the Chappella upgrade canvas. We will monitor the upgrade. We'll see how it's going. We'll talk about withdrawals and how they're looking, and we will also talk about the next fork that we expect after the Chappello fork to talk about a little bit about what's happening today. We have Tim. Do we have Tim? He's in a giant room with other people, maybe.
00:21:59.244 - 00:22:02.630, Speaker A: Hey, there we go. Hey, can you hear me?
00:22:02.780 - 00:22:04.934, Speaker B: Yes, we can hear you.
00:22:05.132 - 00:22:45.700, Speaker A: Okay, well, hi, everyone. Yeah, we're having a little chappella in real life watch party. And yeah, I can take a couple minutes to talk about what the upgrade will bring to Ethereum. So high level. The most obvious thing is Chappella is bringing us withdrawals. So validators who are stakers on the Ethereum network right now, have sort of opted into this one way transaction where they've deposited their funds, activated their validator, earned rewards on it, but had no way to withdraw their stake back to the execution layer. So the main thing that we're doing with Chapella is kind of closing that loop where validators will be.
00:22:47.830 - 00:22:51.190, Speaker B: Oh, I think you got muted.
00:22:51.930 - 00:23:04.940, Speaker A: Yeah, Tim, we lost you. It looks like you might have muted yourself. Oh, can you hear me? Yes, sorry, it said the host muted me on Zoom. Okay, sorry. What's the last thing, like you heard?
00:23:06.430 - 00:23:08.262, Speaker B: We lost you for like 10 seconds.
00:23:08.406 - 00:23:49.286, Speaker A: Okay, yeah. So Chappella, we're doing withdrawals. Prior to this, validators can only stake, but they cannot unstake and get their funds back. So the main thing that's going to be happening in this upgrade is enabling this functionality where validators who have accrued rewards on their stake will automatically get those withdrawn if they have their addresses set up correctly so you can keep validating and periodically get your rewards back. And if you wish to exit and stop being your validator, it'll also be possible to do this as part of the upgrade. So this is really the main thing that's kind of happening today. There's a couple of other small features on the execution layer that will happen.
00:23:49.286 - 00:24:26.642, Speaker A: I have the list right in front of me. Basically, we'll be introducing a new opcode called push zero. So to push zero onto the stack, if you're into contract optimizing, this is something that will be useful to you. Changing a small gas pricing. So different parts of the Ethereum state cost more or less gas to access them, depending on whether they're in memory or need to be read from disk. The Coinbase address of a block used to be treated as like being on disk, which is wrong. So we're going to treat it as in memory and lower the gas cost to access that init code.
00:24:26.642 - 00:24:59.930, Speaker A: So when you deploy a contract with init code, there's currently no limit on it beyond the actual contract size limit. So we've added the limit to that and gas metering as well. My headphones on. Yeah. So we'll be adding a limit to init code and also introducing gas metering for that. And the last thing that's probably the second most important after withdrawals, even though nothing changes in Shanghai, is we've announced we're going to deprecate self destruct. So what this means is for a very long time we've talked about deactivating.
00:24:59.930 - 00:25:50.560, Speaker A: You're changing the semantics of self destruct on Ethereum. And while this fork is not the one where this happens, it seems like very likely in the next one, the semantics of the opcode will change significantly. Developers should be aware of this and consider self destruct to be deprecated. Obviously there are contracts that exist on mainnet today that use it in many different ways, so there'll be a ton of effort put towards not breaking those contracts and making sure that the specific use cases are maintained. That said, if you have a funky new kind of use case for self destruct that you're the first to try on main net after this fork, I would not recommend that. I think you should treat it as something that's there and on the way towards being deprecated. So there's an EIP about this? EIP 60 49.
00:25:50.560 - 00:26:31.870, Speaker A: I encourage kind of contract developers to look at this to get the context on it. So yeah, that's really the main thing as well, on the proof of stake side, I mentioned this in passing, but there's two ways you can set your withdrawals credentials on a validator, either with a BLS key or with an ETH address. We'll allow as of this fork the functionality to change your withdrawal credentials. So if you have a BLS address and you want to enable withdrawals, you'll need to change this to an ETH address. And so there's a new message that you can gossip on the beacon chain to do that. So, yeah, withdrawals are the main thing. A couple of small changes to the EVM and then deprecation of self destruct.
00:26:33.650 - 00:26:36.240, Speaker B: Can you tell us a little bit about this room that you're in?
00:26:37.810 - 00:26:55.154, Speaker A: Can I? Yeah. So we're having a face to face watch party with a bunch of Ethereum enthusiasts. I have David from bankless here, Scott, a bunch of other people. What.
00:26:55.192 - 00:26:58.338, Speaker B: What part of the world are you guys? Public information.
00:26:58.424 - 00:27:10.550, Speaker A: Europe. Europe. I don't know. I didn't organize the event, so I feel bad. I don't know what I can say or not say. There's a website. Yeah, we're in Zuzalu.
00:27:10.550 - 00:27:18.090, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. We're in Zuzalu. Zuzalu City. Check it out. Yeah. Awesome.
00:27:18.160 - 00:27:47.170, Speaker B: So we have a bunch of researchers over there watching this work from over there. And from in here we have East Acre, East Kieran cat herders, we have client devs, we have other researchers, protocol teams, all kinds of people watching this right now. I'm going to pass it off to Pooja from the Ethereum cat herders so that she can introduce some of the EIP authors who are authors of the eips that are being included on this fork.
00:27:48.810 - 00:27:49.334, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:27:49.372 - 00:28:31.010, Speaker C: Next. Hey everyone, I'm Pooja Ranjan, the herder in chief with the Ethereum cat herders. I spend a decent amount of my work time in community coordination, education and process building in the Ethereum ecosystem. In less than an hour, we are going to witness Chappella upgrade go live, completing the validator lifecycle, along with a few other improvements that we will have an overview on this call later on. And thank you, Tim, for providing an overview, high level overview, of what's happening today. I often come across this question of how and why we select certain proposal for an upgrade. Well, this may not be the best time to discuss how, but we can certainly share why.
00:28:31.010 - 00:28:59.530, Speaker C: For the four core eips which are going to be deployed on the main net today, to provide a quick two to three minutes overview of each proposal, we are joined by respective EIP authors. So, may I first invite William Morris for EIP 36 51? William, if you can quickly provide your introduction and summarize the abstract rationale and benefit of this proposal to the Ethereum ecosystem?
00:29:00.290 - 00:29:39.226, Speaker A: Okay, I'm an engineer. My proposal just changes the initial access list set at the beginning of the transaction such that it includes the Coinbase address. This makes it slightly cheaper to interact with the Coinbase address. The main reason to do this is that we want to empower conditional transactions, transactions that will only confirm if they succeed. And to do this, you set a transaction with zero priority fee and you tip the coinbase. And there are a lot of transactions that do this right now. Most of them are coordinated through systems like flashbots and through the proposer builder separation system.
00:29:39.226 - 00:29:40.860, Speaker A: That's all. Thank you.
00:29:43.150 - 00:29:57.710, Speaker C: Thank you so much, William. Our next proposal is EIP 3855 push euro instruction. May I invite Alex Barizazi Alvik, if you would like to maybe talk about this proposal and what it is contributing to the Ethereum ecosystem?
00:29:58.690 - 00:30:11.570, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I hope you can hear me. We can hear you. Yeah. Right. Yeah. So my name is Alex, and I'm part of this team called Ipsilon, and this is one of our proposals.
00:30:11.570 - 00:30:56.542, Speaker A: The post zero instruction. It seems to be a tiny one, but it is quite an interesting and important one. Basically, the EVM is a stack machine where you can put values onto the stack and you can modify them and take it out. And there's a lot of instructions in EVM which take a lot of inputs, and we usually just put zeros in there. The way to put in a zero is with like a push two or push one instruction which takes certain gas to execute it. It also takes certain gas to deploy because we pay gas for each byte which is deployed to the contract. The way this is chained by post zero is that this will use less bytes, so it will be cheaper to deploy, and it also takes less gas to execute.
00:30:56.542 - 00:32:00.840, Speaker A: It takes only two gas versus three. People have already found ways to mimic what Bozero does by misusing a number of different instructions. And this actually has resulted in making reviewing security, reviewing contracts much more harder, because they are using instructions which are not meant to be used in such a way. And it also limits us to make other changes, such as there was a proposal to make transaction packages which would have broken those contracts which have misused these other instructions. I want to close this with some statistics. Unfortunately, these numbers are from like, two years ago, when we made the proposal, and we haven't actually updated the numbers, but at the time there was around almost like 400 megabytes of storage space wasted on the contracts which used these larger versions of pushes. If we had per zero by then, we would have saved 400 megabytes of state.
00:32:00.840 - 00:32:22.938, Speaker A: What is a more telling number is deploying these 400 megabytes has likely costed rather than 70 billion gas. And you can calculate how much actual money that has cost in the past. So I think it's a tiny ip, but it has quite a big effect to the people who like to work on deviant. Awesome.
00:32:23.104 - 00:32:55.766, Speaker C: So I conclude two points from here. Like this proposal was proposed about two years ago, so maybe it is delayed, but it is there. So I think people who are curious, like how we select and why we select, we select when we are comfortable with it. And just to summarize this proposal on a high level like this is to reduce the contract code size. And maybe it's a useful proposal for contract developers. Moving on to the next one. The next proposal is EIP 38 60 limit and meter in it code do we have.
00:32:55.766 - 00:32:58.466, Speaker C: Pavel, if you would like to share about this proposal.
00:32:58.498 - 00:34:31.720, Speaker A: Yes, I'm here. Hi everyone. So this EIP is also related to EVM and to init code. To explain quickly what init code is, you may be familiar with the other concepts of contract constructors. So initcode is EVM bytecode that lives for a short period of time, and its goal is to set up the contract that is being created and also decide what is the final code to be deployed and added a given address. So the problem we had with the init code is that it can have arbitrary size and there are some possible attacks, maybe not very dangerous, but something that can slow a network a bit, because we need to also do some pre processing of the init code before execution. And the AP mostly fills this gap by limiting the size of init code, and is currently the double of the size of the code that can be deployed in the state and also applies some additional gas cost proportionally to the init code size.
00:34:31.720 - 00:34:55.134, Speaker A: So I think we can consider that kind of security related AP. But yeah, it will a bit affect the contract creation on chain because it will become a bit more expensive. Yeah. Thanks for invitation and have a nice evening. Awesome.
00:34:55.332 - 00:35:18.470, Speaker C: Thank you. Just for people to understand it, like in briefly, as the name suggests, this is to limit the size and meter in its code, and it's a useful feature for EVM improvement. Our next proposal is EIP 48 95, and that is the anchor proposal for this Sharpela upgrade. May I invite Alex Stokes.
00:35:20.010 - 00:35:54.906, Speaker A: Yeah, everyone, can you hear me? Great. Yeah, I mean, I know everyone's very excited about this proposal going into this upcoming. Yeah, I mean, I think there was a pretty good summary from Tim and some others earlier, just kind of going over the main highlights, really. The idea is to take this proof of stake protocol. We all had the merge last year. That was very exciting. And there's kind of this bit where there's this lifecycle, or like this whole part of the validation protocol that was missing.
00:35:54.906 - 00:36:39.950, Speaker A: Pretty big piece, that withdrawals. And so this IP will close that loop. There's several pieces and a bunch of different intricacies, but at a high level, the idea is, one thing to kind of keep in mind is that withdrawals are automatic. And what that means is that the protocol will just look at the consensus layer and says, okay, I'm going to consider each validator in turn. When a validator is withdrawable, and there's some conditions where that's possible, but essentially it boils down to when there's stake at the beacon chain or on the beacon chain that is there, but doesn't necessarily contribute to security, then it is withdrawable. Right. So when ETH is withdrawable, then it can be withdrawn.
00:36:39.950 - 00:37:14.070, Speaker A: Makes sense. Then there's this sweep. That's kind of the main thing to keep in mind, is that every block, so many validators are considered, and you just kind of go and turn down the list. When you reach a validator, withdrawable ETH, you make a withdrawal. That withdrawal is pushed to the execution layer. So, for example, in one block, there's right now 16 withdrawals that can go, and you make the withdrawal that's pushed to the El execution layer. The execution layer processes the withdrawals by simply adding the ETH to your balance.
00:37:14.070 - 00:37:23.600, Speaker A: And again, this loop is closed. I don't know how much we want to go into BLS changes or things like that, but at a high level, that's the idea.
00:37:25.810 - 00:37:51.430, Speaker C: Thank you so much, Alex. We are joined by Danny. Danny, you are also the co author of EIP 48 95 and also have coordinated specs changes with respect to the proposal on the consensus layer. I'll be curious to hear from you. What does it mean for withdrawals to be enabled with respect to validators, do we see an inflow of more participants to the network, or is there any threat to the security of the chain?
00:37:58.510 - 00:38:35.026, Speaker B: Danny, we cannot hear you. And just a reminder for everybody, the fork happens in 23 minutes. I want to say, if my math is correct, my math is pretty bad, so it happens at 1027 utc so we are waiting for that and it should happen right on time because this isn't like proof of work where we have to wait for any miners. We know exactly when this fork is going to happen. It is scheduled.
00:38:35.218 - 00:38:40.360, Speaker A: What if the fork block is missed? What happens then? Does it?
00:38:41.610 - 00:38:43.110, Speaker B: Ethereum is canceled.
00:38:43.530 - 00:38:51.194, Speaker A: Got it. We just keep going until one gets. All right.
00:38:51.312 - 00:39:22.962, Speaker C: I think Danny is having some mic issue. While that gets fixed, maybe we can go ahead with the next team. And I see testing team joined us for this call today. This question is for you, Pari and Mario. If any one of you can take maybe with multiple changes, those have worked in parallel for an upgrade, how confident we are with this upgrade going smoothly. If you can maybe take a minute to talk about unique testing techniques. Shadow forking hive to provide us some comfort.
00:39:22.962 - 00:39:25.320, Speaker C: And please do introduce yourself as well.
00:39:29.860 - 00:39:56.340, Speaker A: Paris, you want to go first? No, go ahead. Okay. My name is Maribega, I'm from the ES testing team. So yeah, confidence, definitely. This has been a smoother fork in regards compared to the merge. We know when it's going to be scheduled and all that. It's very much simpler fork.
00:39:56.340 - 00:40:46.756, Speaker A: So in terms of testing the tools that we have used, we have reused a lot of the upgraded tools that we use for the merge. Compared to the merge we had a lot of changes in all the tooling in general because basically we were not as prepared before to do testing in both of the client types. But now we have that after the merge and now this was relatively simple to test. And yeah, definitely the competence we have tested execution clients, consistent clients, the interaction between them, it's been pretty smooth so far. I think for the Shadow forks, that's what Pari is working on, worked on. So I think he can. Yeah, so I can talk about the shadow fox.
00:40:46.756 - 00:41:41.674, Speaker A: They are a bit different since we don't have a change in consensus engine. So we can't use the same shadow fork strategy we had in the past. But instead what we do is we sync up a chain up to head, then we take that block, remove all of its beacon nodes, so we basically stall the chain and then we install a new beacon chain there that then forks off from the main one. So it took a bit of testing in the beginning to get it right, but since then we've had, I think, a bunch of shadow forks on testnets as well as mainnet shadow forks, and they've all been extremely stable this time around. And I don't think we found any major bugs on them even. It was very helpful for tooling, though, so that we could test a lot of the external tooling and make sure things are working. Awesome.
00:41:41.872 - 00:41:46.460, Speaker C: Thank you so much. Quickly checking if Danny's mic is working.
00:41:48.750 - 00:41:49.946, Speaker A: Is it working?
00:41:50.128 - 00:41:51.098, Speaker B: It is.
00:41:51.264 - 00:42:06.586, Speaker A: Hey, cool. Hey, welcome, Danny. Yeah, sorry about that. I think everything on an Ubuntu system works fine for me, except audio. Do you want to ask the question again or should I just pick it up?
00:42:06.628 - 00:42:21.990, Speaker C: Yeah, sure, I can go ahead with that. So we're curious to understand, what does it mean for withdrawals to be enabled? With respect to validators, do we see an inflow of more participants to the network, or is there any threat to the security of the chain?
00:42:23.210 - 00:42:49.550, Speaker A: Right. First and foremost, the addition of withdrawals kind of closes the loop on this system. It actually is a complete staking system. Obviously, with the launch of phase zero, you can go into the beacon chain. The beacon chain didn't do much except secure itself with the merge. Finally, we got the security of the validators. All that capital staked and moved away from proof of work.
00:42:49.550 - 00:43:35.790, Speaker A: And here we finally closed the loop. So validators cannot only, or stakers can not only put up their eth, join the system, secure the system for rewards and or penalties, but they can get out, they can get those rewards, and they can also say, I'm done, and move back into normal user layer. So there's been a lot of speculation as to what that means in terms of staking equilibriums. It's hard to say. It depends on a lot of psychology of whose assets are on the sidelines, what people want to do. I'm sure there's a number of people that have been since phase zero and are like, okay, it's time, I need to pull this capital out and do something else with it. Whereas I'm sure there's also capital that was waiting for this derisking event.
00:43:35.790 - 00:44:21.798, Speaker A: Every subsequent upgrade to the beacon chain and integration fully into mainnet has been like a derisking of this system being complete. And so this is a derisking event for people that want to put their capital in. And so my intuition is maybe more capital shows up rather than leaves, but we shall see. In terms of the security of the system, it's hard for me to imagine this making the system more insecure. Right? Like, a lot of people had to take a leap of faith to put up capital to secure the system. I think this, by completing the loop, we kind of at least maintain the same security, if not increase the security. But yeah, other than that, it's going to be interesting to see how quickly people change their withdrawal credentials.
00:44:21.798 - 00:44:46.914, Speaker A: It's going to be interesting to see the ratio of people that opt in for partial withdrawals versus people that exit and then also watching any capital inflows. But really it's a relatively, as other people said, it's a relatively simple upgrade, especially compared to the merge. I think things are going to go really well and it's just that kind of like final feature that really makes this whole proof of stake system complete. Awesome.
00:44:47.032 - 00:45:09.786, Speaker C: Thank you so much. I think with all this conversation. Thank you all eap authors and the testing team, Danny providing this insight, I am sure that this will give us a lot of confidence to people. Moving on to the next item here we are also joined by Vitalik. I'm sure people are eager to hear from him. So am I. So here we are.
00:45:09.786 - 00:45:23.370, Speaker C: Vitalik, with a question for you. After the merge, there was a roadmap shared with the merge, the verge, the search and so on, so forth. How does this upgrade shapela fits into the broader picture of the Ethereum roadmap?
00:45:36.950 - 00:46:12.462, Speaker A: Several people have mentioned, Danny's mentioned, others have mentioned now. Right. The chapella upgrade kind of closes the loop on some things that are part of the proof of stake transition but did not make it in time for the merge. Withdrawals obviously being really important. The main immediate next focus after this I expect is going to be scaling. Right. So there has been a lot of work on EIP 4844 over the last few months while really continuing for quite a long time now.
00:46:12.462 - 00:46:45.930, Speaker A: But I think a lot of people are interested in getting 4844 in hopefully the next fork and it's in okay. Right. Yeah. It's still a question of what the timing of the next fork is going to be, but I think developments moving forward quickly and people are optimistic. So that's good. Right. So what that's going to do is that will set the stage for the scaling operates that are going to come in the future.
00:46:45.930 - 00:47:21.238, Speaker A: Right. We have things like dank shorting and then we have things like roll ups. And roll ups have made a huge amount of progress this year. Right. We saw polygon, so we saw Polygon doing their Zke EVM release, which is a very significant transition. And we have arbitram not far behind. Optimism not far behind.
00:47:21.238 - 00:48:02.894, Speaker A: Scroll Kakarot. Just lots of L2 projects are starting to make very quick progress toward actually having running proof systems, which has been my big goal for the roll up ecosystem for 2023. Right. So if we have that and at the same time we have 4844, then that really puts the scaling side of ethereum on a really good path. Right. And once 4844 is in, the nice thing is that most of the rest of the stuff that needs to come after that for scaling does not even really require hard forks. We do need forks to just increase the parameters, like increase the number of blobs.
00:48:02.894 - 00:48:58.520, Speaker A: But aside from that data availability sampling, that is not even really a hard fork. That's a fork choice. Rule change. Almost obviously roll ups can keep improving on their own roll up data compression is a technology I've been a big fan of, and for people who have seen my diagrams, it can reduce the amount of data, which is the primary bottleneck of a roll up needed for roll ups to have a transaction by ten x. So it's a component of giving us another ten x scaling for a lot of applications. So a lot of scaling stuff, there's still this kind of big work crunch that is continuing to happen and will need to happen until roughly the end of this year. A bit before that, in the case of some roll ups, maybe a bit after that, but we'll see.
00:48:58.520 - 00:49:39.022, Speaker A: But then after that, I think it gets smoother, right. And I think actually in some ways we're in a fairly good place. Right. I think after this fork is done and then after scaling is done, we're in a stage where the hardest and kind of fastest parts of the Ethereum protocols transition are basically over and very significant things still need to be done. But those very significant things can be safely done at a slower pace. Right. If we don't fix scaling before the next bull run, people are going to be stuck paying $500 transactions.
00:49:39.022 - 00:50:47.880, Speaker A: If on the other hand, we don't have vertical trees before the next bull run, well, things might suck, but it's a much smaller problem than $500 transactions. Right? So it's a good time for to kind of start the transition toward Ethereum being a system that kind of values being slow and reliable more and caring about speed a little bit less. Right? I think up until here there's a strong argument to really value speed and even view speed as being a thing that's important on the same level as safety. Because ultimately every day before the merge is a day that tens of millions of dollars are lost to proof of work expenditure and every day before scaling is a day that potentially people would lose millions of dollars to overly high transaction fees. Right? But after those things, that calculus changes. And I think a kind of more safety oriented approach over time is something that just kind of becomes prudent. But at the same time.
00:50:47.880 - 00:51:42.118, Speaker A: The nice thing about a lot of these upgrades, right, is like vertical trees. It's a really wonderful team continuing to slowly work on it, but it can be done in parallel from the rest of the work. Account abstraction ERC four three seven done totally outside the consensus layer. I do think that the ERC four three seven team and the account abstraction community is becoming more and more convinced that eventually we will need eips, we will need protocol layer changes to, for example, help existing users transition their accounts to account abstraction wallets to make sure account abstracted operations benefit from some of the censorship resistance properties of things like PBS that are coming in. And just to kind of make that whole thing more stable and more efficient in general. And then there's also Eof. So there's a lot of these things that they are happening and they are important.
00:51:42.118 - 00:52:28.258, Speaker A: But the good news is that they are kind of fairly separate efforts, I think to a greater extent than some of the really deep stuff that something like a change to proof of stake changes. So those things are all happening, right. Another one is ZK starking the EVM, the R and D for that basically started multiple years ago, right. And having Zkavms on L2 is like in some ways 75% of the way they are to having Zkavms on layer one. Right. The main thing that's needed to get to layer one is basically for them to be proven robust enough for us to start okay, trusting layer one with it. And the other nice thing is that that transition can also happen gradually.
00:52:28.258 - 00:53:06.370, Speaker A: You can have a few clients switch over to using a ZKVM to verify layer one blocks over time. So all of those other things will happen. But from this point forward I expect it's more of this thing of a lot of different teams working separately. A lot of work happening off chain and then kind of on chain over time and we get these kind of easier transitions. In most cases. Vertical proofs are probably the biggest exception to that. The vertical proof transition actually is going to be pretty technically intricate and complicated in a lot of ways.
00:53:06.370 - 00:53:50.660, Speaker A: But all of the other things I do expect to be simpler, right? So yeah, I guess to summarize them, like my answer, the period of time between probably between the launch of the beacon chain and the full rollout of EIP 4844 and all of the different kind of different components of that is like the peak of rapid change. And pretty soon we're going to start seeing kind of the end of the peak of rapid change. And I think that's exciting in its own way.
00:53:52.950 - 00:54:03.830, Speaker C: Awesome. That's pretty good. Summary for future roadmap for ethereum thank you Vitalik for sharing your views. I suppose we have some question here. Sam.
00:54:05.530 - 00:55:19.390, Speaker A: Oh, I was just going to say we have a little bit of extra time, Vitalik or others, if you'd like to share anything else while I have the mic, we have just a couple of minutes to fill before the upgrade and then we'll be switching over to some monitoring screens. Lucas hello Lucas from none of my team. I agree with Talik that we don't have to rush things after 4844 and solving scaling a bit. But the vibe I'm getting from all the color developers and all the things that's going on, that we have such good velocity coming out of the merge and there are more and more people working on the protocol and working actually in parallel streams. Like for example account abstraction four, eight, four vertical trees. Eof all the things here that my feeling is actually different. Actually, I feel that Ethereum and roll ups, for example, right? All the different roll ups that are still in the Ethereum ecosystem.
00:55:19.390 - 00:56:37.510, Speaker A: My feelings are different that while we don't have to rush anything, that the pace will actually get better and better in terms of what we can deliver just because the share brain power is increasing and going into parallel streams, and thankfully because of that we can deliver big things with a fairly pace that is stable pace. So I just wanted to add this as a comment, and I'm here like four years for four years in Ethereum core development, and I haven't seen this kind of pace and this kind of parallelism in terms of how the work is being done. Yeah, no, I think that's a very valuable point, though I think at the same time, those are not necessarily incompatible perspectives. Right. Because there are things that can be worked on that don't involve risky stuff like breaking changes to the protocol as well. Right. There's client improvements like EIP four four four for making it so the clients don't have to store the full history if they don't have to.
00:56:37.510 - 00:57:33.100, Speaker A: Just refactoring code bases, fixing technical debt, all the stuff that core devs have wanted to do for a long time, but have been kind of prevented by a fast pace of development. Also important things to be working on. Also kind of like a bit higher than layer one stuff like light clients are a big one. There's also a network level, privacy, peer to peer level stuff. I guess my hope is that we can try to also, I think it's good that we have all this energy and I definitely don't want to waste it, but we can also try to, and I expect that we will end up channeling more and more of it to things that are kind of a little bit higher than the base protocol layer over time. I don't know, I was going to say L2, but kind of L2 is a bit of a loaded term because that also basically refers to roll ups. But I also mean.
00:57:33.100 - 00:58:15.800, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And like light client technology, I want every Ethereum wallet five years from now to be actually like, I want every Ethereum wallet two years from now to be actually verifying the chain and not just be dependent on a central infrastructure provider telling it what the hashes are five years from now. It should just be like verifying ethereum and layer one. I kind of feel like five years is not even too ambitious for that. Right. And there's a lot of other stuff improving the peer to peer layer. There's just a lot that probably still needs to be done there.
00:58:15.800 - 00:58:22.140, Speaker A: There's definitely a huge number of things that I think can be done and would be great to do.
00:58:23.870 - 00:58:34.746, Speaker B: Thank you, guys. That was all really good color, really good context for what's going on. Fizz, do you want to talk real quick about some network health stuff?
00:58:34.928 - 00:59:37.620, Speaker A: Yeah, so I have Covid, and I've been saving my voice up all day for this, my first time with COVID and I'm going to go for it. It's going to fail. So what you're hearing from, you've heard a lot from developers today telling about the significance of the chapella upgrade. And the way I view the Ethereum ecosystem is developers develop code that the community needs to run in a way that decentralizes and hardens the network. And so regardless of how well developers develop code, if the community doesn't take that code and run it all over the world in every way it can possibly be run, then Ethereum fails. It falls under capture, it falls under abuse, and over time, they can code around a lot of those things and they can improve things for things like Mev boost. Right now, Mev is kind of a complicated issue that Ethereum is struggling with, but there are plans to develop around it.
00:59:37.620 - 01:00:05.002, Speaker A: What I want to talk about is the need for the community to stake in the most decentralized way that you can. Many people think of staking as a way for them to profit. Like I'm staking, I want to make money. And there is a financial incentive you should be incentivized to stake. But the important thing that you can do is stake in the most decentralized way possible. If you can stake from home. Yes, sir.
01:00:05.002 - 01:00:13.578, Speaker A: Ma'am, I'm going to interrupt you. No, that's fine. Stake from home. Yeah, that's fine.
01:00:13.744 - 01:00:18.574, Speaker B: So we have Remy putting on dashboards here. Remy, do you want to talk about what these dashboards are?
01:00:18.772 - 01:00:59.994, Speaker A: Sure. As usual, with every fork, we'll be looking at a few different metrics to figure out if everything's going well. We're looking for a high participation rate. We're looking for a finalized chain, but we will also be looking at the new features introduced with the capella and Shengai forks. We'll be looking at withdrawals being processed. We'll be looking at BLS changes, people adding withdrawal address on their validator being processed as well. On this screen here, you can see some of the client logs on the left side.
01:00:59.994 - 01:01:16.690, Speaker A: And you can see the slot vis chart from beacon chain up here, and a forky tool down here where you can see if the chain forks or if there's any orphan blocks there.
01:01:16.840 - 01:01:21.138, Speaker B: Are we going to see any ascii art in the left hand command line?
01:01:21.304 - 01:01:24.500, Speaker A: That's a good question. Maybe it'll be a surprise for everyone.
01:01:25.190 - 01:01:31.142, Speaker B: Okay, and tell us about this slot fizz. What's it going to look like when the fork happens?
01:01:31.276 - 01:02:24.200, Speaker A: So the fork is actually happening right now. It's starting at epoch 1948, and it should happen in the next few seconds or a minute. And we'll be looking at a proposed block on the slot vis chart here. When you see like a green block, it means like a block was successfully proposed. And when you see like a red block, it means it was missed by the validator. But more interestingly, we'll be looking at the actual participation rate we expect like high participation rate if the community manage to update their client in time.
01:02:24.810 - 01:02:35.930, Speaker B: So for the last fork that we saw, Gurley, this is where justification and finalization dropped, right? This is the percentage that dropped.
01:02:36.270 - 01:02:36.922, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:02:37.056 - 01:02:40.090, Speaker B: And so we don't expect to see the same thing for Mainnet.
01:02:40.830 - 01:02:52.574, Speaker A: On Mainnet, we expect most service provider to be very on point because there's a lot of incentive for people to have this work properly. Great.
01:02:52.612 - 01:02:55.562, Speaker B: And what's the bottom right thing that we're looking at? The circle.
01:02:55.626 - 01:03:02.180, Speaker A: So this is just a simple fork tool to see if the chain is forking or not.
01:03:06.030 - 01:03:10.060, Speaker B: Great. Anybody else want to chime in for what they're looking for right now?
01:03:14.520 - 01:03:55.270, Speaker A: For me, I was looking for the gossip to start for the BLS operation changes. And they've started quite suddenly there's about 40,000 of them coming through, so that's a good sign. Other than that, looking at blocks published versus empty blocks, much in the same way as we're looking on the dashboard, we can already see some withdrawals being processed and BLS address changes being added to blocks. Right now, my first me that it doesn't have bandwidth to send the BLS withdrawals. I got a huge spam when the fork happened. Yeah. To upgrade to ten gigabit at home.
01:03:55.270 - 01:04:30.640, Speaker A: That was expected. The BLS like the span, so that was kind of within expected bounds. And if your validator at home doesn't get them, it's not a huge issue. You just need enough to include in blocks, or even if you didn't include them, it's not the end of the world. So I think that's all good at this point. This doesn't have any penalties like attestations, not including BLS signatures, right? That's correct. Just the same as voluntary exits.
01:04:30.640 - 01:04:55.450, Speaker A: If you happen to not see them and don't include them in your block, you don't get rewards, you don't miss out on rewards or anything. It's just kind of optional space that's not incentivized. All right, thanks. So it seems locked here, but it should eventually get better.
01:04:59.100 - 01:05:20.290, Speaker B: So, Remy, we can look at the beacon chain. Do you want to pull up the beacon chain withdrawal page real quick? Maybe on top of your logs? Because we can see that some validators have already processed withdrawals. We have 62. So why is it 62 right now? That seems like.
01:05:21.620 - 01:05:22.192, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
01:05:22.246 - 01:05:22.850, Speaker B: Okay.
01:05:23.300 - 01:05:39.540, Speaker A: There can only be 16 withdrawals per slot. So every block can have 16 withdrawals included. And so as blocks are being added to the chain, we can have even more withdrawals being processed on the beacon chain.
01:05:39.880 - 01:05:44.500, Speaker B: So if it's 62, does that mean a lot of these are skimming partial withdrawals?
01:05:45.500 - 01:06:12.160, Speaker A: So they can be either skimming or they can be fully exited. But we have not seen a huge influx of validator doing their voluntary exit on the beacon chain. So most of these are probably skimming, as in they will keep their initial deposit, but they will just extract and withdraw the additional rewards that they've been obtaining.
01:06:12.980 - 01:06:16.930, Speaker B: But that makes sense, right? Some of the skimming rewards would be in the queue first?
01:06:18.020 - 01:06:45.876, Speaker A: Yes. And there's big gaps at the start of the queue. Sorry. There's big gaps in BLS withdrawals at the start. So we will have skipped over a few blocks, probably, and not put many withdrawals in there. We don't always take a break to stop and look at the big picture and see that the upgrade worked. The network is continuing to run the BLS.
01:06:45.876 - 01:07:20.464, Speaker A: Signature changes were processed. We are proposing blocks. So we do have missed slots and those are likely people who haven't upgraded as we kind of predicted before. What I'm going to guess those are are people who are having problems with Mevboost. People are used to upgrading their clients, but Mevboost required an upgrade that I think some people or some validators may have missed. But the overall big picture is the upgrade worked. We're moving smoothly.
01:07:20.464 - 01:07:22.070, Speaker A: So congratulations everyone.
01:07:25.230 - 01:07:30.960, Speaker B: Congratulations largely to these client teams and the protocol devs that have been working really hard on this.
01:07:36.360 - 01:08:13.880, Speaker A: This epoch will finalize, right? It has enough to finalize, doesn't it? Yeah, we justified the epoch, we have enough to justify the epoch and then we'll file it next time, likely if things continue. So if I look at one of the recent block that was included here, we should see a few withdrawals added, a few BLS changes added to. So these features seems to be working. We will have to wait a few minutes longer to have these epoch finalized.
01:08:16.780 - 01:08:30.664, Speaker B: This might be a good time. Ben Chodroff do you want to maybe talk a little bit about what the CLWP was and what you expect to see for those broadcasts?
01:08:30.792 - 01:09:15.252, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Consensus layer withdrawal protection is EIP 4736. We created this as an optional way for Ethereum validators to request the community to help them broadcast the BLS to execution change, so setting their withdrawal address. So we had 2133 validators participate in this. And what we're watching all now is did the people that we're helping protect get their withdrawal address that they requested? We had even some of us racing against ourselves, which is a kind of an interesting scenario. So we're using beacon tool to kind of help here watch as all these different validators are going to get set over the next few hours days, however long it takes. So we're quite excited.
01:09:15.252 - 01:09:51.700, Speaker A: I do want to thank everybody. We're really humbled by the amount of support we got, especially Jim McDonald for helping create EtH do and all the mentoring he gave on the EIP eth staker, Ether, R D etherions, the cat herders, flashpots, Claros, off chain Lido and all nodes also helped broadcast these changes. So we really see a wide amount of support from the Ethereum community to helping everybody make sure that they get their withdrawal address and get the support here. As a quick reminder, we have a seed phrase. Just quick, quick reminder. If you have a seed phrase. Please do not store it online.
01:09:51.700 - 01:10:23.696, Speaker A: Make sure that you get it offline and store it securely. I'm not sure if you've really been thanked for all of the effort that you've put into this. You took this mission and you were like, we are going to save people from losing their assets. And you pushed it so hard and so effectively for the past. It feels like a year. And I'm really appreciative of your efforts and I really hope that you've saved people loss. No one begged you to do this.
01:10:23.696 - 01:10:40.150, Speaker A: You just chose to do it. And it was a great mission and I appreciate your service. I really appreciate it. It's been an interesting to watch this. I sincerely hope that CLWP helps everybody, or at least helps some. But this has been tremendous support from the Ethereum community. I can't thank everybody enough for the help.
01:10:40.150 - 01:10:42.280, Speaker A: Awesome.
01:10:42.350 - 01:10:44.090, Speaker B: York, did you have something to say?
01:10:45.180 - 01:11:22.240, Speaker A: Yeah, I just wanted to kind of do if you so will psa about since we're talking about not losing your eth, about how careful you want to be with this mnemonic. If you have the old withdrawal credentials, you'll have to change them. That requires a tool. If anybody slides into your dms, they want to scam you. Only discuss this in public channels, never private. Don't share your mnemonic with anyone, not even a portion of it. And do do this on a completely separate air gapped machine in case yours is compromised.
01:11:22.240 - 01:11:23.990, Speaker A: That's what I wanted to say.
01:11:26.120 - 01:11:43.320, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes sense. And now that withdrawals are live, if you're nervous about it in any way, you can exit your validator and go right back in. That is a safe way to make sure that your seed phrase hasn't been taken in any way you can exit. Create a new validator.
01:11:45.040 - 01:11:48.988, Speaker A: And all you lose is your index. Who wants to lose their index though, right?
01:11:49.154 - 01:12:19.124, Speaker B: That's actually a concern of mine. Just a note for anybody who is staking with services. So today, the Shanghai fork enabled withdrawals for anyone who's solo staking. So if there's no layer between you and the beacon chain, you can now withdraw. It's open to do. But if you are staking with a service, that service has to implement support for this upgrade. And so I have a couple of dates on here.
01:12:19.124 - 01:12:59.700, Speaker B: If you're staking with Coinbase, you should be able to do this within the next 24 hours. Kraken, I know, has already started their exits. You should be able to withdraw your eth in the next 24 hours. Rocket pool has their atlas upgrade going live in about a week on April 18, and that's when they'll enable withdrawals and Lido sometime next month. But both of those services give you liquid staking tokens. Finance should be by April 19, so within a week. So if you are staking with any provider that's outside of that, check with them to see when you can withdraw.
01:12:59.700 - 01:13:14.360, Speaker B: All right, anybody else want to talk about whatever, anything that they're seeing withdrawals right now?
01:13:15.710 - 01:13:18.090, Speaker A: Should we celebrate with the songs?
01:13:20.430 - 01:13:21.750, Speaker B: Yeah, Jonathan?
01:13:21.910 - 01:13:39.680, Speaker A: Yeah, we can do that. Can everybody hear me? Everybody hear that? Loud and clear. Yeah, you're just a little loud. Jonathan, is the guitar too loud? My voice too loud? Or both? Maybe guitar slightly too loud. How's that?
01:13:40.050 - 01:13:40.800, Speaker B: Perfect.
01:13:41.170 - 01:14:13.610, Speaker A: Better? Okay, great. Let me just set everything up. Hi, everyone. In case you don't know who I am, my name is Jonathan Mann. I write a song a day. I've been doing that for the last 5200 some odd days. And it's my solemn duty to celebrate every successful eth upgrade with a song written by you, the crazy djens, on YouTube.
01:14:13.610 - 01:14:39.090, Speaker A: So if you are there on YouTube, I'm going to put your words and things that you're putting in there into this song. Here we go. Oh, boy. This is always challenging. No one cares. Torture.
01:14:40.470 - 01:14:41.220, Speaker B: Stop.
01:14:41.590 - 01:14:53.030, Speaker A: No song. Let's go, my man. Cringe. Get this guy out. Oh, there's Dom. Dom's helping me out. Thank you, Dom.
01:14:53.030 - 01:15:24.660, Speaker A: We are all Chappella. We are all Chappella. Free Vitalik rocket pool. Good luck, nuket. Stop please. Dave Chappella rocket pool everybody go now to the moon. Chappella ah.
01:15:24.660 - 01:16:16.408, Speaker A: Chappella ah, my lady, oh my lady. If you're gonna stay, you gotta stake so low if you're gonna hoot you hoot so loud so Vitala can hear you. So Vitala can hear you. Coinbase shout out fork, fork, fork me lady maker. Chappella. Yeah, melady maker. Oh, feed Vitalik.
01:16:16.408 - 01:17:03.470, Speaker A: I love my ether wallet. Metallic is the best mistress. Boom. A lady FTX will rise again. Chappella. We got Chappella. Oh, now you can take your money out and all the doubters can go to hell because they said it wasn't possible.
01:17:03.470 - 01:17:52.588, Speaker A: But we knew it was. Yeah, we knew it was. Yeah we knew it was. Yeah we knew, we knew. Chappella o Chappella poo rocket pool poap po app. Give me the poet, I really want the poap. I take my money out, I put my money in, I take my money out, I put my money in it goes both ways.
01:17:52.588 - 01:18:58.450, Speaker A: I take my money out it goes both ways. I put my money in because of Chappella. Because of Chappella. And next time we'll be focused on scaling and next time we're going where no blockchain has gone before into a great big new horizon. Oh, the first we did Chappella. Fuck you, Liz Warren, Gary Gensler, also staking is now totally derisked. And that's good.
01:18:58.450 - 01:19:47.090, Speaker A: And this is where it all begins. This is where it all begins. You were there at the beginning you were there at the beginning of Chappella, of Chappella, of Chappella. Man. I think we have to stop using YouTube because these people are not.
01:19:48.260 - 01:19:52.048, Speaker B: I don't know how you're even reading that fast. It's going so quickly.
01:19:52.214 - 01:20:12.310, Speaker A: You have to have a separate chat. That is less than 2600 people. Thank you, everyone. Congratulations to all the devs. This is once again just absolutely incredible. I continue to be in awe and thank you so much for having me. I love you all.
01:20:12.920 - 01:20:14.070, Speaker C: Thank you, John.
01:20:15.820 - 01:20:39.088, Speaker A: I want to say that the lyrics there were created by random people on YouTube. They do not reflect in many cases, the views of Ethereum. Each staker going so fast I can't even process what I'm saying. So then I'm like, then I'm saying things like, FTX is coming back. I'm like, why did I just say that? You're just a conduit. That's all we understand. We love it.
01:20:39.088 - 01:21:06.728, Speaker A: You were a great performance. I just want to make sure that it's clear that those are not necessarily our values. So thank you very much. Do not reflect those of eth cat herders or anyone else on this call. Thank you very much. We are always welcoming first and knowledgeable second, and that means we welcome everyone to our community, regardless of your political status or who you are or what you've done. We welcome everyone.
01:21:06.728 - 01:21:08.330, Speaker A: So yeah, thanks again.
01:21:09.020 - 01:22:08.760, Speaker B: Just a couple of things we are going to cover also something that we call the great reshuffling. And then we're going to go over KZG and 4844, which is an upgrade that we're looking forward to. And then we'll do poap stuff and poap canvas stuff real quick. The great reshuffling, if you have your east staked somewhere right now that you staked it and didn't really think about it, didn't really know what the place that you staked it meant for network health, please go move it to, please do your research and move it to a more decentralized service. If you staked it on a centralized service, move it to a decentralized service. If you staked it on a decentralized service and have made up the number of ETH that you need to run your own validator, whether that's a mini pool or running a full solo staking validator, please do your research, move it. And by doing that you're also derisking yourself because centralized staking is the riskiest way to stake because you are not in custody.
01:22:08.760 - 01:22:20.640, Speaker B: Well, if it's custodial staking, you don't have custody of that and you want to be able to have custody of your own eth. Does anybody else want to say anything about the importance of moving your eth now that withdrawals are enabled?
01:22:22.180 - 01:22:53.980, Speaker A: I've been listening to Anthony Cisano, the daily Guay for months now, and he really has been talking about this idea of the great reshuffling, just like Nick spoke about. I encourage you listen to his podcast. He really gives common sense insights into why it's so important for us to do this work. He gives the message that Ethereum is stronger when it's decentralized and only the community can do that. Developers cannot decentralize the network. It is our role and we have to take it seriously.
01:22:54.720 - 01:23:36.170, Speaker B: And East Acre has a whole community standing by if you want to run a validator, but you are intimidated on doing the setup. It is so easy with the help that like the whole community, it's a community of thousands of people who will step in and say, I want to help you don't ever accept dms, but in public, in public channels, in the discord, in the subreddit, people will help you set up these validators and that's how you're going to get the best yields. That's how you're going to get the safest yields. Next, we're going to move on to Trent. Trent has been in charge of something called the KZG ceremony, and he's going to explain how that went and where it's going now.
01:23:37.500 - 01:24:30.440, Speaker A: Sure, with the upgrade complete successfully, it seems like it went well. We're looking to the future and a big part of that is EIP 4844, which is front of mind for a lot of people. And an important prerequisite for that to actually go live is something called the KZG ceremony. If you haven't heard of it, I'll give a quick just overview of what it is. So these are sometimes called trusted setups, but it's a massive multiparty computation that so far has involved a ton of people from the Ethereum community. We've been working on it, specifically the people who are coordinating the project and actually doing the development for about a year now, since May of last year, working through the initial spec, getting audits, working on different implementations. And then in January of this year, we actually launched the ceremony itself.
01:24:30.440 - 01:25:22.152, Speaker A: So anybody could go to ceremony ethereum.org and contribute a bit of entropy, and this is computed over and then passed between different participants. And we were incredibly floored to get so far over 86,000 contributions. We were hoping for ten k, 10,000 contributions would have been incredible for us. And through the commitments of the Ethereum community and the broader crypto excitement, we managed to get 86,000, which is just incredible, which makes it the largest ceremony of this kind by an order of magnitude. So, yeah, massive thank you to everybody who's been involved with doing any of the technical work, helping to coordinate, sending it around to people to get them to engage with it. And yeah, it's been a great experience.
01:25:22.152 - 01:26:24.424, Speaker A: And so currently we are in this open contribution period, just closed in mid March, and we're currently in the special contribution period. So you may have seen some tweets about people doing theater performances or making an album in one day. And so we have these special contributions that are running for these two weeks now where somebody needs a little bit of extra time or some special accommodations. We also had somebody contribute from a satellite in space things that require a little bit of extra accommodation. So that'll be going on for another week or so, and then we will stay tuned for what happens next. We're still deciding whether it's going to open up back into an open contribution period where anybody can contribute, or we do a few more rounds of these special periods where we allocate slots. So, yeah, the output from this ceremony will be a string of random letters and numbers that will go into a key component of the four mechanism.
01:26:24.424 - 01:27:10.376, Speaker A: So it's important that this is done in a decentralized and trustless way so anybody can prove the output of the ceremony once it's done. And we'll have a public process for verifying and validating that if you did contribute to the ceremony, you can actually verify that you were included. Your entropy or your randomness, whatever you entered, is actually in the ceremony. So that'll happen in a couple of months, sometime between now and whenever four at four goes live. So, yeah, just a huge thank you to anybody who's been involved, either from the development side or actually contributed randomness. And if you don't happen to contribute, that's totally fine. The ceremony only requires a single honest participant.
01:27:10.376 - 01:27:33.620, Speaker A: So if, for whatever reason, you missed this open contribution window or aren't able to contribute in the future, rest assured, you just have to make sure that one of the 86,000 other contributions have destroyed their random entropy contribution, and it will be a secure contribution to the Ethereum protocol. Yeah, thank you for the time to explain that. Awesome.
01:27:33.690 - 01:27:54.280, Speaker B: Thank you so much, Trent. So the last network upgrade, the last big network upgrade was the merge. That was in September of last year. Now we've just passed Shanghai. The next one that's coming up, which the KZG ceremony was for, is 4844. Terrence, do you want to talk a little bit about what 4844 is and why it's important for the network?
01:27:54.780 - 01:28:19.772, Speaker A: Sure. Hey, guys, so thanks for having me, and congrats again on the successful fork. So, TLDR, what is 44 four? Right? So 44 four. Layer two scales ethereum, and L2 uses code data. And code data is expensive. Why is it expensive? Because code data are stored on the node forever, and the EVM can access the core data.
01:28:19.846 - 01:28:20.180, Speaker B: Right.
01:28:20.250 - 01:28:45.192, Speaker A: But L2 doesn't really need this type of future. Layer two doesn't need the data forever. Layer two just needs the data for the challenge period. And L2 doesn't need the EVM to access the data. Layer two just needs to know the data is there, and it's out there. Right? So EIP 44 essentially opens this two dimensional market. So we have this EVM gas.
01:28:45.192 - 01:29:19.716, Speaker A: Now we have this data gas. So data gas, by having this data gas, enables cheaper data to post data operation. So instead of code data, we will have blob data. So what's so special about blob data is that it's only stored for 18 days, and EVM cannot access the data. EVM can access the data. It's there. So it's kind of like, I would say like a mini hack before we go into this full dang sharding and stuff, when we can scale forever and infinity.
01:29:19.716 - 01:30:12.504, Speaker A: So this kind of gives us the scalability that we need for the short to medium term. So, in terms of client update, what's most interesting about 44 is that we have been working in the background as early as last February, just because it was an initiative from photo lambda, from optimism, and since then, plans have been iterating on it. But with that said, it's not something that we're 100% focused on. Since then, we have been treated more like a side project. We spend as much resource as we can possible. But needless to say that we have been working that in the background and in terms of the latest progress is that the SPAC I think is getting close to finalized. We had this is a big paradigm shift when we moved from coupled block and blob to decoupled blob and blob and stuff.
01:30:12.504 - 01:30:55.030, Speaker A: We're seeing big networking improvement with this new paradigm and clients are working towards like an interrupt devnet between multiple clients. So that's very exciting. That's something to watch in the next two, three weeks. On the research side, we're trying to figure out what's the right parameters for data gas. So we know something like EIP 1559 style when you have exponential increase and decrease. This is something that we'll probably want to finalize soon. How should the blob data be charged? If you're L2 teams, you're watching this, now is a good time to look into this and give us feedback because you guys are the main consumers, so it's important to get the feedback from you guys.
01:30:55.030 - 01:31:08.570, Speaker A: I'm just one of the core dad that's working on this. That's probably like 50 people other working on it. So shout out to everyone that has been working on this for a while. And yeah, thank you for giving me the stage. Yeah, of course.
01:31:08.940 - 01:31:18.088, Speaker B: Next we're going to pass it off to Patricia Wartolter, who is the founder of the poet protocol.
01:31:18.264 - 01:31:59.512, Speaker A: Hello everyone. Congratulations on such a smooth transition into the future. We are trying out something new for minting this poap. The idea of minting a precious digital collectible for thousands of people, easily, securely, and sustainably, it's pretty hard. It's a challenge that we've been trying to tackle for years now, and we still haven't nailed it. So we are doing something different today. For minting the pop of this event, you have to go into Chappella info and you will be offered to buy the pop up, which is a pretty nice one done by the htaker team.
01:31:59.512 - 01:32:41.080, Speaker A: This pop is being sold for $3. You don't need to rush. It's going to be available for sale for 24 hours. So if you are watching this on a different time zone on the recording, or you just want to move on with your life, you can do so. Ideally, you don't even try it now, because now there's going to be thousands of farmers of all sorts hitting the front end. So if anytime in the next 24 hours you visit Chappella info, you will get that pretty nice pop up. If you are in Japan, and I know some of you are, you can find me around at Global Tokyo, and we may have a good time.
01:32:41.080 - 01:33:14.688, Speaker A: And again, thank you, everyone, for having such a massive leap ahead into decentralized coordination. I want to say Patricio has been a great supporter of Eastaker since the beginning. Poap is one of the tools that we use to reach the success we have now. And I'm just so wildly appreciative of his long standing support for decentralizing Ethereum and making it the most robust network he can. So thank you, Patricia, of course.
01:33:14.774 - 01:33:26.550, Speaker B: Thank you so much. And also, that's Chappella info. So for the po app, you're going to go to Chappella info. That's S-H-A-P-E-L-L-A-I-N-F-O.
01:33:27.960 - 01:33:33.130, Speaker A: I'm going to do what I said you shouldn't do, which is trying to buy it right away.
01:33:35.980 - 01:33:43.690, Speaker B: So go ahead and go buy that power. Also, does anybody logic. Do you want to talk about the canvas at all?
01:33:44.220 - 01:34:04.524, Speaker A: You know that I do. And yeah, I just want to mention how cool it is that we got the withdrawal on this canvas, thanks to bankless and evm, who really made that happen. I know Evm. They're crazy about the withdrawals. Hodlercon big shout out to you guys. Racket pool. I mean, I'm sorry, it's rocket pool.
01:34:04.524 - 01:34:21.000, Speaker A: They're always on the canvases, but that logo looks beautiful. Whack, whack. Prime real estate right there in the top center. Evms ev mavericks, you guys are in there. Guild XYz Pool together ethereum.org ens there's so many names. Bankless.
01:34:21.000 - 01:34:31.720, Speaker A: I think superfizz is down there. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that happened. Glad to see you. Poap. I see the absolute beautiful poap logo.
01:34:31.720 - 01:34:46.704, Speaker A: It was crazy. All of this. So much coordination happened right in the last few seconds here. So it was a lot of fun. Yeah. I don't know if I can say much more. I'll announce something about this canvas a little bit later on.
01:34:46.704 - 01:34:59.116, Speaker A: But it was absolutely just so much fun. Thank you for everyone who took part. It's beautiful. The centerpiece kind of made it there. It's great logic.
01:34:59.148 - 01:35:17.124, Speaker B: Thank you so much for coordinating this. We know that these are a lot of work making sure that these communities all come and protect their space and stay engaged so that nobody messes up their art. It's really good of you to put this together. They make wonderful memorabilia for these forks.
01:35:17.252 - 01:35:41.744, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And just a reminder that anyone that wants to, you can actually mint any particular part of this canvas that shows the creation of your particular area of art as an NFT. So that is an option at this point. Now that the canvas has ended, there should be. Yeah, it says create lapse if you scroll down below the canvas. So it's a really cool feature that was added, I think just right before the merge. So yeah.
01:35:41.744 - 01:35:46.720, Speaker A: Thanks everybody for coming out. It was wild and a lot of fun. Cool.
01:35:46.790 - 01:36:09.210, Speaker B: So before we close out, does anybody want to say anything about how withdrawals are going? I'm seeing 2113 withdrawals processed 6000 e. All the clients look okay. No issues from any of the client teams. I'm seeing a lot of thumbs up over here. Awesome. Very good to see.
01:36:11.420 - 01:36:11.880, Speaker A: Cool.
01:36:11.950 - 01:36:21.230, Speaker B: Well, thank you guys, everybody for coming. Thank you for watching. Thank you for participating. We really appreciate the color, the context, the work that you guys have put in.
01:36:22.080 - 01:36:37.220, Speaker A: And hey, I want to say this is the first time that Nix has hosted a major east acre call and you did a fantastic job, wonderful job. And thank you for everyone. Ow.
01:36:37.720 - 01:36:38.836, Speaker B: Bye, everybody.
01:36:39.018 - 01:36:42.560, Speaker A: And congratulations to developers. You all did it. Bye.
