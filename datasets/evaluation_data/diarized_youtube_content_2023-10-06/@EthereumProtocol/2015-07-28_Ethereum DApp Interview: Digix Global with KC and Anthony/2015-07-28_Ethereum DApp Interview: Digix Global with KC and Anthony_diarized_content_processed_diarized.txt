00:00:16.330 - 00:00:45.814, Speaker A: Hello and welcome to another Ethereum DAP interview with key members of the organization and the community. This is a chance to meet some of the incredible people that are working behind the scenes, either directly with the Ethereum project or people who are looking to build applications that are leveraging the Ethereum technological stack. Today I'll be speaking with some of the co founders of Digix Global. We have Casey Chun, CEO. Hi, George. Hello. And we have Anthony Euphemio, CTO.
00:00:45.862 - 00:00:46.598, Speaker B: Hi, George.
00:00:46.694 - 00:01:05.826, Speaker A: Great pleasure to meet you guys. Thank you very much for doing this interview. Digix Global is a DAP development and consultancy house based in Singapore with a core product that aims to tokenize assets and make them fungible on the blockchain. The Ethereum blockchain specifically. That's correct. Right? Yes. Okay.
00:01:05.826 - 00:01:17.250, Speaker A: So yeah, to start off, I have a few questions. Could you elaborate a little on the consultative aspect of Digisclub and the kind of services that you intend to provide moving forward? Sure.
00:01:17.320 - 00:01:56.258, Speaker C: We have a few asset suppliers that are interested to put their assets on the blockchain itself. I think their intention is to increase the pool of liquidity in a decentralized marketplace. For now, anyone with an Internet connection would be able to get on the Ethereum blockchain and purchase these assets, and that's their intention. So one of the more exciting projects that we are consulting on would be carbon credit trading. The current way that carbon credit is being traded is illiquid and really regional. So they have this vision of creating a standardized carbon token to be traded on a decentralized marketplace. And we could think of myriads of use cases for that.
00:01:56.258 - 00:02:02.990, Speaker C: For instance, you could use it to offset certain carbon emissions when you purchase airline tickets on expedia.
00:02:03.150 - 00:02:16.678, Speaker A: Okay. So I guess you could probably even have it where it links to, say, a credit card. And when you make purchases from a credit card, those products have a carbon value and it buys back the carbon vouchers to essentially offset any purchases you make.
00:02:16.764 - 00:02:23.186, Speaker C: Absolutely. So you would get, say, a credit card mileage or you could get a discount in your flight. That's very cool.
00:02:23.228 - 00:02:37.182, Speaker A: That's very cool. So an interesting question that people in the community might be asking is how could you help them? I mean, they might have a really good idea or a business premise, but they might not know how to build that on top of Ethereum's blockchain technology. Would you be able to help them with that?
00:02:37.316 - 00:02:37.710, Speaker B: Yes.
00:02:37.780 - 00:02:46.530, Speaker C: Our proof of asset protocol that we came up with is highly customizable for different users. And Anthony, you could elaborate on it.
00:02:46.600 - 00:03:27.230, Speaker B: Yeah. So over the course of really building out our core offering, we realized that a lot of the pieces, a lot of the smart contracts that we have been building can be abstracted out and be used for other things. Such as we have an identity management system, we have a registry system, we have integrations with decentralized exchange and mandatory access control permissions so you can have more granular controls. We're using the multi SiG technology to assign roles onto the blockchain.
00:03:29.090 - 00:03:38.818, Speaker A: You also have a core product, which is the ability to take assets and tokenize them and have them represented on the blockchain itself. Do you want to elaborate on that a little bit?
00:03:38.904 - 00:04:25.886, Speaker C: Right, so the first listing that we have would be gold bullion. Well, so when users purchase and store gold in our custodial vaults, we're able to issue an ownership claim onto the blockchain itself. It retains the same functionalities as bitcoin, but it doesn't have the same price volatility, because every asset voucher is backed by the asset that you hold in our custodial vaults. And it's not only limited to gold, our service is open to other assets that have and represent a great store of wealth, but suffers from the issue of being able to transport it easily. You're talking about masterpiece paintings, you're talking about antique furniture, you're talking about, say, diamonds or anything of value, and they're all able to be listed on our system.
00:04:25.988 - 00:04:31.940, Speaker A: Okay, how does that work in terms of connecting the blockchain to the real world?
00:04:32.390 - 00:05:35.330, Speaker B: Yes. So part of our service is we're also building a document management system that basically allows us to upload, for example, digital versions of the signed contracts, which are actually hashed. So there's a file hash to that, and it's shared on a decentralized peer to peer network so that people can see that there's actual contracts behind these. There's actual legally accepted contracts that a government or a court would actually honor behind all these decentralized apps. So, for example, for our agreements with our custodial vault partner, you can see that there is an actual contract behind it saying that they are holding the assets on behalf of the customer. For example, the audits that happen on a regular basis on these assets, right? Yes. And these are actually attached.
00:05:35.330 - 00:05:48.202, Speaker B: These documents are then attached to a contract so people can see that there's actual physical contracts, real world contracts to what we're trying to do.
00:05:48.336 - 00:05:58.558, Speaker A: So people can send you gold, you'll audit it, you'll represent it on the blockchain. You'll store it in a vault and then can you then redeem the gold afterwards? Can you then say, send it in the mail to someone?
00:05:58.644 - 00:06:20.614, Speaker B: Yes, absolutely. So we have a process called recasting. So for example, you have a 100 grams bar in a vault and you decide to create 100 digital tokens representing this 100 grams. So you can basically recast five of these vouchers to create a five grand bar.
00:06:20.732 - 00:06:22.070, Speaker A: Wow. Right. Okay.
00:06:22.220 - 00:06:31.830, Speaker B: And the contracts are completely stated and honored in the Singapore legal system.
00:06:31.900 - 00:06:52.494, Speaker A: So that's an interesting point as well. Obviously you guys are based in Singapore and I've been going around Singapore a bit recently and I've had the opportunity to speak to some people in the government, that sort of thing. It seems that they have an incredibly intelligent, but as I said, intelligent set of regulations in terms of crypto. Does that help you?
00:06:52.612 - 00:07:07.960, Speaker C: Absolutely it does. That's one of the main reasons why we chose to set up a company in Singapore, because it's proactive, to blockchain technology. They wish to promote it and see it flourishing, succeed. And I think this is the best place to do great.
00:07:09.050 - 00:07:19.020, Speaker A: So with the core product of the sort of tokenization, could you probably build sort of other, allow other people to build dapps around that? How could their Dapps interface with you?
00:07:19.710 - 00:08:16.410, Speaker B: Exactly. One of the biggest things that we really found to be important in building our services and also one of the biggest value propositions that we can offer our customers looking to digitize these assets is that we want to encourage other DAP builders to really contribute to the ecosystem because I think that these tokens, these assets are only really valuable if there's other Dapps and other users actually taking advantage of these. So we are going to encourage people to build apps and we will expose as much of the API to other DAP developers so that they can utilize, for example, being able to create another dao that holds gold vouchers that equate to a physical asset on a vault somewhere.
00:08:17.150 - 00:08:27.342, Speaker A: So over the past few days we've been doing sort of meetups and workshops. Are you going to continue that? Are you going to sort of help build a community for Ethereum in.
00:08:27.476 - 00:08:52.086, Speaker C: Yes, yes, I think it's great. We really want to strengthen the entire community in Singapore. We can't do it alone. We need people to work together to collaborate and build this community together. And we're intending to set up monthly meetups in Singapore and hopefully we could even host bi weekly webcasting programming courses. And Anthony? Anthony is free to do so.
00:08:52.188 - 00:09:11.130, Speaker B: So we're going to actually do regular hackathons. And really, the idea is, know, in the future, Digix Global wants to play a key role and possibly become an incubator for other DAP developers and encourage people to really strengthen the entire Ethereum ecosystem.
00:09:11.470 - 00:09:23.066, Speaker A: Fantastic. Are you working with any sort of currently existing dapps? I mean, we have, I think, over 120 different entities building on top of the Ethereum stack already. So are you working with any of them?
00:09:23.188 - 00:10:19.106, Speaker B: Yes. So we've been talking to several organizations and companies, two of them being Wayfund and Etherex. So with know Digix global vouchers, gold vouchers, assets, users will be able to actually have the option to automatically list their assets on a decentralized exchange and match it with other assets. For example, a gold voucher can be matched with a us dollar voucher or a silver voucher. And for Wayfund, it was pretty much a no brainer for us to really look at the partnership, because wouldn't be nice to be able to do a crowd sale using a globally accepted store of value such as gold, and make sure that when you fund a campaign, that if the funds need to go back to you, that they still have the same value that you put in to the system.
00:10:19.208 - 00:10:39.574, Speaker A: Exactly. That's very important. So I guess you guys been, I think it's two years you've been working, right, on digital global. So in the beginning, did you always have this sort of laser vision or did you sort of start off with a different idea and kind of through research and sort of working what you wanted to do, come to sort of a new direction. Right.
00:10:39.612 - 00:11:14.114, Speaker C: So we started with a really rudimentary idea, which is to convert bitcoin to gold. We wanted to operate like a traditional bullion dealer, where people could send us cryptocurrency and we would ship out and deliver vertical. But Dan came Ethereum, and he was there at the inception and he convinced me about the power of this platform. And so here we are now spend the last year and a half building out our system on ethereum. We made some mistakes, but along the way we learned so much and it's, in our view, it's beneficial if we shared our knowledge to the community.
00:11:14.312 - 00:11:28.850, Speaker A: Great. So to sort of round up the interview, what's the vision for digital global moving forwards? And also as well, where do you see yourselves in sort of another year and a half, two years time?
00:11:29.020 - 00:11:52.366, Speaker C: So pretty much Digix global is just, I would say it's just a little gear in the entire machine. We would like to see depth and services built around Digix Global as well, and it's what we're working and looking forward to. We need a community of people who are interested in developing software and applications around our system as well.
00:11:52.548 - 00:12:01.490, Speaker A: Okay, great. What about in another two, one and a half years? Where do you think? What's the crypto landscape going to be like then?
00:12:01.640 - 00:12:36.170, Speaker B: It's going to be very exciting. The way I see it is this is really cutting edge technology. A lot of people still do not understand what can be built and can't be built. So I think that we're sort of leading the way, showing people that there's a lot of things that you can do, there's a lot of things that you can disrupt with this technology. And I think we want to lead by example and hopefully there's other people that follow us and hopefully we grow a big ecosystem with a lot a new industry.
00:12:37.410 - 00:13:04.214, Speaker A: Great. Well, thank you very much, guys. I wish you all the best of luck in Singapore. I think it's really great to see Ethereum being sort of understood and leveraged in the eastern world. I think it's a really, really exciting project. I think viewers will agree that Diggs sounds great and they'll be able to start looking at some of your stuff. As I said, it's all open source, right? So anyone can have a look through your code, but yeah.
00:13:04.214 - 00:13:27.260, Speaker A: Thank you very much, everyone, for tuning in. Thank you for your time. Be sure to follow ethereum on YouTube or Twitter if you're not already. We're always bringing out updates. Next time we'll be looking to do some more interviews with some of the brilliant members of the community. So if you're building a Dap, if you have something you want share with us, please do get in contact again through Twitter or any of the other sort of contact mechanisms. We'd love to talk to you, but yeah, thank you very much.
