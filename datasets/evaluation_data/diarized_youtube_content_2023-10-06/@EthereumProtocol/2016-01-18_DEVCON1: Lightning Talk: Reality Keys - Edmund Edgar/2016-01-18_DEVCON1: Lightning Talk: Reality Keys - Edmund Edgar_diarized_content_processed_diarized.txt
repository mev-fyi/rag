00:00:16.490 - 00:00:21.986, Speaker A: Okay, I'm Edmund Edgar. I run reality keys. I'm going to keep this short to leave some room for Thomas, who's going.
00:00:21.988 - 00:00:23.422, Speaker B: To show you something crazy cool.
00:00:23.556 - 00:00:35.878, Speaker A: In the same vein, using PlS notary. So we're an oracle service. We've been running since early 2014. We started off providing keys that you.
00:00:35.884 - 00:00:38.070, Speaker B: Could use to make smart contracts with bitcoin.
00:00:40.010 - 00:00:42.502, Speaker A: So we've been doing that for a while. Obviously, there were a lot of limitations.
00:00:42.566 - 00:00:44.410, Speaker B: Making smart contracts with bitcoin.
00:00:45.070 - 00:01:10.546, Speaker A: So now we've started publishing some data that you can use with Ethereum, which is going to have, as we all know, a lot more possibilities. Our process is very simple. We pull from an API, we publish what we see. If that API was correct, you can just leave that as it is and we'll provide you that data for free. If that information was incorrect, you can just send us a dispute fee and.
00:01:10.568 - 00:01:11.698, Speaker B: We'Ll check it out.
00:01:11.864 - 00:01:29.286, Speaker A: And what that allows us to do is to pull from some fairly unreliable data sources. So we can use data. For example, we use data in the past from freebase or from wikidata, which are things that people can tamper with. But ultimately, if you pay a fee, we can check it out and we.
00:01:29.308 - 00:01:30.700, Speaker B: Can get you to the right answer.
00:01:31.710 - 00:01:38.586, Speaker A: We found with bitcoin, we found people coming up with all kinds of crazy data that they're interested in, that they.
00:01:38.608 - 00:01:40.886, Speaker B: Want to make smart contracts about that we weren't expecting.
00:01:40.998 - 00:01:47.066, Speaker A: We found that people wanted to make smart contracts with their future selves. Say, if I do this run, I'm.
00:01:47.098 - 00:01:48.030, Speaker B: Going to get my money back.
00:01:48.100 - 00:02:15.160, Speaker A: If I fail to do the run, my money is going to charity. We found all kinds of things that people want to do. So if there's some data you need, you need it certified so that you can make a trusted contract based on it, and you don't see it on the site, then just let us know. Right now. What we're doing is we're doing the whole thing off chain. So we sign data, we give you some data and a signature. You can make an Ethereum contract that just checks that signature and then uses the data.
00:02:15.160 - 00:02:46.350, Speaker A: It's not particularly hard for us if people need it to do it, kind of the traditional Ethereum way, traditional way of just publishing a feed to the chain. We can do that as well. So just let us know. So that's realitykeys.com. I know you'll be hearing from Thomas next, who also runs an oracle service. And I think there'll be another one coming fairly soon. So it shouldn't be long until there are something like at least three independent, trusted sources of data in the market.
00:02:46.350 - 00:03:32.046, Speaker A: So you can combine those. You can say, if you don't want to trust one of us, you'll be able to say two out of three of these have to give this particular answer. And there are also people talking. If you look at, for example, Martin from consensus piece on the ultimate oracle, there are also some ideas about putting a proof of state voting system above the oracle system. So first of all, you get these answers from the oracle. It's very quick and very cheap. But then if somebody doesn't trust the oracle or if somebody thinks they're wrong, then you can throw it to a vote if you think that you've got a situation where you can get a more reliable result from sort of proof of state voting system.
00:03:32.046 - 00:03:37.086, Speaker A: So there are all kinds of things you can do with this. If you don't see what you need, then get in touch and I hope.
00:03:37.108 - 00:03:38.078, Speaker B: You can have a play around with.
00:03:38.084 - 00:03:41.360, Speaker A: It and see what you can do with it. Okay, so that's realitykeys.com.
