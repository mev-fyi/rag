00:00:03.080 - 00:00:36.614, Speaker A: Okay. Welcome, everyone. This is the Ethereum sequencing and pre conformation call number five. Technically, our 6th call. And today I'm super excited to have Aztec Labs discuss base roll ups and considerations regarding layer one censorship. And I think this is potentially a, a call that's going to discuss some of the breakthroughs that we did in London during the sequencing call there. So without further ado, I'll hand the floor to Aztec Labs.
00:00:44.434 - 00:00:50.334, Speaker B: Hi, everyone. Hopefully you can see this. Okay. If you can't, Justin, please feel free to yell at me.
00:00:51.354 - 00:00:51.970, Speaker A: All good?
00:00:52.042 - 00:01:09.734, Speaker B: Yeah. Nice. So I'm Cooper. I'm on the product team at Aztec Labs. Historically, we've called me the head of decentralization. My job has been making sure that we launch kind of fully decentralized from day one of Aztec. And what that looks like for us is kind of designing our sequencing selection software and how all the provers will talk to each other.
00:01:09.734 - 00:01:31.444, Speaker B: Very excited to share today kind of our current thoughts on based roll ups. We've been talking about it with Justin and all the people on this call for many weeks now. Yeah, super excited to be here. Yeah. So many people have asked in the past week. Just to be super clear. Aztec is currently not a base roll up.
00:01:31.444 - 00:01:53.890, Speaker B: But it may become one eventually. I think that this is kind of important to kind of reconcile. We think about this as a potential future roadmap item for Aztec and potentially a very important one. And so just a little mean for good measure. This is where I put my base roll up, if I had one. And we definitely might have one in the future. And so, yeah, just kick it off with some kind of disclaimers.
00:01:53.890 - 00:02:29.780, Speaker B: A lot of these are my current weekly held opinions. I think a lot of why we're here is to get other people's opinions. Many of them are kind of consistent. Throughout aztec labs. We're growing and a big organization and we're trying to build a very diverse community where everyone has very conflicting opinions. If everyone at Aztec was on the same page that's kind of a less fruitful world to live in, I think, than one in which we're kind of driving ourselves forward and pushing ourselves to get to the best design space we do and will continue to disagree with each other a lot. So if you talk to someone at Aztec Labs, they might not agree with me, they might not agree with the project.
00:02:29.780 - 00:02:59.164, Speaker B: I think that that's actually healthy if you're trying to build a decentralized blockchain ecosystem. And, yeah, a key point is eventually Aztec's roadmap will be in the hands of its community. We really mean this when we try to launch day one with a fully sequence, decentralized sequencing improving set. We want it to be in their hands. And we'll talk a little bit more about what this means. And, yeah, and so regardless of what we say, what I say, what my takes are, it's important to know that the community can become base later. Right? Like, this is not a decision that we want to make in isolation.
00:02:59.164 - 00:03:28.564, Speaker B: This is not a decision we want to make on behalf of our community. We want to make a decision that sets the community up to be most likely to be successful over time and make decisions that they think are in the best interest of Aztec. Cool. Sorry, 1 second, part two of the disclaimers. We're not super here to debate any specific definitions, philosophies, et cetera. We would love if you debate these publicly, especially in our research forum. I'll share a specific link later.
00:03:28.564 - 00:03:46.816, Speaker B: We're not here to sell you on anything or encourage people to use Aztec. That's not the goal of why we're here. We're here to share some ideas in a neutral format with our peers. Yeah. Thank you to Justin. And this is probably the most stacked set of calls I've ever been on in my life. And so the amount of energy here is just truly inspiring for us.
00:03:46.816 - 00:04:06.476, Speaker B: And so we're really excited about that. And we're here because we think those people can actually help us improve our designs. And we think that these people can actually help Aztec be a better network. And we're here because we think that these might just help other L2s. In general, our research is not as sec specific. And, yeah, so I'll talk. This is kind of the end of my preface here.
00:04:06.476 - 00:04:38.796, Speaker B: But the most important takeaway from this is, like, we'd love for anyone on this call, anyone interested to be part of Aztec's community. Like, our goal is just to credibly neutral, bring privacy to Ethereum. And we're going to have a series and an n number of difficult decisions throughout Aztec's lifecycle. And we'd love for the people on this call to help us make difficult decisions. And so, yeah, Aztec's community is really the one, at the end of the day that I think should be making this decision on whether to be based or not. I think we can try to set up the community to be as successful as possible. And that's how we see ourselves stewarding the aztec network.
00:04:38.796 - 00:05:17.088, Speaker B: So thank you for listening to my preface. Enough of that. Let's get started here. What are the benefits for Aztec becoming base? It can actually provide faster block times than Aztecs because current MVP designs, I think a lot of people say that you might need espresso or some of these other shared sequencers or another mechanism to get finality faster than l one block times, which is very true. And Aztecs current designs, our block times are way slower than Ethereum's block times. And so if we do do this, you know, we can actually meaningfully improve as x block times. It's less engineering work in theory.
00:05:17.088 - 00:05:56.096, Speaker B: I think that this has always been one of the key value propositions of reusing l one PPS infrastructure, et cetera, et cetera. All the l one consensus synchronous composability with other roll ups in theory, is something that is a huge value proposition, and we cannot ignore that. And it's more Ethereum aligned. It is more in spirit with Aztec's goals of bringing privacy as credibly neutral to Ethereum as possible. So I think everyone in Aztec would agree with these. I think this is very straightforward. What are the high level counterarguments that we're currently seeing for becoming base? Our roadmap more explicitly becomes Ethereum's roadmap.
00:05:56.096 - 00:06:58.214, Speaker B: If you become base, you're inheriting the changes. Coming to the staking layer to proposing to inclusion lists all these other things, at least in a more meaningful and direct way than other L2s that might have their own sequencing infrastructure or something like that. And this means that you have a reduction of sovereignty, right? Like, you do have to inherit Ethereum's roadmap and effectively the social consensus on what should go into Ethereum's roadmap. And I think that there's like, a fundamental question that we ask ourselves is like, do we want to internalize this uncertainty or kind of externalize it? You know, for a lot of teams who aren't super opinionated, it probably makes a lot of sense to externalize this uncertainty and kind of ride with Ethereum's roadmap. But these are like, really, you know, kind of important questions to the project and to the community. Like, what if we want to deploy immutable and things just kind of drastically change, right? Like, do we have as much confidence in this design as something that we can't kind of internalize? And like, this is more of like a project specific philosophy. And Aztec generally likes to build stuff.
00:06:58.214 - 00:07:28.798, Speaker B: We don't love outsourcing. We don't want to outsource our risk or roadmap in a lot of cases. And so I think this kind of sovereignty of our specific roadmap is one of the key arguments. Or one of the key reasons we would consider not becoming base is we can come up with a roadmap that's ideal in our mind, not ideal in the mind of the entire Ethereum ecosystem. In a way, it has less well defined or understood economic impact. It could definitely have just as good economics. Justin and others have talked a lot about how you can slap your own token.
00:07:28.798 - 00:08:21.764, Speaker B: You can still have Maverick and you can have fee shares. You can have all those things. But there's like a 40 IQ question in our mind, or at least my mind of, like, are projects with large staking networks just kind of worth more just from the market's perspective? Like, you know, not like in practical terms of economic security or otherwise, but like, will the market perceive something with their own large distributed staking set as a more valuable project to potentially invest in than something that doesn't have one? We do think that l one censorship could impact the value proposition. We'll talk about this, you know, throughout the presentation. Specifically, Aztec's ability to get significantly faster block times are kind of predicated on a minimal amount of soft censorship. Right. If people are delaying aztec transactions, and the goal is to try to produce aztec transactions or blocks as quickly as Ethereum can produce blocks, soft censorship can kind of eat into that value proposition in a way.
00:08:21.764 - 00:08:56.292, Speaker B: But we'll talk more about that throughout the presentation. And similarly, l one congestion could impact the value propositions, like if blobs are backlog for inclusion due to high demand or otherwise. Those are not things that are unique to becoming based. All roll up to deal with soft censorship or blob gas prices spiking and stuff like that. We'll talk a little bit about how they might be worse, though, in a based aztec design. So these are super, super high level counterarguments. And you'll know that most of these are, in a sense, kind of like a business decision or like a project decision.
00:08:56.292 - 00:09:24.354, Speaker B: Right. They're not inherently just technical. Um, they're kind of like, what do you want out of out of your project? Um, yeah, cost could go up with that one. And so to be based or not to be based, really, you know, this is a multi billion dollar question for Aztec, for all the other l two s that are considering it. Uh, and it's not something that you can kind of take lightly. You know, it's, it's a, it's a really important thing to think about. And this is like, kind of how Aztec is thinking about its roadmap, just to set, set the stage for, for people to have, you know, some context.
00:09:24.354 - 00:09:49.820, Speaker B: We currently have a local developer environment. You can write, no, our programs, you can deploy them to an aztec node. And we're currently building a testnet. I would say it's coming soon. Everyone says that, but hopefully ours is actually coming soon. If you really want, you can deploy the local developer environment to a persistent node and have a one node testnet. But that's not as interesting, I think, and this is my opinion, is we should build a very basic, fully decentralized sequencer protocol.
00:09:49.820 - 00:10:15.044, Speaker B: This is as articulated on our research forum. If you go to forum dot aztec.net work, we did a request for comments on it. Many of the wonderful people on this call submitted other designs and things like that to it. But I think we should build a very, very basic, fully decentralized protocol. And this should be the v zero kind of Aztec in a way. It might not even support contract deployments, it might just be for sequencers.
00:10:15.044 - 00:10:49.724, Speaker B: In this case, we could actually set up the sequencer set themselves to choose to upgrade the network to enable contract deployments, choose to enable application deployments. And I think that after we have this kind of MVP of a fully decentralized, credibly neutral, privacy focused roll up on Ethereum. Right. We hit a huge milestone. Like we would be the first meaningful roll up that has fully programmable privacy on Ethereum, even if there's obvious ways that it could be improved. I think that that's just a really important milestone for the industry. And there's a lot of incentives to try to get there as quickly as possible.
00:10:49.724 - 00:11:40.344, Speaker B: But as part of this, we do think that the community, the aztec community, that is, the sequencers and the token holders and everyone on this call that cares about privacy on Ethereum should consider performance optimizations to be the priority for the first or second upgrade to aztec. We see two different paths forward here, and obviously one of them is based roll ups and base sequencing. And so we'll talk about that thinking through this model of our roadmap. Like if the first upgrade, second upgrade is going to be specific for performance improvements, there's two categorical ways asset can have faster block times. One is actually going opposed to based roll ups. One's becoming more sovereign ish, in a way, building an l, two based consensus protocol, and one of them is becoming a volym. If we can just throw an ungodly amount of DA somewhere, we can become an optimistic ZK roll up.
00:11:40.344 - 00:12:14.938, Speaker B: We'll talk about this in a bit. The other option is becoming based, and we can have a very, very fast based roll by having faster cryptography. I don't know if this actually means real time proving in the same way that other people on the call does. Aztec has client side proving even in v one. So you send as a user, as your knowledge proof to the network. But generally, Aztec can have faster block times in a base setting by having faster cryptography. Obviously faster cryptography will make Aztec faster across the board.
00:12:14.938 - 00:12:42.934, Speaker B: That kind of goes without saying. Another option is having significant economic collateral on block proposals and a base design. So we'll talk a little bit about the trade offs here, the counterpoint to building some of these things. So an l two based consensus protocol is like, this isn't hard. A lot of people have built l two consensus protocols. This is just engineering scope. If we want to invest in this direction, it's a pretty clear path forward.
00:12:42.934 - 00:12:50.074, Speaker B: Becoming a validium, that's not very ethereum aligned of us. That's just, you know, it's not kind of what we're doing. Yeah, Justin.
00:12:51.574 - 00:13:24.534, Speaker A: Yeah, I just wanted to highlight that becoming a validium and becoming a roll up is somehow orthogonal to the sequencing. Like, you can be a based validium or based roll up. And I also wouldn't say that it's not necessarily very ethereum align. Like, if you do choose to use ethereum sequencing, then. So from settlement alone, then you're kind of inheriting maybe if as money to an extent. And if you choose to do sequencing, then you're even more aligned, even though you might choose to not use the DA layer.
00:13:25.434 - 00:13:29.546, Speaker B: Totally agree. It's definitely a spectrum. Yeah.
00:13:29.570 - 00:13:46.184, Speaker C: I had a question, Justin. I guess if you have like a normal case of ten minute block times that you're kind of using alternative DA to enable based sequencing for your normal kind of like, roll up data. Can you hear me?
00:13:48.244 - 00:13:50.984, Speaker A: I can hear you. The connection is not very good, but I can just about hear you.
00:13:51.724 - 00:14:30.994, Speaker C: Yeah, but basically if you end up creating a lot of applications where the security of transactions are based on kind of like pending state updates on an alternative DA. Yeah, like, it feels like you're in a bit of a weird position because you have a lot of transactions that did not happen if you were just using Ethereum. Who else they would happen if you're using alternative pa? So those transactions don't inherit Ethereum security, because like, if we take an intro, you're trading on state that doesn't exist and only exists in. In the kind of alternative Da universe. So is that still a fair statement?
00:14:33.294 - 00:15:21.742, Speaker A: Right, so when you choose an alternative DA layer, like, you do lose some things. Like, you do lose censorship resistance because this other DA layer can potentially censor you. You do lose liveness. And maybe there's a data availability failure where an attacker kind of basically manages to fool the DA layer to make it think data is available when actually it's not available, and then your validium completely stalls. It just can't move forward, which is a really big failure. But assuming that there is no failure on a slot by slot basis, then you still can get the full synchronous composability and the other advantages that base sequencing provider.
00:15:21.742 - 00:15:36.708, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes sense. I also don't think we're talking about any of these things as, like, mutually exclusive. Right. Like, you could, you would use multiple of these techniques to make block times faster. I appreciate it. Yeah, faster. Cryptography counterpoints this hard.
00:15:36.708 - 00:16:07.610, Speaker B: Like, obviously, everyone's trying to make cryptography faster. We're working on a new proving system called Honk, and significant economic collateralist could potentially centralize around the entity willing to post collateral. It could also push out solo proposers and increase potential censorship concerns. And so, like, very high level. Like, we kind of see this as what's favorable and not favorable. If we had to talk, you know, consolidated down to top two, three things in each category based roll ups, you get sequence and synchronous composability. You're more Ethereum aligned.
00:16:07.610 - 00:16:39.004, Speaker B: You do have some censorship risks, and you do have a little bit of an uncertain roadmap in sovereign. You're less sensitive to those censorship risks. You can kind of internalize them. And people in your validators have kind of opting into the risk that may come with proposing or sequencing for a privacy focused layer, too. A lot of engineering, it might be better for the aztec ecosystem. We're not convinced there's a question mark there for a reason, and it does have weaker composability. I'd say that we're mostly concerned on the uncertainty on the roadmap and censorship risks, which is what we're here to continue talking about.
00:16:39.004 - 00:17:08.028, Speaker B: And I'm excited today. We've done a lot of really nice research, in my opinion, on becoming based. We're excited to share most of that research today. It was posted maybe an hour ago on the aztec research forum. Um, and, yeah, shout out to lasse, our lead smart contract engineer for this research. Uh, I think he articulated a nice idea about collaborative based roll ups, which might be a new articulation there. And so how base ZK in general could work.
00:17:08.028 - 00:17:50.404, Speaker B: And so, basically, to be a base roll up, all the data needed to prove the correctness of the state transition function needs to be made available somewhere. As Justin kind of mentioned, it could be made on a, or an LTA layer could be made available on Ethereum. And like, in a very simple case, it would be possible for Aztec to become a base roll up today. Like our research very conclusively says, if, you know, this is the direction that the community wants to go, we could do this today. However, it has some issues, and we would argue that many of them are unique to privacy protocols. And so in a simple, naive based Aztec, Aztec would send all the data needed to construct a block to l one as part of the block proposal transactions. Otherwise, client side proof withholding attacks are pretty easily possible.
00:17:50.404 - 00:18:22.098, Speaker B: You could put up a block proposal and never reveal the proofs behind the proposal, and it could never get proven. So you'd have to have some kind of for choice rule or something like that. And so this is the most simple model you could possibly come up with, right? If you had effectively enough DA, you could put up the block proposal and you could put up all the proofs behind the block proposal. Again, Aztec is a privacy roll up. You have client side generated zero knowledge proofs. You're not just sending a transaction. And because you're sending client side generated proofs, these are massive proofs, like, very, very large.
00:18:22.098 - 00:18:58.110, Speaker B: And so this alone would use the current three blobs on Ethereum and Aztec would be capped at about 0.8 transactions per second. If you're questioning this, I highly encourage you to go look at the aztec forum. Lasse articulated some really, really good stuff, but we know for a fact that this would work. It would be quite cool. It would be very based. And another idea, potentially one that we think is more feasible and could get you beyond some of those initial limitations, is kind of an economically based version of aztec.
00:18:58.110 - 00:19:48.634, Speaker B: So we have a naive based Aztec and we have an economically based aztec. You could treat aztec data similar to how pre conformations work in a shared sequencer. You could require very large economic bonds that effectively act as a gambler, guarantee that the proposal and the proofs behind that block proposal will eventually be revealed and will be made available. And if not, you'd have some fork choice rule that determines kind of slashing conditions. Maybe a mental model is that the per block bond could be more than the max ethereum have ever extracted to prevent proof withholding attacks. You know, just taking it to the extreme. There would never be an incentive to put up a block proposal that would get kind of reorged and you'd get slashed because you can just make the bond so arbitrary, high, arbitrarily high that they will always put up a proposal and reveal the data behind it.
00:19:48.634 - 00:20:43.486, Speaker B: Definitely just go look at the forum research and search for, for choice rules, if you're curious how that would work. And yeah, so these are like the two kind of naive options that we have articulated so far. And we know like, we're 100% confident that either of these would work. And we know that there's a clear path to kind of scaling these things, right, through internal cryptography improvements, through compression, through more DA on Ethereum and in the forum, we actually say that if you aren't like Aztec and you don't have all these privacy zkps from your client side proofs, you probably should be a base roll up is actually our current take. I think we clearly state this in the research. And so, yeah, this is kind of where we got, at least on the two design options right now currently available. Um, and we're going to talk a little bit more about censorship, and we'll talk about some other concerns.
00:20:43.486 - 00:21:19.944, Speaker B: Um, and so, yeah, what kind of l one censorship may exist? And how does this kind of impact base sequencing? So you have soft censorship, right, delaying inclusion of transactions or blobs, and then you have like strong censorship, right, is like if they just simply never got included. I think that these are kind of well agreed upon definitions. And so what can be done about l one blob censorship? Um, like the naive idea is like, we're worried about l one transaction censorship. You could have blob inclusion lists. I don't think that there's a huge amount of support here. And so another idea that we talked about is an idea of like a shared encrypted blob registry. I think that this is kind of a cool idea.
00:21:19.944 - 00:21:56.784, Speaker B: And how it work is you would encrypt all the blobs, you'd have all the roll ups or all roll ups that wanted to opt into the system, submit blobs to the same registry from effectively eoas or one off accounts, and you'd have roll ups actually decrypt these blobs as part of their proofs. Right. As part of your proof verification, you would reference this version registry. It's kind of a cool idea, and it's completely supported right now on Ethereum, no changes necessary or anything like that. You'd have to build some smart contracts and update your circuits and all those things. But you could do this. It'd be pretty cool.
00:21:56.784 - 00:22:40.924, Speaker B: And so I guess a question from our side is this would work. We would no longer really be worried about blob censorship. But does this make economic, makes sense economically and from like, a risk management perspective, right? Like any, you know, if Aztec is using a encrypted blob registry with a bunch of other roll ups, they're kind of opting into sharing some of Aztec's concerns. In a way, it might make sense for all the privacy protocols or all the privacy focused l two s to go in this direction and kind of work together on solutions that, you know, can solve our issues collectively. And, yeah, shout out to Ben Phish and Dinkrod. I think that they originally talked about this encrypted blob registry idea with Joe and Lasse a couple weeks ago in London. It's kind of a cool idea.
00:22:40.924 - 00:23:13.412, Speaker B: We're not super sure if it makes sense if other people would actually use it, either economically or just from risk management. Kind of a cool idea. What can be done about l one soft transaction censorship? This is going against the base role of design in a way, and is an option. It's not mutually exclusive or otherwise. You could settle infrequently. You could settle every 24 hours or n hours, and you can basically mitigate and acknowledge that soft censorship can and will occur. And you just lean into it.
00:23:13.412 - 00:24:12.604, Speaker B: You try to make those soft censorship concerns less real time concerns for your users. And, yeah, so in this logic, decoupling Aztec and leaning in could actually make more sense than trying to get closer to the entities knowing to be censoring. You try to bifurcate user pre conformations and what they're worried about versus kind of settling onto Ethereum and what can be done about strong l one censorship. I mean, we like inclusion lists, and I would say having, like, guarantees on what inclusion lists will ship would actually mitigate a lot of the concerns here. Like a worst case fallback, right? If Aztec just like, can't use Ethereum in some way, like it's actually causing liveness failures or otherwise, is your kind of only option at some point is to be an zero one. And obviously we don't want to do that. Otherwise we would have been building a while ago, but we would again encourage people to consider adding inclusion lists to Electra.
00:24:12.604 - 00:24:15.404, Speaker B: Justin, you have another question?
00:24:16.304 - 00:24:39.764, Speaker A: Yeah, so I actually don't think that inclusion list helps at all with strong censorship. So basically, the strong censorship is when there's more than 51% of the testers who want to censor something, and they will just ignore the inclusion lists if they want to do that. So inclusion lists only help with weak censorship.
00:24:41.984 - 00:24:59.646, Speaker B: Makes sense. Thank you for clarifying. I've updated the slide. Yeah. And if that happens, I guess the only option is really to become an l one. But I don't think that we see this as a realistic possibility and we are still excited about inclusionless. Yeah.
00:24:59.646 - 00:25:36.450, Speaker B: So, main findings, base roll ups are much easier to implement for optimistic roll ups than ck roll ups. I think that there's just. It's a simpler design. Space loss articulates this nicely in our forum research post. Base roll ups may provide, like, a very viable path forward to decreasing as x block times. If concerned about censorships, collectively, Altus could come up with shared standards that effectively mitigate this and kind of share this risk, you know, through this encrypted registry idea or otherwise. If Ethereum wants to have serious, privacy focused solution, we think it needs to retain its credible neutrality.
00:25:36.450 - 00:26:14.774, Speaker B: It's the most credible neutral platform that exists literally in the whole world, which is why we're all excited about it. We do advocate for inclusionless and Elektra finding new, more neutral builders, stuff like that we think could help, and increasing DA limitations, specifically because privacy protocols have a lot of DA and we would prefer not to use all DA and. Yeah, so these are the main findings of our research. All of these things are pretty practical and they could be implemented, like, right now. Like, the short term time horizon is quite promising and. Yeah, so let's. Let's take a poll like, we're serious when we actually want Aztec's roadmap to be fully driven by the community.
00:26:14.774 - 00:26:22.814, Speaker B: I don't know if we can do this in Zoom, Justin, but I'd be curious if we could take a bowl of people on the call and see if they think that Aztec should become a base role.
00:26:23.574 - 00:26:43.714, Speaker A: Yeah, so we can actually do this on Telegram. I will create a poll. We can do this now, whoever's online. So should Aztec. This is fun. Become a based roll up and then we have, yes, no show results.
00:26:45.814 - 00:27:18.004, Speaker B: Yeah, and like, I would say, like, we're very serious. We, you know, want to set the community up in the best way. We want to ship something neutral that has privacy to Ethereum, and we don't want to control its roadmap. We don't want to force the project into our direction or a direction that we think is the best. And so not saying we'll abide by the results of this poll, but I'd be curious to see how it tracks over time. And you know, maybe at some point some, some version of voting like this is actually going to make the decision to upgrade Aztec to becoming a base roll up. So.
00:27:19.184 - 00:27:30.844, Speaker A: So here are some preliminary results. We have 17 who voted yes and one person only who voted no. So maybe worth hearing out. Who voted no. I think it's Noah.
00:27:32.064 - 00:28:06.514, Speaker B: Yeah. And last slide I have here is we really want all these discussions, debates to live long term, at least on our research forum. We think it's much more approachable, accessible, it's better for information preservation. So please, please, we would encourage you guys to take a look at this and yeah, follow us on Twitter. Thank you for the time the polls. Not legally binding to Odysseus in the chat, aztec team members are allowed to vote Santiago. I actually think Santiago would be in the base camp.
00:28:06.514 - 00:28:14.934, Speaker B: He would be in favor of Aztec becoming a base roller. Ben. Yeah, what's up?
00:28:16.714 - 00:28:41.544, Speaker D: Yeah, if you're okay doing a bit of q and A, I wasn't sure what the agenda is, but I had a question about some things. So if you could go back to the part where you're talking about sort of the trade off between being a base roll up and having sovereignty, I was curious to understand a bit more there.
00:28:45.124 - 00:29:41.796, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, high level, we think that, I mean, there's a couple takes there, right? Like at a high level, we don't love token voting, like for upgrades and governance. And we were trying to design a world in which the sequencers of aztec, the provers of Aztec, the node operators of Aztec, have the ability to dictate the aztec roadmap in a more meaningful way, trying to manifest or reflect the social consensus that you see on Ethereum where you actually require and need the node operators to upgrade their software. And so we really, in this kind of model, or if we go with the based approach, really the only way that we see viable to upgrade the network is through some form of token voting. We're not going to have a centralized upgrade council the foundation themselves or otherwise isn't going to dictate network upgrades. And so maybe that's hopefully just like a practical example of where we see a trade off with sovereignty.
00:29:41.980 - 00:29:45.984, Speaker D: But why is that incompatible with being a base roll up? That's what I didn't understand.
00:29:47.044 - 00:29:56.064, Speaker B: It's not incompatible. We're saying it could reduce your sovereignty. Like it limits the design space of what our upgrades could be.
00:29:56.564 - 00:29:58.348, Speaker D: Yeah, I didn't understand that.
00:29:58.396 - 00:29:58.812, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:58.908 - 00:30:11.524, Speaker D: So how does the, how does the aspect of involving l one, uh, validators, um, or allowing them to participate as sequencers reduce your ability to do that? I didn't understand.
00:30:12.584 - 00:30:15.804, Speaker B: So you could imagine up, go ahead, Joe.
00:30:16.304 - 00:30:21.724, Speaker C: It's whether that's a staking set or not. So if you have one proposers also staking.
00:30:25.104 - 00:30:32.536, Speaker B: I think Joe's at the airport. Uh, we should probably just mute him. And, um, kind of definition of like.
00:30:32.600 - 00:30:41.354, Speaker C: Any ethereum and any of the proposals can propose then would reduce kind of the set of people who are aztec aligned and care about operating.
00:30:42.774 - 00:31:10.900, Speaker D: So you're worried that it will reduce the number of people who are, like, staking and participating in Nasdaq, because if all the l one proposers are like, you know, have, have the ability to participate in sequencers, then it may just reduce the overall size of your community of external sequencers who care about aztec and who would be participating in this decision. Did I understand correctly? I sort of tried to piece together.
00:31:11.052 - 00:31:37.104, Speaker B: Yeah, Joe is cutting out there. I think that you somewhat summarized it. Generally in this model, we would be less likely to entirely rely on sequencers to facilitate aztec upgrades because they would care about so many other things besides us versus a sequencing set who's exclusively somewhat dedicated to our community and what's in our best interest. Yeah. Okay.
00:31:37.144 - 00:32:01.974, Speaker D: Well, anyways, I won't take more time. It just, it seems like to me personally, just my, it seems a bit of a stretch, like, it seems like you could engender a lot of interest in the aztec from the aztec community and decision making that without, you know, necessarily having everyone participate in sequencing. But let's table this and talk about another time. Super interesting. Thank you, Hooper.
00:32:02.314 - 00:32:21.014, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. I mean, I think it's fair and we're not saying it completely, like, gets rid of your sovereignty or anything. At least through our current lens, it does change how we would upgrade the network and we'd probably be more reliant on token voting in this model is at least our current thinking, I think. Noah, you were next.
00:32:23.274 - 00:33:08.938, Speaker E: Thanks for having me up. I guess I'm the one person that voted no on this. I think the main reasons why is I believe that synchronous composability may be easier if you are using a sovereign BFT style consensus for that synchronous composability as well as using, I wanted to hear kind of, what are you guys kind of thoughts about how you're using AlT DA with base sequencing? Because wouldn't you just be posting a commitment hash for a bundle of transactions let's say we're using slash J. Let's say we're posting five transactions on Slash J. Wouldn't just post that kind of transaction hash on Ethereum then. So then technically the ordering is still happening on the alternative DA layer at that point. I just kind of want to get your thoughts on that.
00:33:08.938 - 00:33:20.794, Speaker E: That was kind of why would know is because I think that base sequencing with all DA gets a bit confusing as well as synchronous composability might just be easier with a sovereign layer because you don't have to worry about theorem itself at that point. And it can also be cheaper.
00:33:20.834 - 00:34:08.474, Speaker B: Then I think we would generally agree. Not sure if there is like a specific question in there, but yeah, the design space for base sequencing, who is also using Ethereum DA seems much more clean, simple and kind of elegant in a sense. Also, Aztec as a project who very much believes in governance minimization and doesn't really want to have any formal governance. Celestia is pretty good about this. They mostly do social consensus. But I'd imagine some of the other DA layers have their own governance and Aztec would be hesitant to introduce them into the mix. Thank you for voting contrary to the herd, I guess.
00:34:09.114 - 00:34:10.134, Speaker E: Glad to.
00:34:10.714 - 00:34:14.294, Speaker B: Yeah, Justin, I think you were next.
00:34:15.874 - 00:34:58.874, Speaker A: Yeah, I just wanted to comment a little bit on Ben's question. Like there is a loss of sovereignty in a very specific case, which is when you've chosen to be a base roll up and you've completely given up on your governance, so you're fully immutable. And that's something you mentioned in your presentation. Then basically you become subservient to whatever sequencing the l one does. Having said that, my guess is that Aztec will have governance for some years to come. And the other guess that I would make is that l one sequencing will ossify over time. And so there might be a point in time where if you do want to become immutable, well, actually the l one itself will also be very close to immutable.
00:35:00.874 - 00:35:16.574, Speaker B: Yeah, that would totally make sense. I've been advocating for Aztec to try to deploy immutably for a while now. I think it would be really cool. But there's obviously a lot of practical reasons not to. And I agree it's much more pragmatic on a long term time horizon if ethereum is more ossified. So.
00:35:18.714 - 00:35:20.614, Speaker A: And then to go back to NOAA's.
00:35:21.234 - 00:36:07.024, Speaker C: I think I can just on that point. And then even if the roll up instances are immutable, which is our current plan, so you have like v zero, v one, v two deployments, and you don't upgrade between them. The community can look for bridges and we call importance for assets coming into the network. The community could decide to use an aztec sovereign secreting set to move assets between mutual versions. And you lose that in a base model because that right would be conferred to now random Ethereum sequences who may not have the same interests. So you have to have token voting as a way to kind of stop malicious, malicious moving of assets, is our current view.
00:36:08.324 - 00:36:43.454, Speaker B: Yeah, Joe's going on a rabbit hole of our governance plans. The current plans are high level, have like an immutable version registry, immutable deployments. You could add new things to the version registry. And so the first deployment may or may not be immutable, and then if the community wants to deploy something with formal governance, they could do so. I do think it would be really cool to also get to a point in a world where there might be multiple versions of aztec deployed simultaneously. Some of them might be immutable, some of them might not be, some of them might be based, some of them might not be based, and they give you different characteristics out of the privacy protocol you choose to use. Daniel, I believe you were next.
00:36:46.354 - 00:37:20.394, Speaker F: Yeah, thanks. I wanted to add one small comment related to the sovereignty that Ben brought about. It's similar to what Justin mentioned, but on the technical side. So there is a specific reason why you would lose sovereignty over when, when using base drops. And that's practically due to the restriction on who is eligible to sequence on a one. That's purely one of the requirements of being a base drop. So that's a.
00:37:20.394 - 00:37:46.474, Speaker F: And you mentioned it briefly a couple of minutes ago. So you are losing sovereignty in a way because you are forced to sequence in some specific way. So you have limits on the, let's say, technical upgrades that you are able to do, but that may or may not be something that's small enough for you to consider. A good trade off.
00:37:49.134 - 00:37:50.394, Speaker B: Totally makes sense.
00:37:51.494 - 00:39:06.612, Speaker D: Sorry to just jump in here, because I feel like this is something that people are getting confused on a lot. So I think we've discussed this a lot, but base sequencing doesn't mean that you necessarily are restricting the set of parties who are allowed to participate in sequencing to the l one validators. You are giving the l one validators the option to participate, and you are giving them a privileged ability as well to participate. But there's a range of designs that we discussed, and so maybe for Aztec, for example, it may make sense for you to have the control in the hands of a sovereign sequencing set, that only sells the right to propose to l one validators when it makes sense. Because the whole point of involving l one validators is for synchronous composability with the l one. And you don't like, I think we've discussed this with times, base rollups doesn't necessarily mean that you give up the sovereignty to l one validators. You can also, if you have a way of including the l one validators in a way that enables synchronous composability at least part of the time when it economically makes sense for your roll up.
00:39:06.612 - 00:39:14.604, Speaker D: That is a form of base sequencing, and that may mitigate the concerns that you have around giving up sovereignty.
00:39:15.344 - 00:39:47.554, Speaker F: But in that case, the main benefit with universal synchronous composability becomes blurred. Because if you allow for optionally transferring the sequencing to l one proposers or the l one coinbase at the given slot, then you're reducing universal synchronous compostability by default. So unless everyone decides to sequence in a very specific way, you lower the chances of universal synchronous composability.
00:39:48.094 - 00:39:57.634, Speaker D: Yeah, it's a design trade off. But as we discussed, then, Aztec may be somewhere on the design tradeoff. I think the point that I'm making is that it's not completely binary.
00:40:01.254 - 00:40:11.874, Speaker B: I think we've talked about this where we've had, in the current designs, we have a random leader election that specifically randomly elected leader could choose to sell pre conformations through a stressor or something like that.
00:40:12.174 - 00:41:04.744, Speaker D: And so, or any, any other way. I mean, whether it's through espresso or not is orthogonal. But like you could, yeah, you could, you could sell it, you could sell it to the l one validators, and there could be a trade off, or half the time you could give it to the l one validators, half the time you could do it yourself. I think something that we went over in London is that, like, we want to have sort of a more sort of inclusive idea of what base sequencing is, because it would be a shame to create this completely, you know, binary bifurcation between, like, what base sequencing is and what it isn't, for the exact reasons that you're saying here. Like, it would be a shame to have Aztec, like, never do base sequencing never involve l invalidators just because that means complete loss of sovereignty. So this is a great example of where having something in the middle on the trade off space would make sense.
00:41:05.664 - 00:41:48.198, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes sense to us. And like the current designs where anyone can run an aztec sequencer, you know, we would never restrict them from any based activities or, you know, otherwise that they may choose to do and make money off of. I would also just say on the, on the point, we did try to articulate at least our approach or our kind of current thinking. And so this is just like the preview of the thing I've been teasing in the forum. And so we're kind of going at it with this definition of a collaborative based roll up. And I know we all need more random definitions and flavors of base roll ups, but hopefully this gives you at least a little sense of how we're thinking about it if you choose to read this. And Ben, we would love your opinions in the form.
00:41:48.198 - 00:41:54.794, Speaker B: As always, Ben, you still have your hand up. Do you have other questions?
00:41:57.234 - 00:42:00.074, Speaker D: No, sorry, Cooper, I just gotta lower my head.
00:42:00.114 - 00:42:01.894, Speaker C: Thank you very much. Yeah.
00:42:03.834 - 00:42:11.610, Speaker B: No worries. We're definitely getting wrecked in this poll. Right now. Everyone is choosing day sequencing, but I guess, you know, it is the right.
00:42:11.642 - 00:42:14.374, Speaker D: Crowd, I suppose so what do you expect?
00:42:16.034 - 00:42:28.254, Speaker B: There are a lot of very smart people on this call, and we also trust they're aligned with our goals of wanting to see privacy on Ethereum. So, Justin?
00:42:30.434 - 00:43:32.380, Speaker A: Yeah, I just wanted to go back to Noah's question around how would it work with LDA and base sequencing, and especially with respect to synchronous composability. So one of the requirements for synchronous composability is that you have shared sequencing. And so if you have LDA, you're basically introducing a different sequencer at the DA level. And so what you can still do is basically have synchronous composability for all the validiums that have opted in to using celestia as a DA layer. Now there might be another approach where you can have full synchronous composability for all the Bayes roll ups and all the Bayes validiums, which is a bit more optimistic, where basically the sequencing happens by the l one sequencer and they promise to eventually publish on Celestia maybe a few seconds later. And if they don't, then they stand to get slashed. But it's not something that I've thought of much.
00:43:32.380 - 00:43:36.904, Speaker A: But yeah, there might be solutions, basically.
00:43:37.244 - 00:44:00.372, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes sense. I'd be curious back to the specific question of an encrypted blob registry. If anyone has takes on that, it's a cool idea. Economically it seems questionable, and from risk management it seems questionable. But I'm curious if anyone has thoughts about that specifically. Yeah, Marat, also, I liked your inclusion list post.
00:44:00.548 - 00:44:55.404, Speaker G: Thank you. Yeah, it solves the economics problem and the censorship one, but we still need to propagate blobs faster. So regarding encrypted blobs, memcriment has this encrypted mempool, at least for the bids they're encrypted, and the bid encryption is important because now you can't really basically see what the other blobs are bidding for. And that can be, I guess, an economic censorship kind of angle. So at least that's what we've been thinking on. But what can be added is the whole blob in there as well, which then becomes pretty interesting. But we would have to really articulate what the registry looks like, and I don't think I was at that particular discussion in London, but we could curate a registry through this mechanism, I think.
00:44:55.404 - 00:45:25.904, Speaker G: But then it becomes a contention on who curates the registry. Is it a protocol level registry then? Is it enforced? Is it an inclusion list? Does everyone see it? Can there be griefing because of that? Because of the size of blobs? So there's kind of a number of problems that comes with the registry. But I generally really like the idea, and I think more kind of encryption when it comes to blobs, which are not really contending on state, is generally a good thing.
00:45:28.004 - 00:45:32.504, Speaker B: That makes a lot of sense. I'll have to read the rest of your post. I know you dropped it right before this call.
00:45:33.124 - 00:45:39.304, Speaker G: It was unintentional, by the way. It just happened to be very kind of, I guess, synergetic at the same time.
00:45:39.654 - 00:46:14.054, Speaker B: No, it's good stuff. Odysseus, I saw you just posted Eigen Da plus 4844 seems more trust minimized than celestia. I would say technically it might be, but socially we don't think so. Eigen Da has like four multi sigs in it and otherwise, so kind of different set of assumptions there. Matthew, you were next in the question queue, I think. So how do you avoid censorship of the entire shared registry? You couldn't. It would still be subject to soft or strong censorship.
00:46:14.054 - 00:46:30.510, Speaker B: But the idea is it'd be less hard to censor specific actors in, like the encrypted. Like the whole encrypted registry could still get fucked, pretty much. So there's some like, critical mass of like, buyers who would have to participate.
00:46:30.542 - 00:46:31.438, Speaker C: To make it useful.
00:46:31.566 - 00:47:02.604, Speaker B: Because even when it's a small registry, you wouldn't be able to censor specific rollops without censoring everyone so at that point, it just might be more worth it to censor everyone, is that what you're saying? Yeah. It would only work if you got significant buy in from pretty popular roll ups that are not, maybe not even doing privacy things that you wouldn't have reasons to potentially censor. Lynn, I think you were next.
00:47:03.344 - 00:47:25.594, Speaker H: Yeah, I also had a question about that registry part. So when we say censorship, resistance, there's the censorship from the next sequence, there's an x proposer. There's also censorship from the module to the O network. And this encrypting the blobs, this protects against the latter and not the formula, correct?
00:47:28.414 - 00:47:41.554, Speaker B: It would protect against soft censorship. It would help protect against soft censorship. As Justin correctly identified earlier. Strong censorship would be if, like, a majority of the validators just kind of never let you touch that registry, I guess, in a sense.
00:47:42.534 - 00:48:00.360, Speaker H: But if there's soft censorship, for example, if the next sequencer said that they do not want to sequence aztec transactions, so they won't even create the blob, then that's a form of, like, how does the encrypting the blobs help that?
00:48:00.392 - 00:48:25.034, Speaker B: In that case, there would be two different concerns. You would be worried about proposals and block, like, block proposals being censored. And separately, you'd be worried about ta getting censored. They would. They're not super related. Like, even in the current designs, where Aztec has its own own sequencer set, we still might be interested in this idea of an encrypted blob registry. Justin, you can chime in.
00:48:26.454 - 00:49:04.346, Speaker A: Yeah. So the idea basically is to change censorship from a blacklist approach to a whitelist approach. So right now, if you want to censor, there's a blacklist, for example, the OFAC SDN list. But if you have this encryption, then the only way to meaningfully censor is to have a whitelist of approved contracts, and that might still be possible. And everything that's not part of this whitelist would kind of all be bundled together. But the hope is that there's just so much activity on Ethereum that what is not part of the whitelist would be very economically meaningful. I guess another comment is that there doesn't have to be one registry.
00:49:04.346 - 00:49:54.462, Speaker A: There can be an arbitrary number of registries, and actually there could be one registry per encrypted blob. So, like, keeping, one of the questions is, can you just add the registry to the blacklist? Well, that doesn't really work because you can just always create new registries. Another thing is that we already kind of have registries. For example, we have inscriptions. Just people just post art and it could just be encrypted white noise art and no one would ever know. Other things you can do, for example, is you can, you can push data in the lower bits of a cat image and no one would know the wiser. And then your proof would prove that, hey, actually, this cat image contains aztec transactions.
00:49:54.462 - 00:49:59.234, Speaker A: So I really do think that this encrypted blog idea is very robust.
00:50:03.214 - 00:50:10.514, Speaker B: Thank you. I cannot take credit for it at all. Lynn, did that answer your questions? Maybe. Probably not.
00:50:10.654 - 00:50:32.170, Speaker H: Yeah, just this one. So, so you said that this proposers censorship and DEA censorship is separate. So this is the case where the proposal and honest. But the de is. But in the base case, didn't it most the same, like, still didn't see that.
00:50:32.282 - 00:51:03.494, Speaker A: So for settlement, that would be specific to the aztec contract. So the settlement transaction could be soft censored and so it could be delayed by the few blocks. But the blobs, there's no reference to aztec at the point when they're published. No one knows that it's an aztec blob other than the person who published. And so the l one proposer can't meaningfully censor other than if they're, if they have some sort of whitelist based censorship, which in my opinion, is not really meaningful, not really workable for them.
00:51:03.954 - 00:51:09.552, Speaker H: But in the based case, doesn't the proposer also creates the blob? So even if you.
00:51:09.568 - 00:51:31.204, Speaker A: Oh, no. The blobs are created by the builder market and the searcher market. We have proposer builder separation. The l one proposer only signs off on the header. They have no knowledge of the block contents. And actually, that is a security requirement because otherwise the builders and the searchers can get unbundled.
00:51:32.964 - 00:51:33.984, Speaker H: I see.
00:51:36.844 - 00:51:59.164, Speaker B: Lynn and I guess anyone else. I'm always happy to get on a call and chat or, you know, talk about whatever, especially if we didn't answer your question. Happy to get on a call, George. I'll go to you next. I also want to thank George and the lime chain folks for they give us a good doc. And we've had some calls about vanilla based sequencing, so shout out to them. Thank you.
00:52:01.304 - 00:52:07.724, Speaker I: My question is not about encrypted blobs, and this is why I was constantly bumping myself backwards. So if anyone.
00:52:08.584 - 00:52:17.472, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's safe to change the subject. We are running out of time. I don't know if we're going to do the 30 minutes overview or kind of hang out after but feel free to change the subject.
00:52:17.648 - 00:52:40.764, Speaker I: I hate to put you on the spot. And if you tell us that maybe we should discuss this in the non recorded section, please tell me, because I kind of know your opinion. But what's your opinion? As you said, that your opinions are not ad stick opinions per se around the specific part of base sequencing idea that is the soft requirement or the suggestions of usage of restaking.
00:52:43.424 - 00:52:52.768, Speaker B: I'm not sure I fully understand your question. What are my thoughts on restaking as a requirement, or would you consider this.
00:52:52.816 - 00:52:55.316, Speaker I: Favorable or unfavorable part if ad stick.
00:52:55.340 - 00:52:56.464, Speaker A: Is to goal based?
00:52:59.684 - 00:53:25.084, Speaker B: I have not seen a governance minimized restaking platform. And so my opinion is I would encourage the aztec community to not adopt third party software that is not sharing that same philosophy. I don't know if that answered your question, but maybe it did.
00:53:25.744 - 00:53:29.072, Speaker I: Your opinion answers my question. I just wanted to know what your.
00:53:29.088 - 00:53:30.296, Speaker A: Opinion is on that.
00:53:30.480 - 00:54:04.844, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, my opinion is we're trying to design Aztec without any type of like upgradable multi sigs specifically for ensuring sufficient decentralization and not necessarily like individual liability or accountability. And I think that for preserving that within our own protocol, it would be kind of strange to adopt third party solutions who have significant amounts of antithetical design choices. Obviously, I love Eigen layer and all the restaking folks, but Aztec has different concerns than others.
00:54:10.024 - 00:54:36.500, Speaker A: Cooper, thank you so much. We're at the hour, so I'm going to wrap this up. I do want to very quickly give the listeners who are not part of the telegram group an update on the poll. So we've had 31 people vote yes. We've had four people vote no. So that's 89% voted yes. Of those who voted yes, we have Joe Andrews from Aztec and Santiago also from Aztec.
00:54:36.500 - 00:54:53.620, Speaker A: And of those who voted no, we have Quintus, who voted no just because he wanted to be contrarian. On that note, thanks Cooper, again for this wonderful presentation. And now we have the 30 minutes open discussion that's off the record.
00:54:53.732 - 00:54:54.084, Speaker B: Thank you.
