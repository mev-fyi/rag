00:00:11.350 - 00:00:31.302, Speaker A: Thank you, Chris. Good evening to all of you. First of all, I would like to congratulate Paul for his fantastic presentation. And I'm pretty sure he will monetize it and he will even disrupt the energy retail industry. So, well done. And I'm looking forward for the next steps. So, my name is Karsten Stocker.
00:00:31.302 - 00:01:08.314, Speaker A: I'm the working for a big corporate utility called RBE and called End Power in UK. And so my mission is to bring blockchain to the real world, to push it in the physical world. And that's like what we are planning to do with our global chains delivery network. Quick introduction to RWE. RWE is a huge energy provider utility. We are currently splitting up our business, which means we take out the old lignite coal fired power plants, the nuclear power plants. Combine this with our trading business.
00:01:08.314 - 00:01:46.466, Speaker A: This is one part of after the split, and the other part is basically all the good stuff. That's a grid business to make sure you have reliable grid supply and connectivity. It's renewable business and it's retail business. And unfortunately, I think with Paul's technology, we can probably expect that retail business will be further disrupted. Digitalization, blockchain, zero margin economy. And that's the reason why we as RWE have to reinvent ourselves. And we spent a lot of efforts and resources on innovation topics.
00:01:46.466 - 00:02:24.686, Speaker A: We're doing business model innovation, design thinking, human centered design to drive this forward. And now, basically, I'm coming with my blockchain. Technology driven innovation. It's a kind of clash, even our innovation team, because it's not business model innovation, but it will be business model innovation on a different timescale. Good. Are we splitting up new co innovation? And blockchain is one part of our strategy. Why blockchain for RWE? So blockchain is a perfect tool for sharing economy, to share all kinds of assets, batteries with your neighbors, pv feed in into the grid.
00:02:24.686 - 00:02:47.306, Speaker A: You can sell it to your neighbors, you can share your routers with your neighbors for data connectivity. You can share your autonomous cars. You can share everything very possible with blockchain. And that's why we love it. And it's also community based. It's more cooperative business. And we see this as business models going forward as well.
00:02:47.306 - 00:03:27.026, Speaker A: And yeah, another reason why we love it trends toward decentralization. Yes, a good infrastructure, power supply is decentralizing, and then we just need a perfect match. A technology is decentralized as well, so that we can untap the full potential. It's about reuse and redistribution of access capacity I think the slock ed people will also say it. A lot of assets are not just leveraged, they are there, they are not used like a car. And with blockchain we would like to unlock the full potential of the assets by proper sharing reuse. You will see new forms of value exchange.
00:03:27.026 - 00:03:50.154, Speaker A: And the last bullet here, it's called beyond utility. That's very important. So because in the energy industry. So we are attacked by a lot of new players. Tesla, Google, IBM, they're all moving in the energy business. The startups, electrons of the world moving in the energy business. Boy groups are now starting selling energy contracts.
00:03:50.154 - 00:04:24.810, Speaker A: And it's very competitive. And for that reason VSRE would like to proper job in energy business. But also go beyond into other businesses that we see later. Delivery network. It's basically the participation all participants involved in buying, selling stuff, producing stuff, transporting, distribution, installing and servicing of goods. Everything kind of physical stuff going on in the world. And for us it means energy manufacturing.
00:04:24.810 - 00:05:02.278, Speaker A: I think we will look, or basically we look into kind of new ways of manufacturing industry. 4.03 d printers on the blockchain to properly share them, to do proper digital rights management to take out a lot of parasites out of the value chain. And that's what for example, looking into the manufacturing space logistics. One of our partners is a huge logistics company. They're looking to crowd logistics and again, huge potential to combine cloud logistics, sharing fully automated transactions via the blockchain as well. Mobility, I will explain this later.
00:05:02.278 - 00:05:43.810, Speaker A: And communication. So what does it mean? It's a global chain delivery network. So we believe if we have a blockchain business model in the zero marginal something world. So we can only make proper kind of business model out of this. If we think globally, that's what's called global chain delivery network. And for us it's a combination of blockchain smart contracts, smart contracts with a business logic involved, plus IoT. Because via IoT would like to connect the blockchain to the real use case in the real physical world and the physical delivery I just mentioned.
00:05:43.810 - 00:06:24.766, Speaker A: So we are very passionate about this and the reason why we not only look into energy, but also beyond one of the use cases Paul mentioned energy billing. We have built this even last year and even before us, other people have built this as well. A lot of people are looking into this. That's basically peer to peer energy trading. So one of the guys has a pv on the rooftop. Another neighbor wants to buy the energy supply from the neighbor with pv on the photovoltaic on the rooftop. And this can be done as a smart contract on the blockchain or even as a decentralized autonomous organization on the blockchain.
00:06:24.766 - 00:07:03.102, Speaker A: And we call this peer to peer energy trading. Basically, prosumer and consumer meet in a smart contract with a bid with ask, they conclude a deal, and then it's clear that prosumer delivers energy to consumer. And in addition, because we're living in the real world, we have a cooperative living on the blockchain. Prosumers, consumers, we basically aggregate them because there's always a delta in terms of supply and demand. And then we interact with other wholesale market players, with the grid providers. We call this aggregation. And yeah, that can be done on the blockchain as well.
00:07:03.102 - 00:08:02.270, Speaker A: And then the blockchain gets an interface to other wholesale players in the market. So we built this. So we looked a lot into personalization of energy from Ux user experience perspective and basically connected smart meters to raspberry PI. So it's working technology. And of course we did this on the Ethereum blockchain. What is difficult with this is regulation, because most of the regulation, most of the market mechanisms are basically there to protect central business models, such as subsidies for feed interface net metering, which means from a customer perspective, with all the central elements, it's very difficult to make a business from a customer perspective out of this, to sell energy from one neighbor to the other. And because the regulatory challenges, we started looking to electric vehicle charging, and that's what we call block charge.
00:08:02.270 - 00:08:51.978, Speaker A: We do this together with slockit. And here the basic idea is I connect a charging pole electric car to the blockchain, and then basically via the blockchain, I do authentication and billing of the charging process. This can be done today. There are also regulatory requirements, but we think the market mechanisms are much more in favor for such a business model. And basically we pressed the wrong button here. Thanks, Chris. We are very, very passionate now to bring this out of the laboratory in the real physical world.
00:08:51.978 - 00:09:24.090, Speaker A: So blockchain moving into the real physical world. And that's why we're not only doing this in our laboratory environment. So we are partnering with inodeset. Inodeset is innovation center with an own compost, with two microgrids, with additional other stuff. I will come back to this. And so we are now planning to deploy our blockchain solutions at inodeset to drive the going out in the physical world. And again, that's also built on ethereum.
00:09:24.090 - 00:10:04.370, Speaker A: I would like to show this slide here. It's a very basic slide. It's basically saying we have Alice and Bob. Bob is providing, for example, energy to Alice in electric car charging. Then Alice is sending cryptocurrency such as ether or bitcoin to Bob. And what's very, very nice in the moment of this individual single transaction, that we have at least three industries converging in this single moment. And that's the energy industry, because we provide energy, it's the automotive industry because the cars involved and the banking industry.
00:10:04.370 - 00:10:58.554, Speaker A: And from my perspective, the race is on who will dominate these transactions going forward, because who will be first, who gets critical mass can exponentially grow. It will be the one who survives in this kind of business models. And it's kind of fascinating how three industries converge. And from a financial fintech perspective, I would say they have a complete disadvantage in dominating this transaction because they don't have assets, they don't have experience in the physical world. And for that reason, something to really increase further pressure on the banks. Here's our working prototype. If you are kind of aware of, if you know the slocket people here, you see Simon Gench, then a colleague of mine, and they basically installed the first working electric vehicle charging prototype on Ethereum in our office.
00:10:58.554 - 00:11:40.678, Speaker A: And basically you can check this out. If you go to ether scan, you basically see the transaction happening on the Ethereum blockchain. And this is what we really like because we would like to bring in the physical world. And also, of course, regarding the USPY blockchain for electric vehicle charging, we are extremely sure we will increase the end user experience. Today's end user experience is total crap. You have to fiddle around with a lot of cards. You have to do roaming, then roaming doesn't work.
00:11:40.678 - 00:12:00.714, Speaker A: You have to find the right charging pole. It's completely expensive. It's just crap. And we think with blockchain we can deliver a high quality user experience, especially when it comes to inductive charging for cars. We do it contract less. Today you need contracts to do your charging. You have all the customer data in the back end system.
00:12:00.714 - 00:12:53.162, Speaker A: You can do movement profiles, all the evil things. And with contract less soydenum or anonym transactions, you can get rid of this, of course, with soyonimity, if you do some analytics, big chain blockchain analytics, you can try to kind of link it to a real individual. However, we are kind of thinking to fix the gap, to get rid of the soil anonymity and get more anonymity in place to avoid any movement tracking. It's fully automated, especially when it comes to autonomous vehicles. And we have autonomous vehicles can be automate. Charging will be done in automated way. And of course, when we have kind of a link to the autonomous vehicles, they transport people, they transport goods, and then we are also talking about logistics.
00:12:53.162 - 00:13:28.146, Speaker A: And that's the reason why it's very nice to do blockcharge, significant reduction of system costs. I didn't believe it either. I'm an IT professional. But when I looked, and RWE is market leader in Europe and Germany in terms of backend systems for billing and authentication. And if you look in the system landscape, it's a huge legacy landscape. And basically our blockchart combining of the physical financial transactions, the blockchain. So we get rid out of huge legacy systems, so we can reduce system costs quite dramatically.
00:13:28.146 - 00:14:12.342, Speaker A: And we are also very sure to reduce costs of electric components in a car, in a charging pole, which is very nice in the end, security of the energy and financial transactions via deposits. So you get your escrows free of charge, which is nice. And other advantage of technology. It supports all kinds of charging. You can do private charging at your home with your 230 volts standard plug, or you can even do Tesla superchargers speeding up to 150 kw in the near future. And even Tesla is kind of considering to share their charging infrastructure, their supercharging infrastructure building up. Unfortunately, they don't have yet a billing system.
00:14:12.342 - 00:14:45.230, Speaker A: And yeah, blockcharge can be one option for them. Customer segments. I would like to introduce this. So we saw seven different types of customer segments, cities, big cities looking for technology leadership. I think they are perfect target customers to deploy this technology. Already now, grid operators and utilities operating charging infrastructure. Automotive om such as Tesla or car fleet operators setting up own infrastructure.
00:14:45.230 - 00:15:20.838, Speaker A: I think it's pretty straightforward. So when we did all our design thinking insights, we also looked into employers. In some european countries, employers are obliged to charge their employees when they charge on their premises because of tax, legal reasons. And if they have to charge their employees, or at least to pay tax distribution, they need a solution. And this can be done with blockcharge in a very simple way. Large industrial manufacturer. You can imagine there are large manufacturing plants and third parties with electric forklifters.
00:15:20.838 - 00:15:52.550, Speaker A: And yeah, the owner of the manufacturing plants wants to charge their third parties. This can be done here as well. Small medium enterprises and last but not least, private households. Basically what we're doing right now bring it to a physical world in Berlin. And in Berlin we would like to build a front shop window, blockchain and physical world. Basically we can use the Berlin implementation to sell to further cities. And that's our target customers for the first phase.
00:15:52.550 - 00:16:23.310, Speaker A: Berlin. Yeah, that's a campus network in Berlin. So there we are planning to deploy our solution. They have 40 charging points, and when we deploy our solution, it will include 20 to 60 electric vehicles and have access to a fleet of 400 vehicles. So if this is successful, we can even further scale it to demonstrate it's working in the real world. Inductive charging. We also have access to inductive charging.
00:16:23.310 - 00:17:08.138, Speaker A: Christophe Yench was on the World Economic Forum for Urban Mobility last week, and one of the key topics was inductive charging. To do it high power, super fast, front of traffic lights everywhere. And that's where even on the World Economic Forum last week was discussed. Use blockchain for micropayments, which gives us a lot of momentum support to drive this forward. Our implementation approach is basically we use design thinking, customer experience design, to make sure we don't forget the customer. When we do this in Berlin, we get a lot of technology, process and operations insights. So how to do the process, how to operate a blockchain in this kind of environment.
00:17:08.138 - 00:17:48.538, Speaker A: So we'll focus a lot of user experience insights. So we have a mobility expert team in terms of user experience and insights, and we'll engage this from day one for communicating with this users in a proper way. Because in the end, it's a completely psychological change for people when they start using a cryptocurrency for interactions in the real world. People have not done it before psychological change. And for that reason, we would like to do it properly. And when the solution is in place, we would like to get all the kind of end user experience to further develop our value proposition. Market regulatory commercials, pretty clear.
00:17:48.538 - 00:18:30.342, Speaker A: And deployment insights. And that's kind of the final conclusion. When we deploy it, you can easily deploy it greenfield when you build new infrastructure, however. So we have a lot of thoughts invested also with brownfield to migrate completely existing infrastructure, thousands of charging poles on a short term. And that's how you would like to gain momentum after we've done the real life test in berlin to further scale the. Yeah, blockcharge, future of electricity, of electrified mobility. That's our long term vision.
00:18:30.342 - 00:18:49.040, Speaker A: And this goes, then, beyond charging. And the last slide is, yeah, please engage with us in terms of peer to peer networks, blockchain in a broader sense, IoT and physical delivery, because you would like to drive the movement forward to bring blockchain in the physical, in the real world. Thank you.
00:18:56.870 - 00:19:02.500, Speaker B: Thank you very much. Carsten. Some questions will start right here.
00:19:03.190 - 00:19:03.986, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:19:04.088 - 00:19:08.050, Speaker A: I think we have a question. Over there. Over there. Sorry.
00:19:08.120 - 00:19:08.738, Speaker C: Hi.
00:19:08.904 - 00:19:09.942, Speaker A: We hang the light.
00:19:09.996 - 00:20:01.670, Speaker C: Can I go with a slightly provocative question? You're an energy giant, a big corporation. Whenever I worked for corporations, I never managed to pull off like one line of creative innovation. Honestly, it was always like three managers up, three managers down. Six continents away, six months of test scheduling. You are extremely progressive for someone from a corporation. How can you sell your vision for the business? Because they might be aware that this is on the biggest picture, kind of detrimental to old, big monopolistic participants in this field, I think. So how do you see your company's future?
00:20:01.820 - 00:20:42.894, Speaker A: I think this goes back to the strategy of our CEO. Because our CEO first said, we have to restructure our business to reduce costs with brute force. And we did it and we are still doing it. Second, we have to change the mindset and the dna of the whole company because we had two systemic issues and the issues were hierarchy and silo thinking in RBE. And third, we have to kick off innovation. And innovation is now further pushing forward the mental and the mindset and dna change in RBE. What we basically did, we have a very nice entity called RB consulting.
00:20:42.894 - 00:21:21.306, Speaker A: And they basically got a rid out of all corporate processes. They said, no, we don't want to be part of the corporate world. And this is fantastic because with arbitrary consulting, they're very professionals and we have a small medium enterprise platform to do business process on it in terms of procurement, hiring, marketing, sales, communication. Very nice. So we have this very small medium enterprise like platform, RBE consulting. And then RBE decided to put innovation on top of it. And we hired, we ramped up a team with internal external resources.
00:21:21.306 - 00:21:40.520, Speaker A: Within one and a half years, it grew from two to more than 100 people. And this is more or less fully taking out of the corporate environment in terms of processes. But when it comes to assets, we go into the corporate environment, tax assets, leverage them, put something on top, innovate. That's what and how we do it.
00:21:43.370 - 00:21:48.840, Speaker B: Great answer. Thank you. Next question. Right at the back.
00:21:56.270 - 00:22:20.930, Speaker D: If you're talking about real life use cases and you're thinking about the customer, that point that you were saying, that is a real sort of paradigm change to get people using cryptocurrencies. I mean, is it the fact that everybody has to have ether to actually participate in the network, or can they just use normal cash that then gets transferred?
00:22:21.670 - 00:22:54.430, Speaker A: So we basically have a couple of monetization potentials, and one monetization potential is to migrate customers from the real world. In the crypto blockchain world. And in the beginning of this journey, people have to use fiat currencies. We have to bring them via fiat currencies on the blockchain with a wallet. And of course make sure we do all the hedging that the customer does not have any issues with volatility. I think that's a short term strategy. People use euro, see euro and all the ether transactions are under the hood.
00:22:54.430 - 00:23:18.594, Speaker A: But of course, long term, we would like to put people with their wallets on the blockchain. What is very nice. So, RW, we have our trading business. It's a world class trading business. We even have a little banking license. And in theory, in theory we could do a lot of with it. But we start with fiat currencies.
00:23:18.594 - 00:23:21.330, Speaker A: Then we have extreme users probably using bitcoin, ether.
00:23:21.410 - 00:23:27.320, Speaker B: But very few more questions over here.
00:23:29.790 - 00:24:13.240, Speaker A: Following on from the first question, really, you seem very progressive. Do you have any plans on becoming a DAO? Yes. So in our strategy, we have strategy to set up cooperative businesses either for ourselves in the physical world, the whole RWE, I think probably parts of the business models might be a Dao. And if you put this all thinking all to an extreme, then you can end up as a crypto RWE, you can think about our assets, assets backing a cryptocurrency, and then you can experience a lot of business models. But we are not yet there.
00:24:18.170 - 00:24:48.014, Speaker E: With all the infrastructure you have in place, are you looking at potentially working with a smart grid and working, say, around surges? I don't know what's the situation in Germany, but I guess it's similar to here because of the renewables coming in. There are a time surges when the gas power plants get fired, and that can be very expensive. So are you looking at a way to reward some of the consumers for reducing their consumption in a peer to peer setup?
00:24:48.142 - 00:25:29.022, Speaker A: Yeah. So the energy business, a lot of about reducing consumption, load shifting, peak shaving. So we have done a lot of these experiments in the smart grid, without blockchain, of course. And our experience are kind of mixed. Do customers really care? Do they trust the energy provider? That's one of the insights. Basically we offer dynamic pricing and tell the customer, turn on, turn off the washing machine, and they say, oh wow, are they screwing us or not? I don't understand this. Do I care? And then there was a study that people cared at the beginning and they had the energy savings and after a while they didn't follow it properly up.
00:25:29.022 - 00:25:38.690, Speaker A: So my personal view is if it can be automated, it will be done if there are manual interactions. It's a little bit difficult. We're not yet there with all the automation.
00:25:39.750 - 00:25:50.368, Speaker B: Carson, can you talk more about corporate? What do you intend to do with corporate?
00:25:50.564 - 00:26:51.120, Speaker A: Yeah, basically a couple of things going beyond utility needs, sector knowledge and assets that we probably don't have in every kind of sector. We have a lot of these assets because we have subsidiaries, needs market access, needs global scale. So when we talk about zero marginal economy sharing and all kind of things, then we need global scale, we need some partners. Our footprint is based in Europe with the exception of trading. And of course corporates, they are nice synergies because we have a lot of identities. When we would like secured identities, when we would like to bring secure identities on the blockchain with crypto wallets, we can do this. But merging a couple of cooperatives and we have hundred million of secured identity on the blockchain, this will probably help the whole ecosystem because then even startups and all kind of people can trust an identity on the blockchain and can build on top of this nice business model.
00:26:51.120 - 00:26:56.000, Speaker A: And that's something what corporates could do in theory if they merge and bring this on blockchain.
00:26:57.780 - 00:26:59.730, Speaker B: We have a question at the back.
00:27:03.380 - 00:27:03.840, Speaker A: Thanks.
00:27:03.910 - 00:27:11.220, Speaker F: Am I right in thinking that in Germany you're the network operator, right? As in you own the cables and the substations and whatnot.
00:27:12.120 - 00:27:14.388, Speaker A: So what does RBE own and do?
00:27:14.474 - 00:27:25.412, Speaker F: Yeah. So in Germany you're the equipment to a network operator in the UK. So have you given any thought to putting any blockchain technologies on your substations and feeders and that kind of thing, or has that not been considered?
00:27:25.556 - 00:27:57.940, Speaker A: Yes, there's one example. For example, you can put a battery in a substation and then share it among the people that are behind the substation, for example. And as another example is looking into assets, let's say renewable assets, to bring their meter data, scalar data on the blockchain and do something similar. What Paul is doing, share the data, do predictive maintenance, performance optimization, balance group accounting, and this can be done with all this kind of assets in theory.
00:27:58.440 - 00:28:09.690, Speaker F: And lastly, just to follow on from the person at the front, do you think there's no case for time of use tariffs in the future? Do you think they're dead completely, or do you think there is a case for time of use tariffs and demand response and that kind of thing?
00:28:11.100 - 00:28:41.760, Speaker A: Yes, I think so. There will be a case because with all the renewables they are adding a lot of volatility and you can kind of try to manage the volatility by this type of tariffs. Yeah, absolutely. And one of the things, even in this block charge, so we expect, and people are already doing this to send pricing signals to the charging poles, the cars behave properly or also kind of feed in energy to the grid or take it out of the grid and this kind of dynamic tariff.
00:28:42.580 - 00:28:49.030, Speaker F: Sorry. So you're expecting to see a price per kilowatt hour displayed to the user for charging their car. Is that fair?
00:28:50.120 - 00:29:00.280, Speaker A: I think then we have manual interaction. I will probably assume that the car negotiates it and does whatever is the best benefit of the car based on fully automated algorithms.
00:29:03.180 - 00:29:11.820, Speaker B: Okay, we're going to take last question now, I'm afraid, and then we're going to move relatively swiftly thereafter onto the last presentation.
00:29:12.880 - 00:29:19.340, Speaker G: Short question, tricky question. So how much gas does it cost to execute a smart contract?
00:29:21.700 - 00:29:30.752, Speaker A: There was a talk from Andrew Miller. He looked into this executing smart context of gas and how does a gas price evolve? I forgot it.
00:29:30.886 - 00:29:41.010, Speaker G: So it's a tricky question because do you want the customer to pay for the gas or how do you want to make it work? Basically.
00:29:44.700 - 00:29:53.670, Speaker A: Someone has to pay for the gas. Could be the owner of the utility charging pole or the customer depends. Future will show it.
