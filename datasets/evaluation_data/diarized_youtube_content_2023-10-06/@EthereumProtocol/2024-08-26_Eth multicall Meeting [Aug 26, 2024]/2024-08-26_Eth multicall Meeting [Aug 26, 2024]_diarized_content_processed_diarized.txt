00:00:02.360 - 00:00:03.068, Speaker A: Hey, guys.
00:00:04.510 - 00:00:15.770, Speaker B: I see no. Yeah. Okay. Clarion Cena are a similar volume. Oleg is the odd man out. Sorry. The rest of us could probably do updates while Oleg figures out his mic.
00:00:18.910 - 00:00:38.620, Speaker A: Yep, sure. Not a lot from my site. Actually, I think I'm just waiting for the results, seeing if we can get the consistent hashes. I think Hilary probably remembers better what happened there.
00:00:40.360 - 00:01:17.240, Speaker C: Yeah, the current, the nether model gets, seems to produce very similar results. There's a couple of cases that Oleg is aware of. Like for example, when contact has destroyed Netherwinder said eat log for that. And then there was one other difference. And then there's the block hashes and a timestamp and block size are something that are still differing everywhere. And those need to be fixed. But I haven't started figuring or looking that closely into those yet because the timestamp is clear difference at the still that needs to be fixed.
00:01:18.100 - 00:01:37.640, Speaker D: All right. So yeah, last week we found out that there is no difference in block numbers, but there is difference in timestamps. And we are currently investigating that. And the issue in our understanding is that it is only for the first block. Right, Clary?
00:01:40.660 - 00:01:51.480, Speaker C: Yeah, I think so. Yeah. But the interesting thing is sometimes it raises the right times, but it doesn't. And I couldn't figure out what is the reason for that.
00:01:51.980 - 00:01:57.356, Speaker D: And when you specified the block numbers, the times were still different here.
00:01:57.548 - 00:01:58.360, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:01:59.300 - 00:02:04.440, Speaker D: And when you specified time overrides, did anything change?
00:02:06.340 - 00:02:15.680, Speaker C: It seems to work. When you specify the timestamp, it's always. And it doesn't work before you specify the timestamp. But after specify the timestamp, it seems to work.
00:02:16.830 - 00:02:21.610, Speaker D: And do the hashes get equal when you specify the timestamp?
00:02:22.870 - 00:02:27.050, Speaker C: No, because they depend on their parent. And then I cannot get their parents too much.
00:02:28.670 - 00:02:33.930, Speaker D: And if you specify both the timestamp and parent number would help.
00:02:35.110 - 00:02:42.650, Speaker C: You cannot specify them. You mean you are setting the. I haven't, I don't have that kind of test case.
00:02:43.970 - 00:03:09.934, Speaker D: Yeah. All right. Yeah. And from our side. So we're currently looking at why the numbers are different. Probably I'll have to run five some more because it is really strange for me as the code logic is quite stain and quite easy there. So it shall be parent times time plus one for every case when the time stamp is not specified.
00:03:09.934 - 00:03:14.158, Speaker D: But for Killari, it is plus 12 seconds in my understanding.
00:03:14.334 - 00:03:23.670, Speaker C: So yeah, for some cases, but they are not always. That's why it's a bit weirdo. It's how sometimes it's 12 seconds and sometimes 1 second yes.
00:03:23.750 - 00:03:33.050, Speaker D: So it's quite, quite a strange difference. Is it on Hive always or it is also on Hive like.
00:03:36.700 - 00:03:39.520, Speaker C: It'S in hibernate, the mainnet test as well.
00:03:40.940 - 00:03:50.440, Speaker D: Yeah. All right. Yes. So we're looking at that. And also I had to say that I'll be off for the vacation for the next week.
00:03:52.700 - 00:03:55.680, Speaker B: Yeah, you said next week or next two weeks?
00:03:56.740 - 00:03:59.080, Speaker D: The week after this one.
00:03:59.820 - 00:04:02.680, Speaker B: Okay. You'll be here this week and you'll be out all next week.
00:04:03.040 - 00:04:06.340, Speaker D: Yeah. So I'll do progress async next Monday.
00:04:06.760 - 00:04:07.620, Speaker B: Okay.
00:04:11.320 - 00:04:19.660, Speaker D: And Sina, I remember you had a nice discussion in the chat room. Could you reintegrate for the group?
00:04:22.360 - 00:04:25.340, Speaker A: Uh, first I would have to remember.
00:04:27.200 - 00:04:29.060, Speaker C: Is that the override stop?
00:04:31.000 - 00:04:32.140, Speaker D: Yeah, probably.
00:04:35.880 - 00:04:43.140, Speaker B: Was this related to the move to things? And we discussed that one last week though, right? Or is there a new topic?
00:04:46.200 - 00:04:50.616, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we discussed it last week already. It's what we discussed.
00:04:50.808 - 00:04:52.000, Speaker D: Oh, yeah. Perfect.
00:04:52.080 - 00:04:54.220, Speaker A: I don't think there was anything new last week.
00:04:56.870 - 00:04:59.250, Speaker D: All right. And let's.
00:05:00.990 - 00:05:05.370, Speaker B: Did we resolve the potential difference in the extra data field.
00:05:09.030 - 00:05:13.134, Speaker C: Or it's empty. So.
00:05:13.182 - 00:05:14.170, Speaker B: Okay, that's all.
00:05:16.830 - 00:05:42.128, Speaker C: And that's returned. So I can see it. The difference is that the timestamp and the block size the transaction has, its also doesn't match unless I leave the transactions out. Then when they're empty, that it matches. Yeah, but the empty transaction doesn't explain all the transaction difference or the other.
00:05:42.224 - 00:05:50.660, Speaker D: Has differences either in the cases when you've seen that the timestamps are correct or there were none such cases.
00:05:53.440 - 00:05:58.020, Speaker C: I don't think I have such case where I would get everything matching.
00:05:59.200 - 00:06:21.994, Speaker D: Yeah. All right, thank you. All right, let's welcome mercy. Hello, mercy. Welcome to the group. Could you say a few words about yourself? Yeah, probably just observing.
00:06:22.042 - 00:06:32.830, Speaker C: All right, I guess we don't have anything else for now. Yep.
00:06:33.130 - 00:06:40.470, Speaker D: I'll ping you on telegram when I'll update the branch with the timestamp issue.
00:06:41.180 - 00:06:47.332, Speaker C: And are you aware of it, what is causing it, or still you have to debug it for still?
00:06:47.396 - 00:06:54.280, Speaker D: No, I'll have to debug it and maybe even look into how we compare to geth in that regards.
00:06:57.620 - 00:07:02.520, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay. Talk to you later.
00:07:03.660 - 00:07:06.396, Speaker D: Yeah. Thank you all. See you later.
00:07:06.508 - 00:07:07.200, Speaker C: Bye.
