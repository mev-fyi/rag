00:00:07.080 - 00:00:08.190, Speaker A: You are getting better.
00:00:08.640 - 00:01:16.880, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm getting better, but I had been sick for a few days, so I haven't yet pushed the updated docker image. And we'll push it tonight, I think so. The main difference would be the logs that would have the individual transfers when the option is selected. Other things that Killare posted to me, like in peer to peer fashion. So Kilari, could you take a look at the Trello board so that I would know that some of the bugs that I marked as really done or there are some stuff I still need to fix. And the last but not least, how was the node running for you guys? Any problems or. It was all fine and dandy.
00:01:18.420 - 00:01:27.670, Speaker A: I haven't found any issues with it except those e logs are missing. But other than that, I haven't found anything to report. So it has been working very well.
00:01:28.120 - 00:01:36.190, Speaker B: Perfect. Thank you. Have you got the ability to test the blobs?
00:01:37.650 - 00:01:46.370, Speaker A: No, I haven't done that yet. Sinov was supposed to provide me some way to test it, but I guess he has been busy.
00:01:48.870 - 00:01:53.060, Speaker C: Yeah, sorry, what was I supposed to do?
00:01:55.270 - 00:02:17.644, Speaker A: There was some discussion about when is the e RPC moved to the new fork or to do then I was thinking that's the easiest way to test it if the project is mode to the new update, and then I can just update to that. Yeah.
00:02:17.682 - 00:02:26.130, Speaker C: So basically we wanted to test what happens if we switch all the hive tests to cancom, right?
00:02:26.580 - 00:02:32.690, Speaker A: Yeah, I would imagine that's something that needs to be done anyway.
00:02:33.620 - 00:02:36.690, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess so. I guess so.
00:02:37.220 - 00:02:49.030, Speaker A: And I would imagine that those aren't those being run with the cancun anyway. I don't know if the RPC methods have been tested with the cancun or if people have been assumed that they just.
00:02:52.520 - 00:02:59.610, Speaker C: Mean there shouldn't be much of a difference anyway. But it's good to flip it. Yeah, I agree.
00:03:03.820 - 00:03:07.230, Speaker A: Can we reach out to the project for that and ask about it?
00:03:07.600 - 00:03:09.950, Speaker C: Yeah. Nice.
00:03:12.080 - 00:03:22.640, Speaker A: But I guess gen generators RPC tests are done so that every node are testing themselves and test node. That kind of like one way to test them all except the test RPC.
00:03:28.280 - 00:03:40.420, Speaker C: Last week we also discussed something else that now I remember. I had to take a look. It was about Validation.
00:03:44.330 - 00:03:45.880, Speaker B: I don't remember now.
00:03:47.210 - 00:03:51.590, Speaker C: There was a question from Oleg.
00:03:53.010 - 00:03:53.760, Speaker D: It.
00:03:58.370 - 00:04:05.150, Speaker A: I think these are recorded and then there's some text scrumptious somewhere, but I don't know where they are, where they exist.
00:04:07.430 - 00:04:13.330, Speaker C: At some point I was getting emails about it, but then since we moved to zoom, then not anymore.
00:04:20.230 - 00:04:25.030, Speaker B: Yeah, I sadly don't remember exactly as I had too many drugs.
00:04:27.530 - 00:04:38.680, Speaker C: Sounds good. Well, I think it was about validating gas price. Well.
00:04:42.490 - 00:04:52.270, Speaker A: What is that? That when the gas price is missing, then what is the assumed value? And then we decide that we just keep it zero. So if you have the validation mode, then it will just fail.
00:04:54.210 - 00:05:04.770, Speaker C: And then we also talked about baseb. I guess it's better if I just take a look at the notes.
00:05:05.750 - 00:05:28.586, Speaker A: If you can find the notes and share them as well. I don't know how well they work. If they are trained to understand ethereum talk or it's just general notes. Well, I guess we don't have anything else.
00:05:28.768 - 00:05:32.090, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess we should ask Tim about the notes.
00:05:33.710 - 00:05:34.460, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:37.730 - 00:05:38.960, Speaker C: I don't have anything.
00:05:39.490 - 00:05:43.070, Speaker E: You mean the ones that are allegedly auto recorded and saved?
00:05:46.930 - 00:05:47.680, Speaker A: Tim?
00:05:48.530 - 00:05:57.650, Speaker E: Tim would probably be the right person. Alternatively, the cat herders discord server. If any of you guys are in there, I think they're the ones who actually manage this stream.
00:05:58.950 - 00:05:59.700, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:05.350 - 00:06:18.600, Speaker A: Oleg, how far do you think we are in getting that to mainnet? So that. Has someone been reviewing your code at the same time so that it's kind of like most of it's reviewed already?
00:06:19.770 - 00:06:40.750, Speaker B: Yeah, it was reviewed once by Lukash, and currently he's doing the second path. So we'll do the fixes after his review and we'll need one more reviewer. And I think after that we'll be mergeable.
00:06:42.290 - 00:06:48.260, Speaker A: Have you look at those block hashes yet? Do we match on those yet?
00:06:48.870 - 00:06:50.660, Speaker B: Not yet. Sadly not.
00:06:52.390 - 00:06:57.800, Speaker A: Are there many other things that there's differences between get and nettermind at the moment?
00:06:58.650 - 00:07:17.210, Speaker B: No, it doesn't look like there is anything but the stuff that we can assume will be kept different? I think so. It's basically mostly about when we merge it to the main trunk.
00:07:17.950 - 00:07:33.022, Speaker A: But what are something that we agree that there's different in the validation mode? I think there'll be differences, but I think with the hashes, I think they should be matching. If they are not matching, then I think we should understand why they are not matching and then discuss about those.
00:07:33.156 - 00:07:34.720, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with that.
00:07:35.890 - 00:07:49.640, Speaker A: There can be something that we don't really care about, but I think those hashes are also very good test to check that things are working as we assume. But of course they can be a bit harder to debug. But it'd be nice to understand why they are different.
00:07:50.010 - 00:07:56.166, Speaker B: Yeah, I will look this week at that and debug why we have different.
00:07:56.268 - 00:07:57.110, Speaker C: Hashes.
00:07:59.050 - 00:08:14.400, Speaker A: But they are first probably should get the output to match exactly. And then if everything matches except the hashes, then figure out what's wrong with there. I guess there can be some precedes or something that we are not showing that can be different.
00:08:20.300 - 00:08:22.010, Speaker B: Yeah, we'll look into it.
00:08:22.620 - 00:08:33.740, Speaker C: Yeah, I think once everything else is resolved, maybe me and Ole can have a session where we just dump the blocks and compare.
00:08:39.380 - 00:08:51.190, Speaker D: Try to figure out this is the state route or this is receipt route or transaction route or anything else. Right. That's the first step. And then go from there.
00:08:53.500 - 00:09:24.130, Speaker B: The second thing would be the root modification on the desire of users. So when we get a new update to the block passed to us, the ordering might be important. The way we commit updates to the state when we are given a set of updates that are required from us.
00:09:26.420 - 00:09:30.160, Speaker A: What update? You mean that when we are replacing balance?
00:09:31.060 - 00:09:37.232, Speaker B: Yeah, when you replace the balance or added, it shouldn't really make a difference.
00:09:37.286 - 00:09:40.070, Speaker D: The state should be the same regardless of the order.
00:09:41.400 - 00:09:42.150, Speaker B: Nice.
00:09:43.960 - 00:09:51.880, Speaker A: I guess there's only the difference that those should be set before the transactions are being executed. And I would imagine that's case for the board of the nodes.
00:09:52.380 - 00:09:53.130, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:09:58.770 - 00:10:02.100, Speaker A: Has Lucas had time to look at the validation stuff?
00:10:04.550 - 00:10:11.620, Speaker D: Nothing more than what we discussed previously. So that was the main one, probably.
00:10:13.990 - 00:10:21.590, Speaker C: Sorry, Lukash. Do you remember what was the question? Because I remember there was something that I had to look up, but I forgot.
00:10:28.270 - 00:10:40.560, Speaker D: We were discussing the lack of gas and you were saying that you're setting gas price to zero. That's what I remember, yes.
00:10:45.810 - 00:11:02.744, Speaker C: After that. Yeah, I'm trying to join the cat herders discord. Somehow I'm not managing. If somebody's in there and can invite me, that would be nice.
00:11:02.942 - 00:11:09.996, Speaker E: Yeah, I can send you an invite. Also, I just asked Pooja if she knows. I don't know when she'll see it, but okay.
00:11:10.098 - 00:11:10.828, Speaker C: Yeah, awesome.
00:11:10.914 - 00:11:26.510, Speaker E: I'll give you an invite as well. I just pasted an invite link in chat in this zoom room.
00:11:32.030 - 00:11:57.290, Speaker A: Do we anything else? I guess somebody can take a ball with that and look at the locks when we get them and then kind of ask the question again on the chat. I guess we are done for today.
00:12:00.780 - 00:12:01.468, Speaker D: Bye.
00:12:01.604 - 00:12:03.232, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks, guys.
00:12:03.366 - 00:12:04.112, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:12:04.246 - 00:12:04.928, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:12:05.014 - 00:12:05.324, Speaker C: Bye.
00:12:05.372 - 00:12:06.290, Speaker E: Thanks, everyone.
