00:00:22.090 - 00:00:44.358, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you for the organizers. Really impressive event. So, okay, so we are not going to talk about Java implementation. We was talking about core yesterday. Maybe I want to start with a little bit statistics, because I think we didn't talk about this yet. And we started the live network of Ethereum end of July.
00:00:44.358 - 00:01:30.490, Speaker A: Right? And since there we've seen almost 500 transactions at 500,000 transactions on the network, wire transactions. We've seen almost 23,000 sacktive addresses around this traffic. Those are some value transactions. Not all of them are foundation, but those are the most valuable transactions on the network. Contracts, smart contracts. We see almost 4500 smart contracts already on the network. And yeah, this is quite interesting because we didn't see 35,000 startups around this, but they're there.
00:01:30.490 - 00:02:10.178, Speaker A: People are working on something. We see almost 26,000 invocations on these contracts. Contracts are calling and are interconnected. They are calling to themselves, they have some connection between them. And this is also interesting statistics. So this is like more than 44,000 intercontract calls already. And the addresses, the ethereum addresses, which are people basically that deal with these contracts, they are doing only contracts or focusing on contracts.
00:02:10.178 - 00:02:52.114, Speaker A: This is the number 32,000 unique addresses. And this is also, you can compare to the previous, this is the value that contract moved between them. So if you are talking about value of wire transactions, this is the value of contract moving ether between themselves. And this also give you kind of understanding, like people trust contracts to do value for them. This is also quite interesting. This is the sum of all ether that was moved in the network. And I'm not talking about any exchanges or trading, I'm just talking about value moving from account to account.
00:02:52.114 - 00:03:37.314, Speaker A: It does not have b, trading the fees, fees. Also interesting statistics, 1.1 million ether miners got for these transactions. And 36% of this is around contracts. It's 404,000 ether paying for, invoking, creating, storing data in the contracts. So why I'm showing you these statistics? First news that I study from these numbers is that probably we are not on Facebook numbers yet, right? We don't have a billion users yet. But there are also good news.
00:03:37.314 - 00:04:54.662, Speaker A: Our community in major includes people that are very smart programmers, and they are focused more on programming contracts than just speculating on the value, like maybe other cryptocurrencies. And these are pretty interesting news. And by the way, all the numbers are from our block explorer, which is the frontier, Ethercamp. This is the online analytic tools for Ethereum network, which we use to collect all the stats and the second news that I can tell you is that these people are spread all over the globe. And how I know this because we also track Google Analytics on this block explorer. And this is the chart from last two and a half months from the start of the network. You don't see the numbers, but you definitely see that in each point on the planet where people know something about software, somebody doing already Ethereum.
00:04:54.662 - 00:06:23.618, Speaker A: So those are also good news. And I've been thinking with myself, like, if you're taking this idea of smart people moving to one direction to develop software, which is revolutionary and want to change everything, and then you see also a bunch of finance people looking to invest into them, and you take this concept 20 years ago, like what you got? So I think we can be proud that we already decentralized the concept of Silicon Valley. Like this is the complete pattern that we've seen 20 years ago, right? People was doing the same, but this time you just move virtually because you don't need to leave your house. You can just stay at the house and start your startup and be successful and go online. And Ethereum, in Ethereum world, we kind of see it the most because of the idea of Ethereum. And we have been seeing this pattern from the beginning of Ethereum, when a bunch of people from different places in the world got together and started prototyping, started doing pocs, starting study. And this is why in Ethercam we decided to focus on these people, on the people of the community, on the developers.
00:06:23.618 - 00:07:11.320, Speaker A: And our main focus is to make development of smart contracts, these smart, decentralized applications, easy. And for that we developed the IDE. I have the slide here. I also have the demo in a second. But before I show the demo, I have to say we did a long way. We've been visiting some hackathons when people go together and trying to develop something and we study, we are looking behind the shoulder and study what is the intuition? Because all this paradigm of programming, transactional programming, is very new. So we changed this like a couple of times already because we wanted to adapt the id for the rights, for the needs of the people.
00:07:11.320 - 00:07:36.894, Speaker A: And I want to show it to you. The network wasn't so good. So I did a screencast yesterday. So it's an online, right? It's a web id. So I can show you online and the link is there, but I will show you screencast because like I did it yesterday, I don't want to rely on the network. Let's see. Okay, so the video will work for me.
00:07:36.894 - 00:08:18.406, Speaker A: We had some problem before let's see if it will work for me. Okay, looks good. Okay, so this is basically the id, you just browse through there. And the first important feature that we have, you have authentication. So if you want to, you can show, you can give the link to anybody and people can go there in read only mode and they can study your code, maybe give you some help. And you should not be worried that they will change or damage this. This is the first 2nd we study that we need a very easy configuration for the blockchain.
00:08:18.406 - 00:08:55.670, Speaker A: And basically when you're developing something on Ethereum, you want the way to test the software and you want a good way to change the pre configured blockchain. And we have just one JSON file. In this file you can set up all the accounts and the value and maybe the storage they have, maybe the code. So you have all the options to set up good environment even before you're starting to develop a single contract. And it's very flexible. If you want to stop and change again, you also can do it. Okay, let's see how it does.
00:08:55.670 - 00:09:25.622, Speaker A: Okay, looks good. Let's move forward. Yeah. Okay, so now we are ready. We have this configuration, we have pre configured, let's say genesis, right? Because it's not really genesis. Let's start the blockchain. And we took the implementation of ethereum, the full implementation and completely included into the id, into the box.
00:09:25.622 - 00:09:58.110, Speaker A: So you can do whatever you want with this id, with this ethereum in the box. The basic idea is that you can prototype really fast. So you just need to run. And you have on the right panel, you have all these accounts that you predefined already preloaded into the blockchain even before you started, right? The exactly same. And you can see them, you can see them and see that everything is okay. Right. The last one is the one we just added.
00:09:58.110 - 00:10:34.000, Speaker A: And you can see that the balance is zero. So we also coded some usual way to manipulate the blockchain. Any way that will going to be convenient for you. So you can also do a regular transaction, just move value between accounts and you can just move value and record these transactions for any reason you want to. This is also included into this box, into this id. Right. Okay.
00:10:34.000 - 00:11:09.640, Speaker A: And after we setting this, we want to start and do some contract development. So we support solidity, completely solidity language. And I will show to you this smart contract in the demo. Basically it's a banking application. You have creditors and debitors and people looking to give money and to get money and application matching between them. So it's very hard to explain code in the mode of presentation, but you can see the data structure and kind of have understanding. What is this about, what is the application about? Right.
00:11:09.640 - 00:11:38.690, Speaker A: And this is the implementation, this was the interface, so called interface. And this is the implementation. And now you can see that the contract which was deployed is right there. Right. And while it's right there, you can invoke any method on this. So it's very easy for you to test any of the methods of this smart contract that you coded. And if you add parameters, if you add methods, you will find all of them here.
00:11:38.690 - 00:12:27.240, Speaker A: So let's try to do something. Let's try to invoke the method that called depth or register, just to register a name on this application. Right. Just try to register a name and you also can call this method with any account on the sandbox. So you have all the options, like all the options you have in the real Ethereum world, you have them there? You have them here, yeah. And you can see on the right side that we got the transaction and the sandbox was updated. So this is very simple and very easy way to interact and see how your ethereum in the box is doing.
00:12:27.240 - 00:13:31.936, Speaker A: And now that you can see that you can easily do whatever you want with the smart contract. The next big step for any application developer is to build the UI, right? You want to build the UI, put it out there and show and have your user enjoy your smart contracts. So the point is this, we can have the id of this sandbox and then usual pattern of web3 HTML can be just referred to this sandbox and can be invoked. I will show it to you in a minute. So this is the id, I just updating this id inside the HTML which also developed in this id just the usual pattern of URL provider for the web3 implementation. So I'm referring to this and then because I have also complete SSH complete shell to the Linux that id is running on. So I can start any NPm application.
00:13:31.936 - 00:14:09.788, Speaker A: So I can start the HTP server. Yeah, okay. And after it started I basically change in the port and I can have the application, I can have my HTML tested against my sandbox already. Right? So this is the HTML very simple. And now I will show to you how you can from HTML manipulate this sandbox the exact same way this HTML is going to manipulate Ethereum when it's going to be live. Right? So this is the sandbox that we started. We didn't do anything with him.
00:14:09.788 - 00:15:07.810, Speaker A: Here it is one account there and now I will change everything from the HTML. So here it is. Okay, let's put it on the side so you'll see that we are not cheating here. Okay, so now I was registered the debtor, now I'm registering the creditor. Okay, you see this, right? So also you can concentrate on the application development because we're doing all the connections for you. And just to add more functionality, you have also in this application you have also the ask and beats, you can add them, you can also add them and see how it goes, how it works. Right? So here it is.
00:15:07.810 - 00:16:06.122, Speaker A: This is one example. So the development of such application is not much different from developing a regular database application, which any UI developer already know how to do. Just the difference is you're deploying to the real ethereum network in the sandbox and you don't feel the difference. But after you're done you just want to send the contracts into the real network. And here we have also this functionality. Inside you see all the contracts that you developed. You need to sign it for real because you're doing transaction and you pay ether for this.
00:16:06.122 - 00:16:54.862, Speaker A: So you need to sign it with your account by this peer. The specified we know to which network you want to deploy. This is for example is consensus test network that we also monitor. But you can switch it and go to the production for example and pay realitor or go to the blockups Strato network or whatever. And we're working to integrate more. And then basically you do send, you do send. We already know how much the contract costs because we did it once in the sandbox and here we have the transaction in pending state and it basically will take ten to 20 seconds to mine the transaction by the miner.
00:16:54.862 - 00:18:14.038, Speaker A: And here it will be faster because I cut it out. So after it's mined you can go to the contract and see it on the test network on our block explorer. It's there, you see? So we hope this effortless development will help you to develop contracts and you can study more next because any id requires some hands on. So this is the best that I can show to you like the main features we have and you can study more. Can I have question? No, I don't have time for question. Okay, so I have two more slides I'm finishing. So we was looking for some company to shift this idea with and we found a small shy company Microsoft that doing first steps in the blockchain area and we're really happy and Marley will talk about this more and thanks for consensus and for Andrew doing all the connections and basically we have two products that we want to ship.
00:18:14.038 - 00:18:46.018, Speaker A: One is a private cam. We want everybody to be able to have an id for very good price for hobbyists and maybe for free for a long time. We will sorting it out. This is one, the second one. We call it private campus. And because we have a lot of organization approaching to us and asking for the id. So we are shipping also a server that they can put in the organization with number of predefined ids and they can use these ids inside the organization.
00:18:46.018 - 00:19:48.380, Speaker A: So basically if you're asking all this publication about teaming up with Microsoft, so this is what we are going to do. And they have very strong and large cloud to provide everybody on the planet with the ids. And we really excited with this. So I will go to the last one, I am wrapping up because I really could stop here because everything is here. I can sell the IDE for big organization and sell the license and be happy. But I cannot stop here because of what I said in the beginning, because of this community, because how it's structured, because all the spread on the planet. We was looking to the way to do something more for the community, to do something more for the community and in the way that the community can take the software and communicate their software as fast as possible to everybody.
00:19:48.380 - 00:20:02.894, Speaker A: And we got some concept. I think it's pretty nice. I will show it to you. We call it Hack Eater camp and hack Eatercamp. I'm finishing. This is the last one. This is the last one.
00:20:02.894 - 00:20:31.622, Speaker A: Hack Eater Camp is basically a website for doing hackathons. So we have this web ide and on this website you already can visit this, you can have your team, you can have the id, you can register your team, have a deer. Each link here is the id. And you can start and develop and make a competition. And we are going to start a competition around this. Last word. Last word.
00:20:31.622 - 00:21:03.774, Speaker A: Because we're doing ethereum, because we're doing decentralization. So all these likes you see here, all these kudos that we are going to give. It's all on the blockchain. So people are going to sign their transaction. It's going to be very transparent, very secured, so no cheating is possible here. You can buy some beer to the teams and basically you see somebody already coding here. So we can go to the id and be.
00:21:03.774 - 00:21:08.540, Speaker A: Yeah, this is it. Thank you. Thank you very much.
