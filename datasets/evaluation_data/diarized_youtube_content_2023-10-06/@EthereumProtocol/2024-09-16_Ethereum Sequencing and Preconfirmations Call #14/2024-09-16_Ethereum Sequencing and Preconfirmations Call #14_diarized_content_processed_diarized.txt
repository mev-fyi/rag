00:00:02.520 - 00:00:52.123, Speaker A: Okay, welcome everyone. This is sequencing and pre confirmation call number 14. Today we have Kevin Lepso from Eve Gas who will be talking about pricing pre confirmation tips. So the same subject as the last call and I guess this is the second call in a series. I think we're going to be going down the rabbit hole and have many different speakers talk about this very interesting and somewhat complicated topic. But before Kevin speaks, I want to share my screen real quick. So I want to highlight that we're going to have a sequencing day on November 15th at DEF CON.
00:00:52.123 - 00:01:40.629, Speaker A: It's the very last day of DEFCON, so do feel free to apply. It's completely free. We have an amazing venue at the Hyatt which can accommodate hundreds of people and we're hoping that this is going to be the canonical gathering for many of the roll ups and the companies building around shared sequences and base sequencing. I guess the other thing I wanted to very, very briefly mention is that there's a few more logos on this slide. So one of them is a new base rollup called Facet that is live on Mainnet. I guess that is the second live or maybe the first, I don't know. Base roll up with Tyco.
00:01:40.629 - 00:02:04.615, Speaker A: And there's a few more additional names here as well in the pre conf projects. So I've added ethgas, Interstate and possibly also xga which actually have been around for quite a long time and would overdue to be part of this slide. So that's it from me, Kevin, feel free to go ahead and take it from here.
00:02:06.075 - 00:02:20.935, Speaker B: Sounds good. Thank you. Good evening from Hong Kong. I just realized today is Friday the 13th but I hope nothing that we talk about today is scary. So we'll see how it goes. Let me just pull up my slides here. Give me one moment.
00:02:20.935 - 00:03:05.015, Speaker B: Okay. All right, so on my side I have my deck and I have the chat on the side. If anyone has any side questions as I'm kind of going through this. Alrighty, let's get, get right to it. So I dropped some notes in the, in the chat earlier about you know, I guess two things. One is you know, using, using the volume markets to price gas and separately a bit of background on what we're doing at ETH Gas. And so there's a, there's a lot to unpack but I hope to give a bit more clarity today.
00:03:05.015 - 00:03:55.467, Speaker B: So we'll start first with this concept of Vol and pricing Ethereum blocks. This is more of a, again just like a thought exploration or exercise and what, what I want to highlight is that it's a, it's very different in terms of how one would like conventionally price Ethereum blocks. And so we'll get into the detail shortly. But quick disclaimer, it's a pricing discussion, not a ideological one. You know, I, I shared the, the, the notes on this earlier and it, we quickly went down the rabbit hole, which was fun and interesting, but maybe if we can save the ideolog ideological part till a little bit later. But if you have questions on pricing, feel free to jump in and just ask. So for background, there's two parts to this.
00:03:55.467 - 00:03:57.375, Speaker B: For more information, there's an article.
00:04:01.195 - 00:04:03.579, Speaker A: Sorry about that. I'll make sure to mute people. That's fine.
00:04:03.667 - 00:05:15.765, Speaker B: That's fine. Okay, so there's the article which is on the ETH research site, and then there's also a pricing model attached to the article itself. So if you're wanting to kind of look at that while I'm chatting through it, feel free to kind of bounce through that. The way it starts off is basically, well, looking at Ethereum or the network itself as a financial instrument. And the, the, the context here is that there is a, a latency kind of arbitrage or opportunity in between the prices of pro financial products or between the prices of tokens on centralized destinations versus the prices on Ethereum. And so conceptually, if you were to say, if somehow you were to buy 30 or 60 blocks of Ethereum, for example, then you are afforded, you basically kind of lock the, the last state of, of the chain. You could lock, you don't need to, but you could, in which case you have this window over, you know, 6:12 minutes where effectively you could watch prices in the centralized world and you could just see how those prices evolve versus the price the last state on chain.
00:05:15.765 - 00:06:21.855, Speaker B: And so at some point, if those prices deviate by some threshold, maybe in this case say 4%, then you know, a opportunistic person would basically sell some assets in a centralized world and then they would buy those at the last stated price on Ethereum. And so you know that for that likelihood of a 4% gain or an X percent gain multiplied by the potential volume that I could put through this, that helps to kind of form a basis for quantifying the actual price of blocks. As in like what is the likelihood that I could make a certain amount of money over a certain period of time? And, and so that, that's kind of the discussion again. So likelihood of a certain profit over a certain period of time. Now in, on a real time basis, this is a latency or stat argum. So you know there's a lot of players kind of doing this but what we're looking at again is pricing and pricing is a, is a forward looking indicator. So in this context we need to find forward looking assets or instruments and in this case it's volatility.
00:06:21.855 - 00:07:22.701, Speaker B: So basically we can look at the volume of assets as it relates to what our expectations around token volatility in the next, you know, one day, two day, ideally in the next 12, six 12 minutes. But you know, what are the instruments that we have to what are the forward looking instruments we have in order to price forward looking blocks? So that's why we look at the volume market. So a bit more specifically what we're doing here is the, the trade and again there's more details on the research article but the trade is you would short a straddle or strangle. We're using a strangle just because there's transaction fees that are baked into this be effectively short a strangle on say deribit. Now basically if the price of eth for example in this case if the price of eth moves by some percent then you're going to lose money. Now as you've shorted the strangle you get some premium upfront. So if the price doesn't move you get paid let's just say $10,000.
00:07:22.701 - 00:07:53.841, Speaker B: So I short the strangle, I get paid $10,000. That's my base case. I take that $10,000 and I now buy blocks or pre comps on Ethereum. And so that then basically closes this kind of arbitrage. So I might lose money on the top side, I might gain money on the bottom but that basically kind of closes this, this trade. So it's kind of a closed form trade. And so in this conte, you know make 10,000 from selling that option.
00:07:53.841 - 00:09:18.097, Speaker B: I would be willing to spend up to 10,000 to buy these blocks on, on the Ethereum side. And so that's the trade. So therefore we can basically now use VOL in those markets to price blocks over some period of time on Ethereum. Now so we went ahead and did that and there's, there's a lot to kind of dive into. But at a high level we assumed that you could sell 10 million or the market would bear $10 million of tokens on the option side and liquidity on the, the on, on the Dex side on the Ethereum side you know we look at deribit and we see oh the volume is 75% and interest rates are whatever, you know, we assume some fees and now we can basically plug into your standard black Scholes, you know, what is the price of this strangle in between 1 to 32 blocks? And then that's basically it. So what is the price of a strangle between 1 and 32 blocks? And that will then back out what is the price of the pre confs or what is the price of the blocks for that same period. Now one thing to highlight is that in this exercise there's no concept or awareness really for mev, for other types of MEV for standard deal flow.
00:09:18.097 - 00:09:52.935, Speaker B: You know, in this case I'm not talking about other conventional MEV front running, back running or whatever else it is. I'm not looking at the mempool, I don't need to. And so here on the, on the bottom side where I am long ethereum, again these options offset one another. But on the long side there's actually a positive basis, meaning I'm not ascribing any value to the ethereum side. Therefore this is a floor price or a minimum price for these, for these blocks. Okay, so again anyway, so, so this is the curve that we have. Basically we took into account what are the.
00:09:52.935 - 00:10:59.449, Speaker B: So every like 1 in 10 blocks you kind of get like these solo self built blocks or vanilla blocks and for the rest of the time everyone's using MEV boost. So if you assume that the MEV boost guys are economically rational, as in they want to get paid more, then you know, we assume that what if every time it was possible to sell a block or multiple blocks validators would do so. And so in that case we looked at the frequency of consecutive blocks. We then look at the expected pricing as implied by the volume markets and it comes out to around one and a quarter to 3% in yields for validators, which is that high, is it low? You know we can kind of debate that. But the point is this isn't even factoring in any of the like the order flow mechanics, right? Any of the priorities, fees from order flow, any other other types of mev. This is purely just interplaying the volume markets and the, and kind of the block space market. Now that's the theory part.
00:10:59.449 - 00:11:47.065, Speaker B: There's a bunch of considerations kind of under the hood and you know, we can maybe unpack these here or somewhere else but some of the core dynamics are basically that fees or transaction fees make this difficult. And so if I'm going to you know, sell on Deribit and I'm eventually going to buy on the Dex Is well, what are the transaction fees? Like maybe unis Swap is like 25 basis points. That means I need to factor in the prices on Deribit moving beyond 25 basis points. So I need to factor in fees into the strike prices of these options. And so fees make this difficult. However, time makes it easier. If I can buy more than one block or multiple blocks, then you know, it's more likely that I'm going to have that payoff.
00:11:47.065 - 00:12:29.626, Speaker B: You know, I guess as a expected higher volume would mean higher prices on the right side here basically execution is possible. You know, one could do this today if one was able to buy blocks. But it requires basically an active options book, you know, some expertise around how do you manage, how do you manage short dated options? It's not as straightforward as kind of longer dated options. It's less of a theoretical exercise, much more of a practical one. You also need to have a sufficient amount of inventory because you're selling in one place, buying in another. I use 75% volume just as like a random number on the previous slide. But historical volume for ETH is actually more than 100%.
00:12:29.626 - 00:13:13.193, Speaker B: For very short dated options in some cases it's 150 or 200%. Does that mean it's higher? Maybe, but you offset that with basically liquidity and you know, when the volume is 150 200%, you're not getting huge liquidity. So what we did is we ultimately said even if the volume markets are 200%, we're only going to be able to execute at 75. So we assumed a whole amount, a huge amount of slippage in that process. Again this example, it only assumes eth. You know, one could, this is actually a portfolio really that we should be looking at. I would be selling, you know, ethnic Bitcoin, XRP again Solana as well.
00:13:13.193 - 00:13:59.537, Speaker B: Basically, basically all the centralized assets versus their equivalents on the decentralized side. Bunch of other considerations, but this is it. So I wanted to walk through this because it's a thought exercise and I think it's relevant and important for the market that we talk about. You know, we're talking about pre confirmations and proposer commitments. And when you extend from a basic pre confirmation to selling a whole block of confirmation, pre confirmations, to multiple proposers selling pre confirmations, it invariably kind of moves in this direction. And so you know, I want to present this to just enable us to like think about how the future may evolve. So I'll just pause here for a quick moment.
00:13:59.537 - 00:14:05.925, Speaker B: I'll get into the Ethgas product shortly, but I'll take a pause to see if there's any questions.
00:14:10.185 - 00:14:47.495, Speaker A: Thanks Kevin. So I guess this was a NEF research post that you posted recently. Maybe today or yesterday. I guess part two is more of an actual auction mechanism that you're trying to build and it's maybe like more on the mechanism design side of things as opposed to the, to the analysis. Because I guess for pricing there's two things we need to do. One is that we need to design good auctions and then two is that we need searchers to be able to place bids. And I guess part one is more on the searcher side of things and it could get very complicated with mathematical models but maybe part two could be like a very simple auction mechanism.
00:14:47.915 - 00:15:08.941, Speaker B: Yep. So. Well, I guess it depends how we look at it. So, so there's a question here. 0x Princess. I'm not sure if I'm mistaking anything but you're basically trying to do sex decks arb shops r& D and set it as a baseline for pre comp pricing. Yes, to 0x Princess.
00:15:08.941 - 00:15:52.889, Speaker B: But there's two elements of sex decks are basically, there's the real time kind of the trading the delta or trading the gamma of it and then there's basically what's implied through the options market. So it's almost like a forward looking market versus a, like a, like a real time active market itself. So they're, they're kind of two similar, two parts of the same pie. Yeah. Okay, so with that in mind I'll jump into our product and again if anyone has any questions, just put them in the chat. So ethgas, what are we? We're basically a. Actually I'll, I'll change the word adjustment you're using.
00:15:52.889 - 00:16:42.527, Speaker B: It's less about auctions and more about a marketplace. And the way we see it is, you know, we basically have a marketplace for real time commitments and at, at a high level. What excites us is basically that you know, we, you know, the moment that we can, the moment that anyone can put through any trade on Ethereum and get a confirmation within 3 milliseconds that basically means that you know, Ethereum can compete on a latency perspective, on a settlement perspective with the centralized counterparts. But, but, but of course, you know, it, it is decentralized and arguably better in that process. And so for me that, that's kind of the singular moment for Ethereum. That's what excites us in the team. You know, if we only applied real time commitments To Ethereum itself, we'd be looking at maybe 130tps on Ethereum.
00:16:42.527 - 00:17:32.015, Speaker B: This is assuming that we use the most efficient, almost efficient kind of transfer mechanisms, for example intent protocols. So when you combine intent and real time settlements, that's when we're looking at 130 TPS in the future. When we look at base roll ups, then you're not limited by that L1 gas. You have a bit more capacity and so we'll see where that goes. But what we're doing can apply equally to L1, L2 and based rollups as well as other L2s itself. We are centralized, so we will have a server somewhere sitting on a rack in discussions with the various market participants. We haven't had issues so far in terms of this centralization, but if it's an issue, we can open source, look at some ZK Compute or other approaches if it's required through governance.
00:17:32.015 - 00:18:22.241, Speaker B: On the topic of governance, we are soon to be governed by a DAO or a token. So you know, to the extent that you wanted to change the incentives, the products, the features with what we're doing, one is, you know, this call itself and you know, feedback from the community. But another is basically through our token and the DAO design where we could dial up or down, you know, how we kind of skew the product that we have. Important for us as well is kind of giving people choice. And so, you know, we're using a commit boost which we can talk about later, that gives proposers choice. But in, in what we're doing, we want to give the proposers the choice as well to, to, to. To choose default settings perhaps or to structure how they want to sell block space.
00:18:22.241 - 00:19:44.715, Speaker B: You know, I think this whole initiative around pre confirmations is in kind of maybe shifting some of that power to, to the proposers or validators and kind of letting them decide whatever it is and how they want to sell their own block space. Okay. And then so as it relates specifically to us in our kind of more micro thought process, the, as I said earlier, it was basically empowering validators or empowering proposers, but specifically maximizing their fees. And in maximizing their fees, what we wanted to do was look at the PBS flow, but basically just reduce fragmentation across a big chunk of that flow, close information leakages. We wanted to increase access and I'll talk about what this means later on, but we basically achieved this through some type of product standardization. After sharing the article last night, I've learned that we need to engage more with the community in terms of what is perhaps good MEV versus bad mev, Maybe we can discuss this later. But I think it raises questions over, like, you know, who should be policing whom? Perhaps in this case, you know, we are, we are of course out of protocol, but, you know, who should be policing proposers? Is it us as a, you know, as a, as a gateway that you'll see? Or is it the, Is it the, Is it, is it the network itself? Is it Ethereum? Is it the community, you know, to be decided.
00:19:44.715 - 00:20:39.369, Speaker B: Okay, so the PBS flow, as I said, is from our perspective, it's quite fragmented. There's a number of aspects to this, but basically the. One of the main parts is that with the builders you have, they're basically selling kind of like conditional commitments or conditional guarantees. The fact that there is no guarantee for them to actually get into the block, the best they can do is try. But when we shift to this other box here is called pgs, I call it proposer Gateway separation. I don't know if that's the right term, but it's my next slide. But basically, when you delegate the commitments from a, from a proposer to a gateway, where the commitment is specifically, specifically from the proposer, then these are absolute guarantees.
00:20:39.369 - 00:21:29.815, Speaker B: And I'd argue that absolute guarantees are worth more than a collection of conditional guarantees. I'd also posit that with an absolute guarantee from the proposer, there are new types of commitments that we would see that currently don't exist or are currently not feasible. And potentially we can talk about these later as well. Now, structurally, I think, Justin, you gave me earlier, I think the more appropriate word, a unified gateway, if that's what it is, we call it internally, like a bit of a proposer gateway separation. But what we've done is basically we take. Well, where do I start here? So a proposer basically delegates this block optimization process, this control of commitments and how they're going to work. They delegate that to a gateway.
00:21:29.815 - 00:21:59.355, Speaker B: In this case, let's say it's us. And they delegate it to a gateway per. For a certain slot. So in a previous slot, it could be someone else, this slot, it's usually next slot, who knows, it's up to that proposer. Now, within this gateway is some type of place where we would sell and other people would buy commitments as well as building blocks itself. Now, whether we eat gas, build blocks, or someone else, we're kind of indifferent. But what's important here is that the builder has to be neutral.
00:21:59.355 - 00:22:34.547, Speaker B: And so I'll also get into this as well. Before I get into that, maybe just some definitions. So we have three products. One is inclusion pre comps and this is just to kind of agree for the purpose of this discussion on, on, on how these work. So an inclusion pre conf is, I think, as most of us would generally agree, you, it's a commitment from the proposal proposer to guarantee just to include your transaction somewhere in the block. That's it. So the way that works is proposer number five in this case sells a certain amount of block space.
00:22:34.547 - 00:23:18.015, Speaker B: They they sell 10 million of inclusion pre comps into the market. Now let's say I've bought that 10 million block space. Yeah, I bought that 10 million pre comp. Now maybe two slots later, maybe I don't need 10 million anymore. Right? So you know, when it comes to, when that block comes to now, maybe I don't need anything, in which case I kind of just don't do anything with that 10 million and it goes empty. Now what I'd like to do ideally is if I'm not going to use it, I'd want to sell it because then the absolute cost of these pre confs is not the for gui that I paid up front for the pre conf. It's really just the carrying cost.
00:23:18.015 - 00:23:54.835, Speaker B: So if I could buy that pre conf at you know, four gwe, but then a moment later sell it for three and a half, then that gives more value to the pre comp itself because there is a secondary market to it. So what's important here is that it's not just the primary the ability to sell a commitment, but it's the ability to trade it and basically offlay or get rid of it to the extent that you don't need it. What this does is I think.
00:23:55.455 - 00:24:03.447, Speaker A: Am I missing any problem? We can't hear you anymore. I think we can see you, but.
00:24:03.471 - 00:24:06.035, Speaker B: We can't hear you. Hello? Hello?
00:24:06.415 - 00:24:07.595, Speaker A: That's better. Yes.
00:24:07.935 - 00:24:40.005, Speaker B: Okay, sorry, I think I hit my mic there. So I think where I may have left off because I hit my mic was at. By selling, by selling the pre conf and having it trade in a secondary market. It basically provides price discovery. And when pre comps trade in a secondary market, you then basically get a curve of pre comp. We have some trading at this block, that block, this slot, that slot, many slots. And that basically answers the question over what is the fair price for a pre comp? And the fair price for a pre conf is whatever it is trading in a secondary market.
00:24:40.005 - 00:25:13.053, Speaker B: So that's one of the key design decisions for us. So that's the inclusion preconf on an execution pre conf. This is only for the next slot. So basically like slot one. And in this case here, what happens is that I am, I'm a searcher. I want to put in this bundle and I'm going to bid 50 GWE for this bundle. Someone else is now going to put in a bundle which conflicts with my bundle.
00:25:13.053 - 00:25:43.169, Speaker B: So bundle one and bundle two conflict. Now I put in a bit of 50. That other guy put in a bid of like a hundred. What we do through this progressive auction is we provide a feedback loop to the person who is. Whose bid is insufficient. So through WebSocket, we basically tell me that, hey, your bid of 50 is insufficient. Would you like to update it? So at that point in time I can then update my bid to a value higher, in which case we would then notify the other person that theirs is insufficient and it basically goes higher and higher.
00:25:43.169 - 00:26:40.547, Speaker B: And so this recursive or progressive auction, it's. It's intended to capture as much of the expected MEV of that bundle itself. But there are restrictions around how fast can you simulate these and you know, kind of how many iterations can you do as well. There was a question earlier about why don't we use like a second price auction or some other approach. And the reason is because when you have execution pre confs, the ability to support a single execution pre conf, it often depends on what else, like the other components in the block itself. And so it's never just one execution pre conf by itself, it might be like one execution preconf might conflict with two others, and these two others might not conflict with one another. So we basically need to create different groups or batches of pre comps and sorry, batches of execution pre comps and optimize those independently.
00:26:40.547 - 00:27:15.295, Speaker B: So it's a bit of a optimization exercise. We're not that sophisticated yet. But just highlight that there's this feedback loop in the execution pre confs. Finally, there's basically like the entire block itself. So extending from an inclusion pre conf, if a proposer says, you know what, I just want to sell 30 million, then that's basically the entire block. And so in this case, that's what proposer number eight is doing. They would just sell the entire block and of course they would sell it in the primary market like the original sale.
00:27:15.295 - 00:28:03.617, Speaker B: And once it's sold, then those people can then, you know, onsell it within a secondary market itself. So incl. Inclusion and whole blocks Primary and secondary execution is through an auction. Okay, so a little bit more detail on this proposer gateway separation, if that is even the right term. So the key points here are that the participants in this market, it's basically everyone, everyone is in this single unified market. Now the particip participants, they trade commitment products and during this time, no transaction information is revealed to anyone. So I can't see exactly what you're doing, but I know that, you know, there's X amount of inclusion pre comps, there's an execution pre comp which may or may not conflict with what I'm doing.
00:28:03.617 - 00:28:59.757, Speaker B: I can see the public MEM pool, you know, but, but I don't actually see any trades and therefore I'm not able to kind of specifically front run anything. What's important for this is basically product standardization. And so in the way we've designed it, again, you have the whole block, you have inclusion, you have execution. You kind of don't even need to know anything about PBS or MEV in this context. Like you could be just like a standard market maker. You could buy a whole block and you could then choose to decompose it into its individual parts as you like. And so what this invariably does in the process is, you know, whereas today we have kind of four block builders, you know, arguably it basically opens up this entire process to, you know, dozens, if not, you know, like 40 or 50, like sophisticated people who just want to market make on blocks.
00:28:59.757 - 00:29:57.225, Speaker B: And so I have a slide in terms of some of those dynamics shortly. So the idea here is that people are trading these commitment products at, and then finally at 11.8 seconds or whatever that threshold is, then everyone will have submitted the actual transactions to that block to us. And then there's some type of building that's going on. Okay, now in this process, how is this built? Do we then basically distribute this information externally to other builders, again, neutral builders? Do we distribute it externally to neutral builders who might combine it with their own order flow? Maybe. But the difficulty is the execution pre confs. If we have execution pre confs in that block, which are then negated or challenged or conflicted by someone else's private order flow, then it makes it difficult for us to kind of optimize and honor that execution pre conf in the first place.
00:29:57.225 - 00:30:46.913, Speaker B: So this is a part that we're struggling to figure out right now. The optimal approach is to keep it internally, but would love to work with some, some of the block builders to see how could we share this with them as well. But again, There is some difficulty around the execution pre conf. Part one more slide, entire blocks. So I know there's some discussion around, you know, is it good or bad. But the way we see it happening in practice, and you know, this is for discussion is again, you know, right now we have this process where four people are basically controlling what goes into the blocks. We see this as shifting from four to maybe like 40 people, a bunch of which are just like very financially driven and just market makers.
00:30:46.913 - 00:31:26.745, Speaker B: They'll just buy the blocks and then they'll then strip them apart. And in this process, if I am, let's just say gsr, for example, like I'm a market maker, gsr. I can buy a block at some point in time and I can hold onto that block until, you know, that, you know, a 10, 11 second point where maybe I can use it entirely for myself and I can make more money out of that block. So how much the block is worth versus what I purchased, maybe, you know, I, I can, I can do that. Alternatively, maybe I'm actually not good at monetizing what's in this block. Maybe I, I don't know, the, the various mev opportunities out there. My book is limited.
00:31:26.745 - 00:32:05.855, Speaker B: I don't need to do trades, in which case I would decompose or I would strip that block into its individual components. And I can do that because I can see people bidding for execution pre comps. I can see people bidding for inclusion pre comps. So at any point in time I know that there's these people who want parts of these blocks and I can basically look at those prices versus my own price itself. And so that basically gives me the option again to decompose it and strip it to its parts. And of course, if there's really no bids anywhere, then you know, I might lose money in this process, but, but at least I don't lose everything. And that's where again, the importance of that secondary market comes into play.
00:32:05.855 - 00:32:51.993, Speaker B: And so there's some questions on, you know, Telegram and elsewhere, but the, the dynamic, I think this is the last slide. Yeah, I'll come back to that. But the dynamic here is largely that we've intended to capture basically everything through this gateway. And within that process there's, it's a very efficient process. You know, we can basically optimize the entire thing however fast, like a modified R builder can work. But then, you know, maybe it raises questions, you know, how independent are we versus the proposer? So, you know, we would attest that we're neutral. But you know, maybe there's some way that we could, you know, make that a bit more, build some more trust from that, from that element.
00:32:51.993 - 00:33:36.891, Speaker B: But, but this was the way we basically put together how we can optimize block space. And so one final slide here is basically starting with the optimization exercise. You know, we feel like a block that is part of a consecutive block that's worth the most. Following that, you have like an isolated block. If I can buy an entire block that gives me optionality to do whatever I want with that block again, or strip it into its individual components, which may be worth more or less. If that optionality, if I don't have that optionality and I just have a mix of execution guarantees, precomps and MEV boost, then that's worth less. And then as you kind of strip away the components, it's worth less and less.
00:33:36.891 - 00:34:26.185, Speaker B: So I think this is kind of the logic gates to determine what is the, what maximizes the value of the block. But of course there are considerations are around like what does this mean for Ethereum? And so, you know, what is, what is our role in building and supporting this? You know, do we, do we enable people to buy multiple blocks? Is that for us to decide? Is it for our DAO to decide? Is it for, is it ultimately for the validators to decide? But you know, ultimately we've built this technology. We want it to work in the best interests of the community and we'd like to see kind of what that means. So I'll stop there. I rambled for 30 minutes. I'm sure some people are pretty bored, but I'll stop there.
00:34:30.285 - 00:35:10.525, Speaker A: Great, thank you so much, Kevin. So I guess we have about 25 minutes for Q and A. If we have any questions, feel free to raise your hand or just unmute and get speaking. I mean, for me, one of the takeaways here is that with commitments there is an opportunity to make blocks more valuable. And there's several different reasons for that. One is that we're dealing with unconditional commitments as opposed to, to conditional ones where we're unifying the market. And so there's more price signals that kind of go in a single auction and there's less leakage.
00:35:10.525 - 00:36:14.965, Speaker A: There's also an opportunity for multi slot, but that's potentially extremely controversial. And yeah, there's maybe also the possibility to get premium from the UX benefits of pre confirmations or maybe from the hedging benefits of selling block space futures for roll apps that buy block space in bulk. So all in all, I guess my intuition would Be that if we have a sufficiently mature market then we might see an adoption curve similar to mev boost. So mev boost went from 10% adoption at the merge to 90% today over a period of a couple of years and hopefully. Or maybe we see a similar thing with commitments. You have your hand up.
00:36:15.265 - 00:36:16.285, Speaker B: Sorry, go ahead.
00:36:16.985 - 00:36:28.285, Speaker C: Yeah, so just really quickly. Earlier you mentioned that this enables different kind of commitments that you can't get today with the builder market. Could you explain some of what those are? Because I couldn't come up with any.
00:36:32.745 - 00:37:06.393, Speaker B: I'd like to plead the fifth on that one at the moment. Okay. Possible. There's. So we, we, we have a pretty good network amongst a mix of market makers and traders. They basically come up with a whole suite of these other commitments which I was like, well, anything is kind of theoretically possible, but we also want to be good custodians of what we're doing here and the broader ecosystem. And so there's some in those territories, in that territory.
00:37:06.393 - 00:37:10.245, Speaker B: But I'll kind of leave it there for now. Yeah.
00:37:10.585 - 00:38:08.395, Speaker C: All right, thanks. Okay, I have another question. If, if no one has one. So you talked about how, you know, this marketplace could potentially be used for not only Ethereum but also based rollups and actual L like non based rollups in the future. I guess I'm trying to think how so, like for example, a lot of roll ups today don't use the typical PBS pipeline and they're very controlled in how they sequence or who, who they let sequence. So I don't know, maybe you could just give some more detail on how you envision it working with like non based L2s.
00:38:08.815 - 00:39:07.195, Speaker B: Yeah, so the, well, I guess the question is who can be a sequencer or not? It's basically where we can, where we can basically do exactly what we're doing on those chains or L2s that we can kind of unify the market between here and there. And so that's, that's kind of the, the broader goal. I think base is straightforward but on the L2 side we're, we're looking into it and on the surface we don't think there's anything that really prevents us from merging somehow Your B, your L1, Ethereum roll up with the, with the non based L2 as well. You know, there might be different timing associated with the two. But you know, at the end of the day, once you have a commitment, you, it's kind of like an asset. You can almost like tokenize it and trade it and it can kind of transfer from One place to another. So I see this kind of future where commitments are a universal kind of language between all the L1s and L2s and you can kind of like pool settlement and liquidity from all these at the same time.
00:39:07.195 - 00:39:23.385, Speaker B: Yeah. So there's this intersection between kind of all this commitment market and all the intent stuff going on as well. And when you put the two together, there's some good stuff there. We need to unpack it a little bit more, but very excited to explore that.
00:39:40.775 - 00:39:59.075, Speaker A: We have a question from Francesco. If I got it right, the base case scenario for EthGas is that every proposal delegates to EthGas so you can have consistent execution preconf and also enable market maker to trade the commitments. Ultimately EthGas would become the sole builder on Ethereum. Question mark, Isn't this centralizing?
00:39:59.665 - 00:40:59.973, Speaker B: Yes, yeah, that's centralizing. Coming back to the, this part here, you know, the goal is to maximize fees at least for the purpose of, you know, how we've designed it. You know, we could, we could, we could remove ourself hypothetically as a centralizing entity by let's say open sourcing what we're doing. So let's say now we have multiple people doing what we're doing with perhaps like almost as good infrastructure, DevOps and software. So in that case, you know, now you have multiple people doing it, but then you basically lose largely anything to do with multi block, you know, multi block mechanics and then you also take risk as well. So the issue with one of the issues we had is that just around like fragmentation and adoption. So a lot of our endpoints are kind of your, your typical API endpoints as if you're going to trade on like okx or binance or what have you.
00:40:59.973 - 00:41:50.299, Speaker B: So we just want to make it as easy for people to adopt. But when you have traders, MEV and you know, like a bunch of people who now need to integrate with multiple other exchanges, that creates kind of hurdles and fragmentation for them. And then that invariably then creates again more fragmentation just means lower fees for validators. So yes to your question, but open to exploring decentralizing if you know, validators, the community, our DAO says like hey, you guys need to decentralize more and reduce control or reduce centralization. Yeah. We're also exploring fallbacks as well. So in the event from just like a DevOps DevOps perspective, like AWS goes down, like what happens? We haven't fully fleshed that out as well, but realistically that's like 0.01%
00:41:50.299 - 00:41:52.775, Speaker B: or whatever. That frequency is.
00:41:59.675 - 00:42:19.265, Speaker A: I have a question. Is it correct to say that running one of your gateways is essentially pure DevOps? Assuming that the code is open source, there's no need for, you know, connection to dexes or fancy algorithms or, you know, capital.
00:42:20.445 - 00:42:56.313, Speaker B: No. No. So. So short answer is no. The capital part becomes difficult. So let's say that there are 20 different gateways, right? So in this case, there's 20 different gateways. Now how are the proposers posting collateral to backstop their commitments? Do they now need to post collateral to 20 different gateways? Because if I have, if there's 20 different gateways and there's only a 12 second block, again, it's the whole, the logistics around managing that collateral process and the slashing process, it gets a little bit more complicated and potentially more capital intensive for these guys.
00:42:56.313 - 00:43:46.607, Speaker B: I don't know how that would work within an Eigen layer context. Maybe there'd be like a unifying collateral contract which we all subscribe to and we kind of all agree to. But, but yes, it would largely just be a DevOps to your, to your question. And then in that case, you know, coming, coming to Ellie's questions, how that may evolve is that. Where is it here is that if there were multiple gateways, hypothetically multiple gateways might have different types of commitments, right? So you know, we might have a certain type of execution guarantee with a certain number of conditions. Someone else might have some really nasty stuff in there, or someone might have some better stuff. Right? But you kind of get, maybe you might have more diversity, more choice, but perhaps more risk as well.
00:43:46.607 - 00:43:47.555, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:55.895 - 00:44:40.735, Speaker A: So the current path that we went down for the collateral is that we have this notion of a, of a deposit contract where the proposers can deposit collateral on chain, and that would be collateral which would work for all the gateways equally. And all the gateways would follow a similar standard to make those commitments so that you can have slashing conditions across all the gateways simultaneously. And the nice thing is that the collateral can be reused across gateways and it can also be reused across validators. So if you control many different validators, you can have, for example, 1 ETH of collateral across all the validators.
00:44:43.795 - 00:44:44.515, Speaker B: Go ahead.
00:44:44.635 - 00:44:45.695, Speaker A: No, go ahead.
00:44:46.195 - 00:45:20.575, Speaker B: I was going to say that would work for us conceptually. So the way we have it is just, it's a collateral smart contract. But then one of the issues is that when you have multiple gateways, then if the gateways have different types of products, have different types of commitments or products, then basically what is the. What is the right amount of collateral for those contracts. And so right now we have one. We assume for collateral you need to post 1 eth per 1 million block space. So you need to post a 30 million, sorry, 30 eth as collateral per per slot.
00:45:20.575 - 00:46:19.995, Speaker B: But then what we were looking into was that when you get into some of the special execution guarantees, you probably need to post a lot more eth. But you know, things we can discuss, you can also not, you can also not post more eth. And then the buyer can just factor in the default likelihood and price it into the contract itself. But TBD and something else we were looking at was the ability to delegate or pool your collateral as well. So to the extent there were other validators that think similar to you, you could almost be able to post more collateral kind of on, on demand. Yeah, and that was largely for the, for the solo stakers because the solo stickers don't have 30 ETH. But maybe they, maybe collectively we can kind of create pools of validators and we would slash from that pool versus from any specific individual.
00:46:23.795 - 00:47:18.697, Speaker A: So in terms of sizing collateral, the thinking that I have is that you can post whatever amount of collateral you want. It doesn't only have to be eth, it can be any asset. And then the type of commitments that the gateway is able to sell is a function of how much collateral you have. And my hope, and this is kind of roughly confirmed by the fact that most of the blocks are worth less than 1 ETH today. If you look at Mathboost that almost all the time, let's say 99% of the time, for 99% of slots, you only need roughly 1 ETH of collateral. It's only in these tail cases where you need large amounts of collateral. But if you don't have the large amounts of collateral, then that's fine.
00:47:18.697 - 00:47:24.765, Speaker A: You just opt out of providing these commitments for very large purchases. For example.
00:47:26.585 - 00:47:43.335, Speaker B: The problem there is that those 0.1% of times are the times also when people probably want to buy the commitments as well. So in periods of extreme volatility, that's especially when you want that commitment. That's just a counterpoint to that.
00:47:44.075 - 00:48:50.445, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I guess this is where maybe we disagree a little bit. So my view is that the main buyer of these short dated commitments will be users and wallets for pre confirmations. And that will happen roughly, it will be roughly spread across all slots. There won't be some slots where there's tons of requests. And on the searcher side, my thinking here is that As a searcher, as an arbitrage, I'm only willing to pay for commitment at fair price minus epsilon, where epsilon is my edge is my arbitrage opportunity. Whereas the gateway on behalf of the proposer is only ever willing to sell a commitment at fair value plus epsilon where the epsilon is the cut that the gateway and the proposer combined make. And so if you have rational actors on both sides, then the trade of the commitment would never happen.
00:48:50.445 - 00:49:12.211, Speaker A: We can't hear you Kevin. I don't know if you acknowledge the. Oh, we can't hear you.
00:49:12.243 - 00:49:14.491, Speaker B: No, I'm still here.
00:49:14.643 - 00:49:15.611, Speaker A: Okay, perfect.
00:49:15.763 - 00:50:07.825, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Someone just messaged me as well from who's in the group here as well. But we're on. We, we've released all our docs on our website ethgas. In terms of timing we'll have basically our test net will be probably next week sometime. So we can ping the group to actually do this on testnet. And again if there's any neutral builders that want to work with us, let me know.
00:50:07.825 - 00:50:10.545, Speaker B: We're not experts in that space.
00:50:12.685 - 00:51:02.195, Speaker A: So on this slide here, like this one. Yeah. The thinking that I have is that you have the gateway in the center and whenever it's making a commitment it's basically broadcasting that commitment to all the builders whether or not they're neutral. And then at the very end of the slot or towards the end of the slot the gateway says here this was my very last commitment. And so now all the builders have end commitments that they have to satisfy. And if we're working with pre confirmations then most of the time these commitments will be top of block commitments. And so really what we're asking the other builders to do is just build the bottom of the block that still respects the top of the block as constrained by the commitments from the gateway.
00:51:06.265 - 00:51:28.489, Speaker B: So I, I think that works in the near term but with some of the discussions around those, the types of commitments again I think that some other. Yeah, I guess that the risk is just that there's some trades that go into the block that then violate or you know, conflict with, with the, with the guarantee, with the execution guarantee.
00:51:28.617 - 00:51:48.015, Speaker A: But well it's always the builders responsibility that's basically the non gateway builder to respect whatever was done. So if there, if they have you know, private order flow that conflicts with the, with the commitments, then tough luck they won't be able to, to put it on chain.
00:51:49.155 - 00:52:47.373, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess there was a thought that we at the moment we would be broadcasting it. We are then exposing substantially, you know, the majority of all the, what was then private transaction flow, we would be then exposing it to all the builders. And at that point then perhaps like integrated builders would use that information to potentially force certain execution guarantees or users to force their transactions to fail. So we want to kind of study that part further where again where typically the transactions are all private, but if in this case we're broadcasting it to non neutral builders, then there might be bad actors who would, you know, force failure of certain contracts. Drew in your, in your, Drew to your question on what is a neutral builder? Yes, they don't, they, they're not part of a prop, they're not part of like a HFT firm. They don't have their own trading business. They're just a builder.
00:52:47.373 - 00:52:48.185, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:53:03.175 - 00:53:14.475, Speaker A: Question from Harry. Execution guarantees have to be top of the block. Doesn't it take away the sextech arbitrage profits which indirectly reduce the overall MEV of a block?
00:53:18.785 - 00:53:57.085, Speaker B: Well, I don't think they have to be at the top of the block. I mean they could be at the bottom of the block as well. There also may be cases where it could be in the middle of a block, you know, depending on what is at the, at the top. At the top of the block doesn't take away. Well, I think execution guarantee. I think it depends what people are putting into an execution guarantee and that may take away some of the arbitrage profits. But yeah, I guess I'm not fully understanding that question Harry, but feel free to message me and we can chat about that.
00:54:01.585 - 00:54:29.045, Speaker A: I think the question is that the gateway should make sure to only sell execution commitments if the price that they're selling at is greater than the opportunity cost of selling it. And so if the opportunity cost is like reducing a sex text arbitrage by 1 ETH, then the gateway needs to make sure that it's selling the Preconf at least 1 ETH. 1 ETH plus epsilon.
00:54:33.465 - 00:54:51.595, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess in that case we would just let the market decide, I think what the price is there. Yeah, sorry, maybe it's terminology. I'm, I'm not fully, not fully grasping that.
00:54:56.895 - 00:55:13.885, Speaker A: Well, I guess it's, it's about setting the reserve price. So if you just let the market do its thing, then sometimes it will go under, you know, the fair reserve price. And so really the gateway needs to set the reserve price so that the proposer always gets fair value plus upside on.
00:55:18.185 - 00:56:08.639, Speaker B: But, but in my case the fair price is the market price. So if you take a case where there is like one bidder, you Know, arguably that's the person has put in like a low bid. But you know, if there's a, if there's an environment where you have like multiple people at the table with bids, then that would be, that would be kind of the fair price. Right. So irrespective of what they think of what a proposer thinks the fair price is, you know, the fair price is obviously what the market would bear. And so if everyone's, if everyone's only willing to bid like 3gwei for a certain type of commitment, you know, the proposer is then expressing a view and they're saying that I know more than the collective intelligence of the market to value this block differently. And I think that's, that's not a utility maximizing decision for a proposer to set kind of arbitrary prices.
00:56:08.639 - 00:56:45.725, Speaker B: I, I think the proposer in that case should basically say, I think the decision logic should be around we want to sell, you know, X, Y and Z or Z of products when there's a sufficient amount of market information. When there's a sufficient, the definition of sufficient might be, you know, when there's at least three bids or, you know, something to that effect. But yeah, for them to say like, no, the price just isn't good enough. I mean, do they know more than the collective intelligence of all the players out there? You know, in most cases, I'd say no. Most of the validators don't have that, that ability.
00:56:48.145 - 00:57:20.995, Speaker A: So I agree in the end game, where you know, all the searchers, all the builders, all the alpha is kind of concentrated on this auction. But there's going to be a transition period from MEV Boost to this. And initially during the bootstrapping phase, there might be a lot less alpha in this commitment market than there currently is in MEV Boost. And so it might be a suboptimal move to make the transition as a proposer, if I don't have guarantees that it is net profitable for me to connect to this new auction, which is less mature.
00:57:23.545 - 00:58:14.785, Speaker B: True. So I think that's not distinct to us necessarily. I think it's kind of everyone who's looking to kind of enter that block space. So yeah, that's kind of like a cold start issue. I think all that we and other participants that are building kind of commitment platforms can do is to draw a sufficient number of parties to the table and get a sufficient number of validators or proposers to say, you know, we, we support this initiative, we're happy to take less than the optimal income over a week. You know, whatever that period is, and over that week, then basically, you know, searchers, traders, everyone else who wants to transact in a certain block, they'll be forced to go through this gateway. All right, so, so what is that teething period? It's like maybe a week or a month, I don't know.
00:58:14.785 - 00:58:20.785, Speaker B: But I think that's practically how it might evolve for whether it's us or anyone else.
00:58:22.165 - 00:59:05.355, Speaker A: I mean, another issue is that there's a MEV grows super linearly over time. And so if you're selling 12 one second chunks, that might be worth less than selling one big chunk of 12 seconds. And so if you're catering for pre confirmations where the whole point is to just break down the slot into these shreds, which might be only a few milliseconds long, then the natural bidding mechanics won't be enough. You need to have some sort of guarantee to the proposer that selling the parts is greater than selling the whole.
00:59:11.265 - 00:59:49.005, Speaker B: Perhaps. Yeah, in our case we, the only thing that we can do is provide the products that are interchangeable. So whether it's a block or whether it's the constituents, we think that the collective market has more experience than any proposer. And so the collective market together should be able to buy these and bid for them and strip them down at whatever price. So in that process, we think that the proposal would never need to decide what is a fair price for either a pre conf or a block or an execution guarantee. They just know that it's a competitive process and a unified process across all participants all the time. But again, the.
00:59:49.005 - 01:00:03.855, Speaker B: I think I'm kind of going at circles, but you know, it's, it just comes back to like, is that a, is it a fair price is purely a function of is there sufficient information in the market at that point in time? And as you pointed in the early days, there may not be that sufficient information.
01:00:17.075 - 01:00:22.475, Speaker A: Okay, we've reached the top of the hour. Thank you so much, Kevin for your presentation and Q and A.
