00:00:00.920 - 00:01:36.124, Speaker A: So just a short update from our side would be that we finally managed to see everything needed to start a new wave of reviews. And the reviews will start tomorrow as soon as I'll finish the update of the return data from the logs that Kilari pointed out, and we actually fixed on Friday the issue that we had on return of the some of the guest values that are different due to the fact that we actually now allow our processor to consume the minimum gas fee and not set it to zero if it is not set explicitly. So, yeah, that's a minute issue, but it definitely changed many logs and this would remove it. So, yeah, running hive tests one last time before the next review. And if you get any ideas of what shall be fixed in there, any specific tests to fix after, we'll ship the new image, please do post to me in DM's or on Trello so that you'll be able to, like, make it in parallel to the review. Yeah, that's it with us.
00:01:36.424 - 00:01:39.888, Speaker B: So did you say there's a new image now, or are you talking about the.
00:01:39.936 - 00:01:41.284, Speaker A: It will be out tomorrow.
00:01:41.784 - 00:01:42.176, Speaker B: Okay.
00:01:42.200 - 00:01:49.884, Speaker C: Okay. Have you checked the tests that it's passing? Most of the tests, or have you been able to run them?
00:01:50.784 - 00:02:06.204, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm checking them right now. Sometimes it's easy to understand, sometimes it's not that clear for me. But yeah, I'll come back to you when I'll get my understanding more clear.
00:02:08.944 - 00:02:25.114, Speaker C: But basically they should always match. Except the error message is something that can differ. But other than that, there should be matching. But yeah, some of them might be get bugs as well. If you find descriptors and then you believe that you are right, then yeah.
00:02:26.254 - 00:02:50.384, Speaker A: That's why Trello is much more useful for us than just running tests blindly. And yeah, I had one more question. For this current iteration, our understanding is that we use the setting from the configuration that would set the inter block times to 12 seconds. Am I correct with that?
00:02:51.684 - 00:02:54.212, Speaker C: Yeah, that's what we agreed on last time.
00:02:54.308 - 00:02:55.024, Speaker A: Yep.
00:02:57.604 - 00:02:59.504, Speaker C: Did you remove the phantom blocks?
00:03:01.084 - 00:03:06.504, Speaker A: Yes. Haven't you seen it in your last, like, running of it?
00:03:07.524 - 00:03:10.856, Speaker C: I didn't run them, but yeah, I can run them and see.
00:03:11.020 - 00:03:12.004, Speaker A: Please do.
00:03:17.664 - 00:03:18.644, Speaker C: Hey, guys.
00:03:20.144 - 00:03:38.492, Speaker D: Yeah, not so much for me. I was busy with other work. Yeah, my goal is still to remove shadow blocks. Still have to do that.
00:03:38.628 - 00:03:39.304, Speaker E: And.
00:03:43.004 - 00:03:43.784, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:44.804 - 00:03:49.860, Speaker D: And then yes, change the block time to 12 seconds.
00:03:49.972 - 00:03:50.620, Speaker A: I guess that's.
00:03:50.652 - 00:03:53.704, Speaker D: I can do that today. It's easy, straightforward.
00:03:59.884 - 00:04:00.220, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:00.252 - 00:04:06.154, Speaker D: I'm guessing that this week also will be a bit tight for me as I'm gonna be traveling.
00:04:10.494 - 00:04:14.594, Speaker C: Okay. Did Oleg had something to say before I interrupted?
00:04:15.254 - 00:04:24.554, Speaker A: Yeah, nothing. Just that we would really appreciate if guests would also use 12 seconds when we will be testing tomorrow.
00:04:27.054 - 00:04:31.350, Speaker D: Yeah, sure. I can try to push that today.
00:04:31.422 - 00:04:32.234, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:04:34.134 - 00:04:42.754, Speaker C: But, yeah, the phantom blocks one, that will cause some differences, but, yeah, not all of the tests are using phantom blocks.
00:04:43.174 - 00:04:49.074, Speaker A: We will hope Trello will help us to synchronize across what is still wrong or not.
00:04:50.734 - 00:05:05.394, Speaker C: Yeah. Do we have anything new that has come up? I don't think we have now. I think new. Maybe now we can finalize spec, but I don't know.
00:05:07.414 - 00:05:11.434, Speaker A: Do we have any outstanding issues to make spec not finalized?
00:05:14.094 - 00:05:21.354, Speaker C: That's how it has been many times that we think that it's finalized, but it never is. But, yeah, I guess now nobody has found any issues.
00:05:22.414 - 00:05:40.274, Speaker A: Let's give it one last week, figure out all the issues on Trello, and maybe somehow ask community one more time on just like, on discord in asynchronous way, maybe. Can we do something like that?
00:05:41.214 - 00:05:53.394, Speaker C: Well, I think before we can get all the tests matched that there can be something that you guys have. We understood different things, and then we had to discuss those, that we had to agree on how some of those cases are handled.
00:05:56.054 - 00:06:06.594, Speaker A: Yeah, but if we could, like, poke community somehow to just, like, take a look at the spec, think about it, propose something if they have any ideas.
00:06:06.974 - 00:06:07.558, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:06:07.646 - 00:06:11.994, Speaker A: So that they would also have time before, like, final reviews of Gethene element.
00:06:13.194 - 00:06:18.414, Speaker C: Was it clear for you how the ERC 20 transfers work, that you get those figured out?
00:06:19.154 - 00:06:28.694, Speaker A: It is clearer, but I'll have to run it after I finalize tests that we fixed with Lukash.
00:06:29.554 - 00:06:40.094, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the data field is the quantity being moved. And then you have to have those in the logs. You have to read those topics, which are. I think the three are always the same.
00:06:40.904 - 00:07:15.604, Speaker A: Do you have, by the way, some other tests that would be able to test not like this special log that we eject, but some, like, more default logs that would just happen to be to be ejected by AVM so that I would be able to compare the thing that we are creating, like, manually ish to the thing that was created automatically ish. If you could send to me this test in diem, that would be perfect.
00:07:16.304 - 00:07:20.444, Speaker C: Yeah, I think there's some. Yeah, I guess I need those in the DM.
00:07:21.184 - 00:07:27.164, Speaker A: Thank you so much. Alias. Welcome.
00:07:28.784 - 00:07:48.744, Speaker E: Hey, guys. Nice to meet you. I just joined the calendar invite for some, like, all core devs. I'm currently working at Kakao KVM. I don't know if you know it. We've been working with some nethermind people. It's KVM out of the stocknet ecosystem.
00:07:50.124 - 00:07:50.904, Speaker A: Nice.
00:07:51.924 - 00:08:00.604, Speaker E: And I was looking at your article on mirror. I don't know. Wait, who is Dark Floyd? They're not here.
00:08:01.144 - 00:08:02.244, Speaker B: Public Lori.
00:08:02.904 - 00:08:04.044, Speaker C: Yeah, it's mine.
00:08:04.744 - 00:08:21.044, Speaker E: And we're looking at how we could implement the eth multi coli one on Kakarot client. But I don't have so much context, so maybe I'll just sit in and listen a bit. Nice to meet you.
00:08:23.344 - 00:08:49.624, Speaker A: Kalari made beautiful 80 ish. I think five tests that allow to test nearly every piece of what is expected from is simulate to be produced. So yeah, there is. I think we can somehow share the details of how you could take that hive node and look into it.
00:08:51.584 - 00:09:08.364, Speaker C: Yeah, the blog post is somewhat old. We also, it used to be called multicolored now simulate. And that was changed. And then I'm talking about the phantom blocks in that. But we decided to remove the phantom blocks then there can be some other differences like that.
00:09:10.144 - 00:09:14.684, Speaker E: So you're saying it's not called multi cold v one anymore, it's called simulate.
00:09:16.484 - 00:09:20.424, Speaker C: Yeah, that's right. We got similar display better.
00:09:21.404 - 00:09:35.664, Speaker B: Here's in chat here, I'll paste a link to the spec that we're working on that should. Should be up to date within like a week. Like when we make decisions here on this call, it gets updated usually by the end of the week. And we haven't made any super recently.
00:09:36.524 - 00:09:48.624, Speaker E: Okay, nice. We're currently working with a fork of Hive to pass the hive test. We're passing all the EOf tests. But is this already available? The Hive. The Hive branch you mentioned.
00:09:51.724 - 00:09:52.904, Speaker A: It'S a fork.
00:09:54.444 - 00:09:58.028, Speaker C: Yeah, there's a branch for them, but it's not merged to the hive yet.
00:09:58.196 - 00:10:04.264, Speaker B: Okay, but you can. Someone should be able to just pull that branch and test against this, right?
00:10:05.644 - 00:10:19.384, Speaker C: Yeah. But if you are interested in the development, we also have a telegram group that you can join and we can invite you there. If you are interested in more discussion about, then we can help you more when you are implementing stuff.
00:10:20.364 - 00:10:31.344, Speaker E: Okay, I guess this falls into. I don't know if you've talked to many ZK rollup teams like scroll or Polygon about this.
00:10:35.964 - 00:10:37.104, Speaker B: No, we haven't.
00:10:37.284 - 00:10:50.044, Speaker C: But we have mentioned in the coordinates calls once, but no one of those reached out us. I don't think we have reached out for those. We have been most reaching out coordinates of the Ethereum protocol.
00:10:50.344 - 00:11:46.464, Speaker E: Yeah, I guess they're waiting for the update to kind of hit get and then for them to rebase or something. I don't know. But I guess one problem we had in Kakat is, I don't know if you know it, but we wrote the EVM in Cairo, which is the ZKDSL of the Stacknet, and so we have a probable EVM, but then in some parts that are like solely in the client. So this happened for tracing, for example, and for debug API. It was harder to, it was we had to rewrite it in rust or like use the, use the primitives from rest to implement it because we usually, if you use tracing, you don't need it to be proven, so you shouldn't write it in a pro language. But. So my guess is that this multi call, this simulator, it simulates v one is something that is going to be, because it's only a simulation, it's only going to be in the client side.
00:11:46.464 - 00:11:55.944, Speaker E: And so my guess is that if we were to help, we would probably help by implementing it in rest. I don't know if they've already implemented it.
00:11:57.244 - 00:12:46.054, Speaker B: They have not, and you are correct, this would be a client side only, and I can't think of any reason why you need to prove it, unless you want to do something like a late client sort of thing, where you have someone else run the simulation, you want them to prove to you they actually ran a legit simulation against the right block. Like you could do all that, but just, if you're looking for just a consensus type stuff, it's all non consensus. So similar to eth call in the sense that it's off chain. It doesn't matter. If you trust the person executing the code then which, it could be you and you don't need to prove anything. As far as rest, I believe we reached out to them and they didn't express any problems with it or concerns, but I think it just wasn't high on the roadmap. So they haven't started it yet, and so you might want to just verify with them to see if they've already started it.
00:12:46.054 - 00:12:54.714, Speaker B: Maybe they just haven't talked to us before, so you don't waste any work. But as I do know, they're, I'm pretty confident they're aware of it. But last I heard they hadn't started anything.
00:12:55.294 - 00:13:01.514, Speaker E: Okay, nice. So I think, and actually ask. Okay, cool.
00:13:02.294 - 00:13:23.094, Speaker B: Yeah, we, if you want to give me your telegram handle, I can invite you to our telegram group and if you have any questions while you're researching or if you decide to implement it. That's a good place to ask. Give me 15 minutes to figure out how to invite someone in. Telegram.
00:13:27.074 - 00:13:33.974, Speaker C: Do we have anything else? Everything else clear?
00:13:37.274 - 00:13:44.034, Speaker B: Actually, try that. Try that invite link, see if that works for you. Yep. Excellent.
00:13:49.374 - 00:13:50.674, Speaker E: Okay, thanks a lot.
00:13:53.654 - 00:13:56.154, Speaker C: I guess we can wrap it up if you don't have anything else.
00:13:57.374 - 00:13:58.310, Speaker E: All good for me.
00:13:58.382 - 00:14:02.034, Speaker B: Thanks for nothing for me.
00:14:03.014 - 00:14:04.234, Speaker A: Nothing for me.
00:14:07.234 - 00:14:17.414, Speaker B: Looking forward to nethermind and geth both having same output and we can move forward hopefully soon to getting this into the main line of both clients. That'd be great.
00:14:21.234 - 00:14:23.254, Speaker C: Yeah. See ya.
00:14:24.994 - 00:14:25.354, Speaker B: Later.
00:14:25.394 - 00:14:26.174, Speaker C: Talk to you.
00:14:26.754 - 00:14:28.814, Speaker E: Bye bye. Thanks. Nice to meet you guys.
00:14:29.714 - 00:14:30.074, Speaker B: You too.
