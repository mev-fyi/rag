00:00:06.160 - 00:00:14.516, Speaker A: So at the last ETH London event, I bumped into Stuart. We got chatting, and this is the.
00:00:14.538 - 00:00:18.560, Speaker B: Result, the very first panel here at EtH London.
00:00:18.640 - 00:00:26.756, Speaker A: I'm sure there'll be more to come, but thank you very much, Stuart, for stepping in and putting together a very eminent panel for what promises to be.
00:00:26.778 - 00:00:30.430, Speaker B: A very interesting discussion. So without further ado, I'll hand over.
00:00:31.360 - 00:00:53.212, Speaker C: All right. Wow, this is amazing, guys. Thanks so much for being here. Makes a bunch of lawyers very happy. So, yes, I think we actually may have ten or twelve lawyers in the room tonight, so be careful. I am. As Chris said, I'm Stuart Mass.
00:00:53.212 - 00:01:50.950, Speaker C: I'm a huge enthusiast of blockchain space and I am incredibly excited about its potential to bring about change, positive change. And as a lawyer, I've been very keen to see a dialogue between the blockchain community and lawyers, to think about what, in terms of existing law, stands in the way of what the blockchain community wants to accomplish and how can we move around that, what isn't in the way? And it can actually be a tool to help the blockchain community achieve what they want to achieve, and then in that dialogue, to understand what does the community need and want from lawyers and what can we do to help. So we have an amazing panel here tonight. We have four lawyers with us. We have Sean Murphy. Sean is a partner, a corporate partner at Norton Rose, which has an industry leading practice in this area. They've been in the space for several years now.
00:01:50.950 - 00:02:18.830, Speaker C: Sean focuses on fintech, advising startups, regulators, investors and mature companies. He leads the firm's global practice on distributed ledger and blockchain. Their clients include Eris Industries, which obviously everyone will be familiar with. Next is Stephen Paley. Stephen is here from Washington, DC. He's a lawyer at Anderson Kill. He's a litigator and an amateur coder as well.
00:02:18.830 - 00:02:53.080, Speaker C: Very amateur, he says. Many of you will probably have read some of his articles on coindesk, including talking about liability and jurisdictional issues with respect to Daos. Lorna Brazell is a partner at Osborne Clark. She focuses her practice on intellectual property litigation and advising clients. She has a background in physics and so she's not a stranger to computer programming either. And she's contributed to a treatise on the law of bitcoin. And then finally we have Raul.
00:02:53.080 - 00:03:23.664, Speaker C: I'm sorry. I even asked him beforehand how to pronounce it and I still got it wrong. He's an attorney at Hill Housetter. In their technology team, his focus is on medium and small enterprises and of course not surprisingly, has been increasingly bumping into blockchain with his clients. You may have seen him on BBC tv. He's a regular contributor there about tech law. So tonight, we have our work cut out for us.
00:03:23.664 - 00:03:35.348, Speaker C: There's so many things to talk about. When I originally sent Chris a list of what we could talk about, it was so long that it's inspired us to think about doing a series of panels here, if you will permit us to do so.
00:03:35.434 - 00:03:35.684, Speaker D: But.
00:03:35.722 - 00:04:16.316, Speaker C: So tonight we want to touch on Daos. What are they from a legal perspective, and how does liability and responsibility attach? We want to talk about smart contracts as well. Can legal contracts be smart contracts and vice versa? And what kind of issues do you run into there? If we have time, we'll touch on how we think blockchain might impact the legal community, which is a self interested topic, but also for the entrepreneurs in the audience, could be interesting as well. So without further ado, we're going to jump into the topics. So just to cut to the chase, let's just jump right in and answer the question of from a legal perspective, what is a Dow and what is the community of Dow token holders?
00:04:16.508 - 00:04:45.532, Speaker A: Not a great deal, to be honest with you. The great thing about companies, maybe you know, maybe you don't know. They were a wonderful piece of technology invented several hundred years ago, which let you stand away from the risk of a business so you could set up a fictional legal person that was the company. Company would sign all your contracts, and the company would have liabilities if it was an individual. So the people couldn't come after you if the company went bust, take your house. If you don't have a company, then you don't have a separate legal entity from yourself. So if you're setting up a dow as a collection of people, well, the dow is just a collection of people.
00:04:45.532 - 00:04:52.370, Speaker A: There's no company, there's no legal entity that stands between you and anyone that that bunch of people might enter into a contract with later down the line.
00:04:54.660 - 00:04:56.450, Speaker C: Yeah, just pass the mic down.
00:04:57.220 - 00:05:27.160, Speaker D: Okay, so how does the law treat a bunch of people? The first question that we need to preface every answer we're going to give from here on in is which law are we talking about? So I'm an english lawyer. I'm going to talk about english law. I'm also going to mention spanish law just once. Steve and I suspect he's mostly going to talk about Us law. But if you went to China and you asked the same question to a bunch of lawyers, you'd get a subtly different answer, because legal systems have evolved to handle things slightly differently. So english law has two alternatives. You're a bunch of people, you're doing things together.
00:05:27.160 - 00:06:16.100, Speaker D: The question is, are you doing it for profit? Is this a commercial enterprise or is this not for profit? And if you're for profit, the law is going to see a bunch of people aiming to make a profit by doing something together as a partnership. And there is shed loads, but shed loads of case law on how liability and how contracts work when one of the contracting parties is a partnership. The other alternative, if you're not doing it for profit, you're doing something purely for fun or for the public good. Then you'll be what the law calls in English, the very clunky term an unincorporated association, which in my legal notes is always a UIA, which is close to being a UFO, but not quite. Again, there are lots of these around. If you think of university societies, you think of village cricket club. I once sued the RAF club on Palmal.
00:06:16.100 - 00:06:54.740, Speaker D: Turns out they're an unincorporated association and they didn't even know it. So these things do exist in the real world. They own property, they enter into transactions. In that case, one that went wrong, and the law will find a way to allocate liability accordingly. So just because you haven't got a corporate personality, you aren't operating under the name of a corporation doesn't mean that the law can't handle what you're doing and will treat this as a completely novel experience. I just wanted to mention the one spanish law point, because I think it is an important thing to remember that there are two categories of law in the world. Broadly speaking, common law, which is what we all do.
00:06:54.740 - 00:07:28.290, Speaker D: England, US, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand. We're the common law countries, much as the rest of the law, is largely civil law, and they have a very much more statute imposed approach. Nevertheless, they will still have the same kind of categories, corporation, partnership, other sort of association. So I checked, and the spanish version of an unincorporated association is called a community of goods. It's not exactly the same, but it works in a similar way. So you can't get away from the law getting a grip on you just by stepping outside of some of the illegal system.
00:07:29.860 - 00:07:51.336, Speaker B: Hi, my name is Steve Palley and I am not here to sue your dao. I want to get that out of the way. So I would preface all of this by agreeing. I mean, the world is a big place. There are lots of different countries. I mean, in the United States we've got 50 different states. I'm speaking generically, I'm also not speaking about any particular dao, including a particular very large one.
00:07:51.336 - 00:08:46.376, Speaker B: But I would distinguish between dao code, which is code. It's not a person, it's a thing. It might be sitting in a repository on GitHub doing nothing, and then another bucket would be dao code once instantiated by someone. Right? Because someone has to turn it on. And then I would have probably a third bucket or category, which is, what does it do? And how do the owners of tokens who collectively govern or own it interact? And I don't think it's helpful to anybody here, necessarily helpful to lawyers to say it is or it is not any particular thing. If anybody read that how to sue a DAO piece, they will see that there are several footnotes at the bottom. And I would encourage anyone who's read it and thinks that lawyers want to sue you to actually take a look at footnotes three and four.
00:08:46.376 - 00:09:30.260, Speaker B: What I describe in those is a court appearance that I once had in which a very lovely but hapless man discovered that he was liable for a contract, someone else, that he had a contract for a lease that someone else had signed. It happened. The court found that he was the guy's partner. I'm not saying that any particular DAO is an unincorporated association, a partnership, an association for common good, whatever it is. I'm just saying, if it were me, I'd probably ask, because I don't want to be the guy in footnote three. That's it. And I would also say that it's probably possible to create a DAO that insulates people who were involved in it or who own stuff from liability or risk.
00:09:30.260 - 00:10:14.710, Speaker B: I also think, and I think I coined this term, it's called the first law of lawmodynamics. And I borrowed from the real engineers here, the first law of thermodynamics. Risk or liability don't just disappear, just like those riskless cdos back in the day. It goes someplace. So I would ask that question, if you're involved in a DA or thinking about getting involved in it, where does the risk and liability go? It may be that you don't have it. It may be that a guy like me, I'm not going to sue you anyway, because I'm not really interested in that, in suing daos or participants. But you just got to ask, where does the risk go? Where does the liability go? Who is going to someone who's going to come after you? How would they? Or how wouldn't they?
00:10:15.800 - 00:11:52.630, Speaker E: Thanks, Steven. What everyone's been touching on here is that if it is the case, which it isn't, that it's not an incorporated company, and it is something like a partnership, as we've been talking about here, there are potentially consequences that come with that as a result of the operation of law. And I think we'll probably touch on this in more detail. But there's a sort of question of liability amongst the members themselves, because partners of a partnership are jointly and severally liable on an unlimited basis for the debts of the partnership. So that's a pretty important legal issue to keep in mind. And it's the type of liability issue that Stephen was talking about that when a lawyer looks at that, a lawyer would say, wouldn't it be better to be very clear about what your liability is and what your responsibilities are vis a vis the other members of the organization and vis a vis third parties? The other thing that I wanted to say was that what we've been talking about here is how the law considers the organization. The other question is, how does regulation view the organisation? And looking at it from an english law perspective, one question that I might ask would be, is this a collective investment scheme? If this was an organisation that was operated from England, is it a collective investment scheme? And if it is, is it an unregulated collective investment scheme? Because if it is, there are sort of issues and liabilities and consequences that flow from that.
00:11:57.180 - 00:12:53.592, Speaker C: One thing that I think is probably already apparent, but I should mention, is that lawyers are prone to ask questions in response to questions. In fairness, this is an area that is undeveloped and there probably aren't a lot of answers. So I think that one thing to look for and pay attention to is guidance on the kinds of questions that one should be asking. As you think about this, and as you create your daos and as you participate in them, there may not be as many answers that come out tonight as you would hope. Although feel free to ask your questions at the end, and please hold them till the end so that we can get through as much as possible. Such is the nature of lawyers. Stephen, I just wanted to follow up with one point that you made.
00:12:53.592 - 00:13:01.180, Speaker C: You said it's probably possible to create a dow that insulates the token holders from liability. Can you just comment a little bit on what you have in mind there generically?
00:13:04.240 - 00:13:31.590, Speaker B: Maybe somebody could create an smart contract called indemnity sol. Maybe you can lay off risk to insurance. Incidentally, I suppose I have, because lawyers also like disclaimers. None of this is legal advice. I'm speaking solely on my own behalf. If I have any clients who are listening to this and I say something you disagree with, none of this binds you. I'm sorry.
00:13:31.590 - 00:14:08.848, Speaker B: So I'm speaking off the cuff. So indemnity and insurance don't completely insulate you, but they lay off risk. I actually asked a friend who is a broker about bitcoin insurance. Bitcoin ethereum, not exactly the same thing. And what I heard was not a lot of appetite in the market. And Stuart, I don't know if you can speak to that yourself, but to Coinbase, if you look at their website, they say they have enough insurance to cover all of the bitcoin in their wallet, all of the bitcoin that they store. Pardon me, I don't think there's any ether insurance out there yet, or smart contract insurance.
00:14:08.848 - 00:15:04.880, Speaker B: But as the technology becomes more mature and as you iterate, which is one of my favorite words I learned from developers, was iterating. I think it's awesome, right? And really useful. So as you iterate, those might be things to think about. And I'm not smart enough to draft your indemnity smart contract for you, but I, and there are plenty of other lawyers out there who are sympathetic to or understand the technology enough to tell you, here's some things to think about, or for was, I can't remember if it was twitter email earlier today. In the United States, for example, every state has an anti indemnity statute, so that if you try to create a smart contract that provides an indemnity for sole negligence, it's probably unenforceable. If I were writing an indemnity smart contract, which is neither smart nor contract, I know I might want to know that because it would make it more useful. And did I answer that question that I rambled for five minutes?
00:15:04.950 - 00:15:10.710, Speaker C: No, that's fine. We'll let the audience decide. They can follow up if there's more.
00:15:12.520 - 00:15:55.810, Speaker A: I was just going to say, I think it's important as an audience to sort of draw a bit of a line between when we talk about insulating ourselves from risk and indeed from liability, when one is a member of a DAO and you're standing behind the DAO, there is a very big difference between having a seatbelt, like an insurance contract, or an indemnity in place and somebody not being able to sue you. So you still have to go through the hassle of a court case and being on a claim form and very possibly having your credit rating impacted by that. It's all very well that there's an insurer who'll pay up at the end of it. Could you create a dao that prevents you from being sued? I don't see a way of doing it without having a legal company in front of you. Are there some fantastic ways that you might put safeguards in place to safeguard your wallet in the event that you were sued as a member of a DAO? Yeah, there almost certainly is.
00:15:57.640 - 00:16:33.310, Speaker B: I guess I would say that may be true, but at least in the United States, somebody can sue you because they don't like what you had for breakfast. So it is true that you cannot completely insulate yourself from liability, your participation in a daO, but I would say that's probably true generically of most things. But I would also agree that having some form of a corporate entity can provide a measure of protection. Now, even then, a corporation is no good if you don't follow corporate formalities. So the corporation is in and of itself only valid protection if it does what it's supposed to do.
00:16:33.840 - 00:17:02.440, Speaker D: And I'd just like to be controversial here and say my colleagues are clearly pushing you in the direction of. So what you want is a corporation. That's where the DAO is going to end up. And if you get it right and start there, good for you. Until last December, I think was still a member of a completely shared liability partnership. I think we were probably one of the very last city law firms. I think there's only one left that is still a completely open partnership.
00:17:02.440 - 00:17:54.836, Speaker D: And I have to say, something goes out of an organization when you move into a corporate form and you can all go, it doesn't matter if he completely fucks up, because there's this corporate structure between me and responsibility for what he does. So I'm just going to let him get on with it. Now. I don't mind if he messes up, as long as it's not my client that he's acting for at the time. You lose that shared trust, you lose that shared interest in effectively acting as each other's watchdogs, keeping each other straight because your pocket is insulated, your name is partially at least insulated. So I'm in favor of organizations, if they can, retaining that community basis and community spirit and trust. But when you get to a very large organization and you've got a whole load of idiots all over the planet who are participating in your organization, then the ability to watch each other's behavior and over each other's shoulder gets an awful lot harder.
00:17:54.836 - 00:18:16.720, Speaker D: And I would say that an unincorporated Dao is going to be fine when it's a small group of people with a very clearly defined purpose, and you can set yourselves up a set of rules like your university chess club rules, and know that you're all likely to abide by them. Once you get into making serious money and having people that you've never met in person participating, then maybe you want to go to the corporation.
00:18:17.860 - 00:19:17.076, Speaker C: And Lorna, you had made a comment earlier about courts imposing aspects onto an organization if they haven't done so themselves, and we were talking about that beforehand. Do you want to comment a little bit more about that? Because I think that one of the things that I've struggled with in thinking about this tonight is there is a tension from the perspective of wanting to create an organization in which it's not encumbered by the traditional corporate forms and create new ways of regulating ourselves and acting. And then we were talking about the fact that if you do find yourself in front of a court, a court may just simply impose aspects of traditional corporate forms on you because you were silent about those. And that's something that we obviously wanted people to be aware of, to understand that that may happen without your own intent. So can you comment a little bit on how and why that happens?
00:19:17.178 - 00:19:34.810, Speaker D: Yeah, sure. So this takes us back to my initial distinction between a partnership and an unincorporated association. Partnerships, under english law are governed by the Partnerships Act. 1890. 1890. Or is it 18 80? 18 18 90? 18 80. Anyway, it's a very, very old act, and it's still in effect.
00:19:34.810 - 00:20:10.160, Speaker D: You can have a partnership just by setting up a welk stall together with nothing in writing and indeed possibly nothing said. You see a fresh batch of welks one day, you decide to set up a stall and sell them to people. You're a partnership. How do things work out then? When one of you runs off with a day's proceeds? It's okay. The partnership act has set out what the rules for the conduct of the two of you are. Now, if you'd sat down and had a conversation before one of you ran off with the takings, you might not have chosen those rules. But since you didn't have that conversation, you didn't spell anything out for yourselves.
00:20:10.160 - 00:20:34.300, Speaker D: The partnership act does it for you, and you get what's in there. No choice. Unincorporated associations. There are no statutory rules. So then you have complete uncertainty as to what did each of you have in your mind's eye as to be the sharing of the proceeds, which means a really big, expensive argument, at least with the partnership act. You know, you might not like it. But you know what the rules are.
00:20:34.300 - 00:21:06.836, Speaker D: If you've got a corporation, you have to have written rules, because that's how you set up a corporation. You know what the rules are. If you are unincorporated and you have no rules, then it's just a recipe for a dispute. And a dispute that's going to be the more bitter, because the chances are that one of you understood the whole purpose of the welk store was to enable you to put down deposit on your flat. And the other one thought it was so that you were going to have a great dinner and a party, but you didn't share the belief. So you're at a collision stage. So simply deciding not to have rules remaining silent doesn't mean there aren't rules.
00:21:06.836 - 00:21:09.050, Speaker D: It just means you don't know what rules they are.
00:21:10.940 - 00:21:17.690, Speaker C: So we've heard about a liability a couple of times coming out as an issue that flows from.
00:21:20.140 - 00:21:26.316, Speaker F: Each question, just even though it.
00:21:26.418 - 00:21:48.832, Speaker C: Yeah, okay. All right. Yes, the judges and the judges and the jury have come back. Overruled. So liability has been mentioned a couple of times as something that flows from what your corporate structure or the lack of your corporate structure is. So let's talk about that. That's something that there's been a lot of conversation about in the forums, et cetera.
00:21:48.832 - 00:22:15.660, Speaker C: And to be honest with you, as a lawyer, I feel anxiety about the question of whether or not DAO token holders can be personally and jointly inseverably liable for accident emissions of a DAO. So can we talk about that? What are your views on who is liable for the axe and omissions of a dow? Who's responsible for the axe and omissions of a dow?
00:22:19.120 - 00:23:20.352, Speaker E: The question of liability. There are actually a range of people that you could look to in terms of who might be liable for something. But if we start with the members, the members are ultimately responsible. If it's a partnership, and I'm making an assumption here that it's a partnership and people haven't written rules for it, and therefore the general law applies. The consequence of that is that each member, as I said earlier, is jointly and severally liable on an unlimited basis for the debts of the organization. And what I think makes this particularly interesting in the context of something like a DAO is the pseudonymity of the members of the DAO. Because if you are the one member of the DAO who can be identified, you will be the person who is theoretically going to be picking up and bearing the full brunt of liability, and you will find it very difficult probably, or possibly to identify the other members of the Dow from whom you should.
00:23:20.352 - 00:23:37.960, Speaker E: Normally, if it was a normal partnership, you might be able to recover whatever damages or whatever loss or amount that you've paid out from. So I think the combination of that pseudonymity with the potential of these being partnerships is a very, very interesting dynamic.
00:23:38.620 - 00:23:39.690, Speaker F: Anyone else?
00:23:42.780 - 00:24:21.764, Speaker B: I would preface this by saying it, of course, depends on the DAO, depends on the jurisdiction, and it depends on the use case. Right. It also depends on who the token holders are. I've been thinking about this, and maybe somebody in the audience has an idea, but let's say hypothetically, you have a DAO where all of the members are seven year olds. Seven year old isn't legally competent to execute a contract, for the most part, at least in the United States. We were talking before, we had a great conversation about the difference between void and voidable contracts. Yes, I'm not going to go into that, but that may matter.
00:24:21.764 - 00:25:14.468, Speaker B: The conduct of the DAO may matter too. I think all of these questions too are fixable, both for existing Dao and for other DAo. You can create a principal agent relationship with some sort of external third party actor. For example, you could create entities. You can limit liability in certain circumstances in certain jurisdictions to being just joint, but not several. It's a question of, I think again, for any dayo, sort of asking the question, like my father in law always says, what's the worst thing that could happen? Right? And then how much time do you want to spend trying to prevent that from happening? I probably wouldn't want to be the last person standing. And I will say this one last thing.
00:25:14.468 - 00:25:35.550, Speaker B: I've said this to plenty of clients over the years, and I would say it again, just because somebody doesn't know who you are doesn't mean that a government or a plaintiff with a big budget can't find you. It's actually possible to sue John Doe's in the United States. And here.
00:25:37.840 - 00:26:14.452, Speaker D: I have a point and a story on that. The first one is the know sued on the committee goes as far as it goes. If Bill Gates puts the entire resources of Microsoft to finding you, the chances are maybe not this year and maybe not next year, but possibly in three years time, they will find you. Pseudonymity in perpetuity is a really, really hard ask, and my story is a corollary to that. Law works in perpetuities. I don't know how many of you are based here in London? Sorry, I'm not keeping the mic close enough to my mouth. Are based in here in London, have ever been round the royal courts of justice on the Strand.
00:26:14.452 - 00:27:09.588, Speaker D: It's a fabulously beautiful building and it's open to the public and I strongly recommend it. If it's ever raining like it was yesterday and you need to go inside somewhere for half an hour. It's the best of victorian architecture. What paid for the building of the royal Courts of Justice was an IOU that the treasury of the day gave to the Ministry of Justice in return for all of the money that was sitting in the funds of the Ministry of Justice, representing all of the unpaid out inheritances that had accrued for the last 700 years. If you're responsible for executing somebody's estate and they give it in equal shares to their 17 grandchildren, and it's well known that one of those grandchildren emigrated to Australia in 1847, so you have no reason to believe they're dead or that they didn't have children, but you just can't find them. You put the money into Chancery. Chancery sat on it for up to 700 years, if necessary.
00:27:09.588 - 00:27:36.500, Speaker D: And if that grandchild comes back from Australia today and can prove that they were entitled to a share of that money, the treasury will pay them out. The law doesn't forget things just because you've got away with it for six weeks, six months, six years. We are talking long term here. So liability on a pseudonymous, on a John Doe basis, you may laugh and go, okay, they've made a ruling, but it doesn't touch me. Yeah, but if you ever come back or your name ever does become public, then it's waiting.
00:27:41.320 - 00:27:42.660, Speaker G: They're on the blockchain.
00:27:43.240 - 00:27:53.800, Speaker C: There's the takeaway for the night. Can we just hold that? I apologize, but. Okay. Curveballs are allowed. Curveballs are allowed.
00:27:55.420 - 00:27:59.096, Speaker G: I think if you broke down corporate law and partnership law and you tried.
00:27:59.118 - 00:28:00.712, Speaker H: To put the Dow in, you might.
00:28:00.766 - 00:28:02.844, Speaker G: Find problems calling it any of those.
00:28:02.882 - 00:28:05.144, Speaker B: Or even calling it an association.
00:28:05.272 - 00:28:09.928, Speaker G: Why isn't the Dow a robot? Somebody has a leashing robot and it's.
00:28:09.944 - 00:28:10.940, Speaker F: Not any of those things.
00:28:11.010 - 00:28:14.860, Speaker G: Right. And it probably falls more under product law than anything else.
00:28:14.930 - 00:28:16.350, Speaker B: Leave regulation out.
00:28:17.200 - 00:28:18.830, Speaker G: Yeah, you've got code.
00:28:21.600 - 00:28:42.410, Speaker B: So the question was. Yeah, the question was or the suggestion was, maybe we're missing the point. The DAO is code in and of itself, and maybe product law applies. And I agree with you. You've got code. You've got somebody who instantiates and makes the code live. Sure.
00:28:42.410 - 00:29:01.084, Speaker B: Right. And you have the stuff that. The stuff that the code does liability for, which might be attributed to either. The instantiator. I'm sorry if that's not a word. It is now. Right.
00:29:01.084 - 00:29:13.632, Speaker B: I would bucket it, and I would agree with you that code in and of itself is code, but people have to turn it on and people receive returns. That's the difference. I think products liability law is actually quite an interesting approach. I'm going to hand.
00:29:13.766 - 00:29:27.130, Speaker E: Yeah. Just to sort of pick up on that. The way I think about it is what we're talking about here is the relationship between people, not the sort of the software itself. And you have to ask, what is the nature of the relationship between the people who are.
00:29:29.500 - 00:29:33.304, Speaker C: Gonna. This could go on all night, trust me.
00:29:33.422 - 00:29:34.090, Speaker F: Yes.
00:29:36.140 - 00:30:14.100, Speaker C: Lorne, to pick up on this point about the law being able to find you. I think one of the comments that has appeared a lot kind of in the forums and the discussions is the view that, well, is any of this relevant? Because at the end of the day, are they going to be able to find people? And this question is for anybody, but if they want to sue a Dow token holder or a Dow, are they going to be able to find the people, or are they going to be able to find enough people to make it matter? So does it actually become moot? Is it a fine legal point, but in reality, is it irrelevant?
00:30:18.680 - 00:30:39.720, Speaker A: Yeah, I think people will find you. People thought that it'll depend on the financial value. Is it worth finding everything? Is it worth bringing to court? But people thought for a long time that things like the Silk road are impenetrable. They said nobody will ever find anybody in the Silk Road. It's pseudonymous. This is how criminals do business. Now, lo and behold, it turns out people have inserted all sorts of code in the Silk Road to let them identify end users.
00:30:39.720 - 00:30:54.790, Speaker A: So I don't believe for a minute that there won't be a way of identifying people at the bottom of dows. Maybe it's not particularly efficient this year, but next year somebody will have some weeds to find you at the bottom of it. And if it's financially viable, if a few million quid ride on it, then you can be sure they'll find you.
00:30:58.200 - 00:31:02.340, Speaker C: A couple of other questions that come up and then. Oh, yeah, of course.
00:31:02.490 - 00:31:24.590, Speaker D: And I think somebody on my left already sort of pointed out it may not be them trying to find you, it may be you trying to find each other. The man who runs off with the takings from the welk stall is the other partner who's interested. So it's actually in your interests as well that there's some way of finding and identifying who's involved. Not that I'm saying anyone here would contemplate any such action, but these things happen.
00:31:25.200 - 00:31:55.430, Speaker C: Stephen, you mentioned the idea of agency as a way to allocate liability. If a DAO were to act through an agent to interact with the real world, whether that's entering into contracts, monitoring contracts, hiring lawyers as parties, would that agent be responsible and liable for the accident omissions of the DAO, and vice versa, would dao be liable for the accident emissions of that agent?
00:31:55.980 - 00:32:49.320, Speaker B: According to Elon Musk, there's about a one in billion chance that this is base reality. So going to the real world issue, I hate to give it kind of depends answer, but let me throw this back at the developers here. If I went to a developer and I said, what's the best language or what's the best framework? Should I use perl, c sharp, rails? I mean, you would tell me I was crazy. It depends, right? So I would say I have to offer the same caveat here, and I hope you will understand. Maybe you can think of it in those terms before you hate me for caveatting. The principal agency law is really cool, though, and the concept is principal can act on behalf of an agent. The agent can be disclosed, or the agent can be undisclosed.
00:32:49.320 - 00:33:29.140, Speaker B: An agent can bind a principal to contracts. An agent, in some instances, can even bind a principal who doesn't have legal competence if that authority is granted by a court. And in fact, courts sometimes can designate people to act for parties who are incompetent. So in the US, for example, if a minor wants to file a lawsuit or settle a lawsuit, they have to have, in some jurisdictions, what's called a guardian ad litem appointed for them. That's someone who looks out for their interest. And a settlement of lawsuit has to be approved by a those. Anybody here have kids? I'm sure some of you do.
00:33:29.140 - 00:34:30.584, Speaker B: You've probably signed those waivers that say you're waiving any claims on behalf of your children and you're going to indemnify and hold harmless the owner of the, I don't know the circus where your kid is going. So I actually do some research on this a couple of years ago in the US, and it turns out they're really not in a lot of jurisdictions. They're not enforceable because unless you have authority to act for your child, which is judicially sanctioned, you can't. So I've just given you a web of complexity, and I'm going to try and narrow it back down. Principal agency law is cool and incredibly well developed, and it provides a zillion different ways to create it provides a zillion different ways to create smart contracts based on really smart people spend lots of years trying to figure out solutions to these problems. How do you act for something that doesn't exist? Principal agency law is one place to.
00:34:30.622 - 00:35:29.084, Speaker C: Look, and we need to, unfortunately, wrap up the dow part of this discussion. It's extremely painful. We could spend days or weeks discussing this. But the question I want to ask, and I want each of you to answer this, something I think a lot about, and I think probably everybody in this group thinks a lot about, is we are referencing all of our answers in terms of the existing legal structures and the existing legal rules and protocols. Can we envision, is it realistic, do we think, to envision a new paradigm, a new structure? Obviously, common law is built on adapting things to new things, and that is very inventive and it's very creative and it's very organic, but it's not a perfect fit. Obviously, this is something new. I mean, can we imagine a supranational regulatory regime maybe like we see with the law of the sea, where we sit down and we say, this is something new.
00:35:29.084 - 00:35:49.228, Speaker C: We need new rules, we need new regulatory structures, we need new conflict resolution bodies, or just even within this coming up with new codes, new rules, new standards, et cetera. Can we envision that? Or is it not realistic to think that the legal system will allow, at least in the short term, that kind of new invention?
00:35:49.324 - 00:36:32.624, Speaker E: So I think you made a couple of really good points there, Stuart. The first thing to say is that at least in England, the english legal system is very, very organic and it's very fluid, and it develops in response to developments. The second thing that I would say is that, I mean, as I said earlier, what we're really talking about is relationships between people. And to some extent, there's nothing new under the sun. And what we're talking about here is people coming together and doing business together, pooling assets together. And english law has considered that before, and it has a number of structures that have been developed to accommodate that. And we've mentioned many of them.
00:36:32.624 - 00:37:43.140, Speaker E: So partnership, unincorporated associations. So to some extent, I would expect that if a court was to look at it today, a court would apply and would think about, well, what is the existing legal structure that applies to this? And this is most likely to be the correct legal structure for it. However, what I can imagine is that in the future, as these things go out into the wild, much more with much greater frequency as they're tried and tested. And once you start seeing sort of wider consumer adoption, it is possible that you might see amendments to statutes. We might see an amendment to the UK Company act to accommodate a corporate form of organization, a corporate Dow, so that you'd have the benefits of the limitation of liability and the flexibility of the Dow structure. I suspect, however, that's some way off, and that for the foreseeable future, for the short to medium term, what will happen is that the existing law will be applied to these organizations and that will be the frame of reference.
00:37:45.320 - 00:38:03.340, Speaker B: I love Oliver Wendell Holmes. He wrote a book about 100 years ago called the common law and a very famous quota. Most american lawyers know it. The life of the law is not logic, but experience. We've seen change in the past. The printing press, that was huge. Elevators, also big.
00:38:03.340 - 00:38:39.700, Speaker B: The way things adapt. Barbed wire, also important. So electricity required regulation and laws, I think we're looking at. In the US, the state of Delaware has passed blockchain corporate law. Vermont is looking at a change to their evidence code, which is very interesting. You can adapt a current corporate structure to. You could take a DAO and you could slap it into a current corporate form, you could decide which pieces of corporate governance you want to automate.
00:38:39.700 - 00:38:57.710, Speaker B: Because part of what a DAO does is automate processes automate performance, and it wouldn't require any change at all. You could do that today using existing law, and I believe you could do that in a way that would make regulators smile. You may not want to make them smile, but if you wanted to, you could.
00:38:59.600 - 00:39:45.480, Speaker D: But I'm going to come back to knowing what your rules are. There's nothing at all stopping you, for instance, setting up a global dispute resolution body. When we first introduced the domain name system, ICANN ultimately wrote a uniform dispute resolution procedure, which is operated by a group of different bodies. There's one in the US, there's WIPO in Geneva, there's various places you can go to to have one of these disputes resolved. And it's under a global, uniform set of rules for who's entitled to a particular domain name. So there's no reason at all why it couldn't become a standard component of any new dow. That there's a dispute resolution clause that refers everything outside national jurisdictional boundaries up to a global dispute resolution forum, which runs under what the community consider to be appropriate rules.
00:39:45.480 - 00:40:10.276, Speaker D: And I think that might be quite a good thing. Actually, it's not, particularly in my own interests. I'm a patent litigator. You're probably aware that Apple, Samsung, Google, the lot have been beating the hell out of each other for the last ten years over the technology under mobile phones. They're starting to realize that actually that probably wasn't a good thing to do and a really effective use of money. And they're now starting to put those disputes into arbitration. Instead, take them out of the court system.
00:40:10.276 - 00:40:14.390, Speaker D: Do away with the multi trillion dollar us litigation process.
00:40:22.220 - 00:40:37.948, Speaker B: I saw an advertisement when I got here that said, you can send a text message with the word claim in it to a particular phone number to get a personal injury lawyer. And I'll tell you, you guys here in the UK, you're actually ahead of us in the personal injury litigation space, because us lawyers don't do that.
00:40:38.034 - 00:40:51.536, Speaker D: We don't do it in patent litigation either. But not a bad idea, though. Maybe I should be putting that ad. So that's something I can see changing. I think it will have to come out of your rules. You'll have to make it happen, but.
00:40:51.718 - 00:41:41.164, Speaker C: It'S perfectly feasible before you go. I mean, that's one of the things that I find incredibly exciting, is as someone who spent many hours of my life in litigation and disputes, and I think that not necessarily my personal disputes and litigation, but is this movement and impulse to start finding ways to regulate ourselves and to resolve our own disputes. It's a taking back of ownership. It's this return to the commons and the idea that you can go to the village elders and they can solve your problem for you. And I was talking with someone the other day and saying, when you step back and you look at it to some degree, it's absurd that the state is the provider of dispute resolution. Why should it be? And obviously they fund it. So there are reasons.
00:41:41.164 - 00:41:49.350, Speaker C: But this ability that we have now to really move things back into our own control, I think is very exciting. So I would definitely echo that.
00:41:50.040 - 00:42:30.144, Speaker A: The only thing I was going to say is to move back to your original point about, would we see something like law of the sea, to regulate dows, to regulate blockchain based businesses? The answer is no, because, well, at least I don't think so. I can't imagine it in my personal opinion. I mean, the reason that we have law of the sea is because now the empire is over. Nobody owns it anymore. So we all had to come together and say, what should the laws of the high seas be? We don't have that problem with companies. Individual states have got their own territory and then say, look, if you're a company doing business in our particular sphere of influence, then we can set the rules by which you have to do that business. There's no real incentive for states to come together and to agree a joint set of rules for organizations that move between them.
00:42:30.144 - 00:43:09.870, Speaker A: Because the problem with blockchain based businesses is that they are, in a way beyond regulation. One of the real strengths that blockchain innovators say is behind blockchain businesses is that states can't interfere in the running of a blockchain. They can't reach in and amend and change the rules without the consent of the other actors in that distributed ledger system. So there's very little incentive for states to extend the protections and the benefits of legal regulation to a DAO when the DAO isn't essentially giving up half the bargain and saying, well, fine, we consent to and give you the power to regulate and change and modify the way that we do business. So I can't imagine a combined set of standards simply because there's no incentive for states to come up with it.
00:43:10.240 - 00:43:42.600, Speaker C: Well, I hope that's something that we can work on because that may be the reality. I think that. I am hopeful that, and there's the digital Finance and compliance association in Switzerland which is working on kind of a global, at least standards because this is supernatural. At the end of the day, where does this sit? We are a global group of people. But the states do have an interest in terms of where it touches them, taxes, et cetera.
00:43:44.460 - 00:43:44.776, Speaker B: Sure.
00:43:44.798 - 00:43:53.740, Speaker A: But don't get me wrong. I think the idea of international arbitration and specialist international arbitration forums for daos will almost certainly catch on the minute that there's commercial implementation on a wide scale.
00:43:57.440 - 00:44:17.972, Speaker B: I've dealt with arbitration before and it's not always great. Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't. I think these are choices that people have to make. It's the same thing with the notion of peer to peer dispute resolution. Go back 5000 years ago, you had peer to peer dispute resolution. There's some places in the world where you still have it. I'm not saying we have a perfect system.
00:44:17.972 - 00:44:36.196, Speaker B: It's irredeemably broken for many people in many places. But the original peer to peer was. I wrote something, I'm quoting myself, which is probably a bad form. You stole my cow. I'm stealing it back. So not all peer to peer is great and not all arbitration. Arbitration between private parties.
00:44:36.196 - 00:45:16.704, Speaker B: Sometimes people give up a lot of rights. Sometimes a third party estate actor isn't such a bad thing. There are ways you could write a smart contract. I know someone has. There's a proposal that was recently published, the AMN, and they note the New York convention, which I think is actually very interesting. So you could certainly agree to private arbitration in a DAo or in a smart contract, and you could also acknowledge existing international law. But I don't know that there's a one size fits all rule.
00:45:16.704 - 00:45:17.828, Speaker B: I think I've said that.
00:45:17.914 - 00:45:35.420, Speaker C: Okay. All right, let's move on to smart contracts. Then again, just asking the big broad question, then, for all of you, can a smart contract function as a legal contract, and vice versa, can a legal contract function as a smart contract?
00:45:36.640 - 00:46:21.960, Speaker D: I can't see why not. All an english law contract requires is an offer, an acceptance of that offer, some sort of benefit, money or otherwise passing between the two parties and an intention that it be binding. And you can do that with a smart contract just as well as you can with a written or even an oral legal contract. So no reason why not. And as to can you transform a legal contract into a smart contract? I think there is absolutely no bar to that. When people talk about legal contracts, they are usually thinking about the 50 page documents that unfortunately, we lawyers are frequently required to produce by our wealthy clients. But a contract can be, I sell you my horse in response for 50 pounds.
00:46:21.960 - 00:46:35.200, Speaker D: Why can't you write that in code? I could write that in code. Well, 30 years ago, I could have written that in code. Today might well get it wrong, but somebody in this room could write that in code and it would be effective as a legal contract, no problem. Do you want to disagree?
00:46:35.620 - 00:46:36.530, Speaker B: I agree.
00:46:37.700 - 00:46:40.210, Speaker C: Does anyone disagree with that? No.
00:46:44.500 - 00:47:18.780, Speaker A: The one thing I'd say is that people, we often say, can a smart contract be a legal contract? And I think it's sort of OD to think of smart contracts as something which stand aside from legal contracts. They're really just a way of automating legal contracts in the same way as putting something into escrow and say, well, look, if the following things happen, give the thing that I've given to you, trusted third party to the other guy, really, that's just a way of automating a contract. We're not saying, can an escrow be a legal contract? So I'm all in favor of smart contracts. And yes, they can. Well, no, they can't be legal contracts, but they're a fantastic thing to sit alongside and supplement legal contracts in the way that we know them today.
00:47:18.930 - 00:47:36.130, Speaker C: So let's talk about some of the challenge, some of the issues then that come up around smart contracts. One is with pseudonymous or anonymous parties, how do you enforce the contracts under traditional contract law?
00:47:37.300 - 00:47:45.652, Speaker A: Well, we're back to the question of can you hunt the other guy down where our two welk store guys, can you employ a shabby man in a shabby raincoat to go figure out who this guy is?
00:47:45.786 - 00:48:21.810, Speaker C: Yes, I can. Okay, but let's talk about then, contract interpretation. Because one of the things that you see a lot of people talking about is the fact that you have the dry code and the wet code, and judges will look at the four corners of a contract and not beyond. So what are they going to be interpreting? How do they sit alongside each other, as you said, and which one is the operative contract and what will judge or a court look to in deciding what your intent and what the meaning of the contract is?
00:48:22.420 - 00:49:07.170, Speaker D: Again, I don't think there's a distinction really to be made there. If the legal contract is that the parties will do what it says in the smart contract, then, okay, the judge might not be able to read the smart contract for himself, but we can get one of you guys into court to tell him what it does. If there is any ambiguity, then the other party will get another one of you guys into court to say, it doesn't mean that, it means this. And the judge will have to test that and decide which he thinks is closer to the intention of the parties. You can perfectly well envisage a scenario where the dry code is incorporated in the contract as a schedule or an annex or just a reference, as long as it's unambiguous what it's being referred to, and they're all forming as a whole the one contract and you.
00:49:10.980 - 00:49:45.660, Speaker B: So I think right mean most, quote unquote smart contracts are, I'm quoting other people. I want to say the first person I heard say this was Casey Coleman. If somebody else came up with it first, I'm sorry, but they're not smart and they're not contracts. What most of them are, they're performance automation. And they are performance automation that if they work properly, a court will never have to evaluate. The part that a court has to evaluate is the off chain piece. So you might have a data structure that defines a contract and includes a variable, which is hash of the contract.
00:49:45.660 - 00:50:28.200, Speaker B: That's going to be a pdf, and it includes off chain obligations, like, it might define scope of work for brick and mortar project. It might include things like a definition of termination for convenience, termination for default. So the further away you get from things that are on chain, even though you're saying it's all on chain, but you've really just scanned a contract and you're referencing it. The things that are off chain are the things that are going to probably most likely involve a court, and a court is going to apply traditional rules of contract interpretation. Now, how that applies us to liability, inter say, between the parties, is kind of another ball of wax.
00:50:28.620 - 00:51:34.240, Speaker E: Yeah, I think the only thing I'd add to this line of conversation is, and it's picking up a point we made in the context of the dow, is if you just had a smart contract that was in code, that is not necessarily the entirety of your contract. And to take the example of the cow that you've sold for ten pounds or whatever the amount is, there may be other conditions that are implied into that by operation of law, and it might be that there was an understanding between the parties that it would be a certain type of cow, for example. So it's important to sort of keep that in mind that the law, in certain circumstances will imply additional terms into a contract, and the code itself may not be the entirety of the contract. Which is why, as lawyers, we instinctively think that, particularly when you're talking about what would traditionally be a 1020, 30 page document, that you would probably have still a natural language version of that contract sitting alongside the smart contract that is performing aspects of that contract.
00:51:34.980 - 00:52:21.640, Speaker C: One of the things that we were talking about beforehand was the idea of these actually being flexible. And so one of the concerns is, is there a conflict between these immutable, self executing contracts and what exists in contract law now, which is the ability to change them? The assumption is that you know what you want and you know what the future is going to be, and you know what you're going to want, and you're putting that into a smart contract, and then it just runs. And that is, in many cases, going to be a faulty assumption. We don't actually know what we want. I think Vitalik had raised that as a concern when he was presenting at the Ethereum meetup. And how do we deal with that in the context of smart contracts?
00:52:21.720 - 00:53:36.020, Speaker E: Well, I think the way I look at it is, how do I deal with that as a lawyer now, when I'm drafting a contract, particularly long term contracts, if it's a shareholders agreement or if it's a supply agreement that's going to be lasting for a multi year period, the reality is, no matter how good a lawyer you are, no matter how good a draftsperson you are, you are not going to anticipate every possible eventuality that might arise in relation to that contract. There might be, for example, an aspect of that contract which becomes illegal or unenforceable in the future. For example, if sanctions were introduced and you were doing business with a counterparty that was based in a sanctioned country, it might be illegal and you might need to change it. You might simply want to renegotiate the terms of the contract in several years time, that both parties agree that something needs to change, or parties realize that there's just an error in the drafting that needs to be fixed. The reality is, when you've got a long term contract, there will frequently need to be changes to it. So I think if we're talking about long term smart contracts, I think you need to build in as a design feature the ability to amend the contract. Otherwise, the contract, if it's a long term, 1, may not be fit for purpose.
00:53:37.580 - 00:53:39.050, Speaker B: How are we doing on time?
00:53:40.700 - 00:53:44.090, Speaker C: Chris, how are we doing on time? Another ten minutes.
00:53:47.920 - 00:53:48.700, Speaker B: What he said.
00:53:48.770 - 00:54:09.250, Speaker C: Okay, very good. Coming back to liability, then. That's a favorite topic of lawyers. If there is a mistake in the execution of a smart contract, whether it's due to a bug or whether it's due to human error in the programming, who's liable for that?
00:54:10.500 - 00:55:22.596, Speaker D: So, looking at the smart contract as an executable part of the contract, if it's a mistake, it doesn't do what it's meant to do under the contract. It simply isn't an effective contract. You need to rewrite the code if it's causing loss. And I think you referred to some gaming app where a whole load of funds were permanently lost. Somebody's going to look at, how did that bug get into that code? Who is it? Who was responsible for that mistake? Were they so responsible that the law of negligence is going to hold them up and say, actually, we're going to come after you, programmer, because the result has been this loss that you should have been able to prevent had you done your job properly. And then there's an argument, well, how possible was it to foresee that fault? Was that something that a competent programmer could have done better? Or is this so abstruse and so complex that actually there was nobody who could have executed it properly? In which case, perhaps the parties have been over ambitious in the code they've tried to produce, but it's going to come back to the standard law of breach of contract if somebody deliberately introduced an error into the code so that their counterparty lost out in some way, or the law of negligence, if it's.
00:55:22.788 - 00:55:32.492, Speaker C: A pure human mistake, and just to remind everybody the standards there for the law of negligence would essentially be an industry standard. As to the standard of care, what.
00:55:32.626 - 00:55:35.870, Speaker D: Reasonable program, reasonable programmer, if there is such a thing.
00:55:38.160 - 00:56:09.684, Speaker C: Okay, let's touch briefly on what we think the impact of blockchain may be on the legal industry. And this is, again, interesting for us and interesting for me, but I think it could potentially be interesting for the entrepreneurs in the audience to think about how might the legal profession change, and what opportunities exist there. So, do you guys have any views of the future and what the law practice and law firms look like in the world of the future?
00:56:09.802 - 00:56:49.140, Speaker A: Well, the thing that really worries me as a lawyer, and this is purely selfish stuff, the thing that really worries me is AI taking my job rather than smart contracts killing me off. Now, I'm sure when we've met before, you've talked about lawyers becoming coders in the future, and I'm sure we will, in the same way that university professors are coders now, physicists are coders now. Everyone has to use computers in their job, and I suspect that lawyers are one of the last holdouts. But that is going to change. The more that people want self executing contracts that are sort of formed, executed, and performed entirely online, the more they're going to want to be able to go to a law firm and say, look, why can't you just provide me with the written paper version and my self executing schedule to it? So I'm fairly sure that there's a coding class in my future, and probably a refresher course in yours.
00:56:49.480 - 00:56:50.964, Speaker C: Take note. B nine.
00:56:51.082 - 00:57:22.720, Speaker D: No, I have to say, when I first moved from science into law, and I'd been trying to generate a model of the earth's magnetic field for some years in Fortran 77, if anybody here can remember that. But the first thing that occurred to me when I went into these classes that were just about rules upon rules upon rules about special cases, is, why hasn't somebody just coded this? Why do we have to have all of these case references and names when you can just have if, but then clauses coming out of your ears? It's going to happen. But luckily, at that point, I'm going to be old enough. I'm just going to retire.
00:57:25.940 - 00:57:50.490, Speaker B: I don't worry about augmented intelligence or AI, but I think that ought to be more of a concern for big law firms. And I imagine a future where I don't think law firms are going to go away. There's some licensing issues, some professional responsibility issues. You could say it's guild protectionism or monopolies. It's a different subject altogether. But there are some reasons to have professionals do certain things. I think.
00:57:50.490 - 00:58:19.330, Speaker B: I imagine a time in the future when people are going to hire law firms based on the AI that they have. And you'll hear somebody say, I hate that firm. They're such a pain. But they thought about this Norton rose. They thought about know early on and they've been feeding that AI for years. And because AI is not sue generis, right, different ais are going to be different like people. And I know we're talking far into the future for more sophisticated work, but I think that's starting to happen now.
00:58:19.330 - 00:58:38.008, Speaker B: And blockchain, I think that may be part of it. I would agree with you, too. Law, when I started to relearn how to code, so similar classes, inheritance, very similar principles in law and in software development, a lot of testing, actually. That would be cool.
00:58:38.094 - 00:58:47.764, Speaker C: A lot of people in the crowd may be cringing at the suggestion there's a lot of similarities between law and coders. But I'll take that. Go ahead, Sean.
00:58:47.812 - 00:58:51.804, Speaker E: No, because I know we're pressed for time. I agree with what's been said.
00:58:51.922 - 00:59:17.910, Speaker C: Okay. Wow, amazing. Okay, so I want to ask a couple of quick questions and looking for quick answers, just kind of lightning round kind of answers. And if you don't have an answer, that's fine, any of you do, what do you think will be the most important legal issue to deal with in the blockchain space in the next year?
00:59:19.880 - 00:59:49.724, Speaker A: That was quick. Look, I think that the obvious thing coming down the line is the general data protection regulation. It's all new privacy and data protection regulation. It comes directly from Europe. It'll harmonize EU, and for the first time ever, european citizens will have a sort of codified right to be forgotten, a right to erasure of their data. And that's really quite difficult in a system which relies on permanent, immutable records of every transaction that's ever happened on a system which aren't shared just between the two people that had that transaction. But everybody in the block, how do we deal with that? Well, we'll see.
00:59:49.922 - 00:59:51.560, Speaker C: Do you have any thoughts?
00:59:51.720 - 01:00:15.780, Speaker A: I've got a few, but I'm not going to give you them for free. No, that's a lie. There's some caveats to it, so we will be fine. There are caveats of that right to be forgotten and that right to erasure. And it's just about framing the contracts that we enter into when we sell blockchain software to people to make sure that we're doing all that we can to flag those caveats up and make sure that users have consented to permanent processing of their data by a wide range of individuals.
01:00:16.700 - 01:00:24.760, Speaker C: Okay, and finally, what parting message would each of you like to leave with our audience tonight?
01:00:26.620 - 01:00:49.672, Speaker A: We come in peace. I'm not someone. A lot of this sounds like I was reading you the riot act and saying, look to bed, no supper, stop this blockchain nonsense. It's not that we believe in, it's the future. It's not a panacea for everything, but it's going to change the way that we do an awful lot of business. And the things that lawyers have to offer you is, as ever, protecting the ip and what you build so that it's valuable. And then when you sell or when you license this stuff, making sure that's effective and that you stay safe.
01:00:49.672 - 01:00:53.100, Speaker A: Don't see us as a sort of set of chains and bindings. See us as a seatbelt.
01:00:53.400 - 01:00:54.150, Speaker C: It.
01:00:56.120 - 01:01:28.812, Speaker D: One of the things that I think this community dislikes about law and lawyers is it's also complicated. We make everything so complicated and that makes it expensive. The reason the law is complicated is because over the last, say, two and a half thousand years of experience, we have been through a lot of different ways in which things can go wrong. And the law has had to add another subroutine, another line of code to deal with that exceptional. So law is actually a good friend to this community. Setting off. We can see where some of the horrible rocks that you face are going to come up.
01:01:28.812 - 01:01:50.470, Speaker D: We can possibly help you guide around them. I would say the two things that you really need to think about before you start doing anything are which jurisdiction are you going to be in and what law is it that you want to be governing you? Because if you don't even know what the law is, you can ask any number of lawyers, but they won't be able to answer the what if question. So those are the two most important things to take away.
01:01:51.640 - 01:02:19.230, Speaker B: So the biggest thing that's going to happen in the next year, powered by the blockchain, is blockchain is going to save the whales. That's my first observation. Anybody see the article? No, it was an article in Coindesk. Number two, I would agree. Basically, we come in peace. I mean, at least the lawyers here, I think a lot of the technology is very cool and we're kind of like your mother or your father. We're just worry, that's all.
01:02:19.230 - 01:02:21.680, Speaker B: It's well intended.
01:02:24.020 - 01:02:44.260, Speaker E: I think the additional thing I would add is that lawyers can also act as an interface with regulators and legislators and help educate them, encourage them to think about policy formation and potential changes to legislation which may help the development and evolution of this industry.
01:02:45.500 - 01:03:00.430, Speaker C: Great. Thank you very much. I think we're going to open it to questions now. And can someone take my mic for the people asking the question over here at the back?
01:03:01.040 - 01:03:17.520, Speaker H: So there's a very conservative approach that I've heard discussed for doing an interface between smart contracts and daos in the real world, which is just put the register of shares of the company on the blockchain. Any comments on whether that seems feasible and adequate and what kind of changes.
01:03:17.590 - 01:03:19.856, Speaker F: Would be required to either law or.
01:03:19.878 - 01:04:06.450, Speaker H: Regulation to enable that? I think it will sort of typical lawyers answer. It's going to depend on which jurisdiction you're talking about. The putting of a record of the registered members online. That seems possible. I think there are other aspects of english corporate law that would make it difficult for a dow, as you sort of envisage it now, to be, to sort of fit fully within an english corporate structure. I think you'd need to work through that very carefully and think about all of the requirements for sort of compliance of english corporate law and being a company. This is what I was talking about when I was saying that.
01:04:06.450 - 01:04:19.590, Speaker H: I think if you look further into the future and you talk to legislators, what may happen is that legislators will respond to the demand for this by adjusting corporate law to permit that to happen.
01:04:21.400 - 01:04:27.844, Speaker G: My question back is, I suspect you don't think that's very interesting or necessarily a good use.
01:04:28.042 - 01:04:46.110, Speaker H: I think it's an adequate starting point for much of what people do, and that becomes regularized. We can see how it goes with the other. Okay, we'll take a question at the back.
01:04:47.360 - 01:05:21.610, Speaker F: My question is for Lorna. Specifically, you mentioned that some of these contractual provisions when you were studying the law, some of these can just be encoded quite simply. Where do you see the limits of that? You get a lot of these people talking about derivative contract platforms and smart contract platforms and bond coupon automation, all those kinds of things. Where do you see the limits? Obviously there are certain things are quite easy to automate, but something people are saying are impossible or very difficult. Where's the difficult and impossible for you?
01:05:22.380 - 01:05:56.470, Speaker I: That is a very good question. Those are all security. They're all fairly simple sequence of logical steps. If this happens, then that payout takes place. That's codeable. On the other hand, I was reading an article about tax. I can't remember where I was reading it, but somebody is trying to code code law and they were talking about an employment contract, and their employment contract was essentially, if it's Friday, pay the employee $500.
01:05:56.470 - 01:06:24.060, Speaker I: On Thursday, the employee stands up which says the cubicle has shot the person next door. What happens if they've been trolling somebody else in the organization because they know something about their past history? There are all sorts of complicated what ifs that go into a range of different kind of contracts. You can see each of those as possible clauses, but you're going to end up with the same kind of impossible long contract that lawyers write in the first place. So where to benefit?
01:06:33.750 - 01:07:03.230, Speaker F: For example, you're talking about dividend rights. You're talking about rights on breaking up of the Dow and stuff like that. They're really operative provisions that are going to be applicable in 99.9% of cases. Obviously there are the what ifs that are hard to code for and that would be the impossibles and stuff like that. But to what extent do you think that we can cover 80% to 90% of all scenarios with an automated system and let's just run with it and see how it goes? Do you think that's a good approach to take?
01:07:03.380 - 01:07:56.942, Speaker I: I think that's where we'll get to. I think there's such a thing as trying to run the OrC, and I think starting with the small easy bits and getting those right and finding out what goes wrong when they go wrong, working out the fixes for that before we try to scale up to the more complicated and more nuanced positions. But personally, I think at the moment, we in the UK and in the US operate on largely oil contracts for most of our daily life, and we don't write them down even at all. All of that level of contract where there is a reason to write it down can be done in code. There will be a small exceptional category at the top end that really is never worth doing because they're saying you're not. But I hope, I think a lot of the stuff that corporate lawyers push out is actually much the same time and time again with a few tweaks and whistles added. Ultimately that is going to be Tony's case.
01:07:56.942 - 01:07:57.760, Speaker I: Why not?
01:08:00.450 - 01:08:34.566, Speaker F: I just want to make one quick point. You talked through a group that you said, what are the limits of contracts? What can't we do? Well, it's really easy in a world where we're thinking about sort of contracts in banks, things like cfds, which are just, if there's this movement on a financial market, trigger a payment yeah, easy. You can put all of that into a smart contract today. Not difficult. Think more in terms of something like a software development agreement where we're building a piece of software which is going to do some stuff in the future. There's a specification for that. One of the key things that I spent my life doing, people pay me to do it for some awful reason, is writing these contracts which you've developed with some wiggle room in what they produce.
01:08:34.566 - 01:08:55.394, Speaker F: So if the color is a little bit off, well, that's fine. And we talk about, we insert words, always read and look to get materially in line with the specification. If you've made reasonable efforts to fulfill this, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Computers can't make those judgment calls. At least they can't today. I don't know, maybe we'll have phenomenal AI in ten years time. We can make these judgment calls and be an arbiter, and then we can smart contract it.
01:08:55.394 - 01:09:13.480, Speaker F: Right now we can't do that. And those are some of the real key provisions in a contract. So imagine your indemnity if something goes wrong. We'll talk about, we have clauses in indemnities making people make reasonable efforts not to wrap up losses, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. That stuff absolutely critical in contract nowhere, building a smart contract at this point in time.
01:09:15.390 - 01:09:41.170, Speaker G: The thing that I think is very hard now is verification of off chain performance and taking it past software development. I spent some time as a construction lawyer, delivery of goods, substantial completion of a structure. I'm not saying it's not possible eventually, but verifying, validating that performance, that it's.
01:09:43.430 - 01:09:44.626, Speaker F: Contract to do what they were supposed.
01:09:44.648 - 01:10:01.080, Speaker G: To do, I think that's most people would agree that's going to be hard. Are you asking me that question?
01:10:01.530 - 01:10:04.794, Speaker F: Surely Oracle solved the problems that the three of you have spoken about.
01:10:04.912 - 01:10:12.620, Speaker G: So I love the word, I actually love the word oracle because.
01:10:14.610 - 01:10:15.326, Speaker F: I think.
01:10:15.428 - 01:10:56.658, Speaker G: What an oracle as it's used actually does is the opposite of an old fashioned oracle, which was kind of a black box. You go and you ask the oracle and it gives you an answer and you don't know why. So you can use something like weather service to provide data for a cat bond to determine whether a hurricane hit the coast at a certain speed or an earthquake hit someplace at a certain point in the Richter scale and automatically transfer funds. I'm not sure that there is. I'll call it an oracle, though it's actually not a term I necessarily love. I would call it maybe trusted data source. I'm sure that you can find somebody will build a trusted data source to verify substantial completion of the structure.
01:10:56.658 - 01:11:16.766, Speaker G: But has anybody done that yet? Maybe they have. You can use IoT technology, you're building something, you have a color and you're not sure if it's within the tolerance.
01:11:16.798 - 01:11:19.250, Speaker H: That the contract or the smart contract has defined.
01:11:20.150 - 01:11:22.194, Speaker G: You bring the grand jury, you have.
01:11:22.232 - 01:11:24.306, Speaker H: Maybe defined in your contract that you.
01:11:24.328 - 01:11:25.186, Speaker G: Can bring a grand jury.
01:11:25.218 - 01:11:28.182, Speaker H: They're going to vote, they're going to see the building and they're going to.
01:11:28.236 - 01:11:32.514, Speaker G: Use their crypto signature to basically vote.
01:11:32.562 - 01:11:36.202, Speaker H: On the color and they're going to win and your contract is going to roll out.
01:11:36.256 - 01:11:45.386, Speaker G: So there is a lot of other, it's not machine versus human assessment. It's a contract that products what you.
01:11:45.408 - 01:11:46.634, Speaker H: Have decided that you're going to use.
01:11:46.672 - 01:11:48.620, Speaker G: So I think that's really cool.
01:11:50.670 - 01:11:52.490, Speaker F: I think the main thing is everything.
01:11:52.560 - 01:11:56.318, Speaker H: With smart contract is going to be user dream. I think that's the key.
01:11:56.484 - 01:11:59.230, Speaker F: The wisdom of the crowd is taking over everywhere.
01:11:59.810 - 01:12:02.354, Speaker H: If people want to be disruptive, they can.
01:12:02.552 - 01:12:33.190, Speaker F: If company wants to react, they can. But in general, Uber, Airbnb and the rest of it, trust in general e reputation, things are going to be completely disrupted by people that embrace user focus and Ux from digital monthly beauty food tools, but also useful tools for the wisdom of the crowd in general. We're embracing a global planet and we have now global tool to deliver those platforms.
01:12:36.090 - 01:13:52.744, Speaker H: Interesting caveats of jurisdiction and then great answer. Were there particular jurisdiction? And I always wondered about the whole argument about limiting liability or getting away from liability. I think the only use case I can really think about becomes a useful thing is actually government, which is limited liability. So your rules and courts come under a government, whichever government is. But I think the only actual use case for a Dow is for a sort of supergovernment with limited liability. I don't know whether you can comment on whether that is a viable use case in a lot of this technology. Last four years, five years I've been involved, we end up sort of talking and discussing and debating things that are really not about here and now.
01:13:52.744 - 01:14:00.670, Speaker H: It's about sometime in the future about some huge thing, and there's creative stuff we need to do and get an hour.
01:14:08.800 - 01:14:32.964, Speaker I: I think that is a form of utopia that may or may not ever arrive. In the meantime, these cases for Dows are going to have to be much simpler, much more immediate. And unfortunately, they're going to have to interact with the national legal arrangements which are already in place in one way or another. So for sure that would be a lovely outcome for budget and all agree.
01:14:33.002 - 01:14:34.836, Speaker F: What the rules of the new are.
01:14:34.858 - 01:14:38.488, Speaker I: Going to be, but probably not in.
01:14:38.494 - 01:14:49.070, Speaker H: My point of the Dow isn't just about huge things. Yes, just borrow down.
01:14:51.120 - 01:14:51.870, Speaker B: Right.
01:14:52.880 - 01:14:59.980, Speaker G: One of the points, one of the things it can do is automate governance.
01:15:00.060 - 01:15:01.356, Speaker F: And make it transparent.
01:15:01.468 - 01:15:13.044, Speaker G: So I would tend to agree with you that we certainly live in a time when it would be nice to have guarantee that things that are supposed to happen in your governance system, some.
01:15:13.082 - 01:15:16.500, Speaker F: Guarantee that they can actually happen, and being able to see those things transparently.
01:15:19.400 - 01:15:22.950, Speaker G: Seems like a heavy lift of other governments to agree with that.
01:15:24.120 - 01:15:29.076, Speaker F: Okay, question about, please. We sort of see from the panel.
01:15:29.108 - 01:15:33.412, Speaker H: That a lot of the legal issues that you seem to be worried about are more in relation to AI.
01:15:33.476 - 01:15:34.328, Speaker F: But I think we've had a bit.
01:15:34.334 - 01:15:38.456, Speaker H: Of a discussion here in relation to smart contracts and the automation of those contracts.
01:15:38.568 - 01:15:41.144, Speaker F: So my question is, to the extent.
01:15:41.192 - 01:15:59.376, Speaker H: That a legal contract in english law can be only made up of four things, and you could potentially put that into code, to what extent could you imagine a platform that creates a smart contract, that is a legal contract, and therefore starts to nudge away at law firms and starts to think market share within that, as an area in the.
01:15:59.398 - 01:16:24.460, Speaker G: US, you have to worry about the unauthorized practice of law and you'd have 50 state bars to deal with. And don't hate me for saying it, I'm just telling you that from a regulatory standpoint, some state bar is probably going to stop you before you get too far down that road. So you may have to distinguish between pax and law, offering legal advice and some form of performance automation. Again, don't kill the messenger. That's the way I see it. From a US standpoint.
01:16:29.040 - 01:16:48.852, Speaker H: I think what you're really describing there is the sort of the smart contract equivalent of a very simple paper based contract that you might print off off the Internet, for example. So I don't review that as a competitive threat for law firms. There are many other things that are competitive threats, but not that I have a question.
01:16:48.906 - 01:17:36.912, Speaker F: So basically, from my understanding, someone from the DPO, the Dao community, can sue the entire system. Because most of the DAO token holders, they want something token, they use this token to slot it. For example, they want slotit to make some locks, and people use digital currencies to pay those locks and eventually to make some profits for them. And let's say locket doesn't make any profits and they want to sue the deal. The entire thing. Or someone from the community wants to sue someone. This is what we are taking.
01:17:36.912 - 01:18:11.870, Speaker F: In that case, I believe they can hedge. They can sort of make a bet that we don't get any return on investment from socket. They will win some money from the debt. So they don't have to sue anyone because they win from the bet. If they don't get any investment mine, if they do get investment mine, then they have to sue. So you can have a case where there's no need for anyone to sue anyone. What about that?
01:18:14.400 - 01:18:16.830, Speaker H: It depends what this bet is. I mean, if it's insurance.
01:18:17.280 - 01:18:18.030, Speaker F: Yeah.
01:18:20.160 - 01:18:22.924, Speaker H: Requirement. But insurance company was prepared to sound on the other.
01:18:22.962 - 01:18:24.380, Speaker F: No, not the smartphone.
01:18:26.260 - 01:18:31.312, Speaker H: But who is providing this insurance? Someone's got to stand on the other side. Yeah, someone's got to be on the other side.
01:18:31.366 - 01:18:32.168, Speaker F: Or exchange.
01:18:32.204 - 01:18:51.204, Speaker H: Like the cryptocurrency change, basically it requires there to be people prepared to be on the other side of the bet. And it also requires the members of the Dow to be actively hedging every single eventuality, which is places quite a burden on the members of the Dow.
01:18:51.252 - 01:19:10.690, Speaker F: Yeah, you might think, I don't see members from the Dow because I feel like they are very calm and big wanted. Thanks for your time.
01:19:13.620 - 01:19:55.020, Speaker H: Now we have this paternal and maternal connection. I'm happy to address this question. So the first point was regarding initially on the first subject, about Dow ownership and actually chasing people down, which essentially might just be a public address which isn't linked to any realistic. How do you think someone would actually find someone at the end of the day, how do I find someone to go and actually get that money off? Secondly, second point, do you think possibly we might be moving into a period of simplification of law contracts that have less ambiguity because they have to be written in such a way that they can be executed on the smart contracts, excluding it off contracts they could use like pdfs, et cetera.
01:19:55.360 - 01:20:02.336, Speaker G: So, number one, I'm not speaking about any particular Dao, but you could always go to Reddit or GitHub, see if.
01:20:02.358 - 01:20:06.176, Speaker F: You can find somebody and start there. It depends, right?
01:20:06.198 - 01:20:10.172, Speaker G: I mean, sure, maybe there's a way to be completely anonymous with the contact.
01:20:10.246 - 01:20:12.470, Speaker F: Address, but there are certain ways to track something.
01:20:14.120 - 01:20:55.356, Speaker G: I don't know. There are probably a lot of programmers in the room. I mean, the code doesn't always work, right? And sometimes you have packages that conflict. I happen to like Ruby, and those gems don't always work together. So does code become less ambiguous? I mean, is it possible for a public address to be unambiguous, I guess. But one of your questions was, do we think we're moving into a world where legal contracts will be less ambiguous because they're written in software code? I mean, my own view is I love software and I love code and I wish I was better at it. It makes life easier.
01:20:55.356 - 01:21:08.070, Speaker G: But I don't necessarily find it any more unambiguous and it's harder for most people to read. So that answered your question.
01:21:11.900 - 01:21:54.676, Speaker I: I just want to reiterate, the law is full of all these exceptional, weird, amazing cases because people do exceptional, weird and amazing things. Okay, maybe once a century, but still things come up that you are never going to have thought of. In a coding contract, there are always going to be particular circumstances, black swan events. Events. Things that change the nature of the contract or the nature of the relationship, because I'm completely assured this is all about relationships. So by all means, the contract components that are pure executables are already pretty unambiguous. When the share price rises above $2, this happens.
01:21:54.676 - 01:22:08.616, Speaker I: That isn't where the problems with contract arise. It seems like the reasonable test or substantial completion, or in my area, somebody take the. Substantially the whole of the copyright work. Well, substantially the whole, that's what we.
01:22:08.638 - 01:22:09.640, Speaker F: Ask about all the time.
01:22:09.710 - 01:22:17.020, Speaker I: And code isn't going to help us particularly slow down. The oracle plan is a good one. Question is, who do you have as your jury?
01:22:21.280 - 01:22:22.860, Speaker H: They make a recommendation.
01:22:25.920 - 01:23:48.148, Speaker F: So we've been talking about AI and smart contract. So my question is like, what would happen if the AI, like a personal assistant, like Siri or something, that actually creates the smart contract and then rendered out? So basically we can think about the IoT device. You buy an IoT device and then there's a personal assistant on the IoT device and you plug it and this Iot device starts creating a contract. Is it the owner of the IoT device or the personal assistant? Or is it you because you actually asked the question or you actually didn't ask the question, because maybe the air just listened to your phone and then you were basically walking the street and then just start creating a contract on you. Well, in the event that Skynet becomes aware, and the way that you describe that, the real answer is that the liability situation will be spelled out by a compact web of contracts that you will have entered into. At the point you get your automated personal assistant new access to your device. There will be endless viewers that some awful, awful lawyer like me, who spent hours drafting, telling you that the maker that software isn't liable for any of this stuff, and the devices saying they're not liable for any of this stuff, and the other party will say, it's not liable, and eventually you'll just have to go to court to argue it, because there's an argument that everyone in that chain is liable.
01:23:48.148 - 01:24:06.024, Speaker F: It's you for giving me automated assistants on ability to form these contracts. No, it's the device maker having a device that doesn't work with the automated assistant that made these contracts. It's the programmer of the automated assistant. Let it go rogue and do this crazy stuff. We could throw blame and liability everywhere. We pay lawyers millions. It'd be incredible.
01:24:06.024 - 01:24:07.150, Speaker F: I'd love it.
01:24:07.840 - 01:24:08.988, Speaker G: But the point is, there'll be a.
01:24:08.994 - 01:24:17.440, Speaker F: Very complex work of contracts, and it's just impossible without recruiting an army of gray seated vampires like us to argue for you, I'm afraid.
01:24:18.660 - 01:24:21.632, Speaker H: Okay, we're on the last home stretch now.
01:24:21.766 - 01:24:23.410, Speaker F: Last two questions.
01:24:23.780 - 01:24:42.440, Speaker H: Chris, a quick comment about earlier. Someone said, this is a robot, yet there's no people behind it. But that's not the case. And certainly in the big town that we know about, people vote. It's not an autonomous robot. There are people making the decisions. Anyway, that wasn't my main point.
01:24:42.440 - 01:25:12.230, Speaker H: I assume that no Dow contracts have actually been in place yet. Now's a good time for them to actually, when they specify the first contracts, that they also specify the jurisdiction where they're going to be interpreted. There's no such thing. But they would pick a friendly jurisdiction where the law will be, I don't know, somewhere where privacy is respected and bearish shares are allowed or whatever. It's going to be something like that.
01:25:14.840 - 01:25:15.492, Speaker F: Absolutely.
01:25:15.626 - 01:25:23.160, Speaker I: Start from the beginning, giving as much care as you can. Jurisdiction law, there will still be things that go wrong, so they'll be less complicated.
01:25:25.260 - 01:25:27.290, Speaker F: Okay, we're on the last question.
01:25:31.020 - 01:26:48.058, Speaker H: So the panel talks about the design of smart contracts, enjoying lessons, development of traditional contracts, and looking at the design features that have evolved over the current. I wonder what the panel think of remedies within traditional contracts, whether the right to break a prompt, whether the right to breach an agreement is a positive design feature. Traditional contracts in smart contracts, and the reason why I say that is that if you look at, say, contractual disputes in a commercial contract, when people go to court, they're not in a position to actually compel performance. What they're actually trying to obtain is compensation, and it's compensation for loss and the remedies around future contract. In many ways, they provide a complete disintempet against breaking promises and it seems like that is a deliberate design feature, traditional contractual. And I was just wondering what the panel think about that, whether that's actually a positive design feature that has a place within smart contract.
01:26:48.154 - 01:27:43.458, Speaker G: Hadley versus Baxter, first case, american lawyers reading contract feels lost expectancy. Let's say you and I enter into a contract for 1000 widgets, and I assume the widgets are going to cost a buck, and it's a supply contract or an output contract, but in a year and a half, the price of widgets has gone up to $3. Much contract law actually by default, addresses that situation, may give me the right to breach, and we'll define a legal remedy for that. We also have forced majeure clauses, which deal with intervening events out of the control of parties. Contracts might also have termination for convenience or termination for performance clauses that specify grounds on which. I'm taking that from the construction context. But if you look at AIA contracts, biddock contracts, agency contracts, consensus contracts, there are all of these wonderful families of standard form contracts out there.
01:27:43.458 - 01:28:01.202, Speaker G: They will address those things. I think you're right. It is absolutely a design feature. The ability to voluntarily breach a contract. Also in the services context, it's prominently in the US. The right to breach a services contract is protected by the 13th Amendment. So it's designed feature.
01:28:01.202 - 01:28:02.680, Speaker G: That's a wonderful question.
01:28:06.250 - 01:28:47.590, Speaker H: I take a different view. I don't think it is a design feature. I think it's just a recognition of reality. It's going to happen, and subject to what I'm about to say, there's very limited ability to actually compel someone without using force to perform the contract, and they may breach it. Now, of course, mechanisms have been developed over the course of time, so you could, for example, put money into escrow to ensure that money does get delivered when it's supposed to be delivered. But I think your fundamental point you're making, I don't think it's a design feature. It's just a recognition of reality that you can't compel people to do something.
01:28:47.590 - 01:29:42.040, Speaker H: So just on that point, if it isn't a design feature, then one would think that the primary remedy there's a breach of contract, is that where the breach of contract results in the party that breaks the promise making a profit, all of those profits should be discouraged. The breaking of the promise should be treated as a wrong, and they should be restitution. But actually, that isn't the primary remedy in english law. It's about compensation for the loss that you suffer. And it seems to me that if that is the primary remedy. And there are limitations on the loss that you can recover because of, for example, rules on mitigation, rules on remoteness, that actually there is some design in that. Because if the purpose was to in all situation try and compel performance or to achieve the outcome performance, then you would think that the primary remedy would be reverse of unjust and to treat the breach of promises of wrong.
01:29:44.650 - 01:29:47.240, Speaker G: Distinction between equity and law.
01:29:48.970 - 01:30:02.358, Speaker I: I think you're just going too deep into the law here. We can all come up with a number of statistics which the law has to address. The concept that the basic is just basing and loss. It isn't. It depends on the circumstances. There are lots of mechanisms you can.
01:30:02.384 - 01:30:03.374, Speaker F: Invoke to do that.
01:30:03.492 - 01:30:10.782, Speaker I: That's kind of why I was saying let's run before we can walk in coding smart contracts, because if you try to cover the whole penalty of everything.
01:30:10.836 - 01:30:12.286, Speaker F: The law can do for every situation.
01:30:12.388 - 01:30:22.094, Speaker I: From day one, it's going to be a mess. Let's work out what we need and implement fixes as we get there in the way that the health has evolved.
01:30:22.142 - 01:30:22.740, Speaker F: Because.
01:30:26.520 - 01:30:29.428, Speaker H: And with that, I will thank.
01:30:29.514 - 01:30:31.540, Speaker F: The audience, I will thank Stuart, Mark.
01:30:31.610 - 01:30:36.920, Speaker H: And most particularly, I will thank the panel very much. Terrifying.
