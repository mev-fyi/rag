00:00:16.890 - 00:00:57.978, Speaker A: Hi, I'm Stefan Tuhl, and today I want to take you through the gorgeous dashboard that we've put together to represent the health of the Ethereum network. So a couple of very important things. First of all, you will not appear on the dashboard, even if you're running an Ethereum node, unless you add yourself to this dashboard. I've put a link in the description of this video that explains how to add yourself, and then, and only then, will you see your node displayed on the dashboard. I'm going to take you through all the meanings of those KPIs that you're seeing on the screen flashing sort of quite rapidly. First and foremost, at the top left we have best block. Best block is quite simply the latest block.
00:00:57.978 - 00:01:43.850, Speaker A: And then next to that we have the number of uncles. So the first number you'll see there's two numbers here, zero over seven. In this case, zero means the current number of uncles for the current block. And seven is the number of uncles combined in the last 50 blocks. If you're wondering what uncles are, uncles are just like blocks, but they're still blocks, and they're included into the longest chain to increase its security. And people who mine uncles, although they won't get the gas expended in that particular block, they will get part, not all of it, but part of the static block reward. I think it's 31 over 32 of the static block reward per uncle, so it's not negligible and it's definitely worth mining.
00:01:43.850 - 00:02:18.530, Speaker A: Then we have. When was the last block? So if everything goes well, we have a twelve second block time target on Ethereum. If everything goes well, we should be at twelve second. Now we're looking at the dashboard towards the end of May, when I recorded this video. So we're still in the Olympic test phase. You can see it varies quite wildly between block times of two, 3 seconds, two block times, just like now, going into 20 to 25 seconds. Something that will normalize itself over time as the network become healthier.
00:02:18.530 - 00:02:46.142, Speaker A: Obviously, if you're within the twelve second block time range, you'll see that the display here will be in green, whereas if it goes over, you'll see it turning yellow, then orange, then red, and so on. And this is a color scheme that's used across the dashboard. Green is good, red is bad. Simple. Next to it, to its right, we have the average block time. That's the average block time in the last 64 block. And the moment, 9 seconds.
00:02:46.142 - 00:03:28.990, Speaker A: I think we're doing quite well right now. We also have, to its right, the average network hash rate. So the hash rate, interestingly, is actually a calculated number. If you look at the Javascript on the page, you'll find that this is a number that was calculated by taking the current difficulty, which is to its right here. That's 10 billion divided by the average block time of the last 64 block. That gives you the network hash rate. And using that same calculation you can actually derive how often you're going to get a winning block on Ethereum based on the hash power of your mining rig.
00:03:28.990 - 00:04:17.194, Speaker A: Again, this is something that I'll link in the description of this video. So below that we have a list of further KPIs number of active nodes 36 over 32. So that means that in the entire history of the dashboard, 42 nodes declared themselves as active and 36 are currently active. This will change as the number of nodes that make use of the dashboard increases. We probably will want to limit that second number to maybe all the nodes that were on the network in the last 24 hours or the last week or something of that nature, in order to keep the numbers manageable. Next to it we have gas price. Gas price is the minimum gas price paid in the current best block.
00:04:17.194 - 00:04:53.334, Speaker A: So you just saw it changed briefly from Tenzabo, which I believe is the current default on most miners, to one way. So that means there's a miner somewhere that decided to include transactions that were requesting to pay only a single way per gas, and in this case it went through and it was a mining block. So there you go. The minimum gas price paid in the last block was one way. We then have next to it the page latency. So the stats dashboard isn't magical, it's basically a web app. It's currently located, I think, on the WS west coast.
00:04:53.334 - 00:05:45.718, Speaker A: This could change over time, but at the moment it's on the west coast, and 85 milliseconds that it's displayed here is the entire time it took to render the page as well as download all the information and refresh it on my computer. So as you can see, it varies wildly depending on the speed of your Internet connection, the quality of your Internet connection, and obviously the status of the stats server uptime next to it. Unfortunately, currently there is a bug. The uptime is 100% no matter what happens. But what it will represent once this is fixed is the percentage of uptime of all the active nodes. So as they become more or less active, maybe some of them are shut down by their users. As you can see, sometimes in the top right of the screens you can see node XYZ has appeared or has disappeared.
00:05:45.718 - 00:06:11.118, Speaker A: This will affect their uptime, and the overall uptime will also be affected. On the screen below that, we have a set of bar charts. They're really cool. You can actually mouse over them and get subsequent information. So over here, we have block time. This is the block time. For each block, we can see that it hasn't been very smooth in the last 40 blocks.
00:06:11.118 - 00:06:41.406, Speaker A: It varied wildly between 22 and 4 seconds. Next to it, we have the difficulty. The difficulty is how hard it is to mine a block. And obviously it's adjusted as the hash rate of the entire network is adjusted. And again here, this is something you can mouse over and keep an eye on. Next to it, we have block propagation. Some more stats here, so let's mouse over that first bar.
00:06:41.406 - 00:07:35.550, Speaker A: What we have here is the representation that 14% of all the nodes that are reporting currently into the dashboards have received the winning block between zero and zero point 25 of a second, which is excellent. And as you mouse over further, you can actually see that you also get a cumulative percentage. And let's go to say around here, we're seeing that 95% of all nodes that are currently talking to the dashboard have received their winning block between zero and 2 seconds and 75 of a second. 75th of second. Sorry. Next to that, we have the last block miners. And that's actually the last 40 block miners we have here.
00:07:35.550 - 00:08:07.186, Speaker A: But the list is only limited to five. These are not consecutive blocks, by the way. It just means that this first address, 00:27 b one something, has mine eight blocks of the last 40 and is displayed as such. Next to it, we have a map. The colors on the map, I believe, represents the status of the node, online, offline, et cetera. The health. If you scroll with your mouse, you can actually scroll closer and closer to the map.
00:08:07.186 - 00:08:28.000, Speaker A: And we have a raspberry PI here in Paris. This is probably one of the lucky people who've received a raspberry PI from Ethdev. We have a raspberry PI program. It's listed on a blog. If you guys want to get a raspberry PI to play with Ethereum, we'll ship it to you. Just send your application online. So I'll zoom out.
00:08:28.000 - 00:09:00.120, Speaker A: That takes us to the next line. Uncle Count. So this one is a little bit different from the other. The uncle count is represented at 25 blocks per bar. So that means that there were seven uncles in the last 25 blocks and seven in the 25 blocks before it. We then have the number of transactions between zero and one. Nothing really exciting, right now, but you sometimes can see it going quite high if you wait long enough.
00:09:00.120 - 00:09:46.226, Speaker A: And next to that we have gas spending. So I'm not going to go too much into what gas is, but in a nutshell, think of it as an arbitrary unit of measure that represents how complex a contract, the impact of a smart contract on the Ethereum network has. And it's an amount that needs to be paid for by the color of the contract. So it's a good representation of the activity, or the complexity, I should say, of the operations that are taking place currently on the Ethereum network. And again, this is represented for the last 40 blocks. Finally, we have a list, a long list of nodes. Very cool new option that Marian oncia, the soul, actually contributor to this dashboard, has added recently.
00:09:46.226 - 00:10:26.274, Speaker A: You can pin nodes, so I can go and click on my favorite nodes and they will always stay at the top. This is quite useful if you have maybe a mining farm, or maybe you have your favorite raspberry PI node you want to keep an eye on and make sure that they're always listed at the top, regardless of how you want to sort the columns in the table. So I'll unpin them. There you go. And we'll look at the next column, which is really just the name, the declared name of that node. It's something everybody can update, and there's going to be some amusing nodes names in there. Ether ninja over here.
00:10:26.274 - 00:10:55.902, Speaker A: Hello Ether ninja. Olycus Paris, Raspberry PI. And you can choose the name that you want to appear on this list. Next to it, you have the node type. So we have the name of the client that that node is running. In this case, Geth. Geth is the go Cli client, which will form really 100% of our frontier release, which is the release that comes right after our alpha Olympic test, the version that is currently running.
00:10:55.902 - 00:11:23.686, Speaker A: You can see that not everyone's running the latest. That's a big no. You really, really want to be on the latest geth, at least during the Olympic test phase. Obviously when we do launch Frontier, then there'll be a binary and a specific code source that you can compile and install. But for now, try to always try to keep up with the latest code. Also, if you find any bugs, please do report them on GitHub. It will improve Ethereum quite a bit.
00:11:23.686 - 00:12:08.054, Speaker A: We then have node latency. That's the time it took for the netstat client to contact the netstat server on the west coast. You can also click obviously on the header of the Scolins by the way to see to sort things to your liking. In this case, I'm trying to sort by mining nodes. Oh, an interesting thing here. When a node is mining, but is running a cluster of Eth miners, which are the c plus plus standalone miners connected to Geth, it will not necessarily reflect the total hash rate of that node. So what you're seeing here is very likely cpu mining only.
00:12:08.054 - 00:12:42.750, Speaker A: And this is something that I know Marion and the developers are still working on and will integrate in a future release. Then we have the number of peers. So as you know, if you start guess, you can specify the maximum number of peers that you'd like to connect to. I think some people are taking this to the extreme, and we have a vox chinji here connected to 168 peer. That's an awful lot. You don't have to connect to 168 peers to have a nice stable network. Five to ten is plenty.
00:12:42.750 - 00:13:24.878, Speaker A: Pending transactions is the number of pending transactions that the node can currently see. So if I sort in ascending order, you can see that some nodes here are quite a bit in trouble and they're seeing quite a lot of pretty stuck transactions or something of that nature. We also see that over here the block propagation time for these nodes have been quite poor. So some nodes are in trouble, others are doing quite well. Nothing really surprising here. Last block is quite simply the best block that the node can currently see. It's green if you're on the latest, as in the same one that the AWS server can see.
00:13:24.878 - 00:14:08.902, Speaker A: I think it's yellow if you're one behind, and red if you're three behind. Something along those lines. Next to it you have the hash of the block that the latest block that the node can see. Next to it, we have the total difficulty as seen by that node, as well as the number of transaction that that node can see in the latest block, and we also have the number of uncles for that block. And again, you can sort that column if you're interested. The last block time is, well, when was the last block seen? Quite simply, propagation time. Propagation time is as calculated by the Netstat server.
00:14:08.902 - 00:14:55.414, Speaker A: It's an interesting stat if you want to keep track of how well your node is doing. But again, keep in mind that this is as seen by the Netstat server, so it will be influenced by your distance to the AWS server. And there's also a little chart that's formed right next to it, a histograph of the propagation time for each node. I believe this is the last 40 blocks, and next to it we have the average propagation time again for the last 40 blocks, and finally the node uptime. But remember, there's a slight bug here, so old nodes are 100% uptime no matter what, for the time being. And that's it. That's the stats dashboard.
00:14:55.414 - 00:15:23.850, Speaker A: I hope you enjoy it. I hope it was useful, even though we went through quite a lot of stuff quite fast. If you have questions, please go on our forums on forum ethereum.org or forward slash Ethereum, or contact us on IRC and Skype. We love answering questions from the community, and please also submit issues if you're finding them, to the various GitHub repo and come and say hi. Thank you very much. Cheers.
00:15:23.850 - 00:15:24.540, Speaker A: See you next time.
