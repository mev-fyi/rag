00:00:00.640 - 00:00:15.770, Speaker A: Yeah. So currently I'm merging with the changes that happened to our repo and yeah, soon there'll be an update to our node. Let's settle it with me, how it is going for you.
00:00:18.870 - 00:00:48.898, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean things are good. I didn't do much on multicol though. So at this point I think I would like we should just basically do more testing and see if there's anything that needs to be fixed. And I think I will start to talk to the team about reviewing and potentially merging PR, so.
00:00:48.954 - 00:00:50.230, Speaker A: Yeah, that would be great.
00:00:50.810 - 00:00:58.650, Speaker B: Yeah. I'm just not confident yet that there is no more bugs, so.
00:01:00.070 - 00:01:31.780, Speaker A: But from my understanding on trailer they have one bug on you. Zero return data on error, but I don't know if it is like a real bug. Yeah, and basically most other things probably can be like difference for v one, at least until we'll get a lot of real bugs detected. All right. Nice. Hello, Clary.
00:01:36.160 - 00:01:36.940, Speaker C: Hey.
00:01:37.280 - 00:01:38.020, Speaker B: Hello.
00:01:41.680 - 00:02:08.240, Speaker A: So I was just saying that I finally got better and started merging in the changes that happened over the week to my change in prototyping of this, of some of the fixes. And soon we'll see updated note and that was basically it with me. Have you managed to try out Docker op locally or you'll be waiting for an updated release?
00:02:11.620 - 00:02:13.480, Speaker C: Is there some new Nethermode person?
00:02:14.300 - 00:02:15.984, Speaker A: Not yet. Yeah.
00:02:16.112 - 00:02:19.640, Speaker C: Then I haven't been testing any new ones. If there haven't been any new ones.
00:02:19.800 - 00:02:20.540, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:02:22.200 - 00:02:32.860, Speaker C: I wanted to try Nethermind on optimism, but we don't have any node running there at the moment. I wonder if Netherland was running something, but I guess not anymore.
00:02:34.240 - 00:02:45.010, Speaker A: Yeah, they kind of turned it off when they merged, as I understand it. And now I'm like zooming in the results of it all. Quite fun.
00:02:47.630 - 00:02:47.942, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:02:47.966 - 00:03:01.570, Speaker C: But I guess now it's merged. The main road is when there's a new version coming from Nethermind, then it also comes easier for us to run this providers that are running from the determined versions so then we can use those.
00:03:03.790 - 00:03:06.570, Speaker A: At least in theory. We haven't tested it yet.
00:03:07.590 - 00:03:21.540, Speaker C: Yeah, and that would be interesting to try and alter the networks and how the HTML works and all of those. But we don't want to maintain all of the random networks and that's why hoping that there's a major version so that we can use it.
00:03:22.600 - 00:03:33.020, Speaker A: Yeah, basically it would be like treating the chain as if it was proper ethereum. While there may be differences on chain potential.
00:03:35.480 - 00:03:53.220, Speaker C: Yeah. And there's big differences in the different chains. So I wonder if you have taken all of those in the mind. That's also something to test. How's Sina?
00:03:53.600 - 00:04:24.030, Speaker B: Hello, Lukash. Yeah, I'm doing good. Not a lot from my side. Today I was planning to look at a printhead that I kind of depend on from my. From my colleague. It would be nice, I think, if that is merged, then I will approach the team for reviewing my pr.
00:04:28.010 - 00:04:39.720, Speaker C: Sounds good. It's good that you're not in Kiev anymore, because there have been some missile strikes. Oh, this one here. Damn, they hit some hospital or something.
00:04:40.260 - 00:04:41.508, Speaker B: Oh, my God.
00:04:41.684 - 00:04:48.320, Speaker D: Yeah, I was. I was surprised you guys went to Kiev. It's still a war zone, you know.
00:04:49.300 - 00:04:50.080, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:04:51.420 - 00:04:53.920, Speaker C: People always want to go into random places.
00:04:56.700 - 00:04:59.490, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess I got lucky. Um.
00:05:01.590 - 00:05:15.410, Speaker D: Well, yeah, you know, you have to. You have to be unlucky to. To get. You know, but it's not that it's attacked very often or anything, but still, it's. There's always potential, right? There's always additional risks there.
00:05:18.510 - 00:05:40.420, Speaker B: Yeah. Honestly, it was. I. Yeah, I guess that it would be safe enough for me. So that's why I decided to go. It was just mostly inconvenient to commute there because there's no flights. So that was the harder part.
00:05:42.000 - 00:05:42.780, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:05:43.160 - 00:06:02.480, Speaker B: But I think it was worth it. And the people there at the hackathon, they were super happy that Vitalik showed up. And. And also, like, some people, like someone from EDF and so on. So, yeah, I'm kind of. I don't. Definitely do not regret going.
00:06:06.740 - 00:06:08.000, Speaker C: Do we have anything else?
00:06:10.220 - 00:06:17.240, Speaker B: I did want to ask, guys, did you ever announce that you merged? Assumulate anywhere?
00:06:18.540 - 00:06:19.720, Speaker A: I don't think so.
00:06:20.500 - 00:06:24.920, Speaker D: Let me check. Is it in our release notes that we merged?
00:06:26.300 - 00:06:28.228, Speaker A: I think it's not released with it.
00:06:28.324 - 00:06:29.960, Speaker C: Because there's no release yet.
00:06:30.260 - 00:06:50.770, Speaker D: There wasn't a release yet. Okay, so not officially. Like, if someone. I know that we had a user that was asking about something similar on this card, so we said, oh, there's something like that. You can experiment with it, but. Yeah, not really like a big public announcement. No.
00:06:51.190 - 00:06:52.090, Speaker B: Okay.
00:06:52.430 - 00:06:54.050, Speaker C: Do you know when there's the release?
00:06:59.190 - 00:07:23.210, Speaker D: That's a good question. We'll have one experimental now, but it's from a different release branch because it's about something different. And the main release, there's the vacation season. So hard to say. Probably this month, but I think maybe later this month. Like, there's SEC right now also. That's taking great people off, etcetera.
00:07:23.210 - 00:07:30.070, Speaker D: So some people are taking vacations, so it's really hard to coordinate release this. This month.
00:07:31.130 - 00:07:33.070, Speaker B: Do you guys have a regular schedule?
00:07:34.210 - 00:07:42.990, Speaker D: Semi regular. Semi regular. Right now, we're trying more or less one release per month, like the main releases, but it's flexible.
00:07:43.440 - 00:07:44.300, Speaker B: Okay.
00:07:47.280 - 00:07:48.660, Speaker D: We released one already.
00:07:51.880 - 00:08:18.550, Speaker B: Like, the hard works. I think it would be great if you guys write something in discord, like Cordev's discord that you merged, simulates, because it would be a signal for other clients that they can start. They can look into it. Like, when. When they see that one client already merged this, then it's like, okay.
00:08:21.570 - 00:08:25.030, Speaker D: Okay, in which channel? Execution dev. Channel?
00:08:25.410 - 00:08:29.610, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe JSON RPC. Execution Dev. I don't know.
00:08:29.770 - 00:08:32.426, Speaker D: Okay. Okay. I can write something there.
00:08:32.578 - 00:08:35.216, Speaker C: I think it's more JSON RPC related, I guess.
00:08:35.378 - 00:08:38.080, Speaker D: Okay, let me find the pr.
00:08:39.300 - 00:08:43.000, Speaker B: Yeah, but I guess the execution that might be looked at more.
00:08:44.060 - 00:08:45.480, Speaker D: I will post them both.
00:08:46.500 - 00:08:47.740, Speaker B: Okay, awesome.
00:08:47.900 - 00:08:51.548, Speaker D: But, Oleg, are we pushing some other changes to that pr?
00:08:51.644 - 00:09:09.800, Speaker A: Yes. Yes, we will. So I finally got better, and we'll be pushing this week quite hard on all the minute issues that are there. The only big one is the guess for blob pricing change.
00:09:10.300 - 00:09:15.804, Speaker D: Okay. So, yeah, it's like, it's merge, but it's not ready. Right. To actually be.
00:09:15.972 - 00:09:40.290, Speaker A: But it works, like, partially so anyone can use it. But he won't have two main features. First, hash won't be same as get. And second, blob pricing is not settled. So these are the main, like, issues that are on us right now, and everything else is quite minute.
00:09:41.830 - 00:09:43.330, Speaker B: Those are small.
00:09:43.910 - 00:09:55.300, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, those are small, small issues that need to be resolved. And, yeah, that's why also, we haven't released yet and are not releasing it yet. That's another thing.
00:10:06.400 - 00:10:24.750, Speaker B: Yeah, this is the heist issue. I think it's. It's very small, and, yeah, it would be. I think we will eventually get there, but I don't think most people would want to compare these hashes between the clients.
00:10:28.170 - 00:10:36.842, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the hash itself is so useful, but it's very good in checking that everything went the same way, and that's where it's. I think it's quite important.
00:10:37.026 - 00:10:41.830, Speaker A: I wonder, does current is call return hash?
00:10:42.410 - 00:11:22.980, Speaker B: No, it's call only returns a byte array. Basically, the return date of the evm call, it's, like, extremely minimal. But regarding the hash, one reason why I'm saying this is because a lot of it's, like, the differences. I'm guessing it comes from setting one field in the receipt or something like that, and those are not really returned to the user anyway. But, yeah, I mean, it would be great. And we will get there eventually. We'll fix it now.
00:11:29.480 - 00:11:31.580, Speaker A: All right. Do we have anything else?
00:11:37.000 - 00:11:38.100, Speaker C: Not for me.
00:11:43.290 - 00:11:55.178, Speaker A: All right, then I'll ping you all on telegram in a sync manner when I update the note. And yeah, see you all guys next week. Thank you.
00:11:55.354 - 00:11:56.826, Speaker B: Awesome talk to you.
00:11:57.018 - 00:12:05.754, Speaker D: Post it in both channels. And so. Yeah, post it in Jason RPC and push the link in the execution dev channel.
00:12:05.922 - 00:12:08.910, Speaker B: Yeah, I hope other clients get the formula now.
00:12:10.250 - 00:12:13.538, Speaker D: Yeah, we'll see, but, yeah. Cool.
00:12:13.714 - 00:12:14.642, Speaker B: All right.
00:12:14.826 - 00:12:16.230, Speaker D: Waiting for that pr.
00:12:17.210 - 00:12:18.682, Speaker A: Yeah, it will be soon.
00:12:18.746 - 00:12:22.890, Speaker D: When ready. No worries. Yeah. Thanks, guys. Bye.
