00:00:02.240 - 00:01:02.348, Speaker A: Yeah, so we have seen some serious applications, but me, I'm a person who likes dear range stuff. Especially in the first talk by Andrew, I think he mentioned something like he is also very unpeached applications. So that's something that I particularly enjoy. And also here I will demo to on teach. So of course, you know from first principle, what type of applications that these enable, right. First we saw from the first presentation we saw that, oh, maybe using forgetting of information, you can implement this negotiating box. So, you know, certain specific that utilizes very special property called gate conditional recall essentially means that human beings, after I see something, I cannot forget the information.
00:01:02.348 - 00:02:02.990, Speaker A: However, you know, it's Sgx. And forget that second one. Of course, computational share, privacy and non complications. And however derived from those, what can we do? First of all, we have put all web two accounts onto web3 realms. What we are doing is that we are bringing all of those composability, programmability, permissionlessness of web3, those nice properties onto all web two. So it essentially allows you to make cryptography called one time programs for your access, completely what it means for users that as a user, you run less authorization. And I want to note that this is a lot of our, I think, friends at the IC suite.
00:02:02.990 - 00:03:09.868, Speaker A: And of course, you know, Phil diameter also gave us amazing pocket as well. And of course, comprise is essentially, I think, before all of the multi party computation. Essentially, you initialize the TL's connection from using and therefore credit. But I want to also stress some of the difference between using tes for this map two integration and multiple quality communication TSP approach. The difference, the biggest difference you might like is like a lot of the tsunami approach, only focus on reading data on the website. And however, if you have a te, what you can enable its critical rights to web two. So traditionally, oral commits that were to have some data and some, like, you take that data as true.
00:03:09.868 - 00:04:15.988, Speaker A: But then, you know, what's the opposite of an article? It's like a prophecy, right? It's like say something and then it becomes true. So I think prophecy kind of nicely captures the difference between the te approach to gis connections and the multiplied computational things, right? So, like, you know, with tes, we are not just, you know, mere Morocco spins into gods, given us oracle, we become our own gods, become our prophets, pushing things out to the world. And, you know, of course, one important prioritizing. So this is like the original paper of one time programs, which I think was published in the 1980s. And one of the biggest examples that he used is zig. With emails. So like using one time program to something that allows you to, you know, for example, you go on vacation and then you want to give your assistant or friend access to controlling your email, but you don't want that person to have unrestricted access to your email.
00:04:15.988 - 00:05:22.572, Speaker A: So you can create those signatures that only allows them to decrypt, only decrypt and sign emails that are they input. Okay. And you know, you have to know tefs, all of those things that I just talked about are actually so powerful such that it's against AI think we policy to discuss it. I personally try to ask, you know those because I'm personalized to brainstorm with AI, but I, you know, when I was talking to cloud about this use cases as you have to understand the applications and the potential keys are so great such that opening and actually thinking that the same existential risk level of seriousness as AI think. Okay. And then now I'm going to start the actual demo for those fun applications. I will do some modulation.
00:05:22.572 - 00:05:49.370, Speaker A: Okay. Tomorrow, modular submit must have been obviously kind of stressed. But then, you know, a while ago he tweeted something walking the platform where I can anonymously submit that machine. Those ideas to add on CK, which is crypto Twitter. Now I'm going to present a platform that does that. Specifically it does that. It's using GE is you're able to essentially.
00:05:49.370 - 00:05:55.014, Speaker A: So the app is for teleport, by the way, because you're essentially teleporting to another person's Twitter account.
00:05:55.142 - 00:06:04.570, Speaker B: So if you want to test it, he's going to show it live. But if you want to put your Twitter account in there, you can go to teleport vest right now. Feel free. Give it a shot.
00:06:09.750 - 00:06:44.980, Speaker A: Ryan is going to present the attestation for that. You can try it out the RS live on base mainnet using Coinbase models. Okay. Yeah. So essentially the type of app is running inside. So we essentially store the users Oauth. The composability with step three is essentially you can make the mat that when within allows you to do it from the others.
00:06:44.980 - 00:07:20.600, Speaker A: So let's cut everything and I'm gonna demo it. Okay. So now I think I previously already kind of created something like username. I'm going to create my first NFT. So over here what it does is like my click basically redirects to the OAuth authorization. So you can see over here, it happened so fast. What just happened is.
00:07:23.300 - 00:07:40.570, Speaker B: Redirected, but it redirected to our SGX machine and I did regress it back to this front end. Never had. Never.
00:07:46.190 - 00:08:42.450, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And you know, one thing that you don't want when you're giving access to other persons to your own account, similar to the email example, is that, you know, you may not want the other person tweet breaches and stuff or like, you know, propaganda. Cheap point on your advance, right? You want to set some enforcement policies, but, you know, we're in a lucky era because we were born just declining to explore LLM applications rather than just having to hard code every constraint. Over here we need an FT that represent accessing code safeguard, which is like policy enforced by the LM that basically makes the GPT call initiate, credibly initiate the task connection to opening a server. We have also, we have tried running lm since Fte. The performance isn't great. That's why we didn't do that approach.
00:08:42.450 - 00:09:48.346, Speaker A: So over here I can say something like, no gracious, allow any other posts. And I'm going to mean this. Okay, so you can see over here the transaction has been sent to as in base supporting. Okay? So over here I linked to the account and I can, you know, kind of share this, talking the invite. Okay, so then I'm opening another browser to simulate, you know, so what this happens is that when you redeem the nav key, it meets the event on base and then the key is actually accessible processor. It monitors the event that it's a be repeated by the update. And then we saw in season event detaches from the database.
00:09:48.346 - 00:10:11.110, Speaker A: And then that's all of the field. I think it's probably some.
00:10:20.570 - 00:10:22.150, Speaker B: I've been tweeting all week.
00:10:31.330 - 00:11:46.746, Speaker A: Let me. Yeah, we'll get that back for two minutes. Another demo. Okay, so miss cheap plays, bamo is the game. If you guys don't know what this.
00:11:46.778 - 00:11:48.750, Speaker B: Is, has anyone played this game?
00:11:51.500 - 00:12:18.360, Speaker A: Yeah, so Mi's chief is like essentially cricket art studio in New York. And they create on each app. So what they, uh, what they did is this, uh, game called mix cheap plays banner, where the role is very simple. Players can pay $10 to join before the start of the game. The price four equals. And then you can every player every hour. So, you know, if you guys play crypto the game, it's also significant next to that.
00:12:18.360 - 00:13:08.110, Speaker A: Yeah. The cool part of all of this is because none of this is on chain. And that's why you can't create certain pollution strategies by using smart contracts. And, you know, the game has certain interest in staking. Okay, so the difference what is input means that in crypto you could just create a smart contract for the user strategy to help you create a downright hovering in web two. In this example, users could log in with their password and then divert from the down strategy by resetting password. Users have no reason to trust enterprise and keep running the strategy.
00:13:08.110 - 00:13:44.170, Speaker A: So without, okay, so yeah, we wrote TDX here, but this applies to any keys. This is just a pure imperfect information game, but with keys we can enforce users to collude and coordinate. Okay, so now the demo I'm gonna make is essentially copy cheap place demo now. But now it's the te. So now it's that the te is actually runs a web server that manages the problem users. And those users get to keep players outside the dao one by one. There are only users inside the dao who can win their selection strategy.
00:13:45.910 - 00:13:51.410, Speaker B: So the Te wins. The Te goes everybody else off and make sure it wins.
00:13:52.670 - 00:14:59.540, Speaker A: Yeah, so this is like spam and this is like the game website. So you can see now I've logged in into my accounts, you know, I have my full access, but now I should log out and then I, you know, because what happens in the Te is that we change its user's password and we simulate the browser in action for the Te to gain the access to the user. So what happens here is that I'm, and then ask the mischief web two server, which we don't have access, you can send me a link to reset my account password. Okay, great. So reset password, email sent. Let's see what happens. Okay, great, great.
00:14:59.540 - 00:15:15.032, Speaker A: Okay, so now I can copy the link address to this reset password link. And now you can join proofs code by the lining is also like, so if you're playing the game, you can.
00:15:15.056 - 00:15:19.136, Speaker B: Join our, unfortunately, the game is locked. You can't turn it now because it's like active.
00:15:19.168 - 00:15:58.530, Speaker A: Like it's something right now. Yeah, yeah. So if you're not already registered. Okay, so over here to join our copy your email and the URL, correct? Yeah, the URL will change the password and I joined the dub. So what happened was, yeah, what happened was so fast. That means, yeah, maybe we need to add some css.
00:16:00.390 - 00:16:10.010, Speaker B: What happens is chrome playwright extension browse to password.
00:16:18.640 - 00:16:22.020, Speaker A: Okay, so now show the hesitation.
00:16:22.360 - 00:17:13.580, Speaker B: So like we're talking a lot about tes and like all the things you can do and someone asked a question about how do you, like, where is this? Like how do you test these things? Like why does this matter? And so how many people here have actually created a quote or like got a quote from intel, like using this hardware that we're talking about today. So like maybe like 7810 people. And then all those people who raised their hands, have you actually verified those quotes? Because you probably know what that means if you've done it. Okay, for everybody else, what I want to help you with today, I want to help you understand that process and show you how easy it is today, given the tools that we're talking about. So get your phones ready. What we have set up is a free subdomain service on ems. And so we're all today going to create subdomains and we're going to have intel sign the subdomain for you that you create.
00:17:13.580 - 00:17:42.170, Speaker B: We'll show you how to test and verify those intel quotes. So check out this QR code on your phone. And this should come to site that looks like this. This is our little subdomain acquisition demo site. So this is using CCIP read off chain resolution with ens, so flashes one more time.
00:17:42.210 - 00:17:43.402, Speaker A: It's your last chance to create a.
00:17:43.426 - 00:18:28.348, Speaker B: Free subdomain on Mainnet. I'll show you what that t salon dot isolated dot zone, did it work for you? Okay, so I'm going to create a domain right now. I'm just going to create te rocks. I just signed that request to create this subdomain. So what just happened in the background? I'm going to show you right now. First of all, let's go to the APIs manager app contract. It's running on Mainnet.
00:18:28.348 - 00:19:29.138, Speaker B: As you can see the results. So I just created this subdomain and then as a text record. This is actually a basic support encoded thrust quote from intel. And so what does that mean? This record here is the actual material that's like signed by intel and what did not what was signed and how do we verify that? What? So to do that we will just use standard Ethereum, we're going to just try to use Ens to resolve that subdomain that I just created. So I'm just asking the mainnet registry to resolve that sub domain and it reverts and tells the client to check that gateway. And so you can see here, it's actually a quote signed by Intel's view of trust. And inside that quote I have this EOA.
00:19:29.138 - 00:20:24.974, Speaker B: So this is actually the identity of the created subdomain for you for free. So one way to verify that is asking. So openssl, we try to parse that chain of trust. You can see it resolves up to, you can see this resolved up to the intel root ca that root of trust signed the material that was running in Alibaba, Beijing that created the record for you. But this is all like, this is terminal stuff. I don't want terminal stuff. This is like not usable by humans.
00:20:24.974 - 00:20:48.962, Speaker B: So if you go to the website that we created to showcase this demo also has a nice little. How do you verify that? Like, flashbots runs stuff and they're saying, we're running a te. How do I verify that? How do I know you're doing what you say you're doing? Well, luckily we've got this cool tool that we have, so it. Anyone has a quote from intel, you can actually verify that quote. One way to do that is to.
00:20:48.986 - 00:20:49.550, Speaker A: Take.
00:20:52.890 - 00:21:42.348, Speaker B: Did anyone actually create a subdomain? Did it work for anybody? Excellent. So you could actually just copy the text record here. You can paste it in this little box. That's css. You paste it there, and then if it actually, that's the hash of the hash network for anybody, they can try this. Okay, well, the devil guys are not with us on stage, but the audience is with you. So that's like the first time you were able to actually create a quote or measurement or an attestation from intel was pretty cool and actually play with that data.
00:21:42.348 - 00:22:24.648, Speaker B: I know it's kind of, you may not know why RT created a subdomain for you and why you care about measuring that, but I just want to showcase, like, these things are accessible now. They're becoming more accessible to you. Create crazy apps like you built and then showcase people how to use that information. And so this is actually a really cool use case for blockchain and EMS because how else would we have posted that quote somewhere that's decentralized and sentenced? So we're actually using two systems to provide a lot of trust. So that is a quick demo. Any questions? So those domains are yours now? You can use those domains, you could. It's actually on maintenance.
00:22:24.648 - 00:22:31.380, Speaker B: So that's a cool little. That took about a day to build that. So I don't want you guys to go out and about what you can do potentially with this.
