00:00:01.610 - 00:00:04.990, Speaker A: The flashbots. PM. The mev roast.
00:00:07.800 - 00:00:09.110, Speaker B: Yeah, you're good.
00:00:09.800 - 00:00:34.796, Speaker A: Okay. Not sure who's sharing, actually, but cool. Okay. Well, hello, everyone. Welcome to the 10th edition of Mev Roast. I'm Tina, one of the flashbot stewards. Today, my co host, Roast Master, aka Meme Master Tom Smith, will be joining us through his meme and his roast questions because he's super jet lagged, having just arrived in Taiwan and it's already past midnight there.
00:00:34.796 - 00:01:26.008, Speaker A: And also shout out to our new friends and researchers joining from Asia at this hour from the MEB Roast, it's past midnight. I recognize some of you there. So as a tradition, all questions are good questions, and every one of you who choose to do your own research can be our roast master. In our pariship Treasure Map Roast tradition, we used to prepare rotten fruits and plenty of rum in case we don't like the treasure maps presented. So I hope you have your cups of coffee and your critical minds ready on the lookout for our ecosystem. So in the MEB Roast today, we will have three parts. First, a succinct update on Flashbots, followed by a mini roast QA session led by Palkyo.
00:01:26.008 - 00:03:09.500, Speaker A: Second, Yarin Farm B Protocol will discuss insights from designing and implementing a decentralized backstop liquidity protocol and will be followed by QA. And finally, rose questions from the Meme master Tom Smith. And if we have time, I would like to hear from those at the end who choose to stay till the end. Intro yourself and why you're here. So, as a start, flash Spots update from an organizational perspective, we are still going through the MVP phase of Flashbots, and you may have seen or read from our blog posts that Flashbots came from a research collective, and the research and development are the tightly coupled dual engines that propels us in a faced approach. And so we started out really in July and the first FLASHPASS original spec, which actually has full privacy, but we decided to simplify it for the sake of iteration and to test out the validity of some of our assumptions. So, essentially, what you see now, what you see today, we have released in November our proof of concept, which is Mebgeth.
00:03:09.500 - 00:04:32.120, Speaker A: And last week in January, our engineering team has released the flashbox Alpha, which consists of Mev Geth and Mev Relay. And in the next few months, we will first release our ecosystem product, MVV Explorer, and then hopefully, we will be able to present a more decentralized and promotionless version, which is Flashbots Beta, and invite all of the searchers here to Flashbots Olympics. On the research side, August was our first Treasure Map Roast, and this is the 10th. So a lot has been discussed and a lot has transpired and has been thrown away temporarily for the sake of iteration. And where we are right now is before the new years at the end of 2020. We have received five FRPS in our research repo. Our research process follows that of an EIP process, and our first group of Mev Sub Fellows were selected.
00:04:32.120 - 00:05:35.096, Speaker A: We expect the paper three specified on the flashbox Research roadmap, which is also in the flashbox Research repo to be published soon. And this will be published by Phil, who's on this call with his Cornell collaborators. And the second FRP submission deadline will be on Valentine's Day. So we will select our second set of Mev Fellows in February. And lastly, we hope by the end of Q One, we would like to have research paper one and two drafted. Once again, all of the roadmap and deliverables are specified in our Flashbots GitHub repo, so feel free to check it out. All right, next steph.
00:05:35.096 - 00:05:41.120, Speaker A: Do you want to give a quick update on Flashbots Alpha, which we released.
00:05:43.060 - 00:05:44.064, Speaker C: For sure?
00:05:44.262 - 00:05:45.296, Speaker D: Let me know if you hear me.
00:05:45.318 - 00:05:45.792, Speaker E: Okay.
00:05:45.926 - 00:07:27.424, Speaker D: So the Flashbots Alpha is super exciting stuff. Things have been moving quite quickly, and it's nice to be able to put this architecture out in the wild and try to figure out what impact it has in an empirical way. So where we're at right now is we've done some initial testing around the Mev guest with some miners, and we noticed that there was some significant concerns around Dos and spam that we wanted to make sure we address properly. Yet at the same time, we felt that there was a need for opening it up for a broader range of participants and users to start sending bundles. And so the intermediate solution that we came up with is this idea of Flashbots Alpha, where we are providing an endpoint through a relay that allows for searchers to submit bundles to the miners are participating. In this version, the relay itself is in charge of doing things like rate limiting and spam protection and is then relaying over the bundle request to the miners. So really the goal here is to start to bootstrap the adoption of Flashbots both for miners and searchers, start to get some feedback and pave the road towards future iterations of the system.
00:07:27.424 - 00:08:17.840, Speaker D: So right now we're running with about 3% to 10% of Ethereum hash rate at any given time on the system. And Scott will go a bit in detail about what the search experience is like right now and the types of bundles that we're seeing. So going forward, this is very much so the beginning of the development of this system. Some immediate goals that we're focusing on solving is adding minor privacy so that you can have more confidence in the way that the bundles are being submitted, that there's no way to steal them or manipulate an auction with that information. And then the second one is to improve the scalability of the system so that these issues like spam and Dos become less of a concern.
00:08:22.920 - 00:08:29.240, Speaker A: Cool. Well, next we'll have a sneak preview of MEB Explorer. Alex.
00:08:30.700 - 00:08:35.690, Speaker E: Yes. Hey, guys. Can everyone hear me? Or can you hear me, Tina? Very good.
00:08:36.380 - 00:08:36.744, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:36.782 - 00:09:47.676, Speaker E: Sweet. All right, so Mev Explorer is an initiative we mentioned in our initial blog posts, the E Search blog post and the Medium blog post, and is essentially a public dashboard that we want to share with the community and maintain with Mev related metrics. So we're going to present it soon, in the coming weeks. But until then, and relevant to this roast was two particular metrics we've been looking at. So what you're seeing here in that first one revenue split by extraction strategy, is looking at the total value that we've quantified that has been extracted on chain since the 11 February 2020 related to a transaction ordering. And so it is this extractable value that we keep on mentioning. So the 124 number is $124,000,000, and you can see that this is quite naive right now, and there's more work to be done, which is why you have this big disclaimer.
00:09:47.676 - 00:10:30.544, Speaker E: But you can see that most of the value has been extracted through arbitrage, about like 94% in this pie chart, and the rest is liquidations. This is particularly interesting. The split, being quite naive, is just liquidation and arbitrage for now. So when you see arbitrage plus trade, that is still arbitrage for the moment, but it's still relatively interesting to see. Most of the value, at least that we've quantified so far related to a transaction ordering, has been extracted in price arbitrage and these type of ARB trades. One thing that we think is particularly interesting is the size of that number. Right.
00:10:30.544 - 00:11:15.710, Speaker E: $124,000,000 is huge, especially given that this just goes back to the 11th February. If you can go to the next slide. Thank you. I guess giving some more color into this number, 124,000,000, the split we see above, this is a split by protocol. The way the split is done is because Joey 124,000,000 since the 11 February 2020. So last year now. Nice.
00:11:15.710 - 00:12:25.348, Speaker E: So this is a split by protocol. So because most Arabs and liquidations touch several protocols, they're not double counted, but the value is split between each of them equally. So again, there's some nuance to this metric, but it's still interesting to see how it's split. So, as you can see, a lot of the value is split between different automated constant function market makers and automated market makers, which makes sense given that most of the value is in ARP as we've currently classified it. But it is particularly interesting and relevant to us, even though the metrics are not fully at maturity yet, and we expect for them to be at that stage soon, and we're very excited to share them with the community and provide more transparency into what's happening there. What's I guess interesting to us is it kind of guides where we think people should be building their bots and bots that could potentially run on Flash bots, right? So that's definitely interesting to us in that sense. And that's it.
00:12:25.348 - 00:12:39.780, Speaker E: So for MV explorer, definitely stay tuned. Ave mev is mostly around flash loans. Yes, Flash loans and mostly around Flash.
00:12:41.720 - 00:12:42.096, Speaker F: Think.
00:12:42.138 - 00:12:46.620, Speaker C: I think liquidations is another place that Ave gets a lot of mev.
00:12:47.280 - 00:13:34.024, Speaker E: Very good. Thank you, Scott. The 124 is USD, so we quantify a lot of this in the relevant token it's be traded on. Then we convert that into ETH, and then we convert ETH into USD using price data. So again, there's some nuance there in how it's converted, of course, but you can relatively trust that figure. So anyway, I won't dwell much longer on mev, explorer. We're very excited to share February 11, 2020 to early December of this year.
00:13:34.024 - 00:14:18.410, Speaker E: So it doesn't fully include, I believe, the latest block. This is part of the disclaimer of the numbers being early estimates. Anyway, we're very excited to share more about Explore. Soon. We're kind of nearing the final stages of iteration of the dashboard, and once we share it with you guys to see how you use it and what kind of other information you might be looking for and how we can add more metrics that will benefit the whole community, I'll pass it on to Scott for an engineering update on Mev search.
00:14:19.820 - 00:15:14.376, Speaker C: Awesome. Thank you. So, Mev Search, this is the category where we're looking to bring on people who are running bots. So a searcher is what we consider a bot that is using the Flashbots transaction submission endpoint. And to power that, we've created a process to onboard what we call Mev Searchers. This is a form that they can fill out at a really high level that will eventually allow them to receive an API key that they can use in their bundle submission process. Since an API key is currently required to communicate with this, because of the denial of service stuff that we were talking about earlier, we open sourced a repository here.
00:15:14.376 - 00:16:09.068, Speaker C: It's called simple arbitrage. It's a very small example of how you can use the Flashbot's bundle submission endpoint to submit bundles and how you can discover opportunities outside of the Flashbot system. One of the things that we noticed when we started getting some inbound requests for how to use the system was that there was some confusion about what role Flashbots played. They were asking, how do I use Flashbots to find Mev opportunities? And I think we need to do a better job of creating more examples and more documentation showing that this isn't the method that you use to discover mev. This is how you take advantage of mev in the most optimal way. We've been doing a lot of hands on with Searchers right now. We're really trying to get Searcher volume up.
00:16:09.068 - 00:16:54.970, Speaker C: We have just a few searchers running right now, and the more we get, the more profitable bundles we're going to find per block, and we're really going to kick start the flywheel of more bundle profitability, leading to more miners, leading to more searchers that want to participate in the system. So it's really important that we get the volume as soon as possible. Yeah. And so we're just trying to expand the quantity of searchers and how much we make per block. But I have a demo that I was going to show you that I thought was kind of cool. We were able to use the system for a white hat rescue of NFTs. And I'm going to share my screen here in a bit, so I'll be taking over.
00:16:54.970 - 00:17:48.698, Speaker C: But the gist of this demo is that several days ago, somebody lost their private key to a hacker. And the hacker quickly took all of their ERC, twenty S that were obviously valuable, their dyes. They took all their ETH. Of course, they took a lot of these assets, but this user actually had a really large collection of NFTs CryptoKitties and axes and tons of these gods and chains cards. And we were talking to them and found out that we can actually use this mev system to rescue NFTs in a way that would not be possible without Flashbots. And yeah, I'm going to share my screen now. All right.
00:17:48.698 - 00:19:03.300, Speaker C: My screen shared. Okay, so what we have here is a searcher, right? This is the same kind of a component that you would use if you found some profitable opportunity out in the wild and you wanted to bring that opportunity to the chain not by using a pending transaction, but by submitting it to the Flashbot's bundle submission endpoint. And the searcher, instead of going out and finding some new arbitrage opportunity, kind of creates its own profits to the miner. If the miner is willing to include several transactions from accounts that don't have any gas associated with them, they don't have any ETH on the account. The problem that we have right now is since that account has a disclosed private key, any ETH that goes into that account just gets siphoned out. If you submit half an ETH to pay for the gas to conduct these transactions, the first thing that's going to happen is a bot is going to come sweep all that ETH out. So what we did is we created a set of zero gas transactions, which is a bunch of transactions from.
00:19:05.110 - 00:19:05.426, Speaker F: This.
00:19:05.448 - 00:19:40.986, Speaker C: Account that has been hacked. And then we also created what we are considering donor transactions, which is this is the account that's actually going to pay for the gas. And by including them into a bundle, you can see here we have a bundle where we basically take all these zero gas transactions and then the transaction that actually pays the miner, we throw them into a bundle and we ship it up here. Let me go ahead and run this thing, actually, because the way that this outputs it is a little bit easier to understand. So it's actually trying to submit this bundle right now, but the gist of it is. This is the hacked account. This is Axie.
00:19:40.986 - 00:20:41.122, Speaker C: We're saying like, the zero gas transaction is from the hacked account to Axi to move one of those assets to a new owner. And then the other transaction that's a part of the bundle is a check. This is the account that actually has ETH, that is communicating with the contract that checks to see that the previous transaction occurred and if it has, will directly transfer the miner some fixed value and the system will trace these transactions working. It will figure out how much gas they use. Combined, you can see what the effective gas price is for that bundle to be included since the miner is not going to get paid anything based on transaction fees but will get paid this. And it will end up kind of calculating the gas price just by dividing gas used by gas price for how the key was disclosed. I don't know.
00:20:41.122 - 00:21:35.794, Speaker C: Actually, I'll ask the user how that happened. It's something we've been seeing just quite a lot lately, especially with metamasks or people that are the ledger. One is the one that I've seen several private keys get yanked when they fall for some sort of a phishing. Hey, we need to confirm your 24 word seed. So let me quickly show you what it looks like on chain because I know we're just kind of like looking at some code here that we don't have enough time to really go into details on. One thing that might be kind of interesting is it's generalized so that you can make one of these per protocol. So all you got to do to go from CryptoKitties to Axie is just use a different engine.
00:21:35.794 - 00:21:56.650, Speaker C: And this engine basically just constructs the transaction requests for the zero gas price transactions and it could do a bunch of them in a single bundle. And then the singular donor transaction that can check multiple things. But I'm going to share the browser real quick because it looks pretty simple when it lands on Chain.
00:22:12.160 - 00:22:12.910, Speaker E: Okay.
00:22:17.520 - 00:22:20.430, Speaker C: All right. Am I sharing a screen that's moving? Not the one?
00:22:21.120 - 00:22:21.820, Speaker E: Yes.
00:22:21.970 - 00:22:22.332, Speaker F: Good.
00:22:22.386 - 00:22:48.150, Speaker C: Awesome. Okay, so this is the account that got their private key compromised. And you can see that there's a whole bunch of value that moved out of the system. This is back here around when they got their key disclosed. And then in the last day, there's a whole bunch of interactions with CryptoKitties where the transaction fee is like exactly zero. If we click on one of these, it's not ranning down to zero. The gas price was literally nothing.
00:22:48.150 - 00:22:51.680, Speaker C: But what you can do is see the way the system worked is we're.
00:22:51.680 - 00:22:52.820, Speaker B: Going to look at the block.
00:22:53.640 - 00:23:19.490, Speaker C: We're going to look at all the transactions in the block. We're going to go to the last page and you can see that because it was a flashbot bundle, it was included at the head of the block. Here and there is a transaction here that doesn't seem to be related, but it is. This is the donor transaction that basically paid for the rest of these. So we're going to click on here. It's actually a source verified contract. So we can do this.
00:23:19.490 - 00:24:21.684, Speaker C: So what we can see is I called on this source verified contract that it's open to anybody to use a bunch of targets. These are all CryptoKitties. The question is, what is the owner of the four kitties that I traded in that or they tried to move to the rescued transaction in that block? And then what are the results that I expect to match for those? If this gets called and all of these conditions are met, it's going to take all of its value and ship it to the block coinbase, effectively confirming that those things actually occurred and then rewarding the miner directly based on it. Yeah, so this is a source verified transaction that anybody can use. And the idea is you just submit value and a bunch of conditions you want to check, and if they match, you pay the minor. It's a really simple contract, but it allows us to basically have one account pay for another account's gas, because moving ETH into that account would immediately be swept by a bot. And so we don't need to do that now.
00:24:21.684 - 00:24:58.966, Speaker C: We can just interact with things so long as we know the private key. All right, that's it for the demo. I'm torn on open sourcing it. I guess I probably should because I think it's a really interesting example because it is an example of using the bundle submission endpoint of the system. The simple arbitrage only does a single transaction since ARBs happen in a single transaction. But this is one where we're actually using a bundle.
00:24:58.998 - 00:24:59.146, Speaker E: Right.
00:24:59.168 - 00:25:02.650, Speaker C: All these were bundled together and it was important that they all landed in the same block.
00:25:08.980 - 00:25:37.400, Speaker A: Cool. All right, so I think we're going into QA session. One moment. Just trying to on Flashbots and I'm once again trying to share screen. Alex, can you help with curating the questions in the chat, on the slide chat?
00:25:38.460 - 00:25:43.710, Speaker E: Yeah, that sounds good. We have one from Luke and one from Joseph, I believe, right now.
00:25:44.400 - 00:26:38.510, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think Luke's question on what we plan to do to miners who behave in certain ways that are detrimental to the system and adversarial to the searchers during Alpha phase. Right now we have this soft rule of essentially we will give them warnings and potentially excluding them from the system. Right now we're not codifying any of these rules yet. We're trying to see how the ecosystem players behave at the moment. So that's what we're doing in the Alpha base. And Alex, if you can read Joseph's or Joey's question, I can't really see the screen.
00:26:40.480 - 00:27:00.420, Speaker E: Sure. I guess you just answered Luke's question or gave part of an answer. Joseph's question is around asking the main saving. So is the main saving the block space from transaction art that would have errored or failed normally? I guess the main saving from using Flashback.
00:27:06.280 - 00:27:07.750, Speaker C: Can I answer that one?
00:27:08.120 - 00:27:10.004, Speaker E: Go ahead, please.
00:27:10.202 - 00:27:56.550, Speaker C: I think that is definitely one of them that we don't need error transactions to land on chain anymore. I think another larger one is that there's a lot of arbitrage opportunities that are using back running where you try to slide in a transaction behind another one and that can yield to just hundreds and hundreds of transactions for a single opportunity. And using the Flashbot system and the way that bundles work, you can actually discover a transaction in the pending queue and include it as part of your bundle. And just instead of hoping that you land behind it programmatically, just say like, I want to land behind this, and you really raise that transaction up to the top and land right behind it. And you're not just spewing garbage into the chain just to capture an opportunity.
00:28:01.100 - 00:28:07.130, Speaker A: Cool. So, mini row session, palkyl, are you on the line?
00:28:08.940 - 00:28:55.288, Speaker G: Oh, actually, another quick question on the NFT if we have time. Go ahead. So, two questions actually. First off, since you're sending bundles to the flashpots APIs and they're private, would a simpler solution have worked where you send, let's say, like, one ether to that compromised address, you withdraw all the NFTs, and then you send that somewhere else. And since the whole bundle is private, the bot would not have been able to steal it. And so that's part one. But then part two, it sounds like your framework is very cool for making meta transactions work.
00:28:55.288 - 00:29:06.300, Speaker G: So even if it was not necessary in this case, sounds like with very little Twiddling, you'd be able to make pretty much any account be able to do transactions without Ethereum.
00:29:07.760 - 00:29:56.750, Speaker C: Yeah, those are two really good questions. So the question one was, well, if you can just use a private relay, couldn't you just submit ETH, do some stuff, and then transfer the ETH out? The problem is that all the transaction relays out there that are private, you can't gossip a transaction from an account that doesn't have any Ether. And so you first need to send the Ether and then the Ether needs to land. Like the Ether actually needs to be your transfer inbound needs to show up in a block before you can actually give it any transactions to send those entities out. And by the time that it lands in a block, it gets discovered and swept out. There's bots that are sitting there doing this all day like next block, and they pay 99% of the Ether value to the miners to transfer that value out.
00:29:58.160 - 00:30:06.290, Speaker B: I think Yvonne's question was like, why can't instead of going through the contract, we just send ETH directly in that same block first and then.
00:30:08.100 - 00:30:17.380, Speaker G: Importantly do that privately so that if the Mev geth is simulating this. It's first. Simulating receiving ether. Second, it's simulating a private transaction.
00:30:21.880 - 00:30:23.270, Speaker B: Yeah, sorry, go ahead.
00:30:23.800 - 00:30:34.920, Speaker C: No, I think I'm maybe not understanding the scenario. Are you talking about running a forked version of Geth that allows that? Because the current version of any private transaction relay wouldn't allow that to land in the same block.
00:30:36.460 - 00:30:58.768, Speaker G: Wouldn't mev geth allow this? So you use the mev gas send bundle API. The first transaction is a signed transaction that sends one Ether from your account to the compromised account. The second transaction is a pre signed, like taking out NFTs. There's maybe some tooling with MetaMask to do, given that you don't have gas but you still need to sign this.
00:30:58.854 - 00:31:22.888, Speaker C: But this seems very doable, totally using MV guests. So yes, totally. That is 100% like another totally viable way to do it is to actually fund the account, actually spend real transaction fees and then return whatever isn't used. Just make sure that you only put in enough that you need to do the thing that's another totally great way to do it.
00:31:22.974 - 00:31:53.084, Speaker B: Probably a little bit cheaper. I would say that the two trade offs there are like in the current version where miners can technically misbehave on flashbots and we have only like after the fact remediation. If you do it that way, it's still technically possible for them to say, like, okay, we're only going to include this funding transaction. Since the key is compromised. I don't know what the benefit would be because they're getting paid anyway, so maybe they can also steal the NFTs that way. I don't know. I guess the second case that it's relevant would be if you want to have some sort of reorg protection.
00:31:53.084 - 00:32:11.652, Speaker B: So if a flashbot's block later gets orphaned, if you had like an unconditional ETH Send as part of the bundle, there's no guarantee that it would get reorgan into the same bundle because at that point it might actually just be in the Mempool. So I think those are the two edge cases. But largely, yeah, you probably could have accomplished the same effect.
00:32:11.706 - 00:32:12.084, Speaker A: Makes sense.
00:32:12.122 - 00:32:15.400, Speaker E: And not to nick too much, the second question is much more interesting.
00:32:15.470 - 00:32:22.970, Speaker G: How much have you thought about essentially doing this? Like matter transactions as a service where accounts with no Ether can basically send stuff through?
00:32:23.660 - 00:33:04.730, Speaker C: Yep. Yeah, that is definitely one of the ones that we've talked actually, I think it was vitalik we talked to him about this and that was like one of his first thoughts. Like, oh, well, yeah, now we have basically a globally supported GSN with no on chain overhead, but for any of these systems, tornado, even I was talking to Roman about that and that was like the first thing that he thought was interesting. It was like, oh, well, this is relays, but the relays don't have any there is no middleman and there's no chance of loss for the middleman to actually need to charge a premium on.
00:33:11.920 - 00:33:12.572, Speaker A: Cool.
00:33:12.706 - 00:33:17.490, Speaker E: All right, let's move to Palkio. Sorry we had to cut you off before.
00:33:18.100 - 00:34:24.790, Speaker A: Yeah, the reason why you're seeing this current screen if you guys can see, was that I think yesterday I just keep on getting waken up by the ETH Security Telegram chat. I thought there was some hack MAGA hack going on, but then they realized Palkyo was discussing Flashpots in the community and I wanted to protect the anonymity of some of the folks who spoke. So I quoted some of the lines that I found to be interesting. The entire discussion was absolutely fascinating and reminded me of the early days of the mev roast where we are very critical of what we're trying to achieve here. And so Pelkyo, would you like to share your kind of major concerns? I summarize some of the questions that we decided to narrow in on, but you could go over some of your main concerns first.
00:34:25.480 - 00:34:27.990, Speaker H: Yeah, sure. Can you all hear me well?
00:34:28.440 - 00:34:29.188, Speaker A: Yes.
00:34:29.354 - 00:35:19.364, Speaker H: Okay, perfect. Yeah, maybe I can just sum up my thinking. So first let me say that I really like what Flashbot does is really exciting. But in term of focusing on mev get, I have more of a critical thinking on my controversial point of view is does it do more harm than good? So basically I think we all agree that Uniswap, for example, I think is a good use case has some fundamental design flows and I think we all agree that in the short term if mevgas takes off it will enable sandwiching and it will hurt end users. But the thinking is that it's a necessary pain in the short term to actually fix properly these problems.
00:35:19.482 - 00:35:20.150, Speaker E: Right.
00:35:21.900 - 00:37:02.224, Speaker H: But to me first I think it would be nice to have a broader discussion about the ethical aspect of these short term pains and then maybe measuring the mev that could be extracted through sandwiching on uniswap because sandwiching on uniswap will be made possible in 100% of the cases where it's possible. So I think it will change a lot compared to the situation right now. So that's like the short term thing. But in the medium term I think it's even more important that either like unitswap v two will die because user will just abandon it because of these fundamental flows. That may be like the happy path, but I think there is another alternate scenario which is that the user are very unhappy about being systematically sandwiched. So they kind of pressure the DApps on these DApps end up having like making partnerships with miners to send their transactions privately so they will never be seen in the public mem pool and they cannot get sandwiched because it's all private. And I feel like this will be like a second order consequence of mevgeth which will be to push basically that mev geth is about making stuff transparent, enabling more possibilities.
00:37:02.224 - 00:37:21.310, Speaker H: But it will actually as this second. Order effect push everything to be OPAC again and it will not actually solve these problems. It will just make everything more like one level more complex without any benefit. That's kind of my fear. So I don't know what you're thinking on that.
00:37:25.760 - 00:38:44.390, Speaker A: Cool. So essentially there are two questions here, right? Which question we address here also? In fact, there are three, but I put two here and then there's a third one which you mentioned last, the user harm. The reason why I left it out of the current slide of the QA was because that is actually one of the research roadmap Flashbots major research question. So, like in the second research paper for MVP phase, you could see on our MEP research repo, there is a study of the consensus harm and the study of user harm. And so in this approach so I think that deserves a deeper conversation. I would love to welcome everyone to chime in, but I will direct that particular question to a separate research workshop which we host on a semi monthly basis as well, so we can go more in depth with potentially deliverables to accomplish, perhaps palkia. Do you want to focus on kind of these two questions?
00:38:45.100 - 00:38:57.470, Speaker H: Yeah, I think the second is the most relevant as the second order effects, does it actually makes everything opaque? Again, that's my question.
00:39:02.240 - 00:39:03.608, Speaker A: Any takers?
00:39:03.784 - 00:39:53.596, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, from my perspective, I think it's a good question. I think that was one of the things that originally scared me about Mev and that I was originally several years ago in DevCon, warning people could be an outcome. And I still think it is a very realistic scenario. I think naturally these kinds of on chain, decentralized financial products are going to create some Asymmetries. And I hope that one of the things that's going to be different about the Flashbots.org from other extraction channels, private mempools, et cetera, is that a commitment to reducing those Asymmetries as much as possible through open source. So I think maybe Alex and other people can talk about how we see that.
00:39:53.596 - 00:40:31.080, Speaker B: But yeah, I share that concern even with my own even decisions as granular as participating on this call. I think we all share that fear. From my reasoning, it's going to matter a lot how mev is handled in the next two years of the ecosystem. And as much as I wish I could say the outcome will definitely be more transparency, that's not necessarily the case. So I think we have a lot of work to do to actively be committed to actually making that happen. And there will be like nebulous scenarios where we have to prove that through actions.
00:40:32.860 - 00:41:48.130, Speaker H: Just one more thing. My point is that even if Flashbots is fully committed to transparency, I really wonder about the fact that some other initiative will start against the kind of harmful mev extraction that will actively harm users and that these new initiatives will be completely opaque. And even though Flashbot itself is fully transparent, it will strongly encourage such opaque initiatives and partnerships between DApps and miners so that they send the transactions privately to avoid sandwiching. I think that's very real. And one other thing I want to emphasize is that I feel like there is a lot of politics that's involved on that. Flashbot is mostly like I feel like you are mostly focused on the technical aspect of it. But for example, I think that if we have not seen a lot of mev extraction so far, it's also because of this politics thing on that miners have a reputation, that kind of stuff.
00:41:48.130 - 00:41:56.470, Speaker H: I think it's also politics that would create these second order effects and I think it's very important to take that into account.
00:42:01.540 - 00:42:04.112, Speaker F: So, just wanted to add something because.
00:42:04.246 - 00:42:11.208, Speaker E: I'm on many calls with mining pools trying to foster the adoption of mev gas.
00:42:11.324 - 00:42:13.492, Speaker F: And what I see is that because.
00:42:13.546 - 00:42:34.584, Speaker E: The numbers of mev extraction revenue go up, a lot of pools become more sort of acquire this more profit seeking mindset, especially newer entities that enter the market. So this sort of opaqueness will happen no matter with or without Flashbots.
00:42:34.632 - 00:42:37.164, Speaker F: And I think Flashbots is just the.
00:42:37.202 - 00:42:50.370, Speaker E: Best answer to try to make it sort of as not opaque as possible because these things are happening, miners changing their mindset. I think that's what I'm seeing.
00:42:50.980 - 00:42:52.640, Speaker F: I mean, mining pools.
00:42:53.300 - 00:43:26.860, Speaker H: Yeah. And then my last thing I want to say is that I totally agree and I think it will go in that direction anyway. But if Flashbots make it much faster and it also in the short term hurts users, I feel like it doesn't really change anything in the medium or long term, but it will harm users in the short term. So that's the thing I want to consider. I think there is a possibility that overall it has a negative impact.
00:43:34.010 - 00:43:51.820, Speaker B: Yeah. No, I totally agree. I think there's a strong possibility. The vision is that through three prongs this will be avoided. One of them is transparency and actually being committed to open source. The second, and this speaks to private forks and things like that. And also the politics that you guys mentioned.
00:43:51.820 - 00:44:40.374, Speaker B: I think the politics of the community is going to be really relevant in how mev is extracted and distributed in the short to medium term. I think in the long term it makes absolutely no difference. That's my hypothesis because the incentives are very obvious and clear, so eventually they will play out in a certain way. But in the short to medium term, how much gets extracted by who, where the profit goes, which miners do it, how they behave towards each other, I think these are all details that matter. A, so like my proposal there is to kind of be very vocal about mev issues as projects and as a community. And I think another prong we can use to mitigate. This is education and teaching users how their designs are insufficient.
00:44:40.374 - 00:45:27.770, Speaker B: Like what does uniswap slippage really mean? Can you expect to get a certain price or what kind of execution can you expect? I think these education questions might actually be helped by having mev actually actively extracted, especially if we integrate with the visualization tools people are using. So I think it easily could become opaque in the future. I hope that it becomes transparent and it actually helps users. But I think there is a lot of work and a lot of conversations like these that will need to happen and not only just happen but happen in a meaningful way that influences mining pools and the community's decisions. So I think these roasts are a good start but somehow we need to also think about how to expand this further.
00:45:33.630 - 00:46:31.582, Speaker H: Yeah, I feel like that does not really address the second order effects problem because that's more about flashbot transparency. I feel like this second order is about something else on politics and I'm a bit more pessimistic about user education. I don't know, I feel like lots of people won't really understand and will be pissed off and that will pressure DApps to try to get their transactions mined privately. Even though I totally agree with you with the fact that we need more education and we actually in the long term we just want to remove these incentives and actually design that properly, that would be nice. But right now we have a problem and we kind of have to deal with it and I feel like it's important to try to minimize harm as well. It's like you are building a very powerful weapon. It has the potential to help people.
00:46:31.582 - 00:46:32.480, Speaker H: I don't know.
00:46:33.250 - 00:46:35.726, Speaker E: Would it be a positive outcome though?
00:46:35.828 - 00:46:37.214, Speaker B: I feel like if we can get.
00:46:37.252 - 00:47:01.750, Speaker E: More DApps to adopt by default, send all transactions through mev, I think the point will become not to extract mev but to protect people from extracting mev. If everything's going through private mempools, I think this is like a positive thing for the ecosystem. Don't call it opaqueness, call this privacy.
00:47:09.580 - 00:47:11.476, Speaker B: Like if mev guest just helps push.
00:47:11.508 - 00:47:14.090, Speaker E: Us towards that faster, I think that's a good thing.
00:47:14.860 - 00:47:16.090, Speaker H: Yeah, that's true.
00:47:19.100 - 00:47:51.750, Speaker A: Yeah. Well I think that's why we have essentially laid out. I'm sharing my screen here. I hope you can see the research roadmap and this is like literally one of the major research questions that is unclaimed. And I would love to invite all of you here interested in these research questions specifically to participate in our research workshop. Don't worry, we're not asking you to like as a full time job thing. It's more that collective research process that we could co author and work on something of academic rigor together.
00:47:51.750 - 00:48:12.990, Speaker A: That said because we're running kind know way beyond time. So I'm going to continue to Aaron's discussion. Aaron from B protocol. Aaron, would you like to share your own?
00:48:14.000 - 00:48:15.470, Speaker F: Yes, please.
00:48:16.400 - 00:48:43.460, Speaker A: Okay, so this is part of our second, because Mev Rose is not meant for flashbots the implementation itself, it's meant for Mev projects and communities and discuss the merits and debates, the designs and et cetera. So that's why we're inviting ecosystem projects like B protocol to share their insights.
00:48:47.720 - 00:49:31.140, Speaker F: Okay? So first of all, thank you for having me and I will not be able to see text questions if there are any. So Tina, maybe, if there are any questions, please relay them. Let me share, try to go to full screen maybe. Let's go like this. Okay, so, thank you very much. I'm Yaron, CEO of OK. So I was asked to share my insights about designing a system for liquidations, especially in the presence of Mev.
00:49:31.140 - 00:50:58.192, Speaker F: So, first of all, let's start maybe with the bottom line. What is my point of view that actually gave rise to this project? So mev is annoying for uniswap Arbitrage in general, but for liquidations it's much worse than just annoying. And in my view, eventually it could give rise to some major collapse in lending platforms simply because there will not be anyone to liquidate or even worse. So my point of view is that currently no big player really want to liquidate and it all goes to small players who just run some Arbitrage bots. Moreover, so every dollar that goes not only to miners, but one of the difficulties now that if you really want to be competitive, then it's not only about trading and hedging that you need to focus, but also on blockchain developers. I add to that that currently the market, liquidation market is not that big. On the other hand, once it gets too big, it will probably be too late to start hoping that big players will come then.
00:50:58.192 - 00:51:54.832, Speaker F: Yeah, all these will make DeFi platforms very unstable. Some insights from traders we discussed before starting the project. So talking with so called traditional algo traders who are now doing crypto but maybe off chain. So when they do backstop in a centralized or traditional finance, there are a lot of unknowns. The Hedging is very complicated, you don't really know what you get because you don't know market conditions, et cetera. But this is something they learn to do, they have a lot of experience. But now if you add all the blockchain issues, gas worth is one gas cost in general, which does not exist, traditional finance, network topology, et cetera.
00:51:54.832 - 00:53:17.340, Speaker F: Then all of a sudden risk estimation models become much more complex. So this is why they don't tend to participate there speaking with existing projects. So previously I was CTO of Kyber network the Kyber network team actively market make on chain a lot does millions in I mean, he does know how to handle the blockchain complexity, gas costs, et cetera. But still they didn't want to go into liquidations because all of the gas walls and finally another perspective is that it's not only the mev that make the required premium for liquidation higher. And in DeFi, it's much higher than in centralized finance. So it's not only about the mev, the uncertainty or the competition element in general make it less profitable or at least less unknown. And this is why DeFi platforms are forced to offer bigger incentives.
00:53:17.340 - 00:54:08.060, Speaker F: So this is like the overall or maybe the summary, but let me now dive in into the talk and present what we do. So, first of all, about myself. So, CEO of B Protocol. Before B Protocol, I was working for a few months on front running back, running bots, liquidation bots. Before. That was City of Kyber Network. Kyber Network, especially in the sense that it was the first to actually do market making on chain, not just by a fixed formula, but actually submitting ethereum transaction for every price update, having liquidity on chain, et cetera, was working on wrapped Bitcoin before doing smart contract professionally.
00:54:08.060 - 00:54:45.784, Speaker F: He was doing PhD in computer science and did some academic research. One of them was later the CEO of Kyber Network. We did smart pool, which was a decentralized smart contract mining pool and even mined a few blocks there. Yeah. So, first of all, I will briefly explain what are lending platforms and liquidation. I assume most of the audience here is already familiar with it. Mev is definitely something, you know, and then I will talk about the so, yeah, okay.
00:54:45.784 - 00:55:48.632, Speaker F: Lending platforms are like a key element or key pillar in DeFi with billions in locked value. Basically, you have a lender who deposit a coin. You have a deposit of coin. Everyone can deposit, everyone can borrow in return to a deposit. And once your debt is bigger than your collateral plus some safety margin, then you get liquidated. And the incentive for liquidators is that they get the user collateral with a premium and in return they have to pay the user debt, okay? And without liquidation, so Dai in particular could lose the Peg compound and Ave will go bankrupt eventually. All of DeFi is based on proper liquidation scenario, okay? Now, how liquidations are done in traditional finance.
00:55:48.632 - 00:57:48.432, Speaker F: So, first of all, when you set up postpone new centralized system that typically in traditional finance, these are exchange that allow you to trade with margin. So, first of all, you form a backstop of big algo traders. They commit on liquidation of certain amounts, namely they lock some capital. On the other hand, the platform commits that if liquidation were to happen, then you will get a guaranteed profit, which, okay, it's not really a profit, but a liquidation discount when it happens and when liquidation is needed, okay? They either saw it to the order book, but if there are extreme market condition, they just dump the position on the liquidators and then the liquidators need to get rid of the position. So liquidators here get certainty, and this certainty allow them to prepare for such big events and platforms like BitMEX can do hundreds of millions of liquidations per day, just to give maybe some comparison. So in MakerDAO recently, they introduced this parameter that basically does not allow to liquidate more than $60 million per 6 hours or so. And Maker is by far like the biggest liquidator consumer, liquidation consumer, okay? So in decentralized finance these days, so instead of onboarding big algo traders, so you just let everyone participate now you let everyone participate.
00:57:48.432 - 00:59:14.320, Speaker F: So you cannot ask for any commitment from the people who participate. So platform do offer a discount, but this discount is shared with the miners, with the so called mev. So the outcome eventually is that liquidators only liquidate if it's convenient to them, most likely if they can immediately arbitrage it with uniswap or other platforms. And uniswap liquidity gets bigger and bigger, right? But still you cannot liquidate there with proper slippage more than few million. So this is not something that can bring you to BitMax level. And BitMax already has $4 billion in liquidity, right? I mean the scalability there is also bounded. Okay? So we discuss centralized finance, decentralized finance, and finally, what is it we offer in B protocol? So in a sense, we let everyone participate, or at least in the future, however, we let everyone participate on a time base and not liquidation base, namely the competition is not for every liquidation, but instead liquidators get a franchise for a time period and then they share the liquidation.
00:59:14.320 - 01:00:10.240, Speaker F: As a result, the liquidators are more committed. And in the future this commitment might be in the form of actual economic incentive. The liquidation itself is being decided by a smart contract, so nothing is shared with the miners beside the standard gas fees. But there's no competition among the miners. And as a result, the liquidators are committed, are committed, and they do have incentive, at least as the system get bigger, to be prepared for bigger liquidations. So liquidators compete on liquidation franchise, which in the future could be share process. So they're already willing to share their proceeds with the users.
01:00:10.240 - 01:02:05.140, Speaker F: In the future there might be auctions around that a smart contract decide who gets to liquidate specific user at a specific time and users share the proceeds with the liquidator. So liquidator gets certainty, but lower liquidation penalty, which most are happy with, because liquidation penalty in DeFi are still relatively high, the platform get committed, liquidators and user get a bit more than they used to. So, B protocol is already live on top of existing platforms and the core value proposition of B protocol is that we take an existing platform, say MakerDAO, we let user interact with MakerDAO exactly the way he interacted before, only with some smart contract wrapper, namely the B protocol. So user deposit and borrow as usual, but the liquidators can provide a cushion to the user position, namely they can repay part of his debt. And this way when a user account become insolvent according to MakerDAO metric, so MakerDAO external system or external liquidators, see, it actually has a lower debt, right? So let's say user original debt was 1000 die, but our liquidators repaid 100 die of his debt. So now according to MakerDAO, he cannot be liquidated. So none of the Makerdaoke keepers can liquidate.
01:02:05.140 - 01:02:55.620, Speaker F: But according to B protocol, we know that if he were using MakerDAO directly, he would have been liquidated. And at this point, the smart contract allowed our liquidators to liquidate him. And every time they liquidate someone, they send some of the proceeds to Agile. And every once in a while, according to some user scoring method, this jar is distributed among all users. Okay, so B protocol is already live, already over $20 million in deposits. There is or there will be a governance, but without a token. So like here, maybe an insight is that users are willing.
01:02:55.620 - 01:03:11.950, Speaker F: The selling point is that users do not take any extra risk, but obviously there's a smart contract risk. So we see that at least for now, it does get some traction. It is enough to convince some users at least to try us.
01:03:16.640 - 01:03:38.672, Speaker A: So, thanks for the presentation. I think actually a question for yarin. So how do you see B protocol and Flashbots positioned to each other within the MVB ecosystem?
01:03:38.816 - 01:04:45.770, Speaker F: Yes, I think it's quite orthogonal because to be honest, and maybe it's a bit related to the discussion before, the ultimate goal of Mev get is maybe to make more transparent tools. But again, our position is that it's not really about lack of transparency, but actually competition in this case make liquidation process worse. So it's not really about transparency in this sense. It's quite orthogonal to the Mev research group efforts. I don't think it's really about the miners though. Again, maybe I'm not fully understand your guys agenda because even if it were some kind of layer two solution there, then still someone would or could have profit more by reorganizing the transaction order, et cetera. So, yeah, that's my view.
01:04:48.560 - 01:05:01.150, Speaker A: Cool. We'd like to invite questions. Anyone here have questions for Yaren and the design of.
01:05:03.940 - 01:05:09.680, Speaker B: Could you just talk a little more about the cushion and why? I guess that was helpful in the protocol.
01:05:10.660 - 01:06:34.300, Speaker F: Yeah. Okay, let me share it again. So our value proposition to users is, okay, you're using Makerdow, come use us and get exactly the same conditions plus some distribution posit sharing. So without the cushion, we could not have liquidating under the same conditions, right? Because then we will have to compete with MakerDAO other, you know, again, we have gazwalls again, okay, so in MakerDAO, it's been sent on auction, et cetera. But in order to get priority for our liquidators, they have to provide a cushion because otherwise user will just get liquidated in MakerDAO. So an alternative solution here would be to say to user, okay, so maybe we don't provide a cushion, but you get liquidated before you would have normally get liquidated in Maker, but then it's a different value proposition to the user. We ask him to give up something in return and with this cushion he can use Maker exactly the same way used before or get exactly the same conditions, still giving us priority.
01:06:37.520 - 01:08:03.444, Speaker B: That makes sense, I think to answer some of your questions also Ben, you're right that I think this is somewhat orthogonal to flash bots and I think it's really interesting to kind of provide priority in that way and use it to align those incentives a little better and improve efficiency long term. I think in terms of the layer two, layer one, I personally expect there will probably always be some layer one mev for whatever reason. There's just so many different ways that it gets created and sources. I expect a lot of it will move to layer twos, but I expect there will still be something that sticks around on layer one. And I think what percentage is an interesting open question that depends on weird things like ETH sharding and other blockchains that become popular. I also think in that world a lot of the tools and the research we're doing still applies on things like how to extract that mev and the ethics and things like that. I think if it ends up that all mev goes to L Two, I think that's very unlikely that all mev goes to L Two and we can't fund mev research on L One mev, then probably that will be some sort of reevaluation.
01:08:03.444 - 01:08:08.264, Speaker B: But I think the artifacts that are being built here will still be useful in that world.
01:08:08.462 - 01:08:38.790, Speaker F: Yeah, just what I wanted to actually say. That even if all go to l two so still, my view is that it's still a huge problem for liquidation platforms or for lending platforms. Because liquidators don't care if they pay to the miners or pay to some very cool research group eventually. What matters is the certainty they get and how much it costs them or like the cut of the premium they get.
01:08:41.560 - 01:08:42.310, Speaker E: Absolutely.
01:08:44.600 - 01:08:47.290, Speaker F: Can I ask a question quickly?
01:08:47.660 - 01:08:48.410, Speaker A: Sure.
01:08:49.020 - 01:09:11.852, Speaker F: So a technical question, I guess first is how exactly does that work? There is like a proxy wallet for the user when he is using both his funding and your funding. So that in case that you don't liquidate on time, who is getting liquidated.
01:09:11.916 - 01:09:17.440, Speaker H: This proxy wallet on the same theme.
01:09:17.940 - 01:10:04.380, Speaker F: Just want to make sure that in case that you don't liquidate on time, what exactly happens. Yeah, okay. So first of all, the easy answer, if the platform doesn't liquidate on time, then MakerDAO liquidators will just liquidate it. So in this sense there's no custody of funds. User does not have much or almost anything to lose by using us. But the stakers do lose, I guess because they put some wall that they wouldn't have lost if they would have done the liquidation or something like that. Yeah, so the liquidity provider, if they do provide a cushion and don't liquidate on time, they tend to lose the cushion.
01:10:04.380 - 01:11:08.100, Speaker F: Are they in charge of also monitoring and sending liquidation transactions? Yeah, at this point it's their responsibility, and also at this point it's kind of opting, not only opt in, it's like a best effort system where they don't really have to liquidate if it's too hard for them. Because at this point, when bootstrapping it, we made it as easiest as possible to liquidators without any strict requirements. Along the time, as it gets more traction, more revenues to the system, more liquidators will want to join, then we can ask for stricter commitment. Maybe, by the way, it won't be us, it will be the community who will get in charge. Answering maybe a question from text question. So, yeah, as I forgot to say, but the platform already liquidated collateral worth of $100,000. Actually, it wasn't in the recent days.
01:11:08.100 - 01:12:08.280, Speaker F: In the recent days, there were very few liquidation because most of the users joined when east was much lower. But like few weeks ago, there was a market crash from I think $700 to 600 or so. I don't remember the exact number. And yeah, there were already liquidations of $100,000 of collateral back then. So yeah, okay, in terms of percentage of total liquidations, so again, we only have like 20 million collateral, and in debt it's only 7 million out of over 1 billion of total maker Dow, right, users. So obviously we didn't capture all of MakerDAO liquidations. We cannot capture we can only capture our users and being still a small fraction of MakerDAO, so we only had small fraction of the liquidations.
01:12:09.580 - 01:13:31.410, Speaker A: Well, on this note, actually, I would like to direct this question to Alex from Flashbust Team. So the question here is, I don't know if you guys can see my screen. I switched back to the Mev Explorer, which currently tallied up common mev strategies and liquidations. As we see here, due to early stage of coverage, we're still working on improving coverage accounts for a small percentage. However, one particular point we are making in our mev inspect process is that makerda liquidations, we are not accounting for them for specific reasons. And so I think for the audience here, a lot of us are not quite familiar with mev, the definition, the formal definition, and as well as essentially maybe alex, do you want to kind of share a bit of thoughts into essentially how the protocol is touching resolving the mev problem and how, from our view of the space itself, like what constitute of mev. Where is the overlap here?
01:13:35.400 - 01:14:04.910, Speaker E: Right, so why we don't classify maker liquidations as mev is because they have switched to an auction model in multilateral die, which means they're not influenced by transaction ordering, like a dYdX or compound liquidation, say. So you don't have people doing back running strategies or earlier on trying to frontrun each other and that's more.
01:14:07.200 - 01:14:35.670, Speaker F: In maker still in the current system. Actually you do get some priority for being the first, namely they have this auction system and every bid should improve the former bid by at least 3%. So actually towards the end of the auction there is a bit of a race on who is doing actually the last order which is typically like 3% below market price. So there's still some mev there.
01:14:37.400 - 01:14:54.430, Speaker C: But the fact that you can't create a full loop out of it means that you're constantly exposed to an asset. You know what I mean? There's a big difference between I'm placing a bid for something with like a six hour time horizon and I'm going to complete a loop right now.
01:14:54.800 - 01:15:49.310, Speaker F: Yeah, like in the 1 minute before the auction end. Then there's kind of a race on who will bid market price -3% yeah okay, just to emphasize. So B protocol main objective is mostly to secure and make DeFi platforms safer, not necessarily reduce mev but commenting on the chart. So again my first slide said that while mev on lending platforms might be much smaller than on Arbitrage platforms uniswap, et cetera, I think the danger to the DeFi ecosystem is much bigger in mev of liquidations rather than mev of uniswap Arbitrage. That's my point of view.
01:16:00.100 - 01:17:31.760, Speaker A: Any other questions? I think we are essentially running very low on time. Our jet lag water AI teary eye Tom Smith because he's asleep. So we're going to run through his questions because a lot of them we actually touch on and I think they're great questions that deserve much deeper thoughts and deeper conversations. First, basically in every problem space there's the unknowns and the unknown unknowns. Flashbots through mev inspect is basically quantifying the mev in the space that you guys have seen a little bit of it in the sneak preview earlier and in addition flashbots the core infrastructure is diving into experimenting and mitigating actively. However, in Pacquiao's Roast questions essentially we touch on the second order effects and opacity due to private menpool's rampant existence is somewhat considered a second order effect. I want to quickly ask rapid fire anyone to think of other second order effect or if you're a galaxy brain third order effects that we may not be anticipating.
01:17:51.140 - 01:18:12.600, Speaker B: I think. So let me throw out a few for food for thought regulatory legal public perception effects in the way people perceive DeFi versus traditional finance, political ammo for incumbent financial institutions, mining regulations generally around censorship.
01:18:21.000 - 01:18:21.556, Speaker A: Cool.
01:18:21.658 - 01:18:24.870, Speaker B: Anyone else say random words? I think it's fun.
01:18:26.280 - 01:20:07.540, Speaker A: Yeah, this is pure brainstorming because I think most of the time we're very focused on solving the problems right at hand and we can't really untangle the problems itself. So perhaps thinking about it from secondary or tertiary order effect could help in thinking some of the longer term impact. While we're acting. Anyone here? Surya surya is one of our Mev fellow who's working on auction mechanism research, but who's muted. So if there's no one here who can think of any other secondary effect, I would like to direct that question to being discussed async in our Discord Channel, the research channel in Discord. Well, the second question, which we also touched on is in the future world, phil, as you mentioned, majority of economic activity on Ethereum moved L Two with built in sequencing. Then what is the role of the generalized L one MEB tools that we will see emerging on top of Flashbot's ecosystem? Hello.
01:20:14.710 - 01:21:07.282, Speaker E: I don't have a really good answer for this, but as Phil mentioned kind of briefly early on, it will still be L One activity, right? Even when you have L Two, you still use L One as your trust layer. And there's some interactions between layer one and layer two. And there's actually new vectors of attacks as well. And Mev attacks between layer one and layer two related to submitting a fraud proof on layer one and miners censoring that and that type of stuff. So I think Mev will definitely probably change its shape and it might look very differently in the sense where it won't be individual transactions and on layer two, the transactions on layer two will be submitted on layer one as like a batch of transactions and that type of stuff. So one, there'll be new interactions two. I do think a lot of the approach and work we're doing applies to generally a lot of different systems, including layer two systems.
01:21:07.282 - 01:22:04.630, Speaker E: There's still a notion of transaction ordering within a lot of layer twos. And so a lot of the research and work we're doing would have to be adapted, but does apply to some extent to that. So, again, not a very good answer, but it's an active area of research and also as it's not entirely clear what is going to happen in this layer two war. I don't want to call it a war, but just how things are going to shape up, that's going to dictate a lot of how we can adapt the tools we're building and that the community will build to layer twos. I do know from firsthand conversations with some of the projects building layer twos that Mev is a concern or generally meddling around transaction ordering. The problem is just somewhat shifted from Miners in layer One to roll up providers, for example. I don't know if anyone has additional comments or rebuttals.
01:22:06.010 - 01:23:03.780, Speaker B: I think what I would say is if you draw a box around every L two that people actually use, that's basically the same as an L one. And there's still going to be cross protocol opportunities that need to be understood. There's still going to be things that need to be quantified for users in MEB Explorer. There's still going to need to be an auction mechanism. I expect there will be a lot of different projects and protocol tokens. I think there's already a few that operate on L Two and also maybe handle mev on L Two, but I think the open source software technically is not very different. I'd be curious if anyone has thoughts on the economics or anything like that's.
01:23:04.640 - 01:23:53.470, Speaker A: Well, once again, let's move on to the next question and would keep this question's discussion in. So should protocols and their users have the rights to protocol specific mev? Should a portion of mev go back to users or the Dao? If so, how might such a mechanism work in attributing the value back to part of the ecosystem stakeholders? This is a question very, I think, specific and quite often brought up. I would expect most of us here would be able to have some thoughts into it.
01:24:00.160 - 01:24:04.430, Speaker B: I think we just saw a presentation about exactly a protocol for this, right?
01:24:06.640 - 01:24:29.670, Speaker A: Yeah, well, the question here is like how large is the design space here, I guess, or what this implies. I think B protocol showcase one example implementation. Design implementation. Is there any potentially generalizable approach to.
01:24:46.860 - 01:25:24.690, Speaker F: Although it's not really clear, but Keeperdao claimed to have some approach. I think the generalization of it is, okay, let us order your transaction, but also let us take some of the mev this transaction entails. For example, let us time your uniswap trade and we will front on you, but someone will font you anyway, so might as well let us do it and then let us share the profits. Still, personally, I think there are a lot of issues with that, but I think it is an approach that Keeperdao may be trying to push. Not really clear.
01:25:32.270 - 01:26:22.060, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the design space is pretty large from my perspective. I don't know, I haven't thought about it that much, but seems like from the design we've seen and the designs people are trying, there are definitely a lot of different possible ways to do this. I wonder basically what we see both on Mev Explorer and in general is that once you have an interesting mechanism like MakerDAO, you basically get a bunch of spinoffs that use the same core incentive scheme and the same mechanisms to accomplish different goals. So I wonder if these can almost be standardized for classes of mev and if that can inform how we categorize in our research taxonomy. That could be interesting to think about.
01:26:28.050 - 01:27:12.560, Speaker A: Cool. Noted for our research. Next step. Lastly, this is more of a matter question. I think essentially mev resembles climate change in the sense of existential threat. That's a collective action problem, but negative effects are too difficult to feel on any individual or local level. So what's the most important thing we need to do to get people to care? How do we find more people like Palkio, like LEB, who vocally write down their thoughts and voice their opinions on things? And how do we be able to get people to care.
01:27:12.560 - 01:28:06.080, Speaker A: I think that's something that also flashbots want to bring to the table as well. We want to address, point out the problems, dissect them so that it's digestible and be able to help the space in understanding the second order and tertiary effect. And so I guess we want to open up to everyone here. I guess the fact that you are here on this call means that you care. So perhaps if you haven't got a chance to introduce who you are, maybe share a bit about what you care about in this space and who you are. And thanks for staying for the last bit. I think we just would like to hear from some of you, if you would like to share.
01:28:06.080 - 01:29:20.570, Speaker A: I definitely see a few people I follow on Twitter, but I've never spoken person and I'm very curious why you're here. If you're listening, I'm going to ask Jun Yu from IC Three. Right, well, maybe it looks like quite a few folks are on mute or anyone else. Olivier, from representing the miner perspective, if you would like to speak about what you care about MEB, maybe it's because this is near the end of the presentation. Also my pronunciation of everyone's name is probably just completely off. Well, if there's no one who would like to share why they care, we assume that you don't care enough.
01:29:25.420 - 01:30:52.100, Speaker F: I have something to say that is not related really to liquidations. Maybe from a trader perspective, although I'm not really considering myself a trader in the real world. Algo traders will usually try to pick up some arena when they have some unfair advantage, for example, fast connectivity to markets, et cetera, or translated it into DeFi. So if me as potential DeFi trader, know that some other people might have some direct connectivity to miners, have some optimized tool which are not available to me, then eventually it will make me not participate in this space and try to find some more fair playground. So I think in this sense, mev, the real issue is maybe not the user who get frontal in uniswap, but actually a lot of traders who don't join the space and as a result, maybe less liquidity or other stuff because they feel other traders have some unfair advantage. Where unfair, sometimes just a lot of they have a lot of blockchain knowledge. Or maybe unfair because they have direct connection with miners.
01:30:54.680 - 01:31:56.868, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's a really interesting point. I think Budhist Crampton and Shim wrote a bunch of papers on HFT, really one core paper, which I've always thought was super interesting in this way where they basically say that a lot of arbitrage behavior disincentivizes liquidity provision and maybe increases volume but actually decreases liquidity. So those two things aren't necessarily correlated like across market designs and has a lot of interesting, I guess, hypotheses about how to change fairness. But I think the question of mev and fairness is super intricately linked and that's actually why I care about it. I think we should build things that are fair for users and Mev has a huge potential to turn all of the things that we are building with the best intentions into something that's not actually fair and therefore isn't actually efficient or desirable. And I think I want more people to speak if they're around, but if you don't, that's fine. Thanks for staying.
01:31:56.868 - 01:32:09.570, Speaker B: I know we're over time and maybe if you want to tweet something about why you care about mev in the next week, we can turn this into more of a homework style thing. But I would also love to hear if anyone else wants to say anything.
01:32:12.730 - 01:33:33.214, Speaker I: I guess. Hi everybody, my name is Robin. I'm quite new to the Mev space, so was still pretty quiet and just listening. I guess one perspective that might be interesting to think about is how much actually, let's say retail or non professional users actually have to care, right, at least on a casual level at the start. Because even if there's a front running bot on uniswap like you set your slippage, right? So if you set your slippage too high, you risk a front running transaction, right? And if you don't want that to happen, you set your slippage lower, right? So I think there are some elements of control to how far you can be impacted yourself. And even if you get liquidated, you don't necessarily care who liquidates you, right? So I think that's on the mind of a lot of people out there right now that probably have never dealt with the topic in general or maybe need some general education in the terms of mining and transaction ordering and how everything of that works. Because I guess only still the minority of people that are involved in crypto have proper knowledge about it and then obviously crypto and everything is a lot driven by monetary incentives, right? And a lot of people still don't see big monetary opportunity there necessarily, which obviously isn't true.
01:33:33.214 - 01:33:39.860, Speaker I: So I guess a lot of people still don't have proper understanding about that. So I would say it's maybe just an educational question as.
01:33:43.510 - 01:34:35.700, Speaker E: Say thank you Robin. I will say one thing that I think you can also add to. I mean, user concern could also be around Flash loans and Flash loan enabled hacks, right? Because that is somewhat mev that affects users directly in a way that is meaningful to them. And so that could be one way to attract the user's attention related to being more careful about mev. In that case, it's more about changing the standards, right, in terms of the control that you mentioned. So having a slippage limit is somewhat of Mev control. I definitely think there should be more of such tools and generally more thinking around the different surfaces of, quote, unquote, mev extraction in these protocols, just adding that.
01:34:36.470 - 01:35:19.940, Speaker B: I think that was a super awesome point. Thanks for sharing. I think definitely when we look at the Mev taxonomy we should make a note to kind of categorize because there's many different kinds of mev and it's like a kind of catch all mathematically speaking, but in terms of what it actually means for users, you're right that a uniswap trade. Being slightly out of the slippage limits is very different from like I had this stable coin that someone paid me for a hot dog and it collapsed because of this weird second order liquidations thing that's totally foreign to me and I have no idea what a liquidation even is. So I think it is relevant in very subtle ways and thinking from the user perspective is definitely something we need to work on.
01:35:23.190 - 01:36:17.074, Speaker I: Mean there's also a monetary or even like investment narrative that still I didn't hear a lot yet but might be interesting, which is that we've seen upticks in the usage of things like Archer Dao as well, right, seen Keeper for example, use it for some transactions and obviously people are wondering what is going on. Right, and even from an investment perspective, obviously people are interested in Archer because they have a token and it can pump and they can make money, but the relevance of hash rate will be quite important in the future as well. Right, so that might be an interesting topic there as well. And basically if mev starts being more important there might be some direct value adds to people who actually have a certain control of hash rate. So that might be also an investor narrative that could actually catch up, which I haven't seen out there a lot.
01:36:17.112 - 01:36:20.378, Speaker C: Yet, which then might bring the intersection.
01:36:20.414 - 01:36:44.700, Speaker B: Of tokens and Mev is like one of those unknown unknowns that Tom was asking about that maybe we should actually write down. I think that could easily yield very interesting results. So yeah, I totally agree that we need to improve a lot of things about how we understand these things, even ourselves and how we communicate them.
01:36:50.710 - 01:37:42.434, Speaker A: Yeah, I think everyone here on this call is participating in defining the space itself and furthering our own understanding and so that we could better inform the community at large. Well, I think we're ten minutes over time, so thank you guys so much for joining. Actually, I do think Twitter discussions of these rose questions are a better outlet to get more people who may be interested to care. So I would suggest you tweet out your thoughts on some of these research rose questions and your opinions if you didn't get a chance to speak here or you would like to share in other form. Thank you.
01:37:42.472 - 01:38:00.422, Speaker B: Yeah, I might take these and start doing like an Mev question of the day. Like all the backlogs we generate, like just tweeting it out every day. I think that might be fun or something like that. I don't know. Maybe we should do that as an organization. I don't know. We can talk about it, but yeah, I think some more discussion would be good in a more async way.
01:38:00.422 - 01:38:03.846, Speaker B: And thank you guys all for being here and staying over time.
01:38:04.028 - 01:38:08.600, Speaker A: Yes. Thanks, guys. Have a good one.
01:38:10.730 - 01:38:13.740, Speaker E: Thank you guys for joining. Bye. It.
