00:00:02.680 - 00:00:24.646, Speaker A: I'm Robert, I'm a steward at Flashbots. We're here talking about Nev, and we have a scene panel. Karthick maps Ed and Marcus here. So we will skip introductions and just get into it. So the contact said, I don't know that everyone knows what LVR is. Can one of you give a few sentence summary of what LDR is, why.
00:00:24.718 - 00:00:26.010, Speaker B: We talk about it?
00:00:26.760 - 00:00:28.260, Speaker C: Yeah, I think how I.
00:00:30.760 - 00:00:58.370, Speaker D: 12 seconds, I guess bring it back to sandwiches, right. This is basically uninformed users. Green Order has some nice footage. And now there is a market that's created by ordering this with other transactions that touch the same state, giving the user where it says huge profit from the YouTube. Now, LVR is different. It's kind of the information that is in 12 seconds.
00:01:03.030 - 00:01:04.382, Speaker C: Pricing contingency.
00:01:04.446 - 00:01:19.022, Speaker D: Right. And because price on Ethereum only updates in 12 seconds. Now, if there's any volatility realized off chain, this is basically taking or optioning off the opportunity to take liquidity from LP's that should be better than what.
00:01:19.046 - 00:01:19.892, Speaker A: The true price is.
00:01:20.006 - 00:01:41.940, Speaker D: And this causes officers lose a lot of money, over $750 million this year. So it's probably from values and they are getting this value back to the closers. So I think that we all agree we can make more competitive options that we.
00:01:46.330 - 00:02:00.906, Speaker C: I can try to simply to narrow it down like one sentence. LDRs, the loss that LP specifically made because they offer prices that are out of line with the current marketplaces they're selling to.
00:02:00.938 - 00:02:01.550, Speaker B: Chip.
00:02:03.610 - 00:02:20.670, Speaker A: Auction has a twelve second heartbeat, at least on ether one, and constantly decentralized exchanges or feeding prices update. So watching prices drift, and that's where LDR comes from. So what do we do about this? How do we mitigate LDR investment?
00:02:26.930 - 00:02:27.762, Speaker D: Go again.
00:02:27.906 - 00:02:58.110, Speaker B: Okay, we should hold an auction. We're holding one right now. We're collecting a lot of revenue and giving it to Coinbase. We should be basically giving it to people who are. If the price is $100 and you sell Ethereum for $100 cheaper than it's actually worth, you lost $100 and the Coinbase validator who's validating the block in those 12 seconds.
00:03:00.610 - 00:03:06.946, Speaker D: But it's all function of like, the last look window for this battle for block space being close seconds.
00:03:06.978 - 00:03:07.146, Speaker B: Right.
00:03:07.178 - 00:03:31.450, Speaker D: If you're able to now build systems on top of ethel, one that have the same kind of security guarantees of setting. But now when we give this last look to the end proposer maybe 0.5 seconds prior to the block being submitted, you know, very competitive options get a lot of value back to LP's and have a more sustainable system incentive wise, while still being disempowered.
00:03:34.550 - 00:03:57.550, Speaker E: I think LPR is really only problem. So LVR, you describe it as LP's are not making enough money, maybe they're selling the cheap, but what about the opposite case where, you know, a self sufficient mM doesn't have pricing permission from off chain. It is not able to compete with someone more informed that provides best prices. And so as a result, portfolio.
00:03:59.450 - 00:03:59.762, Speaker A: Kind.
00:03:59.786 - 00:04:42.990, Speaker E: Of like the approach that we're taking is more like, you know, start by decoupling source of capital for market. So basically we build a framework where, you know, passive LP's can delegate liquidity to more sophisticated entity. They can do certain actions off chain and on chain. There are certain prescribed bonds in the smart contract. A lot of Cheggs and that off chain entity could be, you know, centralized market maker. That might be very good, or a centralized market make distribute across a full throttle network, running the same strategy, but still signing some forum just so it's not a centralized server. Or you could plug into an auction to the system and it would still work in the same way.
00:04:44.290 - 00:05:10.510, Speaker C: So I think all of those valid approaches, auctions, market makers, off chain oracles, they all basically provide the same service today, helping the aMm to not have a state price. It's basically made from the amm quote dynamically. And these are different ways, maybe there are more ways to achieve that, but the outcome is always the same, is that the amm does simply not quote the state price.
00:05:11.170 - 00:05:15.470, Speaker A: Do you think that traditional amms like U swap v two or v three?
00:05:22.460 - 00:05:34.760, Speaker B: I think they might. We've seen v two be quite resilient in some scenarios, even like. So we might see. Me too.
00:05:48.600 - 00:06:31.910, Speaker D: Depends how irrational LP's are and what they could be getting. And so to speak, even though there's been countless research and attention brought to the fact that LP's are actually losing money. So whether it will ascend the test of time is perhaps a question that is difficult to do. But I think that you can definitely make basically like zero cost improvements on the system and make it a sustainable system incentive wise, that would be far more practical for LP's to provide them to.
00:06:32.450 - 00:06:36.130, Speaker C: Are LP's actually losing money or are we misunderstanding what's going on?
00:06:36.250 - 00:07:17.160, Speaker B: Can we get into this? Like, this guy probably was a whale that came about, made like $100 million in early crypto, and then stuck it on the amm and he's losing some money and cares. Like, what really happens is people stake on these amms and they will do it. The reason we care about ODR is not profitable enough. It's going to be zero profit on equilibrium. They're going to earn the risk free rate to risk adjusted to whatever risk they take. That's fine, that's good. That's how efficient market hypothesis works.
00:07:17.160 - 00:07:39.950, Speaker B: But what we really care about is what is the resulting spread? That is what the users care about. That's what the system cares about. At the end of the day, there's a huge debt we lost because a bunch of money's being sucked out of the system for no reason. Then the spread is going to be wider. And that is not what we want. We want like smaller spreads. There's smaller spreads in trapfi than there are on chain because of this problem.
00:07:40.770 - 00:08:02.990, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the amount that we're leaking right now in the block space battle to proposers is just factored into how much companies are charging. Right, so 30 bps on like wrapped youth or. Yeah, and then like 30 bits as well as most of the people who are around for each, as you see. And if we minimize how we lost now, it's everyone.
00:08:04.660 - 00:08:29.920, Speaker C: I mean we can probably go below the risk free rate. Even. I would challenge even that. We need the risk free rate. If you offer something else to Delta, like they're actually buying a portfolio that they want, and they are fully fine with exactly that exposure, then they have, then they would be fine with zero. With a zero. The portfolio option that they're buying is the value that they're getting.
00:08:30.720 - 00:08:54.300, Speaker B: I think this narrative has been around for a while as like a coat for the fact that, and it's not convincing to me, because if you want the portfolio right now, it's actually cheaper to buy it from like binance and just balance it yourself. Because finance has one bit every ounce of feet and you're eating like 30 bit every balance of feet. Even on the heat drink tool.
00:08:58.010 - 00:08:58.346, Speaker E: You'Re.
00:08:58.378 - 00:09:02.150, Speaker B: Eating something on the order of.
00:09:02.450 - 00:09:07.506, Speaker D: Sure, but retail wouldn't be able to have infrastructure to conclude even out of debt.
00:09:07.538 - 00:09:16.110, Speaker A: Right? Do you all think that this is the problem to solve in order to make crypto competitive with tri fi pricing?
00:09:17.930 - 00:09:18.710, Speaker E: Yes.
00:09:20.770 - 00:09:25.034, Speaker A: Slam it on. Your mic isn't working, by the way.
00:09:25.122 - 00:09:26.910, Speaker B: Oh, it isn't? Ok, I'll talk about it.
00:09:29.230 - 00:10:02.570, Speaker A: Okay, maybe another question. So one really common, or a common way of addressing this is a specific sequencing model where you have an amm. It has its own sort of ordering rules, independence. The rest of the block is bordered. I think this is what you are pursuing with that's. But in turn, if you have your own answers to get sequencing, you lose composability. And is this sort of a fundamental trade off? Are there things that we can do about it? Is this what we need is like every different amm has their own sequencing roles?
00:10:03.190 - 00:11:10.364, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the market forces will definitely move to this kind of non composable applications data block framework, right. Because if you think about what composability allows for from an application perspective, it's either I'm a Dex and I'm composable with other Dexs and at the end of the block there is a mispricing and now my liquidity is getting or against their liquidity and it's strictly going to be worse off to allow for composability than to maintain control. And before you ever log in, you want to make sure that you're holding a fair auction inside the application and then having this kind of asynchronous component. So the routing problem comes harder, right. Previously I could atomically route between anywhere between. Now given that some Dexs, I instead have a satterup problem solved where there's some oracle signal, maybe a sample change price. And I know that this non composable Amm is going to execute within some bound the send message.
00:11:10.364 - 00:11:47.380, Speaker D: And if I think that I can source liquidity from this amm better than what the other offering, then I will take all the other eggs of the routes through the other amms and I will basically take on the inventory risk for the Amm that I think I can source better from, which is in the non consortium. And this is a stator problem. It's a problem that market makers and traditional financials are very effective making profit expectations. And I think that this is what we'll see the sovereign market converge to. So taking inventory strategically, not doing anything that's deterministically composable, but still very solvable and very.
00:11:51.040 - 00:12:24.970, Speaker E: We take a bit of a different approach in that you can think about our process of software, where if an AMM hasn't been updated in a while, where that update could come from an offshoot batch auction or some sort of price update from a market maker. The AMM will have a pretty large spread, but still it is permissionless and I composable by default. But if you manage to land these quotes very frequently on top of every block, you still get benefits of like filling some leg of the trade to the solver directly whilst updating the amm and lowering the spread. If there's not a lot of latency since you want different.
00:12:27.910 - 00:12:56.116, Speaker B: Is this working? No. Okay, there's like potentially an on chain that couldn't be doodle that happens to, that we don't discuss enough. But like the retail users don't just exist. They're not like totally stupid. They use routers, they want a good price. And if you cannot give it to them, then it will go elsewhere and then it will be even worse for the LP's and this present get even higher and users will go away even more. And so we need to be like very careful not to rely.
00:12:56.116 - 00:13:28.100, Speaker B: I think what happened is there was basically a bunch of shitcoin subsidies happening, all getting pumped into subsidizing liquidity in these pools. It's going away. And then you see things on Twitter like, oh, it's hard to get execution on chain these days because like the liquidity is drying up. Well yeah, the liquidity is drying up because there's no more shitcoin subsidies going on. So if we don't figure out how to plug the hole that was being filled by hundreds of millions of dollars of shit from subsidies, then all the training is going to go off chain.
00:13:30.360 - 00:13:32.980, Speaker A: What's the role of a blockbuilder in all of this?
00:13:37.360 - 00:14:14.570, Speaker D: Well, I think right now the marketing blockbusting is very, because it's very profitable to be able to compete at these sophisticated opportunities and also be able to in some sense price that competition if I'm building the entire block. And now let's say there's one searcher who is beating me consistently at just targeting the EQC on et cetera. I feasibly through building the entire block and arbing perhaps the top 80 tokens on central changes can now just say I'm going to censor him to oblivion until he stops. Harbinger's fair. And then I can go back to.
00:14:14.610 - 00:14:16.230, Speaker C: Harbing it and make money.
00:14:16.930 - 00:15:02.916, Speaker D: And given that dynamic, this is very centralizing, obviously not competitive or as competitive as you can in the framework where apps take control of their state. Now the blockbusting job is rings, right? You essentially have applications modules, they are not touching flipped and state. So the blockbuster would just have to do a check that, okay, this is actually good to go. That none of the users of the application specific modules in the block are trying to toss everyone by sending things like by wiping out their funds and bidding up to getting boot in the transaction prior to the application. But in this case, now you visibly see that anyone, unlike a consumer hardware.
00:15:02.948 - 00:15:04.324, Speaker A: Device, could build blocks.
00:15:04.372 - 00:15:08.600, Speaker D: If all applications move to this state block framework.
00:15:09.260 - 00:15:49.682, Speaker C: Yeah. I think there's probably two quite opposing options for blockbusters. One is that they become very simple, that there isn't much contentious states to sequence anymore, and that there is not much me need to be captured, therefore not that much value in private order flow. And then blockbuster becomes simple. Or that you actually, because the buckler has the last look, use the blockbuilder to be the auctioneer, and the blockbuilder becomes a crucial part of the auction. And giving back the mev to user. If the transaction exposes this optionality, then the blockbuster could become the option.
00:15:49.682 - 00:15:56.762, Speaker C: I don't have a strict preference, but is it two quite strictly different features you can see from blockbusters?
00:15:56.906 - 00:16:11.480, Speaker B: I have a strict preference for not making the blockbuilders the auctioneer for LVR, because we know that in other scenarios where we made them the auctioneer, they have not exactly done what they said they were going to do. You know this.
00:16:13.980 - 00:16:16.480, Speaker A: Is there something specific you want to talk about?
00:16:16.860 - 00:16:39.650, Speaker B: I'm just saying, I mean, it's like when you sell them, hey, run this auction, you can't tell us exactly what's going on, because that's all of your alpha. But trust, we'll trust you to get back money. And then they don't necessarily do it, and you catch them, you say, don't do that, but they're 30% of the blocks. You can't really pick them up for good.
00:16:40.630 - 00:17:19.230, Speaker A: Approximately how it works, yeah, I feel like there's a general set of rules, particularly around reporter flow, that block builders do generally directionally try to follow. But there's all sorts of weird edge cases, and it's not always clear how to live up to the particular rules. We had a case the other day where we sent a block really early on that was supposed to give the user a refund, and we built that block really early in a way that didn't give the user all that much refund. And really late in the block, the big refund came in, and we didn't get cancellation to a relay in time.
00:17:19.270 - 00:17:20.390, Speaker B: Just because of timing.
00:17:20.550 - 00:17:35.372, Speaker A: People got upset at us. It's like we're trying. The timing of the system doesn't work in a way, anyway. That's to say that I feel like directionally, people are trying to. But there are cracks all over the system.
00:17:35.556 - 00:18:01.900, Speaker B: No, but this is like, your flashbots is a good actor, but the fact that these kind of things can happen to somebody who's a gray actor means that the gray actor can say, oops, I messed up, I forgot to cancel it. And I rather do not pay out because of it. And what are we doing that scenario? Because they could just as easily have.
00:18:01.940 - 00:18:18.452, Speaker A: Done it on purpose. I agree with that. Yeah, I agree with that. What happens to the building and searching market if LDR doesn't exist anymore? Does it just resolve down into those two different paradigms that market's laying on? Or is there something else that goes.
00:18:18.476 - 00:18:19.436, Speaker E: On in the market?
00:18:19.628 - 00:19:01.988, Speaker B: Well, I mean it's a lot smaller, which is kind of what we like to see, I guess. I don't think we necessarily need a huge apparatus of people doing something about lasers. And right now the design is such that like it would be even worse if it wasn't a blood sucking apparatus. So we have to have it. But I would like to see an ethereum that is less extractive overall. If we got rid of a huge chunk of the overall revenues that would just be going down. And when that happens, there's less reason to invest capital and investors or whatever.
00:19:02.124 - 00:19:02.800, Speaker A: So.
00:19:04.620 - 00:19:14.690, Speaker E: I think it's really our job as application developers to make their life so easy that they either become solvers or they just include join with how much work.
00:19:16.190 - 00:19:37.890, Speaker D: Yeah, the supervisor will still be there, still competing on the same opportunity, just redirecting it to the right party and also making it more decentralized and permissionless to actually join this competition. Hopefully that will result in tighter spreads for the end user. Also for producer writers and overalls, like more permission to sustainable decentralized swap.
00:19:39.590 - 00:20:05.970, Speaker A: I appreciate that. Yeah, nice show. The question that I had, and I'll kick it over to the audience for five or ten minutes for questions so you can get that on the right question. I had to avoid the blockbuilder being the auctioneer. These LDR options in the long term anyway, because isn't the blockbuster going to be able to seal the auction at the very last moment anyway and always gives them an edge. So there's a big incentive for the.
00:20:07.320 - 00:20:44.260, Speaker D: Well, you can like gate the access to the underlying pool by arbitrary logic, right? And you can see a system where there's centralized sequencer that's doing this and you cross it to be fair and not censoring. You can also see a system where you have an abs with a bunch of restick nodes and the access to the pool is gated by two thirds of the restake nodes. Signing off that this is the one that is touching upstate. And in both the systems there is no less than that can be structured because that's gated by deterministic criteria. That user option two and they believe it is fair and going to give them, or at least give them most performance.
00:20:46.280 - 00:21:36.744, Speaker B: I think this is right. You can make it so that the pool doesn't work. If the block owner doesn't cooperate, that doesn't necessarily mean that they get zero rent though, because it can also just say, well, you're not getting me any rent. So I think they still get some rent. In this scenario, there is a way, but it requires changing Ethereum itself that lets us hold these options and give the revenue to the right person. It's called multiple compare proposers. I've been like yapping about it for a long time, but the way it works is the reason it's hard to hold these options and give the revenue to the right person is there's only one person who has the power to retrieve transactions, and so they can basically choose one of the bits to include, and that bid might be the person who bribed them.
00:21:36.744 - 00:21:47.140, Speaker B: So they effectively have to review options, as you were saying, wrong. And the way we get around that is we break up the monopoly. And the way you break monopoly is by adding more competition.
00:21:47.920 - 00:22:02.080, Speaker D: Just for like the multi proposal design is purely for the sounds of resistance gadget at the end, but like, the applications will have their own logic to kind of interact and then just make it so that this absolute bundle can't be sent to.
00:22:05.300 - 00:22:39.550, Speaker B: Yeah, it would be good because people like, would not have to be spending so much time figuring out how to run the auction, and Ethereum would take care of that. And you guys will be figuring out all of the specifics of how to do it in a way that makes it best for users. Instead, you guys are spending hours and hours on blackboards proving that your option system works. I would just rather we take that everybody wants this, who's building a dapp? Basically, whether they know it or not, everybody wants this. So why have every team go cook it up themselves?
00:22:47.300 - 00:23:22.610, Speaker E: I feel like our role has to evolve here, because usually as an app developer, it's just you write a spec, you write a smart contracts, audit them and launch them. But I feel like you need to do like an extra step, which is you need to think carefully about what is the required ordering of sequencing from my app to work in the best interest of all users. The blog builders are devised to do that for you, at least not today. So, thinking about a trade off. So like doing these through some log state or like off chain validator network. One way to do it, but there might be others to explore as well as for censorship. I don't have a good answer, but I hope that was something.
00:23:24.150 - 00:23:25.890, Speaker A: Any questions from the audience?
00:23:27.750 - 00:23:32.870, Speaker B: I just have one about app specific sequencing is like, the way that things are ended in here.
00:23:32.990 - 00:23:33.310, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:23:33.350 - 00:23:39.942, Speaker B: How are you. I mean, it's maybe related to the. How are you thinking about censorship resistance and how it changes if the apps.
00:23:39.966 - 00:23:42.050, Speaker D: Themselves are the ones doing like, this.
00:23:42.600 - 00:23:45.792, Speaker B: Censorship model or censorship vector?
00:23:45.976 - 00:24:35.360, Speaker D: Yeah, I think, like, the good thing about abstract sequencing is that you can just think of it as like a statewalk on the application, and now, you know, it doesn't touch anything. But you stay very contentious state. Now all you need is an inclusion pre bump, right? You don't need like, an execution precaution. I think that's way too hard to actually build it out. But if we have a system where there's like a yemenite competitive inclusion pre collaborate market, and then this can be done in any proposer in the 32 solid bucket, and then any of the next proposals can just include this fund for settlement. On the other, this is not too much tech debt and also very useful for apps that control their own state. Other CR designs would be multipurposer or inclusionless, which both are feasible, but also requirements architecture thing.
00:24:35.900 - 00:25:15.050, Speaker B: The inclusion list is not opted for this, just FYI, because it's too delayed, it doesn't let you get your transaction in time to be fast enough to contribute to the auction. Basically, at least with the current design, maybe you can make a better design, and that would basically just be multiple proposals. But the current designs are too late. They're one block too late to do anything. Can I ask a question? What will happen if you guys launch? You guys get a bunch of traction with your own, like, version, and then I wrangle the troops in like three years or two years at the most optimistic, we ship multi proposer to the protocol.
00:25:17.910 - 00:25:19.390, Speaker D: You're like poison.
00:25:19.510 - 00:25:22.970, Speaker A: Max is being sorry.
00:25:23.310 - 00:25:31.400, Speaker B: So what will happen? We finally do it? Is it gonna be too late? Are you gonna be in a monopoly position and not give the, like, give it back?
00:25:32.980 - 00:26:15.216, Speaker D: Well, I'd say we're pretty aligned actors in this space, so it would be up to, I guess, the end execution quality of the user, right? Like it's already working. We can prove that it's good execution quality. Our nodes are doing the job they're supposed to, and this is strictly optionality that the user's opting into. Right. So if it's working and they're opting into it, then I don't think there's a reason to make them opt out of it. That being said, I do agree with you that controlling app state is a monopolizing force. But I think that this is potentially a good thing because then you can just have the maximal choice on that user of these trust assumptions that they want to opt into, and then they'll move liquidity to where they think is right, where they think they're getting fair prices.
00:26:15.216 - 00:26:30.640, Speaker D: And then the best markets. At the end of the day, that combines both decentralization and also less than true Ethereum decentralization. But that lack of that additional security assumption is resulting in better price for the user. That market is wrong.
00:26:31.380 - 00:26:41.120, Speaker B: Everybody is aligned until you're making $100,000 a day for two years, and then metallic knocks on the door and asks for it back. Then we'll see how aligned we are.
00:26:43.140 - 00:26:56.072, Speaker D: But then you can spin up another angstrom like DaX in the multiple proposal sense. And if the users who are providing liquidity for the swap or is walking on the platform want to opt into that and be even more aligned, all.
00:26:56.096 - 00:26:56.848, Speaker C: Power to them, right?
00:26:56.904 - 00:26:57.820, Speaker E: Market forces.
00:26:58.120 - 00:27:11.088, Speaker B: Yeah, but like, you guys are going to give us a rantiswap, why are we here? Because Uniswap built a product and now they're able to get somewhat of the next wave.
00:27:11.264 - 00:27:13.540, Speaker D: There is no future with uniswap.
00:27:18.260 - 00:27:19.560, Speaker B: It's a skill issue.
00:27:23.660 - 00:27:25.644, Speaker A: Okay, another question from the back.
00:27:25.732 - 00:27:26.700, Speaker B: I have a question.
00:27:26.860 - 00:27:29.000, Speaker D: You mentioned that you have.
00:27:31.180 - 00:28:37.142, Speaker B: Rails and it's not really that important. But like, realistically, if the best case strategy is just zero, right, you lose money by default. How do you say, what's the only big way of the only one? You can only lose money. No, I mean, there's like some pot of money from retail who's willing to eat the spread to trade back and forth, right? And basically you can buy a piece of that money by depositing into the pool. When you do that, you also buy a piece of the negative side of the LDR. And so if there's a small number of LP's and a large number of traders, then the small number of LP's will get a lot of revenue from the waste traders. And if there's a large number of LP's and a large number of traders, then each LP will only get us a little sliver of that big amount of money from the large number of oysters traders.
00:28:37.142 - 00:28:56.290, Speaker B: Right. And so I think what I'm saying is just let it be efficient market. Let them make what they can make elsewhere, because that's like what it should be in the efficient market. We shouldn't care too much, you know, whether they're making money or not. Nobody should be making money in equilibrium. Everybody should be making the same amount of money everywhere.
00:28:57.550 - 00:28:58.650, Speaker A: One more question.
00:29:03.880 - 00:29:17.016, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, this whole algorithm, I'm.
00:29:17.048 - 00:29:19.640, Speaker D: Wondering if you think that there's potentially.
00:29:19.720 - 00:29:22.920, Speaker B: Something that's being listed, like is trading.
00:29:22.960 - 00:29:26.784, Speaker D: Volume and fee income really a substitute?
00:29:26.912 - 00:29:29.074, Speaker C: Is the exposure of the underlying capital.
00:29:29.192 - 00:30:19.940, Speaker D: Inside the LP rules being badly managed? This is more given. So this is like a very slight problem in traditional finance. And presumably BLPs would factor whatever market risk they think that they're taking in into this percentage of retail trades going through the pool versus employees. So they would demand higher fees for this. And that's a question for them to ask. Is this, is the fee revenue going to be worth me taking market risk for holding a sharepoint? That being said, LDR is more of the issue of deadweight loss, right where this is leaking to the proposal, because information is accruing on external venues and instead we can redirect this and charge lower swap fees to the end floor.
00:30:22.130 - 00:30:23.610, Speaker A: That's it. Thank you so much for listening.
