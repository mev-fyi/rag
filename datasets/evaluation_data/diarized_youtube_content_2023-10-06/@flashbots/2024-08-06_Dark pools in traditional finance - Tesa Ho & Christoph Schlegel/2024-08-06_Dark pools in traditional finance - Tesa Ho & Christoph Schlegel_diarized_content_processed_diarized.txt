00:00:02.760 - 00:00:43.404, Speaker A: So I'll start with a brief history of how we got to dark pools, because I feel like most people don't understand training. So before there was even algorithms, there were pits. And if you were, say, Brevin Howard, and you had a position, you had a broker that handled your order. And your broker, you would call or you let him know ahead of time through a phone that had cords on it, and you would say, okay, sell whatever, 100 million euro dollars at this price. And the broker would be in the pet and he would ask for bids and they would do signs because you can't really hear. So everything was all signs. You had hand signs because there was nothing digital back then.
00:00:43.404 - 00:01:38.600, Speaker A: And if you were smart as a market maker, you knew that that broker is Bourbon Howard. So what would you do? You would take down that order and then sell with, right? So you would reposition your book to be in the same direction as Bourbon Howard, which is essentially kind of front running, I mean, to some extent, right? So you're repositioned that way. So that was number one. Number two is now you move ahead and you have algos, right? So you still have your pit traders, and now you have traders upstairs that are seeing live markets, right? So they're still communicating. Now we actually have like headsets and phones. So you have a phone that's still with a cord, but it's connected to another phone on the desk that you can relay messages back and forth, right? So the desk guy, he's seeing a lit market. It doesn't have necessarily all the liquidity as the pit, but he can still trade around it.
00:01:38.600 - 00:02:21.770, Speaker A: So now you have this opportunity where the pit guy is saying, okay, Brevin's selling and the guy upstairs is like, fuck that, sell everything, right? So they're selling upstairs. The pip guy's hitting everything, trying to sell everything too. So now you have two ways. And then people realize algos are way faster. Why do we need a pip? So now everything moves upstairs and now you can't really see who the broker is, but you decide to train a bot because you can say, well, if the selling pressure over this time period is in this area is probably going to go down. You've created a predictive model and now you're going to see it, and now you're going to start selling with it. So you start using market microstructure to sell along with and reposition yourself.
00:02:21.770 - 00:03:03.538, Speaker A: Problem is, when you're that size, you're like, well, fuck, I can't really change my position without putting something in a lit order book. So my orders are shown in this lit book. There's not enough volume there. If I put an order in, people are just going to move away from me. So what can I do? I'm going to go to my prime broker, maybe a bank, I'm going to have a sales trader, they're going to call around to the other hedge funds and see if they can take that position. So the price slippage is going to be better than if I put it on the lit order market. So the bank goes, wait a second, why am I just giving this to my other hedge fund clients? I think a lot of them need this service.
00:03:03.538 - 00:03:44.112, Speaker A: I'm just going to cross them internally. So this is how dark pools basically came up, right? They have a counterparty on one side that wants to sell and they figured out they have a counterparty on this side that want to buy. But instead of having their sales trader call around because sales traders get really expensive when they say, hey, I crossed a whole bunch of shit, you owe me millions of dollars every year. When you can have an algo do it right. So they replace sales traders with an algo that just matches internally. And there's some rules that the SEC says you have to have. It has to match like the best width, the best bid, best offer of the lit market, and you can match internally and you can cross internally.
00:03:44.112 - 00:04:14.738, Speaker A: That looks better for the bank. They have more transaction flow volume that they say, hey, we're a leader in this space, right? PR wise, it keeps their customer happy because they have zero slippage. And internally the bank itself makes that fee because they still, you're still charging the same fee, right? Except there's not going to the sales trader anymore, it's just going to the bank's p and L. So this is kind of the history of a dark pool. We can go into the fuck ups of the dark pools with Barclays and Goldman. Barclays was, they just didn't write down what they were doing. It just didn't match their algorithm.
00:04:14.738 - 00:04:48.530, Speaker A: So that was just kind of like false advertising. Goldman. The price fee that the Garth pool was using was actually slower than what the lit market was. So high frequency firms would come in knowing what the actual market was and they were able to arb what the dark pool knew as the best bidding, best offer at that point in time. So that's, Goldman got fined on that. But I think they fixed it and now they have like, I think they have the Nasdaq as like the third party ensuring that the dark pool is doing what the docs say that they're supposed to. To do so.
00:04:48.530 - 00:04:50.550, Speaker A: That is now the status of.
00:04:54.850 - 00:05:09.418, Speaker B: Amazing. Okay, so how do they work? Sort of on micro level. So if I want to. First of all, who's showing up to this? Dad, what are the usual suspects? Trading on the dark floor?
00:05:09.514 - 00:05:26.960, Speaker A: It's pretty much the same, I think, as a litpool. You have your marketing acres to some extent, and then you have, I think, larger institutions. So we'll keep retail out of it, because retail usually doesn't have access to dark pools. It's more of an institutional side. And so those are the major players.
00:05:27.780 - 00:05:34.400, Speaker B: And so how would I decide across trading menus what to do? I can also do OTC still. Right? So banks still do OTC?
00:05:35.220 - 00:05:40.144, Speaker A: They do OTC, but probably not on the products that are in a dark.
00:05:40.192 - 00:05:42.224, Speaker B: Hole, which would be usually.
00:05:42.312 - 00:06:00.072, Speaker A: Usually liquid securities that are on a led exchange. So, like, an OTC desk would be like, something random, like convertible bonds or options or bonds that. Things that don't really have a very liquid lit market. Does everybody know Lyft?
00:06:00.176 - 00:06:01.936, Speaker B: Does everybody speak finance?
00:06:01.968 - 00:06:03.740, Speaker A: Yeah, everybody here speaks crypto.
00:06:04.120 - 00:06:04.528, Speaker B: Is there.
00:06:04.544 - 00:06:06.820, Speaker A: Everybody speak finance? It's okay if you don't.
00:06:07.250 - 00:06:08.498, Speaker B: What is a lip pool?
00:06:08.634 - 00:06:12.750, Speaker A: A lip pool is like when you can actually see the central limit order book.
00:06:13.530 - 00:06:14.890, Speaker B: Just the opposite of dark pool.
00:06:14.930 - 00:06:19.470, Speaker A: It's the opposite of a dark pool, yeah. Okay, good question.
00:06:21.170 - 00:06:29.430, Speaker B: And so if I put my equity order. So how is it processed? So is there some kind of order matching happening?
00:06:29.890 - 00:06:45.284, Speaker A: Yes, there's an order matching. So, technically, the dark pool still has, like, a limit order book. Right. How the orders get matched kind of depends. Like, exchanges are pretty straightforward. Right. They usually have FIFo, and then it's like an allocation.
00:06:45.284 - 00:07:05.090, Speaker A: Dark pools can be a little bit more dependent, but they have to state how it's matched. Right. So you can go to the different exchanges, dark pool exchanges, and read how they match it. Some will match it based on the. The price of the best bid and the best offer. Some will use, like, weighted prices.
00:07:06.070 - 00:07:17.782, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. And so if you make a market and film or something like that in a dark product, I mean, how would you operate? How would you operate differently from a lit pro?
00:07:17.926 - 00:07:40.830, Speaker A: So you know what the lit price is. Right. So you're kind of leaning on that for your dark pool. But since you typically know that there's more liquidity, instead of being super tight, you probably would be a little bit wider for more size. Right. So that still gives you an opportunity. If you get filled in a dark pool, you can hedge it out and make some money on the lit exchange.
00:07:42.050 - 00:07:57.340, Speaker B: And that also means that you have basically less frequent sort of prices. So this is chain frequency. And since the prices, do we figure them out, actually? So if somebody, some trade was cleared in the dark pool, how do we learn about it?
00:07:57.460 - 00:08:24.770, Speaker A: They usually have to print it to the light, to the pole. So you would see, you would see the price print. It's also like OTC, how OTC does, like, for options. You still see like, okay, this is crossing at this price or this trade happened and it would have the timestamp. It has to be within like a certain time frame, like 30 or 45 minutes, maybe it's this last hour. I don't know. Back in my day, it was 30 minutes, but, you know, it could be faster now.
00:08:25.150 - 00:08:28.518, Speaker B: Okay, so it was quite some delay, essentially.
00:08:28.654 - 00:08:46.662, Speaker A: Yeah. But you have to understand, like, the delay can come from in certain markets. Back, back in my day, there were still paper tickets, like food for buy, paint for sale. So you had to like, fill out your paper ticket. You had to stamp it. You had to like, there's a lot of things that could take forever. So that's why you had like 30 beres.
00:08:46.662 - 00:08:59.170, Speaker A: And then even, like, um, even now, I think if it's electrical, electronically settled, I think you send it to some system and then they prepare it. So it's not, not necessarily up to you when it's printed.
00:09:00.430 - 00:09:02.254, Speaker B: Can I ask you a complicated question?
00:09:02.382 - 00:09:04.890, Speaker A: Do we have Clyde? My friend Clyde can help too.
00:09:07.310 - 00:09:25.982, Speaker B: Now. I mean, is it a, is sort of this dark central limited order book. Is this good design? Do you think that is the way you should operate such an exchange? How would we think about designing those places? Is there anything that can totally go wrong?
00:09:26.126 - 00:10:04.678, Speaker A: Well, okay, so think of it as use case, right? It's product market fit for their customers, which are hedge funds and institutions. So from a user perspective, they're going to use it if it's more beneficial to them. If they're not going to use it, then they would go back to the old method of calling a broker and having it split out. However, some brokers still do call around market. Some brokers, they have an algorithm that they'll just do a t wap over it. Then they split it amongst many brokers as well. If you're a big enough size in an institution, there's many options for a hedge fund to execute their trade with the least slippage possible.
00:10:04.678 - 00:10:35.668, Speaker A: Like an execution trader at a hedge fund, your one goal is just to minimize slippage. Like, that's it. It's not about making money for your firm. You're not scalping anything. You're just like, how can I minimize slippage? And how can I make sure that, you know, we're trying to get in at this price, we're trying to get out at that price. How can I get as close to that as possible? And if you do that, your job is done. Right? There's no, there's no thinking about it so much as in, so they'll use whatever that they need to use to make sure that task is done.
00:10:35.764 - 00:10:41.260, Speaker B: Okay, so you're saying market design doesn't matter at all? We should cancel this workshop.
00:10:41.300 - 00:10:48.120, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, my job is.
00:10:49.500 - 00:10:51.440, Speaker B: Okay. Questions from the audience?
00:10:51.780 - 00:10:52.476, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:10:52.508 - 00:10:55.934, Speaker B: I realized some exchange, we have this kind of order called iceberg.
00:10:56.102 - 00:10:57.038, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay.
00:10:57.174 - 00:10:58.926, Speaker B: Is that a form of comfort?
00:10:59.078 - 00:11:27.208, Speaker A: Not really. So iceberg order is. So sometimes your book is pretty thin, right? Like, say, Hong Kong Hangsang, right? If you look at Hang Seng, they have small tick sizes. So on every tick, it might just be a one lot, a two lot. If you show a ten lot, it's like a lot, people start moving away from you. Right. So what an iceberg order basically does is if I have, like, I want to get done 30 or something, and I'm like, shit, well, I can only show, like, two or three at a time.
00:11:27.208 - 00:11:58.660, Speaker A: Be like, okay, I'm going to hide my full order of 30, and I'm only going to show two. So it'll keep showing two. And with the volatility of a thin market, things bounce around a lot. You don't really see it until all of a sudden you start to feel a lot of pressure on that selling, and you're like, wait a second. All these other orders behind it are like, there's nothing there, but there's always getting filled at it, too. And that's when you know you found an iceberg. So the iceberg only continually shows that initial part that you want the tip part, right, that you want to show until you complete the entire order.
00:11:58.660 - 00:12:22.876, Speaker A: It's usually for very thin markets. If you're, like, on Nasdaq with big ticks, you can have a lot of liquidity on those ticks. You don't really need it. It's for, like, very small tick. Like, if you're, like, with or something like, point, I don't know, even though how many before, maybe whiff's not good, but, like, you know, pepe or something. There's like four zeroes or something before that, right? That's such a small little tick, increment. Right.
00:12:22.876 - 00:12:33.160, Speaker A: So you would try to aggregate if you really wanted liquidity to. Maybe sometimes you aggregate liquidity on bigger ticks. So like every five or every ten. And then sometimes you just use those first.
00:12:37.260 - 00:12:57.690, Speaker B: Can you tell us my mic? Oh sorry, send it back. I remember that it's a case us based korean hedge fund manager because running out of margin or something called margin call. And those open sites or some items sell their position. Are they willing to?
00:12:58.830 - 00:13:07.520, Speaker A: No, usually they just the, it depends. Okay. The answer is it depends on the size of the position.
00:13:07.670 - 00:13:08.668, Speaker B: Very huge size.
00:13:08.764 - 00:13:55.166, Speaker A: Yeah. So very, in the case of very huge size, what they would actually do is they would call around, right? If it's smaller size, it would go straight to the market, right? Because they just want liquidity. But if they know you're gonna actually disrupt the market. And so that's big of a size. Because if you did that, you would cause everybody else to mark their books down and you cause cascading effects, right? So if you're Goldman and you have a margin call and you're like well fuck, this is really big. You call up other. Usually there's a clearinghouse but in the clearinghouse to take care of it in case that didn't happen, you would try to call out other say prop shops or market makers and try to get that done in private at enough of a price without disrupting market as possible.
00:13:55.166 - 00:14:23.930, Speaker A: Like the prop shop is gonna like take as much as they can get, right? Because there is risk there and they're not gonna do it unless there's a discount. Think of it as when the FTX, right? So right now the FTX bankruptcy, the auctioneer is selling like Seoul. They're selling stakes or vesting soul, right? People are paying like they're bidding like $0.60 on the dollar. $0.70 on the dollar. It's the same thing, right? It's a distressed book that you're just trying to get rid of and try to get as much cash back as possible.
00:14:24.950 - 00:15:01.746, Speaker B: How do order cancellations work in a trad five dark pool? Where's the, okay, can I call up like I don't know, Goldman and say I want to sell like a huge position and then call them five minutes later and say haha, just kidding. Or like, yeah, and then you do that to try to like I don't know, get them to call around and push the market a certain direction or try to figure out who else is trying to use the dark pool or will they just say like no, you already said that you want to do it? No dice. Sorry. We already think you better have the equities.
00:15:01.938 - 00:15:09.466, Speaker A: So usually if they execute whatever they execute for you up until when you cancel it, you're good. You have to make good on that. Right.
00:15:09.498 - 00:15:09.970, Speaker B: Yeah, that's.
00:15:10.010 - 00:15:18.730, Speaker A: That's bound. Because you're on a phone. That phone is recorded. It's a recorded order. You can't just keep calling and spoofing because that's a market violation.
00:15:18.810 - 00:15:19.306, Speaker B: Okay.
00:15:19.378 - 00:15:31.630, Speaker A: Right. There's market manipulation, this case. Right. So there's regulations. So you can't just say, oh, I want to sell 5 million things, and you don't actually have that 5 million. You can't do that, especially if it's not on borrow or anything.
00:15:31.750 - 00:15:32.934, Speaker B: Okay, cool.
00:15:32.982 - 00:15:35.970, Speaker A: That doesn't exist because regulations.
00:15:37.870 - 00:15:53.056, Speaker B: You can probably do that with the current household price. No. Yeah. Or like, you're on, like, Jupiter, the Jupiter DCA book. Because the Jupiter themselves, they have their own server of, like, all the DCA that is going on. Yeah.
00:15:53.088 - 00:16:07.432, Speaker A: Crypto, no regulation. Just know front running. Right. This is not legal advice. We don't give any legal advice for trading advice.
00:16:07.576 - 00:16:17.990, Speaker B: Perfect regulation in crypto. Our regulation to code. Because one day I was thinking, like, when I was using Jupiter and there was.
00:16:20.410 - 00:16:24.190, Speaker A: Safer name and say exactly what strategy you're trying to.
00:16:25.130 - 00:16:49.286, Speaker B: Because I was thinking about the Jupyter's DCA, which is all running on their centralized book, on their aws. And I was like, oh, my God. Jupiter has so much market advantage because they see everyone trying DCA into and out of certain position, and they're in such a good position as well. I was like, gosh, imagine you being a Jupyter operator. You have so much fun just internally.
00:16:49.398 - 00:16:52.530, Speaker A: It depends where they're registered as their energy. Right.
00:16:53.310 - 00:17:30.516, Speaker B: Probably not in USA. Okay, any more questions? I have one you want to destroy. All right, let's do it. I guess it's more of, like, already maybe a bit of a research question, but do you have any opinions or thoughts about what is the impact of publishing the trade versus maybe not publishing it to the mid book later once.
00:17:30.548 - 00:17:33.364, Speaker A: It'S celebrated in tri fi?
00:17:33.412 - 00:17:33.724, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:33.772 - 00:17:35.108, Speaker A: Oh, you have to publish it.
00:17:35.204 - 00:17:35.676, Speaker B: Okay.
00:17:35.748 - 00:17:37.560, Speaker A: Yeah. There's no, you have to publish.
00:17:40.300 - 00:17:43.396, Speaker B: A big trade already set. It shows up.
00:17:43.548 - 00:18:04.092, Speaker A: That's usually so if you see, like, you see a trade and it happened off chain, you're like, oh, fuck. But it's already too late. Right. So it doesn't disrupt the market. So you can make some sort of assumption, but you don't know if somebody was buying or somebody's selling. Right. So you don't actually know where the, you know, there's no information leakage in that side unless you know exactly who is doing that.
00:18:04.092 - 00:18:06.640, Speaker A: But you wouldn't know in that situation.
00:18:13.100 - 00:18:20.800, Speaker B: Yeah. Give a follow up to that one or. Yeah, you said unless you know. You said unless you know who.
00:18:24.790 - 00:18:36.526, Speaker A: Because you would. If you know who the party is, like most hedge funds, they have to, I think, report, at least in the US, a 13 f quarterly summation of the positions.
00:18:36.638 - 00:18:36.886, Speaker B: Right.
00:18:36.918 - 00:18:45.690, Speaker A: So if you know who that party was, you already know what their previous position was. Right. You can have an idea. Okay. Adding, subtracting, whatever.
00:18:47.630 - 00:19:05.860, Speaker B: I got a two part question. First up is. Yeah, anyway, first one is could you maybe go over like three different types of architectural designs of dark pools? Like how do they actually work?
00:19:08.440 - 00:19:10.720, Speaker A: This is their topic for building things.
00:19:10.840 - 00:19:24.850, Speaker B: Yeah, but just like give the, give the basic idea. And second, what is the impact dark pools on? Like the public market? If more liquidity goes into a dark pool for large trades, how does it impact liquidity of the public market?
00:19:25.670 - 00:19:58.134, Speaker A: So I'll do the second one first. Well, just in the, like the last example, ideally with that dark pool, you wouldn't have an impact on the lit market. Right. You're trying to minimize it. So you just know that somebody traded, something happened, but you don't know whether or not the knowledge was in one direction or another. So ideally it's just some sort of crossing. Maybe somebody has some sort of thing.
00:19:58.134 - 00:20:13.390, Speaker A: I mean, you can kind of guess because, okay, somebody was initial seller because the price is a little bit lower or stuff like that. But if it's, if the dark pool is done right and it's crossed at the mid price, you would have no idea. Right. So, so then it's just like, oh, people were interested. There was a trade.
00:20:15.450 - 00:20:20.230, Speaker B: What percent of the market or a given market is dark?
00:20:20.930 - 00:20:24.314, Speaker A: 15%.
00:20:24.482 - 00:20:27.950, Speaker B: That's of like what market?
00:20:32.970 - 00:20:33.750, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:20:37.470 - 00:20:53.730, Speaker B: That was kind of my question. So I have like a non chat to that. What are like the market forces that govern the equilibrium of like how much liquidity lives on the dark pool versus the light pool?
00:20:56.390 - 00:20:58.490, Speaker A: Uh, that's a good question.
00:20:59.550 - 00:21:00.406, Speaker B: Sweet. I'm done.
00:21:00.478 - 00:21:42.960, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there's pretty much, if all things being equal, if there was just like market makers and banks, there would be somewhat of a similar balance. Like there wouldn't be an imbalance in the third pool. I think it gets interesting when there's a lot of volatility in the market, and that's probably where you see different types of funds trying to reposition the book. Right. You have value guys that might come in and buy, and then you have other guys who might have a certain thesis, they might be taking money off the table, selling. So there's, I think you would have imbalances, and it would really be market dependent.
00:21:43.080 - 00:21:44.780, Speaker B: Why don't we have 100%?
00:21:45.440 - 00:21:46.540, Speaker A: 100%.
00:21:48.760 - 00:22:35.450, Speaker B: Why is there everything in there? Price is very nice, but honestly, how do you make a market? So information aggregation. So it's very hard to run an official market. There's no signal that we can publicly do you need public coordination for signing. And can't you just put limit orders in based on your information? Yeah, also, I mean, the duck book is also leaking information. More complicated endeavor, I suppose, to figure out what is sort of the depths of the order book in the duck book.
00:22:35.610 - 00:23:13.618, Speaker A: Yeah. So I can, I can give you an example of the trading strategy, because this is what we used to run in TRW or the Algo team at this. In TRW. So at one point in time, you can ping for liquidity, right? Because if you're a big firm and you're saying, okay, I want to only buy at this price, you put your, your bid in, in the order book, right? And so if you're searching for liquidity, you would just throw out one, lots or very small liquid sizes, and you're just trying to see, okay, it's gonna be, I'm trying to sell, I'm trying to sell, I'm trying to sell. And then you hit this, like, liquidity. You're like, oh, I found a liquidity. It's like searching for icebergs, right? You hit it.
00:23:13.618 - 00:23:32.338, Speaker A: All right, hit it again. Right? The markets go a little bit lower, but you still found it. You're like, oh, there's this. Somewhere in this dark pool is a bid that is a little bit higher than what I know the lit market to be. Here's where this actual liquidity is. I have a large buyer here. Am I going to sell to him? Probably not.
00:23:32.338 - 00:23:54.700, Speaker A: I'm going to buy up in the lit market knowing that I found a big buyer there. And so this is what, like, algo traders kind of do. And this is more prevalent, again, when you have, like, a little bit of a maybe different pricing stream latency between lit and dark. That's probably why it's a little bit more prevalent. But you know, that inefficiency exists, or did back in my day.
00:23:57.400 - 00:24:15.290, Speaker B: So as a sort of in between solution, could we also have a shady pool where we have hints to hint? I give a hint to the market. So I want to rapidly say, would that improve sort of your x from the perspective, or is this completely useless?
00:24:15.990 - 00:24:35.946, Speaker A: I think if I knew a hint and, okay, so, like, as a trader, it'd be besides knowing what you wanted to trade. Right. So know what you want to trade. If there's anything around size and direction, that's all I need to try to, like, remove, like, move my book around you. Right. That's kind of the essence of, like, sort of front running.
00:24:35.978 - 00:24:36.550, Speaker B: Right.
00:24:37.450 - 00:24:46.070, Speaker A: I don't even need to know your price. Like, your price could be further away. But I was like, I know somebody. The demand is in this direction, and I'm gonna do something about that.
00:24:48.770 - 00:25:01.880, Speaker B: I have two questions. One is like, is dark pool similar to, like, is dodgepool a competitor on Nasdaq traditional clients because they are taking the trading warnings from Nasdaq?
00:25:03.100 - 00:25:24.046, Speaker A: I don't think so, per se. Because, like, a lot of times you'll see, like, those lit exchanges, especially like, Nasdaq, they're partnered already with the dark pool. So it's like, if they're part of it, they're just subsidiary. That's the lit pool is Nasdaq. And, you know, they're doing maybe the clearing, or it's the members that are in the dark pool and it just crossed and it goes.
00:25:24.078 - 00:25:51.416, Speaker B: Right. Yeah. Another question is, because when you're talking about stock trading right now, I was just curious, like intuition, finance, maybe it's too hard to court options in dark pool, but maybe defi is important, like financial treatments in dark pool. That is actually a pretty interesting future. Different from spot, right?
00:25:51.448 - 00:26:11.460, Speaker A: Yeah, Delta one. I feel like any Delta one. But the question then is going to be liquidity, right? So as long as you have the liquidity, you can, I think. Yeah, you're right. Options are a little bit difficult because you have to know, like oscillator, Delta and. But like any delta one product, delta one means that it, like, moves one for one.
00:26:14.210 - 00:27:08.250, Speaker B: Financed it, maybe. Last question, because after all, my understanding is tackle is to allow those big institutions to sell cycle stocks without having some price impact in the product market. So would I know? Because there are different ways to do it. So what you think the pros and cons of mechanisms that try to achieve the same goal, like, for example, like calling different kind parties to settle those larger trades versus using active set of trades, what's the trader's perspective? You said it doesn't matter. This is what I got from you. Right? So it fundamentally doesn't matter how you trade you just trade? Yeah, just trade. With liquidity.
00:27:11.190 - 00:27:34.648, Speaker A: Minimizing suffrage is kind of like, what the institution wants. Institution, by the way, could also mean, like, family offices. It can be, like, smaller funds, smaller liquid funds. It could be illiquid funds. It could be, you know, pension funds as well. Right? It's all. There's a spectrum overdose, what I mean by institutions.
00:27:34.648 - 00:27:51.580, Speaker A: So maybe the crypto side, it could be whales, or, like, VC funds, because they're trying to exit liquidity because they have to return money to the investors. Or hedge funds, liquid token funds, ETF's. You have a spectrum of institutions that have to set to.
00:27:54.240 - 00:28:32.204, Speaker B: All right, timing. One last question. All right, I just wanted to follow up on this house answer. So, like, I get that you can't have all the liquidity in the dark price discovery, but, like, that's like, a market problem. Like, what prevents the tragedy of the commons? Like, everyone trying to do that anyway. Like, at the end of the day, just because price discovery is, like, a better emerging property would incentivize people to contribute to prices. I mean, it's sort of.
00:28:32.204 - 00:28:51.640, Speaker B: I always thought it's usually a coordination thing. Right. That's usually not the best market. Design wins in finance. Correct me if I'm wrong, it's very much past dependent, but we know our also in our blockchain world, sort of. It's very sticky. So that doesn't really answer your questions.
00:28:51.640 - 00:29:07.420, Speaker B: Because it's a big coordination problem. The best design doesn't work. Why do we do this workshop? Yeah, why do we do this workshop if design doesn't like first order? That's not true. We have batch auctions where there are no batch auctions in front.
00:29:08.160 - 00:29:14.500, Speaker A: No, there's batch options in Trapfi. Any sort of, like, opening and closing is a batch auction on any exchange.
00:29:16.450 - 00:29:24.178, Speaker B: Yeah, market design doesn't matter a lot. Okay?
00:29:24.354 - 00:29:28.434, Speaker A: You're operating without the constraints that tri fi is, so you should have more.
00:29:28.522 - 00:29:30.410, Speaker B: Oh, what were the constraints?
