00:00:46.000 - 00:01:06.020, Speaker A: All right. Hello. Can you guys hear me? I mean, people on this call can answer in the chat. Sweet. All right, let's get started. All right. Hello, can you guys hear me? I mean, people can answer in the chat.
00:01:06.020 - 00:02:03.288, Speaker A: 1 second. Okay, I'm back. Let's get started. All right, before we start real quick, I want to welcome you all here and on the YouTube stream as well. Thank you all for joining. This is the agenda that you have here, but before we look at the agenda, I just want to say this event is meant to start more conversations about these topics rather than to state things unequivocally or state facts without any kind of invitation to contest them. So this is a relaxed event, and please do take what we say as points for future discussions and conversations.
00:02:03.288 - 00:02:41.492, Speaker A: Right, you can see the schedule here with four presentations. A fifth one by Hasu in that second section, followed by questions. So we'll do questions at the end rather than after each presentation. The reason for that is for time constraints. So please post your questions on YouTube, on wherever we'll collect them, and then at the end, we'll address some of them. Hopefully we'll be able to address all of them, but I doubt it, so in which case we'll pick some. All right, all of that being said, let's get started with the first presentation.
00:02:41.492 - 00:02:59.208, Speaker A: Semi v 21 or survey. I believe the YouTube chat work works shiny. If you want to check. Actually, I did send a message there. All right. Sweet, sweet, sweet. All right, before I start, is everything good? Because I can't see YouTube, et cetera.
00:02:59.208 - 00:03:14.750, Speaker A: No problem. People can see the presentation, right? There is a delay. That's normal.
00:03:16.850 - 00:03:17.600, Speaker B: Cool.
00:03:18.130 - 00:03:37.430, Speaker A: Let's get started. Hello, everyone. I am Alex. I'm part of Flashbots researcher at Flashbots. I want to talk about mev, its growth on Ethereum and other chains in 2021. I want to focus in particular on the chains mentioned here. So, ethereum, BSc, avalanche and polygon.
00:03:37.430 - 00:04:30.994, Speaker A: The reason for that is purely because this is the chains I was lucky to get data for. There are definitely other chains where mev exists. And so this is not to say that these chains in particular have a lot of mev and others don't, but this is just the chains that we're going to look at for 2021. And let Me put a timer. All right, sweet. So first, before we kind of dive deep into it, and I'm sorry, this has been probably hammered on you a few times, but it's definitely important to think about what's mev, right? In particular, what's relevant to this presentation. And what I want to address is this debate that has been going on a while back on Twitter on whether ARB is mev.
00:04:30.994 - 00:05:00.942, Speaker A: Right. So there were a few posts about it, a few tweets about it, and people kind of debating on both sides whether ARBs are mev or not. This is crucial for the rest of the presentation. That's why I kind of want to talk about that. So really, what's mev, right? Mev is maximal extractable value. This is what the three letters me and EV stands for. So an informal definition, looking for my mouse, an informal definition of that is the one that's stated below.
00:05:00.942 - 00:05:45.646, Speaker A: Mev is a total value that can be extracted from the ordering, censorship or insertion of transactions within a block being created. So this is kind of a little abstract. And so another way of looking at this is that mev is quantifying an incentive. So the incentive we're quantifying is the incentive for someone to influence the ordering, right? So when we're talking about extractable value, we're talking about the value that one can extract from influencing the ordering. And so what mev represents, what this value really is, it represents the incentive that one has from influencing the ordering. So going back to whether arbitrage trades are mev. Well, looking at it from that lens, I believe yes, they are.
00:05:45.646 - 00:06:34.958, Speaker A: And I would make that claim for all the networks that were mentioned at the beginning of this presentation. So, yes, I think they are mev because arbitrage rates are finite, they're capacity constrained. And so when several people go after the same opportunity, there is value relative to the ordering that actually goes through for these trades, whoever goes first actually makes the opportunity, assuming that they take it all. And so there is an incentive to influence the ordering. And so what we're trying to quantify with this is simply the incentive, the financial incentive that one would have to influence the order. All right, now that we've fixed this, let's go back to our mev in 2021 on these chains. All right, let's look at some numbers.
00:06:34.958 - 00:07:09.990, Speaker A: By the way, you're welcome to argue this definition. I'm happy to talk about this more, of course. So in 2021, at least $500 million worth of mev was extracted on Ethereum, BSE, Avalanche, and Polygon, thanks to the great people who gave resources here below. And I'm going to talk about this more. So first I'm going to address something where we do have a dashboard that we released a while ago called Mev Explorer. And in there, there's a bigger number than this. The reason for that is that there were many misclassifications when we released the dashboard and the code base behind it.
00:07:09.990 - 00:07:46.530, Speaker A: And we've been working very hard. In particular, the team mentioned here, the data team and the team working on mev, Inspect Pi, has been working very hard at correcting those. So this is a much more accurate figure that encompasses correcting a lot of these misclassifications. So to add even more disclaimers to this $500 million number, this is incomplete. So it is very much a lower bound. That's why you have at least in front of it, so liquidations have not been counted in on all these networks, and some time ranges for some of these numbers here on, for example, avalanche and BSc only partly for the whole year. So it is really a lower bound.
00:07:46.530 - 00:08:34.478, Speaker A: And the methodologies to quantify this are also slightly different. I'm going to talk about that a little more. Finally, it's not homogeneous in the sense where 100 million worth of mev extracted on one chain might represent something different than another chain in terms of who this incentive is for and why. And that's also important. All of that being said, this is still $500 million worth of value that has been extracted from these networks in 2021 and that people have made as real money. So to kind of hammer that point of the lower bound, we talked about extractable value a little bit earlier, right? And this is extracted value. So this is a good way to kind of see this extracted value is this concentric circle.
00:08:34.478 - 00:09:19.122, Speaker A: Extractable value is all the value that could have been extracted. And the maximal extractable value is really this boundary here. That's really what this is. I mean, it's all inside as well, but it's all of this, right? And so where we are when we're talking about that in this presentation is really like this smaller circle, this lower bound of something that is bigger and that doesn't include everything, but it's still a representative amount and that's why I wanted to bring it here. And so another way to state this term here, at least 500 million worth of mev was extracted is this. So put another way, in 2021, the incentive for someone to reorder censor or insert transactions in blocks produced on Ethereum, BSc, avalanche and polygon was at least $500 million, which is cool to think about. And we're going to kind of get into why it's cool more.
00:09:19.122 - 00:10:01.258, Speaker A: But first, let's get into a split. In particular, we're looking at a split not for the whole year, because again, there's some numbers that we don't have, but we're looking at a split from August 1 to December 1, 2021. So the split that we have here is the following. We have BSc, that about 14%, polygon, that's about 4.5%, avalanche, 7.7%, and ethereum, still the lion's share, 73.5% for these five months, right? But what's really striking here is that there is a nontrivial share of this pie chart or donut chart that is not ethereum.
00:10:01.258 - 00:11:06.166, Speaker A: So although mev has traditionally been thought as a concept that is very substantial on Ethereum, this clearly shows that mev extraction is happening in other places as well. That's very interesting and that's what I want to kind of focus a little bit more on. So let's dive into that more and let's dive into why, right? Like, why are these things here? Why have they been growing maybe as well? All right, so there are two main reasons I want to talk about in this presentation. The first one is the growth of decentralized finance, right? And I'm going to use TVL total value locked as a proxy for growth. Don't kill me for it. I know it's a flawed metric and I know there's a lot of other things we can look at, exchange volumes, et cetera, but it is a convenient one and I still think it's very representative, again open to arguing this point. So this is the TVL of Ethereum by DFI llama, which stands at about 150,000,000,000.
00:11:06.166 - 00:11:40.634, Speaker A: And this is from the great team building mev inspect Pi at Flashbot. The cumulative extracted mev, not only 2021 there's before, but it goes up to about like 400 and something million. And it starts here at around about like 36 million. And so this doesn't tell us much right now, but this is just the TVL of Ethereum and extracted mev there. Now, let's look at polygon. This is Polygon's TVL, it is in USD, we can look at it in Maddox, but it looks very similar, so it's 5.17 billion.
00:11:40.634 - 00:12:02.374, Speaker A: But what I want us to particularly pay attention to is the fact that really the TVL kind of started picking up May onwards, right? So now if you look at the extraction numbers on Polygon in particular, we're looking at the numbers provided by Marlin, not unsurprisingly, we can see that the extraction kind of started happening between May and June, right?
00:12:02.412 - 00:12:03.000, Speaker C: So.
00:12:04.730 - 00:12:30.526, Speaker A: It'S pretty obvious to look at these two things. But it does give us a clue for why there would be more mev extraction activity somewhere else than Ethereum. Right? Because there's TVL and TVL implies financial activity. Financial activity implies the existence of inefficiencies and opportunities that are capacity constrained sorry, finite, like Arbitrages. So now let's look at another chain that we talked about, right?
00:12:30.548 - 00:12:30.986, Speaker B: Avalanche.
00:12:31.018 - 00:13:07.514, Speaker A: Avalanche is 1080 9 billion. Again, the number matters a little bit less in this context. It is more about looking at where their TVL picked up. So here we can see mid to late August their TVL picked up. What happened? Then they launched their yield farming program, which I don't remember the name of, but that was August 18, right? Now let's look at numbers given by the canned people at Parsec in particular, will, thank you, Will of Quantifying atomic ARBs on avalanche. And we can see it's kind of dead in August. So the numbers here starts at 1 August 2021.
00:13:07.514 - 00:13:43.586, Speaker A: We can see how there isn't much happening. And then starting pretty much September or mid August, this is where we are, this is 1 August things really picked up. So this really coincides with the yield farming program that was started on August 18 by avalanche. And again it coincides with a large increase in their total value locked. Again, we can see a pattern there where there is more financial activity in other places. Hand in hand with that comes mev extraction activity. So again doing a similar thing, looking at BSc, the TVL here is a little bit more skewed.
00:13:43.586 - 00:14:19.666, Speaker A: So I did look at it in BNB directly. So you can see this in USD. It implies a price rise of BNB which we don't necessarily want to look at. And so here we can see actually the TVL grew before, right? But really most of its growth happened around May onwards, I would say, looking at this. And so looking now at data from Eigenfi who were very, very kind in providing this data and I invite you to check them out. Again, this starts from the 1 June because they did not have data before that. But you can see basically a lot of me extraction from there.
00:14:19.666 - 00:15:01.674, Speaker A: So this is less representative of the point I'm trying to make, but I think it's still very interesting data. So this is reason number one. Reason number one is the growth of decentralized finance on other chains inevitably means there exists inefficiencies in these places, which then in turn means that there is mev to extract there. Now, the second reason is that the mev game on Ethereum became harder to play. And Luke is going to give an awesome presentation after my presentation on this. So I won't go into any numbers because I would leave it to his presentation. But I'm going to give some anecdotal evidence that were provided by Robert.
00:15:01.674 - 00:16:22.938, Speaker A: Thank you, Robert, for providing those. And so what do I mean by the mev game is harder play, right? What I mean is that being a searcher, being an mev searcher on Ethereum became more competitive. So these are, for example, extracts of Tweets where mev searchers are talking about optimizing their code even more by writing an EVM assembly instead of writing in solidity so that they can optimize their gas efficiency more and so that they can win the auction by doing so. And you can know, again, this is anecdotal evidence Luca is going to have much more concrete data. But you can see how these dates kind of match up with the dates that we were looking at as well, right? And so another example of, for example, the mev game becoming more competitive on Ethereum is pushing the limits of mev extraction and having ARBs that are much longer, for example, which implies more sophisticated models and also more compute, that is more like latency sensitive. And another thing again by mev sensei and again, July, around the time that we looked at these other chains, like gaining a lot of TVL and mev extraction happening there more frequently, this is another kind of optimization technique and things there that I believe Luke will talk about. So we have two reasons, right? The first one is really that TVL grew in other places and so obviously the existence of inefficiencies there.
00:16:22.938 - 00:17:23.390, Speaker A: But the second thing is that mev extraction on Ethereum became so competitive that a lot of searchers preferred to go to greener pastures, right? And they migrated from Ethereum or Ethereum only to other places where they still have an edge and where they don't need to compete with people that optimize their software a lot. That I think is a very interesting movement of developers and of traders. Right. And so what do I want you to take away from this very short presentation? A few things. The first one is that 2021 is the year mev extraction on Ethereum not only grew clearly there was a lot of mev extraction and Ethereum is still like 73% of it for the year, at least for the last five months of 2021, but also became competitive. And that I think is a very interesting fact to reason about. And because of this fact, right, and combined with the DFI growth on other places, this has led mev searchers to much greener pastures.
00:17:23.390 - 00:18:32.690, Speaker A: So why this is interesting, in my opinion at least, is because we can now compare the activity, the mev activity and the negative externalities that might come from it on these different networks. So instead of purely looking at mev extraction on Ethereum only, we can now look at it on Polygon, on BSE, on Avalanche, and on other chains that weren't mentioned in this presentation, like Solana, like Terra that have ten or 15 billion TVL as well and surely have inefficiencies in their systems as well. And so this is what the next presentations are going to be about as well. I don't necessarily want to give away the topics of these presentations, but this is why I think this is interesting. The second thing that I think why it's interesting is I think it makes designing protocols with mev or adversarial behavior assumptions in mind a lot more relevant than it once was. So a lot of assumptions that a protocol designer would make in the past, where it would be more like tail end cases now, would happen much more frequently. Because I think it is more likely to assume the presence of mev searchers that are economically rational actors trying to influence the ordering on these networks.
00:18:32.690 - 00:19:22.846, Speaker A: So this was like a very quick overview of mev on some chains in 2021. And the message that I really want to communicate is the one that I kind of just described in this takeaway. Right? And the other presentations will kind of continue building on that message. What's next for 2022? Well, clearly, if you all believe in the message put forward so far as that immediate extraction is probably coming to a chain near you and that this movement and this movement of searchers actually going to other chains is probably not going to stop. And so we should think about the implications of that. All right, I think I says 15 minutes here within time kindness. So thank you for listening.
00:19:22.846 - 00:20:02.750, Speaker A: I hope they gave you some food for fall. I am happy to talk about any of this more, so please talk about this on the flashballs Discord, maybe you research channel. Otherwise please email me or DM me on Twitter. I also want to shout out to all these people that provided data on short notice. So most of the data here was provided by others. So Parsec and Will at Parsec eigenfy Marlin Protocol, who took the code at Mevinspecpy and forked it to run it on Polygon and made some changes to it. And the awesome Mevinspectpy team, Luke, who is part of that team, speaking in the next conversation and next presentation.
00:20:02.750 - 00:20:13.460, Speaker A: All right, that's it. Thank you very much. I'll leave it now to Luke. Luke, if you want to share your screen, we should be able to do that.
00:20:14.810 - 00:20:16.920, Speaker D: Okay, 1 second.
00:20:17.930 - 00:20:18.566, Speaker A: Let's see.
00:20:18.588 - 00:20:20.070, Speaker D: It's going to stop. Yours?
00:20:20.970 - 00:20:22.466, Speaker A: I can stop sharing.
00:20:22.658 - 00:20:24.978, Speaker D: Okay. And is it meta showing my background?
00:20:25.154 - 00:20:25.830, Speaker A: Yes.
00:20:25.980 - 00:20:27.662, Speaker D: And do we see the wrapped?
00:20:27.826 - 00:20:28.540, Speaker A: Yes.
00:20:29.950 - 00:20:30.650, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:20:30.800 - 00:20:50.510, Speaker D: Okay, cool. I'm going to keep video off just because my internet is a little constrained right now, but hopefully we should be all set through. Awesome. So how's it going, everyone? My name is Luke, and I am here to talk about Ethereum. Mev on Ethereum in 2021. This is your 2021 Ethereum. Mev wrapped unwrapped by mev inspect.
00:20:50.510 - 00:21:37.182, Speaker D: Alex has already shouted us out a decent amount, but like we said, the data is from Mev Inspect Pi, which is our open source block inspector at Flashbots. You can find it on GitHub. If you want to play around with it yourself, or if you want to contribute or just have questions on how to run it, come check us out in Mev Inspect in the Flashbots discord. So let's jump in. Mev on Ethereum in 2021. So it's no secret that Mev got a lot bigger in 2021 on Ethereum. In particular, from our numbers, we saw over $400 million of extracted value on Ethereum in 2021, and this excluded sandwiches, which we know to be another several hundred million dollars of extracted value.
00:21:37.182 - 00:22:36.394, Speaker D: There's a huge amount of activity going on to quantify it a little bit more. From a totals perspective, we saw 1.6 million arbitrages, 809,000 sandwiches, and 20,000 liquidations in terms of minor payment, over $300 million of that went back to miners just in terms of payment for priority to place these extraction opportunities. And so while it's interesting to see all these numbers kind of going up into the right and seeing mev growing as a space in general, what I think is more interesting when we talk about 2021 is what Alex was mentioning in that introduction, which is about the competitiveness and the sort of changing landscape of mev on Ethereum through 2021. So let's dive into that a little bit. So here I've got a chart, and on the bottom on the X axis is going to be the percentage of profit that was paid to a minor. And so let's say I make one dollars and I pay fifty cents.
00:22:36.394 - 00:23:10.966, Speaker D: That would be a 50% payment to the minor. That would be that 0.5 that's getting pointed to you right now. On the y axis, we're going to have the total number of opportunities that paid that percentage of profit to the minor. So it'll be a graph over time graph showing basically the percentage of profit paid to minor spread out, how much are people basically paying. And we're going to look at that for different time segments sort of early on and then going later into the year. So looking at March to May, we can see that in terms of how much of profit is going to miners from extracted opportunities, it's relatively flat.
00:23:10.966 - 00:24:01.802, Speaker D: So there's obviously an upward inclination towards like 60% to 90% or so, but there's not a ton of agreement on how much money searchers should be paying as profit to miners. And also there's also a potential sorry, I was checking the chat for a SEC there. There's also a lot of discrepancy in terms of the actual gas usage of the different contracts that are executing all these transactions. So we see basically this relatively flat distribution in terms of how much people are paying. And we even see this little section near the bottom where people are paying virtually no money back to the miner in order to extract arbitrage. These are definitely the good old days, early days of Flashbots sort of taking off. When we fast forward to May to August, there's a noticeable change happening already.
00:24:01.802 - 00:24:42.986, Speaker D: We can see that in general, searchers are sort of centering around 80% of profit going to miners with some a little bit over, a little bit under. People who are historically paying maybe a little bit over 90%, 95% are now pulling that down because they realize they can still be competitive while paying less. And then people below 50% are bringing their payments up in order to remain competitive. And unfortunately for those people who were paying zero, they're now out of luck. They're getting out competed by people paying a little bit more. And of course there's an interesting trend that we can imagine happening here. Let's say that I'm a bot that's sitting solidly at paying 80%.
00:24:42.986 - 00:25:38.170, Speaker D: Maybe I decide, okay, I'm landing on chain. Maybe 25% of the time with the opportunities I'm trying to get, and maybe if I pay a little bit more, I can beat out the guys who I'm competing against. So I'm going to bid a little bit more, but then, of course, they're going to get upset, bid themselves a little bit more, et cetera, et cetera. And so it's natural for these little sort of inching forward to lead to the price increasing overall for everyone. If you look at Twitter from that period of time, you can see this is famous searcher Xerox 911 saying we often see basically with a long thread talking about how bribes will potentially may or may not converge on 99.99% of profit over time. And then MVV intern actually calls out that the searchers been in the Flashbots discord shaming bots that are bidding way too high up, basically saying, hey, you're ruining it for the rest of us.
00:25:38.170 - 00:26:10.680, Speaker D: Can you pull your bids back down and be a little bit more competitive on gas features? Things like that. But unfortunately, shaming in the discord only goes so far. If we look at August to October now, we're well within the 90s in terms of percentage profit paid to miners. If we look at October to now, continuation of the same trend up into 97% of minor payments. So a huge push upward throughout the year as competitiveness increased. Another way we can look at this is just total searcher profit versus total minor payment. Over time, there's a clear trend towards minor payment.
00:26:10.680 - 00:26:50.798, Speaker D: And so this is talking about when we think about minor priority, how does a miner choose which transactions to prioritize in their ordering? They think about dollars per gas. They have a fixed amount of gas that they can put within a block and they want to maximize the amount of money that they're making based on that amount of gas. And so this is talking a little bit about the money. So if we had the same contract, who's paying a little bit more? But there's this whole other half which is around the gas optimization as well. So let's dig into what the data looks like for people doing that over time as well. So here's one situation that Alex alluded to a little bit. There's two ways that you can pay the miner for your priority.
00:26:50.798 - 00:27:53.682, Speaker D: You can pay either in fee, which is sort of the traditional way that people use ethereum, you pay fees to the miner, which post 1559, or a base fee and then some optional tip amount, or you can pay via something called the coinbase, which is basically a direct transfer of ETH to the miner's address. And so there's a lot of reasons why you might want to use Coinbase over Tip. And with the adoption of Flashpots increasing in April and May, you can see that there was a steady increase in people using Coinbase, which is the red section. But then as searchers got smart and competition increased, there was an alpha leak that became common knowledge that using gas price for your minor payment is a lot more gas efficient than using coinbase transfer. And so as a result, we can see in the data kind of post that tweet the adaptation back, people switching from using Coinbase back and using Tip. And it actually came at kind of a nice timing because I think probably two weeks later was EIP 1559. So people had to go in and change their logic anyways in order to support the base fee.
00:27:53.682 - 00:28:22.962, Speaker D: So they probably thought, well, if I can get a little extra gas by switching over to Tip instead of using Coinbase, I'll just do both at the same time and we'll kind of check both boxes. So Alex already shared these shout out to Robert too. For being the Tweet provider for all of us. These are some good ones. So, yeah, increasingly we see competition around gas usage in general. And one interesting question you might ask is can we see this in the data?
00:28:23.016 - 00:28:23.186, Speaker E: Then?
00:28:23.208 - 00:29:11.306, Speaker D: Can we see the efficiency increasing for people in terms of gas usage over time? When we look at Mev opportunities and I was on this for a good hour or so, confused. Check out this graph. So this is the weekly minimum gas used by any Arbitrage. You can see there's this giant spike that happened here around August. It's right on August 5 is what it turns out to be, which is known to be the EIP 1559 Adoption Day. But it's also the adoption of EIP 35 29, which is a reduction in refunds. So it used to be that you could do all sorts of self destructs on contracts and other sort of gas manipulation techniques in order to reduce the amount of gas that your contract uses.
00:29:11.306 - 00:29:54.350, Speaker D: And so people use this to the absolute maximum. And then when it went away, the floor in terms of what was possible in terms of minimum gas use had a huge bounce up. This graph makes it relatively obvious, but the sort of graphs that oh, and here's you can see the decline that Mev inspect sees on the number of self destruct calls that happened, trace calls, people associated with mev opportunities. So basically now that there's no benefit, there's no one doing any of their opportunities. But here's a graph where I was looking at it and it was a lot more confusing. But so you can see still that little divot around August 5. One interesting thing, though, is we can see that beyond that point of August 5, there's a rough flattening happening.
00:29:54.350 - 00:30:11.234, Speaker D: So you can see the market somewhat sort of reaching a point of max efficiency in terms of extraction of Arbitrages. But you can imagine maybe the trend adjusted for that. This is not a mathematical adjustment adjusted for that. EIP change looks something like this and it trends a little bit more like.
00:30:11.272 - 00:30:12.260, Speaker B: What we would expect.
00:30:12.790 - 00:31:01.086, Speaker D: Similarly for sandwiches, they have a little bit more of a dramatic situation. You can imagine that the continuation absent EIP change, would keep the downward movement of gas used. But again, we see that really solid line in terms of people reaching sort of minimal gas usage for extracting the opportunity. I want to talk briefly about a couple I want to drill basically into two types of mev extraction Arbitrage to start and see some of the unique things that happened with Arbitrages. So here's total Arbitrages over time. Extraction is about 10,000 Arbitrages a week on ethereum at the moment, with a slight decline recently. And one of the interesting things to look at with Arbitrages is the share of profit that's being split among searchers.
00:31:01.086 - 00:31:30.570, Speaker D: So for the year of 2021, these were the top searchers in. Terms of net profit that we found and how much money they made and the percentage of the total profit of all extracted arbitrage value that went to them. So we see some pretty large numbers here. 5.9%, 5%, 6%, et cetera. So it's kind of a small handful of people who are really deep into this who are heavily optimized for this competition, basically. Here's another graph showing that.
00:31:30.570 - 00:32:39.890, Speaker D: This is a graph of how many searchers split the top 95% of profits. So if you said let's take off the 5% tail of remaining people who maybe landed one arbitrage throughout the year or throughout the month, this is a monthly batch. How many people does it take to fill that 95%? We can see that it's roughly doubled over the year, maybe a little more than doubled from about 20 1520 to 50 to 50. Here's another interesting angle to look at arbitrages from is the number of hops in a captured arbitrage. So you might think that there's sort of competing ideas here where you might think that because people are getting smarter and smarter, they might capture longer arbitrages. But at the same time the gas used the profit amount from maybe if I have an arbitrage featuring swapping from one pool to another to another versus one pool to another and back, the profit might not be substantially different enough to justify the gas costs of that additional swap. And so we can see that there's a relatively substantial increase in two swap arbitrages as compared to the rest of arbitrages.
00:32:39.890 - 00:33:11.118, Speaker D: Although I am happy to say that since that slide that Alex used was updated, there has been crowned a new winner of the longest arbitrage on ethereum, at least that I've found so far, which is 14 hops. So thanks to mev. Inspect for crowning that champion. Congratulations. Now, I want to talk about sandwiches a little bit. So here's a graph of sandwiches over time. This is total sandwiches by protocol and this data is not as clear as we might like it to be.
00:33:11.118 - 00:34:05.920, Speaker D: We group all uniswappy protocols to be into the same bucket. So sushi swap, uniswap V two, pancake swap, et cetera, would all be considered that uniswap v two pair. We can see that the vast majority of sandwich activity happens on those markets compared to something like a uniswap V three, which has activity but substantially less so. Looking at this around April, which is sort of the takeoff period of flashbots adoption in general, you can see that there was a rough doubling of sandwiches in general. And then on May 5, which is the spike of uniswap v three pool adoption, with the launch of v three, there was a fairly immediate transition of liquidity from V two. You'll have to excuse my photoshop abilities. This is uniswap V two liquidity over time.
00:34:05.920 - 00:35:05.406, Speaker D: And you can see that the drop in liquidity from uniswap v. Two correlates pretty heavily with the number of sandwich attacks happening overall in the network. And still, even as Uniswap V Three overtakes V Two in terms of total liquidity, it doesn't become the larger source of sandwich attacks. Basically saying that Uniswap B Three is actually more resilient to sandwich attacks, it seems it's pretty cool. Something else to look at in terms of this decline in sandwich attacks over time that we're seeing is miners and how they're thinking about front runs and sandwich attacks. Back in October, Ethermine announced in the Flashbots Discord that they will no longer be processing bundles that front run dex trades. And so we wanted to take a look and see here's all of the major miners and divided it up based on how many sandwiches they've processed over time.
00:35:05.406 - 00:35:41.210, Speaker D: And so we can see Ethermind here sort of holding strong to their commitment. Around October, there was a really substantial cut down in the number of sandwiches that they processed. And they've since, I think, been refined. I mean, it's an approximate it's hard to detect sandwiches, so it's not the sort of thing they can just flip a switch on. But it looks like they're getting better and better at it in terms of reducing the number of sandwiches that they're processing. And it doesn't look like we're seeing that amongst any other large miners that they're deciding to cut back on sandwiches quite yet. In fact, it looks like F Two pool is taking most of the capacity that used to be attributed to Ethermine.
00:35:42.670 - 00:35:42.998, Speaker A: Cool.
00:35:43.024 - 00:36:17.380, Speaker D: And I want to give one last shout out just to some of the other mev that's been extracted that wasn't mentioned. There's been all sorts of long tail mev, such as salmonella attacks, which are attacks on sandwich bots just in time, liquidity ads, all sorts of NFT activity. There's definitely been a lot more than what we've had the ability to share here. That happened in 2021, but I think we're looking forward to new additions to Mev inspect pi in order to be able to analyze that going forward into the future. That's all I have. Thank you.
00:36:24.270 - 00:36:31.680, Speaker A: Awesome. Supergir. If you're here, do you want to share a screen?
00:36:32.210 - 00:36:34.880, Speaker E: Yeah. Hey, can you hear me right now?
00:36:35.250 - 00:36:38.190, Speaker A: Your mic is very quiet.

We can hear you properly, but then it feels like you're breathing on it very closely. Try speaking, like, at a relative distance to the mic compared to before.
00:37:15.870 - 00:37:16.620, Speaker C: Sure.
00:37:18.030 - 00:37:19.500, Speaker E: Is it fine now?
00:37:19.870 - 00:37:21.340, Speaker A: Now it's fine. Yes.
00:37:22.990 - 00:37:24.000, Speaker E: I don't know.
00:37:30.170 - 00:37:49.570, Speaker A: All right. Believe he left the call. Let's just wait a second for him and then if not, Ward, I'll ask you to go. In the meantime, I'm sharing my screen. Can you all see the yeah. Right.
00:38:11.920 - 00:38:18.440, Speaker E: I hope everything is sorted now. I'll just try again.
00:38:18.610 - 00:38:19.730, Speaker A: Okay, cool.
00:38:22.740 - 00:38:36.710, Speaker E: So let me share my screen. Yeah, I think sure. So is the presentation visible right now?
00:38:37.080 - 00:38:44.144, Speaker A: Yes, it is. Thank you. And your mic also sounds a lot better, so that's yeah, yeah.
00:38:44.202 - 00:39:31.892, Speaker E: So hello everyone. I'm Supragiraj, developer at Marlin and today I'll be discussing a case study of Mev on low fee chains with focus on Polygon POS chain. So just a general outline of the presentation, what I'll be touching upon as topics in this format. First, I think I'll be discussing on why we chose to analyze and help facilitate Mev extraction on Polygon POS chain and what was our motivation behind the choice. Also, next comes a few stats we have regarding mev on Polygon POS chain. Also, we'll be discussing a few modifications that we did to Mev Inspect Pi to help with our analysis of Mev on high throughput chain. For us.
00:39:31.892 - 00:40:31.144, Speaker E: That's polygon mev bohr. Our modification of Bohr client for Polygon akin to Mev geth in Ethereum to facilitate Mev extraction will also be discussed. Then we'll touch upon a few concerns that we have seen in Polygon with respect to the adoption of Map board. We further also discuss the steps that we are undertaking to alleviate all these concerns. And finally, I'll wrap up with how we think we'll be going forward and the next steps. So the motivation of trying to solve the mev problem analysis and facilitating the extraction of Mev on Polygon POS chain was primarily because there was a large D Five ecosystem currently standing strong on Polygon. So Polygon POS has currently over 3000 D apps and around US dollar 5.5
00:40:31.144 - 00:41:38.768, Speaker E: billion logged in all of these endeavors. So in fact, a lot of well known D Five platforms such as Ave Quickswap Balancer draw their direct parallels from Ethereum counterparts. And Polygon POS is also EVM compatible. So Bot Writers and Searchers would have easier time porting their systems onto Polygon if they have already invested that time building on Ethereum. So how big is it? We know that out of all the mev that's extractable, a fraction of it is actually extracted, and yet another subset of that is identified by various method of analyzing transactions. So Flashbots methods implemented in Mev Inspect Pi and earlier, the rest version of software also showed somewhere around $897,000,000,000 worth of mev extracted over a period of two years from January 2020 to till now. So running a similar, albeit modified version of the same system on Polygon yielded us somewhere around $37 million worth of MEB since January 2021 till October 2021.
00:41:38.768 - 00:42:45.076, Speaker E: And that only includes uniswap V two based swap based Arbitrages. So also, TVL on Polygon primarily grew in May 2021 as Alex showed. So the 37 million is far underestimation of Mev that's been there and extracted on Polygon. So here's an example of what blocks and things look like on Polygon scan. Here we can see an example of these transactions on Polygon POS, all of which technically spam the chain in order to extract Mev, at least as of now, since Polygon gas fee is quite low, successful extraction more than compensate for any reverted transactions or any unsuccessful Mev extraction attempts. So, prima facie, it's evident that spamming happens on Polygon and race to extract Mev. So we can ask ourselves how big is this problem really, and how big is this problem really for platform as a whole? So we did some analysis to find numbers pertaining to this.
00:42:45.076 - 00:43:33.940, Speaker E: For a lower bound, we tried to classify the transactions into whether they have interacted with contracts which we know for certain have at least one successful chance of extracting the MAV using arbitrages over a span of 100,000 blocks. And that's a lower bound. And that is around 40% of the transactions that we see in this 100,000 block span. On the upper end, we try to isolate accounts that have shown successful or unsuccessful transactions in at least three consecutive blocks means that they are spammers. And these totaled up to somewhere around 57%. So hence we can see these numbers 40% to 57%. That's a huge spamming problem on Polygon POS chain resulting just from Mev extraction attempts.
00:43:33.940 - 00:44:30.820, Speaker E: So, a few statistics that we want to share with you regarding Mev on polygon on average, we see at least 120 thousand US dollars worth of Mev extracted every day. One of these images have been already shown to you. From Jan 2021 to October 2021, we see a cumulative extraction of over $37 million. And that's just for uniswap V two contract swap based Arbitrage. It does not include even the sophisticated methods like flash loan sandwiches, flash swaps, or use of other DFI products like Balancer. So, all of this data is extracted from our event based arbitrage detection system, which is a modification on top of Mev Inspect Pi. So let's have a closer look on how we modified the Mev analysis system to get these stats on Polygon.
00:44:30.820 - 00:45:19.540, Speaker E: So mev. Inspect pi is a tool written by the flashboard team. Thanks to them, it helps us analyze the extent of Mev post hoc using a blockchain node. So it's much more involved than the block diagram I'm showing here. And it can do much more than swaps and arbitrages, liquidation, et cetera. But for the purposes of this discussion, we will limit ourselves to the high level design of the Inspect, as shown here. At the core, Inspect uses arrogant or parity based ethereum archival and it calls its tracing RPCs, among other calls, to retrieve the block traces and transaction receipts to inject, and then further classify using trace classifier, and then classify the steps of the transactions into swaps, liquidation, transfer, et cetera.
00:45:19.540 - 00:46:13.220, Speaker E: And swaps are then used to find cycles between tokens and if positive amounts are seen after a cycle of swaps, then it's called out as an arbitrage. So Flashwatch team have incorporated a few more changes to make this system even faster. For example, they have implemented a new RPC method on ethereum nodes to allow them to batch multiple blocks tracing requests into a single call, resulting in a lower Http overhead of request and response times. And also, every time the tracing is done, they cache it into databases so that later on they do not have to do the tracing again. When we wanted to use this system on Polygon POS chain, we hit with a few problems. Polygon doesn't have a Parity or Arrogant implementation for it. Bohr is go ethereum based, and the tracing of Get is not compatible with Parity traces.
00:46:13.220 - 00:47:10.516, Speaker E: On a side note, a lot of EVM compatible chains are quite similar. They only give one implementation, such as Geeth or Parity for themselves, like optimism gives only Geeth. And we do not have choices whether we should take up Parity or Geet. Second, Polygon has a lot more transactions to analyze. Caching may just not be feasible as DBS tend to grow a lot bigger. So, optimizations aside, the first course of action for us was to make MVP Inspect Pi works somehow for Polygon POS, and the basic need was to translate these Gets traces to Parity trace. So by using Gets call tracer, we were able to write a translation layer for MVV Inspectpi, and that actually translated the Geth traces to Parity traces.
00:47:10.516 - 00:47:52.756, Speaker E: And once this was possible, the rest of the system need not change much. So this translation layer, basically based on Mev Inspectpi, worked on Polygon for us. It was able to detect arbitrages, et cetera, liquidations, et cetera. However, we faced a few practical problems while backfilling our data. So we ran an experiment for ourselves. The archive node was running on Bare metal AMD system, and it was powered by 59 50 x CPU, which is 16 core, 32 thread machine. And even on this system, when the tracing was invoked, all the hardware threads were fully pegged 100%.
00:47:52.756 - 00:49:05.912, Speaker E: And we can still only manage around 1.5 seconds worth of tracing per block, when the Polygon POS still itself has the block time of around 2 seconds. So this resulted in a real issue for us if we wanted to get any kind of historical data from Polygon, for example, if we wanted to get around even six months worth of data, we had to wait four months just to extract it. And if we wanted to add any another inspection algorithm, since traces can't be stored in DB, because DBS themselves grow too huge, we have to wait another four months for six months worth of data, so we cannot really catch up to the head of the blockchain in that case. However, while the translation mechanism posed a practical problem for Polygon POS chain, in theory the system worked well. So we saw a group of students at Columbia University tried our Gets translation layer on optimism. And since optimism is a relatively new system with little over 1 million transactions in the starting month, the team was able to detect mev extraction in excess of 40,000 US dollar in just one month that's November to December in 2021 for uniswap v three, like contract swaps alone.
00:49:05.912 - 00:49:59.984, Speaker E: The nice thing about it is that all of these MEB extraction arbitrages required the router for v three uniswap v three. This is also a good example of to illustrate that the mev exists and is there on other systems as well. So in order to solve the practical issues of using the translation layer on polygon chain, we started to look for other ways to reduce the computation load. One way of doing this was to perhaps use events as Bloom filter such that only the transactions emitting a certain set of whitelisted events such as swap event, sync event, transfer event are traced, otherwise they are skipped. We implemented this by modifying the code for Bo. However, the results were still not very promising. We got a speed of around 30% going from 1.5
00:49:59.984 - 00:50:54.380, Speaker E: second per block to around 1.1 second per block in batch tracing mode. However, this was still not good enough for backfill. So eventually then we thought what if we restricted the kind of swaps that we can detect as a startup and we forget about other kind of results like liquidations for the time being? Can we then use events themselves which we were using for BloomFilter as the data source for swaps and then detect arbitrages from them? So if we concerned ourselves with only uniswap v two, at least we can do so by using just events, it turned out. Plus a few ETH calls were required. Then this is also results in us not needing a large archive node anymore. So we replaced the tracing component of Me inspect pi and implemented direct conversion of events to swap.
00:50:54.380 - 00:52:05.396, Speaker E: The results were quite dramatic. Not only did the size of polygon node reduce, we were also able to backfill the data for entire 2021 Jan to October in just around 36 hours. This is where our statistics stem from. However, as enunciated before, this system has limitations, the biggest one being if there are more complex mev extraction techniques, the component data of which may not be derivable from the event data, the system does not really work well, we are still working on it. Let's move on to the next part of our presentation on how Marlin attempts to facilitate extraction of Mev in fashion. Similar to how Flashbot fits in Ethereum ecosystem, we modified Bore, the EVM compatible geth based component of polygon POS node setup akin to Mev gets. We added support for bundles and brought forward the following features MAB Bor, permutes the mapool transactions and bundles it receives from the relay for max profitability of validators such as can pay validators directly through the payments to coinbase addresses.
00:52:05.396 - 00:53:02.036, Speaker E: And our Marlin private relay helps reduce spam in bundles arriving at validator nodes by simulating it first and then transmitting it ahead. Along with this there is a nice thing about Polygon POS chain that we were able to implement. So since we know that the Polygon POS chain has a system of sprint that allows us to know the Validators responsible for signing the blocks beforehand, we can limit the recipient Validators for bundles we receive on a relay at any given point in time. So this increases the security of bundles. And this is an additional feature we have implemented and is part of MEB Bore right now. So with this, I would like to discuss a few practical differences between MEB geth for Ethereum and MEB Bore for Polygon and how that shapes our trajectory going forward. So Ethereum has been around for a longer time than Polygon.
00:53:02.036 - 00:54:18.640, Speaker E: The miners on Ethereum generally use a bit more sophisticated setups for mining. With this, for practical purposes, a miner can run flashbots Mev Geet in more of a supplemental format while mining blocks and thus reduce his or her dependence on Mev Geet. So in this slide we can see one such setup. Conceptualized, the miner runs two versions of Geet vanilla Geet and Mev Geet, and the candidate blocks generated by both these nodes are compared by a system before dispatching it for mining to the mining rate. While this may look involved, it is interesting to note that even if Mev Geet fails in this format for any reason, the miner system is not compromised and he or she does not lose the hash power and the hash power isn't sitting idle. So the situation changes when we talk about POS chains like Polygon because there is no longer a separation of candidate block versus block that's mined eventually, so a single node is responsible for signing the blocks. Hence, the previous format of supplementing instances does not translate well into Polygon POS and hence Mev Bohr needs to offer a lot more guarantees.
00:54:18.640 - 00:55:12.764, Speaker E: So we came across a few frequent concerns from Validators who were interested in our system. First of all, they were afraid of losing rewards. Remember, in Ethereum supplemental setup there was no case where the hash power goes to waste. However, since Mev Bore can only be a single instance, if it fails, there's no signing and Validators who are afraid of losing rewards and eventually even their reputation in the network. Also, they wanted attestation from Polygon foundation. The proposition of replacing Bohr with Mev Bohr is what leads to many asking for this. The troubling part here is, however, that every future version of Mev Bore can't be guaranteed a foundation attestation, even if current version is attested and whether the Mevbo double signs.
00:55:12.764 - 00:56:00.640, Speaker E: While we made sure that the Mev Bore only adds in a contained way on how Bohr already works, we understand why this concern arises. And lastly, unlike Ethereum, the private key of Validator sits on the same system as Bohr and is accessed by Bohr. So the participants hence also want some surety of not having bugs that will leak such sensitive information. So we worked on a few mitigation things. This leads us to think about a few Mitigation steps to alleviate the concerns of the Validators. First of all, we are running the low key testnet for Polygon that is incentivized through pond our own token. So enterprising Validators can try Mev Bore without risk of losing Matic or block rewards.
00:56:00.640 - 00:56:49.760, Speaker E: And we also want to touch upon an important design decision that we made sure to respect that we didn't change Heimdal code that is responsible for staking rewards. Only the Bore layer is changed. With MEB Bore going forward with all these already done, we believe this is how we should be moving forward. We should continue improving our folk of Mev inspectpi and unravel more Mev as we go forward. We are also bootstrapping MEEV board front by running our own large Validator node based on Me Bore with a large enough stake on Polygon main net. So we are already working closely with Maticops of Validator on Polygon POS chain to make this a reality. And on top of it, we already have 10 million Matic tokens committed to this setup.
00:56:49.760 - 00:57:21.496, Speaker E: Once this is done, our RPC will soon be functional for people to submit bundles on. Our testnet is open. We welcome the Validators on Polygon to join us and run mev board. And we'll explore avenues to analyze and support Mev extraction on other platforms BSE, Phantom, et cetera. But that's a long term goal for us once we have experience building the same on Polygon. So that's all from my side. That's how I would like to conclude my presentation at Marlin.
00:57:21.496 - 00:57:29.730, Speaker E: Would love to have you come to our discord and say hi to us. These are the QR codes. You can take the snap. Thank you.
00:57:33.570 - 00:57:49.140, Speaker A: All right, thank you very much. As I said earlier, we'll take questions at the end. So thank you for your presentation. That was dope. Ward. If you're with us, please share your screen next. Let me know if there's any issue.
00:57:58.340 - 00:57:59.840, Speaker C: Yeah, 1 second.
00:57:59.990 - 00:58:00.752, Speaker A: All right.
00:58:00.886 - 00:58:01.570, Speaker C: Sorry.
00:58:06.100 - 00:58:16.600, Speaker A: No taking a secondary.
00:58:24.060 - 00:58:32.972, Speaker C: Here. Can you see my screen right?
00:58:33.106 - 00:58:36.690, Speaker A: Yes, we can see your screen and it looks great.
00:58:37.540 - 00:59:09.210, Speaker C: All right. Awesome. Yeah. So I'm going to present on how protocol design affects searcher strategies. And this year, the avalanche network had a few changes to the core protocol. Going to discuss what happened and how that affected mev searchers and vice versa. Firstly, just for a little bit of history.
00:59:09.210 - 01:00:31.350, Speaker C: Sure. A lot of the audience is aware before the mev geth was big and network latency optimization was quite important. And it isn't as much now on Ethereum, but it still is on other networks. I'm going to be focusing on this on avalanche because it is still quite important and I'll discuss it in the presentation. So, yeah, I'm going to talk about how the changes in the protocol design of avalanche drove searchers to change their methods to minimize network latency primarily for both receiving what I refer to as target transactions. These are usually messages because depending on the messaging protocol or the Arbitrage that can be created. Like if the Arbitrage is at the top of the block or background, I'm generalizing the same message there.
01:00:31.350 - 01:02:07.360, Speaker C: Yeah, this is what we're going to be doing. This is obviously like a very informal talk. What I'm trying to loosely do is lay out this is hand wavy but sort of this framework for how messages are gossiped on these peer to peer networks or like message propagation. And it's actually pretty interesting. It's sort of similar when I was researching this, it's sort of similar to how it's sort of intuitive to how an infectious disease disease spreads. Because if you view like a pending transaction as I guess a disease that's spread by the nodes on the peer to peer network in this discussion, these are some assumptions I'm going to make. The first one is a really big one because GeoDistribution and network latency, et cetera are a very big part of searchers operations.
01:02:07.360 - 01:03:26.780, Speaker C: But that doesn't really change based on the protocol or with my simplifying assumptions that doesn't change in this model. And then for certain liveness and ordering guarantees, I'm going to assume that two thirds plus one of validators are honest. And that's safe to say because everything falls apart on a lot of these networks. That's not true. And then this last one is sort of just like something relatively minor is that we're going to assume that nodes validators on the network aren't say like ethermind, like running their own searchers. They're not running the default client in this next paragraph. This is obviously very informal and very rough.
01:03:26.780 - 01:06:04.464, Speaker C: Just sort of a sketch of model of message propagation or essay in fact, because I think the comparison sort of makes sense that we're going to be using. So first here this initial state and this initial state, obviously in practice it's usually like infuria an RPC provider or some trader's local node that originates the transaction and then the messaging protocol propagates that message to other nodes on the network. And so I'm going to focus specifically on how different messaging protocols affect the strategies of mev searchers, not in isolation but that's sort of the core focus of what has changed over avalanche over the past year. So this is first, I'll give you this overview of. But before I go into how the protocol changed, I'm going to separate the state of the protocol into three distinct phases, where the dominant strategy for optimizing network latency was each of these here, which is actually quite interesting, because, say, as compared to ethereum, miners, in theory, don't have any advantage for hearing for optimized network latency. But the avalanche protocol implementation made such an advantage quite explicit in various ways over the past year and so it led to these novel strategies for me extraction or this novel layer that wasn't present on Ethereum. And so I'll briefly go through this first one is just maximize your stake to Avalanche.
01:06:04.464 - 01:07:23.440, Speaker C: That was how it was initially when the network launched in early 2021. I think that's about when they launched their smart contract platform. And that's very similar right to other proof of stake networks and even Ethereum where the share of any you should extract is approximately or your advantage is approximately equal to your hash rate or your stake. And then next for the next phase was they implemented a change called they called Snowman Plus plus or Apricot phase four. And this was due to the result or this was fixed some of the contention issues that the network previously had. And the dominant strategy here was to hear about sorry to minimize your network latency to hear about arbitrage creating transactions. The optimal strategy was to maximize the percentage of nodes you control on the network.
01:07:23.440 - 01:08:40.250, Speaker C: And I believe this is very similar to how it works on Ethereum because the default number of peers is I think something like 50. And I believe you gossip to square root of the number of peers you have and to hear about a transaction as early as possible makes sense to be peered with everyone that's copying these transactions. And then this third one was quite interesting. It was due to some consequences of number two. They only gossip these pending transactions to validating nodes. And this was quite interesting because it introduced the concept of what a lot of people refer to as a private mempool which to my knowledge is not seen on other blockchain protocols. And so now I'll go through and discuss the setting for each of these strategies and work towards why they became or why they make sense.
01:08:40.250 - 01:10:27.610, Speaker C: So, first phase as I discussed where the strategy is to maximize your staked AVAX the probability distribution which I talked about two slides ago here, this is one of the key differences between each phase is when you decide who to send or who to propagate a valuable target message to. It's decided by this probability distribution in the client implementation. And initially one of the key features of Avalanche was that there were no transactions that were propagated across the network, just unconfirmed and confirmed blocks. So the strategy was to maximize the amount of stake you have or one component of the optimal strategy is to maximize stake you have. And then as soon as you hear about an unconfirmed block in the sense is similar possibly to in some ways tell you an unconfirmed transaction on Ethereum where you could try to back run it which is sort of what the dominant strategy became. One thing that was quite interesting was anyone could propose a block in this network not just validators, which was pretty unique. I'm not aware of other networks where that happens.
01:10:27.610 - 01:11:24.830, Speaker C: And another unique feature was that there was a hard coded gas. Price in the network. So the only thing that mattered really was network latency. To achieve that network latency, you just dominic RJ is to maximize your sleep. Then in late September there's a funny in late September the protocol changed to Snowman plus plus. And one thing that remained unchanged here was this probability distribution for who you propagate blocks to. But there was two key changes here.
01:11:24.830 - 01:13:33.350, Speaker C: One to fix the prior contention issues was that there was now a designated block producer for each block height and you. And to enable this, there was now a global mempool and pending transactions were cost across the network. So back running in the same block was now possible, which became the dominant strategy. And then another really important thing was that while before it was for this latency advantage, you needed a large amount of stake, that was no longer the case because the probability distribution for sampling, sorry, for sampling the recipients of pending transactions, it was uniform sampling, but across all peers, not just validating peers. And the dominant strategy now was to launch many, many nodes to minimize the expected duration until you'd hear about a target transaction. And then now also a key change was that rather than creating a block with your background transaction and profiting it to the network, which you had done in the prior version, you actually couldn't do that anymore because of the designated block producers. So propagation to the block producer became quite important.
01:13:33.350 - 01:14:55.390, Speaker C: And then oh, here's this picture. There's a lot of discussion about this I think, in the avalanche discord. And this is just one picture that someone thank you to the person that gave this to me around that time. And what we're visualizing is this last bullet point, which was I think snowman plus plus released on September 22. And right here you can see people very clearly playing around with launching large quantities of nodes all at the same time, which I thought was quite interesting. And then I don't have a later graph, but I believe that once this no longer became viable, you can see a drop off in this chart of several hundred nodes, or like 1000. So about half of the nodes on the network, or at least a third from what I was told, were used to extract nev.
01:14:55.390 - 01:16:27.490, Speaker C: And the next phase is, for certain reasons this wasn't people, I think they were saying in the discord, they thought that it could have been an attack. But for whatever reason, the protocol then changed. It was actually quite interesting that over a third were third of the nodes were running to attract NAD. And then in this most recent version, after which the protocol hasn't changed, this is what was causing a lot of interest in the community with the private mempool was that the protocol changed such that for access to this valuable data need to run validating nodes. Also interestingly, sampling is uniform, not weighted. By stake. As one might expect, the dominant strategy is now, after this, to launch many nodes.
01:16:27.490 - 01:17:00.380, Speaker C: Instead of accumulating massive amounts of stake, as it was in this first phase, stake now matters less than the quantity of nodes, which is sort of interesting, and other than that, it's largely unchanged from the original form of snowman. Plus plus. That's the whole presentation. Thank you.
01:17:03.810 - 01:17:15.934, Speaker A: All right. Thank you, Ward. That was great. Cool. Next presentation. So again, we'll take questions at the end. So if anyone has questions on YouTube, please add them there.
01:17:15.934 - 01:17:57.752, Speaker A: And at the end, we'll have a discussion over at the Mean until a lot of time will finish. All right, next up, hasu. If you're with us and you'd like to share your screen, let me know. If you're not with us, I can see you, but message. Oh, yeah, give me 1 second. I'm sorry about that. Where do I look at the all right, my apologies.
01:17:57.752 - 01:17:59.790, Speaker A: Hassan, try now.
01:18:01.920 - 01:18:04.316, Speaker B: Hello? Can you hear me now?
01:18:04.498 - 01:18:05.230, Speaker A: Yes.
01:18:10.240 - 01:18:15.470, Speaker B: Tweeting this out. Okay.
01:18:19.320 - 01:18:45.530, Speaker A: Share, screenplayed, block space, market design. It says now? Yes, now it's correct.
01:18:45.900 - 01:18:47.050, Speaker B: Okay already.
01:18:48.940 - 01:18:49.850, Speaker A: All right.
01:18:52.300 - 01:18:57.792, Speaker B: Okay. Is it full screen? No, probably not, right?
01:18:57.926 - 01:19:00.210, Speaker A: No, you have to click on the show.
01:19:00.580 - 01:19:30.728, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm so good at these things. All righty, yeah. First of all, big thanks to Robert and to Alex, our wonderful host, because I had very little time to prepare this presentation because of a busy week and not dealing well with the COVID vaccination. But here we are. And yeah, I'm ready. That you are. Should I go ahead and start?
01:19:30.814 - 01:19:34.684, Speaker A: Yes, please, you can go ahead and start. We can see your screen and we can hear you very well.
01:19:34.802 - 01:19:35.420, Speaker B: Perfect.
01:19:35.570 - 01:19:35.980, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:19:36.050 - 01:20:24.764, Speaker B: So we've already heard a lot about how mev extraction works on other blockchains today. And I'm just here to give a little summary of what we've heard today, a little overview and how these things all tie together. First of all, why block space markets? I think good to start from a high level perspective. In blockchains, we have a limited amount of block space. We constrained this so people can still run full nodes and validate the current state of the blockchain. However, there can be potentially unlimited demand for that block space. We've seen this on ethereum many times here.
01:20:24.764 - 01:21:11.450, Speaker B: Ethereum is a whale chain. Right now, I think gas fees are above 300 gray. So we need some way to match this demand with the available supply. And that's not an easy problem because we need to figure out two things. First, we need to mediate access, so who gets into the block at all? And for the longest time in crypto, this used to be actually the only problem. Like people only cared about getting into a block. But utmev we sort of see a secondary problem come up, and that is transactions increasingly want to be mined at a specific target position.
01:21:11.450 - 01:21:54.120, Speaker B: So the original problem of just inclusion in a block used to be quite easy. People were concerned about underbidding, and if they underbid their fee, then they would have to wait longer for inclusion. Maybe their transaction would fail. So maybe if they want to buy something from uniswap and they underbid, then the price might have already moved against them, and then their transaction fails. So this happens. And if they overbid, then of course they paid more than necessary. So in both cases, it hurt market efficiency, but it was ultimately not that hard of a problem to fix.
01:21:54.120 - 01:22:52.010, Speaker B: So created ERP 1559. And what ERP 1559 does is basically it tells the user how much to bid. So it quotes a price where if the user is willing to pay that price, they're definitely getting included, and that price is almost never higher than it needs to be. There's a great article by Pintail, if you haven't yet read it, who recently analyzed if ERP One Five F nine has fulfilled these objectives of preventing underbidding and overbidding. And he came to the conclusion that, yes, it has, and it's actually a really good read. It shows that a lot of so the users who today use the ERP One Five Nine format I E, they outsource their bidding strategy to ERP 1559. They consistently pay less for their transactions than those who still use the legacy type.
01:22:52.010 - 01:23:39.924, Speaker B: Okay, block space market used to be easy, but mev has made it hard again. Why? Because we now have the secondary problem of transactors wanting to express preferences on where exactly they want their transaction to be included. And mev is a really big economic force. So we see. This is an absolute minimum amount on mev that has been extracted. It's just like an extremely defensive gas by flashbacks. But as we can see here, even $800 million since 2020, and this is a substantial part of minor revenue.
01:23:39.924 - 01:24:44.408, Speaker B: So as a minor, you can't not care about mev. And not just as a minor. This is just a huge honey pot that attracts a lot of searchers and financial firms to compete for these arbitrage opportunities, liquidations, et cetera. And as a result, unfortunately, of this mev extraction, there we have seen some negative externalities that have arisen. So in the short term, we have seen more. And it's actually not very logical the way so this should actually come before. So we can see that the choice of the market mechanism, it informs a certain mev market structure, and we will go into a bunch of mev market structures or market mechanisms soon and see the results.
01:24:44.408 - 01:25:58.630, Speaker B: And these market structures, they lead to certain negative externalities, and these can include ones that are quite short term in nature. So, for example, if you have a market mechanism that allows for very finely grained expression of where you want your transaction to be mined, then the result is that it leads to, for example, much more mev extraction period, right? And users might care about this specifically because it could lead to more Semitic attacks, more front running, more exploitation of NFT drops, et cetera. So this is very problematic. But if there's no way to express your preference, then it might lead to a lot of wasted block space. Because if you have $800 million of mev on the table, then searchers and miners are going to use some way to extract that money. So it's just a matter of how and what are the negative externalities of their approach. And in the long run we have to be very concerned about concentration in both the block producer and the block builder cell.
01:25:58.630 - 01:27:22.380, Speaker B: So, for example, if miners start to extract all of the mev themselves, then this massively raises the barrier to entry to be a miner and really hurts the decentralization of the blockchain to the point where there might only be one miner who can compete, because they have the dominant MEB strategy and they are all proprietary in nature. But equally you can have a really decentralized block producer set. But there's one searcher, for example, one financial firm that sends their blocks to all the miners and that firm is so much better than everybody else that basically even if they started censoring some users over others, they would still be so profitable that people cannot do anything against it. So miners don't really have a choice to switch to a different producer who doesn't censor. So it's actually really important that the market for mining and the market for searching that they both stay reasonably competitive. So we know we want to minimize these negative externalities question how? And the answer is via backward deduction. So we go from these negative externalities, we see how they arise from certain mev market structures and these tend to be the result of specific choice of the mev market mechanism.
01:27:22.380 - 01:28:19.616, Speaker B: And in the wild we have seen a bunch of different of those and we had some time to study them. So on Ethereum, for the longest time we used to have transparent batched auctions, also called PGAs priority gas auctions. Today most mev extraction has moved from PGAs to sealed bit batched auctions that happen in the flashboards relay. We have seen some chains, for example Arbitrum experiment with first come, first serve approaches. So they have a single sequencer and that sequencer processes transactions in the order that they have first seen it. And then finally another popular approach is that of randomization. So you collect orders, you batch them, same as in PGA, but then you randomize them once.
01:28:19.616 - 01:29:08.800, Speaker B: So I think a chain that does this might be, I'm not actually sure if any chain does this right now in the wild. I know it's on NIA's Roadmap. I think it's on Osmosis Roadmap. But this is definitely like an approach that has been known for a long time and we can understand the dynamics that it would create. So we will go through some examples now of how the market mechanism informs the dominant strategy and creating the following negative externalities. So, Ethereum used to have a PGA. PGA means that basically all of the biding both for inclusion but also for the position in the block, tended to happen inside the public mempool.
01:29:08.800 - 01:29:50.764, Speaker B: And priority was simply mediated via the gas price. That's why they used to call it the priority gas auction. So if you wanted, for example, to be on top of the block, then you just paid a very high gas price because miners would sort all of the transactions by gas price. They had this very simple sorting algorithm basically. And if you saw a transaction and you wanted to front run the transaction, then you looked at the gas price of that transaction and you just bid very slightly more. Okay? So you would be inserted right before, et cetera. And for back running, you used to slightly underbid and so on.
01:29:50.764 - 01:30:46.572, Speaker B: But the problem here was that the bits of like as everybody saw each other's bits, there was a very big incentive to just constantly update your bit. So this caused a lot of strain on the p, two p layer and the mempool. And it was a game where as a searcher, as an mev extractor, you needed very good latency and you needed a very good view of the transaction pool. So you always knew when you had been outbid. So it was a game very much of speed. And what it led to was a lot of failed transactions because even though searchers knew when they were outbid and they could sort of replace their transaction with one that paid very little gas, still this did not work all the time in practice. And so about, I think for some time, more than 5% of block space was actually filled with failed transactions in Ethereum.
01:30:46.572 - 01:31:33.496, Speaker B: So this was not great. Because of the high unreliability in extracting mev, it created a significant incentive for vertical integration. So vertical integration means that a producer owns all layers of the supply chain. And the supply chain in mining is basically the order of transactions in the block, right? So if you look at flashboards today, then you basically have the opposite of vertical integration and you have division of labor where miners receive at least part of their block ordering from a specialized marketplace that tells them which mev transactions to include.
01:31:33.528 - 01:31:33.688, Speaker C: Right?
01:31:33.714 - 01:32:53.530, Speaker B: And this is sort of public for all the miners, but this is not the standard outcome like the guaranteed outcome. Right? So this is something that you have to actively work towards. And in PGA, because of the high unreliability of mev extraction, basically there was a big incentive for miners to just start extracting mev themselves and not just high unreliability. Also if the market for searching is not very competitive, so there are very few searchers and they control a lot of the mev activity like a certain opportunity, such as front running, then the result is that these searchers are the price setters, so they can pay a very low because they have no competition, right? So they can pay a very low amount of their revenue to the miner. And this further increases the incentive for the miner to just extract the mev themselves. And we saw this, I think there was a time where some mining pools started to extract their own mev and they eventually most of them stopped doing this and instead adopted flashboards, but without flashboards. This is some of the outcome that could have happened.
01:32:53.530 - 01:33:54.136, Speaker B: However, I said a lot of good things about flashboards. So we are with a sealed bit auction mechanism and what this does is everybody basically only submits one bid instead of many. So your incentive now, because you can't update your bid, is just to bid the highest that you're willing to bid, which is very good for the miner. And instead of competing on latency, now all of a sudden the searchers are competing on gas efficiency. So they want to create or finish their Arbitrage opportunity or their mev transaction with as little gas as possible. And this is great for users, right, because it frees up a lot of block space on the chain. However, there is one negative externality here as well, which is simply that because it is now so easy to express preference on your transaction and stay exactly where you want to be mined in the chain, that this leads to more mev extraction, period.
01:33:54.136 - 01:34:08.210, Speaker B: And this has some negative externality on the users who suffer from more Semitic attacks. Another example, how much time do we have left, by the way? That would be quite.
01:34:10.580 - 01:34:12.464, Speaker A: Ten minutes or so, maybe a little.
01:34:12.582 - 01:34:14.128, Speaker B: Okay, that's perfect, that's perfect.
01:34:14.214 - 01:34:19.364, Speaker A: We want to leave like 15 to 20 minutes for question and it's 37, so let's say eight minutes.
01:34:19.562 - 01:34:52.336, Speaker B: Okay. So, another example here is BSc Binance smart chain. So Binance smart chain is very similar to Ethereum. It also has public mempool. Basically it just has a lot bigger block size and shorter block time. So I think block time on BSE is around 5 seconds and the block size is I don't know how big, but really big. So it's a chain that has very low fees and it has a very concentrated validator set.
01:34:52.336 - 01:35:56.870, Speaker B: I think it has eleven validators who are all owned by Binance and friends. And what this leads to is also PGA because there is no how you can think of. Sort of the flashboards mechanism is almost like a side channel that exists next to the public mempool where you can express your preferences about where you want to get mined. And this happens in an environment where this performed with very few negative external analyses. But BSc still doesn't have such a system. So what instead happens is pretty much the same that we saw on Ethereum however, with even sort of less bidding, it's just more spam. So I think Robert He made a good tweet the other day about a block in Ethereum, about a block in BSc that had, I think on average a block on BSc has between like one point five K and two K transactions in it.
01:35:56.870 - 01:37:28.460, Speaker B: And that particular block had around 1000 transactions that were all competing for the same Arbitrage opportunity and only one of them was able to fill it. And all of the other 1000 transactions failed and actually wasted more than half of that entire block. Right? That's a clear negative externality because these searchers, they are going to fight for this Arbitrage opportunity because it exists, but they basically pay, they compete in an auction and they pay sort of with failed transactions. But this is a cost that has to be borne by users basically that they are not compensated for. And the outcome here for market structure is kind of the same that I alluded to earlier with Ethereum, which is that if you don't have a market where searchers can, if you don't have this permissionless side channel that every validator can adopt, where they communicate with searchers, then the outcome is that you might see vertical integration. So meaning that the validators start extracting the MEB themselves. This is not really a big deal at all in BSc because BSc, it doesn't have the same agenda in terms of decentralization.
01:37:28.460 - 01:38:17.724, Speaker B: Right? So they don't claim to be as decentralized as Ethereum. They know of course that they have concentrated validator set and this is not a big problem. And so this can actually be fine in this case. However, the way it's a block space, I would say that is still an issue, especially when the network can get really overloaded at some points. We briefly touched on arbitram. Arbitrum as a single sequencer, they use first come, first serve. What happens here if a bunch of searchers see the same, for example, Arbitrage opportunity? So someone traded on a dex and then the state of the dex on Arbitrum is different from the state of the exchange on Binance.
01:38:17.724 - 01:39:23.860, Speaker B: And so they want to perform an Arbitrage opportunity. So in this case we still know that they will do everything that they can in order to satisfy this opportunity. However, we know definitely that they will just try to spam as hard as possible. But mostly, I would say it's a game of latency. So they want the optimal network location and the closest proximity to wherever that arbitrary sequencer is. And if sort of trading on traditional exchanges and high frequency trading is any guide, then I think the end game for all of these things, where you have a single sequencer and they sort basically by latency, then the final outcome is always a massive incentive towards colocation. So that means basically you being in the same room with the sequencer and the sequencer can sell these colocation spots.
01:39:23.860 - 01:40:36.844, Speaker B: So on the one hand, this again leads to wasted block space, but on the other hand, very high barriers to entry both in the market for sequencing. So if Arbitrum ever wants to decentralize the sequencer, then sequencers might have an incentive to offer such colocation services and this might not be available to everyone but also to searchers. Right? So if you don't have access to very high latency or to colocation, then this basically is very bad for the searcher market and finally the randomized batch auction. So here the case is actually quite clear. So you have 100 transactions in a block and you know you're going to get randomized. Then you have two ways. Either you fill up as much of the block as you can with that transaction that you must get mined or you coordinate with the miner to just ignore transactions that would in any way be competitive with you.
01:40:36.882 - 01:40:37.132, Speaker C: Right?
01:40:37.186 - 01:41:40.800, Speaker B: So the dominant mev strategy here is just censorship. So excluding some transactions that might pay a sufficient fee but would reduce the probability that your mev transaction would succeed. Yeah, and this once again, especially the spamming, it leads to waste of block space and the censorship. There is an incentive here again for vertical integration because it's actually very hard for searchers to extract mev here in this scheme without spamming. So I think this leads to concentration in the block producer, block builder set as well. And well, the takeaways kind of show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome. If you build a certain market structure, then this market structure better adheres to the realities of the market, which is that there is mev on the table of a certain value.
01:41:40.800 - 01:43:08.172, Speaker B: And so searchers and miners both will do whatever they can in order to extract this mev. And if your market structure doesn't consider that, and in many cases it doesn't, that was the point of the second or third slide. Because in the past, our market structures, our blockchain market mechanisms, only really cared about inclusion. And like dealing with inclusion well, but not dealing with the exact position in the block very well, then you get extraction strategies and me market structures that create a lot of unforeseen negative externalities. And yeah, here's sort of a great example of that because right now we have this climate crisis but at the same time a lot of airplanes are sort of basically forced to do these unnecessary flights because otherwise they would lose their landing spots in airports. And this is one of the most extreme examples of just bad market design driving extreme negative externalities. So takeaways, I summarized it here for you, the dominant mev strategy and these market mechanisms takeaway, yeah, we touched on this.
01:43:08.172 - 01:44:00.856, Speaker B: Mev is inevitable. So the market list, as a market list, then I should think very hard about the long term consequences of your design choices and build mechanisms that adhere to the realities of the market, not in utopia where mev doesn't exist and app designers don't rely on marketplace designers alone. Because we have seen actually in the last year some big innovations on the application layer. To give just two examples. Maker Dows Liquidations 2.0, instead of having a fixed amount, like a fixed reward for liquidators, you have a reverse Dutch auction. So the amount that you get for liquidating, it starts from zero and then it goes up every block.
01:44:00.856 - 01:45:00.290, Speaker B: So you get liquidated at the best possible price and the lowest possible mev. And second, unisop V three, because it allows market makers to concentrate their liquidity around a certain price point, it has greatly reduced the price impacts of many trades that users have and thereby greatly sort of reducing the amount of sandwich attacks that happen. So this is really positive. Both, I think mostly the responsibility to protect their users from mev still lies at the application layer. We hear a lot about chains that protect the users from mev, but in reality is that mev will find a way just with very negative externalities on the users. Thank you.
01:45:03.940 - 01:45:07.430, Speaker A: All right, awesome. Thank you, Hassan. That was great.
01:45:08.680 - 01:45:09.140, Speaker D: Cool.
01:45:09.210 - 01:46:07.850, Speaker A: Well, we have 13 minutes left and we can address some questions. Let me put my camera properly. So we have some questions in the chat, actually that Shiny was kind enough to post and I posted some as well, so we can address some of those and then I have questions myself to the people here. So maybe actually a question for you, Supragia, if you're still here. Is the number that you're giving you gave earlier the 40% to 57% spam statistic, does it still hold post gas increase in October? So in October, if I understand correctly, polygon increased the minimum gas price from one to 30 GWe as like a hard coded value in validator nodes, partly to reduce spam activity on the network. So does that 40% to 50% figure still hold then?
01:46:09.660 - 01:47:06.600, Speaker E: So the newest numbers that we actually have seen relating to this without the bounce was somewhere around 35 to 37. So technically, yeah, this has been reduced by this 30 Koi limit, but not by much. We still see in the new blocks that come out, a lot of spam transactions the way it had been earlier. A similar kind of thing is seen right now. In fact, a lot of these spam transactions, which generally are not successful enough, you'll see them posting their transactions at just bare minimum above it like 30.1 way and they still post it because it's still economically viable for them to do so. And successful Arbitrages or whatever mev extraction techniques they employ is able to cover that.
01:47:06.600 - 01:47:15.790, Speaker E: So it has put in some kind of speed breaker for searchers, but not by a lot.
01:47:17.040 - 01:47:38.260, Speaker A: I see also, if there is more spam, right, it doesn't feel sustainable to just increase that gas limit even more. Right? Because then it affects all of our users as well, I presume, because then now a user has to pay like 30 x more if they are sending the minimum fee for a transaction on polygon.
01:47:39.480 - 01:48:18.160, Speaker E: Yeah, I believe so, because when we had looked at this, if you look at the ratios of how many unsuccessful transactions you can afford for each successful Arbitrage that you generally do, that number is quite huge. Even today. It goes into hundreds or even thousands. And so that means you have to at least increase the minimum gas price by 100. And that's practically not feasible for network as a whole. So that way of increasing the base gas price does have its limitations.
01:48:18.660 - 01:48:40.890, Speaker A: I see. Cool. All right, thank you. I'm picking another question from YouTube, actually. This one is for you, hasu it's from Harith from Etherscan asking on Arbitrum. Would it be possible that the team requires a certain minimum geographical difference between sequencers? Actually, if anyone here in the chat want to jump in as well, you're more than welcome in that question.
01:48:44.300 - 01:49:32.570, Speaker B: I'm not sure if that works. I think some plan that would be more likely is that they would move from a single node implementation of the first come first serve to a multi node implementation. So you would have basically a multiparty protocol between different sequencers to agree on a fair ordering. So proximity to any one sequencer would then be less and less important. Right. So if you have ten sequencers and they are at specific geographic locations in the world and they talk to each other, they run some protocol in order to arrive at what they deem a fair ordering, all reporting what they saw first, then I think that would probably do exactly what you had in mind.
01:49:35.500 - 01:49:55.692, Speaker A: Okay, cool. Thank you. There is a question here that Shinwan posted from YouTube on why was mev from ARBs going down. There was a chart about it, I believe. Luke, that might be you not sure if that was I'm not sure if luke's? Yeah. Luke, you're still yep.
01:49:55.756 - 01:50:04.530, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm still here. Yeah. Why? I don't think we have a good answer to why. I don't think I'd be confident in answer to that yet.
01:50:05.000 - 01:50:07.764, Speaker A: There's an answer in the chat from Robert. Yeah.
01:50:07.802 - 01:50:08.148, Speaker D: So.
01:50:08.234 - 01:50:53.700, Speaker A: Hey, it's Robert. I haven't been presenting today, but what I think about this question is that we saw more emphasis on NFTs buying, selling NFT mev, and less on Dex trading at various different points during the year. So there's parts of the year where there's just less volume on DEXes, less people buying things, less fewer new assets coming up. And that leads to less mev from Arbitrage and more mev in other places. At least that's what I would answer to this question of why mev from arms went down at certain points in the year. Thank you. Sren posted another question.
01:50:53.700 - 01:51:38.142, Speaker A: How does cross domain mev change the game other than. Increasing even more the incentive for vertical integration. Collusion of sequencers. Does anyone want to take that question? All right, I shall give somewhat of an answer. You're right that in at least the early research that we've done on cross domain Mev, there are network effects to some of the effects that hassle talked about, and so to wanting to influence the ordering on multiple networks at once. So I'm not sure what you mean by change the game. Right.
01:51:38.142 - 01:52:30.080, Speaker A: Does it change the game from what mev is today and the dynamics that we see happening? I don't think it does. Does it amplify them or does it accentuate them in a way that is going to accelerate trends that we are kind of already seeing happening or that we're predicting? I do believe so. Are there risks about that that we're not currently seeing and that might show up in the future that we need to be acutely aware of? I also think so, and I think we're assessing these risks in research and we're also thinking about not only risks from centralization perspective, but also systemic economic risks as well as just security risks of the systems we're building and the systems that people are using and are kind of migrating to one from Alejo, actually. Alejo, if you want to speak, if you want to add to that.
01:52:34.870 - 01:52:35.502, Speaker C: Perhaps.
01:52:35.566 - 01:52:37.694, Speaker A: There might be more probabilistic mev.
01:52:37.742 - 01:52:39.890, Speaker C: Right. Because you have to deal with different.
01:52:39.960 - 01:52:42.550, Speaker A: Systems, with different finalities.
01:52:43.210 - 01:52:53.350, Speaker C: So many of the opportunities are no longer going to be atomic. So you have to put some more at stake for extraction.
01:52:54.510 - 01:52:55.066, Speaker A: Great.
01:52:55.168 - 01:52:56.330, Speaker C: Take more risk.
01:52:57.390 - 01:52:59.894, Speaker A: There's another question in there by MDR.
01:52:59.942 - 01:53:11.950, Speaker B: I would have another point on Crosschain if you want sorry, I would have another point on Crosschain if you want. Please change the incentives.
01:53:15.490 - 01:53:15.806, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:53:15.828 - 01:54:13.380, Speaker B: So we already discussed that there's an incentive for vertical integration, right? So I guess what you mean by that is for there to be the same sequence on both chains, but due to the probabilistic nature of execution on these chains, I think you add almost like a geometric return to size, if that makes any sense. So on Ethereum, if you have 20% hash power, then you're 20% likely to execute a transaction in the next block. Right? But if you have 20% hash power on Ethereum and 20% hash power on Polygon, then you're actually 20% times 20% likely to execute the next block. And so they are increasing returns to size that are much bigger than if you're just on a single chain. It would be my guess.
01:54:15.270 - 01:54:33.110, Speaker A: Very nice. Thank you. There's a question for Ward. Ward, again, if you're still with us. Yes, you are. A question from MDR LOLcat. Has there been any evidence on avalanche of transactions being ordered by anything else than the default Go avalanche client?
01:54:41.870 - 01:55:11.586, Speaker C: This is an interesting question because of I assume it means no man plus plus because beforehand there was only a constant gas price and I'm going to take this question I mean that it's asking if they've been sorted by not gas price descending. Yeah.
01:55:11.608 - 01:55:58.670, Speaker A: So maybe in your presentation you described how people optimize either depending on which version of the avalanche network, either how much stake of AVAX do they have to be validators or optimizing their latency some other way. Right. And it feels like that's because you're assuming some ordering that nodes will follow. So has it been the case that nodes kind of follow a different ordering than like that ordering that you assume? Right. Is that a good way of looking at it's?
01:56:01.730 - 01:56:47.770, Speaker C: I think it's not. Well, if he's asking the question is for evidence, I think that before sellman plus plus it's hard to answer that succinctly because of ordering blocks and could say there was a lot of contention. But if the question is is there evidence of transactions not being ordered by price time them I'd say not significantly. I have heard the statistic that there hasn't been an instance of sandwiching, which is very interesting given it's the prevalence of sandwiching on ethereum.
