00:00:09.480 - 00:00:41.682, Speaker A: How's everybody doing? That's great. Very, very enthusiastic. Everyone's sleepy after food today, I'm going to be talking about the inner chain future. You ready? Let's go. Oh, but first, there's a little thing I want to show some people. In case you weren't at Osmocon, hashtag mesh is real. I was going to do a demo, but the wifi here is a little bit not that great.
00:00:41.682 - 00:01:03.270, Speaker A: So we're going to show some screenshots of the demo, and if you want to see the demo in person, we can try it later. Just ping me. But, yeah, mesh security. The idea, cross stake to secure the Internet of blockchains and earn some rewards. Cool. So this is the front landing page. Imagine you click connect.
00:01:03.270 - 00:01:20.250, Speaker A: Wallet. Now you're ready to cross stake. So this is the mesh dashboard. You can see in this screenshot here we have two tokens. In the interchange. We have osmosis and Juno. And you can see your balance in your portfolio.
00:01:20.250 - 00:01:46.246, Speaker A: There's a claim rewards button. If you've actually ever used staking before, all this is going to look really super familiar. We think of mesh as this really complicated thing, but at the end of the day, it's kind of just another staking ui. So, yeah, you can claim your rewards. Click claim all rewards. Awesome. You get all that money from the mesh to stake, you would click stake or unstake.
00:01:46.246 - 00:02:22.020, Speaker A: And then why is the. Wait, wait, back, back. So then you choose, okay, how much do I want to cross stake? Right? How much do I want to stake? And then you would select which chains you want to cross stake to. Right now in this mesh, we only have one. So we're going to cross stake our OsMo to secure Juno network and get some extra juno rewards. And then it's just like staking, right? For each chain that you're cross staking to, you're just picking a validator. So on the osmosis chain, I'm picking this validator.
00:02:22.020 - 00:02:58.030, Speaker A: This is running in. Not like it's not using the official chains yet. It's running in a test environment. Kudos to Anmol from starship for making this awesome, realistic testing environment that uses actual chain binaries and Hermes and stuff. But, yeah, you pick your validator, and then you pick a validator on Juno, and then you hit that next button and you get a nice little summary page. So here we're going to cross stake 10,000 Osmo. These are the different validators on each of the different chains and their different commissions.
00:02:58.030 - 00:03:27.340, Speaker A: And then we just click crosstake and you sign a transaction and the IBC magic happens. It sends an IBC message to another chain, and now you're securing the mesh and you're earning additional rewards. It's really not rocket science. And this is just the first MVP version of the UI that we worked tirelessly on for two weeks. Right? So imagine how much better the UX can get in another month in terms of timeframes for mesh. I know that's what everyone wants to know. When mesh.
00:03:27.340 - 00:03:58.540, Speaker A: When mesh? Soon. I'm hoping a couple of months. But let's get to the real thing. I want to talk about today, which is we're at the beginning of a new paradigm. It's the interchain paradigm. And as you can see here, we've got the inner chain as it exists today. In 2023, over 60 blockchains connected, billions of dollars transacted between them.
00:03:58.540 - 00:04:23.464, Speaker A: But we're not going to stop there. No, we're not going to stop there at all. This is not good enough because IBC will connect all. This is the inner chain and maybe 2024. I hope you see Ethereum, right? Interchange is not real until Ethereum joins the party. We see op, we see Nier, we see Polkadot. Polkadot is already connected to the IBC.
00:04:23.464 - 00:04:55.086, Speaker A: The first ever transaction between Kusama and Polkadot happened with IBC. We see avalanche. Avalanche is joining the party. Awesome. But, yeah, this is the goal. And we cannot be satisfied until this goal is reached. In fact, I think this is a good time to announce that in helping to achieve this mission of connecting all these sovereign state machines with IBC, I'm actually starting a fund with Sam.
00:04:55.086 - 00:05:36.218, Speaker A: Sam was a co founder of consensus, so it's great to get some Ethereum ogs that are excited about the interchain. How cool is that? Ogs from Ethereum are now thinking, oh, this might be the next hot narrative we have. Locke. Locke is a partner at Tuesday Capital and a bunch of other funds and has a ton of experience doing all the things I have no clue how to do, like set up legal entities and accounting. And then there's me. I'm just a degenerate and to know a lot of devs and, you know. But our thesis is really pretty simple, right? And it's this.
00:05:36.218 - 00:05:56.400, Speaker A: I'm gonna give you the TLDR version. The interchain will bring mass adoption of crypto. Here's the Y, the TLDR version Y. If you're interested in being an LP in our fund, we'll give you the slide deck. And you can get the long version of this. But first of all, you all probably know this if you're here. IBC enables massive horizontal scalability.
00:05:56.400 - 00:06:48.182, Speaker A: The idea that we don't have to run everything on one world computer, we can actually just have all these networks. Computers, like the Internet, scales to billions of transactions per second and beyond. Here's a killer point, though. Enterprise and permissioned blockchains are actually a huge use case, and they only make sense if they are interoperable with others. Previously, there was a big trend in 2017, if you were around then, around enterprise blockchains, but they never worked. Because who wants a silo? What good is a blockchain if it's a silo? IBC changes this game. And if we're really going to see a massive influx of capital, if we're going to see companies that are worth multiple trillions of dollars, there are companies out there that are worth more than the entire crypto market.
00:06:48.182 - 00:07:41.872, Speaker A: Do you think that they're going to run on anything other than their own sovereign permissions chain? Do you think governments of large companies are going to run on anything other than their own sovereign chain? So the inner chain actually is very aligned with this idea of bringing in people that would normally never join crypto, because they can join it on their terms. You can have a permissioned blockchain, you can have an enterprise blockchain, and you can connect with every other one that exists. This is the Internet of state machines. Another big aspect is network effects. Network effects and composability are going to drive growth. I'm going to talk more about this later, but in IBC is everything you need to succeed. All the liquidity is there, the data is there.
00:07:41.872 - 00:08:23.784, Speaker A: You can verify the data with cryptography, and the users and the people are there, right? This is going to be compounding the effects of launching a new chain. Previously, when you launched a new l one, you had to build up a whole ecosystem from scratch. You had to build up all your users from scratch. And now in the interconnected world, anyone who has an account on some IBC connected chain, they can just go over and check it out. That's really key for the next thing. And then I think in the bear market, we get all really sad and depressed and we're like, blockchain doesn't work. But honestly, blockchain is actually more relevant than ever.
00:08:23.784 - 00:09:22.104, Speaker A: And sure, there's challenges. We definitely need really good privacy solutions, for example. But if you look at everything that's happening with AI ideas that we had in 2015, content registries like people publishing content and being able to prove that it was from a certain source with signatures, with cryptographic signatures that cannot be impersonated by AI, those things are more relevant than ever. And if you actually exist in the web, two world at a big corporation, and you use the tools that they use, everyone is like, blockchain is badux, Oracle is Baduxdev. Like, if you've just like, these PHP websites are just bad Ux, sending PDF's around in word documents, around is bad Ux. And the future is being born right now. So I'm glad you're all here, but, you know, I think we haven't fully absorbed this new era, right? It's still very nascent.
00:09:22.104 - 00:10:23.844, Speaker A: We're immensely, we're still in the old multi chain world, and the interchange requires us to start thinking a little bit differently. And so to get you to think differently and to also liven things up post lunch, it's time for interchange hot takes. Who's ready? Okay, so this is the first one. When you are talking with others outside this ecosystem, whether they're from the Ethereum foundation or Polkadot or Nierdez, you know, some l two, don't use cosmos, use inner chain. I hate to say it, but this is a fundamental branding thing, right? If we are going to make IBC connect all kind of vision, if you have bags in another chain and you hear about cosmos, oh, that's just all associated with somebody else's bags, that's all the Cosmos hub, right? I don't want to be a part of that. That's just like a meme coin or it's like another eth killer. It's a shitcoin.
00:10:23.844 - 00:11:11.324, Speaker A: From their perspectives, inner chain is a much more exciting idea. It's a much more powerful idea. And from my conversations, when I talk with people from Ethereum, for example, about the interchain, they pay attention because that is something that's really sexy and it solves their problems. When you talk about the cosmos, what are we talking about? Are we talking about Cosmos SDK? Are we talking about Cosmos Hub? Are we talking about this network of IBC connected blockchains? And so my first hot take for you is, if you're talking about that network of IBC connected blockchains, don't use the word cosmos, use the word interchange. Second, and I think this is also probably an obvious one, but there's going to be many hubs. That's just natural. That's part of network topology.
00:11:11.324 - 00:11:41.648, Speaker A: That's exactly how the Internet is. If you're under the illusion that your one chain to rule them all is going to be the hub for all things and that there's just going to be one hub in your ecosystem. What year are you living in? That dream has long died. We are in the multi chain world and we're soon in the interchain world, and it's going to look like this. There's going to be multiple hubs, there's going to be multiple winners. And yes, some are going to be bigger than others. But yeah, give up on the false idol of one chain to rule them all or one hub.
00:11:41.648 - 00:12:07.650, Speaker A: It won't happen and it shouldn't happen. That's a dystopian world in my view. All right, here's another one. I'm not going to take credit for this. Hillary from evmos did this really awesome mental reframing. We oftentimes think of TVL, right? Total or TLV? Yeah, total value locked, right? And we judge all defi protocols by this. Like, it's all about TVL.
00:12:07.650 - 00:12:56.040, Speaker A: TVL, TVL. This is this metric. It's been hammered in our heads since 2020, but in the, in the interchain era, maybe we should start thinking about things a little bit differently. And this is why it's so important to bring other ecosystems into the interchain is because maybe it's all about total reachable liquidity. Because with IBC we can build interchange protocols that are not like the ones that existed in the multi chain era, where it doesn't really matter if it's on your blockchain specifically, as long as you can access it, as long as you can reach it. When we live in the era of interchange, dao tooling and interchain accounts where you can have accounts on all these different chains that you control, that you can utilize. Maybe start thinking in terms of total reachable liquidity instead of TVL.
00:12:56.040 - 00:13:39.850, Speaker A: Start thinking inner chain. This is another one. I hate to bring it up, but I see people in cosmos all the time and they're always thinking about protectionism. They're in this protectionist mindset, whether it's like, oh, we could never accept another fee token besides our own native token that might help with Cross IBC UX. Or maybe they're like, we have to impose fees or tariffs on taking things off chain because we don't want people to leave our chain to go to others. Or maybe you're a permissionless cosmosm chain and you have a bunch of custom cosmos SDK modules that you try to get people to use. And so the idea is that like, oh, no other chain will have these modules and then that code won't be reusable.
00:13:39.850 - 00:14:11.048, Speaker A: I see that a lot recently, and I think that's very short sighted. Free markets are ultimately going to win out of over mercantilism and protectionist ideas will sound good in the short term for the value to token holders, but they're not going to win out in the long term. Just wait. We've seen this before. We've seen this one before. Apps are better than app chains. Don't think of app chains, think of apps.
00:14:11.048 - 00:14:35.484, Speaker A: Deploy everywhere, or someone else will. Every chain needs an NFT marketplace. Every chain needs a Dex. Every chain needs dao tooling. Every chain needs your product. If you want to get the most users, if you want to get the most usage, if you want to capture the most value as your protocol, you have to be everywhere in the interchain era. And IBC gives you the tools to stitch interchange protocols together that we never had before.
00:14:35.484 - 00:15:16.720, Speaker A: Right? Outposts kind of offer the best of both worlds, right? So if you have an app chain, make it the hub, but deploy everywhere, or I'm not interested in your protocol. Here's another one I really want to put this thing. You can profit from things that don't run in your block space. Again, you can profit from things that don't run in your block space. This kind of goes along with the protectionist idea where it's like, oh, everything has to run in our block space, otherwise it's not good. No. As long as value is accruing to your dao or your token, that's all that matters.
00:15:16.720 - 00:15:48.632, Speaker A: This is something that we're very behind on, Juno, which is why we're so excited about mesh security. If a project starts on Juno and I that goes elsewhere, right, or launches its own app chain, we can continue a beneficial economic relationship with them without them having to run their app on our chain. It doesn't matter. These old ideas don't matter. Block space is more plentiful than ever. It's cheaper than ever. And if you're only thinking in terms of transaction fees and block space, I think you're kind of again, living in the previous erade.
00:15:48.632 - 00:16:04.500, Speaker A: So wake up. This is a big, important one for Cosmos. Vibes matter. This community has been super hyper negative lately. There's not like, there's hardly any women in the audience. There's, you know, just. There's just bad vibes lately.
00:16:04.500 - 00:16:19.870, Speaker A: There's this idea in cosmos. It seems that there can only be one winner. Winner take all. Right? Like, and there's not enough coordination, collaboration. It's not an exciting place to join. No one wants to join. A place where there's tons of drama all the time.
00:16:19.870 - 00:16:56.522, Speaker A: Right? So start being nice to each other, even if they're a quote unquote competitor project. It's really not like that. We are judged as an ecosystem. And finally, advanced governance tooling is a requirement for mass adoption. As we move into this world of permissioned blockchains, as we move into a world of mass usage, guess what your boomer parents expect if something's wrong, they can, like, have some way of remediating things. You know, immutability is great value, but it can also be a terrible user experience if you've ever lost your keys before. And that happens.
00:16:56.522 - 00:17:19.570, Speaker A: So there's balance to be achieved here. But I'm not going to ramble on too much because I've been rambling a lot. I'm running out of time. But, you know, so speaking of daos, I got to get to Dao updates. Okay? So, first of all, with the Juno Junodao, we have this renewed focus on experimentation. People are like, oh, Neutron, neutron. What's the difference between Neutron and Juno? We have different alignments.
00:17:19.570 - 00:17:46.452, Speaker A: I think neutron is a great project, actually. Really do. But, you know, we are much more on the experimental, pushing the boundary side of things. We are first and foremost a community chain and we are first and foremost an experimental chain. And sometimes the experiments might not go super great, but that's part of evolution, it's part of learning. So we're pushing the boundaries. So just to read through our tech roadmap, mesh security is probably Juno's top priority.
00:17:46.452 - 00:18:06.976, Speaker A: We are doubling down on mesh security. It is, I think, the future. We're probably going to be one of the first chains to connect to Polkadot because we're using the latest Cosmos SDK and the latest IBC Go versions. So we're going to guinea pig that for you all and then you can use it on your chains. We have the Juno constitution in the works. It's going to come out soon. Others, some major governance reforms.
00:18:06.976 - 00:18:28.650, Speaker A: Spoiler alert. Core one is just going to be completely dissolved and there's going to be a new structure that's put in place. More on that later. I could spend a whole talk on that, but we're going to be trying out some really interesting and novel ideas. Ideas which, like subdivs, which we helped Pioneer. We hope these ideas make their way to other chains in the inner chain. Cosmos modules is something I'm really excited about.
00:18:28.650 - 00:18:50.330, Speaker A: It's something that we're going to Pioneer. This is an idea from twasm and T grade. You will be able to write SDK modules effectively with smart contracts in rust. And you don't have to do an upgrade. You don't have to upgrade the modules. Every time the SDK changes, it's much more stable. We think that it's going to really unlock a lot of new things.
00:18:50.330 - 00:19:42.820, Speaker A: All new Juno features that are like at the SDK level are going to be using Cosmos and modules because we think that it's really important to build out that ecosystem. And yes, I am a cosmos and maximalist, and we have some huge performance improvements on the way real quick. Leet society, it's live. If you don't know what LEED society is, it is a club for interchange devs. We are not an investment fund or whatever, it's just a society. But maybe it's beneficial to be part of this society because we have some funds around it that are looking to recruit talent and maybe looking to invest in projects that might come out of it. But if you're looking, if you're a new dev to this space or an experienced one, and you're looking for mentorship, the ability to meet other people, to like learn peer to peer style, maybe get some cool bounties like come talk to me or go to 1337 society dot de V and you can join lead society.
00:19:42.820 - 00:20:10.328, Speaker A: And lastly, data update. We're deploying dao dao across the inner chain. So if you want dao dao on your chain, come talk to me. We're living up to our values of these. Like, we think the most valuable protocols are the inner chain protocols. If you keep Dao Dao on one chain, it won't be able to create as much value as if Dao Dao and Daos are everywhere. Secondly, Dao Dao now supports interchange accounts.
00:20:10.328 - 00:20:37.540, Speaker A: So in this little screenshot, you can now have a Dao on Juno that has an account on osmosis, and you can use all the Dao Dao tooling to do anything on osmosis. And so I urge you to check it out. I might demo it in the corner in a bit if you're interested. But this is much more than just liquid staking on stride. This is a real interchange account experience. You can call smart contracts, you can instantiate smart contracts on other chains. You can do anything that you could do on that chain.
00:20:37.540 - 00:21:10.060, Speaker A: So come talk to me afterwards and I'll showcase it for you. Finally, we're seeking some grants for public goods work. And if you're an investor, here's a little bit of alpha. We might have a secret plan, and we are going to be finally raising investment for Dowdao. Daodao has raised zero money to date, though it was supported by the wonderful Juno community, which has incubated things like Polytone. We're helping with mesh security with many people like confio osmosis. You know, dowdow.
00:21:10.060 - 00:21:30.750, Speaker A: We do good things. We're builders and we're pushing the boundaries. And so finally, I kind of already talked about this, but just to close, our fates are tied together. We succeed as an ecosystem together. We succeed as an interchange together. Start getting out of the zero sum mindset. Thank you.
