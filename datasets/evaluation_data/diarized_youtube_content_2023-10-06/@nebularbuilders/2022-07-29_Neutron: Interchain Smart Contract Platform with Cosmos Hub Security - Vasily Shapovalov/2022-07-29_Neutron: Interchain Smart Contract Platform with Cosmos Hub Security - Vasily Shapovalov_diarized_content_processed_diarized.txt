00:00:10.560 - 00:00:16.630, Speaker A: I'm Vasily Shapavalov, CTO of p two P and I'm going to talk about.
00:00:16.750 - 00:00:21.170, Speaker B: Neutron, the chain to be secured by.
00:00:22.030 - 00:00:33.392, Speaker A: Kasmus hub using interchange security that is going to be permissionless smart contract platform that leverage Cosmos and IBC primitives to.
00:00:33.416 - 00:00:39.580, Speaker B: Be the chain to deploy the interchain application, the glue for the interchange.
00:00:43.120 - 00:01:25.324, Speaker A: The story of neutron is we try to find a blockchain like this that would be very secure in economical sense and would have the no hassle free deployment for Cosmos. Smart contracts for a project that can be under Kosmosh hub umbrella would be maximally aligned with Cosmos hub. But chain like this doesn't exist. So yeah, 1 second chain Linux doesn't exist. So that's what we had to start.
00:01:25.372 - 00:01:29.480, Speaker B: Making to make one. Okay.
00:01:30.180 - 00:01:31.440, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay.
00:01:35.220 - 00:01:36.920, Speaker B: So we are in p two p.
00:01:38.860 - 00:01:57.870, Speaker A: We started with validating with Genesis. We participated in game of stakes and were one of the winners. The game of zones also winners there. And there is nothing more exciting for me in Cosmos ecosystem that making atom useful.
00:01:58.930 - 00:02:14.440, Speaker B: So I think it's a great development. So yeah, we wanted a chain that would be aligned with Cosmos Hub but would allow us to make interchange enabled protocols.
00:02:15.420 - 00:02:19.932, Speaker A: And we asked the community using the.
00:02:20.036 - 00:02:22.548, Speaker B: Proposal 72 that was controversial for a.
00:02:22.564 - 00:02:29.420, Speaker A: Bit but then passed with great success and a lot of engagement, which I.
00:02:29.460 - 00:02:35.480, Speaker B: Can thank all of you for. So that was very energizing.
00:02:35.900 - 00:03:03.142, Speaker A: And we're making the permissionless smart contract platform that will have state of the art interchange capabilities and the security of Cosmos Hub, which is very exciting for me. The basic idea is that the chain itself, the interchange Dom of neutron, will what it will do, it will allow the smart contracts applications to deploy, but.
00:03:03.166 - 00:03:05.318, Speaker B: It won't host any, like any enshrined.
00:03:05.374 - 00:03:19.170, Speaker A: Applications, it will have a permissionless smart contract platform and it will have state like the bleeding edge IBC standards.
00:03:19.750 - 00:03:22.390, Speaker B: For now, that's like interchange accounts, interchange.
00:03:22.430 - 00:03:25.030, Speaker A: Queries that are connected to Cosmos.
00:03:25.190 - 00:03:27.734, Speaker B: So you can actually iterate on them.
00:03:27.782 - 00:03:55.920, Speaker A: Using the smart contract platform. And it's all secured by Cosmos Hub. So why people would want to use this, why it's important, why not deploy your own zone like many other Dyson Cosmos ecosystem? That's basically the premise of cosmos ecosystem, to like roll up your own blockchain.
00:03:56.040 - 00:03:57.860, Speaker B: That's what people do here.
00:03:58.800 - 00:04:01.536, Speaker A: So the gist of it is Casmos.
00:04:01.568 - 00:04:03.160, Speaker B: SDK zones are more powerful.
00:04:03.240 - 00:04:07.080, Speaker A: You can do a lot of more stuff with it. Like you can hack on p two.
00:04:07.120 - 00:04:09.740, Speaker B: P layer, like anoma here is doing.
00:04:10.480 - 00:04:15.060, Speaker A: You can hack on validated uses.
00:04:15.480 - 00:04:17.792, Speaker B: Like Terra was doing this with oracles.
00:04:17.856 - 00:04:32.614, Speaker A: That were working validators, Kava was also doing this with validators. And you can add additional responsibilities to them, like third chain, that makes validators.
00:04:32.702 - 00:04:33.330, Speaker B: Also.
00:04:36.190 - 00:04:40.610, Speaker A: Decentralized, custody, that handle the money, basically.
00:04:42.790 - 00:04:48.656, Speaker B: And you've got your islet environment that protects for clogging by other applications, you've.
00:04:48.688 - 00:05:11.848, Speaker A: Got like full sovereignty, but like what you lose, actually, smart contracts development is like ten times faster. It's easier to pump out code, test code, share code, you have better tooling, you have better development experience, like you have cheaper maintenance, because you don't have.
00:05:11.864 - 00:05:16.024, Speaker B: To maintain a blockchain, you have only to maintain a smart contract, which is.
00:05:16.072 - 00:05:32.216, Speaker A: Like, in some cases it's zero maintenance when the smart contracts are immutable. And for many smart carcass platform, the default model is synchronous environment, where all contracts can work with each other.
00:05:32.288 - 00:05:34.224, Speaker B: And that is great for compassibility.
00:05:34.312 - 00:05:51.492, Speaker A: You have seen this on dream to play out as a great driver for success of declare finance compatible protocols, etcetera. And Kasmus has place for all of it.
00:05:51.676 - 00:05:54.196, Speaker B: So you need high customization, you need.
00:05:54.228 - 00:05:58.508, Speaker A: High sovereignty, and you have basically resources.
00:05:58.564 - 00:06:05.140, Speaker B: To make it happen. You roll out your own chain, you are not sure that you have resources for it.
00:06:05.180 - 00:06:18.938, Speaker A: You want to test things out, you want more compatibility, you want less expenses, you roll out on the smart contracts platform, because it's cheaper to start. And then if you want to do.
00:06:18.954 - 00:06:27.830, Speaker B: It, you can roll out your own chain later, or you can stay here. And.
00:06:31.450 - 00:06:33.562, Speaker A: What we are doing here is.
00:06:33.706 - 00:06:42.252, Speaker B: Making this smart contract platform very much interchain capable. We're connecting the interchange accounts with the smart contracts.
00:06:42.276 - 00:06:48.300, Speaker A: So like interchange accounts are basically like.
00:06:48.420 - 00:06:53.188, Speaker B: Telekinesis for the blockchains. You've got a zone and you've got a different zone.
00:06:53.244 - 00:06:55.276, Speaker A: And one like the zone one can.
00:06:55.308 - 00:06:57.996, Speaker B: Trigger the actions on zone two, like.
00:06:58.028 - 00:07:08.840, Speaker A: Whatever transaction it wants, basically. And it's represented by a ghost on the other chain, like the ghost hand, which is sort of like a virtual account.
00:07:09.300 - 00:07:14.268, Speaker B: And we allow smart contracts to have as many virtual accounts and other chains.
00:07:14.364 - 00:07:32.310, Speaker A: They want, that allow them to act in the interchange according to the programmed rules on the blockchain of neutron. That can be made much more safer than custodial approach.
00:07:36.410 - 00:07:39.146, Speaker B: And we're working on interchange queries, which.
00:07:39.178 - 00:07:49.990, Speaker A: Are like a bit more harder technically. The gist of it, when you have ABC connection to other blockchain, you can.
00:07:50.530 - 00:08:09.506, Speaker B: Read parts of its state and prove they are correct. And that allows you to query state of the blockchain. You can query, for example the like the current balance of the account. You can query the delegations of account. You can query if the transaction you did with interchange accounts was a success.
00:08:09.618 - 00:08:28.660, Speaker A: Or it did fail for some reason. So you can communicate with other blockchains and you can understand what's happening on them. And these two options allow folks to have protocols that.
00:08:30.640 - 00:08:38.660, Speaker B: Basically do interchange stuff with many blockchains algorithmically and very transparently.
00:08:42.560 - 00:08:49.128, Speaker A: So it's not the simplest thing technically. Like you need to basically transfer a.
00:08:49.144 - 00:08:53.376, Speaker B: Lot of data from one blockchain into the other unit layers and reconstruct this.
00:08:53.408 - 00:08:56.496, Speaker A: Data in a readable form by re.
00:08:56.528 - 00:08:59.944, Speaker B: Implementing the logic of one blockchain another.
00:09:00.112 - 00:09:15.080, Speaker A: But it's possible and it's very handy. So imagine for example the protocol that for some reason needs price hit and.
00:09:15.200 - 00:09:31.358, Speaker B: A zone that provides robust price hits like band or something. Without interchange queries, a request is sent from one zone to another. It is replied on the other zone.
00:09:31.414 - 00:09:33.490, Speaker A: And sent back using IBC.
00:09:35.390 - 00:09:39.318, Speaker B: And in between, the threshold for a.
00:09:39.334 - 00:09:41.262, Speaker A: Query should be reached, which also takes.
00:09:41.286 - 00:09:50.080, Speaker B: Some time and its high latency. In the best case it takes half a minute or so. And.
00:09:52.060 - 00:09:53.988, Speaker A: With interchange queries, when you need.
00:09:54.004 - 00:09:55.956, Speaker B: To query price, for example on band.
00:09:55.988 - 00:10:05.716, Speaker A: Again or on osmosis or whatever you want to solve the price for the smart contracts basically puts up a request.
00:10:05.828 - 00:10:08.452, Speaker B: Relaya immediately picks it up and relays.
00:10:08.516 - 00:10:28.990, Speaker A: The data from the other blockchain. You want round trip less basically and it's validated by the smart contract that reads the query. It's like half of mass latency and more universal. Basically, you don't need a specialized oracle.
00:10:29.030 - 00:10:41.050, Speaker B: Blockchain to read prices. And it's all running on the Cosmos hub umbrella. So basically it's secured by Cosmos Hub.
00:10:41.380 - 00:10:57.040, Speaker A: It's got a virtuous cycle. So like interchange security makes Cosmos hub, makes neutron more economically secure than basically most other places in Cosmos, most HUD zones and.
00:10:58.860 - 00:11:02.148, Speaker B: Neutron shares a fee income with Cosmos Hub.
00:11:02.324 - 00:11:04.668, Speaker A: So adoption neutron drives revenue to the.
00:11:04.684 - 00:11:08.840, Speaker B: Hub, makes it more valuable and makes that makes neutron more secure.
00:11:09.450 - 00:11:11.150, Speaker A: That's a virtuous cycle.
00:11:12.690 - 00:11:20.914, Speaker B: So what's next for us? We want to run neutron. We want people to deploy neutron to.
00:11:21.002 - 00:11:30.618, Speaker A: Make decentralized exchanges, yield strategists like cross chain yield strategies aggregators for trading on.
00:11:30.674 - 00:11:33.658, Speaker B: Cross chain the liquid staking protocols, any.
00:11:33.794 - 00:11:37.030, Speaker A: NFT marketplace, any fantastic products you can build there.
00:11:37.340 - 00:11:41.440, Speaker B: Dao toolkits like interchange daos will be a thing, right?
00:11:42.660 - 00:12:07.910, Speaker A: So we want folks to build it. So like we were asked a lot if there will be a token. And the answer is, yeah, we don't have a final version of what, what the exact design here will be. But that's what I think right now.
00:12:07.990 - 00:12:10.862, Speaker B: I think we're going to be to.
00:12:10.886 - 00:12:15.286, Speaker A: Run with v model where the token.
00:12:15.318 - 00:12:18.310, Speaker B: For the neutron that is provisionally named.
00:12:18.350 - 00:12:29.370, Speaker A: Rhino will be having some garner's power over economics of neutron. It will be.
00:12:32.340 - 00:12:37.828, Speaker B: Used for funneling emissions.
00:12:37.884 - 00:12:41.604, Speaker A: Of rhino to the project to the good.
00:12:41.652 - 00:12:44.092, Speaker B: That can be anything from liquidity incentives.
00:12:44.156 - 00:12:57.858, Speaker A: To common goods receivers to funding of the development to basically whatever governance thinks is guest is good. It also have some, some revenue from.
00:12:57.914 - 00:13:04.346, Speaker B: Fees and some voting power in the minimized galaxy neutron that can be changed.
00:13:04.458 - 00:13:11.642, Speaker A: So that's not set in stone. And the transaction fees I think should.
00:13:11.666 - 00:13:15.002, Speaker B: Be split between burning the buying and.
00:13:15.026 - 00:13:19.386, Speaker A: Burning the reno token, getting some rewards.
00:13:19.498 - 00:13:20.150, Speaker B: From.
00:13:23.180 - 00:13:44.428, Speaker A: From fees to variana stakers and some of that should be transformed to stables in the treasury. One thing we want to discuss the community. The initial proposal had all fees on neutron be paid in atom. Maybe there is a better way, like.
00:13:44.524 - 00:13:46.596, Speaker B: The fees paid and whatever, and swap.
00:13:46.628 - 00:13:52.670, Speaker A: To atom, but we'll find out.
00:13:54.770 - 00:13:56.946, Speaker B: So if you interested, if you want.
00:13:56.978 - 00:13:59.418, Speaker A: To build on neutron, if you're interested.
00:13:59.434 - 00:14:03.026, Speaker B: In neutron, if you want to be on the team or learn more or.
00:14:03.058 - 00:14:10.470, Speaker A: Support us, please reach out. We've got the contacts laid out for you and I think that's it.
00:14:20.740 - 00:14:31.200, Speaker C: Thank you so much, Vasily. I think the other two panelists are not here already, so I think we have time for one question. If there's one question in the room.
00:14:40.340 - 00:14:47.380, Speaker D: Hi, how do you plan on competing with other smart contract platforms such as Juno Terra Secret?
00:14:49.480 - 00:14:51.744, Speaker A: So I think that two parts that.
00:14:51.792 - 00:14:54.688, Speaker B: Makes neutron stand out a bit here.
00:14:54.784 - 00:15:10.008, Speaker A: Is Cosmos hub security, which is really important and for many very sensitive security applications. If we have the same security as Cosmos hub in economical sense, it's basically.
00:15:10.104 - 00:15:14.154, Speaker B: Ten times more than than Juna at the time.
00:15:14.202 - 00:15:18.482, Speaker A: So that matters to some people.
00:15:18.666 - 00:15:22.890, Speaker B: And the commitment to bleeding edge interchange.
00:15:22.930 - 00:15:33.490, Speaker A: Capabilities for smart contracts. The self contained blockchains will have hard time, smart contract platform will have hard.
00:15:33.530 - 00:15:38.386, Speaker B: Time to find a niche in the market. But very interchain enabled is a new.
00:15:38.418 - 00:15:55.842, Speaker A: Thing and it will have new protocols on it that haven't been, that can't be built basically on the lagging smart contract platforms here. So, yeah, that's it.
00:15:56.026 - 00:15:56.950, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:15:58.690 - 00:16:08.400, Speaker C: Any more questions? Because we are still waiting for the other two panelists. Okay, thank you, Vasili.
00:16:11.540 - 00:16:12.260, Speaker A: Thank you for coming.
