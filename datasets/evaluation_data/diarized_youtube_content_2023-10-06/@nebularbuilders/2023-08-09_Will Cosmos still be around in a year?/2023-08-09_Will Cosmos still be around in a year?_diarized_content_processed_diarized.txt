00:00:08.920 - 00:00:20.254, Speaker A: Welcome, everyone. There's some familiar faces here. Congratulations, you made it. It's the final panel of the final day of ten days of conferences in Paris. So good to see you all still here.
00:00:20.342 - 00:00:24.450, Speaker B: Look at all these people. What are you still doing here?
00:00:25.030 - 00:00:26.050, Speaker C: Go home.
00:00:28.270 - 00:00:53.250, Speaker A: So, today's panel will be on the next twelve months for the cosmos and just how important growth will be, sort of for the ecosystem to compete with some other pretty compelling ecosystems and narratives coming up in the web3 space. So, yeah, we have four panelists with us today. We'll start with Seb. I'm sure all of you know him, he's a co organiser of the conference, but maybe just a few lines. Seb, on yourself.
00:00:54.180 - 00:00:58.520, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm Seb, founder of Interop Ventures and organizer of this fine event.
00:00:58.820 - 00:01:00.320, Speaker A: And we have Bucky as well.
00:01:00.620 - 00:01:05.900, Speaker D: Hi, all. Bucky, co founder, Cosmos, running informal systems Zucky.
00:01:06.060 - 00:01:10.572, Speaker C: Zucky, co founder of Sommelier, Spade Spade.
00:01:10.676 - 00:01:43.442, Speaker A: Chief Larp officer at Neutron and then, yeah, myself. I'm at chorus one. I'm the chief investment officer there. So, yeah, this planner was actually inspired by a tweet of that Zucky published pretty recently. I'm just going to repeat the tweet for anyone that's not familiar with it. So, yeah, from Zucky, I think Cosmos social capital has about twelve months to do something unique and differentiated. Otherwise we get swallowed by ETh flavored variants of cosmos originated ideas like roll apps and eigen lair.
00:01:43.442 - 00:01:57.116, Speaker A: So that's the tweet we have twelve months, apparently. So I'm going to start it off with to what extent is this actually a threat to the cosmos? And we'll start with potentially Yuzaki considering a short tweet.
00:01:57.308 - 00:03:02.762, Speaker C: So I guess I'll present the evidence that Cosmos is under threat. I'd say probably the most compelling evidence is that every exchange chain in the past has always been built on the cosmos. On Tendermint and Cosmos SDK, exchange chains are like the most successful blockchains, but the two new exchange chains are. One is built with the op stack base and the other one is sort of a Frankenstein of multiple l two stacks that mantle built. And I think that's like a great example of, like, large high distribution apps being built, or like, large, high distribution blockchains that previously were always using some element of Cosmos tech, now using Eth L two tech. Obviously, these things are either just becoming live or about to become live, and so we'll see how they go. But it does represent, I think, a big erosion of Cosmos place in the market space.
00:03:02.762 - 00:03:24.170, Speaker C: And then there's just this enormous access to users and liquidity that Ethel twos have demonstrated, where there's millions of monthly active wallets versus Cosmos being sort of sitting at around 100,000 monthly active wallets and way lower app use numbers than app use in the EVM ecosystem.
00:03:24.950 - 00:03:28.610, Speaker A: Spade, I see you're nodding your head a fair bit there. Do you have anything to add to that?
00:03:29.110 - 00:04:07.240, Speaker E: Yeah, I think a lot of us in this conference and a lot of the speakers have touched upon these issues beyond sort of, like, the fact that the stack is under threat in terms of, like, being used for these, like, meaningful projects. I think also, just being able to bootstrap an economy in cosmos that has intrinsic appeal to the outside world is something that we're still working on and that has not, like, been encroached yet. Right. Like, and I think that that that's sort of like the. The threat to everyone who's building cosmos right now. So. Completely agree.
00:04:07.660 - 00:04:32.600, Speaker A: So I want to just zoom in on one part of this tweet coming from Zaki. So roll ups and eigen layer originated in the cosmos, or these types of ideas. So I wanted to put this question to you, Bucky. So these ideas like roll ups and Eigen layer that are being executed in Ethereum, are they out there in cosmos already? And if so, how do they exist right now in the cosmos?
00:04:32.700 - 00:04:46.340, Speaker D: Yeah. So the question here is, are the next twelve months make or break for cosmos? I think tweeting things like this is make or break for Zucky's Twitter account. The guy has twelve months before Twitter goes under, so he's got to make the best use of it as he can.
00:04:46.720 - 00:04:48.824, Speaker C: I don't think we have twelve months until Twitter goes under, Colton.
00:04:48.832 - 00:05:12.218, Speaker D: Yeah, we may have less, so. No, I mean, all of Ethereum's good ideas come from Cosmos. I think that much is clear. No, I have a lot of respect for Ethereum, obviously, but the thing about cosmos is we're sort of values first. Right. And we harbor a certain set of values, and that has attracted certain energy, a certain kind of people. And for me, it's really about the values in the long term.
00:05:12.218 - 00:05:46.242, Speaker D: And, you know, other people adopting technology that those values created doesn't compromise those values. And I think so long as we continue to stick to those values and to build according to them that there's a future. So I think it's great that Ethereum has realized that, like, what Cosmos has been saying forever is the way to scale Ethereum. That's great. It was always our intention that Ethereum would use Cosmos ideas to scale. And it's like, you know, awesome to see our little brother achieving that. But, you know, at the same time, like, obviously, there is, you know, in some sense, there's a very competitive landscape.
00:05:46.242 - 00:06:12.154, Speaker D: You could call that threatening. Sure. It's something to pay attention to. It's definitely, you know, we definitely can't be sitting on our laurels. I have often felt that the, like, organizational drama we've experienced in cosmos is just like the universe's way of giving one else a chance to catch up because we were so far ahead that we just needed to be slowed down so that we could compete on fair terms. And so that's where we're at now. So I think we do need.
00:06:12.154 - 00:06:40.888, Speaker D: We are seeing, I mean, it's true, as Zackie said, that we're seeing exchanges now use Ethel two s because finally they're available. But at the same time, you have to understand that there's, the EVM is extremely sticky at this point, and so much tooling and stuff has been built for it. So part of those decisions are also driven by, you know, that kind of integration. And at the same time, we're seeing one of the largest applications on Ethereum move into cosmos. Right. And so that's, that's important to look at and watch very closely. And, you know, I think everyone here is very excited about Dydx and what they're, what they're going to be building.
00:06:40.888 - 00:06:53.160, Speaker D: And that's, you know, it was the values of cosmos that shown through, that said, you know, the values reflected in the technology of, like, we can build the best product and the best ux for our users. And so, you know, we'll see. We'll see more of that, I think.
00:06:53.200 - 00:07:59.300, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the other thing that wasn't in the tweet buzz that, like, from my point of view, we have all of the building blocks of survival, right, of not even survival of success. Like, all of the necessary components of sort of becoming something that is distinct and separate and distinguishable from Ethereum are already in motion. Like, all of the necessary things. Whether it's having a more compelling tooling for EVM builders, from Polaris to demonstrating what you can do on an app chain that you can't do and you won't be able to do for years on an l two, which is what Doidx is demonstrating to actually doing a better job of liquid staking and why continuing to evolve the proof of stake economy with the liquid staking module like we're doing. We've got all the right things in motion to really distinguish ourselves. But, like, this is a critical moment of execution.
00:08:00.080 - 00:08:19.424, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, like the question. There's another question in the question, which is, what is Cosmos? Right. And I think, to your point, like, cosmos is values. It's a technical. It's a vision. It's like a technical vision of how to scale blockchains. And it's also a stack.
00:08:19.424 - 00:08:58.129, Speaker B: And at interop, we sort of look at projects that fall within the values, the tech architecture and the stack, and we look at those as interchange projects. And we've had this kind of branding thing, and this kind of goes back to the branding things like, what is Cosmos? What's a cosmos project? What's nothing. I think that this is going to become less and less relevant as the values, the architecture and the stack start permeating outside of what was typically the cosmos, the projects of the cosmos, the tenderman, diaspora or whatever. And these ideas that you guys seeded, the mafia.
00:08:58.169 - 00:08:59.109, Speaker D: We're a mafia.
00:08:59.529 - 00:09:31.240, Speaker B: Those ideas that you guys seeded have been extremely influential outside of the ecosystem. And so the way that I like to. It was sort of like inspired by something Sunny told me, is that I think of Cosmos sort of like Linux. Linux is in literally every device in this room, including these tvs, probably these cameras, people's Apple watches, et cetera. None of these devices characterize themselves or brand themselves as Linux products. They're using Unix. They're using the Linux sort of like kernel and core technology.
00:09:31.240 - 00:09:51.952, Speaker B: Some projects brand themselves as Linux, and that's fine. But, you know, Dydx is a perfect example of a project that aligns with the vision, aligns with the values, aligns with the technology, but doesn't necessarily align with the branding. And that's perfectly fine. And cosmos will continue to live on, even though. Even if the Cosmos hub ceases to exist, these things will continue to be a thing.
00:09:51.976 - 00:09:52.160, Speaker C: Right.
00:09:52.200 - 00:09:53.392, Speaker D: The Cosmos hub will not cease to.
00:09:53.416 - 00:10:06.020, Speaker B: Exist, but it won't. But I think, like, really, the core of it is not necessarily an ecosystem or like this chain or that state or whatever. It's the vision in the stack.
00:10:06.880 - 00:10:40.450, Speaker A: So a lot of this vision in the cosmos is sort of about the app chain thesis. And so, you know, you have DYDX, which existed in Ethereum, then on a L2, and then eventually became an app chain. So do you think sometimes in cosmos, it sort of suffers from cart before the horse? So potentially app chains are built before there's sufficient demand for the apps themselves, and they should actually start on the execution layers or something. Like that first before moving to their own app chain, or do you think that doesn't matter? And you can always start as a layer one app chain and see if demand pens up after the network's already been built?
00:10:40.790 - 00:11:10.820, Speaker D: Yeah, I think in some sense, the whole industry suffers from that a little bit. I mean, we could talk about building, like, web two products first, and then, you know, so you could say Cosmos also suffers from it insofar as the whole industry does, and maybe a little more. But I think it is a very nice funnel to witness the sort of easy deploy on these smart contract platforms, and then maybe they move to an l two before moving into a sovereign zone. But that's also not to say that you can't build something from scratch as an app chain. We saw Osmosis build an app chain from scratch, and it worked very well.
00:11:13.160 - 00:12:01.104, Speaker C: I think that osmosis is an interesting case study. Osmosis v one, two months from deciding to build it, to shipping, which is like argue, which is like, comparable timeline to any smart contract in Ethereum, arguably faster. But on the other hand, osmosis catching up to the DeFi innovation on Ethereum that happened in 2021 and 2022, basically took two years. And the experience at sommelier has been our smart contracts. Our chain came out before our smart contracts. Our smart contracts were like an entire year of R and D. But now we're able to iterate a lot faster on our smart contracts than we are able to iterate faster on our chain.
00:12:01.104 - 00:13:08.810, Speaker C: It's a very similar experience where you can grind out v one of a sort of minimal app chain pretty quickly. And as you're searching for product market fit, I experienced this constraint. I'm like, okay, like some stuff I can do a lot faster in terms of, like, we could ship a new WBTC product on top of our smart contract layers a lot faster than I can change the way the som token works in the Som L1, or like, add Axelr support to our l one architecture, or all of these other things have taken far longer than, like, I would hope. And like, I think it is a realistic representation of, like, the difference between these environments. And I think it's if, you know, if one app, if Dydx is like, going to be the shining example of an app chain, it's very important to recognize that it is DyDxv four. And they were able to spend an entire year building this incredibly advanced application. But, like, they were able to invest that because they had product market fit on their v three application, which is the largest by volume Defi app out there.
00:13:09.000 - 00:13:13.206, Speaker D: But you also literally couldn't have built Som just on Ethereum. I mean, that's the whole point of so. Right.
00:13:13.238 - 00:13:19.654, Speaker C: Well, yeah. With eigenware in like a year, I should, would have been able to build some it without cosmos, but.
00:13:19.742 - 00:13:30.942, Speaker D: So maybe it's worth making a distinction between kinds of applications, right. There's things that you couldn't possibly do on Ethereum. You can't build a goric on a theory. You can't build a new vm. Right. And so there, there are things where. Yeah, there's deem.
00:13:30.942 - 00:13:51.406, Speaker D: Yeah. So that's a great example. Right. You're not going to, like, go build a goric on the EVM and then find you and then move off. You can only do that using Cosmos tech, whereas there are other applications that you could build on Ethereum first and then slowly migrate off. And so that's a viable funnel for those kinds of applications. Once they hit product market fit, they want to tune better to their users, provide better experience, then app change the way.
00:13:51.518 - 00:14:52.486, Speaker B: Yeah, but I think there's. I was talking to Neil from Eclipse recently on the podcast, and we were talking about this idea of going from roll up to app chain and that sort of graduation path. And it seems like going from smart contract to roll up to app chain like that, the upgrade path is not so clear there, but I think we're going to see applications like, there are other applications that may go from, that may go the DyDX route and go app chain, go full app chain. But I think we'll probably see a lot more applications kind of roll back as cost of security increases. Like what is at stake on those chains versus the security becomes a real concern. And a lot of app chains will probably sort of, like, downgrade or if you will, or sort of come back to a lower layer of security or like, less sovereignty in the form of a roll up. Yeah, I think that's probably what we'll see in the next couple of years.
00:14:52.518 - 00:15:29.010, Speaker C: I mean, the Celestia dream is to move the roll up to smart contract trade off to almost zero. How long is that possible? How long would it take? Could that be a future? We certainly haven't really accomplished it in terms of, like, if we wanted to make smart contracts and app change and smart contracts and Cosmos app chains be as one for one from a developer experience point of view. I think we had an ambition when we sort of started, and we did not at least accomplish that ambition so far.
00:15:29.550 - 00:16:05.392, Speaker A: So I want to mix it up a bit now and have a sort of discussion around users in Cosmos and whether or not there's actually enough users already. And I know, Zaki, you've talked about before about activating the users that are already there. I know, Spade, you know, neutrons out now, Cosmosm is available. There's new types of applications coming out. So I have a question for all of you here, which would be around how important is it to focus on the users already in Cosmos and activate them as using products more than what they are now versus going out to other ecosystems where users already exist, like Ethereum, and trying to onboard them into Cosmos directly. But I want to start with you here, Spade, if that's all right.
00:16:05.576 - 00:16:46.084, Speaker E: Yeah, for sure. I mean, I think they're equally as important. And I think it also depends on what product you're trying to build. Right. It probably doesn't make a lot of sense to try and court the Ethereum community if you're building a very focused, like a cosmos focused project that solves, like, I don't know, like, liquid staking of, you know, exotic coins in cosmos, for example. I think one of the main problems is, like, we have a community that's, like, pretty badly burned from a lot of the kind of, like, you know, the bear market, basically, and basically becoming like, very, very conservative. And so we now are in a position where we have, like, all of these applications starting to actually launch.
00:16:46.084 - 00:18:07.510, Speaker E: And the Defi ecosystem in Cosmos is regenerating, and it's arguably in a better position than it has ever been since the collapse of terra last year. But finding ways to actually mobilize people to use these applications and get them battle tested as well, because that's a big part of ensuring that the ecosystem is resilient and can grow. It's like we have these modules, these contracts that are used that get a lot of activity, that can be used to build new applications and be reused, essentially is one of the things that makes Ethereum's ecosystem strong, but that we don't really have a lot of in cosmos currently. And so, yeah, I think basically one part of this is making the UX a lot more frictionless. And we have great teams like Skip and Squid and others who have been shipping a lot of awesome products in this regard recently, like IBC fund, for example, is, and the ability to buy bad kids from any chain with any token in one click is an incredible improvement in this regard. But one of the things that I found Zaki's comments on recently particularly interesting is that it's not just lowering the onboarding or the friction. It's also, we need to find ways to motivate people to try things out, because we're in a stage now where they're not even trying to discover what's possible.
00:18:07.510 - 00:18:11.798, Speaker E: Right. Do you have an. Do you want to share any of the thoughts that we were discussing recently?
00:18:11.934 - 00:19:13.160, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think so. Similia has been, you know, I've probably talked with, like, half the people in this conference about, you know, what has been working for sommelier from a growth point of view. But activating users on sommelier, I mean, like, everyone's like, okay, sommelier, highest staking yield has highest eth yield. Like, why is this thing sitting at 10 million TvL instead of 100 million TVL? And getting to that 10 million TVL has been, like, a massive struggle of reaching out direct user engagement that has been, by far the most effective way of onboarding people. And I look at Cosmos apps and most Cosmos apps, you see there's 100, 150 wallets that are willing to go in and start playing with things. And I haven't really done any, like, sort of analysis, see if it's the same hundred and 50 wallets. But I do see this, like, similar numbers, and, like, that's clearly not enough.
00:19:13.160 - 00:19:47.626, Speaker C: Right? Like, especially, you know, in an environment that's, like, you know, even lower gas costs and, like, lower fees than Ethereum l two s. So it's just, you know, it's like, we should be. And, like, there's the narratives that cosmos, that, like, our people tell themselves, okay, the best way to get airdrops is to. Is to go and stake your atom. The Ethereum narratives are. The best way to get airdrops is to go use the apps, right? Like, we have to change. We have, like, a huge user activation problem, and people are burned and people are risk averse.
00:19:47.626 - 00:20:19.756, Speaker C: But, like, now is the time, and really, now is the opportunity, if you're aligned with the cosmos ecosystem, to go out and start using stuff, become experts on this. We have built the full features of the Defi ecosystem. We have lending protocols, we have concentrated liquidity. We have per protocols. We have all these things. Everything people are doing on ethel two is you can do within Cosmos now, but we have to activate a user base to actually go out and use them. Otherwise.
00:20:19.756 - 00:20:20.760, Speaker C: Ngmi.
00:20:22.740 - 00:20:24.436, Speaker A: Seb, do you have anything to add to that?
00:20:24.588 - 00:20:39.028, Speaker B: I just thought that was such a great point that in Cosmos, we were sort of trained to stake our tokens in order to get airdrops. While in Ethereum, the airdrops come from using the apps effectively? I think that's a. Yeah.
00:20:39.044 - 00:21:37.942, Speaker E: I mean, on the flip side, that also leads to a lot of, like, heartaches when you get non civil resistant hair drops, like, exploited massively, sometimes by their own investors. Like the ribbon finance hub protocol, kind of like no, wrong project, but like ribbon finance and stuff. So, I mean, I think that this has come as well from a position of like, carefulness. Like, there's history of airdrops going wrong in Cosmos that I think projects are trying to not replicate. But I kind of agree that there's probably, like, new models that we can invent to really like, get people interested in. One of the ideas that we were bouncing around is like, in, you know, you have this idea of quests, but they tend to be heavily botted and lead to very sort of like, inorganic sort of adoption. And one model that Zaki was sort of like mentioning is like, how about you get a committed group of people and you give them resources to basically go out and, you know, pump their own bags.
00:21:37.942 - 00:22:29.966, Speaker E: Bye. Finding other folks who would be interested in this, presenting these opportunities to them, ensuring that they get the support that they need to try things out and essentially reactivate people through a more p two p approach rather than this web two batch campaign type of things. Or posting a message on Twitter about this opportunity for an airdrop somewhere being present. I think there's a lot to be explored there. So I see this as kind of like the other side of the public funding question coin, whereby we have one. Like, we need new infrastructure and new mechanisms to handle funding differently so that we can activate our developer base and like secure it and ensure that people get interesting opportunities to build on same thing for users on the other side. Right? Like, those are the two sides of our market and we need to nurture both of them, basically.
00:22:30.078 - 00:23:16.994, Speaker B: I mean, just on the user thing. Like, I want to come back to my initial statement, which was that, you know, Cosmos is very much like a. It's like a nerd ecosystem, right? Just like if you go back to like the nineties and you look at the Linux ecosystem, you had to be a real nerd to use Linux and to want to use Linux. And the users came from application like operating systems that were super user friendly, that saw this technology and that saw in it the potential to build something really great like macOS Washington, you know, a big part of that. And like, now most people that use Linux are using Mac OS, I think. And so I think that the users of like, the current state of Cosmos it doesn't really matter. What really matters is like, what applications that people are building on it.
00:23:16.994 - 00:23:29.878, Speaker B: And some of those applications that are really pushing the bar, like some of the applications here, for instance, I think will bring the users and we won't even know that it's a Cosmos stack underneath. Those users won't care.
00:23:30.054 - 00:24:23.520, Speaker D: A lot of this discussion seems to be about reactivating existing users or moving people from Ethereum, and we're all sort of competing for this small pie versus going after the, what, 6.9 billion people who aren't using cryptocurrency at all by building more useful applications. And Cosmos is the place where you actually have all the tools to build more real world things, to build new kinds of social media applications or gaming or payment systems, all these kinds of things that are now possible to bring in a real users who don't have to know they're necessarily using crypto or don't have to know they're using blockchains and don't have to be bogged down in weird semantics and things. That's the opportunity I'd really like to see. Rather than fighting for some small group who got traumatized by terra or whatever, let's build real, practical, useful applications for the real world to bring in new developers and new users who don't even have to know or care or think about anarcho libertarianism or DeFi or any of this.
00:24:24.160 - 00:24:40.728, Speaker A: So, Bucky, why do you think that some of the applications, and also user acquisition, let's say, target and focus on existing sort of crypto users rather than these new types of use cases that unlock a new type of user base that might not be in crypto yet already? Why do you think it's so focused on the other way around so far?
00:24:40.824 - 00:25:26.630, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I think Defi has sort of found product market fit and so everyone is sort of chasing that down into the ground and below, and at some point we'll get buried feet under or whatever, and that's sort of happening. And until there's like a new use case that's unlocked, that really kind of works for people, it'll be hard to open that up and build the momentum and excitement. I mean, there's a lot of people that want to build real world things. It's difficult for them to raise funding because it's like, oh, how does this fit into the narratives that we're all repeating to each other over and over again? And it doesn't. And so then you're sort of written off because VC's are super contrarian all the time, right? They definitely don't have a herd mentality about anything. So I mean, I think, you know, there's a lot of just like narrative and hype and everyone wants to invest in infrastructure because that's where like, you know, the money is to win and take it all. But you know, really we need to be building useful applications.
00:25:28.010 - 00:25:55.906, Speaker C: I think the reality is also it's like, you know, if you have to onboard a user onto self custody, if you have to onboard a user, if you have to like acquire that user, set up a wallet onboard them onto self custody, like all of that. Like, I mean even for like Defi experts, I think the apps are like, we're just at like the threshold of like, for like, you're a fairly sophisticated user where it like, doesn't take like, you know, 20 minutes to use like an app.
00:25:56.098 - 00:26:01.550, Speaker B: I tried to set up three people on Kepler this week using Google sign in and it didn't work.
00:26:02.090 - 00:26:04.954, Speaker D: Josh, where is he?
00:26:05.122 - 00:26:11.556, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, fix it web, three auth. We need something better.
00:26:11.668 - 00:26:13.560, Speaker B: No, I mean, NPC is the solution.
00:26:14.020 - 00:26:58.370, Speaker C: NPC is a solution, but that particular implementation has had so many problems. Right? And I think there are better implementations coming, but yeah, I think like, but it's like if you can't get the self cust, you know, that's the other thing is products only get better when people use them, right? It's the, it's that angry user who's in your, who's like reporting bugs, who's like, you know, who's just like in your DM's being like, this isn't working the way I expect it to. Who like helps your product improve. Right? And so we have to, we do have to, like, the existing community is a resource, I think, for crossing the chasm. And right now they're providing a lot more feedback to people who are building on Ethereum than people are building on cosmos. We have a window to change that.
00:26:59.110 - 00:27:15.142, Speaker A: So we've only got a few minutes left. So I might make this the last question I ask all of you, and I'd love to hear if you could list one catalyst each that you think will have the most impact on the cosmos and its growth in the next twelve months that you're most excited about.
00:27:15.166 - 00:27:51.420, Speaker B: I'll start with you, Seb nebulous summit. I mean, I say that a bit facetiously, but I think getting the stack, the vision and all that stuff I was mentioning earlier, in the hands of entrepreneurs and developers that are looking for like a technology that they're able to build these really cool apps with is what we should be doing. We should be empowering developers to use the stack that we think is viable for the future and to bring on, like, to build the applications that will bring on the millions of people. And so that's what we're trying to do here. At number summit.
00:27:53.320 - 00:28:46.268, Speaker D: Seb showed his thing, so I guess I'll show mine, which is collaborative finance. Yeah, I mean, that's our approach to where we can take cosmos to actually have real world impact in the payment system and meaningfully build up and intervene in finance in a way that's not just replicating the same thing, but can actually work in the real world that people can use it. But we do have to, we have to break through this gap of how we're going to get people to actually use wallets and things like that. And this is why we want to start with sort of a web two solution. Just build something that's accounts payable, build fintech and then get it to the point where it actually needs a blockchain to get to the next stage. But then you actually really have to tune to users and usability, and that requires solving the key management problem, which is kind of embarrassing that it's still unsolved for us all. But with MPC and these kinds of other sign in mechanisms, it seems like we're finally there, but we have to actually test it with real users now.
00:28:46.268 - 00:28:48.000, Speaker D: So ko fi is how we're going to do that.
00:28:50.470 - 00:29:34.520, Speaker C: This is a very difficult question for me because I do think it's the synthesis of many things is actually the path forward for Cosmos and in general, the path forward for blockchains in general to sort of get out of this sort of local optima, I think I'm really excited about real world assets. I think real world assets are probably going to be a big thing. I'm really excited about intents. It is like one sort of. It's probably the first research oriented topic that's ever been ux driven. And I do think that's probably going to be a big piece of like having a capability of like, finally, like, you know, someone can just like, open up their phone and want to do something on a blockchain and like, actually get it done.
00:29:36.300 - 00:30:30.260, Speaker E: Yeah, I agree. I think at a like, smaller scale. Two things that I'm pretty excited about is, first one is like metamask snaps that don't suck and that will take some time. But once we get there, and there are a pretty good team working on it right now. So bullish. But once we get there, I think that will significantly lower the adoption hurdle for the ecosystem as a whole. The other thing that may or may not happen over the next few years is can we get Adam to have the same money ness as other Ethereum and bitcoin currently? Because if we do, and there's a bunch of very interesting projects working on this, the time wave folks, for example, which could help if we are able to pull this off, I think it could also be a massive benefit in both UX but also the stickiness of the ecosystem, its culture, its value as a whole, essentially.
00:30:30.880 - 00:30:35.794, Speaker A: Cool. So thanks, guys. We've just wrapped up the final session of Nebula summit.
00:30:35.872 - 00:30:36.222, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:30:36.246 - 00:30:43.570, Speaker A: And ten days of conferences. So what? On to you. Thanks everyone for coming on the panel. Thanks everyone for being here after many days. It's been fantastic. Thank you.
00:30:44.430 - 00:30:48.510, Speaker C: Thank you for all for the really, like everybody came, it was amazing.
