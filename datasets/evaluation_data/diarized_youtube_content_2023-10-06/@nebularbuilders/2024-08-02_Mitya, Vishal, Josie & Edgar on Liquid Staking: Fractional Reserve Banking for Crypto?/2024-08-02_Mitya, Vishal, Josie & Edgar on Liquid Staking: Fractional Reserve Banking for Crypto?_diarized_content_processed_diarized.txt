00:00:00.600 - 00:00:32.802, Speaker A: Everyone on this panel, come on up. We got Edgar, Josie, Vishal, Matiah, Clayton, and myself also here. You guys get all cozy over there. What's up? Yeah, like Seb said, you guys are all legends. Day 27 and going. So this is the last panel on the last day and we're going to have some fun. What we're not going to do is just go down the line and then back up the line.
00:00:32.802 - 00:00:44.990, Speaker A: And then down the line and back up the line. Let's mix it up. You guys feel free to talk to each other. You guys ask each other questions. It'll just be one big open fun. Yeah.
00:00:46.370 - 00:00:47.074, Speaker B: Is this on?
00:00:47.122 - 00:00:47.474, Speaker C: Cool.
00:00:47.562 - 00:00:49.810, Speaker A: Yes. Everyone's got one. Cool.
00:00:49.850 - 00:00:50.722, Speaker B: Let's do this.
00:00:50.906 - 00:01:12.680, Speaker A: Yours not on? Oh, we're good. Cool. Cool. So, my name is Robbie. I mean, why don't we first start just by a little bit of intro, but we'll keep it real quick. We've got plenty of time on this panel, too. So real quick, why don't everyone introduce themselves and your project very quickly, and then we'll get into the nitty gritty.
00:01:14.220 - 00:01:26.310, Speaker D: Yeah. I'm Clayton Dubrowth at Eigen layer. Before that, I was at figment for about four years doing protocol strategy. So recently on the Eigen layer team.
00:01:26.390 - 00:01:37.210, Speaker E: As of last month, I'm Mitya, co founder of Drop Liquid staking protocol for Interchain, backed by Lido. Before that, I was at confio and pgp.org dot.
00:01:37.950 - 00:01:53.242, Speaker B: Hi, guys. Josie here, co founder of Milky Way. We started as a liquid staking protocol for the celestial TIA token last year, and we have since branched out to build the restaking platform for the modular ecosystem. Lovely to be here. Thanks for the invite, Vishal.
00:01:53.386 - 00:02:15.239, Speaker F: Hey, everyone, I'm Vishal, one of the co founders of Stride Labs and a contributor to the Stride protocol. Stride is liquid staking protocol for cosmos and modular blockchains, servicing 14 different lsts today and many more to come. Before this, I first worked at basis, which was a stable plan project back in 2018, back in the day, and worked in Trad five for a few years after that. And I've been in stride for the last few years.
00:02:15.939 - 00:02:32.399, Speaker C: Hello, guys, I'm Edgar from Kiln. I'm a protocol specialist there. I was at ledger before joining kiln. We are validators in the space, in the restaking space, as well as the liquid staking space. So very excited for this panel.
00:02:32.939 - 00:02:55.060, Speaker A: Awesome. So since we combined these two panels, originally it was going to be liquid staking and then it was going to be restaking. Why don't we kind of just separate the two topics for broad level sake. Does anyone want to take a stab at what is liquid staking? What is restaking? These are not the same thing. So why don't we just kind of like put that into the ether as far as why they are not the same, what differentiates the two?
00:02:56.760 - 00:03:36.280, Speaker D: So to think about staking and simplifying it as much as possible, there's three actors, right? Validator, token holder, protocol. Restaking is validator, token holder, protocol Abs AV's selection. So the most important part is what that restaking strategy is going to look like. Obviously there's unique things that you can do with an LST that creates a different value proposition for certain groups of users, but in terms of what the spread is on risk and reward, it's pretty much similar across most of them. So I would say that's the main difference.
00:03:36.900 - 00:04:27.780, Speaker A: Okay, awesome. So let's, before we get into restaking with AVss and all of that, what that entails. So validator, token holder and protocol, I mean, the most obvious and conglomerate example of this is going to be Lido, who has amassed a really significant portion of stake in the ethereum ecosystem, mentioned a really important question about not recreating the same traditional financial problems that we have with monopolization in tradfi. And so looking at this lido example and the almost monopolistic size that they have on stake, do you guys think there is a reasonable path to decentralize this stake? Is it a problem that Lido has this much stake or why not?
00:04:28.360 - 00:05:10.462, Speaker E: I guess I can start on this one. So first of all, just talking of the numbers, so I guess slider. So then we're talking about Ethereum, the way it works in Ethereum. Now, out of all the staking market, 40% is liquid staking, out of which 28% is Lido. So out of all the staking market in Ethereum, Lido is then I around maybe like 15%. So yeah, just talking of the scale, I don't think it's really fair to say it's monopoly, really. But then I think when we talk about liquid staking protocols, you should look at the different levels, right? So there is a liquid staking protocol, but then there are also not operators that work with the liquid staking protocol.
00:05:10.462 - 00:06:05.890, Speaker E: And yeah, I think we should look at what is the strategy that they're using to redistribute this, distribute the stake across the node operators, what are the practices that they're using for it? And I think this is where decentralization actually can happen. So yeah, I think when you think about Lido, you should see, okay, like are they doing a lot to contribute to decentralization of the space when they deal with the node operators? I think the answer is clearly yes, they do a lot. They are pretty transparent about it. So I think from that perspective, I wouldn't really say this is like a threat and a monopoly that threatens the space. I think that's a very strong player that contributes a lot to decentralization. Having said that, I think everyone would be super happy to see more very strong liquid staking providers, restaking providers, just because it's healthy. And yeah, I hope that's what we're going to have in interchange.
00:06:06.350 - 00:06:32.030, Speaker A: Awesome. Okay, so now extending this into the restaking space, you know, we have this amassment of stake in a particular protocol. What are the decentralization properties of such protocol when it comes to restaking? Do we have to think about centralization in a similar way and try to decentralize the operator set as much as possible for the restaking protocols up here? How are you decentralizing your operator set?
00:06:34.690 - 00:06:36.482, Speaker D: Am I the only restaking protocol right now?
00:06:36.506 - 00:06:39.150, Speaker A: No, I think we have Milky Way as well.
00:06:39.460 - 00:07:21.480, Speaker B: Okay, so for us, we actually, that's a great question. And so for I guess Eigen and symbiotic and a few of the others, they have what we internally call kind of an operator centric model, which is exactly what we think of this co centralization or decentralization thing. Right. Users delegate to an operator and an operator then chooses the abs that they want to secure. So this is very centralized in terms of the operator set. So we're like, okay, maybe we can kind of like, you know, flip it up a little bit just to decentralize it. So actually for Milky Way, for our re syncing protocol, it's going to be very programmable where the AVSS can actually choose the operators that they want to be secured by.
00:07:21.480 - 00:07:58.040, Speaker B: So basically users choose the AVss that they want to secure, and the AVss then choose the operators that they want to then secure them. So it can be as centralized or as decentralized as they want it to be. So it can be like, okay, I'm going to open up to space and let basically anyone be able to join the set. Or they can have certain parameters where it's like need to have certain self stake or certain delegation amount. So it's going to be very programmable because that's exactly what we think that we shouldn't be the one defining the rules. It should be up to the AV's to define in terms of the decentralization, how much of a risk appetite they have.
00:07:59.060 - 00:08:42.610, Speaker D: Yeah, I think to, you know, looking at restaking, it's naturally more complex ecosystem compared to staking protocols. So generally that's going to lead into concentration because a lot of people do participate in systems in a passive way and then aggregating capital into smaller group of vehicles. It's just a natural thing that would happen in that regard as well. So how do we allow LRT vehicles to be created quicker is probably a solution without like changing the market dynamics itself, because then you have to start making rules as a protocol that is limiting how people can actually scale out their business models on chain.
00:08:43.910 - 00:08:55.668, Speaker A: Awesome. Okay. And so that would be like creating more things like Swell and Etherfi and kind of like more permissionless types of Lrtail projects.
00:08:55.724 - 00:08:56.564, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly.
00:08:56.652 - 00:08:57.004, Speaker A: Okay.
00:08:57.052 - 00:09:09.700, Speaker D: And I was previously at Rio, that code is now open source at the foundation. So hopefully a lot of people can use it and make more lrts in the future.
00:09:09.820 - 00:09:39.930, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah, so I'm seeing like two dimensions on which we can decentralize. We can decentralize at the LRT level and then we can decentralize at the operator level. And that's great news. Open sourcing code is how we get things more permissionless. And so that helps a lot at the restaking level, at the protocol level. And so at the operator level, what can be done to further lower the entry barriers so that we can have some more permissionless even if it's not fully permissionless.
00:09:39.930 - 00:09:45.630, Speaker A: But how do we take a step in that direction to make more permissionless types of operators?
00:09:46.460 - 00:10:28.132, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, anyone can run an operator on eigen layer. Right now, I think the way you make it more attractive for different groups of network participants is by actually having incentives on chain, which we are planning to roll out here soon. And so more carrots in the system as opposed to Stix, and having more standardization in place as well. So making sure key management is easier depending on the network that you want to run. Right. Maybe you do only want a specific group of selected actors that are really sophisticated. But if decentralization is more of what you're looking for, you need to have simplicity.
00:10:28.132 - 00:10:29.160, Speaker D: Top of mind.
00:10:30.500 - 00:10:39.118, Speaker A: And is it similar in Milky Way as far as how low is the barrier of entry when it comes to being an operator, it's going to be permissionless.
00:10:39.164 - 00:10:48.506, Speaker B: So completely up to the AV's to decide in terms of how strict they want it to be. Awesome. Because it's the AV's that would choose in terms of the operators that they want to secure them.
00:10:48.618 - 00:10:49.138, Speaker A: Okay.
00:10:49.234 - 00:10:49.458, Speaker F: Okay.
00:10:49.474 - 00:11:41.968, Speaker A: Maybe we'll get more into the mechanism by which users can choose AVSs, and AVSs can choose operators or vice versa. But first, like, let's bring the liquid staking portion of this kind of, like, more forefront. So, you know, like, taking eigen layers as an example. You know, everyone can kind of, like, spin up an eigenpon, stake their ETH in that, or commit it directly to an LRT. And so for the liquid staking projects on this panel, like, when it comes to, you know, you guys have your liquid staking projects, but you've seen the rise of these liquid restaking projects. What observations have you made and what adjustments have you had to make in your business models to sort of, like, you know, understand that these LRT's exist now? What changes have you had to make to adapt to coexist with these LRT projects, if any?
00:11:42.024 - 00:11:44.288, Speaker B: There are no LRts in cosmos yet.
00:11:44.424 - 00:12:23.196, Speaker E: None for now. Yeah, I think for cosmos, it's kind of early, let's say. So we will have to see how exactly it evolves. Yeah, and I'm actually not sure if we're going to see a future when people kind of combine these two models together or if they're going to be separated in two, which is kind of yet to be seen as well. Both could be an option, potentially. This probably makes sense when people specialize in there is LsT that then provides collateral to LRT's and so on. But for us, it's pretty early, to be honest.
00:12:23.196 - 00:12:25.960, Speaker E: So, yeah, we could only get so far.
00:12:27.420 - 00:12:56.618, Speaker F: I think that's all right for Cosmos today. It's not really that impacted by Lrtsen, but I think we have seen a lot of action on Ethereum, and I think the natural inclination is eventually we're going to see that in other ecosystems, like Solana or Cosmos or any other ecosystem. And so it doesn't make sense to start thinking about how this might affect users. And I think it raises kind of an interesting dichotomy between LSTs and LRT's. I think for most users, like for LST, that serves two purposes. One is you secure the chain. You are contributing to the economic sphere of the chain.
00:12:56.618 - 00:13:20.452, Speaker F: And the second is that you can earn yield with these tokens. Now you can go deploy them elsewhere. And there are users that care about both of these. But in my experience, I think most users care predominantly the second one. And the staking is some users care a lot about it. But for the majority of defi users that care most about like yield or how they can get sustainable or safe types of yield, but the source that yield or the benefits of it, some people care about it, but it's not 100%. And I think we're going to see that a little bit with LRT's.
00:13:20.452 - 00:13:34.050, Speaker F: Right now. My impression is LRT's mostly. It's somewhat hard to compare the yield with LRT and LST. A lot of LRT yield right now is points farming. So it's unclear what the actual net yield end up being. LST is. Obviously your yield comes natively from the chain, so it's extremely explicit.
00:13:34.050 - 00:13:59.182, Speaker F: I would imagine relatively soon we're going to move to a world where LRT yields are also more definitive. And then you get this weirdness where LRT yield might be higher or lower in LST yield, and then the users, will they just go to, everyone is higher, will they go to the one that they understand better, like LSD, maybe a little more understandable. LRTs might be more like the types of yield you get might be more novel, you might prioritize that. Or you might be like, hey, we like this defi application. I want to use that LRtail. But then we're going to start seeing a fracturing. Right now.
00:13:59.182 - 00:14:18.590, Speaker F: It's basically like the market for LSTs is, are there users that want to participate in defi and access yield on top of that? And that's basically the entire market. And now we're going to see much more fragmentation in that market. It's not obvious to me what's going to happen is that LSts have to combine. Everyone has to do both. Everyone has to be whatever is the maximal yield. Will it be like, oh, there's one token. This is going to be the safest yield.
00:14:18.590 - 00:14:27.794, Speaker F: This one's going to be the riskiest yield. How are we actually going to go into that fragmentation? Because the dimensionality of staking tokens now is like ten xing actually.
00:14:27.922 - 00:15:08.568, Speaker B: Another thing is in terms of fragmentation, that's a great point. So for us, since we're building the first restaking platform on the cosmos and modular ecosystem, so we are not building a liquid restaking token like issuance on top of our restaking platform. But there will be another company doing that. And then for them, they're actually going to intake since we're doing a. And then, so it's going to be Tia, Miltia, Seta, what will your DTA? Okay, DTA. And then, so it's actually a great way for users in a way, to, like, kind of combine it, and then because they get, you know, one LRT, regardless of which token they input it. So in some way, it's a great way to see it as consolidation of the fragmentation.
00:15:08.568 - 00:15:17.106, Speaker B: And then apart from obviously, the liquid staking yield that they'll get, they will also get their restaking yield on top of it when they hold this liquid restaking token.
00:15:17.298 - 00:15:30.470, Speaker E: And I think that's a kind of killer use case for the Ethereum kind of staking these things on top of each other and then getting all the, all the benefits possible. I think that's a hot space, right?
00:15:30.770 - 00:15:55.098, Speaker A: Yeah. I realize it's one step at a time, but I've heard Siri Rahm and Eigen Lair point to the idea of more than just ethereum as potential restaking collateral. And so I imagine a world where we could have some liquid staking tokens that are interest bearing as collateral economic security for avss. What is kind of like, if you wanted to jump in. Yeah.
00:15:55.154 - 00:16:05.266, Speaker E: Isn't it happening already, though? I think you could do lsts as collateral. I think they support Athena as collateral as well now. So it's. Yeah, yeah.
00:16:05.298 - 00:16:08.770, Speaker D: Symbiotic and Eigen layer will support all ERC 20s.
00:16:08.850 - 00:16:20.306, Speaker A: So awesome. And so what's the general theme there? Like, what, when you're, when you're considering, like an appropriate token for economic stake of your chain, like, what are some of the factors that you consider?
00:16:20.498 - 00:17:02.280, Speaker D: I mean, the degenerate me is like, anyone can do whatever they want. So I think starting out with ETH is like, setting the tone, right? Like, this is this universal asset. The main difference between symbiotic and eigen layer as well is, like, for our reasons versus their reasons, we're choosing the ability to natively restake Ethan on Eigen layer. But in the future, stablecoins, bitcoin derivatives, native ABS tokens that may be applied to a broader group of ABS's could be something that you can create an LRT on as well. So I would like to see people just go crazy.
00:17:03.980 - 00:17:49.058, Speaker B: For Milky Way as well. We're going to do a multi asset approach. And actually, how this came about is obviously there are other blue chip assets apart from TIA, but actually, one of the pain points that we see the most in terms of the ABS or projects that we're working with is a lot of them actually don't want rented security in the beginning, and they only do it because they can't accrue enough security by themselves. And that's why they need to rent security from some other token. But eventually they do want to be secured by their own token. So what we do is we have this params where they can switch in terms of the assets they can choose in terms of what assets they want to be secured, secured by. So probably it's like 100% TIA in the beginning, and then after the token launch, since it's relatively low market cap, it might be like 5% their own token, 95% TIA.
00:17:49.058 - 00:17:58.458, Speaker B: And then as their token grows in market cap, then it's like, you know, gradually till it's 100%, and then they no longer need to rent security. So that's how we see it. And a lot of projects like this approach.
00:17:58.514 - 00:18:41.960, Speaker D: Yeah, I think to make it even more confusing, what's likely going to happen is this index sort of took token where any yield bearing asset and any reward that you're receiving from your AV's selection strategy will likely need a crypto representation on chain as well. Even if you're restaking on 100 different ABS's and one token or one ABS is giving you $10 a month to do that or something, the gas costs, at least on Ethereum, it's like, well, I'm just never going to touch that token, but if there's a representation of the entire stake position, you can actually leverage that reward in Defi.
00:18:42.620 - 00:18:58.620, Speaker A: Okay, and so how are you thinking about allocation in these mechanisms? Like, is there, like you said, if you're going to rebalance your position across all these different AbS's for different yield reasons, that's going to cost you a ton in gas. Is there any kind of like more efficient mechanism that you foresee?
00:18:58.780 - 00:19:54.896, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, when I was at Rio, what we were selling, right, is like the strategy manager, and I think over time, once more sticks enter the system, once people do start getting slashed and they see that potentially, maybe if there's a catastrophic event on eigen layer because someone wasn't necessarily doing that risk management part, that's going to be a huge marketing lever for any LRT. You need to do that on the technical side as well. How many eigenpods are you doing? Do you want to do selection on a monthly or quarterly basis? And then you also want to have input from your governance token holder community, because maybe saying the quiet part out loud, but a lot of LRT vehicles are on chain asset managers. And so how do you make sure that you're doing this in a compliant way or in a way that these regulators are like, okay, that's good enough.
00:19:55.048 - 00:20:33.450, Speaker A: Makes sense. Zooming out a bit and kind of considering duality of man that we have here. Like, there's cosmos and there's ethereum. And so these two ecosystems look very different when we're thinking about this liquid staking on the verge of restaking in cosmos. And then, and then we see the paradigm on Ethereum generally, what are the two states in, like, the current present moment of each industry? How do they differ? And then do we generally see those converging, or is there going to be some nuances to differentiating those two ecosystems going forward?
00:20:34.110 - 00:20:40.690, Speaker E: You mean liquid staking, restaken conversion, or cosmos and ethereum conversion, the state, everything conversion?
00:20:41.630 - 00:20:43.770, Speaker A: I generally mean Cosmos and Ethereum.
00:20:44.310 - 00:21:37.340, Speaker E: Oh, yeah. I think there is some convergence that has been happening from the perspective of, like, Cosmos started the idea of app chains, and then this idea is kind of everywhere. I think Cosmos also started, let's say, having difficulties from fragmentation because it pioneered the app chain idea. And now these difficulties are kind of in the l two space as well. So I think, yeah, if you look at it overall, these two ecosystems started from two very different places, and now they come into, in a sense, kind of similar architectures. So, yeah, that's actually pretty, pretty interesting to observe. And I'm excited about the fact that cosmos, because it had all these challenges from the beginning, has actually created pretty cool solutions for it.
00:21:37.340 - 00:22:09.180, Speaker E: Like, for instance, what Scip API is doing for cross chain swaps and what squid is doing for the same. It's pretty amazing. And, like, people, when they're coming from, from the Ethereum world or, like, outside of Cosmos world in general, they're pretty excited about, like, this has been solved. So, yeah, I think there's a lot that people can learn from the cosmos path and kind of apply this in Ethereum or some of the other ecosystems as well. So, yeah, Cosmos is eating the world in a sense. And, yeah, that's really good to see.
00:22:10.520 - 00:22:58.850, Speaker F: Purely vibes based. My sense is there's like, a slight difference in maybe, like, mission or what people think of when they think of Ethereum and Cosmos and they are converging, definitely. To some extent. My loose sense is I think there is a slight difference in what people think of these ecosystems for and what kind of niche they're going to fill. Ethereum, I feel like, is my mind mostly geared around using ETH as money, and how can this whole ecosystem prop up etH, and how far can we go in this concept of take this really big asset and build these really interesting primitives on top of it? There's all sorts of really great research on Ethereum, but in my mind, because it's more institutionally focused, more on this really big asset, it's a little bit slower as well. It takes a long time to make changes. Changes that are made are very thoughtful and very impactful, like there's rolled out to hundreds of thousands or millions of users, but it feels more slow moving, more geared around.
00:22:58.850 - 00:24:00.692, Speaker F: How can you make this really big institution that can treat eth as money? And if you look at all sorts of projects in Ethereum, they all have kind of like socially agreed upon ETH as being their unit of currency or unit of domination, and you take base or you take any project, even uniswap, like a lot of them, drive value back to ETH. Fundamentally, for Cosmos, I think the driving goal is more sovereignty and experimentation, as well as giving apps value cool back to apps. So I think we see this. We see many more cosmos chains, many more cosmos chain failures, because there's more experimentation. Also many more interesting successes like Tierpoint skip, very interesting success, totally novel use case, something we really have not seen before, and probably would have taken two years of writing Eips to do this on Ethereum, but rolled out in just a few months with a relatively small engineering team in Cosmos. I think we're going to keep seeing that in cosmos, you have so much more freedom and flexibility to pursue pretty novel types of experimentation on the consensus layer, on the application layer, on the interbridging layer, et cetera. But then also, I think for Cosmos, we're also one step back.
00:24:00.692 - 00:24:54.360, Speaker F: I think crypto in general, so far, many apps rely on the basel one for distribution of their own product. So most applications on Ethereum, the main value they get from being on Ethereum is they can tap into the user base and infrastructure that exists there. And for just given the state of crypto today, there aren't that many users. And so it matters a lot that you can tap into distribution networks. I think we're starting to hit the point that where lots of applications that have their own distribution, that have their own users independent of their own l one good example of this, DyDx, they're started on Ethereum, but their brand and their presence is built up such a point where users think of Dydx as a separate application. And then for those kind of apps, I think it makes a lot of sense to start going into the Cosmos model, where you can move faster and capture more value, you can build more bespoke apps. I suspect we're going to keep seeing the sort of delineation, where you see apps that are bigger, want to capture more value, move to the cosmoside model, and apps that need more experimentation, and apps that want to tap into this global network of money and need really large amounts of distribution or need large amounts of capital will keep building on Ethereum.
00:24:56.380 - 00:24:57.372, Speaker E: Just piggyback.
00:24:57.436 - 00:24:57.924, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely.
00:24:57.972 - 00:25:28.250, Speaker E: Quickly, because I think Vishal started an interesting topic about level of experimentation. Just for the record, I think so we're working on LSTs, LRT's in the space, three completely different architectures. So there is app chain. Then you're migrating to a roll up. Soon we're building an integrated app based on smart contracts, building from very different perspective, similar tools for the end user. So I think that's a continuum of architectures that cosmos enables is pretty cool.
00:25:28.630 - 00:26:12.450, Speaker A: Yeah. And there's also this paradigm of network effects where you do have, to your point, distribution. And if you can tap into the distribution, network effects, you end up with some significant firepower that you can have for your project. And then there are some different environments that have some different network effects for their ecosystems. I also think that there's going to be some projects that already have distribution. You mentioned DyDX kind of went through their user adoption and graduated to their app chain. Projects may come in from web two, or Tradfi land and Leapfrog all of that already have distribution, you know, off chain, and then put all of that on chain and create their own sovereignty that way.
00:26:12.450 - 00:26:39.150, Speaker A: And so generally, when you're thinking about network effects and how you can sort of help projects generate some adoption and generate some distribution through your ecosystems. Cosmos Ethereum eigen layer AV's ecosystem. Like what? What are the network effects that you see present in your ecosystems? And then how can you help spread those network effects to the most effective and efficient way for the projects that are building in each of these ecosystems?
00:26:40.330 - 00:27:50.980, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I think any AV's right now, it's totally their go to market, right? Like this alignment with this burgeoning new way of building. I think Cosmos chains as well, they want to ride that wave together. I think the interesting thing when you're talking about such a universal asset like Ethereum, is some of these AVss, particularly, you know, in the future, like Defi AVss, can, you know, get a lot of kickbacks from running the underlying infrastructure for the AV's as well, you know, as an operator. And so you do kind of have this flywheel where it's actually beneficial to be here and get that, like, transaction flow kickback, which you can also do in the cosmos or something. But I think in terms of how you do it at scale, where there's, you know, a lot of AbS's that you may be using and then there's these of agreements either on chain or off chain that do benefit you to stay. That's going to be the moat that needs to be built for any ecosystem because DyDX is a great example. Once they realized that there was no way for them to give value back to their token holder community, they needed to go find something else to build on.
00:27:52.040 - 00:28:41.724, Speaker B: Yeah, Fajal made a great point. In terms of, in cosmos, there are a lot of developers basically coming here because they're attracted to the flexibility of the tech stack and then that's why they want to experiment and launch projects on, right. But then for them, obviously, you know, the security is a problem and hence that's why we talked a lot of them and then decided to build a retaking platform because it's quite hard for them to connect to Eigen, for example, because of different languages, essentially. And for them, when we told them about the whole multi asset approach, they're actually super excited because they see that as basic. A launchpad in their own words. They're like, oh cool. So basically these group of early supporters, they provide security to us, and then when our token launch, then it's going to drive a lot of hype potentially, because, for example, we can give them some discounted rate to purchase or do some activity with them.
00:28:41.724 - 00:28:58.420, Speaker B: So in some way they actually see us as a launchpad, which I thought was really fascinating. And I was like, okay, that's a nice way to see it. We never thought of ourselves as a launchpad, but then it's good and it kind of drives the community and the defi ecosystem, then I think it's going to be great for the community.
00:28:59.920 - 00:29:34.930, Speaker F: I totally agree with both those excellent answers. Maybe one slight hot take and maybe one more criticism of cosmos. I think the general way that most ecosystems have agreed network effects, the most valuable one is agreeing on unit of count. Like Ethereum, everyone takes ETH and there's not really that much coordination needed on projects. From that point on, everyone just agrees to build an ethical they give up a little bit of value curls around token, but as a result, they give so much value to ETH that it drives some usage to the overall ecosystem. Somewhere in Solana, it's not really obvious, like radium and Jupiter, for example, collaborate, but they both are built in the same stack. Both drive value back to soul and as a result, shared users grows the whole space.
00:29:34.930 - 00:29:58.170, Speaker F: Maybe one additional network effect exists elsewhere is shared application state. So radium, for example, can look at Jupyter application state, or pumpfun can look at someone else's application state. They're all shared both. These are not really present in Cosmos today. And I think it's part of the difficulty why it's been a little bit harder to drive similar network effects. In Cosmos, we do share users, we share wallets. There's a lot of infrastructure that's shared, but, you know, account is not shared, and application state is quite hard to share as well.
00:29:58.170 - 00:30:26.590, Speaker F: So it's really hard to have applications that plug into an application on, like xchain and y chain as well, just because reading the data is harder. And the fact that everyone is focused on a different token has lots of pros. But I think one meaningful con is it gives a smaller shelling point for little space. And I don't have a great solution to this, and I think it's something cosmos is kind of grappling with right now. But I think it's one thing that's holding back the space is that we haven't yet found a way to build really great network effects with all these sovereign chains. But I think it's possible we all have a lot of shared incentives. We're building very similar things.
00:30:26.590 - 00:30:33.130, Speaker F: A lot of the users are interested in these projects for very similar reasons. But I think we still need a little bit of discovery on what that write mechanism is.
00:30:33.430 - 00:31:09.846, Speaker E: Yeah, I think there's one more thing in cosmos that is almost kind of the opposite of network effect. Just how native staking ended up working for most of the cosmos chains. And I think it was implemented so well that now it's a problem. So it's very easy. So if you compare, like, ethereum to cosmos, like in Ethereum, it's so difficult to become, like, to work as a validator, you have to have 32 eth, you have to spin your own infrastructure so that for everyone, that was just a natural solution to use lsts. And then when LSTs were created, like, for the first time, the defi summer has happened already. Had happened already.
00:31:09.846 - 00:31:34.650, Speaker E: So there was like a natural kind of thing. When you just plug in your LST, boom. Now it's a huge market in cosmos. What we have is that native staking is super easy. Staking aprs and native staking are high, inflation is high. So everyone is kind of incentivized to do just native staking, sit back and relax. And I think our kind of collective goal is to provide a very, very appealing alternative to this and unlock the assets.
00:31:34.650 - 00:31:48.990, Speaker E: Then we have a lot of liquidity for applications, roll ups, whatever. And I think that's a huge problem to solve. And yeah, I think we have pretty cool teams that are working on this now. So I'm looking forward to working on this together.
00:31:49.370 - 00:32:19.770, Speaker C: Just to add to that, I think that the cosmos ecosystem natively incentivizes native staking to the importance of votes, for example. And ethereum kind of like natively through its very biggest defi ecosystem. On top of just the fact that native staking is so complex and needs to be abstracted, it incentivizes the user to go through like an LST because you're going to get on top of your, of your native like rewards you're going to get. Also defi yields.
00:32:21.230 - 00:32:33.090, Speaker A: How do the yields compare when you're talking about native staking in Cosmo? I think I'm generally aware of how it works in Ethereum, but in Cosmos, how does it work? Or how do those yields compare between liquid staking and native staking?
00:32:33.130 - 00:32:38.350, Speaker E: It's amazing. Cosmos, it's like eleven on Celestia for now.
00:32:39.570 - 00:32:40.910, Speaker D: Is that a good thing?
00:32:41.570 - 00:32:57.950, Speaker E: Actually, yeah. I mean, it's amazing for if you want to be kind of passive and sit back and relax, I think it's not great, if you look at it, how easy it is to incentivize the user to do something else with it. And that's kind of, this is why, why I'm saying it's kind of blessing and a curse.
00:32:59.130 - 00:33:07.030, Speaker B: So they should still put their TIA in our protocols and then get that 11% and whatever they get on DeFi.
00:33:08.050 - 00:33:29.040, Speaker D: I think the. So not trying to yell at you, because I think the reward rate of stake to Ethereum is too low as well. I think anyone that is releasing a highly volatile asset in a very burgeoning but nascent industry should at least target a yield, a reward rate higher than treasury yields.
00:33:30.220 - 00:34:43.890, Speaker A: Yeah, on bitcoin, there's no yield. I heard someone say yet. That's what I was going for. Okay, that makes sense as far as the network effects and also the liquidity and yield that we get as part of staking and restaking. You know, we talk about kind of the network effects in each of these ecosystems when it comes to restaking, specifically, there's network effects that we get, in addition, because we have AV's ecosystems that go on top of this restaking yield, but that also comes with a trade off because we have shared security, a lot of times, and maybe we'll get into whether or not this is present in the cosmos case, but when it comes to shared security, Tarun Chitra from Gauntlet gave a talk about this at modular summit, and basically talked through the contagion risk of a particular economic security. If there was some economic security contagion, it would spread amongst the rest of the AVss in the ecosystem that were also sharing security of that pool. And so I'm curious, from the restaking projects up here, how, you know, what steps can we take to mitigate that, if any? And how are you seeing this in theory or in practice?
00:34:45.110 - 00:35:34.060, Speaker D: I mean, I think, you know, again, with not trying to control everything, making recommendations on what avss would slash, right? I mean, again, going back to the carrots and sticks, if. If an ABS looks like the slashing conditions are way too scary, there's 200 other, you know, revenue sources for me. If I'm like running infrastructure on ABS's, that AV's probably is going to get a lot of quality operators on the network. And so I think the market will kind of play itself out without us needing to worry about that too much. But again, if we're not worried about it, that's when the contagion happens. But most absers are going to have some form of, at least in eigen layer. What we're thinking about right now is attributable security, as opposed to total pooled security.
00:35:34.060 - 00:36:25.480, Speaker D: So there wouldn't necessarily be an event where I 100% of someone's stake on an operator is slashed by a single abs, if that makes sense. Again, that's just how we're thinking about this over time. But yeah, you want to create systems where there's not an over incentive of stretching your infrastructure too thin. As well as someone who was in the operator space for four years, there's generally two times when stuff messes up on chain. One is during the bull market, where there's just so much flashy new things. And maybe some unsophisticated actors can aggregate a lot of capital and start spending this stuff up and they mess up. The other is in a bear market when you're trying to cut costs as well.
00:36:25.480 - 00:36:46.900, Speaker D: And that's generally by sophisticated actors who are used to running it. It's just they're losing money by maintaining that infrastructure. I think right now, in the restaking ecosystem as a whole, not just Eigen layer, we need to be thinking about how we pay people first, and then start thinking about how we punish them later. So that's my two satoshis there.
00:36:47.880 - 00:37:13.530, Speaker B: Yes. So this contagion risk and also the slashing is actually a huge problem, obviously. And so for us at Milky Way, it's back to the whole, where we think it should be a very programmable approach where we shouldn't dictate in terms of the slashing rules and also the rewards distribution and the assets, et cetera. So on the slashing front, obviously, there's a traditional kind of burn slashing, which I think everyone's quite scared of. It's like you just burned. That's ultimate death penalty. It's gone.
00:37:13.530 - 00:37:38.092, Speaker B: Right. But even in the law, it's not just you break the law and then you die. Right? There's courts and then you get trial, and then there's variations of punishments, and then. So we're like, okay, that should kind of be the same as well, right? Should be down to the AV's to choose. You know, you covet this crime and then. So you deserve this penalty. And so it will be very programmable as well for Milky Way.
00:37:38.092 - 00:38:03.416, Speaker B: So we're starting with three different type of slashing rules. So there is obviously the traditional death penalty of the burn slashing, but there's also the stake slash, which is basically it get redistributed to other operators. So from the user's perspective perspective, their principal or their restaked amount is never touched, and their rewards is also not affected. Right. Because rewards is exactly. Very important. And then the third is actually the jail slash, which is just downtime.
00:38:03.416 - 00:38:15.740, Speaker B: So the principal amount of the restaked will also never be touched. It will just be a little bit less rewards received. So that's how we're seeing it. And obviously we'll get, you know, add more and more slashing rules as we evolve.
00:38:16.410 - 00:39:15.220, Speaker D: Yeah. What's also interesting for LRT vehicles as well, in terms of punishing maybe operators and LRT's as opposed to stakers, is you are aggregating all of these reward sources under a single operator or LRT vehicle. If you get perma jailed as someone whose job it is, is to aggregate all of this under a single operator address, you would have to unwind all those pieces of infrastructure that you're running on all these abs's and spin up a brand new operator, which is much different in the cosmos ecosystem to where if you get perma jailed on a network, it's just, okay, that one's done. I can just turn on another one fairly quickly. And then the risk of watching your Tbl bleed out by not having access to maybe the one abs that's generating 20% of your, you know, product offering, which is an APY is significant enough.
00:39:16.720 - 00:39:34.580, Speaker A: And Josie, you mentioned like three different types of slashing. Eigen layer doesn't have slashing yet, but when you're thinking about slashing, are those three types of slashing still the types of the slashing types in theory that would get implemented when slashing is turned on?
00:39:35.160 - 00:40:06.062, Speaker D: Yeah, like, you know, double sign events and you know, downtime. But a lot of these decentralized networks may not necessarily be blockchains over time. So that's when this sort of inter subjective work token in the form of icon comes into play. And you would be required to stake some of that amount. And then that would be the slashable amount for anything deemed bad. But you can't do it automatically because there does need to be some sort of governance, a place with that.
00:40:06.246 - 00:40:43.060, Speaker A: Okay, I think that's a good segue into the next question here, which I'm gonna. It's a dumb question, but I know it's a dumb question. And so there's like this like economic security is a meme thing that floats around sometimes and it comes in waves. And I think there is like, I don't know, ZK is real kinda. And so like, you know, if everything is like, has the potential to be cryptographically proven by ZK or some other cryptographic proof, do we need crypto economic security or is that just a meme?
00:40:43.840 - 00:41:15.822, Speaker F: Well, I think you can definitely interplay and you probably need less once you have ZK. But they feel like they fit different niches. Like you want ZK security to know. Like given these set of rules, are people following those rules or are they breaking them? Helps a lot for there. And the way I think of economics here in general is like, can the rules themselves be redefined? And oftentimes you do want, like, sometimes you're just like, no, the rules will never get redefined. In which case you're in economic security or use deploy on like some smart contract or something that's like kind of immutable. But if you oftentimes you do want like changing rules, you want somebody to upgrade.
00:41:15.822 - 00:41:23.540, Speaker F: And then like, how do you define that? And that's often economic security. But I do agree, I think it's, we probably have too much economic security and it's a. What would it mean?
00:41:24.440 - 00:42:12.490, Speaker D: I mean, depending on who you're talking to, right? Like you're talking to like a large traditional institution that's not here yet at all, but it's like willing to talk to like, you know, the coinbases of the world or something. They care about that number, which is interesting. You know, it's like how much assets are staked on this network that you're trying to sell me to like move my banking infrastructure off of and onto this. Right. So even if it's just like a vanity number, that's interesting for those more boring people who have to care about a lot of stuff. But then also too, on just what the assets represent, like proof of work versus proof of stake. Proof of stake is a way to distribute incentives to people who are actually just holding the token as well while taking on some sort of risk.
00:42:12.490 - 00:42:21.776, Speaker D: And you do like lose that network effects of that asset if you're not having some sort of staking layer as well.
00:42:21.928 - 00:42:22.660, Speaker A: Cool.
00:42:23.200 - 00:43:06.470, Speaker B: For us, not saying we agree that it's a meme, but that's also why it's back to the programmable, where we let the abss choose in terms of how much security they need, essentially because we had some that's like, okay, we don't need a lot because they don't secure a lot of TVL on their platform. Right. We also speak with, you know, defi dapps where they do, you know, margin trading and lending, et cetera, where for them, when they speak to those institution clients like Clayton mentioned, then it would be like, okay, I want to match dollar for dollar security. So it really depends. And also there's like, you know, other protocols out there, like blocklist, where they do social scoring, like based on reputation. So I think that's also, you know, another good way to use it, maybe.
00:43:07.460 - 00:43:29.156, Speaker F: And the goal of being a little bit spicy and talking about why I think it's a little bit of a meme. Economic security in particular, why it's a bit of a meme. I think security matters a ton. And I think all of us on the stage would agree. But I think people fixate a lot on the one number of how many dollars are at stake just because it's easy to interpret. And it's also the biggest number you can come up with. So you're easy to tell someone, hey, $100 billion economic security.
00:43:29.156 - 00:43:53.590, Speaker F: But in practice, I think your security is the weakest link. It's the minimum across all things you have. So Nakamoto, for example, one example, like how many operators have to bribe or blackmail or give us a pinot to. To cause them to change their operations. That's often much easier than actually acquiring all the state required to upset those operators. There's also things like how secure my operators in general, like are they all in the same AWS cluster? And actually I just have to subpoena Amazon. And now like, all the security of this network's gone.
00:43:53.590 - 00:44:22.250, Speaker F: There's lots of different ways to look at security. And so operator diversity and how hard it is to run a node itself or the odds that there being a bug in those nodes. All these things matter. And for what's right, I think everyone on the stage recognizes that. And I think everyone on the stage is spending a lot of time thinking about which validators delegate to operators delegate to. How do you incentivize good operations by those operators? And that definitely hits in all these aspects of security you care a lot about. Armor operator is different, they have different attack vectors.
00:44:22.250 - 00:44:35.932, Speaker F: It's just annoying. It's challenging, I think, because it's hard to communicate this really high dimensional problem to the public being like, oh, I have, here's a ten points of security and here's where I score on all of them. And I think people fixate a little bit too much on just this raw number of economic security.
00:44:36.076 - 00:45:11.330, Speaker A: Yeah, I like that take. And you know, we're running low on time, but we had 45 minutes for this panel, which I thought was going to be plenty. But for some reason I feel like we could go for another 45 because it leads to an interesting question of like how do we price this economy? And I think you point to a lot of factors that are important. It's not just about the amount, it's about the quality of that economic security, which is not always the same. And so I think this is true of like liquid staking and liquid restaking projects. Anyone who's paying a yield for stake. And so we got 20 seconds, maybe we'll go like a minute or two over.
00:45:11.330 - 00:45:21.536, Speaker A: But yeah, like how do we price economic security? You know, let's. That'll be our final, final question. And then. Any closing thoughts?
00:45:21.688 - 00:45:28.120, Speaker D: I mean, I think it, this leads to economic security being a meme, right? It's like if you, if you don't.
00:45:28.160 - 00:45:31.048, Speaker A: Need a specific, mission accomplished, but if.
00:45:31.064 - 00:46:11.118, Speaker D: You don't need a specific number, right. You know, I think, you know, ethereum, like should have a lot, right? But if you're a versioning, you know, new abs, trying to find product market fit, you could probably just be more open with like, this is how much money we're going to give to our operator set if you want to be restaking here, I guess. But you know, that the APY is going to be pretty small because there's too much people doing it, and then some people won't like that. Like that eth will come out of the system. So I think just there's going to be marketplace dynamics, and people are going to price this some sort of way and willing to take the risk based on the basket that they're choosing as a restaking strategy over time.
00:46:11.254 - 00:46:40.450, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that economic security prices itself. So, like, when rewards go live on eigen layer, for example, if we start seeing like 15% APY going sent to restakers, we're gonna see like, massive inflows on Eigen layer. And at the contrary level, like, if we start seeing like 0.1%, for example, we're gonna see like, massive outflows. So I think that security and rewards will always, like, reach an equilibrium, which is fine with both parties.
00:46:40.490 - 00:46:59.106, Speaker E: Basically, I want to see a project that does like, leveraging economic security on a transaction level. So I have very, very important transaction. I want to have a lot of economic security for this one. Just for this one. I want to pay a lot for any of the others. That's the way to find the right price.
00:46:59.258 - 00:47:05.746, Speaker A: We call those ephemeral roll ups. Okay, yeah. Closing dots.
00:47:05.818 - 00:47:20.682, Speaker F: Yeah. Just answering the question of price economic security. Totally agree with these takes so far. I think it does kind of price itself. And I suspect we will see different products. Some products might have to pay more because people don't trust their tokens to pay less. But maybe one kind of meta observation.
00:47:20.682 - 00:47:44.152, Speaker F: I think right now, historically, there's been very few ways to pay for security or even consume security. You're kind of like, if you're cosmos to KCHN, you have one option. You had one option. If you're in a regular l two or something, you had one option. And so you only have this notion of how many dollars you were paying for security. Now, all of the work that everyone on this panel is doing is ways to expand the optionality projects to pay for security. I think really, the current paradigm is probably not that good for most projects.
00:47:44.152 - 00:48:13.746, Speaker F: And that it's just, you have one option, like, how many dollars do I pay? That's how many dollars security I want. But I think the security most projects care about is quite more complicated than that. For example, I think stride might care about how many unique operators do I have, or how many different locations are nodes located in. And there's no ability to express this preference today. But I think we're quickly going to move to a world where products can express their preferences, what they want to pay. Like, okay, if I have a validator with 20% of my overall sake, I just don't really want to pay them anymore. If I want to pay more for security, I want other validators.
00:48:13.746 - 00:48:42.140, Speaker F: And I think products can start specifying I care about having at least not going to coefficient of five, three different countries and then you pay for whichever one of those things you're not meeting. And a lot of the work people are doing on restaking, for example, allows for these more complex preferences and something we're also working on expanding the Cosmos X staking module. But I think we're going to see much more granular types of payments because today I think most projects drastically overpay for security and also don't really get the kind of security that's actually best for their chain.
00:48:43.120 - 00:48:53.266, Speaker D: Well, I think on that part though, there's less of a premium, I think, for receiving ETH as a reward token or like stablecoin.
00:48:53.298 - 00:48:53.442, Speaker F: Right.
00:48:53.466 - 00:49:18.560, Speaker D: Because any new protocol should probably be paying a premium to node operators because they've been running infrastructure for eight years since I experienced a token going down 90% in a month. So I want to make sure that there's a lot of upside early on because I want to continue supporting this network when it's bad. So you could probably pay less for security if you're just paying them in stablecoin.
00:49:19.420 - 00:49:21.772, Speaker F: Sorry, we're over time. Can I ask one follow up on that?
00:49:21.956 - 00:49:38.720, Speaker A: I mean, there's no panels after this or speakers after this. So until Seb comes up here and kicks us off, which might happen any second. Okay, well, I think that might have just happened. I don't know if you want to go real quick. I don't know. I'm going to get slashed.
00:49:39.950 - 00:50:04.050, Speaker F: I'm just going to shoot over. That's a great point. I think people should rationally pay or want to get paid more for volatile tokens, although I feel like part of what we're seeing in current Meadow with points, for example, is that there's almost a risk, not premium risk discount for projects that you don't know the price of. But you have some chance it's going to become a next trillion dollar protocol. It seems like people are willing to take a lower expected yield for this upside. Why do you think that might be?
00:50:05.360 - 00:50:42.580, Speaker D: Well, I mean, as a staker, right, you're not really doing anything. I mean, there's opportunity costs elsewhere for potential future yield of some other thing. Infrastructure providers have hard costs, but also, I mean, when doing it figment, it's like, yeah, we want to be here first because this is where the potential upside is. And so we are going to make a bet. We are going to devote people to it, hardware, we're going to sell it to institutional audiences and things like that. So in the first year, we do expect to, like, cover costs. And a lot of, you know, large validators or even, you know, ten person, 20 person teams, they need to, you know, factor that in.
00:50:44.520 - 00:51:06.010, Speaker B: Actually, that's a concern that a lot of our projects have. Yeah. In terms of the price fluctuation, because they're like, you know, a lot of coins are stable, but they're still not stable coins. Right. And then, so how's this going to work? If we get the, it's worth ten hundred mil today, might not be worth ten hundred mil tomorrow. And then, so part of the program rules is actually for the multi asset approach. They can set that.
00:51:06.010 - 00:51:16.070, Speaker B: Okay. If this price drops, this percentage in a day or whatever, they can actually switch to another asset or completely switch to stables, for example, as a part of our approach.
00:51:16.610 - 00:51:25.250, Speaker A: Very dynamic. Okay, the end. Thank you, everybody. Good shot, Mandy.
