00:00:09.160 - 00:00:23.646, Speaker A: All right, is everyone still awake? Barely. Okay. All right, so I assume most of you know who these people are, but quick introductions.
00:00:23.838 - 00:00:38.370, Speaker B: Sure. Hey, guys, my name is Sunny, one of the co founders of osmosis. It is a Dex in the cosmos ecosystem. And I've been working in the cosmos ecosystem for the last six years doing a bunch of different things.
00:00:39.110 - 00:01:04.790, Speaker C: Hello, my name is on. Oh, there you go. Hello, everyone. I'm Mustafa. I'm one of the co founders at Celestia, which is a data availability layer that makes it possible to have to create shared security for roll ups. And one of the things we're doing as well is you have a project called Rolekit, which allows you to deploy cosmos chains as rollups on Celestia so that you can have a. So that cosmos chains can have shared security.
00:01:06.290 - 00:01:40.982, Speaker A: All right, thank you. I think this audience is pretty buildery, so I'm gonna, like, just set the stage a little bit for where we're coming from, for anyone who doesn't know, so. And then we'll get into some more juicy stuff. So, Sunny, maybe, do you want to start? You know, the original title of this was sort of app chains versus modularity, but I think there's a shift more towards mesh security modularity. Can you just spend a minute steel manning an app chain? Thesis and maybe, why did you choose to make osmosis an app chain to begin with?
00:01:41.166 - 00:02:46.050, Speaker B: Yeah, so why did we choose to make osmosis an app chain? Was we kind of realized that for the application that we wanted to build a lot of the things we needed to do, we needed to go change the core blockchain, and, like, we just wouldn't have been able to do what we wanted to. Building on a smart contracting platform, especially when you want to go do stuff around privacy or, you know, Mev resistance, and, like, these are things where, like, privacy, you need to go change the cryptography of the blockchain. I don't have the ability to do that in Ethereum without engaging in, like, multi year long EIP debates or, you know, if I want to go change how the mempool works, it's like, I can't go do that on Ethereum. While with an app chain, I can go, like, touch all of these core parts of the protocol without having to ask for permission from anyone. And I can make the blockchain. Ethereum has to be credibly neutral or any generalized l one has to be credibly neutral towards the applications built on top. Osmosis does not need to be.
00:02:46.050 - 00:03:13.278, Speaker B: It could be like, oh, we want to reserve a certain portion of our block space only for osmosis trades. We can do that. We want to be like any liquidity ad transactions have to go before any trade. So you can't, like, rug liquidity before someone's trade. We can go do that. So, you know, it was all of these sorts of things where, like, building an app chain was the way to a fully vertically integrated stack. Gives the best features and ux that.
00:03:13.294 - 00:03:43.310, Speaker A: We wanted to build makes sense in that vertically integrated stack. Obviously, you need validators. The model of validation is evolving rapidly within the cosmos ecosystem. How would you define, and looking forward to contrasting it with Celestia and roll ups and that security model. How would you describe the security model of osmosis in the context of its validator infrastructure interchange? Security? Mesh security. And how do you see that evolving?
00:03:44.180 - 00:05:02.330, Speaker B: Yeah, so osmosis started off like every typical proof of stake chain where it was using, you know, it had its own native token called Osmo, using a proof of stake system similar to every cosmos chain today. Then the next big change to osmosis security model came with this thing called superfluid staking, where we said, hey, beyond just Osmo, why can't we actually use the DeFi assets built on top of the chain, most of which are backed by Osmo, have OSmo underlying them in the DeFi protocol, in the proof of stake protocol itself. So what you could do, what we started with was LP shares. So you could say, if I have an OSMo Atom LP share, you know, that has real OSmo underlying it, I can take the LP share itself and use it in the proof of stake protocol. And, you know, the protocol is smart enough, it understands the LP shares. So it could be like, oh, yeah, this LP share, we know it's worth roughly this much Osmo, and we're going to provide this much of an additional discount risk factor on top of it. And so, yeah, that's how that came about then, you know, that was, if you think about it, superfluid staking is sort of this, like, proto version of mesh security wherever mesh security.
00:05:02.330 - 00:05:45.220, Speaker B: I assume most people here are pretty familiar with it, so I'm not going to go too much into it if I need to, let me know. But it's this idea that, hey, why can't we use other tokens as well as helping secure our chain? So things that we have these deep economic relationships with, something like Axel from the AxLR chain or Mars tokens from the Mars chain, like, you know, these are things that we are very economically interdependent on. We should allow all of them to be also used to secure osmosis. So now it's like you can use base OSMO, or you can use defi assets on the osmosis chain, or you can use staked assets on other chains, all to contribute to osmosis economic security.
00:05:46.480 - 00:05:53.180, Speaker A: All right, so here's a red one. Which, is there any world in which osmosis would be an l three?
00:05:55.850 - 00:06:01.154, Speaker B: I mean, we're not even in l two yet. So what does it mean to be an. What does it mean to be an.
00:06:01.162 - 00:06:13.550, Speaker A: L three, like an app chain on top of an l two? That gives you, you know, some degree of freedom to do, you know, design considerations like you were just describing, but not have its own validator set.
00:06:14.530 - 00:07:13.260, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think having, like, long term, we should be, like, all Cosmos SDK chains should be generating fraud or validity proofs, right? I think Rolekit is, like, actually making progress towards that. And so if the question is, like, should we be generating these fraud proofs and using them in our communications with other chains, then the answer is yes. Should we get rid of a decentralized validator set? No, because we still, our take is that, like, fraud and validity proofs gives you safety. Single sequencers still don't give you liveness guarantees or censorship resistance guarantees. And for those for liveness, you want some sort of decentralized validator set for censorship and resistance. The best solution that we know of is threshold decryption, and it's in the name. You need some threshold over which to do the decryption over.
00:07:13.260 - 00:07:19.200, Speaker B: And for that attendment, consensus protocol is a pretty good way of coordinating a threshold decryption protocol.
00:07:20.380 - 00:07:22.160, Speaker A: Any comments on that, Ms. Alfa?
00:07:22.780 - 00:08:23.440, Speaker C: Okay, so now spy turn, you know, so let me stop from, like, explaining what, what we're trying to achieve. Celestia, from the beginning. So the reason why we started Celestia is because we saw that at the cosmos vision. It's a fantastic vision of having an interchange of hundreds or potentially thousands or even millions of interconnected chains. And this was kind of like the antithesis to the original ethereum scaling, very bad, but at the time, which was just like one big chain that was sharded, whereas this cosmos was like, okay, anyone can create their own chain. But the problem that we saw with that was that, and with IBC specifically, if you imagine a world where millions of chains, which is very feasible, like, there's millions of websites, there could be millions of chains, we're very early. It's not feasible to rely on committee based assumptions for interchange bridging because you're fragmenting security across millions of chains.
00:08:23.440 - 00:09:19.340, Speaker C: Right. And it's just not a very sound security assumption. So ideally, what we want to do with rollups is replace the community basis assumption with a fraud and Aussie proofs and availability sampling. And because you no longer need crypto economic assumption or community based assumption for bridging, the roll ups can now have security without any kind of big capital upfront cost. And specifically, if those rollups all use the same data layer, they can all have a uniform level of shared security. So it's no longer like different chains have different levels of security. All the roll ups have the same level of security because they inherit consensus and data consensus and ordering from the base layer.
00:09:19.340 - 00:09:39.540, Speaker C: But that being said, I still, I also think that it's a. I think people should also be free if they create their own chains, their own validator set. I'm also not against that. And if people want to use security, they can do that. I think it makes sense for some use cases, and adding fraud proofs would make that even better.
00:09:41.000 - 00:10:05.400, Speaker A: So that makes a lot of sense. I think there's definitely room for both right now, but I think we need to get a little bit into the distinction between those things and how they might, they might conflict. First, I want to talk about, I know you announced something recently, Sunny, the collaboration between Celestia and osmosis. Do you want to say anything about that?
00:10:08.220 - 00:11:06.898, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. I mean, it's not, it's, you know, osmosis is interested in being the interchange Dex and, you know, trying to provide interchange. No part of the modular stack is that, like, not everything needs, not every chain, not every roll up needs every service on top of it. Osmosis has the most developed defi ecosystem in the cosmos ecosystem. And, like, as more and more roll ups come onto Celestia, like, you know, a lot of them focus on things like gaming, like, you know, the Argus stuff, like, you know, instead of them having to have their own Amms and Dexs, like, you know, we're working on a bunch of different toolings and things to make it so they can use osmosis as their primary trading venue while still, like, keeping their roll ups, like, focused on their use cases. And then as part of that, what we're doing is like, making sure it's very easy to bridge Tia onto the rest of these roll ups. Right.
00:11:06.898 - 00:11:52.340, Speaker B: Because they need to pay for data availability and, you know, having. I'm a strong believer in that. You need to have, like, protocol owned treasuries paying for this core infrastructure rather than allowing dev teams and foundations to do that. You had the situation on arbitrum a few months ago where, like, the dev team failed to pay the DA costs on fund, the wallet on Ethereum that paid for the DA costs, and, like, the chain came to a halt. Right? So instead you want systems where, like, oh, maybe Argus and could pay in its own native token, it will swap for TIa on osmosis and pay for the DA on Celestia. So, yeah, we're basically just building up a lot of tooling to enable, you know, the. Trading the transportation routes for TIA throughout the ecosystem.
00:11:52.880 - 00:12:34.420, Speaker A: Very cool. So I want to talk a little bit about where these sort of models conflict, right? So, and maybe under what circumstances is an honest majority of validators in your own validator set like better or worse than having a roll up and a different kind of shared set of security assumptions? So, chorus one recently put out this analysis where they showed that as validation becomes more expensive, as you secure more chains in an ICS kind of model, it might price out smaller validators or they'll cut corners and be just less good at it. You know, we end up with less security. What's your opinion on that?
00:12:35.240 - 00:13:14.434, Speaker B: So I guess, like, my general take on this whole framing of rollups or versus mesh security as well, is it's like, there are. So, like I said, roll ups provide you proofs for certain types of things, right? They can prove that, like, oh, the state transition function of your system was valid, and you can prove that to something or someone. At the end of the day, you're still, you know, most of this idea of l two s and l three s and stuff. You're. You're proving it at the end of the day to some l one, right. And at the end of the day that l one is still secured by economic security and nothing else. Right.
00:13:14.434 - 00:13:39.066, Speaker B: Ethereum. At the end of the day, its security model comes from economic security. It's not a roll up to anything else. Right. And so the goal of mesh security is how do we maximize the amount of economic security of system? So would ethereum be better off secured by just eth or secured by ETH and the entire ecosystem of app like, of defi assets built on top of it?
00:13:39.098 - 00:13:39.266, Speaker A: Right.
00:13:39.298 - 00:13:57.694, Speaker B: The same way osmosis is more secure with superfluid staking than without superfluid staking. There's other things. It doesn't only have to be for your base settlement layer. It could be for things like your oracle network, right. Like, you know, how do you generate validity zk proofs for that? An oracle is correct. No.
00:13:57.742 - 00:13:57.950, Speaker C: Right.
00:13:57.990 - 00:14:28.390, Speaker B: At the end of the day, oracle networks are secured by economic security. Would you be happier with an oracle secured only by link token, or would you be happier with an oracle network secured by link Token and aave Token and maker token and comp token, like everyone who's using something should provide security for it. And you have this more resilient, decentralized economic backing for these core parts of the protocols that can't be, you can't generate validity proofs for.
00:14:28.890 - 00:14:42.270, Speaker A: And so Mustafa, in a world where sort of celestia is at the bottom of that stack, what do you think are the forces that might act against that? That might select four roll ups instead of having that validator architecture.
00:14:43.260 - 00:15:13.550, Speaker C: Yeah, sorry, my phone jumped off the floor, but it's okay. Yeah, so I think, yeah, I think there's some important nuances like issue like base players like Celeste Gen eth, they rely on economic security for censorship resistance, but not for state validity, whereas like IBC and presumably mesh security, they rely on economic security to prevent invalid state transitions, not just for the sensitive assistance, right?
00:15:13.710 - 00:15:51.080, Speaker B: No. So mesh security, it is just a protocol for people to add slashing conditions to actions, right? So it is implemented as an interface that you can write arbitrary slasher contracts for. The initial contract that we wrote is for tendermint consensus proofs, fraud proofs, right. But we're going to write a contract for oracles, right. We'll be like, oh, here's this oracle network. And like if you provide an oracle update that's too far away from everyone else's, that is a slashing condition. So the idea of mesh security framework is just a model for adding up economic securities.
00:15:51.080 - 00:15:54.052, Speaker B: What you apply that economic security to.
00:15:54.116 - 00:16:03.462, Speaker C: Is up to, I guess, but for like the fraud proof stuff, you don't want to wait for a challenge period, right? You just want to slash.
00:16:03.606 - 00:16:44.148, Speaker B: Yeah, that's up to the chain, right? So some chains might say, oh, we want to wait a challenge fraud proof window before we accept IBC packets. Let's say two Rolekit chains, they might want to wait the fraud proof challenge window, right. For osmosis, from our product perspective, one of the things people love about us is that you can deposit assets in a matter of seconds and increasing that to minutes or hours to accommodate these challenge proof windows. It's like, yes, it is better from a security perspective, but unfortunately it just harms our product user experience that we have to weigh those things against each other.
00:16:44.244 - 00:17:39.882, Speaker C: Yeah, and that makes sense. But I will also say that you can have a significantly shorter challenge period if you make the Ford proofs distributed peer to peer and not unchained. Because the main reason why Ethereum has a long challenge period is because you have to wait for the to get on chain. Or if you use uk proofs, then you don't even need to do that. But I mean, sure, like it makes sense security as a general model to add certain extra crypto economic security for certain, for certain slashing modules or slashing conditions. I guess like just from my viewpoint, I would say like I would see, like it depends on how many chains there are within the interchange long term. But what we're trying to achieve is a kind of a scenario where someone can just like spin up a roll up chain like in 2 seconds bootstrap it without any crypto economic security.
00:17:39.882 - 00:18:00.820, Speaker C: So kind of like we want to try and create a world where deploying a roll up chain, a roll up cosmos chain, for example, is easier and more convenient in deploying a new smart contract. Like the same way that deploying a virtual machine on AWS is better and more convenient than using squarespace to launch a website, for example.
00:18:01.120 - 00:18:33.464, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, so exactly. I think that the roll up model, that makes it very good, making it as easy as possible to deploy a state machine is great, but where mesh security is coming in is like, okay, most applications have other things they need to be correct other than just the state transition function. Right. If you have a shared sequencer system or some sequencer system, you want some economic security guarantees around your censorship resistance mechanism.
00:18:33.552 - 00:19:16.950, Speaker C: So, yeah, I mean, it's definitely true that a lot of roll ups these days aren't very sensitive resistant, but it's also like some important nuances there because a lot of people think that you need a decentralized, some people think, okay, well, you're basically reinventing blockchains by having, by needing decentralized sequence set for roll ups. But there's various designs that don't really require decentralized sequencer set. For example, there's this thing called base roll ups where you're basically, there's no sequence at all. You're just using whatever you're using. However, the blocks are ordered on the base layer. So you're using the base layer for sequencing. That does leak me be to the base layer, but ultimately the ultimate goal.
00:19:16.950 - 00:19:52.682, Speaker C: Even if you have a centralized sequencer, you can still inherit security from the base layer by having a way to force inclusion of transactions. Yeah, but I'll say about that being said, I'm not against mesh security being used. I can also see models where roll ups can have decentralized sequencer set and a lot against like raw mesh security being used to add like bonding add to kind of bond to become a set sequencer in the sequencing set, especially if that roll up doesn't have a token yet.
00:19:52.826 - 00:20:52.130, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And yeah, like, you know, the force inclusion stuff I think works, it is a little bit slower, right? Like it's not, and then the base roll ups, I think so base roll ups for anyone who's not familiar is the idea that like, oh, instead of submitting transactions to the sequencer, you instead submit. You use your DA layer as your sequencer as well. So you submit transactions directly to Celestia. And the job of the sequencers or state machines is to like read the transactions from the DA layer directly and like construct the blocks on top of that, which I think works for some use cases. It's as you get more advanced in your use cases, like the kinds of stuff that we invented ABCI for, it becomes more complicated. You might want to say that, oh, here's certain types of transactions that we submitted encrypted, but our validators are using vote extensions to provide price oracle data.
00:20:52.130 - 00:21:14.200, Speaker B: But we don't want these things to be decrypted unless the, that price oracle data has come in. And so once you get into these like complex workflows, it, like, it really, the base roll, using a base roll up which is not fully programmable becomes kind of harder. And you want, at that point, you kind of just do want your own decentralized sequencer system.
00:21:14.740 - 00:21:25.856, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess like with the threshold mempool stuff, that's kind of processed resistance as well, right? Yeah, I mean, there's definitely trade offs between having either a base roll up, a centralized sequencer, or decentralized sequencer anything.
00:21:25.968 - 00:21:32.340, Speaker B: It's more about programmatic decryption where it's like, oh, I only want this decrypted in these scenarios.
00:21:32.640 - 00:21:53.388, Speaker C: Right? Yeah, I mean, there's definitely trade offs between. And like it definitely makes sense in many use cases to have a decentralized sequencer set, especially if you want like greater guarantees around, you know, the threshold decryption and also other things like more trust minimized soft finality guarantees, I think.
00:21:53.564 - 00:22:23.540, Speaker A: So let's push into that a little bit. So one of the criticisms, if you're a dev deciding how to architect your platform, one of the things you're thinking about is actually cost. There's some criticism that having your own validator set costs a lot. You have to have emissions over time, et cetera. Within the roll up model. In the modular model, it sounds like there are increasing number of things you have to pay for. You have to pay for potentially sequencing, you have to pay for Da.
00:22:23.540 - 00:22:36.340, Speaker A: You know, maybe there are other things that we don't even know about that you're going to have to pay for. As things become more modular, are there any sort of first principles arguments you can make about which one is going to be cheaper over time?
00:22:36.640 - 00:23:37.644, Speaker B: It's, I think there's like different types of costs that exist, right? Like something like da. I think there's a pretty strong argument that there's like economies of scale to it because of like how like the encoding in celestia works. Like the more data that you get, it's actually, it's better to have, there are economies of scale of having one da, like, layer that does the retailment encoding versus like many separated ones. Right. The other one though as well is like just on like engineering costs, right? Like osmosis took the, like some, some chains in cosmos decided to build their own bridges, right? Like injective has their own bridge to Ethereum or, you know, sift chain built their own bridge to Ethereum. For us, you know, we took this, we took the, take that like building bridges is hard and a lot of like, you know, from the security perspective and engineering perspective and we just don't want to do that. And we would rather work with a team to and like out and basically like outsource it to them.
00:23:37.644 - 00:23:39.916, Speaker B: Right. And so that's the other thing that you also have to think about.
00:23:39.948 - 00:23:48.388, Speaker C: Didn't you tweet once something like, as an asian, I don't like to. What was it?
00:23:48.524 - 00:23:57.880, Speaker B: This was Leland's tweet. I think he's like, yeah, something about that. It's like the entire Cosmos thesis comes down to I don't want to pay for stuff.
00:24:00.700 - 00:24:13.220, Speaker A: So in the Celestia model, do you have an opinion or is the stack itself opinionated about how those costs are structured? Have you thought about that in your design?
00:24:14.360 - 00:25:00.978, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, the way that, to use analogy, the way I would compare it is launching your own cosmos chain is like having your own physical server and buying a physical server, co locating a data center and maintaining that, whereas using rollups is kind of like just using AWS on the cloud. The server has higher upfront capital costs and you need like higher like potential labor costs. You need like someone to maintain it. Whereas like the clouds, the cloud. It might be more expensive on a, not even necessarily more expensive, but like a certain scale. If you're, if you're like a big corporation, it might be more expensive, but like for most people it's cheaper. And also there's less upfront cost.
00:25:00.978 - 00:25:18.390, Speaker C: You're just paying pay as you go. So that's kind of the way I would compare it there. But from a searcher's perspective, all you have to pay for is the data, and that's pretty much it. You're paying per byte. It's pay as you go.
00:25:19.210 - 00:25:55.572, Speaker A: Makes sense. So I guess, Mustafa, can you say a little bit about the validator architecture? That's the celestia has chosen. Right. And I'm trying to relate this back to what we were talking about before in sort of chorus one's analysis of the more things that you're validating, the higher the cost and that potentially being a centralizing force. So say I'm a validator on Celestia and say I've already developed this specialized infrastructure to provide DA, right. That's optimized for that. Maybe I also provide Eigen da.
00:25:55.572 - 00:26:06.322, Speaker A: Maybe I do, you know, polygons, da, et cetera. Are you concerned at all about that becoming a centralizing force in validator architecture? And how have you thought about that?
00:26:06.506 - 00:26:52.540, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, centralization in block production and validate infrastructure is kind of like a huge general problem in blockchains. I don't really know if anyone's truly like, really managed to solve it on a long term perspective, you know, like liquid state. Like. To me, proof of stake is basically flawed due to liquid staking, at least the current iterations of proof of stake. Liquid staking kind of creates natural monopolies. But the way I see it is that the end game is like, we want to try to create systems where the end user can verify the correctness of the chain, even if block production is centralized. But using proof based systems like Ford proofs and have like ZK proofs, you don't have to trust the validator.
00:26:54.320 - 00:26:54.608, Speaker A: For.
00:26:54.624 - 00:27:14.540, Speaker C: The correctness of the state validity of the chain. In some cases, you might have to trust them for censorship resistance. But there's various ways of trying to increase sensitive resistance in the presence of a centralized validator set. Things like proposal block separation auction models, and also threshold mempool encryption.
00:27:15.090 - 00:27:25.150, Speaker A: All right, you got 90 seconds each. What's your most outrageous prediction for how blockchain architecture is going to change in the next two years?
00:27:26.290 - 00:27:40.150, Speaker C: I mean, I hope this isn't outrageous because this is nebula summit. But I think there's going to be millions of chains in a few years time. We want to make deploying app chains easier than deploying a smart contract.
00:27:41.940 - 00:27:42.800, Speaker A: Sonny.
00:27:46.260 - 00:27:48.880, Speaker B: Is this something I think will happen or what I want to happen.
00:27:50.340 - 00:27:54.240, Speaker A: Either one, but whatever would be most exciting.
00:27:55.420 - 00:28:32.372, Speaker B: I think we move away from proof of stake entirely, and we move towards new sorts of civil resistance systems. I'm a big fan of reputation, like web of trust consensus protocols. And, you know, I think proof of stake had a lot of superiorities over proof of work, which is why I spent years working on it. But, you know, I think I. It has flaws, and I think that there is a world where we can build better things than proof of stake. And so I'd like to. I would hope that, like, five years from now that our primary blockchains are not running on proof of stake, but are rather running on these.
00:28:32.372 - 00:28:34.866, Speaker B: I like web of trust based consensus protocols.
00:28:35.018 - 00:28:36.938, Speaker A: Do you think about, like, proof of.
00:28:36.954 - 00:28:41.950, Speaker C: Personhood using wealth coin, proof of orb? Maybe that's.
00:28:42.330 - 00:28:53.218, Speaker B: I guess, like, what I'm looking for is something that, like, decentralized identity systems that, you know, not using worldcoin, but, like, using a web of trust to get some sort of pseudo identity system.
00:28:53.314 - 00:29:00.352, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess there's some sort of proof of personhood or proof of some type of proof of resistance mechanism in some way.
00:29:00.496 - 00:29:02.660, Speaker A: Do you think we ever connect back to bitcoin?
00:29:03.120 - 00:29:15.700, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. I mean, this is why Babylon exists, right? Like, I think. I think that, you know, another hot take, which I think is probably true, is a lot of cosmos ecosystem chains are going to be secured by bitcoin restaking.
00:29:16.840 - 00:29:19.912, Speaker A: Cool. All right, super interesting, guys. Thank you very much.
00:29:20.096 - 00:29:20.480, Speaker C: Thank you.
