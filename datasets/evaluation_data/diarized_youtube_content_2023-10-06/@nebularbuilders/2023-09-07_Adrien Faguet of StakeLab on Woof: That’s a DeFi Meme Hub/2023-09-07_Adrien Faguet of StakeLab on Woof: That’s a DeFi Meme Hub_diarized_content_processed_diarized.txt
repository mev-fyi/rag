00:00:09.320 - 00:00:12.330, Speaker A: Woof woof woof woof woof.
00:00:14.550 - 00:00:15.370, Speaker B: Woof.
00:00:18.510 - 00:03:52.610, Speaker A: Okay. Woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woo woo woof woof woof. And woof.

00:04:01.590 - 00:04:19.190, Speaker B: So, okay, it was the first presentation, and now I'm gonna say it, like, in the real way. So, yeah, it was longer. I was, like, kind of dying. So, yeah, the idea is to create, like, a digi narrative. Like, I say, we don't care. We just, like, make some fun. I can just, like, say anything with Wolfenhe.
00:04:19.190 - 00:04:51.698, Speaker B: Pretty fun. So I guess, like, this is, like, very important. Like, because in any ecosystem, the thing is like to create a narrative and sometimes people will like it or they won't like it. So I want to create like the DJ narrative. Like it's people that just want to have fun in anything and buy this, I guess, like as you can see with dogecoin, you can see with Shiba Pep or whatever with wow. I guess the idea is like at first meme were created because of community. You can even see it.
00:04:51.698 - 00:05:13.448, Speaker B: Like Pepe just launched quite recently. It went like, I guess like a billion dollar market cap. I guess now it's around 600 million. But the idea is it's all about community. We are just rented by a mem or something like that. So with wow, we are just woofing around. We are just making woof and that's pretty cool.
00:05:13.448 - 00:06:02.876, Speaker B: We don't need much. So yeah, there was like this kind of like photo like from the aquasm that was like last week. So it's all about the community. Like there was nobody, there is no costume, there is nothing. So it's just like people can just like go like literally like where we are and just like use our branding. They can just like have fun, they can meet people and they can just even represent brand because who care? Like it's, it's all about like the community and that's the most important, I guess, in any project. Well, yeah, there was like this slide with fun because, yeah, I pretty think that it's important when we are doing, I guess like complex stuff and just like have fun with it because there is a lot of people that will just basically just look at you and say, okay, that's pretty cool, but I don't understand anything.
00:06:02.876 - 00:06:54.816, Speaker B: But if you make some fun of it, then it's going to be more easy to understand. Basically it's at school when you are very young, we use pretty much games to make you understand anything. And I think games are just the way that we can abstract the complexity because if you check, for example, always made like dogecoin, it use a fork of lycoin and then a fork of lucky coin. So the idea is just like, you have the bitcoin technology, which is like very complex. It's kind of a bunch of nerds that just play cryptographic stuff and mathematical stuff and who's going to just like understand what bitcoin is or even get some attention from that. Then you create just a mem coin, let's say dogecoin. And people are like, oh, well, it's so fun.
00:06:54.816 - 00:07:26.616, Speaker B: Like look at the mem and then oh, but where it comes from, like, what's the technology used, Beverly? Like, behind of this. And then they get attention of it and basically you get like exposure. And that's why probably bitcoin is what it is right now. It's because. Yeah, there is like something and meme coins. This is, yeah, I use like this thing like with Picasso if you didn't see, it's from Polkadot. And they make like the first integration with IBC outside of Cosmos.
00:07:26.616 - 00:07:51.280, Speaker B: And they use like a pica token for Picaso. And basically their first transaction was made on Chihuahua chain. So I'm pretty proud of it. And we didn't spoke with them. They just like make it because I guess, like they just like, understand like the narrative of just like the fun and. Okay, so I'm glad to test on it on Mainnet because we don't have testnets. We don't care.
00:07:51.280 - 00:08:21.990, Speaker B: Basically, it's like, who cares? Like, just test in Mainnet and if it works, it works. Then sometimes you test in. Test. It works and then you test in Mainnet and it doesn't so well, so they made it and basically it works. So this is for me, like the translate the complexity into like something like more simple. Shiwa chain is literally like a place to build. So we already have like a metaverse that you already see the video before.
00:08:21.990 - 00:08:42.890, Speaker B: So it's built like by the passage team. We spoke like a lot with them. They were like pretty inspired, like, by the way. Inspired. You can say you have a meme coin and you're like, inspired. No, no, literally. And they understood the way that making fun, it's very important.
00:08:42.890 - 00:09:20.282, Speaker B: And as they are like, like building on top of cosmos but not launched yet, they did try lunch and not. They, they have like stopped because they, they wanted, like more fun to build their own game, which is like strange clan. You probably like heard of it. And they have like lot of partnership. And the idea is like create like a social hub for gaming and just like for people in Cosmos. So they created like the wavers that you saw the video, like right here. And I'm going to be able to explain with the video right now, not before, but basically you will have your little wawa.
00:09:20.282 - 00:10:04.178, Speaker B: You will be able to just have an open world, just get around with your friend and just play minigames. So there will be three minigames, the Wawa race. There will be the Tai Chihuahua, which is just fighting. And you will have kind of like a Pac Mandev, kind of. So you will collect like your little streets and that's it. I guess like it's gonna be like a pretty fun way to battle around like you see like probably at Osmocon in Cosmos we are making like stuff like people are fighting in a real boxing ring but probably they will be able like to do it like in a stream, live stream on Twitch. And we could make like the battle of Cosmos founder literally like on the.
00:10:04.178 - 00:10:37.378, Speaker B: The hide is just like I guess like gaming is pretty cool like to just like change their mind. People are like working a lot so it's pretty cool for them just like to get abstract of it also NFT. So basically for example as the wild verse, you will need a little NFT here. It's like the metawawa. If you have meta war, it's like kind of like a passport, passport to the, to the metaverse. So if you have one you will be able to connect. If you don't have then you're not gonna be able to just like play the game.
00:10:37.378 - 00:11:17.490, Speaker B: It's basically like kind of a game. If you don't buy the game you cannot play it. I really think like the NFT have like something like around that and we should play more with that. So yeah it's a little example but it's a pretty nice way I guess to make understand game like for example gaming platform like let's say like Steam. They could also integrate nfts and people will just not share games or share accounts because you won't share your account if there is money on it. It's not the same. So yeah, it's a first step as it's only community building.
00:11:17.490 - 00:11:42.182, Speaker B: There is like I said, no funders. It's just people that made it and yeah, three people like the tools of people. I don't even know them. So the idea was just like to make a platform and people just enjoy somebody just create the wawa punks. I wasn't even involved in this. So it's basically just like ten k of nfts. Everything is mint, there is no wire at you.
00:11:42.182 - 00:12:07.396, Speaker B: Not everything. The goal is just to burn the WWA. Everything we made from the sale of it. It's just like we burned them. The other idea is basically to share the technology like everywhere. So they just like launch one k in stargaze one k for example in territory I guess there will be more like passage gotta also want. There is like set mantle, there is Omniflix.
00:12:07.396 - 00:12:35.252, Speaker B: So the idea just like to expand like the. Wow, just for the culture because I guess also like meme coins are for the culture and the branding there is also like for example, like the emporium that is built on the top of Shiva chin. Yeah, the design is horrible, I guess, but that's not the idea. The idea is just like basically you can understand like what the tech is. So you can literally build smart contract and anything you want. On top of Shiwa chain, they made like a little thing. It's just like a minter.
00:12:35.252 - 00:12:57.200, Speaker B: So you can just set up like whatever you want, like the rarity or anything. You can just like set up like the, the fees you want. If you want to pay, like in Atom, in Huawei or whatever, you can just put your collection, name, your branding, whatever. So it's pretty simple. The docs are pretty cool and you can just meet your first NFT on an NFT marketplace that nobody cares. But it's fun. You can test it.
00:12:57.200 - 00:13:30.340, Speaker B: That's literally their hide. It's also a place to build defi. So one of the main people that used to work with us is white whale. We never spoke with them and they just integrate us and then we started working with them. So whitewave is just kind of like a hub, like in the ecosystem. So they build on top of each chain, they have their own chain, megaloc chain, and they have their own token, like the whale token. The idea is just to incentivize stuff and build defi.
00:13:30.340 - 00:14:06.494, Speaker B: So on top of chiwa chain, they build kind of like this aem and something we really like. Not excluding the highlights that they have, they build this incentivization model. That is pretty cool. So it's kind of like the same thing as osmosis, but literally more simple. In osmosis you need to create gouge and to make this, you need to use Cli. So it's a bit more complex, I guess for pretty much anyone that just want to launch token. So here you can just incentivize using like any token you have on your wallet.
00:14:06.494 - 00:14:31.530, Speaker B: So if you are just a whale and have fun and just like distribute token, then you can, or you can just like build your own token like with a mint, it's pretty easy. And then just like incentivize any pool. Pretty cool. So then people know you. We also have like some LSD token. There are less known that tried the big brand. You like Quicksilver? No, we prefer to work like with.
00:14:31.530 - 00:14:51.512, Speaker B: Yeah, we didn't work with them. They build on top of us. So Aries protocol. Yeah, they're pretty cool guys that are making like LSD staking like around cosmos. They are very good and there is also staffy hub. I guess they have to, they wanted to make a proposal to connect with the hub too. So there will be like a second one connected to the hub.
00:14:51.512 - 00:15:27.486, Speaker B: Not sure it's going to pass but you can still have LSD for World War Two there. And we have some secret project that we spoke a bit like since, since long. So yeah, the world was swapped. So the idea is just like not as like a white whale because white whale is like creating stuff like around the ecosystem but not only in one. We wanted to just like build a strong aam on top of shiwi chain. Just like to really make some very fun cool things. Yeah, so this is just like some little design that we, that we made.
00:15:27.486 - 00:16:00.020, Speaker B: And basically you will be able to have anything that you want. You will be able to have your token, you will be able like to mint new token. The pool. The NFTs connect directly to the wireless because the wireless is literally can be included like in a screen. So you will have like basically everything. And at the end I was like supposed to speak with few things meta decided just like to put some woof. And to conclude this, I guess that I have like five little minutes probably I have a first.
00:16:00.020 - 00:16:23.616, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess it's working. The first shot of the wawa verse. Look at that. So I have my little wawa, I can just like go everywhere that I want. And yeah, it's not working pretty well. So like I cannot enter this world. For example, I don't even understand like but look at this.
00:16:23.616 - 00:16:43.048, Speaker B: It's fun. No, no, it's literally at the beginning. So you can just like change diffusing like for example, let's say like some corals. Okay, I'm gonna put like some. Oh, look at this. It just changed. So yeah, I guess it's like even like just alpha testing.
00:16:43.048 - 00:17:07.810, Speaker B: We have like a bunch of people that are in it to resolve some bug and the idea at the end is like everyone will be able to connect there and just have fun. So yep, that's the first shot and I guess that's it for me. Open question. Nope, thanks.
