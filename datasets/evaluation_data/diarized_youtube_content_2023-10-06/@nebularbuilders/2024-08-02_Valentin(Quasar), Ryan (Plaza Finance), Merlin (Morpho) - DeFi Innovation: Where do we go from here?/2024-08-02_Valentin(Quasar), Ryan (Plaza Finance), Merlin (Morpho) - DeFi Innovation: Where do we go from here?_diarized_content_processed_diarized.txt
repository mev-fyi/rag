00:00:00.200 - 00:00:12.170, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. Does the mic work? Yes. So, guys, just come here. It's the last day of the panel. We're 6th day of the ECC.
00:00:22.750 - 00:00:24.330, Speaker B: I think it's better this way.
00:00:25.110 - 00:00:52.840, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you all for coming here. You are the ultimate survivors of the ECC week. So thank you for being here, thank you for supporting this panel, and thank you for being at Nebula. So, my name is Artem. I'm the co founder of french media, which is called Oak Invest, and I will be moderating the panel, where in 30 minutes, we have to find the answer to the future of Defi. So could you guys please introduce each other? And then we'll dive right in.
00:00:52.840 - 00:00:54.156, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll start with you.
00:00:54.228 - 00:01:26.450, Speaker C: All right. So I'm Merlin, co founder of Molfo. So what we're doing at Molfo is like, we've built lending protocols for the past few years. In total, we have, like, 3 billion of deposits. We are live on Ethereum and Bayes. And the lending protocol, the latest one that we release, is the landing primitive, on which, like, anyone can create any market. It's fully permissionless, with any ERC 20 as collateral loan assets, any oracle.
00:01:26.450 - 00:01:33.050, Speaker C: It's very flexible, and markets are isolated. That's it in a few lines.
00:01:33.630 - 00:01:52.810, Speaker B: Cool. Hi, everyone. Thanks for coming. I'm Ryan, co founder of Plaza Finance. We build more sustainable and composable financial products, things like bonds backed by BTC, ETH, Sol, Adam, Tia, that pay a coupon in USDC, and things like liquidation free leverage.
00:01:54.270 - 00:02:15.980, Speaker D: Hi, everyone. My name is Valeo from Quasar. Some of you might use our vault on osmosis. A month ago, we announced a new primitive called a layered staked asset, which on the front end is an aggregator for a user to essentially have single asset exposure like ETH or BTC, in the future. And on the backend, it's essentially an automation layer for generating yield on different yield destinations.
00:02:16.680 - 00:02:42.640, Speaker A: Thank you, guys. As we've seen, we are at the Cosmos conference. So let's start right in by talking about interoperability. So, interoperability has always been a huge issue in the crypto ecosystem. We have many chains, l one s, l two s. We have many protocols which are based on various chains. And so we have all this fragmentation of liquidity, various interest rates that go from one chain to another.
00:02:42.640 - 00:02:59.820, Speaker A: And basically, users hop from one chain to a new chain that just launched and had, like, 2000% API. So how do you see this evolving in the future? Do you think that we have some solutions coming in to aggregate the whole thing? To be chain agnostic, maybe.
00:03:03.290 - 00:03:36.956, Speaker D: I can take it. Yeah. So coming from Cosmos, I think the entire ecosystem knew from a very, very early start that we need a kind of generalized bridging layer that can somewhat become a standard across the interchain, similar to what TCP IP did in the Internet age. We obviously think it's IBC. I think IBC has a very good chance of being dead because it's on a consensus layer. Generally, the biggest shortfall for IBC was that it was basically only cosmos enabled. But I think we've seen the last few months and years, multiple teams working on expanding it across multiple ecosystems.
00:03:36.956 - 00:04:24.578, Speaker D: I think protocols coming from Ethereum might not really think about that as being something important because they just have so much access to liquidity in a single destination. But I think if we want to talk about innovation defi, and we want to make sure that generally people can benefit from our space, a gas fee spike to dollar 200 for a transfer may not be that future. So I think creating a generalized interface where you have fungibility of the assets is going to be like paramount. And I think IBC is going to be the leading case for that. Now. I think there's a case we made, and I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this, where we may not even want people to actually ever know that IBC exists or even use it manually. I think IBC should be something that smart contracts interact with, but people actually never touched.
00:04:24.578 - 00:04:56.200, Speaker D: I think similarly to how no one cares if the website they're visiting is hosted by Azure or by AWS or Google Cloud in the future. Not going to care if the chain is arbitrary, ethereum, or some Cosmos l one, as long as what they receive from it is what they were looking for, which is generally only yield. So we need to make IBC something that smart contracts can interact with. I think the interchange and multichain debate will always exist in our bubble of enthusiasts for years to come because we work in industry, but I think it's going to fade away from public discourse for every month to come.
00:04:57.940 - 00:06:25.772, Speaker B: I agree with a lot of those takes. Maybe a spicy take for the cosmos community is I think a lot of defi platforms probably don't need to care about interoperability. If you look at who your users are, who you're building for, and you see that they're all in one ecosystem, I think you should focus on getting fast execution, atomic composability, all those things within a single ecosystem, and you don't really have to worry about interoperability across ecosystems the other side, which is maybe the more cosmos side, is that interoperability is key to connecting ecosystems, building a more sustainable financial system. So we're quite focused on it because we like the idea of being able to move your tokens freely across chains despite ecosystems, we think like, ecosystem maximalism is probably a net bad thing for the crypto ecosystem. So what we're extremely focused and how we enable interoperability is one integrating with wallets across ecosystems. So being able to use your kepler wallet to sign transactions, but also your metamask wallet if you're coming from ethereum, or your phantom wallet if you're coming from Solana, I think that's really key. So that takes some innovation at the chain level, but also takes some innovation on the front end and then implementing the fastest bridges between ecosystems to make sure that you have the hookups to be able to move freely between these different ecosystems.
00:06:25.772 - 00:06:50.460, Speaker B: I think all of these are table stakes, but at the end of the day, what you need to do is build products that appeal to users across different ecosystems. So not just cosmos focused products, but products that, like ETH users are really excited to use, and Solana users are really excited to use. If you're going to be a platform that's trying to be cross chain and interoperable between the different chains.
00:06:50.880 - 00:07:44.294, Speaker C: So we're more on the Ethereum ecosystem. So we'll have, as I said, on Ethereum and base, we just deployed like three weeks ago, something like that. So it's true that on Ethereum there's a lot of liquidity. You don't really have that problem. But I think it will come at some point, because if you want to move from Ethereum to l two or from, let's say optimism to base or something like that, it's very cumbersome for users to migrate their position, etcetera. And you have problems of asynchronicity, or the bridge is taking too long as like your learning protocol, we think maybe in two, three, four years. Like something that would be cool is like you have some collateral on one chain and you can borrow on another chain, something like that.
00:07:44.294 - 00:08:33.840, Speaker C: Right now you can't do it because there's no playbook ready for that. There are some technical solutions that are being created right now, but there's no, like, large protocols projects that are using it live and like, in a meaningful way, scalable way. So that, like, the UX for users is like, perfect. And when I mean perfect, it's like they don't know about it. Like what you say like you don't, you don't know that your this website is running on AWS. Like you don't know that you don't need to care about like what os you are using for your computer to access YouTube. This should be the same for l two s and intervality between those chains and we are not there yet for sure.
00:08:34.340 - 00:08:35.772, Speaker D: Can I attach to something, Ryan?
00:08:35.836 - 00:08:36.372, Speaker A: Yeah, go for it.
00:08:36.396 - 00:09:11.906, Speaker D: I like that you already did. Spicy take. I think we need this in the day. I do think that DeFi protocols need to care about interoperability simply because we are already experiencing fragmentation even across ecosystem space in which bridge protocols generally use or support. So even if you go from eth to different l two s, you can have different denominations and different canonical and non canonical ETH versions based on which bridge you use. And I think that is already a ridiculous kind of statement to make for an end user because they try to explain to him that, oh, sorry, the infrastructure doesn't support this. Like your Eth is not the right version of Eth.
00:09:11.906 - 00:09:50.152, Speaker D: And then you come to a complete problem of liquidity management and then you introduce market makers which are centralized to solve it. And then we create this completely weird fragmented situation where it's hard to debate that that is better than tradfi at that stage. So I think it is hard to say to bridging protocols, especially if there are stakeholders, NPC's and tokens. One of you kind of has to win. But I think IBC makes a good case for not having a token generally, because there's no one that is playing you by telling you to adopt it, but at the same time saying this, there will be kind of middlemen that are bringing IBC to our ecosystem. So we will face that issue inevitably. We have to see how it plays out.
00:09:50.152 - 00:09:57.928, Speaker D: But I think that, yeah, fragmentation is not just a singular ecosystem problem, it's also already bleeding between different ecosystems and how they're connected.
00:09:58.104 - 00:10:17.584, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a discussion we had during ECC with some guys. And the problem is that you have VC money everywhere, so everyone wants to win, everyone wants their protocol to be successful. So at some point you have to come together and try to build something for the end user and not for the guys that hold tokens of the protocol or of the blockchain.
00:10:17.752 - 00:10:53.762, Speaker D: I would say the red pill here is that this is a very efficient, capitalistic system. It's good that every VC is super hard backing their project so that you just have a very kind of rapid fire, fast rundown version to get to the goal. Instead of a lot of not taking it serious and taking too long. So I think in a rapid iteration ecosystem that we are, this is actually good. But, yes, you have a lot of competition on the same layers, which makes fragmentation worse, which is very good for people like us that understand defi can benefit from it. I mean, there's, like, a gazillion arbitrage opportunities at any moment. It's just not what gets us the innovation that we want for the mainstream adoption.
00:10:53.826 - 00:11:56.822, Speaker B: Yeah, I really like IBC. I think it's great. But I think it's unrealistic to think that other ecosystems outside of cosmos will fully adopt IBC as the canonical form of interoperability between their chains and cosmos chains. Like, there are some really innovative, fast bridges that are coming to market soon that are not doing IBC. If our goal is to aggregate liquidity in cosmos, we should implement these bridges to make sure that as frictionlessly as possible, and in a beautiful ux, you can have instant bridging between Ethereum, Solana, and Cosmos. That leads to the problem that Valeo mentioned, where you have kind of different representations of the same asset on a single chain, and that's another version of liquidity fragmentation. I think the way you can implement all these great new innovations in bridging without fragmenting liquidity is doing something like the osmosis alloyed asset model, where you basically have one pool of similar assets.
00:11:56.822 - 00:12:49.200, Speaker B: Maybe they're bridged from different ecosystems. For example, arbitrum's representation of ETH, mainnet, representation of ETH optimism, representation of EthAn. You treat them as one shared pool of ETH, so that you have this shared pool of liquidity of all ETH, and then on the protocol level, you kind of rebalance them based on your views of the different security properties of each to get to this one pool, and a cosmos chain that users can use via IBC in a way that's unified liquidity on that single underlying asset. I think, at the end of the day, users don't want to have to think about the fact that arbitrum ETH, when you bridge it over to Cosmos, is different from Mainnet ETH. They just want to use ETH on Cosmos and get that exposure and be able to use that asset. And I think that osmosis alloyed solution is quite interesting and something we're looking at implementing at plaza.
00:12:49.540 - 00:13:54.000, Speaker A: Okay, perfect. And so the panel's name is, where do we go from here? And so, to know where we are going, we have to look back. If we look back a year from now, and a few months ago, there was this huge problem in the ecosystem that there was a cascading liquidations happening all over the place because of the loans that the founder of curve, Michael Yugorov, has taken from multiple DeFi protocols, where basically he put up collateral and CRv. At some point it was worth billions. But then the bear market and like the seven pressure, and it all went down. And basically some protocols found themselves with bad debt and some people couldn't withdraw their USDC. So what can we learn from this? So I think the question is, right, who is responsible for the whole thing? Are these the protocols that allow this to happen? Is it the founder himself? Is it the users who decided to use these protocols that allow this type of stuff? So I guess that's the question that I have for you.
00:13:54.500 - 00:14:43.700, Speaker C: Right? So on that side, I think it's first like a design. I mean, how are these designs? Like, you have all those assets that are pulled together in one protocol and market are not isolated. It is kind of a one size fits all model where you have like one risk profile that is targeted. You have like hundreds of risk parameters that are updated by token holders. And this creates kind of like problems, because if I remember where like Gauntlet. So one of the risk manager at the time proposed like to reduce the LTV. So basically the capacity to borrow against one asset to reduce that to zero.
00:14:44.600 - 00:14:46.024, Speaker A: So this was one year ago, I.
00:14:46.032 - 00:15:18.946, Speaker C: Think, and I think like token holders, which are not risk managers, decided, no, we don't want that. And of course, like, as a token holder, I'd like to borrow as much as possible. But from like a risk management perspective, it does not make sense. So, and so that's one thing. And the second thing, as I say, is like, you exposed to every asset. So as a pure USDC lender, maybe I'm like a very risk averse, you're still exposed to every asset that are listed. So it could be ex sushi, but it could be like CRV as well.
00:15:18.946 - 00:16:38.680, Speaker C: And so if there's some bad debt because of like very large borrowers that did not repay his debt in time, then you were exposed to that bad debt. And so to me, it's mostly like the Ave's design and the thing that, how risk management is built into that protocol is not correct. And our approach at Mofo is like you have those isolated markets, so you are really exposed to one pair and that's it. And the risk management is not enshrined at the protocol level. It's a layer on top where you have risk creator that can manage vault and deploy capital of the users into like the relevant market. And so you can, one risk creator could have like a USDC vote that is really risk averse, depositing money on blue chip, and one that is like very degen depositing market, sorry, funds into like a very risky market. And this way you kind of isolated, isolate the risk, and you then don't end up, like in a situation where all users are exposed to just one large player that kind of did something wrong.
00:16:41.500 - 00:17:49.476, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so. One, I think founders should be more community aligned. I like curve as an ecosystem, but I don't think this was a good thing for the founder to do. I think on top of that, this was kind of a Defi noob error. Like, if you look at how borrowing against shares works in traditional finance, founders can generally borrow significantly less against their shares than other parties, specifically because they typically own a large percentage of the float relative to the spot liquidity. So banks who underwrite each individual loan, like on a case by case basis, will advance a lot less to a founder. So I think in protocol, something we need to consider is like the Max LTV of a borrow should be, one, you should look at like, that individual borrow size relative to both the spot liquidity and the lending market to make sure that you don't get a situation where there's a significant risk from a single loan.
00:17:49.476 - 00:18:46.200, Speaker B: And two, I think that should dynamically adjust based on the spot liquidity and the liquidity of the loan. So these are things that maybe the Defi ecosystem didn't think about too hard until we saw this issue. On top of that, I generally think that when you have these lending and borrowing protocols and you're doing a position of size, there should be kind of more checks on what is actually happening, like why this person is doing this transaction. I'm not sure if that moves to some version of wallet check history or things like that, some identity on chain, but I think that would prevent a lot of these bad actor problems.
00:18:47.020 - 00:19:25.512, Speaker A: On the other hand, you kind of go. So just to answer to what you said, you kind of go back to the traditional model where it's not permissionless anymore. It's basically you have to set a set of parameters of who can interact with your protocol, who cannot. This guy can do this and this guy cannot. So I think if we want to stay in the permissionless way, you have to consider the risk parameters and then set it up for your protocol. But if you go in a case by case basis, we just go back to the tratfi where you have to have a set of criteria in order to be able to do something.
00:19:25.696 - 00:19:57.314, Speaker B: By no means am I suggesting we go back to tradfi. I think the permissionless model works if you consider all the edge cases. I think when it comes to founders that hold a large percentage of percentage of the float. I think things like in protocol checks, like maybe you have, it's permissionless, unless you're doing a trade for you're a top five holder of assets or something like that, built in protocol, it's still permissionless, but maybe there needs to be governance on opening a position of that size, something like that.
00:19:57.442 - 00:20:28.220, Speaker A: Then on the other hand, you don't want the founder to dump the tokens, basically because this meme who sold a most of the time it's the founders team. So I think you have like this, in French we say la peste le colera. So it's basically you have to choose between the two evils where you either have to see the team sell in order to fund their operations, whatever, or take a loan against the collateral which has resulted in basically him selling today.
00:20:28.800 - 00:20:34.136, Speaker B: I think it really shows you where you thought the value of those tokens was spicy.
00:20:34.168 - 00:21:10.660, Speaker D: Again, I think. I mean, I think both things you guys said are completely correct. Like, I think not having all the collateral in one pool is a very smart idea and I think having lower limits on how much you can borrow as a founder as well. But I think that on a kind of. On a higher level, what we just have to acknowledge is that this is a very young space and it's very weird. This hasn't happened before in any industry that you have essentially public companies from the get go. Usually you have a very long private period, but in crypto, essentially second tokens out, you're essentially somewhat mini IPO'd.
00:21:10.660 - 00:21:47.710, Speaker D: So we have a situation where, yes, DeFi is incredibly mature in complexity, but it's very immature in experience about that complexity and kind of ability to really reflect back. And so the responsibility, it's hard to point who's at fault to your question. I think it's a mix of things, but I think the main thing to acknowledge is just that this is a very young industry and it is crazy to IPo projects from the get go, and you will run into super weird situations with that. And this is just something where everybody needs to be careful with leverage and with borrowing.
00:21:48.250 - 00:22:05.042, Speaker A: But yeah, I think crypto has been quite a thing because it's hard to create a profitable protocol from the get go. I think the easy solution is just to create a token or to allow people to invest in this token and then sell it to them. So just to get like the initial capital to run the whole thing.
00:22:05.106 - 00:22:24.256, Speaker D: We're basically an industry of Ubers. Like Uber has been unprofitable for 15 years and now just made like its first profit. But its stock has been, I mean, considering where investors entered and also public investors quite up. Like we are just an industry of Ubers that needs to. We are. We're going to keep spending on incentives and growth for years to come. I think it's completely fine.
00:22:24.256 - 00:22:35.168, Speaker D: That's just what you have to do to jumpstart. But yeah, that is something we need to acknowledge. The protocols that are actually profitable on all metrics. If you combine all expenses and all revenues is five.
00:22:35.304 - 00:22:38.660, Speaker A: Yeah, all the OG ones as well.
00:22:40.040 - 00:23:16.240, Speaker C: Just wanted to say something. You said that we could have rules in the protocol. I don't think so. Because first management is completely dynamic, is something that is always moving. So unless you have like upgradable contracts, which might be the solution you were thinking about. We don't think like risk management enshrine at the protocol level is possible. And this should be externalized to like some entities that are off chain and that to the risk management.
00:23:16.240 - 00:23:21.410, Speaker C: Just wanted to say. Say that if you want immutable protocols.
00:23:22.470 - 00:23:37.810, Speaker B: I think you can do it at the protocol level. In the smart contract level, if you just say like top five holders like need to go through a governance proposal to open a large position with all of their assets. I don't think you need to do that off chain.
00:23:38.150 - 00:23:46.878, Speaker C: Yeah, but what if like you need to have like dozens of other rules. I'm not sure it scales well, you.
00:23:46.894 - 00:23:52.726, Speaker A: Can just throw it on some other wallets if you want to and then basically take multiple positions.
00:23:52.798 - 00:23:53.294, Speaker C: Totally.
00:23:53.382 - 00:24:14.714, Speaker A: Okay, so we have two minutes left. If we are late, I think Nina will try to harm me. So what we really should care about, right, it's the end user, it's the small guy that wants to use crypto, that wants to use attack. Right. And so from here on, what do you think is the largest issue and how can we try and resolve it, in your opinion?
00:24:14.802 - 00:24:57.872, Speaker B: Obviously, I can start with this one. I think one of the biggest issues in DeFi in general is that we have a tendency because the types of people who are building in this space right now are really excited technophiles that we build for what's possible and not actually what users want. I think we got started because we saw some like Defi products like perps had great product market fit, but were maybe not sustainable for users. It's very easy to get liquidated. You have wrong way convexity. So we wanted to build a more sustainable leveraged product. On the flip side, we also saw that like lending markets were generally not composable.
00:24:57.872 - 00:25:54.950, Speaker B: You didn't get a liquid token for entering like a lending position. So we wanted to create a bond to, and specifically one that pays a coupon in USDC because we felt like one that's easier to comp to yields in traditional finance. So both of our products were birthed out of seeing some problems that existed and not building for what's necessarily like, oh, we can build this, so we're going to build this, but targeting very specific issues. I think a lot of protocols fail to kind of get a significant user base because they're like, oh, we could do this cool thing and like some vault strategy, but users don't actually care. So I think for us as an industry, I think we should be much more focused on delivering great sustainable products for users rather than introducing new products that are cool for hedge funds who maybe will trade it in small size or cool because you can make it exist but no one actually wants to use it.
00:25:57.250 - 00:26:28.898, Speaker D: Yeah, I think you're completely right. I think there's a lot of complex products and we're going to keep building complex products for a niche group of people. But I think that what we agreed on on the smart contract, on the interability layer that, you know, people maybe shouldn't actually use the bridges themselves. I think we're going to move to a future where smart contracts are also going to use these complicated Defi primitives down the line. I mean, that's how we've designed the layered, staked assets. I think the future to really get everyone into DeFi is to. To just make the user experience as unbelievably simple as possible.
00:26:28.898 - 00:26:58.848, Speaker D: Like it needs to be Robinhood style, just click it and buy it. Like Coinbase, basically. But if you think about user experience, we have user experience. Product market fit on sexes from the user perspective, for sure. I mean, millions of users across the world, binance and Coinbase is known by everybody. How do we convert that into people that actually also benefit from Defi? Because I consider Defi to be the core of our industry. If you look at the liquidity distribution, it is not staking is and holding the assets is.
00:26:58.848 - 00:27:33.670, Speaker D: I think that's a shift that we're going to need to bridge. We need to have more liquidity in DeFi, because that's where you can actually participate in the economy of Defi, of crypto, that is, and not just hold the assets passively. And so when I look at that from our perspective, I think you need to create smart context that can interact with these super complicated primitives and wrap those into an aggregation layer so that the user just clicks one thing once. And even if underlyingly the automation does actions, it's not something that the user is consistently exposed to as a decision making for himself. He just holds the asset that he subscribed to.
00:27:34.530 - 00:27:38.590, Speaker C: Time's up. So I'd say like, two words, like ux and regulation.
00:27:39.450 - 00:27:49.970, Speaker A: Okay, guys, please give it up for the speakers, and thank you for listening.
