00:00:09.880 - 00:00:36.170, Speaker A: All right, you guys ready for this talk? Yeah. Everyone hear me? Okay. All right, so we're going to talk about why nfts are bad. All right? So just going full force with the bad. The bad kid means over here. All right. So oftentimes when I meet up with my friends, they'll be like, shane, you work on nfts.
00:00:36.170 - 00:01:18.106, Speaker A: Really? Why? And that reminds me of this quote by Chris Dixon, who says, the next big thing will start out looking like a toy. And right now, I believe we're really in the toy phase of nfts. And there's nothing wrong with that, but there's a lot more we can do, and that's what I'm going to talk about today. So here's a few examples of tech that generally started off as toys and then became more sophisticated over time. You can think of iPhone apps. The very first apps, you just kind of tapped on them and made stupid noises and stuff like that. Now you have sophisticated apps like Uber.
00:01:18.106 - 00:01:55.640, Speaker A: You can just press a button and a car comes and picks you up. Another example is drones. 3d printing started off as printing little trinkets, and now you can print aerospace parts with them. Another thing about NFTs is they are one of the kind of only category of crypto that has achieved product market fit with the mainstream audience. And I'm sure you guys have heard of bored apes, cryptopunks. At one point, they were on billboards. There were celebrities who owned them.
00:01:55.640 - 00:02:45.170, Speaker A: And speaking of product market fit, in cosmos, we have bad kids, right? It's been, in recent times, it's been the best performing asset in cosmos. It has 13 x'eddha in USD. Since the mint price, there's over. There's probably closer to maybe like 200 and 5300 accounts now on Twitter that have bad kids. And if you're a Devon Cosmos, you kind of have to have one now, it's also gone beyond cosmos. We have prominent people in Ethereum and other ecosystems also having them. People like Hasu, Minette supply, and there's a whole bunch more.
00:02:45.170 - 00:03:24.730, Speaker A: And every day there's another one. So that's great. So badkids is a perfect example of a PFP that doesn't have any promises, great culture around it. People love him. But what else is out there? There's also NFT games, mini apps. Here's an example of pixel wizards. These are executable nfts, so you can mint one, and then in this case, this one fetches a price for a token and it displays it in real time.
00:03:24.730 - 00:03:55.210, Speaker A: Some people add this to their home screen. On their iPhone app, they use this. Instead of Coingecko, you can have a little, you know, wizard tell you your favorite coin price instead of just a boring list. This is a game. This is kind of like a flappy bird type game. Once you mint it, you can go directly play it on the website. This is kind of great to foster a little community because you can only play it after it's minted.
00:03:55.210 - 00:04:26.770, Speaker A: When you're playing it, you know, only the other people who have minted can play it. It keeps track of a high score. So we're in the very, very kind of early days of this kind of stuff now. As we get more sophisticated over time, we see kind of entities integrated into kind of other parts of the stack. So it's kind of moving into accounts. Now, some of you may have heard of account abstraction. This is when you have a smart contract.
00:04:26.770 - 00:04:59.294, Speaker A: That's an account. It has a lot more power. You can do, for example, sign through it. You can sign in different formats. For example, you can have a cosmos chain that signs with ethereum format, so you can support metamask and other kinds of wallets. You can do key recovery, all kinds of fun stuff. So basically, a token bound account is an NFT that owns a smart contract account.
00:04:59.294 - 00:05:31.736, Speaker A: So you can have nfts that own other nfts. You can have nfts that sign for you on chain, and you can bundle nfts together. They can own other assets. So right now your account owns your PFP, but it maybe should be backwards, right? Maybe your PFP should be your actual account. And I think for normal users it kind of makes sense. So a little example of how this could work. Let's say there's this registry of accounts.
00:05:31.736 - 00:06:19.520, Speaker A: You have account a, someone sends five atom to it and maybe some other assets to it. If you want to send that bundle of assets to someone else, all you had to do is transfer the NFT. So this kind of opens a whole layer of composability, usability. Here's an example from Ethereum. You have this NFT called sapience, and this NFT owns a bunch of others. So maybe this could be used for bad kids and bit kids, right? Maybe we can create a bundle of them together. The other thing I'm excited about is NFT deFi.
00:06:19.520 - 00:07:20.660, Speaker A: So the main kind of reason I'm really interested in this stuff is because this is kind of how the crypto space looks right now. You have these defi people on one side, NfT people on the other side. There's not much in the middle there. Can we kind of bring more people into the space by introducing a bit more kind of defi features into nfts? So this is kind of what we want it to look like, right? Can these assets be looked at and be fun at the same time? So here's a couple things you can do with NFT deFi. You can have liquidity pools, NFT staking, lending and borrowing, fractionalization, maybe even a stable coin. So I'm not going to go into all of these. I'm just going to kind of double click into two of these.
00:07:20.660 - 00:08:11.420, Speaker A: So let's talk about NFT, right? So I'm sure a lot of you have used uniswap osmosis. We can have liquidity pools and you can trade against the pool. What if you can have one where you have nfts on one side, tokens on the other side, and trade amongst them, and then the person who created the pool can earn swap fees. So let's say you have like 20 bad kids and you don't want to spend a lot of time selling them on the marketplace. You want to sell all of them at once. You can create a sell pool, add a starting price, and then select a curve on how much you want the price to change as each one is sold. So this is kind of a more of a sophisticated trading tool.
00:08:11.420 - 00:08:50.880, Speaker A: You can have the three different kinds of pools, buy pools, sell pools and trade pools, and three different types of curves. So I'm just going to go through kind of one simple example here to show how this could work. So this is an example of a trade pool. You have four brackets on one side. You have to add tokens onto the other side of it. To start off the pool, the first thing you do is pick a curve. Here we have a linear curve, meaning we want the price to change by a certain delta after each one is sold.
00:08:50.880 - 00:09:50.834, Speaker A: So here we're going to start off with a starting price of 50,000 stars, a delta of 1000 stars. So let's say someone comes in and buys one of the backends from it. Now the price increases to 51,000, and it removes that price from the balance. And the creator of this pool now earns a swap free from that trade. So for creators, this could really be a supplement to royalties, because if they have their own pool of tokens, they can earn swap fees on these. Or if you're like a bad kid's whale or something, instead of having them just sit in your wallet, you can have them sit in a pool and earn, earn fees on it. Let me just continue this example a bit more.
00:09:50.834 - 00:10:37.702, Speaker A: If someone comes in and buys another one from the pool now the price goes up to 52 and the balance, and the balance goes up as well. And also it works the other way. If someone sells into the pool, then the price goes back down to 51,000. All right, let's talk about NFT staking. Did you see those tools being. Yeah, yeah, that's gonna, that's gonna be a thing we're gonna launch soon. All right, so this is how NFT staking looks right now on Ethereum and other other platforms.
00:10:37.702 - 00:11:24.040, Speaker A: You basically lock up an NFT in a vault for a certain amount of time and you earn some kind of governance token. And this is great because you can vote with this governance token, but it doesn't really do much else. And oftentimes these governance tokens just kind of don't have much use. There aren't too many examples of them doing that. Well, maybe it would be better if they could be staking tokens and actually be useful and do some useful work. So this is a mechanic that I've been working on for a bit. It's not finalized yet, but this is kind of, in general how it's going to work.
00:11:24.040 - 00:12:13.040, Speaker A: What you can do is you can wrap around proof of stake. In this case, you have a vault, you can lock up a badkid in it. Now I'm using badkids as an example here. You can do this with any kind of asset, any other NFT. And obviously we would want input from the community and input from the creators first. So the way this would work is that it can create a delegation for the floor price of the NFT, and the protocol can mint and burn the amount of the staking token up to the price of the floor. And this delegation is staked on a validator, so it secures the network at the same time.
00:12:13.040 - 00:13:00.130, Speaker A: And you can make this as risky or less risky as possible. So I'm just going to go through an example here. Let's look at the maximum risk case here. So let's say Alice wants to earn as much yield as she can by staking her bad kit, right? So she would decide to stake 100% of the floor and auto compound. So these are two parameters that you can control here. The percent of the floor you want to stake and how much you want to auto compound it. So in this case, let's say the floor goes down suddenly because the only thing she has in the vault is the NFT.
00:13:00.130 - 00:13:50.290, Speaker A: There's no buffer. So the NFT gets liquidated and then it can get sold on the marketplace. Now, this might be a bit too scary for users, but if you want to take maximum risk, it's something that might be possible. Let's look at more of a lower risk case here. Let's say Carol, she stakes her NFT, but she's only staking 50% of the floor and she's not auto combating anything here. So now when the floor price goes down every single time. Oh, one thing I forgot to mention is that every 6 hours, the protocol will be minting and burning tokens to keep the delegation at the price of the floor.
00:13:50.290 - 00:14:42.070, Speaker A: So in this case, because it's not auto compounding, the vault kind of earns the fees from the staking. And now when the floor price goes down, there's a bit of a buffer in there. So now she won't get liquidated and she's all good. What happens when they're slashing if there's extra tokens? So the goal shouldn't be to auto compound everything, because if you don't, you get the vault fills up with a little bit of tokens, and that accounts for slashing as well. So you can earn yield and be pretty relatively safe doing it this way. So this is a great example of building on an app chain. This is a feature that can only be built on an app chain.
00:14:42.070 - 00:15:42.250, Speaker A: You can't have any kind of. As a developer, you don't have control over what happens with staking on Ethereum and Solanas. Right. So anyway, yeah, this turns nfts into a productive asset and it secures the chain at the same time. All right, what else can we do? So we don't want to have all the fun in Stargaze or, I don't know, maybe we do want to have all the fun in stargaze, but ideally we do want nfts to flow around the interchange. So one thing we've been looking into is building outposts. So an outpost is basically stargaze functionality that can be kind of deployed on another chain and have access to stargaze over IBC and pretty much wraps all the IBC functionality.
00:15:42.250 - 00:16:08.928, Speaker A: So I'm going to go through an example here to kind of demonstrate how this could work. So I'm using neutron as an example here. This could be any cosmosm chain. It may even be able to work on an SDK chain at some point. But right now, this is built in cosmosm. You have this contract called Starbase that sits on the other chain. So the starbase contract will sit on neutron.
00:16:08.928 - 00:16:50.620, Speaker A: In this example, there is an NFT on stargaze that Alice wants, but she wants it on neutron. So there's going to be just one action that she has to do. Transfer n bi. So in the first case it's going to swap neutron for stars and then it's going to transfer the stars over to stargaze over IBC. In this case it uses the regular IBC transfer protocol, ICS 20. This is what's used when you're in osmosis and you're like transferring Adam to osmosis, for example. So it'll do that.
00:16:50.620 - 00:17:38.718, Speaker A: And then after it does that, the ack that it finished comes back to the outpost and then the outpost does the buy operation. And the buy operation works through interchange accounts. So what happens is now, because Alice's interchain account is funded on the Stargaze side, it has enough funds to go and buy it from the marketplace. So after that happens, now Alice's interchange account on Stargaze owns the NFT. But we need one more step, right? We need to transfer that NFT back to neutron. And this is where ICSM 21 comes in. So this is something we've been working on for a while.
00:17:38.718 - 00:18:16.720, Speaker A: And this is pretty much a protocol to, to bridge nfts over Cosmos chains. And the way it's going to work is that it locks the NFT on one side and then it mints it on the other side. So in this case, Alice's ICA account is going to lock her NFT on the Stargate side. It gets transferred over to neutron and gets minted over there. So this is kind of a nice example of IBC. It uses three different IBC protocols. It's all wrapped around in one transaction.
00:18:16.720 - 00:18:44.030, Speaker A: So to the user it happens in one click, in a few seconds, the NFT is transferred across chains. So yeah, I just kind of wanted to show you guys what's possible, what's coming next. Some cool stuff. If you guys have any questions about this stuff, hit me up on Twitter. Very accessible and I love talking about this stuff. Thanks. Thanks for coming.
00:18:44.030 - 00:19:42.382, Speaker A: Any questions? How far away from all this stuff? So the ICS 721 IBC transfer stuff, that stuff is all done. So now we're just kind of, it's all working on Testnet and stuff like that. We just have to get it on main net, like build the uis and stuff like that for it. Then after that is done, then the outpost can be built. So the only thing that really kind of hasn't started. Development is NFT staking because the design has to be tweaked a bit more. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:19:42.382 - 00:20:03.412, Speaker A: You can possibly put a whole bunch of once into the vault and then your delegation has a higher price. Yeah, yeah. But still kind of working out the parameters. Like should the parameters be controlled by the user? Should it be a dao? That kind of sets them and makes them really safe. Right. Kind of. Still working through those details.
00:20:03.412 - 00:20:09.580, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, thanks, guys.
