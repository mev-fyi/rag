00:00:00.160 - 00:01:22.140, Speaker A: Hello everyone, my name is Sisa. Today I will be telling processing dental. I'm currently the ecosystem made from dental. He's the developer against profile from 20 trending we have been researching automation motif in Cosmos SDK module. Currently we are building an automation in the processing zone and it's called trigger portal should become the generalized framework to handle any kind of axis will change I think not many people here. It really fascinates me how it moves the intense matter in a game between the fixturing set of a team in terms of crypto digits are involve actions and predefined conditions to read spectrometers is a whole topic as you also see in the previous presentation. Currently you also have Lol and so new Shop X amazing software events with these concepts you can for example choose the best price on FTX for across chains.
00:01:22.140 - 00:03:00.380, Speaker A: We do it a little bit differently because we want to execute events directly on chain and this can be print like smart contracts with box or you can use dependent up and then you can use scheduled payments for example refer payments and all these features. But we mean that smart contracts and bots are not the most optimal solution because their gauze requires a lot of gauze, a lot of manual defensing and I will dive deeper in later the stiff lacing because we think that Nintendo is more effective because you have your own control, you don't need a dirt barney, you remove the turd warning rinse and it's cheap because you don't need to spend a lot of ganseous. Here are the things for web3. You still need to perform a lot of tasks manually, which makes it a lot of required inefficient and you need to use a lot of off chain bots. Still, the developers they need to audit, develop, integrate their smart contracts to add the conditional logic to it to make it a smart bull train. So developers, endows and end users, they face these challenges to express their intent based actions. And that's why still today the end users advent of intermediary protocols that are not always so simple.
00:03:00.380 - 00:04:21.896, Speaker A: Currently if you use the vault networks and smart contracts to better you want to for example swap some ethereum every week, be below a limit, then your attempt goes to the bond network. Here are multiple offset and bulks ready which requires afterwards you need two smart contracts. The first one is a smart contract where you give you raw access to your funds and the second one is a custom smart contract where you add your positional exit. We think that these two smart contracts and also the offsetting bolts that are running. They require a lot of gas and we did an analysis on gas on our website in dental zone where we compared the amount of gas that I used to alternate tools and you're proud to say that Nintendo is up to ten times more cost efficient than other automation tools. If you want to reward it, check it out on our blog with intent of summary if you have to trust intermediaries, it's not beefy. If you see in this hoop, you need to set up a lot of agent projects.
00:04:21.896 - 00:05:08.090, Speaker A: You need to set up a lot of agents and allow this one smart contract codes. So we think this is the most optimal solution and that's why we are building Nintendo, because Nintendo stands out for scalability and for its convenience. It's just three steps we serve your action. It can be any chain, it can be any action, and it can be any time. The possibilities within dento are endless. From interchange, coordination, seller streams, swaps, swap streaming or liquidity for rebalancing. There are the possibilities with the dental or elements.
00:05:08.090 - 00:05:47.822, Speaker A: It just requires three easy steps where you specify to execute your action that can be at any check. From then on, you build your actions from messages and of course accept the conditions. We built trigger model which is also based on the three easy steps you have to set. You plan your execution, you interact and you see your notifications. You will get the right that you can stumble for ongoing actions from the dashboard. In the next slides I will show a small login how it currently works on a weather version of Trigger point. Here you can view and manage your actions.
00:05:47.822 - 00:06:37.170, Speaker A: This is your action history and here you can find inspiration for your next intent. You set up multiple possibilities there for you and you get a schedule of repairing payments. And here you can also specify whenever you want to have your recurring payments. You can specify metaphor and duration for example, and you of course everyone can make mistakes. You can always cancel your intent and you can instantly see and update your action. Another use case is trading strategies. For example, you can use dollar cost averaging where you can reduce your volatility over vertices.
00:06:37.170 - 00:07:18.460, Speaker A: Other training strategies that will be applicable with intents that is fully triggered from conditional orders or volatility phase tendencies. And then I want to introduce another alpha because we are building focus three firm as many may be familiar with IDCap API focusing. If you see these are cross chain platform where you can swap and transfer into any other chainstream, a concept that you can add your conditions whenever you want to do a swap.
00:07:18.500 - 00:07:19.600, Speaker B: For a transfer.
00:07:23.740 - 00:08:19.080, Speaker A: For the builders, you can use the dosmann GTP GPT to make it easier for you to build and you can create your complex intents. Very simple trigger pointing. All intents are set, non custodial and secure, and everything is executed. And it's in because we're using IEC for the builders, we have a lot of different barriers, for example, for execution, infotainment based engines. We have a lot of options for the messages as well for the feedback loops. And last but not least, also the conditions are specified. So that makes indento very simple, seamless and secure.
00:08:19.080 - 00:09:01.780, Speaker A: If your indent is this functional, every week you just set it for your trigger portal set up. Your action can be from any chain over IDC, anyone. Eventually you can integrate your result. As you all seen the movie office space, a lot of processes can be made more simple, so it would be great to use a dental. We are heading to the end of my presentation on intent processing. If you want to find out more on indento, you can go to indento.com. you can also try out ovida@triggerportal.com
00:09:01.780 - 00:09:14.990, Speaker A: and you can contact us by visit by telegram, or just reach out on Telegram. Thank you. Do you have any questions?
00:09:20.970 - 00:09:23.030, Speaker C: Um, how are you guys?
00:09:24.090 - 00:09:24.990, Speaker B: Intense.
00:09:25.810 - 00:09:34.230, Speaker C: Is this similar to, um, what Ethan was talking about like last misdia in terms of debt?
00:09:35.170 - 00:09:50.860, Speaker A: Well, our definition is different because here it's our IVC. So you can, yes, transfer or swap it from cosmos to any chain over ITC. And I think that makes it different from here.
00:09:53.640 - 00:10:01.820, Speaker C: Were you guys indexing that intents from other chains or is this just, is this whole with the customs?
00:10:02.120 - 00:10:03.980, Speaker A: That's a good question, but I think.
00:10:04.520 - 00:10:56.220, Speaker B: A developer welcome to game with differences between frameworks. So excuse the definition of code that extinct predefined set of actions against conditions. So we use that as the definition of depth and specifying the depth and that can be, can be any action with conditions. So it's different in way that the intense theory, these are like one also.
00:10:58.520 - 00:10:59.380, Speaker A: Intense.
00:11:06.260 - 00:11:35.356, Speaker B: Different parties that settle down the sense at a certain time. And what we know is the user based test where a user can specify, I look through this that moment confusing certain conditions. So that's the same.
00:11:35.388 - 00:11:37.120, Speaker C: So how do you find more content.
00:11:38.380 - 00:12:03.360, Speaker B: A set of actions and conditions? Action can be anything from different, specifically cosmos messages and smart bones and goals. So an action is something you do. Basically it's just very simple to know the definition.
00:12:04.140 - 00:12:08.520, Speaker C: So what kind of smart contract calls are available?
00:12:09.860 - 00:12:52.660, Speaker B: We have message to execute contracts. So right now this gospels mainly gos forum based messages and false again, it includes everything from sending for agreement subscriptions all call them and all points to sell messages like interaction with Los Angeles baby reverse influences and swaps and executing and contract the premier budget. You want to put it there previously.
00:12:59.160 - 00:13:13.520, Speaker C: So you find the actions of anything that smart project does. The game conditions are so.
00:13:15.220 - 00:13:16.004, Speaker B: Pre advisory.
00:13:16.052 - 00:13:18.920, Speaker A: Actions, king of actions.
00:13:20.900 - 00:13:27.040, Speaker C: And then what do you do on the start of that action?
00:13:27.940 - 00:14:00.240, Speaker B: We use the begin blocker of the customer SDK. And there we check for any action that is set and has the certain design. And then the gamelofter goes by action to trigger this across IBC. And we can process like 3000 device in our areas. So it will be.
00:14:01.380 - 00:14:15.690, Speaker C: This is more like zones in a webhook where. Where I'm watching smart contracts waiting for some sticking with one of those, one of those actions that happen that is being happened. So look at that.
00:14:17.230 - 00:14:54.900, Speaker B: Yeah. We also have the condition based logic. So you can define the previous output and say it has that's twelve should have output rights. Now we execute a certain action or we if that's not the case we do something else. Yeah, that's like operand met logic. And we also have feedback loops from certain message. And then I've created another message like for output boundary.
00:14:54.900 - 00:15:09.710, Speaker B: So that can be done in Longstonia matter and without smart objects. Makes it very scalable to all of high frequency dogs and smart sponsors and its media is there.
00:15:11.010 - 00:15:15.150, Speaker C: So that's the use case that I can create with concentrate bond.
00:15:16.970 - 00:15:17.370, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:17.410 - 00:15:18.990, Speaker B: And that's then that's the goal.
00:15:20.180 - 00:15:21.080, Speaker A: Go on.
00:15:21.740 - 00:15:22.640, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:15:24.700 - 00:15:36.556, Speaker D: Can I ask another question about conditions? So for example I want to swap a token if it goes under a certain price.
00:15:36.628 - 00:15:37.240, Speaker B: No.
00:15:37.620 - 00:15:49.620, Speaker D: Do I have to pay in advance for all the times that you will check your price. So do you have how do you verify the conditions and our offer?
00:15:50.400 - 00:16:44.600, Speaker B: Good question. Maybe you could also head on to the describe conditions. So we have every intent assets. So feed address where it fear. And you don't necessarily have to have funds for all reactions that you postproduct in like a year time or two with only every every time the attached triggers. Then you have to have the feed in there. But you can also set a fallback so the address that you use of so that you don't have to have fees for every then that it's best I would just keep it configurable there.
00:16:45.940 - 00:17:07.328, Speaker D: Okay. Next question is based on my interval is happening every time they check for the condition even if no message is sent. Right. To check with my message still happened.
00:17:07.464 - 00:17:08.544, Speaker B: Your omission is true.
00:17:08.592 - 00:17:12.460, Speaker D: I'm already asking you to do some more.
00:17:13.040 - 00:17:13.376, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:13.408 - 00:17:29.808, Speaker B: Is it free for the moment? What we've developed for that is we first check if you have enough for what we say is the base. Guess what we're next.
00:17:29.864 - 00:17:30.766, Speaker A: One guess.
00:17:30.928 - 00:17:48.670, Speaker B: Like 500,000 guess. But usually that actually would be about maybe less than 100,000 vn. So we first check if you have enough bands and then to run the logic each time.
00:17:53.210 - 00:17:54.510, Speaker A: Any more questions?
00:17:56.260 - 00:18:03.400, Speaker D: Do you haven't checked the UI? So do you have really some templates that want to copy and customize?
00:18:06.580 - 00:18:31.930, Speaker B: Yeah, we plan really doing that. So now it's version. That's the basic stuff. And we aim to add complex commissions in UI. We developed that itself already, but not in the UI. So that's what we are doing next. They're not.
00:18:33.110 - 00:18:40.030, Speaker D: And this works with messages that are defined on the SDK.
00:18:40.150 - 00:18:41.050, Speaker A: It's not.
00:18:44.430 - 00:18:52.114, Speaker B: Or it can also do and also know if of message. Excuse me.
00:18:52.282 - 00:19:00.910, Speaker D: Yeah, excellent. And can you remind me what's the advantage of doing this on the SDK record?
00:19:01.290 - 00:19:26.270, Speaker B: Yeah. So it's non custodial and you donate to develop custom smart flow charts. So you as a developer. So if you. Yeah, as a developer, you will normally have to develop smart contracts then all of it is for users. They don't have to do bank smart contracts that can be upgraded and whatnot. They're in control themselves.
00:19:27.930 - 00:19:33.242, Speaker D: So we have this idea before having all these events.
00:19:33.346 - 00:19:40.490, Speaker B: We do what bitcoin does for payments, we do for processing actions. So we're moving into errors. There.
