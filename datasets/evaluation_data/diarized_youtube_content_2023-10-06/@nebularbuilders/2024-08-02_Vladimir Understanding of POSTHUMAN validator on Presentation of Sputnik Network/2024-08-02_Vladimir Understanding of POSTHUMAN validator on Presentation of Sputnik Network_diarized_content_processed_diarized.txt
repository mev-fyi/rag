00:00:00.280 - 00:00:48.296, Speaker A: So hello friends, my name is Vladimir. I represent Sputnik network metaverse payment system. And before I will start I want to ask several questions and I pretty sure that everybody have email, but does anybody have a telegram? And does one person, and so everybody have telegram. Does anybody haven't Instagram? You one, two, three person don't have Instagram. And does anybody haven't GitHub? One person? I don't believe you have GitHub. I saw pull request from you. So.
00:00:48.296 - 00:01:40.614, Speaker A: But to be honest, so we live in the world where everybody use web two services. And even we had a lot of trying to create some web3 alternatives, but still we are all web3 people on the web3 conference we still use web two services. Looks like we will not stop to use it. And this is why we launched the Sputnik network. We can send crypto by usernames of any famous web two services. We can send it by telegram, usernames, Twitter usernames, discord usernames, email, Instagram, GitHub, any web, any username of any famous web two service can be used as your address. So this has solved several very interesting questions.
00:01:40.614 - 00:02:17.716, Speaker A: Because Sputnik app will support all Cosmos chain coins, EVM Solana. So you can transfer all kinds of crypto just by the usernames, how it works, so exist user. And this user can be in different metaverses. Yes. So we have web two metaverse, and all of us are participants of such web two metaverses. We have web3 metaverse cosmos ecosystem, our famous metaverse. So and we somehow in the different metaverses.
00:02:17.716 - 00:03:10.812, Speaker A: So some people still only in web two, they don't know about web3, nothing. They have Telegram, Twitter, Discord, email, something like this. And they can connect to the Sputnik app and the Sputnik app. It's just kind of the bridge kind of the connection between web two and web3. So when the user connects through the web two and connect to the Sputnik app, Sputnik app just look at the Telegram, Twitter or any other discord username and check in the internal record in some inner database. Is this username have any attached addresses? If this user totally new to web3, never had any addresses Sputnik tell. Okay, let's attach address to the username and Sputnik create eternal address for the web two user.
00:03:10.812 - 00:04:25.824, Speaker A: Because of this eternal address user just in the application connected with some Instagram and have possibility to send crypto because crypto will be sent not from the username, but from the internal address that Sputnik created especially for the user. If you are professional web3 user and you already know what is the cap layer or metamask. Any other wallet you can connect with your wallet connect and you will have personal address and you can attach your personal address to your favorite web two services. So it means any person who will connect Sputnik app will be able to communicate, to connect, to match, to link usernames with their web3 addresses. And this is not important which addresses it can be Solana addresses, ethereum addresses, any cosmos addresses. Just Sputnik will create it at the beginning by the default sputnik address. And it will be made because we need to understand some interesting moments.
00:04:25.824 - 00:05:40.680, Speaker A: Just imagine there some alternative metaverse. Where is j k and atom b? Best friends, they never develop any blockchains, they are just web to users but they want to send crypto to each other. And for example jk want to send one atom to atom b. He write in the memo something good like thank you for your and how atom will get this atom will just go to the sputnik app and will connect with his twitter sputnik app will check or I have that one atom because somebody will send this one atom to this username and this one atom on my inner address of the sputnik. So if person connected with this username, I show this atom to the user and user can send it to any other username or can even withdraw to own private address. So by this way we can send not only crypto, we can send by this way also nfts. We can send any crypto values, any crypto data.
00:05:40.680 - 00:06:16.696, Speaker A: Also is this information in the memo we can record, for example, like happy birthday, my friend, or like beautiful, my lovely girl. We already three months together. This is digital flowers to you. They will never die. So and from one side, it's funny, but when we make the presents to each other, when people send crypto to each other, when is birthday and what is the biggest problem? The biggest problem that I need to ask. Oh, hello my friend, I want to make you a gift. Send me your address and the present is destroyed.
00:06:16.696 - 00:06:55.822, Speaker A: And when we use Sputnik, I don't need to ask your address, I just see your username and I always see it in the discord, in the Twitter and the telegram and send by the username. And this is surprise. And you see how you get the surprise. And this is much more fun. Yes. So some people can tell like what's the difference with the name services? Because I need to ask you, what is your name service. And this is the same, like I ask you, what is your address? So it means even if all of us have name services, how often you was using this name services? I have four or five different name services in four or five different networks, ethereum.
00:06:55.822 - 00:07:34.182, Speaker A: But I was using maybe two or one time just to check, does it work? Yes, work. And that's all. All other times people ask me your address, not your name service. And in this case, I don't need to ask nobody. So what we get with such easy and nice functionality, users can't join the app and they attach their addresses. And we have something like indexator. So when the user attach address, we can see what this user was doing, how much, for example, air drops this user get.
00:07:34.182 - 00:08:11.302, Speaker A: So if a user get drop, and after stakes all this drop, we can score this user and tell, this is 100% brilliant hand. This user was getting airdrop and don't sell nothing 100%. And if this person sell 25% hand, 75 stake, you say 75% brilliant hand. So by this way, we can make a scoring of the users. And users will add their addresses or addresses that they want and they can prove. So I can't add not my address. Yeah.
00:08:11.302 - 00:08:57.138, Speaker A: So I need to make wallet connect, so on, so on. This is the transactions in the blockchain. So as the result, users create something like a portfolio. And we score these users and we have the perfect database of the best users. If you are the project and you want to make the airdrop, who need to get your tokens, some people who will not sell your tokens when they get it. So who you are interested in, in the users that get the tokens and stake as much as possible by the very easy user interface, you will be able show me addresses 100% brilliant hands or 75% brilliant hands. And after any project can get the list of their brilliant target group for the airdrop.
00:08:57.138 - 00:09:24.090, Speaker A: So some people will care about the score and projects will use it for making drops. People will get drops. Stake them to don't destroy their score to get new drops, to stake again to don't destroy their score. To get new drops. We can call it even cold burn. Some people so greedy that they will never bond. Nothing like stakers gonna stake.
00:09:24.090 - 00:10:16.554, Speaker A: So from where we will take so many users, to take so many users, we need to make the drop. And the biggest part of the tokens will be distributed among stakers and among NFT holders. So as we already signed 2019 in Cosmos ecosystem, we saw so many drops, we saw so many manipulations, we already understand how it works. So we think, okay, let's make the best drop. What is the best drop? Best drop, it's a distribute your drop among the most biggest amount of the real players. And prevent the situation when big amount of the tokens will be in the hand of the one player. So we will distribute it by the very easy proportional version of the distribution.
00:10:16.554 - 00:10:48.360, Speaker A: So it's not important. Do you have ten addresses, one atom each or one address with ten atoms, you will get the same amount. And stakers. It's the first cool group for the stake drop. Second, it's NFT holders, because you can't really make manipulations or make multi accounts with the NFTs. But even if you try to make ok, you already hold nfTs. And all of this about keeping value in the cosmos ecosystem.
00:10:48.360 - 00:11:35.464, Speaker A: So you will get more coins. And by this way, people will, and we will do it by the many different networks. So it will not be only atom. We will have atom stakers, injective stakers, celestial stakers. We will try to collect as much real users as it possible. And of course, we will exclude from the list all centralized exchanges, all big foundations, all the people who not really small real user. So of course, Sputniks are not launched alone.
00:11:35.464 - 00:12:17.300, Speaker A: And we have very cool advisors. One of our advisors, Diana, she from Sandow Ex Interchange foundation. Second, it's a Defi geek. This is very famous blogger, and he's a professional airdrop hunter. So he give to us a lot of advices, because he always makes the videos about how to collect, how people collect drops. Also he made the video how to make the drop hunter firms and how to avoid it. And Vladimir, he's founder of the one of the biggest reseller of hardware wallets.
00:12:17.300 - 00:12:48.968, Speaker A: So the person who buy hardware wallet, it's a perfect person to get the stake drop. Because you also can't really make multi hacking, like, okay, you can by three ledgers or something like this, you already bring. And also people who buy hardware wallets, they are also some real people. It's also hard to make multi accounts. But this is the good beginning. But we are waiting for more advisors. So we already have a lot of good validators who will support us.
00:12:48.968 - 00:13:30.840, Speaker A: Because all of it will be based on the network that have a huge amount of IBC relayers. So we start to think, okay, if we will make something like incentivize the testnet or something like this, we will have a huge amount of the testnet hunters, people who just want to run the node and do nothing. And we think, okay, for what we need there. If we want to run 100 nodes, we can do it by ourselves and we need a real contributor. So we go to our friends and tell friends, let's do this from community for community project together. And some of them are here. Block hunters crypto crew validators, citizen Web three thank you very much friends.
00:13:30.840 - 00:14:10.748, Speaker A: We will up a lot of IBC reliers. We will make a lot of IBC transactions. I really hope that on the process of the testing we will just go on the top, maybe on the second place after osmosis by the IBC transactions, because we will transfer everything from any network to another network. Of course, this is already NFT collections. We have good collaborations, mad scientists move, wired friends, pigeon bandits, geeks in garden. You can find all of them on the stargaze. This is the perfect target group to make the stake drops.
00:14:10.748 - 00:15:07.840, Speaker A: And these people who hold nfTs, they are really deep in the cosmos ecosystem. Because if you want to be deep in the if you are deep in NFT, it means you are really cosmonaut. So of course it will be all integrations with all Cosmos wallets, Cosmo station, Kepler Leap and also we even have very good connections with the keystone. It's a hardware wallet, very good alternative to the ledger. After Ledger creates this recovery through this third phrase, we stop to look at the ledger as the hardware wallet and start to look at the keystone as the hardware wallet support. Kepler works with Cosmos very good, a lot of functionality. So if you are advisor, so it means person who have a very good contact with somebody can give some very useful, useful advices.
00:15:07.840 - 00:15:55.048, Speaker A: Please join us. If you are ambassador and you want to participate in it, and somehow on different levels, maybe spread the information, maybe make translations on the local languages, run the communities, create guides. We will have a big ambassador program and we prepare kind of 5% of our initial supply will go to the ambassador program. We want to make it really community, so better. We will distribute the stockings among them, active community members, and pay to the people in costume who make their official marketing that mostly useless. So if you are developer, we have so much to develop. We are waiting for you because it's not only Cosmos, it's Solana, it's EVM.
00:15:55.048 - 00:16:18.756, Speaker A: We develop iOS Android application. So it will be a lot of to do. And with the coming of abstract accounts, we will move all this system on abstract accounts. So it will be very interesting. If you are investor and want to invest, this is also very nice. We are waiting for you. We can speak about some interesting deals.
00:16:18.756 - 00:17:29.679, Speaker A: If you are project and want to be under the hood because under the hood of the Sputnik app will be a lot of different projects. For example as the ultra protocol that gives you possibility to send encrypted messages or also it will be some NFT marketplaces that you can directly in the app make p two p exchange or swap of the nfts. So if you want to be inside of the functionality of this Putnik app and your project, please we are glad to cooperate because we are not the competitors, we are cooperators. We will be glad to implement your functionality. And if you are validator and you are a good validator, you don't want to just run the node and after do nothing and you are ready to come to app ib serialize or build some tools, build maybe block explorers or maybe contribute with the content or somehow else. Of course we always glad for such good validators and we will not only delegate, we will give even total self bonded stake. So join Sputnik early.
00:17:29.679 - 00:18:22.890, Speaker A: Here is you can see some QR code for our webpage and Sputnik exchange. You already can send crypto by the Twitter usernames. You can just connect right now, login with your Twitter, choose any other Twitter account or give me your twitter account and I will send you in just one click crypto and you will receive crypto on your Sputnik exchange even if you never was on this webpage. Thank you very much friends. If you have any questions. Yes, you told that if some guy.
00:18:22.930 - 00:18:35.990, Speaker B: From web two will come to the speaking hub, he will attach an address. And I am interested in the mechanism. How will this address be kept because.
00:18:47.420 - 00:20:04.000, Speaker A: So it first exists such understanding like authorize it action when one address can give to another address possibility to make some transactions. Yes. So from the if we speak about web two side just person just join with any Instagram Twitter and when sputnik look at the database and if this person joined Singapore syngin first time and Sputnik don't see any address Sputnik create the address and in the database match them. Tell this username now have this Sputnik address and when the person operate in the Sputnik app person tell to the sputnik, Sputnik withdraw for me. And this is kind of the bot that control key encrypted can perform action. But this but he listened the comments only from the person who connected with the username who make authorization with the username and he tell this address. If I get comment to send or to swap from this person who make authorization with username.
00:20:04.000 - 00:21:04.516, Speaker A: This username can perform actions from this address. So I'm as the bot perform actions if any other user will tell other users have other addresses and if I already, if I don't want to trust to the sputnik. And this is also very good. Yeah, it's just in case when I'm just very new in the web3 and I don't have any address, but I don't understand for what I need to remember twelve words. I even don't have any crypto, but in this case I join with Instagram, I get some drop or something like this. And after I want and Sputnik sent to me message friend at the address that's not really yours, but Sputnik is already $100 go and write twelve words, create your wallet and attach your address instead of mine. And you need to remember twelve words because you need to keep your $100 and user understand.
00:21:04.516 - 00:21:24.720, Speaker A: Ah, this is why I need to write down twelve words. Yeah, because then, now the problem of the situation, you invite some new person to the web. Three, okay, create the wallet. It's very easy. Just now, twelve words, record it two times on the paper. If you will lose it, you will never. If somebody will ask, don't tell.
00:21:24.720 - 00:22:06.058, Speaker A: Person still don't have any crypto, but already thinks that it's his own criminal gang because it's something really dangerous because it's like the red flags everywhere. It's like, oh my God. Yeah. And in this case, when you already have some crypto, you understand, okay, I need to perform this action to make my $101,000 more secure. And until person don't have really big amount, just ask bot to make these transfers. The same situation can see at every centralized exchange because funds on centralized exchange, not my funds. I ask like binance withdraw funds.
00:22:06.058 - 00:22:24.906, Speaker A: They say yes, yes, 12 hours. We have some technical problems. We just stake your money and like earn. When we will unstake it, we will withdraw. No, wait. Like you put the, you accept the agreement, just wait. So, and in our case it will be totally optimized.
00:22:24.906 - 00:22:57.846, Speaker A: Just this is the board. This is the not human board. Get comment board. Check. Is it legal comment or not legal comment? If it's legal, do the comment. So here is several solutions. And one is usually easy and less secure.
00:22:57.846 - 00:23:40.720, Speaker A: And one is harder, but most secure. So I think we will start at the beginning with more easy and less secure. When the board just have encrypted keys inside and more harder version. It's when we have possibility to create address with the private keys. That even creators will not know. And in this case, if somebody will, if something goes wrong in some technical ways, even those who even developers will not be able to do nothing. That's why we wanted first test on the easy way.
00:23:40.720 - 00:24:36.406, Speaker A: And when we will understand that it perfectly works. We will make this address more we think to attach this address also to the governance. So if something will go, something goes wrong, we can make the governance and tell withdraw funds from the bot to the community pool or something like this. Also in the case if there something sent, like I see your Twitter username and send funds to your username, but you tell fucking web two, I will never use it again. And you don't login with your username for the one year. In this case, Sputnik can check all founds was sent to this username. But this person never connect with this username for one year.
00:24:36.406 - 00:25:09.162, Speaker A: So I send it to the community pool. Let's community will decide what to do with this money. So it will be automatically processed. So any amount that will be sent and for one year nobody touch it goes to the community pool. But it's in case if you not login, if you log in with your Instagram one time, it means Sputnik already will say this person make authorization. So these funds will never go to the community pool. Also, I forgot to tell important moment for the web two users.
00:25:09.162 - 00:25:41.138, Speaker A: Yes, because for us web3 people, it's okay to pay the fees. And we say to pay the fee. It's something like holy single. If some person don't have funds to pay fee, like of course send to the fee to pay fee, it's like don't return and web two users for them it's a little bit hard. So we with the authorized grant fees will pay fees for the web two users from the community pool. So we will. So for the web two users it will be kind of free transactions.
00:25:41.138 - 00:26:05.660, Speaker A: But for the blockchain it will not be free transactions, just community pool pay for the web two users. Of course, to prevent some manipulations, we will tell, okay, not more than like 510 transactions per day and next day you will again restore it. But if you are web3 user, please pay fee like all others do because it's cool to pay fees.
