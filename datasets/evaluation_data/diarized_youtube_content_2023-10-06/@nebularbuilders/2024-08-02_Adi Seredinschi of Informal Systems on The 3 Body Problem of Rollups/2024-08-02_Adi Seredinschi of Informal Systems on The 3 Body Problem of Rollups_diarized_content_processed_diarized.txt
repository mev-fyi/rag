00:00:00.320 - 00:00:27.550, Speaker A: Hi everyone. We're excited here in team blocks work. I'm Anik, I'm looking for systems and I will body problems of roll ups and some ways to mitigate this problem in. Let's start with a very, very simple example. Just like here. Two players. These are like 15 large electronization.
00:00:27.550 - 00:01:03.260, Speaker A: It's a very simple game. Kingsgate spot five. We should all go with one. We can make this significantly more simply. And additionally we also allow you to have multiple baseball in their hands. Then against quite chaotic. Imagine being in this game where the other vastly to multiple balls at the.
00:01:03.260 - 00:01:29.600, Speaker A: So this is chaos. You need a pinch. There's two other three systems. Initially systems in one. And it's also in my opinion one of the simplest way to explain what we got scales. It's a system which first of all, you cannot really predict what it will do next. Even if you're inside the system or it's even more secure.
00:01:29.600 - 00:01:54.956, Speaker A: I'm mentioning this because I think it's a pretty insightful way to understand the people to get an agree on the complexity that roms face. Especially if they affect being set free. So the three bodies that actually make up both centralized rom system means. But they're very, very basic. We have l one s and I'm just representing them here by. Nope. We have a sequencer id centralized.
00:01:54.956 - 00:02:27.314, Speaker A: You have execution of rows. And just like failures in earlier example, each of these three systems do pretty much whatever they want to stay in check. And in the middle you have user transactions. And the goal is that the user transaction will be able to make to escape. And this of course, I'm abstracting over a lot of data, right. I'm just speaking during that. Also taking to the perspective the users.
00:02:27.314 - 00:03:25.090, Speaker A: The users, they don't try to lose the system and they throw their transactions. This kind of painful thing is in this analogy. And sometimes the system is so unpredictable, they show they never get hit from the system. You're there and view there and you passenger. So you can have three systems and moves some of its transactions and developers and some as well. And they're persuaded there's also eventually efficiency and cost concerns, which the main question that I'm trying to ask is how can we mean? This is the problem statement so far. And if you did anyway, anything from size is to get a bit of an understanding that these are significant complexes.
00:03:25.090 - 00:04:02.740, Speaker A: Within each of these box there is a system itself. And they are extremely complex. So how can we get out of. There's different approaches. Recently, in the last month or so in formula, we have been at a seven, which we call this is a very long just invented, so it will not even appear. But I will try to explain why I'm considering what does it mean. And there's another approach that we're using, which is the model of protocols.
00:04:02.740 - 00:04:47.312, Speaker A: Are you prepped before we build a workshop here actually so after my going bunch of separate ones and outcome being that we want to be able to make it easier for developers to build. Reiterate five doesn't have predictable systems that are same. So let's focus on Maliki gather. I just want to continue. I like it so much. So we have the same user at the top and transaction is coming through. And I'm putting here three protocols.
00:04:47.312 - 00:05:38.368, Speaker A: This is a complicated protocol that runs through decentralized nodes. Since the definition of exiting will nothing between execution and for some syringe based on it's actually inspired from the target side. So we have the execution pro there. And once you, once the user brings the transaction and eventually that proof has to make it to DL1 because otherwise it's not otherwise it's just essentials centralized data with some sort of stuff. And they entertained sequencer and it's another protocol is called brief summation. And the nodes from the sequencer have to convince the nodes for the l one to take this proof setback. And there's another protocol that is called, in this case force staining validate.
00:05:38.368 - 00:06:14.516, Speaker A: And the role of this protocol, this runs also within the sequencers in BL1. The role of this protocol, very briefly is to make sure that the nodes that run the status symbols consistent with the stakers on yellow, you cannot just join the distance wise whenever you want. You have to stake some, some dopamine yellow one, because that keeps you correct sequencer being stay. So this is a pos. This is actually also how polygon does things. If you're familiar with the polling bound pos. But that is thinking at the high level there's different things centralized, SQL sensing.
00:06:14.516 - 00:06:40.730, Speaker A: Again, it's involved in all investing in this subject. So if you want to dig in the functional capacities, let's zoom in beside the sequence. Really interesting. There's again another instance of a few of the nodes on the signals with themselves. They can write to each other, they can lean from wherever they want. This is called the descent info tolerance. A very well studied problem.
00:06:40.730 - 00:07:51.426, Speaker A: I will not go into that problem. Let's try to say that between the nodes of a super Saiyan, again different all the day in the front and the trigger, there's a lot of complexity that complexity gives hidden inside and up. So let's zoom in. What is this size mode? Now we're starting to see some assumptions that seem familiar. We have RPC entry point where users we saw here in this case which provides sterilization, provides additional sections and so on. And finally we have what we call signal circle, which is really the part that encapsulates most of the complexity that is related or different walls sequencers are not expanding that I'm trying to describe here today. And we got driver the basis for the syntag and the rest.
00:07:51.426 - 00:08:33.802, Speaker A: And it's a kernel. I'll emphasize this, it's a kernel because it's supposed to be small, extensible and to think of it experience with maintaining Covid. What it takes maintain such complex code is from multiple years. It's very tough job. And some things that have inspired us in building specifically we're trying to huge exercise in industry and being equipped for business as well as possible. So you want to be single and concise. This is very important.
00:08:33.802 - 00:09:12.278, Speaker A: The second is not supposed to be a slash number that solves all the problems that work. And it's supposed to be an. So you start watching it and then you allow other users and developers for other systems in designing uses to add the different features that you need instead of subsetting up front. That's within the government issues. So I was reading a book recently and the book is about the unit sterling. I read these three descriptions for what is one for three quotes that I do and the light, the Unix turn on. Exactly what? Same description, same principle in monitor.
00:09:12.278 - 00:09:56.132, Speaker A: So I'm just copying. Yeah. And the purpose of validation is we want to offer long term. So it's not necessarily some. And the primary goal actually is to provide a soft part which we have yet to experiment with different centralizations. Sequencers are just a bit there will be added, we are going to, there's progress, there's going to be different markets that are going to be around. And we may need centralization or initiative beyond sequences.
00:09:56.132 - 00:10:30.430, Speaker A: So we're building just small kernels so that we can build algorithms. It's not necessarily aimed. Okay, we have one problem solved and we forget. So there's a lack of experimentation actually in the field of consensus algorithm or sequence. And we want really the logs encourages experimentation. So that's why there's so much emphasis on small mean signal. And the third thing is I damage the point and receive this complement something that slash number or swiss that supposed to be a lot of this one.
00:10:30.430 - 00:11:25.728, Speaker A: So if you're not changing and want to just launch an all just. And this is the architecture overview on how we have integrated with an action from scrims. What I want to emphasize here represent every one of these boxes. So the orange boxes in the rebox connector it's a concurrency model or being known. And that's for supervisor. This has more like a supervising role where in case one of the actors dies or mistakes started. It's very strong foundation fault burn systems but in spiel strength it's not necessarily super messy components.
00:11:25.728 - 00:12:17.168, Speaker A: And you can't test each component in isolation from the others because reacts to messages that are targeted. So there's no shit at stake. And because there's no share stake isolating true for and they introduce problems for ease. That is the same for those of you familiar with grassy that's what you build this underlying one pair. We use a decision if we're not locked on but it's really off to get learning extra data. The main point for building all of this as we see there the one is that the context earlier was so that we can actually get the burnout in the middle. That was basic elements.
00:12:17.168 - 00:12:57.090, Speaker A: I will not go into detail what those are described. Anything is interesting once that so that he take the thread which is in the middle and we integrate it with action use case and then we put it on centralized entropy. It runs on experiments and we've been doing that for like three weeks now. The main goal is actually not to get performance but I'm showing you the performance in the goal of showing stability. Ash. So the boundary graph shows how many rounds do the 25 validators need to reach constances. This is an indication of how much stability there is in there.
00:12:57.090 - 00:13:39.338, Speaker A: If there's bugs, if there's storage, the system is not very much aspirated. This will be one. It states at zero means that the current proposer of block has matched the other noise. Remember when they were successfully building the so flat line and zero will suffer. And then the top shows this three hour bonus, three hour run. And the number of the plots are I knew each new height is produced as time passes where each new block or new height consists of 1 mb block dropping. And it happens every one closest.
00:13:39.338 - 00:14:15.828, Speaker A: So it's the same regularity that if the bottoming graph will show spikes, the top graph will show less the curve being less designed. And yeah, we don't have a full stack here so we're not storing this. There's no write ahead, so there's different elements that are missing. I said the point of the supervisor. Those things weren't basically drivers or findings that they can. This is kind of the most important part. We're quite excited that we're seeing stability.
00:14:15.828 - 00:14:52.030, Speaker A: We're still chasing different orientation or different cases in other dependencies and trying to be sure that what we're building on top of the other drivers is building on a constable voltage. Well yeah, this is a roadmap. It's still. It's a live gone many roadmaps they're not set in stone. It's not like that doesn't have ten rules. So we started down with pretty experiment 100 rounds. The possibly showed the radio works with only byte knobs where we have runs with 100 as well.
00:14:52.030 - 00:15:52.690, Speaker A: And we're basically just chasing bottlenecks. And we're trying to analyze bias performance along this before we move forward with the tagging stuff. And we're trying to express decentralized SQL server so that towards 2025 once we finish Yale want to submit the rules. Also I mentioned earlier in the park there's run so that these things we're going to try to have a mobile testnet approaching Zambian to run. So there will be actually other sponsoring they will all use under the same margin. It's the simplest one in the map. What we want to change just a bit and we're going to have support for other as long as proof scheduling and demonstrating the first 12 seconds.
00:15:52.690 - 00:16:57.298, Speaker A: It's a multi year goal of we want process as the years will pass. We want to see eventually just this serious that is very accessible means that one importation derivatives such as simple search and this one size and many other choices coming back to the approaches. When I mentioned in the beginning, I mentioned quit. I will not go into details because I'm not the language and just launched a website. We have a couple of other experts in Rosell so please check. I just want to bring attention and if you're aware that it's a product developers. So the systems that we are leading extremely complicated systems and they're handing maximum money and so serious.
00:16:57.298 - 00:17:46.832, Speaker A: It's not something that you just take easy with politics. Both websites and automate. We want easy to migrate on because once we build something a little bit you realize that this is not enough the next step you never asked. So it's really important to be a minded retrain. And my final slide just a bit about informal systems. I managed to not have adequate and we also contributed by CR's. We also contributed to guys really the audience please talk to him about moving top support pinterest to anything internal operator and to why the same thing.
00:17:46.832 - 00:18:08.216, Speaker A: He's a man. Yeah. 14 year numbers. Then we have at least three of them. And we also have this adventure cycles. And we're also very active on the audits period. Game credits are very important for us.
00:18:08.216 - 00:18:55.428, Speaker A: Then audits are not. Finally, if you're interested in working for a career in particular, we're always looking at questions. Thanks, everyone. Yeah, it's about chain. So there's what goes wrong from the perspective. What happens is that component itself asks for the thought and then varying 16 bytes. And there's no assumption about focus.
00:18:55.428 - 00:19:33.330, Speaker A: Life circuit bigger or smaller. There's no solution. Equal block semantics. Next to seven does mean just the streamlinpextracts right now. No, I'm not. There's different, but none of them. Some of them use other algorithms.
00:19:33.330 - 00:19:39.750, Speaker A: The same.
