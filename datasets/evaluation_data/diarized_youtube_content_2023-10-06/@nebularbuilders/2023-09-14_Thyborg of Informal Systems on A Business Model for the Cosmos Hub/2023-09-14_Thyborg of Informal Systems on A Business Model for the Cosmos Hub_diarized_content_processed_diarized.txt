00:00:00.200 - 00:00:12.846, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. Thanks for coming. I'm glad there's people today. There's a main stage, and you guys made the trip to the cave, essentially. So thank you very much. I'm Thaiborg. I'm going to talk about the Cosmos hub today.
00:00:12.846 - 00:00:38.750, Speaker A: Informal system is. I work for informal system. It's a core contributor to the Cosmos hub and to the rest of the Cosmos stack. Today. I want to talk specifically about the Cosmos hub and some ideas that we are considering an informal system in terms of what we should do next. On the roadmap, we shipped shared security, specifically replicate security last year. We are onboarding consumer chain at the moment.
00:00:38.750 - 00:01:06.800, Speaker A: We already have two live. These are neutron and Lido and, sorry, stride, not Lido. And there's a number of other things in the pipeline that I want to talk about today. So it's a three step process, a three step plan, an easy three step plan. First, become the hub of the atomic zone. That's well on the way. Second, become the hub of the IBC app chains, and third, become the hub of the IBC roll ups.
00:01:06.800 - 00:01:32.964, Speaker A: So we're going to go through each of these sections one by one, first one being the atom economic zone. So you can imagine that as concentric circles, you have the cosmos hub at the center. Replicate security app chains are going to be limited. There are going to be five to ten of them. It's not a highly scalable setup. It's a very interesting setup and we're going to talk about it, but it's not very scalable. The second concentric circle is going to be the opt in security app chains.
00:01:32.964 - 00:02:05.910, Speaker A: So validators are able to opt in to validate, and that's much more scalable. So for that, we can imagine hundreds of them. Mesh security is obviously something that the customers hub is well positioned to do. This is something that is very interesting for the hub that osmosis led the development of, but something that the cosmos hub is naturally a leader for. Mesh security because of the high stake that it has and the position in the ecosystem. And that's infinitely scalable. So as many app chains as there is at the moment, it could be thousands.
00:02:05.910 - 00:03:04.030, Speaker A: Replicated security is an interesting topic and people talk a lot about the drawbacks and the problems with replicated security. I want to address these problems one by one, by talking about the economics. So the first thing that people say is that validators are going to suffer, validators are going to not make money, it's going to be a centralization problem, and it's going to run out the small validators out of the cosmos upset. If you look at the current validators and the way they decide and take decisions, you will notice that most of the chains, and these are some of the most successful app chains in cosmos. They are by market cap. The biggest one I took out, some of the chains, like Kava, and the other one I took out was Kronos, because they're not really that integrated within the IBC ecosystem. But the other ones, like osmosis, for instance, a cache and stride.
00:03:04.030 - 00:03:17.480, Speaker A: Most of the validators don't break even. Like you can see on osmosis. Only 31% of the validators break even. And that's with the osmosis 2.0 tokenomics. Same thing for cash. Even less validators breakeven stride.
00:03:17.480 - 00:03:56.192, Speaker A: Only one of them break even at the moment using the inflation parameters that they have. So the cosmos hub is really where the money is made at the moment for all these validators. The second thing people talk about is that it's too expensive. Supposedly, revenue security is too expensive. Now, that's because for all the chains, it doesn't feel expensive because they use inflation to sponsor and paid validators. But right now in this column, you can see how much injective osmosis, Axelr, Akash and stripe pay in terms of inflation costs that they have to subsidize for the validators to stay online. That's huge.
00:03:56.192 - 00:04:36.924, Speaker A: Like injected, for instance, is $52 million. That's with the current bondage rate. So now, if you want to get to a similar level of security as the hub, we did some projection here, or rather some estimation about what it would cost with 66% bonded rates, the same as the hub, which provides a similar level of security. And that's with an APR of 21%, that would be $72 million that injective would have to spend on security. So if you compare that to what neutron, stride and duality are going to pay, we're going to talk about that in the next slide. This is way, way higher. Like orders of magnitude higher.
00:04:36.924 - 00:05:00.576, Speaker A: So, this is what the cosmos hub could potentially be charging for the service of providing security. It's a very interesting metric. Now, let's see what we expect from these consumer chains. So, all these estimations are made for the first year. So these are pretty conservative estimations because obviously, neutron is meant to grow. Stride is meant to grow. And all these consumer chains, all these consumer chains are meant to grow.
00:05:00.576 - 00:05:38.208, Speaker A: But for the first year, neutron is going to share transaction fees. And mev, I'm going to skip to the next slide and show you the results. I've put the blockworks estimation as a way to compare what we did in formal and what they did. But you can see on the base case scenario, it's about 1 million per year that neutron is meant to generate on the first year. And for the Cosmos hub to break even on that, it has to generate about $800,000 when you take a validator cost of $400 per month. So that includes the server cost. Essentially.
00:05:38.208 - 00:06:05.440, Speaker A: It doesn't include manpower and HR costs. But you can see even in the first year, at least, the server cost would break even stride. So I put here all the tables, and you will find this talk online. I'm not going to go through them one by one. But we did some TVL. We based that on the TVL. So Stride right now has $35 million in TVL.
00:06:05.440 - 00:06:30.580, Speaker A: We took 48 for the first year. The base case is 73. This is also based like the growth rate is based on Leidos growth rates. And the result of that is that stride would break even essentially the first year. So, like I mentioned, it's $800,000 on the base case. We expect that to break even. Block wars was a little more optimistic about stride, I guess.
00:06:30.580 - 00:07:01.138, Speaker A: But in both cases, we break even. Duality is obviously sharing 100% of any value that is generated in their chain. So it looks better for duality both looking at transaction fees and Mev Mev. We're taking the numbers from SCIP. So this is based on what SCIP is analyzing is their per transaction on osmosis. And what we get for duality is essentially $1.5 million on the base case.
00:07:01.138 - 00:07:29.906, Speaker A: So we break even. This is just the first year. It's normal for a business to not break even for the first year. The cosmos would break even with this projection. Now, duality obviously, like, set the standard for what a consumer chain should do by not using a separate token. But I think even if. And I would expect more consumer chain to follow the way duality did.
00:07:29.906 - 00:08:04.652, Speaker A: But I think it's not the only way that new consumer chain get to the Cosmos hub. And also, they only use atoms. So here I want to talk about one interesting thing that the cosmos hub can do, and really should do, is use the large amount of capital that is sitting in the community pool. About 3.3 million atoms. That's about $30 million with the current stats, obviously, some people are talking about changing the tokenomics, so that would potentially evolve. But right now, with a community pool tax at 10%, we have 3.3
00:08:04.652 - 00:08:39.700, Speaker A: million items in the community pool. So we could use, on top of the capital that is already available, some of the inflation that is reduced the APR for stakers. So right now, if you discount 10% to the 29% of the APR that stakeholders are currently getting, you get 19%. If it stays at 19% and we just don't do anything, there would be $80 million on the first year in the community pool. So that's a budget of $80 million. If we don't change anything. Now, if we change something, meaning we reduce inflation, sorry.
00:08:39.700 - 00:09:27.512, Speaker A: We take away some of the APR and dedicate it to acquisition, we would get 125 million. If we take all the APR for acquisition, we get half a billion dollars. So what does that mean for the cosmos hub? That means it could buy stuff, it could buy injective, it could buy osmosis, it could buy XLR, it could buy a cash and stride get rid of these tokens and essentially have all the value accrual go to atom. So the Cosmos hub could be in a position to acquire whatever product has. Product market fits in cosmos quite easily. Like the third column here is number of years it would take for this acquisition to go through. Based on the metrics I just mentioned, it would take a little more than half a year to buy osmosis.
00:09:27.512 - 00:10:17.244, Speaker A: So this is just to give you an idea of the scale of the market cap and how easy it would be for these things to happen. And we would go from a model where some consumer chain have their own token like neutron and stride, and duality is using atom, to a model where everyone is using atom and it becomes a proper atom economic zone. Now, we know that there's a number of other players in the shared security space. Like one of them. Well, people may talk about osmosis, but I think the big one is Ethereum. Like we have something called Eigen layer coming up on Ethereum that will allow Ethereum to use shared security and essentially get. Ethereum gets Ethereum validator slashed for securing all the kind of application.
00:10:17.244 - 00:11:00.690, Speaker A: So we need to innovate and use the cosmos properties that are there already in order to avoid ethereum from securing everything and the cosmos sub from not being that useful. So what do we do? Atomic IBC is a really interesting idea. So right now, when you look at the atomic anomic zone, you have four chains, the hub, neutron, stride and duality. And they all run the cosmos SDK and commit Bft. So there's four different commit BFT process. The idea would be to have a single commit BFT process. So there would be four apps, four cosmos, SDKs, one single commit BFT process, whether with the law, essentially all the transaction would be going to the same mempool.
00:11:00.690 - 00:11:58.782, Speaker A: And so the top of the block, you could order this transaction so that you can make sure that a sequence of transactions, this is called atomic transactions, are being processed in an order that, you know, makes sense for arbitrage, makes sense for flash loans, makes sense for a number of interesting defi things like you could imagine, for instance, liquidation on actually, so Yumi is not represented here, but they are one of the consumer chain that are on the list. Liquidation could be processed on duality and immediately swapped on duality. Sorry, processed on Umi, swapped on duality. So the way this would work, all the transactions are going to the same name pool. The top of the block would be for a special fee. You would be able to order this transaction in a specific order, Mev style, actually atom insurance, scheduler style. And then the rest of the block would be for parallel transaction.
00:11:58.782 - 00:12:28.872, Speaker A: And that would provide the scalability that Ethereum doesn't have. So you get the best of both worlds, essentially you get the scalability of cosmos with the composability of Ethereum opt in security. That's coming soon. So we have already on the forum an explanation of how we want to enable opt in security. So for that we need fraud proofs. Fraud proofs are not there yet. There's many people working on it.
00:12:28.872 - 00:13:24.030, Speaker A: There's the roller people working on it, they're always six months away or three months away. So one thing that we intend to do at informal is move ahead with a different setup where we wouldn't have to wait for permissionless to work, but rather use the fact that we have a very active governance forum governance process, and we are able to slash validators without having to prove automatically that incorrect execution happened on the consumer chain. So I invite you to check this. I don't want to go too deep into that, because we have a lot to talk about. The next one is generalized ics. So that's essentially inspired by Eigen layer where you can slash for everything, and that enables a bunch of new use cases. So this requires cosmos on the hub, but you will have rest taking smart contracts on the cosmos hub, the same way you have rest taking smart contracts on Ethereum for Eigen layer.
00:13:24.030 - 00:14:14.726, Speaker A: That means that not just consumer chain can tap into the security of the cosmos hub, but also da services keepers. Oracle bridges a whole new set of use cases that would enable. So not just securing consumer chains and chains, but any kind of application that would potentially require it. So that's for the atomic dynamics zone. Right now, we have repeated security opt in and mesh. This is what's coming, most likely this year. Now, originally in the Cosmos hub vision that Ethan and Jay wrote four years back now, or at least it was like the Cosmos hub was there was born four years back, the hub was supposed to be the hub of the IBC app chain.
00:14:14.726 - 00:14:41.076, Speaker A: So the hub was supposed to be at the center of the IBC transfer. It was supposed to be the first on the map of zone. Map of zone app. So how do we make that happen? Well, it's much easier when we start from being the hub of the atomic zone. So duality, neutron Stride and the others, they are already going to have commercial relationship with the hub. They already connect. They are already going to connect to the hub.
00:14:41.076 - 00:15:00.760, Speaker A: They don't need to connect to every other IBC chain. This is expensive. Like, you have to run archive nodes, you have to pay relayers. Like there's a cost associated with that. And these consumer chain are just getting started. They already have to pay the cosmos hub. So it would make sense for them to just connect to the hub and then let the hub handle transaction outside of the mechanics.
00:15:00.760 - 00:15:48.074, Speaker A: So that's easy. Now, once you have that set up and once you have this connection set up, then you would want projects like Kujira to connect to us, not necessarily Kujira to osmosis, because this is a common route. But any new project doesn't have to connect to every new project and incur the cost. That means it costs maybe $500 to connect to a new chain per month for a relay or to do the work of relaying. So when you sum that up, it becomes 50 chains. This becomes very quickly unpractical. So the idea would be that because the atomic zone is formed and these connections are already happening, you would be able to use that as a stepping stone to become the hub of the IBC app chains.
00:15:48.074 - 00:16:25.852, Speaker A: And this is mostly a business development effort. Like, it's not a technical, hard lift to do, intermediary chain kind of multi hop rooting. So easy win for the cosmos hub. And then the next step is obviously all these other ecosystem avalanche subnets and Polkadot power chain. It's not reasonable to expect that they would connect to every IBC cosmos chain. So they could pass through the hub just as easily as Kujira could connect to osmosis through the hub. And here we get.
00:16:25.852 - 00:17:00.652, Speaker A: I don't know. They claim that they have 200 subnets. They have at least 20 parachains live. You know, these are a number of transactions and economic activity that would go through the Cosmos app. And so it's expensive right now to do IBC transfers, but it would be even more expensive to do IBC transfer. Trust minimize IBC transfer. So what is trust minimized? This is something that the Cdesia people are talking a lot about.
00:17:00.652 - 00:17:39.914, Speaker A: Like essentially on IBC right now, you don't verify the state. You don't verify the state transition on the counterparty chain. You just trust the validators on the counterparty chain that they sign the right thing, that the transaction happens correctly on the signing chain. So what roll up have that app chains don't have at the moment is this ability to prove that the say transition was, was performed correctly. And they do that by having Celestia or any kind of shared security layer. Sorry, any kind of shared DA layer that they can pull the data from. And Celestia is making the data available to them.
00:17:39.914 - 00:18:16.780, Speaker A: Now that requires ZK technology, which is something that could easily be coming to the cosmos hub. And so you will have chains like osmosis creating ZK proofs. So you have a prover on osmosis lite clients for every other cosmos chain on the Cosmos hub. So instead of having ZK like clients for every chain, you would route through the Cosmos hub. And these ZK like clients on the Cosmos hub would be trust. Like the valuation would happen on the Cosmos hub, and you would have another hop to other IBC app chain. So it would be zkibc.
00:18:16.780 - 00:18:57.018, Speaker A: And because it's expensive to make proof, because it's expensive to verify proof. Again, economies of scale using the Cosmos hub. So last stage of this easy three step roadmap, the hub of the IBC roll up. First one, it's kind of an obvious one, is securing settlement layers. So ICS is great. I'm sure you want to show this one. So ICS is great because salmon layers, basically, they have to be like the software that does settlement, has to be customized for the kind of roll up that is settling on the chain.
00:18:57.018 - 00:19:28.676, Speaker A: So, for instance, for eclipse roll ups who use the Solana VM, you have a different kind of settlement than for sovereign roll ups or roll kit rollups. Any roll up needs a different kind of sediment. So instead of having to build a semi layer for everything, you could have neutron duality, eclipse becoming the seven layers. I think neutron has already announced plans of doing that eclipse. That's already, that's the whole purpose of the project. These seven layers need stake. Like, right now.
00:19:28.676 - 00:20:01.470, Speaker A: They have no economic security. If these road webs are successful and the salmon layer is insecure, that's a big problem. So the Cosmos app is in a position to secure these platforms quite easily. And all the rollups would use Celestia for DA. So that's a nice way to go about it. But in the same way that the Cosmos app can acquire app chain, it could also acquire settlement layers. So this is essentially this slide where we would take the settlement layers from duality, take the settlement layer from eclipse, and put it on the Cosmos hub.
00:20:01.470 - 00:21:08.604, Speaker A: And that way, the cosmos hub itself, like the blockchain itself, would become the place where all the liquidity is bridged. And in addition to an IBC hub, that would make the cosmos hub a liquidity hub, which, again, for the narrative, for the metrics, this is like an important win. So once you have a cosmos hub that is the center of the IBC world, that is a liquidity hub, that all the liquidity is locked there in escrow, then the atomic economic zone becomes a very exclusive place to be, in addition to atomic IBC, highly composable with each other. That becomes the place that every cosmos change wants to be. And so that means that people like Stargaze, Yumi polymer, like, would have to fight, essentially, to get in. And that's a nice place to be for the cosmos hub because it can essentially charge a lot more than it does at the moment. So what I would expect is that the atomic zone becomes very exclusive.
00:21:08.604 - 00:21:32.926, Speaker A: The fees go up substantially. It becomes highly coveted spots. And the one that make money can stay the one that don't make money have to get out. And that's. That's how we. That's how I really see, like, things going over the next couple of years. So my slide.
00:21:32.926 - 00:21:55.310, Speaker A: My slide got stuck. I think the next one was a conclusion. So, essentially, it's not that difficult to get a proper, viable business model. Business model. We start with the economic zone. We make that a very attractive place to be. We make sure that we benefit from network effects, strong network effects within the zone.
00:21:55.310 - 00:22:14.890, Speaker A: We build atomic composability. From that stepping stone, we connect to the rest of the IBC ecosystem. We take center stage, and we are well prepared for the next wave, essentially, of app specific chains and rollup. Thanks, everyone. That's my talk.
