00:00:08.960 - 00:00:42.920, Speaker A: First, I'd like to thank Adrian, Charles, and Jelena for joining me on the stage today for the panel. And as a non technical person, it's nice to see the views from people on the technical side of things, which led to the panel today being called, does Cosmos have an identity problem? So what I wanted to start with the first question is, how do you see Cosmos? How do you. Sorry. How is Cosmos being perceived from an outside perspective?
00:00:43.260 - 00:01:00.736, Speaker B: Okay, before we get started, I actually want to hear from the crowd, who here thinks Cosmos has an identity problem? Raise your hand. So you know that's a bad thing. So, you know, we think that's a bad thing. Okay. And who here thinks there's no identity problem? We figured it out. We know what we're all about. One person.
00:01:00.736 - 00:01:10.860, Speaker B: Okay. All right, so just to set the stage, I think a lot of people are going to be expecting us to talk about the fact that we have an identity problem. So. Sorry, what was the question again?
00:01:11.600 - 00:01:16.688, Speaker A: Sorry. The question was, how is cosmos being perceived from outside the ecosystem?
00:01:16.864 - 00:01:46.230, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I'll begin. I definitely resonate with the crowd that just raised their hands to say that Cosmos has an identity problem. You know, I think we're looking at ourselves in comparison to other ecosystems. Ethereum, Polkadot, Solana, you know, avalanche. And it's definitely very chaotic and very sort of divisive. Right. We have this, you know, thesis of the Internet of blockchains of sovereignty, and I think with that comes a lot of, you know, identity crises.
00:01:46.230 - 00:01:49.568, Speaker B: But I'm curious what my panelists have to say.
00:01:49.714 - 00:02:20.408, Speaker C: I can connect. Okay, probably. I think, like, the thing we kind of, like, missed is just because when you go, like, outside, it's like, people, like, walking, and they're kind of, like, maxi about, like, ether mostly or bitcoin mostly. So they. They will probably work on something really different than the framework that cosmos have. Cosmos is all about, like, interoperability, as you say. And the thing is, we have this question about identity because there is, like, a lot of chain.
00:02:20.408 - 00:02:54.260, Speaker C: There is, like, no CEO. There was one before, like, for cosmos, but rip, I guess, like, now we don't have, like, anyone that just, like, lead the thing. There is, like, many people that you will know, like Jenna Charles. You will have, I don't know, like, zacky, Jack, Jay. So so many people, like, from the outside. I guess, like, people are just wondering, like, who the fuck just, like, lead this? So, yeah, I guess probably this is, like, the problem that we start to have. And there is a good project, like DidX here that can probably have this thing.
00:02:54.260 - 00:02:58.596, Speaker C: Like, I don't want to say like, I'm building on Cosmos, but I use the cosmos.
00:02:58.628 - 00:03:35.828, Speaker D: SDK yeah, I think there is analogy I want to take is maybe Cosmos is in the early days of his, of his journey, and he's probably entering some kind of teenager crisis. And whenever you're a parent and you have a teenager, you know, it's complicated, you have a lot of question marks, but eventually you stay optimistic and you know that you're going to go through this. Right. So another analogy which comes to mind, also coming more from the Ethereum side of things and kind of entering into the Cosmo space, is we. I see the cosmos ecosystem as maybe like a city. Maybe. Let's take the example of Paris, since we are in Paris today, thinking of everyone can come to the city.
00:03:35.828 - 00:04:07.108, Speaker D: The city has some very great infrastructure, and then you will have different districts within the city. In France, we call them arrondissement. So maybe some district will be more towards maybe manufacturing. Some other district will be more like entertainment restaurants. And eventually this identity kind of iterate itself and give, like, a sense of identity for the member. So everyone come with your own identity, his own identity within the city. And eventually you get also, like a shared identity.
00:04:07.108 - 00:04:32.356, Speaker D: And this process takes time. I'm not your role optimistic. I'm very optimistic in the industry overall. And when I see this kind of setup where we've got a lot of infrastructure, a lot of different live journeys, people come within the space for different things. People have an infrastructure place. Some of them are thinking of applications, gaming, defi, you name them. I think this kind of patchwork usually works very well.
00:04:32.356 - 00:04:51.560, Speaker D: And we've seen some cities in the world which are really inspiring. I'm thinking of New York. I'm thinking of Paris. I'm thinking of London. I'm thinking of many other asian cities as well. And keeping this kind of inspiration and being good citizens, well, kind of ambassadors of our ecosystem will help solving the identity.
00:04:53.180 - 00:05:24.000, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I love that analogy of a city. Another one I really resonate with is this idea of a bazaar. You know, you have this marketplace of vendors and sellers that are all creating these products. And almost anybody can set up a stall at this bazaar. There's no ticket to entry, really. There's no high cost. And so everyone really, I think, from that perspective, is kind of welcome to set up their own shop and kind of do trade and conduct business with other people and other businesses in this bazaar.
00:05:24.000 - 00:05:37.844, Speaker B: And I think that very low barrier to entry is actually very empowering. As well. So it's a very self organizing self, you know. Yeah. Self organizing system of different actors and different. Yeah, different people.
00:05:37.932 - 00:06:01.480, Speaker A: Yeah, no, that's great. And I think, like you say, it's important that users and the community and people like that can see from your side of, you know, from your point of view and everything. So what I will do is go on to question two. We'll go straight on with it. We'll get straight on with it. So the next question I want to ask is what attracts builders to come and build in cosmos?
00:06:02.260 - 00:06:47.766, Speaker C: Okay, I can take it. So I think, like, the real thing that we are good at, probably not the identity part, but we do have, like, a big framework, like the Cosmos SDK. Let's say it's literally like something that everyone can use and everyone is building on the same. Probably if you go, like, somewhere else, you will have some problem with because you will need to create custom things to just differentiate yourself. It's gonna be hard to just move forward with the others because as it's custom, it creates a lot of problem. In the cosmos SDK, everything is interoperable using the same. There is different version, but actually they are compatible.
00:06:47.766 - 00:07:14.180, Speaker C: So it's pretty okay. So I guess this is the thing that interests them because you have, like, the wall set that is like kind of like Lego. So you just, like, take the little one you want and you build your castle. When you have your castle, you can modify it and just like, build on top of it. And it's just like, pretty easy. Like, you can see like there is like, noble that build, like a. An emission chain for, like any token, like, assets.
00:07:14.180 - 00:07:31.350, Speaker C: So, yeah, you can even, like, make just a trading one, like, for perp or whatever. You can literally build, like, anything. It works because it's flexible. And I guess, like, on the other system, it's less flexible, so more complex, I guess, to build, like, very fast.
00:07:31.730 - 00:07:59.562, Speaker D: I think there is also a trust component. Even though we are all building trust less technologies, the trust of users or trust of developers needs to anchor somewhere. And that's also a little bit of a paradigm in our space. And Cosmos has been out for a long time. The developers are respected. Coming from Ethereum, you've got, like, a great, great reputation also as a Cosmos developer. You've got the SDK, which is also in place and kind of battle tested.
00:07:59.562 - 00:08:10.670, Speaker D: So this trust aspect is also something which is also a great asset and part of the kind of branding assets for the cosmos ecosystem overall.
00:08:11.730 - 00:09:05.544, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think we maybe don't do a good enough job of emphasizing how easy, well, to Adrian's point, it is to build with something like the SDK. You have obviously all of these modules that have been battle tested, that have been well adopted by 50 other projects. If it's something like the bank module or even something new, or like the token factory module, which obviously noble is leveraging. So the fact that you have all of these little building blocks that are pretty much out of the box already extremely efficient and easy to use, is maybe something we don't talk about enough. So from a developer experience, it's relatively easy, I would say. Actually IBC is probably the thing that really gets developers excited and motivated. The fact that you have all of these applications on top of IBC, the fact that of course you could do token transfers, but you could also do things like queries, and you could do different types of applications on top of IBC.
00:09:05.544 - 00:09:16.714, Speaker B: Things like a solo machine and there's 20 different standards, is very inspiring for developers that can all of a sudden IPC to their use case pretty easily.
00:09:16.842 - 00:09:52.600, Speaker C: Yeah. And I guess like about what you're saying, something that is very strong is you have like different chain, they are not like using the same language. You can have JavaScript with hiergoic, for example, you will have like basic rust if you want to use like cOS Wasm, like a smart contract. You can even like make like solidity, like using like some evm, like evmos or whatever. So generally you have like a lot of like different language and I guess it's like more open like to people. If you want to build on ethereum, just learn solidity and you don't have much way to just build something so pretty more open to builders.
00:09:53.060 - 00:09:54.076, Speaker A: Anything else you wanted to ask?
00:09:54.108 - 00:10:26.090, Speaker B: Well, I'm just going back to the question, does cosmos have an identity problem? I mean, maybe it's because of this abundance of choice and freedom of choice that it's really hard to create an identity for your project because like you said, you can be a Java developer, you can be a go developer, a rest developer. So all of a sudden, what's the thing that unites all of them? Sometimes it's kind of hard to make that cohesive and have an identity that unites the entire ecosystem, which actually maybe is not a bad thing. Maybe it's better to have this plurality of identities.
00:10:26.910 - 00:10:39.130, Speaker A: Yeah, no, that's great. Amazing. And then, so carrying on from this conversation, I think question three leads perfectly into it, which is what's needed to bring more builders and adoption into the ecosystem.
00:10:41.590 - 00:12:03.430, Speaker D: I think the stage, in my opinion, of building infrastructure is definitely well on. And the same way you build a city and you want to make sure transportation is great for your city to strive. We have obviously a lot of bridges around us, but what I would love to see is more projects, thinking on how to bring tooling to bring more users, and not thinking of building the foundations and building the infrastructure, but thinking of how do we bring more bridges, more pieces of software to maybe bring people in, making sure there is code available for applications to kind of help them to acquire users and land users more easily. So it's a lot of user experience, it's a lot maybe of affiliate modules, so that whoever builds within the cosmos ecosystem will come with possibly part of an updated SDK. Having an affiliate system to really help all these infrastructure players and new dapps to really acquire new users, I think we've been. The space overall has been shy on really thinking not only about infrastructure, but thinking how do we set our newcomers, new developers, new apps, new dapps, being successful by giving them the tools to acquire users much faster. A little bit like the early Internet, when web two's applications.
00:12:03.430 - 00:12:22.246, Speaker D: We're not really ready to scale customer acquisition. And I think this can be a really strong and impactful contribution to our space, is to get tooling and kind of also shift of mindset in a way. So we just think, ok, how do we make those guys successful in a more long term way?
00:12:22.438 - 00:12:42.672, Speaker A: Yeah, no, you're right. I think because from a user perspective, it can be still quite challenging navigating the space. I think it's one of them where if you know how to use the space, then you're fine within it. But if you're someone new coming into the space, it can be scary and things like that. But do you, I mean, do you guys have anything that you want to add to?
00:12:42.856 - 00:13:29.618, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I'll take a slightly different approach. You know, if you go to an Ethereum conference and talk about Cosmos to, you know, Ethereum people, they will say how Cosmos has the best developers and the best technology, and it's a great. And it's like some of the smartest people they know, but from a business perspective or from a go to market perspective, they don't really know who to talk to. So actually, I think that having more people like this join our ecosystem that can talk to maybe larger institutions, can talk to maybe more of a mainstream audience. To be honest, what consensus did in the early days for Ethereum to have that in cosmos would be pretty amazing. And you don't need one organization to necessarily do that. You can have that function be split across many different projects, including DYDX.
00:13:29.618 - 00:13:57.584, Speaker B: You know, definitely something that noble is focused on. You know, osmosis does a good job of doing this as well. And so really making sure that there is this go to market business focus that's very strategic in nature because the technology I think works and is here and, you know, we have DyTx obviously coming to Cosmos and we're very excited about that. So how do we celebrate that and, you know, make sure that more kind of business audience understands why that happened, how that's happening and what that means for crypto more generally.
00:13:57.632 - 00:14:21.424, Speaker C: So you guys, like, we are kind of like very early, like it's been like only fewer that IBC is like connected. There is like the version that started like to. Yeah, two years, two and a half. Okay. Yeah, so quite not a lot. So it's pretty young. Like people are still like, okay, should I make a cars machine? What's like infrastructure tool I should use.
00:14:21.424 - 00:14:36.336, Speaker C: So there is good tools actually that are building like cosmology is one. There is like some infrastructure, like, let's say like lava building. Like the hair PC. Like for everyone there is like good thing. But the thing is it's pretty new. They are not even live. So it's not.
00:14:36.336 - 00:15:16.212, Speaker C: So imagine like for someone that just for example, like in HRM ecosystem for them, we are lacking liquidity because we are young. We are lacking probably tools. We are lacking infrastructure. So I guess like everyone does like build like quite fast because the framework is more easier and people should just like come and get part of the party. We are here like it's pretty young, but we are making like, just look at around you, there is like lot of builders and it's going very fast. Like in a year we went almost to 100, like chain. So it's going very fast.
00:15:16.396 - 00:15:37.320, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I agree. And actually I wanted to touch on something you just mentioned, which obviously wasn't in anything that we spoke about, but with marketing, is marketing another problem that we have within cosmos? Is it something that we need to collaborate more with other projects so that we can actually draw more people in as a collective?
00:15:38.100 - 00:16:15.770, Speaker B: Oh, God. How long do you have? 14 minutes and 35 seconds. I mean, we're not going to obviously talk about this problem for the next 14 minutes and 30 seconds. But this issue of marketing and how we tell the story of like, what cosmos is is something that has definitely been very challenging. It goes back to our identity problem. The fact that you have, you know, 55 plus Cosmos chains that all have their own perspective of, you know, what cosmos means, how cosmos works. They have their own language, they have their own terminology, which, you know, is both a strength and a challenge.
00:16:15.770 - 00:17:12.990, Speaker B: And so I think that from my perspective, it's really important to align on the basics and, like, align on, you know, certain fundamental truths about what cosmos is. I mean, the fact that we don't even have one name for the Cosmos hub, a lot of people call it cosmos. A lot of people. Some people call it the atom chain, others to call it the Cosmos hub chain. You know, there's like three, four different terms for even how you refer to one entity, which is obviously challenging. I think if we can, like, align on those fundamentals that have a lot of, you know, disagreements, then I think we will be one step forward to having maybe a more cohesive narrative. But, I mean, at the same time, you know, for something like the Cosmos hub, that's important, but maybe for DyDX, that's really not important at all, because why would you necessarily care what the cosmos hub refers itself to? At least if you know how it works and if you know that the atom token is what governs it, maybe that's enough.
00:17:12.990 - 00:17:33.645, Speaker B: And so I think it depends kind of who you're talking to and who your audience is. And that's where the problems lie. I mean, I think, you know, a few weeks ago, Antonio was tweeting, you know, we don't even want to be referred to as a cosmos project necessarily. It's nothing because we don't like cosmos. It's not because we don't use cosmos technology. Of course. That's very well known, and that's all open source.
00:17:33.645 - 00:17:45.389, Speaker B: And, you know, you can, you know, look, look at the code yourself. But from a marketing perspective, they just want to be a good project. So I'm actually very curious to get your perspective on this from a marketing perspective.
00:17:45.549 - 00:18:20.684, Speaker D: DydX has a culture of really kind of reverse engineering everything from the user. It's kind of an open door we are looking at, but it's. This has been kind of really the North Star for the team for a long time. And on the new version of DyDX, built on Cosmos, users will be able to come with their metamask wallet, with their Cosmos native wallet, with ledgers, with wallet, connect with whatever it is. So we kind of do the abstractions, taking the assumption that users don't really want to know all the details below. So some part of the audience are developers. They want to know exactly how the.
00:18:20.684 - 00:19:10.992, Speaker D: The kind of back end works and how it's kind of performing. Some of the subset of the users of DyDx are just coming for the application. So I think we should also kind of adapt the language and making sure we've got, like, different kind of user journeys. Within the cosmos ecosystem, I feel there is clarity on how do you enter the cosmos ecosystem as a developer or as an entrepreneur? We should maybe think and kind of work as good citizens of the cosmos ecosystem on defining the user journey for user. And maybe the user don't really want to know what's happening in the kitchen. They just want to enjoy just high performance applications with high connectivity and ease of use. So, yeah, I think we should look at subsets of audiences and define user journeys.
00:19:10.992 - 00:19:56.698, Speaker D: And that's probably something we should do as an ecosystem within Cosmos and not being shy that we don't have to disclose all the details. Some people don't really care. It comes back to the analogy of a city making sure that if the people want to come to your city by train, you've got enough trains and covering enough kind of cities around so you can become a hub. Same for plane, trains, cars, if people want to sail to the city, just making sure as many doors are open. And if you enter the city as a user, you've got, like, a clear path and everything is laid on. I feel we've been targeting developers for a long time, and it's time to kind of open the kind of playbook for other subsets of users.
00:19:56.874 - 00:20:20.950, Speaker C: Yeah. And just to finish about, like, the marketing part, I guess it's all about, like, we are having, like, something. It's the first time there is something, like, decentralized as cosmos right now. And the thing is, I guess it's all about, like, the culture. And there is, like, so many different culture. Like, if you see there is, like, some wizard, there is, like, some people wearing, like, beer mask or chihuahua mask. Like, there is, like, many different cultures.
00:20:20.950 - 00:20:53.972, Speaker C: So I guess, like, it's pretty hard. Like, we are just, like, defining it. We are trying, like, probably to see, like, which identity we should have. Everyone is, like, trying to do them at their level, but at the global level, it's pretty hard because we don't even know how to make it. It's pretty difficult. Like, imagine a project which is, like, very centralized even for them. I guess, like, they kind of, like, struggle to realize, like, who they are, like, who they should, like, provide to everyone which identity they had.
00:20:53.972 - 00:21:10.576, Speaker C: And we are just, like, here with, like, 100 chain and just like struggling to say, like, well, what should we use as a marketing? And probably I just like think it's, we should just like build like all chains and just see at the end.
00:21:10.648 - 00:21:39.830, Speaker A: No, that's great. That's. Yeah, exactly. So, yeah, I think like you say, because we've got nine minutes left, I'm going to get on with the last question for the panel, which is. So, is IBC the standout narrative for what Cosmos is trying to achieve or is building on the SDK stack? Sovereignty and scalability, you know? Yeah. Which, which one is the, which one is drawing the people in or is it both? Sorry.
00:21:39.910 - 00:22:35.170, Speaker B: I don't know. Maybe to Charles's points it's neither. Maybe we shouldn't be focusing on, you know, is it the SDK or is it IBC or is it tendermint? Maybe it should be more about the philosophy of what Cosmos represents, which is, again, more of this self organizing, highly decentralized, highly sovereign ecosystem of entities and chains and developers and entrepreneurs that all kind of come together, to your point, and just experiment with culture, experiment with applications, experiment with technology in a way that makes them excited and maybe we'll see what comes from that. Is Cosmos more about Defi? Is it more about bad kids? Is it more about attracting the highly successful, highly scalable ethereum applications like DyDX? Let's see. You know, I think that focusing on is, causes IBC or is it really more about the SDK? Maybe misses the forest for the trees a little bit.
00:22:35.630 - 00:23:19.640, Speaker D: In my opinion. The shared security also kind of upcoming feature within the space of Cosmos is something really strong. I think it gives, it gives an opportunity for upcoming projects, upcoming chains, smaller size chain to rely on each other. And that's something which is not available necessarily elsewhere in some other ecosystem. So trying to keep iterating on the kind of marketing for the Cosmo space and telling them, yes, you can be interconnected, that's a great feature. And also if you come as, as young and upcoming, there will be some by design possibilities for you to remain safe and to kind of share security with others. In my opinion, that's a very strong, very strong upcoming feature for the space.
00:23:19.640 - 00:23:27.160, Speaker D: And if it's done right, it's going to enable a lot of new projects and just scale, scale, scale everything.
00:23:27.320 - 00:24:15.330, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess you're right. And basically it's all about like testing, experimenting, as you say, like we are just like at the genesis of everything, like we did ABC like two years ago. We are trying to make it like to the world ecosystem, and even outside the ecosystem because there is, like, for example, like, Picasso with, like, composable that did make, like, the first IBC transfer from Polkadot to Cosmos using Chihuahua chain. And it's all about, like, this. We are experimenting, and I guess we cannot say, like, which one gonna just, like, lead us to where we should go. We just, like, build, I guess, standardization on almost everything. There is, like, as you say, replicate security.
00:24:15.330 - 00:24:44.060, Speaker C: There is, like, another model with mesh security. So it's all about, like, experimenting. But at the end, we will see, like, which one gonna, like, take the lead and you. You cannot, like, I guess, in advance. We are not an oracle. We can just, like, build things and see, like, okay, if there is, like, adoption from it, probably this is the way we should just, like, go straight forward. And probably at this time, we're gonna solve, like, the identity problem if everyone just, like, use the same standard and go forward with it.
00:24:44.060 - 00:24:53.740, Speaker C: But let's see, like, we do have, like, now two consumer chain, like, for the replicate security, for example, and we don't even know if it's gonna work. So let's see.
00:24:53.780 - 00:25:12.696, Speaker B: I mean, noble is at the forefront of replicated security. We're gonna be sharing security with the atom validator set. And will you? We will absolutely. See, this is how challenging marketing is in cosmos. Some people know, some people don't know. And I think that's fine. It's by design, and, you know, it's an experimentation phase.
00:25:12.696 - 00:25:51.734, Speaker B: It's a bootstrapping phase. And, you know, to be able to share security with a $4 billion chain with 175, you know, validators all over the world, it's kind of amazing that you can just out of the box leverage a community so efficiently. So, you know, I think to both Adrian and Charles's point, that's a really strong feature of the causal ecosystem. Just, you know, being a smaller project and being able to succeed, you know, with something like shared security, even though you haven't raised a token, you know, raised money for a token, you haven't gotten those validators on board. It's kind of a very privileged position to be in, to be honest.
00:25:51.902 - 00:26:12.468, Speaker D: And maybe they need to come back to the. The title of the. Of the panel. For me, seeing an identity crisis, if there is one, going on within cosmos, is a very positive signal. If you look at the history of blockchains and our industry, bitcoin got also a lot of drama. Ethereum has not been a rosy journey. There was up and down.
00:26:12.468 - 00:26:51.928, Speaker D: There was leadership crisis, and people kind of reset the whole protocol and the whole things all along the way. So it's just kind of strengthen the ecosystem. So seeing cosmos having a little bit of question marks on many different questions for me is a very strong signal that things essentially will kind of consolidate and there is more decentralization. We don't have to follow one leader or one thing. So it comes a little bit more messy. But eventually it's a strong signal that there is an upcoming very strong foundation and it's going to be long lasting. So I'm very comfortable with the crisis.
00:26:51.928 - 00:26:59.568, Speaker D: I want everyone to navigate this as smoothly and quickly as possible. But that's a strong signal of something solid coming up.
00:26:59.744 - 00:27:24.264, Speaker B: Well, yeah, I mean, I think it's a strong signal because people actually care. If nobody cared, nobody would be here. We wouldn't be in Paris. There wouldn't be five Cosmos events alongside ECC with, you know, probably more than a thousand people in, you know, in total, you know, probably even more than 2000 people in total joining those events. So, I mean, obviously these are strong signals because, yeah, people give us care. They care.
00:27:24.392 - 00:27:59.258, Speaker C: And, yeah, probably to just, like, answer the question, like, as we still have, like, few minutes, I guess, like, probably bad kids is literally, like, the. Their answer. Like, it's just generally, we just look at Twitter. There is only bad kids. Like, I guess, like, builders understand that if you have a bad kids, you're part of, like, the community. And probably there was just, like, a need of an NFT, I guess, probably like this simple because I guess there is, like, some phases and we are, like, at the phases that we want to build. And builders just, like, buy a bad kid.
00:27:59.258 - 00:28:09.640, Speaker C: So we know each other. We say, oh, this is the bad kid. Oh, it's building on top of cosmos. So you just know directly that the guy is using cosmos to build.
00:28:10.580 - 00:28:19.276, Speaker A: No, yeah, that's. Yeah, no, that's great. I think we can call it a day there. I think you've answered everything amazingly, unless you want to add something else.
00:28:19.348 - 00:28:34.574, Speaker B: One more thing. So we did a poll. Does Cosmos have an identity problem? Let's just quickly do it once more for the people that were maybe listening. So raise your hand. Does cosmos have an identity problem? Okay, so, yeah, but actually less. And if. No, yeah, we're progressing.
00:28:34.574 - 00:28:43.806, Speaker B: And if you don't think Cosmos has an identity problem, maybe raise your hand. Okay. See, we have more people on the other side. So I think, you know, that's progress.
00:28:43.878 - 00:28:55.246, Speaker A: No, and that's great. And I think all we can do is just keep educating people and teaching them how to use the space and things like that. So if everyone can give my panel a round of applause. It's been an honor and a pleasure having you on.
00:28:55.278 - 00:28:55.806, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:28:55.918 - 00:28:58.650, Speaker A: And, yeah, I look forward to doing it maybe again in the future.
00:28:59.330 - 00:29:00.170, Speaker C: Thank you. Dude.
00:29:00.250 - 00:29:00.570, Speaker D: Thank you.
