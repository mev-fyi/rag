00:00:09.040 - 00:00:31.290, Speaker A: Hey, guys. Thank you. All right, so, yeah, my name is Fig. I'm one of the co founders of Squid. Hey, and I want to give a talk about bringing people into the cosmos, opening it up to anyone, no matter where they are. If they've got a crypto wallet in the EVM cosmos, they don't even have a crypto wallet. We can do it all in one click.
00:00:31.290 - 00:01:07.742, Speaker A: So multi chain Ux is hard. This is where squid came out of. We came out of a world where there's hundreds of app chains, there's roll ups appearing, there's only going to be more and more. And it's scary. Every time you go to a new bridge, you don't know if you're going to get scammed. It's scary going to a new website you don't know how to use. We just need one standardized way of getting tokens around the ecosystem and just being able to use your money a little bit like stripe would be for web two, you just go to a website, you know you can pay just because you have a credit card, even if it's in a different country.
00:01:07.742 - 00:01:57.100, Speaker A: If you've with a different bank in your country, then you can still use your money. And also, the cosmos is a really specific case of this, because between EVM, we have metamask, everyone has metamask, and maybe you can make your way over to a new chain. But then if in the cosmos, you have to download a new wallet, and then you have to learn a ton of new things from there. You have to get gas, you have to learn about IBC. And so that's what we do at squid. We're using Axela, IBC, we do Dex aggregation, and we have an intent style system so that you can do any action in one click, anywhere in one click. So we do that with smart contracts.
00:01:57.100 - 00:02:43.522, Speaker A: We have an API and SDK and a backend, and we've got a set of front end components which make it really easy to build applications. And it's a bit like the stripe PayPal thing, I said, where you just, you have your app and you can add payment in, no matter what the product is, whether it's staking nfts, if you just want to onboard people into your bank. And our killer feature is the swaps between EVM and Cosmos. We're really excited about this. It's not live on Mainnet publicly, but we've got it working in Mainnet. It should come out any moment now. You'll be able to swap from Arbitrum, USCC into atom on any chain in the cosmos in one click, you'll be able to get eth to stake DTH and neutron.
00:02:43.522 - 00:03:20.274, Speaker A: You'll be able to go between the cosmos as well. Any token in the cosmos to any other token in the cosmos in one click. Everything's in a single click. If we want to compete with web two Ux, then we're going to need everything to just be in one click. Every new click that the user does, we potentially lose their attention, lose their decision to buy the product or enter the application. We've got contract calls across chains and we've got this boost feature which yesterday you would have seen all the cups, the speed boost. Speed boost.
00:03:20.274 - 00:03:53.198, Speaker A: Squid cups. So between EVM chains, it's not so simple as IBC. IBC is really fast, and generally the user experience is pretty good going between IBC chains. But going from Arbitrum, for example, it's 20 minutes. You have to wait for the finality on arbitrum, or same with Ethereum, it's 15 minutes. Polygon, it's six. And we've got a feature which brings everything down into 20 seconds so that you can go between any chain, call, any contract in one click in under 20 seconds.
00:03:53.198 - 00:04:19.098, Speaker A: I think once we get there and the prices are good, which for us they are, we've got a competitive experience. With web two. We do python winding, which is the problem where if you've got atom on osmosis, you can't transfer it directly to another chain. You have to go back to the Cosmos hub, then to the destination chain. And we do all that in one click. Using the packet forward middleware. We monitor execution for you so you can see when something is completed.
00:04:19.098 - 00:05:01.518, Speaker A: And you can get gas as well. Because when you're going to a new chain, you always need to get a new gas token so that you can actually use your tokens once you're over there. And we've made a simple, simple button in the widgets and on the API, it's a simple parameter where if you set it to true, then you get a tiny bit of gas and you can use your assets once you arrive. We're connected to twelve EVM chains. A bunch more coming. And currently 30 chains in the cosmos, soon to be basically every chain in the cosmos we'll be supporting, which I'm really excited about. We do the EVM de Cosmos swaps via Axla's GMP.
00:05:01.518 - 00:05:36.488, Speaker A: Axla is a Cosmos chain, which allows you to call a contract on a cosmos chain from the EVM world, or vice versa. So we're able to compose liquidity, we're able to. Squid doesn't use any of its own liquidity. We just use the existing liquidity that other teams have built up, and they've got their own Amm technology. So we can plug into osmosis and sushiswap in the same transaction. And it's really exciting because we can scale so quickly. We can go to 80 chains, like we said, without needing to build up liquidity on 80 different chains.
00:05:36.488 - 00:06:12.770, Speaker A: We don't need to offer incentives, we just integrate with everyone. And also, osmosis is benefiting from all the volume that we're generating. So all of our users going through osmosis will hopefully bring fees to the network. Same with Sushiswap curve. And in the cosmos, we use IBC between chains, and it's possible because of two IBC middlewares. One of them is called the packet forward middleware developed by Strangelove. And we've been working with chains to install this wherever it isn't installed yet, but it's getting fairly good adoption now.
00:06:12.770 - 00:06:54.500, Speaker A: And that allows us to go, say, from atom on me, we can send it back to Cosmos hub and then to osmosis all in the same click. And we can also call a contract on osmosis. So you can send atom to osmosis from a me and deposit into Mars in one click, for example. And we do the contract call on the end using IBC hooks. And that's something developed by osmosis which lets you call a cosmwasm contract using an IBC transfer. And we've been working with other teams like UMI to develop hooks for their chain if they don't support cosmosm. So we can still get these one click flows even if they don't have smart contracts on their chain.
00:06:54.500 - 00:07:45.502, Speaker A: So you can do all these amazing use cases with squid. I'm really excited to be building some of them. Now we've got you can buy nfts in one click across chain with any token that's going live on the EVM side with decent. We're working with Stargaze as well, so that when all the cross VM wallets go live, you'll be able to buy a bad kid using any EVM token, say, from your metamask, from your leap wallet, from your XDFI wallet, from Cosmo Station and GameFi. Obviously the same thing as nfts staking across chain. And the wallet piece I'll speak about later. So this is our swap widget, really easy to use and really easy to install takes like 20 minutes to install it.
00:07:45.502 - 00:08:33.550, Speaker A: And you can customize it in whatever color or even fonts that you like. It's integrated in 50 different front ends across the Ethereum world and in the Cosmos world, including pancakeswap, quickswap, stellar swap. I think the kalk guys have installed it. We've got it in Cosmo station leap and we've just modified it so you can now build a staking widget really quickly. So now in a matter of hours, you've got a staking product and you can allow people to buy that staking product from any chain in one click. So you can see here we've got Ping is a lending protocol on Kava actually EVM world. And you can pay with whatever token you like and you receive staked Axel USDC.
00:08:33.550 - 00:08:58.536, Speaker A: So that's. You'll be getting yelled on your Axel USDC in one click. And we just this week integrated with Cardo. So super excited about this. This is the biggest chain of all, the fiat world. And in terms of onboarding people to the cosmos, this is, I think there's a huge unlock. So we'll be able to get all of these things.
00:08:58.536 - 00:09:32.058, Speaker A: I've mentioned buying nfts, staking, just getting tokens, getting gas, all using a credit card, using cardo. And the user doesn't even have to know that squid's involved. It just happens in the background, like magic. For osmosis. Currently you have to install from EVM, sorry, Ethereum, sorry, not install, but you have to deposit from Ethereum. And now you'll be able to deposit USDC from Arbitrum, from Avalanche, from Polygon. And also we'll be reducing the fees, which I think a lot of people have been sensitive about.
00:09:32.058 - 00:10:15.202, Speaker A: It's really expensive to go from Ethereum and we can bring it down to in the hopefully cents, maybe tens of cents to onboard and off board from osmosis. These are the wallets I was talking about. This is the missing piece, I think, now. So once we got the wallet piece right, you'll be able to move between chains without even knowing it. So squid in the background, moving the assets around, calling contracts, you've got the wallets managing, signing on different chains. And we'll have a user experience which is really competitive with web two and hopefully ready for the next phase of users to come in. If you want to develop with Squid, these are our docs can develop with the SDK or the API.
00:10:15.202 - 00:10:40.490, Speaker A: There's some examples in there on buying nfts, across chain, Cosmos examples as well. Going between Cosmos chains staking and this is our widget. As I said, it's only 20 minutes worth just having a look at. If you're a front end dev, just try installing it and customizing it a little bit. And that's all. So if anyone has any questions, I think I've got. I got a bit of time.
00:10:40.490 - 00:10:45.500, Speaker A: Give you a minute. Just put your hand up if you have anything.
00:10:46.360 - 00:10:51.232, Speaker B: When Cosmo is back to EVM, when are we going interoperable both ways?
00:10:51.336 - 00:11:32.090, Speaker A: This is when the swaps go live, so I'm not giving public dates. But let's say in the next month, you'll be able to go back to the EVM as well. Yeah, I think having both ways is going to be important for arbitrageurs to start keeping prices really efficient. Should be driving some volume across and increasing the interest in the cosmos as well. And then also for Cardo's use case, you'll be able to off board. Imagine you'll be able to, with your Cosmos wallet, pay at a store in the real world. So use your assets really quickly off board into your bank account or off board into a payment.
00:11:32.090 - 00:11:38.550, Speaker A: All right, I'll leave it there. Thanks a lot for having me. Who.
