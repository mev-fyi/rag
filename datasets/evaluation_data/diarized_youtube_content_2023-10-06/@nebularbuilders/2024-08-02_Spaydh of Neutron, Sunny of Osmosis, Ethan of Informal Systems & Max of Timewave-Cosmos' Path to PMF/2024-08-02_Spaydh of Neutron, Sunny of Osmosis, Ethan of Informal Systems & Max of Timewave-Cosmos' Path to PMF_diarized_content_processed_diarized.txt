00:00:00.360 - 00:00:22.530, Speaker A: I'm going to introduce my speakers. We have sunny from osmosis, spade from neutron, Ethan from informal systems, and Max from Valence. Time wave valence. Both of them. Cool. So Seb asked me to make this panel as controversial as possible. So I'm going to ask spicy questions to my guests.
00:00:22.530 - 00:00:43.882, Speaker A: I'm going to start with you, Ethan, since we have. We know each other and it's okay. I actually want to actually, you know, I woke up this morning, I checked prices on Coingecko, and atom is number 36 right now in terms of market cap. And, you know, we know that 36. 36.
00:00:43.906 - 00:00:44.590, Speaker B: We're up.
00:00:46.170 - 00:01:06.600, Speaker A: We are from 40, maybe, but not from. Not from 20, where he was last year, and not from ten when it launched. So I want to ask you, basically, given that cosmos came up with app chains, fast, finality, interoperability, all of that, we came with it first. What went wrong?
00:01:10.140 - 00:01:58.650, Speaker B: Y'all ready for this? No, no, no. What went wrong? I mean, there's a lot of things we could say. I mean, one is, you know, we suffered a significant organizational crisis early on, shortly after the hub launched, and that severely impacted the hub's ability to. It actually didn't have a team for a long time until the last year or two. And so I tend to attribute a lot of causal value to just not having a team for years on end. But, you know, it's more than that, right? To some extent, I think the cosmos culture has been very focused on the technology, the philosophy, the ideas. We've invested a lot less in, like marketing, business development.
00:01:58.650 - 00:02:35.200, Speaker B: We do a lot of great things, but people don't necessarily know about them. We don't have as great a culture of writing and communicating about what we're up to, clearly. So sometimes other ecosystems, they kind of get our ideas by talking to us in person, and then maybe they do a better job of communicating them, things like that. I think the other thing potentially is sort of. Maybe a deeper irony is sovereignty itself. Right? And in some sense, the success of the cosmos ecosystem has come from the sovereign, interoperable thesis. It allows everyone to sort of make it their own.
00:02:35.200 - 00:03:07.126, Speaker B: But sovereignty is expensive, right? And it comes with this downside that this proliferation of tokens can't necessarily easily sustain itself depending on market conditions and liquidity and all this stuff. And so arguably, there could be and should be an opportunity for the ecosystem to kind of come back together around the cosmos hub and sort of defragment and reconverge. And that might start to address some of these issues. So we can talk a bit more about the role of the hub in the, the future and stuff, but I guess those are some of the things, maybe.
00:03:07.278 - 00:03:11.110, Speaker A: Yeah, we said we fragmented, and I think one team that fragmented is osmosis.
00:03:11.270 - 00:03:13.170, Speaker B: Like, you guys, sunny bailed hard.
00:03:13.670 - 00:03:25.970, Speaker A: Sonny kind of went into his own way with Dev, and you guys built osmosis. Do you feel like the hub would have been more successful if everyone had stayed together and you would be working on the hub right now?
00:03:28.110 - 00:03:45.228, Speaker C: Yeah, probably. I think if the team structure of AIB probably stuck together, probably would have, like, stated AIB longer and, like, the osmosis, like, we were planning on building, like, Dex products and stuff on the Cosmos hubs. So those probably would have ended up getting built.
00:03:45.324 - 00:03:49.560, Speaker A: Why do you feel like you guys chose to go your own way?
00:03:51.980 - 00:04:18.708, Speaker C: We, like, honestly, like, the team needed, like, tokens to incentivize, like, liquidity. And I think at the time, Cosmos hub, like, didn't really have a proper direction. Yeah, I think, like, you know, when you launch a new team, you usually need a new incentive structure. Right. And, like, I think after all, the atom that was meant for the dev teams were, like, stuck in this, like, defunct entity of AIB that no one had access to.
00:04:18.884 - 00:04:20.080, Speaker B: And they're still there.
00:04:21.460 - 00:04:45.318, Speaker A: You know a little bit about that spade. So you are, I think you. Correct me if I'm wrong, you are originally part of P two. P right. That the team that built Lido. So Lido is one of the most successful Ethereum projects. You still chose to come to Cosmos at a time where Lido was already successful and Cosmos wasn't that successful or at least less successful when neutron launched.
00:04:45.318 - 00:04:57.830, Speaker A: Can you, can you explain a little bit what went into your decision to launch neutron on Cosmos? There was already rollups in 2022. At least people were talking about rollups. Why did you guys went this way and choose Cosmos?
00:04:59.250 - 00:05:06.986, Speaker D: Yeah, first, I don't know that I agree with the statement that Cosmos wasn't successful. I think obviously, the terra crowd, it was less hyped.
00:05:07.018 - 00:05:10.570, Speaker A: At least there was less liquidity. There was less people talking about it.
00:05:10.650 - 00:06:13.080, Speaker D: Yeah, true. I think Cosmos has always had an interesting edge on both technology and so, like, intellectual capital and social capital, there's a lot of fragmentation and such. But that is an incredible resource. And so we kind of felt like, as a team that has had a lot of experience bringing product to market, more so than perhaps doing fundamental research and such, we were kind of like a good fit for the ecosystem of providing an avenue for a lot of these technologies being developed and pushed in the ecosystem to be taken to market kind of in that we could play a kind of like a different role in the ecosystem and potentially help solving part of the challenges that the ecosystem has had with distribution. So that was kind of like one of the appealing things. Also, while PGP is very global from the perspective of the industry, PGP is working on Ethereum, working on cosmos in a bunch of ecosystem as a validator. Our team specifically was always historically tied to cosmos.
00:06:13.080 - 00:07:02.530, Speaker D: Andre implemented a randomness beacon. Our CTO implemented a randomness beacon in tendermint in 2018 or something. We built some of the first proto version of an NFT cross chain marketplace and something stupid before NFTs were in the interchange. So we know these technologies pretty well. And this was an occasion to do our part in a different way, I don't think compared to, for example, teams like osmosis, I don't think neutron has contributed nearly as much to the SDK that then gets distributed the rest of the ecosystem. But what we've tried to do is bring a new sort of mentality of like, hey, at the end of the day distribution. It's not just marketing and talking in BD, it's also just thinking about these things as products with an end user in mind and kind of trying to bridge that gap, I guess.
00:07:04.310 - 00:07:38.270, Speaker A: Max now, so you're one of the new crop of contributors, right? I think you worked on the Atom 2.0 white paper for like thousands of hours, maybe unpaid hours that ultimately resulted into a no, rejected by governance. What made you, you know, first, what made you want to work thousands of unpaid hours on a white paper? And then why did you choose to stay in cosmos after, you know, the community said no to all of your good work?
00:07:39.940 - 00:08:12.074, Speaker E: I like this question. So my journey to Cosmos started about two and a half years ago. I was like, okay, I'm ready to start working on something that I feel uniquely well qualified to do. I was jamming with my friend at Olympusdao and I thought the idea of algorithmic monetary policy was really cool. And so I started building a cosmosm implementation of that. And Zucky heard about this and he's like, hey, Max, how would you like to build a this not as like this standalone thing, but as part of the hub? I was like, oh, wow, that'd be really cool. So he introduces me to a bunch of the core Cosmos guys.
00:08:12.074 - 00:08:41.738, Speaker E: They're like, oh, this is really cool. How'd you like to add this to the cosmos sub whitepaper? I was like, oh, neat. I had no idea what I was telling myself about for. And so that Olympus style thing turned into the interchange allocator. And I got super bullish about this because you have IBC's, individuals can send assets from one place, send it back, but there's a whole huge design space that this tech stack is uniquely well suited for, which is protocol to protocol deals. And so I got super excited about that. Together with interchange scheduler, it was just me.
00:08:41.738 - 00:09:03.846, Speaker E: This power combo that gave these asymmetric advantages, like that was a winning strategy. And I was down to get behind that and put in the hours necessary to articulate that vision. I was not involved at all in the actual politics of getting it passed. I finished the paper. I took some time, time off. There's all sorts of drama that happened to this date. I've not read the threat comments for the property, too.
00:09:03.846 - 00:09:59.466, Speaker E: I'm not going there. And when that proposal failed, I know there were a lot of bad vibes amongst a lot of people, but for me, I was super bullish because, like, oh, fantastic. I now have an excuse not to build this specifically for the hub, but an interchain version, something that from the get go, will work for all chains and be this primitive that will introduce opportunities for chains to pursue positive sum activity together and change some of this toxicity. And it was really great to see that in action, where osmosis and neutron potentially had some competition. And instead of going down this negative sum path, they did a bilateral pol deal. And now it's relatively small in the scheme of things, but it's definitely a step towards a more collaborative, more conducive thing that I would like to see happen more often.
00:09:59.578 - 00:10:05.990, Speaker A: And you never thought, okay, maybe it's better to take this idea of intern allocator and make it happen for the op stack.
00:10:06.770 - 00:10:48.090, Speaker E: No, this is the best tech to make interchain happen. What I really. So what you see on Twitter can be a little misleading. What I really like are the values that have led a lot of people here, which is, I think most people in this room will agree that sovereignty and interoperability are really great values that we can get behind. I really liked that the people in this ecosystem were doing the hard work to build all these public goods, to build all this infrastructure that had only made sense if this was a very long term endeavor. And long term is also something that I want to be thinking, to have long term relationships with the humans in my life. So long term mattered a lot to me.
00:10:48.090 - 00:11:20.922, Speaker E: And so, yeah, there's never a question in my mind that this was the right place to build it. And I would love the op people and ETH and Solana. I think a big part about finding PMF for people building this tech stack is not just looking at ourselves as some lone island of Cosmos chains, but really looking at the entire interchain and figuring out ways for us to be of value, not just to each other, but to bitcoin. L two s, eth, l two s, Solana Daos all across the interchange, talking.
00:11:20.946 - 00:11:42.680, Speaker A: About looking at each other. This panel is about product market fit. Sunny, I was wondering, from your perspective, which Cosmos chain do you think have the most product market fit? And I'm not saying the best team, the best idea. I'm saying the most product market. Fitzhen, can I say Terra Terra is.
00:11:43.940 - 00:11:45.420, Speaker D: Oh, come on, that's too easy.
00:11:45.460 - 00:11:50.268, Speaker A: Well, you could say that a year ago, maybe. Now, I don't know if they have.
00:11:50.284 - 00:11:55.480, Speaker C: The most product market fit for sure right now. Probably dydx.
00:11:56.220 - 00:11:59.292, Speaker A: DyDX is the app chain that you think has the most product market with.
00:11:59.476 - 00:12:00.196, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:12:00.348 - 00:12:04.008, Speaker A: Who are the two others that you can think of off the top of your head?
00:12:04.184 - 00:12:06.416, Speaker C: Does hyper liquid count as a cosmos tree?
00:12:06.488 - 00:12:08.008, Speaker A: Hyper liquid. I don't know.
00:12:08.024 - 00:12:08.296, Speaker B: Why?
00:12:08.368 - 00:12:09.580, Speaker A: Why wouldn't they come?
00:12:09.880 - 00:12:11.744, Speaker C: They're not really the Cosmos Sek stack.
00:12:11.832 - 00:12:12.600, Speaker D: The tendermint. Right.
00:12:12.640 - 00:12:14.896, Speaker C: The tendermint based accounts.
00:12:15.008 - 00:12:17.112, Speaker A: Anything that uses any part of the Cosmos stack.
00:12:17.216 - 00:12:18.952, Speaker D: Well, also, like, how many nuts.
00:12:18.976 - 00:12:19.088, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:12:19.104 - 00:12:20.840, Speaker B: What about Polygon BSC?
00:12:20.960 - 00:12:21.780, Speaker A: You could.
00:12:24.320 - 00:12:27.340, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say probably do. IDX. Hyper liquid osmosis.
00:12:28.530 - 00:12:35.474, Speaker A: Same question for. Basically, this question is for all of you guys, your top three chain in cosmos with the most product market fit for use, paid.
00:12:35.562 - 00:12:39.810, Speaker C: Actually, no, sorry. I'll remove hyper liquid. Let's say it doesn't count. Probably Thor chain.
00:12:39.970 - 00:12:48.250, Speaker A: Thor chain, yeah. For use, paid. And if you can justify a little bit why you think the three, the.
00:12:48.250 - 00:12:49.290, Speaker D: Most product market fit, right.
00:12:49.330 - 00:12:58.360, Speaker A: The most product market fit in the mic? Ethan, if you have an answer, you can go ahead. In the meantime.
00:13:00.100 - 00:13:27.990, Speaker D: I'd say. I don't know that I have three. I think in the three, not 30. In the very narrow conception of the full stack, identifies with cosmos and whatever. I would say Cosmos is definitely one. Everybody, including me, swaps on it very frequently. I think stargaze is also pretty high up there, and I think so if the token is the product, I think Cosmos is actually also.
00:13:27.990 - 00:13:36.054, Speaker D: Cosmos updates are also not too bad, but there's clearly challenges there as well. But, yeah, for the token and staking.
00:13:36.182 - 00:13:38.850, Speaker A: I'm glad we see the cosmos serve in the top three here.
00:13:39.710 - 00:13:42.090, Speaker D: Surprise plot twist.
00:13:43.670 - 00:14:01.306, Speaker B: Yeah, I was probably going to say stargaze, maybe. Osmosis polygon seems to be maybe, I don't know. Bear chain hasn't launched yet, but there seems to be quite a lot of bear baddies out there.
00:14:01.338 - 00:14:04.430, Speaker A: It's not about hype, it's about product market having subsegments.
00:14:05.250 - 00:14:23.160, Speaker B: That's true, actually. Real usability. I mean, the thing is, I feel like there's things being used at levels that I just don't know about. Probably something that's using the Cosmos stack in a way that I'm not even aware of, that has the most product market fit. What that might be, I don't know.
00:14:23.700 - 00:14:35.280, Speaker E: Yeah, I don't know if I have that much more to add. I mean, it depends on what we're also defining as the market. Neutron was a great fit for what timewave wants to build. It's a great place for Phalanx protocol.
00:14:37.340 - 00:14:42.690, Speaker A: Market is the number of users, number of cosmos users that benefit from that product. And actually users.
00:14:42.860 - 00:14:46.210, Speaker D: Actually, I have a question for you. How do you define product market fit?
00:14:46.870 - 00:14:48.610, Speaker A: No, I'm asking the questions here.
00:14:49.030 - 00:15:12.126, Speaker D: I mean, come on. I'll wager a definition. To me, the definition of product market fit is whatever the user is. It might be developers, it might be actual djns or whatever. It's a state of. There is a product that is so good that the users just keep coming back to it. The reason I mentioned Stargaze is right now there's a bunch of people who want to trade bad kids.
00:15:12.126 - 00:15:44.350, Speaker D: They just come back to check the floor and do it and whatever, but there's multiple levels, I would say. I think Neutron has a long way to go for me to be boldly claiming in front of all of you that it fully achieved product market fit or whatever, but we do see a bunch of people who were maybe six months ago, they would have asked us, hey, give us $2 million to launch on the chain. But now they're like, ok, we're launching. What can we do together to make it cool? I think that's a good sign that you're getting there, right? So, yeah, that's my definition of product market fit, if that helps the conversation.
00:15:44.430 - 00:16:01.770, Speaker A: Okay, let's use a spade definition, but let's change the questions. Let's ask which chains, which high profile chain have the least product market fit in Cosmos? I'm going to go the other way so that Sonny has time to think.
00:16:04.150 - 00:16:11.050, Speaker E: I'm not going to name names. So if I choose a name at Valence we're really new. We haven't found product market fit. We're still looking for it.
00:16:11.790 - 00:16:32.686, Speaker A: I'll give an answer. Also, to make everyone comfortable at informal, we're building cycles, and cycles is a way to clear depth across people that upload them. And I think it's a genius idea, but I think we are probably one of the projects that have the least amount of product market fit and watch the hardest road ahead in terms of building these networks.
00:16:32.718 - 00:16:35.286, Speaker B: Someone needs to join us to help beat Tebow down on this one.
00:16:35.318 - 00:16:37.410, Speaker A: Well, we are hiring a good bd person.
00:16:38.010 - 00:16:42.658, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, you guys are pre product, right? Like, even if there was a market, you wouldn't be able to, like, the.
00:16:42.674 - 00:16:52.306, Speaker A: Further, let's say the question is the further away from PMF and obviously being pre product doesn't help, but in general, we have a long road ahead in order to build the network's effect.
00:16:52.418 - 00:16:57.410, Speaker D: So then I would say, like, the chain that I haven't yet decided to build has definitely not product market.
00:16:57.530 - 00:17:03.514, Speaker A: That's why I say, that's why I say high profile, like chains that already have a name in the ecosystem. What do you think, Ethan?
00:17:03.562 - 00:17:29.250, Speaker B: Well, I mean, maybe to disarm a little bit so we could try to have a more honest conversation. Arguably. ICSV one, the cosmos hub, it had some product market fit with neutron and stride early on, which was really valuable, but then it kind of became clear that it wouldn't have the level of product market fit that we wanted. Right. And that's interesting to hear you say that. Adam kind of had it to some extent.
00:17:30.120 - 00:17:55.920, Speaker D: I mean, when you look at like, there's a, you know, the market for atoms product is like people who want to launch chains. And like right now in the industry, there's so much separation there. All of the Ras service providers, all of the roll up frameworks, everybody is catering to that niche now. There's tremendous competition, but like, Adam at least can claim that. Hey, hey, we have two live consumer and we have like, what, five, six or something like that are. That are in the pipeline.
00:17:55.960 - 00:17:56.160, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:56.200 - 00:17:58.020, Speaker B: And the two live are actually awesome.
00:17:59.300 - 00:18:00.924, Speaker D: You said it, but I would tend to agree.
00:18:01.012 - 00:18:03.284, Speaker B: Usable. They actually have some product market fit.
00:18:03.332 - 00:18:05.080, Speaker D: Yeah, slashing is a thing.
00:18:06.300 - 00:18:13.360, Speaker E: Okay, if I had to add something, maybe CW 20 tokens. Yeah. Dealing with the technical debt from that mess.
00:18:14.260 - 00:18:19.492, Speaker A: Well, you guys are cheating. I want actual names, not your product. Also, because that sounds like you're cheating. So I want.
00:18:19.596 - 00:18:44.486, Speaker B: So one of my favorite projects in the space is anoma. Love the team, love what they're doing. They had a conference here a week ago, but I'm not sure anyone really understands. I think Innoma is seeing the future far out and they've got the right vision and they're going there. I have no idea if they have any product market fit or if they're anywhere close to that. I hope they do.
00:18:44.558 - 00:18:48.270, Speaker A: But yeah, one of Informa's biggest partner.
00:18:48.390 - 00:18:59.362, Speaker B: One of our biggest partners. I mean, yeah, we work very closely with them, but we invested in them. Very bullish, but it's big brain kind of stuff.
00:18:59.506 - 00:19:01.794, Speaker A: The more innovative you are, the often.
00:19:01.842 - 00:19:32.592, Speaker B: The harder it is. And I think they realize that too. I think they're trying to figure out how to actually adapt to the market conditions of Ethereum. It seems like there's been a bit of a pivot. Like, oh, you can use this kind of intent solving technology specifically in the Ethereum world where the solver markets are and so on. So it's interesting to see what starts as a big brain idea, narrow in on trying to find a specific product market fit and then zoom back out. So it'll be interesting to keep watching that because if they make it work, I mean, they could change kind of everything.
00:19:32.656 - 00:20:17.074, Speaker D: So yeah, I think I'd go for like. So a project that I have a lot of sympathy for that we actually like. The early ideas for neutron looked very similar to this, but we made a different choice and I think that informed kind of like the direction is dimension. So dimension basically the idea is you have a chain and then you can use it to spin up new roll ups and each of these roll ups are your app specific and domain. The idea is super cool. I'll make it one click to launch my own roll up and whatever arthesis when we were thinking about this because for us it was a way for applications on neutron to eventually graduate into having their own app specific domain. They took a different route whereby they said we're going to do this first and people are going to go straight directly there.
00:20:17.074 - 00:20:38.550, Speaker D: And I think that was a tough circumstance because my thesis is that you need to bootstrap network effects first and then that flows back up into the layers basically. I think right now it's very tough, but I do think that actually there's an in for them. I think meme coin roll ups might actually be perfect PMF for solutions like that. Actually. We'll see if that plays out.
00:20:40.860 - 00:20:44.440, Speaker B: It's crazy that we're building all this infrastructure and everyone just wants to trade memes.
00:20:49.220 - 00:20:51.120, Speaker C: I don't understand fetch AI.
00:20:52.100 - 00:20:52.436, Speaker A: What?
00:20:52.468 - 00:21:01.100, Speaker C: Sorry, I don't understand fetch AI. I don't understand what it does. I'm not sure if anyone does. And so maybe that's like a high profile one that I don't see.
00:21:01.140 - 00:21:03.460, Speaker D: It's pretty high on market cap rankings, right?
00:21:03.500 - 00:21:04.780, Speaker C: It's like top 30.
00:21:04.900 - 00:21:05.600, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:21:08.230 - 00:21:10.370, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's a good answer.
00:21:10.790 - 00:21:12.614, Speaker B: Okay, so is this spicy enough?
00:21:12.742 - 00:21:14.814, Speaker A: It was pretty good. We got something.
00:21:14.942 - 00:21:16.090, Speaker B: What do you guys think?
00:21:18.470 - 00:21:44.042, Speaker C: Sorry, I think Greg might be here. I don't know if he is, but, like, as an akash, like, you know, advisor and everything, I think that Akash has a lot of supply of, like, compute. There's not a lot of demand, not a lot of usage on the demand side, which is, I guess you could say it hasn't found the PMF on the actual usage side yet. Even though there's a lot of supply.
00:21:44.186 - 00:21:50.874, Speaker B: Do you think there's something specific that's in the way of that? There seems to be a huge demand for GPU's in the world, right.
00:21:51.002 - 00:22:24.826, Speaker C: I think it's mostly a dev tooling thing where it's like, okay, yeah. I think the same reason people pay a little bit more to plug into Google's like, Google clouds like GPU clusters because it's just easier. Right. You're doing everything else there as well. It's easier to connect to that than it is to save a little bit on cost to plug to the decentralized thing. And I think people just don't want to the reliability. So the people who are very cost sensitive are the people who are doing massive jobs.
00:22:24.826 - 00:22:42.386, Speaker C: Right. But then they are. They care a lot more about the reliability and want to like, send it to Google or something rather than like, send it to something decentralized that maybe has less of a brand name. This is just my general take. Not on Akash alone.
00:22:42.418 - 00:22:54.310, Speaker B: But it's great that Adrian only just arrived. We were talking about you very positively.
00:22:56.210 - 00:22:56.714, Speaker A: Okay.
00:22:56.762 - 00:23:17.550, Speaker C: I think this is true for, like, deepen in general, right? It's like, you know, all, like even like, you know, hive mind on Solana, right. They've been getting a lot of like, mapping data, but I don't see anyone using it for anything. And like, I don't know, it's interesting to start a category deep in as, like, I haven't seen. I haven't seen get product market fit from the demand side.
00:23:18.570 - 00:24:07.414, Speaker D: But just. Just as a note to what you were saying, sunny, like, I think what. What you were saying is super interesting because it's actually the actual proper way, in my opinion, of thinking about these things, you were like, okay, here is the user. They have some job, whatever, they need some compute, and they care about X and Y. If they are cost sensitive, then they care about reliability. You built a Persona of a user, and then you were like, okay, how do I match the offering to that? I think this is actually my key takeaway is that in cosmos we always go from the technologies we have access to into what can I build with this? And never from the other way around, what are the actual users and their actual needs, and then how can we solve it? And I think that's a mindset that we need to. So a culture basically, that we need to grow and distribute in the ecosystem.
00:24:07.414 - 00:24:10.050, Speaker D: Because no PMF without that.
00:24:10.750 - 00:24:51.728, Speaker B: It's true. The flip side of that is the mRNA vaccine, right? They worked on this platform that apparently there was no demand for. And they just like chewed glass to do this like technology first thing, because they were like, this is the right approach and it's going to be necessary at some point. And then at some point the socioeconomic condition sort of showed up. And so, you know, I think about that a lot because it's clear that like we have been kind of technology first and we kind of struggle with that. It's like, what do the users, you know, the users don't need any of this shit, but at some point it seems like they will. But if you're always just betting on that, most often you're probably just going to fail.
00:24:51.728 - 00:25:02.740, Speaker B: Versus the traditional startup route is do anything to just find product market fit first, no matter what you have to use, and then fix your tech debt and so on. So there's definitely a lot of lessons to learn from that.
00:25:03.760 - 00:25:39.520, Speaker A: Talking about fixing our tech, you mentioned ICS 1.0 as potentially one of the product that didn't have product market Fitzhen. Now the Cosmos hub has come up with ICS 2.0, and it also has a new vision. And so what I would like here is that Ethan explains that vision for everyone in the audience as a project that was still mentioned once by Spade. But in general, people associate the hub as a product that is struggling to find PMF. So if you can explain that, and then I want to have everyone here on the panel critique that vision, because I know all of you guys are very involved with the Cosmos hub and very in tune with what it needs.
00:25:40.660 - 00:26:37.844, Speaker B: Yeah, the vision for the hub is to make it the best place to launch a chain and to just simply be that. And there's a lot that was, in a sense, the vision for Cosmos to use the stack to be the best place to launch a chain. But there's a lot that goes into launching that's not just around the technology stack, but you need the operators, you need the security, you need certain services, you need access to liquidity, you need support, you need larger community integrations with other chains and so on. And, and it's possible to provide all of those things for yourselves as an independent sovereign chain. But we really want to, we're positioning the hub to be the thing that can offer kind of all of that in an optimal way. And of course, it is a saturated market. Now, a lot of other projects are focused on restaking and launching chains and so on, but the hub kind of has a unique position and a unique opportunity to work with the existing set of Cosmos chains start to bring them back into and under the hubs umbrella and to be a platform for launching new chains, leveraging the hub security.
00:26:37.844 - 00:27:11.766, Speaker B: And a big part of that is this new platform we're building, decentralized auction platform called Hydro, which is designed to allow. Also we'll be leveraging timewave to decentralize and automate liquidity provision from community pools into different application platforms. And access to liquidity is a big issue that many chains are struggling with. Gave a whole talk on this at modular early today called defund the dealers. You should check that out at some point. But Hydro is designed to help solve that problem and help make the hub the best place to launch a chain as part of that solution.
00:27:11.958 - 00:27:16.570, Speaker A: So sunny, you've been very critical of the hub in the past. What do you think about that new vision?
00:27:19.790 - 00:28:11.938, Speaker C: I think if your goal is to make it as easy as to launch a chain as possible, I think what you actually need to, I do think that people want, prefer to have like more of a roll up stack where it's like, you know, here you seem to be trying to subsidize the costs as much as possible, but I feel like rollups have figured out how to like, you know, provide the chain at like a lower cost. Right. Because you're not paying as much for like the security, because you don't need, instead of like having economic security all, you're just moving as more and more of the stuff into cryptographic security and stuff. So I feel like to make the hub be the best place to launch a chain, you need to figure out how to make it be a place for roll ups to settle to either. That means turning the causes SDK into more of a roll up stack or whatever way you figure how to do that?
00:28:12.074 - 00:28:24.930, Speaker B: Well, I would say that roll ups are chains too, and there is something coming in that regard to make the hub a place to launch roll ups and to align more closely with Celestia as a DA layer.
00:28:26.390 - 00:28:30.250, Speaker A: What do you mean subsidize? We're not subsidizing anything from the Cosmos website.
00:28:30.630 - 00:29:09.610, Speaker D: I'll maybe take this point. When you're launching a new chain, it's not the same consensus process. The same node runs a new chain. The validator has to spin up a new server, run the node there. And that means that there's like the marginal cost of every new chain is pretty high, right, compared to a roll up stack, whereby maybe you still have the same infra cost, but you're running much fewer nodes. And so as a result of this, it's going to be difficult to compete with conduit who can afford to make you pay ten k per year and call it a day because there's so little actual infrastructure that's involved in the process. In the Cosmos hub, it's 180 validators.
00:29:09.610 - 00:30:08.974, Speaker D: Maybe with opt in you can be okay with fewer validators and whatever, but still that infrared cost is going to be higher. And I think the problem is it's an engineering question, but it's also a social engineering question in the sense that validators as a business, they kind of look not just as a, here's my infra cost and here's the profit margin that I want to make. And as long as the chain can provide that, I'm fine. Most of the validator game today is managing opportunity cost of which chains I'm going to focus on my work on. The idea is that when I go and try to be a launch partner for a chain of, I'm expecting that the token, you know, the project will do it do well, the token will go up, the inflation will be way much more, basically. And so, like, there's a bit of a, it's almost like an investment, except instead of putting money, you're putting your time in this, right? And so ICs will not provide this because like, there's very few, like, you know, very few consumer chains in the future will be okay to like, just provide the same kind of upside because that differential is part of the value add of ICs, actually. Right.
00:30:08.974 - 00:30:48.776, Speaker D: And so, like, effectively, you're asking validators to operate on a more sort of like service contract type of thing, whereas they tend to operate more so on a investing my time type of model for their, for their business economics, right. And so this is not something that can't be solved. But that's almost more social engineering than technical engineering. To find validators that are okay to go big on economies of scale. And get their process of spinning up new nodes and keeping up with their release schedule and whatever. Really, really efficient. And just accepting to make a margin on whatever that actually costs to run, if that makes sense.
00:30:48.776 - 00:31:01.010, Speaker D: And I think that has been one of the things that we thought about less. So when ICs became a thing. And that is continuing to be an area of friction in the process that makes sense.
00:31:01.470 - 00:31:26.518, Speaker E: Yeah, we mentioned a few things here. So just to clarify, a few things. So timewave, we're the Devco behind valence, which is the protocol. Hydro is going to be that auction platform. That helps express the intent of the hub to deploy liquidity in a certain place. And then valence is the protocol that will actually get that liquidity from point a to point b. In terms of this strategy, I think that this is the.
00:31:26.518 - 00:31:37.798, Speaker E: The hub's best hope. Eigen layer really came in and ate the shared security lunch. And so the hub needs a way to differentiate its security offering relative to Eigen layer. In Babylon.
00:31:37.854 - 00:31:38.730, Speaker B: Cook dinner?
00:31:39.110 - 00:32:02.532, Speaker E: Yeah, cook dinner. Sharing liquidity is a really good way to differentiate. If you're choosing between restaking protocols and one is giving you ten mil in liquidity and the other one's giving you zero, it's a much easier choice for you. People will often choose to their restaking provider. Based on what alignment they want. And what people actually want from alignment is liquidity. So giving people a way to tap directly into liquidity is very effective.
00:32:02.532 - 00:32:18.642, Speaker E: And bitcoin is not going to do this. They're not going to print more than 21 million. Ethereum is almost certainly not going to do this. But the hub has an opportunity, especially to differentiate itself also with its on chain governance, to really lean into this liquidity deployment and make it rain atom, which is the hub's core product.
00:32:18.756 - 00:32:22.110, Speaker D: As a maybe spicy and like comment.
00:32:22.150 - 00:32:28.702, Speaker A: To this, we're actually up on time. I don't know if we can get a little bit more time. Spicy takes our load.
00:32:28.726 - 00:33:09.522, Speaker D: So, yeah, so I agree with all you just said. And in fact, we've been discussing this for years. I do think though, that the most ngmi thing about this entire thing is that like, the strategy is 15 different things coming together to form this very nuanced, kind of like offering. And I think that's so super Ngmi. I think if the hub wants to win at ICS, it should probably try and focus all of its efforts that have all of its core teams onto that product. And I understand that some of these offerings are complementary and stuff, but I think clarity, focus is something that the hub has traditionally not had, and I think that is a big part of its failure to really become what it could have done. And so my take on this is.
00:33:09.546 - 00:33:16.830, Speaker B: Like, you know, the hub didn't have a team for, like, five years. The lack of focus was the distribution of that. Now that it does have a team, it has one team, it has four teams.
00:33:16.910 - 00:33:20.190, Speaker A: Focus is the best place to launch a chain, and I think we're going to conclude with that.
00:33:20.230 - 00:33:36.270, Speaker D: Yeah, there's idro, there's, let's launch a roll up as a roll up as a service chain on top of it and stuff. All of these things are really cool, but I think there should be a group of tightly correlated. I think the core team should be tightly correlated together and focused on one thing.
00:33:36.390 - 00:33:37.518, Speaker A: Best place to launch a chain.
00:33:37.574 - 00:33:39.410, Speaker D: Yeah, that's the focus.
00:33:40.300 - 00:33:43.572, Speaker B: The problem is there's a lot of things involved in launching a chain.
00:33:43.716 - 00:33:55.716, Speaker D: Sure. But, like, you know, find one angle and do that better than everybody else. Like, I can. Well, okay, Eigen layer is a bad example. They're doing 15 different things, but they also raised billions of dollars, so they can afford to.
00:33:55.788 - 00:33:58.620, Speaker A: Okay, guys, hot take, not spicy.
