00:00:00.200 - 00:01:03.580, Speaker A: To be really cool, actually. I'm really glad I could get all of you on a space today to talk about the future of the Cosmos hub. Now, just for context, you know, this space was sort of inspired by Elijah's Cosmos hub forum post from, I guess, like two weeks ago now, something like that. A note on the future of the Cosmos hub. This got me thinking that there are these sort of opposing forces or opposing ideologies in this space. And it's helpful to get everybody talking about the issues that we have in the interchange, specifically, I think, around the Cosmos hub and hopefully set a path forward to progress and to move the hub forward. So we'll just wait for a couple more people to come in.
00:01:03.580 - 00:01:28.390, Speaker A: Brian, you're still not a speaker. Somehow that's not working. Maybe try requesting to speak again. Brian. No. Are you still, are you still in the sun or are you back in Berlin?
00:01:28.850 - 00:01:29.482, Speaker B: I'm back.
00:01:29.546 - 00:01:30.018, Speaker C: I'm back.
00:01:30.074 - 00:01:39.114, Speaker B: Yeah. Back in Berlin. It seems like made the right choice because it was super bad weather in Berlin and I came back and now it's, everything's good. Moving from one holiday to another.
00:01:39.202 - 00:02:02.034, Speaker A: Yeah, it's amazingly hot right now in central western Europe. Yeah. So I don't know. I don't know if Spade will join us. He had mentioned that he joins well, but if he joins, I'll bring him up. So, yeah, let's get started. I mean, there's a couple things I want to talk about today, and maybe we can start with, with your post, Elijah.
00:02:02.034 - 00:02:38.954, Speaker A: So you wrote this post on the cosmopolitan forum. I pinned it up here in the tweet. Oh, there was, there's spade. So I pins up here. And the idea, I think, of this post, you emphasize that in the startup world, companies need to have focus, and a lot of companies fail because they don't have focus. And there's been lots of books about this. Like the one thing, zero to one, I think, are books that sort of touch on this topic of focus.
00:02:38.954 - 00:02:51.750, Speaker A: And you argued that the hub needs a clear vision and a clear objective, which is something I totally agree with. So I wonder if you could unpack this post and what inspired you to write it? What are some of the key points you're making here?
00:02:52.250 - 00:03:55.536, Speaker D: Yeah, sure. So I guess, like, what inspired me is I through, through building in cosmos, especially within the AZ around the hub. I kept finding that, like, I was having the same conversations with people over and over again. You know, it's like people like spade and effort capital and some other people. And it seemed like there was this common theme where it's like, there's like, this group of people who really wants to come up with this next chapter for the hub, right? Like, how can we either push for existing visions for the hub or, you know, recreate new ones and, you know, before I even, like, insert my bias on, like, whether I think it makes sense to strengthen old ones or, you know, create new ones, you know, new visions or, you know, strengthen old visions, you know, I think it was just apparent that we were doing neither as a, as a community. And I think there was, like, a lot of anxiety by people or people where it was like, you know, if we are doing neither, then where exactly are we going? Because we're certainly not moving forward. Right.
00:03:55.536 - 00:04:43.636, Speaker D: We're sort of like, staying stagnant and everyone was throwing out ideas and everyone had a different opinion and everyone had a different belief. And I realized, like, you know, like, one of my thoughts was, you know, me or whoever going and having 100 different conversations with 100 different people, like, is not like, the way to solve it, right? Like, it probably takes, you know, a forum post, you know, at least a start where, you know, everyone can sort of have their input and start getting engaged and sharing their beliefs. And I, you know, going through the process of, like, rough consensus in public, I think is like the important first step to actually, like, finding that. And so, yeah, I mean, none of the ideas were, like, particularly original. It was. It was just, you know, sort of an aggregation of a lot of the conversations that I'd been having and a lot of the stuff I had been reading. And, you know, I'm relatively new as well.
00:04:43.636 - 00:05:20.362, Speaker D: So I would say, like, you know, there's a balance between me having fresh eyes, but also me not having, like, so much context. And so, like, I've been picking up the context where we're helpful and figuring things out. So, yeah, that's a little bit of the inspiration. And then, yeah, the rest of the post is, like, fairly opinionated. And I know different people have different takes on, like, different interventions proposed. Like, I think, you know, the way I see it is like, I'm not so tribal or religious about any one intervention being the right intervention. I think that just the conversation getting going is the most important part.
00:05:20.362 - 00:05:48.116, Speaker D: And obviously, I do have my beliefs, but my beliefs are always subject to change, and I'm happy to hear what everyone else thinks. If they have a good point, then I'll listen. I'm open minded, super excited that we're actually talking about this now in public. And people like Brian and Noam have joined who I didn't get to speak to or connect with before writing that post. And it's been awesome too, to just see the outreach and get connected with so many people that I wasn't connected with before. So. Yeah.
00:05:48.116 - 00:05:51.760, Speaker D: Really excited about this conversation.
00:05:53.620 - 00:05:53.972, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:53.996 - 00:06:44.720, Speaker A: And I think there's one thing that you mentioned that's kind of underrated here, is that you haven't been in the space super long, but you've been in this space long enough to not have all the context, but at least, but also have a pretty clear sort of vision on where the key issues are. I think, like, you know, from that perspective, like, it really shines through in this, in this book, in this post. It's like, it's super clear. I think, like what you're, what you're like how you describe the problem, right. Of like, you know, there is a lack of focus and we don't necessarily have like a clear vision and a clear objective for the, for the hub. And I think, you know, this is something that like lots of people have been talking about in the space for a while, but no one's actually like sort of come out and like written a post about like, you know, this is an issue we need to talk about. And I think that's the really important first step to getting to some outcome.
00:06:44.720 - 00:07:14.060, Speaker A: We need to start somewhere. Maybe I can open it up to the panel now. If any reactions on that, on the post, happy to hear those. But also I'd like to maybe open it up and ask what is, in all of your opinion, the state of the hub and what are the biggest wins that we've accomplished in the last couple of years and where also the biggest fails or the biggest losses that, you know, we as a community should reflect on.
00:07:21.480 - 00:08:16.188, Speaker E: I'll take a quick stab at it. But I mean, I think as a community, and it's a useful defense mechanism, we've been very focused on, like what, you know, is not fixed, is not finalized, is not perfect, needs work and such. But still, over the last year or so, the hub has launched a completely groundbreaking feature before most of its future competition, like eigen layer and such. And it works basically. There's already two chains running on that. So I think there has been major achievements along the way, but we've focused a lot on what doesn't go right, which is helpful because it helps identify the issues. Where I completely agree with Elijah is that leads us to focus on the issues themselves rather than sometimes their cause.
00:08:16.188 - 00:08:43.570, Speaker E: And I think the argument that before we start trying to tweak these things, we really need to just understand as a community what exactly is the vision for what the hub wants to be uniquely positioned and best at, because depending on what we settle on, then what we should be doing next can be widely different. So that's probably the conversation that I'm most excited about.
00:08:48.750 - 00:09:26.454, Speaker C: Yeah, I can jump in as well, I think if you sort of look back. So first, maybe the losses, what did not go so well? I think one thing that originally the Cosmos hub was seen as this crucial thing, one thing was the interoperability of other ecosystems. So basically roll around IBC, maybe routing IBC packets, maybe doing some sort of bridges to other ecosystems. And I think obviously that didn't really happen. I think because there just wasn't like a team fully focused on that.
00:09:26.502 - 00:09:26.686, Speaker D: Right.
00:09:26.718 - 00:09:47.558, Speaker C: And we had briefly the gravity bridge for Ethereum, and that was like one thing in this bucket that didn't work. And then, of course, in the end, you've had projects like Axelar that we were just fully focused on, that execute it better. And maybe this wasn't the role for.
00:09:47.574 - 00:09:48.254, Speaker F: The hop to play.
00:09:48.302 - 00:10:10.506, Speaker C: I don't know, but I think that was one thing. And, you know, obviously, for example, gravity Dex was also something that didn't work out in terms of what has worked. I mean, I think it's pretty clear. Like, you know, what did you pronounce it? Spade or.
00:10:10.578 - 00:10:12.110, Speaker E: Yeah, actually, precisely.
00:10:12.810 - 00:10:37.948, Speaker C: Spade. Okay, great. Yeah. What spade just mentioned, I think the whole ics that has. I mean, I think in my view, it's in a little bit of a sort of. It's in a good state, right? It's in a good state in the sense that, you know, there's really high quality projects that are interested in it and they want to deploy as interchange secured chains. And, you know, it's been done successfully.
00:10:37.948 - 00:11:45.562, Speaker C: So I think there's really a lot there already that can be built on. And at the same time, I think what's lacking a little bit is a sort of long term, more holistic vision of what that should look like. So we have, for example, a course, one we've also written some posts around the economics of. So, like, some issues are, okay, how do you price chains, right, if they now are secured by the cosmos hub? Like, how much does that cost and how is that determined? Like, right now, you just have projects sort of proposed whatever seems reasonable to them, and then people vote on it, but it doesn't seem like the best approach. And then I think you have challenges, like, okay, is this scalable, if validators, are forced to validate those changes that the right way. So I feel like there's a lot of work that should be done around interchange security to really make it something that can scale to some extent. I guess it's always going to be a question if it's going to scale ultimately, or if we could scale to like, you know, I know dozens of chains, 100 chains, or like, who knows? But I think there is.
00:11:45.626 - 00:11:46.026, Speaker A: That's.
00:11:46.098 - 00:12:04.666, Speaker C: That is the thing where I feel like there's the best product market fit and it's definitely something where I feel like investment should go in to really improve that particular division, work out the economics, a lot of processes around it, and where you can see a lot of upside for the hub.
00:12:04.818 - 00:13:21.060, Speaker E: Yeah, I couldn't agree more. I think, you know, when you ship such large milestone, there's a temptation to go to the next big thing. But actually what probably produces the best ROI is that now that the hub has launched this new and unique product, it might not be as fashionable and as interesting in development updates basically, but actually going down on the details and ironing out of replicated security so that it works both on the alignment perspective on the revenue, on the pricing, on all of these items, whereby we have something that currently works but is a bit rough on the edges. Let's say there's still some training wheels mechanisms that are in place currently, like the soft opt out. There are still concerns about profitability of stuff, and we know that that's a question of time and adoption, but it's also a question of standardizing, refining the mechanisms as well as the social processes and the frameworks for how we think about these things and how we structure these deals. Extra, extra. And I think there's a whole lot to be done both on the governance and on the technical side here.
00:13:21.060 - 00:14:39.810, Speaker E: Another thing that I think we tend to forget as a huge achievement is the fact that cosmos hub, like the entire cosmos ecosystem, but Cosmos hub, despite all of the imperfections with governance in general, has succeeded in making on chain governance. And this is something that now today, the roll up ecosystems on Ethereum are starting to realize that, hey, we have this bridge contract that we need to figure out how to manage. And currently everything runs on a trusted multisig that is owned by the company that developed the roll up or what have you. And I think a lot of them will eventually find their ways to on chain governance, essentially. And so this is something where security, governance and potentially money are three things that I think are the unique value propositions and domains of expertise that the cosmos hub has and that I think it should double down on so that it can become sort of like a thought leader as well as potentially a service provider or what have you, so that it can build businesses around this. Because I think those are three areas where it is uniquely positioned to be ahead of any competition and where I believe there will be tremendous demand and need in the industry as a whole.
00:14:42.310 - 00:16:07.802, Speaker D: Just to say something really quickly about outside looking in. If you look back at the other two things that were mentioned, which were gravity Dex and the gravity bridge or the bridge, you know, I think maybe it was in part to not having a focused team on it, like a single team on it. I think that's probably part of the reason, maybe like another corollary reason that's related to that is what Spade said, which is when you ship a major milestone, there's this desire to, like, bounce off that success in a bunch of different directions and horizontally scale, when in reality, like, there's, you know, a lot of, you know, you can't have, like, a build it, and they will come mentality in crypto because someone else will raise a venture round, they'll build it and they'll hyper focus on that one thing and they'll be much better because they'll develop a significant amount of expertise tailoring the exact product that needs to be future proof for that thing. I think if you look at the examples that were provided earlier, part of it was not having a team on it. And a related reason was that when you don't have a team on it, when you don't have resources being focused and directed into it. Right. You know, in the case of the gravity Dex, there's a team like osmosis that raises some money via token or whatever, that's hyper focused on that and is doubling down on that vision and is iterating on it for years and years afterwards, or, you know, in the case of Axel, right.
00:16:07.802 - 00:16:25.620, Speaker D: You have a team that has money, has funding. Let's focus on that. Focus on that product, iterating it on it, exploring that design space. So I think, yeah, to Spade's point, I think the big mistake would be to think that the hub needs to do 100 things right now instead of, like, really, really nailing the things that it has going for it.
00:16:27.400 - 00:17:09.988, Speaker G: Yeah, I couldn't agree more. Just to add to this a little bit further, I think you look at the history of the Cosmos hub, you look at the history of Adam in particular. Despite all the drama, despite not having a single team that's dedicated to building out a roadmap beyond. We've always known that the hub is going to do some type of shared security service provision. But despite all the, I guess, negatives, I think historically, people on the outside looking in see, and even people within the cosmos ecosystem see, the atom has still, like naturally become the shelling point. The cosmos hub has already always been seen as the thing that other chains are compared to. Not because you needed the atom for gas on other chains.
00:17:09.988 - 00:17:54.980, Speaker G: It just naturally, you know, became that for the community as like this natural shelling point. And I think the community has kind of shown time and time again, despite all the drama. Like, it's a really passionate community. We've had great teams like Elijah and Nick from duality leave the Ethereum ecosystem to specifically build in the atom economic zone to align with the cosmos hub. I think because they see the potential, what the hub has and what the atom as an asset is. And I think forward looking now that we have this shared security service, now the hub has to lean into this more. Like Spade said, like Brian and Elijah said, this service provision is unlike what rollups are to Ethereum.
00:17:54.980 - 00:18:40.016, Speaker G: It's unlike what Eigen layer is. This is the first time, and I said this on other calls, too, this is the first time to my knowledge, that there's a bilateral agreement between chains that they're aligning with one another. Roll ups align with Ethereum, but Ethereum doesn't align with rollups. It's incredibly neutral base layer. It's not aligning with anything. This is the first time with on chain governance, with security, with potentially atom as money and as the reserve asset of the ecosystem, that both chains bilaterally and all these chains surrounding the cosmos hub have skin in the game to see each other succeeded. And I think there's a lot of great things that can come out of that, like the Ethereum ecosystem and other ecosystems as well.
00:18:40.016 - 00:19:28.920, Speaker G: There's not really a lot of sticky capital. It's mostly mercenary capital going from one liquidity mining program to the other, jumping to the newest narrative. And I think that's mostly because it's centered around individuals, which is great. It allows for like a free market and allows for a lot of iteration and innovation in Ethereum. But I think at the same time, I struggle to see Ethereum building out like a long term sustainable economy without having some type of mutually agreed upon vision between individual chains and between individual communities. And I think the atom economic zone, leveraging on chain governance leading into it further can create something really special and different than what other shared security agreements or service providers already offer and already what you see in the Ethereum and roll up space.
00:19:32.030 - 00:19:35.286, Speaker A: This is really. Noam, do you want to jump in real quick?
00:19:35.398 - 00:20:08.930, Speaker B: Yeah, I think everything has pretty much been said, but the way I just want to frame it, it's just like, it's very similar to a company. The original white paper is just sort of, it was making some assumptions on how things would play out with the cosmos ecosystem, and it didn't. Right. It's ordinarily when a company comes up with an idea and then they try to build their product, and then they realize when they go to market, they don't have product market fit, or it doesn't really work, and they have to pivot. And generally, the founding team is capable of doing that. Or if it's a good company, the founding team is capable of doing it. But the problem is, with the cosmos, we never really had a founding team that sort of kept working on it.
00:20:08.930 - 00:21:18.260, Speaker B: And so just to summarize some of the stuff that's been said right now, it's like, I fully agree with all of this stuff, and it's great that now everyone is sort of contributing in a very, very meaningful way. But then to get back to Elijah's post, which I thought was one of the most interesting parts here, is that we have a lot of really good ideas. What we don't really have in place yet is the mechanism to get there and to actually make sure these things can get built and then done and that we can agree to these things, but also the trust in the way that we're spending money and in the way that we're doing accountability and doing all these other things to make sure that the money is being spent well, one of the things that's still there, when you read through the forums and you read everyone's replies and then go on Twitter, people are still, some people are cautious and careful, and they're worried about how the community pool is being spent and all these things. So it's really just about solving sort of, like, some of these trust issues at first. And then, of course, also in parallel, working on some of these great ideas, and some are being done already and, like, initially secure. And I'm super happy to see how this is all moving along. So, yeah, we got a lot of work ahead of us.
00:21:18.810 - 00:23:31.540, Speaker A: Yeah, these are amazing insights. I think there's, like, three things that I'm hearing here. One is a need for a cohesive vision where there is kind of like, we're never going to achieve I think, like perfect consensus, but at least directionally, a vision that most people in the space, at least like stakeholders and, and large token holders, can agree on capacity for execution in the form of building up the software necessary to execute on that vision, adhering to some sort of a roadmap, and then finally some accountability and specifically in terms of funding and how the cosmos hub and maybe other institutions, and we'll talk about the ICF, can fund the software development. I feel like those are the three things that we're pointing to here and would apply normally to any startup where there's a founding team and people who are responsible for seeing that vision through. In the case of the hub and in the case of the cosmic ecosystem generally, I think one of the things that sets it apart is the fact that it is such a decentralized ecosystem compared to ecosystems like Ethereum on this spectrum. And maybe like at the other end, we have ecosystems like Polygon and Solana. How do we arrive? Do we need a little bit more, do we need some actors or institutions to take on a little bit more of a decisionary role in order to move forward in a more efficient way? Or I, or is the decentralization of the cosmos ecosystem really the status quo that we want to maintain and we just kind of try to figure out as we go, do we want to go a little bit more centralized for more efficiency, or do we want to stay in the current status quo as a fairly decentralized ecosystem where you also have to deal with the consequences of that?
00:23:32.340 - 00:24:32.818, Speaker D: I think there's like, you know, it's worth pointing out that I don't think, like, having a, having focused institutions is like a compliment or, you know, is it not a compliment is a supplement for decentralization. Right? Like, I think, like, ethereum sort of puts this on display really well, where it's like, there is certainly an incredibly qualified, brilliant institution that decides, not, not necessarily even decides, discusses and explores different directions for the roadmap in public and sets the vision. Yep, exactly. And so, you know, I think, I think that, you know, to the point that, like, I think it's, you know, the goal should be to weaponize decentralization when decentralization is incredibly useful. And then where institutions are useful, you know, weaponize that as well. I don't mean, like, weaponize in like, a violent way. I mean, like, you know, mobilize in, like, the most efficient, you know, productive way.
00:24:32.818 - 00:25:30.800, Speaker D: I think, like, you know, small groups of people are probably really good at iterating on ideas very quickly. They're good at actually shipping things, right? Whereas like if, you know, there's like a hundred, you know, thousand, you know, atom holders and each of them are contributing a line of code like nothing's ever going to get shipped, nothing's ever going to get done, no ideas are ever going to be valid. But what, you know, I think a decentralized community is really, really good for as it's really, really good for holding people accountable. I think it's really, really good for initial brainstorming. I think it's really, really good. I think it's really, really good in terms of like, actually, you know, in terms of growing emission. I think the idea, one of the Ethereum's biggest strengths is the fact that there's such social decentralization in terms of there's people who hold, use, believe in ethereum's mission all around the world in all different places.
00:25:30.800 - 00:26:19.140, Speaker D: And so in a sense they have missionaries in every country, in every continent, et cetera, et cetera. So I think we can unpack that and whatever. I don't know if now is the Twitter space to do it. It probably needs a whole blog post or a whole Twitter space to really unpack. But I think it's really about like leaning into the things that decentralization is really, really good at and then finding ways to incorporate points of, you know, I don't even want to say institutional input, but, you know, because I think that has a bad connotation, but points of like really, you know, smaller teams dedicated to more specific visions into that framework such that, right, like when that's useful, that happens and when the, you know, more, more decentralized things need to happen or things that benefit from decentralization need to happen. Right? Like then those things have the space to happen. So I'd love to see them used as compliments instead of supplements.
00:26:20.640 - 00:26:54.914, Speaker G: 100% agree. Just to summarize, I think you can find a middle ground. The decentralized cosmos, hub community and maybe even the wider atom economic zone like the community itself should be able to hold accountable smaller teams that have subject matter expertise in particular areas. The community at the end of the day should have power over the purse strings at any point. They feel like that they're not being served. The token holders of data token holders are not being served appropriately by specific teams that are focused on specific initiatives. They should be able to pull funding.
00:26:54.914 - 00:27:31.260, Speaker G: They should be able to change the team. If another team comes up, we should make sure that there's voting in place. Maybe a yearly or biannual basis to make sure that we're holding them accountable, make sure that these development teams have skin in the game to create a larger vision that ultimately the wider community feels comfortable with. I think it's not necessarily centralization versus decentralization. It's more just finding, I think, decentralized accountability or holding a centralized team accountable in a decentralized way. But what Elijah said was really what I fully agree with as well.
00:27:33.260 - 00:28:45.552, Speaker B: I think what's interesting and what you see in crypto happen, and this sort of how I see the future take place when it comes to these trust minimized environments, is that the people who are actually ending up using the protocol are the ones that could have the stake in some sense. And the question is, how do we facilitate something like this? If you look at something like, I don't know, Babylon Babylon wants to secure other networks, but bitcoin security to do a bunch of other stuff, in my opinion, the people lending that security in some sense are the stakeholders. And so the question is then also for me is like, what is this community that's voting on what's happening? And yes, that's token holders, but who are the token holders? Right now, the stakeholders that people use in network is relatively small. We have neutron, we have stride, and other protocols are building on it. But in a thriving atom economic zone, I expect that to be a large ecosystem of different players. And I think. I guess that's also part of what we're thinking about how to facilitate that, is how do we make sure that those stakeholders will actually have a stake in the network and it's not just everyone, but also the people who actually depend on it.
00:28:45.552 - 00:29:03.420, Speaker B: Like neutron, for example. They depend on the Atom hub. So how do we make sure that their voice is heard potentially through token swaps or whatever. But how do we do that? And I think that's a really interesting question because it doesn't necessarily have to be tokens only. And I think that's where committees and multisigs and subdivisions become very interesting as well.
00:29:05.040 - 00:29:08.260, Speaker E: Yeah, sorry, go on, Brian.
00:29:09.320 - 00:29:10.936, Speaker A: Brian would love your take on this.
00:29:11.128 - 00:29:11.832, Speaker F: Yeah, sure.
00:29:11.896 - 00:30:27.684, Speaker C: I mean, I feel this is one of the hardest problems in, you know, maybe in crypto in general. And, you know, when it comes to, like, decentralized coordination wherever, you know, especially when it comes to aligning on a vision, articulating division and then getting behind it, I feel like the Atom 2.0 paper and governance vote was a great example, you know, where you ended up having, you know, this very large number of authors with this, you know, big big sort of set of diverse ideas and putting into one paper, and then everybody votes on it. And then, you know, different people object to different things. And in the end, it's sort of in this limbo and really hard to, you know, it was hard to move on from that. I think what I, what I'm pretty bullish on is for the cosmos hub and governance to, you know, learn how to deploy funding effectively, you know, sort of given some vision. So now you're, okay, we say we're going to fund a, B and C, and they're going to report and maybe some multisig and some tranches.
00:30:27.684 - 00:31:28.240, Speaker C: And I'm sure there's just a lot of things still to be figured out. But I think when it comes to articulating this, okay, division of where to go, this is a really, I think that's a very hard problem. And a little bit challenge here is that sort of the original Cosmos vision, you know, I mean, in a way, it's amazing how far cosmos has gone and how much has been accomplished given the, you know, the falling apart of the original company and how everything was split across, like, so many different organizations. And I think to a huge extent that is because the cosmos vision was very clear and it made a lot of sense. And I think for the Cosmos hub, you know, we just didn't have, and I think still don't quite have a vision that has the same degree of clarity and where there's alignment on it. And I think that is one of the most important things to create. And it's really hard to do, I think, where we are now.
00:31:28.240 - 00:31:30.760, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:31:32.580 - 00:32:40.548, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree. And, you know, to your point, I think that, I think that, like, Adam 2.0, at least how I've read it, I think it was like, there's a lot of great ideas. But when I read it, like, it sort of just felt like a lot of the great ideas, it felt like maybe the vision was like, doing something, like there were so many different things that it didn't feel like there was, like, one point to. It felt like there was, like maybe a lot of different visions or a lot of different roles or objectives that the hub should be playing simultaneously. And I think, like, you know, to your point, you know, that, that I think was the reason why it was really, really hard to find consensus on it is because, like, every individual could find, like, one thing or, you know, a few things that, like, they felt were getting, like, Trojan horsed into, into the proposal and, and, like, with some of the things that were being proposed like, it also maybe feels like there should have been like a very, very. There should have been white papers for each individual thing in there, potentially.
00:32:40.548 - 00:33:08.820, Speaker D: And there should have been this exploration process with that. And some of the ideas, once again, were phenomenal. I respect the hell out of everyone who wrote that paper, but I agree. I think the way to do it this time is to do it iteratively. It's take pieces, do this public discovery process with them, you know, really, really nail them down, and then, like, you know, you know, add, you know, add things incrementally instead of all at once. And I think we'll see, like, people get behind that mission if we could do that effectively.
00:33:10.360 - 00:33:43.320, Speaker A: Yeah, I think let's. Let's maybe not rehash Adam 2.0. That conversation has been had so many times and we've only got about 25 minutes left and I've got so many more questions I'd like to ask here. And then hopefully also because I think that it's also important as part of this conversation is to bring in, you know, the voice of the community and get input from. From people in here. So if we have a couple of minutes at the end, like, they open it up for questions or comments. So, you know, noam, you've been arguing for better governments and treasury management.
00:33:43.320 - 00:33:56.080, Speaker A: You know, we've been talking. I don't know if you've made public this thing you're writing or. I don't know if I could talk about it. But I know you're ahead.
00:33:56.810 - 00:33:59.110, Speaker B: There's no secrets. Yeah, yeah.
00:33:59.450 - 00:34:00.270, Speaker A: All right.
00:34:00.810 - 00:34:02.066, Speaker B: Yeah, go ahead. Sorry.
00:34:02.178 - 00:34:25.200, Speaker A: So you're writing a post about Adam, treasury management and governance. So, like, maybe explain what you see as potential solutions here, at least for incentive alignment with. With consumer chains. I think it's a really important topic that we certainly, like, once this is published, we should also be talking about probably on another spaces.
00:34:26.020 - 00:34:49.364, Speaker B: Yeah. So, yeah, this week I wrote, like, basically when Elijah did this post. So let's take a step back. We got a grant right from the atom accelerator. Now for binary builders to do work for the cosmos hub. We have a few different things in scope. One of them is this idea of this thing that we're calling the atom alignment treasury.
00:34:49.364 - 00:35:49.630, Speaker B: And it's really something to address, like a few use cases that we're seeing and we're expecting also to blow up actually a lot more. So one of them is the stride sort of like allocation of atom for liquidity provision. Right. So 450,000 Adam, if I remember correctly, was basically borrowed from the hub and put to use on astroport to provide liquidity for administrators. This is a really great use case of how to use your money on the hub because the money earns a return of interest and it's still under our control. So that's one of those use cases where it's like, oh, that's super interesting, but what's really hard is that how do we keep doing this? Are we going to have all these multi sigs maintaining this? It's a bit tricky to do that manually all the time. It's not trustless.
00:35:49.630 - 00:36:10.642, Speaker B: It's also, there's a bunch of different limitations to it. And then similarly we have this problem of incentive alignment between, for example, neutron and cosmos hub or stripe or any of the other protocols that it might be launching. And maybe there's a desire to do a token swap. I would think there is. Let's talk about that.
00:36:10.666 - 00:36:11.270, Speaker A: Maybe.
00:36:11.570 - 00:37:01.636, Speaker B: But there's no mechanism to really sort of like work on this. And so basically when I saw Elijah's post, and I've been writing a lot already since then and also in the interest of having that process be very transparent, this week I'll be posting a relatively long document or just a forum post sort of highlighting how to tackle some of these issues and how to manage them. I think it's way too much to go into detail in this space. I don't think that's really necessary. But it's really just a question of like, hey, these are some of the objectives that I think would be valuable and that we, I think we can all agree on, you know, growth for the atom, economic zone, financial alignment and these kinds of things. And here's the suggestion of how to do that with these, and these mechanisms. And here are some decisions that need to be made if we are okay with that and how to build it.
00:37:01.636 - 00:37:18.556, Speaker B: And implementation wise, I leave it out sort of still relatively high level and stuff. Yeah, that's going to go up this week right now. I'm still collecting a little bit of feedback from folks. Yeah, I don't know how much in detail you want to go into it. It's quite a lot into it.
00:37:18.748 - 00:37:27.440, Speaker A: If you're going to put it up this week, then I guess we'll just wait for. Because I think it's nearly ready and people can just read it when it comes out.
00:37:28.820 - 00:37:43.056, Speaker B: I think maybe the more important conversation is just, and I'm curious to hear from Spade, how do you see that incentive alignment and sort of like strong building, strong connections between the hub that are, you know, represented and maybe some sort of financial stake?
00:37:43.208 - 00:38:17.368, Speaker E: Yeah, definitely. I would love to comment on this because as someone who's been spending a good. Like, you know, the better part of year and a half or something on this specific problem now. Like, it feels to me like where we have failed me personally and members of our team and of our community. Is really communicating well about our intentions. Where we're coming from and how we were going to manifest these things. Because there's this running theme of neutron is not aligned or whatever.
00:38:17.368 - 00:38:55.516, Speaker E: And if you look at the history of neutron. Actually, I really don't think that's true. I'll discuss a few things. And actually, Elijah and I collaborated very recently on a post that shares some of the elements of how we think about alignment. Beyond some of the points that I'll touch upon. But how do we make Adam money on neutron? Actually, there's a bunch of things in there, including what do we do with the Prop 72 funds. And there's a few suggestions which I find very appealing.
00:38:55.516 - 00:39:26.126, Speaker E: In furthering alignment in the atom economic zone, for example, instead of it's a grant. So technically that could be dumped to fund whatever. But I think something that's more appealing to further this alignment is to. Hey, can we use these funds to, on the one hand, generate some long term revenue. That could be used to nurture the neutron ecosystem, which is growth for the AZ. That's great. But also contribute to increasing the degree of security of the cosmos hub.
00:39:26.126 - 00:39:54.120, Speaker E: Which every consumer chain and replicated security and the cosmos hub benefits from. But also, if we do this and we do it a bit naively and we just stake everything with one validator. We're actually sort of hindering the progress of the hub as a chain. Because we're sort of concentrating stake. So perhaps there's a way for us to have minimal overhead. With a at least decent validator set management policy. Well, there's a protocol that does this in the atomic zone just happens to be stride.
00:39:54.120 - 00:40:18.194, Speaker E: So perhaps we can take the Prop 72 funds, stick them with stride. And then either hold that or deploy that on neutron's ecosystem. So that basically this now, one time spend now. Is going to be perpetually generating some benefits for all three chains in the atomic zone today. So that's one of the ideas. The other one is that. That token swap idea that I know you've been doing a lot of work on.
00:40:18.194 - 00:40:54.460, Speaker E: This is something that we've been talking about since literally last year, actually. And in fact, we've already conducted a token swap. Except the one difference between the token swap. And neutron's launch event was that instead of swapping directly with the hub itself, which at the time didn't really have the infrastructure to do, so we swapped with the hub's community instead. So neutron itself, through small contracts, basically offered a fairly large amount of its supply to anyone who had atom, basically. And so that already built a lot of alignment. So today, if neutron was to.
00:40:54.460 - 00:41:41.152, Speaker E: If the hub was to die, for example, not only would that be a problem for a neutron from a perspective of security, but also that's where most of the value in the neutron ecosystem currently is built around. And so that's something that, you know, there is. There's a very strong incentive to continue growing, basically, because like, that is the, you know, that has always been Newton's mission, basically. And so, you know, these ideas, they're there. We've been working and talking about them for. For a while, but I think we've sort of failed to sort of like put our good faith or something out there. And so I hope this sharing more broadly about these ideas that are being worked sometimes in the background will help.
00:41:41.152 - 00:42:09.826, Speaker E: And so I invite everybody to just read this document. It's very similar, actually. I find it very complementary to Elijah's post on the Cosmos hub. And it's a part one, so there's a bit more coming, another mechanism as well that often gets overlooked. And part of it is on me. I've been working on this doc aboutdez how to give the cosmos up voting power on Neutron and I have not finalized and posted it yet. So working on that still.
00:42:09.826 - 00:43:12.460, Speaker E: Please bear with me. But basically the idea is that neutron made a big airdrop as part of its launch and as part of the negotiations and the discussions during the proposal to launch neutron itself. A strong kind of like, point of feedback was that people were keen on having the unclaimed tokens go to the Cosmos hub in some capacity. And so that has been implemented. Their infrastructure to do so trustlessly initially didn't exist. And so we proactively want to see the adamant, like the A Dao folks to ask them like, hey guys, we would like to like, you know, use your address, your multisig address as the, like, withdrawal address for the inclaimed token. So that even though we'd like to implement a better solution so that the Cosmos hub community can have the certainty that whenever these tokens are clawed back, they are clawed back to something that is at least very, very closely aligned with the Cosmos rep.
00:43:12.460 - 00:43:58.900, Speaker E: Now, as I said, there is a better solution than just relying on multisig that can be implemented for this. And in fact, we've been working on it for, for quite a while now, and we're hoping to ship something soon. But before we finalize this, we want to make sure that this is actually something that the hub community wants, because there's multiple ways that these tokens could end up. They're basically owned by the hub, but how does the hub want to have them? One solution is to just send them to the community pool. That's fine. And that is exposure a bad on the directionality of neutron. I think that's a great use case, but potentially that can be true, while also providing more deeper alignment than just financial incentives in the success of the project.
00:43:58.900 - 00:45:05.792, Speaker E: What we've been working on is designing solutions that would allow the hub to not only own these tokens, but also use them to exercise, to have a say in the governance of the consumer chains. And that's something that I think, Noah, you were basically saying that the contrary can happen as well. And I think they're very complementary mechanisms to sort of have some sort of reciprocity and fairness within the atom economic zone, which I think is absolutely fundamental for this to work and for us to have alignment. And so we're working on our side of the picture here by basically saying, hey, what we can do with these tokens is we can, for example, implement a set of smart contracts that the hub would own via interesting accounts. And these contracts would hold the tokens, the hub would own the contract, so it would have ultimate decision making power over these tokens and what to do with them. It could move them anytime, but as long as it puts them in these contracts. These contracts are designed specifically to allow the hub to be able to vote in neutral governance, to voting power and such.
00:45:05.792 - 00:46:24.350, Speaker E: Now there are a few decisions like, you know, points where there needs to be a conversation to inform the design. Right? So do we want the hub, like, do we as an atom community prefer to be able to express our vote like we do on Cosmos governance? Eg, everybody votes whatever they prefer. And then the aggregate is the decision that gets casted here, because it's kind of like a two step decision process. Like the hub makes its own decision and then it votes into neutral governance, and then there are more stakeholders so that another aggregate decision is made. There can be either this implementation, which I think is probably going to be the preferred one, for example, the hub votes, and then it uses all of the tokens to vote for this specific outcome that its vote selected, or it could be something like anyone who has Adam now, whether or not they have NTRN has voting power that is proportional to their share of the total atom voting power onto neutron, that's another approach that could work as well. It probably would be a little bit more decentralized on the casting of the voting power, but it also doesn't have this coherent voice of the cosmos hub, which is also very appealing as a value proposition. So those are the options that I wanted to describe in this paper.
00:46:24.350 - 00:46:48.890, Speaker E: And so, yeah, like, the point of saying all of this is like there's a bunch of stuff being worked on by consumer chains on enabling the hub to have voting power, enabling the hub to have more exposure, enabling the hub to receive atom basically to be strengthened by the consumer chains. And what it would take extra, extra. So highly encourage everybody to just read that post if you're interested.
00:46:49.510 - 00:46:59.430, Speaker A: I think we'll have to do another space just on that because it sounds super interesting. Yeah. Before we move it over to questions, I do want to hand it over to Brian.
00:46:59.550 - 00:47:00.214, Speaker D: Who?
00:47:00.382 - 00:47:50.420, Speaker A: Brian, you just became president of the Interchange Foundation Council, so congratulations on that and also want to let everybody know that Brian will be on the interop this Thursday. So if you want to listen in to my conversation with Brian, just subscribe to the interop. The Twitter account is here, the space, and you can also find it on YouTube. But, yeah. So what do you think the role of the ICF needs to be moving forward? And how can the ICF best support the ecosystem? Beyond providing funding, are there other roles that the ICF, you think, needs to move into more in the form of what we were talking about earlier? If we compare it to other ecosystems where the foundation has a little bit more influence and oversight of the vision.
00:47:51.560 - 00:48:39.180, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I mean, that's a great question. Yeah. I mean, so obviously, like, I think right now, the main job of the ICF, the main thing the ICF does is basically fund the Cosmos core development. You know, so that's the comet, BFT, Cosmos SDK, IBC, also interchange security and the kind of cosmos hard work, you know, and then a few other things, you know, like there's some funding for Cosmosm. And I think the main, I think what the ICF is most, best suited and best place to do is to keep doing that and to do that really well. There are some other things that, you know, the ICF has also been doing.
00:48:39.180 - 00:49:29.290, Speaker C: You know, one is to try to kind of coordinate between those different parties to align a bit on, like roadmap and priorities. That's pretty challenging thing to do because it's just, you know, these projects are so technical and the expertise is so specialized in certain people. And I think at the, at the interchange foundation, we've historically kind of lacked just the team and the people who have that kind of experience to be able to do this well. But I think that is also that that still is something that, you know, we are engaged in. And, you know, there's, for example, still this job post open for, like, ecosystem lead. And, you know, we are, we are like, trying to hire also or hiring for some positions to help do this better. And then, you know, I think there are some other things.
00:49:29.290 - 00:50:16.410, Speaker C: So, for example, we are planning to relaunch a grant program so that, you know, anyone coming into the cosmos ecosystem, you know, can apply for some funding and kind of get it from the ICF. So that's something we plan to open again. Last year, at some point in the past, the ICF was doing this, too. Now, when it comes to now, of course, in some other ways, the ICF has very much been standing back. For example, ICF has never voted in governance on any Cosmos hub thing. And the ICF also, you know, for example, if you looked at the alum 2.0 white paper, okay, I think it included some authors, maybe that, you know, certainly some of them got funding from the ICF for their work.
00:50:16.410 - 00:51:14.256, Speaker C: And, you know, I think some were more closely associated, but, you know, it wasn't something that was driven by the ICF. And I don't think the ICF is really in the right position to try to, you know, drive the Cosmos hub vision, but the ICF can certainly try to support to make it happen and. Yeah, and I think just provide a lot of security, stability, long term growth for all of these core software stacks that they're seeing a ton of adoption. Yeah. But who knows? Maybe this can evolve a little bit in the future. But I would say it's not really the focus right now. I think right now at the ICF, the focus is one on extending the foundation council to include some others to join the board, which I think is very important.
00:51:14.256 - 00:51:28.626, Speaker C: And then really on the funding program, how can we make the best funding decisions, deploy that money effectively so that, you know, the right things get billed and they get built well for like, a good amount of money fast. So I think that's really where our.
00:51:28.658 - 00:52:09.580, Speaker A: Focus is very interesting. And do you think that there is a role for the ICF to play, maybe directly or indirectly, in terms of funding with regards to, you know, business development in cosmos? Yeah, I think one of the things that a lot of people that I talk to agree on is that I. Other ecosystems have very strong biz dev arms that are closely tied to the foundation or the main source of funding. And I've often felt that this is something that cosmos lacks. Some of the teams in the ecosystem do this. They do it well. But in Ethereum, we've historically had organizations like consensys.
00:52:09.580 - 00:52:16.824, Speaker A: We sort of lack this, I think, to some extent in cosmos. Yeah. What are your thoughts? Are there?
00:52:16.992 - 00:52:36.336, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, that's right. I mean, in. There are some other things that the chain foundation is doing. So, for example, there is a marketing communications team that maintains website like Cosmos Network and that does some things there. And I think that is something to expand on that.
00:52:36.368 - 00:52:37.160, Speaker F: Do that better.
00:52:37.280 - 00:53:00.510, Speaker C: I think definitely, with regards to having some kind of BD, I mean, you're absolutely right that this is not a capability. That's not a capability that the ICF has at this point. And including, I get a decent amount of requests of like, hey, we have this kind of BD thing can destock to somebody at the ICF. And I'm like, well, not really, because that's not something that's there.
00:53:01.050 - 00:53:08.480, Speaker A: A lot of people ask me for that. A lot of people ask me like, hey, can I get an intro to the ICF because I got a cool project. Dude, that's not the right people to talk to.
00:53:09.260 - 00:53:09.860, Speaker F: Exactly.
00:53:09.900 - 00:53:29.748, Speaker C: I mean, I think one thing that could make sense is more maybe, and this is something we have been discussing a little bit, maybe there should be, like, you know, one or two people or something that, you know, would be available to take these kind of calls and then maybe refer people to other entities in the cosmos ecosystem. Right.
00:53:29.844 - 00:53:30.428, Speaker B: Real quick.
00:53:30.524 - 00:53:31.460, Speaker C: Yeah, real quick.
00:53:31.540 - 00:53:35.068, Speaker B: You know that you're paying us to do exactly this work, right? The builders program.
00:53:35.204 - 00:53:36.480, Speaker D: This is what we do.
00:53:36.870 - 00:53:46.710, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, no, I think some. Some things definitely. Yeah, some teams definitely kind of fit the builders program. And I think some things we do send there.
00:53:46.750 - 00:53:49.126, Speaker D: Yeah, Spain.
00:53:49.158 - 00:53:50.582, Speaker A: I think you want to just react.
00:53:50.726 - 00:53:51.606, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah.
00:53:51.758 - 00:53:54.718, Speaker A: And then if we have a few more minutes, we'll leave it over to questions.
00:53:54.894 - 00:54:36.540, Speaker E: Those sort of, like, around this topic, actually. Like, I think, you know, BD. I'm not sure, as noam said, like, binary is working on this. There's a bunch of teams like Strangelove has been doing a lot of so, like, product slash BD for ABC itself. There's a number of teams that we're super lucky to have in this regard. But I think one thing where the ICF could be super useful is evangelizing the cosmos stack within other ecosystems, because what we're seeing is that you have projects like maker and others that are now realizing the value of the app chain thesis. And it just so happens that this entire ecosystem has been focused on building the stack that you need to be able to actually build app chains and such.
00:54:36.540 - 00:55:47.210, Speaker E: I think now more than ever is when that needs to be done because otherwise we're going to lose out on massive opportunities to basically bring that technology to the people who actually need it and would take it to build awesome applications. And I think that's one of the places where we can definitely do better. It's great to see that folks like Sam, for example, has been replying to the maker post in this regard and just providing more context over the state of the stack in cosmos. And I think just that, not necessarily being looking for new opportunities and trying to strike deals with people and stuff, but just making sure that people know what Cosmos is beyond just the brand and the nice logo and everything, and what it allows you to do that is completely different from any other blockchain. And the value proposition to you as a project looking to build app specific infrastructure as compared to forking and other blockchain or such, which the experience has shown us that that was not a particularly great idea in the long term. So I think that's probably one of the ways that there's probably low hanging fruits in this regard where we can do better as an ecosystem. And I'm sure that the ICF can certainly have a place in this regard.
00:55:48.630 - 00:56:56.090, Speaker A: Yeah, we got a show of tech. I think if, if not the ICF, maybe like some other organizations, but I feel like shilling the tech to projects because there's so much interest, I think right now in Cosmos and in some ways, like Brian mentioned, a little bit of difficulty for people coming into the ecosystem who are legitimately interested in building with Cosmos tech to find the right partners and find the right people to be talking to. And in a lot of ways the ICF maybe isn't that, isn't that that ecosystem participant, but having someone at the ICF there who can kind of like give these projects a bird's eye view of the ecosystem, like, okay, here are the people who are working on that. You want to talk to them about this? Like here are the people who are working on that. Like if you have questions about that, you should be talking to these people. I think that would be immensely valuable. And then like those ecosystem participants to whom the ICF redirects to, I think, would be, you know, great evangelists to, you know, just show the strength of the tech.
00:56:56.090 - 00:56:58.302, Speaker A: So, yeah, that's a good idea.
00:56:58.326 - 00:58:00.770, Speaker D: Can I just say something maybe a little bit controversial? I don't mean to be too much of, like, a provocateur here, but, like, I think, you know, I was the first person on Twitter. Not the first person, but, yeah, I was one of the first people to say, like, wow, this is just like a validation for the app chain thesis, you know, when Makerdao made that announcement. But Makerdao, you know, has been announcing their intention to explore app chains for, like, a really long time now. And I think it's like a massive failure on our part as a community that, like, as soon as they announced that intention, we did not send over representatives to be on top of the ball and actually make that happen. And I actually, I do think the ICF should be that, that foundation that spearheads those kinds of things. I think my understanding of the ICF is that it has an incredibly large amount of funding compared to other funding bodies in the cosmos. And a lot of that funding has come from Cosmos hub.
00:58:00.770 - 00:58:46.034, Speaker D: Adam, in particular. I think if there's a commitment of the ICF to fund a number of public goods that are benefiting the entire ecosystem, it should also take on the role as the shepherd as like, you know, what I believe to be the most reputable organization to try to bring in large teams like that to actually use this technology, this public good funding, or these public good funded technologies or funded technologies to be public goods. I don't know. There's a word scramble here that they're the ones responsible for creating and initiating. I don't think anyone else is better positioned. I don't think anyone else is as well resourced. I don't think anyone else has the domain expertise and level of professionalism that they have.
00:58:46.034 - 00:59:37.332, Speaker D: And actually being able to do that. And I think, like, seeing more of that in the future when, you know, so when there's the next maker, or if this is maker, you know, if this is it, whatever that, like, at least we know that, like, we're giving our best shot. And not to say anything about Brian or anyone, like, you know, obviously, you know, you're an incredibly intelligent person. Like, really enjoyed hearing you speak. And I don't mean this in, like, a malicious way whatsoever, just like, I just think that, like, yeah, it was a pretty massive failure of, like, the ecosystem as a whole. And, you know, it's not the fault of the ICF because, you know, this wasn't like a defined role of the ICF, but moving forward, I think, like, we should be 100% on top of the ball there. You know, it's the same way, like if you're a startup, right? You know, just from like being, you know, having operated in like a much smaller, you know, lower resource setting for a little bit, anytime there's even like this, like the slightest smell of like a lead or something that was like, you know, potentially going to be big for us.
00:59:37.332 - 00:59:52.132, Speaker D: Like we tripled, you know, we tripled down on it in like such a big way because like, you sort of have to do that when you haven't found product market fit and you haven't like established a mode and. Yeah, yeah. So anyways, just. Sorry, don't mean to be provocative, but.
00:59:52.156 - 01:00:32.258, Speaker G: Yeah, yeah, just wanted to jump in really quick, I think. Nyman, just what Elijah said, I think the community, the interchange community as a whole, there's just confusion about who should fund what. So like the Minscan proposal, it's not even a proposal yet, but it's on the forums right now. They're looking for what, 220,000 atom or 300,000 atom. Got the exact amount over like a ten year period. And I think the question comes back to, should the hub fund public goods? It probably should to a degree, but I think if you look at the amount of the community pool size of the hub, it's very small compared to the overall market, captain. And you look at other treasuries or other community pools of other chains that we're and ecosystems that we're competing with.
01:00:32.258 - 01:00:59.792, Speaker G: And I think it comes down to like, we want to make sure that if the ICF is setting up a grants program, that's great. Let's just make sure that the mandate of that grants program under the ICF doesn't step on the toes of other grants programs in the interchange. We want to make sure that teams aren't getting double funded. I think there just needs to be overall clarification on like, where the ICF stands and funding certain initiatives. VD perspective. Like, should the hub be funding YouTube videos? Like, I don't know the answer to that. I don't want to say yes, no, or maybe so.
01:00:59.792 - 01:01:07.700, Speaker G: I think there's just overall confusion about who, where builders and community members, like, should go to for funding for certain things.
01:01:10.000 - 01:01:14.500, Speaker A: Brian, do you want to respond to that real quick? Yeah, go to questions.
01:01:15.080 - 01:01:52.530, Speaker F: Yeah, I mean, I guess first, appreciate you guys sharing your thoughts. I mean, I, I do agree that I think the kind of evangelizing of the Cosmos stack and evangelizing of Cosmos as the best platform to build your sovereign app chain on is something that maybe doing a little bit, but not well. And I think that's definitely an area to invest in. So I'm in agreement with that. Yeah. I mean, in terms of funding.
01:01:54.910 - 01:01:55.174, Speaker H: I.
01:01:55.182 - 01:02:11.198, Speaker F: Think the ICF has done like an okay job at managing its treasury given the market cycles. But it was still the case that we've had budget reductions from this year to last year and we're going to reduce it again next year.
01:02:11.334 - 01:02:13.582, Speaker C: So I would say a lot of.
01:02:13.606 - 01:02:44.880, Speaker F: The funding is really focused. The vast majority of funding is really focused just on these core parts of the tech stack. So, you know, comet, BFT, Cosmos SDK, IBC and then the Cosmos hub work. And so. Yeah, so I think there is. That's really where the ICF has been focusing on. And so I think it's great if the community pool takes on lots of other things like partnership, marketing, content.
01:02:44.880 - 01:02:51.860, Speaker F: Yeah, that has been happening to some extent as well.
01:02:54.520 - 01:02:54.880, Speaker D: Great.
01:02:54.920 - 01:02:55.540, Speaker A: Thanks.
01:02:56.160 - 01:04:03.200, Speaker B: Just to get some context or just also here we are working on something that has been missing for a very long time, which was really surprising, is that we had never had a pitch deck for the cosmos of the entertain stack. There was never a pitch check for IBC. There was never, there's nobody chasing DeFi llama right now, for example, making sure that IBC is there being listed as one of the bridges, for example. All the bridges are listed there. So just to give people a sense that it's not, that nothing is happening, it's like we do get funding to do some of this work and we are facing definitely right now to get this out there. And we are trying to create a hit list of projects to actively do outreach and basically do sales for the Cosmos act, something that we're doing with the Builders program and hoping to do more next year, we're writing a growth roadmap also, where we're trying to tackle some of these biggest issues. But why aren't there market makers in this space? Why are VC's not showing up? Why is it so hard to get developers in this space and how do we solve these issues? So these things are being done and they're being researched and they're being addressed.
01:04:03.200 - 01:04:22.932, Speaker B: It's just that that's the kind of work that doesn't really, it doesn't really get shown publicly. It's not something that, you know, is paraded around. It's like, look at the great work that we've done on this front. And I think that's just one of those things where, you know, when you ship SDK version 0.5 or 0.50, and that's great news. You can say, oh, this has been shipped.
01:04:22.932 - 01:04:41.090, Speaker B: But when you, you know, in the backgrounds have been supporting some team coming from ethereum to, to Cosmos, and you've just been helping them on a daily basis with technical integration and whatnot, that's the kind of work that just sort of like, is missed in the background, but it's being done and more, of course, needs to be done, no doubt.
01:04:42.270 - 01:05:03.690, Speaker A: I just want to say, the VC's are here, man. Like, you got at least two funds in here that are like, let's open it up. The questions. If you all have a couple more minutes so we have a better future, you're up. If anybody else has questions, just raise your hand and we'll give you, we'll give you access.
01:05:04.670 - 01:05:45.620, Speaker H: This has been a terrific discussion and definitely one of the reasons I love being in the cosmos, the fact that we can all jump on and have a brainstorm like this on the question of what is the role of the ICF. I've been thinking about this. The ICF has played such a kind of critical, important, meaningful role in getting the project to where it is today. And yet at the same time, some of the challenges that the ICF sits outside of hub governance. But also, of course, the ICF has a broader role than just supporting the hub. I mean, it's supporting the entire interchain and interchange public goods. So I think that's natural that it sits outside of hub governance for some of its functions.
01:05:45.620 - 01:07:59.030, Speaker H: But I think we're kind of at this awkward but also exciting moment where the project has, to an extent, been so successful that we've achieved community sovereignty, where we have a community kind of starting to be capable of leading decision making for the project with a proposal system and, you know, kind of democratic voting on proposals that really is maybe more efficient and more frictionless than any nation state based kind of voting system. Like we're running votes weekly and large numbers of people participating. And no question about kind of the trouble. Like, it's really quite remarkable and maybe even that's a killer app or kind of a killer accomplishment of the cosmos stack. But the fact that we have these tools to have kind of community participation in decision making, I think it leads to a natural shift to wanting to have the on chain governance as the dominant or the driving system of governance for the project, which then gets into things like vision, you know, accountability and so forth. And then the question of how does the ICF fit into that? I haven't really thought it through, but maybe if there was a way for the ICF for part of its role, like the part of the role that contributes to the hub, to subject itself voluntarily to the on chain governance system, that's emerging again, I have no idea how that would work. Could the ICF have a subdao that for the functions of the work that the ICF supports related to the hub, would kind of run through the subdao and be respectful of kind of the community governance system? So that's kind of one thought, maybe a tangential thought would be, it seems to be the case that the governance of the project as it's evolving, is kind of tending towards this sub down model.
01:07:59.030 - 01:08:02.950, Speaker H: There was a, I can't remember.
01:08:05.010 - 01:08:05.346, Speaker B: Who.
01:08:05.378 - 01:09:15.509, Speaker H: Mentioned it a week or two ago, but there's kind of this spectrum on the one hand of like projects that are 100% community led, and you have chaos and no leadership and no teams, and nothing gets done. Then on the other extreme, you have kind of very strong foundation led projects, like the Ethereum foundation. And as long as the foundation is a benevolent dictator, you kind of have a very good experience. But if you get a Mussolini or a Hitler, kind of the crypto context, like a bad dictator, it doesn't matter if it's a nation state or a crypto project, rugs and frauds and poor coordinate, it can just go very bad very quickly. So Ethereum was, I guess, lucky in that they had a kind of a benevolent foundation. And the ICF has also been a benevolent foundation in the cosmos. There's kind of this intermediate place where we're starting to flirt with this subdao concept, where it's four or five or six different subdaos that would be community elected.
01:09:15.509 - 01:09:55.146, Speaker H: They're domain specific teams. One can do grants, one can do bde, one can lead interchange, affairs, marketing, content. You have the benefit of competence within teams to do very kind of focused kind of work on behalf of the community. Being part of AA Dao for the last year, I'm seeing a couple of challenges with this model, like things that we need to tweak to actually make it work. One, there's no coordination between the subdaos. Like, they all report to the community pool. You have no CEO, no president, and you end up with four or five teams wanting to contribute to the project.
01:09:55.146 - 01:10:57.396, Speaker H: But if a team like a Dow, we're doing the best work we can to kind of live up to our mandate and our promise to the community to find great projects that meet kind of the goals, contributing to the ecosystem, adding value to Adam. But we announce one of our decisions and we think we've done a great job in screening, interviews and structuring and ensuring kind of accountability milestones to protect the hub community. And then we announce it and everyone's surprised or people don't understand it or they don't have the context or they don't have the situational awareness. And we're doing our best on the transparency side to kind of get that information out about the choices. But sometimes it lags by a week or two or a month until the transparency report comes out. And so this issue of like coordination between subdaos and with the community, it becomes a real challenge. One thought we've been having recently, if.
01:10:57.428 - 01:11:09.628, Speaker A: You, just because I want to be mindful of like, if there's other people that have questions, I mean, this is super interesting, but if you, if you have like, so like a conclusion to your thought or maybe like a question to ask, because we do have like another person.
01:11:09.724 - 01:11:34.700, Speaker H: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You, you bet. Thank you for, for helping me to frame it as a question. So as a question, you know, what can we do to make this subdao model kind of work? Do we think it's a good intermediate point between foundation led and kind of community costs? And could the ICF kind of in this subdao model if this is indeed kind of where we're tracking as a community?
01:11:35.760 - 01:12:05.990, Speaker F: Yeah, I can answer that briefly. I mean, so first of all, the ICF is the swiss foundation. And it basically means that when Cosmo started, right, the ICF was set up and the funds from the fundraiser went into the foundation as well as around 10% of the atoms. And then the ICF basically has this kind of mandate to deploy these funds, grow the cosmos ecosystem, to kind of drive over decentralized technologies.
01:12:07.970 - 01:12:08.710, Speaker C: So.
01:12:11.410 - 01:13:22.464, Speaker F: We have sort of discussed this also at some point, like, oh, would it make sense to kind of try to put some of the funds under control of some on chain governance mechanism? I think that's conceivable. Maybe in the future at some point, if this is working really well, if one can have a confidence that the funds are going to be used well and effectively, I could imagine that. And yeah, I think there's big pros and cons to both to the way that the ICF can do funding as a centralized organization versus the cosmos hub with its on chain governance mechanism. Both have advantages and disadvantages. I do expect that in the future that kind of decentralized coordination is going to get more effective and then maybe this will make sense. But yeah, I think at this point, I'm not sure if we're at this at that point or maybe one could do it for some small experiment. But yeah, I think it's definitely a direction that I'm personally open to, and I know Bucky is as well.
01:13:22.464 - 01:13:27.170, Speaker F: We've definitely talked about this before, so yeah, I think that's conceivable.
01:13:28.550 - 01:13:43.370, Speaker H: Just thank you. It definitely isn't working perfectly yet, so I think you're right to crawl, walk, run, and there's still a lot of work to do to figure this subdow model out, if it can be effective. So thank you.
01:13:43.870 - 01:14:45.388, Speaker E: Just very briefly, and I'll try to very keep it to just a few sentences, but I think most of the challenges with actually doing this well enough have been identified. Makerdao has and Lido and others have created structures that are pretty good at executing stuff. And the main challenges that they faced is the lack of vision. For example, you don't have a central coordinating body to actually set that vision. And so I think the challenge is really here, right, for anything for the hub to get better, basically, we first need to set the right vision. Once we have a vision that most stakeholders, all of the stakers, the validators, the users, the consumer chains, what have you that use the hub as a technology and as a network, have a rough consensus over a vision. And how to get to that vision is, it's a challenge, admittedly, but once we have the vision, we can then build the infrastructure to allow execution upon that vision, basically.
01:14:45.388 - 01:14:49.800, Speaker E: So let's not put the card before the horses. We just need to figure out the vision first.
01:14:50.300 - 01:16:16.750, Speaker A: On the vision side, there's one thing I'd like to mention here, and also have this be a call out for collaboration and support. So, at interop Ventures, and I guess this has been very much inspired again by Elijah's post and the conversations that came up after it. We've been thinking about organizing. And noam, we talked about this as well, a sort of cosmos town hall event during cosmoverse. The idea here is to have essentially like a full day of conversations, workshops, you know, sort of working sessions where different members of the community can work on different aspects of what we're talking about here, whether it's governance, funding, et cetera. And at the end of this event of this kind of like day long workshop, hopefully have some recommendations, some things that we will all produce together, that we can then present to the community, further, discuss informed posts, maybe iterate on again at a later event throughout the year, etcetera, but really try to start get the ball rolling on, like establishing what a vision would be. So we're in the early phases of planning this.
01:16:16.750 - 01:17:07.472, Speaker A: We have a tentative date of October 5. So this is a call out to anybody who's interested in helping one establish the agenda for this. And you guys hear all the speakers are more than welcome to participate there. Also helping with planning, and we also need teams to help with sponsorship and stuff like that. So this is something we really want to try to help lead and continue this conversation. I think that having the face to face time is a huge unlocker for a lot of these sorts of issues. I think having Twitter spaces and foreign posts are great, but getting people in a room and having the ability to discuss face to face, I think, is a huge, huge plus.
01:17:07.472 - 01:17:21.520, Speaker A: So, yeah, reach out to me on Twitter or telegram and we'll get you guys in a group. Like to also invite Robert B. To speak. You had a question or.
01:17:21.560 - 01:17:21.856, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:17:21.928 - 01:18:07.964, Speaker I: Thanks, seb. Hi, everyone. Congrats, Brian, on the new position. I do have a question, what I found with Elijah talking about interchange, the interchain foundation, stewarding the goals and objectives of, like, IBC, the Cosmos, SDK, and so on to other ecosystems. Very interesting and compelling. One thing that does very much concern me here is the distribution of the workload. Let's say, let's imagine here we do receive makerdao into the ecosystem, and the interchange foundation is the leading participant that is venturing down that path.
01:18:07.964 - 01:18:32.490, Speaker I: How would they distribute that workload across many different validator firms that all have their own self interest in mind? Would it look something like the application program for the Cosmos hub validator set delegating, how do we maintain an unbiased system to bring in new communities into the ecosystem? And this question is directed at Brian?
01:18:35.350 - 01:19:32.944, Speaker F: Yeah, I mean, that's so, first of all, the ICF does not really have the resources and bandwidth. I mean, there is binary builders, which Noah mentioned before, and they have this basically the builders program, which is funded by the ICF and which is basically like a resource that's available for teams that are looking to build on the Cosmos SDK in the cosmos. And they help with a lot of. Provide a lot of support to these kind of projects. So if example make you interested in something like that, they would probably go there. Um, I mean, validators, when it comes to validators and staking you know, I think each chain does their own thing, just actually not really something the ICF has any role or involvement in. I mean, except, of course, when it comes to, you know, delegating the atoms held by the ICF, where, you know, there is this delegation program.
01:19:32.944 - 01:19:33.256, Speaker F: Right.
01:19:33.288 - 01:19:33.576, Speaker C: That's.
01:19:33.608 - 01:19:49.820, Speaker F: That's been running and that's actually developed staking with many, many different validators and explicitly not the largest validators. Yeah. I don't know if that answers your question, but I'm also not quite sure.
01:19:50.400 - 01:19:52.824, Speaker D: Do you mind if I hop in really quickly?
01:19:52.952 - 01:19:54.140, Speaker E: Yeah, sure. Go ahead.
01:19:55.360 - 01:20:37.694, Speaker D: I know you addressed this to me. So one thing Cosmos has actually done really well is it's attracted, actually, before I go into that, there's basically, like, three businesses in crypto. Not businesses, but protocols that have been successful as businesses or daos. Three successful daos so far, or at least in the era of Defi. Those three daos are Lido, Makerdao, and Dydx, pretty much uniswap, not really a Dao. I guess. Dydx is not fully a Dao, but their forum is certainly way more active, and they have a way more active community than Uniswap, so I'll cut them some slack.
01:20:37.694 - 01:21:37.300, Speaker D: Plus, also, right, they're building in Cosmos, so that's great. I have the utmost respect for Noam. I've been incredibly impressed with all my conversations with him. But the binary Builders program is not the right steward for someone like Makerdao. I also think the question of what happens after you bring in teams like Makerdao, DyDX, Liteo, these are some of the most sophisticated, well resourced teams in the entire space, not just within Cosmos, not just within ethereum, within all of crypto, and they can figure it out. For example, Makerdao right now is thinking about using a Solana fork to build a custom app chain. If they're considering forking Solana and building a custom app chain using Solana, they're certainly well resourced enough to use the Cosmos SDK, which was literally built for that purpose.
01:21:37.300 - 01:22:47.090, Speaker D: But we need our best and brightest to actually be stewarding that. And to be honest, unless it's people like Brian and Ethan and Sunny and the best and brightest within the cosmos ecosystem, Saki, Jack, whoever else, unless they're the ones doing the outreach and having, like, some strategic, coordinated effort to actually make it happen, I don't know if, like, we'll continue to nail those teams or those teams will continue to be lost to the optimism stack or the arbitrum stack or whatever other app roll up stack that's going to come around. And so, yeah, I mean, I understand, like, the ICF has its certain goals and angles. No teams within cosmos are, like, so, so well funded or well resourced that, like, they can be doing everything. You know, that's the fact of the matter. But, like, we should certainly be putting the best, brightest, you know, best representatives, most involved people on, like, these types of things. I don't know if, you know, I'm not saying, like, either that maybe it shouldn't be entirely the ICF.
01:22:47.090 - 01:23:20.478, Speaker D: Maybe it should be some combination of, like, leaders within the ecosystem. Maybe there's like, some group chat or forum or whatever where, like, you know, some of the people who, you know, have that personal brand and that, like, you know, gravitas get together and like, you know, you know, identify these ideas. Maybe we hire an intern to, like, identify the ideas and just send it over to, like, you know, these types of people. But, like, yeah, it needs to come from the top. It needs to come from the best and the brightest, and it needs to come from the most reputable and, yeah, 100%. The rest will solve itself. These teams are amazing.
01:23:20.614 - 01:23:51.336, Speaker E: Just one very, very quick thought on this. I think actually the ICF could do a good enough job by simply doing two things. The first one is that evangelization thing, making sure that people outside of Cosmos know about the stack and what exists and what can be used, and two, serving as just the, you know, like, maintaining one list of who, you know, introducing these teams to the right teams for all their needs. Like, okay, you want to work on IBC? Okay, talk to Strangelove. You want to work on X, talk to this team.
01:23:51.368 - 01:23:51.632, Speaker D: Right?
01:23:51.696 - 01:24:11.274, Speaker E: Like, the ACF has these contacts. It just needs to put these teams in touch with the right, you know, people to go deeper in these things. And I don't think that necessarily requires the ACF two, like, build a massive new competency or something. I mean, you know, just a piece of feedback. But, yeah, I hope that's useful.
01:24:11.362 - 01:24:12.030, Speaker I: Thanks.
01:24:14.210 - 01:24:47.370, Speaker D: Yeah, the point is, like, Ruhn or the maker Dao is just not going to listen to, like, you know, Elijah Joe shmo, who made a cosmos hub forum post one time, or, you know, like, they're not, they're not going to, like, really care. They'll care if it's like, you know, the founders and stewards of the ecosystem since day one and if they're giving, like, a really raw and authentic perspective from having seen the ecosystem grow and what the tooling can do. So, yeah, I agree with Spade. I don't think it's about developing, like, a massive competency or anything. I think it's just about, like, representing the ecosystem in a big way.
01:24:48.630 - 01:25:15.072, Speaker B: I think a lot of these resources just need to be allocated also to knowing that this is happening. Right? So that foreign post should have had our attention much, much, much sooner. And that is just a question of, like, do we have enough, like you were saying, like, interns and whomever available to keep an eye on what's happening out there. And then, yeah, then of course, we get the right people to drive those conversations and to close the deal, so to speak.
01:25:15.136 - 01:25:17.540, Speaker I: If you want an intern, always free.
01:25:19.240 - 01:25:20.424, Speaker B: Okay, good to know.
01:25:20.512 - 01:26:08.990, Speaker A: Thanks. All right, guys, it's been a really fascinating hour and a half, but I think we'll have to leave it there, get on with our respective days and evenings. I want to thank everybody for coming on. Noam, Eliza Spade, Brian evercapital, and also to those who added questions and contributions to this conversation. Hey, this is important step, I think, to getting us to a place where we can sort of agree on a cohesive vision for the hub. And I'm really glad that we're able to have this conversation. Also, very grateful for Brian for coming on and listening to the community's feedback.
01:26:08.990 - 01:26:32.400, Speaker A: I think that your participation in events like these and other sort of conversations is probably very valuable for the ICF in order to position itself with regards to the hub and other actors in the ecosystem. So thanks a lot and really looking forward to our podcast on Thursday where we'll go into a little bit more detail here.
01:26:32.860 - 01:26:35.116, Speaker F: Absolutely. Thanks so much for organizing this.
01:26:35.268 - 01:26:42.600, Speaker A: Yeah, my pleasure. Thanks, everybody, and hope you have a good rest of your day.
01:26:42.940 - 01:26:43.920, Speaker F: Thanks, everyone.
01:26:44.350 - 01:26:45.342, Speaker G: Thank you.
01:26:45.526 - 01:26:46.726, Speaker B: Thanks, everyone. Bye.
