00:00:00.240 - 00:00:19.690, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you. I'm very excited about this panel. Of course, RWAs are one of the hottest narratives in town right now. So this is the reason why I would love to introduce you to my fellow panelists, Matt, JP, and usually I just. Yeah, sorry, sorry. Yeah.
00:00:23.270 - 00:00:24.290, Speaker B: Packed house.
00:00:29.800 - 00:00:30.360, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:00:30.440 - 00:00:43.744, Speaker A: So let's get it started. I think it makes most sense if we start with a quick round of introductions. We start with Pierre. So please introduce yourself to the crowd and explain a few words what usual is doing in the area of RWAs.
00:00:43.912 - 00:01:07.584, Speaker D: Sure. Pleasure. Thank you for the invitation. So, my name is Pierre. I'm the CEO of usual. So, usual is a decentralized protocol that use real world asset as an underlying and issue a fully decentralized stablecoin that is backed by those real world assets. The idea is clearly to rebuild data fully on chain with transparency and to distribute the value that are generated by the user.
00:01:07.584 - 00:01:19.090, Speaker D: So, you know, data and circle are making a lot of money more than traditional actors. And the idea is to redistribute these values that have been generated through a governance token to the user of the bitcoin.
00:01:21.270 - 00:01:48.760, Speaker C: Hi, everyone, I'm Matt. I work on D five vD at Ondo. Ondo is really about bringing the traditional financial world together with the on chain financial world. So we call it institutional finance on chain. Today, we've had two very successful tokenized money market funds. They've gone through a couple iterations each. We have, like, a very large vision for how we're going to expand going forward.
00:01:49.740 - 00:02:10.974, Speaker B: Cool. My name is John. I'm a JP CEO and co founder of Mantra. We're a real world asset focused l one building the Cosmos SDK did a little talk earlier about RWAs here. We're also working together with Ondo for some USDY liquidity provision and looking forward to unpack different RWA initiatives on this panel.
00:02:11.172 - 00:03:03.280, Speaker A: Yeah, let's do it. And I think the first way to kind of settle the ground here to make sure that we are all on the same page here, let's talk a little bit about what RWAs are, because there's still some controversy around it. There are, like, some people who have a certain opinion on what an RWAS, and some people believe that some sort of things that are declared as RWAs aren't actually RWAs, such as Kyle Zamani. He tweeted like a couple of months ago, and I remembered this tweet very well, which was, can we all agree that rwas are things like USD, Apple, Tesla, etcetera, on chain, basically financial assets and things like whiskey, watches, wine, etcetera, are not RWAs, they are physical collectibles. Using the same vocabulary to describe financial assets and physical assets is going to lead to a lot of poor logic. What is your take on that, Pierre?
00:03:04.300 - 00:03:57.846, Speaker D: Oh, yeah, you know, I'm not the one that will define what is real world asset, because I think it's a wide range of asset. What I can consider is that clearly when we speak about real world assets, sometimes we make the confusion and we think about generate treasury bills that are tokenized. But clearly our asset is many things, can be securities, can be commodities, it assets that are infrastructure and not compatible with infrastructure on chain. And so real world assets in DeFi are mostly various range of assets that are using tratfi but want to bridge with Defi. And so for the moment, the most common real world asset category is tbil on chain because it's the most liquid on tri fi. And it will be, I think, the best layer of liquidity in DeFi in the, in the next few years when regulation will be okay. And that's another topic.
00:03:57.846 - 00:04:05.990, Speaker D: And so, yeah, clearly there is plenty behind real world assets, but the main thing is TVL from TBL.
00:04:07.490 - 00:04:40.812, Speaker B: Well, I mean, coming from a project that is called an RWA blockchain, I think RWA is a horrible way to describe this. The sector in the space and Dratvi. RWA means risk weighted asset. And it's never gonna get the adoption that we want it to have if we keep calling it RWA. The last, maybe two cycles ago it was STO and security token offerings. So like all these acronyms kind of suck. We can need to do a little bit better at figuring out like something that actually describes what we're trying to do a little bit better.
00:04:40.812 - 00:05:28.144, Speaker B: I just kind of, you know, put it all into asset tokenization. I would say in general, I think that institutional adoption of real world assets or, you know, tokenization has, has actually achieved some degree of product market fit. I think there's some statistic that JPMorgan on their onnx blockchain has tokenized over like a trillion dollars of government debt. Obviously, that's not utilized in something that any of us really can interact with, but that's a shitload of money on chain. In the case of retail adoption, frankly, the only one who's really had a significant amount of BMF is ondo with some of their products, and it's really still a bit of a drop in the ocean. Right. So actually, I'll take that back.
00:05:28.144 - 00:06:02.746, Speaker B: USD, if you consider Fiat as a tokenized RWA, then obviously tether is the king there. But other than that, we haven't really seen tons of it yet in the retail side. And I think that's a factor of regulation. Poor user experience, still not really adding a ton of high quality assets on chain. Obviously t bills on chain are interesting because it is clearly a high quality asset. I mean, assuming you think the us government is going to be paying you back. Anywho, there's a long way to go, and I think from the retail perspective, that's really where our core focus is on how do we actually make this space adopted.
00:06:02.746 - 00:06:06.390, Speaker B: But the whole RW idea and acronym is shit.
00:06:07.650 - 00:07:10.600, Speaker C: I mean, what is the real world anyway? I've always felt like this term is a little bit disparaging to the crypto native, because why is ether not a real world asset? It's very real to me. If you lose your ether, it's very real to all of us. So I think I like off chain asset, but unfortunately, then you turn around and tokenize it, it immediately becomes an on chain asset. So I think obviously it's a spectrum, right? I think tokenized Pokemon cards and watches are like real, but they're not financial assets, right? Tokenized financial products are somewhat less real. They're like numbers in a database at JPMorgan somewhere, but they're also from the off chain world. So I think none of these terms are good, right? Security token really didn't go well. Can you imagine the SEC now with the current climate saying, yeah, I work in security tokens, but don't sue me.
00:07:10.600 - 00:07:26.320, Speaker C: I think we've got a long way to go on the terminology, but I also think that the different products have very different target audiences. They have very different use cases. So it's maybe a little bit crazy to try to lump them all into one category.
00:07:26.820 - 00:08:09.802, Speaker A: Yeah, totally agree on that. But let's move on with an elevator pitch for RWAs, generally, because I remember this phase, 2017 and also into the NFT mania when everyone thought, okay, it's a good idea to tokenize your Rolex or something and put it on chain. A lot of people got annoyed by this idea and said, okay, DeFi is on chain, but the rest, please don't include a blockchain that much. So tokenization moved a little bit into the back, but now it's like back. So what would be your elevator pitch for RWAs? Why do we need to bring property on chain? Why do I need to bring, like a real estate in London on chain? Why would that make sense? I think since you did something in Dubai recently, let me tell you why.
00:08:09.826 - 00:08:33.608, Speaker B: We'Re doing it and very specifically how we're doing it. So we have a number of different ways that we're tokenizing real estate. And honestly, the beginning of the year, when we were looking at different products that we could work with and different asset classes that we could support, we take this very agnostic approach. We don't really care in the end of the day. But with real estate, it was one of the ones I was like, everyone's been trying to do this forever. It's honestly pretty freaking boring. It's huge.
00:08:33.608 - 00:09:18.806, Speaker B: But does it really need to happen on chain? And then we started talking to some of the developers that we work with, real estate developers that we work with in the UAE, and there was two things that started becoming interesting. One is the actual true tokenization of the title deed. So if you're just tokenizing the SPV or basically a real world structure, it's kind of faux tokenization, in my opinion. Whereas if you're actually tokenizing the ownership right of that on chain and that's recognized by a sovereign state, like that's real tokenization, right. So you actually own the token and then that gives you the right in the real world that's claimable in court that says, this is my property, this is my house, this is my real asset. That's something that we're exploring in the UAE. It's pretty exciting.
00:09:18.806 - 00:09:56.468, Speaker B: On the other side, the other project that we're doing, and we announced, I think, last week or the week before, is tokenizing real estate financing. And we have this big deal that we announced with a real estate developer called Mag Group, tokenizing $500 million of one of their off plan developments called Couture reserve. They don't really need to do it because they could either just sell the property themselves or take bank financing or doing this islamic financing method called sukuk. They don't need to use a tokenized financing offering to do this. There's a. There's kind of two reasons why I think it's interesting. The first being that one, you're getting this like, ability to subscribe to this product both in fiat and in crypto.
00:09:56.468 - 00:10:25.252, Speaker B: So that's one, you're getting an additional exposure to our token because we're effectively subsidizing the yield. So you're getting stablecoin payments over the course of the tenure of the instrument, plus additional exposure. So you can effectively get like a safe 8% yield in this case, per enum. Plus you know, additional exposure in our token, so you can effectively speculate on ohm, which is, you know, great, I guess. And then you also have this like over collateralization of the underlying real estate assets. So it's all 100% backed. It's, you know, super safe from that perspective.
00:10:25.252 - 00:10:57.710, Speaker B: So you're getting both the ability to participate in the financing of that property, and then you can actually take your principal and turn it into the house at the end of the day. So you can participate on both sides of it if you so choose, or you can just take your principal back. So that's something you can't really do, or they don't really do that much. Now, as a like smaller ticket investor, like, you're not financing $100,000 into a real estate development and then turning around and then buying a house with it doesn't exist today. So obviously tokenization can help that. So, okay, I'll shut up for the real estate side, but those are two real actual cases that are happening now.
00:10:58.370 - 00:11:17.030, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe like also to draw like a picture for the future. How do you guys see it come together? Like, will people actually know that they interact with a chain here in regards to tokenization? Or like in JP's example, won't even really neck right, they shouldn't. Like, what do you guys think?
00:11:18.490 - 00:12:10.204, Speaker C: Well, I think that a large portion of what makes these things better than off chain assets is the additional layer of programmability and composability, and the assets become more useful. And there will always be this sort of bleeding edge of novel defi application that the user can interact with the chain and use these assets to do. So. For example, today, if you borrow on flux against your OUSG, which is an ondo tokenized T bill, that's a pretty novel application of it. It's an on chain treasury repo, and for the average user, they never had access to that kind of market off chain. So all of a sudden their asset becomes more useful. And going forward in the future, it can be like with USdy, you can use it as collateral on drift for purpose trading.
00:12:10.204 - 00:12:45.460, Speaker C: So if you want to go Giga Max long dogwift hat with T bills backing your position, you can do that. And so I think for some set of power users out there, they're going to want to explore the newest, most interesting use cases. And to the degree that the compliance world will allow it, we should do that. I think for most users, obviously we don't want them on chain. Sometimes I do things on chain, I'm like, I'd really rather not be doing this just for security purposes, but it's always going to be a mix, right?
00:12:47.960 - 00:13:37.084, Speaker D: Yeah, I think totally aligned on that. I think the next step also is liquidity. Composability is key. Liquidity is, I think it's the end game main assets in tradfi, in the real world, if we can say that, are not liquid. And so crypto offers this capacity to organize infrastructure that connect everyone and also gives the possibility to people to own their own asset. And beyond tokenization, when you speak to tokenization, you're right saying that there is few tokenizers and sometimes they are not totally tokenizing the ownership or sometime with a risk of quantum party risk. And this is quite important, I think, and for that regulation need to change a lot to offer a direct ownership on the real world asset.
00:13:37.084 - 00:14:43.266, Speaker D: If it's TBL, I really prefer to have a product like yours that is fully segregated with not a lot of structuration, with counterparty risk, third parties that are in the mix of the setup and having something that is like pristine and that will ensure that the user will have something safe. And that's very important when you want to bridge something from the real world. To defi. The second aspect is clearly, I think the next liquidity in crypto in general will come from the tratfi and tratfi DeFi is just that. There is no possibility to interrupt between old mechanism, all infrastructure and the actual one that we want to develop because we think that it is better. And so clearly we need to try to work also to issue natively some assets. You are speaking about tbils, but wrapping t bills is just having tokenizing is wrapping something that is in paper.
00:14:43.266 - 00:15:42.694, Speaker D: I think the next step is just to tokenize t bills and just issue T bills. And at this moment it will be the end game because the whole infrastructure will have changed. And I have no doubt in ten years that every state will issue their own t bills in a form of a token, because it's the next step for the world trade file to change and use blockchain infrastructure to exchange value. So that's quite important that we focus on having a moment where those tokenizers are like a bridge and we don't need to have good tokenizers that segregate the risk. But on the long term, a part of those guys will not be needed anymore because clearly a part of this asset will be natively issued on chain. I will not see, we mentioned Tesla, Tesla stocks and so on. Clearly that makes sense to have paper in 2013.
00:15:42.694 - 00:15:51.730, Speaker D: Something like that. So it's 2030. It's really a need to have some assets that are natively issued on China.
00:15:52.430 - 00:16:37.872, Speaker B: I mean, I 100% agree with that. Blockchain is a perfect financial ledger, so why don't we use it for finance? That being said, the user experience is still horrendous. To your point, you probably don't want to do everything on chain just yet today. And if you think about it now, the people who actually are going to be interacting with this stuff on chain are still crypto natives. So you need to have a RWA distribution strategy, which actually crypto native people want. That means you need to have products that are actually attractive to them, and novel use cases and composable, like, venues for people to actually do stuff with it that's more used to what they would be doing in Defi. Otherwise they're not going to adopt it, and you're going to have issues there.
00:16:37.872 - 00:17:23.288, Speaker B: So that's why we take this approach of having like, a permissionless layer to the l one which anyone can read and write and do whatever they want on the chain, or, you know, just open defi kind of concept, and then the permission layer that you can interact with the same wallet. From that being said, you know, today's, you know, RWA users will not be tomorrow's. And tomorrow's users are going to, frankly, not want to have to deal with wallets and all the other bullshit that we put up with on a day in and day out basis. You just need to make the user experience better. At the end of the day, they want access to products, and if it's better on chain, that's great, but they don't need to know that it's on a chain, and they don't even need to. I say this as a builder of Al one in five years, you shouldn't even know that you're on mantra. Maybe less.
00:17:23.288 - 00:17:25.180, Speaker B: Honestly, it doesn't matter.
00:17:25.990 - 00:18:04.036, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, this is like something that we talked about since, I would say 2021, when the first DeFi applications really became popular. And I think what I hear a lot is, like, composability. The reason why we want to bring those assets on chain is because it's much more capital efficient. Imagine you could take your home, you need a loan real quick, and you can deposit it, like, broadly speaking, into a liquidity pool. So, yeah, the capital efficiency part makes just sense because banks are closed on Saturdays and on Sunday, and blockchain solves a lot of these problems. This is why it makes sense to bring certain assets on chain. I think that's clear, but let's talk a little bit about the risk.
00:18:04.036 - 00:18:36.956, Speaker A: JP, you mentioned the example of the authorities that help you to tokenize these rwas, but let's bring maybe a crazy example into this picture. Say I tokenize my house and I go to a liquidity pool, and I say, look, I need money very fast. I don't have the time to go to a bank. I basically take advantage of the capital efficiency that crypto provides. I put my house into like, as in form of a token, of course, into this pool. Now this pool gets exploited. I still have the key.
00:18:36.956 - 00:18:41.120, Speaker A: I still theoretically am the owner. But am I really the owner?
00:18:41.780 - 00:19:23.590, Speaker B: So it's a good question. I mean, I think what we're, where we're exploring in this instance is you can use an even more wild example. You can't have the simple uniswap style, anything for anything mono for swapping these assets. Because imagine if you paired a house or treasury bills with a Pokemon card, people are obviously going to find more value. Some people might find more value in the Pokemon card, but others very well may not. So I think you need to take that idea of how we operate in Defi out of it a little bit, and it's not going to be exactly the same, particularly in this real estate example that you just suggested. There would have to be rules about how these things can be bought and sold.
00:19:23.590 - 00:20:01.752, Speaker B: Otherwise you could have things like where you exploit it, exploit the liquidity pool in that instance. And I think one of the things that we're exploring tends to be a little bit more like auction windows, where you have windows for where you can have liquidity. That doesn't mean you're going to sell it, necessarily. And this is talking about whole properties, not pieces of of it or fractionalized. So if you're talking about whole assets, I think it's a different thing than like a fraction of something. Because obviously, like, if you have a house that's divided into a million tokens out there, like, unless someone goes and buys all million of them, they don't actually own the thing. They're buying it for not to live in it.
00:20:01.752 - 00:20:28.190, Speaker B: They're buying it probably for some sort of rental yield, and they're attracted in the asset that's backing it, the token, not necessarily because they're trying to own the whole thing. And actually, that's the place of, you know, where they want to live. Right. So I think it does depend a little bit on the use cases. And, you know, we are exploring the edge cases as well, because there's a lot of them. Yeah. Yes, I think so.
00:20:29.930 - 00:21:07.930, Speaker C: I mean, so in this whole world of ours, like, the question of who owns the house is really, like, who's allowed to live in the house, right. Or who's allowed to rent the house out. And that's defined ultimately by, like, an off chain court system. So for a lot of these things, like, we're used to thinking of them in the, like, cyberpunk. Like, you know, if I steal the entire liquidity pool, do I own all of the houses? Like, and I think. I think ultimately it would come down to, like, the. At that point, it's interesting, this house example, because it's so tangible to everyone.
00:21:07.930 - 00:22:12.600, Speaker C: But in practice, there are big issues around liquidity with this at Ando, why did we do t bills? First? We thought we needed to start in what effectively is the most liquid market off chain, and then we can bootstrap that liquidity on chain. But in a lot of cases, I think what we're going to see is maybe a tokenized house works well in a borrow lend protocol, but it doesn't work well in uniswap. So what do we do? Well, we have the deed tokenization issuer linked into the person's home mortgage account issuer. And if they want it in a tokenized format and they want to take advantage of borrow lend, they can do that. But, you know, I think, like, it's. It's a little bit like, this is why, like, real estate tokenization never worked in the past, right? It's just like, there was not enough liquidity for these, like, super non fungible assets. If you look at, like, any NFT, like fractionalization, it really didn't work well at all, other than maybe like that one doge that, like, mooned.
00:22:12.600 - 00:22:33.840, Speaker C: But like, I. So I think when we think about the future, and this is where Ando's like a little bit differentiated, I think we see a lot more cross communication between the chain and the existing financial entities, especially for things like liquidity, where it really is pretty capital inefficient to bootstrap this stuff directly on chain.
00:22:35.380 - 00:22:48.326, Speaker D: Yeah, I think we spoke a lot about real estate since ten years in crypto. I think the last thing that will be on chain is real estate, because it's.
00:22:48.358 - 00:22:49.046, Speaker B: Disagree.
00:22:49.198 - 00:23:30.122, Speaker D: Yeah, we can have a debate. I will argue. So I think this stuff is too much complicated. You know, what is the loan to value of an house? What is the process of liquidation of this house? When you make a loan, how you ensure that the revenue made by your rent will be distributed to the shareholders of, of this asset. So this, I think the whole model is okay to implement it, but there is so much friction in the actual regimentation that make this subject very complicated.
00:23:30.306 - 00:23:32.218, Speaker B: 100% agree with that.
00:23:32.314 - 00:23:33.042, Speaker D: Okay.
00:23:33.186 - 00:23:36.402, Speaker B: But I disagree with the fact that, you know, it will be coming on chain.
00:23:36.466 - 00:23:37.122, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, it will.
00:23:37.186 - 00:23:40.866, Speaker B: We will do it like literally within this next six months. Hundred percent promise that.
00:23:40.898 - 00:23:43.186, Speaker D: What's, what time that, sorry, what time.
00:23:43.338 - 00:23:59.922, Speaker B: Within this year guarantee full stop. That being said, like will it have all of the bells and whistles that you mentioned? Obviously not. Right. This is a step by step process. You know, the first step that we're working on is actually just the title deed itself. And it'll be a whole property, one of them. Right.
00:23:59.922 - 00:24:25.800, Speaker B: And we are kind of working with both the supply and demand side in this. It's a pilot, but you're also doing it in conjunction with the sovereign government. So it needs to work. The second step is fractionalizing that. And then I think the third step is actually how do you make this composable? How do you interact, enable all these other things that you mentioned? It will take time. So I guess it's more. I disagree only on the idea that it depends on how you actually describe what is tokenization.
00:24:26.580 - 00:24:31.476, Speaker D: I think we kind of agree. I think the main question is what is on timeline within this year.
00:24:31.508 - 00:24:32.026, Speaker B: 100%.
00:24:32.108 - 00:24:49.542, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, maybe it's also the question of what is like more popular, more adopted. I believe we also have already cases of things where something like where real estate has been on chain. But I think it's technically easier to tokenize a stock because you can use.
00:24:49.566 - 00:24:51.510, Speaker B: It much more efficiently other than the regulation apart.
00:24:51.630 - 00:24:51.862, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:24:51.886 - 00:24:53.670, Speaker B: The regulatory part of stock tokenization is a problem.
00:24:53.710 - 00:25:28.310, Speaker D: GP, you mentioned something that is truly, truly true, is that the first token that is like a rapid version of a UST bill is tether. And those guys are making that it's ten years with no transparency and all the stuff that everyone know. But this is something that exists since a long time. The question is mainly absolutely the regulation. But I think it's critical for Defi to have a pristine collateral. I think what you are trying to do, having a US, so USdy, right.
00:25:28.390 - 00:25:30.302, Speaker C: Or USG, the Y stands for yield.
00:25:30.406 - 00:26:18.574, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, but no, the yield is a component that is mandatory. You know, nobody in tratfi will give you money and expect that the future cash flow will go to tetra. Nobody, DPMorgan will not use tetra to bridge with defi with from defi. So clearly you need to have something that is pristine, that give a direct exposure for future cash flow through a t bill. That is an asset that will reuse in DeFi, and that will be the common asset for DeFi as a collateral. So clearly the next step after that is to have regulations that offer not just tokenized tbL, but tokenized stock. And the end game is to issue directly stocks on chain.
00:26:18.574 - 00:26:57.162, Speaker D: But this will, I think this will happen very, very soon because it's really, in terms of tech, it's nothing. It's just, it's a wrapper need to be regulated and ensured that there is no counterparty risk. And after that, it's just for the moment, we have a status quo and we have a lot of factors that don't want that. It's the same for stablecoin with electronic money, where we see that everyone want put the collateral in banks because they just won't defend traditional banks. It's just a matter of monopoly in certain sense. And so we will see that in the future with stocks, because clearly the second thing after tb that makes sense, it's stock on chain.
00:26:57.346 - 00:27:33.750, Speaker C: Maybe I can give a spicy take in response. I think with stocks, it's actually more complicated than people tend to think. It's pretty easy to hold a share somewhere, create an ERC 20 with like a whitelist, and like issue it. And then, you know, maybe you do one of every stock in the S and P 500 and you put out an announcement on LinkedIn, always on LinkedIn, not on Twitter, that says, we have tokenized the world's first s and P 500 fund. Every stock will be on chain someday. It's really the liquidity, right? Like that. That's sort of like the most difficult thing.
00:27:33.750 - 00:28:43.558, Speaker C: And whenever you fragment liquidity across a number of venues, you face some costs, right? And I think one of the things that crypto really brings to the table with tokenized assets is this ability to have instant settlement 24/7 send and receive transparency, all of this. So the demand is there for USDT, USDC, Usdy, like all these products today, to have all of these things. But for most equities, most people don't really want to trade them outside of the current trading hours. There isn't enough demand, probably that's our view, to have replicated liquidity also on chain for these things. And so the way that we sort of see it is like, why don't we issue these things as certificates of ownership effectively? And then you can use the tokens in DeFi or for whatever other benefits that, that you get from being on chain without having the trading actually take place on chain. I think we're going to see most of the liquidity buying and selling and all of that still happening in people's brokerage accounts. But the brokerage account can also in turn mint a token that can be used as collateral and Defi and all that.
00:28:43.734 - 00:29:26.830, Speaker B: I'd actually take the counter to that. And I'll just say from our perspective living, I live in Hong Kong, so I think maybe if there's a US versus like international, and I was actually on a panel with Justin at consensus and Carlos and we were having this like us Nexus versus rest of world Nexus conversation or debate. And I think from what we see in developing markets, they do want to trade us stocks any time of the day. They're like, honestly, Asians are degenerate gamblers. I don't mean that in a bad way. I'm married to one and I, we work with them all the time, but they are, they want to speculate and they want to do it in hours that work for them and that is not in Us market trading hours.
00:29:27.370 - 00:30:11.106, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's really about, and this is what I learned, like from my customers experience, like communities, if you want to put it like this, are so different. People in turkey engage with crypto, much different, differently compared to people in Berlin, compared to people in Hong Kong, compared to people in New York. It's also a cultural thing. But yeah, the time is moving very fast here. But I think like the tlias here really, that the on chain component can make like the treadfi industry much, much more efficient. And it, yeah, there are like a lot of composability parts where it just makes sense to bring real world assets on chain. And yeah, what sticks very to me is like that a lot of people underestimate how tricky it is.
00:30:11.106 - 00:30:28.870, Speaker A: It actually has to bring stocks on chain, whereas something tangible like, yeah, like a real estate might be actually almost a little bit easier. So yeah, thank you, Pierre. Thank you, Matt. Thank you, JP. Thank you guys for listening. And yeah, I'm giving it over to Nina.
