00:00:12.720 - 00:00:19.881, Speaker A: We're really pleased to be co hosting this event with Valence and I'll let Max tell you a bit more about their project.
00:00:20.033 - 00:00:42.509, Speaker B: Awesome. Welcome everyone. Thank you so much for showing up. Yeah, this is our first event where Valence is hosting. Thank you, Seb, one of our early backers, for putting this on. Valence helps protocol protocols do business with other protocols. You can think of it as like in TradFi, there are institutional markets that are much larger than retail markets.
00:00:42.509 - 00:00:54.945, Speaker B: In crypto, the institutions are blockchains, Dapps and DAOs and so we help them do business with each other. So, yeah, I'm excited for this panel. Share a bit more about that. I have these great guests and let's get to it.
00:00:55.925 - 00:01:27.165, Speaker A: So to kick things off, liquidity fragmentation is a pretty big issue in crypto and causes a lot of inefficiencies, overhead costs, et cetera. How do you guys perceive this fragmentation and what are some of the core issues that it causes, possibly in each of your protocols? How do you tackle that fragmentation? Anyone want to take a stop at that?
00:01:28.025 - 00:02:26.543, Speaker C: I can start. I think there are multiple levels of fragmentation. There is one level which is just how many different assets you have and I think in total, like crypto community and like partners, wallets, custodians, whatever, they only have, let's say, capacity for so many different assets to support. So let's say for the assets that are outside of top, maybe 50, it's very difficult to get in front of the users in all these key channels, such as, I don't know, like Binance wallets or like Ledger or something like that. So I think if you're like, if you're an asset outside of this category, then it's way more difficult for you. So I think that's one aspect of the fragmentation. The other aspect is just technical fragmentation in terms of it's more difficult for the DEFI protocols to deal with the liquidity that sits across multiple different chains.
00:02:26.543 - 00:03:18.679, Speaker C: So there is that and you need to deal with this in different ways. And yeah, so I think these are probably the two more most important aspects. I think I know how to deal with the technical aspect of fragmentation and I think this is where actually Cosmos ecosystem is really, really good at, because the cross chain use case in Cosmos work really well now and you kind of don't have to really think where your assets sit before you can use them on any chain in Cosmos. So that's actually a solved problem. The first problem is way more difficult to solve and I think there is more consolidation going on right now as well. So there is more interest to the kind of high performing assets and less and less interest to the altcoins at least like last maybe half a year or a year. So yeah, that's a difficult problem to deal with.
00:03:18.679 - 00:03:21.355, Speaker C: Maybe someone else on the panel has a solution for it.
00:03:22.655 - 00:03:56.231, Speaker B: One thing I'll add here is that some of this fragmentation is a little inevitable. So what do we do about it? One thing that's really important is to just be as efficient as you can with the liquidity that you do have. And we talk about crypto speedrunning a lot of our financial infrastructure, we have dexes that's like the nasdaq, we have lending protocols that's like mortgages. These are pieces of it. But one really big missing piece is monetary policy. It's one of the biggest drivers. When the Fed changes by just a few basis points, the whole world watches.
00:03:56.231 - 00:04:28.965, Speaker B: It's a really important thing. And almost all of crypto has been copying Bitcoin's lead of just defining monetary policy, their inflation rate on day zero and hoping it works out. Obviously Ethereum has made some changes like there are getting a bit more sophisticated but especially as you have new protocols, these challengers going against these incumbents when it comes to fragmentation, they're going to have to make the most of their liquidity. Monetary policy is a really big way of going about that. So I expect to see more of that when it comes to managing this fragmentation issue.
00:04:29.925 - 00:05:18.605, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's really interesting actually the monetary policy point we do have it in cosmos, right? Like inflation rates being set based on like sort of the staking rate. But basically almost no one changes that. Right. And I think other protocols often have like limited supply too, especially the VC backed ones because you want to like say okay, we have this much supply and this percentage of tokens is allocated to certain like ecosystem development stuff. But they don't really take into account that it's actually a protocol that probably needs to, you know, incentivize liquidity and all that. So all that is pretty archaic. Still managed pretty much like, you know, in the best case, I guess some DAO proposals that you know, some outsourced to some sort of consulting firm or something.
00:05:18.605 - 00:05:29.611, Speaker D: So it doesn't seem like it should be a bit more core to, to what the protocols do. And I guess the tooling around that is actually still pretty immature from my perspective as well.
00:05:29.643 - 00:06:09.909, Speaker E: Yeah, I think one thing that we looked into is like working with LPs for liquidity deals. I think right now it's like you work with directly with LPs or family offices, but there's a few tools that are coming to market where this liquidity marketplaces like Royco for example, is coming to market and enables you to do permissionless kind of LP staking. So if I'm a lp, I can get the best deals with infrastructure providers. If I'm a layer one, L2, I can essentially have a marketplace for, okay, I want TV up from this source. So I think there's a better software that's coming to market for liquidity management. I think from a technical point of view, there's a lot of L1s, L2s. You touched on the causal thesis of IBC.
00:06:09.909 - 00:06:23.215, Speaker E: I think IBC comes to L2s as well and working with the union as well. So as bridging drop standards increase and liquidity management software gets better, then I think we can address some of the issues you're seeing.
00:06:24.115 - 00:06:59.035, Speaker A: Yeah, management of liquidity and efficiency I think is a big part of this. And touching on that point, you were talking about how things are inefficient and max as well. How do we help make liquidity management more programmatic and how do we improve efficiency so that we can best manage the liquidity that we already have and arrive at something that looks more like traditional markets rather than this multisig approach that a lot of protocols have taken.
00:06:59.695 - 00:07:49.155, Speaker B: Yeah, I can touch on this. So there are many perspectives on Cosmos and the interchange. One thing that's undeniable is that Cosmos is a really great place to get a peek into the future. So what's happening in Cosmos will likely eventually make its way over to Eth Solana everywhere else. And so something that we're seeing in Cosmos is the Cosmos hub as a whole as a, as an entity deploying liquidity to various strategic places. It could be to an atom staked atom pair to increase adoption of liquid staking neutron doing a bunch of bilateral liquidity deals where they put in half the amount, another protocol put in half the amount and together they bootstrap liquidity on a Dex. That can also be done to a lending protocol.
00:07:49.155 - 00:08:31.821, Speaker B: If you provide liquidity to a lending protocol, interest rates go down, borrowing goes up, fees go up and stimulates defi. And so this is no amount of whales doing this is going to change the monetary policy when the blockchain as a whole takes these actions. It's an incredibly capital efficient way of doing this because the Cosmos hub, they control the inflation rate. So to some extent it's almost Free for them to deploy this liquidity to these various places. And only in the event of impermanent loss might it actually cost them something. And so there have been like some small steps towards this every single time. It's required a governance proposal, which is just a huge pain, a lot of psychic damage, not very efficient.
00:08:31.821 - 00:08:54.383, Speaker B: It's also required a multisig, and so it can't respond in real time. There are a lot of issues. But despite all these issues, these deals are still getting done with like osmosis. There's many of these deals getting done. So as the barriers to entry go down, as it gets more automated, as there are ways for protocols to actually monetize these liquidity deployments, this could be a really big source of liquidity and greater efficiency.
00:08:54.559 - 00:09:28.971, Speaker A: Does anybody else have any thoughts on this topic? All right, I guess you summarized it pretty well. And so what are some strategies that you all are thinking about to attract new liquidity to your protocols? And I think maybe taking a step back also, and this was another topic I had here, was like the global macro situation and how do we bring in more liquidity into the ecosystem generally, but maybe just sort of keeping it within crypto liquidity for the moment. What are some strategies for attracting more protocol liquidity?
00:09:29.163 - 00:10:31.501, Speaker D: Yeah, I think important thing to note right now, I guess in the state of the market, it's kind of the same liquidity moving around. So I guess that's a kind of core of the problem. How do you actually bring net new liquidity in? I think one interesting thing from my perspective also building shared security protocol, is that you can sort of tie these features together partially where maybe you're a protocol and actually, you know, you, you have security needs, you want to be secured by certain assets, and you can also like tie kind of the liquidity part and the security part together, essentially in saying, hey, okay, I allow your token to also provide security to my ecosystem, and in turn we bring some liquidity things like that. So like kind of deals that Max was just talking about, you know, becoming like tying two features together? I also think, yeah, basically, like, I guess some projects are already doing that and I think we will see more of that.
00:10:31.613 - 00:10:38.003, Speaker A: So you think the LT protocols can be security providers, but also like liquidity providers provide more value.
00:10:38.099 - 00:11:04.905, Speaker D: It's very important what sort of assets you get to secure your chain. Right? Like there can be anyone wants to restake, basically. I guess we've seen that there's a lot of supply for staked assets, but it really matters who, who you're kind of taking the security from. So you can either like kind of choose the asset, but maybe you can go more granular and say like, okay, I only take. You only receive the staking yield if you also provide liquidity on the dex on the chain or something like that. Basically, yeah.
00:11:06.965 - 00:12:21.705, Speaker C: Yeah. I think what we see many chains doing recently in terms of what they call either like proof of liquidity or enshrined liquidity or something like that, I think that's a very interesting way because staking yield is a very good way to incentivize liquidity provisioning and liquidity is critical for the ecosystem success, which is basically what we're discussing today. And if you combine these things together, they create a very interesting flyable effect potentially. So, for instance, what Anishi is doing with this enshrined liquidity thing, I think is probably going to be very good for the ecosystem because if they incentivize with the staking yield, the pools that are critically important for the ecosystem, then they kind of force more liquidity into the ecosystem. Therefore there is kind of larger defi that's going to exist in the niche ecosystem, for instance, and therefore there's going to be more, potentially more defi users. I think for any ecosystem, it's very important to kind of cross the chasm between the level of defi adoption, where it's kind of good enough for retail users, to the level of defi adoption, where it's good enough for like more of an institutional VC type of user. So I think for in Atom ecosystem, for instance, now this is not the case.
00:12:21.705 - 00:12:45.795, Speaker C: So if you're like a VC and you want to use, I don't know, like $10 million of Atom to land $3 million of USDC, that's impossible to do. And if you kind of cross this category line and say, okay, now we're at the state of defi where we're good enough for VCs, then I think you actually can unlock a lot of growth and maybe enshrined liquidity is a very good way to do so.
00:12:46.255 - 00:13:03.551, Speaker A: Rishi movements, like got quite a bit of liquidity commitments pre launch. So can you share some strategies or like, you know, your thoughts on what are the best ways that protocols, emerging protocols can secure liquidity. So, you know, so they have liquidity on launch day.
00:13:03.623 - 00:13:41.311, Speaker E: I think our thesis was like L1s and L2s today have done like the points program, which is rather stupid and cooked. I think best examples like a blast where they had like 2 billion TVL and 2 billion like in the token rally. So it's fundamentally no way that the token can actually incentivize LPs. So everyone got mad at blast. Right. So the whole points for TV meta doesn't make much sense. So the way we approach is like the Athena model was really good where you have around 20 institutional LPs off the bat that you have fixed deals with that are going to be there with you even when the bear market comes and they'll provide liquidity for years and stick to them.
00:13:41.311 - 00:14:17.547, Speaker E: So Athena did really well is that at 20 LPs they were original TVL and then you had slow and steady growth and now Athena is a pretty great StableCoin with Healthy TVL. We approach that with L2 as well where we have around 15 LPs. There are some of the biggest names providing TVL from state deeds, wrapped Bitcoin, USDC, etc. And that's locked up for years based on deals that we have with them. So we don't need to do this whole points for TVL farming because that's predatory capital. We prefer institutional capital that's there for highs and lows and slow and steady increased tvl. And I think that's a healthier way to approach it.
00:14:17.741 - 00:14:21.727, Speaker A: And how do you reason about having that liquidity sort of trickle down into the ecosystem?
00:14:21.911 - 00:14:48.167, Speaker E: Well, you have that capital deployed into dapps, for example. So like Echelon's, I mean lending protocol, you'll have the state ETH deploy and lending protocol, we'll have Meridian vaults which enable you to earn APY on the yield aggregation stuff. So all the TVL that we raise will go into the apps themselves actually. And we're working with custodians as well like Anchorage to have a custodial support for the assets and then they have a wallet called Porto. So we'll be one of the first use cases of Porto Wallet coming to.
00:14:48.191 - 00:15:14.443, Speaker A: Other apps and I think like opening up to the whole panel here, you know, when it comes to, you know, allocating liquidity and protocols, you know, what are some of the parameters or. Yeah, that goes into reallocating over time, you know, as the protocol and as the sort of layer one or L2. In this case it's like audits obviously.
00:15:14.499 - 00:15:40.675, Speaker E: If you're deploying capital it has to be secure and like make sure they get the audits done properly. Usually it's the one that has raised venture capital and have communities and are going on to launch sequent tokens as well because there's more financial upside for the ecosystem. So I think it's like legitimacy of the protocol. How serious is the team? Do we know them? Obviously you don't want to king make per se, but even like slant when it started off like kingmake the first like 10 protocols. So any kind of major ecosystem has to do that.
00:15:41.175 - 00:16:13.907, Speaker B: Yeah, we've seen some interesting approaches to do this. So often protocols will just like start by getting just one deal done. So whether it's like one person from one protocol, another person from another protocol, like what are the deal? What's the deal? They'll put it to their governance bodies. If it passes, it gets done. If enough of that happens, they want to scale it. Initiative has their VIP product where and Cosmos Hub has their Attamores Hydro product. It's basically like curve style gauges where like people can vote on where they think this pool of liquidity should go.
00:16:13.907 - 00:16:47.161, Speaker B: And then protocols that want that liquidity can incentivize their gauge so that people have a reason to vote for that. That's another viable option for this. And something that Felix was saying earlier, when it comes to these shared security, when you're a new protocol and you're getting off the ground, you need not just one but two things. You need security, which all these restaking protocols are doing. You also need liquidity. And if you're an lrt, you're taking a bet on this AVS being successful. And so you want to do everything in your power to make sure that that AVS does succeed.
00:16:47.161 - 00:17:02.921, Speaker B: And providing them liquidity on day one helps them do that. It also gives you that much more upside in that protocol, in that AVs, should they succeed. So there are a lot of things that can happen here for liquidity on day zero, but also liquidity over time with these gauges.
00:17:03.073 - 00:17:26.704, Speaker A: Cool. So kind of related to this and I think this is also a question for movement. Building a strong community is really important for long term success. And I think you guys have been very successful so far. You know, pre launch that building community. Can you share some of those strategies? Because that also you know, ties into now like then bringing in liquidity into the ecosystem.
00:17:27.564 - 00:17:56.417, Speaker E: Well I think it's just like having we have a community team that does like helps people organize events. So I think one thing that we're seeing that's unique is we have a huge presence in like Africa and Thailand and like Latam and people are just like organizing their own meetups and we're not even involved. And they'll come to us and be like hey, can we have 100 bucks for pizza. I'm like, of course you get 100 bucks for pizza. Like, sure, go ahead. Or like T shirt money. So I think like one thing that I really prioritize is like, ultimately there's a bunch of infrastructure L walls and L2s.
00:17:56.417 - 00:18:22.259, Speaker E: The number one priority for any system should be community because that's your consumers, that's your target customers, per se. Right. And I think a lot of chains do all the tech stuff and go to market that and like don't really give a shit to the community. And then you find out like, oh, wait, no one's using this thing and no one's buying the token. So I just lost. So I think a lot of chains now have kind of realized that community has come first. And not even just like a hand waving kind of way, like directly.
00:18:22.259 - 00:18:32.055, Speaker E: I work with validator groups, large regional groups, devil groups. I think we have a new meetup every week in some part of the world. So I think we've been doing a good job on that.
00:18:34.315 - 00:19:03.403, Speaker C: Yeah, I think picking up on the validator thing. Validators are often kind of overlooked part of the community. But many of them say validators. Yeah, validators. But many of them have super, super strong kind of local communities. So what we found out is that that's a super powerful channel for us, in fact. And so we have validators who are running like a local workshops where they're kind of educating their communities on liquid staking and such, which is amazing to see.
00:19:03.403 - 00:19:16.839, Speaker C: So once you figure out kind of the right incentive structure for these guys as well, then it starts to work in the surprising ways. So yeah, I think validators are key really to the kind of. To work with the community.
00:19:17.007 - 00:19:45.595, Speaker E: Yeah, especially developing regions. Obviously the user base probably doesn't have all the financial capital to organize events and have the bandwidth for that. Usually the validator groups or investors or like more technically savvy, so they know how to work how crypto works, but also has capital to organize events like this. So I think our go to market as well has been like partnering with regional founder groups and developer groups and they themselves know who are the community members. So that's how we kind of branch out.
00:19:45.895 - 00:20:27.103, Speaker B: Yeah, we talked about liquidity fragmentation earlier. We also have an issue of community fragmentation, geographic fragmentation. We have all sorts of fragmentation. One interesting thing that happened earlier, so Neutron and Osmosis are both cosmos chains, that there was a lot of potential competition between the two. And one of the reasons why that was the case was that there aren't really tools for Them to collaborate and pursue positive some activity. And once those tools existed, they ended up doing a shared liquidity deal between the two of them so that both of them had an interest in each other's success. And yes, they still have some competitive dynamics, but the bad blood between them has almost entirely gone away.
00:20:27.103 - 00:21:00.505, Speaker B: And that was really cool to see that Neutron and Osmosis aren't going to be these two communities fighting for people, but instead like can recognize things that they have in common and pursue pause of some activity that's between two cosmos chains. Like what's going to happen when Bitcoin L2s and ETH L2s and salon L2s start doing business with each other, start interacting and like we as a, as a crypto community start taking action in a more effective direction in a way that we feel a bit more united, less. Less isolated and yeah, create. Achieve that full potential.
00:21:02.525 - 00:21:31.835, Speaker A: Actually, I had a follow up question for Ruchi on this. You mentioned that a lot of your community is in developing markets. A lot of the capital is coming from developed markets, the Western, like Europe and the US when investors are coming to you and to your ecosystem, how do you help bridge that maybe cultural gap between the western investors and developing markets?
00:21:32.215 - 00:22:08.459, Speaker E: I think we are the bridge. So our job is the infrastructure provider, building ecosystem community. For a lot of the western investors, they obviously aren't doing that for building community in Africa and develop in Southeast Asia. But that's kind of our job. Right. So a lot of our work is obviously developing the infrastructure, but I think more importantly like communicating investors. We have done so much work for community meetups, community development in these regions that if you look at exposure to developing markets, one of the only bets I would say in the space where you can directly see the impact where every week there's developer talent coming in, there's builders.
00:22:08.459 - 00:22:23.575, Speaker E: We just did something a hackathon Hangzhou. So Cooper, my co founder is there and we had 10 builders like compete as a top 10. I think it was over 30 builders and 10 won the prize. So I think we are the bridge and we'll continue to do so.
00:22:25.485 - 00:23:21.913, Speaker D: Actually kind of like on a tangent almost. But I think one thing that I think is not talked about enough. I guess it's like sort of this overly institutionalization of crypto and VC funded projects. And I think you can say what you want about points or like airdrops, but basically they're also like very accessible and everyone has sort of the same structure, the same deal as we go. More institutional and preferential treatment for big LPs and big whales and VCs, then obviously all the upside is kind of kept with them and there's not enough actually for the community. So I think fair launches and all the things that we've actually built blockchains for and even ICOs are things that we might want to see more again too in some way to actually also help these people with less money or less access to the teams to also participate.
00:23:22.049 - 00:23:59.115, Speaker A: Yeah, like I was at the Galaxy Movement event the other night and some guy was showing me his new NFT and he says, what do you think about 100 bucks for a mint? I was like, well, look at the markets that you're addressing and is that something that's accessible for most of the people that you're targeting with this mint? And he was like, yeah, okay, maybe 10 bucks is better or maybe 5 bucks is better and that might get you more traction in those places. So as we wrap up here, looking ahead, we're going to open it up a little bit. What innovations specifically, I guess in Defi are you most excited about in the next coming years?
00:24:06.215 - 00:24:32.169, Speaker B: I can start. So I'll start by not showing my own stuff. Like the one thing that is really cool. If you guys haven't checked it out, I recommend checking out baseline protocol. It's a really cool way to get a token off the ground in a way where it's like fully backed removes a lot of removes the need for like market making. Just a bunch of really cool features. I don't want to compare it too much to Olympus to owl, but there are some similarities and it's very neat.
00:24:32.169 - 00:25:12.935, Speaker B: I think that that's going to be best in class for starting a new token. From a just tokenomics, crypto nomics perspective, when it comes to tokens that already exist, I think finding ways for them to do deals with others. We're seeing all these L2s, we're seeing all this restaking and if they just try to do the same exact playbook that all those that came before them did, like they're going to have a really hard time. These challengers are going to need like some new weapons in this liquidity war that's happening. And finding ways to work together I think is going to be one of the better strategies going forward. So I'm really excited for Symbiotic and the sort of restaking protocols they're doing. So yes, that's my answer.
00:25:14.235 - 00:26:23.191, Speaker C: I think from my perspective, we had a bunch of super successful protocols like ANCHOR that were very simple to Use, but also based on some kind of Ponzi. And since then we don't have a similar category of products that would bring more or less predictable yield with a simple ui, let's say. So that all the ways to get yield in Defi now are super, super complex. So if you look at other five strategies, they're all like, oh, you get like these three type of points or that three type of points and it's so difficult to figure out like what are you actually getting and how you when you get these points. Well first of all, when you get them, how you convert them into something tangible and so on. So I think like the next wave of innovation could be how to package all this kind of yield that is that potentially exists there into a product that is straightforward for you to use for any investor that gives gets you more or less predictable yield for the assets that you actually want to hold. So I think it's very simple but it actually takes a lot of kind of effort to put the stuff under the hood together to make good UX for this type of product.
00:26:23.191 - 00:26:28.955, Speaker C: So once we have this, I think we will actually have more, more users actually willing to use these products.
00:26:32.335 - 00:27:05.205, Speaker E: I should bullish like alternative assets. That's interesting. So next week Helix, one of our existing teams announcing the raise and they're working on bringing wrapped Cardano and like Eos and Neo and all these tokens and you might laugh but Cardano is like the seventh biggest token right now in like market cap and no one touches on Defi. So if you can get like 1/100th of Cordana's asset class on your learning protocol, you'll probably be one of the biggest learning protocols in the space. So I'm actually putting a good amount of resources there because no one's doing it bullish Cardano.
00:27:07.365 - 00:27:12.605, Speaker D: Yeah, everyone talking about Bitcoin but you're going for the alternative assets. That's actually quite interesting.
00:27:12.725 - 00:27:15.345, Speaker E: I want to take all the dead chip tokens.
00:27:16.445 - 00:28:04.329, Speaker D: Yeah, I think I'm general more I guess also on the infra side. So I'm still more excited about some of the advances there both in zk. I guess we've talked about that a lot. Right. But also privacy enhancing tech, I think threshold encryption and you know, stuff like that is still very interesting to me and minimizing sort of the negative impact of MEV and things like that and you know, just all that maturing and stuff that we've talked about in theory for years now, kind of working out, coming to market and I think that's where we're going this cycle and hopefully it will finally happen and we will be able to like have apps that consumers actually use at some point.
00:28:04.417 - 00:28:55.543, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, I think to the point of Cardano, I think that's actually a very good point because if you think about all these altcoins that are sitting, sitting there idle, that's like billions and billions of dollars of potential liquidity that are not used for anything. I think like until FTX crash there was a huge lending market and they actually could be used in this lending market in like galaxies of the world. And since then this market basically completely collapsed. And for now this lending market for alts only exists in the largest centralized exchanges. So I think if we figure out some kind of a decentralized protocol that actually is capable of taking yield of these altcoins and so that people can maybe like just borrow USDC against it, like a reasonable rate and use it somewhere else, I think that will open up so much liquidity you won't believe it. I think that's going to be huge.
00:28:55.619 - 00:28:57.275, Speaker A: Cardano is pumping right now.
00:28:58.775 - 00:29:07.735, Speaker E: So the thing you're looking for is called Helix and they're announcing the race next week. So Cordano Bullish.
00:29:07.895 - 00:29:14.199, Speaker A: All right. Not financial advice. All right, thank you so much guys. Thanks for everybody coming and thanks to our panel.
