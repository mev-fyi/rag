00:00:08.039 - 00:00:08.151, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:00:08.151 - 00:00:41.080, Speaker B: Thanks for coming to convergence. We're interop Ventures. We're an early stage fund investing in the modular ecosystem stack. We are very bullish on the Cosmos ecosystem generally and the Cosmos stack. And so that's the topic of the panel today, is the convergence between Cosmos and Ethereum. And hopefully we'll get to the question, or to answer the question, does Cosmos need Ethereum more, or does Ethereum need Cosmos more? So I'll hand it over to Clement.
00:00:42.460 - 00:01:23.508, Speaker C: Thank you very much. So thank you very much for being here solely. I know we all have really busy schedules during Eve Denver. We're really pleased to bring you this panel, and we'd like to thank you also Noble and Polygon teams who co host this event with us. And so it's thanks to you guys that we are in such great venue enjoying this breakfast. So thank you very much. We like to gather together like founders, builders and investors, and I hope you will join enable next summer in Brussels.
00:01:23.508 - 00:01:35.404, Speaker C: So it's going to be just after HCC's. And if you would like also to sponsor and to be part of this event, please talk with Mia, who is somewhere around with the interrupt suite.
00:01:35.572 - 00:02:19.220, Speaker B: So while I was preparing this panel and the questions and everything, speaking with all of you, and there's this question that kind of keeps coming back in a lot of conversations that I have on the podcast as well. And that question is, what is Cosmos? And now Cosmos seems to be in this perpetual identity crisis, and the answer to that question seems to be shifting all the time. Now, there are some sort of true cosmonauts here, but I think to start it off, it would be great to get an outside perspective. So I'd like to ask, Sandeep, from your perspective, coming from the outside of the space, you know, what is cosmos to you, and why is it relevant?
00:02:19.640 - 00:03:22.474, Speaker D: For me? Like, I always see Cosmos not as a. As a tech phenomena, but more of a, you know, community phenomena, which, where you have teams who believed in the multi chain thesis, like, back in 2017, when everybody, like, not many people thought that this is the. And also, I see it as the teams who value sovereignty of their chains a lot. And that's, for me, that's the most defining thing of the Cosmos community, that everybody values sovereignty, which then translates into, like, there is too much decentralization inside the inside Cosmos community. So a lot of reasons don't get made. But the most inspirational thing for me is that, and not many people realize, know maybe in the Cosmos community, that the polygon pos chain actually an important part of that stack for decentralizing is Cosmos SDK. And on top of that, there's a EVM client.
00:03:22.474 - 00:03:25.670, Speaker D: So big believers of Cosmos from old days.
00:03:26.610 - 00:03:33.390, Speaker B: Anybody else want to. Yeah, Yolana, actually, maybe. All right, go ahead.
00:03:36.190 - 00:04:07.500, Speaker E: Awesome. So, yeah, I mean, I think that the way that I look at Cosmos is, I think over the years, like, there's. Cosmos is like, the staff, Cosmos is the community, and then Cosmos is the asset. And I think it's like, really, depending on who you ask over what period of time, you'll get different answers. But I think initially, like, Cosmos was equivalent to Adam, and Adam was, like, the main asset. The entire community was around. Cosmos Hub was the first Cosmos blockchain.
00:04:07.500 - 00:04:49.390, Speaker E: And I think the entire community came from working on the Cosmos hub in some way, shape or form back in 2018, et cetera. And I think today, Cosmos, I think, is like a permutation of three things. It's the SDK, tendermint and IBC. So some people will say Cosmos is all three. Some people will say Cosmos is two of the three, and some people will say Cosmos is one of the three. So I think that's actually kind of what Cosmos is. Maybe the most generic definition, from my perspective, is just like, the IBC connected blockchain world, and probably, like, going forward, like, that will be the most inclusive definition of Cosmos.
00:04:49.390 - 00:05:28.130, Speaker E: So you can have things like ret side chains that have route execution that implement IBC. And so they can use a lot of the cosmos infrastructure via IBC. And IBC abstracts away a lot of things that you can do. I do think, like, a lot of ways that a lot of Ethereum builders today are looking at Cosmos is just, if you need out of protocol consensus, if you need to build a layer one instead of L2, the easiest way to spin up a layer one today for any type of application infrastructure is to use a cosmos chain, which is the SDK. And then there's always, like, you know, the atom community and different communities within cosmos as well. So that's my perspective.
00:05:28.750 - 00:05:42.690, Speaker B: Good perspective. I think there's another question there. Maybe I'll just leave it open here. But it's like, if, does the stack continue to exist without the community? And does the community continue to exist without the stack? But, yeah, we won't get into that.
00:05:43.150 - 00:05:57.090, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll give my perspective, actually. Just a show of hands, who's, like, quite confident they know what cosmos is. Just curious. Like, show of hands. Okay, so still, who has a bad kid? Yeah. Who has a bad kid? Okay, so that. That's actually, the real alignment right there.
00:05:57.090 - 00:06:29.770, Speaker A: Yeah. So, I mean, for me, the thing I would say is Cosmos is a philosophy for how blockchain should be built. Sandeep talks a little bit about this, like, multi chain vision that a lot of us got behind kind of early on. It's also the modular vision, kind of an antithesis to monolithic vision. So this idea that you can plug and play with various components of the Cosmos stack, you can use IBC out of the box, you can obviously leverage the SDK build on top of that. So it's more of a philosophy of how the world should exist in the future with, obviously, sovereignty and interoperability at its core.
00:06:31.270 - 00:06:59.620, Speaker F: I think the website says Internet of blockchains, right? You achieve this state where IBC is everywhere coming, and it's less the focus on the SDK that's the focus. Attainment and to bring IBC and connectivity to cosmos chains, to ethereums, l one s, l two s, next gen chains, EVM chains, regardless of what stack. So I think IBC is the main focus, and that's my definition. Usually, any chain that's IBC connected, you can bring nobility, whether it's ethereum, ecosystem, cosmic system. And that's gonna make Polkadot salon ecosystem as well. I think that's the definition.
00:06:59.780 - 00:07:25.080, Speaker G: Yeah, fully agree with that. For me, the definition also, anything that can be connected with IBC is cosmos. And I think from almost a philosophy perspective, Cosmos is the realization that as a protocol, you don't want to pay hundreds of millions in gas to the underlying l, one that you're operating on, instead of full value accrual to your community, in your own ecosystem. So it's the IBC components and really the sovereign components as well, that I think drives people to this ecosystem.
00:07:26.020 - 00:08:00.800, Speaker B: So I want to talk a little bit about the alignment meme. And so, like, alignment has been a topic that has been discussed, you know, throughout, throughout crypto and all ecosystem. Like, where do we align? And I think with Cosmos, there is conversations within the ecosystem about what is alignment. Do we align with the hub? Do we align with Ethereum? Do we align with bitcoin? And different folks in the space have different opinions about that. But specifically here, what is Ethereum alignment? And what do chains gain and possibly give up by aligning with Ethereum?
00:08:01.840 - 00:08:43.976, Speaker A: I'll start off. So there's like, two ways to align. There's ways to align with the Ethereum chain itself, and there's ways to align with the ETH asset itself. And sometimes there's trade offs for going either direction. And also if you go with both directions, there's also kind of trade offs there as well. So for me, from the cosmos perspective, we're obviously as modular people that love sovereignty and really emphasize permissionless interoperability for us, we're more interested in, I would say from my perspective, from the ETH asset itself, this idea that the ETH asset itself has gained all this traction, it has mind share. It's this highly secure, highly well adopted asset that's great.
00:08:43.976 - 00:09:03.626, Speaker A: Aligning with the Ethereum chain itself, I think, is a little bit harder. Obviously, there's folks that are looking to expand IBC into that ecosystem, so you get alignment from that perspective. But I do want to kind of distinguish between those two facets, alignment with Ethereum the chain, and then alignment with ETh, the asset. And those are actually two very, very different paths that you could take.
00:09:03.778 - 00:10:27.040, Speaker D: I would actually like, I would say exactly same, similar to that, but like there is an alignment with ETh, the asset, and there's an alignment with Ethereum. Not the chain, but ethereum, the philosophy, right? Like the philosophy of like, you know, creating this trust less, open, censorship resistant world and where, you know, we can build these trustless economies and all that. And I think, you know, people always confuse about these, these two things, like the people who are like fanatics, like they look like fanatics, they are mostly aligned with e three asset and they want everything to be accruing value back to the eTh. And that's when like, you know, you end up into the situations where people start building for that Ethereum alignment as like the ETH alignment, as well as the technical purity which accrues maximum value. It's not the technical purity, but sometimes it's a purity which accrues the maximum value back to the ETH. And that's when a lot of products that get built around, and we have been guilty of that also, we build a very Ethereum aligned product, like the ZKVM. We built a user aligned product, and it's very clear that the ZkVM, like the version one that we came out with, is very technically pure, like the first.
00:10:27.040 - 00:11:22.406, Speaker D: All the transactions get sequenced and then they get proven and all that, and then turns out the user don't like that experience that much. So I think Vitalik also talked about this in his recent post, which is make Ethereum cypher for again, where about this, you know, where he has talked about this Ethereum alignment, and many of the times people are trying to align with ETH and yet forgetting the user. And, you know, we should be working more towards aligning with Ethereum the core thesis and the philosophy, the thing that brought a lot of people to Ethereum in the first place. And that is actually the biggest power of Ethereum, actually. That philosophical thing. Like, I'll give you, like, just to, at the expense of taking a little bit more time. I'll give you a very interesting anecdote is that we were in our board meeting and our founder, like, one of the co founder, JD Jody Bellina, was there, right? Like, he's pretty famous in the Ethereum community and all that.
00:11:22.406 - 00:12:00.924, Speaker D: And I asked him, like, you know, because we were debating very heavily about the technical purity, which compromises little bit on the user experience and all that. I said, jordy, what is more important to you is, is like, you know, the, the purity and the ETH alignment, or the, you know, alignment with the poll itself. And Jordy's reaction was, yeah, yeah, you know, pole alignment, all that. And I was like, like that for that moment, few seconds, like, this is the power of Ethereum, where people like Jordy, me, like a lot of other, like, I also consider myself fairly ethereum, you know, not maximalist, but like, very ethereum.
00:12:00.972 - 00:12:01.720, Speaker B: Aligned.
00:12:02.030 - 00:12:14.350, Speaker D: Aligned. Also, like, you know, that's like a mistake. But, but like, you know, that is the power of Ethereum and that's the power of philosophy, not eat the asset. Like, jordy cares zero about money, right?
00:12:14.470 - 00:12:14.774, Speaker F: And.
00:12:14.822 - 00:12:22.650, Speaker D: But he's aligned with the, the philosophy of Ethereum. I think that's the most powerful thing. And that's where most of the people and even I want to focus more instead of.
00:12:24.950 - 00:12:26.582, Speaker B: Yeah, go ahead, I'm gonna.
00:12:26.606 - 00:12:48.542, Speaker E: Have a hot take. Do it. Yeah, I think alignment is actually a meme. I don't think it exists in any way. And I think anyone who says otherwise actually is part of some political situation in crypto. And the reason why I say this is actually, like, what's really interesting is, like, there's a lot of align. I actually agree with a lot of what Sandeep said, actually.
00:12:48.542 - 00:13:30.824, Speaker E: So there's like, many levels of alignment, basically. But like, I think many times, like, alignment, at least from my perspective, over, like, many years, what I've seen is alignment sometimes very helpful for, like, bringing community. Alignment is like, really good for business development and marketing, but also it can be like an impediment to a lot of things. So, like, actually even thinking outside of Cosmos, even within Ethereum, like, what's going on today? Like, there's out of protocol infrastructure, out of protocol innovation roll ups that are completely off blockchain. Like, just the state is on the roll up, but the sequencer and da, or off roll up. Now Justin Drake wants to build base roll ups to bring some value back to the Ethereum. L1 blockchain, other people are trying to build around the asset.
00:13:30.824 - 00:14:07.514, Speaker E: And then it's like, are you aligned? Are you aligned? And then I think everyone in Cosmos is asking, are we aligned? And so I think that's actually what's happening right now. And the funny thing is, like, everyone's talking about bitcoin alignment and all this type of alignment stuff, but this actually all exists in a world where there's no shared security hub that is launched except for the cosmos hub. And I think that it's really easy to talk about narratives and, like, nothing actually exists. But my sense is that, especially as we keep going, maybe alignment is something that's really good because it brings people together. In a bear market, there's no liquidity. There's only infrastructure. But once you have liquidity, you have infrastructure.
00:14:07.514 - 00:14:26.486, Speaker E: I think Polygon did this really well in the last cycle. It becomes more about functionally. Like, what is my gas fee? What can I do? What is the product? What is the UX? And it's like, functionally, what does, like, infrastructure provide you if you're another infrastructure builder? Or what does this platform provide you if you're a user? I think that's actually what retail cares about a lot more.
00:14:26.558 - 00:14:28.606, Speaker B: So alignment's a bear market coping mechanism.
00:14:28.678 - 00:15:02.820, Speaker E: I think it's like, everyone builds infrastructure in a bear, in a bear market, and then you're all trying to align infrastructure in a bear market. And so I think that's what happens. We have, like, five DA platforms. We have multiple shared sequencers. We have no consensus on, like, what is the right way to align with Ethereum. So I actually am, you know, I actually think in some ways, like, ethos, like, we definitely talk about alignment and stuff, but more from, like, a fundamental perspective, like, beliefs in crypto. I think that alignment maybe really makes sense for community building, but, like, never should be, like, an impediment to thinking about things from first principles.
00:15:03.360 - 00:15:21.942, Speaker A: I'll just. Okay, just one, like, slightly hot take. So I tweeted this meme. Like, speaking of memes, it was like the Drake meme, like, where he's like, nah. And he's like, yeah, and like, the Na one was ethereum alignment, and like, the. Yeah, one was IBC alignment. And the reason that that is is because Ethereum alignment is.
00:15:21.942 - 00:15:49.746, Speaker A: Is tricky. It's, like, very complicated because you do have the asset that accrues value, and as soon as you have money in the mix, it becomes very complicated. Whereas IBC does have a token. Like, there is no IBC. Like, obviously, there's, like, chains, like, building and, like, interop standards, like, building with IBC, that have tokens. But the fundamental, like, IBC standard with, like, that's, like, maintained by the interchange foundation and other teams, like, that does not have a token. And so, like, the killer, you know, interop standard will not have a token, and, like, that's where the alignment is.
00:15:49.746 - 00:15:53.258, Speaker A: So actually having a token compromises alignment. That's the hot take.
00:15:53.354 - 00:16:26.262, Speaker G: Yeah. For me, I kind of agree with what you were saying that ties into the value accrual. I would almost say alignment is, are you going to pump someone else's bags? I think that's why. That's why Eigen layer is so successful, right? Because basically, ETH itself is going to be the value accrual mechanism, and so existing holders are going to benefit in and from this. I think this is partially why Cosmos had to transition to more of a tech play, sovereign play, because, really, we don't have alignment around atom in the cosmos ecosystem. We have alignment around the ethereum direction, but not the eth direction itself. If Atom is able to capture that, we can do the same.
00:16:26.262 - 00:16:34.078, Speaker G: I think perhaps that opportunity window is now gone, and actually, a lot of the value accrual will go back into ETH alignment itself with Cosmos tech alignments.
00:16:34.214 - 00:16:35.402, Speaker B: That was my next question.
00:16:35.526 - 00:16:46.690, Speaker D: But one thing I wanted to. You said that anybody who's thinking about alignment is mostly political. And inherently, it means that they want to gain something out of it. That's why they're showing alignment.
00:16:46.770 - 00:16:48.390, Speaker B: I think this mic's not on. Right.
00:16:51.770 - 00:17:15.792, Speaker D: So there are people in my team which would. They don't give up f about whether the value accrues later on. And this is a very controversial take. Like, you know, for polygon, I'm saying, like, whether the value accrues to polygon or not, they want to do the right thing. They want to change the world. And, you know, it's. It's wrong to say that hundred percent of them are, like, you know, politically aligned.
00:17:15.792 - 00:17:39.554, Speaker D: I would say there are three different categories. One is, you want to be aligned because you want to pump, you know, your bags or somebody else's bag, and it's good for marketing and all that. There is another alignment where you want to be a win win. You want Ethereum to also win, and you want your project to also win. Like, think I lie in that. I definitely do want Ethereum to also win. Like, and I, and I hope, like, you know, people in the cosmos community don't take it offensively.
00:17:39.554 - 00:17:58.216, Speaker D: I definitely feel that Ethereum as a. As a philosophy, what they have created is, is something. Something to stand for. And then there is this other extreme, which is people who care about changing the world. And I have seen those people. They don't care. Like, I'm telling you, they don't give up about what their token does.
00:17:58.216 - 00:18:05.700, Speaker D: They want to do the right thing. And so I just say that, okay, 99%, but there are 1% people who are there to change the world.
00:18:06.240 - 00:18:11.260, Speaker B: So this cosmos alignment exists. Is that a thing? Can you be cosmos aligned?
00:18:11.880 - 00:18:34.906, Speaker G: I think only in the technical sense, just like Ethereum alliance, focusing on the trustless nature and kind of your purity. You can be Cosmos alliance and focus on the sovereignty and allowing anyone to build. There were definitely also atom aligned projects, but those have, I think, faded away a bit over time since there's no value accrual mechanism for new projects into atom. Maybe, like, neutron is the most atom aligned project out there.
00:18:35.058 - 00:18:57.660, Speaker F: The question is it modular line or Cosmos line? I think we're seeing more celestial projects come to ecosystem and kind of not really take the Cosmos narrative, but saying we're modular, bringing different vms, different sequencers, and leaning more into the celestia eigen DNA. So the question is, is it cosmos alignment or is it modular alignment? Are the separate things or contained? I would say it's modular. I'm everything right now, not cosmos alignment.
00:18:58.320 - 00:19:41.356, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, I still think, like, a really good case study is dy Dx and Antonio and I think that alignment. So, again, right. I think, like, alignment for modular is very much a BDN marketing thing. When you say modular, your series a valuation goes up by two x, and everyone knows this. And so I think that what's interesting is, like, you can create mini alignments in terms of narratives. I think it's really good for being able to build infra and provide signal and build community, basically. But I think the really interesting example is even Celestia.
00:19:41.356 - 00:20:03.388, Speaker E: What is Celestia? Celestia was going to build DA, like, lazy ledger, and that turned into DA for rollups. Why do you need DA for rollups? Because l one for Ethereum is not sufficient DA for a roll up. And so you have to build out of protocol. Okay, I have to build a protocol. What do I do? I need a layer one. Where do I go? For layer one cosmos SDK. Same thing with Dy Dx.
00:20:03.388 - 00:20:39.220, Speaker E: Like, I have a single sequencer roll up on Starknet. This isn't sufficiently decentralized. I want to do gasless order books on multiple nodes. How do I achieve consensus on those nodes? Tendermint, where do I go for that constant SDK? So I do think there's a sense of you can create a nexus of. For a builder that wants to do xyz, you can either build a roll up or you can build your own l one. And you can also build an ecosystem around that l one, which is what Barachain did. So I do think, like, in some sense, I'm still against alignment as a word.
00:20:39.220 - 00:21:31.306, Speaker E: I think it's short term was like very important. I think long term will lead to a lot of like controversial, not first principles based decisions. That's actually why I think like Polygon, which is like a side chain, not even a roll up, was actually the lowest cost option of transacting nfts and stuff in the last bull market. And it was actually like the place where a lot of people just went for like close to zero transaction fees. And so I do think when retail reenters the space, it'll be more about functional. What does this infrastructure do for your protocol? In the sense that you're using and looking at different pieces of protocol for your actual, whatever use case, whether it's security or DA or whatever, for the end user, they're just going to pick the protocols that have the best DPD to build. You know, the greatest number of modes.
00:21:31.306 - 00:21:46.426, Speaker E: If you're like a bridge, it's like, how many places do you connect to if you're an l one blockchain? Like how much liquidity you have if you're like a defi application? Like, you know, like, what is it like to use your actual application? So I'm like more bullish on that long term, which is like kind of my original point.
00:21:46.498 - 00:22:10.238, Speaker D: I mean, so my disagreement, only small disagreement, has been like, as I said, 99% of what you said. Correct. But it's at the tactical level. When I'm talking about alignment, I'm talking about the strategic level. Like, not, not even strategic strategy is also a small word. I'm talking about the value alignment level. Like people go and die for capitalism versus communism, right? I am talking about that level of philosophy.
00:22:10.238 - 00:22:52.640, Speaker D: I think blockchains are that kind of civilizational phenomena. Trustlessness is that kind of phenomena. And I think like, you know, there is a class above that which doesn't care about this tactical stuff, whether it will two x my valuation or not, whether it will pump my token or not, they want to do the right thing. And there are, like, I, at least in Ethereum community, I have met multiple people. And I think, like I've said internally, like, the day we have ten of those people, ten organically external people who believe in the mission of polygon, what we are doing. And we have done a lot of transition in the last two, three years because of all the ZK and all that. And I said that then that day we will be successful.
00:22:52.640 - 00:23:05.900, Speaker D: I think Ethereum has probably 50 to 100, not thousands, 50 to 100. Those people who would do. Who want to do what, you know, or who want to be aligned with Ethereum because they think this is the right thing.
00:23:06.680 - 00:23:37.412, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, just the one thing I would say, like, whether you call it alignment or, like, a philosophy or, like, a vision, like, the thing about cosmos that I would just, like, emphasize is the one thing that binds us is, like, maximal sovereignty. So, like, not giving up control of your stack, like, not compromising on your validator set, like, not compromising all of these, like, that, that is just. Cause it is, like, pure maximal sovereignty. And, like, that's the reason, like, I got into this phase because I saw challenges with not having sovereignty building in other ecosystems. And so if anything, like, that's the meme. Just one thing I will say.
00:23:37.412 - 00:24:01.430, Speaker A: When I was working on the Adam 2.0 kind of project and paper with, like, a bunch of other cosmos people, one thing we had in the. In the vision kind of charter that never really saw the light of day because it was voted down before it could thrive. One thing was the right to fork, and that was another thing. That is sovereignty. The right to fork. We have a co founder of Cosmos, forking the hub right now.
00:24:01.430 - 00:24:06.954, Speaker A: That's cosmos. It's a bit chaotic, but it's all about maximal sovereignty.
00:24:07.002 - 00:24:29.252, Speaker D: That's beautifully said. That's what I'm saying. That sovereignty, part of Cosmos, for me, is the most defining feature. That's why I love Cosmos, because it promotes maximum sovereignty. Do what you want to do. And that's why, like, maybe we have these opinions, because what you want to do, maybe you want to align with yourself and you want to do things which are best for your project. And I think Cosmos is the only ecosystem which allows you to do that fully, freely.
00:24:29.252 - 00:24:34.084, Speaker D: And that's the value to, like, not. Not die for, but value to, you know, fight for.
00:24:34.172 - 00:24:36.240, Speaker B: So when you change your PFp to a bad kid.
00:24:42.310 - 00:25:01.726, Speaker D: I just like, add polygon. Ag layer. This is what exactly we are fighting for. Like, you know, provide l two s, as you would all say, that l two s probably don't have sovereignty. But what we are doing at ag layer is basically, we are trying to build these layers. They are not even layer. For example, near protocol is joining ag layer.
00:25:01.726 - 00:25:13.120, Speaker D: That's not L2. They are fully sovereign. Layer one. Kanto, for example, the cosmos ecosystem is looking to join that layer, and that's the thing that we are trying to build, because that's the most beautiful thing about cosmos.
00:25:13.740 - 00:25:23.828, Speaker B: Great. I think this is a good time to transition into the second part of the panel. Are you good on time, or do you. Okay. Yeah. So Sandeep has to leave. Thank you so much for coming.
00:25:23.828 - 00:25:26.652, Speaker B: Thank you, guys. Have a good rest of your. Ethan, Denver.
00:25:26.716 - 00:25:27.480, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:25:32.990 - 00:26:10.920, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe, like, another ten minutes. So I did want to talk a little bit about ethos, as we've talked a lot about the sort of philosophical implications of alignment. Now, like, ethos is coming into the cosmos ecosystem with a way for chains to leverage restate eth as an underlying security layer. So what do chains gain from leveraging eigen layer? And what are some of the challenges in transitioning? Because I know you're working with sommelier to transition into this new security paradigm. What are some of the challenges that you're seeing there?
00:26:12.420 - 00:27:02.266, Speaker E: Yeah, absolutely. So I think the original thesis of Cosmos was that, again, you can have your full sovereign l one, you can launch your own l one, and the fact that you have an SDK and the toolset to do that is actually fantastic. I think over the years, there's been a couple different obstacles in the Cosmos space. And I think what we saw, especially in the depths of the bear in summer of 2023, it was really difficult to be an l one. It was very enticing to be an l two. And personally, I felt that I was a little sad, just because, really, I think the original vision was that you can have app chains, you can have different types of ecosystems, and then somehow, some way, like, all of the stuff is abstracted away. And so the UX is, like, kind of very nice across, like, the cosmos ecosystem.
00:27:02.266 - 00:27:42.650, Speaker E: That was the original vision, I feel. And so I think a huge part of that, like, part of it maybe is, like, the, you know, political issues and, like, the community within kind of cosmos. And so maybe part of it, to be said, is, like, a bit more of, like, execution. There's also something very fundamental to what it means to build an l one that's very difficult. So if you're building a monad or a near, I mean, these are very large l one s. And so it's one off instances maybe, like, you can pull it off, but in the sense that many people have to build an l one in cosmos for the whole ecosystem to make sense, that's really difficult, because when you build an l one, you have to go figure out your validator set. You have to launch your token.
00:27:42.650 - 00:28:25.920, Speaker E: I think one thing we saw in l two s was, like, delayed token launches, where you can have points and airdrop systems ways to game that. And that kind of led to yield stacking and kind of this, all this kind of innovation that's leading to this current bull market. You don't have any of that in cosmos because you have to inflate 20% on day one just to have a security set for your actual blockchain. And so I think, like, a very core reasoning of, like, why we're coming into cosmos actually has nothing to do with alignment. It just has to do with, like, fixing those very fundamental issues of just, like, making it almost as easy to launch an l one as it is to launch an l two. So you have, like, a very high quality, very cheap, very accessible liquidity asset. Liquid asset, which is restaked ether.
00:28:25.920 - 00:29:01.410, Speaker E: You can launch an l one on top of it. We can do any number of, you know, improvements and functions that allow, like, completely solver and l one s with their own block space to interoperate with each other. Like, there's quite a large number of things that you can do maybe on ethos in the future. But I do think the general purpose was really just to go back to making it easy to launch an l one and making people a lot more interested in experimenting within cosmos. And I think that's actually going to be the end vision of what we're trying to build at ethos with regards.
00:29:01.450 - 00:29:50.390, Speaker B: To interoperability in this whole new paradigm. We were talking about this when we were prepping for the podcast. I think there's a world in which most cross chain transactions are settled in USDC, and there's tons of interoperability protocols in this space. Union is one of them, that are building ways to do message passing across ecosystems. What is the role of USDC in the cross chain interoperability story? And what is the role of a project like union? And of course, there's axlar and polymer and so many other projects that are building message passing protocols. How do you guys sort of balance these two functions? Asset liquidity, movement, and message passing.
00:29:50.770 - 00:30:28.344, Speaker G: I think there's a question of alignments. Again, personally, I'm not USA aligned, and so I actually think it's a threat to the whole of crypto that we base too much on USDC itself. I think the value proposition of stablecoins and all assets that are originally derived from crypto can be much larger than actually using stablecoins as the main mode of transfer. So far it's gone well. And actually circles protocol can be used within IBC as well. They designed it very well, so it might indeed be the main mode of value transfer. To me, that would be a little bit of a sad endgame for crypto, though, and for all other assets, lp tokens, different structures, products that built on top.
00:30:28.344 - 00:30:47.900, Speaker G: We do need intra protocols to support that. We can't rely on circle or oracles or have every single issuance run their own intro protocol. That would lead to a world where we have basically, I think thousands, 10,000 custom roles, intro protocols, all by the issuers themselves, which lead to further attack vectors.
00:30:48.280 - 00:31:28.184, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, good points. The thing I would say is obviously there's two major stable coins right now in USDC. They're actually used very differently. Tether is very much used like in the real world for payments and for non crypto people. Right? Whereas USDC, although it's also used for payments and things like this, it's actually used more for settlement of transactions. So USDC almost becomes like a circle, I guess, because the settlement layer, which definitely poses challenges, I would say, in terms of decentralization and more crypto kind of native products from taking off. I mean, for now, again, because of what you just said about CCTP, it is just a really, really, really easy way to bridge between ecosystems.
00:31:28.184 - 00:32:00.310, Speaker A: Like if I want to go from ETH to Cosmos, I can do that without having to use a custodial bridge or like a multisig bridge or whatever. I can just use CCTP and then be done with it and then swap out of USDC and do other stuff. So it is good infrastructure. That's actually how I look at USDC. It's more around infrastructure and settlement, you know, whereas like tether is more like payments and like, you know, real world, you know, you know, use cases, whatever those use cases might be. So that's how I currently look at the system.
00:32:00.690 - 00:32:21.698, Speaker F: I would push back a little bit on your point. I would say, like, the stable quite end game is actually good. I'm thinking about what would my mom use IBC? And it'd be for USDC she's not like deejetting EtH into uniswap. If she did, that'd be pretty basic. But like my mom was, if she ever used IBC to send money from New York to Bangkok, it's going to be for stable coins. It's going to be through circle. She's going to want to use Coinbase.
00:32:21.698 - 00:32:34.930, Speaker F: That's because she barely knows how to use a phone. So, like when we're actually trying to get people on chain using cosmos beyond the ten developers and 500 users that we have, it's going to be stable coins. And that's a major use case. And that's a good end game. It's the best way to save money.
00:32:35.050 - 00:33:05.944, Speaker G: I think, like stablecoin Endgame is a good endgame. I think the risk is hedging this on a single stable coin. Right? Right now, the risks that we're unaware of, for example, is complete censorship attacks. Circle technically right now is a payment service provider facilitating cross border transfers for anyone that's not KYCs. And the moment the us government picks up on this, we might run into significant issues. Will Penumbra be able to access USDC at all or does it need to be fenced off? I think at the moment we're going to get away with this for the next couple of years, but long term, I'm not sure what's going to happen here if we don't have alternatives.
00:33:06.082 - 00:33:41.520, Speaker A: Fun fact, just for the us dollar, like demand for the us dollar, about 60% to 70% of that demand is outside of America. So yeah, like when you're in America, it's pretty surveillance oriented. Like, it's pretty hard to do stuff with your us dollar when you're inside of America. Like it's an asset that's liquid, that is used all over the world for things that have nothing to do with the american empire. Like, yes, indirectly there is like, you know, bonds and whatever. Like we don't have to get into that discussion right now. But point being, like, even just for the us dollar itself, it is an asset that is used outside of America for like very non american interests, if that makes sense.
00:33:41.520 - 00:33:46.440, Speaker A: So, you know, anyways, it's more of a philosophical discussion, but something to consider.
00:33:47.900 - 00:34:05.196, Speaker B: So one last thing I want to touch on before we wrap up, and I know this is a bit hodgepodge towards the end of the panel here, but what's the bull case for all, all vms in this, in this whole convergence story? And yeah, where does movement sort of sit within all this?
00:34:05.308 - 00:34:29.502, Speaker F: I think going back to the point with my gay mom and consumer on crypto, like if she had to use EVM, she'd be like, the house fees are like $50 and she's trying to put dollar ten to her mom friend. It's me. Very difficult. Look at descriptions. Every EVM chain basically went down. The ones that didn't with the fees went to like 500, $600. So if retail is everyone to come in and actually use on chain, actually use IBC, it's not going to be the EVM, it's going to be Slana vM.
00:34:29.502 - 00:34:51.345, Speaker F: The move VM Alt vms at parallel execution. So that if you have one major effect, like you have cryptokitties or you have like one game going crazy, one thread isn't affect uniswap in one thread. It doesn't affect circle another thread. You can have multiple use cases within one vms instead of having like l five s and l six. The scaling happens at the VM level itself. So you don't need to do fractal scaling. You pretty much stop at L2 because the alt VM is good enough.
00:34:51.345 - 00:35:19.002, Speaker F: On Ethereum, that's the first midpoint. And the second thing is on security. That's where we're mainly focused on. Every year there's four and a half billion dollars loss of smart contract hacks. Again, going back to my mom point, if she wants to put $1,000 on chain or $10,000 a chain, and she sees that there's a Kyber dictator, she probably won't put it on chain. But now, if we can stop those hacker attacks in a formal verification and stop 995% of attack vectors in real time, that's the book is because that's how we get retail in, because they feel safe. Bank of America is never going to use the EVM because it's going to get hacked.
00:35:19.002 - 00:35:21.442, Speaker F: They're going to use Alt vms. That's why Facebook was built.
00:35:21.546 - 00:35:23.922, Speaker A: So can you get your mom a bad kid now?
00:35:23.946 - 00:35:27.830, Speaker F: I will, but I don't think she knows how to like use it. She'll be like, what is this, JPeG?
00:35:28.730 - 00:35:58.052, Speaker E: What's kind of interesting is like, one thing I want to point out is alt VM is actually very relative. So if you ask the Ethereum people, I think Ruchi's building for a move is actually ulTVM. Best cosmos people. EVM is the alt VM. And so I do think there's going to be a lot of EVM Cosmos chains, which is a very alternative take to original cosmos and stuff like Vero chain is this. And there'll be a couple others as well. So I just wanted to point out that Alt VM is actually a very relative thing based on what actual ecosystem you're part of.
00:35:58.116 - 00:36:02.600, Speaker B: Yeah, the definition of alt depends who you ask. So, last question.
00:36:03.340 - 00:36:03.788, Speaker D: How do we.
00:36:03.804 - 00:36:50.038, Speaker B: Ethereum and Cosmos converge in a way that's positive? Positive sum for all of crypto. We have these sort of internal debates and alignment and sometimes even arguments about which change are relevant and which ecosystems are better suited to build decentralized applications. But at the end of the day, I think we want to tend towards a future where block space is abundant and fungible and decentralized applications that offer censorship resistance and that are permissionless are sort of the norm. And so. Yeah, what's the. Sorry, I'm sort of, like, wrapping my question in a statement, but, yeah, how do we end up in a sort of positive sum situation?
00:36:50.134 - 00:37:08.970, Speaker F: I think Ethereum needs IBC because in this world, we have hundreds of roll ups. You need better connectivity. Like Helena touched on, IBC is the only third party neutral, no bags lined, just open source framework, and it's a very secure communication method. So Ethereum is IPC and cosmos needs security. And that's kind of ethos thesis I'm showing you. Bags.
00:37:09.390 - 00:37:09.718, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:37:09.734 - 00:37:46.876, Speaker G: I think the true bear case for Cosmos would have been a single monolithic vm capable of a million gps. Right. Some things that we thought was possible, like in 2018 ZK rollups, perhaps being capable of doing this. I think right now, Ethereum itself is moving to the horizontal scalability thesis as well. And so right now, that's basically the best alignment we can get. And that's a kind of through the whole modular marketing meme that actually allows Cosmos to now get at the top again and actually first to showcase the kind of technical superiority that we have on the IBC front, on the consensus and perhaps settlement fronts as well. And, yeah, perhaps in the future, we won't indeed know which chain stuff has settled on what this block space is.
00:37:46.876 - 00:37:54.120, Speaker G: And instead, crypto is just a swarm of millions of validators settling all across it, connected with shared security in IBC.
00:37:56.700 - 00:37:57.140, Speaker B: Thank you.
