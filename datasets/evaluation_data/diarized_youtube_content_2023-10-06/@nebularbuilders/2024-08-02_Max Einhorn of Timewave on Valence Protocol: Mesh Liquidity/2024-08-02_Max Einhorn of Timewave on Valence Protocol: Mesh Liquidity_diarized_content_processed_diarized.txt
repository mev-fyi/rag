00:00:00.240 - 00:00:32.330, Speaker A: So for those that don't know me, my name is Max Einhorn. I am a co founder of Timewave. Timewave is the team behind the valence protocol. And today I'm going to be talking about what we believe is the winning strategy for the interchange. And it's called mesh liquidity. From the outset, I want to make it clear that this is my intention is for this not to be the normal talk you hear at a conference. This is not going to be something deeply academic or theoretical or futuristic.
00:00:32.330 - 00:01:21.514, Speaker A: This is a strategy that each and every person in this room at this conference can start engaging in today to start winning together. So before I get into the meat, why should you listen to me? Who am I? Who is this bad kid? So, if you've seen me on Twitter, you've probably seen that PFP at the top. I'm from California. I've been entrepreneurial for almost my entire life. Down here is a little screenshot of a business I started in high school that got some attention in our local newspaper. I went to Wharton, where I studied finance, and worked at Oliver Wyman, where I did management consulting, mostly for financial services companies. I worked for a bunch of banks that I can't talk about which ones, but a lot of that work was with the Federal Reserve.
00:01:21.514 - 00:01:59.496, Speaker A: So I've gotten a glimpse into how parts of the existing financial system works. And I have a desire to build a better one from a fresher start. And that's why we're building valence. It's via timewave, the Devco. So what are we talking about is how low liquidity is a problem. And I'm going to talk about the resources at our disposal to fix this problem. And one of the new sources of liquidity, hint, is protocols and protocol owned liquidity is a buzzword for a lot of people.
00:01:59.496 - 00:02:32.242, Speaker A: So I'm going to go step by step to make it very clear why Pol can be such a great thing, especially for us. And I'm going to talk about immediate actions that we can start taking to start engaging in this strategy. So it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone here, but there is not enough liquidity in cosmos. And you need more than liquidity to have a thriving ecosystem. You need the tech, you need the developers. Obviously you need memes. But liquidity is a really important part of it.
00:02:32.242 - 00:03:00.516, Speaker A: And without liquidity, you exacerbate a bunch of really bad problems. First of all, when you sell, transactions have really high price impact. So when you sell a token, the price goes way down. That's not great. When the values go way down, teams will struggle to pay developers. And if you can't pay developers, you don't have people building the features that users expect. And so you don't have the growth that you would want.
00:03:00.516 - 00:03:37.540, Speaker A: And without the growth, you have people fighting over limited resources, which leads to zero sum, maybe negative sum behavior and toxicity. It's just not great. So if we can fix the liquidity problem, we can take a really major step towards being in a healthy, thriving ecosystem together. Ok, what are the resources at our disposal to fix this liquidity problem? What are our core strengths? What are we best at as an ecosystem? We have best in class interoperability. IBC is fantastic. We have shared security. We beat Eigen layer to it.
00:03:37.540 - 00:04:16.206, Speaker A: The hub has shared security. How do we use that to our advantage? Cosmos also has on chain governance. So more and more chains are having this. How do we use that to our advantage? And we have some very sophisticated, very technically talented builders. How do we use these four core strengths to our advantage to increase liquidity? Well, I already gave you the hint before. We can use these core strengths to tap into a new source of liquidity, which is protocols themselves. And this is not a substitute for the usual sources of liquidity.
00:04:16.206 - 00:04:48.510, Speaker A: Still seek liquidity from individuals, market makers, venture capital funds everywhere else. But in addition to that, let's start sourcing liquidity from protocols. What's an example of this? There are many ways to structure liquidity deals between protocols. Here's one that's getting the most traction so far. This is an example of a bilateral pol deal between neutron and Apollo. Dao. Neutron put in half a million dollars worth of its native token.
00:04:48.510 - 00:05:24.328, Speaker A: Apollo put in half a million dollars of its native token. Together they created a million dollars worth of liquidity for the neutron Apollo pair on astroport and exchange. And then half the LP tokens went to neutron. Half the LP tokens went to Apollo. This is an extremely capital efficient way to bootstrap liquidity. Since these were the native tokens of each of these organizations, it cost them pretty much $0 to create a million dollars worth of liquidity. There is risk here.
00:05:24.328 - 00:06:06.408, Speaker A: There is risk of impermanent loss, and so it could cost either party some money to engage in this. There are various things you can do to mitigate impermanent loss. We'll talk about one of them in this presentation. But coming from a position where we don't have enough liquidity, we need to be very capital efficient with what we do have. And this is a very capital efficient way to use liquidity okay, so with that example in mind, how exactly does liquidity help us? I'm going to walk through three examples. The first one, by putting pol on a Dex. So traders don't want to trade if the price impact of their trade is going to be high.
00:06:06.408 - 00:06:23.730, Speaker A: Some traders love trading volatility. That's fine. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about people wanting to either get in or get out of an asset. And when they do so, that causing price impact. And just for example, here's an example order book. Here are people who want to sell.
00:06:23.730 - 00:06:53.370, Speaker A: And obviously, the higher the price you sell at, the more people want to sell. And here are people who want to buy. And the lower the price, the more people want to buy. If I want to buy a lot of tokens, I might have to keep on buying and buying through this order book. And the value of the asset might be 5% higher by the time I'm done buying. That means that I'm taking something on my ass, on my balance sheet, that, say, worth $100. And by the time I'm done buying, that asset's only worth 95.
00:06:53.370 - 00:07:24.172, Speaker A: So the value of the assets on my balance sheet has gone down. And worse yet, I might be just leaking this value to arbitragers. Maybe this truly is the value of the asset. And an arbitrager will come in here and in a moment, capture that dollar five, bring it back. You're leaking a lot of value. And so if we were to have protocol and liquidity here, increasing the pol on the Dex would reduce the price impact. The amount of liquidity would increase.
00:07:24.172 - 00:07:57.680, Speaker A: So therefore, the price impact would decrease. If the price impact decreases, that means more people can transact more assets at greater volumes. And by having more volume, you increase the fees. And by increasing the fees, if you recycle those fees to buy back your token, you increase the token price. This is how Pol adds direct value when directed on a DeX. There have been over 100 of these Pol deals struck. Most of them have been on dexs.
00:07:57.680 - 00:08:25.352, Speaker A: Actually, I think all of them, to my knowledge, have been on dexs. But Pol doesn't just apply to dexsitive. You could also deploy Pol to lending protocols. Why is this something important? Well, a potential borrower might have a variety of opportunities at their disposal. Maybe they have an opportunity to earn a 5% return somewhere doing something. If they can only borrow at 6%, they're not going to borrow. They're not going to do this.
00:08:25.352 - 00:08:54.932, Speaker A: But if they can borrow at 4% and then engage in an activity where they can make 5%, they're going to do that and capture the spread. So we want lower interest rates that we can increase the borrowing. And also, if interest rates are high, they might not be able to afford their payments. They might lose their principal. They could be liquidated. And so this down here is a chart that anyone who took a basic economics class will have seen. You have a demand line and a supply line.
00:08:54.932 - 00:09:34.690, Speaker A: And what some people might not be aware of is that interest rates function very similarly to prices. So if you have more of a, if you increase the quantity of a good available, the price of it goes down. People are aware of that. The same thing happens with lending. If there's more, if the quantity of money available for lending increases, the interest rate decreases. And so if we want to go step by step for how Pol adds value here, if you increase Pol in our lending protocol, so if you increase the capital available, it reduces the interest rate, it brings it down. And by reducing interest rate, you increase the borrowing.
00:09:34.690 - 00:10:16.900, Speaker A: And by increasing borrowing, you increase the fees generated. And again, if you recycle those fees, you increase your token price. So another very good reason to be deploying Pol in this situation to lending protocols. Third, this is even more advanced, but something that is going to become increasingly common. Charging interest for Pol is a brand new source of revenue for protocols. So of the over 100 pol deals I mentioned, every single one that I'm aware of has been given away for free. And that's fine as initial distribution to start getting used to it, it leaves value on the table.
00:10:16.900 - 00:11:12.470, Speaker A: And it also increases the risk of the deployment of Pol being unprofitable. Like I was mentioning, if the impermanent loss exceeds the fees generated, that is an unprofitable thing. But if you have interest being charged as well, then so long as interest rate is less than fees, sorry. So long as impermanent loss is less than fees, plus interest, you're profitable. And so usually, what would happen if one of these organizations has a higher liquid token than the other? The protocol with a high liquidity that lends the liquidity to the low liquidity chain, that low liquidity chain would then pay interest to the higher liquidity chain. And the mechanisms of action here are very simple. When you increase the pol, when you're lending it at interest, you increase the revenue you get because you're earning this interest, which then can be recycled to increase your token price.
00:11:12.470 - 00:11:47.704, Speaker A: So third way Pol really helps here. The title of this talk was mesh liquidity. But the only thing I've done so far is talk about these Pol deals. What is the relationship here? Mesh liquidity is a reference to a network of these protocol owned liquidity deals. So as protocols share liquidity with other protocols, this mesh network is going to naturally emerge. And you'll notice I do have Cosmos here. But what I think we're really selling ourselves short if we only limit ourselves to Cosmos SDK chains.
00:11:47.704 - 00:12:20.112, Speaker A: This is the technology a lot of us are working with. It's really good for interchain. And bitcoin is part of that, ethereum is a part of that, Solon is a part of that. And so right now, today, our technology works with any cosmos chain that has interchange accounts or polytone. But we are working on integrating eth next and then other blockchains. So I really encourage anyone listening to this talk to start thinking about the protocol and liquidity deals. You can do use this head start.
00:12:20.112 - 00:13:12.624, Speaker A: You have to do these deals now before we make these tools available for the broader interchange. So what's something you can do to start acting right now? Well, if negotiating a bilateral or multilateral deal is too daunting, you can start just in single player mode, just manage your own protocols. Treasury most protocol treasuries are predominantly their native token, 100% the native token in most cases, but most protocols have devs that have cost denominated in dollars or euros. And so what you can do is you can use the Valence rebalancer. This is a screenshot from valence zone. Right now you can input your desired portfolio here. We started with 100% neutron.
00:13:12.624 - 00:13:57.286, Speaker A: We wanted to rebalance into 10% neutron and 90% USDC gradually over time. And this is doing it very efficiently. Slowly, gradually, gently over time. If you would like to use rebalancers currently in a private beta, but get in touch with us and we'd be happy to explore getting your DAO or protocol onboarded. You could also act now by closing covenants. So the covenants are tools for these protocol owned liquidity deals. Whether they're unilateral, bilateral, multilateral, and the cosmos hub, neutron, various other chains, they're starting to reach governance fatigue of passing these one proposal at a time.
00:13:57.286 - 00:14:29.254, Speaker A: So what you can do is get ahead of the ball and create a liquidity council. Give them a budget, have that liquidity council negotiate on the protocol's behalf. Propose Pol deals within your community to other communities, and use valence to do these protocols without the need for multi sync. These can be done entirely trustlessly via smart contracts. Again, this is a screenshot from Valence zone our website. So it's also in closed private beta. But if you would like access to this, let us know.
00:14:29.254 - 00:14:50.678, Speaker A: It's a really great interface where you type in your organization, your counterparty's organization. It will auto populate it in pros. So you understand what the deal term is in lay terms. And then you can also check out the JSON to make the proposal that much easier. So seriously, guys, don't wait. Act now. Get in touch.
00:14:50.678 - 00:15:17.940, Speaker A: My name is Max Einhorn, co founder of Timewave, contributor to Valence Zone. This is my email. That's our website. And yeah, guys, let's win together. Yeah. Any questions? Not everyone at once. Yes.
00:15:18.880 - 00:15:47.830, Speaker B: Regarding the team that, do you have some feedback about the team that you talk about protocol on liquidity, especially about the risk in DeFi and what they think about it. What do they think about the risk regarding, for example, not only the security risk, but also the impermanent loss or something like what they think about it.
00:15:48.710 - 00:16:17.670, Speaker A: So the protocols that we've worked with, how do they think about the risk that they are taking on by engaging in these deals? So let's start with the first deal. So the cosmos hub, they passed a deal to bootstrap the atom, staked atom pool on ask report. So this is relatively low risk. The atom and staked atom. This should not have too much impermanent loss. So that was really smart of the hub to start with something that was relatively low risk. And they did three more of these deals.
00:16:17.670 - 00:16:43.486, Speaker A: One was on osmosis, another one was on astroport with STK atom. So starting there is a really, really good way to get your toes wet. But let's say you're a chain that doesn't have a liquid staking protocol, but you still want to engage in defi. This is something that neutron has done a bunch of. So neutron has done a deal with Stargaze. They are not stable to one another. One or both of these parties.
00:16:43.486 - 00:17:31.732, Speaker A: One of these parties is likely to incur impermanent loss relative to the other one. So how do they think about this? So when doing these deals, it's really good to start with protocols that are of strategic value. So there was a situation where Mars was choosing am I going to build on osmosis? Am I going to build on neutron? Usually the main incentive driver for that is who's going to give you more money? Who's going to give me the larger grants? Obviously, tech is important, vibes, all sorts of things, but these are financial protocols. Finance matters a lot. Protocol owned liquidity is a much more capital efficient incentive than grants. And so what neutron was able to do is say, hey, if you choose us we will give you protocol owned liquidity. We will help bootstrap your lending market.
00:17:31.732 - 00:18:21.870, Speaker A: And that was something that helped get them over the edge. So even if there is impermanent loss relative to the Mars neutron pair, it was still worth it for neutron because they're getting that project there. So there's some strategic concerns to factor in and then also this charging of interest is going to be really important. So let's say neutron, let's say there's a protocol that really wants to pair with neutron. They're a relatively new one, so they have less liquidity than neutron. Neutron might be really worried that pairing with this token is going to lead to a lot of impermanent losses is very risky and so neutron might only agree to that if that lower liquidity chain agrees to pay interest on it. Perhaps the liquidity that they contribute to the deal to match that token essentially acts as collateral in the event of impermanent loss.
00:18:21.870 - 00:19:10.580, Speaker A: So getting the capital structure of these deals is going to be really, really important. Last thing I'll say on this, this is such a good question, so a lot to talk about. Dan Robinson at Paradigm had a really great thing wherever in so many words he was saying that the one side of this Dex market needs to professionalize and it's looking like the LP's are really professionalizing, at least in ETH world. And so if the LP's are professionalizing as individuals, who's going to professionalize this for protocols? That's something that we're thinking a lot about at valence. How can we be the best possible friend for crypto native organizations when trying to LP and having interest and other mechanisms like that help make that happen. Yes.
00:19:12.720 - 00:19:27.552, Speaker C: Do you see these kind of agreements between different protocols be like a standardized thing or very customized per agreement? Because that has obvious implications for the UIHE.
00:19:27.646 - 00:20:18.772, Speaker A: Yes, another great question. So right now this is very white glove like two protocols. They need to work their way through this, figure it out. But this is going to get normalized, hence why we made a UI for this already this bilateral pol deal is becoming the standard structure and so that's one of the first use cases we're going to have for our UI. Where we think this is going is that just like Tradfi has institutional debt markets relative to a household and individual crypto native institutional debt is going to be a layer here. And so a prediction we have is that pretty much every single crypto native organization that has a token will be borrowing and or lending liquidity to other crypto native organizations. So bitcoin as a chain is never going to do this.
00:20:18.772 - 00:20:41.660, Speaker A: They're at 21 million. Ethereum as a chain is almost certainly never going to do this. But Cosmos hub definitely could start doing this. New incumbent chains facing. Sorry, new chains challenging the incumbents. They're going to need to be really capital efficient. They're going to need to find creative ways to challenge, and this is going to be a very common way to do that.
