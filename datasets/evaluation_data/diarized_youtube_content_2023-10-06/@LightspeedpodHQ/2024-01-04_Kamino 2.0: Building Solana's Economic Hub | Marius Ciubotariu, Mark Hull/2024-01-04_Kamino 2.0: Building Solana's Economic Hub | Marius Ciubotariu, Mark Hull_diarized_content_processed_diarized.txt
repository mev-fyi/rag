00:00:00.170 - 00:00:40.090, Speaker A: It's a very seductive decision to focus on building infra like a new L two, than to actually focus on product market fit for actual users. Then the devs, you can't really blame them because if VCs are willing to fund them, they can have guaranteed salary funding, and I'm just going to spend the next few years building that. And maybe when Vitalik writes another blog post and we grow, and maybe that's when we think about the next milestone. Whereas on Solana, you don't have the excuse, it just works. You don't have an excuse, you can scale, just build stuff. Let's just see what people want and let's grow from here. And that's why I think the next breakout apps definitely are going to be out of Solana.
00:00:44.990 - 00:00:54.800, Speaker B: What's up, everybody? Welcome to another episode of Lightspeed. Today we're joined by Marius and Mark, who are two defi builders in the Solana ecosystem working on the Hubble and Camino protocol. Guys, welcome to the show.
00:00:55.570 - 00:00:57.790, Speaker A: Hey guys, thanks very much.
00:00:57.860 - 00:01:10.020, Speaker B: Pumped to have you guys on. Last time we saw each other was at breakpoint, and it's been a couple of fun months since then. For this conversation, we want to talk about Camino and also hubble, and a good part to start would just be the origin. So maybe, Marius, would you start for us?
00:01:11.350 - 00:02:10.840, Speaker A: Yeah, basically in 2021, I was working at a thread side job writing C plus plus, and I really enjoyed the domain of my work, but I didn't really think there would be a lot of growth. And I saw that crypto was basically in the bull market at that time, so everyone was talking about it, and I was looking for jobs or things to do in crypto. And I found out about Solana was this new chain that was written in rust, and basically rust was this thing that I was writing on the side. I was really passionate about it. And I saw there was a hackathon, and some guy on Twitter said that, check out this hackathon, it might change your life. So I checked out hackathon, I joined the team, and I started writing some code and I just loved it. And basically, I didn't have any opinions about crypto before, about what chain is best.
00:02:10.840 - 00:03:09.986, Speaker A: I didn't know anything about EVM or I didn't know much about these things. So I just took everything from zero and I just really liked it. And when I compared EVM and Solana from talking to some people, I had like, an open mind. I didn't have any bias or bug was just, it was obvious to me as an engineer that was working on distributed systems, that this is just a much better design. So then I thought, what's the thesis of Solana going forward? If we look at the current state of the Defi market in EVM? Because that was the only really NBN smart chain and it just made sense that a lot of stuff will happen and it will be a growth market. And I wanted to be part of that. And I was thinking, what would you need for any ecosystem to grow and for it to grow to begin with, you need the primitives and you need the Dex, you need the lending market and you also need a stable coin.
00:03:09.986 - 00:03:47.202, Speaker A: And there wasn't that many stable coins at the time in Solana. So basically that's why I said, I'm going to start a new project and make a stable coin out of it. And that was basically the beginning. Talked to quite a few people who, some of them were interested in funding me, started hubble, and basically we just built from there. There was a lot of grinding and product market fit iteration to get to realize what is really the point of a decentralized stablecoin and how should it be designed, et cetera. But that's kind of the original story.
00:03:47.336 - 00:04:00.700, Speaker B: Two questions. One, if you're coming from the Ethereum land, is it fair to compare it in some ways to how maker works? Makerdao? And then also when you started hubble, what was the status of USDC and centralized stablecoins on Solana? Was that a big market yet?
00:04:02.510 - 00:04:51.820, Speaker A: Yeah, it's fair to compare it with Maker at the moment. It started as a fork of liquidity, which didn't have a few features. We then pivoted away from liquidity into maker and probably we're going to pivot again. So that's kind of the similarity between them. In terms of what was the adoption of stablecoins in Sonata time, USDC was the king, basically the fact that now I realize when I was the first breakpoint that Tolle was talking about how they managed to get native USDC on chain, and I didn't really know why it was such a big deal and I do understand it now. USDC was the biggest one, but Solana was relatively small chain. Like the total TVL at that time was 300 million.
00:04:51.820 - 00:05:15.780, Speaker A: And we had like Saber and Solen wasn't even live at that time. It was just a very nascent ecosystem, so you didn't know how things would go. The growth of an ecosystem is going to be in some cases they're obvious what primitives will be, but in some cases, very path dependent. So you don't know which way it would go.
00:05:17.110 - 00:05:20.340, Speaker B: That makes sense. And, Mark, you were there during this time, is that right?
00:05:20.790 - 00:05:55.390, Speaker C: Yes and no. So I was there when Mario started building Hubble. Actually, I was a Solana fanboy. And I guess if I chart a little bit like my journey through life, I've been this non coding finance nerd. So always at the intersection of tech and finance. And I worked. I'm british, live in Switzerland, been working for swiss banks and regulated finance in different kind of roles.
00:05:55.390 - 00:07:20.710, Speaker C: Found crypto just through originally, like trial and error and being interested in tech and markets. And then after meandering my way through ETH and BNB and missing out on Defi summer, I got to know Solana and fell in love. I just became really passionate as a user and experimenting with DFI, and I independently came out to breakpoint in 2021, just to kind of check it out and thinking about potentially doing something in the future with Salana and that raging bull market that cemented my interest in Solana. And around that time, someone like a mutual friend introduced me to Maris and Thomas, who were about to launch Hubble and had been building it. And yeah, I kind of took the plunge to join the team. And yeah, I haven't looked back since then, so I also feel, yeah, I don't know. I mean, does 2021, does that make you a salana og? I'm not sure, but that was like my entry to solid.
00:07:20.710 - 00:07:33.006, Speaker C: Started buying the token. Thought I was a genius when it three x in a few weeks. And yeah, it's been the emotional ride since then.
00:07:33.188 - 00:08:11.500, Speaker D: So that's good background on Hubble. A lot of people watching this will be degenerates and they will be very interested in Camino specifically. To nobody's surprise, I do want to talk about maybe a bit about the origin of Camino specifically. So, Mario, you talked about needing primitives for the defi ecosystem, right? And so obviously stablecoin, but then borrow land, obviously a big part of that as well. So can you just maybe walk us through the story of how community came to be? But also, at the time, I think there was probably multiple borrowand solutions, and so you must have thought that there was still something missing. So what was the thought process there?
00:08:13.150 - 00:08:50.146, Speaker A: It was literally product by product by product, one needing one, giving the idea for the next. So USDH could not have scaled without integrations. If nobody accepts USDH anywhere, then there's no point for the coin. It's just like some random minted coin. So a stable coin is literally its demand. If there's no demand, there's no stable coin. So we built Camino as the way to give utility to USDH.
00:08:50.146 - 00:09:39.880, Speaker A: The first thing that Camino did was to create a stable pool on top of orca that would optimize for trading fees to give yield to USDH liquidity providers. So that was the very first thing that we did for USDH. It definitely improved a lot before that. If you wanted to provide liquidity for USDH, let's say a 1 million pool of USDH USDC would service five times less swaps, because a swap using an old style pool would take more fees for the same TVL. It's just like worsely designed. And then we thought, once we did it for USTH, we did it for other stablecoins that were in Sana at the time. So UXt, there was ush, there were several others.
00:09:39.880 - 00:10:27.042, Speaker A: And then the product kept growing, and then it turned into this vault product, where basically you just had this optimized liquidity for stable coins, and also for liquid staking tokens, liquid stake, Sol. There's a really nice vault right now, which basically, if you put Sol and Jittersol, it tracks the stake rate of Sol, and it's optimized for fees. And then the next thing we wanted to do was, okay, we have this capital efficiency, and it earns yield. So let's just allow it to be leveraged up. So, for you to leverage up these vaults, which are tokenized, you had to build a lending market. And we didn't trust anyone else to build a lending market that would take these things as collateral, approach it in a risk aware way. So we had to build it ourselves.
00:10:27.042 - 00:10:32.280, Speaker A: So that's kind of the journey of Camino land.
00:10:32.730 - 00:11:14.610, Speaker D: So you weren't satisfied with the risk appetite of the ecosystem at that time. So I do want to talk about the margin sole and debate that we had two weeks ago. And maybe a good way to segue into that would be to just approach or understand Camino and your specific approach to risk management, how you think about then. So that's more general. And then specifically, what you would have done differently, or what you thought about the sole end margin kind of debate about pegging or using the sole assets for the liquid staking token.
00:11:16.230 - 00:11:56.414, Speaker A: Yeah, to take these sort of things, K tokens as collateral, it's not something that you do it lightly. Right. I can't really blame anyone for not doing it. It involves quite a few layers of risk, because the K token itself is the result of a smart contract, and that smart contract itself has risks. So you're just layering risk on top of risk, and it makes sense for someone else, someone that doesn't want to take that extra risk on their borrow land market, to not do it. So I'm not blaming anyone for undoing it. Soland actually tried to do and allow some of our tokens there, but they put it in an isolated market, which basically had no capital, efficiency, or not much appeal.
00:11:56.414 - 00:12:37.290, Speaker A: So it was pretty much dead on arrival there. So that's kind of the reason. And when we decided, we're going to build it ourselves, there was this USDH incident on Soland where one of the Oracles was manipulated. It was a very weak oracle, and it just caused quite a bit of stress in general on risk management. And we really thought we could do this better. I myself spent about eight years in my previous job doing things related to risk. I was working on exotic derivatives pricing.
00:12:37.290 - 00:13:11.990, Speaker A: I was doing all sorts of things with highly complex exotic derivatives in tradfi. So I knew all about these risk management models, the simulations that you have to do, how you think about how banks think about it, how funds think about it. So it just seemed that the risk in DeFi was quite early stage, basically, and we just decided, we can do this better. We have the experience and we also have the engineering capacity to build these primitives.
00:13:13.610 - 00:13:52.470, Speaker C: Sorry. I would also just say where we were a year ago, we'd just gone through this insane year of black swans. FtX had blown up, Alameda had blown up. The Solana Defi landscape was kind of wrecked. Liquidity leaving Solen closed down. They were closed for multiple months. And yet at the same time, as well as questioning our sort of sanity, we were also passionate about taking Camino to the next level.
00:13:52.470 - 00:15:13.982, Speaker C: So we'd done something with these trading vaults. We knew we wanted to have leverage strategies that needed this credit market. And we had the experience both from kind of like tradfi experience across multiple areas, including quantum finance, risk management, as well as the development. And, yeah, it just really made sense to double down on building out something even cooler for Solana Defi, assuming that Solana Defi was still a thing, because that was actually before we kind of dive into actually just what we did with Camino, there was a lot of soul searching on where are we as well? Are we in the right place? Is there going to be on chain activity? Is Solana Defi a thing? Are we throwing our money away by continuing to invest in Solana, looking around at trying to find some the gold at the end of the rainbow, right? Which chain has users, has stability, has the speed and cost trade offs as well. And yeah, we always landed back with Solana to build on.
00:15:14.036 - 00:15:55.130, Speaker B: One interesting thing I would add to that if you've listened to our margin Phi Solen episode is just talking about how they think about risk management in the sense that Solan's been in the ecosystem longer and they've gone through a lot of these ups and downs that you were talking about, Mark, and talking about these Oracle failures and also network failures. And because of that, it's almost like there's been some scar tissue built up in how they approach risk management. And that's one reason why they chose the Oracle price. Look at Sol and not the stake soul, for example, and then margin Phi is a bit newer and at times it reminds me of like a 20 year old doing a startup. And you have all these ambitions and you don't have this scar tissue built up from maybe some failures in the past, and in some ways you can actually have innovation through that because you don't know, right. You're like pushing it to the limit.
00:15:55.210 - 00:16:24.440, Speaker A: To add to what you said. I definitely agree with you. I think you can't dismiss what Solen has gone through. They have a lot of experience that it's super valid. You really can't fake that. They said things like, we've seen the Oracle fail, we've seen the confidence check fail, we've seen all of these things are things that you only see when they happen to you. You can't conceptualize them.
00:16:24.440 - 00:17:00.260, Speaker A: It's extremely hard to start imagining situations and preventing them. You can do everything you can, but at the end of the day, the market will do things and you will not expect them. And what Solent went through is basically invaluable. I think it would be very infantile to ignore all of that. So to basically, I'm on the same page with Rutter. We have the same mechanism for pricing six Sol derivatives. I think that that's the right way to do it.
00:17:00.260 - 00:17:47.810, Speaker A: I think MSoL, if you consider the trade offs of choosing one price or the other, I do think that there's a lower chance of pool drainage of these staked SoL derivatives than of price manipulation or oracle fader. And actually last week we saw that there was an issue with BSOL, which is exactly what you would expect. There was probably some stuff with Jupyter where some prices were not being fed. Then those people that were not calculating the price correctly, they were feeding it into peace, which was taking it into account, which was giving you wrong prices. It literally came to within one week of your podcast. So we were pricing it using the stake rate. So we take the stake rate of Sol to jittersol, or stake rate Sol to mSol and multiply it by the price of Sol.
00:17:47.810 - 00:18:22.446, Speaker A: And we think that's the most resilient way to do it. Take into account all the other trade offs and the MSOL situation. I wrote a thread about it, but basically, there's very thin liquidity. It's super easy to manipulate, even if you don't want to manipulate it. But some whale testing liquidity is just going to nuke the price, and there's nothing you can do about it, no matter how much you talk about that. That's the true price. At the end of the day, you have to manage risk and debt backing that collateral, and you have to choose how to do it.
00:18:22.446 - 00:18:27.710, Speaker A: And I think that it's more likely to happen than the pool being hacked.
00:18:28.850 - 00:19:22.426, Speaker C: Yeah, but there's always the objective and the subjective. With risk management, there's many knowns, and we've got this risk dashboard, and we try to do as much as possible to analyze and take rational, objective decisions, but ultimately, it comes down to subjective decision making. And even we saw this on the discussions as well, which you referred to with Edgar and Ruta, both. You can listen to that and see the validity in each perspective. And that's what makes this stuff difficult. That tradeoff's been played out in multiple other assets. Even if we go back to the days of solid bitcoin on Solana.
00:19:22.426 - 00:20:23.266, Speaker C: Right. You can say, okay, well, for my protocol, I'm going to use this kind of global bitcoin oracle, to price bitcoin. And then we saw this situation where bitcoin on Solana just became worthless. Right? So using the real true on chain price of bitcoin on Solana was eventually the way to go for what played out in that specific situation, which is, of course, quite nuanced, different from, like, MSOL, of course, because of the counter party risk. But, yeah, these are all decisions that have to be made, right, on chain liquidity on Solana can be manipulated more easily than the global price of bitcoin. Right. But then unknown situations or unforeseen situations can definitely play out.
00:20:23.448 - 00:20:35.560, Speaker D: Marish, what are some explicit, concrete things that you guys do differently than other protocols and managing risk? What are some things that you think the users listening to this should know about?
00:20:37.450 - 00:21:07.918, Speaker A: The basics, of course, you have to do. Your smart contracts have to be absolutely immaculate. If you have a bug somewhere, like we saw this morning with radiant, then you'll be manipulated and there is nothing you can do. That's part one. And we have basically hired one company that did an audit and then another company that basically did like bug bounty. So they get paid per bug. So they are basically incentivized to find bugs.
00:21:07.918 - 00:21:43.966, Speaker A: And basically, while we were developing, they've been very helpful to us. And we have another bug bounty ongoing from the same guys, a new researcher. So we're just constantly stressed about this. It's like table stakes, but not everyone does it maybe just as seriously. And then the other part is basically, okay, let's say the protocol works as you described. So, as a lending market, you have two jobs, right? You have borrowers and lenders. Lenders give you some tokens and you give it to the borrowers, and you want to make sure that the lenders get their money back always.
00:21:43.966 - 00:22:50.990, Speaker A: So when the borrower wants to borrow something, he has to put some collateral on the side. And if he doesn't come back or if the market threatens that his position is not worth as much, you want to liquidate it as soon as possible. So you basically have to manage the borrowers, essentially. And you manage it by thinking, what risk are they allowed to take? And when do you stop? When do you allow them to borrow more soul than in another protocol, for example? And there are basically two ways to look at that. One is daily caps and global caps. How much sold should be borrowable or depositable in your protocol? And that amount basically has to be enough such that if you have to liquidate it tomorrow, based on a probability of a market crash tomorrow of 20% or 30%, you'll be able to sell all of that to get back the borrowed amounts to give it to the lenders. So that's kind of the only way you have to think about it, is the collateral that is backing the debt.
00:22:50.990 - 00:24:00.106, Speaker A: Can it be liquidated fast enough? Is there enough liquidity on the market to be liquidated fast enough such that you can repay the lenders? And you basically have to look at, we have, like, a dashboard that continuously monitors the liquidity on the market. How much sleepage do you get if you sell Sol, what is the volume of Sol, et cetera, for 1 million, 2 million, 3 million, $10 million. For that, we basically use an API backed by Fibonacci. Shout out to Shimon and Sam for uprising. That API. We have a few models that basically calculate the impact of price changes. So let's say if the price of sold drops by 10% tomorrow, how much is liquidatable? If it drops by 20% tomorrow, how much of the market is liquidatable? And based on the amount of that is liquidatable, let's say $10 million, can I sell all of that on the market right now, based on the current liquidity? And how much slippage do I get? And is that slippage enough to cover the debt that has to be repaid? So that's how we look at it.
00:24:00.106 - 00:24:35.522, Speaker A: We have a public dashboard risk coming out finance, and it literally tracks all of that. That's basically the very short, long version of things. I think one thing that people get wrong, usually, is that they think that they can monitor risk and they put caps and the job is done. But the problem is that the market changes without you knowing. So liquidity changes. There's a drop of 20% in one day. Liquidity vanishes, and you have to be able to react to market changes.
00:24:35.522 - 00:25:23.460, Speaker A: And if you have too much collateral in the system at one go, there is really not much that a lot of DeFi protocols can do. And the one thing that we did that we haven't seen in Solana is automatic deleverage. So we have a process where basically, if we consider. If the risk council consider that there is way too much collateral in the system, we can trigger a process where basically a margin call period is given to some depositors, or actually to the entire pool, and if they don't unwind their positions, then they will slowly be unwound in an auction system with the minimum liquidation penalty, and then more and more until they all unwind. So you have to basically have a way to monitor risk. If it's too much, unwind it. If it's too little, allow it to grow back again.
00:25:23.910 - 00:27:21.574, Speaker C: Just to add to that kind of comprehensive overview, is just this sort of ethos of introducing this primitive, but also in this spirit, which we've tried to kind of live in Camino of transparency, which started out on the market making side, so investing heavily in analytics, so that performance, which is often a black box in deFi, right, especially when APYs are thrown out all over the place, but that we could look at performance in multiple dimensions, so, like profitability. But then, as we've built out Camino lend, that also moves into risk management and transparency around exactly what we're looking at and how we're thinking about risk. Sharing our risk engine dashboard publicly, day one. Sharing the code, day one, of course, with it being open source, but living out this DeFi should really be not just about the smart contract transparency, but just the whole methodology and process transparency, because I think our background is broadly as a team come from the traditional finance world as well as some tech industries. So whether it's like developing in Bloomberg, which Marius was, or myself, in tech product management, in trading and payment operations systems, everything's about a dashboard and about the models behind it, what's going on always and then same on the quant finance side from our quant, but like living that really in what Camino puts out there for users as well.
00:27:21.692 - 00:28:03.810, Speaker B: Yeah, those are really great answers. One more question on risk management, and then we'll get to the future of Camino and what to get excited about. One thing that popped in my head as you're talking about all this is right now, Camino doesn't have a token. One thing that often comes with tokens is governance. And with governance, you might have a slower reaction time to what's going on in the markets because you're really well known for your risk management engines doing this analysis both on chain and off chain. But how do you guys balance or think about these concept of lending protocols like Camino, once a token is introduced, that might have something like governance mechanisms. And I also think of Jito, because in Solana, you're seeing all these token launches, and Jito is coming out with Stakenet, which is like this way to monitor statistics on chain and have everything be on chain through a smart contract.
00:28:03.810 - 00:28:19.610, Speaker B: But that's very backward looking. And it feels like with you guys and Camino and just lending, you do want backward looking data, but also the markets move so fast, you can't only look at that. You have to look at what's happening right now. So how do you guys think about that balance between having this quick reaction time and also moving towards something like on chain governance?
00:28:20.210 - 00:29:06.140, Speaker A: Well, I mean, ideally, you don't want to do any governance if you don't have to. So I'm concentrating about market triggers that could eliminate a governance decision. So, for example, let's say I want to unwind a specific amount of collateral. Let's say there's way too much Sol onto the market. How do I gather that? How do I think about it myself? And how can I automate my thinking on the smart contract level? So you can do quite a bit of things with that. You can build all sorts of oracles that allow you to do that. And I think the point is that you don't want to be in the situation where you have to react fast.
00:29:06.140 - 00:29:55.174, Speaker A: I think that's very difficult. That's a dangerous situation to be in. That's why you want to be proactive, kind of expect the worst already ahead of times. But yeah, I mean, that's not an answer. The answer is that when you have to do it, what do you balance out more? Do you care more about who do you value the most, the token holders or the lenders in the protocol? And I think the lenders are the most important people in the protocol, so you have to find a way to keep them safe. I don't really have an answer to you. I think governance is something we're thinking about, but decentralized governance is something that is not extremely well proven.
00:29:55.174 - 00:30:47.526, Speaker A: And I don't think it's well proven in something that requires so much deep knowledge as risk management on some financial market. I don't think you can approach this with a startup mindset or like we're just going to reinvent risk management, or we're going to reinvent decentralized governments, or these things have been going on for just tens or, I don't know, maybe hundreds of years. How you manage risk on a lending book, risk or anything. This is not something new. And the methods are known and every time there's a market flash or there is like some crazy volatility event, a percentage of the existing market there, they get flushed. So that's just like kind of like a law of the jungle. So you have to approach all of that with all of this knowledge, with all of this background and context before you start reinventing the wheel.
00:30:47.526 - 00:31:01.134, Speaker A: My opinion. So when you take risk, you have to err on the side of caution and be as safe as possible. Yeah, that's kind of my thinking about it.
00:31:01.332 - 00:31:46.366, Speaker C: I agree. I would add a couple of anecdotes there. We've got this concept of the risk council, right, which is currently made up of some of the Camino team, right. Conceptually, we'd love that to be a community kind of body, right. And especially the token comes into it and it all turns into the decentralization, the voting and so on. Like Marius highlighted some issues there. We've definitely seen examples of this lack of agility of decentralized governance, and then also a lot of what we're fending off on a daily basis is from the community.
00:31:46.366 - 00:32:22.506, Speaker C: It's very hard to bootstrap that. Right body of experience. Right. The community and quite rightly are very much like raise the caps and give us more leverage, power and everything. You can understand these requests, right. So we have to balance all of the different stakeholders when it comes to governance. And yeah, it's not something that is super easy to think of.
00:32:22.506 - 00:32:26.780, Speaker C: A dream scenario of it working on day one.
00:32:27.710 - 00:32:56.440, Speaker D: I think we should talk a bit more about, first of all, two things. One is, so there's Camino 2.0, which you guys did a big push on. So I want to make sure the users understand what's different about communal 2.0 because I took a look and I like it a lot, and I know you guys have some ideas for it and to keep evolving it. So number one, yeah, I'd like to hear about that. And then number two is going to be the question of the day that everybody's going to listen for, which is what is up with the points?
00:32:56.810 - 00:32:57.222, Speaker C: Right.
00:32:57.276 - 00:33:00.438, Speaker D: Can you tease the audience with any points talk?
00:33:00.524 - 00:33:05.240, Speaker C: I thought it was going to be when token, that was going to be the question.
00:33:08.330 - 00:33:46.466, Speaker A: So communicate is basically a set of protocols that work together to give you basically defy things to do. Camino 1.0 was purely vault very few limited vaults. Camino 2.0 is a much larger set of vaults with more interesting strategies for all kinds of pools. Combined with the lending market, which can work by, can work with it by itself, which is just to borrow and lend, but also can work with the vaults to leverage up the vaults. The point of Camino 2.0
00:33:46.466 - 00:34:35.970, Speaker A: is to kind of grow into, I don't like the term, but let's say into a super up. And the thesis is that there is going to be economic activity, and there is economic activity on chain. The most primitive version of that is the token. And basically people want to hold tokens, trade tokens, swap them, long, short, do all sorts of things with tokens, launch them, and that's kind of like as soon as you trade them, it becomes an economy. As soon as you want to borrow something to leverage something more up, then it's just economic activity or financial activity. And Camino basically wants to service that. Whatever the economic activity that will be on chain, Camino will be there to try to service and to help that sort of activity.
00:34:35.970 - 00:35:29.254, Speaker A: We don't have an opinion on the type of tokens or a thesis on what tokens will be the one that will be the best, or if it's RWA, or if it's shitcoins, or if it's like commodities or utility tokens, or governance tokens. It doesn't really matter. Commun is basically going to be there to service the on chain activity. And that can be trading volume that can be leveraged, can be long, short lending to other people, launching the tokens, whatever that will be. That's kind of the point of Camino. Even if Solana ends up being like the NFT chain or the social chain or whatever Solana ends up being, basically, there will always be tokens and economic value on the chain. And when there is economic value, there's the need for custody, there's the need for borrowing, there's the need for all sorts of things.
00:35:29.254 - 00:36:12.260, Speaker A: And basically, Camino should be there to service all of that. In more concrete terms, right now we have a lending market, we have a vault product. We're going to add a Meteora DLMM to the vaults protocol as well, and more integrations between the vault and the lending market. And then we have a lot on our plate at the moment, but then we will see what next comes. We have a lot of ideas, but we're managing quite a lot, so we want to make sure we do everything well and it's stable, et cetera. Maybe Mark can answer the question about the points.
00:36:12.710 - 00:36:26.038, Speaker E: Quick break to tell you about an upcoming event. I promise you don't want to miss. It's blockwork's biggest and best institutional conference, called Das London. It's a two day event happening in London this March, where we're going to have over 700 institutions, 130 speakers, and a couple of thousand of us all under one roof.
00:36:26.124 - 00:36:27.606, Speaker B: Crypto is in a position for the.
00:36:27.628 - 00:36:44.906, Speaker E: First time to actually onboard these institutions, and they're showing up. We have companies from Blackrock to visa launching real products in the space. We have the real world asset narrative taking off. We have things like payments that have been exponentially growing, and then we have things like deepen happening in the salana ecosystem. There's a ton of capital right now in this institutional space. It's going to be coming on chain. It's going to completely change the industry.
00:36:44.906 - 00:37:03.374, Speaker E: Whether you are an institution or you're a retail user, or you just want to learn more about what's going on in the space, this conference is for you. You're going to be able to meet some of the best and smartest people in the space. The speaker lineup is absolutely incredible, and you'll get to hang out with me. But the best part is you actually get 10% off your ticket if you use light speed. Ten, when checking out, I put a link in the show notes. I recommend buying this today because, one.
00:37:03.412 - 00:37:04.126, Speaker B: You'Ll forget about it.
00:37:04.148 - 00:37:09.800, Speaker E: Two, these ticket prices go up every single month. So, anyways, I hope to see you there. Now let's get back to the show.
00:37:11.850 - 00:37:27.100, Speaker B: One more thing before we get to the points that I'm curious on, when you say super app, and I know you mentioned this a little bit, what are you looking to build in house versus what are protocols in Solana that you're integrating with, and what are you already integrating with today? Like you mentioned Orca earlier, I think drift is there as well. Can you explain that a bit?
00:37:27.950 - 00:37:58.834, Speaker A: I want to answer this because I have very strong opinion here. If we're going to build a protocol, it's going to take you six months to a year to build it if you want to do it. Right. Because you'll have to think very hard about. You'll have to really understand it because there will be lines of code which, if you change, everything will change about it unless you do something very simple. Right. So building a protocol and taking it to market can take you up to a year of quite a few engineers and designers and auditors.
00:37:58.834 - 00:38:37.054, Speaker A: And it's extremely time consuming because you're not in the Web 2.0 world, where basically you just ship something, it breaks customer complaints, and you just go and fix it. You're more, in the sense, in a very adversarial environment where if someone discovers a vulnerability, he's already out through the door. Internet to cache by the time you realize it. So it's way more difficult to build something on chain. So we will not build something that someone else has built it, and we trust the do. Just to take the simplest example, we do trust orca.
00:38:37.054 - 00:39:07.180, Speaker A: I think they built a really good primitive, the clmm product. It's been extremely well battle tested. I don't see any reason why Camino would go and build a clmm. We can compose with them, we trust them, they're safe, they're battle tested. It's great. The more a protocol becomes battle tested, the more likely it is that we would rather integrate it than write it ourselves. That's kind of how I think about it.
00:39:07.180 - 00:39:19.710, Speaker A: That's like the baseline. It's extremely expensive to build something, and I might as well just compose with someone else and find some coordination with the other teams.
00:39:20.050 - 00:39:55.642, Speaker C: Yeah, I would add there, we're giving a complementary sort of a value add. Right. That was the initial thesis of Camino. It was take this great primitive, which is concentrated liquidity for token trading, but give something on top. So give these composable vaults, auto management, professional market making strategies, and yeah, we didn't have to reinvent the wheel. We didn't have to build our own clmm. We work with radium and Orca, who are great to kind of collaborate with and to build on.
00:39:55.642 - 00:40:54.730, Speaker C: And then we've got like the Camino touch on top. Camino lend. We did need to own the primitive, right? Because that's just to go over what we talked about already, the money market. And then the third pillar is like, say we've got the borrow lend primitive, we've got the market making primitive, like serving all of these tokens moving around. And then the third pillar is this automation layer. So, tying it all together into this super app, because then we've got products which are utilizing each and both of those primitives, right? So taking the concentrated liquidity positions and leveraging them up on the money. Yeah, and having this kind of great UX thesis analytics and the whole super app style.
00:40:55.230 - 00:41:17.000, Speaker B: Let's go into points next. Mark, I think one thing I'd like to add though, and it shows the power of Solana, is not only this composition or composability you're talking about now, but even just like the Jupyter plugin I think you guys have, right? Like if you come to Camino with Sol, I think you can quickly swap in and out automatically with one click to deposit to a vault, which is just a really cool situation you can do on Solana and nowhere else. But anyways, Mark. Yeah, let's talk about the points, because that's what everyone wants to hear.
00:41:17.370 - 00:42:49.730, Speaker C: Yeah. So we're about to kick off a points program, and I think the concept there was that we wanted, especially with launching a whole new piece of Camino with Camino lend, right, is how do we kind of incentivize users to do stuff on Camino lend, which is not just useful for them, but also useful for us as a protocol. And points can be a great way of achieving that, right? Because we have this kind of like gamification element, but can also somewhat guide user behavior in directions that is always useful for the user, but is also productive to us as a protocol. And yeah, in essence, points is about to drop. Everyone who's been using Camino so far is earning points, but what isn't yet there is this UI explaining what's going on, how to earn points, what earns more points, leaderboard, and so on and so on. And yeah, we've kind of know from day one we've said there's going to be a points program. It's coming, but it's soon.
00:42:49.730 - 00:43:16.730, Speaker C: But that soon is getting very close now. So it's about to drop. And yeah, ultimately, even though we've been talking about it, it's still not started. So there's going to be a bit of an evolution of points, but, yeah, in essence, it's going to allow users to earn points by doing different stuff on Camino, especially in Camino lend.
00:43:17.390 - 00:43:29.710, Speaker D: Nice, Marius. Do you have any other final things you want to get across about Camino and your philosophy on tokens and points before I completely shift the context?
00:43:31.970 - 00:44:11.520, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there's very few people that do points well, in my opinion, in crypto, and we've been thinking about it quite a lot. I think now that Juto has dropped, the expectations of users has completely changed. There's a lot more mercenary users out there. We've seen that if you do only one round of points, then the users leave. So it's almost like you tell them, okay, game over. You can go to the next play the next game, go farm points in the other place. This is definitely something we don't want to do.
00:44:11.520 - 00:44:38.614, Speaker A: There will be multiple rounds of points and airdrops. Oh, I said airdrop. Yeah. Basically, it's not going to be like a one off thing. And for sure, we've been thinking about it for a while, so we're going to give our own twist to it. And it's not something. It's not like, okay, let's just keep points and that's it.
00:44:38.614 - 00:44:40.680, Speaker A: We want to do it well.
00:44:41.530 - 00:45:28.360, Speaker D: All right. That'd be nice. Excited for it. Okay, so I will shift context. One thing that I think you do really well, and I would say you're probably one of my favorite accounts on Twitter to follow, is be vocal about your thoughts and what you think is right and what you think is wrong, which definitely needs to be done more on all sides, especially smart Defi people. What inspired you to do that, and what is your kind of philosophy on being an advocate and speaking out about the standards and ethics of the space?
00:45:30.010 - 00:46:14.690, Speaker A: Um, thank you for that, by the way. I think I follow you have your notifications. Okay, so basically, the idea is that we've been building for a while, and we've been building extremely seriously in the bear market. We didn't chill like Mark here. He knows we've been going very hard. Like, last year and this year, January, February, March, no matter the price. We were just building every day, and we were looking at the market a lot.
00:46:14.690 - 00:47:31.646, Speaker A: Like, what's happening with that protocol? Why is that not working? So there was such an excruciating experience that we basically had to unveil the truth in the sense, like, understand how this market really works. You come to crypto with this ideals, someone sells you a vision that this is about changing the world, and you put your own perspective on how you paint your own vision, but then you come in, the reality is different, or maybe it's slightly different. So if you don't want to go through the pain, and whenever these ideals get invalidated, it's painful and you have to accept them. And especially if you're building a protocol that on which its survival depends, your understanding of the market depends on influences the survival of a protocol. You have to be very honest with yourself and really understand it and not put your own opinion on how it should be, but rather what it really is. Right? So I think we were talking daily for hours, building for months in a row for like two years, two years and a half, and we had to understand how basically things go and work in Solana. So I think we learned a few things, we unveiled a few things.
00:47:31.646 - 00:48:22.486, Speaker A: And it really pisses me off when people just say stupid shit that they haven't really thought about too hard, or they just think it's just like this, just because they're vocal or because they have many influencers, they can get away with it. And I think it's basically unfair to a lot of people who are doing, like, honest work, et cetera. So I want to basically quickly bring up all of my knowledge and experience and understanding of things and speak out to whoever is listening so that at least they know they're not alone. For example, I think we think the same. I know there's a lot of people that think the same, but they don't say it. And it just has to be said. A lot of things have to be said so that if there's anyone to listen, they.
00:48:22.486 - 00:49:14.810, Speaker A: They will listen. So, for example, I disagree with a lot of things that are happening in crypto, with people coming, trying to reinvent the wheel, or ignoring past lessons, ignoring all sorts of realities, and it's absurd. And if you want this space to be mature, you have to bring quite a bit of maturity and experience in the space. That's kind of how I think about it, and I'm just going to speak it to whoever listens. And I know quite a few people that I respect. They listen to me, or, like, they follow my Twitter, and I want to share what I think with them. I don't want to share it with the guy that suggests for the next meme coin, but for some people, I want to participate in the conversation so that the space evolves and the right thing is done or I want to contribute.
00:49:14.810 - 00:49:34.370, Speaker A: That's kind of how I think about it and I think I have something to say and I don't come out of just purely like engagement farming. I actually think I don't do too much of that. So someone has to speak out so that there is some balance in the world, in the universe.
00:49:36.410 - 00:49:45.190, Speaker C: I think, Marius, you've started getting more people blocking you now, right? Which is probably the sign of your speaking out growing.
00:49:46.490 - 00:50:08.240, Speaker D: So I am curious on maybe some lessons you guys have learned since you've started your company and been through alliance as well. If you have any advice or lessons you've learned that you can impart for the aspiring startup founders or just current startup founders right now, listening to this that you'd like to share.
00:50:11.330 - 00:51:23.574, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know if anything, but basically this was like, especially for people who want to apply to alliance, if they want to go. For whoever doesn't know, alliance is like a crypto accelerator. You apply and then you get like a two months or three months program where you go through all sorts of discussions and teams and you have speakers from even like Solana speakers or like Tolly even, or people from every ecosystem come and they talk to you, and they talk to you about legal and token launches and ecosystems, and then they talk about startups and growing a team and interviewing basically everything. And you also end up with a forum that's private and founders talk quite a lot there and they share opinions and it's like really quality. The one thing that I found the most useful is basically having a mentor. So we have Xiao, who is kind of our mentor from alliance in the bear market. Maybe sometimes speak once a week or chat daily sometimes, and you felt like you're alone quite a lot and you don't know what to do.
00:51:23.574 - 00:52:18.086, Speaker A: Like, what's the next play? And they are there to remind you of some fundamentals that you haven't seen because you haven't seen companies struggle and then make it so they will tell you stuff. Like, you have to persist, you have to understand the market, you have to understand your users, you have to build something that people like, you have to follow feedback. You have to understand that crypto is cyclical. So there are all these things that you just have to hear them in the background as you're fighting with your daily fires and just having them as reassurances to know their fundamental truths that they apply. Even though today is a bad day or it's a good day, they're like guiding you and they're kind of like your sounding board. So I think the mentorship is huge, and especially it comes from someone that is experienced. And it's not just your team.
00:52:18.086 - 00:52:40.798, Speaker A: Your team is going to be biased. You're going to talk to your team and say, okay, we're going to do this now and they're going to be like, amazing. When you talk to someone that is experienced, they will reason through it with you, they will challenge you. They will say things that will be unpleasant to you. Xiao has told us quite a few times, you're doing too many things. Just stop that. Focus on that.
00:52:40.798 - 00:53:30.350, Speaker A: Look at this market. This is ready to go. This is not a good product. This is not a good idea. Don't do it. It's very useful to have someone that can tell you and, you know, they say it out of experience and not just like they want to please you or they just read it in a startup book. So I think finding a mentor is huge and I think it has to be a founder friendly mentor, not like, okay, there are people who are good Defi OGs who've been through multiple cycles and they understand the market, but they're not going to be a mentor to you that understands how product like the pains of a founder, for example, or the issue that you face when you struggle.
00:53:30.350 - 00:53:43.540, Speaker A: So if you have both in one single company or entity or accelerator, like a Defi Og and a startup founder OG, then that's a great combo and someone you want on your side.
00:53:44.470 - 00:54:01.706, Speaker B: I'm a fanboy of chow. He's awesome. We've had him on the show. He had a tweet the other day. He was actually responding to someone else that was saying how great crypto would be if there's no tribalism. And he responded with, that's really a naive take. And how important tribalism is to some extent in crypto and how consequential it is for a team to actually pick which chain they're going to build on.
00:54:01.706 - 00:54:06.410, Speaker B: And Marius, you then responded to that in agreement. So I'm curious if you can talk about that further.
00:54:08.670 - 00:54:51.980, Speaker A: Yeah, basically. And basically, this is the sort of thing that you get from talking to someone that is so experienced, because maybe this is the realization that you come to after six months of grinding. Let's say it just takes you a long time. You come with the wrong assumption, you think, okay, tribalism is valid and it's just like you make decisions or you have built on multiple chains, or you do all sorts of things and you end up, I wasted so many resources on this and I realized after six months or after a year and millions of dollars spent, that actually, that was a really bad decision. And this is a decision that you acquire over. There's just no shortcut to acquiring this wisdom. And that's when someone that is experienced can save you months of pain just by telling you these things and being able to articulate it in a way that you get it.
00:54:51.980 - 00:56:20.614, Speaker A: So, yeah, I think that's what you get in these experienced mentors. What I think about tribalism in crypto is that for a team, it's basically an existential risk if the chain or the infrastructure in which you build fails, because you spend just months and months building infrastructure and databases and indexers and libraries and domain knowledge, and sometimes you do it wrongly, and then you realize, I can do it better. And it just takes you months to iterate to understand how to build on top of the infrastructure, which is the chain, which is, in our case, Solana. If Solana fails, then you have to kind of wipe out so many months of just domain knowledge acquisition to go to a new chain. And that is extremely expensive, because developer time is expensive and your own emotional labor and energy is wearing out if you won't have to start again, and you throw into the bin all of this experience. So you have to root for the chain on which you build to make it, because you're so invested in it and it's just so expensive. So, for example, I don't really believe in multi chain, at least as a young team, as a small team, maybe if you're like massive, like uniswapper, they have like hundreds of BD people, then maybe that makes sense.
00:56:20.614 - 00:56:34.490, Speaker A: But as a young team, there's just no way you can deeply understand the ecosystem and the people and the history of the context and what people like in that chain just by writing code in a different language.
00:56:35.390 - 00:57:15.910, Speaker B: Mark, I'm curious if you have thoughts on this as well. One thing I've been shilling on Twitter and support of Solana is how the extension of the SVM is relatively bullish for all the teams and capital coming in the space. Because as, like a VC investor, you see a project, it looks great. The things you want to know, like, is the timing right? Is the Tam, the total addressable market big enough? And when you just had the SVM on Solana, yeah, it has a large upside, but it could be limited in some sense, whereas something like eclipse is extending the SVM further. I'm curious, do you see that as something that's very positive for Solan in the sense that if you're a developer in the space, it's like I can launch on this chain if I ever do want to go multi chain. Now, there are SVMs in other places, and also maybe there's a little less risk because you're not just dependent on one ecosystem.
00:57:16.330 - 00:58:03.426, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree. I think SVMs obviously much younger, and there's no need right now to be hunting for the next big SVM to deploy on as a team building on Solana. But I think that Tam story is very valid, and over time, it's going to play out some more. Right. We've seen Maker like Rune for Maker is one of the great examples of the last few months. Right. Talking about SVM, Eclipse have been one of the pioneers there, even with this whole injective SVM initiative.
00:58:03.426 - 00:59:07.514, Speaker C: So personally, I think that's only a good thing, that it's like entrenching the future success of SVM. But my feelings are same. It's not now this sudden imperative that we have to go and deploy everywhere and be, like the first to do XYZ. We've got time there, but, yeah, it's great. But I think what I would have reservations about, and Marius talking about the multi chain aspect is also an interesting point. Over the last year, I mentioned before, we did a lot of soul searching of where are we building? Is it the right place? How's Solana measure up to other ecosystems, other technologies? And we went to all kinds of different events. One of them was ethcc in Paris, which is really interesting experience.
00:59:07.514 - 01:00:13.326, Speaker C: But one of my main takeaways from there was actually seeing this big, like, such a big overriding theme from the teams there, and speaking to others was like, not just what are you building, but where are you building it and where are you deploying? And it was very much driven by incentives, driven by, and I think detracting from innovation. And for me, I wouldn't like to see SVM evolve into something like that. Right. Because then the ecosystem teams get distracted by this topic. The ECC takeaway, like I said, was, what chain are you deploying to, and what's in it for me? And these are all like, EVM chains. And is it optimistic, is it ZK? And you're losing that aspect of innovation. So that's kind of how I'm thinking about it.
01:00:13.326 - 01:00:21.540, Speaker C: I'm really happy that we've had this easy choice on where to build on SVM, and I think that's going to continue to be the case for a while.
01:00:22.950 - 01:01:12.450, Speaker A: Yeah, I think a lot of people. It's just so easy to think there's this new chain I'm going to go deploy in that new chain to try to land grab the same app, and it's just so easy. But it's not easy. It's a very seductive decision to make, to have to focus on building infra like a new l two, than to actually focus on product market fit for actual users. I think it's just so much harder to do that than to just go and say, oh, well, we're going to do that when it scales, but until then, we will focus on scaling. It's just dangerous. And that's why you don't see much iteration in terms of apps.
01:01:12.450 - 01:01:51.310, Speaker A: They're all trying to scale. And I think the devs, you can't really blame them, because if VCs are willing to fund them, they can have a guaranteed salary like funding. And I'm just going to spend the next few years building that and I'll talk to the users later. And maybe when Vitalik writes another blog post and we grow, and maybe that's when we think about the next milestone. Whereas on Solana you don't have the excuse, it just works. You can get people like, I was buying cappuccinos at breakpoint and I was bringing people in that I was meeting that were like non Solana people. I was like, can I buy a cappuccino? I was buying them.
01:01:51.310 - 01:02:04.782, Speaker A: It was instant. So I was like, that's it. You don't have an excuse. You can scale, just build stuff. Let's just see what people want and let's grow from here. And that's why I think the next breakout apps definitely are going to be out of Solana.
01:02:04.926 - 01:03:21.200, Speaker C: Yeah, we do need people pushing the envelope and pushing the boundaries with infrastructure, but especially as we're defi users. My main passion is, like, using Defi and building cool things in Defi, not necessarily building a new chain, but yeah, it's gone so far the other way that it's all more like, okay, who can be the first to fork compound on the new EVM chain, right? Or shall I choose compound or Aave? Or where does the next uniswap deployment get made? Right? And maybe, I don't know, in ten years or a few years time, it might be where does the Camino fork get deployed? Right, which new SVM? But I hope there's a bit more innovation than that going on. But yeah, the industry has been, there's been a lot of incentives rolled into that. Right? Like VCs, we talk about the tam, right? Is the tam bigger for an app or a chain? Clearly a chain.
