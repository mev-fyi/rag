00:00:00.330 - 00:00:24.122, Speaker A: You gotta work on brand sentiment right now. It's an absolute f. It's in the toilet. Right? And so things where you can bring in big enterprises or big companies and actually illustrate interesting things, even if it is faux web3, web 2.5 is good brand sentiment. Driving it is not going to be what makes like crypto in the future, is not going to be the breakout app and experience. It's not going to generate hundreds of millions of users for these protocols.
00:00:24.122 - 00:00:32.360, Speaker A: But it's going to help with sentiment. When you start to improve sentiment at a macro level and at a protocol level, developers become interested in the space.
00:00:38.330 - 00:00:45.606, Speaker B: Everybody, welcome to another episode of Lightspeed. Today we have Ryan Wyatt, who is the president and now advisor at Polygon Labs. Ryan, welcome to the show.
00:00:45.708 - 00:00:47.654, Speaker A: Thanks for having me. It's good to be here.
00:00:47.772 - 00:01:07.434, Speaker B: Yeah, we're pumped to have you here. Look, I love viewing people that worked on real products in web two are now in Web three. So you worked at YouTube for eight years with their head of gaming. You started at 27 years old, which is absolutely nuts to me. It's younger than I am today. And then you made the leap into Web Three and you joined Polygon. So I would just like a little bit of a history of what you did at YouTube, what got you there and then what made you take that jump.
00:01:07.434 - 00:01:18.326, Speaker B: Because at the time, crypto had a lot of hype. I think this was January 2022 and you made the jump. But also if you looked at crypto products then compared to what you're doing at YouTube, I'm sure it was a pretty pale comparison. I would love a little bit of background there.
00:01:18.428 - 00:01:51.534, Speaker A: Yeah, happy to. So when I was at college, Ohio State, I was always into esports, played video games, competitively counterstrike call of was working. I realized that I needed to figure out what I want to do. I was really passionate about gaming and particularly video content around it because Esports, I liked watching esports broadcasts. And this was very nascent. We're talking, I don't know, gosh 2008 seven, right? So a long time ago. And that kind of led me to MLG where I was already kind of playing and then wanted to figure out how I could work for them.
00:01:51.534 - 00:02:17.346, Speaker A: So I volunteered for MLG. And I did everything. I started commentating these events. I was like refereeing stations, I was helping set up tournaments. I was still in college, traveling around to these events. And it was really know fast forward that I really focused staying on that. Got a job at a company called Machinima, which was really trying to build out the first gaming video network on YouTube so that those that like video games you weren't watching on cable television anymore.
00:02:17.346 - 00:02:44.046, Speaker A: You were starting to know video content online. How could we really take that part over for gamers? Super fun. A lot of shenanigans working there. Learned a ton. It was my first job out of college, got to move out to La, had never been to La before, just make the move out there. And I was from Ohio, so it was easy to please from a weather standpoint, all these things being in my young 20s, being in California. Machinima gets an investment from Google Ventures at the time.
00:02:44.046 - 00:03:22.442, Speaker A: And so we start to establish a really close relationship with Google that led me to have some connections in there. And I used to write YouTube and Google basically these long winded notes of all of their shortcomings and how it negatively impacted us as a because we were all of our content was on YouTube. So we're like completely beholden to that as a product. So whether things got there wasn't monetization or the product features were behind or things that we wanted to do, I often discussed of the things that they were falling short of. And so when Susan Wajiski came in, google started in Susan's garage. So she was a powerhouse. She's already at Google.
00:03:22.442 - 00:03:43.380, Speaker A: She comes over as the CEO of YouTube. She's like, look, I've got kids. They love video games. We don't have anybody here that knows anything about video games. This crazy guy from Machinima keeps emailing us about all the things that we're not doing right. And so 1516 interviews later, I got brought in as the head of gaming at YouTube. I was 27 years old and I had to build out that team.
00:03:43.380 - 00:03:57.174, Speaker A: It was quite an experience and I always really appreciated them taking a chance on me so young. I felt the weight of that and wanted to make sure I came through for them for putting all that trust in me. So that's a quick story of my YouTube time.
00:03:57.292 - 00:04:14.094, Speaker B: Ryan, what did the landscape in gaming even look like then for YouTube? So I remember back in college, this was like 2014, I was sitting in class and these people in front of me watching other gamers play games. That blew my mind. I was like, why are you sitting there watching someone else playing a game? So was that hadn't caught on yet? Is that what was going on when you joined YouTube? What was the landscape like?
00:04:14.212 - 00:04:26.634, Speaker A: Yeah, it's great. So when I was at Machinimo, we were starting to do gaming. Gaming didn't really exist on the platform. We were starting off because there's a number of reasons why it didn't exist. One, YouTube. It's so early in YouTube's days, it's still known for like cat videos. Charlie bit my finger.
00:04:26.634 - 00:04:47.554, Speaker A: Yada yada. Right? So this idea you're going to put gaming videos up there is little unusual to begin with because of this concept. Who wants to watch people play video games? Then there were a number of things that started to happen. One, monetization. So Machinima as a network could start to put ads in front of video. So now there's a revenue stream in that you could reinvest. And so you get better content, you get more content, so forth.
00:04:47.554 - 00:05:07.098, Speaker A: Then there's like multiple factors that we had no control over that really helped as a catalyst for gaming content. This is like eight, nine dazzle capture card comes out, makes it really cheap. It's like $49. Anybody can buy it. You plug in your Xbox into it. Then you just start capturing content. Then PCs started to get cheaper.
00:05:07.098 - 00:05:32.434, Speaker A: Broadband Internet connectivity started to get better on your upload stream, which is what you're dependent on for streaming. People had like two PCs and shit to stream content. It was not realistic at all. Right? And so these hardware barriers started to break down and get really much more cost efficient, which then creators started to flood in. Then you started have this kind of thing. Well, now there's more views, which draws more 13 to 18 year old males into the audience. That is a hard audience to monetize.
00:05:32.434 - 00:06:30.774, Speaker A: So now it's like, how do we put ads on this content? Then you do mobile ads and then you do like mid rules and all these different things. And so when I came in as that of gaming was 2014, there was like, content there, right? But the problem was YouTube had always kind of swept it under the ground or under the rug because they're like, is this really what we want to be? Do we want to be a platform of cat videos and gaming videos? And so when you went into YouTube in eight and nine, there was all these categories on how they discovered content. But gaming was never one of like pets and animals, automobiles, whatever, right? But what gamers started to do be like, oh, this is a Warthog video in Halo, so it's automobiles, right? They started to really scheme the system and ultimately you were just kind of swimming upstream. And so they wanted to lean into gaming. But this concept that people want to watch people play video games was really foreign. And even me young, I hated watching my brother play. So I was empathetic to where people were coming from.
00:06:30.774 - 00:06:35.942, Speaker A: But I don't know, I was like, I'm into this shit. There's got to be at least some people that are like me that will want to watch it as well.
00:06:35.996 - 00:06:57.214, Speaker C: I didn't actually know you worked at Machina. That's awesome because I used to watch Machina videos when I was younger. I think maybe the reason was to get an edge over other people playing games. And it's kind of like sports where you watch other people who play sports so you can get better at sports. It's kind of the same with gaming at the time. Okay, so this is like 2013, I believe, right?
00:06:57.332 - 00:07:15.698, Speaker A: Yeah. So 2013, I leave Machinima to go back to major league gaming. It was the VP of Programming. I love that gig. It was fun to go back to MLG. Had a first fun run there when I was in college, getting to run all of our programming, doing the big esports events that we were putting on the live broadcast. But it was short lived.
00:07:15.698 - 00:08:00.182, Speaker A: I was only there eight months because I got recruited by Google. And that's a once in a lifetime opportunity. So as much as I loved MLG to this day and it holds a special place in my heart, I had to go do that. And so when I went into Know, I had a little bit of imposter syndrome, know, you sit in a room of the other leaders like Leor Cohn's ahead of Know, this guy Kanye West has dropped lyrics in his songs about Know, like, this is a big music mogul. Who is your peer for music? And I'm like the gaming Know that had been like, fucking around, doing gaming videos. The know, both like at night streaming and then working the nine to five in the space of Machinima or MLG. And so it was an advantage because I'm like, look, out of all you guys, I actually use the product.
00:08:00.182 - 00:08:32.078, Speaker A: I know it well. My best friends are creators. We're on this shit every single day. So nobody in this room knew YouTube better than me. But all of them were seasoned execs veterans, come from these very prestigious backgrounds. So for me, it took a little bit to learn from them and soften out some of my rough edges, learn how to be a leader, how to bring people along, how to think a little bit bigger strategically than just gaming. What can kind of gaming do for YouTube instead of what can YouTube do for gaming? Kind of concept like JFK, if you will.
00:08:32.078 - 00:08:40.420, Speaker A: And so it took a little bit for me to really learn that and ingrain that into me. But it was amazing. I mean, what an amazing experience and opportunity.
00:08:41.110 - 00:08:59.960, Speaker C: Would you say that the maybe public perception of gaming and maybe actually streaming for gamers was similar to the sentiment of how people look at crypto as kind of just being like, maybe a bit fringe, or do you think it was totally different just trying to understand what that was.
00:09:00.570 - 00:09:28.894, Speaker A: I think there's definitely a decent I mean, I've seen a lot of parallels and similarities in between the two. Certainly those that were on the outside all hated it. Like, my girlfriend at the time in college was practically a reason we broke up. Just like you're insane. Even my good friends, it was very hard for them to process. And I got that. I totally was empathetic because it's not like when I was first going into it, I so clearly saw that this was going to be YouTube's second biggest vertical.
00:09:28.894 - 00:10:06.030, Speaker A: It's going to be a multi billion dollar business. Like, the future stars a decade from now are going to be gaming streamers and gaming creators. You would have literally been insane to predict that. No one did, no one even remotely did. My thing was just kind of looking one step in front of me and seeing I just think other people are going to enjoy this and so why can't that just be enough, right? And why can't that be enough to kind of work on it and think of it? And so in that regard, I saw a lot of parallels of no one knows what it's going to look like in the future. Nobody has a crystal ball. It doesn't really matter what other people thought about what it can or can't be for that reason.
00:10:06.030 - 00:10:16.158, Speaker A: And if it was like something you enjoyed doing and just kind of like pushing the ball up the hill, that was enough for me. And so, yeah, those were super similar in that regard.
00:10:16.324 - 00:10:33.558, Speaker B: I think it's interesting looking at the catalysts of this too. Like the gaming industry, a lot of that's, like Xbox Live, when that took off, you started playing with your friends, you got community and then the iPhone allowed for people to look at videos on their phone and then with that you had social media. And Ryan, I'd like you to talk. How big of a deal was social content for gaming? And the growth of esports mobile in.
00:10:33.564 - 00:11:37.766, Speaker A: General was a huge moment for like for a lot of reasons, because when I was at machinema, all of the views were coming from desktop, right? And so I do think this thing of social sharing that you could just watch something on your phone instead of having to sit down on your computer, then open up this YouTube video and so forth, really was monumental. And so when we started seeing mobile pick up and that inflection point when mobile viewership passed desktop viewership, obviously that pushed mobile ads and stuff for us to focus on, that was a catalyst for a lot more viewership just because of the sharing. If nothing else, gaming had already been on that path where more and more people were gaming. There's still to this day a little bit of the stigma and taboo of gamers or just like these people that play these video games in basements. I think more and more people are becoming a little more aware of how gaming shows up in our lives in so many different ways and how it has evolved. Like when you're playing Doom or Quake, it was a little bit more of that hardcore in the basement culture. Games have now expanded to appeal so much more broadly on so many more devices.
00:11:37.766 - 00:11:44.618, Speaker A: And so I think that helped normalize more of a social norm, if you will, which helps obviously, with growth in users.
00:11:44.714 - 00:12:01.202, Speaker C: You're at YouTube, you're the head of gaming at YouTube, you're working with kind of these legends at Google, some of the earlier pioneers of industry, and then you make the decision to go to crypto. What happened there? What was the story know, we at.
00:12:01.256 - 00:12:34.990, Speaker A: When I was at YouTube, we were kind of looking at this really interesting idea. This is metaverse kind of buz and there was some inside of the buzzword. There was a little bit of an interesting subject that was happening that I was just interested in looking at. It was two things. One, it was just like seeing how much money people were spending on video games, like digital item ownership and how much was going into that, which as a hardcore gamer, I was just fascinated. I spend a lot of money on games, know, that's like a trend. And then two, YouTube gaming had benefited so much from obviously, you know, people play these games, they go watch the content, but there's only a finite amount of time that somebody has in their day.
00:12:34.990 - 00:13:30.894, Speaker A: And so there was this kind of interesting conundrum where, yes, minecraft roblox. These games made YouTube, but in a day where, you know, 6 hours to watch videos and play video games, if that gaming starts to become more appealing, it cannibalizes the viewership time. And so it's almost like, oh, it helped us get where we are, but now it's actually problematic. So just going down this rabbit hole of exploring, well, what does that mean next for YouTube? What does it mean for gaming in general? Let me down crypto and blockchain and digital asset ownership. My background not really watching crypto from the sidelines with maybe some level of intrigue, but no, I didn't read like the bitcoin white paper. I have this kind of like libertarianism thought and I'm going into it and it's going to change the world. But what I started to realize with digital ownership was, man, if we're going to keep spending money on this, this system that we have right now for it is not going to work.
00:13:30.894 - 00:14:05.020, Speaker A: Right? Because there's not enough autonomy fluidity on how we actually do these things. And so that kind of led me into the space invested in Immutable right then. Just thought I was going to just advise mert, honestly, I got a dream job over here. I'm not fucking with this crypto space. I'm going to stay over here and just advise. But the problem with that is that whole red pill concept is real. Once you actually start to see some of these things and believe in a future state of what it could look like, it's very hard to go back from that.
00:14:05.020 - 00:14:14.362, Speaker A: It's so dynamic, the space on a day to day basis. I felt like I just had to jump all in, burn the ships behind me and hope for the best.
00:14:14.496 - 00:14:36.274, Speaker B: Yeah, I got to double down on that because you jumped over. I'm sure a lot of your friends in the industry are like, what are you doing? You came over. It's probably pretty exciting, right? And crypto is exciting depending on the day, it moves very quickly. Have you had like an oh shit moment? Like, why am I here? What am I doing? Specifically, what is something you came to crypto and you saw it and you're like, what's going on?
00:14:36.472 - 00:15:36.438, Speaker A: I've had 100 oh, shit moments in the two years I've worked full time in this space. Right? Yeah, I think, look, one thing when I came from Google is what I knew, right, because I was there so long. So there was a type of person, a way of doing business, that Google has plenty of flaws, but they also have done what they've done, and there's some merit there. And so all of what you learn at Google, both how the business operates, right? Wall gardens, generate revenue, capture users. Some of it is just like completely contrarian on the Web Three Ethos side, right? And so you are, one, battling that, right? Like a lot of people that work in Web three, everything that Google does is what they think is what's wrong with the space. So there was way more of maybe not resentment there, but we're not trying to be that, we're trying to go against that. So that was like a big one of a little bit of a jump into the cold water.
00:15:36.438 - 00:16:11.682, Speaker A: I learned quite quickly and both internally and externally, some of it being very valuable, some of it maybe not. As far as merit or not. Two, tribalism I was actually all good with. I noticed how hardcore that was, but I actually kind of like that I saw with YouTube versus Twitch and stuff. I love that community rallies behind products and platforms, feels passionate about it, speaks their mind, has a bunch of candor. I don't like when employees or founders or execs participate in the tribalism at all. The space is very small, but I actually loved that and it was really cool to see how hardcore that was.
00:16:11.682 - 00:16:35.626, Speaker A: I learned a lot from it, actually. That's kind of I learned about mert and stuff, too. And then the thing that I think bothered me the most, which actually the only time I ever thought about leaving crypto and wanting to get out of it, was just the leaders when I came into the industry were horrific, quite frankly. And people love them. VCs love them. People I respect dearly love them. The community love them.
00:16:35.626 - 00:17:15.910, Speaker A: Like Doe Kwan and SBF and all these different people. And look, you don't have a crystal ball on some of these things that SBF may have done or whatever, but these people, in the way that they carried themselves on a day to day basis, from interviews to social media, was not reflective of what I thought the leadership within the industry really needed to be. That's not to say there isn't fantastic leaders in this know, but the ones that were particularly on a pedestal very uniquely, that was troubling. I think we as an industry have learned from that and we're moving away from that. But when I first joined, they were like religious figures when I first joined, which was really bizarre.
00:17:16.970 - 00:18:09.698, Speaker C: Yeah, certainly the industry has a problem with idolizing corrupt individuals or people who are maybe a bit more sketchier than we should probably be aiming for. So you are just going back to the story here. So you're interested in basically how much money people are spending on kind of these digital assets, the Metaverse stuff. You are an advisor in Immutable X, which for people who don't know is a roll up that's gaming focused. I believe Polygon might have joined forces with Immutable X recently but I don't think that was the case at the time. Okay, so how did you come to work or actually you were the CEO president of Polygon Studios. How did that came to be what's.
00:18:09.714 - 00:18:55.874, Speaker A: The story was going to I was going to kind of help Polygon from an advisory standpoint from a gaming perspective and just really started spending a lot of time with Sandeep and I was like, life's pretty short. In general. I've always felt that I do kind of the greatest work where I'm most passionate and feel like I can have highest impact. And it just really started occupying my mind of I'm going to miss out by not going down this avenue. And it felt very much like how I felt about YouTube and gaming video and all of these different things kind of like what we touched on. And so I just was like, I got to do it. And so we spent more time talking about, well, they had just raised their $450,000,000 sequoia led fund or investment rather they acquired three different ZK teams.
00:18:55.874 - 00:19:51.420, Speaker A: So it was this idea of like, okay, there's an opportunity for me to help this group, I can learn from this group, I can help, it's a great opportunity for me. And so I came in as Polygon Studios CEO. Studios was a division of, let's say the foundation if you will, of Polygon was a company that was going to focus on NFTs and gaming and Metaverse and all these different things. You then had kind of the three different ZK tech teams solely focused on infrastructure. Then you had Polygon Tech at the time which was kind of like a hodgepodge of the POS team, some BD teams, some marketing folks, right? Like that is kind of like I've always looked at the Legacy Polygon team, pre Studios and the ZK teams, right? So I come into that and I start building out the Studios team hiring who's now like our COO of Polygon Labs and building that team out, our BD team, all of that. And it was really fun. There was a ton of opportunity in the space.
00:19:51.420 - 00:20:11.070, Speaker A: People were calling left and right as far as opportunities to work in web3. It was very different times, right? And so that was what I was doing at Studios. And ultimately we decided that we need to roll all of these different groups up under one team, which we then did last summer under Polygon Labs.
00:20:12.130 - 00:20:22.434, Speaker B: Ryan, when you were hiring over that team, now that you've been in crypto for like two years or so, what have you learned from hiring crypto native people versus looking at talent from Web Two? Bring them to web3.
00:20:22.552 - 00:21:07.378, Speaker A: Oh, man, we could do a whole hour just on this. This is really interesting. And I actually leaned on some of my learning experience from my YouTube days because when I was at YouTube, I was like, we got to hire people from outside Google that actually understand gaming creators and video, but we can't just be that group of hardcore gamers coming into Google because they're just going to reject us entirely. The only way that the tissue will be accepted is if we bring some internal Googlers in as well who can kind of show us. So I did a mixed hybrid of building out the YouTube gaming team of externals and internals, and that worked out really well for everybody. There's a lot of similarities but differences as well. So try to do that same kind of model.
00:21:07.378 - 00:21:38.134, Speaker A: When I came over into Polygon, some worked out, some didn't. The things that didn't work out is like in the Web two side in that category, they really aren't bought in on. This is a finite amount of time to work for a protocol to launch a decentralized network. You are not going to work. This is not Google. We are not going to grow to some large 40,000 employee team. If you want to manage a team of 30 people one day, it's not going to be here, right? You have to understand the mission.
00:21:38.134 - 00:22:49.700, Speaker A: The mission is you're going to build this network out, you're going to push it out to sea and you're going to give it to the people and you're done then, right? And so that is a hard thing for a Web two person to wrap their head around because it's completely opposite of going to a startup company that you hope is going to be a rocket ship that's going to make your name and build your career up, because it's not it. It's not it. So with Web two folks that came in thinking that this was the next Microsoft, Google, Amazon, that it was going to build out to these large forces, there's a huge miss. And so I wish I would have when I would speak to people from Web Two be like, but do you actually understand what I'm saying when I say all this and why this is? And then on the Web Three side, if you're too stubborn, too naive, not willing to open up to different ways of doing it, of how you bring people along is built with a lot of compromise and listening and understanding and not being hard headed or stubborn or all these things. And so, look, I'm being very general in describing these two camps, but these were threads that were very common inside of them that you had to be very mindful about when hiring. And it was a huge learning experience for me.
00:22:50.630 - 00:24:08.890, Speaker C: Yeah, I think probably one of the biggest surprises is especially in foundation level roles, it's almost like working for a government or like a nonprofit where it's like you're kind of serving the citizens and the citizens kind of hate you and you're not really making money anyway. So talking about maybe the mix of this hybrid web two, web3 cultures, you are probably most well known, I would say, at least in my circles, as the prolific kind of BD guru like you're, very good at the brand partnerships, pushing kind of the top down approach of how web two businesses, enterprise sales, stuff like that happens. And as you mentioned before, that approach when you entered the space first, you were kind of surprised or maybe not surprised, but you saw that maybe some of the internal web3 people were maybe somewhat against that. Despite that, I would say that Polygon probably still has the biggest reputation for just being good at BD and landing these deals and kind of being on the table when people talk about enterprises and whatnot. How do you view this concept of BD in the context of crypto and web3? Maybe some lessons you've learned along the way as well.
00:24:09.040 - 00:24:57.078, Speaker A: Yeah, it's such a great topic. Also fascinating and unique in our space. A couple of things. I think from an outside perspective, there's two really important verticals that you have to focus on. There is web3 native developers, maybe a gross term or however you want to categorize it, but like true people that are going to build and understand intuitively what crypto is, what it can be, what blockchains are. And then you've got a group of people that are intrigued, they might varying degrees of understanding it maybe from nothing to a good amount like Starbucks good amount, maybe other ones like Coca Cola just wants to do like a cute NFT project and everything in between. And so you have to have two different groups set up to handle these two different groups.
00:24:57.078 - 00:25:43.010, Speaker A: When you go talk to X, Fortune 500 company, it's polished top to down. You need complete end to end polish because that's what they deal with when salesforce goes in or Starbucks, people roll out the red carpet, google any of them and what does that look like it's. I'm going to hold your hand through your entire experience here when it's negotiating the deal to tech questions that you have to how you onboard, to how you think about web3 native marketing, to how you go to market and anything in between. And then once you're on the platform, the protocol, we're going to make sure you're happy. This is very web two and this should only be for a finite amount of. Time in crypto. This is kind of the introduction screen of a video game.
00:25:43.010 - 00:26:22.102, Speaker A: I'm going to give you the tutorial run through. This is like blockchains and this is crypto and this is the same. And you need to do that, right? Because that's where we're at at this point in the industry. I don't know that this serves as a true future state of BD because when you think about protocols and you think about proposals being put forth and where tokens come from and how you fund these deals, I believe there will be a high degree of transparency, and in one day they will be more community owned and operated. But the reality is you're looking at like a Web 2.5 kind of BD team to handhold these folks. The question would be like, who gives a shit about these companies? That's not what's going to make or break our future.
00:26:22.102 - 00:26:57.694, Speaker A: I would say brand sentiment is really important. If you look at like you're running all of crypto, you got to work on brand sentiment right now. It's an absolute f. It's in the toilet, right? And so it wasn't even that great two years ago, but obviously it's only declined. And so things where you can bring in big enterprises or big companies and actually illustrate interesting things even if it is faux web3 web 2.5 if good brand sentiment driving it is not going to be what makes crypto in the future is not going to be the breakout app and experience. It's not going to generate hundreds of millions of users for these protocols.
00:26:57.694 - 00:28:12.050, Speaker A: But it's going to help with sentiment. When you start to improve sentiment at a macro level and at a protocol level, developers become interested in the space. So yeah, maybe it's like Starbucks and Salesforce Enterprise, it's like that's anti Web Three Ethos developers that are more logical, I think, that are looking at this in a more even killed way, thinking long term, do see value in that, but that's not enough, right? So then all of a sudden, what else can you do? Which is why then you need one a Web Three native team and you need a disproportionate amount of money to go towards that group. So if you think about those two groups, that Web Two enterprise group, we did BD deals, but the amount that was spent in that group versus the 100 million dollar fund being deployed to all kind of native Web Three developers, this pales in comparison. A vast majority, 80 plus percent of the distribution is happening in this Web Three native group and long term, that's where success is going to come from. But I always felt you had to do them in parallel because you have to improve sentiment because you need to attract people, full stop users, brands, developers, everybody, because you want what do people want at the end? They want a lot of transaction volume on a network so that it inevitably can be self sustainable.
00:28:12.210 - 00:28:29.406, Speaker B: I couldn't agree with that more. I love that you're so practical about all this. Okay, so when you're dealing with Nike, Starbucks and these other big brands and also just builders in the space, when you're at Polygon, what are they actually asking when they're coming onto the ecosystem? Like are they asking you about the tech stack? Is that really what they care about? Do they care about the other brands that are there or what are they.
00:28:29.428 - 00:29:17.226, Speaker A: Looking so it depends. Look, you've got people like a Visa or Starbucks who are they have teams that are focused on this that they get it. They are going to go deep on tech related questions and they have a bunch of questions that need asked. And so you want to be able to serve them with an appropriate forum people time structure to do that. Then you've got people that it's like the marketing guy's taking a chance on web3 metaverse buzwords. He has no idea what he's doing but he's like would be cool, right? I heard people are talking about NFTs to that. And so you've got to make decisions on how do you value time relative to these groups, right? Time, money, energy, resources, because these things can be cumbersome.
00:29:17.226 - 00:30:03.834, Speaker A: Like if you spend too much time, you got three, four people working on some low level NFT project with a big brand, but it's not going to do anything. That's a waste of time. Is brand sentiment driving that incremental by doing this project? Or is this like really wasting our company resources that we should be doing other things? You have to make those judgment calls but it's everything in between that they need. And so I always like doing and I'm much more like structured and principled in the way that I like to do things is deal review BD deal review on a category and invite everybody. It's open forum. Anybody can come, you can come. We're going to talk about it, weigh in, right? And at the end of the day, consensus on is this worth our time, is it worth our money? Is it worth our energy? And it's good for BD folks to weigh on this product.
00:30:03.834 - 00:30:27.974, Speaker A: Folks to weigh in on it. You're never going to get everybody fully aligned. Maybe there's big opportunities where everyone is like, we got to go do that. Which obviously gives you more conviction then. But it's good because you learn from it. You get more like everybody is in it because if you don't do it that way, you start to make business related decisions that product teams resent and that creates a lot of toxicity inside of a culture because they're not aligned on some of these things.
00:30:28.012 - 00:31:15.870, Speaker C: Philosophically, while you just mentioned the metaverse guy, maybe, oh, this would be cool. It kind of reminded me of something. You obviously have this unique background that you're not only head of a very prominent crypto company, but you were also head of gaming at YouTube, and so you're one of the few people who've actually done high level web two gaming, or just gaming and crypto. And it seems like there is a weird particular dislike from gamers towards NFTs, right? So I believe Mr. Beast has something called the Creator League or something, where one of the guys found out that there was actually NFTs and he's like, oh, I cannot support this technology. What is that about? Why do gamers just vehemently hate NFTs?
00:31:16.030 - 00:31:34.246, Speaker A: One, I love that guy. That guy, by the way, has been anti NFT all the time. So the fact that they even picked him was not smart to begin with. He's been very passionate about his perspective. And that's cool. I love hearing everybody's opinion. Yeah, look, gamers absolutely hate NFTs.
00:31:34.246 - 00:31:47.082, Speaker A: Like, absolutely hate it more than anything ever. I hear a lot of people, well, they hated mobile gaming. They did. Free to play. They did. But they really hate NFTs. So it is unique.
00:31:47.082 - 00:32:13.862, Speaker A: I think NFTs. Look, from an outside perspective, you just stop and look at NFTs as a gamer. You're like, I just like playing my video games. Like buying my skins and shit. I like playing with my friends. Then you look over the lake and you see these guys trading $100,000 monkey JPEGs like, wag me GM, join my discord, blah, blah, blah. And then you've got people pitching concepts that are not even don't even make sense.
00:32:13.862 - 00:32:36.318, Speaker A: I remember I saw somebody like Lincoln Park dude or whatever was like, what if you could take your AK 47 in this game and take it just like, terrible thoughts, terrible attrition. So their first introduction into NFTs was incredibly toxic. Like rugs scams and then behavior that they don't understand. Like, I own a punk. I get it. I love it. But you can certainly be empathetic being on the other side of being.
00:32:36.318 - 00:32:59.234, Speaker A: I don't want whatever the shit you guys are doing over there. Do not bring it in my video games. And I think that's the depth of it. I think we overcomplicate. And it's largely a Western issue, too, by the way. We are a little bit of an echo chamber, particularly in the west on some of this. But you can understand why there's hate, and you need to be able to show people what it is, that it's going to actually drive value for them.
00:32:59.234 - 00:33:23.100, Speaker A: And the industry hasn't been able to do that yet, and I believe that it will, but I'm okay with the resentment towards it. In fact, I'd even call it fair, because the industry has not produced something to change their mind. They're not evangelists. They're not going to go read about blockchains and networks and decentralization and how this is going to change their lives. It's not their responsibility to do it. 99% of people will never do that. That use the tech that they touch.
00:33:23.100 - 00:33:29.406, Speaker A: So until you put something in their hands that changes their minds. I think it's going to be that way, yeah.
00:33:29.428 - 00:34:06.678, Speaker C: And I find it interesting because you could argue Ethereum started because of gaming, right? Like, Vitalik had this moment where I think he was playing World of Warcraft or something, and the game developers just kind of changed the rules or some of the items or something, and he just got angry and he just started on this path of sovereignty and whatnot. And so there's actually some common kinship let's do at least ideals. But you said this is not going to change until you put something in their hands that will change their minds. What do you think? That obviously that's a hard question, but how do we change that? What are some of your thoughts on.
00:34:06.684 - 00:34:30.594, Speaker B: This, Ryan, before you go? Ryan I got to jump in because I hate that Vitalik story, which I don't think is real. Mer I don't know if it is. I don't think it is. The other thing, Ryan, maybe in this answer you can put in there, people talk about taking their assets from one game to the other, and that goes back to Vitalik. Like, his sword was no longer know what it originally was on skill points. Well, even in crypto, if you have an asset from a certain game, that game can still just shut down, right?
00:34:30.632 - 00:35:00.730, Speaker A: Totally. Yeah. That Blockchains wouldn't fix the wow issue that he experienced at, like, in fact, Counterstrike. Right, okay, so you own a knife, and I want to rant on Counterstrike on your point, Bert, as well. One, because it's like, I've spent way too much time since the last month playing Countersket since Meta came out, but there's a lot of things to unpack. There even Counterstrike, where you own the knife, they just made an update, like, graphically to some of the knives, and it decreased their value because aesthetically, they look different. So the game developer can do that.
00:35:00.730 - 00:35:27.042, Speaker A: Even if those assets were all on chain, the underlying asset could still change. They could be like, yeah, I'm going to update this file. Right. That, yeah, I have Garrett owns it, but I'm updating it, and now it's not going to look the same in a game. So, yeah, Garrett still owns it, but it looks different. So there are things that I don't think Blockchains fundamentally change. I would say when you talk about it, I like to just kind of have more not simplified dialogue, but actually get into it.
00:35:27.042 - 00:35:55.822, Speaker A: And I think of, like, just look at one thing that I think is interesting, is big games that are driving a disproportionate amount of that digital revenue. They come from this games as a service, platforms as a service, whatever you want to kind of call this category. You look at counterstrike. I think they launched their marketplace in 2013. Since 2019, they've made $32 billion. They've generated, like, $32 billion of transactions have occurred on the marketplace pretty significant. And this isn't even a top game.
00:35:55.822 - 00:36:19.670, Speaker A: Like, if you look at Fortnite Roblox, Minecraft and so forth, obviously a really big tactical shooter and has been around since 99. But in counterstrike, what can you do? Right? So I can go in. I can buy a knife in aftermarket on Steam. I can sell it inside of that market. They'll keep the money inside of Steam. So what does that create? Well, it's created now third party websites, right? Like skinporb. CS float all these different companies.
00:36:19.670 - 00:36:41.034, Speaker A: So now you go to this third party website. They basically they're like escrow for these digital items, but you can get money out. You KYC, right? So you go through the same kind of process. You link your Steam account, you link your bank account, right. You then have the item. They verify the items, kind of like history. They verify what percent fade and uniqueness and rarity it is.
00:36:41.034 - 00:37:01.426, Speaker A: And they display all this stuff. And so you can go up there, and I've got this Bayonet fade knife, and I can go sell it to Mert and all this stuff. They take 2% transaction fees during the trade. They do whatever, one 2% when you withdraw all of that. Pretty good system, right? You got to have this. It's not perfect, but it's good. I use it.
00:37:01.426 - 00:37:38.458, Speaker A: I love that. I think it's fine. So I've asked myself, if you really believe digital assets and stuff need to be on blockchains, well, what is missing? Right? This is where the rubber meets the road on the conversation. And so from a product features perspective, forget blockchains crypto. This is just, like, what I want. If I could create a product that I would want, I want to know the history of these items, who owned them? Did Mert, like, play in an ESL championship game with this AK 47, and do I own it now? I want a record keeping history of who owns these items, because it would change it. Like Garrett, who's not good at it, counterstrike with his little knife, but might be the same night as Mertz.
00:37:38.458 - 00:37:58.566, Speaker A: I'm going to look at Mertz, like, more valuable because know killed somebody with this weapon in one of the tournaments, too. I dominate Mert. Yeah. So I want to know that. I want to know that it can never be taken from, you know, maybe I had a rough night and I was, like, talking shit to Mert in counterstrike, and I get banned and lose my item, right. Or something like that. I want to be able to just know I own it.
00:37:58.566 - 00:38:24.542, Speaker A: Even if there's no nefarious or malicious behavior that I plan on doing. I just want to know that I own it. Well, why do you want it to know you own it? I want to sit in some kind of wallet where all my items from all my games are. Well, why do you want that? Because, say, I want to know Counterstrike on YouTube and they can see how many skins I have. They can know I'm a Counterstrike fan. Say Call of Duty Warzone wants to advertise for user acquisition and say, hey, if you own these three skins in Counterstrike, we'll give you this rare one over here. Come play our game.
00:38:24.542 - 00:39:00.566, Speaker A: Right. So what can you do on some of these systems? Well, you can kind of create OAuth. You could owe Auth activision ID and steam. You're going to do that across every single game? Steam, no, because it's not in their interest to do that level of data sharing between the organizations and give that out, but because they don't want to do that and don't want to give it out. Why don't they want to do that? Because that really benefits gamers and users and it takes power away from them, which is the point of all of it. Right. It is like we need to have a more distributed balance of power between X Company and X User in a lot of these scenarios.
00:39:00.566 - 00:39:44.710, Speaker A: And so right now the system that I want is best served on blockchain and on crypto, right? Being able to do trades, being able to rent my items out, being able to show I own them for other reasons, then you can kind of take this in a number of places. Like I think about I wish Delta knew my American Airline status so that I could switch over to and like just because I show all of my status in my wallet, I can just log in with my wallet and they can see that status. And so I put a big premium on things need to sit in a digital wallet. The things that they are sitting on need to be sitting on a network that's not owned by anybody. And I can do a number of things with these things. And so, long winded, this is my rant about Counterstrike. It gets me far.
00:39:44.710 - 00:40:08.250, Speaker A: It does get me far in a Web 2.5 system using like a centralized database and so forth, but it doesn't get me where I want from a product standpoint. So my take is this I want that. I think it's better for gamers. I think it gives better power distribution to gamers. If you don't need crypto and blockchain to do it, then do it, fine. But I would say from my understanding and how I've spent a lot of time looking at it, good luck.
00:40:08.250 - 00:40:30.440, Speaker A: Because it's really hard to build out those systems and it requires a ton of BD work because it's not just like smart contracts. Now you're doing long onerous deals between Activision and EA to do account linking and share these things and why is it in their best interest to do it? You're not. So yeah, this is my big thing. I want to see differently. And that's my gaming example.
00:40:32.490 - 00:41:14.740, Speaker C: I love the example of counterstrike. We used to actually play that in Turkey and Internet cafes with land parties and half life too. And we would switch accounts for different games and sell those back and forth. Yeah, it's big. Yeah, especially big in just maybe the underdeveloped countries. Okay, you talk about the dynamic needs to change, maybe the power dynamic from the creators of the game and then the players of the game, the gamers. What is the first step? How do we actually make that happen? Because, well, one gamers kind of hate NFTs and they probably hate crypto to begin with and then it's in the interest of the creators to not do that.
00:41:14.740 - 00:41:19.702, Speaker C: So what is the missing piece there? How will it happen?
00:41:19.836 - 00:41:36.406, Speaker A: Yeah, it's going to be a great game. Like, counterstrike phenomenal game, dude. Been around since 99. They've done like engine updates, maintain the integrity of the game, but different iterations as it's gone on. And that's what CS two is. They're not great games yet. Be honest with yourself, truly.
00:41:36.406 - 00:42:01.140, Speaker A: I'm a gamer. I'm down to look at any web Three game at any time and play it. There is not great games. Now there are ones I have found really interesting conceptually, like Pirate Nations on Polygons, on Arbitrum now, like pretty interesting makers of Farm Bill. Conceptually everything is cool because everything is on chain. Literally every single action that is taken is on chain. Now is that necessary? I don't know, but I find it to be fascinating to learn from.
00:42:01.140 - 00:42:45.982, Speaker A: But there's no good games. I mean, look at it. And then the thing about it is all this capital. So last year between Polygon and Immutable, the amount of capital deployed and games that are building on one of those two stacks was one and a half, $2 billion, something like that. Not from Immutable or Polygon, but like VC backed funding that went towards web3 games. The interesting thing now is how many of those games are pivoting back into web two? Probably a decent amount, right, that are like the blockchain crypto thinking, wait, right, we're going to just make a good game first and then out of those that remain, how many of them are going to be good games? Because the end of the day, if a gamer is just like, it's a good game and all of a sudden they're like, oh shit, I can do these things, I can do this. The experiences just have to unfold and happen.
00:42:45.982 - 00:43:25.626, Speaker A: The problem with betting on games being the catalyst for blockchain and crypto is good games take very long time to make. And this has gotten harder over the years, right? Because one, there's so much capital that has been injected into video games that there's so many games, whether they're out now or coming, a lot of the games, the top games own a disproportionate amount of market share and so getting people off those games to play other games is becoming increasingly difficult. And there's just again, it goes back to that finite amount of time. But at the end of the day, it's not actually that complicated. You just make a really great game. Gamers will start to play it and they'll just start to interact. The infrastructure.
00:43:25.626 - 00:43:58.834, Speaker A: Rails murd I saw your tweet about the UX thing. I actually think really could if you had a good game, I do think you could overcome some of these UX UI hurdles that we see in the space. But it's still kind of like a shitty experience of know, I'm going to create this wallet and see phrase and then I got to link it over here and then I go to a Phishing Scam and it's gone. So we've kind of got like we have some work to do. It will take many years to do, but that is what will happen. And it doesn't even need to be a high fidelity game. Like, look at minecraft is what changed YouTube for gaming.
00:43:58.834 - 00:44:12.154, Speaker A: And that game looked like complete shit when it first came out. And not like a high graphical game, but even the base layer of that game was very basic in a lot of ways but fascinating in others. Totally changed YouTube gaming forever.
00:44:12.282 - 00:45:04.590, Speaker B: I have two questions, but pick one of these because I think they're both a little bit tangential. So one of them is you were talking about you could have assets from a game, let's just say Fortnite, and then you're in Call of Duty and they can see that you have those assets, for example. And maybe they give you the keys to a beta of the next game coming out. So it's like some type of token gated access that reminds me of marketing and advertisements and Attribution, I'm curious how you think about because YouTube's business model is advertising, right? Do you see that coming into web3? So that's kind of question one you can run with and the other one is, do you think generative AI changes all this when it comes to NFTs and web3? Because, yes, there's like now for the first time you can have let me think out how to word this. With NFTs you can limit supply, but the whole thing holding back a lot of games is creativity and creating these NFTs. But if you have generative NFTs, does that even matter anymore? Because you're just going to have this unlimited supply of creative assets.
00:45:04.930 - 00:45:44.970, Speaker A: Man the second one is a tough loaded question. Look, I think with Generative AI, I think at the end of the day, these are tools and then the way that we use these tools change that. It doesn't like people that talk about it alienating or seizing these things to exist is tough for me because I look at they are tools that are going to enhance development. It will change roles, it will change positions. You'll have to change maybe expertise in things that you do. But at the end of the day, these are not going to replace people. I think people will get into other areas of expertise and they will continue to use all of these technological tools as just that.
00:45:44.970 - 00:46:01.374, Speaker A: Right. So one then it talks about the artists. Right. So it is manual and cumbersome to create all of these arts and these assets and so forth. Right. And so removing that, does the artist still have value? Yes, it just will be displaced and utilized differently than that. Right.
00:46:01.374 - 00:46:23.522, Speaker A: Like having an overall aesthetic or going in and changing some of these assets. There's still work to be done there. I do think it will help amplify people's work. I think you'll be able to do bigger things with smaller teams. Awesome. I think that's like a great outcome. Now if you go in AI further than just generative art and how that's changing gaming and it will have an influence on the games industry in a meaningful way long term.
00:46:23.522 - 00:46:42.886, Speaker A: There's also like AI and how it's used with NPCs and stuff. Like you'll have way more immersive game experiences. When your NPC is actually able to communicate and think about it, that can affect storyline based off of dialogue. That's also happening right now. Like a company called Gardens is doing that. So these things will be big breakthroughs. I do believe in the game space and will change the games industry.
00:46:42.886 - 00:47:18.226, Speaker A: But I think generally for the better in creating new experiences. AI is a little bit of a different beast, but I do think blockchains and having that, there's some level of authenticity of source material. News. Right. Remember there's that incident where they said there was an explosion at the Pentagon and stock market crumbled. If you could verify authenticity of some of these things because of generative AI and the underlying image of the New York Times are all minted on a blockchain. And so when you see something from New York Times publication to verify it's real, I think blockchains can serve a purpose.
00:47:18.226 - 00:47:21.400, Speaker A: There obviously two different things. But relative to.
00:47:23.530 - 00:48:06.040, Speaker C: Do you think do you think there are certain verticals within gaming that fit into crypto better than others? So, for example, I'm personally a big fan of card games like the Hearthstones or maybe even NBA TOPSHOT to an extent. Or games where you manage maybe like a team or like a car and you get to buy the pieces, put it together, et cetera. Like horse racing. I don't know, something like that. Because you said maybe the core thesis of web3 for gaming is maybe shifting the power balance between the creators and the gamers. Do certain verticals within gaming like genres of games fit web3 better than others? Or do you think are they all the same?
00:48:06.490 - 00:48:25.662, Speaker A: It's funny. Yes, I do. I think some of the categories that got manipulated early on are like pay to win. So I think card games not all card games. A lot of card games are pay to win. Then you looked at even some of the issues with Diablo Three, and the auction house was just like, pay to win. Diablo Immortal is like very pay to win.
00:48:25.662 - 00:49:07.770, Speaker A: By the way, I love all of those games. It is what it is on those games. I think it attracts like, crypto attracts those categories, but I don't like that. Right. I don't think that's where the interest is best fit. I go back to more of these open economies and marketplaces as the natural fit and places where you can do UGC, so like a roblox, where you can create mods or game modes or maps or whatever. How do you monetize those? How do you own those things? How do you share revenue with those things? How do you think about the owning digital goods and items? Kind of like our counterstrike conversation, these games where money doesn't influence outcomes, but actually the ecosystem itself.
00:49:07.770 - 00:49:48.666, Speaker A: So Counterstrike would be sweet if you could have one of your favorite NFT artists drops like a mint of M four s, right? I'm dropping 1000 M four s. I did the skin, the graphic skin for the M four. And those that hold this X NFT that I've already done. You're going to get a part of that drop as well, right? And they're like, if you look at the gosh, what's, the artifact guys? Those guys started like Counterstrike skins and know, like, that's their. So I can imagine they were doing sweet stuff. So I think where you actually are leveraging these UGC ecosystems and digital ownership is where the beauty is. And not to say card games can't be that.
00:49:48.666 - 00:50:04.158, Speaker A: They certainly can, like, parallel and so forth are doing really cool. Just, I say cautiously, games where money dictates outcome always scares me with crypto, because crypto will take advantage of that. Just inherently, I think it does.
00:50:04.244 - 00:50:37.206, Speaker B: Ryan, have you been following the situation with Unity at all? So Unity, it's like a game engine. And essentially they've had a hard time, I think, like monetizing a correct way, because other people, other gamers and developers can essentially take their engine, develop games, or I think, are often mobile with Unity, but they're having a hard time actually following up and ensuring that they're getting paid for that usage of their engine. And it's hard because you don't want have a bunch of lawyers on your team go chase down these little apps. But when you do have someone succeed, it's like, oh, I actually need to get paid for this. And so what they're doing is they're actually trying to monetize by installs now instead of what's actually going on in game. And installs can be gamed. Right.
00:50:37.206 - 00:50:40.040, Speaker B: Like an install doesn't mean that Velvet is actually making any money.
00:50:40.510 - 00:50:44.970, Speaker A: That's like terrible because marketing, you want installs. And so it's like counterintuitive then. Yeah.
00:50:45.120 - 00:51:11.106, Speaker B: And so I feel like crypto. Could find a way into gaming through this also, like Payments Mechanism, which is probably crypto's best product market fit that we have right now. Especially we're seeing a lot of momentum in Solana, but I'm hoping if you do have these different creators and designers developing whatever it might be, like new assets or designs for your gun and Call of Duty, it could be a way to have a simple interface to make these payments actually connect and track usage. I don't know if you've seen that, Ryan, in gaming yet, or is that.
00:51:11.128 - 00:52:08.470, Speaker A: Just like a theoretical no, I haven't seen mean Unity's got an interesting problem, right? It's like Unity and Unreal are mega giants in the game engine space, right, for different things from mobile to VR to whatever. Right. I do think there is something there on revenue sharing that could be really unique and interesting. That's kind of even what I was implying by talking about Roblox or Minecraft and how you kind of stoke the sub developer ecosystem in there where they're doing mods and now they're creating value for Roblox because users are coming into that game. How does Roblox see value? How do they see value? And they've got a good system like YouTube does with creators and know a majority of revenue goes to creators for YouTube, right? So they've got to kind of figure out that. But installs is really bad because I just think in general, you want game developers need to be able to promote installs as much as they can as part of their marketing and acquisition strategy. And a lot of those might not mean anything.
00:52:08.470 - 00:52:39.070, Speaker A: It's like you go for all those installs to just sync one person, get that one person over the twelve to 13 hours gameplay barrier where you can really start monetizing that user. And so when you take that away, you're basically taking away a funnel away from them. And so I feel like they might have retracted that. I'm not up to speed on the latest as in the last 72 hours on Unity, but what they did is not going to work. So I imagine they will rethink it. I don't see how it works. Like full stop non starter.
00:52:39.070 - 00:52:55.060, Speaker A: I love that Unity team like really good people over there. So I think they've got a tough problem. I don't think anybody in their right mind in Web Two is going to jump on crypto rails right now, nor should they, but it's a little bit of a conundrum for them in this current moment.
00:52:56.550 - 00:53:24.590, Speaker C: So we've talked about gaming a lot and BD. But Ryan, you talked about how when you were making the jump from YouTube to crypto, you weren't like the bitcoin white paper libertarian type. How have your thoughts on the industry evolved since then? Now that you're just the president of Polygon Labs, you're an advisor, what are your current thoughts on the industry excluding gaming?
00:53:26.610 - 00:53:56.022, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I just think coming out of being at Polygon, where you're just working day in and day out, you're just to a flaw, head down too much. One learning was like, I got to come up for hair more and make sure that I'm constantly recalibrating the way I think about the space. And obviously the last month and a half has allowed me to do that. We're in a really interesting time right now. Outside the obvious, right? Obviously, sentiment is as bad as it can be, might get a little bit worse, right? It's all good. We're going to find where the bottom is. And I don't mean price.
00:53:56.022 - 00:54:17.870, Speaker A: I mean like our darkest hour of the space. We're going to find out where that is. And I think we're getting close to it, thankfully, but we're going to get there. And I think there's going to be a number of things. One, we've spent, they said the space. Think of the amount of money at the infrastructure. And by that I mean L one, l two layer is insane.
00:54:17.870 - 00:54:53.494, Speaker A: No reasonable person would ever be able to sit here and justify it's insane. And I get it. It's the pursuit of, what all this? You believe in this stuff, where's it going to get built, right? And so, of course, if I'm a money man, I'm putting it on the bedrock, right? And so I do understand the thesis behind all of it, but that's going to go away. Like, yeah, a lot of these L ones, l two S sitting on funds, right? Like decent sized capital from fundraising with nobody. They're like ghost chains. And now we're at the bottom. You can't buy activity, you can do the AirDrop shit.
00:54:53.494 - 00:55:15.930, Speaker A: You can do all that. It's all short term, right? When time actually comes, none of that's real, right? And it's cool. Everybody gets to do their little AirDrop thing. It's fun. Every network does it. It's all part of the game, right? But at the end of the day, that doesn't do anything. So I think those games are pretty much over, right? Like, obviously AirDrop Farmers and these other things will keep kind of doing on some of these other ghost protocols.
00:55:15.930 - 00:55:46.698, Speaker A: And so we're going to see a huge consolidation. I think it's going to be great for the space. It's going to be great because talent is now going to be more concentrated across certain areas. I think you'll have five, maybe six protocols across the board that are really driving an outsized amount of traffic transactions, app development. This will now cause VC capital to move up a layer towards an app layer, which is where funding needs to keep happening. Infrastructure. I actually think if you even think two years ago you're much more advanced on.
00:55:46.698 - 00:56:18.318, Speaker A: This has come a significant way in 18 to 24 months and looking twelve months out, even more so like what Salana is doing. Arbitrum, optimism, polygon. All these different folks have really good game plans over the next 18. To 24 months. That will abstract away some of the technical hurdles for a lot of developers to just focus on building great experiences out and great apps and what they can do uniquely. That layer is going to need another injection of capital. Now that's going to come from L ones and L two S that still have meaningful treasuries and users and a good infrastructure.
00:56:18.318 - 00:57:03.694, Speaker A: So like, who is that group? Who's that cohort that'll probably be the group that survives and actually goes on to be a meaningful blockchain in 25, 26, 27. And then hopefully you get some kind of like resurgence in the space. VC capital comes back in at a developer layer and now you start to see building happening and these are where you have the breakout hits. Protocols are ready for it. So if that was like my TLDR of how the next 36 months play out, that's how I think it's going to play out. That's been something that I've not that it's that I think it's very obvious kind of that plan, even if you disagree with it's not like a crazy thought, but stepping back and truly observing where we're at without any bias, really, without any kind of impulse, without any influence, that is where I've netted out outside of gaming.
00:57:03.822 - 00:57:35.520, Speaker B: I think you're investing on the side right now, so maybe you could talk about that some. But what sectors interest you the most? And I'm asking a double question here, but a lot of people loved pointing to applications that could bring in people that are gaming. Because gaming became this almost the savior of crypto in people's minds. Like, we need gaming to take off or crypto is done to reference crypto is 3 billion gamers and the gaming industry is bigger than entertainment and music. So I understand why people are saying that, but yeah, what else interests you? Do we need gaming to make DeFi work? Do you think we need DeFi to work to make gaming work? Are those just two separate things?
00:57:36.770 - 00:58:13.530, Speaker A: Yeah, I think gaming can't be the savior, but it will play an instrumental part long term. But it's not like the ship to save crypto is not coming from games in the next 24 months. I do think it comes, but I don't think it's like the here and now thing. So you just really have to what do you do to prepare for it that kind of segues into I think DFI is important because I do think having liquidity inside of protocols is really important for a lot of these games to get going and being able to do the things that you want to do. So I do think you have DeFi. I feel pretty passionate. Like DeFi needs to be an instrumental part of any protocol.
00:58:13.530 - 00:58:52.310, Speaker A: It can have varying degrees of what that means. Right, but I do think that is a critical piece to have kind of that backbone of liquidity there, but we'll see. Time will tell on some of that stuff, but I think gaming is going to take a little bit longer for it to show up. I think thinking about gamers is great because gamers in general tend to be more tech savvy, more progressive, more keen to drive new technical innovations. So I think gamers are going to be interested as this space kind of flushes itself out and weeds out some of the negativity and badness of it, that gamers will be interested even if their first experience isn't necessarily gaming.
00:58:52.970 - 00:59:12.690, Speaker B: That makes sense. Yeah, it feels like a lot of crypto. I mean, this, again, won't be the savior, but it's just about aging into crypto adoption because I've heard you say that gaming right now is the number one source of community and entertainment for the younger generations. And also just like, they're more online, right? Like if you're, I don't know, 76 and making laws right now, you're not online much and you don't care about crypto.
00:59:12.790 - 00:59:46.966, Speaker A: Oh, man, don't even get me started about going to DC. Yeah, I mean, how you explain crypto blockchain gaming and tech to somebody that's literally on a Motorola flip phone, the barriers. I mean, I think I'm pretty good at simplifying tech related. That's like what Google, if any Google taught me more than anything, is like, simplifying this stuff from a tech perspective, man, good luck bridging the gap. Even you can't wrap their head around Facebook and Instagram and stuff. So when you take them on a rabbit hole of decentralization, it's pretty gnarly. Yeah.
00:59:46.988 - 00:59:58.826, Speaker B: So Ryan, to wrap it up, before we do the rapid fire, I want to know just what's next for you. So you were at YouTube for eight years. You went to Polygon Labs as president. Now you're an advisor. But yeah, what's next? What are you looking to get into?
00:59:59.008 - 01:00:25.214, Speaker A: Yeah, I've been spending time obviously thinking about the I've been doing the angel stuff, which I love because I just love working with founders. I love interesting projects. That's cool. To me, that has been great. Not a lot of my time, but great. Spending my time doing that. I kind of had to think about do I go back to gaming? Do I go back into big tech? Do I stay in the crypto side? What is it? Do I go into VC? Because I love VC.
01:00:25.214 - 01:00:53.526, Speaker A: Anybody that knows me knows I want to go into VC Next or one day. And I think ultimately my take on it is this. These next, like, five to eight years are going to be the most formative years for blockchains, full stop. And I also think when you think about the work on the underlying infrastructure, it is a finite moment in time. Right. These things will get to a place where you're now focusing on the next layer of it. They are autonomously operating.
01:00:53.526 - 01:01:28.182, Speaker A: And yeah, you have groups that will do upgrades and all that. I'm not saying work will forever be done on them, right? But as a contributor group and building and standing them up, this is a moment in time and I just have to participate in that. I am super passionate about it. The one thing I've been able to kind of look at is why am I getting up every morning and what gets me really excited. And I keep getting drawn into this, these topics, these conversations, these discussions. This is where my energy is spent now. I'm gaming a lot, but I think I've done so much and that my time already in life has been to that, that this feels like where I've got to put my energy.
01:01:28.182 - 01:01:59.090, Speaker A: And so I'm going to do something in the protocol space. I don't know exactly what, but it just feels, I'm pretty sure on this. I don't know, I'm still thinking through it, but where I stand today, this is it. I do want to do VC one day. I'm super passionate about it, but I'm also 36 and feel like that's a one way door and it'd be a waste of a lot of operating energy that I have. I'm ready to put in like 1213, 14 hours days for this space for a while. I don't need the three and a half day work week yet.
01:01:59.090 - 01:02:01.250, Speaker A: I want it one day, just not today.
01:02:01.400 - 01:02:17.000, Speaker C: All right, well, that's good to hear that you'll be staying in crypto. Definitely need as much time as we can. Totally. Roger, if you're listening to this, you know what to do. Hit up Ryan's DM. Well, let's have some fun. Let's do some rapid fire.
01:02:17.000 - 01:02:49.060, Speaker C: Just going to ask know quick rapid fire questions and just try to answer as quickly as you can. But feel free to expand if you think something needs additional nuance, unlike Twitter. Cool. Okay, so imagine you are working at the machinima equivalent of crypto right now and you are writing these letters to the crypto industry to improve as you did with gaming once. What do you write?
01:02:49.910 - 01:03:31.440, Speaker A: I think probably three main topics I would cover would be how we operate with more harmony as an industry, how we explain things in a way that's more universally and simplified and understood, and how we just focus on building compelling products right. And try to move away from a lot of the noise. And it would be something along those lines. And particularly, I think the most important is aligning everybody. Like competition is really good. I actually think that's how people get the best out of each other, but also a time and a place where a little bit of camaraderie and alignment on some of these things would be good. That would probably be where I would be at now.
01:03:33.030 - 01:03:34.930, Speaker C: PlayStation or Xbox?
01:03:37.430 - 01:03:52.150, Speaker A: I obviously started PC gaming and that's like what I still do, I think PlayStation, I played a lot on Xbox, but PlayStation I think is where I would go on that one. But PC gaming, keyboard, mouse over everything, full stop. Then PlayStation.
01:03:54.250 - 01:03:56.440, Speaker C: Your top three PC games ever?
01:03:58.670 - 01:04:04.490, Speaker A: Well counterstrike, obviously. Probably World of Warcraft and team Fortress. Classic.
01:04:07.230 - 01:04:10.830, Speaker C: Okay, what three worst games you've ever played?
01:04:15.250 - 01:04:40.290, Speaker A: Hated call duty. Advanced warfare. I don't know, man. I've not really played bad games. I mean, I've only get drawn into the good ones. Yeah, I really have not played terrible games or allocated much of my time to it's. A couple of, like, shitty Maddens that came out college, right? That not big on but yeah, hard to spend any time on bad games.
01:04:40.290 - 01:04:48.780, Speaker A: And I'm such a creature of habit. Dude, I've been playing Counterstrike since 99, man. I go back to that. Oh, Valorant. As well as a great PC game.
01:04:50.830 - 01:04:56.454, Speaker C: Oh, yeah. I'm going to keep going with the gaming theme. Elden ring or skyrim?
01:04:56.582 - 01:04:57.222, Speaker A: Skyrim.
01:04:57.286 - 01:04:57.766, Speaker B: Skyrim.
01:04:57.798 - 01:04:58.570, Speaker A: Incredible.
01:04:59.390 - 01:05:10.800, Speaker C: Oh, wow. Didn't even think about it. Okay, your top five favorite crypto protocols. Not in order.
01:05:13.250 - 01:05:33.894, Speaker A: I particularly spend so much time looking at just like, L ones. Well, one, I've found myself fucking around on GMX. And so Arbitrum has been fun. Like doing small, long, fun, wild positions with pure boredom, I think. Obviously. I love polygon. Love what Salana has been doing.
01:05:33.894 - 01:06:12.626, Speaker A: Salana is great, man. I think as an all L one, I was talking to somebody the other day and was like, definitely an ETH maxine. I think Salana is going to have this career of it's. Like know, you have like IBM and Apples over here and no market share, but then really over amount of like, people really find something unique. And I think Solana's on that. So I love them. I think the DK Sync team is doing some really great, you know, yes, they get a lot of flak on the fraud proof stuff, but I do think the way that they're moving the space forward, some of the stuff that they've done with Coinbase, you can have whatever opinion you have on it.
01:06:12.626 - 01:06:20.230, Speaker A: I think it's pretty interesting. I could probably go on, but when I think of the companies that are capturing my attention right now, I think it's those groups.
01:06:20.570 - 01:06:26.434, Speaker B: I think one of our goals should be to drop the Alt L one from the dictionary when we bring up Salana.
01:06:26.482 - 01:06:47.886, Speaker A: That is. I think over time it will. Dude, this is such an insider jargon that I don't even think people, when you think five, six years from now, they're just going to be like, oh, it's that thing. I don't know how much we're even going to focus on ethereum. Yeah, I do think ethereum is going to be a big part of this value layer and I think it's going to be huge. But that's not the end all. Be all.
01:06:47.886 - 01:07:04.162, Speaker A: I don't want to get Mert started on another hour long conversation either with triggering comments. But yeah, Salana is here to stay and Tolly and Raj are great, great founders, great team. I'm pretty bullish on them long term, being a part of this. And, yeah, I agree. I don't think it's all L one, L two stuff. It's just there we go.
01:07:04.296 - 01:07:08.674, Speaker B: Yeah, that and monolithic versus modular. We're going for integrated. Ryan, I got one for you.
01:07:08.712 - 01:07:08.914, Speaker A: Okay.
01:07:08.952 - 01:07:13.400, Speaker B: So you're getting into cooking. I believe so. If you're in the kitchen, what are you chefing up? What's your best?
01:07:14.010 - 01:07:38.798, Speaker A: So cooking, golfing, and gaming have been my three favorite Hobies my whole life. Well, most of my life since 11, 12, 13 years old. Golfing I picked up way later during COVID though, I'm cooking. So, honestly, dude, I've been hitting up a lot of dishes. I think I probably will continue to focus most on pasta dishes, and I want to start getting into baking. So different breads, sourdough bread, so forth. That's been an area I haven't done enough of.
01:07:38.798 - 01:08:09.254, Speaker A: So I'm going to keep spending some more time there. And you really have to make some like, there's some sacrificial bread I've had to make where it's completely terrible because I didn't do it right. So I'm going to keep working on that. So, honestly, baking, I'm going to get really honed in on baking over the next couple of weeks, just in time for the holidays. And then when I go back to work, the amount that I can cook is, like, nonexistent, or at least not of any kind of high degree. But I'm hosting left and right here, man. I've been chef whiz in the kitchen for friends and family, and I'm having a blast doing it.
01:08:09.372 - 01:08:10.038, Speaker B: Love it.
01:08:10.124 - 01:08:13.674, Speaker C: Nice. We should get you to come to breakpoint and cook us all.
01:08:13.712 - 01:08:14.262, Speaker B: Be the chef.
01:08:14.326 - 01:08:22.000, Speaker A: I would. I'm down. I'm down. I love it. Honestly, the best part of cooking is doing it for other people, and I find that to be really enjoyable part of it.
01:08:22.530 - 01:08:36.002, Speaker C: Ryan, if you had to pick one game in Crypto to show your friends from YouTube to say, hey, check out crypto gaming, which game is it?
01:08:36.056 - 01:08:39.170, Speaker A: Midnight Society, for sure. Dr District.
01:08:41.190 - 01:08:42.526, Speaker C: What is Midnight style? Can you describe?
01:08:42.558 - 01:09:00.710, Speaker A: It's like a battle royale. He's got a kind of a new term. It is slightly different. It's like an extraction game. It's cool. It's got a Call of Duty meets, like, Daisy meets, I guess, like, a couple of different kind of games. Inspired.
01:09:00.710 - 01:09:32.994, Speaker A: I think what they're doing is pretty cool. They're doing, like, early access memberships where NFTs, so as the game gets more popular, you can resell them for higher price points. If you own one of the original membership, like founder passes, you have a unique helmet and aesthetic that is like a one to one to you. They're doing cool stuff. Of what utility is inside of that membership pass. I think a big part of that is they want to do different passes. They want people to be able to if they participated early in the game, be rewarded for that as more attraction to the game, more users come in.
01:09:32.994 - 01:09:55.130, Speaker A: I think because Dr. Disrespect is behind the game, it's his studio, people are more likely like other creators to play the game, be more open minded to the different aspects of the crypto part. It's a very small part of it. You don't need crypto at all. You don't need to own an Ft. You can play the game free to play. Even the access, you can just buy access to it, just standard credit card.
01:09:55.130 - 01:10:21.234, Speaker A: And then there's this NFT component. I think that's cool. I do think you babysep people into like that's where gamers are going to start to get comfortable and then we're not going to use NFTs as such a term. I hate the term. I hate it. I don't hate it because people hate the term. It just is so silly of a term to use when you're just talking about functionally, what does it do? It's nonsense to kind of like it's just all bad.
01:10:21.234 - 01:10:27.720, Speaker A: So anyway, I think when there's that underlying item, people will come around to that.
01:10:28.410 - 01:10:54.990, Speaker C: All right, two final questions. One is, what do you think about Friendtech? And two, you are a great operator and crypto probably has, I would say, a pretty significant shortage of great operators. What is one piece of advice you would give to people in crypto about operating, doing business development and just what you've learned over the years into maybe like one piece of advice?
01:10:56.050 - 01:11:24.022, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that Friend tech is a mess in a lot of ways as far as behaviorally, what it's doing. But if you're able to remove yourself from that, I think there is a unique future. These things you have to explore, you have to try different things and keep iterating on it. And that team, it's in its infancy of whatever it's building. They're making these updates like changing terminology from to keys and so forth. Right? Look, I don't know if that's the team. I don't know the team.
01:11:24.022 - 01:12:06.034, Speaker A: I don't know if that's going to be the group that breaks through. But tinkering with the social layer and figuring that out is really important. And this work, even if it will be built upon, like whether it's them that do it or another team, they will take the learnings of friendtech and what's happening right now in that space and build on it. Now if it's just these membership passes that allow for chat rooms and obviously what value you create in there dictates these prices, there's got to be a lot more work to be done there. But that's like my I'm always somewhere in the I like to be optimistic about things and that people intend to do well. And so there's not a lot of that in the space. I think a lot of malicious and nefarious behavior exists in the space, but people are genuinely trying things that there's no blueprint for.
01:12:06.034 - 01:12:32.378, Speaker A: So you don't know some of the effects that will be created from some of these things. So I'm encouraged we'll see how it turns out. But I would say little cautious as well. On the operator side, I think generally what we're missing is just more like methodical, even killed operators, right? Where it's too much of reaction, of when things are great or when things are so down that like, oh, I'm going to go work in crypto. It's the next big thing. I'm going to go over here. Or like, oh, crypto is dead and everyone hates it.
01:12:32.378 - 01:13:05.510, Speaker A: I'm going to get out of here. It's like you've got to find yourself somewhere in the middle. And you can't be impulsive because this space is so erratic with highs and lows. Your impulsivity allows you to react too much to either one. When things are great, you're on cloud nine. And when things are bad, the world is over, right? And so operators have to be able to do that. And I think it's really important not just like being a leader in the space to do that, but I think those that you're going to attract to work for you are so emotionally affected by that erratic behavior, whether it impacts them financially, their families, when they go home, and that's what they're dealing with.
01:13:05.510 - 01:13:25.070, Speaker A: So when you just add on to that, you amplify the already existing troubles and issues within the space. And so being even keel will allow that to kind of distribute within your organization a little bit more so that you can be clear thinkers. Because if it is always wild, you will not make the best decisions.
01:13:25.650 - 01:13:39.506, Speaker B: It's a great answer, a great way to close the podcast. Ryan, thanks for coming on. I love the energy and the enthusiasm that you have. Obviously, like, a great product mine. And we're lucky to have you in crypto. Mert would say you got that riz, that charisma. Bert to give you a shout out.
01:13:39.506 - 01:13:48.290, Speaker B: I was listening to a podcast with Ryan that he did last month, and he actually gave you a shout out for being one of the best spokesperson on Best.
01:13:48.360 - 01:13:50.642, Speaker A: One of the best, hands down, for sure.
01:13:50.776 - 01:13:57.750, Speaker B: I wanted to make you blush. But Ryan, thanks so much for coming on. It's a lot of fun. I'd love to have you on in a couple months. So thanks again. This was fun.
01:13:57.820 - 01:13:59.382, Speaker A: We'll do it, boys. It was great.
01:13:59.516 - 01:14:00.580, Speaker B: All right, we'll see you next time.
