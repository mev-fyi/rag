00:00:00.170 - 00:00:33.750, Speaker A: Is Avalidge considered legacy? And if so, why? And the point tying into Tokenomics is interesting. I actually think that a lot of these next gen chains take a similar view that I was expressing earlier around like the fee mechanism, which is a lot of them are much more interested in just max throughput as long as the fees pay above the Dos rate and then don't make the validator margin based on fee collection, but rather make it based on inflation of the network. And that the hope is that the growth of the network surpasses the inflation rate. I guess I think that's mostly how those are decided.
00:00:40.090 - 00:00:53.114, Speaker B: What's up, everybody? Welcome to another episode of Lightspeed. Today we are joined by Luigi from Avalanche. He is the head of DeFi and Developer Relations. And we also have Patrick O'Grady, who's the VP of Engineering. Guys, welcome to the show.
00:00:53.312 - 00:00:54.800, Speaker C: Thanks for having us.
00:00:55.170 - 00:01:02.720, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for having us. Listening to your recent podcast lately just to make sure I was ready for this. So we should be good to go.
00:01:03.090 - 00:01:03.934, Speaker C: Love to hear it.
00:01:03.972 - 00:01:32.486, Speaker B: Love to have you guys on as well. I'm in a bit of a bubble, but when I'm thinking of crypto, there's really three ecosystems that I see day to day and they all have unique use cases. So one is Ethereum, which is this maximally decentralized L one. And now they're focusing on a modular roadmap. Then you have Salana, which is this global synchronized state machine. And then you often hear about App chains, which people, I would say, more or less default to Cosmos. Now you have Avalanche, which I think I want to know where does Avalanche fit in that story? What is avalanche's? Core thesis.
00:01:32.486 - 00:01:38.410, Speaker B: But to get there, I think it'd be great to start at a high level like what Avalanche is and the general design layout.
00:01:39.390 - 00:02:11.622, Speaker C: Cool. Yeah, I think I'll probably jump in and then let Patrick fill in. Patrick tends to be much more detailed than I am. But yeah, Avalanche as a whole is, know, architecturally. I like to think about it as somewhere in between Polkadot and Cosmos. That's one way to explain for know, you don't have, I guess, as free form of an architecture as Cosmos. You don't have sort of like this very stringent sort of architecture that Polkadot has with their parachains, but at a high level.
00:02:11.622 - 00:02:36.074, Speaker C: Basically the way it works is you have this primary network which consists of the P chain, X chain and chain. We really went for simplicity here. And basically each one of those chains serve different functions. The C chain is the one anybody uses. Avalanche has probably used. It's the EVM based chain. That's where like Aave, Trader Joe, all those types of applications.
00:02:36.074 - 00:03:11.418, Speaker C: Look, the p chain is where staking occurs on avalanche. And then the exchange is for native asset creation. It probably has the least amount of usage out of the three chains on the primary network. But those three chains make up the primary network. And all the validators of avalanche validate that primary network and then on top of the primary network. Basically, avalanche allows this notion of subnets. And subnets basically are effectively a way to create new areas that people can validate at the most generic level.
00:03:11.418 - 00:03:41.710, Speaker C: So it can be a blockchain, it could be multiple blockchains in one subnet. But basically it's a collection of validators agreeing to validate something. Right now that mainly is a blockchain. And it's completely isolated from the primary network. Similar to the idea of Cosmos in a lot of ways, where you have this app chain thesis and sovereign networks. So that's like a high level sort of architecture, and then we could dive deep into different items.
00:03:41.790 - 00:04:06.300, Speaker D: So for somebody who is just maybe getting into crypto and trying to form a mental model around polkadot, cosmos, avalanche, you said avalanche. Maybe one way to think about it is between polkadot and Cosmos, but maybe without resorting to analogies, if possible. How exactly does it fit into the landscape of crypto infrastructure? Why would somebody pick Avalanche over Cosmos, for example?
00:04:07.790 - 00:04:18.666, Speaker A: Yeah, so avalanche is built for launching, really like these custom sovereign connected chains. So you may say, well, that sounds like Cosmos. Well, that sounds like polkadot.
00:04:18.698 - 00:04:19.326, Speaker C: Right.
00:04:19.508 - 00:04:51.414, Speaker A: The idea being that in the world of avalanche, the primary network plays a slightly larger role than different ecosystems in that it serves as this registry system for different validators to basically look up different key material about other validators that they may know nothing else about. So in the case of a subnet, what that will mean is usually if you have like a custom blockchain or something like that, the next biggest question you have is, well, how do I actually communicate with other people doing the same thing?
00:04:51.452 - 00:04:51.654, Speaker C: Right?
00:04:51.692 - 00:06:06.526, Speaker A: If you just come to avalanche and you launch a blockchain but you're not communicating with anybody, doesn't make a lot of sense to be in Avalanche because the benefits come from this light connectivity framework that sits behind the VM scene. And so what the primary network allows you to do is without actually validating or participating in any other subnet authorize messages that come from other subnets and then use that data. So it's really optimized for these kind of separate subnetwork regions, but allowing for very high throughput connectivity between those subregions. In the world of Cosmos, there's a cost per connection that's formed between different cosmo zones using IBC. So you have to pass headers back and forth between different zones to keep them up to date and the channels up to date to actually pass information. Which is why you don't see cosmo zones connected to every other cosmo zone. In the world of avalanche, you have this registry, what we'll call the private network, that makes each additional point to point connection no variable or marginal cost because you just look up the value to validate any messages from the primary network instead of actually having to pass header information back and forth.
00:06:06.526 - 00:06:22.680, Speaker A: So it's more optimized for a higher fixed cost, low to minimal variable cost messaging system, whereas Cosmos, I would argue, is meant for much lower fixed cost, but the variable cost per network connection scales more quickly.
00:06:23.370 - 00:07:01.860, Speaker C: I would say if I really had to simplify it and bring it back up, the way I would think about Avalanche as a whole and what the focus is and who directly it's going after, you want to build your own blockchain. You want to be able to customize it. You come to Avalanche. And the reason for this, number one, you get this super fast consensus out of the box. Two, there are multiple different frameworks that are being built to actually allow you to customize at a very deep level the blockchain that you want to build. So that can be multiple different types of virtual machines. It could be different languages that you want to write in.
00:07:01.860 - 00:07:27.526, Speaker C: There's just like a whole frontier of the thesis is that we believe that people will want to customize their blockchains. Right. So Solana, you have this super fast state machine. And that's kind of the thesis from my seat. Ethereum has this focus on the EVM, and they're customizing and whatnot, and everything rolls up to one chain. Avalanche. Basically, it's a bunch of interconnected networks.
00:07:27.526 - 00:07:34.540, Speaker C: We believe people have different ideas on how to customize a blockchain, and then we want to give you the tools to be able to do that.
00:07:34.910 - 00:07:49.714, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a really good overview. Patrick, I think you came straight out of Stanford into the crypto space when you joined Avalanche. You talk about I know you're extremely technical. When you were looking at other ecosystems at the time, whether that was Ethereum or Solana, why did you pick, like, what fascinated you?
00:07:49.832 - 00:08:34.302, Speaker A: Yeah, there was actually a missing gap there where I spent two years at Coinbase, which gave me a perfect front row seat to all the cool stuff. So I was on the crypto engineering team there. I actually worked on the integration for Polkadot and Solana and Cosmos. So I got to learn all of them from a very deep layer, deep level. I actually was part of the conversation early on, maybe to the chagrin of some of the Solana folks of adding timestamps into Solana because that was required for Coinbase's integration at that time. So sorry about that. It's the wrong way, but yeah, I think that gave me a really good front row seat to figure out the different, really, the technical trade offs everyone's making.
00:08:34.302 - 00:09:30.222, Speaker A: I think in the crypto marketing space at least, it's really easy to try and pitch or attempting to try and pitch your product as the silver bullet or like the network as the silver bullet for everything. Right. Where it's limitless scaling, perfect security, whatever, right. And behind the scenes you take maybe takes a few layers of the onion back there's, trade offs everyone's making, right? Like maybe you're giving off some like trading off some sort of flexibility in smart contracting for higher performance. Maybe instead you're trying to increase throughput by raising the minimum requirement for hardware or maybe to a reasonable level of hardware requirement where it never was a good idea to run things on like four cores or eight cores for a global distributed network. So while I was there, I got to talk to all these different teams and really working there. But with Avalanche, it came down for me at least to the architecture and the consensus mechanism.
00:09:30.222 - 00:10:40.086, Speaker A: So at that time so when I left or when I joined Avalanche, it was January 2021, the things that really mattered to me at that time were I liked proof of stake because I felt it was a better fit for blockchain than proof of work. I thought that the ASIC centralizing forces of proof of work were really challenging to actually deal with. And so proof of stake I think was a better way to actually distribute participation in a network without requiring me as an average person to go buy a shit ton of Asics to actually participate in something like this. But the issue was most proof of Stake consensus mechanisms at that time were big O N squared or even higher in network complexity. And so when I stumbled across Avalanche, it had a very different network complexity that I thought made proof of stake much more open and easier to participate in. I know Solana does something very different as well to also make it more open in larger staking sets. But at that time, I think what really first excited me was this whole notion of subsampling.
00:10:40.086 - 00:10:44.410, Speaker A: Like many other people, it was crazy that it worked.
00:10:44.560 - 00:10:49.994, Speaker D: And so as I can you expand on what subsampling is?
00:10:50.112 - 00:11:10.222, Speaker B: And actually I'm going to go really quick because we touched on you were talking about complexity and I think something you could think about is Cosmos. They only have 100 to 150 validators because you have to do all to all communication. In Salana, they have something with Turbine where you don't have to do that. And that's why you can have more than 2000 nodes. And right now at Avalanche, I think you have what's the current node count roughly?
00:11:10.366 - 00:11:12.946, Speaker A: I think it's like 1300 value, which.
00:11:12.968 - 00:11:17.202, Speaker B: Is something you couldn't do in Cosmos, for example, because of that all to all communication.
00:11:17.346 - 00:12:29.340, Speaker A: Yeah, we think that the theoretical limit of that is much higher than what it's currently being used for. But nonetheless, the notion that if you told me in 2021, yeah, we're going to have 2000 validators on a proof of stake network, people would have been like, no way, just not possible. Right? Because if you love everything else about it but the foundation doesn't make any sense when you join a project you can only go so far, right? And so for me, the first thing was actually getting comfortable and understanding what was exciting there. And so to back up what's subsampling, what's big O complexity, right? So as you alluded to at that time, actually, I know that a lot of this research is always ongoing, so I may be speaking slightly out of date on what the state of the art is, but at that time, the typical mechanism for actually achieving consensus was you have some slot where you're a block producer. What you'll do is you'll form some block, send that block out to all the other participants in consensus. They'll look at that block, see if it's valid, see if it builds on the parent. They expect whatever, and then they'll sign it and then send those signatures back to you.
00:12:29.340 - 00:13:12.570, Speaker A: So in every step of the consensus, you get this nice single shot finality property, right? If you get enough signatures back, you can just finalize the data there. But you have this problem where the block producer is always this hotspot when they're building. They have to be this focal point for in and out bandwidth for everybody. Let's say that I know that a lot of people nowadays just send the transaction IDs out to try and avoid some of this problem. But back then, that was not the point at all and you just sent the whole transaction out. So, like, let's say they had two megabyte blocks and like a thousand participants. Well, in your single slot of a few seconds, you have to now send two megabytes to every other Validator on the network.
00:13:12.570 - 00:13:59.358, Speaker A: So then get it back off of them, right? So you can see where the bottleneck starts to happen in Avalanche, it's different in that what will happen is the block producer will actually send out block, a block to the network, and then that's kind of where their poor part in the core operation stops. And then as other people in the network, other validators, hear about a block, they then just start asking subsets of the network repeatedly, what do you think? Let's say you have a group of 100 people and I get a block. I'm going to go ask 20 random people waited by stake. What do you think? Oh, 15 out of 20 of you said that that's your preference. Cool. I'll keep track of that. Now, if I do that 20 more times, I will finalize the block.
00:13:59.358 - 00:14:19.790, Speaker A: And so in a network where you have like 1300 validators, when I'm actually verifying or validating any particular block, I may only talk to like 400 people. So you can already see the sublinear nature of the network complexity there. So that's what first really got me excited about avalanche.
00:14:20.450 - 00:14:42.486, Speaker C: What's cool about that is it allows for sort of like very fast finality and while maintaining a very decentralized validator set, that's like true finality, like the the transaction is complete theoretically less than a second in hundreds of milliseconds potentially. Yeah.
00:14:42.508 - 00:15:04.730, Speaker B: So that's extremely technically interesting. Now it's like what does that enable? So one, you said it's quick, finality, but also I think you described Patrick, why it's important that you can support such a large validator set. Like one reason is like you just want decentralization, right? But right now I believe anytime you launch a subnet you need to have validators to essentially secure that chain, right? And then why do those validators also need to be on the P chain?
00:15:05.890 - 00:16:08.626, Speaker A: Great question. Something that's currently being actively discussed in the community right now of how exactly the best way to scale avalanche is. So right now and since the growth of the network to be a subnet validator you had to stake at least the minimum stake amount, 2000 a box on the primary network, become a primary network validator. So validate and verify the primary network and then opt into some sort of subnet and then validate there too potentially staking whatever staking token it has as well. Now the reason for that, right, is on the PCHAIN is actually stored two really important pieces of information. First it is your stakeway in the subnet and then two, it's like key information used to actually verify your ability to send messages to other subnets. And so from a security perspective you could understand why some subnet validator or something like that would think it's important to actually validate that information and lend their stakeweat there.
00:16:08.626 - 00:17:14.822, Speaker A: Additionally, you need to be able to look up that information as a subnet validator, actually participate in the subnet because the proposal ordering on the subnet is dependent upon the state weight on the primary network. So you need to be able to look that up. And so if you're not syncing that you can't actually look that up and then you can't actually participate in the subnet. Now what we figured out later on was that you really actually only need to verify the PCHAIN to do that. And so there's been some proposals lately, at least discussed, to change this a lot and actually make it so that if you're a subnet validator, you don't actually have to be a primary network validator for obvious reasons, which is like if you're trying to scale a subnet to max throughput, it's kind of weird that you have to also sync the C chain at the same time. Right? Kind of goes against the idea that you could actually maximally scale your subnet accordingly. But that's been one of the biggest things also because the stake requirement means that creating a subnet becomes very expensive relative to the competing options.
00:17:14.822 - 00:17:36.720, Speaker A: And so for large companies where we've seen a lot of subnet adoption, it's not really that meaningful of an amount like for whatever business they're going to create. But if you're trying to create a startup you'd much prefer the variable cost that you could get with an L two over this higher fixed cost to actually launch a subnet. I don't know if that answers your question, but I wanted to make sure that was clear.
00:17:37.090 - 00:18:32.080, Speaker C: I would just add one part because I think in the question it's really like, what's the point of even pulling these validators? Kind of I think it's a great question. I think one of the reasons people get excited or like the idea of L two S is you don't have this bootstrap problem of creating your own network. One of the ways to alleviate that is to already have an existing validator set interested in validating other networks, right? So basically the primary network starts as this hub. All those validators are clearly interested in validating avalanche, and now there are ways to create interesting incentive mechanisms to get them to validate your subnet. So I think it's how do I pull validators to also validate my know sort of theory as well behind it?
00:18:33.670 - 00:18:46.714, Speaker D: That makes sense. God, I have so many follow up questions I'll ask. First one, Patrick, I'm actually curious. You called it AVAX.
00:18:46.782 - 00:18:48.034, Speaker A: I call it AVAX.
00:18:48.162 - 00:19:17.694, Speaker D: Just curious on the correct pronunciation. Two, while we're on the topic of validators and the coin itself, so the Ethereum community, or maybe the Ethereum Alliance community, let's say, is quite big on deflationary money, right, ultrasound money. And maybe Solana community isn't so big on it. It maybe cares more about, well, we actually just want businesses building on top and then they'll take care of the network. How does avalanche think of the AVAX coin and value cruel to the L one?
00:19:17.732 - 00:20:10.030, Speaker A: Token I'll touch on the first one, which is the joke I always tell people is I'm like English second language, but I don't have a first language, so I wouldn't really stick to my pronunciation or usage of any particular series of words on the fee mechanism. One, though, I'll let Luigi take the lead on that one. I think that's been something that he's been more, I think, touched with the community about my belief more. So obviously when you're talking about tokens, you got to preface it and say these are my views, not the views of anyone else or whatever. Right. I think I'm more aligned with the Solana way of thinking where fees to me are more about like a dos resistance mechanism and on a high throughput network, right. You want to try and minimize that fee to increase the amount of usage on the network.
00:20:10.030 - 00:20:55.280, Speaker A: The idea of trying to bake in some sort of deflationary scheme into the actual fee mechanism gets kind of weird, right. Because then as you try to increase throughput, the fee may not no longer be reflective of the actual load or the cost to actually process that amount of transaction load on the network. So I more am interested in saying set the minimum fee to whatever is required to prevent a dos on the network and then from there up it should just be market set based on load above what is the preferred target. So I take maybe a very reductionist engineering view of the situation. But let's see what Luigi has to say.
00:20:55.970 - 00:21:05.250, Speaker C: Yeah. So I call it AVAX. Everybody calls it AVAX. I don't know why. We're clearly crushing branding.
00:21:05.750 - 00:21:08.930, Speaker B: Luigi, do you say finance as well instead of finance?
00:21:09.350 - 00:21:11.300, Speaker C: I go back and forth with both.
00:21:11.910 - 00:21:14.450, Speaker A: I think the term is avalanche.
00:21:15.510 - 00:21:27.662, Speaker C: Well, we call it Avalabs instead of Avalabs. I think that's why stuck to me. I don't know, just AVAX sounds so like intrusive.
00:21:27.746 - 00:21:29.194, Speaker A: I don't know, don't love it.
00:21:29.312 - 00:22:01.886, Speaker C: But anyway, on this whole topic, I think it's funny in this space we go through cycles of thought. There are times when it's really great to think about tokens and tokenomics. There's times where it's like not cool at all. And I find that to be interesting. But when you're building crypto economic systems and blockchains, the economics do matter at some point. They don't only matter, but they do matter. So I would say aligned.
00:22:01.886 - 00:22:56.018, Speaker C: I'm clearly not aligned. I don't get those types of likes and tweets from the aligned community, but I'm clearly not aligned with the idea of how do we build the system to optimize just for value accrual. Because I think you're going to hit, basically going to hit a lot of inertia with people building on your system at a certain point. Like if it cost me like $30,000 a day east just to roll up to the L one every day, I don't know how long can I do that for. So there's generally like a balance there, but at the same time, these systems are proof of stake systems. The value of the network does actually play a key role. And if you want people to validate the network, they need to be profitable and they can't only be profitable by minting free tokens in inflation every year.
00:22:56.018 - 00:23:36.898, Speaker C: That's not sustainable. So you need to eventually have revenue for the network that can compensate for people running hardware. At the end of the day, there needs to be some margin there. I think it's going to look a lot like real estate one day where you're basically like renting a bunch of properties and there's some sort of cap rate that you generate. I think this will be sort of similar and it'll tend to move to a certain direction. Like avox in general, the value of Kroll is really in a few different ways. And this is not like any type of advice or legal advice or whatever, but basically the way it's currently designed is that the more subnets that you have, the more Avocs you lock up.
00:23:36.898 - 00:24:41.582, Speaker C: Because every single validator needs to stake that AVOC component validate a subnet so that ties down supply and then all fees basically on the private network are burned currently. So that reduces the supply of the token, which I think is similar to Salana in a lot of ways. But the way I kind of view it really is build value through these things. I think l ones and people having their own blockchains are actually going to be more common once we get regulatory certainty because the token and the value accrual to the token is actually quite an interesting mechanism you can design around. Like all these mechanisms were designed like five years ago and they're quite old, frankly, and need a refresh. But I do think there's going to be a time period where that's a great thing to do and will become pretty obvious, but we'll see. It's definitely an unpopular take.
00:24:41.736 - 00:25:09.950, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I love that take. I am curious. Luigi and Patrick so on this show, we do cover a lot of, you know, merts in the Solana ecosystem and a lot of people would call Solana Suey and some others like a next gen chain. And then you might hear some people actually say avalanche in some way is like a legacy chain even though it literally launched in 2020. So I would say it's hard to call that legacy. I'm curious how you'd answer that. So just from the economic side, I think you can point to a few things.
00:25:09.950 - 00:26:02.960, Speaker B: So AVAX or Avox has like a cap supply of 720,000,000, which it is interesting because you saw a lot of projects do this and it's hard with Immutability, but it's like, oh, we took what Bitcoin had and it was like a fixed supply and we're going to apply that here. And I think you could probably get onto Theorem community at like, look, they're really just taking from the Bitcoin community of having this low block space, low throughput and you can kind of see that in the economics of avalanche and some other ecosystems. And then also I think there's 100% of the fees are burned. So it's really hard when you're developing an ecosystem. But in crypto you're locked into what you made a decision on day one. But I'm curious also just on the software side, how would you describe to someone why avalanche is not a legacy chain? Like you're using the EVM, which some people are like, the EVM is out of date, but then you see somebody like Monad who's trying to bring parallel execution, isolated P markets. I'm just curious, what are you working on? How would you describe to someone that's like, avalanche is a little outdated at this point.
00:26:03.350 - 00:27:00.210, Speaker C: I'll jump in real quick and then let Patrick dive. But basically one way to think about it is all these next gen blockchains, they're like optimizing on the virtual machine front in a lot of ways. And basically what avalanche allows people to do is optimize on the virtual machine front for their own blockchain. So we kind of view it. We're providing this network of networks with the communication layer being, hey, you could validate yourself and I could validate seth and we could talk to each other with only our two validator sets involved. Right? So you kind of have this really clean communication sort of mechanism in a world where bridges are not still to be determined how successful. And ultimately what we want to do is allow people to let's say, for example, somebody has a specific use case and they want to use something like the SVM.
00:27:00.210 - 00:27:16.934, Speaker C: SVM is super optimized, but it's super optimized statement sheet. Maybe they want to tweak it in different ways. Maybe they want to optimize it for one specific type of use case. That's something that's where we are 100% focused, and that's where Patrick's time has basically been focused lately to talk about more.
00:27:17.132 - 00:27:22.678, Speaker B: Patrick, I have to ask a question since it's so relevant. This week, Rune made that post about forking the SVM into their own app chain.
00:27:22.774 - 00:27:24.698, Speaker C: How would you sorry for like, I.
00:27:24.704 - 00:27:37.978, Speaker B: Know I'm hijacking this question, but how would you go to Rune and be like, no, you should do this with avalanche, because if you can use that there, like, I assume the first pushback would be like, hey, I don't want to stake on the P chain. So how would you make that selling point to Rune?
00:27:38.074 - 00:28:44.158, Speaker A: So, as we alluded to earlier, that is one of the biggest concerns of people that are actually trying to launch their own sovereign chain is they feel like the existing fee mechanism to actually do that on avalanche makes it less than sovereign relative to what you could do otherwise. And I think that the big change once we actually have that capability is this native messaging out of the box. So a lot of the issues of that blog post that people call that were like, well, how do you bridge it back to Ethereum, right? It becomes this co processor. Now you have this trusted bridge somewhere between the SVM and the Ethereum world. And that is exactly the thing that Appalachian solves with warp messaging, which is like the native ability to actually message between them. I think there's a fair point there, which is to say, well, if you don't want the EVM and you want some alternative virtual machine that has higher throughput, we don't have a tested, battle tested solution that's been out for a few years in production that lets you achieve that. So his choice from that perspective on what actually exists, I don't think is that unreasonable for their given goals.
00:28:44.158 - 00:29:25.502, Speaker A: My job, hopefully, is to change that. When you talk about why is avalanche, it's a good question. Is avalanche considered legacy? And if so, why? And the point tied into Tokenomics is interesting. I actually think that a lot of these next gen chains take a similar view that I was expressing earlier around the fee mechanism, which is a lot of them are much more interested in just max throughput. As long as the fees pay above the Dos rate. And then don't make the validator margin based on fee collection, but rather make it based on inflation of the network. And that the hope is that the growth of the network surpasses the inflation rate.
00:29:25.502 - 00:30:32.434, Speaker A: I guess I think that's mostly how those are designed. I'm not going to touch more on the tokenomic side of it, but I will touch more on the engineering side of it, which is that there's definitely interest right, in saying, well, if you're going to differentiate yourself from the EVM, how are you going to do it? Is it going to be building a bigger ecosystem? Well, that's pretty challenging given that the EVM has been around for like a decade or almost a decade now and has all these built in tools. You're probably not going to win there, or if it is, it's going to be very expensive. So what else can you do? Well, you can just try to increase the throughput or make it possible to explore different areas of the crypto design space that you haven't been able to explore before because of the fee regime or because of the inherent technical limitations of the virtual machine you're using and so on. Avalanche, what we think we're really well positioned for in this world is fixed fee scaling for blockchain creators. So when you're talking about actually creating a blockchain and you want connectivity to a different ecosystem, almost every other aspect of that is a variable fee scaling. So if you want to launch an L2, you don't pay like one slot time to launch the L two and then you just get that throughput.
00:30:32.482 - 00:30:32.694, Speaker C: Right?
00:30:32.732 - 00:31:38.218, Speaker A: You pay it based on how much you do. If you actually want to be considered a true L2, if you want to use data availability, still you have to pay for the amount of actual space you're using. Avalanche was designed from the beginning to avoid this problem in particular, which is to say if you're doing massive scaling, you probably don't want to pay another ecosystem a variable rate of that amount of scale you're using. And so when people are talking about like, well, is the primary network considered legacy? I don't know if that's true. I think the idea of scaling the primary network on an EVM may be considered a legacy idea, but that was never the goal with Avalanche. The goal with Avalanche was let's build three different virtual machines, build a framework that sits beneath them so we can actually understand what VMs do in general and then expand that virtual machine interface to be useful, more generically to scale on subnets and then connect them via this messaging layer. So I think we could be considered legacy maybe from the perspective of thinking that we can't maintain one massive global state.
00:31:38.218 - 00:32:44.930, Speaker A: And I think that aptos and Sui have taken the approach know, we can scale out the Med Pool in some interesting and new ways. And as a result, we can achieve this crazy scaling by phased execution of different components and the way that we synchronize the Med Pool and actually maintain a global state with a throughput of like 150,000 TPS or whatever they're claiming these days. So our approach instead is to say, sure, but what if you want to go above that? What if we're talking about this massive world and you could say, well, the technology that we're building on will continue to increase in capacity, and then that will allow us to scale past that our view would say is great, now do that for every sub. Ed well, you can have ten of those now versus one. And we hope, and I think the big bet is to say warp messaging that allows you to communicate between these subnets will be seamless enough that it won't be too cumbersome. Now, you may disagree with that, or people may disagree with that as it becomes like managing a global state. And I think that's really the decision point for a lot of people.
00:32:45.080 - 00:33:13.450, Speaker D: You touched on L two S and maybe it's time to go a little into the state of Ethereum or maybe the EVM. Luigi, I mentioned Ethereum alignments earlier, and me and you both had a little chuckle. You guys have probably been criticized more than anyone I'm aware of in the EVM ecosystem from the EVM community. And to be completely honest, I'm not too sure why. I'm somewhat ignorant in this topic.
00:33:13.870 - 00:33:15.130, Speaker B: So I'm curious.
00:33:16.270 - 00:33:56.790, Speaker D: There's all these talks of Ethium alignments. The Ethiom Foundation had this saying on their website, which they actually removed recently, was that the only way to solve the blockchain trilemma is Via. If you firmly aligned on doing this, obviously you guys aren't doing this. And so I'm curious, what do you think about L two S in their current state and just the design philosophy of this L two S and the Op, like the super chain thesis polygon, and maybe they kind of took a shot at you guys with supernets in terms of the naming.
00:33:59.950 - 00:35:01.634, Speaker C: Yeah, I got you. Look, a lot of the core founding team and members of Avalanche are from the Ethereum ecosystem. That's where I started from the very beginning. We went to every Ethereum meetup back in Brooklyn in 20, 16, 17, was at those consensus warehouses. Emmon, who's obviously the founder of Avalabs, was famous for a lot of reasons for helping identify the Dow hack and Ethereum, and also writing the selfish mining paper with Bitcoin. He actually built an L two a long time ago, which is kind of interesting, but I think we've taken a pretty in the past aggressive approach in terms of calling out maybe some of the issues with L two S. And I don't think we were very liked for that, frankly.
00:35:01.634 - 00:36:06.706, Speaker C: And maybe we didn't have the best tone on actually handling that conversation. But I do think a lot of the points made were actually quite prescient in a lot of ways. Some of those points are simply like L two. Scaling, while I think can be interesting for certain use cases in particular, at least in my opinion, I'll speak to myself, it's not like the only way to scale, and it comes with certain limitations, right? So I don't fundamentally believe in a system that settles down to one system. I think that creates sort of like this house of cards and effectively creates a lot of concentration risk. Because if everybody's sort of selling to one entity or one chain, and that one chain, since it's less than a year old in terms of a proof of stake chain has any issues, then you can kind of run into some severe problems effectively. Like, the Internet isn't really built that way.
00:36:06.706 - 00:36:47.418, Speaker C: There's a lot more fault isolation in it. So from that perspective, I fundamentally just don't agree with that. The other thing is, I don't fundamentally agree with the fact that people will want to pay rent forever in perpetuity to one chain. Economically, I don't think that's necessarily a viable strategy for every entity. For example, if you want to build your own blockchain, let's just say you're cool with the app chain thesis. You want your own chain, you could do it as an L two, you could do it as a subnet. As a subnet, you're basically owning your own domain.
00:36:47.418 - 00:37:13.480, Speaker C: As an L two, you're basically renting your domain and you're sort of like, extracting your value out to somebody else in exchange for, I guess, alignment and security. And that's something that I don't think people really value in maybe five to ten years. So there's a lot of other things. But that's fundamentally some of the issues I have.
00:37:15.050 - 00:38:07.480, Speaker A: From a technical level. I'm super in on the idea that you can compress computation and reduce the load on the rest of the network doing so. Like, whether that be optimistic or whether that be ZK. I think we're more preferential to the ZK approach to that, which is yeah, if you can find a way to make ZK fast enough, then I think the architecture of Blockchains will be pretty redesigned. The producer will just actually generate this proof, or maybe some group of people will generate this proof, and the verification looks very different than it does today. Now, the concern, I think, comes down to this notion that I think the group thing that bothers me a bit is that the idea that you'd want to provide your own security makes you completely idiotic. Why the hell would you want to do that? And I had kind of like a Tweet thread queued up for this, and I was like.
00:38:09.930 - 00:38:13.080, Speaker C: Here we go again, here we go again.
00:38:14.810 - 00:38:41.794, Speaker A: I don't know. It hasn't been, like, a very fun or interesting conversation, because I think people are pretty set in their belief of what makes sense for them. But it's like the same sort of conversation to me just played out again with Ethereum. When it actually started versus Bitcoin, it was the same idea. It's like, well, why do you need another chain but just use Bitcoin? And then now Ethereum is saying the same thing. Why would you need another chain? Just use ethereum for everything. And it's the same notion, which is, well, you can't have your own community then.
00:38:41.794 - 00:39:07.130, Speaker A: And then the pitch is like, well, why would you want that? Just like, use the same community. We've already built a community. Use ours. Right. And it goes against the ethos of how humans build things, which is create a community. You need a community of people that are super excited about what you're building. And so for people getting started where they don't have maybe the budget to create a secure framework or bootstrap their own security, I totally get it.
00:39:07.130 - 00:39:33.474, Speaker A: If I'm a startup five people and I'm trying to create some new product, and my biggest blocker I need my own chain is actually convince people that's safe. I could understand why you would go the L2 route, but to say that providing your own security is not a way to build systems or solve the blockchain trilemma, I think, gets a little further than I would take that conclusion. That's all.
00:39:33.592 - 00:40:04.330, Speaker C: Yeah. The funny one I always say is if you think of a world in like Uber chain or Facebook chain or whatever, just like, let's pretend that we made. Like if we get to that reality, the idea in my mind that Uber chain or Facebook chain or whatever, these chains are going to pay rent to some exogenous chain and leak all that value is really, I think, a mistake. They will accrue that value to themselves and to their own community and network. At least that's my thesis.
00:40:05.330 - 00:40:39.446, Speaker A: I would like to say, though, just before we wrap up this topic, I think the Ethereum Foundation has done a great job of pushing really interesting research for the entire space that I think a lot of people have benefited from. And so I will say that I think that a lot of there are a number of research efforts they're currently pursuing and have worked on productionizing that I think have really made it easier to build your own blockchain or build your own ecosystem. So I do want to just give credit where credit's due at least. I've talked a lot to the Get team, at least, and I think they're very good. So it's been great to get to know them and learn from what they've figured out.
00:40:39.548 - 00:40:46.726, Speaker B: Yeah, me and Mert feel the same way. We often talk about, though, you hear people say there's going to be millions of app chains that come up or like roll ups, and maybe there will.
00:40:46.748 - 00:40:48.518, Speaker C: Be, but I think a lot of.
00:40:48.524 - 00:41:37.206, Speaker B: People just won't care if you launch an app. Like I was talking about D to c companies yesterday. Like, sure you can get off Amazon and launch your own store, but nobody's going to go visit it for the most part, if you're Apple, people will go to your website. So it makes sense, or somebody like dYdX, it makes sense to have your own app chain, right? You don't need to be composable with other chains. I am curious, how do you see the future of avalanche evolving? So right now you have the C chain where a lot of the DFI activity takes place. Then you have the subnets when you have new protocols or not protocols, when you have new projects and builders coming to avalanche. Do you think there will be this whole 1 million app chains or I should say subnets? Or do you think it's more likely that there might be a few sector specific subnets where everything aggregates? Because most things to me are power law outcomes with that? What's the future of the C chain?
00:41:37.318 - 00:41:39.078, Speaker C: Does that just go away if you're.
00:41:39.094 - 00:41:44.270, Speaker B: Successful because everyone's doing subnets and they're creating these sector specific communities. How do you see it evolving over time?
00:41:44.340 - 00:42:12.758, Speaker C: I think C chain is like our liquidity hub. It's where the most security is in the network. I think with warp messaging, as you sort of grow effectively all the subnets, they're going to leverage that liquidity. They're going to want to hop through it for communication. So I think that's just going to naturally sort of exist and persist. I have a view that you will have a lot of app chains. That's fundamentally a view, but I don't think people will be exposed to them though.
00:42:12.758 - 00:43:07.654, Speaker C: I don't think they'll know that they're there effectively. So I just kind of think that from the user perspective, they won't know if they're using Facebook Change or Twitter chain or whatever. What we're focused on is really the developer experience and customizing those chains. And then a lot of the conversation I have is around enterprise and institutional use cases for subnets and that's been a very big focus. Those entities want their own blockchains, then it's full stop and they want to be able to curate and sort of restrict the validator sets from different jurisdictions. They want to be able to have some control over the network in terms of like when I say control, what I mean is we want the validator set to be able to determine who can actually deploy a contract on the chain. We want all these different types of things.
00:43:07.654 - 00:43:27.306, Speaker C: So I think you're going to see a lot more on the institutional enterprise side when it comes to avalanche. We're very focused acutely there. And then for the builder market, I think there's things like the hypersdk, which Patrick could talk about, which is know, how do we give people the tools to build their own blockchains and customize them with high throughput?
00:43:27.338 - 00:44:39.430, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with your preface of the power law aspect of things, will there be a thousand really popular useful chains? Well, hopefully someday. But I think initially, I think Cosmos has talked about this at length actually is like the actual cost of building your own network and maintaining that and really fostering that community. It just takes a lot of energy and you need a lot of people to build those communities out. And so I think initially the community has to be self sustaining enough that it can incentivize its own growth really with this notion of their own staking token and everything like that. And so I think it'll be more of a walk and run situation. But I think that a lot of the communities will get bootstrapped from, as Luigi mentioned, the C chain kind of liquidity hub, which is you'll be able to basically take a Vox or any other token from the C chain and then bring it into your subnet natively with ward messaging which will allow people to pay tokens. You could have a subnet for example, that just pays tokens and fees and USDC if you want to dangerous to base the primary token of a subnet on a USC 20 that can lock funds and everything like that, but nonetheless it's possible similar with avalanche as the native token.
00:44:39.430 - 00:45:19.822, Speaker A: But I think that our view with warp is that it's not maybe the number of subnets that matter, which hopefully there will be a lot, but the thing that will matter is how connected they are. And we think that there will be high message throughput between different regions of state. And I think that's maybe one thing that we hold very true for the same reason that you'd want like one massive global state, right? Usually you have a blockchain to permissionlessly interact with other people and if you take away that aspect of things, it gets a lot less interesting, I think. And so the warp hopefully allows that, but on a very different kind of basis maybe you could argue.
00:45:19.886 - 00:45:59.066, Speaker D: So if I'm to somewhat summarize or distill your points or Patrick's early points about know if you're a startup, you can kind of understand why somebody would go the all tour route, but if you're like a big business like Uber or something, it makes much more sense probably, to go with something like Avalanche for your own blockchain. Would you say you guys are mostly focused and I think Luigi, you kind of said this was a big focus for you guys as well, but it seems like this is more of a b, two b play in terms of your go to market. First of all, would you say that's accurate? But second, I'm curious, what are some use cases you guys have seen so far that kind of excite you on avalanche?
00:45:59.178 - 00:46:45.118, Speaker A: I want to caveat the first point, which is I think that point I made is true with the current feed pricing mechanism of the chain, the hope is to make it more accessible to smaller companies that can't afford a large upfront commitment of capital. So the hope is to make it more accessible to that community. But I would say right now that the subnet trade off for that is a pricing that's really a factor above I think what you can get from a roll up to begin with. So I want to just caveat and say I think that's true now, but something that we're very interested in exploring to see how we can actually make it more appealing to startups. But alternative on the use cases front.
00:46:45.284 - 00:47:29.830, Speaker C: I would say like B to B is definitely a big focus. But as Patrick outlined, we are acutely focused on making subnets as accessible as possible to people because I think we've proved at this point they could be unleashed. People like them, they're stable, they work, they're customizable. So now we're going to get to a point where hopefully the community can figure out a way to actually make them more accessible. When that happens, it's not going to be just a B, two B conversation. We're going to want all people, startups builders, just tinkering to actually play around with the customizability of subnets. That's a lot of what the Hyper SDK is about and that movement.
00:47:29.830 - 00:48:09.258, Speaker C: On use cases, we've seen interesting things. A lot of them are to launch this year. But on the institutional side we've seen like we launched this first testnet which is basically in conjunction with Wellington, TRO, Wisdom Tree and other institutions. You're basically using DeFi for TradFi assets with KYC guarding of the chain. So that's a subnet. You're seeing people do different things like basically trading FX with concentrated liquidity order books. You're seeing sort of like collateralization of different type of TradFi assets and borrowing against it.
00:48:09.258 - 00:48:59.480, Speaker C: So basically that's mainly focused on how do we fix our really broken architecture in TradFi using some of these DeFi blocks. And then there's all these different types of gaming and enterprise use cases that are using Subnets. Like Godzilla is going to be an Xbox PlayStation game that has a Subnet in the back end for owning your own assets that should be launched I think sometime this quarter or next. There's like CSM you guys are probably pretty familiar with is launching their blitz app as a subnet which is going to be pretty cool loyalty points for gaming. So there's just like a lot of different use cases like that and those type of entities really want the ability to have their own state, at least in today's world.
00:48:59.850 - 00:50:05.100, Speaker A: The less technical view I have on this is more so I think a lot of people in the crypto space's hope is that most of what we'll call the state transitions or actual modifications to state that you interact with in your daily life happen in this open and verifiable way. And the hope with Subnets and avalanche is that it becomes the cloud of the beyond where you can launch whatever easy two or server back end you want to and doing that lets you actually process or power your application or whatever you're trying to do in really a very different way from that perspective. So similarly to launching your own server, you might have Windows, you might have Linux, you might have whatever other variant of Linux that suits you. And I think that if you wanted to wrap it up in a nutshell, it was a little less technical. It'd be the idea that you kind of deploy your own backend but on a blockchain. And if you're going to take that view, that deployment surface should be pretty flexible in terms of whatever you'd actually want to put there.
00:50:07.310 - 00:50:19.554, Speaker C: Actually, do you want to talk a little bit about the Hyper SDK, what we're building there? Because I think that shows, I guess really the route that we're going rather than us staying it.
00:50:19.592 - 00:51:25.714, Speaker A: I think this goes into the story and we brought up earlier around the EDM and what it means to avalanche and what it's meant right, it's definitely helped bootstrap the initial ecosystem of people actually using a framework they're familiar with. But I think I listened to the Monad podcast you guys did where they talked about they very much have to fit their optimizations in the box that allows EVM compatibility. So for example, I think there was a point made about Solana where it specifies kind of the state that it's going to touch ahead of time and the transaction formats are totally different. But in their model they have to maintain this STM software transactional memory model where they actually have to optimistically process things to try and achieve like parallelism. And I think that boils up to the single point, which is for a long time when people ask, even in this podcast we've been like submit to that you launch your own subnet, whatever. And the pitch being it's really exciting to launch your own chain. But when we had this kind of set of chains people could launch, usually it was just the EVM.
00:51:25.714 - 00:51:56.242, Speaker A: And so people are like, well, what else can you do? It's like, well, you could build your own blockchain or you can launch the EVM. And everyone just wanted to do the EVM for the same reasons they would launch the EVM now, which is like the ecosystem out of the box capability. So about a year ago, I had a hard look in the mirror. I was like, I'm telling everyone to launch their own blockchain. Is it actually that easy to launch? Build your own VM? And no it's not. Spoiler alert. And so I built a few of my own on top of avalanche and there's a lot of nuance to it to actually make it work well.
00:51:56.242 - 00:52:44.430, Speaker A: And so the vision here is that trying to create a framework that allows other people to actually launch high throughput chains and so the Hyper SDK is focused on that, which is like an EVM alternative. It has nothing to do with EVM whatsoever. It's all built from scratch for avalanche to achieve a much higher throughput, similar to what you would want to achieve on something like Solana or something like that. But if you wanted to build your own thing, you don't want to fork a whole chain itself. You want to typically have some sort of framework you can just import the pieces and use. And so it's built much more around that idea, which is maybe you want to achieve some sort of throughput, but you don't care about some stuff. You trust the framework to handle maybe the batch signature verification, right? You don't know what that is or care about why that exists.
00:52:44.430 - 00:53:16.978, Speaker A: It's just built based on that framework, which is that a lot of people want a much better or much different transaction or throughput per dollar ratio than what I think the EVM in its current form is willing to provide. There's very different trade offs with that. Like we mentioned at the very beginning, you are making a lot of trade offs by picking different aspects of the design space. But some people care only or exclusively about how to actually minimize the cost, both as an operator as well as for users.
00:53:17.154 - 00:53:34.590, Speaker B: Patrick it's a little bit more technical, but at a high level. I'm just curious, when you have these different VMs and something like avalanche, can they actually still communicate to each other? Or is it something like you have clusters? So let's just say you did have SVM virtual machines in avalanche. Are those really the only ones that can talk to each other? Could you somehow have an EVM talk to SVM and so forth?
00:53:34.930 - 00:54:18.974, Speaker A: It's the same kind of question of what IBT tries to provide for Cosmos, which is warp is just a bytes framework. So you basically just pass arbitrary bytes. And if you understand the bytes and I understand the bytes, we can communicate. But the warp framework itself is generic enough, which is just authorizing or verification of bytes. So what we haven't seen yet in the avalanche community really is someone to take the lead on a framework there that makes sense for avalanche. I think there's some groups that are working on like an IBC connector for some sort of subnet. But I think the you know, when I looked into know, they may say like I think is very focused on the Cosmos SDK with this notion of messages go to Routers and Hubs and app parts of the Cosmos SDK that make sense.
00:54:18.974 - 00:54:42.930, Speaker A: And it's pretty confusing to try and map that to a totally different world of VMs. And so we want to have a little bit lighter of a message passing framework. So I think initially the hybrid SDK will actually speak abi to communicate with the C chain is probably what will happen. But yeah, you have to agree on the message format for it to be compatible.
00:54:43.010 - 00:55:15.890, Speaker C: Just to be clear, we are seeing like there is some momentum, I think, on people exploring different virtual machines. On avalanche, we think there's a team building a move based subnet, obviously with hyper SDK and hypervms. Those are non EVM subnets. Be excited to see SVM subnet been trying to will it into existence. I don't know how many people on the planet understand the SVM enough. Maybe just Neil.
00:55:19.910 - 00:55:28.254, Speaker A: The one thing though the hyperck does not have it needs is like a helios like RPC system. It doesn't store any archival stuff.
00:55:28.312 - 00:55:30.710, Speaker C: This is the BD train in action, baby.
00:55:31.930 - 00:56:05.166, Speaker A: I think what you guys are doing is really interesting how you've extracted a bunch of the node out of the system and have based on actually more scalable hardware behind the scenes. The hyperscade is very much based on the idea that you as a validator you're not going to keep that on your disk, it's going to slow everything else down. Just get it out as fast as possible. And I think we're still looking for people to actually be on the other side of that. Get it out as fast as possible and turn it into like a queryable scalable RPC layer. So something that maybe I can convince you of at some point.
00:56:05.268 - 00:56:50.750, Speaker D: No, that's fun. I remember seeing the hypersca thing come out first and I read about a load and I was pretty excited about it. I think I actually tweeted about it, which is we actually might have met. So something that kind of piqued my interest there. Patrick, you mentioned just being able to deploy like in an Et two instance essentially, right? And we've touched on this word community quite frequently in this podcast. One thing that I always find interesting about Blockchains is that you would think that they're like purely technical things like cloud infrastructure, like AWS or something like that. But there's this weird, bizarre community aspect of it that I can't quite explain, which influences a lot more than it probably does in any other industry.
00:56:50.750 - 00:56:56.630, Speaker D: Avalanche maybe is known for the community putting the red triangles on their Twitter angles.
00:56:56.810 - 00:56:57.394, Speaker B: Right.
00:56:57.512 - 00:57:07.186, Speaker D: So all that is to say, how do you guys think about community in the context of Blockchains? How do you go about where avalanche's values may be or if you even believe that premise?
00:57:07.298 - 00:58:13.722, Speaker C: It's a tough question. It's a good one, right? I've sort of thought a lot about this as it relates to different ecosystems, because one thing that we like to do in this space very often is just put like three words on a chain or put three words on a community and be like, that's their stamp. There's many different elements of the ethereum community. You have the bankless side of it, which is like the value of ultra something money, and then you have the researcher community, which just doesn't. Care about that stuff at all and so it's interesting but at the end of the day, I guess they all do have some fundamental values that they care about. From what I've observed, I guess on avalanche in general, I found that our community tended to be folks that had a very deeper understanding of technology than sort of some of the others. And maybe that's why I always tell people nobody's better at funding avalanche than our own community.
00:58:13.722 - 00:59:16.734, Speaker C: We're pretty good at that because they're super technical and they're also quite I would just say we know the community is quite older than Solana. I would say the average age I found has tended to be an older person than somebody on Solana, hence been a little more technical. I would say like avalanche communities tended to be more infrastructure. Those are like the legacy ones. What I've seen sort of transition and we're starting to catch on a little bit more lately is sort of younger builders that are really interested in customizing things and that's been something especially on the university level, I've seen a lot of traction on as I sort of started to build out the Devrel team and stuff like that. So I didn't answer your question at all because I'm not part of the, I guess, right, triangle Illuminati. But it's a good one.
00:59:16.734 - 00:59:20.160, Speaker C: I really don't have a good answer for it. I'd be curious to hear your thoughts too.
00:59:22.610 - 01:00:45.594, Speaker A: I think with a lot of these communities they evolve over time and my view on it is we want to give each community building a subnet its own space to be a community. So this has been actually a conversation that's happened a lot lately with subnets that are launching is like they ask where they talk about how do we actually brand ourselves, right? Are we a one, are we part of avalanche? Because a lot of times when you say you're part of something else, people feel it diminishes your own standing. So a lot of subnets have actually started to brand themselves as just like their own blockchains that have a connection or powered by Atlet or something like that. And I think that's important to allow these communities to really have their own identity. The joke I always say is in my life I've never seen large groups of people agree on anything and I think that blockchain when everyone has arguably like a financial interest to not agree, I don't think this is the place where it's going to happen. We're going to achieve the singularity as a civilization and totally agree on everything. And so my approach to the community of the Avalanche is to try and hopefully be as neutral as possible, to just really the image I always show is like a hydra, which is you're trying to always learn from.
01:00:45.594 - 01:01:26.680, Speaker A: Everyone else that's kind of pushing the same journey and then trying to really just stay current and stay technically innovative on top of what everyone else is also working on. The whole point here is that we're almost too customizable to a fault. And I think that the flexibility is something that we're a little over flexible and I think we need to have a clear kind of push towards a single narrative because it gets tough to understand. People are like, well it's like this EVM thing. No, not quite. And it's like, well you're this subnet thing. Well, there's also a framing, there's a lot going on and I think that we should really try to push more clearly behind a single idea.
01:01:28.490 - 01:01:56.626, Speaker D: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I mean, my obviously incomplete perception of the community would probably be kind of lined with Luigi in the sense that it's more folks interested in infrastructure. I kind of just view it as more like b to B focus, like more enterprise, more professional. But then obviously I'm Turkish and so is imminent and there's like a pretty loud Turkish community. Probably very loud. Yeah, that's the one I see personally. But that's probably maybe not the case.
01:01:56.808 - 01:01:58.370, Speaker C: I didn't know you were Turkish.
01:01:59.030 - 01:02:12.600, Speaker D: Yeah, I tried to get him in to come on the podcast by replying to a comment Turkish, but it did not work. Next time do you want to do Rapid Fire?
01:02:13.050 - 01:02:24.086, Speaker B: Yeah, let's go into well, I just want to give my view of what was going on in Avalanche from an extremely retail person. That's me. So this is what I would think. The avalanche. I remember avalanche.
01:02:24.118 - 01:02:26.314, Speaker C: Rush. I believe it was right.
01:02:26.352 - 01:03:10.066, Speaker B: And this is what every single ecosystem was doing. When Avalanche first started, I don't know, it was probably a couple months into it. That's how you attracted a lot of new users and also projects. So that was when Avalanche first hit my Twitter feed and I started playing around there and you had like Trader Joe and other projects take off and it was really cool. And then I'd say the main narrative that's with me right now when I think about it is like tokenizing real world assets and some institutions coming on board. I forget if the partnerships with BlackRock or one of the big financial that's a really I don't know if you're leaning into that still, but I feel like it's a really interesting niche because I don't think anyone's really capitalized on that. Like you've seen MakerDAO kind of try to do this, but I don't know, I think honestly, Avalanche, that to me is what's so attractive.
01:03:10.066 - 01:03:36.494, Speaker B: It's like no one else is going after that. Also the subnets, I think it's interesting. I think Base little contrarian will probably be KYC eventually. And a lot of people hate that because it's an L two and it's role it's like why would you be an L two if it's going to be KYC? I think Avalanche has a permissionless nature to it. But you also allow permission subnets so that's also something that's really interesting to me as a user. And if crypto takes off, hopefully institutions that need to either do KYC or have something where it's just geographic. Right.
01:03:36.494 - 01:03:47.198, Speaker B: Because I think that's one cool thing about subnets to be like, all validators need to be in the US or Europe, et cetera, and you have a lot more flexibility. So, like a really high level, not technical view. That's what I find interesting about avalanche.
01:03:47.214 - 01:03:50.230, Speaker C: And what I think about might hire you for branding.
01:03:51.530 - 01:03:53.478, Speaker B: I applied for Avalanche role back in the day.
01:03:53.484 - 01:03:54.322, Speaker C: It was BD.
01:03:54.466 - 01:03:55.686, Speaker B: Did not get it.
01:03:55.868 - 01:03:57.062, Speaker C: You would have been on my team.
01:03:57.116 - 01:03:57.800, Speaker B: All right.
01:03:58.490 - 01:04:02.140, Speaker A: No, but that means you rejected him, right?
01:04:02.510 - 01:04:09.082, Speaker B: I didn't talk to Luigi. I don't know who I talked to. This is like May 2021. It was like things were popping, probably.
01:04:09.136 - 01:04:41.800, Speaker C: John. Yeah, I think you nailed it. I think the Rush program is something I was pretty involved in and helping Bootstrap. And then I think RWAs is like I have spent a mind numbing number of hours this year on the institutions. If I counted them up, I don't know, I'd probably throw up. But basically I've learned a lot about that. And I think we're not talking about it a lot, but incredibly well positioned on that front.
01:04:41.800 - 01:05:09.114, Speaker C: Just given the team, given sort of like the architecture and we understand it's a long sales cycle and sort of a very complex space to play. Yeah, you can customize validators by geographical location, but you could also customize them by whether or not they sign with you. It gets pretty complex in terms of what you can and can't do. And so we 100% will be leaning.
01:05:09.162 - 01:05:12.954, Speaker A: In and are leaning into that. Sure, that's definitely a focus.
01:05:13.092 - 01:05:17.246, Speaker C: I mean, the tagline is digitize the World's Assets.
01:05:17.438 - 01:05:33.158, Speaker D: All right, well, let's have some fun. We'll be doing rapid fire. We can go Luigi and then Patrick, in order for every question, and Garrett might jump in and ask one of.
01:05:33.164 - 01:05:33.990, Speaker A: His questions as well.
01:05:34.060 - 01:05:37.480, Speaker B: I was like, what are you going to say there, Mert? Are you going to say ask some stupid question?
01:05:38.830 - 01:05:50.570, Speaker D: I was looking for the word, like, just not out of the blue. I was going to say outside tangential. All right. What does everybody get wrong about avalanche?
01:05:51.710 - 01:05:53.498, Speaker C: That? It's an EVM clone.
01:05:53.594 - 01:06:17.800, Speaker A: That is exactly what I was going to say, that it is an EVM like chain. I think Steven one of the first engineers of the company that's, like, the tagline is that Avalanche go is like a fork of ethereum, which not it's like a framework for running virtual machines. So I'd say that I agree that EVM is what people knew us for. And so it's just rapid fire. I'm going to stop. Yeah, that's all.
01:06:20.170 - 01:06:23.030, Speaker D: What do you fear the most when it comes to avalanche?
01:06:24.970 - 01:06:33.358, Speaker C: Good question. I guess my biggest fear is that people won't want their own blockchain.
01:06:33.474 - 01:06:33.850, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:06:33.920 - 01:06:40.154, Speaker A: My fear is probably that the EVM ends up being like, the only EVM people want.
01:06:40.272 - 01:06:49.600, Speaker D: What is your least favorite vertical in crypto? Or what do you think is the most overrated vertical in Crypto? It might be a better way of phrasing that.
01:06:50.690 - 01:07:15.830, Speaker C: Oh, boy, I need to be careful here. I guess the most overrated vertical in my opinion is like, fuck it's. NFTs I have to say it not because they're not useful, but just yeah, this is so overhyped in my opinion.
01:07:17.210 - 01:07:56.680, Speaker A: Mine is actually maybe even a hover take than that, which is like, I actually think the tying of a lot of the real world aspect of assets and stuff like that to digitally things multiplies if you're not careful, the number of problems you have rather than a fully digitally native. So, like, I'm not from this world, so Luigi is. But the idea that, like, I can't tell you how many people coach me, someone that they don't know I want to tokenize property. Well, you got the land deed. Now you insure that, and then you have to work with the city, and now you're going to put, like, a blockchain on top of that.
01:07:57.130 - 01:08:00.200, Speaker C: Told you we're good at SPutting ourselves. Didn't I tell you?
01:08:02.730 - 01:08:04.194, Speaker A: I like more of the gaming.
01:08:04.322 - 01:08:07.250, Speaker D: Okay, so what is your favorite vertical in crypto?
01:08:07.330 - 01:08:08.806, Speaker A: I really like. Sorry, Luigi.
01:08:08.838 - 01:08:13.130, Speaker C: First, obviously, DeFi.
01:08:16.110 - 01:08:23.310, Speaker A: You can't see it behind me, but I actually have, like, a racing simulator rig I built behind me that I love video games.
01:08:25.010 - 01:08:30.590, Speaker D: Oh, nice. What is your most unpopular take in crypto?
01:08:31.010 - 01:08:38.580, Speaker A: My most unpopular take I have is like, there's other ways to scale blockchains than Lt that freaks people out these days for some reason.
01:08:40.310 - 01:09:03.766, Speaker C: All right, I guess right now my most popular take is that a token does matter. And it will matter right now. Maybe in like a year it won't be unpopular anymore when the market goes back up. But right now it's like, oh, dude, we're no token launching, man. All right, I've got one. But Patrick, this might be perfect for.
01:09:03.788 - 01:09:16.960, Speaker B: You, but would love to hear you Luigi as well. Okay, so you hear Avalanche talk a lot about the consensus mechanism. Like I mentioned earlier, it's extremely interesting, but I remember on Twitter, you see all the time, consensus is not the bottleneck. So how do you respond to that?
01:09:19.090 - 01:09:38.502, Speaker C: I'll start, consensus is not the only bottleneck is really the truth. The truth is that consensus is a bottleneck if you want super fast finality and high decentralization if you want those two properties, the current or existing consensus were bottlenecks for sure.
01:09:38.636 - 01:10:07.166, Speaker A: My view on that is consensus is still a bottleneck, but there are now more ways known to handle it such that it's not necessarily the differentiating feature it used to. So, like, obviously Ethereum has a lot of validators now. Same with Solana, same with a bunch of other right. So, like, it's still a bottleneck. They didn't just take what they had and just use. Right. Like, it was still something that took a lot of thought.
01:10:07.166 - 01:10:20.420, Speaker A: But I think that other ecosystems have done a lot more on consensus in the last few years that make it less differentiating. Right now, I think the bottleneck that's shared by everybody that is not well handled yet is definitely the state management story.
01:10:21.750 - 01:10:22.500, Speaker C: Nice.
01:10:22.870 - 01:10:24.626, Speaker A: If you weren't working on avalanche, what.
01:10:24.648 - 01:10:25.560, Speaker D: Would you be doing?
01:10:27.370 - 01:10:32.230, Speaker C: Shit, I ask myself this every day. In crypto?
01:10:32.970 - 01:10:34.920, Speaker B: No, just anything.
01:10:38.510 - 01:10:52.000, Speaker C: I'd probably be cooking something nice. I like to cook, but in crypto, if I wasn't working on an avalanche, I'd probably go build like something in the social fly states. I find that to be pretty interesting.
01:10:53.490 - 01:10:57.120, Speaker A: Mine would be building cars, I think.
01:10:58.290 - 01:10:58.814, Speaker D: Oh, nice.
01:10:58.852 - 01:11:34.140, Speaker A: Either like control systems for race cars or something along that line. I don't have any background in mechanical engineering or physics, and that is the real bottleneck for me in those areas. But I think the same sort of focus on high performance engineering where you have this time per lap, that's it. It doesn't matter what the fuck you do, you have one thing you're optimizing for. And cars have become so much more technical these days that I think it would be really challenging and competitive to do. I think it'd be pretty fun.
01:11:35.070 - 01:11:36.026, Speaker D: Big f one.
01:11:36.128 - 01:11:38.538, Speaker A: I take it. Nice.
01:11:38.624 - 01:11:39.260, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:11:41.230 - 01:11:49.450, Speaker A: I enjoy watching car racing going to I think it's the most like the biggest difference between TV and an event is racing.
01:11:49.530 - 01:11:49.774, Speaker C: Right?
01:11:49.812 - 01:12:07.422, Speaker A: Like, for a long time I was even remotely interested in racing, given I hadn't even been to something. And then you go to a race and it's just totally different. I watched a NASCAR race in person. I was like, round and really like the joke. Turn left like 100 times, whatever. You go to a real race. Pretty nuts.
01:12:07.422 - 01:12:16.280, Speaker A: These cars are full throttle and crashing into stuff at like 200 mph. Doesn't look that way on TV, but in person you're like, Holy shit, this is terrifying. Sorry.
01:12:18.270 - 01:12:25.530, Speaker D: All right, last one for me in five years. What do you hope avalanche looks like?
01:12:25.680 - 01:12:27.180, Speaker A: What is the ideal state?
01:12:28.110 - 01:12:52.290, Speaker C: Yeah, so for me, the goal is that people are seeing their own blockchains with toggle click feature requests that change basically the trade offs that they want to make. And it's similar to deploying your own AWS instance. That to me would be the dream goal.
01:12:55.850 - 01:13:12.700, Speaker A: To me, I think it's like the aggregate value of elastic subnets, which are the subnets where you have a staking token, like in aggregate maybe is at the level or exceeds that of avalanche as a whole would be really interesting.
01:13:14.190 - 01:13:15.322, Speaker C: It's a great answer.
01:13:15.456 - 01:13:33.214, Speaker B: Well, guys, Patrick, Luigi, thanks for coming on today. I'm excited to see the Hyper SDK and just what gets built out in avalanche. Also the RWAs. Like I said, I think super fascinating. Obviously a lot of tribalism in crypto, but it's nice to know every ecosystem has great people in the space and always working towards something interesting. So, guys, thanks so much for coming on. This is a fun time.
01:13:33.412 - 01:13:35.166, Speaker C: Awesome. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
01:13:35.188 - 01:13:36.398, Speaker A: Thanks for having us.
01:13:36.564 - 01:13:37.260, Speaker B: See you next time.
