00:00:00.160 - 00:00:28.697, Speaker A: The only thing that actually matters here is the use case. Are there going to be these use cases that actually leverage block space and actually give a shit about low latency and composability such that this is necessary? That's the most important question. The fire to answer thing is more like a future proofing the system. If something like this were to happen, can the network actually handle it elastically going forward or will it just fucking totally break, which Solana has done in the past such that this network is not viable for increased usage?
00:00:28.801 - 00:01:01.933, Speaker B: Listen y'all, we are just a few days away from Permissionless 3 in Salt Lake City.

Hello and welcome back to another episode of Lightspeed Your go to POD for all things Solana and Crypto. I'm your host Jack Kubenek, joined today by my co host Mert Mumtaz for a roundup Mert, how's it going, man?
00:02:15.545 - 00:02:17.121, Speaker A: Good, man. How you doing?
00:02:17.313 - 00:02:42.393, Speaker B: I'm doing well. I'm doing well. And you know, before we get into anything, I just wanted to recognize what is a huge career accomplishment for you. A big moment that happened this week. I was scrolling on the X feed and I noticed that you, Mert, have become crypto's number one kol, as measured by Kaito AI. So big congrats. This is obviously what it's all about.
00:02:42.393 - 00:02:45.385, Speaker B: And just want to recognize that line here on the podcast.
00:02:45.955 - 00:02:48.531, Speaker A: Yep. My father will be immensely proud of me.
00:02:48.563 - 00:02:57.219, Speaker B: I've just always been curious to ask you this, but do you ever get just like super sick of Twitter or do you. Do you actually like tweeting a ton?
00:02:57.347 - 00:03:28.917, Speaker A: I would say certainly I get sick of, or maybe not sick of, but impatient with very un nuanced takes on topics. I understand. And I'm kind of just like reading what they're writing. Like they'll write about like Solana Nose or something and I'll be like, I've been literally doing this for three years. Like, this is not correct in any way. I'm not sure why I have to now spend energy to rebuke this, but sometimes that happens. But, you know, gotta be done.
00:03:29.021 - 00:04:24.125, Speaker B: There's actually a lot to kind of go over this week with a lot of the announcements we saw at Breakpoint and so on, but I think I want to start just with, you know, the spicy stuff. So this week, Mert Edward Snowden did the most controversial thing he's ever done, and he called Solana centralized. And you took issue with this, Mert. So like, I guess my understanding of his critique is just kind of. He didn't really lay it out in a ton of detail, but he's one of the creators of zcash, which is this kind of private money, like private crypto focused, peer to peer cash thing. And he basically kept saying, like, Solana has levers that allow people to take from you. So like a nation state could censor you or things like that.
00:04:24.125 - 00:04:38.269, Speaker B: You came on and as you said, don't like unnuanced takes on Twitter. So you came on and were. Were tweeting back at him. Walk me through sort of your, your take on the, the Snowden centralization thing.
00:04:38.357 - 00:05:39.959, Speaker A: I listened to the little segment and it wasn't actually just centralization. It was kind of like, yeah, basically they optimized for centralization and then it's centralized and it's only good for scams and stuff like that. And you know, one of the things about this centralization argument in crypto is that it's become very religious and a topic of ideology in a sense, but it's actually just an objective measure, right? This is not something that is up for subjective interpretation. The decentralization of a system is determined by the system which is live and in production, right? It's an engineering system. It's like saying, my Ferrari is slow. It's like, okay, you can just drive the car and see if it actually is slow and you can see on the speedometer what speeds it can get up to, right? And then of course, there's other aspects to the car that affect this. It's not just the engine.
00:05:39.959 - 00:06:29.613, Speaker A: It's maybe the tires or the track conditions or even the legal conditions and where you're driving and all this, which is to say that it's a nuanced topic, but it's still objective. And so, I mean, I think I said something pretty simple. I said, he seems to think that it's centralized without providing any data. I challenge anyone to show me the single attack vector that would cause a central point of failure. And I was pretty disappointed with the responses because I didn't actually get any data or any coherent arguments. The, the response I got were almost all ideological in nature. Meaning something along the lines of, well, Solana has higher node requirements, right? Like it's harder for somebody to spin up a Solana node.
00:06:29.613 - 00:07:34.895, Speaker A: And it's like, yeah, that's correct. It's very obvious that it's harder because the requirements are higher as you can measure them by looking at the specs. That being said, the accessibility of node running is not the only thing that you can look at to determine if a network is centralized. You need to look at, first of all, how many nodes are live in production for that network. You can say they're theoretically high, and they are, but if there are 100,000 nodes, for example, on mainnet, and there aren't, but if there were, then that argument would hold no weight, right? Like it's. You can kind of lay out your theory, but if it doesn't match up with evidence observed from reality, then it's a bad theory. And I did like a series of posts and basically there is no single central point of failure on where you can, let's say, push Solana and just permanently break the system.
00:07:34.895 - 00:08:11.161, Speaker A: The only real attacks that you could do would be or central points of failure would have been a single client, right? There is one software that all the nodes run, and that's the Agave software. But that argument has gotten much weaker after obviously Jito went live. And Gito also does independent code reviews. And that's second client. It's mostly similar to Agave. But the point here is that there are multiple engineering core dev teams that look at the core code. Same with Fire Dancer.
00:08:11.161 - 00:08:47.235, Speaker A: Fire Dancer actually has already detected a bunch of bugs before they went into production or patched them. Frankendancer is also live on mainnet and then Fire Dancer is live in non voting mode on mainnet, meaning it still participates and does everything a node does. It just doesn't vote for consensus. And obviously there's Sig coming out, which is Seneca's new validator client. And there's also Mithril, which is a new home verify home verification node client. And so that argument is not. It doesn't seem very convincing to me.
00:08:47.235 - 00:09:26.775, Speaker A: And then you might look at, let's say the node count. And the node count is after Bitcoin and Ethereum is the second or it's the highest, right? It's thousands of nodes. Some are subsidized by delegation program. But we already did the analysis on this and wrote up an entire research report on what would happen if it was pulled. How many validators are profitable without it. And even in that case, it's hundreds of nodes, I think upwards of like 600. So then you look at that and then, you know, then people will start saying things like, well, they're only in data centers, right? And that's correct.
00:09:26.775 - 00:10:30.345, Speaker A: And but the key aspect here is it's not in one data center. It's in actually hundreds of data centers around the world in different jurisdictions, different geographies and different, let's say, governments as well. And so that is to say, the single point of failure here would be if somehow everyone on Earth coordinated to take down all the data centers that Solana operates out of. The probability of that is essentially zero, right? Like you would have to coordinate across all nations on Earth in a sense. But even if you were to do that, what would happen is you would cause a temporary liveness failure for the epoch, which would then be remedied in the next epoch. So this actually already happened. Hetzner, which was the biggest data center provider for Solana nodes back in the day, and roughly 20% of stake or something was running through it.
00:10:30.345 - 00:11:09.285, Speaker A: They just said they were going to ban Ethereum nodes, but they, they also banned Solana nodes and like a good amount of the stake one delinquent for a bit. But nothing happened to network because you can just move those keys around. And so the crux of the argument is kind of this, or maybe there's two sides. But one is you can say that Solana is like less decentralized than Ethereum, which would be objectively correct, but that doesn't imply that it's inherently centralized on its own rights. The analogy I give here is Usain Bolt is faster than LeBron James. Does not mean LeBron James is slow. Right.
00:11:09.285 - 00:11:53.281, Speaker A: It's. It's just a very weird fallacy and reasoning. And the second is like node requirements are one equation of what determines the whole decentralization of a network. But they're not the only thing. What's much more important are the incentives to run the nodes for that network. So if it costs you a million dollars, let's say, to run a node, but you make $5 million over the year from economic activity on the chain, because the chain actually scales to fit more activity, that might be worthwhile versus if your node costs $5,000, but you're actually losing money, let's say $1,000 per year, then why would you run that node? Right. Like, it's the incentives that actually matter.
00:11:53.281 - 00:12:20.147, Speaker A: Like, I can run a polkadot node right now. I'm not going to because I have no interest. I don't care about what happens there. I don't think it'll go up. I don't think there'll be economic activity. And so the people always mistake, perhaps on purpose on Twitter, the idea, the ideological basis for decentralization versus empirical decentralization. And so that's general.
00:12:20.147 - 00:12:21.955, Speaker A: That's kind of what I'm trying to get at.
00:12:22.075 - 00:12:30.115, Speaker B: In what sense is Ethereum more decentralized than Solana with that Usain Bold and LeBron James anecdote?
00:12:31.015 - 00:12:54.617, Speaker A: Well, it has more clients that are actually live in production today. And I think the split between them is relatively even. It wasn't always, but it now is. It has more nodes in general. Right. So, okay, why do you want lower hardware requirements? So that you can get more nodes. And so that's the purpose.
00:12:54.617 - 00:13:26.271, Speaker A: And there are more nodes on Ethereum than Solana. I think something like 8000 or something like that versus Solana is like roughly around 1500 in terms of validators. In terms of full nodes, it's actually like 4,000. But this is where comparing across chains becomes weird because they don't have the same terminology. And so it is more decentralized. And then in terms of also it's an older network, meaning that distribution has happened between stakeholders and early team members. And all Sorts of things over a longer time horizon already.
00:13:26.271 - 00:14:02.049, Speaker A: So the state concentration in terms of team and VCs and early insiders seems to be better, although you would have to check the numbers. I don't think it's all better though. Like, for example, coinbase holds roughly 12% of stake of Ethereum. That's 12% of the network on Solana, the biggest validator, which is like Helios and Galaxy, are 3%. And then if you actually add up all the centralized exchanges on Ethereum, it actually amounts to something like over 25% versus a lot of. It's not close to that. There are also other considerations, like delegation.
00:14:02.049 - 00:14:38.695, Speaker A: Right. Solana has delegation for stake built into the protocol, meaning you don't need centralized exchanges like Coinbase to take care of it for you and you don't need Lido. In fact, Lido tried coming on Solana and they left because they can find PMF because it already exists in the protocol itself. There are also other considerations, right? Like you need to put up the 32 ETH to actually start up the validator upfront versus on Solana. You just need to cover the voting costs, which is roughly 1 Sol per day. That being said, Ethereum is more decentralized. Also on a social layer, I would say it's more decentralized.
00:14:38.695 - 00:14:49.909, Speaker A: Like there's just more people, there's more ecosystems and more ecosystems doing different things versus Solana is a bit more cohesive. So, yeah, yeah, that's.
00:14:49.957 - 00:15:25.711, Speaker B: That's always. The interesting angle of decentralization to look at is sort of the social decentralization or like almost small p. Political. Like, you know, and you've. You and I have spoken about this before, but the sense that, you know, the Nakamoto coefficient is whatever number it is, but like, realistically you would need people to be colluding with one another. And so if everyone is like informally very friendly with each other and can work together, that's like a decentralization vector you can't really measure. It's more vibes based, I guess, but I don't know.
00:15:25.711 - 00:16:24.271, Speaker B: I think on the whole, my take on this Snowden situation is just that, you know, it was like an aside that he made. It seems like in a larger speech that very few people likely watched in its entirety. And he's like, he's the Z Cash guy who leaked all these documents and now had to seek asylum in Russia because he's has these very strong priors about privacy and what governments, like, can or may do. And so, you know, he's going to be. Not the type of, like, ideologically, of course he's going to split from Solana because Solana has more of a pragmatic bent. It has token extensions that allow for permanent delegate authority where you can like, freeze tokens, essentially. That's something I can't see Snowden being interested in.
00:16:24.271 - 00:16:27.887, Speaker B: But, like, of course he's not. And I don't know.
00:16:27.951 - 00:16:48.333, Speaker A: One thing that's worth adding as well is like, Zuko, who's the actual creator of zcash, who I'm pretty good friends with actually. We talk quite frequently. He's also good friends. Anatoly. He would not consider Solana centralized. Like, there's no way. Just if you ever actually talk to him.
00:16:48.333 - 00:17:44.311, Speaker A: And like, zcash is technically more centralized than Solana on a relative basis, like just by node counts and kind of the design. That's not to say zcash is centralized though, because it's not. In fact, I use it and I wouldn't use it if I thought it could fail in some centralized fashion. And so, like Snowden, one of the things that also bothers me about this whole thing is like, people kind of just take Snowden's word for it because he's now this huge figure that is famous for like, leaking these documents and stuff. And like, you know, I don't have any opinions on that. But, like, this does not make him an authority on the Solana network and how the nodes and the data and all that. Like, he hasn't done the work to have an opinion there, which is, you know, it's kind of like this thing where like, actors start weighing in on politics or something, where it's like, okay, yeah, like, you have a platform and so you can say things and people will believe you.
00:17:44.311 - 00:18:01.675, Speaker A: But have you actually done the work here to understand what's happening? Which is why I said, hey, let's debate. Show me the data. I'll gladly be proven wrong if you can show me it. I'd be very surprised if I missed something in all these years, but, you know, just put it to the test.
00:18:02.015 - 00:18:19.125, Speaker B: Well, I think we've covered the ad issue pretty well, but yeah, it's been. I don't know, it's been like a weird. There was also this Sriram stuff that. That we won't get into, but it seems like it was a big week for soul versus Eth. Other ecosystems debates.
00:18:19.545 - 00:18:28.801, Speaker A: We should. We should get into that. I think. I thought that was interesting. I believe it was in response to, like, Kyle. Oh, no. Okay.
00:18:28.801 - 00:19:00.467, Speaker A: I think basically here's what happened. I think Dave from Bankless tweeted something about like, you know, decentralizing later or something is like not the way or something like that. Like it was something along those lines. And Kyle Samani was like, that's all L2s. And he's of course correct. And then Sriram seems. And then I believe David responded back with like, Solana is not really doing Defi, which seems weird to me because it's okay.
00:19:00.467 - 00:19:31.983, Speaker A: And then I think Kyle responded with something like real time price, discovery or something for Defi is like the ideal playground. Which is akin to what generally totally says about like a state machine being ideal for Defi. And then I think Stream Quote tweeted that and said three things. He said something like, it will never be nasdaq. Something about it will never be like programmable compute. And I think three something about verification.
00:19:32.159 - 00:19:34.395, Speaker B: It won't be as verifiable as Bitcoin.
00:19:35.015 - 00:20:05.065, Speaker A: Yes, I think those were the three. You can check me on that if I'm incorrect. But I mean, I responded and it's just like people are kind of just talking over each other as opposed to tackling any coherent points. Like NASDAQ is just a slogan. Like, the actual goal isn't to replace or isn't to be as performant as Nasdaq. It's just to be the most performant L1. Now, if that actually ends up becoming a competitor Nasdaq, great.
00:20:05.065 - 00:20:29.921, Speaker A: But like, Solana will never be faster. Nasdaq, therefore it's bad, is like a really weird thing as a slogan. It's like saying like, I think eigenlayers was like build anything. And it's like, so you want me to just go ahead and say, okay, well, people haven't built absolutely everything possible here, therefore you can't build anything. Therefore Eigen layer sucks. That's just not a way of thinking that's realistic.
00:20:29.993 - 00:20:41.245, Speaker B: You have thoughts on Toly's whole thing about if a news event happens in Singapore and you have multiple concurrent proposers, but there's one in Singapore, it's faster than Nasdaq, essentially.
00:20:44.745 - 00:21:19.645, Speaker A: I am not fully convinced of that. I also haven't dug deep into all the mechanism design there to really weigh in. I think some people agree with this, some people don't. So I don't. I'm not fully convinced. But I do think it's still a good design in some cases. And the second thing he said was like, it won't be like programmable compute or something like that, which that is just a Weird thing to say because it's just an L1, just like any other L1 that's Turing complete.
00:21:19.645 - 00:22:00.607, Speaker A: You write some code, you deploy it on the smart contracts, and it does escape transitions. All blockchains are the same in this way, except for Bitcoin and whatever is not Turing complete. So that actually makes no sense. Maybe that's just like a weird semantics thing that he's trying to do there, but it's not correct. And the third is the verifiability thing, which is that it'll never be as verifiable as Bitcoin. And it's like, that's probably correct, but that's not to say it won't be verifiable. I was just about Mithril, which is a home verification client, and so I can kind of see what he's trying to get at.
00:22:00.607 - 00:22:35.085, Speaker A: But then he presents Eigenlayer as the antidote to all these things, but then only lists out the good parts of Eigenlayer and then does not cover any downsides of Eigen layer in any way. And so it's like, here's why your solution is awful in every way. And then here's why my solution is great in every way. And then I think actually Mustafa called him out, who's the founder of Celestia. A few days later he said he got sick of like Eigen people reply guying all Celestia posts or something. Maybe he said like, yeah, well, you don't have this, you don't have that, you don't have this, you don't have this, et cetera. And then he kind of like picked it apart and he knows this much better than I do.
00:22:35.085 - 00:23:21.095, Speaker A: And then that was also followed by like Sriram comparing Arbitrum's latency to Solana's latency. I think he said something like, well, Arbitrum is already lower latency than Solana, and of course that's just a category error. Like it's an L2. Obviously it's not an L1. And then I replied with saying, well, actually if you wanted the exact same behavior on Solana, you would look at the similar comparison, which is something like GetCode, which is a state channel or quasi L2. And it also gives you instant confirmations, right? So you can't. And this led to another tweet, I think maybe the day after by me, which is like, people are starting to compare Stelana to entire architectures consisting of L1s, L2s, and DA layers.
00:23:21.095 - 00:23:49.275, Speaker A: And it's like, I understand why they're doing that because that's like the only way they can kind of get close to the properties of Solana. But that's a false comparison because Solana is just an L1. You can also build L2s or other sorts of layers on top of it to, you know, arrive at the characteristics you're looking to arrive at. And so just a lot of nuance gets missed here. And so just wanted to give my 2 cents.
00:23:49.435 - 00:24:15.393, Speaker B: The SEI network brought parallel execution to the EVM with their V2 update this past spring. Subsecond finality and massive throughput are now available to EVM developers everywhere on SEI's high performance layer. 1. Incentives for users are coming to SEI this month from teams like DragonSwap. Start farming on SEI today by visiting DragonSwap app. That's DragonSwap app. Thanks again to SEI for sponsoring today's episode.
00:24:15.393 - 00:25:34.315, Speaker B: It's been a lot to keep up with I think too it's been interesting seeing like a lot of the kind of the Mega Eats or the Monads of the world joining the kind of like collective debate that maybe kicked off after break point. And I think one of the powder kegs for that with arguments about how performance Lana is relative to L2s or maybe relative to some of the Alt L1s that are in production was the announcement of Fire Dancer, which I want to get into with you because Fire Dancer I think was maybe the most important thing to be announced at Breakpoint. I can't think of a more like consequential one, at least for Solana. The Seeker was obviously interesting, but Fire Dancer is this independently developed validator client by Jump. It's written in C rather than rust. And so kind of the idea as you alluded to earlier, Mert, but once that comes online it really takes out like a liveness risk that Solana would have where even if something, you know, catastrophic happens with the Anza and Jito version of the Solana client, you can get, you can keep the network running via Fire Dancer. Currently the Frankendancer is online to my understanding, in non voting mode.
00:25:34.315 - 00:25:46.267, Speaker B: So it's sort of a half Fire Dancer, half Anza client and then the, the full, the full hog. The full Fire Dancer is live on testnet, which is all an update.
00:25:46.331 - 00:25:53.535, Speaker A: So Frankendancer is live on Mainnet in full. Fire Dancer is also live on mainnet but in non voting mode.
00:25:53.835 - 00:26:18.235, Speaker B: Okay, okay. So like we can get into lots of stuff here. One thing, one place that I wanted to start, Murray, that I thought was interesting was something you talked about, I don't think I saw other people talking about is that Fire Dancer is introducing a new fiber layer for the Internet as like in addition to just building a validator client. I wanted to just unpack with you what that means.
00:26:19.735 - 00:27:08.141, Speaker A: So yeah, it's not Fire Dancer. It's a different team that might work with Fire Dancer and probably will. And there's not too much information on this. It's relatively, I don't want to say confidential, but certainly not publicized very much. It was on the demo days. But basically one of the things you start to realize as you build these systems like super high performance blockchains, let's say, is that at some point the Internet becomes a bottleneck. And what I mean by that is so for example, if somebody in Brazil sends like a transaction or a packet, let's say to somebody in Tokyo, you would, if you look at a map, you would imagine that that just goes straight to Brazil or something like that'd be the shortest path to be very quick.
00:27:08.141 - 00:28:05.245, Speaker A: But actually what happens due to the incentives of Internet service providers, which is actually not to improve speeds of the Internet. This is bizarre concept, but what ends up happening is actually it goes from Brazil all the way to the eastern end of the United States and then it zigzags its way through the United States, through all these random paths, goes to like outside of Japan and then goes through some other places and then lanes in Tokyo. And it's just like a super inefficient route. And so this team is basically saying like okay, we should just lay they already have a network. The team behind it has already actually set up Fiber networks for Web2 or general Internet stuff and telecom networks. So they're a very, very good team. And they're basically saying, okay, well what we're going to do is we're going to actually improve some of these fiber networks themselves, either by laying better fiber or more efficient fiber or by incentivizing people to provide bandwidth, like more efficient bandwidth.
00:28:05.245 - 00:28:47.005, Speaker A: And they also have some other things, like they have a new hardware component that you can add to some of these data center networks that will actually do some Solana specific stuff like de duping transactions. Because if there's spam and thousands of the same transaction, this will actually dedupit before it even gets to the validator or like verifying signatures, which is like an expensive task. So it can do all these kinds of things. So it's like a more programmable but also faster Internet. And it's unclear exactly what the details will look like. But I shot with this team quite a bit and it's probably the most impressive projects I've seen in crypto. And it's also not even specific to crypto.
00:28:47.005 - 00:29:30.325, Speaker A: Like people without. It's. You can maybe liken it to helium, which is like, yeah, it uses crypto to provide like mobile coverage, but it's not specific to crypto. People like people in Miami can just use this even if they have nothing to do with crypto. It's kind of the same idea here because like these quants, like, you know, the HFT firms of the world, they don't really use the regular Internet, they use very hyper optimized fiber networks so that they are actually landing these trades and capturing market arbitrages and all this stuff. So I think this is actually the most impressive project in crypto that I've seen. Maybe more than Firedancer even because I think the scope is much bigger.
00:29:30.325 - 00:29:33.055, Speaker A: But like they're both very cool.
00:29:34.115 - 00:30:01.965, Speaker B: Something I've never seen a good answer for that I'm curious about is what is the business case for JUMP crypto to build Fire Dancer in the first place? Like it seems like a huge amount of engineering resources. I don't know about huge. I don't know how many people there are working on it. But like why does it benefit jump, which is like an HFT trading firm, to my understanding, from a business perspective to put this much time to develop Fire Dancer?
00:30:05.305 - 00:30:45.853, Speaker A: I think there's a few things for it. So there's quite a few teams that spin out of jump. So like PITH or Wormhole and like JUMP actually like obviously is an investor in those companies and so getting those companies to perform better is going to be just better for their investments. And JUMP also has other crypto investments. They also did receive, I believe a pretty large grant for doing this work. But then also I think there's. If you have the thesis that let's say HFT or Global Finance will come on chain, you want to be the one pioneering that so you can understand it.
00:30:45.853 - 00:31:15.129, Speaker A: You can have the in house expertise of how these systems work and some skin in the game and all this such that if this transition does happen, then you are the market leader. Right. So it's also kind of like more of an R and D effort. I mean, I'm speculating here. Obviously I'm not the founder of JUMP or the project leads. I don't know exactly. People do also have some weird conspiracy theories around this which is around like MEV or Something, but that's actually totally midwit.
00:31:15.129 - 00:32:13.545, Speaker A: Like that's a super stupid take because JUMP is one of the most regulated entities on earth because they don't just do crypto, they do all markets including everything that the SEC has an as a hand on. But like rubber there, you know, anything, any market you can think of jumps right in IT trading. And so they're super regulated. And so if they were to do some illegal stuff which some jurisdictions consider illegal, like mev, they would instantly get destroyed. And because they really need the SEC to work with them for all these other markets which are the majority of their business. And so I think like it's actually just a very simple R and D model where if finance is going to become on chain then they should be leading the way. And then obviously venture investments as well as grants as well as like there's other teams that could come out of Jump that they could incubate, etc.
00:32:13.545 - 00:32:49.995, Speaker A: And so it's just to be like that. The leader of technology, I have met the founder, he's also like a super libertarian type. Like he generally believes in crypto and really believes in the ideals. And so I think there's, you know, if I just speaking as a founder, there's probably some of that as well because it's not like he needs the money extremely rich obviously. And so at some point it also becomes more purpose driven which is like we just think finance would function better on chain versus like this weird political structure that exists today. So that's my speculation.
00:32:50.115 - 00:33:36.451, Speaker B: Another thing I've been interested to chat with you about is, you know, 1 million transactions per second gets thrown out there a lot in regards to Fire Dancer. I think because it's a, it's a sexy like whole number to think about. In reality, who knows like what the tps that Fire answer will hit will be. But I guess just like from a pragmatic level like Solana non vote uses, I think between 500 and 1000 tps. Most times with vote transactions it's like 3000 maybe. I don't know if that's exactly right, but it's in the order of like a couple of thousand. So even if Fire dancer scales to 100,000 TPS, that's like far beyond the demand for block space right now.
00:33:36.451 - 00:33:57.105, Speaker B: Right. So is the idea that you're sort of building Fire Dancer and then in the future as more value comes on chain, you'll just be able to meet the demand for all of those like all of that block space with transactions per second or how much does like the increase in TPS actually matter right now? I guess I should ask.
00:33:58.365 - 00:34:43.874, Speaker A: Yeah, it's actually. If you look at Kevin Bowers's Breakpoint, talk about Fire Dancer, he actually kind of mentions this, which is the. I think he gives the analogy of like a sports car and like a very busy highway. And it's like it can go really fast, but at some point it becomes a function of demand versus where you actually need people to utilize this block space and perhaps use the right tooling to. So here's an example. The way Solana blocks get filled is via something called compute units. So like if I send you a transfer right now, that'll be like a very small amount of compute units, but if I do like a swap involving like 18 markets or something, that'll be a higher number.
00:34:43.874 - 00:35:27.339, Speaker A: And so those transactions are not equal, but they're in a TPS setting. They're considered equal because they're a transaction transaction. And so there's a factor to this where what you need to actually start doing is reducing the compute units consumed by the programs or the transactions. And so TPS can go up that way as well. So for example, Solana generally hovers around something like 700 non vote TPS, but that's just the average during different compositions of compute units, it's actually broken 3000 non vote TPS. Right. And that is to say TPS is a function of demand compute units and then obviously block space.
00:35:27.339 - 00:36:20.275, Speaker A: But it's not determined entirely by one of those things. I think that there's like the concept of induced demand which is, okay, now that there is much more space and people can play around more, maybe they'll just start putting more stuff on chain that they couldn't before. Now will they have a reason to? It's unclear. But I think the interesting thing about these things is that they're like kind of creative endeavors in that once the playground becomes more available, there is this expansion phase of like people noticing it and understanding it. There's like a lag, right? They're like, okay, well oh actually I can do this now. And it doesn't stop me at 700 TPS. And so now you can start doing more and more activities.
00:36:20.275 - 00:36:47.905, Speaker A: And like this is also what some of these other like Alt L1s get wrong. And what they'll do is like they'll benchmark on mainnets with like a super highly controlled program or something. They'd be like, oh, we just broke the TPS record. We just did 5,000 TPS. But then once that goes away. The TPS is like 10 because it's a function of our developers actually using this block space. And so, yeah, I mean, the most fundamental thing is our developers using it.
00:36:47.905 - 00:37:35.075, Speaker A: Which comes back to my spiel, which I repeat frequently. It's like the only thing that actually matters here is the use case. Are there going to be these use cases that actually leverage block space and actually give a shit about low latency and composability such that this is necessary? Okay, that's the most important question. The Fire to answer thing is more like a. It's. It's like a future proofing the system, right? Which is to say that, okay, if something like this were to happen, can the network actually handle it elastically going forward or will it just fucking totally break, which Solana has done in the past, such that this network is not viable for increased usage. So that's remains to be seen.
00:37:36.375 - 00:38:01.405, Speaker B: And there's this secondary vector of performance which is latency. Right. So like how quickly does the block get built and broadcast to the network on Solana, that's 400 milliseconds, I believe is the block time like, but that's different from tps. So do you think that latency needs to improve as well? And how does that happen separately from Fire Dancer?
00:38:02.985 - 00:38:50.955, Speaker A: Well, yeah, I mean, shorter block times are certainly preferable and Totally wrote a blog post about Solana's endgame a while ago in which he proposes that we should go down to roughly 120 millisecond block times. So roughly a 4x improvement in latency. And assuming you have multiple concurrent proposers all over the globe, then the user to the leader latency is actually much reduced because currently, here's a simple way to think about it. Imagine the globe. There's one leader any given time, and no matter where you are in the world, you have to travel to that leader. Your transactions do. But if you have multiple concurrent leaders, then the distance that your packets have to travel to the leader is much shorter and so you get a better latency.
00:38:50.955 - 00:39:37.165, Speaker A: And so latency is also a very big one. And in terms of how Fire aims to solve that, I haven't seen. Well, I mean, there's a few things because like Firedancer is also doing other things like defining a formal spec. And once you have that, and once you've actually reworked the networking layer, you can start to understand where the bottlenecks are and kind of go from there. So engineering is a very iterative process, right? Like you didn't just get from the first model t Ford to F1 cars, it kind of needs to play that out, which I think Solana excels at, which is the iterative engineering model, sometimes to its detriment, but generally over a long time period, that's how engineering works and it's always how it's worked.
00:39:38.065 - 00:40:02.345, Speaker B: And then maybe the final thing to pick your brain on is like, say Fire Dancer comes on like fully on mainnet with participating in consensus and these types of things. Does that look different from a consumer point of view? Like, would. Would me doing my swap on Jupiter notice a difference once there's a full Fire Dancer node? Or is it more something that's going to be fully in the back end?
00:40:05.405 - 00:41:26.035, Speaker A: So this would depend pretty heavily on that lag phase that I mentioned, which is it won't happen instantly because first of all, a certain percent of the network has to upgrade to it, a certain percent of the stake has to upgrade to it. And then you need to identify, okay, well, are we going to run both these clients on mainnet or are we going to run one main one and then one primary fallback one? And once you start doing that, then you need to look at Jupiter's developers, for example, are they going to actually try to optimize for Friday answers new software? And they probably will, but it's like, when will they do that? Generally with infrastructure, what you want is you want to optimize for being boring. Meaning we are talking right now and we're not commenting on the Internet speed because the Internet speed just works and that's how it should be. It should be the same with Fire Dancer, meaning that once it's like live and everything is upgraded properly, you should just never really comment on Solana's network because it should just be in the background. It should just be boring. Your transactions shouldn't fail, you shouldn't have a reason to have any failures, you shouldn't have any technical issues or anything like that. And then you just want to get to a state where the only thing that matters are the quality apps on top of the network.
00:41:26.035 - 00:41:55.885, Speaker A: And so I think that'll be. And then there's also some component to this which is it'll help application developers actually focus more on their apps and hence built better apps, because they won't have to worry about the weird technical issues that they might have seen from Slana in the past. But again, the important thing to understand there is that that can't by definition be an overnight thing. There's this lag phase where people actually have to upgrade and this needs to propagate for some time.
00:41:56.795 - 00:42:42.053, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And I like the point there, especially about use cases because I think that Fire Dancer has long been talked about in this kind of mythical way with people I'll talk to in Solana where it's like, well man, like once Fire Dancer comes online, like that's going to be super bullish for the soul. Price usually is the context. And I think that there's a question of like, okay, you can build this thing, but now like, what's the point? Like, great, you can do a million tps, but is the block space going to fill? But it's, it's really cool to see Fire Dancer come along because it's been talked about in a very abstract way for some time. But now with some of this stuff getting into the wild, I'm just excited to see kind of what becomes of it.
00:42:42.109 - 00:44:04.849, Speaker A: I would also say from a competitive point of view is something that investors look at, which is to say that the thesis before which I think is false, is that okay, like a single L1 cannot scale to anything significant in terms of scale, right? They'll say something like, well, Solana does 2k TPS, but then like L2s if you just add a bunch of them or something, can do more TPS overall. But then now with Fireness, you can do 1 million TPS, then it starts to bring in the question, why are all these other scaling solutions necessary? Are they actually going to be a 10x improvement over Solana, even a 2x or even any improvement at all? And then that's actually. This also comes back to me shilling myself, which is my argument's always been the use case, right? Perhaps a million TPS is useless for you because you have a custom need for or for sovereign block space, right? Maybe you're like a small game and it's like, I don't give a shit if there's a global state machine here. I just want to build a small little game and it just needs to talk to a small roll up and that's it. And that's what actually matters. Because the thesis that like a single L1 cannot scale will be proven wrong. Just that's not even like a strong claim because it's just kind of basic physics.
00:44:04.849 - 00:44:46.809, Speaker A: Like these things will start improving more and more. And what you're basically saying is there'll be so much more demand that a single L1 doing a million TPS will not be able to handle it. But then I'm not sure how you can make that claim if you look at production today. And I think the entirety of L2 is combined is still below 1000 DPS. Like, so it's like, where will this demand come from? Exactly. And which is the use cases? And so what you should be focusing on are the use cases. And then once you focus on the use case, then you can ask, okay, does this suit an L1 or does it suit a custom block space like an app chain or an L2? Right.
00:44:46.809 - 00:44:50.245, Speaker A: That's fundamentally what matters. Working backwards in the use case.
00:44:50.545 - 00:45:27.305, Speaker B: Yes. Yeah. And always having the use cases. The North Star is good, I think. I think one of my complaints recently has been crypto feels a little less interested in explaining itself sometimes because it can get very inside baseball. But always thinking like, okay, at some level this is a thing that people or entities use needs to be the guiding light for blockchains. Okay, another one that I threw on here that's a little out of left field, Mert, is that CZ got out of prison this week throwing up our fours for the Binance CEO.
00:45:27.305 - 00:46:12.381, Speaker B: Yeah. Obviously was indicted on charges related to sort of Binance's operations in the us we're not going to dive into all of that. But he got out of prison. He's able to eat more than one piece of fruit a day now. And he's working on Giggle Academy, which is just an awesome name for his school initiative. And he's also writing a book and taking some time before doing other crypto stuff. Now there's only so much you can say about CZ getting out of prison, but the reason I want to bring this up, Mert, is it got me thinking about what we used to call kind of crypto's main character syndrome.
00:46:12.381 - 00:46:38.471, Speaker B: So I remember in like November of 2022, I was an intern at Blockworks and they. The bull mar. Excuse me, the bear market turned one. It was like one year since the prices all peaked in November 2021. And I kind of wrote about all of the main characters that had come to define crypto. Do Kwon, sbf, cz. I'm sure there's others that are slipping my mind right now.
00:46:38.471 - 00:47:17.355, Speaker B: Brian Armstrong has never really been that, but I guess you could throw him in that category. And that was always one of the fun things about covering crypto is it was the sector that's run by these like 29 year old Wunderkins who have really like crazy personalities and are tweeting all the time. As I look around now, it's hard to actually point out who the main characters are. And so as the number one Kol Mert. I wanted to ask you, like, has crypto gotten over this main character syndrome, or are we in between the identification of main characters? Like, what's kind of your thought there?
00:47:19.545 - 00:47:57.555, Speaker A: I. I don't think it's gotten over them because I don't think it's a crypto specific thing. I think it's just a human condition thing. You know, you can just look at outside of crypto, there's obviously Elon, you know, Palmer, Lucky, Steve Jobs, Zuck. I mean, Zuck is really doing a moment right now, right? Yeah. The founder of, like, Salesforce, like Marc Benioff, Larry Ellison, people. Or you can actually take it to other levels and go to countries like Lee Kuan Yew or something from Singapore, Trump, obviously, Putin, Erdogan, like this.
00:47:57.555 - 00:48:34.185, Speaker A: It's just people like symbols for things. And it's a very simplified way of thinking about it. Like, hey, this person represents all of this. And so it's a good meme or compression way of communicating ideas. Obviously it's not perfect and generally messes up a lot, but I don't think it ever goes away, like, ever, because it hasn't. This is one of the few things that's actually Lindy in the world. Looking up to kind of these leaders has been a thing since day one of Earth, really, or civilization, let's say, not Earth.
00:48:34.185 - 00:49:22.649, Speaker A: Right. All the way from Hammurabi and whatnot in crypto. I guess maybe your point is more around the relative decline of frequency of these main characters. I think that's probably correct in some sense, but I think they still exist. So, like, obviously Toli is one, Sriram is one, Jesse from Base is probably one. And you know, the founders of, like, Barrel, like Smokey and stuff are some as well. I would say maybe even Poly Market's founder, Shane could be one, because polymarket's arguably, you know, the most interesting app actually on Earth right now.
00:49:22.649 - 00:49:55.343, Speaker A: Which is a wild thing to say because it's crypto. You don't even really know if it's crypto, but it's passed like the New York Times or something. I believe, like, for like the third, like, political app or something. That's pretty crazy. And I don't think it goes away. I think if I were to really try to create something here, what's happening is there's probably more diversification, meaning there's all these different solutions now. There's all different L1s, all different L2s, all different DeFi apps.
00:49:55.343 - 00:50:32.937, Speaker A: There's a hyperliquid and so now it's just like there's more and more people such that it becomes difficult for one person to stand out unless they're super insane. And then also like the figures generally have been like exchange operators. Right. Like cz, Sam, Brian, even Do Kwon to an extent. Like they have to hold a very large amount of money for people to care what they think in a sense, which is why traders are big on Twitter. Like Ansem obviously has a lot of money as well. And so that seems like there's.
00:50:32.937 - 00:51:01.661, Speaker A: You can't really take on coinbase at this point unless you're like super focused on your go to market. Like for example, Backpack is going after Japan specifically. And so there's also the thing of like people actually understand the main character syndrome now, so they don't want to be the main character. Right. Kind of going back to the satoshi days, which is like satoshi, like fuck that. Like, I'm not, Do not reveal who I am because that brings no good. I would say Vitalik is still the main character as well.
00:51:01.661 - 00:51:26.675, Speaker A: Like Vitalik will say anything and then people, literally anything and people, 5,000 likes instantly. Like he'll post like a 500 page blog post, but then 5,000 likes, nobody's read it yet. And so I think crypto's probably gotten better at self regulating a little bit, but I would expect one of these characters to pop back up pretty soon.
00:51:27.335 - 00:52:12.107, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you make a good point there. Like in, in last cycle it was maybe a little easier to just pull out, like, okay, you know, it's SBF versus cz, east versus West. It just was a lot easier to pull out, like, who are the main characters in crypto today? It's just a little harder. And I think you can be the main character of like a niche, niche subgenre in crypto. So like ANSEM is the main character maybe of meme coin trading or I don't know, humor would be up there for I guess like infra and things like that. So maybe it's, it's harder to just become like the crypto guy that everybody knows. I also think, yeah, complex.
00:52:12.107 - 00:52:12.931, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:52:13.083 - 00:52:54.377, Speaker A: The complexity of ecosystem as it grows just becomes more and more or increases more and more. And so I think this sub niche thing is like a good observation which is say like, okay, now there's the DA wars. It's like, okay, is it celestial or is it Eigen DA or is it a veil or is it fuck the DA? Do I just do everything in L1 and if I do that maybe I'll listen to. Totally. Or is it zk and then there's zk, guys. And it's just like all these different things. Or like, is it Cosmos? Or maybe it's Parachain? And maybe it's Noble? Is it Stable coins? Is it USDC or usdt? And so as everything kind of keeps growing and this is just capitalism, competition increases.
00:52:54.377 - 00:53:05.905, Speaker A: And as competition increases, it doesn't just become about Michael Jordan anymore. It becomes about Michael Jordan versus the Celtics or versus the Lakers. And maybe it's about Magic Johnson. It's just keeps getting more and more complex.
00:53:06.565 - 00:53:35.405, Speaker B: Hmm. Interesting. Yeah. So, okay, I think with our last couple of minutes here, I just wanted to like, touch on the general. You know, we haven't really talked since break point, but you were there, I guess, for Token and for Breakpoint in Singapore. The whole crypto world was pretty focused on that for that week. There were a lot of announcements that came out and it just seemed like tons and tons of folks descended on Singapore.
00:53:35.405 - 00:53:50.425, Speaker B: So I don't know. I guess we're 2 weeks post Singapore now. What are your general takeaways or like, feelings about the crypto world can be confined to Solana or more broadly, just post that sort of conference season out there.
00:53:51.885 - 00:54:16.479, Speaker A: Yeah, so I actually went to basically all the conferences this year. I had like a strict rule to not do conferences for the first two years of Helios. And then this year I was kind of like, let me just kind of see what I'm missing out here. So I've been on the circuit for like four or five months almost. So I've been to like, ECC Korea, Blockchain Week, etc. I'm going to like Cosmoverse and with. With Breakpoint specifically.
00:54:16.479 - 00:54:47.385, Speaker A: One thing I would comment on is how much larger it was than all the other Breakpoints. There's just a lot more people. And these people were generally like. People would say, like, it's like about meme coins or something. But, like, I did not see much meme Coin activity in person. It was a lot of teams that were building things, even phones or like hardware devices. There were side events that were like super focused on a vertical, like Defi Day or Mev Day or Validator Day.
00:54:47.385 - 00:55:12.625, Speaker A: And the communities are just much larger in size. And like, me and TO were doing a fireside chat and like, that was a huge room and it was packed. It was thousands of people. And I was like, that's like, pretty insane that people are just watching us to talk here. Or like Kevin Bowers talk. The debates were pretty cool. People were like debating for their position but also still main the other people's positions and stuff.
00:55:12.625 - 00:56:18.521, Speaker A: So I think like conferences are almost can be treated like a product in which they kind of just keep getting better over time as you learn what sucks from the past ones. The main thing that I'll comment on, which probably everybody knows is like the biggest difference that I saw was the focus on products on Solana versus the focus on infra on other networks. In terms of the conference like you would go to, I went to a bunch of talks at Ecclesiastical and they were almost all infra focused. And I actually mean that you can kind of just look at the agenda and very niche infra focus too versus on Solana it was like 5 minute product keynotes and just pumping out product out of product. Whether it's like a new debit card, Franklin Templeton putting a mutual fund on chain, a new phone because there was actually other phones other than Solana Seekers or like prediction markets, all this stuff and it was just very product focused. So that was the biggest difference. So the size and the segments of.
00:56:18.553 - 00:56:38.485, Speaker B: Focus we talked about I guess Fire Dancer and how decentralized Solana is but there were like lots and lots of things at Breakpoint to separate the signal from the noise. What's something non Fire dance, right? I guess I'll say that you're interested or excited by coming out of that time in Singapore.
00:56:41.865 - 00:57:49.167, Speaker A: I think the number of new startups was really cool to see. Like a lot of people have ideas and some sort of an MEP and they're just looking to get some help from the ecosystem to you know, go to market and stuff. So the number of those folks that were actually like good products was pretty inspiring. And then two is we always talk about Deepin but it seems to just keep getting bigger and bigger. Like there's a few pretty big deep in projects like a new energy grid, new CDN network, Renner completed their migration high MAPRO keeps getting bigger, helium keeps getting bigger and the deepen and then like the Internet fiber network is perhaps the biggest one. That's basically a deepen network. And so that is I think crypto's biggest chance to really make an impact outside of this circular economy and actually help people in areas where they would be excluded from crypto or let's say better products like Google Maps in certain areas of the world just sucks.
00:57:49.167 - 00:58:36.099, Speaker A: I mean actually Korea blockchain, Google Maps doesn't work by the way, right In South Korea Google is blocked. Google Maps is blocked. And so if you have peer to peer mapping with something like highmapper, that's genuinely just a better experience for the citizens of that country. That's pretty big. And so I think there's a lot of those left because there's a lot of physical stuff that's been neglected in the world of venture capital due to just generally shittier businesses, right? Like lower margins, harder entrepreneurs, worse competition, taking on monopolies. But if crypto is this thing that's actually supposed to help the world and it does that through better networks, because blockchain is just networks, then physical networks are probably the most interesting ones to tackle, and I'm seeing a good rise in those.
