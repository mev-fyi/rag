00:00:00.410 - 00:00:16.638, Speaker A: Go for it. Let's see where else the SVM can actually run. I think it is incredibly bullish for the core underlying technology of Solana, because now you're also going to be getting pressure tested in a new environment, a new set of use cases that may not actually be the core use case of the SVM today.
00:00:16.724 - 00:00:30.870, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by Jito. Jito is the easiest way to start earning mev rewards on Solana through Liquid staking. Get your soul, stake it with Jito and get instant access to liquidity through their liquid staking. Token Jeto Soul get started today at stake.
00:00:37.370 - 00:00:45.558, Speaker C: What's up, everybody? Welcome to another episode of Lightspeed today. We're joined by Mike Dudas from Six Man Ventures and Joe McCann from Asymmetric, both incredible investors in the space.
00:00:45.644 - 00:00:48.774, Speaker D: Guys, welcome to the show. Thanks. Thank you.
00:00:48.812 - 00:00:49.838, Speaker E: Excited to be here.
00:00:49.964 - 00:01:10.306, Speaker C: Yeah, we're pumped to have you here. There's a lot to talk about today. I want to talk about your general investing views. I want to get into the SVM narrative that's kind of dominating the space at the moment. But before we get into that, we need to have some context, because both of you have something that Jeff Morris, Jr. Calls an earned secret, something that he looks for in founders, which is their unique experiences that make them uniquely suited for what they're working on today. And Mike, you definitely have this.
00:01:10.306 - 00:01:21.734, Speaker C: You were in Fintech for ten years. You then started one of the largest media companies in crypto. Joe, you were, like, acting and storytelling growing up. Then you were a DJ, and you've been trading for 23 years, so you both have that. Mike, I would love to just start.
00:01:21.772 - 00:01:23.446, Speaker D: With you and kind of frame it.
00:01:23.468 - 00:01:27.480, Speaker C: Around your background, but how that's shaped your views in investing in crypto right now.
00:01:28.010 - 00:01:28.674, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:01:28.812 - 00:02:18.158, Speaker E: So even before basically moving into Fintech in 2010, I actually had spent a decade I like to say I'm a rising boomer. I've had a pretty long career, and I started my career at Disney. So I spent quite a bit of time at Disney and then ended up at YouTube later in the so I've spent a lot of time on really large scale consumer media businesses. So that really has impacted heavily what I'm looking for as an investor in crypto. And we can talk more about what that means and why. Solana specifically is interesting from that perspective. But obviously, crypto is money first and foremost.
00:02:18.158 - 00:03:30.240, Speaker E: And I switched from working in media in 2010 at Google on YouTube to jump to an emerging team called Google Wallet, which is now Google Pay. And the whole idea was that having mobile devices would change how people pay, and that's obviously happened. Apple Pay is increasingly embedded into any iOS user's life. But working at Google, seeing what Apple was starting to do after working at Google for about three years, I moved to Braintree Venmo. So I was there really early looking at peer to peer payments, but centralized peer to peer payments. And we were bought by PayPal, sort of the most centralized of peer to peer payments companies. And the biggest thing that I saw in those four or five years working on fintech, so kind of like putting a nice gloss and UX and UI on top of legacy financial rails was that we weren't truly call it changing the world, you're just kind of making it easier for people to transact on multidecade old technology.
00:03:30.240 - 00:04:42.658, Speaker E: And right around that time, 2012, 2013, basically became aware of Bitcoin, thought it would be incredibly interesting. And really the first problem that got me interested in crypto was all the merchants we were working with at Google Wallet, at PayPal, at Braintree, were paying 3% of gross revenue in credit card fees. And these are businesses that many of which, like grocery stores, have very low margins. So it's a huge portion of the profit share. So that's the thing that got me excited about crypto. When you then combine that with the fact that these networks are open, that they're permissionless, that they're global rapid settlement, the promise is today Immeasurable and back then was so that's what got me really excited. But the reason I mentioned both those experiences, the media experience, the fintech experience, is I'm really focused on how do we take advantage of things at that global permissionless scale, but at the same time, how do we make them easier for people to access? That's the thing that Disney did, packaging things up for consumption by consumers.
00:04:42.658 - 00:04:47.110, Speaker E: And so we have a lot of work to do there, but it's a really exciting time to be working in crypto.
00:04:47.930 - 00:04:48.722, Speaker D: That's great.
00:04:48.796 - 00:04:50.300, Speaker F: Joe, what about you?
00:04:50.990 - 00:05:46.620, Speaker A: Yeah, so my background is definitely colorful. I have actually a degree in philosophy with a focus in logic, which kind of gets you into law school, doesn't get you a job. I didn't go to law school. I taught myself programming and trading instead and been doing that for about 23 years now. And yeah, my background has kind of spanned from the music industry, a DJ, had a clothing company with my brother to Wall Street Trading, and then got into tech, really committed full time in 2008 after I left Wall Street, mostly because I just believed all the trading was moving to machines and algorithms. So I was like, I should probably just focus on the tech. So I left Wall Street Finance, went into tech full time, joined a startup in Manhattan, and then within about three years became the CTO at the top ad agency in New York City.
00:05:46.620 - 00:06:26.210, Speaker A: Through that kind of three year journey, I spent a lot of time doing R D into three major technology paradigm shifts as I saw them. They were hypotheses at the time. The first being that cloud computing would probably be a big thing. Second, mobile, and the third, open source. Open source technology and the kind of the philosophy around open source, particularly an open source project that was new in 2009 called Node JS, subsequently went on to start a company called Node Source, which is the Node JS company. So it's kind of like what Red Hat did for Linux. We would do that for node JS.
00:06:26.210 - 00:07:14.370, Speaker A: I bootstrapped that business and then ended up raising over 40 million in venture for it, sold it in 2019, and then Node went to become actually the most popular, widely adopted open source technology of the last decade. 100% of Force 500 uses it. Pretty much every crypto Web Three project uses it in some capacity, whether it's Node or NPM. So it's really a ubiquitous open source technology. And what I learned from that was a lot about what makes developers tick and what makes developer communities work. So kind of like fast forward to 2018. I had transitioned out of the CEO role in the chairman role of Node Source, took some time off, and instead of kind of smoking pot and hiking through Marin County, I decided to write quantitative and systematic trading strategies for crypto.
00:07:14.370 - 00:07:31.126, Speaker A: I had been in crypto. I knew about Bitcoin in 2011. Sadly, I didn't buy it because I was more focused on the kind of trading aspect. The tech part of it was pretty groundbreaking to me and made a lot of sense. But I started to get a little bit more active in 2016, really active.
00:07:31.158 - 00:07:34.558, Speaker D: In 2017, and then in 2018 when.
00:07:34.564 - 00:07:51.822, Speaker A: I took some time off. The reason I wanted to go into learning more about trading crypto is that it felt like a renaissance for trading. Because when I was on the trading desk ten years prior on Wall Street, it was all machines and algorithms. Like, you're never going to beat Citadel, you're never going to beat these renaissance.
00:07:51.886 - 00:07:56.734, Speaker D: Technologies that have these unbelievably powerful algorithms.
00:07:56.782 - 00:08:05.270, Speaker A: And like clicking them out. You're just at a disadvantage. And so crypto was like this renaissance of trading because it was 24/7, it was crazy amounts of leverage.
00:08:05.850 - 00:08:09.574, Speaker D: There was a whole swath of new.
00:08:09.612 - 00:08:30.346, Speaker A: Traders that had never traded anything in their life except crypto. And I think most importantly, and this was the key thing for me that unlocked was that it was open. Yes, there were centralized exchanges, but the idea was that on Wall Street, everything was really gatekeeped. In order to just trade, you have to set up an account and you've.
00:08:30.378 - 00:08:31.466, Speaker E: Got to work with a prime broker.
00:08:31.498 - 00:08:35.134, Speaker A: And you need a Bloomberg subscription and there's like all these hoops to jump through.
00:08:35.252 - 00:08:35.946, Speaker D: With crypto.
00:08:35.978 - 00:09:24.480, Speaker A: It was like, oh, you have a quant strategy you want to run? Like, here's the API, just go. And so it dawned on me that this was kind of like the open source philosophy being applied to finance, and particularly digital finance. So I got really deep into the trading sides of things, ended up joining Passport Capital institutional hedge fund on the West Coast to run their quant and systematic trading desk for crypto in 2018. I did that, it was awesome. But I left shortly thereafter, not because of Passport, but because the industry, even today it's next to impossible to trade crypto as a US hedge fund. So I said, look, it's not you, it's me. I want to continue to go explore this space without kind of the constraints of working in a regulated institutional hedge fund.
00:09:24.480 - 00:10:29.698, Speaker A: Meanwhile, it's 2019 bear market, great time to start doing some R and D again. And so, like I had done ten years prior, the R and D that I did was in blockchain related technologies and really starting to understand those developer ecosystems, communities and also the tech itself. And so I wrote some solidity applications, started to track that ecosystem and it dawned on me very quickly that Ethereum was a type of technology that was incredibly powerful. It created a new kind of programming paradigm altogether, but it was constrained by the way it was designed. And so when I found Solana, yes, I was early in terms of price, but I was also reading the source code and trying to understand the white paper and thinking to myself, man, if they can actually pull off what they say that this thing can do, it dramatically changes the spectrum of applications that can be built in a permissionless manner. And so yes, I've been a huge Solana supporter. I'm not a Solana maxi but at the same time got very deep into kind of the Solana ecosystem.
00:10:29.698 - 00:10:33.686, Speaker A: Meanwhile, at that point I had been recruited to join Microsoft and their cloud.
00:10:33.708 - 00:10:36.578, Speaker D: And AI organization in the developer vision.
00:10:36.594 - 00:11:21.318, Speaker A: So this is GitHub vs. Code, all the stuff that developers end up using and my job was pretty sweet. It was basically helping them not miss the next big thing. So you can imagine that I did a lot of stuff with I did a lot of M and A work, but also a lot of stuff on Web Three and blockchain. And before I left Start Acmetric, I had more or less written like the Web Three strategy for sets in adela and the senior leadership team across every line of business. I did this in concert with other members of the team, but I was kind of the subject matter expert within Microsoft, which was kind of striking to me because the organization is absolutely massive, but really no one was really paying attention to crypto and blockchain at the time. So that was a really awesome experience.
00:11:21.318 - 00:11:37.414, Speaker A: It gave me a lot of time to actually do a lot of angel investing and also R and D and kind of get paid for it candidly. But in October of 2021 I had a very close friend of mine named Steve Jing, who's the founder of Kindred.
00:11:37.462 - 00:11:42.906, Speaker D: Ventures, just got added to the midas list. He's a lights out investor, first in.
00:11:42.928 - 00:12:07.542, Speaker A: Uber coinbase tonal, Magic, Eden, bunch of stuff. And he's also a former entrepreneur. He offered me an ability to come run a crypto fund for Kindred. And I said, look, man, I'm flattered, but I'm an entrepreneur. If I'm going to do something, I'm going to do it myself. And he's like, I knew you would say that. And so he was kind of the catalyst to help me set up Asymmetric, which is my fund today.
00:12:07.542 - 00:12:14.594, Speaker A: So Asymmetric, for what it's worth, is a fund that has an early stage venture capital fund as well as discretionary.
00:12:14.642 - 00:12:18.198, Speaker D: Liquid hedge fund, kind of run it.
00:12:18.204 - 00:12:50.900, Speaker A: Like a technology company. No surprise. I have a big technical background, and that has actually surfaced really well to the extent where the kind of deals that we evaluate on the venture side, we actually read source code, and we actually get really deep on the technical side with the founders that we meet with. I've had multiple times founders say to me, wow, I've never had a VC ask you that question. So we have definitely a technical lens on how we look into the early stage investing and then on the kind of discretionary liquid hedge fund.
00:12:52.950 - 00:12:53.554, Speaker D: I've been.
00:12:53.592 - 00:13:31.454, Speaker A: Trading a long time. A guy that trades with me ran a billion and a quarter of Rev and Howard global macro, cross Asset, cross geo. We've got a lot of institutional knowledge on how to manage risk, and we've been very successful even throughout the entire bear market. We actually launched the fund in June of 2022, so ten days later was Three Arrows. Good timing. So overall, what we look for, really, when we're evaluating investments is a couple of things. One, we have some kind of preconceived notions and views around where we think that the future of the Internet, web.
00:13:31.454 - 00:13:51.190, Speaker A: Three, and also just digital finance is going, and we look for things that could potentially align with those. But more importantly, I think it has a lot to do with the founders. We're super early stage. We're usually first check in. So a lot of the times you'll meet founders and they have an idea.
00:13:51.260 - 00:13:53.218, Speaker D: And it's wrong, that's okay if you're.
00:13:53.234 - 00:14:05.146, Speaker A: A really good founder and you've got the grit and tenacity to pivot or evolve or grind, those are folks that we want to back. And so we've been very fortunate to do deals with mike deals with a.
00:14:05.168 - 00:14:06.726, Speaker E: Number of other firms that are tier.
00:14:06.758 - 00:14:08.298, Speaker A: One in the space, right out of.
00:14:08.304 - 00:14:09.798, Speaker D: The bat, right out of the gate.
00:14:09.814 - 00:14:13.750, Speaker A: I should say, and we'll continue to invest in the space heavily.
00:14:13.830 - 00:14:44.834, Speaker F: All right, that's quite an intro. I know Steve was the inspiration. He's actually one of my favorite investors in the space, so that's awesome to hear. So, Joel, you talked about why you kind of I mean, it makes sense why with your background, you would kind of resonate a bit more towards Solana, even though you're not like a maxi, but it's obviously open source development, quant strategies, et cetera. That makes a lot of sense. Mike, I'm curious, as you know, maybe you probably started, as everybody did with Ethereum. Why are you considering solana?
00:14:44.882 - 00:14:47.366, Speaker D: Probably, I would say more seriously than.
00:14:47.388 - 00:14:57.846, Speaker F: Other investors I've seen. There seems to be maybe some allergy towards Solana in some of the investor circles, but you two are super prolific and supportive of the ecosystem.
00:14:57.878 - 00:15:00.474, Speaker D: So just curious how you think about it.
00:15:00.672 - 00:16:19.246, Speaker E: Yeah, so basically it gets to, frankly, one, what Solana enables, and two, the type of person that that seems to attract. So I didn't start investing until 2021. And what was really interesting is you had application builder people building applications on Ethereum as early as, what, 2017, the ICO era and sort of craze. And most of what I was seeing candidly, there just weren't a tremendous number of applications that I was excited personally to use. And so when I started investing in 2021 and we looked at the landscape and we said, hey, where are there interesting products that are exciting and that resonate? I'm not an engineer myself, so I like to look at things that I would actually use. The whole idea of invest and what you understand examples would be things like Steppin, which was a really easy to grok move and earn. Obviously, the economics were pretty cooked at the beginning where I'd earned $15 to go get a coffee.
00:16:19.246 - 00:17:05.378, Speaker E: But the concept there and when we obviously heard the idea, it was just really interesting to us. And those folks chose to build on Salana because they believed, and they actually did and continue to serve millions and now hundreds of thousands of folks. And that's just not possible, certainly on Ethereum layer one in a cost effective way. So that attracted us. We were seeing in that, again, 2021 phrase when I started to invest, kind of like call it V, two of some of the things that you were seeing on Ethereum. So obviously, by the time we started investing, openc was not early stage anymore, but Magic Eden was. And you know, we saw that team really early.
00:17:05.378 - 00:17:59.510, Speaker E: We started using it and it was just an incredible product. How fast they created that product and made it, frankly, I believe, superior to OpenSea within frankly, just a few months. We invested in a company called Photo Finish on the gaming front that basically is outlasting zedrun and continues and is accessible to people. So the key for us, you saw things on like Binance smart chain that were accessible to people, but not a lot of folks like in the US were participating. Solana was really cool because a lot of folks that I knew, I could point to these products, they could use them, they could onboard, the developers were accessible, you could talk to them. And there was just a lot of things happening that were very fun and it didn't require you to be a whale. And I really enjoyed that.
00:17:59.510 - 00:18:36.830, Speaker E: So I could recommend a product to somebody. So anyway, we were attracted to those sorts of things, and the infrastructure, frankly, was as good, if not better things like Phantom as a wallet. I think it's better than MetaMask. It's just a great consumer product. So that's what attracted us to Salana. And what's been really interesting is, despite the macro narrative around, hey, everything imploded this, that, and the other thing. We've invested in more than two dozen projects on Salana, and almost every single one of them is still humming, is delivering product.
00:18:36.830 - 00:19:47.750, Speaker E: I mentioned Photo Finish that has a great horse racing game. And Solana, we invested in squads very early. They're the sort of safe of Solana, and they have some really exciting announcements coming up in the next month. Or this, I believe, this beautiful ecosystem that has a platform that's extremely performant, allows for applications that can scale, it attracts incredible developers, and unlike many other non ethereum L1s, like, there's a lot of L1s out there that have tremendous numbers of mercenary folks. Salana really does have missionaries, and you can just tell when you look at there was a hackathon in Bangalore that Balaji tweeted about last week, and there's hundreds of people in the audience, and then you go to the next city in India and there's hundreds more. So it truly is an authentic developer community, a performant blockchain that allows for applications that are financial and non financial in nature. We haven't even gotten into the financial parts, and we will, I'm sure, talk about visas and other know it.
00:19:47.900 - 00:19:48.982, Speaker D: It just works.
00:19:49.036 - 00:20:17.322, Speaker E: And particularly it just works over the last six, seven months. Obviously, there was a period last year where Solana was criticized for some of its lack of reliability, but it's just working. And it's working for the things that we really get excited about investing in, which know, I come from this, as I mentioned, media background, music, I and payments background. So I want to invest in things that consumers and businesses will use in their everyday lives and use regularly.
00:20:17.386 - 00:20:28.210, Speaker C: Joe, when you originally got into Solana at the time, I bet there were some applications on it, but it had to be mostly about the tech, right? Because you're like, okay, this is a platform that other projects want to build on, and your fund is called Asymmetric, right.
00:20:28.280 - 00:20:29.574, Speaker D: For people that don't know, that means.
00:20:29.612 - 00:20:53.882, Speaker C: It'S like limited downside, almost unlimited upside. So there's a big asymmetry in the outcomes. How do you feel about Salana then, versus today? So you've seen other chains pop up that you might call next gen, who are also going for, like, parallel execution. I don't know if anyone else has isolated fee markets at this point, but you've seen the SVM with Eclipse. They're talking about releasing an Svml. Two general purpose on ethereum. How do you feel about the ecosystem today, maybe relative to when you first started investing?
00:20:53.946 - 00:20:58.858, Speaker A: Yeah. To answer that, we should probably talk about my view initially.
00:20:58.954 - 00:21:04.626, Speaker D: So I don't know if there's any sort of key to my success is.
00:21:04.648 - 00:21:21.650, Speaker A: That I've been fascinated with pattern recognition for a long time, and not just the obvious pattern recognition of like, oh, this is a really talented founder. I try to do what I kind of have loosely coined as broad spectrum pattern recognition.
00:21:21.730 - 00:21:25.586, Speaker D: So you take patterns that have existed.
00:21:25.618 - 00:22:25.318, Speaker A: In, say, other disciplines, other verticals history, et cetera, and you try to map that to new stuff. And so, for example, when Node JS came on the scene in 2009, there was a confluence of events happening that suggested that we were going to need something that makes web servers scale more efficiently and more effectively. Because prior to that, prior to Node JS, the way that you basically scaled your web server, or your website, if you will, was to just add more servers. That was basically the way that people did it. And that becomes a technical nightmare from an Ops perspective, security perspective, et cetera. So when Node JS came about, it had a fundamentally different approach to how scaling Internet businesses and Internet activity worked. And that fundamentally different approach was in alignment with this explosion of then mobile technologies.
00:22:25.318 - 00:22:32.894, Speaker A: The Internet of things was really taking off. You had Internet connected TVs and displays, all of these things that were not.
00:22:32.932 - 00:22:36.170, Speaker D: Just computers connecting to the Internet.
00:22:36.250 - 00:22:58.166, Speaker A: And so my kind of hypothesis was if this thing actually can scale and do what it says it's going to do, it's going to ride this wave because it's got a new way of thinking about how to scale effectively I O and network activity. So what does that do with Solana? When you look at Ethereum, it was.
00:22:58.188 - 00:23:01.462, Speaker D: The first smart contract platform, right? Awesome.
00:23:01.596 - 00:23:16.394, Speaker A: A leap in computer science. Nothing but respect for that. But the approach to how they designed it and the way that it scales is challenging. I'll just put it to you that way.
00:23:16.432 - 00:23:16.922, Speaker D: Right.
00:23:17.056 - 00:23:21.910, Speaker A: And this is not I don't think this is really like a dig against Ethereum. It's just a physics problem.
00:23:22.000 - 00:23:22.494, Speaker D: Right.
00:23:22.612 - 00:23:32.650, Speaker A: And so when I looked at Solana, it's the same thing that I saw with Node years prior, which was they're thinking about it in a fundamentally different way.
00:23:32.820 - 00:23:35.860, Speaker D: And so if it can work and.
00:23:36.230 - 00:23:44.354, Speaker A: They'Re going to ride this wave of new adoption because there's this move towards permissionless networks and a new way of.
00:23:44.472 - 00:23:49.398, Speaker D: Transacting through finance, et cetera, put those two together.
00:23:49.484 - 00:24:14.106, Speaker A: I've seen the pattern in the past. Good probability there's some asymmetric upside with Solana as a technology being adopted. In addition to that, they, instead of trying to create their own Turing complete programming language, chose Rust, which was, I think, a very smart move. And there's a reason for that. Developers. When you want to onboard developers into an ecosystem, you tend to want to.
00:24:14.128 - 00:24:16.390, Speaker D: Make that path easy.
00:24:16.560 - 00:24:35.458, Speaker A: As easy as possible. And so Rust is a tried and true tested systems language. There's tons of tooling, there's lots of kind of prior art and history for how to do things. There's patterns and abstractions for how to do stuff. Just using Rust with Solidity, they got to start from scratch, more or less, right?
00:24:35.544 - 00:24:38.466, Speaker D: And there's nothing wrong with someone wanting.
00:24:38.498 - 00:24:53.942, Speaker A: To design a programming language specific to their use case, but you are now putting friction in front of developers, adopting it in mass. And so I also saw Solana making this choice as a key way to attract developers that already know how to write Rust.
00:24:54.006 - 00:24:54.282, Speaker D: Right.
00:24:54.336 - 00:25:01.142, Speaker A: And yes, of course, there are plenty of salon and ethereum applications where no one has to write any Solidity or Rust. They can just use JavaScript.
00:25:01.206 - 00:25:01.914, Speaker D: Right.
00:25:02.112 - 00:25:13.746, Speaker A: But that was another signal to me that they were doing things, I think, differently, that I also agreed with. And so, over the course of since, whatever, 2020 till now, or I guess.
00:25:13.768 - 00:25:25.750, Speaker D: 2019, 2020 till now, what has changed from the tech development standpoint? Well, yes, we've had reliability challenges.
00:25:26.090 - 00:25:51.818, Speaker A: Welcome to software development. If you are not adopting an archaic approach of shipping software once a year, which is literally what people did in the 90s, right? Once a year, you got your upgrade, you got to go in and install the CDROM and do all this bullshit. That fundamentally changed in Web Two, particularly with companies like Facebook that were constantly shipping.
00:25:51.914 - 00:25:52.558, Speaker D: Right.
00:25:52.724 - 00:26:20.374, Speaker A: These concepts of continuous integration, continuous development, constantly updating, constantly testing, and prototyping and borderline testing in production. Facebook was kind of a spearhead of this, and it is actually how you ship software today. You don't wait a year to ship a new release. You ship a new release as quickly as you possibly can. Solana adopted that, and I thought that was actually the right move, because what you end up doing is you get.
00:26:20.492 - 00:26:24.934, Speaker D: Real world activity testing your system.
00:26:25.132 - 00:26:28.422, Speaker A: One of the challenges with testing blockchain.
00:26:28.486 - 00:26:31.146, Speaker D: Environments is that when you're building, like.
00:26:31.168 - 00:26:41.754, Speaker A: A Web Two application, you can mirror traffic and you can kind of emulate almost perfectly what a production environment looks.
00:26:41.792 - 00:26:44.854, Speaker D: Like with a permissionless blockchain.
00:26:44.902 - 00:27:21.530, Speaker A: That's very difficult to do. That's very difficult to do. And I know that there's companies out there that are attempting to build some infrastructure around this, and I think that that is an unbelievable engineering feat to tackle. But I believed that if Solana for the long term was going to be as reliable and stable and as performant as I assumed it would be, that there was going to have to be bumps along the way. And so I completely agree with the approach that Anatolian team took and continue to take with their approach to shipping software and shipping new releases, et cetera.
00:27:22.270 - 00:27:26.534, Speaker D: What ends up as a result of that is, to Mike's point, stability.
00:27:26.662 - 00:27:58.070, Speaker A: Reliability. Right. We're there. Now, this is not to say that there could not be an issue in the future. It just means that we're ironing out more of these kinks such that the types of applications that can be built on it can now be relied upon. And I think in probably 21 and 22 there are a number of folks that say no hedge fund is going to trade on Salana because they can't have their risk be unavailable to get in and out of or whatever.
00:27:58.140 - 00:27:58.566, Speaker D: Right.
00:27:58.668 - 00:28:09.146, Speaker A: I think that's a fair statement to make, but that's not the only purpose or use case of Solana. And furthermore, as you start to see the spectrum of applications that are being.
00:28:09.168 - 00:28:12.506, Speaker D: Built on Solana coupled with things that.
00:28:12.528 - 00:28:22.350, Speaker A: Are quite literally only possible on Solana, the DeFi side of it, the financial side of it, is obviously a critical component.
00:28:22.690 - 00:28:24.154, Speaker D: But, I mean, look at dialect.
00:28:24.202 - 00:28:26.414, Speaker A: Look at Drip. There's a number of other types of.
00:28:26.452 - 00:28:31.166, Speaker D: Applications that don't necessarily mean DeFi, that.
00:28:31.188 - 00:28:33.790, Speaker A: Don'T necessarily mean only financial transactions.
00:28:33.870 - 00:28:37.566, Speaker D: And so to me, by the approach.
00:28:37.598 - 00:29:02.514, Speaker A: That Solana took in the early days of having a fundamentally different view on how to solve this blockchain issues with respect to reliability, spam performance, et cetera, coupled with the way that they just chose to ship frequently, and in some cases, things would break. You now have a platform that developers.
00:29:02.562 - 00:29:05.478, Speaker D: Can rely upon to build really interesting.
00:29:05.564 - 00:29:08.006, Speaker A: Applications that you simply can't build on.
00:29:08.028 - 00:29:10.190, Speaker D: Any other L1, as it stands today.
00:29:10.380 - 00:29:37.966, Speaker C: Yeah, and just add that talking about all the updates that have gone through Solana, which at times, obviously, could lead to a little bit of an unstable network. But since that point, they've put in priority fees, which used to if you wanted to get your transaction at the top of the block, you just had to spam the network. But now you can actually pay to be at the front. So it reduces like double transactions. For example, then you had isolated fee markets release and you also had Quick and Weight stated QoS. So all those are basically network stability updates that got released. And since then, Swan has been extremely stable.
00:29:37.966 - 00:29:48.386, Speaker C: So, yeah, I love just like looking at how quickly they release products and that's something we talked about anatoly about and calling it Swan a 2.0 after those updates, but he said we have to wait until Fire Dancer gets released.
00:29:48.498 - 00:29:49.798, Speaker A: And by the way, just really quick.
00:29:49.884 - 00:29:51.754, Speaker D: Those things that you just mentioned, those.
00:29:51.792 - 00:29:53.894, Speaker A: Have been publicly known on the roadmap.
00:29:53.942 - 00:29:55.338, Speaker D: For a while, right?
00:29:55.424 - 00:30:18.034, Speaker A: You just don't have people on the internet wanting to go and sift through GitHub issues. These have been known. So I would have know a lot of guys that I know in the space that are not technical. When things were going sideways for Solana's liability, I was this is these are known things and they have a path to solving them and they've actively been working on them. This is not.
00:30:18.072 - 00:30:18.370, Speaker D: New.
00:30:18.440 - 00:30:32.998, Speaker A: Yes, it is unfortunate that there is a reliability issue, but let's be clear, they've been very transparent about what they're doing to fix this, and you can track the activity of it. That is another, I think, benefit to it being an open source project and.
00:30:33.004 - 00:30:36.310, Speaker D: It being utterly transparent on something like GitHub.
00:30:37.390 - 00:31:37.066, Speaker E: Yeah, I think the one counter to that would be ethereum is incredible. The ethereum ecosystem is incredible at saying, look, the thing doesn't work the way that we ultimately know that it needs to. And we have really complex five to ten year plan to fix things. And by the way, that plan is going to change five to ten times before we get there. But we're going to relentlessly tell you the narrative of what's being upgraded and what's coming next. And I definitely know over the last nine months, the salana, both the foundation labs, but also folks in the ecosystem like Garrett and Mer are getting considerably better. And Joe at saying, look, we understand XYZ isn't perfect, and by the way, this is why we didn't prioritize it for the last three years, and we are prioritizing it now.
00:31:37.066 - 00:31:39.130, Speaker E: Everything has to happen sequentially.
00:31:41.010 - 00:32:04.126, Speaker F: Yeah, probably my favorite point made there by Joe is the speed of shipping is something that I feel has been very neglected in crypto. So the analogy I like to make is ethereum is like science, where Solana is like engineering, where you get feedback from reality based on what you've shipped. And sometimes that might break, but ultimately it leads to a better iteration.
00:32:04.238 - 00:32:35.238, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, quick break to tell you about Jito. Jito is the number one liquid staking provider in Solana. Jito has been known for their MEB software, and now they're the fastest growing liquid staking provider in the Solana ecosystem. Solana DeFi summer is heating up, and what asset do you want to use in DeFi liquid staking token. Why? Because with Jito, you can take your soul, stake it, and get instant access to liquidity through their liquid staking token, jeto Soul. You can then use Jeto soul throughout the Solana DeFi ecosystem while earning yields through mev rewards and staking rewards with Jeto. And Jito makes staking super simple.
00:32:35.238 - 00:32:57.622, Speaker B: You can take your soul, stake it, get instant liquidity, and start earning rewards all within three clicks. And not only do they make it simple, they make it secure. Jito has seven audits. They have more than a million souls staked, and they're one of the most respected teams in all of DeFi. Jito is for whales who need deep liquidity. It's also for people like me and you who just want to get started with liquid staking. You have your soul, why not stake, make it, earn some yield and start dabbling in salona D five.
00:32:57.622 - 00:33:08.294, Speaker B: So go get started today. Check them out at GDO Network. Staking. That's GTO Network staking. I'll put a link in the show notes. Use the link so they know that I sent you and go get started today.
00:33:08.492 - 00:33:42.926, Speaker F: And so like having maybe these two ecosystems, or obviously there's Ethereum and the modular thesis, there's Cosmos and the option thesis, l two S and then integrated chains. How do you guys, as investors, think about just the overall state of crypto? How do you see all these different architectural choices playing out? Obviously there's some interesting dynamics at play as well, like Ethereum alignment, like SVM roll ups now with Eclipse and Value pool to Soul. It's a very noisy world. So what's your mental model of the crypto landscape?
00:33:43.118 - 00:33:54.914, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll jump in on the technical side first because I love stirring up controversy. So, look, the modular versus model ethic.
00:33:54.962 - 00:33:59.434, Speaker D: Debate in Blockchains right now, this has.
00:33:59.472 - 00:34:44.486, Speaker A: Been the case in software development and software architecture for decades. This is nothing new. And so crypto, Twitter, and I would say people in crypto ecosystems in general love to get tribal behind a narrative that they wholeheartedly believe in and don't actually understand, I would say the prior art or history or the pattern around this type of stuff. So let's talk about monolithic and maslow. And I'll address your question as to how I think about investing in it. So the monolithic versus service oriented architecture, SOA this is old school. If you want to go back many decades, has been around for a very long time and there is no one right way to do things.
00:34:44.486 - 00:34:53.178, Speaker A: There are trade offs. And with a monolithic architecture, there are trade offs. Like testing a new feature in a.
00:34:53.184 - 00:34:55.066, Speaker D: Monolith, you have to test everything because.
00:34:55.088 - 00:35:06.560, Speaker A: It'S the entire thing, right? Testing something in a service oriented architecture is simple. You can just test that one specific thing because it's modular, it's its own little service, right?
00:35:07.090 - 00:35:09.582, Speaker D: In a monolith, notes are great for.
00:35:09.636 - 00:35:19.634, Speaker A: Teams of fewer than 100 people because they can all work on the same code base and everybody understands what's going on and everybody can build, et cetera. But then your builds and deploys are.
00:35:19.672 - 00:35:22.014, Speaker D: Slow versus service oriented.
00:35:22.062 - 00:35:50.742, Speaker A: Orgosher or microservices or modular teams can work on individual services. And deployment is really simple because you just deployed that one little service, right? This concept has been around for a very long time. And so I was mentioning this in a Telegram chat the other day. There's an image, you can search this image for Uber's set of microservices. This is what a modular architecture looks like. It's a nightmare. It's just insane.
00:35:50.742 - 00:36:21.442, Speaker A: There's hundreds of these microservices, they communicate in various ways. And there's always trade offs to having all of a sudden hundreds, if not thousands of microservices in your architecture. And so as this relates to the modular argument with respect to blockchains, I'm sure there are use cases where it's going to be beneficial. But let's be clear, there are trade offs. When you have a microservices architecture at Uber, guess what? That team is controlled and centralized within Uber.
00:36:21.586 - 00:36:22.998, Speaker D: Right now you're going to have a.
00:36:23.004 - 00:37:03.074, Speaker A: Modular architecture for blockchains where you don't have the centralized team. You have people all over the world trying to know, get together and do the right thing and the same thing in the way that it's supposed to be across a set of standards that are kind of yet to be defined with patterns that don't really exist yet. I'm not saying it's not going to work. I'm saying let's acknowledge that it's really fucking hard, right? With respect to a monolith, of course there's also trade offs, right? Personally, I think the monolithic approach with respect to blockchains makes a lot more sense. Forget the technical reasons. I think it makes a lot more sense for the developers because it makes.
00:37:03.112 - 00:37:06.166, Speaker D: It way easier to build applications when.
00:37:06.188 - 00:37:54.178, Speaker A: You have one target versus I need this data availability thing. And this for state management and this for storage and this for execution and whatever. And pick another service that will eventually get added to that modular stack. The complexity and mental overhead for an individual engineer gets really thick really fast. And so if you're trying to onboard more developers into your ecosystem to build applications, you want to reduce that friction, you don't want to increase it. And so I am actually pro modular. I am rooting for that camp because I would love to see how this would work in a kind of decentralized manner as well as how developers are actually going to build applications knowing that there's all these disparate parts that need to communicate with each other.
00:37:54.264 - 00:37:57.494, Speaker D: So on the investment side, I have.
00:37:57.532 - 00:38:02.550, Speaker A: Made very few investments on the kind of modular.
00:38:03.530 - 00:38:07.062, Speaker D: I would say narrative, it's not because.
00:38:07.116 - 00:38:51.446, Speaker A: I don't believe it won't work, it's that it just doesn't align with what I think is currently better. And my view is that on the monolithic side, that to me currently is better and the counterargument is, well, Joey and you invest for the future. I can't probabilistically forecast an asymmetric upside return on the modular argument, yet without some sort of evidence or some sort of weighting against how developers are going to adopt this. And by the way, this is the same thing with me with zero knowledge, right? I was on a podcast with Logan, I think a year and a half or so ago and he was asking me about zero knowledge. I'm like, I am not an academic expert on zero knowledge, but I can.
00:38:51.468 - 00:38:53.126, Speaker D: Tell you as a product guy, I.
00:38:53.148 - 00:39:03.034, Speaker A: Don'T know anybody building with it and I don't know how you build with it. And so maybe zero knowledge in ten years is just ubiquitous everywhere. And I'm completely wrong.
00:39:03.152 - 00:39:05.018, Speaker D: I'm totally okay with that because the.
00:39:05.024 - 00:39:14.526, Speaker A: Way that I'm thinking about investing is how are product engineers going to use what academic engineers are creating to create applications that users are going to use?
00:39:14.708 - 00:39:37.640, Speaker E: Does that mean that you wouldn't? So when you say modular versus monolithic. Are you talking about just at the call it L One or roll up blockchain level, you will only invest call it in monolithic? Or are you talking about, hey, I have a much, much higher bar to invest in an application that's built on a modular blockchain as well?
00:39:38.090 - 00:39:39.142, Speaker A: Yeah, great question.
00:39:39.196 - 00:39:42.582, Speaker D: So to clarify, when I'm talking about.
00:39:42.636 - 00:40:09.082, Speaker A: The modular versus monolithic argument, I'm talking about effectively investing in protocols and or infrastructure in the modular space. My kind of view is that there's going to be way more value created at the application tier. I invest tons in infrastructure, to be super clear, by the way. But that infrastructure that I'm investing in, I'm investing in it because I believe it will enable these types of applications to be built further up the stack.
00:40:09.146 - 00:40:09.566, Speaker D: Right?
00:40:09.668 - 00:40:22.878, Speaker A: And so that's kind of my view. It's not necessarily like an application using module. I mean, to be super clear, if you were a Web Two VC investing, do you give a shit if they use MongoDB or MySQL?
00:40:22.974 - 00:40:24.242, Speaker D: No, you don't, right?
00:40:24.296 - 00:40:44.746, Speaker A: You care about the application. So I don't care if you're using a modular stack or a monolithic stack. But for me, investing in the modular narrative and argument, I struggle currently to see a lot of sound investments in the infrastructure and protocol layer. We don't forecast yet how these applications are going to get built using I.
00:40:44.768 - 00:41:44.874, Speaker E: Tend to wonder if people really do believe in a modular future or if they actually believe in a we're going to try 10, 15, 20. Scaling approaches, but we actually think there's going to be a massive power law. And frankly, the winning ethereum solution we could call it modular, but it's really just going to be this roll up settling to the L, one that encompasses 70% of the transactions. I kind of hear that more and more from folks. And then the question that you have there is, well, if that is the case, if I invest an application, for example, that's building on a ZK roll up or if I invest on an Arbitrum, but the Op stack is the dominant stack, is it really that difficult for that application to move in the future? I would say to date it doesn't seem like it's been that difficult. So as an application investor, I'm a little less rigid in terms of where I invest. I'm just looking for the best applications.
00:41:45.002 - 00:41:45.678, Speaker D: Same.
00:41:45.844 - 00:42:19.858, Speaker C: Me and Mert have so many thoughts on quickly. Also, modular versus monolithic. We often say integrated, but the point of that is if you have a monolithic blockchain like something like Solana, that doesn't mean pieces within that can be modular in the sense that when they're building out Fire Dancer, it's very much supposed to be. You can work on one side of the code base versus another and you don't have to just touch one giant code base, which is the big downside of something that is monolithic. I think, Joe, on your point, it's also talking about what's in production today. I'm a gigable on Eclipse and what they're building. But also you're basically taking Solana, and now you're introducing the segment surges.
00:42:19.858 - 00:42:48.606, Speaker C: You're going to have upgradable contracts, you're going to have to have lower latency, right? Because you're now using GSDA, which has slower block times. There's a lot of new additional assumptions that you're putting in there, and nothing is alive today. So, yeah, I'm curious. Maybe let's just get straight to Eclipse when you're seeing that going around. Twitter today, even Bankless just tweeted today how it's like bullish for Solana. But then like two days ago, they were saying how bearish it is for Seoul. What are your thoughts on that announcement? That Eclipse for anyone that doesn't know, they're releasing the SVM general roll up on Ethereum.
00:42:48.606 - 00:42:53.506, Speaker C: So it's taking some of the best tech out of Solana, trying to bring it to Ethereum. And I think the key there is.
00:42:53.528 - 00:42:59.510, Speaker D: They want to tap into Ethereum's liquidity. That's really what they're trying to mean.
00:42:59.580 - 00:43:09.766, Speaker A: I as an open source Zealot, I am all for this, right? And I'm sure Anatoly is just as stoked, right? Because the SVM being open source as.
00:43:09.788 - 00:43:12.186, Speaker D: It is, you can apply it anywhere good.
00:43:12.288 - 00:43:23.322, Speaker A: That's exactly what you should be doing. And I think it's really cool that the guys at Eclipse are taking the SVM and trying to apply it differently than its kind of core use case today with Solana.
00:43:23.386 - 00:43:24.030, Speaker D: That's awesome.
00:43:24.100 - 00:43:39.634, Speaker A: That's exactly what should be doing, by the way, when this type of stuff happens, it adds a strengthening lindy effect to the underlying technology that's being utilized elsewhere, the SVM, because now, for example.
00:43:39.752 - 00:43:44.430, Speaker D: If Eclipse is successful, what are they dependent on? The SVM?
00:43:44.510 - 00:43:52.706, Speaker A: That thing has to continue to survive and exist and persist and improve and squash bugs and fix security patches and security bugs, et cetera, et cetera.
00:43:52.738 - 00:43:53.222, Speaker D: Right?
00:43:53.356 - 00:43:54.374, Speaker A: That has to happen.
00:43:54.412 - 00:43:58.438, Speaker D: And so from my perspective, go for it.
00:43:58.604 - 00:44:15.790, Speaker A: Absolutely. Let's see where else the SBM can actually run. I think it is incredibly bullish for the core underlying technology of Solana, because now you're also going to be getting pressure tested potentially in a new environment, a new set of use cases that may not actually be the core use case of the SPM today.
00:44:15.860 - 00:45:06.094, Speaker E: Generally, I think the narrative, it's a classic sort of Ethereum podcaster thing where the narrative is like light years ahead of the reality. Eclipse is an early stage project. It's extremely interesting. We know what all the advantages of the SVM are. I'm excited to see how parallel processing works in an Ethereum environment, but there's just a lot that has to happen before we're going to see that. And so I think the one thing I take issue with is just the cheesy headlines, like all the benefits of Solana with none of the drawbacks. You have to be more specific than that because you can't plug the SVM into Ethereum and make a statement like that.
00:45:06.094 - 00:45:10.862, Speaker E: I mean, this is still largely a lot of it is theoretical and we'll see what happens.
00:45:10.916 - 00:45:16.434, Speaker A: Right to Mike's point. So I met Neil when he was.
00:45:16.472 - 00:45:18.386, Speaker D: Raising and we spent a lot of.
00:45:18.408 - 00:45:58.782, Speaker A: Time on Eclipse and we ultimately couldn't get there. And by the way, I'm still absolutely rooting for them, but we couldn't get there. And it has a lot to do with what Mike is describing, where there's a path dependency that's multivariate. So many things have to go right, and I really hope it does. Genuinely, for the Eclipse team, we couldn't get there on the investment side because I couldn't size the risk of that. I looked at this and said the path dependent nature of how this thing actually plays out has so many kind of branches in the way that it has to succeed that it was difficult for me at the time to kind of secure an investment. And we were close.
00:45:58.782 - 00:46:03.386, Speaker A: We took a long time looking at Eclipse, which is another reason why I'm.
00:46:03.418 - 00:46:05.266, Speaker D: Still kind of bullish on what they're.
00:46:05.288 - 00:46:13.218, Speaker A: Doing from a technology side. But the theoretical kind of narrative is exactly correct. Like what Mike's saying is that until.
00:46:13.304 - 00:46:17.860, Speaker D: The rubber meets the road all right, cool.
00:46:18.470 - 00:46:19.874, Speaker A: Let's see it.
00:46:20.072 - 00:47:02.706, Speaker C: Yeah, Mike, and just closing out on your concept of like a power law outcome on Ethereum Scaling with these L two S, because me and Mert talk about like, oh, there's going to be 1000 or a million roll ups and it starts to get a little bit absurd. And you've actually seen this out of Eclipse because their original framework was going to be you're going to have all these app chains leveraging Eclipse, but now they're actually saying and you hear Neil talk about he's like, no, actually probably like 90 95% of the Use case is he's thinking will be served on that one general purpose. So it is interesting to see because Celestia's whole motto is like, it's as easy to launch an L1 as it is a smart contract. And I think that's really cool for innovation. That's what I like about the Ethereum roadmap, is that you have all these different execution layers compared to Salana, it's all one focus group, right. So you don't have as much flexibility there. But now with the SVM actually leaving Salana, that's one benefit that you get is you can get more experimentation there.
00:47:02.706 - 00:47:05.460, Speaker C: So I think that's an interesting outcome there.
00:47:05.770 - 00:47:06.134, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:47:06.172 - 00:47:28.362, Speaker E: Look, the most certain thing I can say is that I generally believe that Ethereum is going to exist as a really significant L1, probably the largest over the next call it decade in terms of liquidity, perhaps in terms of number of users, I don't know.
00:47:28.416 - 00:47:28.874, Speaker A: We'll see.
00:47:28.912 - 00:48:36.018, Speaker E: I think Solana has a really fantastic chance to have more users depending on how payment use cases shake out. But I think the thing that I tend we're investors in Ethereum and the protocol itself in tremendous numbers of applications as well as an infrastructure. But I don't think we have an exceptionally clear vision of what the right scaling pathway is. Whether it's ZK which Joe has I think a little bit obviously of sound like skepticism of whether it's going to be optimistic. It's it's know, we're early stage venture investors like Joe and we're underwriting a number of different early stage approaches the majority of which won't work out. And so I just wish that the dialogue was a little less extreme about hey, this roadmap is certainly going to work and this is the path. But I think the advantage Ethereum has is there's also so much capital, so much developer talent trying.
00:48:36.018 - 00:49:13.020, Speaker E: Their biggest advantage is this meme of modularity means that people feel tremendously comfortable experimenting in so many disparate ways and it really is actually remarkable and it's beautiful to watch. And actually, I think you're going to need less coordination than people think because I do actually think we're going to have call it power law winners. And you actually won't see, there will be wars in the future because there won't be cooperation. There won't be social coordination in my mind to ultimately arrive at what the kind of, like, default ethereum stack is.
00:49:14.430 - 00:49:43.570, Speaker F: Yeah and you can already kind of see this with terms like Ethereum alignment. So I want to zoom out a little bit and take a grander look at the state of startups and the state of venture capital. Obviously interest rates are not zero anymore. This has exposed some startups profitability maybe is now more important. We're in a bear market, all these sorts of things. I was having a chat with an investor actually the other day and they said all these VCs have been kind of sidelined the whole year. They just kept skipping deals.
00:49:43.570 - 00:49:54.986, Speaker F: Now you kind of had to deploy like it's your job to deploy and now we're kind of in the final quarter of the year. How do you guys see the state of venture capital as it pertains to crypto right now?
00:49:55.088 - 00:49:57.914, Speaker D: What is the outlook there? Yeah.
00:49:57.952 - 00:50:59.406, Speaker E: So I'll start I think that Fred Wilson who's one of the greats has said, look, I'll just take a year off here and even traders know and crypto is really interesting because crypto venture is a mixture actually of early stage patient, long term investing but also, hey, I'm in positions that are liquid. What do I do with them? And there are long periods of time where you actually should do nothing. So we call capital. True venture capital firms call capital as needed and the LPs or the investors in our fund actually don't want us to call capital at times that we're not deploying and they're comfortable waiting for us. We have a five year investment period to deploy. They're okay if we take 6912 months off because we don't think it's an investable market. I think hedge funds are different for us as an early stage venture investor, we don't have that pressure to deploy and frankly, we have deployed 40% of our fund.
00:50:59.406 - 00:51:11.182, Speaker E: We have an obligation to really work with those startups that we've invested in that for example, hey, some might not be seeing the demand they expected. How do we get them to the next cycle?
00:51:11.246 - 00:51:11.810, Speaker D: Right?
00:51:11.960 - 00:52:15.106, Speaker E: And I would say it has been a slower deployment period for us and I think for many investors, early stage investors over the last six months. And the main reason is you're investing on these time horizons. At the early stage you're saying, hey, we are underwriting call it twelve to 24 months of operations so that you can get to the next set of milestones. And I would say if you're looking at crypto infrastructure, it's not clear that there's going to be business demand or developer demand for that infrastructure. It's getting maybe a little bit more clear today than it was six or nine months ago. And certainly on the consumer application side, it's really hard to get confidence for most things that we're seeing that there will be strong demand within a kind of twelve month time horizon. Meaning, okay, I'm building this consumer application, users start to come in in twelve months and then, hey, I have 24 months of runway total, so I have six months to kind of grow and then I've got a raise because now I'm getting close to the end of my runway.
00:52:15.106 - 00:52:55.610, Speaker E: So I think you're going to see activity pick up, but I don't expect a rush of early stage investing activity over the next couple of months. I think what I'm seeing now, having my partners go to some conferences, going to developer events, having conversations like this, talking to entrepreneurs and fellow investors is there's a tremendous amount of energy, there's a lot of ideas going on. People who are already funded continue to build, but I think people are aligning against and we could talk about this maybe in a follow up question. Some themes that I think are emerging as to what is the next set of applications that we think people will use when they get confidence in crypto in 2024?
00:52:55.620 - 00:53:07.554, Speaker D: 2025? Yeah, I also agree with pretty much everything Mike said. I think a couple of things I'll add is asymmetric we also are not.
00:53:07.612 - 00:53:26.400, Speaker A: Under some hardcore deployment schedule where we have actually, since day one had a pretty militant due diligence framework irrespective of market conditions. And so I'll have founders reach out to me and say my deal is closing in five days.
00:53:26.930 - 00:53:29.086, Speaker D: And I'm like, cool, we're just not.
00:53:29.108 - 00:53:41.506, Speaker A: Going to be able to invest. I wish you the best, but we don't operate that way. We didn't operate that way during the FOMO moment of crypto. We don't operate in the bear market that way either. I think part of the reason is.
00:53:41.608 - 00:53:46.002, Speaker D: That the investments that we do want to make.
00:53:46.136 - 00:54:09.338, Speaker A: We actually want to be involved in the process as well as be very close to what the founder is actually doing and what they're actually going through with what they're building. And so we have actually taken a measured approach. We've done deals this year for sure. And actually we just signed another deal this week and wrote a check.
00:54:09.504 - 00:54:16.586, Speaker D: So I think the beauty, though, is that as investors, I should say Mike.
00:54:16.618 - 00:54:32.446, Speaker A: And I are both former entrepreneurs, right? The pendulum has definitely swung back to investors in terms of who has the leverage, no doubt about. And I was talking with a founder yesterday I'm an advisor to, he's getting a little bit frustrated because he's like, man, I've got a handful of leads.
00:54:32.478 - 00:54:35.554, Speaker D: But no one's really bringing it across.
00:54:35.592 - 00:54:36.386, Speaker A: The goal line here.
00:54:36.408 - 00:54:38.470, Speaker D: I'm like, VCs are lazy.
00:54:39.450 - 00:55:02.726, Speaker A: They're not on your time frame, right? Like a startup CEO is just turbo 100% of the time, right? VCs are not. And especially as the leverage has swung towards VCs, that means they can take their time, that means they can wait you out. Some VCs have certain approaches to business that I don't agree with. I don't think Mike agrees with that. Wait it out, we'll bleed you out.
00:55:02.768 - 00:55:02.926, Speaker D: Right?
00:55:02.948 - 00:55:34.760, Speaker A: Like, these types of things are starting to surface a little bit. And I always caution a lot of entrepreneurs to avoid those types of investors, but it's inevitable because, look, at the end of the day, VCs, their job is to generate returns for the LPs. And I think as founders genuinely understand that you want to make sure that you're getting in business with someone that is aligned with your vision, but also you respect what their business actually is. And so I would actually argue that.
00:55:35.210 - 00:55:37.910, Speaker D: I think for the rest of the year agree.
00:55:37.980 - 00:56:08.814, Speaker A: I don't think you're going to see some massive uptick in early stage investment, certainly late stage either. However, I would say if you zoom out of the United States, there's stuff happening globally that's pretty powerful as it relates to crypto and Web Three. And so a handful of examples. One, in Japan, earlier this week, they announced that startups can actually issue tokens to venture capital funds as a form of legal investment.
00:56:08.942 - 00:56:12.100, Speaker D: That's a huge event, right.
00:56:14.390 - 00:56:19.830, Speaker A: In Southeast Asia. Grab, which is like the Uber of Southeast Asia, 200 million users.
00:56:20.490 - 00:56:22.950, Speaker D: There's a crypto wallet in there now, right?
00:56:23.020 - 00:56:44.958, Speaker A: Now, all of a sudden, 200 million users, whether they want to or not, or even know, have access to crypto in some capacity. Mercado Libre is now doing the same thing with USDC. So I think that there's stuff that's happening globally if we zoom out of the US. Even though, yes, the majority of the founders are coming from the US.
00:56:45.124 - 00:56:48.862, Speaker D: That at a global scale, you're seeing.
00:56:48.916 - 00:56:55.218, Speaker A: Enough kind of momentum or starting engine of the momentum for things that can.
00:56:55.384 - 00:56:58.946, Speaker D: Enable these kind of consumer applications that.
00:56:58.968 - 00:57:02.910, Speaker A: Mike is describing, that he and I are both searching for that are going to be huge winners.
00:57:02.990 - 00:57:08.130, Speaker D: Right. So we don't want know, take the year off.
00:57:08.200 - 00:57:08.786, Speaker A: I don't want to.
00:57:08.808 - 00:57:10.486, Speaker D: I mean, Fred Wilson, I don't even.
00:57:10.508 - 00:57:19.980, Speaker A: Know why he works anymore. Probably because he loves it. But I'm definitely not taking the year off. Mike's definitely not taking the year off. And I think it's really more about.
00:57:21.310 - 00:57:25.702, Speaker D: Being cognizant of the kind of negative.
00:57:25.766 - 00:57:28.074, Speaker A: Feedback loop that comes with a down market.
00:57:28.192 - 00:57:32.138, Speaker D: People have this negative wealth effect when.
00:57:32.144 - 00:57:53.490, Speaker A: They see their own personal net worth going down, they're less likely to make investments. And that is absolutely true of venture capitalists as well. I try to counter that with just maintaining a consistency with the types of deals that we want to go after and maintaining that kind of militant due diligence that we apply to each one of our deals. Yeah, exactly.
00:57:53.560 - 00:58:15.814, Speaker E: You have to be mentally if you don't stay constantly mentally prepared and in the loop in crypto, you're done. You take three months off, you've lost it. You've missed the fact that Visa has said that Solana is a blockchain that they think is potentially perhaps the most performant for future payments use cases.
00:58:15.862 - 00:58:16.074, Speaker D: Right.
00:58:16.112 - 00:58:57.170, Speaker E: Because of low transaction fees, parallel processing, local fee markets, instantaneous settlement. If you take time off and you're not in the know, you don't realize that there's been like a pretty strong C shift in credibility that will then lead to other large corporations as well as, know, looking at solana for payments use cases which will open up. We've already started to see it pitches on different remittance concepts and things of that nature which three or four months ago would have been a much harder sell. So just using that as an example of you have to have that prepared mind, particularly in crypto where things change at a dime.
00:58:57.330 - 00:58:57.654, Speaker D: Yes.
00:58:57.692 - 00:59:06.278, Speaker C: As you're looking for, these applications are going to take off. I am curious, what sectors or applications are you looking at right now that's maybe going to catch your eye in let's just say 2024.
00:59:06.444 - 00:59:07.654, Speaker D: The only thing I'd add to that.
00:59:07.692 - 00:59:20.346, Speaker C: Which I always think about in crypto is like in internet age, distribution is free, but discovery is not. So it's like also when you're thinking about these applications, how do you think about that? Because that always draws me back to wallets, but maybe it's more about go to market. So I'm curious.
00:59:20.378 - 00:59:21.230, Speaker D: Your thoughts.
00:59:21.970 - 00:59:49.894, Speaker A: Yeah, I can start. So I'm sure Mike probably shares this view, but that's why I wanted to jump in so that you have to say something different. Mike, I think the biggest opportunity is mobile. It just seems so patently obvious to me. I've been saying this all year long. I really genuinely think if you look at the pattern that existed previously, 1012 years ago when the iPhone came out.
00:59:49.932 - 00:59:52.886, Speaker D: And Android followed suit, the types of.
00:59:52.908 - 00:59:57.222, Speaker A: Applications that got built just weren't even possible.
00:59:57.356 - 00:59:57.750, Speaker D: Right?
00:59:57.820 - 01:00:27.602, Speaker A: And so as we can somehow, whether it's through Saga, whether it's through Google and Apple, opening up the APIs and secure Enclave to enable crypto signing, whatever the thing may actually be, maybe it's through the browser, I don't know. I think as we get closer to mobile first web Three applications, that's the huge unlock. And so could it happen this year? Probably not.
01:00:27.656 - 01:00:28.902, Speaker D: Could it happen next year?
01:00:29.036 - 01:00:44.218, Speaker A: Possibly, but it's going to happen at some point. And to Mike's point about having a prepared mind that's the area where we're constantly trying to keep a pulse on is mobile because it shouldn't be a surprise to you, right? Like, think about how many times a.
01:00:44.224 - 01:00:49.018, Speaker D: Day you look at your iPhone. I'm willing to bet it's 100, maybe.
01:00:49.104 - 01:01:07.886, Speaker A: 50 on a slow day. And the number of applications on there are probably in the dozens. Now, you may not use all of them, but there are some applications that are literally only possible on a phone. And furthermore, as you start to look at the sensors and things that are available on a phone that just aren't.
01:01:07.918 - 01:01:11.026, Speaker D: Available on a desktop computer, none of.
01:01:11.048 - 01:01:25.634, Speaker A: That has been really tried per se as it relates to Web three. And so I think the applications that will stand out will be the ones that are mobile first and figure it out. I mean, I'm not going to bash.
01:01:25.682 - 01:01:30.422, Speaker D: Friend Tech because it's a pretty rudimentary.
01:01:30.486 - 01:01:55.540, Speaker A: Progressive web app, but that is a path that people are taking right now. And for what it's worth, friendtech has picked up quite a bit of interest in activity and it's not even that good of an application, right? So imagine a really good experience on the phone that is truly crypto native. I think those are going to be huge breakout winners in the next coming years.
01:01:56.390 - 01:01:57.282, Speaker D: Yeah, I would agree.
01:01:57.336 - 01:02:53.458, Speaker E: I mean, looking at frankly, Coinbase wallet, I believe for me it's just become my de facto mobile wallet. Now when I'm using Ethereum or the EVM, it just works. I do believe Phantom is that for solana and I think backpack is getting more and more powerful. Right now we're still at the potential phase. As Joe said, we have X NFTs, we have compressed NFTs, we have the ability to do robust things on metadata and storing things in kind of like an NFT data backpack. We have the ability to send massive amounts of call it gaming NFTs for very low cost. But today I think largely because we just don't have a tremendous number of crypto native, enthusiastic, optimistic users today.
01:02:53.458 - 01:03:25.534, Speaker E: We just haven't seen the tests or the executions that I think we will. Joe said, I don't think we're going to see that scale over the next six months, but definitely we have people fiddling around building. So I'm obviously very optimistic and we've invested in a tremendous number of games over the past few years. I think the biggest learning that we've had is that simplicity matters. I mean, you see it with Rentech. It's like a minimum viable product. The simpler the game.
01:03:25.534 - 01:04:16.270, Speaker E: Right now there's enough complexity with just figuring out how to get the crypto asset and how to interact with the blockchain. So anything we can do to make the game itself and then the dynamics much easier is important. And then I would say I'll be really interested. Obviously we know Multicoin is extremely bullish on Deepen and conceptually. It's just fascinating to think that you can bootstrap these really interesting networks. But I think the next twelve to 18 months are going to tell the story of can we create native demand for these networks and what they're actually producing? So I'm excited to see if that happens. And if so, Solana has a significant number of advantages in terms of being the home for deepin networks.
01:04:16.270 - 01:05:16.110, Speaker E: So we're excited about that. And then obviously we've talked about payments. I think that you're going to, despite the validation of Visa and soon some other really large financial organizations that are building behind the scenes on Salana, you're probably going to need to see another call it twelve months of stability for many of the larger organizations to quote unquote, go all in. And I think that it's important. We're going to need some of the I know it sounds silly in a decentralized world, but one of the advantages that Ethereum still has is paradigm A 16 Z. Coinbase, these giant entrenched organizations with significant money and credibility and institutional support behind them are putting their credibility behind the EVM. And so I'll be interested.
01:05:16.110 - 01:05:32.120, Speaker E: I think Jump really powerful organization and Fire Dancer is a big move forward. I'm hopeful we get more Visas and folks like that. And I think it's really critically important. I think the Solana Labs and foundation folks are starting to really understand that.
01:05:33.450 - 01:05:34.630, Speaker D: Yeah, well said.
01:05:34.780 - 01:05:46.780, Speaker F: Especially agree on the deep end point as being the founder of Helium myself. So for people who don't get that joke, bankless referred to me today as the founder of Helium since my company's name is Helios. Sounds similar.
01:05:47.230 - 01:05:49.450, Speaker A: Congratulations on your promotion.
01:05:50.030 - 01:05:52.590, Speaker E: Thank you. A lot to manage, buddy.
01:05:54.130 - 01:05:58.640, Speaker F: All right, let's do some rapid fire. Garrett, unless you have some final questions.
01:05:59.170 - 01:06:19.186, Speaker C: I've got one question then let's do the rapid fire. So Mike, this is really direct at you, but Joe, if you have any comments on it, let's do it. So you started the Block, I think, in 2018. I work at Blockworks as a media company right now. Curious about you talked about like telling the story of crypto and can we get new users. A big part of that is media. What you think of the media landscape today in crypto? You have decrypt.
01:06:19.186 - 01:06:24.866, Speaker C: I think they're kind of leaning into AI now. CoinDesk is going through an acquisition, not really sure what's going on the Block.
01:06:24.898 - 01:06:27.406, Speaker D: Yeah, what do you think about media today in crypto?
01:06:27.538 - 01:06:48.110, Speaker E: Yeah, it's really difficult to run a quote unquote crypto media business. The amount of sort of like gaslighting and skepticism and you name it, about facts by participants in these markets.
01:06:50.530 - 01:06:51.450, Speaker A: It'S insane.
01:06:51.530 - 01:07:26.374, Speaker E: Right. You state something that is like an empirical fact and 70% of people are going to be like, you're a sheep and you're just falling man. It's really hard to present objective, credible information in the crypto landscape. You're constantly being sabotaged and undermined. So I don't know that it's possible to change that. I think you have to kind of work within the parameters of what's possible meaning. I really do think to be a successful crypto media organization, you have to be default optimistic.
01:07:26.374 - 01:07:59.938, Speaker E: You have to be a partner to good companies, good projects, good protocols, and good peoples, and do your best to amplify. Amplify is different than cheerleading. And I think the problem is we have a lot of cheerleading and we have organizations masquerading as media organizations that frankly are just literally paid shills. And so I think you named the ones that I believe have really good ethics and do the best job possible. CoinDesk. The block. Decrypt and blockworks.
01:07:59.938 - 01:08:49.480, Speaker E: The Blockworks guys, incredible respect for them, their persistence, and they've been really smart about branching out into every type of media and also not being maximalists. It's essential that you're not viewed as a maximalist to any one technology approach. But I genuinely don't really believe there's ever going to be a Bloomberg of crypto. I don't think there's going to be a massive media organization, a Wall Street Journal that comes out. And the reason is there's just so much money to be made if you're a practitioner here, I just can't imagine why somebody would spend their time I certainly didn't want to spend their time reporting on things. When you can get in there and get your arms, roll up your sleeves and build stuff.
01:08:50.090 - 01:08:52.870, Speaker D: This is permissionless, get after it.
01:08:52.940 - 01:09:12.480, Speaker E: So I think they're going to be capped. And I think the best media of the future is frankly going to be shows like this. It's wonderful that Blockworks gives you guys a platform and others a platform to do it and to get real practitioners their own voice. I think that's the model of the future.
01:09:13.570 - 01:09:14.526, Speaker D: Yeah, I love that.
01:09:14.548 - 01:09:19.982, Speaker C: I think all content creators eventually become seed. Investors tend to get involved on the operational on the outside.
01:09:20.036 - 01:09:34.866, Speaker E: Bet started a fund. I know they're separate, but look, I actually appreciate again, I want people to be advocates and to be supportive of the technology that they're reporting on.
01:09:34.968 - 01:09:49.174, Speaker C: Yeah, well, to Shill Blockworks, I've been a huge fan of working there, and I couldn't agree with you more about the not being maxi towards any one. Technology I think is my favorite part about working this company. So I appreciate the nice words because I look good for my bosses, but yeah.
01:09:49.372 - 01:09:52.170, Speaker D: Do you want to do rapid fire now? Yes, sir.
01:09:52.320 - 01:10:02.560, Speaker F: All right. Let's just do some quick rapid fire in order. Let's just go with Joe and then Mike every time, just to make it predictable. Let's have some fun.
01:10:03.170 - 01:10:03.920, Speaker D: Okay.
01:10:04.370 - 01:10:07.470, Speaker F: What is the most overrated idea in crypto?
01:10:08.610 - 01:10:13.540, Speaker D: Oh, shit. I'm going to go with L two S.
01:10:15.590 - 01:10:20.530, Speaker E: I'm going to go with bitcoin, ordinals and NFTs.
01:10:21.670 - 01:10:28.118, Speaker C: I just got to add that Joe has a statement. Joe has a statement that he says, what is it? It's like L two S just means two more problems.
01:10:28.204 - 01:10:28.454, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:10:28.492 - 01:10:31.320, Speaker A: The reason it's called an L two is because now you have two problems.
01:10:32.170 - 01:10:33.046, Speaker D: Oh, man.
01:10:33.148 - 01:10:38.760, Speaker F: Mike, do you mean NFTs on bitcoin? You think overrated or NFTs in general?
01:10:39.290 - 01:10:41.714, Speaker E: Bitcoin ordinals and NFTs on bitcoin?
01:10:41.762 - 01:10:42.118, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:10:42.204 - 01:10:51.466, Speaker E: And close behind, that would be Bitcoin DeFi. Outside of just like, basic borrow and lend of this store value asset that I have, I just don't see advanced.
01:10:51.498 - 01:10:53.070, Speaker A: DeFi happening on bitcoin.
01:10:54.290 - 01:10:56.430, Speaker F: What is your favorite vertical in crypto?
01:11:00.770 - 01:11:03.070, Speaker D: Man? Favorite vertical?
01:11:05.330 - 01:11:10.770, Speaker A: I mean, this is lame, but I think trading is my favorite.
01:11:12.070 - 01:11:14.740, Speaker D: And you said vertical. Yeah.
01:11:16.470 - 01:11:29.530, Speaker E: Look, my favorite is payments. And I worked at Paxos on the stablecoin business for a year. It's what got me into it, and I think it's what changes the world. And when I say payments, I really mean value exchange and money movement globally.
01:11:30.270 - 01:11:33.498, Speaker D: What's the number one or what is.
01:11:33.504 - 01:11:36.220, Speaker F: The worst mistake that seed stage founders make?
01:11:38.750 - 01:11:46.560, Speaker D: MMM. Oh, my God, there's so many.
01:11:47.970 - 01:11:50.000, Speaker A: The worst mistake that they make?
01:11:52.470 - 01:11:53.620, Speaker D: I would say.
01:11:56.230 - 01:11:57.780, Speaker A: Hiring too fast.
01:11:59.910 - 01:12:00.274, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:12:00.312 - 01:12:09.378, Speaker E: I would say waiting too long. What I've seen waiting too long to get the product out and trying to make it too perfect before getting in the hands of folks who may use it.
01:12:09.464 - 01:12:10.482, Speaker D: That's a good one.
01:12:10.616 - 01:12:39.422, Speaker C: So Crypto Twitter is big. I think a lot of my friends that aren't in crypto are like, why are you still on Twitter? I'm curious, how do you talk about to your portfolio companies about basically go to market using Twitter? And Mike kind of adding to that. I know when you started the block, I think your team was pretty well known for being on Twitter all the time, which got a lot of engagement, probably also got a lot of pushback. And you actually regularly delete your tweets now because of that. So I'm curious, when do you encourage your portfolio companies to use Twitter and when should they back off?
01:12:39.476 - 01:12:40.160, Speaker E: I guess.
01:12:43.410 - 01:12:52.914, Speaker A: I think it is let me back up. I think having a communications plan with.
01:12:52.952 - 01:12:58.034, Speaker D: Twitter as part of that is important. Yeah, I was going to say same thing.
01:12:58.072 - 01:13:31.230, Speaker E: Look, like Twitter is not for everybody. You have to have a go to market plan. Social media is usually a pretty good part of that because a lot of your customers are going to be using social media, but you have to use the channels that are native and Natural For You. If you're an extremely shy person or an extremely aggressive person, you're going to have a different strategy. And so I definitely made significant mistakes. You mentioned it with the block being, frankly, too aggressive, too quote, unquote angry. It was intentional, but it was immature.
01:13:31.230 - 01:13:38.478, Speaker E: So I definitely recommend that folks don't do that. It really is damaging long term.
01:13:38.574 - 01:13:43.106, Speaker D: If you're too adversarial publicly, what is.
01:13:43.128 - 01:13:45.830, Speaker F: The number one quality you look for in a founder?
01:13:46.810 - 01:13:47.750, Speaker D: Grit.
01:13:49.850 - 01:13:52.470, Speaker E: Absolute. Just like passion and conviction.
01:13:52.890 - 01:13:55.350, Speaker F: What's number one quality you look for in a startup?
01:13:56.810 - 01:13:57.670, Speaker D: Hmm.
01:14:03.310 - 01:14:08.810, Speaker A: Had to pick one. I would probably also go with the founder or founders.
01:14:09.150 - 01:14:09.986, Speaker D: Yeah, literally.
01:14:10.038 - 01:14:17.950, Speaker E: A founder who I think is inevitable. Success is inevitable for this person. We're people first. Investors.
01:14:18.930 - 01:14:24.740, Speaker F: If you had to convince somebody who hates crypto to try crypto, what app would you show them?
01:14:27.670 - 01:14:31.380, Speaker D: I would show them sell inside of a banking app.
01:14:34.950 - 01:14:41.110, Speaker A: No, seriously, I'm not even making this up. Last night. I was working with a very close friend of mine.
01:14:42.730 - 01:14:46.054, Speaker D: We were trying to do some has.
01:14:46.092 - 01:14:54.666, Speaker A: Nothing to do with crypto little investment together. And I was trying to send him a whopping $10,000 through Sell, and it.
01:14:54.688 - 01:14:57.020, Speaker D: Just you couldn't do it.
01:14:57.470 - 01:15:07.680, Speaker A: And then I said, you have a coinbase account, right? And he said, yeah, I'm like, I'm going to send you $10,000 in USDC right now. And he was like, wow, I've never done this before.
01:15:08.370 - 01:15:10.478, Speaker D: I mean, that's the light bulb moment.
01:15:10.564 - 01:15:15.858, Speaker A: And I've mentioned this in the past that I think Stablecoins are like a killer app. Killer Protocol. Exactly.
01:15:15.944 - 01:15:17.106, Speaker D: For this reason.
01:15:17.288 - 01:15:27.142, Speaker A: The most basic thing with value transferred to Mike's point about payments. You get that, right? It's a light bulb moment for so many people to be like, wow, this.
01:15:27.196 - 01:15:29.270, Speaker D: Banking system is kind of broken.
01:15:29.850 - 01:15:34.840, Speaker A: Yes, the coinbase commercials are correct. Yeah.
01:15:37.630 - 01:16:05.118, Speaker E: I still think Uniswap is just absolute magic. And just being able to go in there and instantaneously trade any of thousands or maybe tens of thousands of assets. The newest one that I love that's magic is code. The payments app on Solana. I've talked to them. I hope that they move towards Stablecoin as the settlement unit, but I think that's a magical app. And then I'm obviously pretty biased to step in.
01:16:05.118 - 01:16:15.060, Speaker E: I just think it's just so much fun to buy an NFT, play a little game while I'm walking. It encourages me to move. And hey, earn a few pennies here and there.
01:16:15.430 - 01:16:24.310, Speaker F: I was actually on a call with Code before this. They're looking something new soon. That's going to be pretty fun. Okay, two final questions. What is your favorite NFT collection?
01:16:26.730 - 01:16:27.254, Speaker D: For me.
01:16:27.292 - 01:16:29.260, Speaker A: It's Solana monkey business.
01:16:30.270 - 01:16:30.634, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:16:30.672 - 01:16:32.490, Speaker E: For me. It's crypto, punks.
01:16:33.150 - 01:16:43.600, Speaker F: Yeah, that's an easy one. Okay. Well, you guys are both founders, but also you talk to a lot of founders. What is one piece of advice you'd give to crypto founders during this market?
01:16:47.570 - 01:16:51.006, Speaker D: Um, hang in there.
01:16:51.108 - 01:16:55.120, Speaker A: Don't throw in the towel, because if you do, you'll never get to raise money again.
01:16:56.290 - 01:16:56.702, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:16:56.756 - 01:17:14.840, Speaker E: And and I would say don't get impatient and make an unforced error. You don't have to be doing something at every moment. And I've seen a few folks kind of panic and be like, I need to do a new thing every three, four weeks. I say, slow down.
01:17:16.090 - 01:17:27.794, Speaker C: Love those answers. Add grit to the end of it's. Grit week every week at lightspeed. So, joe and mike, thanks so much for joining two gigabrains. This is a lot of fun. I loved learning and listening to you guys before this. And this is an awesome conversation.
01:17:27.794 - 01:17:32.814, Speaker C: I'd love to have you both on. And, I don't know, few months, the space moves so quickly. So thanks again for coming on.
01:17:32.932 - 01:17:33.214, Speaker A: Sure.
01:17:33.252 - 01:17:33.598, Speaker D: Amazing.
01:17:33.684 - 01:17:34.974, Speaker E: Thank you, guys. Really appreciate it.
01:17:35.012 - 01:17:35.646, Speaker A: Thanks, guys.
01:17:35.748 - 01:17:37.200, Speaker C: Yes. We'll see you next time.
