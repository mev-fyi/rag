00:00:00.330 - 00:00:34.070, Speaker A: If we are limited by bandwidth right now, in two years, there's going to be twice as much. Maybe we'll need twice as many cores to drive it because there's twice as much data to sign and cryptographically verify. But these are all Moore's Law problems that just kind of solve themselves. But what we need to make sure in the design is that we can always increase the bandwidth. Like, if we if the bet if the network capacities go to 100 gigabit in like, four or five years, that every data center that kind of R and a bunch of them already, then Salana could run at 100 gigabit. We don't really care. Like, we shouldn't be limited by the design.
00:00:34.070 - 00:01:11.278, Speaker A: We should be limited by the hardware. If you kind of design around that, you have a very, very scalable system. It's very elastic to demand up to that limit of hardware. That's really the final bottleneck. And I think we've done a pretty good job with the design because what I see is that the fire Dancer folks, without having to make any design changes, are showing much higher throughput by just doing straightforward, okay, you guys had to ship this thing as fast as you could. Let us rewrite it in a better, more scalable, kind of just raw software architecture way, and they can really demonstrate that all the components can scale very elastically with hardware.

Welcome to another episode of Lightspeed. Today we are joined by Anatoli from Solana. Anatoli, thanks for joining us.
00:01:39.648 - 00:01:42.186, Speaker A: Thank you for having yeah, yeah, we.
00:01:42.208 - 00:02:14.870, Speaker B: Are pumped to have you on. I've been studying more and more about Solana, and every time I do, I get more excited. So I want to start high level to set the scene and really frame the conversation. So when looking at all the different design choices in crypto, it's easy to really get caught up on what you're building or what's being built and not why it's being built. So I want to start with the end with Solana. Like, what is the Solana thesis? What is it built to enable? And I think that will then lead to why you went with an integrated global state machine and not a chain that relies on sharding state with roll ups, but instead relies on ever increasing bandwidth and compute.
00:02:15.370 - 00:03:07.126, Speaker A: So what I thought was really cool about crypto was that it enabled permissionless markets. And if you've ever traded in any permission markets, I traded, like, as a total amateur. I had connections to interactive brokers and a bunch of other places, and I would run my algorithms. Every time I thought that I had alpha, my data would arrive a little slower and my orders would be submitted a little slower and just felt like everybody was always getting ahead of me. And that's because those are not fair markets. And what makes them unfair is that there is centralized actors that get the information before you. They get to submit the information ahead of you, and that creates massive amounts of value capture for them and losses for somebody, an amateur like me.
00:03:07.126 - 00:04:14.638, Speaker A: So what I think is really cool about permissionless systems is that they can create fairness. And the whole purpose of Solana that I thought was really at least it would be valuable to the world is that we can create fair markets at the core information level, meaning that bits are transmitted everywhere around the world as equally and fairly to everybody and concurrently at the same time as physics allow. And that submission is also as fair and competitive as physics allow. So those are kind of the two problems that we set out to solve. And I think this is very different than most of probably every other crypto project that start out at that time, because they started from either the store of value narrative of Bitcoin we want to build a decentralized money or settlement guarantees. We want to build a decentralized settlement layer, and none of those really care about when the information arrives, who gets to submit it. All those problems are secondary, and they're interesting problems.
00:04:14.638 - 00:04:43.222, Speaker A: But I think what most people don't realize is if you build this perfect information system, settlement is free. It's just inherently part of it. Solving this much harder problem actually solves all the other ones. So that's really, I think, kind of our goal. Solana's vision is to be that perfect single state machine that everyone can rely on for fair access to the data and kind of see it as a source of truth for the world.
00:04:43.356 - 00:05:00.460, Speaker C: So obviously the information syncing globally at the speed of light is kind of the big, let's say, KPI that you're optimizing for. It's not, obviously. And with that said, the first pitch for Salon, the elevator pitch, the catchy slogan was Nasdaq at the speed of light. So my first question.
00:05:02.930 - 00:05:05.680, Speaker A: Okay, I came up with it.
00:05:08.690 - 00:05:14.190, Speaker C: Is that still, you think, how people should talk about Solana?
00:05:15.090 - 00:05:58.960, Speaker A: I think there's kind of a bit of a trap there to think of it only in terms of trading. This is something that I realized as building. This is that building like a Nasdaq competitor and going out there and trying to get stocks listed. I think that could be like a thing that people do. But I think that's a very small part of web three. I think the fact that you have open permissionless markets really disrupts how the web is monetized, how people coordinate globally and all the kind of really cool web. Three things that you want to do that I think are much more revolutionary know, reducing the amount of take that like Citadel and Nasdaq has.
00:05:58.960 - 00:06:45.882, Speaker A: They're just much higher impact than that. If everybody in the world has a cryptographic key and they know what to do with it, they know how to sign and coordinate the Dow that's effectively full global democracy. Full global direct democracy. Like people can direct funds right with that they can all deposit into a Dow that says we're going to buy every coal plant on the planet and shut them down. And if people know that that will actually happen, I think they will actually throw $1,000 in there and that very quickly can become very meaningful change that is enacted through this. So I think crypto is just much bigger than markets. But what makes crypto interesting, I think is the fact that people have cryptography.
00:06:45.882 - 00:07:39.486, Speaker A: This is, I think Vitalik had a quote that I think cryptography is the first time that defense has an asymmetric advantage over offense. It's not just like you cannot break it with an atomic bomb, you cannot break Ft 519 signature. This is kind of like the really cool thing about it that it will take infinite energy to go break that key. And that's really cool and I think that's a very empowering thing. And I honestly think that if we could give humans the cryptographic keys, the networks will just emerge from that, the blockchains, all the stuff. I think those are implementation details to a large degree. The way that I'm interested in attacking the coordination problem is through the thing that I'm good at, which is like low latency optimizations, making things fast.
00:07:39.486 - 00:07:52.900, Speaker A: And I think a chain that focuses on that, on synchronizing state, the least amount of overhead as possible has a place in that world where everyone has cryptographic keys and they're doing stuff on chain with them.
00:07:53.990 - 00:08:20.990, Speaker C: So my second question, and you kind of answered it as well, is so you mentioned that the other chains maybe start from a place of like settlement, which I believe you think is the most boring part of finance store of value, like Bitcoin, the sovereign aspect. But then yours is globally shared state, which is actually a pretty abstract concept. I know some people who aren't too familiar with maybe what that means to sell it.
00:08:21.060 - 00:08:27.120, Speaker A: How do I sell it to somebody that's like this is digital gold. I'm like that's cool.
00:08:28.930 - 00:08:44.210, Speaker C: Exactly. So that leads me to my question, which is how do you rally people around globally shared state? How do you know there's PMF? Do people care? What makes you think that's the right direction to pursue?
00:08:46.010 - 00:09:41.906, Speaker A: Well, I know that it eliminates ways for this arbitrage kind of, I think parasitic value capture. Like when the system gets faster, lower, latency, more competitive in terms of who can write, the amount of opportunities for somebody to extract unfair value goes away. And that's really important to all the DeFi nerds. I think the reason why Solana has a resilient DeFi community that's been able to take these major hits is because they get that vision that they know that if I build a project here, I'm not going to get screwed by all these intermediaries that can extract massive amounts of math. And they inherently don't want that. That's bad for their users. Math seems like a good thing, right on Ethereum, because there's this idea that fees are good, but that's actually value that's extracted from the user.
00:09:41.906 - 00:10:27.080, Speaker A: There's zero chance that Senator Warren at the SEC would allow Nasdaq to take the kind of fees Ethereum does. They would shut that down instantly. All those regulators have created everything around finance in the United States to prevent that kind of fee extraction from occurring. So I think for crypto to be competitive, it has to be better than the existing regulatory systems. Not just better because it's open and permissionless, but actually better. It's got to be cheaper, faster, more open. And then I think it can kind of start replacing those systems and add value to the world.
00:10:28.090 - 00:10:41.320, Speaker B: Yeah, 100% agree. Let's talk about some of the ways that Salon is actually going about doing that. You've said that the final bottleneck is DA bandwidth. What do you mean by that? And how does it apply to how performant Salon is trying to be?
00:10:41.770 - 00:11:24.034, Speaker A: So this was an intuition that I had early on. We didn't even call it data availability bandwidth. It was really just this idea that the chain you have a quorum, right, this network of nodes that all have to synchronize the state that's the current active set of nodes in the quorum as fast as they can synchronize that state is going to be limited by the slowest one third of the network. Your Byzantine threshold, whatever, however many you need, you need to get to consensus. That slowest one third is going to limit the throughput. So you have to basically optimize and increase that throughput. And what's cool is that when you increase that throughput, you can increase the quorum.
00:11:24.034 - 00:12:35.514, Speaker A: Because what's very trivial to build, a very dumb consensus thing you can build is that every node votes and propagates that vote to everyone else as just part of the way the chain normally schedules all the transactions and all the events. This is why Solana consensus is implemented as a native Solana program, like a smart contract. And that's why votes are normal transactions, is because when you increase TPS and capacity and therefore the data availability bandwidth at each node, you can actually just add more nodes and increase your quorum. And therefore that number of users that are getting the data that's around the world increases and you have a fair and more open system, it becomes harder for you to delay the data from any part of the world and therefore extract value, right, information value from that. So this is a very kind of like brute force approach because it's not algorithmic. It's very much based on if we are limited by bandwidth right now, in two years there's going to be twice as much. Maybe we'll need twice as many cores to drive it because there's twice as much data to sign and cryptographically verify.
00:12:35.514 - 00:13:06.022, Speaker A: But these are all Moore's Law problems that just kind of solve themselves. But what we need to make sure in the design is that we can always increase the bandwidth. Like if the network capacities go to 100 gigabit in like four or five years at every data center there kind of are and a bunch of them already, then Salana could run at 100 gigabit. We don't really care. We shouldn't be limited by the design. We should be limited by the hardware. And if you kind of design around that, you have a very scalable system.
00:13:06.022 - 00:13:43.854, Speaker A: It's very elastic to demand up to that limit of hardware. So that's really the final bottleneck. And I think we've done a pretty good job with the design because what I see is that the Fire Dancer folks, without having to make any design changes, are showing much higher throughput by just doing straightforward, okay, you guys had to ship this as fast as you could. Let us rewrite it in a better, more scalable, kind of just raw software architecture way. And they can really demonstrate that all the components can scale very elastically with hardware.
00:13:43.982 - 00:14:20.830, Speaker C: I'm sure you saw this recently on X.com that people think that all blockchains and obviously all computers do benefit from hardware advancements and bandwidth advancements and whatnot, but what I said was that solana benefits, the benefit that you get from each chain is not proportional. They're not the same thing. Can you describe how you think about that? When the hardware increases, the improvements are made. Do all blockchains benefit the not? You know, how should we think about it?
00:14:20.980 - 00:14:56.522, Speaker A: It really depends. Like that kind of idea. I kind of made a response to your post saying that it shouldn't be that Salana is scaling with hardware, it's that hardware is all you need. And this really came from my experience at Qualcomm. I was there from 2003 until 2015 or something like that. And this was when we went from flip phones to smartphones. And literally every year we had an architecture change at the CPU and a process change.
00:14:56.522 - 00:15:47.718, Speaker A: And Arm was getting better. It's just, it felt like Moore's Law wasn't even going at 18 months interval. It was like a twelve month interval time and it was pretty crazy. And if you didn't write your software in such a way that it's just going to get better by the next chip, you have to rewrite it. So it was like a waste of time to build it in a way that doesn't scale well with more hardware. And that was just really burned into me as I was doing the software development, trying to keep up with the hardware improvements. That's kind of like the idea there is that because hardware can scale at this exponential pace, if you design your software such that it just naturally takes advantage of it, whatever inefficiencies you have in the algorithm, maybe there's an algorithm that's just way more efficient in some parameter.
00:15:47.718 - 00:16:30.710, Speaker A: They just shrink. They just become marginally, irrelevant. So all the time you're wasting trying to optimize for squeeze out extra percentages right now they should just do analysis, figure out where you're not scaling with the number of cores and fix that. Because literally in two years you're going to have twice as many cores and those other optimizations are going to be half as important. And this is kind of this exponential curve that humanity is on. My personal belief is if that ever stops, we should all be working on bunker coin. We've hit the limit of human civilization, things are going to get really bad.
00:16:30.710 - 00:17:04.014, Speaker A: So I am an optimist. I don't think we'll ever get there. I personally believe that the number of cores per system, per dollar is going to continue to go up because we're not even stacking them in three dimensions yet. These are still single layer, kind of single CPU. Not everything. Some phones do have stack Ram, but we're super early in terms of how much normal silicon can be pushed. So a lot of other chains do get improvements from hardware.
00:17:04.014 - 00:17:41.422, Speaker A: And I don't want to say that I don't think that's what you meant with your quote. It's just Solana and all of our engineering is specifically tailored around this idea that we need to parallelize and maximize the efficiency across the number of disks, across the number of cores, number of network cards to make sure that in two years when this stuff gets half the price that everything just elastically gets better. And if we achieve that, we're kind of like done with the software architecture. We're done. We can kind of rest easy or probably not. We have to work on all the other stuff in the application layer, which is infinite amount of work.
00:17:41.476 - 00:18:02.790, Speaker B: When you do that, you get to rely on intel and AMD and ISP providers with more bandwidth. Right. One thing that Solana has been known for is parallelizable execution. Why is it that something like Ethereum didn't originally start with parallel execution? And does part of that go into the fact that Solana separates state and programs?
00:18:03.290 - 00:18:53.014, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is, again, from my experience working on embedded systems, like working on DSPs and things like that. If you've ever had to program a DSP or a GPU or even like an AVX pipeline and intel, it's quite different environment. You have to lay out all the memory and all the lanes for a program ahead of time. So you have to know all the dependencies of all the memory accesses ahead. And then you tell the CPU here's the code that you're going to execute across these lanes of memory and then it just zips through them because once it knows the locations of all the dependencies, it can pre fetch all the memory, thus eliminating any kind of speed hit to a missed memory load or something like that. And just everything just runs through the system as fast as possible.
00:18:53.014 - 00:19:35.150, Speaker A: And that's really translating, making the system be as efficient as possible in terms of execution. But that requires a developer to do this work ahead of time. They have to know all the dependencies of all the memory locations and yada, yada, yada. And that obviously eliminates features like global memory that you can just go and call random memory or jump to a random memory location. So the way Solana's runtime is designed is from that idea. The developer does the painful work of figuring out what are all the memory dependencies that the program has and conveys that in the transaction that they constructed. And then the runtime is a very easy job.
00:19:35.150 - 00:20:35.010, Speaker A: It never basically has a cache miss. So then we can schedule all these events and execute everything in parallel. It's been interesting to see how hard it is to do that once you kind of open the Pandora's box and let developers call random locations and do whatever they want with the state. Because just the way that they compose programs once they're given that option is very different and they'll take advantage of it, right? You give them the tools, they will treat everything as a hammer and that becomes very painful to rewrite those systems. So I think parallelism is going to be really hard for EVM. And given that the fact that the way EVM is designed, it almost makes sense that roll ups are the way to go. Because there you're isolating state with tokens and NFTs through a bridge and then you have a little EVM environment that runs on that state that's all global.
00:20:35.010 - 00:20:56.462, Speaker A: Then you have another little EVM environment, another roll up that does its own thing and that's how you do your state separation, right? You've kind of created parallelism that way, but that's a much more it's far less granular, right. You can't compose between these states very easily. Everything becomes much harder on the composition side.
00:20:56.516 - 00:21:55.890, Speaker C: I'm going to ask two questions which won't be that related. So I know you said you have a theory that being able to process multiple things in your head improves the brain hardware or whatnot? First is, having said that, actually L two S are probably the better way for Ethereum to scale. I'm curious on your thoughts about Monad, which seeks to do parallel EVM. And second, it feels like it should be obvious to most seasoned engineers that you want to scale with hardware. Yet I would say you're like one of the I think Solana is probably the first serious attempt at that. And some people will make the argument that well, the reason is because you can't run these systems on retail internets, right? Like at my house you need kind of very strong internet connections and whatnot so that people can maximize the number of nodes running. But then you say to that, well, it doesn't matter how low the requirements are, what matters is the incentives to run it.
00:21:55.890 - 00:21:59.220, Speaker C: How come that seems to be an unpopular view?
00:22:01.670 - 00:22:54.654, Speaker A: Well, I think you have to go back to what you believe is kind of like what is decentralization? Which is a very philosophical question and I'm a philosopher and my belief is that all interesting theories have to be grounded in physical reality. You have to see actually something physical happen for this to be a worthwhile theory to even discuss. So if we're talking about decentralization, how does it manifest itself in the physical world? And from my perspective, the key components of decentralization is that the system is permissionless. Like anyone can participate in it. That means that I can physically create my own box. I don't really care about the cost there. Like the cost could be a barrier.
00:22:54.654 - 00:23:29.322, Speaker A: We could argue about whether $400 a month is too much or $50 a month is like the required amount for decentralization. I think that's almost like if we get to that, if the discussion ends up there, I've already won. Right. But I think the key part is that the system is permissionless. That means anyone can connect to it, anyone can create a box, anyone can create the state. And the other part to it is that there's enough people that give a shit that it's running that even if something fails, they'll continue it. And that latter part is all about the incentive.
00:23:29.322 - 00:24:25.134, Speaker A: So in a system that is very cheap to run and cheap to participate in, I think it works for Ethereum, but this is not going to work for anyone else. It's like if you started a very slow, expensive chain now that no one's participating in, you're not going to get enough incentives for people to actually care that it's running, that they would go and continue it. So you'll fail. On the latter part. The fact that Ethereum has succeeded, I think is because it was early and they created the whole smart contract system and has a lot of very credible, awesome researchers working on it and really working on that towards that goal of settlement. And it has PMF in what it's doing, but there's no way. It's like if somebody else tried to copy Ethereum and launch it, they're going to fail for the same reason that if I tried to launch a bitcoin with slightly bigger blocks or slightly smaller blocks, whatever, right? It's just somebody already captured that part of PMF.
00:24:25.134 - 00:24:32.594, Speaker A: You need to find another incentive structure that will guarantee that people actually care about the state and continue running it.
00:24:32.632 - 00:25:19.490, Speaker B: So Salana is a very performant, technically sound chain and I would say it had a lot of updates through 2022 that went under the radar. And I think a lot of that was with SPF and some network outages and some of those were quick and stakeway to QoS, which we can go into that, but that's really just like network stability. And you had fees, you added priority fee markets, isolated fee markets, which I would like to touch on and how that kind of corresponds to L two S. You also had things like Solaying introduced where you can do solidity on Salana, you can even do move. Now I'm curious, with all that work that you put behind it, how easy is it for this is me being non technical. How easy is it for another ecosystem to almost just copy all those updates that you've had? Because to me, Solana is shipping faster than any other chain out there. And is it really just the community? That's the part that's not able to be forked.
00:25:21.430 - 00:26:00.640, Speaker A: It's like BSD had jails, like I think ten years before Linux had namespaces. Even if all those engineers knew each other, literally were all friends that all get beers together, it's actually really hard to yank stuff from one part of one operating system to another one. So I think some things could be somewhat transferable. I think you could take SVM and run it as a roll up on Ethereum. And I encourage people to do that. I think Eclipse is one of the teams that's doing that. I think we just need more SVM environments out there.
00:26:00.640 - 00:26:32.540, Speaker A: It sounds counterintuitive people think I was competitive with Solana. No, it's great. It's like more people that give a shit about SVM. They'll create more value for the entire Solana ecosystem. Like know, I think those kinds of pieces can be ported over. I think the other pieces you really have to understand what impact they have and apply them directly in your design. And the real challenge to what I found in building the system is that there's almost like an Amdel's fight.
00:26:32.540 - 00:27:20.780, Speaker A: If you're familiar with Amdel's law, it means that you have a complex system and you look at all the components that create friction or create a cost, right? A compute cost or latency cost, and you try to optimize one of them. Even if you make that thing 100 times faster, because of all the other parts of the system, the overall impact is very marginal. You have that effect across everything. You can take Solanas like Turbine, and if you stuck it in Ethereum's block propagation, it had very minor impact overall on performance. You actually have to go and take all of these pieces and implement them all at the same time to actually see the overall improvement. And that's really tough. I think that's just really hard.
00:27:20.780 - 00:27:47.840, Speaker A: Especially a lot of the I'd say nearly all the chains that are running are coming in from this kind of design that's very much like Tendermint esque. They have small quorums that do agreement in a single block, and they move in the sequential kind of step function forward. It's very hard to optimize those with the kind of techniques that we did.
00:27:49.090 - 00:27:56.450, Speaker C: Yeah, when I'm building a react app, I can't even swap my build system alone a blockchain, so I can't even imagine.
00:27:57.510 - 00:28:28.574, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, quick break to tell you about Jeto. Jito is the number one liquid staking provider in Solana. Jito has been known for the Mev software, and now they're the fastest growing liquid staking provider in the Solana ecosystem. Solana DeFi summer is heating up and what assets you want to use in DeFi liquid Staking tokens. Why? Because with Jito, you can take your soul, stake it, and get instant access to liquidity through their liquid staking token, jito soul. You can then use Jeeto soul throughout the Solana DeFi ecosystem while earning yields through Mev rewards and staking rewards with Jito. And Jito makes staking super simple.
00:28:28.574 - 00:28:50.946, Speaker B: You can take your soul, stake it, get instant liquidity, and start earning rewards all within three clicks. And not only do they make it simple, they make it secure. Jito has seven audits. They have more than a million soul staked, and they're one of the most respected teams in all DeFi. Jito is for whales who need deep liquidity. It's also for people like me and you who just want to get started with liquid staking. You have your soul, why not stake it, earn some yield, and start dabbling in Solana DeFi.
00:28:50.946 - 00:29:10.218, Speaker B: So go get started today. Check them out at Slash Staking. That's Jeeto network. Slash Staking. I'll put a link in the show notes. Use the link so they know that I've sent you and go get started today. Everyone, we'll get back to the show in a minute, but I want to let you know that we got our permissionless conference coming up.
00:29:10.218 - 00:29:20.234, Speaker B: Start conference of bankless. That is the biggest and best conference in DFI. It's going to be in Austin, Texas this year. Yep, I know you love it. They got Tacos barbecue. Barton Springs got it all. September 11 through the 13th.
00:29:20.234 - 00:29:49.574, Speaker B: If you've been in Crypto for a while, know that the bear market conferences are the best conferences, because those are the ones where all the alphas had the people that are still in Crypto all really want to be there. It's going to be great for building a network, for learning a lot. And look, we've got a phenomenal lineup of speakers that include people like Hasu Stani, Chris, Dean Moy, and Kyle Simani talking about ZK Tech roll ups, account abstraction, mev app, chains, and more.

00:29:56.912 - 00:29:57.898, Speaker A: Up every two weeks.
00:29:57.984 - 00:29:59.500, Speaker B: All right, back to the show.
00:30:01.790 - 00:30:21.486, Speaker C: You just mentioned SVM Roll ups and L Two, so I'll use that as my opportunistic segue here. I have been trying to get you to write a blog post on this on this comment, and I'm just going to read it out loud. So you said on Twitter there aren't any breakout products yet in crypto that depend on low cost fast networks.
00:30:21.598 - 00:30:22.226, Speaker A: That's just it.
00:30:22.248 - 00:30:31.160, Speaker C: If you don't believe it will ever happen, e L One is all you need. If you believe it will, L Two S aren't going to work. What do you mean by this? Why won't they work?
00:30:31.610 - 00:31:28.070, Speaker A: Well, because they fragment the capacity, they fragment the user base. So the UX becomes very complicated. And I don't know if you ever worked at a big web two company like Dropbox. We had one giant MySQL database for all the folders because as soon as you start fragmenting them, links become very hard. To create links between different users of different folders and tracking consistency between those between two different databases a major pain in the ass. You would have to synchronize everything through the L One, and that just happens at a large enough scale that fragmentation creates massive composability. Like either UX problems because you're like, oh, you're not in this roll up, go through another roll up kind of thing, or you have to go resync through the L One and it's going to create the same kind of cost.
00:31:28.070 - 00:32:01.186, Speaker A: And that's very difficult to deal with. And you can think of it as like NFTs are like a perfect example of this. You can't have an NFT in every roll up. It actually can only be bridged to one tokens. You can kind of fudge with this and create different markets. But if I want a specific NFT, the marketplace that it's sold is the marketplace that I need to buy in, and it can only exist in one of those. And then therefore, you've kind of broken up composability of just the marketplaces for that one single NFT by creating these different states.
00:32:01.186 - 00:32:22.726, Speaker A: So that's, I think, kind of the fundamental challenge with L Two S is their trade off. In like this, you get performance benefit because you create this single global lock around a state, and then you can go work on it asynchronously from everything else. But you're creating kind of a very hard composability challenge until you had a tweet.
00:32:22.758 - 00:32:37.198, Speaker B: Also talking about the hypothetical example of an L Two building on Salana, how you said that wouldn't actually affect the fees because it's not that you're competing for bandwidth or compute. It's actually the state contention. So can you maybe talk about that and say how isolated fee markets play into it?
00:32:37.284 - 00:33:34.718, Speaker A: Obviously there's limits to this. If Solana is over capacity fees will go up, but that means that it's really bandwidth saturated and then the dollars per byte that you're submitting to the chain are now going up. There could be other ways that it's saturated through compute and other things, but those actually do tie into state contention, I think a lot closer. So assuming that Salon itself is not saturated, what an L Two does is that you can think of it as like as a bridge into something that asynchronously process some state. And the way that that bridge works is that it runs a bunch of orders, transactions, and then submits those transactions to the L One. And that submission part, you can think of it as settlement that can occur in batches asynchronously kind of like at whatever the cheapest opportunity time is. And the computation part is occurring locally in that system.
00:33:34.718 - 00:34:32.654, Speaker A: And what's going to create fees in that state is if you have 1000 people that all want the same NFT, or 1000 people that all want to take the same liquidation or trade, they will bid up to access that one economic opportunity up to the cost of that opportunity, right? So if I'm going to make $100 in this liquidation, I'm going to bid $99 to go be first because at least I'll make a dollar. That obviously doesn't always perfectly work out like that, but you can kind of think of it at the most perfect efficient market. Somebody will always bid up to that to be first, to take the smallest amount of profit. So those fees are spiking not because anything's saturated, it's just simply because there's economic access to state. And that state, you cannot partition that. Like if you only have one liquidation that's on sale, you cannot put it into two different roll ups and then have half as many fees. It's simply because there's this one liquidation.
00:34:32.654 - 00:35:15.230, Speaker A: It's kind of like an NFT, right? It's unique and it's a unique opportunity. And it doesn't matter if it occurs on the Solana One or in a roll up. So this obviously breaks down as if Solana itself is saturated. Like there's so many economic opportunities happening in Solana that all at the same time that you cannot fit them all into the block. And now they're fighting each other to be first. And at that point, what the validators should do is they should double the cores in the network. I will personally fly out to 400 data centers or however many Mert will do it, everyone will do it, and go, double your cores.
00:35:15.230 - 00:35:32.200, Speaker A: Like the network is saturated at that point. This is kind of, I think the philosophical difference between Ethereum and Solana is that we're like, okay, we're saturated, just double the course and we're good to go. And then prices then go back to what they should be based on the economic opportunity.
00:35:33.450 - 00:36:08.610, Speaker C: So one thing I want to touch on here, just to make sure we do the l Two folks justice here. You said that the reason why L Two S wouldn't work is because of fragmentation. And probably you're talking about complexity as a developer as well. Well, so two things to that. One is that are you bearish that people can come up with abstractions to remedy that. And two, more importantly, some would argue that you actually only need one L two and then you don't need all these L Two s. What do you say to that?
00:36:08.760 - 00:37:00.062, Speaker A: So then that system where you have basically you take SVM that runs as many things in parallel as it can, like up to the limit of the it always increases hardware capacity to meet the demand. And then you take all that data and you dump it into Dink Sharding like perfect implementation of a DA layer that tries to maximize its DA system. So you have one L two, one bandwidth optimized system. That's basically what salana is. There's some implementation differences there, which I think we're all kind of slowly working on. There's just not like a major fire. But Solana itself can asynchronously execute all the programs and then pick forks separately in a separate pipeline, then execution of the programs.
00:37:00.062 - 00:37:38.926, Speaker A: So that kind of gives you that data is really quickly confirmed. All the forks are quickly picked, but then these bigger systems can go execute on the programs. You can then do batch DK verification if that's what you need. All that stuff is all doable on Salana. This is effectively like that single L Two that can dominate and take up all 100% of the DA bandwidth. That design, you have one L Two that's able to take 100% of the DA bandwidth that L Two needs to implement localized fee markets. Because if a single use case can saturate the fees for everyone, there's a need for two L Two S.
00:37:38.926 - 00:37:55.410, Speaker A: Right. That breaks down. So then you're broken composability. So it's got to implement exactly the same system as Salana does. That's great. This is where if you look at the conversations me and Colluding Node have, we end up okay. Yeah, everyone's working towards the same goal.
00:37:55.410 - 00:39:03.254, Speaker A: I think there's still kind of like a fundamental difference between Solana and something like that. I think there's not going to be a demand for Solana to do Dank Sharding because that really breaks that idea of information synchrony across the world. This is like the one aspect that Solana was started with and I think it's building towards that I think is really important for permissionless some blockchain to implement. And I think since we're the ones doing it, we should keep doing like I don't want to split the data availability. Even though you might be able to get an improvement in bandwidth there, it actually does still have a trade off. You still need a system that is working for that use case. That when I submit one bit here, that it's equally observed in Singapore, in Brazil, everywhere in the world as fast as physics allow because that actually creates value for the world that reduces the information asymmetry between any two players.
00:39:03.254 - 00:39:32.340, Speaker A: It allows for fair markets to exist. I think that's the one core use case that you really can't optimize away with all these other systems. L Two itself could actually implement that. This is kind of like the L Two that's running in this one DA layer could be implement that perfect synchrony but it's effectively salana it's running the same as fast as possible consensus and then it's dumping its data to Ethereum because it wants that data availability bridge. Sure.
00:39:35.110 - 00:40:09.360, Speaker C: So you're basically saying, if I understand correctly, because I might be a little slow today, so you're saying that, well, L Two S or the Ethan modularity roadmap and Salana actually have the same end game and they would basically have to do what Salana is doing today to scale anyways. Salana just does it in an integrated way and they don't want to compromise on the information sync being synchronous around the globe but near the speed of light, whereas Ethereum does will have to compromise on that unless they add the Sharding layer to the L Two itself.
00:40:12.770 - 00:41:24.278, Speaker A: The data availability roadmap for Ethereum, the way I understand it, is like the end state is like these ding Sharding subcommittees that can all sample each other. They will be able to increase the bandwidth because part of one subcommittee is getting different blocks than another one. So that implies that you don't have a single state that with perfect synchrony you effectively are splitting the system. So you cannot take that optimization without the sacrifice. Right. And if that sacrifice is really important to you, then you would design something like Solana where everything is built around how do we propagate the data as fast as possible to as many nodes as possible and Turbine and all these things are the solutions to think. But the idea of having a single roll up that can take up all of the bandwidth of this data availability layer, whether it's Solana or Celestia or Ethereum, I think that idea it's like something that I think a lot of the engineers agree is probably the more efficient design.
00:41:24.278 - 00:41:57.890, Speaker A: Like if you have a single roll up that can take up all the data availability bandwidth, you eliminate all of these composition bottlenecks and all this other stuff. But that's very hard, I think, politically to swallow because what are you going to do? Like say Arbitrum is a roll up or optimism? The way that free markets work is we get faster development. When there are free markets and there's competition. We don't have the single enshrined thing. So it's good for Ethereum to actually not enshrine anything, at least for probably this decade.
00:41:58.790 - 00:42:01.860, Speaker B: What is the key trade off that Swan is making?
00:42:02.710 - 00:42:29.930, Speaker A: Hardware is more expensive. So if you need more bandwidth, you got to increase the hardware. If you need more bandwidth than Ethereum, you have more subcommittees. The subcommittee hardware is fixed, but that means that each subcommittee is not observing the state at the same time. That's like, you cannot solve both of those problems at the same time. There's a fundamental trade off there. If you care about having state everywhere equally, then you need more hardware.
00:42:30.990 - 00:42:33.386, Speaker B: Yeah, it sounds like that's going to happen no matter what.
00:42:33.408 - 00:42:33.642, Speaker A: Though.
00:42:33.696 - 00:43:01.400, Speaker B: If you think about Vitalik's post that he had, it's like block production is going to use more hardware. It's going to be more expensive. It's like Salana is just having a path dependent way where they're embracing it from day one instead of working back to what you see in Ethereum. I think one good thing about L two S, it allows for a lot of experimentation. But that's something that you could see with the SVM and L two S as well. So if you're thinking about the SVM and how that benefits it's, Solana is that kind of the key thing is you might see experiments there that you can adopt, or is it just building out the tooling or something else?
00:43:05.290 - 00:44:01.962, Speaker A: I think if you're talking about the application space itself, that's kind of just a never ending problem because every two years developers are expected to learn a new stack. It's just kind of been part of my career. And this is where a lot of the work that we did in SVM to use LLVM and these other components is like to allow that kind of experimentation that we can take move or solidity and start building tooling to integrate better with it. But it takes work. Somebody has to drive it and push it and do the iteration. It's not always clear that there's even demand for that because a big part of me thinks that smart contracts are actually not a language that is like a distribution language. It's not like Swift for iOS where you get access to their distribution network, right? Or JavaScript for the web.
00:44:01.962 - 00:44:42.120, Speaker A: It's a backend system that's kind of more like building on top of Postgres or MySQL or whatever. And do you really care? Do you need that many languages for that? Or that many solutions you kind of end up with? This is like the one two engineers that write kernel code, your driver code, and once your drivers are built, you have all the other people on top that are building all the applications and everything else. But once those drivers are built, I don't know of how much innovation there is or it doesn't seem as big of a surface area for innovation as the application learn itself.
00:44:43.450 - 00:45:08.080, Speaker C: So I want to zoom out now. I think we've had a little nerd moment, which I enjoyed, having said that Salana and L two S and E probably have relatively similar endgames, and it's maybe the path that matters. One thing that comes to mind and something we've I don't want to say we, but Solana has been heavily criticized for is, you know, whatever that.
00:45:09.810 - 00:45:10.318, Speaker B: Think.
00:45:10.404 - 00:45:17.170, Speaker C: How do you think about Solana winning this BD battle and getting just more users and developers on the chain.
00:45:19.830 - 00:45:33.110, Speaker A: Oftentimes? What do you believe is the BD criticism? What is the specific one? That we did not get some brand or logo to say that they're building on Solana.
00:45:33.610 - 00:45:51.018, Speaker C: So I'm just trying to echo the sentiment that I've heard. I personally don't think there's such a like, people will say, like, well, how come Polygon is getting these deals and Solana is not? Et cetera, et cetera. How do you think about that? How should the community think about so.
00:45:51.104 - 00:47:09.430, Speaker A: Like, the way that I run Labs and why a lot of the deals we've said no to is because I want Labs to get paid for the work instead of paying a customer. So if we want to do an integration, sure, we'll do whatever if you pay our engineers to do it and this is very different from a lot of how other crypto startups operate is they actually pay the customer. Like, yeah, we'll do this integration, we'll give you X amount of millions of dollars to get an announcement and stuff like that out. There's some value to that because I think that does establish brand trust. But I generally feel like that's a lot of money out the door for very little guaranteed usage because there's no internal driver at these companies that's like, this is a problem that I need solved today and I'm willing to pay to solve it. If you can get somebody like a customer to say that you know, that you have PMF. So I am always searching for PMF, and I think it's very important to make sure that all the work that we're doing is being driven by some external demand that's legitimate.
00:47:09.430 - 00:48:05.638, Speaker A: This may be surprising to a lot of listeners, but literally the way that a lot of these deals are structured is that you would pay brand X to go launch on your chain and that means that you're paying your customers. This feels really backwards. So from my perspective is like, when we have an opportunity cost, do we focus on paying some brand or do we pour it into I'd rather throw a party at a hacker house? Honestly, at least our devs have a good time, or do we put it into funding? Like, we have a Salona Ventures arm that's done like 150 investments or so far across the ecosystem. There's at least a CEO, hey, I'm going to build this product in Salon. I'm grind for PMF. There's at least a chance of PMF there. So that's been kind of how I've been thinking about it.
00:48:05.638 - 00:48:32.910, Speaker A: I don't know if it's think honestly, looking at Polygon, I've had to think about this. Would it have helped if Solana had more brands, just like more announcements or not? Maybe in the short term, not sure in the long term. I don't know. These are like really hard questions, right? Like you have X amount of months every month is a swing kind of thing.
00:48:33.060 - 00:48:56.758, Speaker C: On that same train of thought. Two related questions. One is, is that how Solana Labs tends to make money? Is that kind of the main business models of Labs? And two, there's also Solana Foundation, which presumably their role is a bit more getting people to build on Solana. Is that how people should think about it? What's the mental model there?
00:48:56.844 - 00:49:50.274, Speaker A: Yeah, that's kind of the way foundation is there to make sure that there is like the Linux Foundation. There's a bunch of companies working on open source software. It's got to make sure that it actually all lands and moves forward and kind of shepherd this whole process of validators and multiple core development teams now and things like that. It's a big pain in the ass. Including just providing the hardware to test like large networks like stuff like that. There's just a lot of kind of nitty gritty that goes into that part of the development. Labs, we try to do that kind of work where we're like, hey, we'll build you software for money, we try to do investments, we try to find teams that need we build templates like, hey, this is like a product that I think should exist.
00:49:50.274 - 00:50:12.506, Speaker A: Here's a smart contract for it. We will go out and do audits and then help those teams accelerate and that could be tied into a venture like kind of like a YC style thing. There's a bunch of different ways. We tried to launch a phone. We launched a phone. The phone's awesome. We got really good reviews from users and trying to get more of those sold.
00:50:12.506 - 00:50:17.520, Speaker A: That's like another way to make money in crypto. That one is the hardest one.
00:50:18.470 - 00:50:38.620, Speaker B: What would you like to see the Salana community lean into? I feel like a lot of it's organic. You saw NFTs take off in 2021 and then Deepen, I don't know exactly how that started in Salana you had Hide Mapper, helium came over from Polygon and then you had Render come from their own app chain. And then there's also DeFi. So you kind of have these different areas. What would you like Solana to lean into?
00:50:39.950 - 00:51:24.790, Speaker A: It's honestly, like if I was really good at picking what's going to have PMF, I would be more confident in giving that advice. I think that's really hard. I really like compressed NFTs because I think that reduction in cost created two new kinds of businesses. Like one is Drip, the other one is Dialect. So I would really like to see more folks lean into that. Actually go try to imagine what if you could mint basically NFTs for your users for free because the cost of the infrast so low. What are the kinds of business models that you can build now? And there needs to be more iteration on those.
00:51:24.790 - 00:51:51.226, Speaker A: We need like five dialects. Not that I want competitive. We invested in dialect. I don't want more. There's some hard trade offs there. Do we want more competitors for existing things, or do we want the one thing to grow? But I honestly think that there's different iterations. You can take on that idea of a messaging app with NFTs that dialect, the path that dialect isn't taking instead of a clone.
00:51:51.226 - 00:52:42.842, Speaker A: So I'd rather see people go figure it out and try something new and different. Similarly, I think compression itself, you can apply it to tokens, you can apply it to generic programs. I know I've been asking Bert when compression for tokens, stuff like that. I don't know if that's going to open up the same kind of use cases as compressed NFTs did, but I think it's at least worth trying. Those are like the opportunities that I feel like can scale to 1020 million users. If you build a social network with a few million users, it probably would be really hard to get funding in traditional VCs with like two, 3 million actives on your social network. But it would be a runaway hit in crypto.
00:52:42.842 - 00:52:49.650, Speaker A: That would be the biggest thing in crypto right now. So I would like to see people take swings at it.
00:52:49.720 - 00:53:05.190, Speaker C: So you are the CEO of Solana Labs? Solana is a network. There's also Solana Ventures and then Solana Foundation. There's a lot of moving pieces here, and I know running Helios that's already pretty full time, but you have a lot of different things.
00:53:05.340 - 00:53:44.162, Speaker A: Well, I'm only the CEO of Solana Labs. I don't do anything at the foundation. Ventures is part of Labs, but it's run by an awesome person. Yeah, most of what I do is a lot of Twitter and product development and kind of iteration. You see me publish Timds and stuff like that to where I think the core engineering should go. But honestly, I'm not coding in the kernel anymore, so to speak. I would actually love to do that, but I would mean dropping everything else.
00:53:44.162 - 00:53:54.198, Speaker A: So this is the big sacrifice of somebody in my position is I can't do the thing that I love, and I started this whole thing in the first place.
00:53:54.364 - 00:53:58.474, Speaker B: When you're watching from afar, Anatoli, is there anything going on in Solana that you would like to change?
00:53:58.592 - 00:54:45.910, Speaker A: I think we need to basically fix ecosystem. Dow governance. I think that was like looking back at the last cycle. There's just been a bunch of failures that could have been prevented with just some very common sense basic structures that have existed in corporate finance for hundreds of years probably at this point. And they're very easy to build with Romsdao or whatever squads and just have delegation. The reason why proof of stake networks work really well and John Carbono's talk on proof of governance, I think really touched on this is that you have well branded actors that are like people delegate to so there's like an election, there's an epoch for that election. They're sticky.
00:54:45.910 - 00:55:40.710, Speaker A: They get paid to be a validator, and they care about that income. So they're all incentivized to keep the network honest and running because if they all collude to go destroy, they're not all going to collude to go destroy their own value, right? Like the thing that's creating value for them. And that's very actually easy to replicate for governance, for DAOs, and for these token based startups. And if I could wave a magic wand, I would have every company that launches on salana, every token project that creates a token, literally have like a standard template, do elections out of validators, literally go tell the validators to be on these dows and run the dowels and have very standardized templates for token economics. And that would eliminate say, 99% of the kind of failures that we saw on both ethereum or Salana in the last cycle.
00:55:40.870 - 00:56:06.020, Speaker C: You just said before this that you wish you could still work on kernels, but you have to do some other responsibilities that a CEO has for Salana labs. So that brings up kind of two questions. One is kind of what do you see your role in the next ten years in Salana? And two, when would you ever deem salana successful? And it's time to pack it up.
00:56:09.110 - 00:57:12.742, Speaker A: Dang I would like to see the ecosystem grow so much that I don't have any impact on all the other things. Besides, my highest impact thing that I could do is be like a really strong individual contributor to the code. That's when I would think it would be success and I would just continue doing that. My favorite mentors through my career were these gray beards that were there from the 80s that are just like principal engineers that just get to work on whatever really cool, interesting part of the code base that they want to. That would be kind of my dream to get there. So slowly but surely, this is what retirement is to me, is that I get to code in the parts of the system that I care about. I think solana like metric of success, it's really hard.
00:57:12.742 - 00:58:19.094, Speaker A: But like, I would say that there's like these vanity metrics like TVL or place in the top ten or like the market cap, which I think really don't capture success at all. I think if crypto really grew to the point that it has impact a lot of people, I don't really care about any of those metrics. As long as salana is actually coordinating hundreds of millions of people's private keys like that, they're all actually transacting in the network and there's thousands of devs that are building applications. I don't really care about if we're 10th or third or 20th or 50th even, as long as that's happening, right. I think that's kind of like the more important metric to focus on is are we actually touching people's lives in a daily or even monthly way like fashion. So that would be, I think, success for me. I hope crypto grows so fast that Salana is not in the top ten, but we also are impacting half a billion people on the planet.
00:58:19.094 - 00:58:21.622, Speaker A: That would be the biggest success that I could imagine.
00:58:21.686 - 00:58:43.460, Speaker C: You said you were a philosopher early on in the episode. I want to ask a philosophical question which is that I would say Solana network has been quite successful and you've touched a lot of lives. I build my business on Solana, et cetera, et cetera. Why are you still here? What's the why?
00:58:45.210 - 00:59:20.142, Speaker A: That's a good question. I don't know. I'm like a person that seeks stress too. I have always taken on projects bigger than I can chew. So I think that's part of it. And I want to see us get to that point where we do have 100 million people all with public private keys that are all trading, doing something like coordinating Dows, like all on chain. I honestly believe in that future.
00:59:20.142 - 00:59:47.160, Speaker A: I think it would transform the world when people talk about lack of democracy and transparency. If you had 100 million everyone in the world was able to transact on chain, it would be global democracy, right? It would just really be transformative. So I don't know, there's something there that's interesting enough. That's why I get up every day. I want to inch just closer and closer to that.
00:59:48.490 - 01:00:19.278, Speaker B: Your last two answers in a totally were like poetic too. Well said. Honestly. We were talking about messaging on top of all this. Like Chris Solana and I do think as new users come in, it's going to be a whole different story and they're going to listen to you, they're going to see what's being built. I think the performance optimizations that Salana is working on is going to relate a lot more to web two developers and it's really going to hit that once we get past this first wave of users. I am curious because how you just describe Salana probably hits really well as someone that is a bit philosophical or technical.
01:00:19.278 - 01:00:26.254, Speaker B: If you just sat next to me in a bar, why would I use like what would be your pitch to an average user?
01:00:26.382 - 01:01:15.382, Speaker A: The basic thing that you can do now that's really cool I think are like the permissionless payments just like send start using USDC on Salana. You get settled immediately. You have it, it's yours. And it's very strong guarantees on security that I think is like after 2008 and the crypto collapses and the banking crisis in the US. I think everyone has a bit of understanding that owning your keys with private keys, like owning your dollars with private keys is much, much stronger than trusting some third party intermediary to store them. Same thing with I think, crypto. I think that part of it is that idea of permissionless money is probably.
01:01:15.382 - 01:01:45.290, Speaker A: Still the most important use case, and I think bitcoin or ethereum are very important parts of that, too. Beyond that, I would say I really like collecting NFTs. I would recommend that go find a really cool artist on Drip and go subscribe and get that experience of actually owning your art. Like, Djin Poet got banned from Twitter, right for a hot minute. I don't know if he's back yet, but he's back. Yeah. No one was able to take your NFTs.
01:01:45.290 - 01:01:58.334, Speaker A: You didn't lose the relationship, that connection that you have, and that's a really cool thing. That is actually a totally open platform for artists fans to be able to connect to artists.
01:01:58.462 - 01:02:11.746, Speaker C: Well, totally. We are going to get less philosophical and more lizard brain. I am going to just ask some rapid fire questions and just answer as quickly as you can. But if you want to know, feel free to expand.
01:02:11.778 - 01:02:12.422, Speaker A: Of course.
01:02:12.556 - 01:02:17.320, Speaker C: All right, what do you and Raj disagree on?
01:02:19.150 - 01:03:14.234, Speaker A: We actually argue all the time about what should Labs be focusing on, what should we be building. And usually things are good if we are able to disagree and fight through it and get the result. It's bad when one of us is disengaged and we don't get that, and then the other person just drives it, and that thing usually ends up like shit. So it's really important that we do disagree, and that process is really important. I don't know what we can remember the last thing we disagreed on. I was like, we should run another NFT kind of hackathon style event that we did. And he thought that it's cringe for us to do it, for Labs to do it, it's better that the community is doing it.
01:03:14.234 - 01:03:27.200, Speaker A: And you see that kind of activity of artists being promoted through natural kind of organic plates of drip or whatever. So I don't know if he's right. Maybe he's right.
01:03:28.610 - 01:03:29.962, Speaker C: We'll let the audience decide.
01:03:30.026 - 01:03:30.640, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:03:31.650 - 01:03:34.370, Speaker C: What do you fear the most when it comes to Solana?
01:03:35.830 - 01:03:48.280, Speaker A: Like a zero day attack. Like zero day bug. That's like the scariest thing. I can't wait until fire dancers out and there's two implementations of the Runtime. But yeah, zero day is, like, the scariest thing.
01:03:49.530 - 01:03:55.400, Speaker C: What is one thing that you were super excited about in Solana but that nobody else seemed to just quite pick up on?
01:03:55.770 - 01:04:58.394, Speaker A: People do care about these, but PDAs, I thought, was, like, the coolest thing that I actually designed in the Runtime is this idea of, like, because it's very hard to build these escrow systems that are able to take ownership of assets, and this is the whole account abstraction, all those other things. And you look at all these other Runtimes, and I had this Eureka moment that there's a way that you can do it by abstracting the public key field. So you didn't have to create an object or type or whatever. You just simply said that anywhere in the entire Salana runtime. Anyone that interprets like, a public key as 32 bytes, as a public key, you can actually substitute it with a PDA and it just makes composition so natural. Like devs don't really have to think about any of the stuff or it's just naturally flow. So it took a while for that to catch on.
01:04:58.394 - 01:05:04.110, Speaker A: Like, I would say a solid year, but I think people appreciate them now.
01:05:04.260 - 01:05:07.360, Speaker B: And PDAs are program derived accounts, by the way.
01:05:08.290 - 01:05:10.080, Speaker A: Address is not account address.
01:05:11.010 - 01:05:26.610, Speaker B: Yeah, GPUs are really hot right now with everything in AI. I think Salana might use GPUs for signature verification. Do you see a future where GPUs are used more? Because I know in the initial test when you were showing, like, I don't know if it's 500,000 TPS or whatever it was, you were often quoting GPUs as being used at that time.
01:05:26.680 - 01:06:12.158, Speaker A: Yeah, when we got to a million signatures per second, I was using pretty old GPUs. At this point. I don't want to say 1080, but it might have been like an Nvidia 1080. Yeah, it was a 1080. So like four 1080s would get you to a million signatures per second. The thing is that AI needs the latest and greatest for this kind of operations that the network needs, you can actually do with pretty old GPUs to get boost. It's actually really hard to use them for that because without something like asynchronous processing of the ledger, because the latency to load the data to the GPU is in the orders of hundreds of milliseconds.
01:06:12.158 - 01:06:44.800, Speaker A: So that actually eats into the block time. What the fire dancer guys have done is that they took a very old FPGA, like the FPGAs that run on AWS cloud, and they're showing that they can do a million signatures per second. And the latency is like, in microseconds, it's like sub one millisecond latency. So that's really cool. So maybe not GPUs, maybe FPGAs, but these are like, old FPGAs. We're talking like a few hundred dollars for one of these.
01:06:46.370 - 01:06:48.030, Speaker C: How do you think about competition?
01:06:50.850 - 01:07:43.186, Speaker A: Um, there's some stuff that I think is good coming out of competition. I think Move is like a really well designed virtual machine. So I think that's cool. I try to basically the way that you should behave is you should be trying to competing against the best version of yourself and looking at the whole industry. You're like, okay, what would the best version of me do? How do I beat them? And they would gobble up all the best pieces out of everyone and integrate them to accelerate. I think stuff that has been done that's good, that's worth copying is like I think Move is a really good VM. I think polygons show that you can get somewhere with actually getting brand deals and kind of accelerating some of it.
01:07:43.186 - 01:08:41.890, Speaker A: I think that's maybe important for the foundation to pay attention to not so much labs, but Op stack is a cool thing. The fact that there's now kind of almost like a product category op stack, the fact that they were able to take this very complicated thing and create into a word, I think that is pretty cool. I think it's worth maybe for Solana to do this. And we're trying to do this out of labs a bit with the Gameshift Developer SDK, where we basically aggregate all of these service providers and APIs across all of these different companies into like here's, like a single stack for game developers, so you don't have to go try to figure out how to integrate with ten different companies. So something like that. I think when I see competitors do something interesting, I try to adopt it in some way, at least out loud.
01:08:42.470 - 01:08:44.850, Speaker C: What does everyone get wrong about Solana?
01:08:45.830 - 01:09:14.510, Speaker A: That it's not decentralized? That's just dumb. It's just such a dumb thing. Especially now. Hell, we survived the FTX collapse. The fact that the network went through that shit show and continued running and people continued building it, it's like the most decentralized thing possible. I honestly don't think that Ethereum could have survived consensus collapsing at a particular moment in time that Ethereum would have died.
01:09:16.210 - 01:09:18.430, Speaker C: What does everyone get wrong about crypto?
01:09:22.210 - 01:10:10.414, Speaker A: What does everyone get wrong about crypto? It's a good question that I think people have to understand that the protocols are not companies. And this is like a lot of that I see at a trade phi like this misconception that's very like they're just applying these old models and concepts to crypto. Solana is a bunch of open source code. Anyone can fork it. Anyone can fork ethereum. You can go run your own instances of all these networks and the token is just really representing the spam defense mechanism for these communications networks. That's it.
01:10:10.414 - 01:10:39.880, Speaker A: It doesn't give you voting rights, it doesn't give you participation rights, it doesn't do anything else. The only reason why all these other things work is because we're able to coordinate our decision making power with public keys and quickly come to decisions and kind of build upon that. But it's a very network effect kind of thing. It's not a corporation or a company, it's a bunch of open source devs that are volunteering to work at a particular thing, but anyone can leave at any time.
01:10:40.970 - 01:10:50.250, Speaker B: So what do you think about ETH's ultrasound money? Do you think it's useful that people in that community want ETH to be deflationary or is that just marketing?
01:10:55.010 - 01:11:37.178, Speaker A: I think it's like a dangerous meme. The problem with it is that if you think of it in terms of that as like an investable thing, the revenues on Ethereum are pinned to the value of Ethereum itself. And if Ethereum drops, so do the revenues. And you kind of have this revenue death spiral. And if that's what people are valuing, then it might end badly. This is why I think I think it's kind of, like, worse me than Store of Value on Bitcoin, because that idea is just like digital gold. It doesn't promise anything.
01:11:37.178 - 01:11:55.300, Speaker A: It's just like it's a dumb pet rock. There's no promises of it being anything more or anything else than that. And I honestly think that's, like, a less dangerous meme. People, I think, should be very careful, too, with how they approach this idea of ultrasound money.
01:11:56.870 - 01:11:58.610, Speaker C: Favorite three programming languages.
01:12:00.150 - 01:12:09.240, Speaker A: I was a big is like I would say, haskell c and rust. Those are my top three.
01:12:09.930 - 01:12:17.430, Speaker C: Okay, two more. Your most unpopular opinion doesn't have to be crypto. Just most unpopular opinion.
01:12:20.750 - 01:12:39.726, Speaker A: Oh, man. Shoot. What is my most unpopular opinion? I don't know. I think within crypto, probably that hardware cost don't matter. That one's, the most unpopular one. I don't know. Besides that one.
01:12:39.726 - 01:12:46.820, Speaker A: What else? That I have that's pretty unpopular. I don't know. I'm surrounded by yes men.
01:12:51.430 - 01:13:08.070, Speaker C: Well, Tolly, you're obviously a founder yourself of Solana. And you're the CEO of Solana Labs. There's obviously a lot of people that want to build the future of crypto, and especially on Solana. What advice would you give to aspiring founders?
01:13:11.070 - 01:13:39.374, Speaker A: I think it's really hard to build a company. I don't know if you saw Mark Adeson's Post 4000 investments. 15. Make it to 2200. Are like profitable, or break even. Or better. 15 become companies that have 100 million more in revenues, and those represent 97% of all the returns.
01:13:39.374 - 01:14:16.874, Speaker A: So you can kind of think of it in terms of that. Your probability of success as a founder in anything even outside of Crypto is 15 and 4000. That kind of dream success, right? Like 200 out of 4000 break even. And that you can consider, like a really solid founder story. Given that, I think it's awesome. I think this is the most transformative, amazing experience. If you like stress, I seek stress.
01:14:16.874 - 01:14:43.720, Speaker A: Right? If you seek stress, if you're one of those people that has low heart rate or whatever, it's an awesome, very rewarding, very insane experience. You will feel like you're on top of the world or, like, the depth of despair, like, every other week. And you meet a lot of people that become really close friends from that shared experience that you otherwise wouldn't have. I think that kind of trauma really brings people close together.
01:14:45.290 - 01:14:48.150, Speaker B: You're really encouraging new people to come to the ecosystem.
01:14:49.950 - 01:15:18.580, Speaker A: And I think the Solana community has awesome kind of awesome founder network. Really Good. I think VCs really good founders that help each other really good businesses to work with. And it's, I think, one of the best places to go, actually start a business. I don't think your probability of success is going to really change whether you're in crypto or not or which layer one you pick or not. I think that's, honestly, like, those are minor points at the end of the day.
01:15:19.190 - 01:15:39.910, Speaker B: Yeah. Talking about community. It's just solana. As you said. You chew glass at solana, right? And it's like over the last year or so, it's like you've been punched in the face a number of times, but you keep coming back. And to me, the community is really stronger than it's ever been, and that's why I think this is so impressive. And we'll close this up now, but, Anatoly, thanks so much for joining today.
01:15:39.910 - 01:15:49.446, Speaker B: I hope this conversation helped anyone that's either ignored what's going on solana or misjudged it. I think it's going to be a really exciting year, and it's a great community to be part of. So, Anatoly, thanks so much for joining us.
01:15:49.548 - 01:15:50.734, Speaker A: For sure there.
01:15:50.932 - 01:15:51.980, Speaker B: All right, we'll see you next time.
