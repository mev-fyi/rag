00:00:06.810 - 00:00:30.214, Speaker A: What's up, everybody? Welcome to another episode of Lightspeed. Today we have Jeff Morris Jr. Who is the managing partner at the Venture Fund chapter one. I'm extremely excited to have Jeff on. I've been following him for a long time. Right now, he's investing, doing a lot in the crypto space and also just tech in general. But before that, he was the VP of Product and Revenue at Tinder, and that's when Tinder didn't really have their premium tiers yet.
00:00:30.214 - 00:00:41.740, Speaker A: And he led that effort, and he led Tinder to become the number one grossing app in the App Store, going from 20 million in Arr annual recurring revenue to 1.2 billion. So pretty. Absolutely incredible. Jeff, welcome to the show.
00:00:42.350 - 00:00:50.698, Speaker B: Yeah, excited to be here. I've seen Mert and you launch the show and really a big fan, so this will be fun. Amazing.
00:00:50.784 - 00:01:20.998, Speaker A: Well, I'm glad to have you. I think it's impossible for me to have this conversation with you and not talk about Tinder and some of the learnings you have from there. I think what's really awesome about having you here is that one thing crypto doesn't focus on much is products. It's all about infrastructure, which is important that you come from that product background, right. And you actually understand what users want. But before we get into that, you're a prolific writer, and your last essay that you did was called Venture Narrative Whiplash. And you said that it's a term that I think you coined, but you said it's something that's shaped our industry more than anything else you've seen in the last ten years.
00:01:20.998 - 00:01:25.960, Speaker A: So I was hoping you could just introduce that concept to the audience and how it applies to the market today.
00:01:27.470 - 00:02:42.074, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a new idea I've been thinking about, but it's basically this idea. So the entire industry lives on Twitter, crypto and venture capital. And so in an era of trying to build audiences, the best way to do so is through mostly, like, negativity, because that gets most engagement. And so you see this cycle every couple of months of a new Venture Narrative as to what's popular hit the mainstream. And the implications of that are I kind of mapped it through limited partners who invest in venture funds, obviously venture funds, and then founders who are building companies. And it has a really profound impact on what gets built. And I think it's actually a new phenomenon because I entered tech in 2010 and we were all on Twitter, but it wasn't as cutthroat in terms of trying to flex online and be right about what's next in your thesis.
00:02:42.074 - 00:03:55.986, Speaker B: And it was a lot more collaborative. And so I've seen this with crypto. If you think about a year and a half ago, which isn't that long ago in building time, the entire industry was very excited about blockchain technologies, digital assets, and the conversations were more excitement around the technology. And now if you go to any venture capital dinner or conference outside of crypto. They kind of treat you like you're doing something wrong by being excited about crypto still, it's like, oh, you're still doing crypto or you're still excited about digital assets and you have to almost defend yourself, which I think is a very weird place to be in a 500 day cycle within an early stage technology market. So the point was everybody's being pushed to specialize founders and investors in given markets and the reality of trying to survive any multi year period within any sector. So it could be crypto.
00:03:55.986 - 00:05:24.242, Speaker B: I'm seeing the same thing in AI now, where everybody's now gone to AI. And suddenly there's new narratives emerging that that whole space is going to be a disaster for VCs, which it very well might be the case, but it ends up being as a negative impact on what gets built and it's kind of a bummer. And so I'm trying to communicate like, we should all give ourselves more time to build the products that we hope to bring to market. And I wish that the ecosystem as a whole took a more patient view as to what the outcome of any given sector might be. And so I feel bad for founders in the crypto space right now because the impact of all this venture narrative whiplash is it's nearly impossible to raise a Series A right now if you're doing anything crypto related. And most of these founders have really great intentions anyways, that's the idea and it's a new idea. The last part is I think it's almost like applying cancel culture to entire sectors, which is very crazy to me that the industry as a whole can just cancel an entire sector together and we're all in agreement when that happens.
00:05:24.242 - 00:05:28.200, Speaker B: And I think, again, that's kind of the idea there.
00:05:29.610 - 00:06:03.220, Speaker C: That's very interesting, the cancel culture part about entire industries. You did mention something interesting there, which is that even if you're a really well intentioned crypto founder today and you have a good product and maybe good traction, it's still going to be very difficult for you to raise a Series A and maybe continue the business and grow the market. What do you think will help us overcome that? Will it just take a few breakout products? Will it take a new bull cycle? What would your advice to crypto founders be?
00:06:04.710 - 00:07:28.646, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's never, like, one silver bullet. But I think your instincts are right that any bull market overnight changes the narrative within the venture ecosystem and makes people excited again, which is unfortunate, because the bull market often isn't related to the underlying principles of what are being built, or kind of like the ground level truth of what's being built. Rarely it is, I would say, to get to the next milestone as a founder, it very much depends on what you're building. So if you're building a protocol, the go to market and the fundraising sequencing is much different than something that resembles B Two B SaaS, where you're selling to Web Three startups or enterprises. And I find the teams that are most impacted right now tend to be more like the B to B business models because the Web Three market is just very small as of today. So if you get to a million arr or whatever it might be, it's very hard to go from like one to five to 20 and to keep hitting those milestones. We've seen some examples of that with QuickNote or other folks like that who've been able to kind of cross over to the more like mainstream enterprise buyers.
00:07:28.646 - 00:08:19.690, Speaker B: But it's a small subset of companies. And so my advice is always to do as much as you can to control your own destiny by having real end user adoption and trying to define what I call crypto market. Fit has been what I've called in the past, but really challenging yourself to get traction, which is always the easiest way to get investment interests. And I see a lot of founders right now who unfortunately don't realize that having 10,000 arr just isn't enough. And I think you have founders who haven't seen kind of like what a tough series a market looks like. Unfortunately.
00:08:21.730 - 00:08:49.640, Speaker C: You just mentioned protocols, given your background in product and revenue, protocol development, and maybe products based on protocols. So I think you mentioned Farcaster in one of your writings before. They're kind of a new beast that isn't really familiar in the Web Two world. So I'm curious, what is your mental framework for understanding protocols and how protocols can monetize? How do you think about them?
00:08:51.130 - 00:10:25.178, Speaker B: Yeah, I think conceptually protocols are most similar in Web Two to open source software, where you allow the community to build on top of whatever it is your core project is. So in the case of Farcaster, I spent a lot of time thinking about the Web Two business model being so focused primarily on ad based business models where your entire goal is to capture as much scale as you can and control that user base through walled gardens. And it ends up leading to, I think, subpar product experiences because you make a lot of decisions along the way that don't benefit the user, which if you've been in those rooms, it's a very different way of building. So and I did that for a long time and know kind of how those product teams think. What got me excited about Farcaster as an example was just the idea that Dan could build the core Farcaster protocol and you could have many different iterations of whatever that end user experience might look like based on different subsets of audiences that might have very different tastes. And so you could have a Farcaster India that functioned and looked a lot different than Farcaster US. For crypto native audiences.
00:10:25.178 - 00:11:31.686, Speaker B: You can really build, I think, better products for users. If you take the protocol approach, the challenges we're seeing is just it's hard to get people to care about new social apps, and especially in a bear market, to get them to care about the decentralized version of whatever it is they're used to in the web. Two world. It's just hard to kind of capture mainstream interest. But we're seeing, I think, probably that I've said to a lot of limited partners who invest in venture funds that there is a world where twitter no longer exists in a couple years. And I was saying that like a year or two ago, and people looked at me like I was crazy. And now you can imagine twitter as a business actually no longer being a product in a few years, if they're not able to build a business, the ad revenue is falling off dramatically right now, and they're not converting subscribers anyways.
00:11:31.686 - 00:11:40.666, Speaker B: I think there's interesting reasons why a protocol might emerge that would replace a twitter over the next couple of years.
00:11:40.848 - 00:11:51.374, Speaker A: Yeah, you mentioned subscriptions there. I'm curious, it's a bit tangential to crypto probably, because there's not a lot of subscription products that you might call native to crypto. Like, protocols are like you pay as you use it.
00:11:51.492 - 00:11:53.646, Speaker B: One thing you said about twitter as.
00:11:53.668 - 00:12:06.280, Speaker A: Well is that if you were in charge of the product today, you might make that completely for subscribers, like a complete subscription product. So maybe you could just explain that, because I'm curious why you say that, and the subscription business model in general.
00:12:07.610 - 00:13:16.090, Speaker B: Yeah, so when tinder was really popping off a lot of the attention, for better or worse, I was one of the people who was getting a lot of the public kudos for it. And I actually flew up to Twitter in 2018 and met with a member of their product team, a senior member, and he said they would never do anything subscriptions related because Jack Dorsey just fundamentally didn't believe in subscriptions because he believed in open information. And if you had a paywall to any product, obviously it's no longer completely open. The truth and subscriptions, I think, are a great way to hold yourself accountable to your subscribers, to keep adding consistent value. If your product gets worse or you don't innovate, you'll see churn. And so there's this binding relationship between you and the end user that you have to continuously add value. I think that's a really great relationship to have with an audience.
00:13:16.090 - 00:14:37.794, Speaker B: I've always thought that subscriptions were just a very one. It's a great business model because you can predict your revenue and you can really have a consumer business that feels like a SaaS business, which is nice, that helps you sleep at night. And then two, I think the opportunity to continue to provide value for users and having them recommit on a monthly or annual basis to whatever your product is, I think that's a really great relationship to build community obviously, I think there's new business models which are interesting. I think one of the challenges with crypto is you don't really have recurring payments, so you see a lot of front loaded value in projects that don't continuously deliver value to their communities. And when they do, I think the expectations are just a lot different. Maybe like the Web Three version would be like, token holders, by holding your Token, are subscribing to your product every day when they wake up in the morning, choose to hold on to that asset. But I find Web Three communities are a lot emirate, probably has things to they're just like a lot more aggressive than Web Two end users.
00:14:37.794 - 00:15:24.258, Speaker B: And so when you don't deliver in Web Three, you really face a lot of public scrutiny. And I think for anyone launching a Token, the moment you launch a Token, you're beholden to a community that all have very different goals for kind of what your product should look like. And a lot of it's directly related to the price of the Token, unfortunately. And so I've talked to founders who have launched Tokens and they've had really dark moments after launching a Token because it's just like a very hard life as a founder to wake up to every day.
00:15:24.424 - 00:15:53.680, Speaker C: So two questions. One is, do you differentiate when you're talking about Tokens, maybe as a Web Three parallel to subscriptions, do you differentiate between Fungible, Tokens and NFTs? Because obviously they have interestingly different dynamics based on the JPEG that's attached. So that's number one. And number two, do you think there's like a right way to do Tokens? Like maybe for incentivizing early users or using it as a way to start flywheel effects? What are your thoughts on that?
00:15:55.250 - 00:16:54.994, Speaker B: Yeah, I think one of the reasons why I found crypto to be exciting originally was from a growth background. Bootstrapping, a network when you have Tokens, is such a powerful go to market Uber. Famously, bootstrapped on the Give Five Get Five idea where for every friend you refer, you earn $5 that you can use for a future ride. Tokens make that feel like antiquated, almost like it's like a color TV compared to a black and white TV. $5 to ask your friend to join Uber, and that's kind of all you get as an end user. That feels pretty underwhelming compared to some of the rewards I've seen in Web Three. That said, I think the part which obviously we haven't fully figured out is just the sustainability of that kind of like, bootstrapping mechanism has been hard to figure out.
00:16:54.994 - 00:17:55.940, Speaker B: And so we have these waves of excitement where you see just like, crazy top line growth and a project falls off a couple of weeks later. I think we're seeing that data with Friendtech probably recently. But yeah, I do think of NFTs as being we've seen good examples of this, particularly with the early 2001 vintage of NFTs. I think that was an interesting time where you did have this real community element where people felt like they're subscribing to community and really felt an affinity towards those communities. I don't know now if people those communities really care. I mean, if you look at a lot of the data, unfortunately, I think again, people probably very different goals, but it seems like a lot of the 2021 NFT communities have fallen off over the past year.
00:17:57.190 - 00:18:25.470, Speaker A: Yeah, and that has to do with retention, right? Which I know in web Two is something that you look at probably every day. You look at your customer churn. What metrics do you look at when you're investing in protocols and you look at the health of an ecosystem in crypto? Because I know it's much more difficult than in web Two because one, you don't have a unique identity you can track like your wallets and identities that might be spread out across like ten different IDs. So I'm curious. Yeah. What metrics are you tracking to look for the health of an ecosystem or a token?
00:18:26.850 - 00:19:52.954, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a little bit of a cop up, but we invest it mostly pre product, so pre seed and seed investing. And we don't have a liquid fund, so most of the projects we invest in are pre launch. This Web Three identity problem I think is something that we've tried to invest in projects who can help solve that. So one example would be Spindle, who's focusing on unifying wallet IDs and providing a clear view of kind of what the customer journey looks like from acquisition through any on chain trading activity. We don't use that in our underwriting, so it would be disingenuous to say that we do. But we do spend a lot of time on doing analytics. We have a full time data science center team Jameson Seidel, who also tries to kind of identify what kind of the monthly we look at unique wallets and try and make sense of it, but she'll look at kind of, like, the distribution of whales versus non whales and trying to figure out one big thing is now just like, how dependent are you on a small subset of users? Because I think that's very scary as an investor, if you have a project that has like 50 people who control the entire fate of the community.
00:19:52.954 - 00:21:19.366, Speaker B: And so we try to look for some distribution that gives us confidence that there's a real community and not just like a small subset of people who can flip on the project and kill it overnight. But it's tough. I think the narratives back to the venture narrative whiplash, you could probably apply that within crypto and say it's like 100 x harder because the crypto community has their own the whiplash is just way more violent in crypto and happens overnight in some cases. And so we want to get to know the founders, too, and really understand their intentions for building a project, because we find it's really easy for people to take a shorter term view on company building within crypto, as we we haven't seen back to the NFP projects, we haven't seen a lot of people build products post launch. So I always thought I was in a group town. We talked about Loot the other day as an example. I always expected Loot or Board Apes or any of these projects to have real products like mobile experiences or web experiences that you could actually log into.
00:21:19.366 - 00:22:00.580, Speaker B: I know a lot of them had Metaverse or gaming pitches within those releases, but we haven't seen like there isn't like an NFT project where you wake up in the day and you log into your idea and you do something in that community. And that's pretty surprising to me with all the dollars that have flown in or have gone into NFT projects that we haven't like, I kind of wonder, what are these teams doing? Is anyone building software? And if they're not, what's the roadmap? Because I would hope that some people view these as being like true social platforms that they could build really cool experiences on top of.
00:22:02.390 - 00:22:07.560, Speaker C: Garrett after the show. We can add the we don't do that here. Meme when Jeff asked about.
00:22:11.050 - 00:22:11.526, Speaker A: One thing.
00:22:11.548 - 00:22:32.640, Speaker C: That actually that reminds me of is so you actually talked about before Garrett's question about the unsustainability of the token so far. And presumably some of that is due to no teams other than a very small handful finding PMF. And you actually just mentioned that most of the NFT teams actually aren't even building products.
00:22:37.010 - 00:22:48.682, Speaker A: Everyone, we'll get back to the show in a minute, but I want to let you know that we got our permissionless conference coming up. Start conference of bankless. That's the biggest and best conference in DFI. It's going to be in Austin, Texas this year. Yep. I know you love it. They got Tacos Barbecue.
00:22:48.682 - 00:23:20.454, Speaker A: Barn Springs got it all september 11 through the 13th. If you've been in crypto for a while, know that the bear market conferences are the best conferences is because those are the ones where all the alphas had the people that are still in crypto all really want to be there. It's going to be great for building a network, for learning a lot. And look, we've got a phenomenal lineup of speakers that include people like Hasu Sanni, Christine Moy, and Kyle Simani talking about ZK Tech roll ups, account abstraction, mev, app chains, and more. Look, I'm damn excited because you're a listener of Lightspeed. You're going to get a special discount. Type in discount code Lightspeed 30 and you'll get 30% off your ticket.
00:23:20.454 - 00:23:30.960, Speaker A: That's right. Just type in Lightspeed 30 when buying a permissionless ticket and get 30% off. Click the link at the bottom of this episode and go get it now because prices are going up every two weeks. All right, back to the show.
00:23:32.850 - 00:23:50.040, Speaker C: You talked about this before in a substack post, you think that there might be a different way of thinking about this, which is crypto market fit instead of Product Market Fit. Can you talk a bit about what that means for people who are unfamiliar and why you proposed it?
00:23:51.530 - 00:25:21.694, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So I think we get a lot of questions around from our investors, but also peers around does anything in crypto have Product Market fit? And so I wanted to answer that question in a way that looked at Web Three a little bit differently. And I think in any use case that is financialized, the barrier to entry is greater to having large populations join your product, but the ARPU the average revenue per user or the ability to monetize that smaller base of users is much greater. And so the idea was in Web Two, the goal was always to build the biggest network possible and then figure out how to monetize them later. The benefit of Web Three is everything is very monetizable. It's one of the reasons why I actually think the space is really interesting as an investor being if you have a small subset of users that are active traders, there's very easy ways to build a business. And so I looked at, in this specific instance, just looked at uniswap trading volume, which this was in Q 222, and the monthly trading volume was over $170,000,000,000 with 400,000 monthly traders.
00:25:21.694 - 00:26:35.290, Speaker B: And so you can see then I compare that to Coinbase, which had a little over $200 billion of volume with 9 million monthly traders. And so 9 million versus for the centralized version versus 400,000 for the decentralized centralized version with almost equal trading volume. And so maybe you could argue that those both have Product market fit. But if you were to show this, if you were, like, go on a public roadshow and try and take uniswap public as a company, which you would ever do, and explain the fact that you had 400,000 users to a bunch of people in the public markets, they'd be like, this isn't an interesting business, but it's clearly an interesting business. And so trying to reorient teams around the fact that you don't need I think the common trope in crypto is like bringing a billion users on chain or whatever it is. And maybe that's actually the wrong goal. Like maybe if we had 30 million people who are really passionate about crypto and found value in the ecosystem, that would be enough to build a multi trillion dollar asset class that was great for founders and investors and LPs.
00:26:35.290 - 00:28:07.480, Speaker B: But I think some people responded to the article and said it was basically you're giving Web Three builders an easy path to claim that they have product market fit or like stop giving people an excuse to not be ambitious enough to compete with Web Two. And I kind of don't think I personally, one, I don't like web two versus Web three debates. But I also think that we have to always look at the positives in web3, because if you don't take time to look at the data and find optimism, you'll frankly get so depressed you'd want to leave the space, probably. So I spend a lot of my time looking for signals of positivity or hope because I think it's really important in a bear market to say things aren't as bad as everybody thinks. And I don't know if you guys know Jeff Lewis, he's an investor at Bedrock, but he's famous for these narrative violations, which is his whole thing. And he had a tweet recently, there's a narrative violation now, which is crypto in less than ten years became a trillion dollar asset class. And so clearly this is a valuable space and it's not just like a complete zero, but it's almost a narrative validation to say that you bleed in crypto right now, which is pretty wild to think.
00:28:08.170 - 00:28:21.978, Speaker A: 100% agree. It is interesting. That's kind of a blessing and a curse that in crypto you can have fewer users. But you were comparing unisoft to Coinbase, but they had like 70% of the transaction volume. But you were also talking about earlier how when you have a few users who are contributing to that volume, you.
00:28:21.984 - 00:28:23.230, Speaker B: Can also lose those.
00:28:23.380 - 00:28:57.222, Speaker A: You're dependent on a small subset of users. So it's kind of scary in some sense. I'm curious, just obviously you're staying in the space. Your fund doesn't only invest in crypto. I think maybe the first one did, but I know you're in crypto and also outside of it, what are some small things crypto could do or products you're looking for that are just missing from the space? And maybe we don't get into this yet, but people again, I just don't think there's a lot of product people in crypto and they're missing some potentially really small things. Like Curve used to get praised for its website and how complicated it looked, which was great for engineers. But if you really want to get more people in the space, that's not true.
00:28:57.222 - 00:29:19.870, Speaker A: So going through your writings, some of the things I noticed were like, time to utility, like knowing who your customer was. You talked about on Tinder, how you were only looking at New York and La at first when you're thinking about customers, but then you went beyond that. You talked about the importance of notifications and almost becoming a habit in people's lives. So I'm curious, what are some little small things that crypto could do to improve and actually become maybe more retail friendly?
00:29:21.090 - 00:30:02.494, Speaker B: Yeah, so you're right. We invest across different industries, including crypto, and we've taken obviously a huge interest in the space. The benefit there is we get to see, and I've seen a lot of non crypto products and what they do well. And again, I always believe that there's learnings you can take from any part of the industry. So it's helpful. But the basic fundamental platforms and products we need to make crypto accessible I would say one is obviously mobile. And so I think Frontech was interesting.
00:30:02.494 - 00:30:58.602, Speaker B: The progressive web app idea was, I thought, done very well for what is available. That said, if you put any non crypto user in front of that onboarding experience, I would love to look at the completion rate because most people just aren't going to go through this kind of janky web experience. Again, I give credit for the that's the best you can do with the App Store and Play Store? I would say the Play Store is pro crypto now or getting more crypto friendly. The App Store clearly doesn't like crypto. Communication I think is obviously a huge part of what we need. And so Xmtp or different communication protocols, like being able to have a conversation within a web3 experience with another user. And the reason I say that is these things are all related.
00:30:58.602 - 00:31:43.134, Speaker B: So you need mobile to facilitate push notifications. Push notifications are famously the best retention lever you can have as any product, far better than email. And so you need mobile, you need push notifications and communication has the highest open rate for any push notification you can send. There's actually two push notification types that are the highest engagement. One is finance and one is communication. And so crypto has both of those covered. And so I would think once we have mobile communication with push notifications, you could actually build fairly interesting products.
00:31:43.134 - 00:33:01.542, Speaker B: Will people care? I don't know the answer to that. That's on the builders to figure out. But I feel like we're playing from like crypto right now, still feels like it's in the 2007 relative to where the rest of consumer experiences are. We have a long way to go. I am pretty excited. I did want to talk about I'll give Solana kind of a plug because I do think the Helium launch last week was as close to what I think a crypto go to market message should look like being if you looked at any of the media placements advertising, the headline was $5 unlimited phone plans, right? There was no mention of anything crypto related or deep in like all these words we use, it was just $5 for a phone plan. And I have a feeling if you were living in Miami and you saw that on a billboard, you would stop and try and figure out what the catch was or what they were selling and take an interest.
00:33:01.542 - 00:34:16.800, Speaker B: And I think that's what gets me excited. I was an early investor in Dapper Labs and I remember at the time people gave me a lot of shit in crypto telegram groups and they're like, how can you invest in a project that allows credit cards and doesn't allow self custody wallets? And I was kind of like, how stubborn are you? To not want people to experience NFTs for the first time, right? Like if my dad wants to buy an NFT and use his credit card, why would we say to him, like, we don't want you because you want to use your credit card? I think the space is just for me, that's where things have really fallen short is this view that we can't learn from web Two and take people down the path of decentralization if they choose. If my data wants to buy a TOPSHOT and open up a MetaMask wallet and really embrace the deeper parts of the crypto experience, then that would be amazing. But I have a view it's more of like a progressive onboarding for most people.
00:34:18.050 - 00:34:52.140, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel like that $5 unlimited data by Helium is kind of like 1000 songs in your pocket with Steve Jobs. It's just like something that hits you without getting into the technicalities of it. It's going to sell. I wanted to ask you not specifically about Dapper Labs because I know that was something that a lot of people said. It was more centralized and there's debates about decentralization, how much that matters constantly on Twitter. Curious when you're looking at these different ecosystems, is that something that comes up when you have projects come to you? How are they choosing where to build? And are you basing how decentralized something is like Solana versus Ethereum versus an app chain? How much do you think of that?
00:34:56.670 - 00:35:59.214, Speaker B: The answer is we think about it and we obviously view decentralization as being net positive for future applications. But I personally care way more about the user experience today and how we can meet people kind of where they are in their lives today and not force our personal ideologies or preferences on those people. And so when I look at Solana, when I first used Phantom for the first time two years ago, I'm sure you guys were doing the same thing. And you compare that to your experience using anything built on Ethereum, it was pretty clear what the better experience was. And this is not me. There's no ideology here. Let's just take two people and put them in a room and have them transact on Solana and have them transact on Ethereum at that moment in time.
00:35:59.214 - 00:37:22.886, Speaker B: And the one was a very better user experience. And that's kind of where I start and then try to figure out is there a risk with an experience being quote unquote, centralized, which again, like mert, can probably explain better than anybody why Solana is sufficiently decentralized. But to me, people start with their religion and then try and build the user experience that fits their preference for the world, where most people just want things that are cheaper, faster, better. And if you step out of your little worldview and think about how a user experiences crypto for the first time, that's probably what they care about would be my take. But again, I'm going to the Stanford blockchain conference today and I'm not going to get on a microphone and say that at that venue, but it's just kind of how I think the world works. And I'll give you one more example. We noticed we were having some weird retention issues in India at Tinder and it was because our onboarding flow was taking two to 3 seconds faster.
00:37:22.886 - 00:38:12.666, Speaker B: Because we had a bug that had been introduced and people a two to three second lag in our onboarding flow caused major retention issues within an entire country because people weren't willing to wait an extra two to 3 seconds. And so if you look at a lot of the products in web3 today, if we just look at it from a purely performance and time spent on an onboarding flow, you can start to figure out what users might prefer. And again, I think mert's probably been the loudest person online, so I don't have to convince you guys. I don't think you said something that.
00:38:12.688 - 00:39:08.380, Speaker C: I think is really interesting, that when you back dapper labs early on and it's actually how most of my friends onboarded crypto, by the way, so clearly it at least worked somewhat, that people were kind of against it or in the TG chats, they were not very supportive. Something I ask myself all the time is, is the lack of product success in crypto so far due to kind of the ideology around crypto and maybe like the academic nature of earlier proponents? Or is it that maybe there's just not that much utility? And I ask this pretty frequently and I'm not too sure what the answer is. What are your thoughts on this? Do you think maybe the inherent ideology of crypto leads to kind of worse products kind of almost by design, ironically, or is it that there's maybe not that much use for it at the moment?
00:39:10.910 - 00:40:59.454, Speaker B: I think it depends on where you are in the world. I was with a woman yesterday from Brazil, and 50% of people in Brazil own a digital asset, mostly bitcoin. And so she was talking about their monetary policy and the issues they have there and why crypto is important for people on a daily basis in latin America. And it just reminded me like I was at cyclops in San Francisco, and if you were living in San Francisco today, crypto probably doesn't have a ton of utility. Other know, maybe you have some interest in more of the financial nature of investing crypto, but there's not like a need in your everyday life. I do think probably some of the things happening in GPIN to me are interesting because you start to take on really large everyday use cases transportation, telecom, food delivery, energy. I think those can be a backdoor into mainstream adoption without forcing people to answer the question like, do you care about crypto or does crypto help you in any way? But yeah, I think one of the things that culturally was interesting to me in 2020 about crypto was there's just a lot more interest in becoming a part of the financial world, mostly as investors like the Robin Hood came out obviously in 2015 or so.
00:40:59.454 - 00:41:45.602, Speaker B: But there's just a lot more interest in combining financial products with social experiences that I think could be really interesting and probably more to me like more fun than a lot of web two social products. But yeah, the jury is out on us crypto and whether there's an everyday utility. So we'll see. I know there's a lot of interest in real world assets. I know you actually Nick Carter was on the show, I saw an interesting tweet yesterday where he said stablecoins are product market fit in crypto. Like that was his take was we have product market fit with stablecoins. My limits.
00:41:45.602 - 00:42:22.280, Speaker B: I lived in Kansas City when I started my tech career and kind of like when you go to non tech hubs, do people care to talk about crypto? And the answer is no, they don't for the most part. And so I think it's early to say that crypto has any mainstream utility, but that's okay because again, it's still relatively early in the experiment though. Murdo, I've seen some of your tweets talking about how the experiment's been running for quite a while. So you'd hope that we see that at some.
00:42:24.730 - 00:42:53.090, Speaker C: So I'm in hotel in Istanbul right now and saw one of the people with a board ape Yacht Club shirt. So you know, great utility there. So you just said you're quite interested in deepen and same. I think it's a really interesting idea. So let's maybe talk about verticals in crypto. Are there any verticals you think are underrated in crypto? I know some people are super either bearish on gaming or bullish, but what do you think about the different verticals like payments, DeFi, et cetera?
00:42:55.210 - 00:44:10.690, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I personally haven't given up on the idea of NFTs being a great primitive for community formation and kind of alignment around owning something together. Probably the most interesting experiments in the last bull market were and if you've seen like Archive, you can co own a museum together and choose what art you purchase and you own a physical product in the real world, obviously you probably sell linkstow, et cetera. I haven't given up on this idea of groups of people owning co owning physical assets in the real world. I think that's pretty interesting to me. Tougher in a bear market where everybody's feeling a bit poor to convince people to participate in these crazy ideas we are spending a lot in. Also, we were investors in ondo finance which is kind of leading parts of the RWA, at least by volume. They become one of the emerging startups in that ecosystem.
00:44:10.690 - 00:45:20.462, Speaker B: But yeah, I wouldn't say we have any specific vertical right now that's interesting to us. But we are way more interested in applications than infrastructure would be one piece. Because I think our view is that the infrastructure is sufficient at this point to run most of these experiments and see if people care. Because again, one of the things I've seen in my career is if people really want something, they see value, they will work pretty hard to get through some of the it's a little counterweight saying earlier, but at least with early adopters, they'll go through some crap to try a product if the reward is great enough. The infrastructure investing right now, I think is kind of a retreat to safety and I don't think that's what's needed right now for crypto to succeed.
00:45:20.526 - 00:45:40.278, Speaker A: And you mentioned Dapper labs and TOPSHOT. I know. I remember at that time that was like the hottest thing in the space. To this day, I think it's still reached like Normies probably more than any other project. Is there anything that you think if a project came to you similar to TOPSHOT today, would you invest? Is there anything that maybe you think they did wrong or something that we've learned since then that would make that sustainable?
00:45:40.454 - 00:46:54.514, Speaker B: Yeah, I think probably what they did right was recognize that intellectual property is a great shortcut to adoption with any product. It could be technology products, I'm sure. I don't know if you guys have seen the Barbie movie yet, but the Barbie franchise has been around for, I don't know, 50 plus years and did over a billion dollars in box office revenue already. And I know people at Mattel and they've been sitting on that IP for 30 years trying to think about how they can make a movie. And so I think TOPSHOTS really understood that leveraging existing interests, in this case sports primarily, was a great shortcut to bring in Normies into crypto. I don't know. We've obviously seen a ton of different pitches that have that mindset, but it feels like we always try and create new things in crypto with generative art or especially within the PFP world.
00:46:54.514 - 00:47:39.198, Speaker B: And maybe going back to that shortcut could be interesting and saying, hey, is there a really interesting known IP we can leverage to bring people back into the space? I don't know if we'd invest in another Dapper type of project right now because frankly, we feel like we made that bet a couple of years ago and we're still waiting to see how it plays out. But we are interested broadly in the utility that NFTs can provide to community formation and view it as being, as Mert said, like a pretty good way to bootstrap an early community.
00:47:39.284 - 00:48:19.420, Speaker C: So while we're on the topic of product, this is going to be not related to crypto, but I'm really curious on your thoughts here, Jeff. I was listening to a talk by Keith from Founders Fund and he said something like, the advice that you should talk to your users as a product manager is actually backwards. He thinks of building products as almost like creating a movie, right? Like, you don't ask a lot of people on the street like, hey, what movie do you want to see? You instead just build or create the movie. And then obviously the common wisdom is to talk to your users. Iterate and whatnot obviously you're a big product. What are your thoughts on that? How should people think about building products?
00:48:21.630 - 00:49:25.030, Speaker B: Yeah, it's probably like a very Steve Jobs mindset. Your users don't know what they want type of, which I think is largely true in consumer. It's hard to imagine what the next great consumer experience would look like for the best product people. And so to ask a user what that might be, I think in B, two B, SaaS or Enterprise products, you normally can go to a customer and be like, hey, if we added like, I don't know, if we were like SoC two compliant, would you buy this product? And they'd tell you yes or no. That's why I don't actually build SaaS or Enterprise products myself, because it's often very can be like a lit formulaic as to what that path looks like. But for consumer, I would largely agree. I would say anyone who has really strong takes on how to build consumer products, it's kind of like self help books.
00:49:25.030 - 00:50:25.582, Speaker B: Everybody has a different idea on what it takes. And nobody really I've worked with, I think, some of the best product people in consumer software and Sean Rad at Tinder, Jonathan Padin, like all these like it is hard to know what is going to work. And the way Tinder found its success was they ran a bunch of experiments and stumbled upon dating. As being the original Tinder product was a networking app that swipes the cards were supposed to be business cards. And then they're like, this isn't working for business, so let's try dating overnight. They're like, holy shit, this definitely is working. But it wasn't something you could read in a book or users could tell you.
00:50:25.582 - 00:51:21.080, Speaker B: Just a lot of experiments. I see a lot of consumer founders who come in and pitch ideas. Like they know what the outcome is going to be. And the truth is, nobody ever knows. And the best people I've invested in just take a very low ego, but high builder energy, but low ego is what we look for. So people who we invest in this company called Captions, it's not a web3 product, but it's basically when you watch any video on TikTok or Twitter now and there's Captions on the short form video, they're probably providing those captions. And they were the experiments team at Snap that built they built over 100 consumer experiences at Snap and Captions, which is now really taken off, was like their 6th idea they tried at this company.
00:51:21.080 - 00:52:13.014, Speaker B: But their mindset is just like ship things move on. Another thing consumer founders do a lot is they call you and they're like, do I have product market fit? And you're like, come on. You will know when you have product market fit, because you'll just look at your data in the morning, you'll be like, this is growing faster than we can keep up with. And there was no explanation as to why that's happening. Often it's just like it catches the right cultural moment and takes off in a really it's something you just can't explain. Anyways, that's probably one of my favorite questions. It's like, if you call me, if you call me and ask if you're a park market fit, the answer is just no.
00:52:13.014 - 00:52:14.760, Speaker B: So don't call.
00:52:16.170 - 00:52:38.094, Speaker A: Yeah, I like your point on experimentation, too. I know maybe you had a tweet on this. You're talking about how you found what to charge at Tinder, and obviously you guys found something people wanted, going from business cards to dating. Everyone wants to go on dates. Everyone wants to make money, which is like crypto why speculation is so good. And I saw you were experimenting with, like, what do we charge here? And you started with 999 for some subscription tier, and people are like, you're crazy. No one's going to pay that.
00:52:38.132 - 00:52:39.102, Speaker B: Well, they did.
00:52:39.156 - 00:52:53.454, Speaker A: And then you charged like 39, 99 a month for Twitter Gold, and that was like, your highest grossing product ever. So just like experimentation, trying it out, and if you find something people like, they'll pay for it. Something that you talk about often is like finding when you're looking at founders.
00:52:53.502 - 00:52:55.010, Speaker B: Is their earned secret.
00:52:55.830 - 00:53:13.900, Speaker A: I'm curious if maybe explain that, but what do you think your earned secret is that puts you as you're investing in crypto and web3, but you could quit any day and be the head of product to any company. So I'm just curious, what is an earned secret and what puts you in this position to want to be here and invest in this space?
00:53:15.790 - 00:54:52.842, Speaker B: Yeah, so the earned secret idea is actually something a guy named Mike Maples taught me, who's at floodgate. It's like if you were to let's start with Garrett and Mert. When you're five years old and look at your entire life story, what were you interesting as a kid? Kind of. What were your hobbies? What do you study in high school? What do you sit in college? What were your jobs that didn't work? What were the jobs that did work? And success and heartbreak along the way that have informed your point of view on the world that all lead to this idea that you have discovered through a lot of combined life experiences that make you the one of one person to solve any given problem in the world. And so it's kind of an exercise of trying to really be introspective and self aware around kind of like what your unique gift is in the world that allows you to see some problem and solution differently than everybody else. And so it's a pretty heavy way of looking at kind of like your life arc and trying to identify what you're uniquely suited to do in either tech or anything else to create value in the world. It's a pretty drawn out process.
00:54:52.842 - 00:55:52.620, Speaker B: It's actually very hard in the crypto bull market to ever even have this conversation with anybody, because you had 20 minutes to be on a zoom call with somebody. And if I was to take, like, 20 minutes and ask mert about the person who broke his heart in high school or whatever, he'd probably hang up the call. I think, for me, I don't know if I have that answer today. I think when I was at tinder, I was pretty good at building dating products because I had a long journey to I'm now married, but I went through the craziest ups and downs in relationships. I was single for a long time. I used okaycupid, I used every dating product imaginable. I knew that product very well.
00:55:52.620 - 00:57:36.394, Speaker B: I don't think that's my purpose in the world, but I think I was uniquely suited as the VP of product there to build some pretty great products within that category, because I had just been a customer for so long of different dating products. And so when we meet founders, I want to figure out how we always call it the idea maze. Have you gone through the idea maze of every twist and turn of an idea to try and figure out what the right entry point to market is and trying to figure out the depth of the founder on what they're trying to? And then in terms of my life journey, I actually had a pretty nontraditional path and adventure. And after I was an English major, I went to film school. After OT USC film school when I was 22, tried to be a screenwriter, know how hard the creative process is, and took those learnings and applied it to building software. But anything that involves creators or that group of people, I've experienced the ups and downs of that world and tried to make it and failed pretty bad. And so I think I just have a point of view on what the life of a struggling artist feels like and have applied that to really?
00:57:36.432 - 00:57:55.394, Speaker A: No, I love the answer. I love the answer. I love that you went to film school, too. You went from that to getting into product. Well, I think you were living in San Francisco, and you moved all the way to Kansas city. I'm from Arkansas, so I can relate to that area of the world. One thing that I actually think this outside of crypto is it would help founders if they actually get out and maybe speak to people and see other people in part of the world.
00:57:55.394 - 00:58:35.300, Speaker A: Because when I go from I'm in New York, if I go from new York to Arkansas, you learn that there's a whole other world out there. And sometimes maybe the people you're building for, you realize that's such a small contingent of your future users. And I think that probably benefited you a lot seeing people in California to go into Kansas City, maybe on one thing that I saw you tweet, and I think this is really positive for builders in the space. You said that right now, in 2023, with all the platform shifts that we're seeing, that this is made be the best vintage of I think you said platform shifts or products that you're seeing as an investor and builder right now. And you talked about like, AR and VR. So I'm curious if you can just expand on that, because I think that's like a really powerful message for people that right now are like kind of doom and gloom bear market.
00:58:37.510 - 01:00:05.070, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think you, in your career, hope that you can be a part of maybe like two to three platform shifts as a founder. And if you're lucky, you'll get to build a product that catches that wave at the right moment in time. And I think at least like 2016 to 2020, especially at the application layer, were pretty crypto is exciting, but it was like a pretty boring set of problems to solve. And I think we reached on the mobile is still going, it's not going anywhere, but I feel like the big categories were solved for and then we looked at crypto as being maybe like the next platform shift. And suddenly I think while crypto is still one of those places to build, you have the Apple Vision Pro coming out, which I would think based on Apple's track record, that that will have some level of success. I'm not sure what it will look like, but you have AR, VR, you have crypto, you have AI, which is an incredible place to build consumer applications right now because people are so eager to try anything AI related.
01:00:05.070 - 01:01:45.550, Speaker B: And then on the other side of the spectrum, you have, I think, a lot of really interesting products within defense tech space. There's just like a huge spectrum of categories that you can build in. Whereas I feel like maybe like five years ago, it's like, okay, are you building a mobile app or a B, two B product? And that was kind of like the range of companies. Yeah, I think one thing I would say to people in crypto and it's probably not like the message everybody says, is it's okay to experiment with ideas outside of crypto too, for a period of time? Or It's okay to take your interest in crypto and combine that with another category and see what the petri dish of ideas, what you can create with that. I think there's a mentality in crypto. If somebody were to go try something that wasn't squarely within crypto, they're almost like they're like push out of the community, but maybe like building something within another sector and then combining your background in crypto, like maybe that creates the next best product that creates the new bull market, if that makes sense. And so I think right now in an air market stakes are pretty low in a good way where you can go try some crazy ideas and see what you create.
01:01:45.550 - 01:01:50.798, Speaker B: And I would encourage people to take a very broad view of what that might be.
01:01:50.964 - 01:01:52.926, Speaker C: What are your thoughts on, let's say.
01:01:52.948 - 01:01:56.370, Speaker B: You'Re a company building on chain X.
01:01:56.520 - 01:01:58.914, Speaker C: And you go MultiChain to get more.
01:01:58.952 - 01:02:02.606, Speaker B: Users or maybe you go cross chain.
01:02:02.718 - 01:02:03.538, Speaker C: What are your thoughts on that?
01:02:03.544 - 01:02:05.474, Speaker B: Do you think like because there's two.
01:02:05.512 - 01:02:07.246, Speaker C: Schools of thoughts on this or thought.
01:02:07.288 - 01:02:09.062, Speaker B: On this, which is like, well, maybe.
01:02:09.116 - 01:02:20.620, Speaker C: One, you actually want to get users outside of crypto. That should be the main goal. Or you get users that are power users on the other chains first. What were your thoughts on that?
01:02:22.270 - 01:04:13.520, Speaker B: Yeah, I know probably the best example I have seen and obviously has had different reactions would be Dgods. And their view is that every chain has a unique user base and to really expand your project, you should be thinking of ways to go cross chain so you can reach as many people as possible. I think Murd, I don't have as much religion towards any chain as I think other people in the space. And so from a business strategy perspective, I think that is an interesting idea, which is like, hey, again, maybe we'll go back to Web two. Would you release a mobile app on iOS and you have international users on Android devices and not build for those people? The business strategy would probably be like, hey, let's think about how we can build an Android application too. I don't know if you guys agree with that, but I think there are business reasons why that makes sense. I think the narrative is what is more challenging is like if you build on Solana first and you go to the theorem ecosystem, is that you saying, hey, Solana is not a great place to build an NFT project.
01:04:13.520 - 01:05:04.826, Speaker B: I don't think that should be the takeaway of the message, but often that's what I see on Twitter. But I don't have strong views on what's right versus wrong other than I think from addressable market perspective, that does end up for some projects being a reality. Like what happens when you saturate any given chain and you need to grow your audience. Where do you go to find new users? I think different ecosystems have different types of users and the view on some chains is that they're harder to monetize than others. And so that's another part of the conversation too yeah, and related to that.
01:05:04.848 - 01:05:26.306, Speaker A: I think it's difficult now with Ethereum usage have like Ethereum L one. Like if you launch on Ethereum, you know, where everybody's going. And now you have roll ups and they're all frameworks and L ones, L two S, L three S. And then distribution in some ways becomes a problem. Obviously right now, crypto is all about liquidity. And to me at least, that's something that Salana, for example, has in its favor. Obviously some other ecosystems do too.
01:05:26.306 - 01:05:33.778, Speaker A: And that if you're a builder and you want to go to an ecosystem, it's like you build there on Salana, on L one, whereas today Mert is talking about going cross chain.
01:05:33.794 - 01:05:37.078, Speaker B: But where do you go? And eventually you're only going to be.
01:05:37.084 - 01:05:38.306, Speaker A: Able to support so many places.
01:05:38.338 - 01:05:39.238, Speaker B: It'd be like if you had to.
01:05:39.244 - 01:06:05.454, Speaker A: Build for 20 different operating systems, not just iOS and Android. How do you think maybe this is almost the same answer. How do you think about the importance of distribution and maybe owning that customer touch point. And by that I mean you're the front end and the customer knows who you are. They know uniswap. And Uniswap is building a wallet versus I don't know where distribution even goes because we don't have an app store in crypto right now. You have backpack and solana and so forth.
01:06:05.454 - 01:06:11.220, Speaker A: But how do you think about distribution and the importance of maybe owning that customer relationship?
01:06:14.870 - 01:07:31.470, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's two parts. One is distribution from like a top lip funnel go to market. Do you have the ability to successfully onboard people into your application, get them to sign up? And then the second part of it is, do you have the communication channels or retention hooks? Maybe it's through some identity that you own to continue that relationship. And I've learned in my career that distribution I've been very stubborn to reach this conclusion, but distribution is more important than product in most cases. And you can build the best product ever, but if nobody is aware of it or sees it, it's just never going to succeed. And so I think there's ways to build virality within products that maybe can earn more distribution. But that's why you see incumbents most often win in consumer social because they have distribution advantages that are very hard for a startup to overcome.
01:07:31.470 - 01:09:19.966, Speaker B: Within crypto, I don't think anybody has a real distribution advantage outside of Coinbase and maybe like MetaMask because they have what, 26 million active wallets or whatever it is. And so I don't know if Uniswap has a distribution advantage, but they have a brand awareness advantage, which is very hard to beat. And so when I looked at brand awareness, their market share of their market share is comparable to PEPC or Coke, which is pretty amazing to me. And so without owning a like, I don't think Uniswap knows that I use Uniswap or if they do, they've never communicated with me. I just think to go to Uniswap when I want to execute a swap or kind of like everyday trading yeah, it's something that I think. Is hard to do in crypto right now and it's almost like the more decentralized you want your project to become, like at the core of that is trying to level the playing field within distribution and own users less than more centralized products. I think this is all part of the larger question around is it possible to build a huge sustainable business while being more decentralized as a go to market?
01:09:20.068 - 01:09:53.880, Speaker C: So one thing or two things I'm super curious about, jeff, you're a really good writer for this show. I read literally every single one of your posts, or at least a good amount of them. And for people who want to be better writers, I'm curious on maybe some writing tips that you might have. And two, obviously you are a great product mind, and I am curious, with the lack of crypto products out there, what is one thing that you hope people take away from maybe product thinking from web two that they can apply to web3 products?
01:09:56.490 - 01:10:36.360, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll start with number one. I started my career in screenwriting, which I mentioned earlier. And if you read a screenplay, it's like every word is there for a reason. There's like no wasted verbiage or words. It's very punchy. And so I try to write like a screenplay and really you need to come up with a hook that people care about. And really within screenplays, you have people who read screenplays for a living and you need to grab their attention on the first page.
01:10:36.360 - 01:12:18.682, Speaker B: Otherwise they literally throw your script in a garbage can and move on to the next one because the filter of what they need to do is reading does. Like, I've been this person who reads scripts and so I kind of view writing as being like coming up with a hook and then really grabbing people's attention within the first paragraph or two and trying to convince them to spend more time with whatever you're trying to communicate. Writing tips would, I think, just be like, whatever the voice in your head is, try to write that voice and try to make it as conversational as possible and to not think about having the perfect sentence. Just try to write like you're writing to your best friend in a journal and people will prefer that to fancy stylistic writing, at least from what I've seen. In terms of consumer products in web two, I think I always love thinking about milestone's, hierarchy of needs and what do people actually need or want in their lives? They want love, food, shelter, security, and trying to really take it back to the core of what people are trying to do to achieve whatever they're trying to achieve in this world. So self actualization, I think, is a huge part of what makes products succeed. Some of it's pretty vain, but this is a world we live in.
01:12:18.682 - 01:13:32.080, Speaker B: And so I would try for crypto products to really think about what are web two products that have worked and why did they actually work? Not because they were built on some technology stock. It was like the visceral reaction of downloading Tinder for the first time really got people excited. It was like, Holy shit, I have hundreds of people who I can now connect with. And it's like that moment or you guys probably remember when you use Uber for the first time. It's like these magic moments where you're providing people with a shortcut in the world to enable them to live a better, easier, happier life. And if crypto can't do that, then it's probably not going to be more than these financial use cases, which are also interesting, but these aren't, like, I don't think, like, world changing applications if we can't reel it out.
01:13:33.330 - 01:14:01.846, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great answer. I remember reading this book called It's by Rory Sutherland, and it's about behavioral economics, and it talks about Uber. And I think one thing that's interesting and I don't know where this applies in crypto yet, but you eventually see it coming in. Even though Uber by and far, is a better product than just having a taxi, he's like, in some sense, it's the little things that are more psychological that actually make a big difference in a product. And, for example, it's like calling your Uber. You can see how far away it is, and it might be 15 minutes away. When you call a cab, it might be ten.
01:14:01.846 - 01:14:34.500, Speaker A: But just by giving that screen where you can see where it is, you have that certainty, and that's a ten times improvement. So it's like sometimes we're probably trying to improve, like, a quantity measure when there are these qualitative community aspects of products that we could build in crypto as well. But dude, Jeff, this was amazing for this conversation. This is kind of nerdy, but you should definitely go back and read his tweets as well. Just packed with information. I think everybody in crypto needs to, including myself, need to know more about product, because that will be the only reason we'll ever get out of this bear market. So thanks so much for joining today.
01:14:35.110 - 01:14:52.198, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. And we will get out of the bear market, so everybody, there's light at the end of the road, so I would be excited to have this conversation in a couple of years when things look more positive. And thanks for providing this for the community.
01:14:52.364 - 01:14:55.080, Speaker A: Yeah, amazing. Thanks for coming on, and we'll see you next time.
01:14:55.610 - 01:15:00.250, Speaker B: All right, thanks, guys. Bye. Jump.
