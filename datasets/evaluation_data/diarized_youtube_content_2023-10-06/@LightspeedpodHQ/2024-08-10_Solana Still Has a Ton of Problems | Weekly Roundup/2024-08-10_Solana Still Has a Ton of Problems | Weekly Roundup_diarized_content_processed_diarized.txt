00:00:00.240 - 00:00:21.737, Speaker A: Like, for example, when you're building a startup, you're not necessarily building for what the market is today. I mean, you are to an extent, but you also need to consider what the market could be. And you need to take some action in the world to get to that stage. Right. Like Peter Thiel will say, you don't want to start from a big market. You want to start from a small market that you can actually monopolize and then grow from that market.

Hello, and welcome back to another episode of Lightspeed. I'm Jack Kubenek, joined by Mert.
00:00:53.437 - 00:00:54.505, Speaker B: Mert, how you doing?
00:00:54.885 - 00:00:56.541, Speaker A: Good, man. How you doing?
00:00:56.733 - 00:01:31.001, Speaker B: I'm doing well, yeah. Traveling around in the south right now. I was staying with my parents for a bit, and everyone in the south, like, has their air conditioning, just way too cold all the time. So if I'm shivering a bit today, if my voice is a bit shaky, that's why I'm currently in Nashville, Tennessee, and it's probably 90 degrees outside and like 60 degrees in here. So first world struggles I'm going through. But. But, yeah, today we're coming at you guys with a roundup, the first roundup since I've joined the podcast.
00:01:31.001 - 00:02:06.785, Speaker B: So, yeah, super excited to dive into some stuff going on. It was an eventful week in Solana land, I guess. Mert, let's start. You know, we're recording today on Friday. Let's start with what was kind of the big news yesterday afternoon, which was what looked like it was going to maybe be a bigger deal than. It was a security issue that came up on Solana. So yesterday afternoon, a message went out in the Solana, you know, mainnet Beta validator Discord.
00:02:06.785 - 00:02:45.851, Speaker B: It said, I have your core contributors have identified a network security issue that requires an urgent response. They told people to push out a patch. Everyone kind of braced for impact. They wondered if there was going to be another network outage. As we know, Solana has a history of, you know, partial and major outages at different times. But within minutes of the announcement going out, 70% of all stake on Solana had been patched, which meant that a super majority was running this patched version, and, you know, essentially an attack on Solana's consensus could be prevented. So that's kind of the broad strokes, I guess.
00:02:45.851 - 00:03:12.935, Speaker B: Mert, where I want to start, you know, with you is what does this say about decentralization on Solana? I'm assuming at some level you were part of these conversations and there was some criticism online of essentially, you know, hey, look, this is a decentralized blockchain where people are working kind of behind the scenes to create patches to a bug. This isn't real decentralization. What's sort of your take there?
00:03:13.515 - 00:04:08.165, Speaker A: I would basically question their understanding of the word decentralization, especially within the context of a blockchain. So people often have no idea what this word really means. And the problem with the word itself is that it's very broad and people kind of try to retrofit it into different types of events. And in this case, this is a security event, so it's, you know, called like an ir. This has happened on Ethereum before, happens relatively frequently in all software, where there's a team that maybe runs that particular client, in this case the Anza client or the Agovi client by Anza, and they detect the issue. Not sure how they detected it. Maybe it was reported, maybe they just found it through a test.
00:04:08.165 - 00:04:37.823, Speaker A: And then they patch the issue. And then once they patch the issue, what they need to do is they need to get people to adopt the patch. And so that's. That's the process. And this happens on other blockchains all the time. A few months ago, there was an issue with Ethereum's block times, actually, and one of the clients had a problem. And one thing I remember very well was that the client team was kind of just doing a patch behind the scenes.
00:04:37.823 - 00:05:27.887, Speaker A: And then other core devs within Ethereum were like, where are these conversations happening? Right. And so this is not unique to Solana. And in fact, whenever there's a security issue, there will always be a war room to, you know, some set of people understand the system better than others, and they'll try to fix the problem first or try to understand what's going on. And then they'll try to, like, make the case for why it should be adopted, like, whatever the patch is. For example, Samson from Paradigm is kind of the guy that's known for fixing, like, most of the issues because he just has vast knowledge of security issues and interests in that field. And so in this case, what happened was, yeah, so Anza, or at least the Agave client, had the issue. And then the JITO client is obviously a very close fork of it.
00:05:27.887 - 00:06:18.955, Speaker A: And so they worked together on releasing a patch. And then the question becomes, okay, the way a blockchain works obviously is it's a set of computers that are running the same software or some version of that software and what it does. And so if there's a patch, we need to get people to adopt it. And depending on what percent of the network adopts it, there's different conditions. So for example, once the supermajority adopts it, then there's not really an issue for liveness and people don't fork off. And so since it's sensitive, what they did was they reached out to different validators on their own and said, hey, we're going to release a patch. Can you guys be ready once we release, announce it publicly to adopt it.
00:06:18.955 - 00:07:06.149, Speaker A: And they did that to enough people. And this actually took quite a few days from what I understand, like two to three days. And then they obviously made the announcements on Discord. And so, you know, if it weren't decentralized, they could have just pushed that patch and then like two machines would have restarted and that's it. But it was quite a, probably a longer process than I would have liked, actually. And so the criticism of like, decentralization centralization needs to be bounded within some context to like, like, like, what are you trying to say? Are you trying to say the system is centralized? Because if it were, then you have to prove that there's a central force that could take it down. That wasn't the case here.
00:07:06.149 - 00:08:08.043, Speaker A: In fact, it was. The rollout was probably a little slower than I would have liked for a security patch, given that so many different people had to restart the, their, their own machines. And the other point I'd make here is actually it kind of shows you the importance of having very active node operators. So a blockchain is a system, and the system does not care what time it is in Australia or New York. People have to be up to maintain those nodes, and enough of them have to be up such that the system is always running or you're able to easily kind of fix these issues timely. And so being active as a node operator is super important. So this idea of running these nodes passively just because you have some very accessible node requirements or something, and then kind of just letting it run in the background is fun in theory, but generally the problems happen and then somebody needs to be, or some set of people needs to be up to fix those problems.
00:08:08.043 - 00:08:33.465, Speaker A: And so it's actually kind of interestingly in my view, a good example or justification for why it's not necessarily the accessibility of node running that's the most important aspects. It's actually the incentives and the competence of the node operators that matters. And obviously you want to increase the number of competent node operators on the network.
00:08:34.485 - 00:09:53.139, Speaker B: Yeah, and one caveat we should maybe add. You mentioned on the timeliness aspect a bit that we should maybe add for listeners is the reason why a lot of this, you know, like Anza engineers who develop the agave client for Solana, they're saying the reason this needed to be done sort of with coordination outside of public channels is that once you put out the patch it reveals what the vulnerability is. And so if you just sent like a large public message and said, hey, there's a vulnerability like upgrade to this, you know, with this patch people could attack the network. And so you needed to hit a super majority of stake before you could I guess put the patch out publicly just from like publicly available information. It looks like 10am Eastern was when the patch was put out and things didn't go out in public channels until 4pm so that's about six hours in between at least. Just like reading through what the tweets are saying and things like that. Yeah, I don't think it's a bad faith critique in the way that like Solana is a CIA controlled chain or whatever is a bad faith critique.
00:09:53.139 - 00:10:47.535, Speaker B: I don't necessarily like agree with the idea that because validators can coordinate to do things behind closed doors, that is a knock against decentralization. I think that, you know, we live in a world, this Internet world where like outages and bugs are going to be a thing. And so obviously that requires maybe some trade offs or some, you know, private group chats so that there isn't an outage of the chain. Fragmentation is a big problem for Ethereum but also for the subscription industry. We all know the pain of tracking which subscriptions you're paying for and the hassle of trying to cancel them. Well, Access protocol is here to help with a new way to consume content via staking. It's built on Solana and gives you an easy solution to stay up to date on what's happening in the industry by giving you access to your favorite publishers like Coingecko, Cryptoslate and a whole list of independent creators.
00:10:47.535 - 00:11:28.025, Speaker B: The ACS token, that's the access token, is staked to gain access to all of that creator's content without the hassle of managing a subscription. If you want to give it a try, check out the link in the show notes to claim a free NFT that gives you access to a creator's content. I guess, like, this isn't super related to like the current news, but I'm just curious to get your take on the decentralization of, like, Solana validators generally. I know I've seen a tweet from you in the past about the Nakamoto Coefficient. It's something like, technically, 21 validators could work together to bring down the chain. I don't know what the current number is. It's somewhere around 21.
00:11:28.025 - 00:11:47.225, Speaker B: But as we saw with this security patch, the validators know each other, so it's not like it's 21. Separate individuals would all need to work together. Maybe there's two friends. So it is something like 20 or something like that. So just what's your general take on the state of things as far as validators being decentralized?
00:11:48.805 - 00:12:37.135, Speaker A: So a few things there. It's actually not that validators know each other. It's that there are some set of people who know who are in the supermajority or the super minority. So for example, Anza foundation and jito, if you kind of combine those entities, and those are entities with many people inside them, you can probably get them to reach out to enough people such that it's probably 33% of the stake or greater now. And by the way, Solana's locomotive coefficient is not 21. I know that's what the report says, but that's actually not true. It's actually much less than that because some entities run multiple nodes in the network.
00:12:37.135 - 00:13:09.465, Speaker A: And so, for example, Coinbase runs like eight or probably more. There's validator shops who actually run validators of service for other companies. So like, for example, Jupiter's validator is not run by Jupiter. It's run by another infra company, which that company also runs many other validators, which makes up something like 8% of the stake or something. For reference, Helios validator I think is something like 2.5% of the network right now. And it's just like the one that we have.
00:13:09.465 - 00:13:36.177, Speaker A: So just some clarifications on. On the numbers in terms of the decentralization. Decentralization of validators. Well, so decentralization is the property of a system. If you kind of just define it like very explicitly. It's that there's no central point of failure such that, you know, if there's, you know, for example, a car. A car.
00:13:36.177 - 00:14:29.515, Speaker A: There's an engine. If the engine goes down, the car doesn't work, right? You cannot move the car anymore. Now, in a system of 100 nodes, let's say, and the stake is evenly spread, that's decentralized, all other things equal. Because if you take one node out, there's still the 99 others that can still recover the system or make it function. And so in that sense, the system with 100 nodes is not centralized, but it can be relatively more centralized compared to one with 100,000 nodes, all things equal. And so whenever people talk about decentralization, I think it's pretty important to talk about it within the context of some goal, right? Or some time horizon. So Solana right now has, I believe, something like over a thousand validators.
00:14:29.515 - 00:15:17.795, Speaker A: Maybe it's around 1500. I'm not sure the exact numbers. And, you know, people like to kind of cite like the Solana foundation delegation program and be like, that number is like, false. But we actually ran the numbers on this, and it's something like 91% of the stake is profitable without any involvement from Foundation. And so a lot of false numbers around that. In general, what's probably the most interesting when thinking about decentralization of a validator set is there's some set of variables that are. That you need to kind of recursively fix.
00:15:17.795 - 00:15:59.475, Speaker A: So, for example, the thousand validators or the hundred validators, it doesn't matter if there's 100 if they're all in the same city, for example, because that city can just be like, well, this is illegal now. And so you want decentralization kind of recursively among many different dimensions. So you want multiple clients. You want geographical diversity such that they're all kind of differently placed all over the world. You want the stake to be relatively well distributed amongst them. Like if One validator has 90% of the stake, for example, that's obviously not going to work, in which is kind of what the Nakamoto coefficient tries to capture. But I don't think it does a great job.
00:15:59.475 - 00:16:46.025, Speaker A: And so. So basically, the point I'm trying to make is that decentralization is not like this one thing. It's the idea of eliminating central points of failure in a system with many different moving parts. And so when you look at Solana, then you ask, okay, well, what is the point of centralization in Solana that would make it centralized, right? Well, it's not the stake, because the stake is pretty well distributed, all things considered, at least relatively speaking, to other networks. And the good thing about stake is that it's not static, it's dynamic, meaning that Solana has delegated proof of stake so people can delegate their stake to other people as they see fit through the protocol. And so the decentralization is dynamic of the network. It's not like this one thing.
00:16:46.025 - 00:17:24.309, Speaker A: And then you look at kind of the geographical diversity and you see that it's actually in quite many different jurisdictions. I think the stat is something like Solana is in more data centers than most networks have nodes combined. So like, that's quite a few data centers in different jurisdictions and ASNs that would require a very. That has a very low probability of all corrupting at the same time. So that's, let's say, relatively safe. And so you kind of just keep playing this exercise and I keep asking people, like, show me this central vector that would crash the chain. And it's not really there.
00:17:24.309 - 00:17:51.795, Speaker A: The only thing that I think would be a valuable critique in my experience so far, is the client. Yeah, right. So everybody runs the agave client, and then there's the Jito client. And the Jito client is quite similar to the agave client. Um, and so you can say the software, if there's a bug in it, then that's a problem because then everybody else would be. The system would go down. And it has went down in the past due to this reason.
00:17:51.795 - 00:18:44.801, Speaker A: And then you can kind of say like, okay, well, one, there's Firedancer coming and then there's like multiple other clients coming. And then two, what part of the system is affected if that client has an issue? And in the past we've seen that the thing that gets affected is the liveness. Right. Which is to say that the chain will stop producing blocks until the issue is fixed, but the security of the system is still prioritized, meaning that your funds are not actually at risk. It's one of the properties of the system that gets affected from that issue. And then you kind of contrast that with what a blockchain is supposed to achieve, which is in this case of Salon, let's say it's a global state machine that powers, let's say, finance. Well, certainly it's being used by a lot more people than most other blockchains.
00:18:44.801 - 00:19:36.775, Speaker A: I would say maybe even the number one in terms of usage. And so then you say, okay, well, given the fact that it's powering this many things, is it okay, such that these trade offs were made while those trade offs are actually being addressed? And my answer to that is yes. And that's why I built my company on it. But I think like, anything that says like Solana is centralized must show a very clear claim of like, the vector that's actually centralizing. I think the client is probably the only good one that I've seen. And if you say something like, well, Solana centralized because there's only one client, that's not actually accurate, what you would actually want to say is like, Solana's Liveness has a centralizing vector that if the client has a bug, then the second client is not there to fix it. And so Liveness is an issue potentially.
00:19:36.775 - 00:19:38.259, Speaker A: But like, you wouldn't be able to.
00:19:38.267 - 00:20:21.125, Speaker B: Make the same claim about security beyond Liveness, though. Like, and this isn't like my domain of expertise or anything, but I've seen the client diversity thing come up too in terms of governance because, you know, validators vote on like changes to be made to the network or things like that. And if there's only one or like one and a slightly different validator client you can use, then validators don't have an alternative to opt out of if they don't like the way that like Anza engineers build a certain upgrade or something like that. So if you have Fire Dancer, it's been said to me like, you could, you know, opt to go to this other validator client that you, I don't know, like how they built a certain upgrade better.
00:20:21.745 - 00:21:18.555, Speaker A: No, I don't think that would work because in, let's say there's two clients in the clients are actually two different program languages, right? One is in Rust, one's in C. Anytime there's an upgrade, it needs to be in line with the spec of the protocol, right? So there's like the protocol and then there's the implementation of the protocol. The implementation is not what matters. What matters is what's the change. So for example, something that recently passed was. So currently the priority fees that a validator makes, so the block rewards, 50% of those are actually burned and then 50% go to the validator and then a new change passed such that actually 50% burn is being removed and 100% will go back to the validators. Now it doesn't matter which client like, does it which way, like Fire Dancer does it a different way than Anza.
00:21:18.555 - 00:21:56.881, Speaker A: The fact is that the concept of the burn being removed will have to be on both of those things. And so in that case, in that sense, it doesn't actually make sense. And so, and by the way, like, for example, if Anza releases something that's like, hey, like we for example, the patch from yesterday, people can just say, no, we're not going to adopt this by the way. Right. Like they don't have some obligation to adopt it. Now they think it's a good idea to adopt it because otherwise their machines might get exploited because of the vulnerability, but they don't have to do it. Right.
00:21:56.881 - 00:22:28.835, Speaker A: Like if Anza pushes something, nobody has to adopt it. And probably the best example of this is there's pretty frequent network upgrade minor patches like 1.18, 0.1, 8.1, 7.16. And it takes like a lot of time and let's say yelling on Twitter to get people to adopt these patches because they just don't care or they don't, they're not even aware. And so fundamentally a blockchain is just people running software on their machines and they can run whichever version of that software they want.
00:22:28.835 - 00:22:55.295, Speaker A: And the properties of the system are determined by what percent of the system run what, which software patch. Right. So like one 33% runs the same software once, 66%, once, 80%, the properties of the network start changing. And so people can just say, no, we're not going to run this and maybe they'll just fork the network. Like that can happen. That has happened in Ethereum, for example, with the Dow hack.
00:23:00.365 - 00:23:05.985, Speaker B: But you'd need a lot of people to fork the network for it to be a worthwhile thing to do. Right.
00:23:08.645 - 00:23:10.885, Speaker A: It'd be about not the people, but the stake.
00:23:11.005 - 00:23:11.705, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:13.045 - 00:23:19.145, Speaker A: And also you need to bootstrap basically a new blockchain, which is not an easy task.
00:23:19.765 - 00:24:03.905, Speaker B: Yeah, okay, we'll move on from that for now. But a quick digression on the state of decentralization. And Solana, I want to touch quickly on markets. It was a big, you know, week in the market about a week ago, or I guess over the weekend, there was a huge sell off. Crypto fell, you know, double digits, particularly Ethereum. As you know, no one's exactly, as far as I understand, no one's like 100% sure why. But especially Ethereum, it looks like jump crypto was moving a lot of their, like staked ether to exchanges and presumably selling it.
00:24:03.905 - 00:24:38.895, Speaker B: There's also, you know, tensions in the Middle east, slowing job growth. The Japanese yen rates were hiked. So that happens. And then throughout the week, Solana kind of, you know, all crypto assets bounced back, but Solana kind of leads the, the bounce a little bit. And so just right before this call, I took the coingecko data. Solana is down 2.6% on the week Bitcoin is down 5.2%
00:24:38.895 - 00:24:45.195, Speaker B: and ETH is down around 15%. So that's from Friday to Friday.
00:24:47.255 - 00:24:47.519, Speaker A: I.
00:24:47.527 - 00:25:07.745, Speaker B: Guess like Mert, you know, first of all, I saw that you were unable to buy Solana on exchanges because you'd reached your, your maximum. That's. I didn't know that like the Canadian government put maxes on these things. But were you really unable to acquire any soul this week?
00:25:08.365 - 00:25:50.173, Speaker A: I know. Well, I was able to acquire some much less than I would have liked. But yeah, so it's not the Canadian government, but it's the Province of Ontario, which is where like Toronto is. It's a province in Canada, is just a state in US and so they have a limit of 30k CAD. So not even USD Canadian dollars of being able to buy cryptos other than Bitcoin, Ethereum and then Bitcoin cash and Litecoin. So Solana you cannot buy 30k plus of Solana with within any Ontario exchange. And so what I've had to do is just keep spinning up new exchange accounts and there's only so many exchanges now.
00:25:50.173 - 00:26:09.225, Speaker A: You can do some other things like you can just get USDT or USDC and then send it to your on chain wallet and then swap. But like it's just so much friction and bizarre arbitrary regulations. So yeah, I was able to get some.
00:26:09.525 - 00:26:47.601, Speaker B: I think that's interesting in and of itself. It's a bit of a digression, but it seems like there's this kind of legacy effect with things like Litecoin which isn't a super relevant crypto today. But things like bit pay or I don't know, legacy crypto payment services will accept it and Solana is not as widely accepted I find if you go to, I don't know, like a pizza shop in New York might accept Dogecoin but it wouldn't accept Solana. I think that's like an interesting trend in and of itself. And there were no limits on Litecoin purchases, I guess as you mentioned as well.
00:26:47.793 - 00:27:33.929, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean Solana is still quite early, which people kind of seem to sometimes overlook. But really it's just about like, I mean people say three years and I guess it's kind of three years old, but really it's more like two and a half years and that's pretty short. I mean, especially when you view it within the context of regulation and politics. I'm surprised you know what it is, honestly. And so still have a lot of work to do and it's quite young with regards to the market movements that you mentioned earlier. Yeah, I saw a lot of weird tinfoil theories around this. You know, jump is exiting crypto and stuff, which is, by the way, just not true.
00:27:33.929 - 00:28:10.385, Speaker A: Jump is not exiting crypto at all. They might be unwinding the eth position to do something else, which I'm not going to like speculate on. But the most viable theory that I saw was it's basically the exact same amount as the wormhole hack from like two years ago, the amount of the hack versus the amount that was actually taken out. And so sometimes these trading guys might, you know, to pay back a position like that, might actually go along on the position first to get it and then unwind after, and then they're not going to be bothered by other market forces. So I thought that was.
00:28:11.685 - 00:28:21.985, Speaker B: But it's a weird time. It's a weird time to unwind, right? Like as markets generally were crashing, that Jump would choose then to unwind the wormhole position.
00:28:22.445 - 00:29:31.165, Speaker A: Yeah, it's unclear to me exactly which sequence of events happened first. And so I just don't even think about it because people can come up with all sorts of explanations that don't really result to any meaning. But yeah, I mean, the one thing that I would say is this used to happen on Solana quite frequently, right? Like when FTX crashed, the USD amount went to like $8 for Seoul in people on Twitter, since Twitter is largely dictated by fallacious thinking of traders. And let's say market participants mistakenly thought that Solana was dying or that there's something super wrong with it, or you know, there's like a fundamental flaw, it was dying, everybody's leaving. 75 developers, all not. And now people seem to have applied the opposite, which is that, well, okay, Solana, since it's not down as much, it's great and it's this best chain possible and it's better than Ethereum and it's going to flip everything. And that's also incorrect, right? Like it's the mirror image of the other type of thinking in the other direction.
00:29:31.165 - 00:30:03.075, Speaker A: And what I would say to be very careful of is do not let the price actually interfere with your thinking of how these systems work. Fundamentally. Solana still has tons of problems. I mean, there was a security patch yesterday. There's still only one client. One really or two clients, but really one actual client. Transaction confirmations are still high and they have high latency.
00:30:03.075 - 00:30:40.605, Speaker A: Reading the data is still difficult. Smart contract frameworks still are not great. We still don't have many great apps that work or are sustainable, there's a lot of problems. And so do not let the price do your thinking for you, because markets are just markets. You're not going to make sense of them. And then similarly, the fact that Ethereum went down much more does not mean Ethereum is inherently garbage or way worse than it was before. In fact, you could argue that Ethereum is scaling much better than before and that's part of the reason why the prices are going down.
00:30:40.605 - 00:31:28.631, Speaker A: Because now there's maybe this narrative of the value capture of ETH not being as great as it was, but I don't think that's a bad thing for Ethereum. I think it's a bad thing for the previous theory of why Ethereum was highly valued, which is this ultrasound theory. And you know, a lot of us criticize the shit out of this back in the day and we're kind of laughed at. But looking back, I mean, it clearly was the correct theory because now it's happening. And so what you need to do is disregard the previous theory of ultrasound money and move on to a new one that is maybe more compelling and more accurate and captures future variants better. But that's not to say Ethereum is inherently worse now. In fact, it's probably better actually.
00:31:28.631 - 00:32:34.669, Speaker A: It's definitely better. There's more people working on it and it scales better. And once L2s are to a point where they reach stage two and maybe like blob fees are increased or like that fee mechanism is a bit better determined. And the other thing that really makes me angry Is like these L2s are capturing all these fees and those fees aren't necessarily a result of demand as much as they are a result of the sequencers and the limits on the L2s being super inefficient. And so it's like a steam engine requiring more energy to function as opposed to, well, electric engine requires less energy to function, it's just more efficient in. So the dynamics there are a little weird, which is why L2s maybe are going the L3 route a little bit as well, which is a whole other thing. But my TLDR of the market movements in the past week or two is to make sure you don't over interpret them and extrapolate them to things that don't represent reality.
00:32:34.669 - 00:32:47.365, Speaker A: The reality is that these systems are all kind of ass in their own ways and they suck in many different ways. And there's still a lot of work to do on all fronts, not just Ethereum, but also Solana.
00:32:47.485 - 00:33:53.359, Speaker B: Yeah, you know, I Don't, I don't spend a lot of time on markets because they're only so interesting. But they do matter insofar as like a lot of people that follow crypto have crypto investments and their, their like continued interest in it probably is related to seeing a financial return. And yeah, it's, it's really interesting to me, you know, how unaffected by the ETF approval ETH was. Like that was such an unexpected event. You know, it wasn't something that was priced in, in May it seemed like people didn't see it coming and now what, two, three months since it's trading far lower. It never hit an all time high like Bitcoin, did it? It's about at the levels it was added mid January. And so yeah, obviously prices don't speak to the validity of the Ethereum technology or the types of things that it can build.
00:33:53.359 - 00:35:23.819, Speaker B: But you know, it matters to people that are in crypto because they're trading crypto. And you know, if I'm a young bright software engineer in college somewhere, I'm probably, you know, gambling day trading crypto and then maybe I'm interested in coding as well. Am I going to want to build something on Ethereum, you know, which has this really uninspiring price action or somewhere like Solana that, that has traded better. So I think it, it has some real world implications even if markets aren't, you know, perfectly rationally aligned with the value of the tech or things like that, that, like if I had to build a case for why market movements matter, it would be to that extent. I, I also am just curious, you know, or I'll be interested to watch like, what does a, like why does no one care about the ETH ETF seemingly in the markets and B, if you know, Solana ETFs down the road are approved, is it similarly not super important to price action? And you know, what's the pivot for eth narrative wise? There's lots of interesting downstream questions from this week.

Thanks again to My prize for sponsoring today's episode.
00:35:41.471 - 00:36:18.317, Speaker A: Well, I. Markets are not like, I don't know who was it that said, sometimes something like, short term, it's a popularity contest, long term, it's like a weighing machine or something to that extent. And it's. You just got to be very careful. Like, for example, when you're building a startup, you're not necessarily building for what the market is today. I mean, you are to an extent, but you also need to consider what the market could be, and you need to take some action in the world to get to that stage. Right? Like Peter Thiel will say, you don't want to start from a big market.
00:36:18.317 - 00:37:01.935, Speaker A: You want to start from a small market that you can actually monopolize and then grow from that market. And I think there's a lot of interesting downstream effects of that type of thinking, which is to say that it's not only the market where it is today that matters. It's also what you. Your theories or your conjectures about what that market will look like over time as people gain other types of knowledge. So, for example, when we were building on Solana, on. When solana was at $8, my thing wasn't. Well, because we're a developer platform at Helios, right? We're like, okay, well, are there going to be now less developers that come into Solana today and that'll affect our business and we'll have to pivot.
00:37:01.935 - 00:38:20.095, Speaker A: That wasn't my thinking. I was considered, but my thinking was actually, well, once people understand that the set of. Once people gain the knowledge that actually, if you look at the landscape of blockchains today, this is kind of one of the few places where you can actually build things that scale, that kind of low cost and high speeds. And as we see this play out in reality over the next X months, then those developers will actually start coming, but then we'll be more ready to support them. And so, you know, just looking at price action on its own without having some external theories to, like, what will happen or what the purpose of what you're trying to achieve, I think doesn't work. And that's why I think, like, the fact that traders basically rule the discourse on Twitter is, like, pretty shitty because it really dilutes the thinking of some of these, like you said, like, you know, aspiring software engineers or something, because they just look at like, oh, well, the price went down, therefore, I didn't make money, therefore, X, you know, whatever. But really, what you need to have is some theory on what will happen and how you will kind of go about the world and does that get affected by short term price action? Right.
00:38:20.095 - 00:39:03.685, Speaker A: Like arguably your time horizon as a builder is going to be like 10, 20 years or at the very least much longer than a trader. Now a trader might freak out because their position is unwinding or some shit and you know they're going to go underwater in two days. But a builder, that should not defect or deter them because their time horizon is much longer to begin with. So, so in all cases it all just depends on the context in the individual that's kind of acting as an agent in that system. And so again I think if you're a builder, the markets, you should be very skeptical of markets in the short term as a trader, do what you want. I don't, I'm not a trader.
00:39:04.345 - 00:40:02.965, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly, yeah. I think the short term versus long term thinking is a good thing to call out. I think it would be silly to say that prices don't matter long term. If you think about like the Internet, you could have been, you know, had booked major losses in the dot com collapse, but if you were investing in tech throughout those years, you would be fabulously wealthy now. And I think the success of like a world that runs on cryptographic or like crypto rails is going to depend on prices long term to some extent. I just, you know, can't think that if these tokens don't continue to rally that, you know, you can continue to have the same level of excitement and investment from VC and that kind of thing. I guess to bookend this, this section, I'll do a little lore drop for myself, you know, so I buy Soul like all the time for the Lightspeed Newsletter.
00:40:02.965 - 00:40:48.185, Speaker B: You know, I want to play around with the protocols that I write about and stuff. But the only time I've bought Solana as like an investor in a serious way was November of 2021. And it's been a little bit since I've looked, but I think it was like literally the day that it hit an all time high. I was in college at the time. We were getting our stimulus checks and everyone was like, you should, you know, you should get into crypto and Ethereum and smart contracts and these things. I studied sociology so I was not deep into this stuff but I read somewhere that Solana was the eth killer and so I bought some Solana on Coinbase and it is, it's still underwater and I just don't look at it. It's bad for my mental health.
00:40:48.185 - 00:41:58.309, Speaker B: But that's the extent to which I've traded so. So please don't take trading advice from me. Ever. And Mert, hopefully the Canadian government liberates you at some point. Okay so I want to talk a little bit about or as well we may or may not be having a hard hat chat on the pod at some point so there will be maybe a more in depth discussion but it's been a thing this week so. Or is this like experimental currency on Solana that sort of tries to apply proof of work, which is the, you know, way that that Bitcoin is secured and tries to run it on Solana. So it, you know, essentially you can put like a program on your command line interface on your computer or through the backpack wallet and mine these tokens back in April or was created out of the Coliseum like hackathon.
00:41:58.309 - 00:42:47.771, Speaker B: It was very popular and perhaps a little too popular. Caused a lot of congestion on the Solana network. Issues with getting transactions to land and that kind of stuff. Hardhat Chad who's like the pseudonymous pseudonymous developer behind or spent a few months working on it and released or v2 this week I did a piece for the Lightspeed newsletter about or I'm just going to say I really like it. I try to call balls and strikes, you know and, and for me or is really fun. It kind of evokes a time when you could mine Bitcoin on a laptop and it wasn't something that only people with, you know, warehouses full of Asics could do. Obviously it's not like Bitcoin 2.0.
00:42:47.771 - 00:43:21.989, Speaker B: I think people should be careful to make that claim. It like takes its security from the Solana network or it inherits it but I've had a lot of fun doing it. You know, I don't know anything about how computers work but I was like mining it through the terminal on my Mac and that that felt fun and you know, I lost money but I still thought that it was an enjoyable way to spend 10 bucks on like priority fees and yeah, I I don't know. Mert, are you mining ore what's what's. What's been your experience?
00:43:22.117 - 00:43:59.131, Speaker A: I don't mind or myself. Some people on my team do like some of my D and I think it's pretty fun. The concept is pretty cool. The my exposure to it has been through the RPC provider lens where people tend to like because RPCs are meant for developers but then or is actually like people who are developer or just regular users go to mine it and then that's kind of their introduction to RPCs in a sense. And then they kind of like don't understand how it works and they just blame the rpc. And then it's kind of like this whole thing. So that's been my experience.
00:43:59.131 - 00:44:30.093, Speaker A: We've been working with Hard Hat Chat to like help fix some of the bugs in his programs and stuff and also helping him with like, here's how you set a good priority fee, here's the ranges. And I just had some suggestions on. You should probably let users set their own fees so that it's not like. Because through the web app it just sets it for you. But then if it does that for everybody, then it's just like chance versus. I mean, proof of work is inherently chance. But if you let people kind of.
00:44:30.093 - 00:44:46.813, Speaker A: Because it's an auction, basically, if you let people set their own fees, then you can kind of. I think that'd be a more interesting dynamic. And, and so, yeah, my experience to it has been through, through the RPC provider lens. We do have the high. Yeah, go ahead.
00:44:46.949 - 00:45:23.925, Speaker B: The cool thing about it as well, mentioning like the chance aspect, is that. So the way bitcoin is mined is that, you know, everyone participates in the proof of work algorithm. And then you might receive the bitcoin reward every 10 minutes or whatever it is on ore you mine or every minute. And then you get a piece of the one ore that is mined, if that makes sense. And so it's like a, it's like a casino effect every minute where you're always getting some reward. But how big it is depends on how difficult the hash that you produced was. So it's kind of fun for that reason.
00:45:23.925 - 00:45:36.785, Speaker B: It's like more like a higher hit rate than bitcoin, even if it's very, very small increments of ore in my experience. But. Sorry I cut you off, but that was an interesting caveat I noticed while playing around with it.
00:45:37.205 - 00:45:59.081, Speaker A: Yeah, I think proof of work is like this thing that when you first get into crypto you're like, oh, this is pretty cool. And then you go back into proof of stake and then you're like, okay, this is maybe better. But then you're like, wait a minute. Actually proof of work was pretty good. And so I, you know, I like it. I like just playing around with different ideas and seeing how they could be used. So I think it's a pretty good.
00:45:59.081 - 00:46:33.275, Speaker A: I like the fact that it stress tests the network. The one thing I don't like about it is that it just kind of leads people to make false claims about RPCs which they don't understand. And so if you are one of these people and you're listening to this, just ask me. Because like, when people are like, oh, well, like Helios, RPC for this doesn't work. It's like, well, you pride and actually set the fee correctly and stuff like that. So it's a good. It kind of maybe just outlines how much more education we need to do in iterations on ux, et cetera, but I think the idea fundamentally is awesome.
00:46:33.695 - 00:47:26.645, Speaker B: Yeah, I think too there's definitely a conversation unfolding right now in crypto about like, where are the usable apps for retail that aren't like things like Coinbase and you know, I've played the Telegram mini apps. I've. I've done Hamster Combat and tapped my screen a million times to me, or is like an actually fun crypto app. And it is financial and I did have to like pay money to, to use the app, but. And you know, who knows if in a week I'll still be mining ore. But for the couple of days that I was doing an article, I was like, couldn't help but check my, you know, my terminal on my Mac over and over because it's this like, fun kind of connection to like crypto history and feeling like you're in early on Bitcoin or whatever, which is something you can't really replicate. And then secondly, it kind of.
00:47:26.645 - 00:48:00.285, Speaker B: It does have like a casino effect in that your difficulty for mining ore changes every minute, but, like, not in a way that your meme coin is going to dump 99% in a minute and you lose all your money. So it's. I don't know, I'm bullish on or. In my personal opinion, I think it's actually one of the cooler apps I've used and I've used a fair amount of crypto apps at this point in search of ones that are fun for kind of normies to use. I think this is a good place to look.
00:48:01.265 - 00:48:15.085, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, certainly we need more fun apps in crypto that people actually care to use and not just use for the promise of future money that's going to be freely dropped from the skies. So, you know, love it.
00:48:15.245 - 00:49:02.645, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm going to, I'm going to wrap that section there because again, we're. We were going to have our dad chat on the pod, but then he had to put out like a V2 of or V2, so we had to postpone it. But I think that is going to be coming at Some point, so we won't dive too deeply into it. So maybe where we'll end off is. We touched on this a little bit earlier, Mert, but it's been just like following the kind of Twitter discourse this week, as I unfortunately have to do day after day in my job. It seems like there's recently been just a lot of like these bad faith rumors or whatever being spread on on Twitter. You know, one that, that made the rounds was that Solana was initially developed by the CIA.
00:49:02.645 - 00:49:30.175, Speaker B: There was another one last week about like something about an FTX whistleblower. I didn't look too deeply into it, but it seems like there's been several of these, like, and obviously there's always people tweeting stuff, but it seems like it's been more pronounced in the past week and these tweets tend to get a lot of engagement, so it's maybe worth touching on briefly. Just for that reason. I don't know what's been your, your take your thoughts on these as they've gone around.
00:49:31.335 - 00:50:39.595, Speaker A: Yeah, so the way I think about these is basically they're akin to religious myths, right? So, you know, the, the sun rises because there's a big ox with a tray of the sun on its horns walking around Earth and everything revolves around the earth or while seasons happen because, you know, Persephone, the goddess of Earth, whatever gets mad and goes away and starts spewing flames and shit. I think it's the same principle. Like, people see something that they don't understand, like, for example, why their bag is going down versus other bags relatively. And so then you must conjure up an explanation in that explanation supposedly makes you feel better about why the thing is happening. Now, of course, those explanations are totally far fetched and just extremely stupid, but that is kind of the psychology behind them and so they'll always exist. And since many other people feel, let's say in disarray of what's happening to the markets and their financial, well, beings, in a sense, they're like, oh, yeah, okay, I like that. Maybe that is why it happened.
00:50:39.595 - 00:51:07.557, Speaker A: And so like, critical thinking goes out the window for thinking itself goes out the window, it seems, and people just want the dopamine machine to keep feeding them. And so that's kind of how I look at it. You know, I'm not even sure how to tackle that. That is a CIA change. Because, like, what? Or, but, but, but like, I think.
00:51:07.661 - 00:51:10.185, Speaker B: What do you know, Mert? What are you hiding now?
00:51:11.045 - 00:52:15.229, Speaker A: Yeah, it's just, it would be like first of all. Have you seen how incompetent garment institutions are? Do you think they could actually ship something like this without it being like leaked in some regard? Especially given crypto's nature of like anti authority authoritarians in whistleblowers and shit? And so it's just stupid. But so the way I think about it is I think it's useful to have the lens of like, people just need explanations for why their shit doesn't work. And if you actually look at it, the answer is much more complex. And so people don't want to think of it that way. Like, you can't say like, oh well, 4844 was merged, which caused the DA blobs to go down, which caused the L2s to not pay as much money to eat, which caused ETH to not make as much money at the same time that Solana was taking off. And so if you look at both those things and then look at the set of investors who were early who choose to allocate based on some other criteria that we don't even know of, then you get kind of the price and then you, you know, add in Hamas and then you add in Israel and then you add in Japan, and then you get this.
00:52:15.229 - 00:52:23.549, Speaker A: That's not a sufficient explanation for the dopamine fiends. And so people just make up religious myths and this is just one of them.
00:52:23.717 - 00:52:43.855, Speaker B: The issue though is that cults, both in the real world and in blockchains, can make a lot of money. And so I don't know if that sort of impulse is going to go anywhere anytime soon. But look, we're at time, but Mert, been a pleasure. It's been a fun roundup and we'll see you next week.
