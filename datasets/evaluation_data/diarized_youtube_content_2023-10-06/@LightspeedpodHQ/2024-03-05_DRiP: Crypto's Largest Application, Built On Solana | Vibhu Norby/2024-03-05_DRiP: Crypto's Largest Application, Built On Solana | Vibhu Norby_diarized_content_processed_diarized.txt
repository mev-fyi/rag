00:00:00.170 - 00:00:18.266, Speaker A: Reality is that there's 7 billion people in the world and there's like, I don't know, not that many millions of people interacting on chain. So our mission at the moment is just like, find new ways to grow and find high quality users and bring them in and get them started for free, and then let them kind of fire their way into becoming a higher quality retained user.
00:00:18.378 - 00:00:48.730, Speaker B: All right, everyone, before we get into the episode today, I want to talk a bit about access protocol. They're built on Salana and solving the subscription problem in a crypto native way. We'll talk more about them later in the show. Before we get moving on today's episode, just a quick disclaimer. The views expressed on this podcast by either myself, my cohost, or any guests are their personal views and do not represent the views of any associated organization. Nothing in the episode should be construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal, or any other advice. Okay, let's jump into the episode.
00:00:48.730 - 00:01:24.054, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Lightspeed. We are joined today by Vibu, the founder of Drip, and this is a second appearance on the episode. You joined us about six months ago and really had a great conversation around all of the work you guys are doing on building a consumer application on Solana. But I would definitely recommend to the audience to kind of go back and listen to that to get a ground zero on what Drip is and what they're doing. But for those who won't, I do want to give a quick, high level overview of the product you guys are building and the problem you're aiming to solve. If you could just kick us off there.
00:01:24.092 - 00:01:24.870, Speaker C: Bibu.
00:01:25.370 - 00:01:53.570, Speaker A: Sure. Drip is kind of a first of its kind platform where people can earn free collectibles from creators, people that make art, music, videos, brands, and other games. We kind of think of ourselves as kind of taking Instagram and Patreon and mixing it with digital ownership. And it's been a really fun and exciting product for many, many people that are in Solana, but also coming from outside of Solana.
00:01:54.390 - 00:02:09.000, Speaker C: And why did you choose to create this mix of different platforms? What problem did you see that was present in the markets or the experience today that you were like, no, something different needs to exist. What is the problem?
00:02:10.410 - 00:02:46.046, Speaker A: Well, there's a whole bunch. I think I would probably start with saying that creators don't get paid on the Internet. Know, at the end of the day, some of our greatest platforms, YouTube, Instagram, and so on, basically made a decision a long time ago. They didn't need to pay anybody for the content that they made. They could run advertising on top of it. Only about the top 1% or lesser creators are actually making real income from these things that they're contributing to. Second of all, the Internet's user experience has gotten worse and worse.
00:02:46.046 - 00:03:11.180, Speaker A: Every single year of my life, it's been overrun by paywall. It's been overrun by subscriptions. Who doesn't have the problem where they have 20 different $15 subscriptions a month? They have no idea what they're paying for. These are things that there's ads everywhere. It's rampant. Someone sends you a link to an article that you want to read, and then you read the first paragraph, you start scrolling, and boom, there's a paywall. You got to pay a dollar to unlock it or whatever.
00:03:11.180 - 00:03:27.920, Speaker A: We've gotten to a place where I think the Internet has just become disappointing. The content creators are frustrated, and, yeah, we kind of walked ourselves into it with drip. I think crypto has the primitives to really change the game.
00:03:29.090 - 00:03:38.398, Speaker C: Can you be a bit more specific? Like, why would drip and tokenizing content, in a sense, help with those problems? And maybe which problems do they help with the most, specifically?
00:03:38.574 - 00:04:20.046, Speaker A: Yeah. So my belief is that the reason that the Internet's user experience has gotten so bad is actually because of the missing micro payments model. I think we have put ourselves in a situation where everything has a very artificial barrier on top of it. Right. If you want to buy a single piece of content today, you can't really buy it for anything less than a couple of dollars. The margins with credit card fees and all that kind of stuff start to not make that much sense. And so what has kind of happened with the Internet is that we have most content experiences are being aggregated in some way where they're bundling lots of things that you don't want to listen to on Spotify with things that you do want to listen to.
00:04:20.046 - 00:05:00.800, Speaker A: You kind of pay for all of it regardless of what you do or don't listen to. Right, in that particular context, and you kind of see that same model happen all over the place. What crypto and what Salana specifically allows us to do is to pay creators at the smallest fractions of a cent very efficiently. When someone subscribes to a creator on drip, they're effectively paying something like four cents per month on average. So now, all of a sudden, instead of being able to spend $10 a month on one subscription, you can subscribe to hundreds of creators for that same amount of money. And it's much more direct. The content creator is receiving that directly from the end consumer of it.
00:05:00.800 - 00:05:52.218, Speaker A: I also believe that crypto provides some really interesting mechanics for distributing content directly from the creator over to the user that is receiving it. And this has this property of allowing a creator to kind of own their audience in a way that they don't in web two, simply because the creator is delivering their content directly to the end person. All that data lives on chain on Solana itself. And so should the creator become uninterested in working with drip or drip shuts down or something like that? The content still lives forever, and the creator themselves can take their audience somewhere else. I think from provenance and from payments, those are kind of the two angles that we think a lot about.
00:05:52.304 - 00:06:29.240, Speaker B: So you mentioned that just the upgrade of an experience for creators, largely, right, is the fact that you can kind of get paid for your work. And the ad based model of web two doesn't tend to efficiently distribute that to anyone outside of the top 1%. And so I kind of think there'd be spinning drip up from ground zero. There'd be this, like, chicken or the egg problem, right? Like, creators want to build for users, but users aren't going to come to a platform with no creators. And so how has that experience been throughout Drip's existence? And which side are you finding is harder to kind of create the initial inertia for?
00:06:31.930 - 00:07:19.458, Speaker A: Well, at this point, we don't have any problems because we've kind of been able to crack that nut. In the very beginning, it was very hard to recruit creators to the platform. I think what we were doing from the crypto side of things was very uncomfortable. Right. We were kind of entering a world where a lot of artists were producing very scarce pieces, right, one of ones editions of 25 or 100. And what we were proposing was that they stopped thinking about scarcity as the primary thing, but instead think about the distribution mechanism as the most important part of what they were doing on chain. And to be honest, for a really long time, most creators dismissed the model, didn't want to do it, but we were really lucky to have the ultimate chicken, which was Djen poet.
00:07:19.458 - 00:07:51.570, Speaker A: He's laying a thousand golden eggs right now for creators. Like, he took a huge risk to move his business over to drip when there was no monetization. There's really nothing going on. And he was a creator who, previous to us, made millions of dollars with his on chain art. So it was a pretty big deal for him to take that leap. And since then, we've kind of just as we've expanded the product, made it better, we've been able to start to tap into a wider and wider crew there. I never worry about the collector side, to be honest.
00:07:51.570 - 00:08:19.482, Speaker A: I think we're kind of in the business of giving people free gifts, free things that are tradable, that can make the money. Everyone likes content. Everyone likes getting free stuff. So to date, that's kind of not my focus. It's really like enabling creators that understand this medium and can build a business around collectibles, around themselves.
00:08:19.616 - 00:08:56.006, Speaker C: One thing I've noticed is a lot of people are now trying to maybe follow similar models, right? Kind of creating a curated channel for content in a sense, but with cryptorials, and sometimes they might do it in more focused ways, like maybe just written content. And obviously, things like Instagram are just pictures. At first, TikTok was just videos, but I noticed that drip is very specifically just content, which is kind of a general umbrella. So I have two questions for that. One is, first, how do you just think about the competition that has risen up?
00:08:56.108 - 00:09:00.106, Speaker A: And then two, what do you think.
00:09:00.128 - 00:09:08.890, Speaker C: About content just being very general and abstract in drip sense, versus something more focused, like a mirror XYZ, where it's just very opinionated?
00:09:10.050 - 00:10:10.734, Speaker A: Yeah, those are good questions. There are things that we ask ourselves a lot, too. One of the things that I don't like about kind of web two, social media is that evolves to be very. It's a situation where if you're like a musician, for example, today in web two, you are publishing your music in ten different places, you're posting behind the scenes and advertisements on Instagram, you're making YouTube videos, you're now doing TikTok stuff. You kind of end up having to build an audience, like 20 times over. And the reason that that's the case is because there's no portability of audience, right? Even if you're the biggest creator in the world and you built an audience on Twitch, like Ninja did four or five years ago when he was the biggest creator in esports, Microsoft signed him to a deal to go and stream at Mixer, and his audience didn't come with him. Right.
00:10:10.734 - 00:10:41.978, Speaker A: You can do as much marketing as you want as a creator. You can be as big as you want. But the fact is, getting someone to move from one place if they enjoy content to somewhere else is very difficult. So I feel like web two kind of evolved around content mediums instead of creators themselves. That doesn't really make that much sense on chain, right? Because your audience lives on chain. It's kind of yours to own. And so when you build around the creator, you realize that a musician is making videos, they're making songs, they're making art, they're making all kinds of stuff around themselves.
00:10:41.978 - 00:11:20.094, Speaker A: Why shouldn't that live in a single place around and inside of their subscribers wallets in this case? So I personally think that's what creators want out of it. That being said, I think where drip is kind of weak is that we are trying to build an experience that's kind of best for everything, but it may not be the best for any specific niche. So if I were thinking about competing with drip as another founder, I might carve out specific areas and really dive into music or videos or art or things that we're probably never going to service to the highest degree because we're trying to build something that works for everybody.
00:11:20.232 - 00:12:00.526, Speaker B: All right, quick break from the episode here to talk to you about access protocol, the easiest and best way to stay updated on what's happening in crypto. By following your favorite publishers, you can gain access to over 60 publishers, including Coin, Gecko, crypto, Slate, and a whole list of independent creators. Most importantly, you can also do this without managing a bunch of different subscriptions. We all know how painful that can be. So how it works is you find your favorite publishers, you stake the ACs token, that's the access token. And once you stake, you gain access to all of that creator's content without the hassle of ads or subscriptions that you can't cancel or lose track of how many you have. Access protocol already has over 225,000 users that are finding new creators, reading content and even receiving NFTs from their favorite creators.
00:12:00.526 - 00:12:32.258, Speaker B: They're soon releasing V two, so check it out. The link in the description to go give the protocol a try. It's an awesome product. It's crypto native and it's built on Salana. When you think about the user experience side, that's been a long standing crypto pain point, right? Where you have to have a wallet. And if you're already not an onchain user, that is a very uncomfortable experience. Even with how far wallets have come over the past six to twelve months, you still have to have this awkward web app that's injected into your browser and have this clunky seed phrase.
00:12:32.258 - 00:12:53.410, Speaker B: And how do you think about that when you think about expanding beyond just like this initial world of onchain users today? Is that this weird barrier to entry that every application is going to have to overcome? Or do you think people will just end up becoming comfortable with the crypto ux that's just needed. Right. You just have to use this phantom wallet.
00:12:53.830 - 00:13:33.810, Speaker A: I've written many times that I think that the current wallet experience is just really difficult for people that are new. Most common thing that happens, I hear this all the time, I mean, literally every day, because drip is an entry point for so many people that are new to crypto. They'll dm us and tell us their wallet was drained or whatever that they set up just for drip. Right. People, wallets today don't really protect users at all from self custody. Self custody is an advanced concept to me. It's something that imagine, I don't know, you have your trad bank account and someone else could get it if they simply tricked you into connecting to it and you had no recourse.
00:13:33.810 - 00:14:18.890, Speaker A: It's a really tough situation for people that are not technical at all. Obviously, it's gotten better, but I still don't think it's ideal. I think it's one of the big challenges that we need to solve, and we're going to be fixing that with our mobile app, which comes out in, like, April may ish timeframe that ships with an embedded wallet inside of it. So your experience of signing up for drip will be the same as signing up for Facebook or anything like that. You sign up for email. That being said, there's no avoiding self custody. And I think one of the beautiful things about on chain content is that it's composable.
00:14:18.890 - 00:14:50.438, Speaker A: You can trade it in tensor, you can play these burn games that other people have made. There's all kinds of utilities that have been built around drip, and an embedded wall doesn't really do the job. So how we think about it is land everybody with two wallets. So when you're a beginner, you get the embedded wall. You kind of have that base experience where we're protecting you as much as possible, but in your settings, you'll select, like, an advanced thing that says, I understand the self custody wall. I know how to keep my assets safe. Let me connect this here.
00:14:50.438 - 00:15:17.314, Speaker A: You check the box. Now the connect to phantom button will appear, and you'll kind of create a link between those two things. But what we're planning to do is to have both of them running at the same time. So by default, everything drops into your drip wallet, but you'll be able to gaslessly take those assets out of that wallet and move them to your phantom. We'll pay for it. If you kind of want to access that advanced utility. So, yeah, it's kind of a spectrum, right.
00:15:17.314 - 00:15:49.850, Speaker A: I think this kind of thing makes the decentralization people very concerned, because now we are kind of like in this moment of time, in control of those assets. But we feel like it's more important to protect the new people than it is to satisfy the people that are already here. Because the reality is that there's 7 billion people in the world and there's like, I don't know, not that many millions of people interacting on chain. So we kind of have to solve that problem first before we let them on their own.
00:15:50.000 - 00:16:31.000, Speaker B: Yeah, it's really interesting. I feel like a lot of this self custody maximalism, if you will, just kind of spurred out of the ideas of crypto's origin story coming from bitcoin and being that kind of like new form of a currency. But when we fast forward many years later to today, consumer apps were never part of the bitcoin equation back in the day. Right? And now we're trying to build things for everyday people. And even if you think about DeFi, it still feels uncomfortable that you mentioned your banking account. You just plug that into an application and maybe I approve some contract and I wake up and I have no money left, and there's no takesy backseas. It's done and over with.
00:16:31.370 - 00:17:21.254, Speaker A: I feel this every time I open my wallet and I see how much I have in there and I'm thinking, oh my God, I cannot believe this is just sitting in a one pass for private key or like seed phrase somewhere. Right? It's really scary. It's really terrifying. I don't know how to fix that. But I do think, to your point, sovereignty is like a foundational piece of crypto and why it exists. At the same time, I think we've discovered other things about crypto that are very useful, which includes provenance, which includes identity and payments. There's lots of things that crypto has unlocked that I think the user's experience of that doesn't have to rotate around understanding how the security model works.
00:17:21.254 - 00:17:43.120, Speaker A: But again, I think users should have that opportunity if they want it. I'm not about sort of like, I want to use self custody for drip. I think apps could do well to understand that they have two different types of users, some that are very new and some that are very advanced and give them different ways to use the application.
00:17:43.970 - 00:18:07.526, Speaker B: Yeah. To me, it seems all about optionality, right? Give the users the opportunity to self custody their assets. That is what a lot of people in this industry today want. But I just like the angle that you're taking of giving people, like, an option B of this is complicated. We understand it's clunky, we'll do it for you. But here's the steps that if you want to do it on your own, I just love that angle. But I want to rewind a little bit to this mobile app you mentioned.
00:18:07.526 - 00:18:17.290, Speaker B: Is this going to be available on Apple, Android and Solana phone, or what's your release plan there? And if it's on Apple and Android, were there any challenges of getting into those stores?
00:18:18.110 - 00:18:47.378, Speaker A: Well, so if you want to use the drip app, it's going to be first available to people that have the soccer phone. So that's going to be our beta test group. Why? Those are the most committed, Diehard Solana users out there. They're the best people to throw out the app and see what they kind of come back with. Plus, the guy that's kind of leading mobile worked on the phone, so I know he's very comfortable with the nuances of the operating system. But, yeah, it's going to be an iOS Android. We haven't crossed the bridge yet.
00:18:47.378 - 00:18:58.502, Speaker A: We have no reason to think that it's going to be a challenge, though, because the app itself, for all intents and purposes, it lives off chain. The front end lives off chain. The only thing that really is on chain are the collectibles at the end of the day.
00:18:58.556 - 00:18:58.886, Speaker C: Is that.
00:18:58.908 - 00:18:59.094, Speaker A: Right?
00:18:59.132 - 00:19:15.598, Speaker C: Because you now have these concepts of droplets, right, where you can actually purchase these things to maybe tip creators with and increase the probability of getting different types of drops. Would that be done through the mobile app as well? Because if so, that seems like they would want to cut of that.
00:19:15.764 - 00:19:35.934, Speaker A: Yeah, they'll take a cut of it. Those are off chain, so we're not selling you a token. Droplets are most like other things in mobile games, right? We sell you packs. It's a virtual currency. Yeah, you got to pay Apple. There was no avoiding it. It's terrible.
00:19:35.934 - 00:20:22.740, Speaker A: I think we're still trying to figure out, are we increasing the price for those, for people that are on an iPhone or are we just swallowing the hit? It's pretty tough, though, because ultimately that 30% that you pay after a million dollars of sales, that's money coming straight out of the creators pockets and our pockets in the day. That's brutal. It's really tough. Our hope is that people fall in love with the experience. I think the app payments can be maybe even a loss leader for people discovering the utility of droplets. And then when they're ready, they can pop into Phantom and pay with crypto or whatever and get a big discount. Seems like a decent path for me.
00:20:23.510 - 00:20:54.218, Speaker C: So, talking about mobile, we had Dan Romero from Farcastron a few weeks ago, and one of the things he said was, if you're building a consumer app, you have to do mobile. There's no getting around it. And Farcaster had a pretty big moment. I think it's kind of slowed down a bit, but they still have retained a good amount, which then brought up the conversation of, okay, what exactly is a user in crypto?
00:20:54.314 - 00:20:54.718, Speaker A: Right.
00:20:54.804 - 00:21:28.150, Speaker C: Like, Farcaster had these users, now they have slightly less. But then if people actually look at Drip's metrics, drip actually has quite a few, I think something like 100k dau. And then I'll let you talk about the numbers. And so I tweet about this, and then I was met with quite a bit of skepticism, let's say you and me both. Yeah. So first, I want you to maybe explain to people how you think about Daus and Maus. How do you measure it? What mechanisms do you use, and what are the known limitations?
00:21:29.630 - 00:22:14.662, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a really complex question, because, first of all, every app measures these things differently. Every chain measures activity differently. I don't think we really will ever have a shared language for talking about these mean, even if you look at social media in the traditional sense, and how they think about, like, there's a wide range of definitions that public companies will use to talk about these things. Right. If you remember, when Twitter was acquired, there was a whole thing around whether, I think there was, like, 95% of Twitter's actively reported monthly actives were not actually real. There were bots and all that kind of stuff. Right.
00:22:14.662 - 00:22:58.520, Speaker A: So the same question that we're getting about that is the same question that lives in web two. It's the same question that everyone should be asking about any app in web3. In my opinion, at the end of the day, the reason we care about measuring Daus is not because of some marketing thing. It's because we're trying to measure the health of the company and how we're progressing. And I posted this 30 minutes video where you can see that ultimately, Daus are the kind of, like, one thing that dictates all the other activity in our app. So Dus are growing, revenue is growing, and other things in drip are growing. If those things get out of sync, then maybe Dau is not the right way to think about it.
00:22:58.520 - 00:24:17.994, Speaker A: And drip makes this very difficult for people, and it's difficult to stomach because there's a lot of complexity around how the app actually works. And also, we've been through a more than year long fight against fraud, against bots, against people using multiple wallets to try to game the system. So at various times in our history, we are fighting back, but sometimes you're fighting back in our rears. So things that show up at one point may not be true in the future once we've done more work, right? And that's true for today too, right? When I look at our daus, I can reasonably be confident that we've gotten to a good place today, but there's no reason why in two years maybe we'll look back and like, hey, wasn't 100K, it was 60K, right? I think when you're dealing with wallets, which are de facto anonymous, you have to have a healthy measure of skepticism. Now, there's a couple of levels here. So first of all, all the public data about Drip is completely misleading. Because first of all, if you are a traditional analytics product looking at the Solana chain, Drip's daus don't exist.
00:24:17.994 - 00:25:15.598, Speaker A: Because the way that compressed nfts work is that all the activity ends up in a single account. It doesn't get distributed across all the different wallets of users. Like when you look at your phantom activity log and you see a compressed NFT getting minted to you, or you look at like, I don't even know if soul scan supports compressed NFTs. If you look at x ray by helios and you see the log of compressed NFTs, what's actually happening is a simulation. You're simulating in some like by looking through these merkel trees and finding activity and then aggregating into your mean. It's not that dissimilar from how regular nfts work as well, but mints don't hit the account level. So people have said to me that, oh, well, you look at the how come your daus are higher than Solana Dus? Well, that's probably going to be true forever, because compressed NFTs, if you don't understand what's in these merkel trees, none of those activities hit the chain.
00:25:15.598 - 00:25:51.446, Speaker A: So they don't hit the chain in the way that these analytics sites measure them. Second of all, so the first thing is analytics. Non chain analytics are pre broken. Second of like, in order to qualify for an airdropped NFT from drip, you need to be a subscribed and b you need to have droplets on your account. And droplets can be earned by logging in. That doesn't mean that someone has logged in recently. Because if you come to drip and you buy 100 droplets and you sit on a single subscription on a creator, and they drop once a week, that means, like, in two years, you're still going to get a drop from that creator.
00:25:51.446 - 00:26:26.902, Speaker A: It doesn't mean that you logged in. So when you look at the on chain data, if you just look at top ledger, where drip maintains kind of like some public data, and by the way, even that set of data, we have to work with top ledger to tell them, these are the collections that we have. So measure these. That's not something that you can just grab from the chain. You have to know kind of what you're looking for. So in that case, our weekly receiving wallets is like a massive number. It's like 500 to 600,000 every single week are receiving on chain assets from us.
00:26:26.902 - 00:27:17.094, Speaker A: But what you're looking at is a slice of users for 15 months that have qualified, but maybe are not showing up to the app, or maybe haven't been seen for a long time. Right? That's just kind of how we kind of built the app. We don't do that because we're trying to make ourselves look like we're a 600K weekly active user thing. It's just if you earn droplets or you bought them, the promise we make to you is that we're going to redeem those for collectibles and keep sending to you. So can't look at the onchain data. So what can you look at? Well, the first thing you could look at is people who are siding into the app. I would say majority people out there probably would think of that as a daU, and we certainly did, too.
00:27:17.094 - 00:27:58.870, Speaker A: But by the way, wallet sign ins are not on chain. This is not a well understood thing. That's just the wallet talking to the website, completely offline, by the way, and just verifying that, hey, this is the person, this is the wallet that we see that you should show data for. Right? So, for a long time, we did measure just people verifying their pub keys. The thing is, blockchains are full of bots. They're full of people trying to simulate activity in lots of different ways. And so last year, we had some days where there were like 200, 300,000 wallet signs on drip.
00:27:58.870 - 00:28:34.914, Speaker A: Now, you can sign in, you can do a pub key verification on drip without having an account, because you can sign in. And if you don't have an account with us, it will sit back like, hey, you need an invite code to be able to join. So even if we just publish sign in data, that number is much higher. There are, like thousands of people every single day who try to log into the site with a wallet that does not have a valid account. So we discard all of that, too. Right then. Okay, well, we've said, okay, it's not people signing in.
00:28:34.914 - 00:28:59.462, Speaker A: It's not on chain stuff. It's people that sign in that have an invite code on a daily basis. But from there, we even put more qualifies in, because these days, not so much, but back in the day, we had people who are fully automating drip. They were signing in with a wallet. They were, like, clicking on navigation items. They were playing our daily game. They were doing all kinds of things, like from a script.
00:28:59.462 - 00:29:42.610, Speaker A: Right now, us learning how to detect that and how to stop it is something that we spend hundreds of engineering hours on, maybe thousands of engineering hours on. That is something every app in crypto is having happen to them. The question is whether you care about that. And in our case, we do, because those are people that are stealing from other users. Basically, we consider that financial fraud. So I don't want to go into full details, but there's a lot of effort to try to understand this. I've talked to experts from all over the world in this problem, not just from crypto.
00:29:42.610 - 00:30:40.294, Speaker A: We've talked to the Gitcoin people who do this pretty well. But even a couple weeks ago, we talked to the head of trust and security for Discord, walked him through our entire stack for detecting bots and detecting fraud, and he was like, yeah, you guys basically do this state of the art way. The state of the art is that you're looking at data, you're building heuristics of how users kind of behave on your site, and you are looking for anomalies, you're looking for things that like. Because no matter what, the perfect bot doesn't look like a human. Exactly. Figuring out how they don't look like a human, it takes a lot of EFf for a lot of manual review, right? So we literally, every single day, we go through numbers, all kinds of charts, and just look. Is there something happening that doesn't out of band with other things? And without question, whenever there's inhuman behavior, it does show up.
00:30:40.294 - 00:31:30.934, Speaker A: You write a fraud rule, you ban those users, and you make sure that anyone that does that, again, gets banned in the future. Nowadays, what the best companies in the world do, which we also do, you take all that heuristic data all the fraud rules, and you train a model and you say, here's all the users that got banned over time, and here's all the users that you didn't ban over time. And you score every single person, and now you can kind of separate. Okay, and it's not a linear thing, right? It's like, these are users that are kind of behaving more like bots, and these are users that are behaving more like humans. And these are two separate things. And you can start to get kind of truth on, like, okay, what do you consider a real person logging and using the service as intended, who is economic and productive and all that kind of stuff? And we've kind of done that all. So when I think about a dau now, I have two buckets.
00:31:30.934 - 00:32:05.954, Speaker A: I have a bucket, which is the total number of people who came to the site, signed in, have page views, have all these front end characteristics. That's one number, that's a larger number. And then there's another model, which is, okay, let's take that same data set, and let's run every single dau through an ML model. Let's score them. And then let's set a threshold and say, anyone that's above a certain spam score, let's exclude them because they're not economic for us. And let's take everyone that's under that. That doesn't mean that those people aren't real.
00:32:05.954 - 00:33:13.798, Speaker A: Sometimes there's people just doing weird things. Like when you have this many users, you're going to see edge cases all over the place, right? You're going to have people that are doing all kinds of crazy things with your app. When I sent that data to Mert that he published on the Internet, I think I tried to explain that in both contexts. In both the model where we redact out people or things that we don't consider to be human or productive, and we look at the raw data, both of those things were showing us as having crossed the 100K threshold. Now, the Delta today, just to give you a sense what that is like, yesterday, I just looked for the show, there were around 137, 140,000 daus on the app. When I look at our bot model, we say there was like between 110 and 115,000 this weekend per day of people that passed that threshold. I currently believe, and I say currently because in the future it may change our mind with new things, that we discover that even that 140 is probably mostly humans.
00:33:13.798 - 00:33:43.300, Speaker A: It's very difficult to build a bot that runs drip today. You can try it yourself, you can see how we've engineered this thing. The engineering we've done, even to try to run a basic thing on drip is almost impossible. The level of engineering credibility you have to have to pass a single request through our front end is crazy. You have to pass Cloudfront. You have to understand how sockets work. There's all kinds of things that go into that.
00:33:43.300 - 00:34:17.306, Speaker A: Plus you have to deal with our rate limits. You have to deal with that are on IP, that are on user agent, that are on all these things. These are not simple things to talk about with the public. So when I say dau, there's like a whole pyramid of tech and engineering and research that kind of underlies all that. And if I ever feel like I'm worried about it, then just have to go check the revenue. Because the end of the day, I don't care how many you can say Du is boss or whatever. Ultimately, there's no boss.
00:34:17.306 - 00:34:39.734, Speaker A: Spending money on drip. And people, lots of people, every day, thousands of people are spending money on drip. And that's kind of where I underlie the comfort that, okay, there's a sizable user base. They're spending money. They're doing everything we want them to do. You can't really argue that they are not productive people. Right.
00:34:39.734 - 00:35:10.110, Speaker A: And not productive to what we're trying to. A long. Sorry, that was a really long explanation, but there's no simple answer for this. I can go on Twitter and post a single thing. Simple thing, right. And Mert was know, hey, you make these things too complicated for people, but you can't talk about engineering concepts and dumb it down when people are actively trying to undermine something that they don't understand. You know what I mean? You have to give them the reality, which is complicated.
00:35:10.110 - 00:35:15.922, Speaker A: Wow, that was like ten minutes. But, yeah, that was perfect.
00:35:15.976 - 00:35:17.570, Speaker B: That was much needed, honestly.
00:35:18.310 - 00:35:32.998, Speaker C: Yeah. While we have some momentum going into the spelling misconceptions about drip, let's say, I think maybe in the similar tweet that I posted, one kind of answer.
00:35:33.084 - 00:35:35.750, Speaker A: Was like, who are these users?
00:35:36.570 - 00:35:56.222, Speaker C: I use salana, I don't know, 100,000 people that use it. So therefore, where are they? So first, that is the first question I want to ask. And second is the revenue piece, right? Because when you first came out with this idea, people were like, oh, how's this guy going to make money?
00:35:56.356 - 00:35:57.102, Speaker A: Oh, good job.
00:35:57.156 - 00:36:04.834, Speaker C: You're giving people free NFTs. But then it's like, okay, now you do actually make money. So, curious if you can talk about how the revenue model works as well.
00:36:04.872 - 00:36:41.930, Speaker A: After. Yeah, I want to add an addendum, which is on the data side. We do a lot of data science to drive these numbers. You have to take this in context, because I don't think there are many other apps or companies that are kind of agreeing upon this kind of framework. Right. So when I post this data, it's also in the context of a lot of other crypto apps and companies who treat this completely differently. And you can go impress them and ask them the same questions, like, how do you come up with this? And you need to compare them on the merit of those things together.
00:36:41.930 - 00:36:49.406, Speaker A: All right. You asked me about money, but I can't remember the first thing you asked me because I was trying to think about this relevance here.
00:36:49.508 - 00:36:52.590, Speaker B: It was a question related to where the users are coming from.
00:36:52.740 - 00:37:19.906, Speaker A: Yeah, we have a huge slice of Salana. So, first of all, saying that you don't know who these people are. There's only a few thousand people that even that show up on crypto Twitter, you say, see the same people over and over again. I promise, come look at the drip DMs. Come look at the things that are happening privately. These are people that. They're not influencers.
00:37:19.906 - 00:37:53.330, Speaker A: They're not people trying to dump on your head. They're not people trying to shill an NFC or a token. Right? They're just using the chain, enjoying the content, vibing with our creators. They're not going to be the most visible participants in the ecosystem, which largely don't really understand or appreciate our model, and that's okay. Second of all, we're recruiting people every day by the hundreds or thousands from other chains. So we have people, both collectors and creators, coming from all kinds of l ones. They're being disenfranchised from Tezos, from Cardano, from Algorand.
00:37:53.330 - 00:38:28.574, Speaker A: We are winning. People from chains you've never heard of. Maybe Mert's heard of them, but they are coming to drip because the experience that they get on drip is just different, and they feel it. Right? Yesterday, I saw one of our creators again from another chain. I'm not going to call them out or even the chain, because it'll be too obvious who it is. But he was in a chat with other people from his community, talking about drip, and they were saying, hey, why aren't you putting work over here in this other marketplace on our chain? And he was just like, look, I love the chain. It's just like.
00:38:28.574 - 00:38:59.734, Speaker A: To be honest, though, on Solana, I'm sending out thousand NFTs and it's free. And I'm really enjoying that experience. Right? And he's sharing that. And these people are onboarding and they're coming to drip as their first step. So you're getting dot east in there, too. It is a mass audience, and it is not the 1% of people who are out there trying to influence you in some way or another. I think the NFT space in particular, this is a remarkable thing.
00:38:59.734 - 00:39:38.226, Speaker A: But I would say that half of our users don't even know how to trade the NFTs that they get from drip. That's how new they are to Solana and to the ecosystem. I wake up and I look at the DMs on the account and they're saying, hey, I don't know how to trade these. I know someone told me I can trade them. I don't even know where to go, let alone more complex question. The original person that you're talking about, Merge, who was saying, I don't know where they are, was the guy that runs an NFT lending marketplace. I have to tell you, the pool of people who want to lend or borrow with NFTs is like the top 1000 users of the blockchain.
00:39:38.226 - 00:40:13.360, Speaker A: And like NFTs, it's not the other 99.9% of people. So if you can't see them, that's because your product can't use these users yet. Right. But I do have good news for those builders, which is that you will start to see them and feel them pretty soon, because I'm watching them grow their understanding of Solana, grow their understanding of collectibles and appreciation for NFTs in general, and start looking for other types of things they can do. So I promise you what you're seeing, if you don't feel them today, just wait a year. They're going to be there.
00:40:13.360 - 00:40:23.540, Speaker A: They're getting as addicted to this stuff as all of us did maybe a couple of years ago. It just takes some time for them to care about these more advanced products.
00:40:24.790 - 00:40:45.734, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes sense. And I want to keep going on the user conversation. So I hate to ask a semi tangential question, but you just mentioned the creators are sending these compressed NFTs out for free to thousands of drip. Obviously, the cost to do to mint thousands of NFTs on Solana is quite low. But does drip kind of finance those transactions on behalf of the creators?
00:40:45.862 - 00:41:10.706, Speaker A: Yeah, let me answer that and also address the revenue point that Mert made before, kind of in one thing. So we are spending thousands of dollars a week minting nfts. But relative to the scale that we're putting out there, which is like four, five, 6 million NFTs a week. It's nothing, right, to be honest with you. Yeah. Drip funds everything that happens in the app. So for creators, it's totally free.
00:41:10.706 - 00:41:41.918, Speaker A: For users, it's free unless they want to support creators with donations and things like that. And our revenue model is kind of like threefold. It's very simple. If you look at the app, the smallest pool revenue for us is royalties. We have a one and a half percent royalty share on every single of the 120,000,000 collectibles that we've sent out. But it's tiny. And these are things that are feeding for, like, pennies, like we're picking up every day, like, I don't know, like 20,000, like one, 1000 of a penny royalties or something like that.
00:41:41.918 - 00:42:23.162, Speaker A: It's not even worth accounting for. Second growing product is sponsored collectible. So we have this format where you can claim a collectible on the top of a drip vault, and brands are paying 1015, $20,000 a week to kind of be featured there. It's like a fire hose putting your products on that stream. You're going to get in front of at least a couple of hundred thousand people in that week while you're there, and you are going to pick up users and sales and all kinds of other things from that, that we take 70% of the revenue and we give 30% back to creators. Most of the revenue today comes from selling droplets. So droplets are how you receive collectibles in drip and how you give back.
00:42:23.162 - 00:43:10.520, Speaker A: So in order to receive a collectible, every collectible you receive, you spend one droplet to receive it. So if you're subscribed to 100 creators on drip, and you send you one thing per week, you're spending 100 droplets per week. How do you get droplets? You can earn up to ten for free every 6 hours just by clicking a button. Or you can go and buy packs that are about one cent per droplet, and it scales from a dollar all the way up to $5,000 if you want. If you're a much bigger donor on that model, we give 70% of the revenue from that to creators, and we keep 30% of that as a margin. This stuff is adding up. I think we're all a little bit surprised by the immense energy that people have.
00:43:10.520 - 00:44:11.766, Speaker A: There's more than one droplet sale per minute, and there has been for, like, three months in a row. And this is awesome for creators, because they're eating and they're doing really well with us, but for us, too, it's changing our minds about the other kinds of things we can build. Once you start to see revenue showing up, you can start to model things like ARPU and other traditional metrics, and drip kind of functions more like a web two app in that respect, we're not trying to make $1,000 from one person. We'd be happy to make $1,000 from 10,000 people per month. This is why DAUs are so important to me, too, because we know that DAU is turning to revenue at this point. We know that people who fall in love with the product, they grow their spend over time. So our mission at the moment is just find new ways to grow and find high quality users and bring them in and get them started for free, and then let them kind of fire their way into becoming a higher quality retained user.
00:44:11.878 - 00:44:27.266, Speaker C: All right, so what I want to do now is I think we've cleared up a good amount of misconceptions about drip. I want to completely shift and focus on the Coliseum action. And the angle I want to take with this is Vib, you published a.
00:44:27.288 - 00:44:32.462, Speaker A: Post, actually, you were a VC before, or at least you invested in venture.
00:44:32.606 - 00:44:36.374, Speaker C: I forget the exact what you did, but you know how to raise money.
00:44:36.492 - 00:44:39.974, Speaker A: And more importantly, or maybe not more.
00:44:40.012 - 00:44:42.280, Speaker C: Importantly, but certainly quite importantly, you.
00:44:44.090 - 00:44:44.626, Speaker A: Published.
00:44:44.658 - 00:44:50.234, Speaker C: This tweet thread about how to raise money, how to pitch your company, how to write a pitch deck, how to present what you do.
00:44:50.272 - 00:44:50.762, Speaker A: Okay?
00:44:50.896 - 00:45:35.654, Speaker C: And actually, when I last raised money, and I've raised money three times now in venture, I actually used what you said, and it's actually quite useful. So now what's going to happen is people from Coliseum, which is the new salon hackathon accelerator, I get pitched all these ideas from them, and generally, the pitches are quite, let's say they need work, they're raw, and maybe we need to transform them into a bit more well polished stories. So can you just maybe, kind of go over that thread as much as you remember and just talk about some general tips or advice you would have for these folks looking to pitch their.
00:45:35.692 - 00:45:57.994, Speaker A: Companies and pitch decks? Wow. Thank you for previewing this question for me so I could prepare for it. You absolutely did not do that. All right. If you ask, like, ten entrepreneurs, you'll get ten different answers on this. You don't have to take my word for it, but I've raised nine figures of venture capital, and I think I'm pretty good at them. And I also like moonlight as a VC.
00:45:57.994 - 00:47:06.446, Speaker A: So I've seen a lot of hundreds and hundreds of pitches. I'd say the biggest mistake that most founders make is that they spend way too much energy talking about what their product is and not enough about what they're going to become when they're at scale. Like VCs don't invest for today. They could care less about the fucking purchase button analytics that you have or whatever. They want to understand how you're going to compete at scale with whatever incumbents or whatever problems that you're kind of solving. So when I think about building a deck, I'm kind of building it from the vision backwards, right? The implementation of drip in the seed round was very hard to believe in, to be honest, because the product experience was you sign up for a list and we send you free NFTs, right? It was like really boring. But the vision was that NFTs were a vessel for direct to consumer content that was kind of like a relationship between a creator and then user.
00:47:06.446 - 00:47:43.200, Speaker A: And so I actually published my seed deck for drip in response to some fud that in my deck I said we were selling user data, which we don't do. So you can see it on my Twitter profile somewhere if you want. But yeah, it starts from walking backwards from that. Hey, look, Helios isn't about RPCs, right? Helios is knowing that many amazing applications are going to be built on the blockchain and it's too hard to build those. And that's the vision, right? It's about building great applications, it's not about providing APIs. That's how you do it. It's not what you're really doing.
00:47:43.200 - 00:48:51.014, Speaker A: So I think that kind of philosophy, I apply every micro level in a deck when I think about describing revenue. When you're a really early stage company, you don't have good metrics. Your metrics are trash, to be honest with you. You don't have any customers, you don't have anyone using your service. So how do you start to build a conviction investor that we're actually going to do the thing that we're saying? And I think everything in a pitch comes down to that. How can I make you believe that I'm going to do the things I said I'm going to do? So there are lots of kind of tricks here, but to me, on the revenue side, as an example, it's about pipeline, right? I want to know, have you actually done the work of going out and talking to the best candidates and where are they in your pipeline? Sometimes like a single discussion doesn't feel like very important, but that's still a line item that you're putting your deck, you're showing a VC that I'm working backwards from the fact that we're going to have customers, and here's where we are in that plan. Okay, yeah, I'm in step one of a ten step plan, but this is what we're doing and this is where I am.
00:48:51.014 - 00:49:34.114, Speaker A: You can apply that for user growth as well. I think one of the things I talk about a lot about is like expectation setting. So there's a huge world of difference from saying to somebody that, hey, our plan was to go out and acquire 100 users for a product and instead 400 of them came. That's one statement. In that case, we have 400 users that came to the platform. It's another thing to say that, hey, we had a plan to get 500 users and we got 400. The facts are the same, but the framing is totally different and makes the person on their side feel very differently about how you're approaching this thing.
00:49:34.114 - 00:50:24.258, Speaker A: So I think setting expectations and constantly busting through those is not only a skill for pitching and for being a compelling storyteller, it's also a skill that you take all the way to the public markets. As a founder, that's what the best companies and founders in the world do. They're constantly setting expectations and then busting through them. So that's about understanding and setting up kind of narrative that you know is not going to get you all the way there. I think in crypto specifically, you have so many other fundraising tools that are available in web two, and you should not be afraid to explore them. I don't know, I've met probably you. There are some angel investors in our ecosystem who are worth nine figures plus, especially right now.
00:50:24.258 - 00:50:48.010, Speaker A: Or maybe they just made a huge bag with whiff or bonk or whatever. And these people are out there actively investing. They're writing like 50 checks. So I think diversifying your funding strategy is not all about getting VCs. There are plenty of rich people who are looking to put their money to work. So being resourceful about that, I think is pretty important. I don't know, there's a million other things that go into, but those are some of the things that came to mind.
00:50:48.160 - 00:50:55.502, Speaker C: And if you are listening, I also angel invest, so let me know if you have a good idea. I do, too.
00:50:55.556 - 00:51:01.790, Speaker A: Yeah. I gave you $2,500 and I think you gave us $2,500. So we're bonded in blood.
00:51:03.590 - 00:51:04.340, Speaker C: Yes.
00:51:05.190 - 00:51:05.554, Speaker A: Okay.
00:51:05.592 - 00:51:26.566, Speaker C: So the other part of this is, before you get to that point, let's say you have. I think one of the important parts is you can employ some tactics to present your idea and make a good pitch. But ultimately, your idea has to be something worth pitching. And most of the time, it's not. My first five startup ideas were just.
00:51:26.588 - 00:51:30.550, Speaker A: Awful, or they just didn't.
00:51:32.330 - 00:51:46.350, Speaker C: So one of the questions I get pretty much every day is, somebody wants to build something on Solana. They don't know what to build. They want an idea. They want help. And I always say, please just make like a mirror XYZ. Just support Solana so I can use it, because I'm selfish.
00:51:46.690 - 00:51:49.786, Speaker A: I'm curious, do you have any advice.
00:51:49.818 - 00:51:52.378, Speaker C: For these people who would like to generate startup ideas?
00:51:52.554 - 00:52:37.850, Speaker A: Yeah, you're not ready, because I think it's really hard to just sit down at your desk and generate a good idea. The things that win are the things you just get pulled into because you had a problem, or you're trying to solve something, or you're annoyed by something. I've never seen someone just like. It's like learning how to swim from a book. You got to be in it already, kind of feeling that really deeply. Otherwise, honestly, even if you get through those initial steps, if you don't have that deep meaning inside in some fashion, it's really hard to kind of know where to take things. So I would just say, if that's you, maybe just take a breather.
00:52:37.850 - 00:52:59.080, Speaker A: You don't have to participate in this hackathon, but the best thing you can do is go use a bunch of stuff on chain that excites you and then figure out what you don't like about it and then make it better. That's kind of where I would start. But don't try to start a company. Did you try to start Helios or helium or whatever you work on?
00:53:00.650 - 00:53:02.850, Speaker C: No, I did not. I was quite annoyed.
00:53:02.930 - 00:53:04.854, Speaker A: I was already building a lot of.
00:53:04.892 - 00:53:12.870, Speaker C: Random stuff on Solana myself, like bots and tools. And then I was like, wait a minute, this kind of sucks. And so we need better tools here.
00:53:13.020 - 00:53:27.838, Speaker A: That's why this podcast exists, too, right? Because you went out there looking for podcasts about salon. There was nothing good.
