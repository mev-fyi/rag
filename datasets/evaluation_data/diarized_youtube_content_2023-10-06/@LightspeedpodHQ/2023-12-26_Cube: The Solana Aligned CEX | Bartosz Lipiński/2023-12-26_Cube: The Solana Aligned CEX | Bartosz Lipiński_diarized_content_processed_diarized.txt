00:00:00.250 - 00:00:22.494, Speaker A: What would excite me, like, if I'm starting a new company and the framing for me with Solana would be this is the place where I can quickly test product market fit. I want probably a chain that has users that will try my product, like, quickly, and I can learn from them. And I think Solana has great advantages for that because it's cheap and it has users that want to try things.
00:00:22.532 - 00:00:47.578, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by Das London blockworks, number one institutional crypto conference, where all the top institutions and people in crypto are going to be this march in London, what's becoming maybe the crypto hub of the world. Have a link in the show notes where you can learn more and also discount code that will get you 20% off. So click the link, find out more, and I'll see you there. What's up, everyone? Welcome to another episode of Lightspeed. Today we're joined by Bartosh, who's the.
00:00:47.584 - 00:00:52.890, Speaker A: Founder of Cube B. Welcome to the episode. Thanks for having me. Super excited.
00:00:53.230 - 00:01:02.190, Speaker B: Yeah, pumped to have you on, mate. Before we get into Cube, I know you've been in Solana, I think since around Covid. So I'd love to talk about your origin story there and what you were working on before you started Cube.
00:01:02.630 - 00:01:46.720, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%. So Solana was, like, totally random, right? Before Solana, I worked primarily in traditional finance, like Citadel building trading systems. And I left right when Covid was starting, and the non compete kind of, like, forced me to stay at home. It was just as the DeFi summer was starting. So, funny enough, what really attracted me to Solana, one was like, I had some conference with Anatoli, but two, after I started researching it, SBF started tweeting a lot about it, and I was like, that's pretty interesting. The guy's pretty interesting. Looks like people are having fun.
00:01:46.720 - 00:01:56.206, Speaker A: So one can argue he's the reason for both me being in Solana and me starting Cube. Just, I don't know, kind of weird.
00:01:56.318 - 00:02:23.340, Speaker C: Yes, that is quite ironic, but, okay, so that's how you got into Solana. And then for people who are unfamiliar, obviously the Solana ogs will know this, but maybe people who are just entering Solana. What were you doing at Solana? What did you work on there? Did you maybe perhaps work on some NFT stuff? Maybe the first NFT standard ever? So can you just tell us that story?
00:02:23.710 - 00:02:57.560, Speaker A: Yeah, so I started with a bunch of products around finance before I moved into nfts, some amount of with wallets. When I started, there was nothing. And I mean, nothing. There was like maybe one article by this guy mcs, if I remember correctly. He was one of the testnet validators. And he was like two pages of how do you build on Solana? And there was like nothing else. And the thing that he built was pretty fun, but it was like a very simplistic Solana program.
00:02:57.560 - 00:04:20.618, Speaker A: So the idea was at the beginning to start building things that people can reuse. We kind of knew Solana is pretty hard to start with when you compare it to solidity. So I was responsible for basically hiring people in Solana labs and building things that other teams could lift and reuse, almost like very quickly deploy. And this is how NFT standard was somewhat born on Solana and then Metaplex. And I knew how NFTs worked on Ethereum, but I didn't like couple of things about how you deploy NFTs on Ethereum, and one of them was the interfaces are great in solidity, but they force you almost into this pattern for the simple contracts to always do copy and paste. You go to open zeppelin, which is great open source, but everyone just copies and pastes and deploys it. And if you have $1 there, suddenly thousands of nfts are affected and there's really no way to upgrade it, because everyone, again, in Ethereum or in solidity at least, it's pretty tricky to actually create upgradable contracts.
00:04:20.618 - 00:05:35.446, Speaker A: You need to have this factory patterns that swap things around. It's reasonable if you come from object oriented programming background, but if you are just trying to build a smart contract, and you are like, now I have this full set of contracts to upgrade one simple thing, you're like, so I wanted NFDs on Solana to be very simple, which is a couple of objectives were there, which is like, I don't want anyone to run like deploy smart contracts, build rust code. Ideally they have used Javascript CLI and can launch their NFT projects in under five minutes if they have the art like directly on chain. And I think we managed to achieve that. If you look at the growth of nfts on Solana, it was like parabolic. This was the success of Metaplex. And then after that I started working on the early versions with Jerry and Tanatoli of the compressed nfts, and that had a parabolic glove as well, which was again taking like, let's make the deployment easy, and then now let's make the cost super easy as well so everyone can use it.
00:05:35.446 - 00:05:40.298, Speaker A: And I think merit and Helios contributed to growth of compressed nfts tremendously it.
00:05:40.304 - 00:05:54.560, Speaker C: Wasn'T called Metaplex at the time. So the NFT stuff was a part of Solana Labs. And from what I hear, the story was basically you and Jordan did it in a weekend. Is that a true story? What was that?
00:05:56.610 - 00:06:25.480, Speaker A: Yeah, it's actually true. There was a couple of instances when that happened, and most of the times it was related to the fact that when we started building nfts, nobody wanted nfts on Solana. Like, nobody. Everyone was like, I don't know why you guys are pushing this stupid monkeys on our beautiful defi chain. It's, like, pristine. It's like Nasdaq. Nobody wants this.
00:06:25.480 - 00:06:50.640, Speaker A: And they're like, okay, to the level that you shouldn't work on this during your work, like, hours. And I'm like, fine, we'll just work on the weekends. And that's how the standard was somewhat created. And then the candy machine was similar story where me and Jordan said like, look, we are going on, like, five day vacation to build this thing, but don't worry about it.
00:06:53.250 - 00:07:11.874, Speaker B: Well, now Metaplex has spun out into its own thing, and anybody that doesn't know essentially 99% of the NFTs on Salana go through metaplex. How do you feel about that now? Because you said some of the trade offs with interfaces that you have, but there's also now this almost centralization around metaplex, and people are a little concerned about going forward. You have a lot of power, I guess, in one entity.
00:07:11.922 - 00:07:13.094, Speaker A: So how do you think about that.
00:07:13.132 - 00:07:14.870, Speaker B: Going forward with interfaces?
00:07:16.890 - 00:07:54.050, Speaker A: Yeah, so I would say it's a good problem to have. Now you have a debate, like something was built, people unified around a solution rather than have fragmentation. And you can always build interfaces on top of it or decentralize it. I don't know if maybe it could have been done differently. We could have make the contract immutable immediately, like a token program, and just say, this is what it is. But the engineer in me believes that immutable programs from the start are very risky.
00:07:56.410 - 00:08:05.480, Speaker C: Okay, so that's a fun. Okay, so you and Jordan do this on the weekends. You literally go on vacation for it.
00:08:05.930 - 00:08:06.582, Speaker A: What then?
00:08:06.636 - 00:08:08.140, Speaker C: What did you guys do next?
00:08:09.390 - 00:09:12.270, Speaker A: So a couple of things. From there, it took decent amount of effort to actually bootstrap the ecosystem. So this was literally like hand to hand combat, almost like every day where we would run, or Jordan would run, like weekly office hours with people like, hey, this is how you build on Solana nfts. Even though it was simple, it's like a bunch of Javascript you still needed to teach people. And there was like a DAA thing where that blew up and we needed to stay like 72 hours to migrate it from something that didn't work into something that worked. And there was like 30,000 angry people that wanted to mint nfds when we were coding and there was a bunch of. It was like this originally where if Solana, or if the website was breaking for the NFT project or if Solana had problems, everyone was like, oh, this is bullish mint because there's demand.
00:09:13.410 - 00:09:14.800, Speaker C: I remember those days.
00:09:17.570 - 00:09:22.960, Speaker A: Because almost every single time, if it was bullish, I was like, I was getting a phone call. What's happening there?
00:09:24.210 - 00:09:54.906, Speaker C: Yeah, no, the DJ and apes. So, like, DAA, for people who don't know, means djen Ape Academy. That was like the first mean, it wasn't the first mint, but it was the first mint that really took people by surprise, I would say. Like, even people at Coinbase when I was working there started switching their pfps to the apes and the price started going up a lot. And so that was like, probably the catalyst moment. So that's quite a historic moment. Okay, when was that?
00:09:54.928 - 00:09:55.526, Speaker B: Was that like June?
00:09:55.558 - 00:09:56.650, Speaker A: That was August 21.
00:09:56.720 - 00:09:58.860, Speaker C: I think that was 2021. August, yeah.
00:10:00.110 - 00:10:29.990, Speaker A: It was not when the mint was happening, I was like, okay, this is like fun project. I'm going to mint it at home. It was happening, I think, around like 07:00 p.m. Chicago time. So I already had a bottle of wine and I was like, ready to mint. I go to the website, I meant it's like, doesn't work. And maybe five minutes later I get a call like, you need to go and fix this.
00:10:29.990 - 00:10:58.474, Speaker A: I was like, it's like Friday afternoon or Friday evening after a bottle of wine, we go back to the office and 72 hours later, it's like, if you were there and you are waiting for that mint, most people are like, where is the mint happening? There's no clear communication. And I think we basically said, look, we are so tired after writing all of this. You are launching in like an hour. Either you are doing it or we are leaving.
00:10:58.602 - 00:11:37.500, Speaker C: For people who are unfamiliar with that period. After that, basically people just kept launching random NFT mints, like tens, hundreds per week, and you'd have to go to these websites and you have to just keep spamming mint. And then basically people would get intense and they would open up like 5000 browser tabs and just switch between them and just click mint on all of them. Because Aslan didn't have fee markets at the time. So the only way to get your transaction through was to spam. And then you would spam so much that the JPEGs would actually bring down the chain. That weekend, actually, from Jordan and Bartosh, literally led to, in a sense, local fee markets today.
00:11:37.500 - 00:11:55.060, Speaker C: In fact, I think people got so fed up with it. I think you guys also created this thing called Fair launch protocol, where you guys just made it completely random. And, yeah, those are some crazy days, man. What did you guys do after?
00:11:56.630 - 00:12:18.280, Speaker A: So, after that, I felt there was this moment on time where everyone was tired of COVID but there was no physical events happening. So we started this series of physical events called hacker houses, and then we went on, like, 25 of them around the world.
00:12:20.490 - 00:12:26.746, Speaker C: Can you tell the story of the first hacker house? Because I think that's, like, the one that first started it all and then you guys kept scaling it.
00:12:26.768 - 00:12:56.434, Speaker A: Yeah, the first two were kind of pretty strange. So first one was, we wanted. It was during breakpoint. So it was, I think, 2021 breakpoint in Portugal, and it was pretty straightforward. I was like, I actually don't like conferences. I was like, I don't want to talk with people. What I would want to have is just, like, a room with a monitor where I can pull up my laptop and just do the work.
00:12:56.434 - 00:13:44.740, Speaker A: And maybe if there is some other engineer, I can answer some questions about code, but I don't really want to go and listen to people talk on stages and club and whatnot. And I definitely don't want to network. So we basically ask a bunch of people in the community, hey, we are going to rent this venue that's totally not related to breakpoint. We didn't ask anyone about this, and we were like, we'll just rent it for a couple of. We'll put monitors in it, and we'll call it a hacker house. And if you are tired of the conference, you can go there and just hang out with us. And it was like, the first one was pretty big success.
00:13:44.740 - 00:14:24.722, Speaker A: A lot of engineers turned out, a lot of people actually didn't manage to buy tickets for breakpoint, like, actual conference, and they were like, I would just actually enjoy coding and maybe listening to the conference on the tv screen that we put up there and just chat with other engineers. So two days into the event, I get a phone call. Why are you doing this? You are taking away from the conference. There's no security. There's, like, nothing. This is just bad. I don't know.
00:14:24.722 - 00:15:01.550, Speaker A: People just like it. So we are here. This is not related to the conference. Don't worry about it. And then it turned out into this after the conference, I think people really liked it on Twitter in terms of social sense. So we sat down with rationality and started thinking, okay, what can we do next year? And we started with this crazy plan. Let's do 40 events in 2022 around the globe to activate Solana community in different locations in the same format, which is anti conference.
00:15:01.550 - 00:15:33.560, Speaker A: So a bit of longer format. You don't need to pay to come. Like, Solana will just promote projects and show people how to code, and the developers will have the stage where whatever they build before the hacker house or during the hacker house, they can go and say, this is what I'm building. You guys should try it. Because I believe if you can convince a couple of developers originally to try your product during an event like that, you might actually have a company in crypto. At least.
00:15:34.810 - 00:16:04.462, Speaker B: That is funny, talking about you not liking conferences. Someone asked you what you think about the metaverse, because you're working in nfts and you're like, do you really think I want to be in a room with a bunch of digital dudes? No chance. Quick break to tell you about an upcoming event. I promise you don't want to miss. It's blockwork's biggest and best institutional conference, called Das London. It's a two day event happening in London this March, where we're going to have over 700 institutions, 130 speakers, and a couple thousand of us all under one roof. Crypto is in a position for the first time to actually onboard these institutions, and they're showing up.
00:16:04.462 - 00:16:27.110, Speaker B: We have companies from Blackrock to visa launching real products in the space. We have the real world asset narrative taking off. We have things like payments that have been exponentially growing, and then we have things like deepen happening in the Salana ecosystem. There's a ton of capital right now in this institutional space is going to be coming on chain. It's going to completely change the industry. Whether you are an institution or you're a retail user, or you just want to learn more about what's going on in the space, this conference is for you. You're going to be able to meet some of the best and smartest people in the space.
00:16:27.110 - 00:16:43.038, Speaker B: The speaker lineup is absolutely incredible, and you'll get to hang out with me. But the best part is you actually get 20% off your ticket if you use Lightspeed 20 when checking out. That's light speed 20. I put a link in the show notes. I recommend buying this today because one you'll forget about it. Two, these ticket prices go up every single month. So, anyways, I hope to see you there.
00:16:43.038 - 00:17:02.770, Speaker B: Now let's get back to the show. So you've been around Salana for a long time. I know you talked about when you first joined. It was just in the top 200. It's not like it was a top 20 chain. Over all that time, dealing with these hackathons and talking to new developers, what is it that made you stay in the Solana ecosystem, and what is it that you've seen has attracted new developers?
00:17:04.550 - 00:17:49.300, Speaker A: I think strong foundations. I think, like Anatoly, Solana itself has a lot of different opinions on how things should be built, rather than aligning with something like, hey, whatever it is, right? Like, oh, we are aligned with proof of work by making these different decisions and showing like, hey, this is why we are doing it. And it's all about engineering. It allowed people that actually care about engineering to find their place and work together on pretty amazing things. I don't know, mert, what do you think? What attracted you?
00:17:50.310 - 00:18:16.630, Speaker C: Me? Well, so two things. First, I did signals and radio engineering in school, and Solana is basically built like a giant radio. So technically that interested me. But then I was also at Coinbase, and I was at Coinbase at a time where the information asymmetry, like, what people were saying about Solana, was very different from what I knew to be true from building on the chain.
00:18:16.790 - 00:18:17.162, Speaker A: Right?
00:18:17.216 - 00:18:57.366, Speaker C: So when the degenerate ape mints and stuff were happening, there was no analytics, there was no soul scan, there was no anything that had any stats. And so I would write my own data pipelines and analyze the stats for floor prices and stuff and then publish those. And then I was like, holy shit, it's so hard to build on this chain, but if you can, there's a lot of potential. And so I was, okay, if you just build a better developer tooling, then there's a lot of potential here. And then obviously, the community started. Kind of my favorite thing was when I first started building on it. Like, Chase and Armani would comment on my posts, and I'd be like, okay, that's pretty awesome.
00:18:57.366 - 00:19:14.700, Speaker C: And then everybody else would support you. So there's, like a community flywheel, and people had the fucking pit vipers that would just comment on all your stuff with pit vipers. So it was just good vibes, good culture, but also good tech and an asymmetric opportunity all combined into one.
00:19:15.070 - 00:19:33.630, Speaker B: What happened next? So you were going around with these hackathons, these hacker houses. I think that was 2022, which you mentioned. And I was at breakpoint this year. And the first thing you said on stage when you stepped on was like, if you asked me a year ago if I would be working on an exchange, which you are doing now, I would say no because I'm not stupid. So what happened between then and now that you're building cube?
00:19:34.530 - 00:20:40.970, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's pretty. Even though I worked previously in finance and spent years there, I felt like exchange space in crypto is extremely saturated. There's like 700 exchanges, and a lot of them are very well capitalized and they have massive teams like dismerge from Coinbase. But then FTX happened. And what I felt like is a lot of those exchanges, they are not necessarily blockchain aligned. They are like, hey, this is like a postgres database that publishes some transactions to some systems using some rpCs, and maybe they are doing some signing and they have a website. But other than that, frequently, a lot of those centralized exchanges, at least they don't really touch that much crypto, right.
00:20:40.970 - 00:21:15.918, Speaker A: You could probably remove most of the blockchains from them and they would look exactly the same from the user's perspective. You wouldn't even know that you are not trading crypto. And I even seen it. Some of them take that to that level where they are like, hey, this is like, what you are buying here is really like a synthetic asset. That's not even like this was very popular with Solana when Solana was very hard to integrate for exchanges. Some of them would add Solana as a token, but they would say, you cannot really deposit Solana or withdraw it because what you have here is a synthetic Solana.
00:21:16.094 - 00:21:26.920, Speaker B: Is that a result of the technology not existing at the. So, like, I know we'll get into NPC wallets, for example, or do you think these exchanges just are not crypto native at all? And it just was path dependent that way?
00:21:28.910 - 00:21:53.326, Speaker A: I think it's a mix of factors. A lot of them have been created in the very early days and they build amazing technology. But just like crypto progressed so fast over, let's call it even like last five years, that it's very hard to change large company to adopt this rapid set of changes.
00:21:53.428 - 00:22:25.882, Speaker C: That's exactly right. I saw that firsthand at Coinbase as well. You kind of go from being a startup and then I think Coinbase went public and they grew a lot. But then when you grow a lot, you start to, first of all, there's not that much crypto native talent and so you can't attract crypto native talent at the same speed of you shipping. And so it becomes very difficult. And so I'm actually quite bullish on decentralized exchange, centralized exchange, kind of hybrid startups coming out. So.
00:22:25.882 - 00:22:40.334, Speaker C: Okay, while we're on that topic, Bartosh, for people who are unfamiliar, let's assume they have a very basic retail knowledge. How would you describe Cube to them? Why should they use it? How is it different from everything else?
00:22:40.532 - 00:23:16.300, Speaker A: Yeah, just think, hey, this is like a better Coinbase, basically. Rather than thinking of it as a bank, it actually has proof of ownership that's visible on every single want to. You don't need to do it. But if you are interested, you can actually go to x ray from helios and see your balances in your account like Solana all the time on all the tokens that you have. We will never sweep the tokens to omnibus accounts and then publish something. Hey, like, you actually own this match. We just aggregated it.
00:23:16.300 - 00:23:24.700, Speaker A: You use the native chains if you want to check the balances, and we just show it on the website as well.
00:23:27.490 - 00:23:48.338, Speaker C: It's very crypto native. It's also very transparent because you can always see your stuff and that the company isn't doing weird stuff with it like FTX was, and looping it around FTT and doing some weird stuff with it in the Bahamas. Okay, so obviously transparency is a big one. And then I think you have some other interesting crypto native functionality like the MPC wallet.
00:23:48.354 - 00:23:48.534, Speaker A: Right.
00:23:48.572 - 00:23:52.454, Speaker C: Multiparty computation. Can you describe maybe some of the other features as well?
00:23:52.652 - 00:24:45.080, Speaker A: Yeah. So MPC for people that don't know what it is, and if you don't know, like Multisig, I'm not even going to there. When you show up at the exchange and you want to create an account, what we do is let's imagine you have like $1. We split it across multiple people, let's say like Mert here and Garrett, and you get pieces of that dollar. And then if you want to spend it, you need to ask those participants, like Mert and Garrett, like, hey, you need to have more than 50% of that dollar to spend it. For people that don't know in us, you can actually do that. So if you take a dollar and it's ripped, as long as you own the more than 51% of that dollar, that's like you get the full value.
00:24:46.730 - 00:25:03.342, Speaker B: What's the trade off with NPC wallets? I don't really understand it. So you have coinbase, they have their Coinbase web3 wallet and they call it an NPC wallet. But then you can also, if I lose my phone, et cetera, I can recover it. So who really has control there? What is the trade off?
00:25:03.476 - 00:25:54.320, Speaker A: Sure. So the main trade off is you give up full control, like, let's call it like full self custody in favor of this consensus that you have of participants in the network and now you have more people involved. So you need to trust them to some degree. Similar that you need to trust set of validators on a blockchain that they will not vote and do something like malicious. The system is also a bit more complex. Like MPC is a pretty advanced research and there is decent amount of code comparing it to like hey, I have the signing key on my ledger, but because of that we can build a bunch of protections around that as well.
00:25:56.290 - 00:26:17.910, Speaker C: Yeah, actually fun fact, I worked on the MPC wallet at Coinbase as well, so this is near to my. So, okay, obviously you can buy crypto and sell crypto with cube. So there's spot. Are you thinking of perps borrow land? Like how are you thinking about the product suite?
00:26:18.890 - 00:26:35.260, Speaker A: Yeah, so I would like to have perpetuals like margin facility and all of the things that you see from non us crypto exchanges to be available in Q one, Q two of next year.
00:26:37.470 - 00:26:53.006, Speaker B: Right now I think there's four tokens listed that you can trade with, one of those being bonk, which is relatively new that everyone in Salona knows about. But you added it very quickly. Why is it though that bonk, for example, got added very quickly, but you don't have a longer list of tokens? What is that process?
00:26:53.188 - 00:27:18.030, Speaker A: Sure. So we are actually adding more tokens like every day. So today we listed render and soon we have like helium coming and like a bunch of other ones. So we will be adding more tokens very quickly and all the salana tokens are very easy to add. Endless. Same with ERC 20. The way the process works is really like, we need market makers.
00:27:18.030 - 00:27:44.046, Speaker A: So this is like central limit order book. So it has some advantages, but it has definitely a disadvantage of listing everything in terms of long tail of assets because someone needs to actually put liquidity up there. And it's not just a project that lps into an like, I love amm, but they are great for, I think, long tail assets. Yeah, on that.
00:27:44.068 - 00:27:49.346, Speaker B: Is there any reason to integrate with something like Jupiter to actually have on chain dexes as part of your liquidity as.
00:27:49.528 - 00:28:21.322, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there's a place for that. The way probably it would be done is through some RFQ system. I'm somewhat worried about those because it leads to kind of like an illusion of liquidity on the exchange. If you start posting rfqs on the order book, you don't know if you will get filled. I think it's kind of misleading people. Yeah.
00:28:21.456 - 00:28:54.550, Speaker C: Okay. So you added more coins since bank. We got helium. Thanks for that, by the way. My company will thank you as the CEO of Helium render. Somebody I was talking to yesterday just confused Helios for helium. And one of the big critiques, I don't know if it's a big critique, but one critique of sexes versus Dexes is going to be the latency difference.
00:28:54.550 - 00:28:58.490, Speaker C: Right. What do you say to those people? How do you think about that?
00:28:58.640 - 00:29:01.210, Speaker A: Like, latency in terms of network latency?
00:29:02.350 - 00:29:08.938, Speaker C: Yes. And also spreads. And where Dexes are currently is probably not where sexes are currently.
00:29:09.024 - 00:29:09.418, Speaker A: Right.
00:29:09.504 - 00:29:19.600, Speaker C: There's still a long way to go there. And so you're kind of bridging the gap. And I hate saying that, but you're basically doing that. How are you thinking about that?
00:29:21.650 - 00:29:55.050, Speaker A: Yeah, we are building. It's actually very simple right now. The matching engine and the connectivity to Kube is faster than what you would see on finance, Coinbase and very close to CBE. We are talking about round trip tick to fill through. The switch is 200 microseconds.
00:29:55.550 - 00:30:03.930, Speaker C: Oh, wow. Okay, nice. That's that HFT background. Okay, Gary, are you going to ask something?
00:30:04.000 - 00:30:04.234, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:04.272 - 00:30:18.610, Speaker B: Can I add on that? So I think part of your settlement system has to do with a Solana client that you're using. You have a Solana s behind you. You've mentioned aligned a lot. Kind of making fun of the Ethereum community, but I feel like Cube is Solana aligned like you're talking at. Why?
00:30:18.680 - 00:30:49.530, Speaker A: Like, what is this connection here? I mean, it's pretty straightforward. We are making a long term bet on Solana validator client and people that are building, like Lucas from Jitta and people from fire dancer, that the validator client will keep improving. And we picked Solana validator client for our upchain where we publish all the gross trades before they are netted to bitcoin, Ethereum and actual Solana chain.
00:30:50.190 - 00:30:52.160, Speaker B: And what's the point of doing that?
00:30:53.410 - 00:31:43.130, Speaker A: So when you think of bitcoin, you will have a lot of trades happening that we need to record and prove that the order of them was recorded properly to the people that are validating the MPC vault transactions. So then you have this gap between. I traded at this 200 microseconds latency. How do I publish that to bitcoin with like ten minutes block times. So like, the upchain sits in between. And we picked Solana because right now it's the fastest chain out there that can handle the throughput and latency of us publishing consistently. The gross trades that are then netted to individual chains.
00:31:43.130 - 00:31:52.990, Speaker A: You wouldn't be able to pick a chain that's slower than Solana itself and then net it to Solana. That would defeat the purpose.
00:31:53.570 - 00:32:08.658, Speaker B: Yeah. At a high level is the cool feature that this allows to have this on chain and off chain system is that you can trade, you can have native assets across these blockchains. So it's no wrapped assets. But I can use something like USDC from Solana and buy Ethereum or bitcoin.
00:32:08.674 - 00:32:11.960, Speaker A: But it's native. Is that right? Yeah. Cool.
00:32:12.730 - 00:32:43.890, Speaker C: Okay, so I think that's pretty reasonable level of depth on the technical stuff. So I want to talk about the other stuff, the distribution, the go to market, the community, the advertising campaigns you've been doing. So how are you thinking about go to market? Right, because now you built this really good tech on the fastest chain. But then of course there's a lot of competition, there's a lot of noise. How are you thinking about go to market and actually acquiring users?
00:32:44.310 - 00:33:29.134, Speaker A: Yeah, no, that makes sense. I think one is built directly into the company. The MPC infrastructure that we offer with no fees is like competing with something like fireblocks, where you need to pay decent amount of money. And for people on the institutional side, that's like huge difference if you are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to keep something in the NPC vault. Same with Coinbase custody. That's pretty expensive. It's to the level of expensive that people would sometimes prefer to risk losing assets with self custody than pay.
00:33:29.134 - 00:33:51.190, Speaker A: That's where we are going, at least on one side of the market. The other one is obviously like listing tokens fast that people are interested mean on the spot. That's pretty straightforward game. And Coinbase is getting better at that. I think them listing like Jeter and bonk faster than binance was pretty impressive.
00:33:52.090 - 00:34:11.334, Speaker B: Yeah, you mentioned Coinbase custody there, which is really for institutional clients. So I'm curious who you're going after first because you have the NPC wallet that might require more support. Because that's probably one reason why people use Coinbase custody, is they have a full support team. But then also you're doing things, you're jumping on the points train, which we've seen taking over Salana, I see you just listed, I think a few days ago, it's like 6.9.
00:34:11.392 - 00:34:13.178, Speaker A: Is it billion like bonk that you're.
00:34:13.194 - 00:34:18.958, Speaker B: Giving out in points? So yeah, I'm curious. Those are two different audiences, kind of.
00:34:19.044 - 00:35:04.560, Speaker A: But remember, exchanges are a dual sided market, so you need both sides and people with diverse opinions on the time frame of their tokens to create a healthy market. It's kind of similar to nfts. You don't want large portion of speculators in your collection because kind of thing becomes very mercenary. So you need these people that are committed to the platform and maybe are long term selling or long term buying. You need some speculators and you need people in the middle as well that maybe are like DCA. And I think we'll have offerings for each one of those.
00:35:07.250 - 00:35:36.840, Speaker C: One thing I'm curious about is regulation. Right. I'm just trying to imagine myself in your shoes. And probably the thing that would annoy me the most, or be the hardest thing here is lawyers. I hate talking to lawyers and there's so many of them and you have to do so many different jurisdictions. What has that been like for you? What would you say is like the crypto landscape in terms of a regulatory for exchanges around the world, in your experience?
00:35:37.710 - 00:35:58.910, Speaker A: Yeah. So like prefix, not a lawyer, not an accountant, just like just some guy with the keyboard. So everything is like personal opinion. I think it can be challenging, right. But I would say this is not related just to crypto. I think the mindset that I have.
00:35:58.980 - 00:35:59.600, Speaker C: Is.
00:36:01.490 - 00:36:53.120, Speaker A: We are trying to start a financial institution around the globe and if you are doing it in traditional finance, it would be very hard too. The regulation for finance is just tricky around the globe and it often has conflicting interests. Right. Because countries want to control their currencies, some countries want to control flow of funds and then similar with advertising. So running a global business like that is just hard. And running a global startup like that is even harder because you have less capital. So you need to be very conscious, like how you spend money, like which countries you go after, analyze that pretty well and have strong go to market in the countries that you pick.
00:36:53.120 - 00:37:22.220, Speaker A: So it's expensive and hard. And in many cases, the regulation is not finished. The good example is like Mika in Europe, like European Union voted for Mika, but no country in Europe implemented that now. And each country will have slightly different implementation of a. It's a very idiosyncratic system and I think this is where the challenges are coming from.
00:37:22.670 - 00:37:27.162, Speaker B: Can I use cube as a us citizen being based in the US. No.
00:37:27.216 - 00:37:27.820, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:28.990 - 00:37:33.406, Speaker B: I have kind of a tangential question. Yeah, he can use it.
00:37:33.428 - 00:37:34.302, Speaker C: Wait, can I?
00:37:34.436 - 00:37:35.214, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:35.412 - 00:37:38.080, Speaker C: Oh, really? I feel like I tried.
00:37:38.690 - 00:37:39.760, Speaker A: Okay, maybe.
00:37:42.870 - 00:38:04.550, Speaker C: I'll ape after. Yeah. Anyways, Garrett, you're going to go on a tangent, right? But I do have some maybe related questions first. Go for it. So one thing that interested me is so I'm a big marketing fan. You guys have been doing some interesting advertising campaigns and marketing stuff. That's been pretty cool.
00:38:04.550 - 00:38:11.660, Speaker C: What's the thought process there? How do you think about marketing and getting the message about what Cube does to people?
00:38:12.350 - 00:39:02.170, Speaker A: Hire great people? Yeah, I think, I hope that I'm not that great of an engineer. You can think of me as like half X engineer, but I think, I hope what I'm pretty good at is hiring good people. So the team of engineers that we have is really good. And I think marketing team is really good. We have Dylan and his team. His handle on Twitter is Dylan Jpegs. He's like crypto native, but before that he actually run marketing businesses and has marketing background, but also worked in finance.
00:39:02.170 - 00:39:19.150, Speaker A: So he understands how to market that and is trying to bring really high quality advertising to the space. So I love what he's doing. Sometimes I have suggestions and he tells me to shut up and go back to the keyboard.
00:39:20.690 - 00:39:39.590, Speaker B: The NPC wallet in itself, obviously, and having self custody through that is a huge feature. But I am curious, just talking to friends, if I was trying to convince someone to use Cube, would the selling point maybe be that they list assets quicker than Coinbase would? Or would it be like, hey, you use Solana? This is basically a Solana centralized exchange. What would be the selling point there?
00:39:39.740 - 00:39:40.946, Speaker A: Solana aligned.
00:39:41.058 - 00:39:42.390, Speaker B: Solana lined?
00:39:44.890 - 00:40:25.060, Speaker A: No, I think it's a great question. And ultimately selling security is very hard. So I think convincing your friends, hey, try this, because this is safer, is almost like saying, you are going grocery sudden, hey, you should buy this carton of milk because it's not leaking and I just want a good tasting milk. The security is like a baseline. And when you are starting to use the product, nobody thinks about security in a sense. So you cannot sell it explicitly without trying to scare people. And this is where I don't want to be.
00:40:25.060 - 00:40:46.460, Speaker A: So we are just building the best exchange out there in terms of the interface, how you use it, how quickly you will list and how we aligned with either the networks like layer ones like Solana, or the individual projects where we'll integrate features very quickly.
00:40:48.910 - 00:40:56.442, Speaker C: One thing I'm interested in actually is currently you're on Solana and then you support Ethan bitcoin.
00:40:56.506 - 00:40:57.726, Speaker A: What else do you support?
00:40:57.908 - 00:41:14.340, Speaker C: Okay, so I'm curious, as these l two s come out and they have tokens and then maybe there's different l ones, what do you think is going to be your strategy for adding assets? Is it just going to be whatever is popular? Do you have an opinionated stance on that?
00:41:15.450 - 00:41:57.700, Speaker A: Yeah. No, it's a very good question. And it's probably one of the hardest problems for spot exchange, especially when you think about integrating new blockchains. I'm sure you know that from Coinbase, it's a lot of effort sometimes to add those blockchains and you need to make your bets, and sometimes you want to make those bets before the blockchain becomes popular. So in a lot of cases, I want to be excited about the technology and I want to know the team is actually building. That looks exciting from technology perspective. So just applying my engineering background to it.
00:41:57.700 - 00:42:35.630, Speaker A: So, for example, from the EVM side, I'm super excited about what Keoni and Monat team is building. And we already started talking with them about integrating them. Yeah, so are we. Another interesting one. I love what Sam is doing and would love to integrate them, but that one is one arewith, funny enough, is probably for us one of the hardest one to integrate. You probably don't know this, Mert, but arewith is probably like the only blockchain out there that's using RSA curve.
00:42:37.810 - 00:42:39.680, Speaker C: Okay, so that's going to be fun.
00:42:42.370 - 00:43:12.710, Speaker A: For people that don't know. Most of the blockchains use ECDSA and EdDSA variants, and blockchains don't use RSA because it's just using too much space. Like, the signatures are very long, and there's also some government associations with RSA and whatnot. So I didn't know that, even though I used rv for quite a while. And I was like, hey, can we add this to our MPC wallet? And I'm like, oh, shit, this is like a different curve.
00:43:12.870 - 00:43:25.280, Speaker B: I was like, on l two, is it easier for you to list a token that's on, say, optimism or arbitrum because it's EVM compatible versus something like ZK sync or Starkware? Does that make a big difference?
00:43:27.250 - 00:44:12.590, Speaker A: No, it doesn't. So it depends. Maybe the answer is it depends because the blockchain can say, hey, we are EVM compatible, or we are ethereum aligned, and the validator client might look nothing like the Ethereum client. And as an Exchange, you integrate similar to what Mert is doing with Helios and Solana. You need to understand how the actual client works in some sense. You don't care about how contracts work on that blockchain, at least on the high level you do once you start listing, like, ERc 20s. But to start with, you don't.
00:44:12.590 - 00:44:36.790, Speaker A: And optimism and base. They might be far away from Ethereum. It's like brand new integration. Each one is like, okay, we need to look into it and decide how much effort it is. Yeah. The EVM compatibility is really for smart contract developers, not for exchanges, unfortunately.
00:44:38.170 - 00:44:55.098, Speaker C: Okay, I want to talk about something else now. So what I want to talk about is you're building an exchange that's probably about as big as you can aim or as big a swing as you can take.
00:44:55.184 - 00:44:55.818, Speaker A: Okay.
00:44:55.984 - 00:44:57.450, Speaker C: Especially for a startup.
00:44:58.670 - 00:45:01.050, Speaker A: Sorry, what about lwan?
00:45:01.970 - 00:45:02.960, Speaker C: Oh, yeah.
00:45:05.090 - 00:45:07.374, Speaker A: Okay. Well, you know what?
00:45:07.492 - 00:45:44.460, Speaker C: I would say maybe due to the regulatory stuff, I think maybe exchange would be on par with that, especially with cosmos making it pretty easy to launch chains. Okay, so to do that, that requires an immense amount of intellect, resources, motivation, all these things. And so you're building a startup for it. How do you motivate your employees? What do you tell them? Or I guess maybe the better question is how do you approach building this company in terms of your philosophy in general?
00:45:45.470 - 00:46:21.080, Speaker A: Yeah. So focus on talent, which I prefer to have a smaller team of highly talented engineers and everyone around them. That's kind of obvious. But the other thing that we are doing is I'm collocating almost everyone on the team. So the team is not remote. We are like fully in Chicago every day in the office, sitting back to back with each other, like coding. I think this is like a big departure from what was happening during the COVID time.
00:46:21.080 - 00:47:01.220, Speaker A: So it makes, on some level, harder, hiring harder. But I want to make sure everyone on the team knows this will be a lot of work. This is like a startup. You will feel like you are drowning half of the time because there's so much work. And I want individuals that have a lot of grit and ownership. It's like different kind of people. I had a similar philosophy at Solana Labs when I was hiring people, and I almost frame it as, like.
00:47:04.630 - 00:47:04.994, Speaker C: Maybe.
00:47:05.032 - 00:47:26.810, Speaker A: You are not at the time in your career where you want to start a startup yet, but you should start thinking, like, in two, three years. Or maybe if Cube is successful, you will use it as a jump to start your own company, because you will see how you almost want to find people that are very close to being founders of their own startups.
00:47:28.910 - 00:47:33.920, Speaker C: Yes, those are quite hard to find. Any tips for finding those people?
00:47:36.610 - 00:48:01.400, Speaker A: Sell them on the fact that it will be hard and they will learn a lot. Be honest. It will be hard. I think the worst thing that you could do if you are hiring people is to not be fully transparent in terms of, look, this will suck. This is like going to the gym and deadlifting or doing cleans. You will not like it.
00:48:04.330 - 00:48:34.900, Speaker C: Okay, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I tweet about the same thing. I'm like, okay, if you want to feel more pain than ever, then just join helios. What do you wish? Okay, so let's say you build this, you played out your talent strategy, your asset listing strategy, the tech works, Solana validator client keeps improving with like fire dancer and jito and whatnot. What do you think is the ideal outcome in five years? Where do you want it to be?
00:48:35.910 - 00:48:41.074, Speaker A: We are competing with Nic and CME. Okay.
00:48:41.192 - 00:49:02.410, Speaker B: It's a big market, it's a big tam there. Not an easy one, though. I'm curious, when you talk about you want to work in person, right? Like you want to be back to back. A lot of crypto and a lot of corporations in general now are remote. I'm curious, why do you think that's so important? And this just makes me think of dows, right? Like decentralized organizations around the globe. No one's back to back.
00:49:02.480 - 00:49:04.374, Speaker A: Do you just think that almost can't.
00:49:04.422 - 00:49:06.970, Speaker B: Work when you're trying to build something that's like a startup?
00:49:08.430 - 00:50:12.400, Speaker A: I think for something like exchange is very tricky. I think some startups you can actually build in a remote way, but the system here, like Mert described, is very complex and we need to build it very quickly. And I don't want people to wait like five minutes for someone to reply on slack. If I need something and I need to know it, I'm not talking about myself as an engineer. I just want to turn around and just shout, how do I solve this? Right now, everyone knows everyone is capable on the team. They are like a players and they will only ask questions when they really need it, but they need the answer quickly. And shortening that cycles of communications and having also fewer employees and fewer connections is very important because you just focus on extremely optimizing the communication of the engineering team.
00:50:14.290 - 00:50:35.750, Speaker C: I'm going to be a little selfish here and ask a question I'm curious about. But I mean, we have a lot of founders who listen to this and potential founders who probably want to start their own companies one day. And so you've had quite a journey so far. Obviously, you're just beginning, but is there anything you can share with them about what you've learned? Any advice you would give to people who want to start their own companies in crypto?
00:50:37.950 - 00:51:18.340, Speaker A: Yes. Just build something. Don't wait for the right idea or the right time. Just start building. And once you have something, the next most important thing is convince a single person to use it, and they should be your co founders. Don't do it yourself like one person. Startups just rarely work, so figure out how to convince people to use your product, but have a product, like build it, even if it's the most simple thing.
00:51:19.670 - 00:51:37.260, Speaker C: Yeah, that's great advice. One of the most common things I get is people have an idea and they're like, hey, do you like my idea? And I'm like, just build the thing first. Show me that you can get traction, and then we can talk. Right, because ideas are cheap, execution is expensive. Okay, Garrett, do you have any final questions before I do some rap fire?
00:51:37.630 - 00:51:59.170, Speaker B: Yeah, I've got just one question. You're obviously a very curious and smart person, and you got into Solana a few years ago, and now you're still tangentially, or you are working in Solana to some degree. I'm just curious, though, if you're joining crypto today, what is it about Solana that would draw you into Solana right now? Or would something that's maybe new, like move and aptos or suite? Do you see that? Maybe catching your attention.
00:52:01.110 - 00:52:44.480, Speaker A: So I think Solana right now has an easier time to catch your attention. The price is going up, the people are excited. There is a lot of social attention on Twitter. What would excite me, like, if I'm starting a new company, and the framing for me with Solana would be this is the place where I can quickly test product market fit. If I want to build on those other chains, I want probably a chain that has users that will try my product quickly and I can learn from them. And I think Solana has great advantages for that because it's cheap and it has users that want to try things.
00:52:46.450 - 00:52:51.620, Speaker B: Well said. That's like a killer sales pitch. Martin, you got anything or you want to do rapid fire?
00:52:52.150 - 00:52:57.490, Speaker C: Yeah, I'll do rapid fire. All right, cool. Let's put Bartosh on the spot.
00:52:57.570 - 00:52:57.814, Speaker A: Okay.
00:52:57.852 - 00:52:59.080, Speaker C: Bartosh, you ready?
00:52:59.450 - 00:53:00.246, Speaker A: Sure.
00:53:00.428 - 00:53:04.870, Speaker C: Okay. Three favorite NFT collections.
00:53:06.410 - 00:53:11.580, Speaker A: I really like Azuki, degenerate apes, and Solana monkey business.
00:53:13.390 - 00:53:21.710, Speaker C: Okay. Three favorite ecosystems other than Solana, I really like bitcoin.
00:53:23.090 - 00:53:27.230, Speaker A: And I really like some things that are coming from Sui.
00:53:30.850 - 00:53:33.550, Speaker C: Your most unpopular opinion in crypto.
00:53:35.410 - 00:53:37.010, Speaker A: Solid sachs.
00:53:40.550 - 00:53:44.530, Speaker C: What is something you changed your mind on in the past two years in crypto?
00:53:49.130 - 00:53:54.360, Speaker A: That one of ones in NFT space will be huge.
00:53:55.530 - 00:53:57.160, Speaker C: You don't think they will be huge?
00:53:58.350 - 00:54:02.890, Speaker A: I think they will be smaller than larger collections.
00:54:06.110 - 00:54:14.460, Speaker C: If you had to onboard a random person on the street to crypto, what would your sales be?
00:54:18.030 - 00:54:30.340, Speaker A: If they are from another country and they're in us, I would tell them send money to Turkey, Mexico, Poland. Using crypto, obviously.
00:54:31.830 - 00:54:34.690, Speaker C: What do you fear the most about cube.
00:54:39.690 - 00:54:41.110, Speaker A: Speed of execution?
00:54:44.890 - 00:54:52.010, Speaker C: What advice would you give to aspiring founders that want to start their own exchange?
00:54:53.470 - 00:54:54.620, Speaker A: Don't do it.
00:54:58.110 - 00:55:01.040, Speaker C: What is one mistake that all startups make?
00:55:04.210 - 00:55:05.920, Speaker A: Focus too much on the idea.
00:55:07.010 - 00:55:13.220, Speaker C: Oh, that's a good one. If you could have dinner with one person in history, who would it be?
00:55:14.230 - 00:55:33.110, Speaker A: Hall of history or right now, all of history? Let's say Churchill. Churchill. Okay.
00:55:33.180 - 00:55:36.120, Speaker C: I'm trying to make sure that I don't ask anything too crazy.
00:55:38.430 - 00:55:39.580, Speaker A: That's not fair.
00:55:41.790 - 00:55:43.660, Speaker C: What do you think about l two s?
00:55:45.230 - 00:55:46.330, Speaker A: They suck.
00:55:47.390 - 00:55:48.140, Speaker C: Okay.
00:55:50.510 - 00:55:51.626, Speaker A: Some people would say that you have.
00:55:51.648 - 00:55:58.126, Speaker B: Like an l two of Swan in a way. Same thing with Pif or an app chain. You're like an app chain. I shouldn't say an l two. Do you think we're going to see.
00:55:58.148 - 00:56:46.960, Speaker A: More of that with the SVM and with Swana? Yes, there is this natural. So this is a bit of longer answer, but I believe any successful project in crypto will try to start, have a wallet, start their own chain, and eventually start their own exchange in one shape or form. Exchanges right now is where there is the strongest product market fit in crypto. So projects naturally either start there or gravitate to that. So example of that is like uniswap starting a wallet or like Coinbase starting a wallet. You end up trying to vertically integrate everything. And because there's no regulation, all the startups will try to do it.
00:56:48.370 - 00:56:56.580, Speaker C: Yeah, it's actually kind of what Stefan did. Right. They had the app and then they had a lot of volume on orca, and then they're like, nope, we're just going to make our own thing. So that makes sense.
00:57:01.190 - 00:57:03.970, Speaker A: Sorry, when he'll use chain.
00:57:08.330 - 00:57:09.558, Speaker C: That's a good question.
00:57:09.724 - 00:57:11.880, Speaker A: I would also just add, you see that.
00:57:15.050 - 00:57:25.242, Speaker B: You're starting to see that expansion with NFTs as well. Like, if you're an exchange at this point, you're almost launching NFT. I mean, you have the mad lads and is it the X exchange? Forget the name. And then you have that.
00:57:25.376 - 00:58:03.750, Speaker A: My own opinion on that cube will not launch an NFT project. I think a lot of traders just don't like NFTs, depending on how you look at it. I like to compare the market to people that go to casino. I think a lot of NFT people are like, let's call it roulette people. Roulette is pretty straightforward to play in most cases where if you're like a hardcore trader, you like to play blackjack or crabs. I see.
00:58:03.900 - 00:58:14.570, Speaker C: So you're segmenting the market differently. Okay, two last questions. If you could do it over again, what would you do differently?
00:58:15.470 - 00:58:16.460, Speaker A: Do what?
00:58:16.910 - 00:58:20.570, Speaker C: Just the entire crypto journey. Would you do anything differently?
00:58:21.730 - 00:58:39.060, Speaker A: Sure. So I actually got into crypto in 2010. First I was mining bitcoin. And what I would do differently is not throw away my hard drive with bitcoin on it.
00:58:40.470 - 00:58:42.290, Speaker B: Oh, man, that one's painful.
00:58:43.110 - 00:58:55.400, Speaker C: Jesus. Okay, final question. If people listening to this should take one message away from this episode with you, what do you wish that message is?
00:58:57.130 - 00:58:59.800, Speaker A: Build what's only possible on Solana right now.
00:59:01.530 - 00:59:11.982, Speaker B: Opos partosh. Thank you so much for coming on, man. This was a lot of fun. You're not only extremely smart, but just really fun to talk to. So huge fan of Cube. Huge Shana, what you're doing. Thanks so much for coming on.
