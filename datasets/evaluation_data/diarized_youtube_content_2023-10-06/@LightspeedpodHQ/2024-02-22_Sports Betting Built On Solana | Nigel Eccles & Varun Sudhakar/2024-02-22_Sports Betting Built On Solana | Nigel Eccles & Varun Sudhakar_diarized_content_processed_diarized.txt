00:00:00.250 - 00:00:23.550, Speaker A: We come out as technologists, like we want to design a really good product that works for consumers. That happens to be Solana is the platform we're building on. The level of the sort of religious affiliation with a single blockchain is ridiculous because normies don't care and it focuses us as product developers has got to be choosing the best blockchain that delivers the consumer user experience.
00:00:23.700 - 00:01:01.402, Speaker B: All right, everyone, this episode is brought to you by Monad, an L1, bringing performance to the EVM with parallel execution and both a custom consensus engine and new database solution. You'll hear more about them later in the show. You all right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Lightspeed. We are joined today by Varun and Nigel, co founders of Betdex, a sports betting exchange built on Solana. The beta version of the product is live, so we have an exciting real product to talk about, which is always an extra bonus for the audience here. And so, guys, thanks a ton for joining. This is going to be a super intriguing conversation.
00:01:01.402 - 00:01:24.822, Speaker B: I think a good starting off point is maybe just the backstory of the protocol, like what led you to launching this and your team has, you have a very impressive team with a very interesting skill set and also their backgrounds as well that kind of give you an interesting skill set to maybe go and pursue this goal of building this on chain sports betting experience. So I'd love to talk a little bit about the team and your backstory as well.
00:01:24.876 - 00:02:06.062, Speaker C: We're a team of about 20 people, largely all ex consumer products and or sports betting. So Nigel, myself and our third co founder, Stewart, we had worked together at FanDuel. This was back when I was there from 2015 to 2018. So we've been working in sports betting for a long time, and it's an absolutely, I would say, massive industry. Our estimates are probably about over $2 trillion are traded per year in the industry, but it's rife with a lot of different problems. As a user, you can get charged really high fees, sometimes like 10%. Quite often you get discriminated against if you're a winning player.
00:02:06.062 - 00:02:36.558, Speaker C: So you're someone who, if you're just a smart, better, sometimes they'll just limit you off the platform, or the industry term is called stake limiting, or they'll hit you with really high taxes. And counterparty risk is a really big problem in sports betting. So quite often it can be quite difficult to withdraw your money from the platform or even in certain instances that the company you're betting with will just disappear with your money. So those are the problems that we were trying to fix. And so that's why we started BetDex about two and a half years ago now.
00:02:36.644 - 00:03:24.222, Speaker B: That's awesome. I love that you identified the large tam. I definitely agree with that. And even anecdotally, it feels like it's becoming more mainstream. I think a lot of the large players, the fan duels, the draftkings of the world, are partnering with the likes of barstool Sports, which is a large media organization, and kind of like, peripherating the idea of sports betting. It's definitely become larger. I want you to, if you can, just quickly, kind of expand on some of those problems, because when I think, like, high level, my first question is obviously like, okay, well, how does building a protocol on chain solve some of these problems? Is it like the decentralized aspect, the noncustodial aspect? Can you maybe dive into, how can you fix some of these, especially, like, the smart, better discrimination problem?
00:03:24.356 - 00:03:51.880, Speaker A: One of the things I think is interesting about sports betting, and I think it's worth exploring with regards how other markets work. So, for example, another market might be, say, the US equities market. US equities market. There's a single price for. If you want to buy Amazon, there's really a single price for it. And there's a single sort of clearing. Well, there's a number of clearing houses, but it all converges on a single price.
00:03:51.880 - 00:04:30.900, Speaker A: Sports betting is not like that. There's probably 10,000 different books, all of which quote their own prices. And so you have all these separate liquidity pools, and there's no single sort of clearinghouse for. And one of the things that when we build with Betax, and then the underlying protocol with Monaco is to try and fix that, because it's actually not good for either user or to some extent, the books that they can't actually tap into a single clearinghouse. And so what we're trying to build with. So BetDex is the brand, retail brand. Monaco is the protocol we're building.
00:04:30.900 - 00:05:32.614, Speaker A: One way to think about Monaco is it's a language, a protocol that books can talk to each other and can share liquidity. And so in a way, it becomes kind of like digital plumbing that allows these 10,000 different books to say, look, I've got a bet for $5,000 on Man United at this price, and I want to offset it with someone else. The problem is, this is somewhere where uniquely crypto can help. Because if you were to try and do that without crypto, you would have to build a sort of a central entity that then every one of these operators would have to trust. And that becomes really difficult. So, like, okay, who do we. All of these different entities that are all competitors, we'd then have to find a way to kind of pull, and then they'd have to trust that that central entity then wouldn't jam up prices, wouldn't take sort of monopoly rents off these once it became dependent on it.
00:05:32.614 - 00:05:46.230, Speaker A: And so that's why when we looked at this problem, we're like, wow, this is somewhere where it actually needs crypto in order to solve it. And so that's why we basically started and said, okay, this is the opportunity to build us with crypto.
00:05:46.390 - 00:06:18.786, Speaker C: Yeah. And I think following up on that, the protocol, just to be clear, that's fully open sourced and permissionless. So anyone can access the protocol, anyone can build their own applications on top of it. Anyone can kind of put liquidity onto it, and anyone can plug into, be a taker and make trades onto it. Right. So to your question, Dan, earlier around, how does this help this problem around winners being discriminated? If we were to discriminate against winners on the front end, it wouldn't really make sense because they can just plug in directly into the protocol. Right.
00:06:18.786 - 00:06:20.870, Speaker C: There's no incentive for us to really do that.
00:06:20.940 - 00:06:36.810, Speaker B: I actually think this is a good segue into talking a bit more on the technical side about your protocol structure. So you're obviously built on Solana, but you're plugging into the Monaco protocol. Talk to us a bit about what the Monaco protocol is and the role that plays for BetDex.
00:06:37.390 - 00:07:10.110, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So the Monaco protocol was originally the original BetDex backend. And so that's what we fully open sourced and made permissionless. So it's basically an on chain limit order book for sports betting, as well as a matching algorithm. So that's what it is. And so it's a protocol which sits on Solana, which anyone can access and anyone can provide liquidity to. I would say so, as well as it helps make the whole ecosystem much more transparent and trustworthy as well when the whole backend is fully open source as well.
00:07:10.110 - 00:07:21.850, Speaker C: And so anyone can take a look at it, anyone can see the code. No one needs to trust us that the wagers are getting remitted properly. Settlement is occurring as it should, et cetera. It's all just kind of there on chain.
00:07:23.310 - 00:07:49.060, Speaker B: Right. Makes a ton of. So, okay, so BetDex is a set of smart contracts that interact with this base protocol being Monaco protocol. Gotcha okay. And then, so if we zoom into maybe a specific game, like, what does that look like on the protocol level? Is that maybe starting in? Talk to us a bit about how that construction looks. I'm curious just how the user interacts, obviously through the front end. But what does that do on the protocol level?
00:07:49.430 - 00:08:23.978, Speaker C: So it's structured as a limit order book. Let's say that there's a market where, let's say the trading price is, we say in sports betting, evens or 2.0, and that's the market price. And so you go into the front end, you see that, okay, the market price is 2.0. You can do a few things. One, and let's say there's $100 of liquidity at 2.0, right? You can say, hey, someone as a market maker has put up that liquidity at 2.0.
00:08:23.978 - 00:08:55.798, Speaker C: You can go and say, hey, I want to take that liquidity. I could take $10 of it, $50 of it, $100 of it, right? And so you could be matched, and you would get matched at 2.0. And then let's say that you're the winner, the market settles. Then all that money would be remitted to you of any fees. But because it's a limit order book, what you also can do is, let's say that you're like, you know what? 2.0 isn't a good price for me, but 2.2 is a great price for me, right? Even though the market price is 2.0.
00:08:55.798 - 00:09:14.362, Speaker C: So you could go and you could place an order and say, you know what, I'm only willing to take this bet, but at a price of 2.2. And that order will sit on the order book as an unmatched order till someone else comes and takes that order. And if they don't, that order will just get canceled when the match is done, and the money will get remitted back to you.
00:09:14.416 - 00:09:59.542, Speaker B: Okay, guys, quick break from the episode to talk to you about Monad the L1, optimizing the performance of the EVM. The team is working to materially advance the efficient frontier in the tradeoff between decentralization and scalability. The internal devnet is currently live and public. Testnet is coming soon, and testing on the internal devnet indicates that the chain can handle up to about 10,000 transactions per second, significantly increasing the throughput capabilities of the EVM. This, of course, opens doors for new applications and more interesting use cases, even those with greater complexity and higher usage, to run in a decentralized manner. Importantly, Manad is fully compatible with the EVM and the Ethereum RPC API, which provides EVM developers with a seamless portability for their applications. Given the popularity of the EVM today, this is really a no brainer.
00:09:59.542 - 00:10:24.100, Speaker B: To stay up to date with all of the latest developments, join the Menad community by following them on Twitter and jumping in the discord. They're a lively bunch, so hit the links in the description below. All right, let's get back to the episode. And just as like a limit order book for tokens per se, the market makers are going to have to play a very important role. So how do you guys think about onboarding market makers into this environment? And what's the current state of that? What does liquidity look like today?
00:10:24.550 - 00:10:58.160, Speaker C: Yes. So right now there's probably at any given moment between $500,000 to a million dollars of, we call it like anchor liquidity or like open liquidity on the book right now that anyone can come and anyone of liquidity that's available to be taken, if that makes sense. And so we've had a few market makers on board while we've been in beta. We should have probably about two more on board who are institutional market makers. I would say within the matter of the next few months. They've been working on the integration over the last about three months or so.
00:10:59.410 - 00:11:37.178, Speaker B: Awesome. And then so how does it look like from a shared liquidity perspective, in that if there was, let's say it was like a Chelsea arsenal match, and obviously that's one match that happens in the real world, and the outcome of that match would settle bets across many books, both on chain and off chain. How does that look to the Monaco protocol? Does every front end have its own pool for every match? Or are they like, if there was two front ends, say BetDex and frontend B, that was building on top of Monaco, would there be one Chelsea Arsenal match or two for each front end?
00:11:37.344 - 00:12:13.206, Speaker A: It depends on how the front end integrates with it. So there would be sort of a native integration front end where it basically just settles right, like it settled on Monaco and then it settled all the way to the user. That's how BetDex works today. It's non custodial. When the contract settles the money. BetDex actually itself, as a broker, never touches the money. But we are seeing, and we expect to see more brokers use Monaco, but don't, not necessarily settle natively on it.
00:12:13.206 - 00:12:43.840, Speaker A: So, for example, I might go and bet with this book, they will hold my money, they will then put the money on Monaco. Some books might also build in their own margin into it. And so they're just using, and they may only use Monaco for certain bets, like there might be $100, 200, $300 bets they can handle. It's whenever somebody comes in with $5,000, they then place that on Monaco. And so whenever the bet settled, it's settled to that book, and then they put it into a customer account.
00:12:47.430 - 00:13:35.982, Speaker C: Back to your original question. If there are that Chelsea Arsenal match, if there is already a market created with the market maker on it and there's a lot of liquidity on it, you as a front end, you would most likely want to plug into that market. If you do create, I mean, can you create a different market on the protocol? Sure. But then you're splitting liquidity, right, and you're giving a much worse product for your users. And so we actually already have, there is another front end outside of BetDex, which we've seen live on the protocol called pure bet. They actually just plug into the same markets that we plug into. At least I haven't seen them or any other operator this moment create duplicative markets of the same event just because of the disadvantages.
00:13:35.982 - 00:13:38.162, Speaker C: Once you start fragmenting liquidity too much.
00:13:38.216 - 00:14:00.006, Speaker B: It'S very interesting to hear that they're using the same markets. I think that's like a long term improvement of the current landscape from comparing on chain and off chain markets. And so if we zoomed in on continued this idea of looking at a single game, let's say the match ends, right, arsenal beat Chelsea. How is that communicated to the smart.
00:14:00.038 - 00:14:39.860, Speaker C: Contract, the settlement of each market within the Monaco ecosystem, there's what we call market operators, right. And so anyone can kind of become a market operator, the settlement of each market is going to be dependent upon the market operator. So for a lot of the markets which are running on the protocol, we as Vetdex are the ones who are settling those markets right now. We can do that and we can tell the protocol, hey, Chelsea won the match, and we can do that manually. Or the protocol has the ability to plug into a data feed or a third party. Right. And that could be decentralized Oracle, or it could be a paid data.
00:14:39.860 - 00:14:53.946, Speaker C: So that's how it's done. It's up to the market operator to determine how they want to settle that market. But the protocol is somewhat agnostic as to what the input is in order to settle that market.
00:14:54.048 - 00:15:07.946, Speaker B: So if you moved out into the future and imagine like pith, which is a large oracle provider, mostly based around the Solana ecosystem. If they had the outcome of that match as a feed, you could essentially plug that into the protocol.
00:15:08.058 - 00:15:10.046, Speaker C: Absolutely. Awesome.
00:15:10.148 - 00:15:34.422, Speaker B: I love that approach. And so I guess another question I have is, how do you think about the game ODs? Is it just purely market driven or where does the game start out when you just launch a game? Sorry, let's continue with the Chelsea Arsenal match. Right. If Chelsea was a heavy, heavy favorite in this, where would the game market open up at?
00:15:34.556 - 00:16:08.818, Speaker C: Yeah, given it's a limit order book, it'll depend upon what the market maker prices the market at. Unless you as an individual want to go and put up a price as well. Right. Anyone can do it because it's an exchange, but primarily it's driven by the market maker. The way they will do it is they will look at the prices all across the world, they'll look at other books, they'll look at the Asia market, but they'll also be applying their own kind of proprietary models and their own kind of view upon what the price should be, and they'll put up a price at which that they're comfortable at.
00:16:08.904 - 00:16:35.306, Speaker B: If you looked out into the future again, and who are your perfect market makers? Would it be like the large books that exist today in, say, like the Vegas books? Are those like your ideal market makers? Because they could come in supply liquidity into these markets and there are fees associated with this, so it could still be beneficial for them? Or do you think there's like an evolution of who the target market makers ends up being?
00:16:35.488 - 00:17:31.654, Speaker C: Yeah, most of our market makers are like institutions or gambling syndicates, so they're the ones who are market making on us. So they're like institutional trading firms, if you will, the books, I actually, I don't necessarily see them necessarily as being a market maker on Monaco. What I do potentially see down the road is that they could be using Monaco as potentially a facility to hedge their exposure. Right. So the way, like a sports book offering, they're like a one sided exchange, right? So they are taking the other side of the bet and they are taking on the risk and the exposure from the volume from their customers. So if you can imagine a book like, let's say, I don't know, like Ladbrooks or say, bet 365 or even like a Caesar, if they want to become competitive, let's use Caesar as example. They're in the US, they want to be competitive against Vangel and draftKings.
00:17:31.654 - 00:18:06.886, Speaker C: One way that they could potentially compete is based upon price. Right? Now, that's quite difficult for them to do if they don't have a really robust kind of risk and trading operation in house, because they'd be taking on a lot of risk onto their book. But all of a sudden, if they're able to do that and they're able to compete upon price, and let's say they have too much exposure that they don't want, but if there's a place like Monaco that they can go and hedge that exposure onto, all of a sudden that's one avenue that they could end up. That's one potential route that they could end up becoming a more competitive book in the US.
00:18:06.988 - 00:18:29.214, Speaker B: So prediction markets are becoming a much larger narrative throughout the industry, and you see large markets forming around the US presidential election, the candidacy there. And is it fair to say, like, BetDex is basically a prediction market for sports? Or is that, like, missing the analogy here?
00:18:29.412 - 00:19:29.262, Speaker A: The focus on prediction markets is a very US phenomena in sort of definition. So, for example, you look at the UK market. UK, you can take bets on, literally, like, there's been bets on next prime minister's been bets on the US elections, there's bets on news stories, like Patty Parr famously makes bets on the next pope, stuff like this. The thing that they've discovered, though, is that things outside of sports is just a smaller market, right? It's just not in the UK where they have the ability to have, as it were, a prediction market. So what we have built with Monaco, absolutely, you could run it on any sort of event. It's just that sports is probably 99% of the market. And I do think that prediction markets I've a lot of experience of, tend to get interesting every four years, which is a US election cycle.
00:19:29.326 - 00:19:29.698, Speaker C: Right?
00:19:29.784 - 00:20:22.594, Speaker A: And that's when everybody goes, oh, yeah, it's super interesting, prediction markets. But the other three years, most events are quite hard to even like, big news stories are quite hard to kind of get into a pure market. It's kind of like even simple things you think would be like, oh, that's a straight question. Is such and such going to happen by such and such? And actually, when you get down to it, often be very hard to get it precise enough to be like a result. I remember we had a case years ago, I ran a prediction market and we had a market on whether the New York governor Spitzer at the time, was going to resign. And he did buy axe, and he did resign, but he wasn't going to leave an office for another two weeks. And so how do you settle that market and so that's kind of one of the problems.
00:20:22.594 - 00:20:48.810, Speaker A: But the bigger one is that even, for example, if we go US presidential elections, that's a pretty big market. Our Betfair would do more in horse racing on any given day than they would in the US presidential election, and they would do that every day. So certainly a lot of more mainstream interests, but from a volume perspective, really, most of the volume is still on sports.
00:20:50.510 - 00:21:00.206, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes sense. And then even anecdotally, in my circles, you're right, the presidential election is an interesting conversation, but once every four years, whereas sports is.
00:21:00.308 - 00:21:02.080, Speaker A: There's sports every day.
00:21:02.530 - 00:21:03.294, Speaker B: Every day.
00:21:03.412 - 00:21:05.959, Speaker A: When you look at these markets, you can go and look at Betfair and.
00:21:05.959 - 00:21:06.738, Speaker C: You can go and look at the.
00:21:06.744 - 00:21:30.620, Speaker A: Amount being traded on the presidential election and then compare to the amount they're doing on cricket. It suddenly makes you realize that I think presidential election has got a much broader level of interest, but 99.9% of those people aren't really that interested in betting on it, whereas something like cricket is maybe more narrow. But the people who bet on and want to bet like hundreds of thousands of dollars.
00:21:32.270 - 00:21:54.318, Speaker B: Right. And to me, it honestly makes sense to go the sports route first because there's already a market there and it's a daily market and even sports books will have random things you can bet on. So would you guys ever considering maybe opening a market on the presidential election, or is the focus sports planning on.
00:21:54.324 - 00:22:05.010, Speaker A: A presidential election once we get closer to it? One thing that also the problem with presidential election is most betters don't want to lock up their money for like eight months.
00:22:05.080 - 00:22:05.554, Speaker C: Right.
00:22:05.672 - 00:22:26.300, Speaker A: So you don't want to make a bet today and then so with the people that, the users that we are working with, they want to trade rapidly and they want turnover, and so they're going to be more interested closer to election day than trying to put a bet down today and locking their money up for eight months.
00:22:27.630 - 00:22:55.860, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes total sense to me. And do you see any degree of arbitrage forming? Where is there a gap in odds on BetDex or the Monaco protocol as a whole that doesn't align with some off chain venue? You can kind of like arbitrage the two. Is that something you're seeing? I mean, obviously that's hard to identify, but I'm curious if that's, like any traders or users are doing this type of thing.
00:22:56.230 - 00:23:22.480, Speaker C: Yeah, we definitely have our fair share of kind of arbitrage betters. I would say that it's not new in the industry, though. Our betting has been around for ages. People do it across different books. All the know. If you look at the US market between different books in the US, it's been going around in Europe, going around in Asia all the time. So we do have our fair share of ARB traders for sure.
00:23:23.890 - 00:23:46.500, Speaker B: How is that viewed in the industry? Is that just something that sort of like how MeV gets viewed in the on chain finance and Defi or like, I'm just curious how the industry perceives the ARB traders. Are they like the gigabrain guys that are connecting a lot of dots? What's the story there?
00:23:47.190 - 00:24:24.094, Speaker C: So I think it depends who you're talking about in the industry. So a lot of the, I'll say like the books, which are more retail focused, like going after the customer who's betting ten leg parlays every day or something like that, they hate the ARB traders, right? They view them as smart betters. They will stake limit them, sometimes even ban them from the platform. The sharper books and exchanges, obviously they may still put in restrictions, et cetera as well, but they're generally more open to kind of like sharper betters. That's how I would see it.
00:24:24.132 - 00:24:52.918, Speaker B: And when you think back on this discrimination problem, if you're a sharper better, wouldn't that make a decentralized protocol the most interesting place to go bet? Because the market maker doesn't necessarily know that you're a sharp and you kind of have this edge that. But I guess the other side of that is, if I'm a market maker, does that make me less attracted to adding liquidity? Because I don't know that I have the counterparty of people putting in ten leg parlays.
00:24:53.094 - 00:25:50.446, Speaker C: Yeah, it's definitely something we've discussed with our own market makers. I think it'll kind of end up like if you have an ecosystem where it's just a market maker versus sharps, I think that it's going to be tough to succeed, call it in the long run. What's quite interesting about the blockchain, and if someone is a sharp bet and they're betting directly by the protocol, you can kind of still see their wallet, right? So if you as a market maker, let's say someone comes in, they put a big order and you identify that based off on that wallet's betting history, that they're a sharp better. You can move the price by one or two ticks, which may not affect the vast majority of betters, but may affect that sharp better. Right. The sharp better then sees themselves not getting filled. Maybe they go up with a different wallet, and then it's kind of like this chicken and egg problem, I would say, taking a step back.
00:25:50.446 - 00:26:47.950, Speaker C: Our vision is to have an ecosystem not just with market makers and sharp betters and syndicates, but also genuine kind of retail flow from kind of like softer individuals. Right. And so what Bettex acts as is a retail interface to bring in some of that more casual user base. And in the long run, what we would want to see is you have the Monaco protocol on one end. You have market makers who are usually trading firms and syndicates. You may have other sharp betters and syndicates taking against them as well, or market making, and they're usually plugging in directly into the protocol. And then you have all these skins which sit on top of BetDex, on top of Monaco, which act as user acquisition engines to bring in software flow into the whole ecosystem to ensure that you have all aspects of the ecosystem covered and are bringing in enough volume from everywhere.
00:26:49.330 - 00:27:14.086, Speaker B: Right on. That seems like a very logical approach. And then so to bring in that retail flow, that does play a very important role in this ecosystem, I guess I'm curious to get more on your strategy. So if I was thinking about it, if I was a better, I'd be interested in a large number of markets. So there's always something that I'm engaged in embedding on. So what sports and markets do you cover today, and what's your plan to scale this?
00:27:14.268 - 00:27:57.362, Speaker C: Yeah, so we are focusing on high liquidity markets initially, and then we're going to be start expanding out from there. When we launched a little bit over a year ago, we just had soccer pre match markets only for the World cup. So now we've expanded quite significantly. So within soccer itself, there's not only the tier one leagues, like Bundesliga, Premier League, et cetera, but we also have kind of like tier two and some even tier three leagues. So like La Liga two, Siri B, and stuff like that. Outside of soccer, we've expanded into NBA, into tennis, into NHL, even a little bit of esports, as well as NFL. As I mentioned, in terms of market type, we're focusing on the highest liquidity market.
00:27:57.362 - 00:28:18.266, Speaker C: So generally that's the full time result market or the match winner market. But then as demand builds, we'll start expanding. So even in soccer, in certain leagues now, you can bet on both teams to score or over under two and a half. We may start doing spreads in NBA as demand builds. So that's kind of the market offering that you see on the site right.
00:28:18.288 - 00:28:30.558, Speaker B: Now just to hammer home the liquidity today. I know you mentioned there's about a half million to a million in resting liquidity from these market makers. What's your most liquid market today, and what kind of volume are you seeing on that?
00:28:30.724 - 00:29:07.926, Speaker C: Yep. So I would say soccer and NBA are probably the most liquid. Baseball and hockey should become equally as liquid in about matter of two or three weeks because the few market makers are finishing integrations there. Oh, and tennis? Tennis is actually probably our most liquid market. So tennis is something we, I mean, it's a great market for us to have from a marketing perspective, just because this match is literally going on every single day. And so you can always have live inventory on there. So those are the most popular sports.
00:29:07.926 - 00:29:34.322, Speaker C: I would say. In terms of matched volume, we'd probably do between $500,000 to a million dollars a month. In terms of match volume, compared when we launched, I think our first month was $30,000 a month. So we've grown quite a bit. But where we want to be going is we want to be doing, call it 20 to 20 million plus more per month. So, gone off to a good start, but we still have a long road ahead there.
00:29:34.376 - 00:29:49.250, Speaker B: What you're doing is building a business on a blockchain. And so I want to kind of jam on your approach, I guess, on the business side. So I know we briefly mentioned that there's some fees related to Monaco protocol, but how does BetDex itself generate revenue?
00:29:49.410 - 00:30:01.882, Speaker C: Yeah. So the way the ecosystem operates is. So there's a fee at the protocol layer. And so that fee. Let's start there. So that's at the Monaco protocol layer. And so that will be applicable to anyone who interacts with the protocol.
00:30:01.882 - 00:30:30.850, Speaker C: Right. And so that fee is 1% of net winnings. And so in a given market. So let's say you plug in directly to protocol, you make five trades in a given market, but few of those trades offset each other. And in the end, for that market, you're left with $100 of profit, net profit. You only pay on that profit. And then each operator, or skin which builds on top of Monaco, is able to charge their own fee.
00:30:30.850 - 00:31:01.840, Speaker C: And that fee, 100% of that fee, goes back to that operator. So BetDEx currently charges a 2% fee on top. In effect, if you are a user who places a trade via BetDex, you end up paying only 3% of net winnings per market. Right. And that's fee split. 1% goes to the protocol, the other 2% goes directly to BetDex. Now, other skins which build on top, they can charge whatever operator fee that they want.
00:31:01.840 - 00:31:05.060, Speaker C: We don't control that. It's totally up to them.
00:31:06.070 - 00:31:28.440, Speaker B: Okay, so when I'm thinking about competitive advantage here. So if you're 3% all in for the user, the user probably doesn't care where the two and the one goes, right? They just care that they're paying the three. How does that compare to if I just walked into a Vegas sports book and placed a bet, am I paying more fees? Am I paying less fees? What's generally the difference there?
00:31:28.890 - 00:32:09.246, Speaker C: So usually, like a sports book, like a general vig on a sports book, they're charging between 7% or so on, like straight bets. And then parlays can get up to 40, 50% is the vig that they would charge. Right. So it's definitely competitive versus them versus other exchanges. Exchanges charge anywhere between 2% of net winnings. We're sitting right in there, and we are competitive with other sport betting exchanges. The key difference between what I would say what we do versus other books or other exchanges is books and kind of more incumbent web, two books and sport betting exchanges.
00:32:09.246 - 00:32:44.158, Speaker C: What they'll do on the book side is quite often they will stake limit you. I think, as we had spoken for, if you're like an arbiter or a sharp better, or just kick you off the platform. And on exchanges, what they do is they institute a premium charge so your tax can go from 2% to all of a sudden, I think Betfair the highest is probably like 50 or 60% of winnings. So we don't do that. And so that is what I would say is kind of the key differentiator there. On the pricing side, it's just a flat as a betex user, 3% of net winnings. As a protocol user, flat 1% of net winnings.
00:32:44.254 - 00:33:07.606, Speaker B: It's nice to see that they're competitive on the better side of competitive. Right. You're providing an improved experience for the user. And on the user note, how do you think about user acquisition? What is it that gets users to come try the platform? And really, why is it a better experience for them to go to BetDex rather than any of the other venues that are available to them?
00:33:07.788 - 00:33:49.846, Speaker C: Yeah. So outside of the fees, we want to be competitive on ODs, and we want to ensure that a user can come and get their bet on. That's what we pride ourselves on and what we're striving towards. And so the ODs that you will see on our site, even if you include our fees, are quite competitive with some of the ODs that you'll find in the best venues around the world. Now, it doesn't mean we have the best ODs all the time yet, but as liquidity builds, we will have. The hope is to have the place with the best ODs and kind of the deepest liquidity. And even now, if you go and you compare ODs, I would say over 50% of our odds are probably as good as, if not better than, what you might find.
00:33:49.846 - 00:34:46.982, Speaker C: Like a sharp book, let's say like a pinnacle or something like that. The other reason, and one of the biggest value props that we've seen from some of the traders who have integrated directly onto the protocol, is they really like the fact that the protocol doesn't actually like custody funds. And it's always transparent and under control in the sense that once the match is permitted, that money will go back directly into that user's wallet. So some of our traders have trading directly via the Monaco protocol. There are individuals who've had experience with trading on another book which might be offshore or somewhere where all of a sudden, that book, they have $100,000 of winnings. The book is like, oh, you know what? We can't pay you out. Or in other cases, actually, we had one user say this, the book just disappeared, right? And they just had zero recourse to get their money.
00:34:46.982 - 00:34:57.894, Speaker C: And with an on chain protocol, that just doesn't occur. And so that has been one of the other biggest value props, especially for individuals who are really more like kind of programmatic traders.
00:34:58.022 - 00:35:22.530, Speaker B: Walk us through the onboarding flow. If I'm a user who wants to come place a bet on this arsenal Chelsea match, then I just need to go to BetDex, have a Solana wallet with USDC in it, go to the BetDex front end and place that bet. Is that the only thing I have to do? Or is there like an intermediary step there where the user deposits into BetDex and then places those bets?
00:35:23.830 - 00:35:49.574, Speaker C: Right now, it's a completely non custodial approach. So as long as you have a solflare wallet or phantom or any other kind of, like, self custody wallet you have, all the trades occur on USDC. So you have that. Then you need a little bit of sole for the gas fees. You can go and you can go and place bets. And once that money is when the market settles, that money comes back directly to you. You can also do that directly by their protocol.
00:35:49.574 - 00:36:42.330, Speaker C: Right. If you're someone who's like a bit more technical nature and you're someone who wants to be placing much more trades per minute. We've seen that with some of our, I call them programmatic traders. They're integrating directly by the protocol and they're not even using BetDex on the bet deck side gets a bit of alpha or a bit of sneak peek. What we are building though, is we want to be able to attract like web two betters, we want to be able to attract the mass market. And so we are working on a solution which will allow users to deposit not just USDC, but if you have called a fiat onramp or you're not familiar with crypto, be able to onboard via fiat bank account, or if you have crypto but you don't have Solana or USDC, we're working on a solution which will enable you to deposit like, say like bitcoin or ETH or something like that. Right.
00:36:42.330 - 00:36:51.920, Speaker C: But the trades on our end will still all occur. Usdc SPL and so that is something we're really excited about and we're hoping to launch in the next few months.
00:36:53.250 - 00:37:08.030, Speaker B: That's super fascinating. I just love the focus on building out a better user experience. It's like something this industry has failed at to this point to just put it candidly right. Okay, that's fascinating. And now, I guess one more piece.
00:37:08.040 - 00:37:08.646, Speaker A: I want to touch on.
00:37:08.668 - 00:37:26.602, Speaker B: On this side is when you set out to build this protocol over a year ago now, what led you to building it on Solana? What was the grasp of like, okay, if we're going to do this, it's got to be on Solana. Talk to me about the technical journey of ending up here.
00:37:26.736 - 00:38:14.342, Speaker A: Yeah, let me touch on that. So there has been other sort of attempts at exchanges before, I think notably auger. It was more of prediction market and try to build an ethereum. And I looked at it, I valued that product in 2017. I thought it was interesting, but it was never going to work based on both transaction speed and cost per transaction. So it was only really in 2021 when we sort of been thinking about this idea for some time that we saw with Salana was not only fast and it was fast and cheap, it was sufficiently fast and cheap in order to do it. So actually it was feasible.
00:38:14.342 - 00:39:07.158, Speaker A: But also, I think nearly as important was it was committed to being fast and cheap. So we've seen other blockchains that are like, oh, we're fast and cheap. And you're like, because you've no users. But whenever it scales, it's no longer fast and cheap. And so with salana, I never see a day where tally would be like, yeah, I know, it's like $2 a transaction, but that's still pretty good, right? It's always going to be considered a failed case if it can stay sort of fast and cheap. And so the whole structure around Salana was that Salana is designed to be successful and continue to be fast and cheap. So that was sort of the second order thing, which is like, we can't start building on something that if we fear that if we're successful, it's going to fail because it's been so successful.
00:39:07.158 - 00:39:40.518, Speaker A: So that was kind of the main driver. The decision that we made was in early 21 or mid 21 to build on Salana. Then there were sort of no other alternatives. Today, I guess there are sort of more alternatives that are more like L two s. I played with a lot of the L two s. I'm not being convinced that even though that they're fast and cheap, I'm not as convinced that they have as long term a commitment to being fast and cheap. Or even potentially, which l two we would choose.
00:39:40.518 - 00:39:57.274, Speaker A: Like, if you had to choose one today, that you were confident that in five years time it was still going to be a major l two and that there's going to be a lot of liquidity on it. I just don't know what I'd pick. And that becomes really challenging as somebody wants to invest over five years.
00:39:57.472 - 00:40:13.822, Speaker B: When we talk about DFI, we do talk about liquidity, fragmentation and assets being spread across multiple different chains. But in your case, you had a business fragmentation. You have to pick a winner, right. You're going to build and invest your time and your company's resources on investing on this particular chain.
00:40:13.886 - 00:40:15.134, Speaker A: And so it's a very important decision.
00:40:15.182 - 00:40:21.570, Speaker B: And so it's very interesting to hear your perspective at the having to pick, your having to pick a horse.
00:40:22.550 - 00:41:01.280, Speaker A: And it's definitely, we come out of my space. I find crypto just like, way too religious. It's way too, like, this is my chain. And a lot of the arguments are religious wars that are like, we come out as technologists. We want to design a really good product that works for consumers. That happens to be Solana is the platform we're building on. But if it was a different blockchain, we would build on a different, you know, the level of the sort of religious affiliation with a single blockchain is ridiculous because normies don't care.
00:41:01.280 - 00:41:30.140, Speaker A: They don't know what web server you're using and they never will. And it doesn't matter. That's where we need to get blockchains to. If we want to get a billion people using a blockchain, they've got to do it in a way they don't know which one they're on or even potentially it's even on a know. And the focus of us as product developers has got to be choosing the best blockchain that delivers the consumer user experience.
00:41:31.310 - 00:42:02.900, Speaker B: So I guess the other side of that is, while Solana does offer the dedication to you, that fast and cheap will be their priority forever. It's not perfect, it's not without its flaws and it's still in developmental stage of its lifecycle. And so Solana's common knock is the outages. And we recently had one, the first one, in about eleven and a half months, almost at the one year mark, it's about four or so hours. How does that impact you and your product? When Salana goes down, stops it.
00:42:03.830 - 00:42:04.706, Speaker C: It stops it.
00:42:04.728 - 00:42:55.922, Speaker A: But honestly, we built fanduel and Aws. We had serious outages with AWS where it could go down for like six or 7 hours. AWS is nowhere near that, but I would say this is seven or eight years ago. But that was an okay trade off. So with Solana, look, any outage is bad, but it's just a necessary. It's something that we just accept and say, look, this is still a new technology, it's not going to be perfect, but it's being built in a way that success doesn't result in a failure case like success, where it's got millions of people using it and conducting thousands of transactions per second. And something that's being built for that's a much better trade off.
00:42:55.922 - 00:43:00.920, Speaker A: That, okay, there's going to be some outages in these early years. We can handle that.
00:43:02.170 - 00:43:26.640, Speaker B: Right. And one of the things you mentioned earlier is we do have this weird religious emotional attachment to blockchains for whatever reason in this industry. And you mentioned that if there was a better piece of technology that better served your use case, you would have the business discussion of do we switch? And so I'm curious. It's kind of a hard question to answer, but what does Salana not do today that you wish it did?
00:43:27.650 - 00:44:21.440, Speaker A: I don't think this is just Salana's as any blockchain, but it is very hard to build a web two experience on any blockchain. What does web two experience look like? Well, they don't have to deal with wallets. Transactions go through in fractions of a second, the user hits the button and they get a pop up, comes back and say, bet placed or transaction completed. There's no kind of strangeness that is really hard for any blockchain. I estimated that building a web two experience on a blockchain is probably like a three x harder than just building on a database. I think that's probably about right. And that's both on cost and time.
00:44:21.440 - 00:44:59.610, Speaker A: And so it means that today, if I could avoid building a blockchain, I absolutely would. I just would not build on it, because if there's an alternative, and so when people to me have a B to B and there's a supply chain, I'm always like, look, could you have a trusted third party that everybody in the industry would trust? And they would be like, well, yeah, we could. And I'm like, don't use blockchain. Do that. It's a lot easier. It's easier to trust. The problem that we're trying to tackle, though, is this industry of 10,000 sports books can't have a trusted third party.
00:44:59.610 - 00:46:13.170, Speaker A: And this is why we need to build it in blockchain. So what I'd love to see over the next couple of years is just more infrastructure that allows us to really create wallets. It builds, it allow our engineers to, instead of building natively right on the blockchain, actually has more of a middle layer that we can build on that makes it much faster to build web two type experiences. I think sometimes crypto get this sort of like time frame dilation, which is we can sort of see the future, but it's taking longer to get there than we thought, right? And we've all been guilty of that. The prize is enormous, which is why we're still doing this, because we see this one industry, which is like sports betting. The prize here of having a single protocol that every book could interface with is enormous, and that's why it's worth it. But the technical challenge of getting there is really big, and that's something that I think the industry should start to accept and say, look, there is a lot of work to be done here to get to building a product, and we cannot then fall back on.
00:46:13.170 - 00:46:43.200, Speaker A: Users just need to learn how to use learn seat phrases and it's just never going to happen. And it's a cop out on the product designer side to ask them to do it, because no other successful product, like I always say, the car revolution didn't happen when everyone became a mechanic. It became when cars became reliable enough to non mechanics to drive. Kind of what we need to do in web3, which is make it so that web two users can use it and they don't need to understand the underlying technology.
00:46:44.690 - 00:47:16.006, Speaker B: I just love that frame of mind. I want everybody in the industry to listen to that because it's very hard to have the emotional or religious approach when you're like, people just want to build good products, and that's what you should be striving for if you're building a bass player. But yeah, I've got a bit of an off the wall question here, and it's sort of to do with the intersection of social and betting, sports betting, and you're seeing a large. I don't know, large, but you're seeing a bit of a narrative around this.
00:47:16.028 - 00:47:16.214, Speaker C: Right.
00:47:16.252 - 00:47:27.834, Speaker B: Draftkings and barstool sports just got involved with each other. And anecdotally, if I'm placing a bet, I think the most fun part, aside from winning, is telling my friends about the bet that I made.
00:47:27.872 - 00:47:28.074, Speaker C: Right.
00:47:28.112 - 00:47:37.822, Speaker B: And so how do you guys think about the intersection between those things? Because I feel like there's potentially the opportunity to create some network effects around the integration of social.
00:47:37.956 - 00:48:09.658, Speaker A: So I've been involved in social betting startups for over 20 years. In fact, the first one I involved with is company called Flutter in 2000. It is a graveyard startup. I don't know any bigger graveyard, to be honest. Every year we've seen people try to tackle it. Betting is an innately social experience, but it is very hard to get the balance right. Like I would say, fando as a DFS product, was a very social product.
00:48:09.658 - 00:48:42.494, Speaker A: We created a lot of live events about it. We created a community around it. But if you just sort of do bet share with friends or bet share on Twitter, none of those have worked, but even some better ones, like. So draftkings have created, like, social groups where you could bet and share them. It's not been that popular. There's a product called dabble, which is in Australia, and it's now launched in the US, which allows you to share parlays with friends. And that's been quite successful.
00:48:42.494 - 00:49:12.758, Speaker A: I think that's probably one of the better approaches. So it's very hard to design that product. I'd say, with regards, bet decks at a core focuses on value and those high value customers. So it's probably not our core focus. Although I will say that that community is quite a sort of social community. They sort of know each other. Some of them are really trading bets, but it is a very hard problem to create that kind of like, social dynamic.
00:49:12.758 - 00:49:38.146, Speaker A: Or even for know, if you go to a horse race, it's actually a very social environment. In Britain. There's a joke that it's one of the few places you're allowed to talk to a stranger, but generally you don't talk to strangers, certainly not in London. But the horse race is very social. It's a fun experience. No one's really created that online. And so it's something that's still out there.
00:49:38.168 - 00:49:50.534, Speaker B: I think maybe as towards the end of the closing question here, what is the biggest unsolved problem that you also have to face? What is the thorn in your side that you're like, we just need to overcome this, and when we do, everything changes.
00:49:50.652 - 00:50:27.986, Speaker C: If you'd asked me a few months ago, I would have said liquidity. But now liquidity is starting to come onto the platform as all these market makers finish the integration. So kind of the supply side of the equation, I'm feeling, starting to feel like quite good about right for the protocol. The next challenge for us is the demand side. Right? Like, how do we bring in taker flow and taker volume into the ecosystem and making it really easy for people to come and interact with the protocol. And so that is the next biggest challenge that we have. So I think I hinted at this a bit before, but on the Betdeck side, we're working a lot on trying to basically abstract away the complexities of the chain and make it much easier for the masses to come in.
00:50:27.986 - 00:51:04.290, Speaker C: Right. Like we're going after people who are price sensitive betters, and most of them probably invariably have not have ever heard about the blockchain. Right. And so we want to enable those individuals to come and place a bet with us and have that experience be akin to how it would be at a bet fair or a matchbook or a smart. And so really thinking really hard about things like gasless transactions, account abstraction, and how to do all that and hide that from the user's perspective so we can actually and effectively go after a web two user is our next big challenge.
00:51:05.510 - 00:51:26.642, Speaker B: Well, Nigel Varun, this has been a fantastic conversation. I really appreciate the product focus and user experience focus that you and clearly the rest of your team have. That is something I wish desperately we had more of in this industry. So thank you and continue to keep pushing this product forward. I'm really excited to watch the growth of BetDex and the Monaco protocol in the future. Thanks a ton for coming on. Again, this was a fantastic conversation.
00:51:26.642 - 00:51:27.380, Speaker B: Appreciate you both.
