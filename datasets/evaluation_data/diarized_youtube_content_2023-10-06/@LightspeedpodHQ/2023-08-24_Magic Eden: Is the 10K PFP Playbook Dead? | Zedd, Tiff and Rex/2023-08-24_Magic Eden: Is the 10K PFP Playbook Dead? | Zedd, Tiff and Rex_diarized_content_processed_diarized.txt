00:00:00.090 - 00:00:16.720, Speaker A: NFTs will be used more as ways of driving user acquisition, engaging users, retaining users. There is still an expression of value, but it's not like, oh, I'm going to build a multibillion dollar business off of these JPEGs, which I think in retrospect, we can look back on and think it was kind of comical. Right?
00:00:22.850 - 00:00:36.646, Speaker B: What's up, everybody? Welcome to another episode of Live Today. We are joined by the team from Magic Eden. We have Zed, the co founder and COO. We have TIFF, the general manager for Salami Aka Solana. We have Rex, the co founder and chief engineer. Guys, welcome to the show.
00:00:36.828 - 00:00:37.926, Speaker C: What's up?
00:00:38.108 - 00:00:39.880, Speaker D: What's up? Thanks for having me.
00:00:40.250 - 00:00:56.990, Speaker B: Yeah, pumped to have you here. We have a lot to talk about today. We want to talk about royalties, incentivization programs, what's going on with Magic Eden and a lot more. But let's start high level. And Zed, maybe if you want to go first, let's just talk about the state of NFTs and to make it dramatic, is the Ten K PFP collection dead?
00:00:57.970 - 00:01:33.606, Speaker C: Holy shit. Jumping straight into it. I don't think it's dead. The form factor of NFTs I think is still up for debate, that's for sure. But Ten K PFP is, let's acknowledge it, it's the only use case that has worked so far. There are many other use cases that are being experimented on, but it is down pretty bad at the moment. But I think the main thing that is driving that is more that there needs to be a bunch of other creator types that have to come in and try things for NFT.
00:01:33.606 - 00:02:25.562, Speaker C: And that's actually where we spend a lot of outsized mind share at Magic Eden. But I don't think it's dead. I think to say it's dead is a little bit overblown. It's kind of like saying, I remember because I was at dYdX in the very early days of crypto, people were saying tokens would like ERC, 20 tokens were dead in 2017, right after ICO. But the form factor, it came back as obviously there were thousands more tokens that came even after that. There were tons of token models that were invented, like governance models, incentive models, DeFi summer, all that stuff sort of came after people were labeling tokens as dead. So if you kind of just take a step back and just zoom out sort of a little bit from where we are, which is sometimes hard because we're in the depths of crypto twitter, we're in the depths of obviously this bear market.
00:02:25.562 - 00:02:43.294, Speaker C: It may be really hard to do that right now, but we've sort of seen this before and I have a lot of conviction that this may not be the exact form factor, but it's definitely not debt. I think there's something here and there's a reason so many people are working on this. So we continue to be really bullish about it. Yeah.
00:02:43.332 - 00:02:46.660, Speaker B: TIFF, I'm wondering just I'd like to hear the same from you. How do you think about the current?
00:02:47.670 - 00:03:29.870, Speaker A: Yeah, I think people oftentimes forget this universal truth, which is like the current iteration of NFTs really popped off during the pandemic because people wanted to make friends. I feel like that is oftentimes forgotten. People primarily boys, men wanted to make friends on the internet. And then if you think about, well, was that able to maintain true. Was this the format that helps people meet people and develop relationships? That's the reason why NFTs are different from fungibles, right? It's because they reach into your heart. They're emotional. They're inherently emotional.
00:03:29.870 - 00:04:05.082, Speaker A: No, it's not really true. Right, but it's not because it's part of the form factor and the PFPs themselves. But it was a lot of the things that surrounded the PFPs. So remember back in the stone Ages, magic Eden used to have public mints. So anybody it was easy for anybody to enter the space and then we started getting botted to hell, right? And then that introduced the whitelist meta which we are currently still in. And then the whitelist meta is really prohibitive for new users to get into the space. Sometimes when people don't want to deal with wallets, right.
00:04:05.082 - 00:04:45.510, Speaker A: That also is like another hurdle. So then when you're like, okay, is this the thing that is going to actually bring connectivity and social interaction to the masses? Probably not. Although it had a really good run, I think also PFPs are inherently markets built on scarcity, right. And there are only a small number of social clubs that can be considered cool. Otherwise the whole thesis falls apart. I definitely think NFTs will continue to be a way for people to connect and form deeper relationships. I just don't know if the ten K PFP supply is going to be the thing that brings back the next bull.
00:04:50.250 - 00:04:58.490, Speaker E: You put it really interestingly there. Just like NFPs is a way of boys and men to make friends kind of in the cold COVID markets.
00:04:59.710 - 00:05:06.750, Speaker A: Think of it that's how I can relate to it as how can I explain it to a retail and collector?
00:05:07.810 - 00:05:14.580, Speaker C: I made friends with Mert over that. Whatever happens from here, I can call this a success.
00:05:16.150 - 00:05:35.640, Speaker E: Well, along those lines of thought, I do wonder for somebody who's just coming into the space or maybe has just heard about crypto through Frontech or something, what is the pitch for NFTs? Why should they care about NFTs? I feel like you guys are probably more qualified than anyone to answer that. What would your pitch to them be? Why should they care?
00:05:37.930 - 00:05:39.382, Speaker C: Do you want to take a tip?
00:05:39.526 - 00:06:36.186, Speaker A: Yeah. I've always thought NFTs, so I joined NFTs because I loved to write. So I spent like 2021 doing different writing programs. I got into three programs and then I learned that the life of a writer sucks, right? You just write for fifty cents a word or thirty cents a word. You pitch all day long to publications who don't give a shit about you, and then you try to publish a book and the chances are nobody's going to read it. So the amount of distribution that you can get and then the authenticity of ownership, I think are always like foundational elements for why NFTs are compelling. I think to date, though, I will say to be very transparent, a lot of the things that we've always known were challenges back in 2021 are still not fixed or there are still challenges that lie in the way.
00:06:36.186 - 00:07:21.606, Speaker A: I guess this could be like a nice segue to talk about the shit show that is royalties, right? That was the foundational reason why artists and content creators came to the space. And now that's even still today, it's like the longest saga that will never sorry, I should be more positive. We're still in that chapter that is currently having its fair share of trouble, right? So I think the technology needs to be more consistent in order to really get people to care outside of crypto and NFT outside of our native circles. But yeah, theoretically, right, if those foundational elements are there, the pitch should still be very coherent and compelling.
00:07:21.798 - 00:07:29.498, Speaker C: For me, we should lean into the things that make NFTs as the properties of NFTs really interesting.
00:07:29.584 - 00:07:29.834, Speaker D: Right?
00:07:29.872 - 00:08:52.338, Speaker C: And I think that Surface has really barely been scratched because all we've really done is we've pointed NFTs to images, basically, is like the extent to which we've scratched the Surface. And yeah, what TIFF was saying around ownership and then I would also add in there, you can make a lot of these things programmable in many ways and barely anyone has touched that Surface area. And I think NFTs as different kinds of asset types, not necessarily financialized assets, but we're in crypto, so let's be real. It's probably like the first levels of adoption will always be somewhat financialized, but that to me is where this stuff gets really interesting. And the fact that you can just spin up markets for anything, you can spin up internet level liquidity for anything, you can spin up internet level access for anything, right? Like, it's no longer confined to things that are physically possible, like literally physically possible between two or three people or some small groups of people. You suddenly have internet level scale for anything that you do with NFTs. And to me, that is what makes this design space just the most interesting of all of crypto.
00:08:52.434 - 00:09:33.762, Speaker E: So I want to touch on what TIFF said, which know at first NFTs were more about distribution for creators and artists and I mean, they still are. But one thing that we've noticed is especially with the recent news of OpenSea not supporting royalties anymore, is it's actually quite hard to enforce royalties for these digital assets on a technical level. And so Rex, you are highly technical. You have actually solved this problem with I remember you guys had something called the OCP or the Opencreator Protocol a while ago. Can you talk about one why it's so difficult to enforce royalties into how the different ecosystems tackle this ethereum and sure.
00:09:33.816 - 00:09:58.918, Speaker D: For sure. So back to the royalty and enforcement topic. I think the root of it is actually ownership. I think the most appealing reason for them is digital ownership in the form of NFP. That's kind of the really obvious and easiest form to attract users. And that concept actually attracted me as a developer. I truly believe in digital ownership.
00:09:58.918 - 00:10:57.520, Speaker D: And the problem with royalty enforcement is that if you give the collectors like 100% true ownership, then you give the users the right to transfer from one wallet to another wallet. The fact that you can transfer freely transfer from one wallet to another wallet, you can build a marketplace, you can build a lot of protocols, you transfer from one wallet to a smart contract wallet address. Right. And then the fact that you can do that, which means there's no restriction on the marketplace implementation that needs to pay, for example, pay back the creators. I think this is the fundamental root of why it's so hard to introduce royalty enforcement on Solana. What's really kind of like.
00:10:59.890 - 00:11:00.366, Speaker C: I think.
00:11:00.388 - 00:12:00.462, Speaker D: It'S also kind of feature is oftentimes the metadata and the standard of the NFTs are really standardized within the whole ecosystem. Like before PNFT, we basically did OCP attempt to kind of like being created experiment to see if we can create a protocol level of enforcement. Essentially, it's just a whitelist or blacklist model. So you want to take away a little bit away from the true ownership, 100% ownership from the users, and then give it that to either a protocol to a smart contract or a marketplace so that that constraint enforces. That the process of transaction. An NFT pays back the creator royalties. So later on, I think everyone joins the effort from Metaplex.
00:12:00.462 - 00:12:28.360, Speaker D: And I think PNFT is a great successful like a lot of ecosystem buying. And Mageeden was actually the first actually implemented PMT in our marketplace. And I think that hopefully that explains why royalty enforcement is fundamentally is a pretty difficult problem to be solved and you have to take a little bit like part of the ownership and then trade it off for royalty enforcement. Yes.
00:12:29.370 - 00:13:23.582, Speaker B: Yeah, was a really good answer. I think to summarize the last few minutes for the audience that maybe isn't as familiar, NFT is one of the big selling points when they first got popular was that if you're an artist and you do a mint, yes, you'll be able to profit from that initial mint. But maybe you're not well known at the time, but then you'll have royalties on secondary sales to, say, ten years from now, when you're really famous and your art selling for 100 times the value, you'll still generate revenue from that. And then people realize that's really hard to enforce at the protocol level, but on Salana, that's actually not the case at the moment. And that's because I think it's like 99% of the NFTs are under the metaplex standard that has some benefits in that you can put in these royalty enforcement clauses, which essentially says, I can whitelist, which exchanges, support these socially support these royalty fees. But also it can be seen as a negative because you have to rely on metaplex to actually update their standard, whereas on Ethereum you may not have that. So Chase Chapman has this line that NFTs don't have a revenue problem.
00:13:23.582 - 00:13:53.080, Speaker B: They have a recurring revenue problem because creators, they're making this revenue at the initial Mint, but you don't have this ongoing subscription fee. And Viboo, actually, from Drip talks about he would never wish a one time NFT drop on any competitor because once you do this drop, you have all this responsibility to continue to build, whether it's an ecosystem or a game to support the value around those NFTs so they don't drop to zero. So I'm just curious, maybe Zed or TIFF, where do you see the monetization aspect of NFTs for creators going?
00:13:53.610 - 00:14:32.766, Speaker A: Like, my opinion is that we were a bit away from figuring that out. I think what we saw with PFPs was a model that was inspired by crypto and I think it was inspired by fungibles. It's like, okay, let's put some images and then let's use Hype to sell this product. Right? And then that meant that in order to sustain monetization, you just had to galvanize attention. It was super unsustainable.
00:14:32.798 - 00:14:33.042, Speaker D: Right.
00:14:33.096 - 00:15:27.970, Speaker A: I think if you talk to any of the top creators in this space, you'd realize that mental health is like total shit. It's just this impossible train to keep up with. I think in the near term, as we're all deep in the bear, I still think of NFTs now as primarily engagement tools rather than monetization tools. And I think that's actually a more sincere expression of the content because they're really easy to acquire, they're really easy to transfer. There's this feeling that's like, oh, when I get this content from this creator, it's like something that they're using to thank me or vice versa. If I'm a collector, I want to give something to a creator. There is still an expression of value, but it's not such that like, oh, I'm going to build a multibillion dollar business off of these JPEGs, which I think in retrospect, we can look back on and think it was kind of comical.
00:15:27.970 - 00:16:03.018, Speaker A: Right? So I think NFTs will be used more as ways of driving user acquisition, engaging users, retaining users, and less so as fundraising tools outside of the scope of PFPs. Right. Because in order to monetize, the content actually needs to be intellectual property. What is IP? IP is when you have content that other people are creating businesses and content around. Right. Classic example being Barbie. Barbie is not Barbie because of Barbie making dolls.
00:16:03.018 - 00:16:39.098, Speaker A: Barbie is Barbie because of everybody wearing pink and going to theater together. So I think we are kind of a long way from that of having enough creators that can create content that is legitimately considered IP. Right. And that's because of many things. There's also no incentives and systems that reward people for creating user generated content or utilizing that content in any meaningful way. Right. Besides posting a PFP superimposed on their body as a Tweet, that's like the state we are still in.
00:16:39.098 - 00:17:01.874, Speaker A: Right. So I think a cleaner, pure way of experimenting with NFTs is just like using them as engagement levers. And that's actually where I look forward to leaning in, shout out to Cnfts so we don't have to go into that now. But yeah, that's how I currently see the market. But keen to let the guys jump in.
00:17:01.912 - 00:17:42.602, Speaker C: Yeah, I have a couple of thoughts on this. One is the TIFF was talking about basically yeah. So there's like PFPs or small NFT collections, there's like fundraising mechanisms, which is basically what we've seen before, we're now seeing. And this is probably true for things like open editions or things with larger scale NFT collection sizes, right. Where that's more like a fan appreciation kind of use case. And I would say that that side of things. So you can approach this from two different angles.
00:17:42.602 - 00:18:08.220, Speaker C: That side of things. I think the monetization is still yet to be figured out. But there are models of this outside of NFTs that obviously you can see this working for. Right. But it has to reach a certain scale to tip's point where the IP has to be relevant and desirable enough that you can then apply these mechanisms to that IP. Otherwise it doesn't really work. Right.
00:18:08.220 - 00:19:08.874, Speaker C: You can mint open editions for bands, musicians, artists that you really care about and you could conceivably imagine yourself doing that, but you probably wouldn't do that for some long tail thing that you don't actually really care about. And that to me ultimately is like a small niche community thing that you really have a deep affinity to or it's like some big brand IP that you resonate with that brand. Right. And these are probably the extremes of the spectrum and this is not taking into account things like social and other experiments that are going on. This is purely in sort of like the minting and dropping of NFTs space. But even in that spectrum, there's a lot of potential experimentation for monetization. And we actually were trying to push for this around the time that royalties were kind of going on on salana like Q.
00:19:08.874 - 00:19:12.778, Speaker C: Four of last year, we put up like a million dollars.
00:19:12.944 - 00:19:15.920, Speaker A: Oh, okay. I thought you were going to bring up meta shield, but.
00:19:19.650 - 00:19:58.950, Speaker C: That word's not allowed in here, man. But we put up this hackathon to basically incentivize creators to think about other ways to monetize beyond royalties. And now that royalties are back on Solana, that's great. We actually are really happy about that. And I think that's actually like a really strong just even if it may not be the most revenue generating thing, but the narrative is really strong around it. And to date, we haven't seen a stronger narrative around Monetization for. So we're excited to see basically this spectrum evolve.
00:19:58.950 - 00:20:20.400, Speaker C: And that is like, ultimately, if I think about our creator business here at Magic Eden, which so far has been very on this end of the spectrum, right. Like kind of the launch pad model, it's obvious that that extension has to happen. And yeah, we're pretty pumped to be working on that.
00:20:20.770 - 00:20:46.120, Speaker B: As you were talking through that, that jumped out at me is Seth Smith. She's the host of the 16 Z podcast, and she's created a lot of content. That's how she built a career. She talks about, like, you don't actually create the content to sell the content. You create the content to create a platform to then sell on top of. So, like, a super easy example of that would be you create free TikTok videos and then you sell a course. And I could see that being with NFTs, you don't necessarily monetize from that NFT themselves, but you just gather attention to then sell other things.
00:20:46.120 - 00:21:01.566, Speaker B: It everyone. We'll get back to the show in a minute, but I want to let you know that we got our permissionless conference coming up. Start conference of bankless. That's the biggest and best conference in DFI. It's going to be in Austin, Texas this year. Yep. I know you love it.
00:21:01.566 - 00:21:34.774, Speaker B: They got Tacos Barbecue Barn Springs. We got it all September 11 through the 13th. If you've been in crypto for a while, know that the bear market conferences are the best conferences because those are the ones where all the alphas had the people that are still in crypto all really want to be there. It's going to be great for build, building a network, for learning a lot. And look, we've got a phenomenal lineup of speakers that include people like Hasu Stani, Christine Moy, and Kyle Simani talking about ZK Tech roll ups, account abstraction, mev app chains, and more. Look, I'm damn excited because you're a listener of Lightspeed, you're going to get a special discount. Type in discount code Lightspeed 30, and you'll get 30% off your ticket.
00:21:34.774 - 00:21:45.280, Speaker B: That's right. Just type in Lightspeed 30 when buying a permissionless ticket and get 30% off. Click the link at the bottom of this episode and go get it now because prices are going up every two weeks. All right, back to the show.
00:21:47.170 - 00:22:39.200, Speaker E: So talking about monetization and TIFF, you also mentioned maybe the NFT model that's kind of based on scarcity right now. You probably know what's coming next. Obviously, compressed NFTs on Solana have kind of changed us around from maybe a mindset of scarcity to a mindset of just for the audience who might not know what compressed NFTs are. First, can you explain what compressed NFTs are? And two, what I'm most interested in is how does Magic Eden think about compressed NFTs? With things like drip kind of maybe turning NFTs into content, but even things like helium, which is turning NFTs into actual utility, like they use it to represent their hotspots, of which there's like 200,000 or 300,000. So just what is your guys'mental framework for compressed NFDS in this new shift we're seeing?
00:22:39.570 - 00:23:32.522, Speaker A: Yeah, I can take a pass, and then maybe Rex can give the more technical version of what I say. Yeah. To normal person, I'd say creating NFTs has costs. And when you have Cnfts, it's a new technology that allows you to mint a significant number of NFTs for significantly less cost. And if we think about Solana as a chain and where its superpowers are, the ability to have lots and lots and lots of transactions due to low transaction speeds, high transaction speed, low transaction costs, high transaction speed is the ability to actually power use cases that use a lot of NFTs. So this is very bullish for the ecosystem in terms of Cnfts. On Magic Eden, it is something that we're working on on secondary.
00:23:32.522 - 00:24:09.242, Speaker A: So, like collecting and trading Cnfts that should be live around, let's say, like middle of September, if not a little earlier. And then in terms of US. Powering more primary or minting experiences, that should be hopefully the same month. So sometime later in September. How do you translate the technology into a use case is something that we've been wrestling with for the last few weeks. Because if you pitch it as like, oh, here's this product, and you can mint now lots and lots of NFTs. Yeah.
00:24:09.242 - 00:24:57.686, Speaker A: Why does someone outside of Crypto care? Right? And also when you're pitching creators and you say Cnft, they're like, oh, that's cool, but I don't know. My L2 on east also is not that expensive, or even if it's more expensive, that's fine, I can just eat that cost. I want to stay on the other chain. So I think for us, it shouldn't be a narrative that's driven by the technology, and it should be more of a narrative that's driven by the use case. So challenging NFTs to not be about speculative assets and more about collectible moments. And so, yeah, I have huge admiration and appreciation for what Vibu is doing. I think it's great that there are other people who are working with creators as platforms that know how to work with creators.
00:24:57.686 - 00:25:49.610, Speaker A: There aren't actually that many on Solana, and it's great to see another player in the space. I think what Magic Eden can bring to that conversation is like a highly, highly engaged set of users that are very real and proven over time. So Magic Eden powered ten times the number of transactions as openc in 2022, it was like over 280,000,000 transactions. And then also we have people who reoccurring come to Magic Eden. Our average session lengths are around 14 minutes, which is one and a half times that of TikTok. So imagine being able to power the idea of bringing more collectible moments that have more mass appeal as a marketplace and then having really powerful and proven distribution. I think that is kind of a sweet spot where then creators can understand who is actually collecting my item.
00:25:49.610 - 00:26:20.440, Speaker A: Are they real, first of all? And how passionate are they about me? Right. This is like a problem that exists in web two. You cannot distinguish who is watching your content versus who would actually spend money on your content, like their willingness to pay. You can't distinguish your fans from your superfans. And because of what we bring to the table, both in distribution as well as knowledge about our that and then the ability to power that technology, that's where I think there are really interesting things that magic eating can start to play with. I don't know, rex, if you want to explain any.
00:26:22.250 - 00:27:33.370, Speaker D: I think Cnft is a great enabler because I think the superpower of Solana is like lightning speed of transaction speed and super cheap transaction fee. However, Solana is actually pretty expensive, creating on chain bytes or not. Before Cnft, I'm not sure if the audience, like, familiar with the NFT of Solana. Actually, to create an NFT, you need to create four or five accounts. And each account is actually pretty expensive to, quote unquote, rent. So you need to pay the rent fee so that your account don't get recycled. So it actually turns out to be, even for other L two chains on EVM, the cost of minting one NFT sometimes usually is cheaper than occupying paying the rent fee of creating an NFT on Salana.
00:27:33.370 - 00:28:14.390, Speaker D: I fundamentally believe, like, Salana Foundation actually wants to fix this. I only think there may be two options. One option is maybe, hey, compress the four or five accounts into one account. But I'm really surprised that Jerry Shao take this step way further. Instead of compressing to one account, it's compressing the whole collection into a merkel route. I think that fundamentally changed the game. It's not like, compressed that's, like, on scale.
00:28:14.390 - 00:28:32.910, Speaker D: This is like log N scale. It's way powerful to kind of, like, cheaply create Cnfts. I think. I have to admit this is a really good innovation coming from Solana.
00:28:33.250 - 00:29:07.030, Speaker B: Rex, is it accurate at all to describe Cnfts to people that are not technical? As you have this metadata off chain, you then use cryptography to create almost a fingerprint of that data and put it on chain in a trust minimized way. Yeah, for us non techies, perfect TIFF, you may have said this. One thing that just jumped out at me is when you said people spend 14 minutes on average on Magic Eden's website. Like, if you've worked in Product at all. That's absolutely absurd. So I'm sure a part of that is people are just looking for communities and Ft collections to see what they want to join, right. So a big part of that is Discovery.
00:29:07.030 - 00:29:54.742, Speaker B: So I'm curious how you think about the future of Horizontal versus vertical Marketplaces, magic Eden right? Now from what I know is largely just like it's one website people go to and it's almost like a aggregation model where you have all the NFTs in one place and people can discover other that's then you also have something like shopify, right, where it's like all these different websites use shopify, but you don't actually even know that you're dealing with shopify. And versus Amazon, where people go to Amazon and it's less about the actual products, it's more about Amazon and the reviews. How do you think about and maybe just to add on, because I think that made it sound like the aggregation model was a bit negative. You have something like YouTube that is an aggregation model. It's like the second biggest search engine, right? But one of the reasons they succeed is because they reward creators. So, yeah, how do you think about vertical and horizontal marketplace and Discovery?
00:29:54.806 - 00:30:07.790, Speaker A: And then we have this other dimension which is like multiple chains. So I don't know if you're like horizontal, vertical and some other three D, I don't know. Josh, do you want to take a stab at this one? There's a lot to discuss.
00:30:07.940 - 00:30:31.080, Speaker C: Yeah, there's a lot. Okay, let me try and tackle this in a couple of different pieces. One is like, let me describe what Magic Eden is today as just the baseline. And today Magic Eden is basically I would consider ourselves more towards the Amazon than the Shopify, right? But we're not totally Amazon either.
00:30:32.970 - 00:30:33.334, Speaker D: But.
00:30:33.372 - 00:31:56.074, Speaker C: We have this dimension of basically building on multiple chains and serving multiple ecosystems. So you come to Magic Eden, it should have all of the inventory from all of the chains all at your fingertips, right? And I think that has always been our sort of P zero thesis of what the Marketplace at least should serve in the let's call it short to medium term. And the reason I say that is because magic, Eden, and just the way that the NFT ecosystem is developing is that the reality is there is content on All Of these different places, and it hasn't played out exactly how we thought it would in the sense of we always thought that there'd be really different forms of content on different chains. So that hasn't exactly played out. But it's true that there is definitely content on all these different chains. So whoever can basically make that the most frictionless experience for a user to discover access, not feel like it is a tribal and segmented kind of market, I think there's a massive opportunity there and I think that Thesis is becoming more and. More true with just the sudden rise.
00:31:56.074 - 00:32:24.314, Speaker C: Not sudden, but the very recent rise of a lot of activity on on L two S now. And so I think we can get into all of that as well. So that's part one. Part two, I would say, is that there's been a thesis around verticalization of marketplaces for a while. I think I've read various things in the past about there's like a general model which is more horizontal, which is what Magic Eden is and OpenSea is.
00:32:24.352 - 00:32:25.130, Speaker D: And all of us.
00:32:25.200 - 00:33:12.882, Speaker C: Then there's more vertical, which is like, maybe I'll just serve gaming only, or maybe I'll just serve music only and go extremely deep into those verticals. And I think that thesis probably will still play out to some degree over a longer time horizon. But that requires basically you got to kind of think about the order of operations. The order of operations is like, there has to be some use case that forms. Creators have to come in, and then the creators then launch a bunch of assets, and then the assets dictate what the needs are on the marketplace. Right. And you see that with like I think there were some really gaming specific marketplaces that developed in 2021 that you needed like really rich off chain statistical discovery to determine what horses you wanted to buy for Zed Run.
00:33:12.882 - 00:33:52.274, Speaker C: Right. That was one of the things that was really important. But that relies on creators, the content, basically making sure that that stuff is still relevant and interesting for users. But I think those verticals are still just so early. Right. So that's why I think the verticalized thesis hasn't really played out yet, but I think it still could and probably will. We have also dabbled into the verticalized space just through providing Magic Eden kind of in this shopify, like, to use your words, like some shopify model where games are using Magic Eden's backend infrastructure and using that to build their own white labeled marketplaces.
00:33:52.274 - 00:34:20.480, Speaker C: Right. So I think that for sure is still a use case. But that isn't the primary thing that Magic Eden cares about today. The thing we are focused on is let's make sure we are present and available where all of the NFT content is being created. Right. Solana is a big part of that because probably there's no grassroots community as strong as Solana. I really believe that.
00:34:20.480 - 00:34:43.560, Speaker C: But it's true that there's content that lives everywhere and we're seeing different types of content form. So we should be the place that people come to. It should be really seamless. You should not even know that this belongs here and this belongs there. Actually, that mental model should just generally get expired over some amount of time, hopefully. And when it does, I think hopefully people will say like, wow, Magic Eden really did a great job there.
00:34:44.250 - 00:35:30.374, Speaker A: Yeah. So then to distill that into like, yeah, let me take Josh's big brain thoughts and make it. I think the very obvious near term goal is just to diversify the types of content on I didn't I was going to say improve, but that's actually not fair to the current set of creators who have worked really hard. Right? Yeah. In order for you to really deeply invest into different categories, there needs to be confidence that there are enough creators in each of those categories that can make like a ten X opportunity. And I think everyone is kind of feeling around right now that's the vibe I see in the market. It's like, oh, maybe I'll try this thing.
00:35:30.374 - 00:36:12.546, Speaker A: And people are trying to see what is the next best product market fit beyond the PFP collection, or people are trying to use PFPs that represent something different, that are not purely community, that are actually like DApps. Right? Like MadLabs is a great example of that. And that was the last project that really picked up a lot of steam on Solana. So I think yeah, first order of business is to try to get different types of content on Magic Eden, and then that gives us the right to think about verticalizing. And then also we do have to find a way to make people from different chains okay. With seeing different chain content. So this is like a big piece of drama, if you guys remember, right.
00:36:12.546 - 00:36:55.230, Speaker A: At one point, there was a point where you could see chain agnostic content on Magic Eden, but Solana specifically was really upset about it, and so then we changed things back. So when you currently go on Magic Eden, you see Solana first, right. Everything is prioritized for Solana, but it's kind of like we want people to be able to discover projects across chains, but we want to do it in a way that doesn't offend users. And that's also one of the near term things that we're trying to focus on. We strongly believe we should help the user do the things that they want to do. Right. We shouldn't be pushing what Magic Eden wants onto the user, but we ultimately do believe in a cross chain world in a very long run.
00:36:55.300 - 00:37:51.758, Speaker C: I'll give you guys one really concrete example just to crystallize the point. And the reason I want to give you the example is because it's hard to imagine in this world of where it's like PFPs and these kinds of assets. So imagine if someone wants to buy a Pokemon card and I'm obviously making a logic leap that these kinds of collectibles, physical collectibles, can be digitized into NFTs over time, which is already starting to happen, right. And it's already starting to happen on multiple chains. Right. There are many, many of these sites and vaulting services that a whole basically like stack that's building for these kinds of things. And as a user who wants to collect the Charizard Holographic from 1999, I actually don't want to know where it doesn't matter to me where the thing has been minted.
00:37:51.758 - 00:38:23.600, Speaker C: And so long as the thing is vaulted somewhere and I can trust it and I know that it's physically redeemable, I want to just be able to buy that thing. And the decision on, like, fuck should I do it on this chain or that chain or this chain? That should not be in the calculus. And I think hopefully if we do our job well, that's the kind of experience a user can have on Magic. They come here, they look at the inventory, they browse it, they realize that's the thing that they've been looking for, they buy it. Boom, done.
00:38:25.890 - 00:39:13.790, Speaker E: I'm going to push back on that, okay? Just for a second. So one thing I would say is I think sometimes the content or NFTs do make sense to abstract away for sure. One thing that I've seen in practice, from the market at least, is that some people don't feel safe storing highly valuable assets on, for example, some L two versus ethereum security. And so there are some interesting chain specific considerations that pop up. But I do want to take maybe a little second to do a little history lesson for the audience here. So Magic Eden did start on Salana during the early days of Salana. Actually, this is before or during the time of Salon Art in 2021, summer essentially.
00:39:13.790 - 00:40:19.330, Speaker E: And you guys were by far the most dominant marketplace by a lot. And then you made a decision to go MultiChain, which at the time had mixed reactions from the community, which is what you guys were just talking some and I've seen some interesting stuff on Twitter about this and then kind of Tensor came in and started maybe making it more competitive on Solana while you guys were also expanding multi chain. And so you've been through a lot of battles on multiple frontiers, right? And then you have things know, Utes and D Gods going from Solana to polygon to ethereum, and now Utes is going from polygon to ethereum. And so there's a lot of shenanigans going on here, which might confuse a lot of people. So this is going to be a hard question, but how do you just think about MultiChain in general? Have you learned anything from these events? Right? And what do you think? Everybody kind of gets wrong about these. Just tell us your honest thoughts on this whole MultiChain fiasco.
00:40:20.070 - 00:40:21.090, Speaker A: Fiasco.
00:40:22.470 - 00:40:50.186, Speaker E: No, just the community's reaction, because it's a very polarizing topic. So what would you say to the community and what would you say, hey, the decisions that we made were right, which obviously it seems like it is. And also I am curious because Z, you said that Solana, you think, has the strongest grassroots community. What are maybe some of the strengths and weaknesses of each of the communities you've worked with?
00:40:50.208 - 00:41:18.326, Speaker A: So before we should dig into this, I'm totally down to do it, but can I actually ask you Mur, because you're a big Solana maxi, but I actually want to know, do you ultimately believe in a multi chain future? For like, do you believe that as a platform, users would want to see NFTs across chains, or are you maximalist to the degree where you're like, I actually just want to see one, and.
00:41:18.348 - 00:41:29.050, Speaker C: There'S a difference here. I think everyone knows what you wish for, but there's a viewpoint that's like, what do you think is actually going to happen? Right? So maybe share both?
00:41:29.120 - 00:42:23.298, Speaker E: Yeah, I think it's a good question. Probably my perspective is slightly different than a regular user because I have this curse of knowing too much about the underlying details of the chains. For example, I wouldn't feel comfortable putting a million dollar JPEG on some of these chains just because I'm kind of sketched out about the security. I'd be fine with putting it on Ethereum and salana, but maybe not in L2, just because I'm not sure what might happen at the same time. That's not the only type of NFT right? There's like just collectibles, for example, or content, like music, that stuff. I'm probably fine with putting it on L2 S. And there are some certain types of NFTs which I am completely fine with going MultiChain, but then there are some, for example, Cnfts as well, which are only possible on salana.
00:42:23.298 - 00:42:52.580, Speaker E: And so it kind of gets weird. And I don't really have a good answer for this and I'm not sure anybody is, which is why it's such an interesting topic. But also I'm curious just how you guys think. So obviously it seems like maybe you guys have more of an abstraction thesis where the underlying chain details will always be abstracted away and you'd like to offer an experience where the user doesn't even know. Right, which is fair, and I think a lot of people agree with that. Would that be a fair assessment of how you guys approach this?
00:42:53.350 - 00:43:28.874, Speaker A: I think in the long run, yes. Right. But we're pretty far away from that, even at the wallet, right? Like, you can't actually seamlessly transact on NFTs. We've only started to see multi chain wallets pop over the last I hear. How about this? I'll take the past and then Josh and Rex, two wise gentlemen will take the future. So in terms of the past, yeah, happy to take. Basically, we decided to go multi chain.
00:43:28.874 - 00:44:46.706, Speaker A: I think we expanded to, what was it, like three chains in the course of like four months or something like this was I think we started going multi chain around the same time that Solana was starting to have its fair share of beatings, especially with FTX and a lot of stuff that happened at that point. So I think there was a fair amount of community backlash about why is magic eating going cross chain and why at this specific juncture in time that compromised a lot of trust in the brand. I'm just happy to call Spade as paid. I think also maybe us going to adding that many chains at that level of velocity was kind of like being a very small country and trying to invade China and other countries at the same time. So, yeah, there's definitely something to be said about, hey, maybe we could have done this in a different of and I'll say that know polygon and ethereum, right? But in the case of Ordinals, I vehemently believe we did the right thing at the right time. And Rex can speak. Actually, Rex is the reason why we were so successful on Ordinals.
00:44:46.706 - 00:45:30.690, Speaker A: He was the one who identified the opportunity and was like, we should do this. And yeah, we spun up a marketplace in around a month, right? A month and a half. I don't remember. Brex can go into the details. And because of that, we were able to ride the wave of ornaments and support all the success there and support all the creators there too. So it's kind of like I think in retrospect, the learnings were definitely that we could have timed certain events better, we could have built certain stacks more slowly and more comprehensively. But there is something to be said around timing the market specifically for ornaments that we don't regret and we're actually really proud of Rex.
00:45:30.690 - 00:45:31.880, Speaker A: Did I miss anything?
00:45:32.810 - 00:46:32.678, Speaker D: I think actually after chapter two, I think this is a couple of months ago, the whole company dedicated a lot more, actually most of the resource in Solana. And we will have way more products to be shipped really soon. I'm personally really excited about those things, although I cannot say anything about that right now. Don't want to kill the hype. I'm pretty bullish about Solana, especially like the new protocols and new standards, new use cases. Everyone knows it's a deep bear market, but it's also really great time to build, especially for engineers. There's just not a lot of distractions to take a look and we just execute on our product roadmap on Solana.
00:46:32.678 - 00:46:59.790, Speaker D: In terms of cross chain, I personally it's just a decentralized station. Maxi. And I honest. Think what? Ordinal compared to Solana? Like one key difference. I think it's the on chain assets. I think there's a lot of room. I think especially even on Solana, there must be room for us to move more NFT assets on chain.
00:46:59.790 - 00:47:51.460, Speaker D: Maybe the attributes could be on chain, the JPEGs could be on chain. Right now it's just a pointer to somewhere that's not even on the Solana validators. So I think the mindset I have is, hey, can we learn from all those innovations? Friend tech on base, the social tech, a lot of DeFi innovations from ETH. The on chain inscription ideas from Ordinals and absorb all this really crazy and innovative idea going back and put it back to Solana. I think Mageed is kind of in a really good position of doing that. And we're exploring a lot of sort of porting some of the great technologies back to Solana. Yes, that's my thought.
00:47:52.150 - 00:48:22.278, Speaker E: One thing I'll say quickly is that the on chain thing that Rex is mentioning, NFTs on Solana generally have a pointer to generally like Rweave or IPFS. I think that's what you're referring to. There are efforts to move that on. You know, nobody has done it so far, but there are efforts. But I think those are great answers. I do want to get Z's thoughts. So Z was one of the if people don't know, was one of the earliest employees at dYdX on Ethereum.
00:48:22.278 - 00:48:58.280, Speaker E: He was a PM at Coinbase, which is where I met him, and he is the CEO of Magic Eden. So, Z, you have a lot of good background and perspective on some of this stuff. I think quite underrated, actually. What are your just general thoughts on going MultiChain as a company in crypto, and what are some of the things you've learned and what do you think makes so there's the Dragonfly thesis of each chain is maybe a country or a city. Do you agree with that? Just how do you think about it?
00:48:58.810 - 00:49:02.300, Speaker C: First of all, I love it when Matt hypes me up.
00:49:02.670 - 00:49:10.060, Speaker A: He's like, hyping you up. But it's hyped you up. He's like, really important, so you better give a really good answer.
00:49:11.250 - 00:50:06.110, Speaker C: He's Hyping up, waiting for the drop. Funny story, though. I met I when we were just starting Magic Eden, and Mert was like, one of the earliest NFT, just like, Twitter guys that was very active on NFT, Twitter and on Solana, too. And I realized that he worked at Coinbase, and I was like, Holy shit, what are the ODS? I think probably two guys at Coinbase that were even interested in Solana. Anyway, okay, so there's a lot to unpack. So I don't want to do a whole Soliloquy on this thing, but let me try and unpack some of it. One is that from a pure chain versus chain perspective, I kind of do buy the yeah, I've heard many people say it Dragonfly, as many kind of people who've posited that chains are like countries.
00:50:06.110 - 00:50:40.750, Speaker C: And I think that is quite true today because the level of focus mind share that you need from both a technical but also a go to market perspective to go there and do a good job and be relevant and understand the innovation that's happening there, it's hard and it takes a lot of effort to make that happen. And that's why you see companies that have come to Solana to do things. Rarely have they been successful if they started on some other chain.
00:50:40.850 - 00:50:41.402, Speaker D: Right.
00:50:41.536 - 00:51:12.900, Speaker C: That's objectively true. It's really hard because you're not going to get as deep as, like, OCP and Cnfts, and you're just not going to follow that stuff because it's deep. Right. But it's important stuff. If you're building on solana. Okay, if that's true, then why did we go out and do that? Because to TIFF's point yeah, it was like launching in France and Italy and Singapore and Thailand all at the same time. Right? It really did feel like that.
00:51:12.900 - 00:52:13.622, Speaker C: And I can go through each of the chains because I think each one had its own somewhat level of significance. So Polygon, we went there mainly actually for a lot of the gaming projects because I think a lot of people know Mag Eden is very we believe in gaming over the long term. We have a whole team that's working on it. And even in this market where gaming doesn't feel like it's the hottest thing compared to 21, we have a lot of conviction. I spent a lot of time talking to our gaming partners and understanding the things that they need because I think it has the potential to really be a big driver of NFT activity. And Polygon did a great job signing a lot of gaming IP, right? Both Web Two and Web Three Native gaming IP. And to dispel one thing about the Polygon thing, we launched it in December, which obviously, timing wise, looked like we were just doing that because of FTX, but we were working on that since August, July of that same year.
00:52:13.622 - 00:53:01.734, Speaker C: It's just a very unfortunate timing that we happened to launch that as a lot of things were unraveling with FTX, so it wasn't a direct relation. Actually, from a timing perspective, we were always going to do it. And that, I think, shows one other thing about company building that I just want to call out. Company building is hard because it's so multifaceted, right? You got to line up the strategy around, do we go on all these chains? How do we do it? You got to line up the go to market. You got to line up the tech, make sure you have enough resources. And then when you do it, it's like, what's the narrative and the cons? How do you convey that to your users, the community, everyone who follows crypto such that they understand the decision? And especially in this market or in this industry, you want the community behind you. And I think, candidly, we just didn't do a very good job of that.
00:53:01.734 - 00:53:10.230, Speaker C: That's actually where I think where we really, really underperformed relative to at least my expectation from just a pure company building perspective.
00:53:10.310 - 00:53:24.190, Speaker A: But what I in defensive marketing at the time. I actually do not know if it would have been possible to garner excitement. It's very hard with our existing audience. But yes, please, go ahead.
00:53:24.340 - 00:53:29.950, Speaker C: TIFF is amazing. And yes, this was not a dig. Let it be known. This was not a dig at TIFF.
00:53:30.850 - 00:53:32.394, Speaker B: A lot of digs on the show.
00:53:32.532 - 00:54:25.410, Speaker C: Yeah, but would we have gone and done BD and partnered with all those gaming projects on Polygon? Would I do that again? Yes, 100% because I believe now we are set up for the next couple of years as the really high quality games continue to build out over the next two, three, four years. Right? Like one example we worked with Wildcard who we are really bullish on as a team. They were on Polygon and to work with them we had to be there, right. As much as we wanted them to come to Solana and do some stuff on Solana it wasn't possible. So we had to go there ordinals we already talked about. So I think we don't have to get too deep there. But I think there's insane levels of really interesting collectibility mechanics and on chain activity that I think is just really cool.
00:54:25.410 - 00:55:23.250, Speaker C: And the average value of items being traded or bought and sold is like five to ten x greater than the value we see on Salana polygon and then sometimes even higher than Ethereum. Right? So the properties there are really interesting and we're doing this like bugatti egg mint there in a couple of days. That shit's interesting. We're not seeing that anywhere else. Right, but that's cool. And ETH, I think is just I grew up in crypto through Ethereum back when DeFi wasn't a term and back when there were probably four or five protocols working on financial use cases, duidx was one of them. And I still believe that there is a gravity of weight when it comes to liquidity and some levels of innovation that still originate on Ethereum.
00:55:23.250 - 00:55:51.754, Speaker C: That's just the reality. So there is some level of some gravitational pull there. Right. Regardless and obviously there's a lot of creators there as well. So at some point I think to be relevant with NFTs over at least the short to medium term, there is a lot of activity on ETH and same with some of the L two S disregarding. I take some of the points. There's a lot of trade offs around things, including security and things.
00:55:51.754 - 00:56:12.642, Speaker C: But just from our perspective as a platform that supports NFT assets, it's almost like we're agnostic to what the assets are. We just want to make sure that the inventory, the discovery, the point of sale is all really easy and really seamless. So pure business decision, I think. Yeah, that's like a crucial priority for us.
00:56:12.776 - 00:57:19.594, Speaker D: That's really good what Z is said. But I also think if you compare blockchain countries, I think there's look outside the Earth, look into the galaxy, there's billions of planets and those aliens, those people who don't believe in crypto, don't believe in NFT, they're attacking us, they are fighting crypto all the time, they're fighting NFTs all the time. NFT is dead. Crypto is that I'm just thinking we should not fight each other, we should learn from each other and there's enemy out there. There's a lot of mass adoption opportunity out there. I think we should onboard them, helping them to understand us. I think this is kind of like yeah, the moment Joshua mentioned about blockchains and countries, I'm just thinking, oh, there's a whole universe of audience that we haven't even tell them what NFT is, what crypto is, and there's a lot of opportunities out there.
00:57:19.632 - 00:57:49.490, Speaker A: Yeah. I feel like Rex is like our personal Neil degrasse Tyson. Wait, so I actually did want to ask as a follow up. Right. So Mert was saying, hey, do you believe in the abstraction thesis? What is our shorter to medium term approach of cross chain awareness? And is that something that Magic Eden seeks to do, which is like introducing people to different chains? How would you guys respond?
00:57:51.110 - 00:57:52.274, Speaker C: TIFF's podcast now.
00:57:52.312 - 00:57:52.900, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:57:53.350 - 00:57:59.080, Speaker B: Taking over our newest I'm out of here.
00:58:01.530 - 00:58:06.822, Speaker C: Yeah, there's a couple of key things. One is are you talking about like product level things? TIFF I guess.
00:58:06.876 - 00:58:07.480, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:58:08.590 - 00:58:53.222, Speaker C: So one, I think it all starts around there's the obvious one, which is like discovery. Right. And it's very segregated discovery. I would even say even before we even get to Magic Eden, just in general, it's like extremely segregated discovery. So one, I think that's really important. Two is I think the and it's getting better with time, which is the ability to purchase transact without needing just the wallet plus like downloading a brand new wallet plus going to an exchange and setting it up. There's a lot of shenanigans process there that it's just getting a lot better.
00:58:53.222 - 00:59:26.866, Speaker C: And a lot of these native behaviors I believe should happen on Magic Eden or can happen on Magic Eden. And then the last one I think is around the profile experience. Right. When you are coming to check out your items, your inventory, all these things. Yeah, it should feel just like the stuff that you own. It should not be like I have to click these things and then look at my things I have on Solana, then look at the things. It shouldn't feel like that.
00:59:26.866 - 01:00:03.162, Speaker C: It should feel like, here are the things that I've just collected. And most of that is then pretty well abstracted. And then once you have those building blocks, I think you can start to really introduce users to new content that exists on the chains. And maybe the thing we did wrong was actually we tried to do that a little bit too early. Right. When some of this infra, some of the stuff that we feel like is quite possible in the near term was actually not really that possible. So it was basically just like a front end representation of the segregation that already exists today.
01:00:03.162 - 01:00:32.518, Speaker C: Right. And we just magnified that. Maybe that was the case. I don't know. I need to reflect on that a little bit more. But I think that is basically the direction when we talk about some of this abstraction work and it's really important for us, like some of the key surface areas profile collection page, home page, the end to end, sort of like getting the user to their first NFT and then getting them to discover the other types. That, I think, is a really important journey that we have to continue to nail down.
01:00:32.684 - 01:01:17.610, Speaker B: Z you were on a podcast with Bankless. It was you, Stannie, and Frank from Dgods. And this is when you were talking about going to Polygon, supporting Polygon, and we were talking about Dgods going to Ethereum and Utes going to Polygon. And at the time, Utes and Dguides were making up, I think, like 60% of the volume in Salon NFTs. And that's one reason Frank said that they were going to essentially expand into a bigger audience. Zed I'm curious, everyone in that group is talking about how there was this symbiotic nature of brands on Polygon and how that elevated individual brands within that ecosystem themselves, because you had Nike, Starbucks, these other companies all in one place, and that would benefit other NFT brands. I'm curious now that you see Utes going to Ethereum, it's clearly probably because of liquidity.
01:01:17.610 - 01:01:31.670, Speaker B: Do you still believe in that thesis? And on that, you also mentioned that you thought NFTs migrating to other L ones or L two S is something that you expect to be to see more often. Do you still think those two views.
01:01:33.050 - 01:02:32.214, Speaker C: Okay, on point number one, on both of those things, I still think that it it's a thing that is possible. On number one, the brand point, let me talk about why I think that hasn't been realized yet, because I think that might be interesting to illuminate. And I've said this to many people, including a lot of people in the Polygon ecosystem. A lot of these brands built in very siloed walled gardens, right? If you look at, actually the examples that you mentioned, even Starbucks, Nike, they actually built those in walled gardens on Polygon. So it wasn't tradable, really, on Open Marketplaces, the community was pretty isolated. So the users that know bought those or minted those NFTs. The same is true for Reddit for What It's Worth, which generated a lot of wallet addresses for Polygon.
01:02:32.214 - 01:03:25.006, Speaker C: Those users didn't they never really came into the ecosystem truly, right? They came in, did their thing, and then they never really came back again. So the thing that has been missing, I think, on Polygon has been this concept of, like, what is the home of NFTs there? How did these users then come back to do something else, right, rather than just attach themselves to the walled gardens? I don't have the answer to that, but that, I think, is just an unsolved problem. And maybe it's also, like, unclear if that was the best way to bootstrap an ecosystem. I think it's one way it could still work, but thus far I think it hasn't generated that flywheel that people had hoped. But I think it's possible. And I don't know. We talk about this a lot in gaming as.
01:03:25.006 - 01:03:51.846, Speaker C: Well, it's like all you need is if you have one game with a ton of users, man, that in and of itself is just going to be massive. So I don't want to dispel that potential way of growing because I feel like once we see one, then we're going to be like, oh shit, maybe that is possible. Okay, then point number two, which is sorry, what was number two? It was like liquidity or something.
01:03:51.948 - 01:04:08.938, Speaker B: Yeah. Number two was talking about how Utes went from Solana to polygon and now they're going from polygon to ethereum. And you talked about at the time, you said you think this will actually become more like normal, you'll see this more often. Do you still think that's the case after seeing not necessarily a failure, but the polygon thing obviously didn't work out for you?
01:04:09.104 - 01:05:08.670, Speaker C: Yes, I don't think it's for everyone, but I do feel like if creators are trying to achieve different things, they will still try things on different lot. Actually, a good number of our bitcoin ordinals creators, a good number of them came from Solana actually. So there's something to be said about that. And they launched rarer items, rarer collections, higher priced, all that kind of stuff on bitcoin. And I think with things like layer zero where they're making it a lot easier through like they have this thing called Onfts that allow the NFTs to then be able to be bridged much more easily over time. With infrastructure like that, starting right at the beginning of when you are conceiving of your collection, that kind of technology also makes it easier for the easiest cases to happen. So I don't want to necessarily.
01:05:11.090 - 01:05:11.406, Speaker D: Put.
01:05:11.428 - 01:05:42.410, Speaker C: This in sort of the creator's mouth, so to speak, but I do feel like it is something that people will want to experiment with still and we still continue to see it happen, whether it's successful in and of itself just by doing it. I actually don't think that's true. Same thing what I said about us going to other chains. That applies for creators too. You've got to be relevant, you've got to be native, you got to understand what is the discourse in that community. That all still applies. So just the technical part of getting there, that actually is like the easy part.
01:05:42.410 - 01:05:50.734, Speaker C: So if creators are able to and want to think about that roadmap, then I think they can still be successful doing that.
01:05:50.932 - 01:06:43.280, Speaker A: Yeah. My take is very simple, which is just because there are brands on a chain, does that influence or impact funnel down to individual projects? No, that's not necessarily if A then B at all, partially due to the walled garden stuff, but also just yeah, maybe assuming that linkage was there was maybe not correct. I do think there's something a very strong argument for do creators tend to create vortexes around a certain ecosystem? Yes. And we've definitely seen that with gaming and other use cases where it's like the leading indicator or reason for a project or a brand to choose one ecosystem is that other projects are in that ecosystem. And so I do believe there is that kind of a flywheel that does exist at a brand level.
01:06:45.330 - 01:07:17.480, Speaker E: All right, so before we do Rapid Fire, I do want to take a second. And just for the Salon audience who might be watching this, I would say Magiciden is one of the only teams I've seen that has actually been successful in going multi chain. So I think you guys deserve a lot of props for that. I mean, I know OpenSea tried to come to solana. It didn't really work very well, if I'm being honest. And you guys have succeeded on multiple chains, so that takes a lot of hard work. So props there.
01:07:17.480 - 01:07:52.660, Speaker E: And you guys have actually really helped the Solana NFT scene grow during the early days and even now, I mean, you just said the bitcoin ordinal stuff. So I would say you guys have probably gotten an unfair rep, which I disagree with. So just want to take this second to say thanks on behalf of the small community. Now let's get spicy. So now I'm going to do rapid fire. The order of these will be TIFF, Z and then Rex. And then try to keep them short, but if you want to ship us, go ahead.
01:07:52.660 - 01:07:56.360, Speaker E: All right, thoughts on.
01:07:59.530 - 01:08:03.720, Speaker A: Super bullish. Rex, I think, can take the stage on this one.
01:08:08.110 - 01:08:15.580, Speaker D: I think it's an idea being tried many times and looks like this time is the most promising one.
01:08:17.790 - 01:08:20.230, Speaker C: Bullish on my side, too, but I.
01:08:20.320 - 01:08:23.642, Speaker D: Wish there could be a Solana version.
01:08:23.706 - 01:08:24.030, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:08:24.100 - 01:08:29.120, Speaker D: Happy to see more competitors jumping to build similar friend tech.
01:08:30.930 - 01:08:34.610, Speaker E: Well, talking about competition, what are your thoughts on competition?
01:08:36.230 - 01:08:59.480, Speaker A: I don't lie awake thinking about market share on Salana, because I think the market is to the point where we need to figure out how to grow the market and bring more creators in and yeah, okay. 40, 50, 60% market share. I don't know, it's just not something I let away thinking about.
01:09:01.050 - 01:09:49.450, Speaker C: Yeah, actually I think about tam of this market more than I think about competition because just things like Fronttech Illuminate that massively. It's kind of like step changes in innovation or a use case that suddenly gets a lot of people excited and brings people in. I think that is more important to think about. I think competition from like a pure NFT marketplace perspective, there's a lot of NFT marketplaces, I think for Magic Eden, if I were to describe where we need to be is when people think about NFTs, whether it's the actual word NFTs or just the form factor in which they get popular, they should think about Magic Eden. That to me is a success case. Over the long term.
01:09:51.310 - 01:10:10.430, Speaker D: I think we should probably leaning more what customers want instead of what competitors is doing. If customers want really smooth trading experience, let's improve dramatic improve the trading experience. If customers want better rewards program, let's build a fucking better rewards program for our users.
01:10:12.610 - 01:10:13.406, Speaker B: Love it.
01:10:13.508 - 01:10:16.690, Speaker C: Rex, you heard it here. First Rex.
01:10:19.030 - 01:10:37.426, Speaker B: First Aliens, now the token AirDrop. Hey, Mert, I got my last one that I got to throw in here. Okay, so we're talking about competition. You see Tensor go from 2% market share in February. They have a point system or loot box that goes live starting in February. Now they're all the way up to like, 45% market share. Are you bullish or bearish? I know this is a nuanced question, but it's fire round.
01:10:37.426 - 01:10:42.220, Speaker B: Are you bullish or bearish? These incentivization programs during this type of bear market?
01:10:43.550 - 01:11:04.260, Speaker A: I can go first. I think all the incentivization programs to date have been incredibly mercenary and only reward one side of the market. And what we want to do is flip the table and reward all sides of the market. So pretty excited to bring something new to the table that just it's something that could actually bring new users into the space.
01:11:05.670 - 01:11:07.170, Speaker E: OOH, alpha.
01:11:07.830 - 01:11:10.130, Speaker C: Yeah. I think rewards can be more magical.
01:11:12.470 - 01:11:13.934, Speaker D: Make NFT magic.
01:11:13.982 - 01:11:20.238, Speaker E: Okay, Rex has just best soundbite we're.
01:11:20.254 - 01:11:21.780, Speaker B: Going to make a soundboard for.
01:11:22.410 - 01:11:36.060, Speaker E: All right, your favorite app in crypto that's not NFTs or Friend. You go first.
01:11:36.430 - 01:11:43.674, Speaker A: I'll give Drip their flowers. I think it's cool what they've built. Appreciate. Oh, shoot. Not NFTs.
01:11:43.802 - 01:11:48.126, Speaker D: Yes. Wait, can you repeat the question again?
01:11:48.228 - 01:11:56.658, Speaker A: Coinbase. Because they power seamless transactions. Dude, all I do is NFTs yeah.
01:11:56.744 - 01:12:01.646, Speaker E: The question, Rex, is favorite app that's not Friendtech or NFTs?
01:12:01.838 - 01:12:02.580, Speaker D: Okay.
01:12:04.630 - 01:12:35.470, Speaker C: Z. I'll tell you the one I use the most. I use Unisop and dYdX the most outside of NFTs, but they're not really like consumer mean. I have to show D I DX because I used to work there, but they're not like consumer brands that I love, you know what I mean? Because it's kind of not like that. I don't know if there is one. I can't think of one that invokes me in that way, but those are the two that I use the most outside of NFTs.
01:12:37.890 - 01:13:15.100, Speaker D: For me, especially for Solana audience, I would definitely say anchor as a like, how do I describe it? It's like the 2.0 of how you write roth Smart contract in Salana, I think two years ago, just enables the bull market for solana. It's just like an influx of developers just being enabled by the anchor tools developed by Amani. I think that's a really cool tech.
01:13:15.870 - 01:13:20.010, Speaker E: Your three favorite NFT collections collective?
01:13:20.530 - 01:13:23.200, Speaker A: Oh, I have two. I'm trying to think of the third one.
01:13:24.770 - 01:13:26.094, Speaker E: You can take cut.
01:13:26.132 - 01:13:29.600, Speaker B: Merit always asks, like, top three. That's hard. That's hard.
01:13:32.610 - 01:13:52.150, Speaker A: Okay, cool. I'll say, oh, I got to give Igor a shout out. Yeah. Bitcoin bandits. OG. I just feel like it's just a really pleasant community that isn't trying to flip every other day. I think Lily is really cool.
01:13:52.150 - 01:14:22.080, Speaker A: I think Bungel is one of the few builders in this space who's actually trying to create a real community that's easy and accessible and he's not purposefully trying to be esoteric. And then the third, I actually think Google's are really cool. I think George is really like just kind of the same vibe of actually trying to bring more culture to Solana, which I think we would benefit from. So they're trying to do a lot of stuff around merch and brand building that I think is different than what's in the space.
01:14:23.250 - 01:14:52.540, Speaker C: I was going to say Google as well. That was my number one. Not that I have one, I don't have one. But George, if you're listening, could really use a hand up here to ordinal Maxi Biz ZK. He's been doing so much on Soul, on Bitcoin, even from the early days. I just think that guy is just a machine. I have a soft spot for some of the really OG Salana collections as well.
01:14:52.540 - 01:15:10.720, Speaker C: Some of these I own, some of these I don't own anymore. But if I think back to it's, you know, it's Djin Apes, it's Salana monkey business, it's Thugbirds. I just have like a real nostalgic soft spot for when people used to go on spaces and just go.
01:15:13.250 - 01:15:13.626, Speaker D: This.
01:15:13.668 - 01:15:22.740, Speaker C: Was this magical time. Something about it I yearned for. Yearn for those again.
01:15:25.190 - 01:15:50.730, Speaker D: Fuck down for me. I actually own a lot of these, trade a lot. But I really want to highlight some of the builders behind those collections. Fox is one of them. Malaz, of course. And also bitcoin bandaid. OMB.
01:15:50.730 - 01:15:54.046, Speaker D: Yeah, these are on top of my mind.
01:15:54.148 - 01:16:02.560, Speaker A: And blocksmith. Labs. We should give them their flowers. They've built incredible tooling. Yeah, I think they're one of the best builders in the space.
01:16:03.810 - 01:16:06.430, Speaker E: How do you explain what you do to your parents?
01:16:07.750 - 01:16:32.650, Speaker A: Dude, I think my parents think I work at an art gallery. My dad knows about NFTs and asked about OpenSea and I was like, no, I don't work there. My mom was like, oh, we have money you can invest. Do you want to take some of my money? I was like, no, don't let me play with the family money on JPEGs. Yeah, I think something about NFTs and Art is their extensive knowledge.
01:16:33.790 - 01:16:59.522, Speaker C: Yeah, I've stopped trying like I couldn't explain to them. dYdX at the mean Coinbase is somewhat explainable. And then when I just said I was leaving Coinbase to do something else more risky in crypto, they couldn't really accept. Just at this point, I sort of leave it as people collect some stuff online and then we let people do that, man. It's not easy thing to do.
01:16:59.656 - 01:17:16.760, Speaker A: Oh, back to favorite collections, by the way. I also have to give flowers to asset dash. They're also building something very real. I think the most real event loyalty program. And they're really experimental too. Especially with Cnft. So I think they're really cool.
01:17:16.760 - 01:17:21.180, Speaker A: Rex, what do your parents think you do?
01:17:22.350 - 01:17:48.930, Speaker D: It's very hard to explain to them, but once they got, hey, this is some digital art, digital ownership thing, they started to get it. But it's also kind of crazy. Like always, the news about medicine seems like the bad ones broadcasted the most. So sometimes when we chat, they just worry about that, I think. Yeah, it's kind of normal.
01:17:51.270 - 01:17:58.950, Speaker E: All right, two more. One is what is your most unpopular opinion in crypto?
01:18:00.650 - 01:18:17.690, Speaker A: I think most people are not going to mess with a noncustodial wallet. I love Phantom. There are boys. But until that's easier, I can't possibly get my friends to even buy an entity. I think that's a huge hurdle.
01:18:18.030 - 01:18:43.730, Speaker C: I don't know if this is unpopular or just I don't know, I'll just say it. I think we haven't seen the last of royalties by any means. Like, there's going to be just more drama, more shit to happen. But I actually think they're a critical part of what makes the NFT narrative really viable.
01:18:47.610 - 01:18:52.680, Speaker D: For me. Web three is easier than web two.
01:18:54.330 - 01:18:57.786, Speaker E: Another sound bite. Hold on.
01:18:57.808 - 01:19:01.740, Speaker B: Can you give one more sentence of why you say that?
01:19:02.910 - 01:19:20.560, Speaker D: I think it's like the infrastructure logins wallet ecosystem is just, like, so convenient available versus compared to web two, it's very fragmented. There's web two giants you need to fight. In web3, it's just much easier to get started.
01:19:22.210 - 01:19:40.786, Speaker E: All right, I'm going to do something different. I'm going to personalize this last one for each person on the panel. TIFF, you talked about how you wanted to be a writer and you want to write before you were also formerly, or maybe you still are, head of marketing as well as Solana. What is one writing tip and one marketing tip that you would give to people listening?
01:19:40.898 - 01:19:51.340, Speaker A: Oh, show, don't tell. So explain how something is cool or prove how something is cool rather than telling people it's cool.
01:19:54.270 - 01:20:10.670, Speaker E: All right, z, you are a great product. Mind, I'm going to hype you up a little bit again. What is one piece of advice you would have for people doing product? Product managers, CEOs, founders.
01:20:12.710 - 01:20:44.778, Speaker C: Don'T forget to talk to your users. Very easy to just gloss over that, but that ultimately actually is the most important thing. Even at a huge scale. At Coinbase, even my job was very different there. As a PM, we're trying to get hedge funds to buy Bitcoin. This was in 2021, right? With like, MicroStrategy and Tesla, all these things. But same thing.
01:20:44.778 - 01:21:03.920, Speaker C: Even at that scale, we were trying to talk with the biggest hedge funds in the world just to understand in minute detail how they could get onboarded. And the same is true in whatever context. So never under invest. Yeah, very easy to underestimate that.
01:21:04.850 - 01:21:16.950, Speaker B: Rex, I'm going to ask you a first question before Mert does. What do you think of product managers? Do you think that they're extremely useful in putting out requirements, talking to users? Or do you think they just do TikToks and sit in the pool and write a son of cards.
01:21:20.970 - 01:21:22.440, Speaker C: Before you give your answer?
01:21:24.650 - 01:21:59.060, Speaker D: PM is a super hard job. I have a huge empathy on kind of PMS work, but PMS actually needs to think a lot of things. So it's a lot of hard work that I think our PMS in this company. I mean, Joshuan and Jack are doing a lot of PM work since the beginning of I mean, they're the best PMS I've ever seen, and I learned just so many things from these two guys.
01:21:59.670 - 01:22:01.620, Speaker B: It's very PC. Thank you.
01:22:02.870 - 01:22:16.470, Speaker E: No sound bite there. Well, Rex, what is one piece of advice you'd give to Web Two? Developers looking to break into Web Three? And also, what is one piece of advice you would give to existing blockchain engineers?
01:22:19.370 - 01:22:37.250, Speaker D: I think learn by doing. Just don't be afraid to get started. I mean, there's so many tools out there, so many information out there. Spend your time to get something going. Ships join hackathons. I know there's one going on. Only possible on solana.
01:22:37.250 - 01:23:04.150, Speaker D: Yeah, try that to see how you can build something. And as I mentioned, web Three is actually easier than Web Two. The space is smaller, which means the information flow is much more efficient. Like, go on Twitter. Join the communities. Follow mert. So you get a lot of offers from yeah.
01:23:04.150 - 01:23:07.880, Speaker D: Learn by doing. I think that's the fastest guess.
01:23:09.690 - 01:23:10.440, Speaker E: Right?
01:23:11.210 - 01:23:21.678, Speaker B: That was really great. Rex sad. TIFF thanks so much for coming on. It's a really good episode. I advise everyone check out magic Eden. Look, solana One is just so cheap. If you're going to mess with NFTs for the first time, it's a way to do it.
01:23:21.678 - 01:23:24.270, Speaker B: But, guys, thank you so much. This was an awesome conversation.
01:23:25.410 - 01:23:26.062, Speaker C: Thanks, Guys.
01:23:26.116 - 01:23:26.880, Speaker D: Thank you.
01:23:27.890 - 01:23:28.334, Speaker C: All right.
01:23:28.372 - 01:23:29.100, Speaker B: We'll see you next time.
