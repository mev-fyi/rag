00:00:00.440 - 00:00:25.805, Speaker A: Right now anyone in the world with simply an Internet connection can hold tokenized dollars that's like never before existed. Like if we zoom out in the span of human history that's like just fundamentally powerful, you know, people are no longer entrapped by the currency of their country that they're in.
00:00:26.105 - 00:01:03.968, Speaker B: This episode is sponsored by SEI. The Parallel Execution EVM compatible layer 1 with sub second finality incentives for users are coming to SEI this month from teams like DragonSwap. Start farming on SEI today by visiting DragonSwap app. We'll hear more from SEI later in the show. Hello and welcome back to another episode of Light Speaking. Today we have McBrennan Pete rejoining the pod after being on lightspeed episode number two way back in June of 2023 I believe. June or July.
00:01:03.968 - 00:01:14.985, Speaker B: McBrennan Pete is the co founder of Margin Group which is the developer company behind Margin Fi, one of the larger Defi protocols on Solana. McBrennan, thanks for coming back and rejoining the pod.
00:01:15.685 - 00:01:17.145, Speaker A: Thank you for having me.
00:01:17.695 - 00:01:26.115, Speaker B: Are you. Is your summer closing out well? I know, I know you're New York based. It feels a little more fall like here, but things are going well.
00:01:26.495 - 00:01:50.579, Speaker A: Yeah, it's been a very busy summer so I haven't gotten to enjoy all of it. I'm looking to enjoy. I'll be in Singapore for the Solana Breakpoint conference, so maybe that'll be. Maybe that'll be fun. But I'm a warm weather person so I'm much happier in the summer than in the winter.
00:01:50.747 - 00:02:04.055, Speaker B: A hundred percent man. Yeah, I. So I looked into going to Break Point. I ultimately didn't. Is it like more than 24 hours travel time to get to Singapore for you? All the flights I was looking at were just atrocious.
00:02:04.555 - 00:02:28.309, Speaker A: Yeah. So fun fact, before I. My main spot was in New York, I, I lived in Singapore for like about eight months a year and New York to Singapore is the longest commercial flight in the world non stop. And I've done that one about like eight times. It's like an 18 hour flight nonstop. Yeah.
00:02:28.397 - 00:02:37.691, Speaker B: Geez man. That's a long time to be in a single airplane. I don't know how they keep it up for that long. That is. That's crazy. There you go. Fun fact.
00:02:37.691 - 00:03:21.321, Speaker B: Things you didn't expect to get on Lightspeed. But we do not have McBrennan here to talk about airplanes entirely. We also are sort of going to get into what's an interesting point of time in crypto markets in Solana in general. And sort of a very interesting kind of tweet that set off some conversation between McBriden and myself. But before we do all that, the first, the last episode you were on, which I was watching while prepping for this episode, was Basically Solana DeFi 2.0, you know, the comeback, the return, what's going to characterize it. And it was recorded last summer and it was very prescient.
00:03:21.321 - 00:03:59.055, Speaker B: You know, there in fact was a takeoff in volume fees, just general interest in Solana Defi that came in the months following it. And Mert kicked off that episode by basically asking you like, what are you seeing in Solana Defi right now? Like what's the, what's just the state of Solana Defi currently. So I'm going to kick it off with the same question to you, McBrannon. What is, what are you seeing in Solana Defi right now? Like, just give me your one or two sentence characterization of the state of Solana defy early September 2024.
00:04:00.075 - 00:04:40.905, Speaker A: Yeah, good. A lot of primitives are established, stress tested. Risk management has been something a lot of a fair amount of teams have prioritized. So that's good and that's enabling like completely new differentiated solutions to be built on top of these solutions. And the copy pasting is as like extreme diminishing return at this point. Bad is developing on Salon is really hard still. So there's not a ton of new teams.
00:04:40.905 - 00:05:09.603, Speaker A: There's a healthy amount, but there could absolutely be more. Users are still, there's very, a very small subset of users still are using Solana Defi. So that needs to grow by magnitudes and capital is still small on Solana compared to other ecosystems and that could be growing faster too. So I think that's like a quick.
00:05:09.739 - 00:05:34.865, Speaker B: Good and bad as far as the sort of recent and by recent I mean past couple of weeks, past month decline in things like Dex volume or tvl. Do you think that that's indicative of a larger trend or is that a temporary dip and do you think that will retain the level that we saw sort of this summer?
00:05:35.365 - 00:06:51.425, Speaker A: Yeah, there's definitely a real correlation between sentiment and between macro, which impacts sentiment and on chain volumes and on chain liquidity. So there's very real correlations between those two. And you know there's things happening at a macro scale right now and you know, there's things happening at a supplement level that I think could be feeding into that. Yeah. So to answer your question, I think that's the reason why and given the absence of, or just the waiting period or the maturation process of new teams, new primitives, new ways to interact with Solana Defi to sort of offset those macro moves. That's where I think, like, there could be more happening. And if we had, if we had more of that, I think, yeah, the macro wouldn't be as much of an impact, to be as, like, simple as possible.
00:06:52.285 - 00:07:36.889, Speaker B: Yeah. The sentiment is an interesting question because we, you know, in the Lightspeed newsletter I put out every day, we often will do like a pulse check or look at just sort of the social sentiment around Solana and it feels like it's just always bad no matter what. Or like there were like four days where people were happy in, like, I don't know, March 2024. And I think something about sort of just the dominance of meme coins. This cycle has created a lot of grumpiness because it's like, even if the ecosystem is doing well, a lot of the retail traders are doing poorly, even though they are contributing to TV and things like this. So I don't know, the sentiment is an interesting one. You almost wonder what it would take for sentiment to get better.
00:07:36.889 - 00:08:40.717, Speaker B: And as I say this, McBrannon, I think this is actually a good segue into what I had wanted to kind of bring you on the pod to talk about, which is a tweet you wrote, I don't know, a couple weeks ago now, where the first line of it was, I'm seeing a pretty real exhaustion from a fair share of talented crypto founders right now. And the tweet went viral. Ish. I don't know, hundreds of likes, many, many replies, and a lot of people seemed to resonate or sort of agree with that sentiment. And you listed just a bunch of reasons for where you're seeing this exhaustion, this tiredness from founders is coming from. And yeah, I want to sort of go through some of the reasons you pointed out for the exhaustion, the tiredness, and just unpack them piece by piece. And I think with what you're saying, you know, we're in a place where it looks like maybe the price is down a little bit.
00:08:40.717 - 00:09:43.219, Speaker B: Transaction count, priority fees, total economic value, all these factors that we sort of track are getting closer to early 2024 levels. It looks like maybe the summer 2024, you know, defy excitement around Solana is cooling a bit. And I think it's. It's interesting to unpack a little bit of this tiredness, especially seeing as, as we mentioned before, we are a couple weeks out from Breakpoint. So I have kind of just jotted down like the first sentence and I'm going to just walk through like some of the interesting points I think that you bring up here and kind of get you to expand. So the first one is on chain users and markets still aren't meaningfully scaling. So it's actually funny because way back when on LightSpeed podcast number two, you were asked for like a Solana hot take or something along those lines, and you basically said, solana, Defi is never going to succeed unless it can meaningfully draw users and liquidity.
00:09:43.219 - 00:09:55.135, Speaker B: And you've sort of said here, hey, that's not happening. So what did you mean by that? And I guess, what are your goalposts for what it would look like for users in the market to scale?
00:09:56.115 - 00:10:36.815, Speaker A: Yeah, I think one quick tidbit before I dive into that is also, I think at margin, we're very pragmatic. I think a lot of like Salon is very pragmatic, which I enjoy a lot. Like, we're not. We don't enjoy gaslighting or sort of like saying things are better than they really are. That being said, since that podcast number two, like, there's definitely a hell of a lot more users and liquidity on chain. So I'm happy about that. And it has scaled from that point.
00:10:36.815 - 00:11:49.305, Speaker A: But yeah, like diving into the first part of what you're saying. Yeah. So Defi users, I would ballpark, there's about half a million Defi users that are like daily active users, really excited about using Defi on a daily basis across all of Defi right now, like, not just Solana Defi, like across Ethereum, like L2S and Solana. And I want to reiterate like, just how tiny that is and how like very immaterial that is in the grand scheme of things. Like, before Margin, my last company, I scaled a consumer health tech app. And 500,000 users is something that on a single app that you'd struggle to raise money on. And so we're talking about this for, obviously it's different with Defi, but we're talking about this with all of like Defi.
00:11:49.305 - 00:13:13.145, Speaker A: So there it goes without saying, there's a lot of hurdles to this. There's a lot of regulatory hurdles. There's a lot of just like ambiguous ambiguity among, like around any on off chain integration, which is a massive, massive obstacle to this. There's things teams can't say, can't do. There's just a lot of like handcuffs around aspiring like existing Defi builders on and again, like not a lot of this isn't like black or white, it's just them playing it safe. You know, like we're obviously in an election cycle right now and you know, I would say that you, you know, the different parties have like pretty different or empirically at least have pretty different views on how they view crypto and how they might go about regulating it or what they might do with it, which is definitely providing a lot of uncertainty. And then, and then, yeah, at a macro level we're in a very fragile spot from like a macro level with interest rates and this is causing a lot of people to be risk off.
00:13:13.145 - 00:14:10.325, Speaker A: And you know, crypto is a very risk on asset. So there's all these things that I also want to like provide as contextual, like evidence to or just context to the current situation because they all matter. But yeah, I'd love to see on chain users and markets scaling at a much faster rate. We're still getting our lunch handed to us by Binance in terms of liquidity and volume and attention and onboarding and for that matter any centralized exchange. And it hurts nothing against decentralized exchanges, but there's honestly way less obstacles to trading or interacting on chain than there are off chain. And yet we continue to lose on that front. So there's a lot of things we need to do there.
00:14:10.325 - 00:15:02.369, Speaker A: There's still like the ecosystem is still, the technology is still very young. Ethereum is going through a bit of a crisis right now with their L2 roadmap. Solana still also has a ton of protocol layer issues that it needs to fix in order to scale. And you know, a lot of teams have been, have been backtracking and doing what they can in house to remedy some of these problems. Like a tangible example of that is we've done a lot of work at margin fi on our Oracle systems and the Oracles themselves have had to move from like push based models to pool based models. All of this is like really in reaction to just inefficiencies in Solana and things that need to be worked on. And that's just one of like many examples.
00:15:02.369 - 00:15:52.391, Speaker A: There's like tangible examples on our risk management side and all that. And you know, Defi is also just like a slower moving beast. Every new protocol addition we put out at margin 5 typically like not typically, always gets double audited and goes through this extensive review process. And we look at the financial risk, the smart contract risk and a bunch of nuanced things in between. And so the rate of building is sort of limited by. By that as well. So, yeah, I'm just throwing out a bunch of like, contextual things that I think may be contributing to this that definitely are contributing to this as well.
00:15:52.391 - 00:16:10.375, Speaker A: And all that aside, we've still seen very like, net new users are very, very small and, you know, I'd love to be scaling by 500,000 users a day, not like have that total across the industry.
00:16:11.355 - 00:16:59.707, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. And I appreciate the context you added there because I do think it's important to, you know, this is going to be maybe a bit more of a dour episode in terms of tone, but that's because, like, at lightspeed, we're not necessarily interested in just shilling Solana. No matter what's happening, we want to kind of get closer to the truth. And so I kind of appreciated your tweet, just as a journalist, because it felt like a saying the quiet part out loud moment a little bit where a lot of other people were seeing similar things. And it was very clear in sort of the response that the Tweet got. The SEI network brought parallel execution to the EVM with their V2 update this past spring. Subsecond finality and massive throughput are now available to EVM developers everywhere on SEI's High Performance Layer 1.
00:16:59.707 - 00:17:29.843, Speaker B: Incentives for users are coming to SEI this month from teams like DragonSwap. Start farming on SEI today by visiting DragonSwap app. That's DragonSwap app. Thanks again to SEI for sponsoring today's episode. Something I've been thinking about in recent weeks and even talking about on this podcast a fair bit is why aren't there new users? It almost. Yeah, you said there's almost no NET new users. In some ways you could even argue there's fewer.
00:17:29.843 - 00:17:43.735, Speaker B: I don't know if that's exactly the case, but in terms of liquidity, that's just dormant. I know certainly in media there's less attention than there was in the kind of pre FTX days. So what do you think sort of on the DEFI side is causing that lack of user growth?
00:17:44.395 - 00:18:44.363, Speaker A: Yeah, everything to do on chain right now still involves either governance tokens, stable coins, or like the underlying protocol token and like LST LSTs. And that's it. That's really it. And so you can make these like directional trades and you can speculate on these things, but outside of speculation, we're still struggling on the use cases front. The obvious like answer here and a place Solana has invested very heavily is like tokenizing physical infrastructure. And physical companies like, like off chain companies, like bringing them on chain basically. And, and this is, this is great, this is fantastic.
00:18:44.363 - 00:19:56.229, Speaker A: It's just that also like faces a bunch of hurdles once again on the regulatory side and just, you know, there's a bunch of ambiguity there. So there's very limited examples still of these companies. And the lesser the use case that tokenizing brings and the lesser the, you know, quote unquote utility that you can, you can make these tokens privy to, the less reason there is to tokenize if you're like an off chain company right now. And so yeah, that, that, that area is lacking. Yeah, like as a, as a, as a founder, I'm really interested in just things that solve problems and like the intersection of crypto on that. And like crypto's shown itself to be really good at decentralization, at censorship resistance, at sort of like aggregating resources and permissionless access to things. And that could be applied to, yeah, a ton of, a ton of existing companies.
00:19:56.229 - 00:20:34.815, Speaker A: It's just, it's just very slow. And until that happens, until that happens, we're left like speculating with the same assets over and over again. And that is, that is like a, that, that's sort of a turn off to like a lot of people looking at crypto from the outside and you know, wondering how they could get involved. You know, if that becomes the only thing that is you can build companies around and be more, you know, safe on the reg side. It creates a lot of exhaustion.
00:20:35.435 - 00:21:34.607, Speaker B: Yeah, I've tended to fall in the same place with this, which is if you want to figure out why there don't seem to be new users since 2021, probably the answer is that there's not new uses that have emerged that are very compelling. It sort of is the best predominant use case. Continues to be speculating on the prices of tokens, which is a use case. And it is, it is a business. And I think Pump Fun deserves its flowers a little bit for doing just an incredible amount of revenue after it was launched. But yeah, everyone is or many, many people have heard about crypto at this point and so you'll kind of have the knee jerk reaction of is this something that interests you or is it not? And if it isn't, there's not really a compelling reason for you to get involved. And obviously there are many apps that are trying to build into this, but I do sort of tend to fall into that thinking as well, I guess.
00:21:34.607 - 00:22:37.765, Speaker B: I'm curious McBrennan, just to break that down A little bit. It seems like there are three stakeholders when it comes to the lack of new uses. There's users ultimately, because if users demand one thing, there's going to be an incentive to build for them. There are investors who, you know, are the people funding your projects, letting you feed yourself and stuff. And then there's I guess, regulation, this very unclear environment for how tokens will be classified, whether crypto companies will be allowed to exist, things like that. And founders kind of are like have, have maybe these three stakeholders in mind as they're building and yeah, working on projects. So I guess of those three stakeholders, so users, investors, regulators, which do you think is the most responsible for the kind of current lack of new ideas or lack of new use cases to come out in the past couple years?
00:22:39.505 - 00:24:17.265, Speaker A: Yeah, well, users have issues and problems and in reality, just like optimizations, you can build incredible companies based off of just optimizations to things users are doing on an everyday basis or things users will be doing on an everyday basis. And it's the job of founders typically to find these optimizations and build a business model around that. And so we tend to keep solving for crypto native optimizations because there's an immediate, like the demand is met with like a crypto native solution. And so there's this like happy, happy unison of like problem and, and solution. There's just like a ton of optimizations that users have in everyday life in which crypto could provide a lot of benefit for. And the founder selection there is poor because of regulations and because of just again, ambiguity because there's not a lot of, when we say regulations, there's typically not a lot of regulations for a lot of these optimizations where it's very clear that you can't do something or you can do something. There's just uncertainty towards what people, what regulators will say in the future on if you can or can't do this.
00:24:17.265 - 00:24:59.405, Speaker A: And yeah, I think there's a lot of headwinds to founder solving these non crypto native optimizations. And so that's where net new users would come from. Those users are not using crypto solutions. So there's that. So I think it's like a problem of founders and then just supporting infrastructure regs. Yeah. And in reality the developer community in crypto is still super tiny.
00:24:59.405 - 00:25:39.525, Speaker A: You know, it's building on Salon is not fast. It's not like, it's not something you can like spin up in a weekend. You know, you, you need to take precautions on behalf of your users when something is permissionless. And on chain to make sure like security is tight and risk is tight. And yeah, when I went like, there's, there's still a very small group of, of teams building in crypto at large. So I think this needs to grow dramatically as well. And then more of these founders will just be tackling these newer problems and these newer problems will lead to new solutions.
00:25:40.825 - 00:25:54.835, Speaker B: This is an aside maybe, but do you have a take on like Claude AI and some of these AI software development tools we're seeing, Is that going to meaningfully change kind of the crypto developer world?
00:25:55.935 - 00:27:01.587, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think this is actually much more of an enabler for off chain app development because you typically have a lot more controls on off chain app development. And if you're building a consumer app, it's not nearly as mission critical as building a defi app. The problem is if you hook up Cursor and Claude and build a new defi app, if you do something wrong, people will lose all their money. So there is still a lot of manual intervention and oversight needed for building crypto products. And that can be solved for that's not, that's not always going to be the way it is. Like you could build this like we could do a better job as an ecosystem of building these like building blocks that are audited and sort of like very modular that you can then use to build the critical parts of an on chain application.
00:27:01.587 - 00:28:02.423, Speaker A: And this is also why I. Yeah, and like Obviously there's like 25 teams building solutions on top of margin fi right now and they get the benefit of knowing the MarginFi integration is extremely stress tested and it's double audited, it's open source, it's code verified, it's been through extreme risk management solutions and acted in the way it should. So if we had more of that as well, that would speed up the developer process. Yeah, I would love for people to be able to spin up products projects in a weekend using purchaser Claude AI and solve these new use cases for crypto. There's just a lot of still necessary security and risk decisions you need to make if you do that.
00:28:02.609 - 00:29:03.493, Speaker B: Okay, interesting. Yeah, I wanted to kind of get your take because I've been seeing all of these videos on Twitter of people creating apps with Claude in like 30 minutes or whatever. And I think it's a fascinating use case for these LLMs. I think like as a journalist a lot of people talked about ChatGPT as a tool, but it's not something I would ever use because it's just not like the chatgpt writing style just sucks. And you can tell that it's AI generated, but with code, it seems like maybe a more useful case. I wanted to ask you about that, but I guess getting back to some of the things you pointed out in this tweet, I guess the other one I had wanted to chat about that I think is interesting, is a little bit of crypto's image problem. So you wrote the crypto space continues to be extremely racist slash homophobic, slash bigoted in basically every way, which is pretty spicy.
00:29:03.493 - 00:29:31.045, Speaker B: And so I wanted to get you to expand on it. And I will say I think that I'm someone who, in my personal life, a lot of my friends are not related to crypto at all. And this image problem is very real. And I don't really have any friends that would seriously consider working in crypto or whatever, because for better or for worse, I just think that the world we live in is one where to many people who are not in crypto, crypto is not looked upon in a favorable light.
00:29:31.205 - 00:29:31.717, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:31.821 - 00:29:34.865, Speaker B: So, yeah, expand on sort of what you meant in that. In that section.
00:29:35.165 - 00:30:39.805, Speaker A: No, I think we need to be really real about this. People discount this problem severely. This impacts the way regulators look at us. This impacts the way nation states look at us. This impacts the way consumers look at us. Yeah. If our industry, to the average person on the street, is just repeatedly cringe, cringey, scammy, bigoted, and, you know, full of technical, like, very technical, like, very high barriers of entry, we will absolutely never, like, make sufficient positive progress with regulators, with nation states, with new users, with new communities and new countries.
00:30:39.805 - 00:31:01.955, Speaker A: And yeah, it's frustrating. Like, you know, you. You do want a level of legitimacy. And that doesn't mean, you know, you've got to. You have to do. You sort of have to follow this set path and, you know, wear a suit and tie and whatever. But yeah, we're fighting an uphill battle.
00:31:01.955 - 00:31:46.877, Speaker A: Like, the fact that Elizabeth Warren can, like, run a campaign of fighting like building an anti crypto army, and a ton of voters will resonate around that and want to get behind that and see that as very legitimate is a massive problem. Like the, like. Like, you would never say that. Like, I'm building an anti grocery store army or I'm building an anti, like, you know, any sort of, like, essential to your life. Like, people look at you like you're crazy or even really like, I'm building an anti Internet army. Like, no, we. Everyone has survived.
00:31:46.877 - 00:32:37.665, Speaker A: Right. And crypto is just not on that level right now. And so, like, politicians can make it part of their platform to like, completely derail this industry or try to. And people will get behind that and support that. And there's obviously a lot of invested interest that want to, you know, fund that and push that further because, you know, crypto does a lot of things that are much better than what exists in traditional life. Right. Like, there's a reason crypto is so cool is because, you know, it works better than the, in a lot of ways, the traditional finance system that we use, like, there's a lot of, like, actual real optimizations and even there's a lot of things that right now are not as great, but have a clear path of being better moving forward.
00:32:37.665 - 00:33:22.255, Speaker A: And, and so, like, I wish the industry would latch on to that more and use that as a platform. And, and yeah, just every time there's a major hack, every time a celebrity gets on and pump and dumps, every time there's like a new arrest or a scam or, you know, something cringe, that just takes us down a notch in legitimacy with public perception, with, you know, your friends that don't work in crypto, with regulators that want to draft like legislation around this. So, yeah, I think people tend to discount that a lot. And it's, it's very hand wavy. Like, everything I just said was very high level, but it matters a lot.
00:33:22.595 - 00:33:44.059, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there, if you're a founder or someone who's working in the crypto ecosystem, it's, it's worth thinking through. How do you translate crypto to a broader audience? Because I think one of the things that I tend to notice is crypto.
00:33:44.107 - 00:33:45.763, Speaker A: Talks to itself a lot.
00:33:45.939 - 00:34:23.455, Speaker B: So, like, you know, all of crypto happens on Twitter. I was talking to a founder the other day and he's, he's like, yeah, I'm trying to convince, like my marketing guy to post on LinkedIn. And he's like, no, let's just do Twitter all the time, because that's where you can go viral. That's where a lot of the conversations happen. But like you laid out in detail earlier, there's limitations to just building for the users that are already there. And I think that we're sort of tribalist people. Like, it's part of human nature.
00:34:23.455 - 00:35:21.969, Speaker B: And so it's really kind of seductive to want to just pull up on crypto Twitter and go to the same conferences and interact with the same people and do all of these things. But yeah, there's just a really large kind of market that isn't being touched yet. And I don't think that web 3 mass adoption, quote unquote looks like web 2 mass adoption because these are like financialized apps that aren't going to be as easy as say downloading Instagram and setting up an account. But there's certainly room to grow. And so what does it look like to yeah. Speak to people beyond the kind of crypto bubble is I think an interesting question and one that I don't think is settled. I guess one way that that could look is building apps that you know, touch the real world or kind of create these new interesting use cases.
00:35:21.969 - 00:36:07.605, Speaker B: I think one of the most like resonant use cases with some of my just non crypto friends is microtransactions. Right. So it's very easy to explain that on traditional payment Rails, stripe charges a 30 cent processing fee plus 3% or something like that. So if you wanted to tip 50 cents, it's, it doesn't, it's like not financially feasible to do so because you're actually paying 80 cents. But if you use Solana it could be a fraction of a cent to confirm that transaction. And so microtransactions actually make sense that can't exist in the current world. So stuff like that, that seems like low hanging fruit that really could draw people I think needs to be iterated on more.
00:36:07.605 - 00:36:18.989, Speaker B: But yeah, the kind of building for whales and the current users that exist is very seductive. So it makes sense I guess why people are doing it.
00:36:19.117 - 00:37:36.701, Speaker A: Yeah, I think a lot of those use cases would like people would be, it would be much easier to do them if like Stripe for example had more clear guidance on if they could. And the problem as well is Stripe is a good example where Stripe has like an incredible business and they make a ton of money. They do very well at what they do. There's a lot of what Stripe does that would be done really well on Solana for example. But Stripe has to now make this trade off of putting their, putting their company at risk in order to make this step because they're not sure if. And also justifying the investment and just the shift in priorities and focus to moving a lot of their internal balances to Solana or a lot of their, you know, country to country payments to on Solana. They have to justify this with an unclear, you know, regulatory environment.
00:37:36.701 - 00:37:48.145, Speaker A: And that's like, that's just one example of why I think we'd be making a lot more progress if that was made clear.
00:37:50.245 - 00:38:38.045, Speaker B: So I think we've, I think we've covered this pretty substantively. If you want to, we'll link the tweets. The tweet in the show notes there were some interesting kind of responses to it as well. But if you're in the, you know, crypto world, the Solana world, I think it's worth giving the Tweet A read. McBrennan raises some interesting points in it. I want to transition a little bit to just chatting about margin fi because it's been a bit since you've been on the pod and want to make use of the time to just get a little bit of an update from your end on where things stand. So maybe one of the most significant margin fi events in recent times was there was kind of this shake up back in April where your CEO resigned.
00:38:38.045 - 00:38:57.521, Speaker B: A lot of TVL flowed out to other borrow lend platforms, things like that. So in the five months, yeah, five months since April, I want to just sort of like get a temp check, a vibe check on how things are going now and what it's been like.
00:38:57.553 - 00:40:16.441, Speaker A: Sort of picking up the pieces after that chaotic episode. Yeah, yeah, no, back in April, yeah, my co founder very publicly left and it was just in a way that spooked the market and you know, it wasn't in, it wasn't in the best way. People, people were upset. People reacted also like trust and trust matters a lot in defi and yeah, there's just a lot of, a lot of things that the market was not, the market was not happy with in, in the way that, that he left and then, yeah, like, you know, that, that sort of put us in this like sort of immediate hole that we had to dig out of and credit to the team. Like the team stuck together. There's a lot of very tangible moves we made. One, our team was far too small at that, at that point we were about, we were about six or seven or eight people and you know, margin fi had over a billion dollars of tvl.
00:40:16.441 - 00:41:13.291, Speaker A: And since that time I've doubled our team in terms of headcount. There's more focus I wanted to put into our risk systems, into new protocol development, into new application development. And we were, we were just severely understaffed. And that was like a tangible move that needed to be made. Another move that needs to be made was our Oracle systems were not like they, they worked. We withstood the greatest stress test a lending protocol, a lending protocol on Solana has ever withstood, which is that we facilitated $300 million of withdrawals in a 24 hour period during peak Salon congestion when transactions like you couldn't make a swap on Jupiter like it was very hard. It was the worst salon of congestion.
00:41:13.291 - 00:41:38.599, Speaker A: It was like a de facto outage. Our liquidators processed things smoothly. You know, users were able to withdraw. Protocol was completely solvent. One really interesting thing about Margin FI as well, something very unique to Margin Fi's design is there are no withdrawal limits. So like if this happened on another protocol a lot of people would have been stopped out of like $5 million. Like once we hit $5 million.
00:41:38.599 - 00:42:22.299, Speaker A: No, we facilitated $300 million in a 24 hour period. So very happy with that. That's like very credit credit due to the team. But our Oracle systems were in a tough spot following that. We need to make some huge structural foundational changes to that, many of which are like we're still iterating on today. There's some final actually today or this week we put out a message for all the teams integrating on Margin FI and building on Margin FI of some of the Oracle adjustments where we're finally wrapping up. And this has taken a lot of our team's focus.
00:42:22.299 - 00:43:55.897, Speaker A: Like our focus is always on user safety, protocol solvency and our risk systems. And we have the most stress tested lending protocol to stand for that. And I'm happy for that. But there was a lot of work we still need to put into that. And so yeah, over the last couple months I've been you know, hiring, building out our team, shaping the foundation of our protocol and also just reestablishing trust with people who were upset with it with just you know, the way my co founder left never and all the things that happened on that day and you know, it's been hard work. Like I've, I, it's been you know, 16 hour days since that moment and it's been a lot of coordinating with users and investors and stakeholders and you know, the fantastic, you know again, 25 plus teams that are building on Margin Fi and that's just taken a lot of time and focus and effort and we're through the bulk of it now and I'm very happy with that and, and like protocol usage has stabilized and yeah there's now like a lot of really exciting things in front of us. So with Margin FI in particular, a lot of people just view us as this vanilla lending protocol and that is wrong.
00:43:55.897 - 00:44:28.165, Speaker A: Lending is the foundation that we put in place. Lending is not the final destination in any means. And so over these next few months we're going to be putting out some new features that start to like redefine like chapter two of Margin Fi. And these features will be completely net new to crypto. You know, a lending protocol is not net new to crypto. Right. Like that existed on Ethereum.
00:44:28.165 - 00:44:52.161, Speaker A: That's been done before. What we're tackling next is completely net new. It's foundational, it's very multiplicative to teams deciding to build on us and work with us and that is something we're super excited about. So really just a testament to our team and it's been a lot of hard work, but we're turning the corner and I'm happy for that.
00:44:52.353 - 00:45:16.385, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, and congratulations on sort of coming through that rough patch. I'm curious to hear, you know, as a founder, I would imagine you have a day where you know, co founder suddenly resigns in a very public way. Hundreds of millions in with withdrawals. I guess there's probably like a million things that you suddenly feel like you need to do as a founder.
00:45:17.005 - 00:45:17.453, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:45:17.509 - 00:45:40.495, Speaker B: You know, engage on social media, you know, shore up the platform like you said, focus on increasing headcount, assuaging investors, all these things. So I guess I'm just curious, what did you find to be the most important thing to do like as a founder when you have that real like once in a couple years, rock bottom kind of day, what proved to be really important?
00:45:40.995 - 00:47:07.067, Speaker A: Yeah, the number one thing for me was my team was talking to the team, working with the team being completely aligned with the team's needs and the team being aligned with the protocol's needs and like the immediate future of the protocol. We have like a world class team at margin, one of the highest impact teams across Salon ID 5. Like our contribution footprint runs extremely deep and we've done a lot, not just for Margin five, but for, for, for the space at large. And yeah, I just think doubling down on the team because the team is what's enabled us, the team is what has enabled Margin Fight to be the fastest growing defi app in crypto in 2023. You know, the team is what allowed us to like move at this pace. Like a lot of people forget Margin FI is still one of like the youngest D5 protocols on Solana. Margin 5E2 is like launched last year and in 2023 and the amount that we've accomplished in that time, the things that we've been able to do that, that I'm super, super happy about.
00:47:07.067 - 00:48:43.423, Speaker A: So I, yeah, you know, if I, if I did it again, hopefully not, I would, yeah, I would just focus in on the team and then, and then what's, what's, what's awesome as well is we've had, you know, an awesome group of investors, like, particularly multicoin Pantera and Solana Ventures have been phenomenal partners and, you know, they deserve to be credited and I'm very happy to be working with them. So, you know, those two things, those two things, you know, are more direct and I'm happy about. And then, like, we have a ton of power users, a ton of people driving, like, unique benefit from margin Fi. And there's a lot of users where we still haven't captured and a lot of users that we want to serve. And so, like, my focus moving forward is on, you know, building for these immediate users, building for these future users, and just doing everything I can, you know, getting, like, working through the operational, you know, hurdles that's been in front of us and getting to a point where I can be, yeah, I can just give users an awesome product, so. And our team can give users an awesome product. So that's like the work in front of us.
00:48:43.423 - 00:48:44.115, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:48:45.055 - 00:49:05.085, Speaker B: So I guess I want to take these last few minutes here, McBrennan. You know, we've given a lot of airtime to maybe some of the challenges facing crypto. I just want to ask you what makes you optimistic as you look out at the crypto landscape, the Solana world, what you're building at margin fi, what are you really optimistic about these days?
00:49:05.585 - 00:50:32.635, Speaker A: Yeah, well, let's take margin fi as an example. Right now, anyone in the world with simply an Internet connection can hold tokenized dollars and earn 15%, 20%, 10% over collateralized open source code, verified transparency, current yields on that, that is the first time. And they can do it for a penny in transaction costs that's never before existed. If we zoom out in the span of human history that's just fundamentally powerful people are no longer entrapped by the currency of their local country or their country that they're in. They're no longer entrapped by all these rules and barriers to getting access to things they want. And they can do it permissionlessly and without needing to produce a credit score or a KYC document or any of that. So, like, just going back to the basics, that's super, super cool.
00:50:32.635 - 00:51:03.707, Speaker A: And in reality, like, there's a ton of people, like, think of how much of the world is using like just traditional checking account, checking accounts, savings accounts. They're getting ripped off. They wouldn't be on margin fi. They'd be getting a better yield. They wouldn't have limits on when they could withdraw or send to other people, they wouldn't have the fees that they have to pay. Yeah, everything would be programmatic. And so I'm super optimistic about simple stuff like that.
00:51:03.707 - 00:51:37.005, Speaker A: Obviously, like, because that's a massive enabler. Margin FI just in its current current structure and its future structure as well, remains a place where people can get passive yield as well. So you don't need to be a sophisticated market participant, you don't need to be a market maker to use Margin fi. It's just over collateralized lending. So that's super cool. I remain very optimistic. There's a reason I'm excited about the foundation Margin FI is now put in place.
00:51:37.005 - 00:53:15.525, Speaker A: And then yeah, I think a lot of this like just is very applicable to other use cases within crypto where like I'm excited when more like physical stuff gets tokenized and people get permissionless access to it. Yeah, I'm excited about that tokenized stuff being more ownership driven and having ownership rights and people having upside in sort of like this just the growth of the world and like the commercial things across the world and like the public things across the world. And you know, I also, I'm still very pro America and I'd like to see the US Stablecoin like be used more and more across countries that are left with like really poor native currency options like that. That's super powerful and that is happening. And then I'd love to see people put those stable coins to work in like margin fine, for example. So zooming out and going back to the basics like this censorship resistant, decentralized, permissionless network enabling things that are decentralized, permissionless, transparent, that's super cool. And so anything that leverages those inherent qualities of crypto to users benefit and to the private enterprises benefit or the public goods benefit or whatever is super exciting to me.
00:53:16.025 - 00:53:47.771, Speaker B: Absolutely. Yeah. I honestly McBrannon think that's a good note to leave things on, a note of optimism to send us out of here. But it's been a lot of fun having you on and honestly thank you for just your candor. I think listeners will be really well served to hear some of the more kind of unfiltered takes you have to offer. Best of luck going founder mode, continuing to build margin and some of these features you've mentioned coming up. I'll certainly be excited to follow and have you on the podcast again in the future.
00:53:47.771 - 00:53:49.323, Speaker B: Thanks so much for joining, man.
00:53:49.499 - 00:53:51.225, Speaker A: Thanks. Thanks for having me.
