Get your soul, stake it with Jito, and get instant access to liquidity through their liquid staking token. Jito soul get started today at Jeeto Network slash staking. What's up, everyone? Welcome to another episode of Lightspeed. Today we have Keoni and Kevin from Monad. Kiona used to be at Jump Trading, where he led the high frequency trading team.
00:00:29.174 - 00:00:56.922, Speaker A: And Kevin was a core protocol dev at Salana Labs. Guys, I want to start with in 2021 was the year of the L One trade. You had Salana Phantom near Avalanche and others. And in 2022, that meta switched to what you had people called next gen chains like Aptos and Sui who are leveraging the Move programming language, really getting away from the EVM. And then now in 2023, everyone's just launching an L2. Monad is doing the exact opposite. Not only are you launching an L One, but you're leveraging the EVM.
00:00:56.922 - 00:01:02.506, Speaker A: So the question is, are you geniuses? Are you crazy? But I think to start, what is Monad at a high level?
00:01:02.548 - 00:01:53.070, Speaker B: What is the thesis behind it? Sure thing. Monad is a new EVM layer one with full bytecode EVM compatibility that brings Pipelining and parallelization to the Ethereum virtual machine. We have a number of different optimizations at different levels of the stack that ultimately deliver super high performance while preserving backward compatibility for the Ethereum virtual machine. And our team has been working on Monad for about 18 months now. Originally, a good number of members of our team come from high frequency trading backgrounds, as well as backgrounds in kernel development and just more general high performance system building in the technology sector.
00:01:55.670 - 00:02:03.090, Speaker C: When you say Pipelining, I just want to be cognizant that maybe some audience might not know what that is. Can you explain what Pipelining is?
00:02:03.240 - 00:02:19.500, Speaker B: Sure thing. Pipelining is the practice of utilizing all of the resources in the system efficiently by introducing stages of work and then scheduling that work intelligently so that we can maximize all the resources of the system.
00:02:21.390 - 00:02:50.850, Speaker C: Cool. One thing that I'm interested about here is you said that with backwards compatibility, which is a very interesting concept, because you're also making the EVM parallel, which it's not right now. Can you talk a bit more about exactly what that means? How exactly will the backwards compatibility work? Will existing EVM applications be able to use Monad or Monad right away? What does that look like?
00:02:51.000 - 00:03:50.582, Speaker B: Sure thing. Monad is a blockchain that, in terms of the interface to users as well as the interface to other infrastructure like MetaMask or Etherscan, really looks like pretty similar on the outside. It's really just the optimizations internally that allow the Monad blockchain to execute transactions and maintain shared global state at a much higher rate. Let's talk about the backward compatibility for a second. So blocks in Monad are still linear. Transactions within those blocks are still linear. And it's just at the time of execution, the individual nodes have a bunch of strategic parallelization to execute that list of transactions in a more efficient way while still arriving at the end state as if the transactions have just been executed one after the other.
00:03:50.636 - 00:04:15.310, Speaker D: Yeah. So the EVM today is like single threaded, right? And so the very simple strategic thing is just use the 40 years of computer science that people have figured out to make things multicore and run an EVM on all the cores that you can that are free. And so that's the general idea is just like, you can run a bunch of EVMs in parallel and then do like, a state sync at the end before you commit to the block.
00:04:15.810 - 00:04:28.660, Speaker A: Yeah. Kevin on that, I know you were at Solana Labs, and probably what Solana first got famous for was parallel execution. Why is it that parallel execution hasn't been brought to the EVM yet? Like, is there some breakthrough that you're working on at Monad or yeah, what's the secret there?
00:04:29.670 - 00:05:03.690, Speaker D: I think it's just like a hard engineering problem. Right. And I don't know. I don't know. The thing that got me interested in Monad is because it's such an obvious win problem. You propose like, a parallel EVM and it's like, okay, why has no one done this before? And so when I found Monad, I got really excited. I was like, oh, wow, this is like do like, the classical hardware optimization and like, yeah, the EVM prices, constraints on what we can do to stay backwards compatible.
00:05:03.690 - 00:05:43.354, Speaker D: But there's a lot you can do besides that. And so just the expertise of James and Keoni and all their years know, building high fidelity systems, they essentially figured it out. Right. So at a high level, it's like an STM based approach. But essentially what it means is you can execute a bunch of things in parallel and then do an analysis at the end, make sure that if you would have executed them in serial, it would come out the same way and then essentially order them that way before you commit them. And then if there's any conflicts, you only have to ever execute things one more time. It's just the way that the algorithm works.
00:05:43.354 - 00:05:52.582, Speaker D: You're always making forward progress. So in a system like Solana, yeah, you can do it the most optimized way, but it's kind of at the expense of devex.
00:05:52.646 - 00:05:52.874, Speaker B: Right.
00:05:52.912 - 00:06:01.786, Speaker D: Because the front end, you have to declare all your dependencies up front. And so Monad kind of brings this in the best possible way that you could do it to the EVM.
00:06:01.898 - 00:06:39.820, Speaker C: One thing I'm interested in, Keoni, is that on the Ethereum website, they talk about the blockchain trilemma, which is the idea that you have this pyramid or triangle of performance, security, and decentralization. And you must pick two. You can't have all three. And the only way to actually have three is to do it via L, two S and fractal scale or not fractal scaling, but just scaling via roll ups. And people who believe this are called or said to be Ethereum aligned. And the ones who don't are not so aligned. So it seems like you guys maybe aren't aligned there.
00:06:39.820 - 00:06:53.520, Speaker C: What are your thoughts on the trilemma? Do you think? Monad or yes, monad. Does it solve it well? Do you think or how do you guys think about just scalability in general?
00:06:54.050 - 00:08:07.634, Speaker B: Yeah, I didn't realize it was on the website. I know that Vitalik has written about this notion of a trilemma in the past. I think at the end of the day there are these different axes on which one could grade a given blockchain system and they're all really important considerations. I think of it as like if there are these three axes then you have an efficient frontier which is like a surface in this three dimensional space that maybe is like the efficient frontier that we know of right now. Based on the systems that we have, it's still possible to make algorithmic improvements to deliver more scalability without sacrificing decentralization at all or more decentralization without sacrificing scalability at all. But those improvements just they require rearchitecting potentially large parts of the system in order to achieve those. I think that from what I've seen the community has backed away a little bit from the notion of a very hard trilemma or an absolutist.
00:08:07.634 - 00:09:13.274, Speaker B: Like there is never any way that we can improve on one of these axes without sacrificing on the other ones. I think that that's more maybe like rhetoric from a couple of years ago or like how people interpret it. But from everything that I've seen in my interactions with researchers in the Ethereum space people acknowledge that there is opportunities to improve Ethereum in all different directions. And there's a lot of active research that's going on in different directions that ultimately are promising and that have the potential to help Ethereum and more generally the crypto space scale to many more users than it does right now. Because at the end of the day that's what's really important is how do you support an application that has say, 10 million daily active users where each user is transacting 100 times a day? Because that's a billion transactions per day. That's 10,000 transactions per second. How are we going to support that? That's what ultimately matters.
00:09:13.274 - 00:10:16.834, Speaker B: If you think about the scale of Twitter or the scale of WeChat or the scale of Visa or the scale of Nasdaq these are systems that have billions of transactions per day. So we're not at a level of adoption in the crypto space where those stresses at that scale are evident. But that's also because Ethereum processes about a million transactions per day on its own and then all the roll ups combined are another couple of million transactions per day. So the systems right now are kind of limiting the scale to which any application could actually achieve product market fit and grow its user base. And a lot of efforts that are going on in the space right now are efforts to try to push that forward. They're just in different directions that actually have potentially a lot of overlap as well. The roll up efforts that are going on, they're very orthogonal to the efforts that Monad is doing.
00:10:16.834 - 00:11:19.154, Speaker B: Monad is super focused on making execution really performant, and roll ups are really focused on moving computation off of the main chain into a separate chain and then having commitments back to the main chain that Memorialize state commit a state route, commit sufficient data so that that state route can be proven either through a fraud proof or validity proof. And they're actually, at the end of the day, those technologies are completely orthogonal and could perhaps even be combined to make roll up nodes more performance. So I think at the end of the day, there's just different directions that are going on in parallel that can all help improve the space. And yeah, I think that the modern view of the Trilemma is not that it's like a hard trade off, but more that it's like where we are right now, but that additional research improvements can help move us upward and to the right in terms of this trade off curve.
00:11:19.282 - 00:12:50.450, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I guess the first thing I would say is we're at SPC right now, very Academia Forward conference. And Dank Red gave a talk yesterday. The thing that struck me immediately, he showed the scalability trilema and he goes, this is where we were years ago, we moved past this. And so I think the Ethereum community, at least on the research side, is very aware that you can make optimizations and preserve these things. And I think at least on the decentralization front, the way I think about it is like, okay, if we have a certain amount of bandwidth coming into our internet and we're not using that all because we only have a single threaded system, fundamentally you're kind of just like wasting the extra electricity. Like you're paying for some amount whether you're at home, internet or service provider or whatever, right? And so if you can scale your system up to the limit of bandwidth, your decentralization is just whatever an individual operator wants to put through their node, right? And so if we're not limited by how much bandwidth we can consume, it kind of becomes a thing, is like, okay, pick how much bandwidth you want to consume and anyone can participate in the network, right, and you're not all of a sudden limited to what node you're running. It's more of like, I'm already paying this much for internet, how much do I want to give it to my node? And then let's just make sure that's used most efficiently and so, yeah, the whole decentralization thing, I think, is just very nuanced.
00:12:50.450 - 00:13:29.022, Speaker D: There's a lot of different ways you can look at the problem. There's, like, Nakamoto coefficient, like geographic distribution where your nodes are being run as far as data center wise or on bare metal or at home. And so when anyone kind of drills down on one, it becomes like a more nuanced conversation. Where I'm looking at it with Monad is just like, look, fundamentally we build a system that will scale up to the limit of the bandwidth you're willing to feed it. You can choose your level of decentralization as a node runner, right? And then you're just like using your compute and your I O resources as efficiently as possible.
00:13:29.156 - 00:13:33.598, Speaker A: The one thing that I think would be really interesting is to introduce the audience to remote execution attacks, if you.
00:13:33.604 - 00:13:34.606, Speaker D: Could add to that.
00:13:34.628 - 00:13:41.060, Speaker A: Because I think, security wise, a lot of people just think about what's the economic value staked on a chain? And I think, yeah, if you have a really interesting take on that.
00:13:43.190 - 00:14:25.394, Speaker D: My take on it is like economic security matters up to the point where until it's cheaper to bribe a dev to put a bug in some client, right? If you could just bribe someone with a billion dollars to sneak a bug into a client, then they can execute on that bug and essentially steal all the stake. And so at a certain level, I don't know, it's a pretty objective level, right? But economic security only goes up to the level to where if it's $100 billion, it's like a nation state actor really wanted to attack the chain. It's a lot cheaper to get one of their people hired at a client company and put a bug in the code.
00:14:25.592 - 00:14:34.820, Speaker C: Just the reality. It would have to go through code review and audits from other validators and whatnot as well, though, right?
00:14:35.130 - 00:14:49.158, Speaker D: Yeah. But I think, given Bright incentive, I think it would be cheaper than $100 billion. That's kind of where I'm at with it.
00:14:49.244 - 00:15:42.700, Speaker B: Yeah. I actually have a different view on this, which is that I think at the end of the day, there's the social layer of consensus that ultimately, if it were very obvious that someone had sneaked a bug in, there is ultimately that social layer which could get invoked and make a decision about a hard fork. Like, at the end of the day, blockchains are hard forking all the time. Anytime there's a major upgrade. So I think that that's ultimately the last line of defense. And that also serves as a deterrent because it wouldn't be worth it to bribe someone to do that, knowing that it would ultimately end up getting rolled back anyway. You would have a double spend problem in that case as the briber, where you would pay the person the bribe but then not actually get the result that you wanted.
00:15:42.700 - 00:16:51.166, Speaker B: Ultimately, I think that that's one of the powerful things about blockchain is that because it's really just shared global state with consensus among all of these participants, that causes there to be value, causes it to be a useful system that's keeping track of a whole bunch of state, that powers a whole bunch of applications. Because that's all driven by the fact that we just agree about what the balances are. We agree that this code base and this list of transactions replayed that's the current state. So I think social consensus is like it's talked about a lot in the research community, but that's ultimately the backstop. And then same thing for 51% attack or 66.7% attack, whatever it is, depending on the particular consensus mechanism and threshold for supermajority. At the end of the day, if an attacker were to go attack a proof of stake chain by accumulating 51% or two thirds of the stake, they would accumulate it.
00:16:51.166 - 00:17:21.350, Speaker B: They'd spend a lot of time buying whatever that token is, and then it would just get slashed and under social consensus. So it'd actually be very good for all the people that didn't participate in that attack because the supply of the token would be massively reduced. So I think that there's a lot of reasons for proof of stake networks to see them as having a lot of security. And part of that is the economic cost of mounting an attack. And then part of it is social consensus that underlies everything.
00:17:21.500 - 00:17:35.710, Speaker C: There is this common notion, and you guys have already touched on this a bit, but I just want to make it very obvious for anyone listening. There is this notion that to get a faster blockchain without sacrificing decentralization.
00:17:38.130 - 00:17:38.446, Speaker B: To.
00:17:38.468 - 00:18:15.610, Speaker C: Get a faster blockchain, you need to increase hardware requirements. And that presumably means you lessen decentralization, which, by the way, I don't believe it's true, but that's a common stance. Assuming you guys actually achieve this performance in production with reasonable node requirements, then shouldn't maybe the Ethereum community think a bit more about adopting some of your tech for Ethereum itself and just adopts more of a monad centric scaling roadmap in some regards, as opposed to relying purely on altus?
00:18:16.910 - 00:19:51.594, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's actually, I'm glad that you asked that, because it allows me to sort of take a step back and try to describe at a high level some of the major changes that are coming in. Monad monad ultimately is delivering Pipelining to the Ethereum virtual machine in four major areas. I'll just mention those four areas really quickly and then let you guys ask about them if you're curious about any of them. So four areas are state access, pipelining, transaction execution, pipelining, pipelining between consensus and execution, and then Pipelining within the consensus mechanism itself. And when you stack all of these improvements together and like I said, Pipelining is the practice of building up these stages of work and then executing stages basically in parallel for different streams of work that are going on, basically taking all of these pipelining optimizations together. That's what ultimately allows Monad to process transactions super efficiently and take advantage of all of the resources on the machine. But I think that's the super high level answer to your question of how is it that without significantly changing the hardware requirements from the Ethereum hardware spec, monad is able to achieve this? And the answer is these different algorithmic improvements that are enabling Pipelining in these.
00:19:51.632 - 00:20:07.658, Speaker D: Different areas, essentially like node chips today that don't have multicores on them. So you couldn't even run an Ethereum node on a single core machine. They don't exist. Right. And so Pipelining is just like, okay, let's just fully utilize every inch of the hardware.
00:20:07.754 - 00:20:08.400, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:08.770 - 00:20:47.750, Speaker D: And you can essentially stack. The way Monad is designed is where it's honestly kind of similar to Solana, in which quartering and execution are separated. And what happens in Monad is because of this separation in different ways, you can do them on different threads. And so you might be coming to ordering on one block and then also executing on the other block, and it might be one block apart, but they're on top of each other. And so it's called Pipelining because once the pipe gets full on the system, you can imagine having a bunch of these stages stacked on top of each other, executing in parallel.
00:20:47.910 - 00:20:53.142, Speaker A: Kevin, is that hot stuff that Monad is using, that modified Tendermint?
00:20:53.286 - 00:20:59.082, Speaker B: Correct? Yeah, we use Hot stuff, I guess, modified hot stuff as our consensus mechanism.
00:20:59.226 - 00:21:09.540, Speaker A: Okay, so with that, when you're a Cosmos chain, you can only have about 100 validators, I think, because of communication overhead. How does Monad get around that? Or what is the optimal validator set anyways, that you're going for?
00:21:10.550 - 00:22:04.580, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think there might be some stuff that's confusing because originally our plan was to use Tendermint, which then would have inherited that sort of constraint on the validator set due to the all to all communication aspect of Tendermint. However, as of about six months or so ago, we've actually switched to this modified hot stuff. So unlike the Cosmos chains, monad does not have this sort of upper limit on number of validators. With that said, we do think that the initial version of Monad that goes public probably will have on the order of 150 validators, but has a potential to grow as time goes on and as further improvements are made.
00:22:05.510 - 00:22:40.910, Speaker A: Yeah, monad has I think it's single slot finality and also which in Salana, you could say that in an optimistic way as well. But it takes 32 confirmations to actually have a block be confirmed. So you have single slot finality, and then it's 1 second block time. What is the major bottleneck for Monad and being able to scale? Because I think right now on the website, you say it can go up to 10,000 TPS, but in the future you're hoping to hit like the theoretical limit of 400,000. I think right now with the ethereum roadmap, even with potentially dank sharding or protodank sharding that still only scales into the couple hundreds of TPS. So what is the bottleneck for Monad?
00:22:41.490 - 00:23:37.602, Speaker B: There are two bottlenecks for Monad. One is on the bandwidth side. So basically, as Kevin was mentioning earlier, just the spec to which the minimum bandwidth requirement for nodes, the expectation for this requirement is 100 megabits up down. So we think that that's a reasonable kind of like middle ground relative to other blockchains in the space. But that is one of the bottlenecks and then the other bottleneck is execution. And the extent to which Monad is able to efficiently parallelize work and efficiently parallelize disk reads and writes so that we can execute as many transactions as possible. And it's pretty nice.
00:23:37.602 - 00:24:01.980, Speaker B: But these two separate components are both kind of pushed up at their limit. And due to the separation of consensus and execution, which Kevin and I are both mentioning before both consensus, the process and execution the process, are able to be pushed up against their limits because they're running in parallel, executing separate stages of work at the same time.
00:24:04.910 - 00:24:51.930, Speaker C: One thing I'm curious about is so Solana is maybe the most directly comparable blockchain right now in terms of parallelization and pipelining and being able to squeeze performance out of hardware. So Solana's design philosophy is essentially a blockchain's. Superpower is globally shared single state that syncs at speed of light, essentially. How do you guys think Q and E, what is your design philosophy for what you want Monad to be? Are you a massive believer in the single shared global state thesis? Do you want Monad to be used mostly for order books, DeFi trading? What is your philosophy? What is the vision for the chain?
00:24:52.670 - 00:26:14.414, Speaker B: The philosophy is to enable shared global state that maximizes the resources that are available, so maximizes this bandwidth that nodes have made available as well as the processing power of those nodes. I think there's different efforts that are going on in the crypto space to scale blockchains, scale decentralized apps in different ways. I think the roll up idea, like I said, is orthogonal to the effort to make execution really performant and there are potentially merits to that as well. But we're just solving a very fundamental problem that we perceive in the space, which is that a single blockchain, like a single unit of shared global state needs to be a lot more dense. It needs to be able to process a lot more transactions on its own. And then once we get there, then we could talk about sort of introducing either horizontal scaling in the form of subnets or supernets or whatever you want to call them, or in terms of vertical scaling with roll ups and so on. Each one of those units needs to be a lot more performant in order to ultimately deliver the scale that's needed to support mass user adoption.
00:26:14.542 - 00:26:43.686, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. Quick break to tell you about Jito. Jito is the number one liquid staking provider in Solana.

I'll put a link in the show notes. Use the link so they know that I've sent you, and go get started today. Everyone, we'll get back to the show in a minute, but I want to let you know that we got our permissionless conference coming up. This is our conference of bankless.
00:27:28.194 - 00:27:47.362, Speaker A: That is the biggest and best conference in DeFi. It's going to be in Austin, Texas, this year. Yes, I know you love it. They got Tacos Barbecue Barn Springs. We got it all September 11 through the 13th. If you've been in crypto for a while, know that the bear market conferences are the best conferences, because those are the ones where all the outfits had the people that are still in crypto all really want to be there. It's going to be great for building a network, for learning a lot.
00:27:47.362 - 00:28:14.650, Speaker A: And look, we've got a phenomenal lineup of speakers that include people like Hasu Stani, Christine Moy and Kyle Simani talking about ZK Tech roll ups, account abstraction, mev app chains and more. Look, I'm damn excited because you're a listener of Lightspeed. You're going to get a special discount. Type in discount code Lightspeed 30, and you'll get 30% off your ticket. That's right. Just type in Lightspeed 30 when buying a permissionless ticket and get 30% off. Click the link at the bottom of this episode and go get it now because prices are going up every two weeks.
00:28:14.650 - 00:28:36.740, Speaker A: All right, back to the show. So two follow ups on that. Why choose the EVM? Obviously, the EVM probably has the best product market fit in Crypto, but we are early. And also a lot of people talk about how it is similar to JavaScript and that it's not optimized. And I think that's the goal that you're going for. So why the EVM? And also why not an L2? Why not make Monad an L two?
00:28:37.990 - 00:29:49.974, Speaker B: I think you have to start somewhere. Like you have to be focused and it's pretty clear that EVM is dominant standard for most smart contract developers right now. So just makes sense to support these developers who are working right now to build impactful apps. And yeah, it's just the straightest line to helping decentralized apps scale overall. So that's why Monad is super focused on EVM execution as opposed to WASM or some other runtime in terms of the question about L two S. Monad is designed to maximize performance and minimize costs and also deliver a really high degree of decentralization. And with the current architecture of roll ups, we didn't feel that we would be able to accomplish those goals as an L2, I would also just add that our team's expertise is just high performance execution.
00:29:49.974 - 00:30:34.498, Speaker B: It's building trading machines that can take hundreds of millions of packets a day and very quickly within single digit microseconds respond and send orders back to the exchange. That's our skill. And I think with any team you should do what you're really good at and then figure out how to integrate with other builders in the space who are maybe building orthogonal components. So we're not really UX people right now. We don't have expertise on really optimizing, delivering really clean, crisp user interfaces. But it's great that other people in the space are really focusing on that. And yeah, I just think that it's an argument of specialization.
00:30:34.498 - 00:30:42.202, Speaker B: We feel like execution is where we should focus and where we can really make an impact on the space.
00:30:42.336 - 00:31:32.380, Speaker D: I'm more bullish on interoperability solutions than I have been previously. Essentially talking to a bunch of researchers here and I think the difference between an L one and an L two at some point will get solved. I was talking to a guy yesterday who figured out how to do 1 second proving times for a ZK interoperability layer. And so you can have these. I do believe we're going to have these properties of essentially trustless shared state between essentially it could be a layer two, it could be a layer one. It doesn't really matter, right? And so when we're building a highly optimized system, I think it just makes more sense to build the highly optimized system and then let the smart people working in all the cryptography build the interoperability layers for us.
00:31:33.070 - 00:32:15.350, Speaker C: Well, we have talked a lot about the technical facets of blockchain so far, but of course blockchains are a little more multifaceted than that. There's the economic considerations, the social considerations. One thing I've been super impressed by, maybe the most impressed by actually so far with Monad is kind of the social layer and the community. I know you guys have like a telegram chat where when you enter, it's like a tailored message for you and whatnot. It's pretty you Keoni, how do you think about the community and the social layer of blockchains? How crucial do you think it is to cultivate that community, to do the kind of the evangelizing for you and maybe a shared set of values?
00:32:15.850 - 00:33:14.630, Speaker B: I think it's everything, honestly. I think that it just goes back to the roots of shared global state. Like I said before, the concept of shared global state is literally that we all have our own computers, but those computers have all of the same smart contracts with all the same individual states inside of them. And they're in agreement. That's what's, like, you know, if I go and change the values of my computer and then Kevin goes and changes the ones in his now we don't have shared global state anymore. And then the whole premise of decentralized applications that are not maintained by any centralized authority, that are only following the rules of the system, the code is written, all of that goes away. So I think that it's like this analogy that I give people whenever I meet someone who doesn't know anything about crypto.
00:33:14.630 - 00:33:47.906, Speaker B: I just tell them, imagine kids in a playground that just come up with a point system. And so we all start with 100 points. Like, Garrett has 100 points, Kevin has 100 points, mert Keoni, everyone has 100 points. We just have this dictionary in our heads each that says Garrett maps to 100, Kevin maps to 100, et cetera. And then we just start doing stuff. I challenge Kevin to go across the monkey bars for five points, and he does it. And then I just announced to everyone, like, okay, go decrement five points from Keoni's balance and add them to Kevin's.
00:33:47.906 - 00:34:59.846, Speaker B: Everyone does that. That's really all that blockchain is at a very simplified level. It's just agreement about these balances, and then eventually these points start to have real economic value in the real world because it's such a useful system of barter and a system of exchange that it starts to have meaningful value. But it all comes from the fact that we all agreed upon this schema and we all have agreement about what the state is. So that's my argument from a very technical perspective of why community is so important. But then also just thinking about the fact that we're building technology, but what other technology has such a passionate community? Maybe like Tesla, maybe like the SpaceX people. But even then, I feel like it's not at the level of crypto where know, hundreds of thousands to a couple million people on Twitter who are just incredibly passionate about the mission of advancing decentralized applications, decentralized computation.
00:34:59.846 - 00:35:57.790, Speaker B: That's really special. That's our superpower as an industry is the fact that so many people are passionate about this effort and this mission. They're passionate about the tech. They don't always agree about the specifics of how we're going to accomplish this mission. There's a lot of different efforts that are going on in parallel. But what a blessing to have people that are in this day and age and we all understand the attention economy and the value of just having people that care, that mind share that's so valuable. So I would just say with all of us at the Monad team, we really appreciate the crypto community in general and we feel really lucky and blessed to have people that believe in us and are supporting us and just asking us every day when testnet, when mainnet, it's because they want to try it out.
00:35:57.790 - 00:36:20.450, Speaker B: They're excited about the future and they can't wait for the future to get here. Yeah. Community is everything. No blockchain will be successful without acknowledging the importance of its community and ultimately delivering the goals that the community has in mind.
00:36:20.600 - 00:36:59.570, Speaker C: So to follow up on that, I just wanted to touch on maybe the last facet, which is economics, right? And maybe this is even kind of coupled with community in a sense, because when the price of the coin goes up, the community is doing well. When it goes down, maybe they get a little feisty. So there's maybe two schools of thought on tokenomics for an L. One. One is maybe the Ethereum school where it's like deflationary and you want to just drive value back to the token. And then there's maybe Salana, which is like you want to build a base layer that's valuable for businesses to build their stuff on top of it such that they have an incentive to support the chain. How does Monads think about this? What are your thoughts?
00:37:01.350 - 00:37:52.526, Speaker B: I think the fundamental thing is there has to be real value that's arriving to end users at the end of the day. The reason that I think about a bank analogy, you have a bank, they take deposits and they pay. You take your money to the bank, they give you some interest on your deposits and then the bank goes and loans it out to someone else at a higher rate. The bank makes the spread between the high rate and the low rate. You get the interest on your deposits and then the person who took out the loan gets money they can use for some productive endeavor. Everybody wins. Like everybody is gaining some economic benefit from the existence of this bank as opposed to not having such a thing exist.
00:37:52.526 - 00:38:26.062, Speaker B: And I think the same thing really has to be true with any business, is that you need to deliver value to your users. So in Ethereum, there's tons of gas fees that are being paid. I'll have to go back and look. But it's at least a billion dollars in gas fees that were paid over the past year. Probably two. I'll have to go back and look. But it's a huge amount of value that is being expended and that users are paying.
00:38:26.062 - 00:39:28.386, Speaker B: And the reason they're paying that is because they're getting more than that in exchange. Or at least they believe that they're getting more than that in exchange. They're minting NFTs and then they feel that the economic value of minting those NFTs and willing to pay this heightened gas fee during that period of time, it's because they're getting more than that much value back. So I guess what I'm trying to say is that these two visions that you mentioned aren't necessarily separate. They can both be true. If it's the case that the end users are ultimately getting enough value back, that all those gas fees that they're willing to pay is actually that amount that they're willing to pay is less than the amount of value that they're actually getting back. But it is really predicated on there being a lot of value useful applications that people are using.
00:39:28.386 - 00:40:20.946, Speaker B: So I guess the last thing that I'll say is with Monad. Our team's vision is that by offering a new environment where transactions are very plentiful and likely much cheaper than on Ethereum, we can enable a new mode of transactions like a new kind of transaction that's much lower value. On average, but just much more plentiful and then enable a lot of applications that ultimately deliver a lot of value to a lot of users. Same as trading on an exchange. Like millions of people trade on an exchange every day. And why do they come trade? It's because they're able to use that to invest in things that ultimately have value and other people are able to sell. And so everyone can win.
00:40:20.946 - 00:40:32.550, Speaker B: The exchange can win, the market makers can win and the investors can all win. It's just all resulting from actual things of value happening on the blockchain.
00:40:33.530 - 00:41:44.030, Speaker D: I think if I could jump and add like a double click on that we are EVM. So there's parts of the fee model we can't change, right? Or it's like dangerous for contracts, right? But that doesn't mean if you're very efficient about your resources essentially gas is just like metering compute and if we have way more compute available, it can just be metered at a way lower level and I think you'd be surprised how much lower that can be, right? Definitely like subscent, right? Just using the same gas model and just doing optimizations and actually discounting for accessing. Like I think it's a slightly different model than Solana where they want to charge priority fees to get in front of the block and we can do that too. But for I think the way at least that I've talked to James a little bit about that he's thinking about is if you hit a piece of state, you've already loaded it into memory, you've already brought it out and done the hard part. And so we can actually discount anyone else that hits that hotspot again based on you don't have to charge for the read bring up or anything like that.
00:41:44.100 - 00:41:44.574, Speaker B: Right?
00:41:44.692 - 00:41:56.690, Speaker D: And so there's a lot of gas optimizations you can do while maintaining the fee model of Ethereum to make sure it's 100% EVM compatible and just providing optimized compute resources.
00:41:58.150 - 00:42:08.486, Speaker A: How difficult would it be for Ethereum to implement these optimizations that you're making? Is this a simple client? I say simple, it's never simple. Is it a client level change or what would they have to do?
00:42:08.668 - 00:42:46.260, Speaker B: Yeah, it's never simple. I think a lot of the changes that Monad is introducing to theorem ecosystem are pretty involved in nature and therefore really just need to be proven out in a real live environment with a lot of real transactions and a lot at stake. But at the end of the day, everything is just software. So definitely possible that some of the improvements could be integrated into Ethereum. And honestly, I think it's something that a lot of us on our team are hopeful for as well. That Ethereum can ultimately adopt some of these changes.
00:42:47.750 - 00:43:14.138, Speaker D: Yeah, arguably the runtime is the most dangerous thing to touch in a live system because if you have a state transition that's not expected, all of a sudden the value profit of a blockchain is put into question. Right. So I don't fault Ethereum at all for being hesitant about making runtime changes and system holding that much value. So we kind of have this luxury to go and explore these things that you can't at that level.
00:43:14.224 - 00:43:39.538, Speaker C: I am curious just to understand maybe how you guys view the landscape of blockchains and crypto right now. So there is altel ones, right? Maybe aptos we say. And maybe Monad kind of is in this space as well. But then it's also maybe slightly in the Ven diagram with Ethereum as well, in a sense.
00:43:39.624 - 00:43:39.874, Speaker A: Right?
00:43:39.912 - 00:43:51.000, Speaker C: And then there's Bitcoin, there's L, two S, there's Salana, there's Cosmos, there's all these different things. How do you think this plays out and where do you think Monad comes in?
00:43:52.010 - 00:44:50.794, Speaker B: I personally think it's all about the applications that are ultimately built using one of these systems. I think that we're in a stage right now where there's just a lot of experimentation going on and we're ultimately trying to build the future rails for all financial settlement to happen. It's really inefficient right now. T plus two settlement for equities and huge spreads that banks take between the deposit rate that they're willing to give people yield on deposits and the rate at which they're loaning out. It's a huge amount of value extraction by middlemen and having decentralized, transparent and instantly settled financial Rails for all finance to be settled on is incredibly powerful. But we're not there yet. We're experimenting right now.
00:44:50.794 - 00:45:34.870, Speaker B: And then all of us that are crypto natives that are using DeFi every day, we're dog fooding. Like we're the initial users that are trying stuff out. But ultimately everyone is trying stuff out, trying to build things that ultimately can be that service for everyone. So when you ask about these different solutions, bitcoin, Cosmos, Aptos, et cetera, these are all just different underlying infrastructure on which it's like a blank canvas that people can build successful applications on. That's the only thing that really matters.
00:45:36.010 - 00:46:35.740, Speaker D: Take the slightly spicier take on this one. I think that you can't get around physics, right? And so all these blockchains are going to hit similar problems at some point. And I think you end up coming to a realm where the things celestial is doing with data ability layers and light clients are going to be needed. Like the things that we're doing with execution optimization are going to be needed. If you do fill up a base layer, you might need layer twos. If crypto as a whole is maximally successful, I think all these systems will converge just out of basic need, right? And so yeah, I think there's a lot of different ways to build these different scaling solutions. But at the end of the day, if we actually get to the level of scale that we want, I think you just end up not being able to get around physics at some point and have to put all these things together.
00:46:35.740 - 00:46:48.430, Speaker D: The nice thing about Ethereum that I've really enjoyed is there's such a rich and vibrant research community and so there's a lot you can lean on and kind of pull in from all these different areas.
00:46:49.330 - 00:47:02.130, Speaker A: I'm curious, when people come to you about the integrated versus modular debate, or some people say modular versus monolithic, what are your high level thoughts on that? And I think to have a direct question, why would, for example, Monad not use Celestia for DA?
00:47:05.930 - 00:47:47.650, Speaker D: I think the level of scaling up to the limited bandwidth we're going is, quite frankly, even more than Celestia. It's that thing about you should scale up to the limit of what your pipe is and then the user can choose what they want. So if they want to run a node from home, just maximize that bandwidth. But if you want to run a node on higher internet, go ahead and do that. And I think a lot of these systems, like DA systems, have a target of some amount of megabytes per second. And I think this is more about thinking about it, like, okay, well, we just need to maximize the resources. And sometimes that's not like a set limit, it's like whatever we can get to.
00:47:47.650 - 00:48:51.110, Speaker D: Right? And so, yeah, just like having the full stack solution allows you to essentially push the bounds of every part of the physics, right? And so, yeah, monograted versus monolithic versus integrated or modular or whatever, there's so many words these days. But the monolithic problem, it looks more like an embedded systems problem. So I'm just more interested in it as far as long term solutions go. I guess I think you end up getting even in maximally successful monolithic land. L two S are useful for certain things, right? Game developers may not want a fully globally state. They may want to have all their things on different interoperability publishing layers. Right? And so I think all these solutions essentially aim for different market segments, right? And different market segments are going to find these interesting for their use cases.
00:48:51.110 - 00:49:09.340, Speaker D: But we're just kind of taking an approach that the typical app dev is going to want to just build products. And if we can abstract and give them a full stack solution so that they don't have to worry about these infrastructure pieces, I think that's like a pretty strong value prop. Right.
00:49:10.030 - 00:49:49.690, Speaker C: Keoni, you've talked a lot about applications, and specifically, I think given your background, you've talked a good amount about financial and DeFi applications, which just seems like it's something you're more interested in. I have two questions for you. One, is that what verticals are you interested in in crypto other than DeFi and finance? What do you think Monad would be a good chain to build? What types of applications? And two, so obviously, maybe there's like, say, who's essentially picked the financial route for their blockchain. They want exchanges and whatnot built on their chain. Would Monad ever do something like that and be more like vertically focused?
00:49:52.350 - 00:51:00.720, Speaker B: Right? I think I'm super excited about high fidelity DeFi, like you said. But beyond that, I really think that identity is really important and powerful. I think that having achievements on chain, like things that you've done off chain that you could push on chain to be part of your passport, if you will, that's going to be really powerful in the coming years. I think that more people are embracing the idea of being anon or being pseudonymous and maybe even having multiple personalities, having multiple identities in this new expectation. It's not just your name and your resume and your LinkedIn and so on. It's like all the communities that you're part of and the NFTs you've collected and the achievements you've think of Steam achievements or think of Strava achievements. Like, you go on a run and you hit a 30 day run streak, you want to show that off.
00:51:00.720 - 00:51:54.260, Speaker B: I really think there's another powerful primitive here that hasn't really been explored or is starting to get explored with some of the new social apps like Fronttech. So I think that's another big area beyond that, definitely really excited about just like, growth of communities and the fact that NFTs, I know everyone's really down on yeah, they're feeling very low about NFTs right now because NFT prices have been really down all year. But I think NFTs do really build community in a really interesting way. And I feel like coming years, that's not going to go away. We're at a low point right now in terms of excitement about NFTs. There's so much more to come there as well.
00:51:55.030 - 00:52:01.186, Speaker A: Keoni for the muggles in the back, can you maybe explain real quickly high Fidelity Finance what that means?
00:52:01.368 - 00:53:17.350, Speaker B: Yeah, high Fidelity Finance means basically offering users same or better experience than they currently have in traditional finance. So in traditional finance, like trading liquid, things like trading S and P 500 ETFs or S and P 500 futures slippage is fractions of a basis point, like 0.3 basis points or less than that. That's the kind of experience that our team hopes will ultimately be achieved in decentralized finance. And the reason why we think Monad will be a significant contributor to that effort, obviously not the only contributor to that effort, but significant one is that Monad is enabling really low transaction fees which are ultimately needed in order for liquidity providers to update their prices frequently and keep their liquidity very close to fair value. So prices are constantly moving around. If you're not adjusting your quotes all the time, if you're not able to adjust your quotes all the time because gas fees are too high to do that, then your quotes are going to be typically stale and typically not in range.
00:53:17.350 - 00:54:07.930, Speaker B: And so then we end up as a crypto ecosystem designing for these different mechanisms like AMMS, where the liquidity is spread across a much wider range, in the extreme case over the entire price range from zero to infinity. And that just means that the liquidity is spread really thin. So then when someone does go to do a trade, they experience extreme slippage like 1% or 2%, which are very normal in D Five, but would be insane in traditional finance. In most liquid markets. Monad is helping to bridge that gap by making transaction fees a lot lower. So that in addition for the user who's making the swap, like the taker in addition to the taker paying much lower, gas fees on their actual trade. They're also interacting with liquidity that is much tighter because it was enabled by much cheaper gas fees on the maker side over all those different price updates.
00:54:07.930 - 00:55:20.610, Speaker B: Beyond that, another big aspect of High Fidelity DeFi is having really precise pricing. So Another Thing that We're Excited About in the Early Monad Ecosystem is high Fidelity Oracles that are Pushing very Frequent price updates from Off Chain, from Other Sources, pushing it back on chain so that we have very Precise pricing, which then can result in greater capital efficiency on all the downstream apps that are using Oracle pricing, such as lending protocols or derivatives protocols. That higher capital efficiency is manifested in the form of higher LTV ratios or just more generally allowing people to take on more leverage. We know that one of the reasons why Binance and Bybit and OKEx and some of these other centralized exchanges have gotten really successful is that they allow pretty high leverage on their trading. So it doesn't really exist in derivatives right now because there's this capital efficiency coming from the fact that the providers can't trust the Oracles very well because there's a lot of big fudge factor in the Oracle price. So having a much more precise Oracle price can then ultimately result in these downstream effects that ultimately lead to better capital efficiency, better user experience.
00:55:20.760 - 00:56:15.750, Speaker C: So Kioni, we've talked a lot about kind of the tech side of Monad, but maybe in startups in general, something that might be more important is kind of distribution and messaging and go to market. A lot of L one so far, like maybe Atos and Suite actually have pretty solid tech, but they haven't really gotten that much traction, which I think might be due to the fact that their messaging or distribution hasn't been that great. I mean, it's a bear market right now. What do you envision Monad's messaging will be like? Especially in this adversarial environment of crypto where I'm sure that people from Ethereum Alliance Communities might start saying, oh well, it's fast. The only way it must be fast is because hardware, whatever. How are you guys thinking about communicating Monad's vision to people, to developers who want to build the future of crypto?
00:56:17.450 - 00:56:58.610, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the first thing that I'd say is that when I try to imagine the Ethereum Ecosystem, I imagine this space and there's a couple of different verticals in it. There's optimistic roll ups are one vertical. Zero knowledge roll ups are another vertical. Data availability is another vertical. Shared sequencing, like new emerging vertical restaking, new vertical parallel execution is a new vertical for the Ethereum Ecosystem. So for us, our team is just really focused on enabling high performance execution and helping to move the space forward. They're always going to be doubters, they're always going to be haters.
00:56:58.610 - 00:58:21.018, Speaker B: But we have to just focus on our mission, focus on what we set out to do, which is to move the space forward by making execution a lot more performant and then support, really listen to the community and listen to the fact that people are excited about trying to push the crypto space forward by addressing some of these problems. I don't think that it's a big space. There's a lot of different problems to be solved to ultimately build apps that are better than existing centralized versions of apps that's ultimately the mission is to help decentralized apps eat the world, to help them take over the space that's currently occupied by all these centralized players. And I think there's some areas where decentralized apps have an advantage right now, and there's some areas where they're currently at a disadvantage. And our team's mission is just to help address some of those problems, address some of those shortcomings, but then also to try to work with other people in the space who are addressing some of the other problems. So just to mention really briefly, I think some of the areas that ultimately need to improve in order to help decentralized apps gain more market share and take over the world. It's transaction fees.
00:58:21.018 - 00:59:38.310, Speaker B: It's generally the high amount of slippage or low amount of liquidity when users are interacting with decentralized finance. It is user experience. So like unfamiliarity of wallets and having to approve each transaction and having to keep your private keys safe. And then the large amount of hacks that are in the space and Monad can contribute significantly in a couple of those areas. Specifically lowering transaction fees, substantially enabling an environment where there's much better liquidity, lower slippage. And then on the security side, hopefully by making basically execution much cheaper, we hope that it means that app developers will be able to include more defensive assertions, defend invariants, ensure that properties that should be true are always true, that should always be true, are indeed true at all times. Having those defensive assertions in their code by making execution a lot cheaper so that developers aren't trading off between gas efficiency and safety, but we can't solve all the problems and there are going to be other people in the space that are contributing in other areas that we're not as good at.
00:59:38.310 - 00:59:57.130, Speaker B: So I think just having a very cooperative mindset and knowing that we don't have all the answers to everything, but we're going to do our part and then listening to the community and taking the feedback I think are the ways that we can defend against inevitable occasional fudder that comes on.
00:59:57.200 - 01:00:18.862, Speaker C: All right, well, let's have some fun. Going to do rapid fire now. Just ask you guys short form questions I'll ask and then you guys can answer in the order of Kevin and Keoni and yeah, all right. What scares you the most? Or what do you fear the most about Monad?
01:00:18.926 - 01:00:34.680, Speaker D: I don't really know. I'm pretty excited about it. The thing that kind of attracted me to it is just like it's a good idea and so it's a pretty obviously good idea.
01:00:36.410 - 01:00:37.014, Speaker C: I don't know.
01:00:37.052 - 01:00:49.210, Speaker D: It really scares me the most. I geek out on the tech, so maybe that the tech doesn't work out, but these guys have been building pretty high performance systems for a while, so I have faith.
01:00:51.490 - 01:01:19.800, Speaker B: For me, what scares me the most is if there's a massive, massive hack either in Monad or just even more broadly in the crypto space. I think that security is something we all have to take extremely seriously. And yeah, it's real people's money that is on the line. So that's probably the thing that scares me the most.
01:01:21.210 - 01:01:25.106, Speaker C: What would you say is the most overrated idea in crypto?
01:01:25.218 - 01:01:38.540, Speaker D: I guess my most spicy take is I'm worried that roll ups lead to the same systems with different gatekeepers. And that's really just like my worry, I guess.
01:01:39.970 - 01:02:37.934, Speaker B: I think it's just anything that's not really thought out, but that sounds right. The thing that makes it tough to answer that question is I'm not sure if it's just my lack of knowledge that means I don't understand something super well, but there's something really exciting going on there. Gun to head, I would say shared sequencing, because at the end of the day, there's limited amount of bandwidth. Actually, I'll take that back. I don't know. I think it's fine for potentially roll ups that have very limited capacity expectations. Yeah, I think it's fine, but just if it's portrayed as something that could deliver really high performance, then I think that's something that doesn't necessarily make sense.
01:02:38.052 - 01:02:42.342, Speaker C: What is one app you think everyone should try in crypto?
01:02:42.506 - 01:03:31.520, Speaker D: Probably just normal payments. Honestly, it's such an obviously good use case, and yeah, I don't know. I've needed to send money to people overseas and it's just very easy versus dealing with MoneyGram and all this stuff. I don't have a guide in Nepal that during COVID I helped him out a little bit, right. And I was like, hey, can you make a crypto wallet? This is so much easier. And having that very I could just send him a couple of $100, which was like two months worth of living, right? Yeah, that was pretty cool. That's really what makes it click.
01:03:34.790 - 01:03:48.440, Speaker B: I would say NFTs, but I would say not like buying super crazy expensive NFTs, but just buying some low value ones that have fun, vibrant community. I think there are a lot out there right now.
01:03:49.930 - 01:03:52.550, Speaker C: What does everyone get wrong about Monad?
01:03:54.570 - 01:03:55.858, Speaker B: The pronunciation?
01:03:56.034 - 01:03:57.350, Speaker A: I was like, I can answer that.
01:03:57.420 - 01:03:58.620, Speaker D: Yeah, there you go.
01:03:59.310 - 01:04:06.534, Speaker A: You had the meme Monad mo problems. It's confusing, but clear it up for everyone. It's Monad. It's monad pokemon.
01:04:06.582 - 01:04:09.866, Speaker C: Ad. Okay. All right.
01:04:09.888 - 01:04:10.334, Speaker B: Well, okay.
01:04:10.372 - 01:04:18.218, Speaker C: I'll ask Keoni. Got me with that one. What is, in your view, the most underrated vertical in crypto?
01:04:18.314 - 01:04:40.280, Speaker D: Probably, like, rich data sets. Like bringing that sort of like yeah, I think the people who are thinking about how to bring Verifiable web two data on so that you can do very data rich applications, I think that is probably a little bit underrated right now.
01:04:42.570 - 01:04:43.800, Speaker C: That's a good one.
01:04:45.210 - 01:04:53.500, Speaker B: I think I would have said social, but now that Fronttech is really hot past, like, three weeks, it's hard to say that.
01:04:55.790 - 01:04:57.690, Speaker C: What are your thoughts on Frontech?
01:04:58.910 - 01:05:42.380, Speaker B: I think it's great. I think they just need to continue. Uh, it just feels know they probably know that there's a lot of improvements they want to make, but if you're a team of five or six people, then it's really hard to make all those changes all at once. Clearly, the price per key needs to be lower, needs to be possible for there to be a lot more holders, more functionality in the chat. Maybe some way to have all to all chats instead of just leader to all to leader type communications. But it's exciting. And then I don't know, you wouldn't sell your friends, so I think there's also some potential staying power there.
01:05:42.380 - 01:06:16.070, Speaker B: They also need to. Figure out a way to make it so that people can become notable strictly via friend tech. Right now it's kind of like a replication, it's a microcosm of Twitter, but it's very much a replication of who has a lot of followers on Twitter, then they're the ones that have the highest price shares. I don't know, maybe also the price should matter less. It should be more about volume of messages somehow instead of just like volume of keys traded.
01:06:17.610 - 01:06:28.040, Speaker C: All right, last question. In three years, what do you hope in the best case scenario, what does Monad look like?
01:06:32.030 - 01:07:24.010, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm not the CEO, but I hope it looks like an actual very scalable ecosystem where you can build consumer facing products on it and take advantage of Composability. I think a lot of things have been limited by Composability as much as even on the single state machines, the EVM, you're limited by gas. Right. You can only compose so far before transactions get very expensive. On Solana right now you can only go CPI depth of three. And so I think providing a place where you can really compose at another level could really open up some really cool stuff. So I would like to see Composability taken to Stratospheres that we haven't seen before.
01:07:24.010 - 01:07:33.840, Speaker D: Right. And building on all these cool apps and primitives we have with social and DeFi and all of a sudden not being limited in what you can put together when you're making a cool app.
01:07:36.610 - 01:08:07.000, Speaker B: I think the absolute best case scenario three years from now is that when you're walking around on the street, everyone has a cell phone in their pockets, everyone has a bunch of apps on their phone that have its underlying monad that's powering those applications. And there's new social applications, new decentralized finance apps that are all used by many people on the street that you're just walking around everyday people.
01:08:07.530 - 01:08:26.320, Speaker A: All right, I've got one final one. So one of the advantages of building with the EVM is that it's easier for teams to port over. I know there'd be some differences that you support parallel execution. How do you see do you think more teams will be coming from Ethereum to build on Monad? Or do you think it's more likely that you'll have native teams and applications building there?
01:08:26.690 - 01:09:15.930, Speaker B: I think it'll be a mix. I mean, there's definitely a learning curve, but I would say the learning curve is less about learning solidity and more about learning how to build a successful Web three product. It's like building a startup is really hard. There's a lot of lessons that I have learned as a first time founder that now, if I were to start over again, probably would have been way more efficient about doing things. So I think that traversing that learning curve is a really big thing. And so there definitely will be projects in Monad that are being built by teams that have some experience like it isn't their first rodeo and therefore they know how hard it is and what things you really have to get right. Whether that's the exact same application that's been redeployed.
01:09:15.930 - 01:09:43.480, Speaker B: Like you said, that's very easy. Full bytecode compatibility, so they can literally just redeploy. But also the more complex case where they're building a new application, taking advantage of the more open design space that's unlocked by Monad's throughput, but maybe they're an existing team that knows how to work together and then is building something that they're really excited about that they can take advantage of Monet's design space for.
01:09:44.330 - 01:10:10.602, Speaker D: Yeah, I think like really excited about just the expansion of the design space. It just goes back to the composability thing. It's like all these teams from the know they have their initial products, but what happens when you take the limits off of how they can compose or what they can do right? And so just really seeing hopefully like a Cambridge Pros and down that like on Moned based off things that were maybe originally thought of on the EVM.
01:10:10.666 - 01:10:24.878, Speaker C: I did lie. I have just a final question based off what Keoni just said. So Keoni, you said you made a lot of mistakes, as any startup founder would, and as I have as well. What is maybe the number one advice you would give to aspiring startup founders?
01:10:24.974 - 01:11:13.266, Speaker B: The biggest advice I have or biggest learning I have is just trying to be really fast. That manifests in a number of different forms, obviously with respect to the product, just trying to iterate as quickly as possible and get feedback. But then also just in terms of everything else, I think of it as similar to going to the gym, actually currently in this state of life right now where I'm like, oh man, I should really go to the gym. Maybe I'll go in half an hour, maybe I'll go and when I get free, I'm going to do this other thing first. I'll go tomorrow and then you end up not doing it. So just having that discipline to say like, no, I'm going to go right now at 07:00 P.m.. I always go at 07:00 P.m..
01:11:13.266 - 01:11:53.326, Speaker B: Being similarly just very reactive, very fast. I'm sure you guys have encountered this as well, but just trying to be really fast at actioning on anything that you can as soon as it happens, as soon as an inbound message comes in, respond immediately, otherwise it might slip two days and then you might never respond. Like, just stuff like that. So just having that mentality, that that's the expectation and having that discipline, I think in the early days we didn't have that level of focus or we were like, okay, yeah, I'll get around to that. But I'm doing this other thing. It's hard to multitask, hard to contact, switch. But that's life.
01:11:53.326 - 01:11:56.634, Speaker B: That's part of being part of an early stage startup.
01:11:56.682 - 01:12:09.320, Speaker A: Keoni, Kevin, thanks so much for coming on. I think everyone's really excited to see Modad and bringing parallel execution to the EVM and just what you can do. And also I think that'll contribute to the ethereum community and also spawn and so forth. So thanks so much for joining. I'm excited to see where you guys go.
01:12:09.770 - 01:12:11.320, Speaker D: It's great being on, guys.
01:12:11.850 - 01:12:13.640, Speaker A: Sweet. We'll see you next time.
