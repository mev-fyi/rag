00:00:00.480 - 00:00:18.377, Speaker A: That's kind of like my hot take is I think there will be some economic changes coming to Solana in 2025. I would say. I'm not going to say near, near future, but like I feel this changing in the wind where, you know, burning less than 5% of the daily emissions or weekly emissions, it doesn't feel necessary to be emitting that much.

00:00:43.805 - 00:01:03.513, Speaker C: Hello and welcome back to another episode of Lightspeed. It's an incredibly special episode. Today we have ex host host emeritus legend himself Dan Smith from Blockworks Research coming out of paternity leave to fill in for Mert while Mert's out in Korea. Dan, welcome back to Lightspeed Man.
00:01:03.569 - 00:01:13.205, Speaker A: You are too kind. It's a pleasure to be back though. I'm. I love the roundups. So you've been crushing it. You and Mert are definitely doing far better than Merton I ever did, so I love it.
00:01:13.945 - 00:01:21.521, Speaker C: I don't know if that's the case, but it's high praise. I'm sure the listeners would like to know how is, how is dad life? How's it been?
00:01:21.633 - 00:01:37.267, Speaker A: Dad life is fun. It's fun. It's definitely a whole new set of challenges. But you know, it's interesting. Like being full time in crypto is truly a 247 job. So it was a great warmup lap for being a parent where you're up at weird hours of the night. You're always focused on something else.
00:01:37.267 - 00:02:14.719, Speaker A: Like it's, it's definitely a value add skill set is from rolling in from the crypto world into being a parent. But Anatoly said it best. I don't know if I said this on a podcast before I left, but I like tweeted something out. No, this is actually while I was on paternity leave, so I haven't blessed the Lightspeed listeners with this one yet. But Anatoly, I tweeted something out about being, you know, a first time parent or whatever and Anatoly's comment was this is such an engineering take too. But like, you know, a billion years of human evolution has optimized babies to extract as much value as Possible from their parents without killing them. I'm like, yeah, you know what? That's true.
00:02:14.719 - 00:02:19.079, Speaker A: And it's feeling like it. But no, you're tweet. Yeah.
00:02:19.127 - 00:02:20.471, Speaker C: Yeah, that's an insane.
00:02:20.543 - 00:02:25.931, Speaker A: It's a phenomenal tweet. I mean, I've recycled that like seven times. It's a great line.
00:02:26.103 - 00:02:50.015, Speaker C: You're like, thank you, I appreciate it. No, it's. It shows a lot. I think, about just the crypto industry that I found out you were having a kid and it was like, jarring. I just. I know very few people that I work with in this job that have kids. So it's a young industry and it's fun to have a dad now as an ex host of the Lightspeed podcast.
00:02:50.015 - 00:02:59.771, Speaker C: But I think if I was a different kind of financial journalist, I much more often would be asking colleagues and sources about their kids. But I don't do that very often.
00:02:59.843 - 00:03:10.171, Speaker A: So. Fair enough, fair enough, fair enough. And the bad jokes come. Come with something. Something in the wind just changes and you ultimately get really bad at jokes. So if any of those slip out.
00:03:10.203 - 00:03:17.291, Speaker C: This pod, you're like complaining about people leaving windows open with the AC and things like that. It just happens one day.
00:03:17.323 - 00:03:23.887, Speaker A: Yeah, I just installed a fridge waterline. Never thought I'd be doing that. So here we are, full dad mode.
00:03:24.071 - 00:04:01.657, Speaker C: Well, look, I'm excited to get into it with you, Dan, because while you have been on paternity leave, you've been keeping one eye on the crypto world. It looks like you've been active on Twitter, around Blackworks HQ online a little bit. And most recently I saw on Twitter that you had some strong feelings about a Justin Drake take that came out in this Reddit AMA the other day. So maybe to just get us warmed up, I'm curious to hear you unpack sort of your issue with this. This take from the Ethereum foundation researcher Justin Drake.
00:04:01.841 - 00:04:51.621, Speaker A: Yeah, Justin's a great guy, super smart, but I think he just missed the mark on an important piece of information in his take around how L2s kind of drive top line revenue. And so it's actually Sean Adams. Ryan. Sean Adams from Bankless, who tweeted out just a screenshot of Justin's take. I won't like, run through the meat of it, but basically he was saying that MEV is not being extracted on L2s and that all of the fee revenue is generated from congestion freeze rather than priority fees. So before we get into the meat of this, just like explain the difference there. So Ethereum and most EVM chains use a fee mechanism called that was created in EIP1559 where you have a base fee which is like the inclusion fee.
00:04:51.621 - 00:05:27.887, Speaker A: So you have to pay at least this price to be eligible to be in the block. And then you have a priority fee which you can think of as an ordering fee. And that ordering fee will put you higher up in the block. And so the OP stack built by Optimism, that's what OP Maintenance built on. So base is built on Zora Mode and a few other chains. The OP stack uses priority ordering. And what that means is the there's like about a 2 second block time and transactions will pile in, they'll go to the sequencer and at the end of the block time the sequencer will sort the transactions by the highest priority fee.
00:05:27.887 - 00:06:10.013, Speaker A: So the highest priority fee goes first. And so that's just kind of like a quick background on how the fee mechanism works as it pertains to the OP stack, which of course base Coinbase's L2 built on Ethereum is built out on top of. So I was going through some data here and Michael Silbert over at the OP labs, he's a beast. Definitely recommend checking out all of his work on Dune. He has a great analysis here. So all the chains in the super chain, which I think the four largest are again ZORA Mode, Base and OP Mainnet, you can see on this chart here, this dark red is the L2 base fee. So again that's congestion fee or that inclusion fee, you can think of it as the price I need to pay to get in the block.
00:06:10.013 - 00:07:14.501, Speaker A: That accounts for Roughly, let's call it 10 to 15 to 20% of the total fee revenue for these chains, while the priority fee, or again that ordering fee is about 80% to get in the block. And the L1 overhead fees and blob fees are quite low here, which again you can kind of see given that blob fees are still priced around zero. And so really the crux of this take, which you know, Justin did later, correct, you know he thought they used FIFO ordering in the original post, which only Arbitrum does that or first come first serve order ordering, where they're not ranked, the transactions in a block are not ranked by priority fee, but they're rather ranked by the order in which they're received. This kind of opens up like a whole different can of worms with the closer you are to the sequencer, the lower your latency and the quicker you can get transactions approved. So it's kind of just Like a different model with a different spectrum of trade offs. But again, op stack uses priority ordering and about 80% of fees are of total fees on all of the op stack chains are from priority order chains. And on base specifically that number is a little bit closer to 85%.
00:07:14.501 - 00:07:55.147, Speaker A: And what I thought was really interesting here was I basically took, I think I did all of 2024's data. And so I said, all right, well let's look at where you are in the block again, number one being the top of block. And you know, on average there's about 50 transactions in a block on base. And so 50 would be the last transaction in a block. And I said all right, well what's the trade like? What's the spread between the priority fee and the base fee that you're paying depending on where you are in the block? And we actually noticed that the first transaction in the block or the top of block about 99% of their total transaction fee. Right, it's all priority fees. And the question is why? Well, it's arbitrage.
00:07:55.147 - 00:09:10.023, Speaker A: If I am executing that first transaction in the block, I can basically go across any defi pool and create my own arbitrage transaction. A lot of that is centralized exchange to decentralized exchange or sex dex arbitrage. This kind of just discharge here definitely shows you that there are users that very much so want to drive specific transactions and be first in the block. And again, because of that priority ordering mechanism, you're basically running an auction for the first few slots in the block. And so I took that one step further and said all right, well noticing that that relationship is so strong, when we look at how much of the, of those, how much priority fee is driven by particular groups of indexes or where they are in the block, like the location of the block. The transaction's location in a block is called the index. And so if we take groups of indexes, so you know, every, the top 10 transactions in a block, the top five transactions in a block, the top three and actually just the top one transaction block, the first transaction and said, all right, the priority fees paid for these groups, what percentage of that is total transaction fee revenue generating? And the answers are kind of shocking.
00:09:10.023 - 00:09:57.531, Speaker A: So if you just look at the priority fees paid to be the first transaction in every block on base, the those fees make up 40% of the total transaction fee revenue for the entire chain. So just paying for the first slot is giving you 40 is giving base 40% of its total transaction fees, which is a pretty staggering number and it's kind of hard to compare this to something like a Solana or an Ethereum, where they don't technically have priority ordering mechanisms. There's these off chain auctions like MEV Boost by Flashbots or Jito by their block engine. It's just like this whole thing kind of gets skewed. But when you're looking at just base, you know, we do see this crazy staggering point that 40% of total transaction fees come from priority fees paid to be the first transaction in every block.
00:09:57.723 - 00:10:28.755, Speaker C: That's like a insane stat. So to like explain this arbitrage. So people are paying just a very high priority fee, 40% to be that first transaction is the idea that once you've secured the first transaction in the block, you've affected the price and then can benefit off of the, the change in price by the like speed discrepancy between sexes and dexes. How, how is that working exactly?
00:10:28.795 - 00:10:57.343, Speaker A: Yeah, so let's like run through an example where you can imagine that there's a Dex on base that was selling, you know, you could buy one eth for. I haven't checked the charts here. So let's just say, you know, eth is at $2,000. You can buy one eth on chain for two grand and you can turn around and sell it to Binance for $2010. Right. So there's, I can buy something for 2000 and immediately sell it for 2010. I would be willing to pay, you know, $9.99
00:10:57.343 - 00:11:22.747, Speaker A: to buy that one ETH because I could still sell it on Binance and capture that $0.01 spread, you know, and now you can obviously adjust for risk and whatnot. And it doesn't always work out to 99%. But that is like there is some upper bound. I'm saying I can still execute this trade as long and make a profit so long as I pay below X dollars. Right. And you know, the base fee on base or the inclusion fee to get in a block is very, very low.
00:11:22.747 - 00:11:38.095, Speaker A: It's, you know, below $0.01. And so you're paying that base fee to be eligible to be in the block. And then I'm paying another, you know, seven, eight, nine dollars to execute this arbitrage transaction. And again, I'm basically buying Ethan Chain and then selling it to Binance or Coinbase, whatever it may be.
00:11:39.205 - 00:12:27.663, Speaker C: Interesting. And so the relevance of this to my understanding is that, or maybe why Justin Drake was so criticized is there's this critique out there that L2s ultimately become parasitic to Ethereum's. Revenue as a layer one. And he was sort of refuting that in the post is the idea I heard and you would wish it were true that you can live in this world where you build this infinite garden and the successive base does not come at the success of ETH layer 1, but perhaps a world where most transactions happen on L2s. ETH loses like a meaningful amount of the revenue back to the chain. Is that sort of the idea of why this distinction matters?
00:12:27.799 - 00:13:05.723, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely think that's like the broad, the broad overarching point these days that people have been debating is, you know, is this what's best for eth1 to have all of this high value transactions happening off on. On base instead of Ethereum. But as it specifically pertains to this post, I would say this was like a little more narrowed in that. So Max Resnick, he works at smg who is acquired by consensus. He's pushing the idea of Braid, which is like an upgraded consensus mechanism for Ethereum. And he had this point that he like, he really wants to make the L1 great again. That's kind of his like little motto and bringing back a lot of transaction activity to Ethereum mainnet.
00:13:05.723 - 00:13:37.625, Speaker A: And one of his claims was, you know, L2s don't have any incentive to decentralize the sequencer. Right. Again, they're making all of this money off of people doing, running this arbitrage trade. And why would they want to decentralize the sequencer set and kind of jeopardize that or you know, give that up because then you'd be paying a larger set. Well, right now I get to just keep it all. So there was kind of some banter about that. And that specific point of like, you know, who gets the priority fees in a decentralized sequencer state is still kind of up for debate I think.
00:13:37.625 - 00:14:24.129, Speaker A: You know, I think Resnick's point is that it's like pretty technical into if you don't have censorship resistance, then you kind of lose the value accrual to the chain itself and at the expense of the decentralized sequencer set, they're capturing that value instead of the chain. And and so again, if you put yourself in the shoes of coinbase, you could say you can make the argument that they just want to be value maximizing and continue to drive their top line. I think they've publicly made it clear that that's not what they're trying to do and they truly want to decentralize this thing. But there are financial incentives that Point in the other direction. So it kind of remains to be seen. And building a decentralized sequencer set is very non trivial. That's kind of why it's not live today.
00:14:24.129 - 00:15:07.645, Speaker A: So we still see. It seems like espresso trying to figure out what this really looks like and how you can bring this to market. But to your first point, like, yeah, I just think that's the kind of the question that everyone's trying to answer today. You know, Ethereum transaction fees are total economic value between transaction fees and tips is down considerably from last bull run, while Solana has kind of come the other way and caught up and kind of forced the hand of Ethereum to say, okay, you know, are we doing the right thing? Like there's this other chain taking a very different approach that isn't doing very well while we're kind of not doing poorly, but just not outperforming. So it's kind of like you see someone else outperforming, you're not outperforming and you call into question your roadmap or your direction.
00:15:07.945 - 00:16:37.281, Speaker C: Yeah, man. And I feel like we end up talking about Ethereum drama a lot on these roundups these days because it's a real thing right now. I think that there are like definitively bad vibes in the Ethereum world. And like the Reddit AMA felt like an attempt to maybe mend fences a little bit and say that Ethereum, the Ethereum foundation, is going to disclose its spending and all these things. And I think broadly that went over well. But I did see that there was sort of controversy coming out of that even with, yeah, the sort of post that Justin Drake made about sequencer fees. So I want to from there maybe transition and we have kind of a special type of roundup today that's going to be a little more data heavy because it feels like right now we're in a specific moment in the crypto world, broadly, certainly on Solana, where it feels like after this summer where transaction volumes were really high, the amount of revenue going to validators and all these sorts of things were elevated really to a level that didn't go down meaningfully since, I don't know, April, it feels like after all of that, the things really are cooling off in a real way.
00:16:37.281 - 00:17:22.055, Speaker C: And this could be sort of an inflection point towards less of a hot market than, than what we saw during the summer. I was actually like hesitant to declare it to be so because I think that the kind of meme coin, token, airdrop world we live in creates A lot of grumpiness and people are always saying, oh, meme coins are over. But they're not. Pump Fund is still booking incredible revenues. But it, it really does look like maybe things are starting to shift. And as some of you may know, Blockworks, Solana Dashboard is now public. And so I wanted to bring Data daddy himself on the pod to.
00:17:22.055 - 00:17:25.135, Speaker C: I'm sorry, I had to get at least one.
00:17:25.475 - 00:17:30.092, Speaker A: I would have the bad jokes that make me feel better to chat a.
00:17:30.108 - 00:17:44.956, Speaker C: Little bit about what we're seeing in the data and sort of what this specific moment in the kind of Solana on chain world looks like. So with that intro, Dan, could you just dive into this dashboard a little bit and what you've been seeing.
00:17:45.140 - 00:18:09.881, Speaker A: Absolutely. Would love to. I think there's a lot of interesting stories to mention. But one last thing that you mentioned, you probably find yourself talking about Ethereum a lot and it's for good reason. That's the largest ecosystem today where a lot of this industry was born out of. So I think it's important to like understand even if you're, you know, you're solely obsessed with one chain and what's going on in that ecosystem, I still think it's important to know what the rest of the industry is doing. There's like a lot of lessons to be learned.
00:18:09.881 - 00:18:11.937, Speaker A: So I just wanted to throw that tidbit in as well.
00:18:11.961 - 00:18:12.953, Speaker C: Yeah, good note, good note.
00:18:13.009 - 00:19:17.183, Speaker A: But yeah, so we opened up our Solana Dashboard in partnership with the or in collaboration with the Salon foundation. And I think it's really cool to just kind of bring this data out to give people a better understanding of what's happening. And so at Blockwork Research we really like this idea of total economic value, which is basically the top line metric for a blockchain. And in terms of Solana that's going to be vote fees, transaction fees and jitotips where jito tips are basically people having an out of protocol mechanism to increase the inclusion or ordering priority of their transaction. And so you know, we have the two year view on in the weekly and you can see that for much of this chart you can't really see any bars until about November 2023. And it's kind of when Solana had its defi resurgence and that's really carried through into 2024. And so you know, as of this week we're at back to like pretty much March, February, March lows in terms of total economic value accrued.
00:19:17.183 - 00:19:48.589, Speaker A: But I think, and really the interesting point here has been how closely coupled that was with mean coins and Dex activity. Right. We're going to build out a full Dex metrics tab on this. But in the meantime, if we look at Defi llama and their Dex volume on Solana, you know, you can see how this chart really mimics the image and shape of the total economic value curve. Right. I know we've fallen off a clip here. We had the March highs, we go back to total economic value again, we see those March highs and we've kind of fallen off that cliff.
00:19:48.589 - 00:20:31.861, Speaker A: And you mentioned pump fun earlier and people have interesting feelings about pump fun and the revenue they've made and the extraction that that's pulled from the ecosystem loves to get thrown around. And you know, I even saw, which was interesting, someone tweeted out like a chart of the Solana price mapped on top of pump fund launches. And it kind of like flatlined right over it, but okay, then also put bitcoin on that chart and it's the same shape. And I do not think pump fun changed the price of bitcoin, but it was. I think this is a classic correlation is not causation moment. But I think what's interesting about total economic value is how that moves through the system. So, you know, it's generated in part by priority fees in JITO tips.
00:20:31.861 - 00:21:19.267, Speaker A: Right? That's people want to pay to be included and ordered properly in the chain. And that's what we see today. About 95% of fees come from again, tips and priority fees. But where that this total economic value flows or how does the chain use its source of revenue is very, very, very interesting to me. And so if you think back to, you know, August 2022, we, we have this interesting world where stakers were actually making no fees and they're getting none of this total economic value and it was just 50, 50 split between validators and then soul burn. An interesting thing about Solana that I don't think is like common knowledge is transaction fees are kept by validators. There are some community validators that return a portion of that to their stakers.
00:21:19.267 - 00:21:35.889, Speaker A: But this is like an out of protocol mechanism. Like actually in Solana, there's just no way to take a commission on transaction fees earned by the validator and pass the rest of the stakers. That commission value you see only pertains to emissions, which is just kind of an interesting thing. You know, I'm not a huge fan of that, but we'll get into that in a minute.
00:21:36.057 - 00:21:40.897, Speaker C: Wait, so why, why were people staking at all if there was no revenue? Share.
00:21:41.001 - 00:22:10.005, Speaker A: So you're still getting those emissions. Right? So, you know, inflation today is about 6%. So you know, a lot of the more popular validators that people stake to have between like 0 and 10% commission on that inflation. So you're still earning something. It's just not a portion of this top line revenue. Right. The top line revenue or this total economic value is driven by activity on the chain, whereas the emissions are, you know, this is like this internal piece, right? They're just like inflating the token to incentivize staking.
00:22:10.005 - 00:23:00.495, Speaker A: Okay. And so, yeah, that's an important point of context there. So I'm glad you brought that up. When looking at total economic value and the, you know, the use of that to where it flows after it's been collected, that does not include emissions again. And so, and if you Fast forward from 2022 to today with the increase in MEV activity and some of the network congestion issues that have led people to wildly adopt the JITO block engine and using their transaction processing mechanism, that is a huge difference between staker income because again, transaction fees can't be split in protocol with stakers. But MEV tips are. And the average commission today I think is around 20%, but that's kind of skewed higher by some 100% validators, which is like a whole nother can of worms we can gloss over for now.
00:23:00.495 - 00:23:40.193, Speaker A: But most, most validators you'll stake to. If you were just like, you know, you or I who had, you know, a couple sold, wanted to earn some yield on, you're again, you're gonna be sub 10% on that commission split. So if the validator earns one soul, they'll take point one and pass point nine back to their stakers in most cases. And so now when we look at this total economic value, right, let's assume it was like, you know, a billion dollars. All right, here we can actually use the last, the last week. So last week we earned, the network earned $8 million in total economic value between tips and transaction fees. And that was split between stakers, validators, the Soul Burn and Judo Labs in A.
00:23:40.193 - 00:23:56.599, Speaker A: So 30% went to stakers, 37% went to two validators, 30% was burned. And then the JITO Labs takes a cut on the top line of tips moving through their system. So 2% of the total economic value went to JITO Labs. And that's just the 5% fee on their tips.
00:23:56.767 - 00:23:58.791, Speaker C: That's probably a huge number for JITO.
00:23:58.863 - 00:24:23.665, Speaker A: As a. Yeah, they're doing well. If we actually scroll down to this view here. So Jito Labs makes about three, you know, a few million bucks a quarter off the 5% of those tips, which you can see the growth in TIPS over the last few quarters. In Q4, 2023, there was just 3.4 million in tips. And if you fast forward to, you know, the forecasted number for the end of this quarter is just under 100 million.
00:24:23.665 - 00:24:34.581, Speaker A: So we've seen a massive, massive, massive growth over the last few, over the last few months. And again, that's driven largely by Dex trading activity.

00:25:46.993 - 00:26:10.441, Speaker C: So this is maybe a dumb question, Dan, but when people say that validators earn revenue from mev, what does that, like, mean? Because I know that MEV is kind of the reordering of blocks of transactions within a block to be like the most efficient. But like, how does that actually turn into revenue? Is it just tips?
00:26:10.593 - 00:26:37.394, Speaker A: Yes, that's a great question. And let's think back to that similar example we gave when we were talking about base earlier, where, you know, let's say there's an opportunity to buy one soul on chain for 130 bucks and then you can turn around, sell to Binance for 140. Right. Let's say that's the example. So there's this $10 opportunity to go make money. The median fee to get a transaction included on Solana is like about 2/10 of a cent. So $0.002.
00:26:37.394 - 00:27:21.925, Speaker A: And I would be very. Again, there's this $10 opportunity. And so I'm willing to pay much more than 2/10 of a cent to make sure that I win this transaction, because if I win this transaction, I'll make 10 bucks. And so you have this ability to pay higher to increase the odds that you are the one winning this transaction. And so that is where a lot of these tips come from. It's just arbitrage sandwiching is the more malicious version of this, where an unsuspecting user kind of has their transaction leaked and somebody can execute two transactions, one in front, one behind, hence the name sandwiching, and basically push their price to make it the user. The unsuspecting user, getting a worse price at the benefit of the attacker, in this case.
00:27:21.925 - 00:27:50.039, Speaker A: So sandwiching is very bad, and we want to minimize that as much as possible. Arbitrage kind of people have mixed views on. I think in one far end of the spectrum, you know, that's still like bad mev, because LPs are kind of taking the brunt of the arbitrage opportunity by giving a worse price to the trader. And the other end is, yeah, well, you know, the chain is getting the price rebalanced to the proper price that it should be. It's kind of like removing the inefficiency from the market. So it's just two different views. So.
00:27:50.039 - 00:28:13.567, Speaker A: Yeah. Does that kind of clear up how the MEV comes through? And so I guess. Let me take that home, actually. And so there's this $10 opportunity on chain the Trader, which they're kind of called searchers when it comes to mev, but there's really just traders, right? They're buying something, selling something, and the searcher says, all right, I see this $10 opportunity. I'll give you eight bucks for me to go win this. And then that $8 is what the validator takes a profit on. Right.
00:28:13.567 - 00:28:32.543, Speaker A: And so that'll come through as tips. So Judo labs will take 5% of that $8, and then the 95% of that. Don't make me do math on the fly here. But the. The other, you know, seven. Seven bucks and change goes to the validator. The validator then takes their 0 to 10% commission, and then the last Bit goes to the stakers.
00:28:32.543 - 00:28:37.703, Speaker A: So they get, you know, roughly 85% of every tip stakers do.
00:28:37.879 - 00:29:13.871, Speaker C: Okay, that, that's a, that's a good caveat. Also I should add, if you're listening to this podcast, Dan is doing the most right now and he's like screen sharing and there's some nice graphics on screen. So I just wanted to add that note for listeners that the YouTube or Spotify video version or Twitter video version is probably good. So. But to continue what we're saying currently. So as far as I understand, like you know, 20, 22 stakers get none of the total economic value on Solana. Today they get roughly a third.
00:29:13.871 - 00:29:52.983, Speaker C: And on this podcast and in talking to me, you've described blockchains like Solana as these Internet economies or decentralized economies kind of. And so in this Internet economy there, there's kind of a philosophical dimension to this in terms of how much should stakers get? How much of the economic value are stakers entitled to versus validators versus how much should be burned versus JITO Labs. So how do you think about that? Or if you don't have an opinion, I guess what are the considerations as far as where the TV should be going in the ecosystem?
00:29:53.119 - 00:30:10.047, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, great question. And again, just tv. Tv, like I kind of like the term, kind of hate the term. But you just think of it as like top line revenue for this ecosystem. And there is multiple parties that have slightly different interests in this, in this economy. Right. Stakers are taking their.
00:30:10.047 - 00:30:45.251, Speaker A: I guess we'll start with holders, right. If I just hold soul, you know what I really want you to do is burn the shit out of all the TV because that will decrease the amount of soul and therefore I benefit as just a pure token holder. But stakers are kind of like a subset of token holders. That said, all right, I'm going to, yes, I want to hold this token, but I'm also going to stake it to a validator and try to earn some extra revenue or some extra yield. And so they're like holder on steroids, if you will. And so they have slightly different interests because, you know, if I'm a staker, yeah, I definitely want you to keep burning it, right. I want you to like keep the supply relatively even.
00:30:45.251 - 00:31:15.231, Speaker A: But I'm also getting a cut of new inflation as well. But as it pertains just to the tev, you know, I, I kind of want you to just pay me that, right? Just give me dollars. Like don't just burn it all. So you can kind of see, there's already a push and pull between holders and stakers because you have the ability to earn additional yield that isn't just in burn. And that's like a little bit more real, a little bit more tangible and kind of makes the asset a little interesting in my opinion. Right. Like if I told you there's asset A and asset B and asset A, you know, yielded 5% and asset B yielded 0%.
00:31:15.231 - 00:31:33.919, Speaker A: Like which one do you think is more interesting? The one with yield 10%. Yeah. And so there is already a push and pull there. And then you add this third layer here which is validators. And validators do the hard work of operating the chain. And it is non. That's very complicated work because.
00:31:33.919 - 00:31:59.897, Speaker A: And it's not cheap. It costs about $50,000 a year to run a Solana validator. And so you need about, as it stands today, like roughly $6 million in stake to break even. Solana foundation has a good delegation program that helps with this. But ultimately I feel like you need to figure out a way to balance these things and people are actively doing this. The overclock team is building Mithril, which is making it easier to access and verify Solana. The chain itself, huge shout out to them.
00:31:59.897 - 00:32:39.763, Speaker A: They're doing very, very cool work. But it's kind of going off on a tangent, but to take it back to this. Yeah. So you have like the token holders, the token stakers, and then the people actually operating the chain. And when you look at it from a super high level view, the. Because it's a stake weighted chain and all the transaction fees go to the validators, the validators that sit at the top of this chain are making a shit ton of money in transaction fees. Um, and if we look like, if you say, all right, there's left roughly like 1400 validators that have like you know, over let's say a thousand sol and stakes or like something meaningful, costs about $50,000 a year to run a validator.
00:32:39.763 - 00:33:23.693, Speaker A: So that's about like $70 million a year and just pure operating expenses. And I think in the long run you're gonna see validator profit margins trend towards some like long term, you know, business like 5 to 10% margin here. It doesn't make sense that these validators are operating at such huge margins today because they also get to run additional businesses. I wish like MERT was here. You know, they run a validator because they're an RPC and they get to provide their customers a better service by being a large validator. So it is very beneficial to them. That's why they have 0% commissions across the board and why they like, I don't know if they are returning transaction fees out of protocol or if that's like something being discussed.
00:33:23.693 - 00:33:44.735, Speaker A: I'm sure it's like a very complicated tax situation and a bit of a nightmare. But like, like they want, they don't care if they don't make any money on the validator because it gives their core business, which is being an rpc, a leg up. And so again, I think over the long run, I think validators are eating right now. I don't necessarily think that's the long term solution here.
00:33:44.845 - 00:34:03.899, Speaker C: Well, some, some validators are, I guess the reason why this conversation of do you return TV to stakers? Does it go to validators is interesting to me is I've been thinking recently about small validators because the. Are you familiar with like the delegation program that the Solana foundation does?
00:34:04.027 - 00:34:04.563, Speaker A: Yep.
00:34:04.659 - 00:34:52.303, Speaker C: So, so they, they have this program where they'll, they'll cover some costs, some voting costs for new validators and they'll match some of your stake up to a certain amount if you're like a small validator. And the idea behind this is the Solana foundation has a ton of soul and they want to incentivize a more diverse, decentralized ecosystem of validators. And it's very hard to make it as like a dude running a validator out of your basement or something because as you said, there's costs of millions that you have to have access to. The other thing that to show Mert a little bit, Helios did a report on this question. The Solana foundation delegation program. It's an amazing report. It was very informative.
00:34:52.303 - 00:35:50.257, Speaker C: One thing they point out is if you're a Solana validator, your costs are fixed at a certain level, but your revenue scales with the amount of soul that you hold and with the price of soul. So in a world where the price of Solana has been essentially flat since March or whenever we crossed this 130 line with the asset price and this is a separate conversation, but the Solana foundation has capped put commission caps on members of the program. So it used to be that you could charge a 7% commission. Now you can only charge 5%. And with Jitotips or Jito Mev, I believe you used to be able to charge 100% if you wanted to. Now it's something like 10%. So there's these factors coming together that's actually making it hard to run a small validator.
00:35:50.257 - 00:36:45.071, Speaker C: And it just got me thinking. And I think I was chatting with Tim is his name, the guy who runs the Solana foundation delegation program in dms. And he was basically like, you know, the point of this program is to give people a leg up and then hopefully they participate in the market and run a competitive validator. And in a world where you can keep really high commissions and stuff, you could turn a profit by just kind of using the grants that the Solana foundation gives out. And that's not a world you want to live in forever, but you do want a more diverse set of validators. You want little guys to be able to run them. So I don't know, how do you think about this problem kind of in the world we're living in where there's like very high variance margins for validators and it's maybe becoming harder for smaller validators.
00:36:45.071 - 00:36:47.255, Speaker C: Like, what's the pathway forward?
00:36:47.715 - 00:37:11.823, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a great question. It really is. I think the Solana foundation is doing a really good job with that delegation program. Right. The question, I guess the overarching question is what is sufficient decentralization? Like, when do you cross the threshold of being like a centralized CIA chain into a global decentralized network of nodes? And it's a really hard question to answer. There's a lot of different factors. It's not just like node count.
00:37:11.823 - 00:37:52.317, Speaker A: You need different operators using different setups across different data centers that have different geographical ties and regulatory ties and what jurisdictions are in. Like, there's a lot of layers to this. So I don't think there's like, I guess all that to say. It's very hard to point and say this is decentralized, this is not decentralized. Well, I guess actually the easy thing to do is say, identify when things are not decentralized. But it's funny because it's very hard to then identify when things are decentralized. Like, what is the node count? Is it 1,000 nodes? Is it 2,000 nodes? Is it 10,000 nodes with unique operators? It's a very hard question to ask.
00:37:52.317 - 00:38:19.845, Speaker A: And so I don't know, man. I think you can just see the growth that we've seen in the Solana operator set and the diversity we've seen. Helix has been around Solana for a while, but they were able to spin up and a node and kind of climb to the top of the leaderboard with relative haste. I think that's kind of like a one off. I don't know. I definitely don't Think that's the every day. But what's cool is you're starting to see a lot more like businesses try to run validators as well.
00:38:19.845 - 00:39:06.425, Speaker A: A lot of them are using Sanctum and going back to that point about, like, operator and data center diversity, I don't actually know how Sanctum is operating these things. Like, are they just using the contracts to make the LST side of things really easy? Are they actually running the nodes? Because if they are running the nodes and doing all the same setup for all these different nodes, then that is slightly less decentralized. Then you are losing some diversity across the set. Obviously, with Fire Dancer coming live, that is a huge piece here is client diversity. If everyone is running the exact same software and it has a bug in it and breaks, then everybody breaks. If you have two, well, then you actually have this safety net of a number of nodes that can run both simultaneously. Seems to kind of be the direction that we're going.
00:39:06.425 - 00:40:01.623, Speaker A: So, yeah, all that to say it's a very hard question to answer, but kind of tying this back into, like, the TV side of things is like, how do you keep the validator incentives high enough such that the lower end of the operators are still driving benefit? Because again, we did the quick math. About 50k a year to run a validator and about 1400 validators. So that's roughly 70 million. And if we look at the value flow between stakers and validators, let's go to the yearly one here, the forecast for 2024, which is just taking the current data through September 5th and just linearly projecting that forward so they're on pace to make about $1.2 billion. And it only takes $70 million to run the set. Again, that's super skewed to the higher end, the validators with the most stake.
00:40:01.623 - 00:40:42.963, Speaker A: And then you also see fairly high commissions for TIPS and emissions. And that's because these, again, these are skewed higher by validators that have 100% commissions. And these, like, there's. Yeah, again, we'll kind of gloss over that piece for now just because to me, what that looks like is there's like, large private round investors who will stake to a validator and they can put the commission to 100%. And then that way they're like, earning the yield on their stake, which are like their locked stake. We see this a lot in the cosmos. The staking module was built in a way where cosmos chains can have locked assets staked to them, and then you earn the yield.
00:40:42.963 - 00:41:11.995, Speaker A: And it's kind of like this easy way for investors to earn money on locked tokens. I think that's a little bit of what we're seeing here. But the, I think the last big unlock for Solana is in March of next year. So it'd be very interesting to see how this shifts going forward. But again like they're making 100% of transaction fees from a chain level view, they're making a total of 21% of commission on GEO tips. But again like if you or I wanted to stake to a validator we would get less than that. There will be less commission than that.
00:41:11.995 - 00:41:37.175, Speaker A: And about, again same thing with about 23% on sole emissions. So net net it's like $1.2 billion. So again that's why when I said validators are eating earlier as a whole they are, but this is flowing disproportionately to validators across the set. And it's like are the incentives built in such a way today that kind of balance that out? And like it's, the answer is no. But you know, I'm not sitting here on, on the answer of how to fix things.
00:41:37.795 - 00:41:38.355, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:41:38.435 - 00:42:05.757, Speaker A: So you can also see how this benefit or lacks the benefit towards stakers. Right. They don't make any transaction freeze in protocol. They do get a portion of GEO tips and like that's been the driving factor for staking recently. And again they have this like sole emissions thing where there's like this internal piece as well. So the first two being related to the top line number. And then emissions are of course not driven by activity.
00:42:05.757 - 00:42:38.437, Speaker A: And so I'd love to see an increase in total economic value flowing to stakers. And I'd also love to see emissions come down because if we look where we're at today, we're only burning. Solana is an inflationary token as it stands today. And you have to ask yourself, well why are we inflating tokens? And it's to ensure this valuers have this safety net to be profitable and run and operate the network. But then you look at again $70 million of hardware cost, $1.2 billion of cash flow generated. There is a huge mismatch there.
00:42:38.437 - 00:42:41.297, Speaker A: And so I think we need to think about ways to kind of pare that lower.
00:42:41.441 - 00:43:24.255, Speaker C: But I don't like, I don't necessarily see why stakers are entitled to a large share of the TV on Solana because the validators are performing the service like they're the ones doing, you know, bringing that work to consensus building. The blockchain stakers, you Know, to like go back to the economy example. It's like the validators go build the bodega across the street. The stakers are just giving, you know, throwing $10 into the hat to help them with like inventory. So. And you know, Solana's unbonding period is two days. So you can get your, you can unstake your Solana very easily and exit that position.
00:43:24.255 - 00:43:38.951, Speaker C: So I just don't really see that stakers do enough philosophy or like just like on a philosophical level, like, are they actually entitled to the economic value created by Solana more than a few percent? I don't know.
00:43:39.103 - 00:44:06.659, Speaker A: It's a good question. I think there's some market forces to push that number higher for the stakers. Because if you think about it, right, if you run your validator and I run my validator and we're competing for stake, what's the more attractive if you have 100 commissions and I have zeros, you know, who's. Who's going to collect more stake from the community and it should be me, right? Because I'm actually willing to pay my stake or something versus you're not. So I do think there's some market you're also sandwiching.
00:44:06.707 - 00:44:07.775, Speaker C: So it's, you know.
00:44:09.675 - 00:44:31.775, Speaker A: It'S true. No. So, yeah, I do think there's some market forces here where these things will come lower as validators kind of compete. But I guess the counterpoint there is people have been saying that like Coinbase trading fees will come lower. Like I made a trade on the Coinbase the other day, I think they went higher. So I don't know. It's.
00:44:31.775 - 00:45:09.005, Speaker A: You can point at things and say, yeah, there's market forces, these will come down. But over what time horizon ultimately becomes the question. But I don't know. I think I was in a Twitter discussion with Ben from Margin, who just founded his own company now that I'm blanking on the name of. But even he mentioned, like, yeah, I think we need to decrease soul inflation. And I was tweeting at tolerate once and he was like, well, would you lower inflation? And I'm like, okay, there's like a bit of a change in the window on, you know, these very smart, intelligent people that have historically. So speaking broadly about Solana, historically has like been throw the economics to the side.
00:45:09.005 - 00:45:42.775, Speaker A: Who gives a shit? Like, this is an engineering project. We're going to come at this from engineering angles versus Ethereum has been totally the other end of the spectrum in some ways and has been like, all right, you know, let's talk about economics and let's make major economic changes to our chain. The beautiful synergy is probably somewhere in the middle of those views which I do think Solana has been kind of prioritizing, right. Like the idea was we can't make economic changes until we have improved the engineering side of the infrastructure. Right. Or else we're going to be using shitty data to make our decisions. So I do kind of agree with that.
00:45:42.775 - 00:46:31.975, Speaker A: So that's kind of like my, my hot take is I think there will be some economic changes coming to Solana in 2025. I would say, I'm not going to say near, near future but like I feel this changing in the wind where you know, burning less than 5% of the daily emissions or weekly emissions is just not, it doesn't feel necessary to be emitting that much. And here if we quickly. This is for, on the Blockworks research product itself. But if I just refresh this tab when you look at the amount. Of course now my wifi is giving me troubles but if you, I'll verbally explain this chart. Like if you compare Ethereum which has, you know, let's call it a $300 million, $300 billion market cap to Solana which is, let's call it a third of that.
00:46:31.975 - 00:47:09.895, Speaker A: We, you, you wouldn't expect Solana to be emitting more in dollar value, oops in dollar value than Ethereum. Like why would they be issuing more in value? And yet, you know, that's kind of what we do see. And so I think this is a super interesting comparison here. Again go to that two year weekly view. Ethereum was always light years ahead of Solana in total economic value. And I'm picking a couple of random weeks here. It's like you know, 10 to 20 to 30x to 90x the differences in Ethereum being the larger value there we fast forward to today, the two are kind of on top of each other.
00:47:09.895 - 00:47:38.911, Speaker A: I think that's interesting. But to get back to the point here had to throw. If we look at issuance here, if we go Solana and Ethereum, you know, Solana issues on some days almost double the amount of value that Ethereum is to its validator set. And I don't know like again that just doesn't feel like the happy equilibrium. So yeah, that's my hot take. Economic changes are closer to coming to Solana than most people think.
00:47:39.103 - 00:48:28.275, Speaker C: Interesting. Book it. We'll, we'll, we'll bring you back on the pod in the year to chat. Look, we've been We've been having fun, but this is a roundup and I'm concerned if we keep going down this road, we're not going to talk about any current things and people are going to yell at me. So I guess we'll do like a quick, just like quick hitters for a couple of things that frankly in a, in a slow news week have been going on, but just things that I've been interested in that are going on and just getting your take on them. Dan. So as far as things that happened this week to chat roundup, the first one I want to start with, and you mentioned this earlier, is Sanctum announced three Solana liquid staking token partnerships, one with Binance, which is obviously the really notable one.
00:48:28.275 - 00:49:24.205, Speaker C: There's also one with Bybit BB Sol that is now live and Bitget as well. And I reported a source close to the matter has told me that there's two more kind of centralized exchange tokens on the way as well. So yeah, I don't exactly know what to make of this. I feel like the my quick where my brain goes is like, wow, you know, Binance has huge distribution. Just look at what Coinbase was able to do with base. If everyone that holds Sol on Binance now with like a couple of clicks can just liquid stake their soul, that probably really increases the amount of soul that's liquid staked, which is currently about 6% of the total, I think of the total stake. Not even of the total supply, if I'm getting that right.
00:49:24.205 - 00:49:35.945, Speaker C: So. So I don't know, what do you make of this move? I guess both like in terms of Sanctum's business, business decision there and then just the broader ecosystem effects.
00:49:36.445 - 00:49:50.105, Speaker A: Yeah. From the Sanctum angle, I think it's the right method to go. I don't know what their business model is. Right. Like, okay, this is great. You have these awesome partners and centralized exchanges to your point have phenomenal distribution. All the users are on their platform.
00:49:50.105 - 00:50:11.667, Speaker A: Makes sense to go after that as a target customer. And seems like that was a mutual feeling because, you know, it sounds like they have quite a few partners lined up and more to come. And so it's interesting that from the Sanctum point of view, I think that's a good approach for like, you know, you put me as the CEO of Sanctum, that's like, that's probably the direction I would move as well.
00:50:11.811 - 00:50:37.483, Speaker C: And if I can cut in, I was chatting with one of the co founders over there and they were basically like, look, you know, we're not as worried about the revenue. Right now, we're worried about distribution and growing this product really, really big, where we're doing partnerships and issuing LSTs on behalf of people. And basically, like, there are fee switches we can turn on when the time comes, but that's just not the priority right now. For better or for worse for them.
00:50:37.659 - 00:51:08.549, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, liquid staking historically has seen pretty poor margins. Like lido, Dow makes 5% in earnings from their. Or, sorry, from their total fees created jito, Dow takes 4%. These aren't like huge numbers. So, like liquid staking, I feel like you do need to get creative if you either offer additional services on top of this. JITO is a great example of that. They're crushing in the MEV space and they're breaking into the restaking space.
00:51:08.549 - 00:51:35.303, Speaker A: So I think that's kind of the angle. You got to take this, and maybe that's how this is. Sanctum's approach is kind of getting a more diverse customer base and then trying to iterate on top of that. I don't think you need to make fees on day one. I get their approach of keep it free and. Or cheap or something close to that, and then, you know, worry about that down the line. But you do run the risk of never being able to figure that out, which we candidly see a lot of in crypto.
00:51:35.303 - 00:52:03.957, Speaker A: And yeah, you do mention the low liquid staking penetration in terms of total stake, it's about 5, 6% somewhere in that neighborhood. And of that, you know, it's called 6%. Jito is rapidly growing continuously. You know, they're at about 50 and change today, percentage. So it's called like 52, 53%. And the sanctum lst crowd, like all of them combined, is growing as well. And so the question becomes, well, who's this at the expense of? And the answer is Marinade.
00:52:03.957 - 00:52:34.989, Speaker A: Marinade. When JITO launched, roughly marinade was about 80% of total stake. And if you fast forward to today, Marinade is, let's see, MSOL is roughly about 20. And so Sanctum and its crew of LSTs plus Jito, I've just absolutely eaten into that market share. It looks like the sanctum LST bunch is roughly about 20% as well. Maybe a little under closer to 15. So they're growing.
00:52:34.989 - 00:52:41.699, Speaker A: And again, these centralized exchange LSTs probably have the best odds of driving their market share.
00:52:41.867 - 00:53:09.727, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, talking to Michael over at Marinade, I get the sense from him that Marinade isn't as interested in the LST business. Their. Their big thing, right? Now is the Stake Auction marketplace and sort of getting people to native stake their soul with Marinade. So. So contribute to the Marinade stake pool, I believe. Stake pool. So I sort of think, like, yeah, you see Marinade's market share declining a lot.
00:53:09.727 - 00:54:06.759, Speaker C: And I think Marinades may be internally okay with that because they're trying to create this marketplace where they're auctioning off their stake kind of and able to pass on a higher yield and maybe they see more potential for revenue there. Obviously, you know, hat tip to the BD guy at Sanctum, whoever you are doing like 5 exchange deals is. It was like surprising to see, honestly, it's a really big kind of haul for them. And it's a, you know, a newer startup that just did their token launch. You kind of wonder, like, what's the second pitch that Sanctum is going to bring out? What's. What's the step two in the company? And I think you're starting to see that. So it's just interesting from a kind of business perspective from Sanctum, like, this seems to be maybe the direction they're going is how big can we grow that lst pie and then maybe turn on a revenue switch down the line.
00:54:06.887 - 00:54:51.571, Speaker A: Yeah, you mentioned the Marinade auction there as well. And this actually, you know, I spotted some like, negative externalities of this because you can imagine this world where, you know, just, I'll try to like, walk through this. So if I was like a malicious sandwich attacker, you know, I would. I can basically control a validator that runs one of these dark undercover MEM pools where it like finds user transactions or receives user transactions and then allows people to sandwich them. So I can control this validator. And then you can also be a searcher that has access to this mempool. And then I can use this SAM module basically to buy stake for my malicious validator so that it's in the leader rotation more often and seeing more transactions.
00:54:51.571 - 00:55:26.685, Speaker A: And then this grows the amount of transactions in this mempool. And then you can basically, because there's more transactions in the mempool, I can attack more. If I can attack more, I make more money. If I make more money, I can use this module to buy more stake from my malicious validator, run my malicious sandwiching operation. And it kind of spins this flywheel of negative externalities that just leads to people getting sandwiched. So I definitely get it. From the Marinade standpoint, it's kind of cool to auction off stake, but of course, the people you auction it to are not always in the best interest of the network.
00:55:26.845 - 00:56:21.573, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, Marinade can test this, but like, frankly I just haven't gone deep enough to have a hard opinion on it. But yeah, if you dive into like the Solana Validator Discord, this is, you know, people are kind of up in arms about this at the moment. Okay, last thing we're going to dive into. I wanted, this is a little bit of a left turn, but I wanted to chat a little bit about NFTs, which is not a thing you hear on podcasts in 2024. But I got thinking about it this week basically just because there was a Solana NFT marketplace called Hyperlane that closed down. I did a piece on it and it just sort of got me thinking a bit about how do you build an NFT business in 2024? Like we're past the kind of zenith in 2021 and crypto prices recovered. NFTs never really did.
00:56:21.573 - 00:57:14.165, Speaker C: And even, you know, you saw Magic Eden sort of roll out some new features and one of them is that you can now swap assets and essentially trade meme coins. And it seems like a little bit of a pivot to say like NFTs just aren't what they were. They're not necessarily coming back. But there are also people that are doing things with NFTs and trying to build businesses in that world. Drip obviously comes to mind, which is sort of doing what Instagram was once going to do with sort of collectible creator content you have super based. Is this like. There was a funny coindesk piece about them with like Soul Jakey is this, this Solana influencer and they're trying to create kind of a lifestyle brand magazine thing and they're acquiring NFT collections as part of that.
00:57:14.165 - 00:57:40.019, Speaker C: But I don't know. There's also three land. I'm friendly with the folks over there, but their philosophy is like, let's have mints that are super cheap. So you can create NFTs maybe as cheaply as you can create a pump fund token, but I don't know. With all those pieces on the table. What do you make of the NFT world, Dan? Is it cooked or is it coming back?
00:57:40.177 - 00:58:19.295, Speaker A: Another one to add to the list here, I think is Zora. They're an op stack built chain on top of Ethereum and it's pretty cool. They try to do a good job of obfuscating away the fact that you're using crypto rails and I think they do a pretty decent job of that. You basically buy what are called sparks and Sparks are just like a fraction of an eth. But sparks sound like Fortnite vbucks, and that's more fun than, you know, away or gwei. So I think they're doing a pretty good job of it. It looks and feels like Instagram, so I think they're kind of going that same direction as Drip in not the same direction, but there's definitely overlap between the two.
00:58:19.295 - 00:59:06.915, Speaker A: And to answer your question, like, do I think they're cooked? I don't know. I think, like, okay, the last cycle of PFP trading gamified nonsense is dead and never coming back and that's for the better. Like, I don't know. I was never really a fan of that. I partook because got to get my itch, that gambling itch that I have every now and then. But no, I just don't think that that was the next iteration of what crypto will be. That said, I think, like, the zoos and the drips of the world, like, yeah, I think there's probably something there.
00:59:06.915 - 00:59:34.983, Speaker A: I don't particularly love it, like, as a consumer, like, it's just not my thing. But that doesn't mean I think it's a bad thing. I think there will be some overlap with Consumer and NFTs. I don't know exactly what that looks like. The ticketing thing is always gets brought up, but that's just seemingly got no traction at all. So it's tough for me to say, like, this will definitely be the next thing. If I had to bet, like, I would just comfortably bet.
00:59:34.983 - 01:00:00.381, Speaker A: No, they're probably not going to be this next wave. I don't know. I guess the maximum Kyle Somani view of blockchains being asset ledgers, does this stuff really make sense? And you can kind of make the argument that, no, none of the consumer stuff does. It's all about finance. And if you look at what drives fees on chain today, it's swapping assets. So, you know, that's what's moving the needle today. And that's kind of like where my personal focus is.
01:00:00.381 - 01:00:04.605, Speaker A: But I try not to dismiss the NFT stuff.
01:00:04.765 - 01:00:53.605, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I, I feel like on a. On one level, I. If you have to pick between meme coins and NFTs, and we did this poll in the, in the newsletter this week. I feel like, I mean, so obviously meme coins are maybe more liquid, more tradable than a crypto punk. But like, I don't know, the idea of community never really took off with meme coins because people just want to turn a Quick bunk, Turn a quick buck and dump on you. But NFTs do have these sort of long term holders that, I don't know, I feel like it is more conducive to creating real community. And so I don't know, like just on a philosophical level, if I had to pick one, I'm almost like why are people not more into NFTs? But yeah, I do.
01:00:53.605 - 01:01:30.849, Speaker C: For better or for worse. Like it, that iteration of it has never really come back. And then I think, yeah, you can think of all of these, you know, real world utility. OKX did this. I don't know if it was NFTs actually, but this, this partnership with Manchester City where you go around and collect these collectibles when you like explore New York City during their Manchester City's New York games. Bait. No, Blackbird lets you mint an NFT on base to join like their coffee club thing.
01:01:30.897 - 01:02:13.621, Speaker A: Okay. The Blackbird stuff is super intriguing and like yeah, so I think it's like section of Blackbird Sora drip. Like there is, there's something there. I don't know what it is, I'm not a consumer expert, but there is, there is something there and I'm very glad that there's people pushing in that direction. But I actually think that that's a salient point you had as well of like the meme coins having, you know, just pvp. I'm going to dump on you first vibes versus some of those OG PFP NFT crews like still chatting. So like what's in the middle of that? Those two spectrums? Like I don't know, maybe that's where like we swung really hard to PFPs and then we swung really hard into meme coins.
01:02:13.621 - 01:02:24.741, Speaker A: Like where is the equilibrium? I don't know. But to the first point, I really do think there's something there on that Blackbird slash Zora slash Drip category.
01:02:24.893 - 01:02:58.427, Speaker C: Yeah. And to bring this back around to Solana, I think something that interested me as I reported out this piece is like Solana really has taken a meaningful lead in terms of NFT volume and users and all these things like it. So just looking, you know, chain users for the last 30 days. This is from NFT Pulse. Great site that I've come across. Solana controls 32% of the chain user share compared to 19% for Ethereum. I know I'm coming dangerously close, Dan, to a.
01:02:58.427 - 01:02:59.283, Speaker C: I was just about to.
01:02:59.299 - 01:03:03.257, Speaker A: Say brother, you just opened up a can of worms. You didn't mean to, but we're going into it.
01:03:03.371 - 01:03:13.501, Speaker C: But okay, but look at, you know, chain revenue the past seven days. Solana is at 30% Bitcoin, 29% ETH, 27%.
01:03:13.653 - 01:03:19.333, Speaker A: The lead is revenue is that, like, driven by, like, transaction fees, driven by NFTs.
01:03:19.509 - 01:03:20.245, Speaker C: Yes.
01:03:20.405 - 01:03:41.475, Speaker A: See, that is a fantastic stat. We're going down this road. You brought it up. Anyways, active addresses are not users. They are not comparable across chains. It costs 2/10 of a cent to be an active address on Ethereum, or, sorry, on Solana, and it costs a couple of bucks to be an active address on Ethereum. Therefore, there is no use in comparing the two because they are not comparable.
01:03:41.475 - 01:03:55.111, Speaker A: Huge. Huge. Yeah, we're just. This is getting worse and worse and worse. And when you say users, it carries a important meaning. Web. Two businesses have been valued off their users, like arpu, or.
01:03:55.111 - 01:04:15.403, Speaker A: The revenue per user is a very important metric in that land. And so you're. When you say these things, not you. I'm speaking broadly. When people say, oh, we have a million users, or. I think the most egregious example of this was one of those. I think it was the Hamster Combat, one of the Telegram apps, but I'm pretty sure it was Hamster Combat.
01:04:15.403 - 01:04:25.451, Speaker A: They literally tweeted out, we have. I don't know what the math is. 70 million users. So the quote, 1% of the world is using our app. Fuck. No. That is not true.
01:04:25.451 - 01:04:39.065, Speaker A: Those are not users. Those are just active addresses. And that doesn't mean users. It is very, very easily gamed. And it is very, very misleading. But so it's like, okay, well, if that's not useful, then what is? The revenue you make. Show me the fees.
01:04:39.065 - 01:04:48.233, Speaker A: Show me the money. That is very useful. And so actually, having a 30% control in of that market where transactions are so cheap on Solana is very meaningful.
01:04:48.369 - 01:05:06.835, Speaker C: The moment those words came out of my mouth, Dan, I knew I was in big trouble. When I. When I tell you that, like, you and Westy kind of just live in my brain because I'll be researching a piece or something and I'll see the active addresses chart, and I'm like, oh, that looks juicy. And I'm like, no, I can't. I can't do it. Where's the revenue? Where's the revenue?
01:05:06.875 - 01:05:29.241, Speaker A: Very impressive stuff. And like, this is not to say there's nothing meaningful with active addresses. You need to take this number and parse it down. So let's say, I don't know. Radium, Radium, Active addresses, Everybody who made this swap through Radium, Okay. Well, again, this is not a very meaningful number. So how do we turn it into one? Well, let's say how about radium power users? And then this is where you can take this any direction you want.
01:05:29.241 - 01:06:08.525, Speaker A: But let's say I define a power user as anyone who makes five trades, at least five trades in a day and does over $10,000 of volume. Then you can filter this top line number of active addresses down to power users and that is how you will get a meaningful number. Now that's kind of a silly example. Like maybe that's not the best description of a power user. But the point is that's all toggleable parameter and that you need to distill active addresses down. And so we do this with like address tagging as well. And so if you know like what transactions are doing on chain, then you can kind of group activity by sector.
01:06:08.525 - 01:06:40.535, Speaker A: So is it finance, is it gaming, is it social, is it anything else, something else consumer? Is it infrastructure? Oracles, bridges, things of that nature. And then you get this more meaningful analysis of what these addresses are doing. And then you can start, you know, okay, maybe these are users. But saying users just carries a ton of weight from the web2world, that does not translate into web3 into crypto. And especially when you go trying to compare these things across chains, you just end up with very misleading conclusions because transaction fees differ across chains. Rant over.
01:06:40.655 - 01:07:03.103, Speaker C: Dan, I foresee a future where you are making this argument for years and I deeply respect you for it. You're, you're, you're going to keep going on this active addresses argument until there's no more. And I just. It's so seductive. But look, that's about all the time we have for today, Dan. It's been a great episode, a very fun roundup. It's.
01:07:03.103 - 01:07:18.827, Speaker C: It's been cool having one of the goats. The person who preceded me as a host come back to the podcast and hopefully we can have you on more times. But best of luck with the newborn back at home. Dan, it's been very fun. Thank you so much for coming on the pod.
01:07:18.971 - 01:07:28.891, Speaker A: Thank you, sir. We'll have to get you, me and Garrett on a roundup one time. Yes, sir. And murder as well. Have anyone who's been a host and have a pow wow reunion, the Lightspeed Council.
01:07:29.003 - 01:07:30.375, Speaker C: I'm looking forward to it.
01:07:30.755 - 01:07:38.995, Speaker A: It's been a pleasure. Jack takes it.
