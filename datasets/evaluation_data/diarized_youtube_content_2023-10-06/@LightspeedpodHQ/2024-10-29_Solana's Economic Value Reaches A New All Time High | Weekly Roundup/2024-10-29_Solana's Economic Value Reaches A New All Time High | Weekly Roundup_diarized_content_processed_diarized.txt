00:00:00.640 - 00:00:40.047, Speaker A: The total economic activity is up, which is counted by, you know, the JITO tips, but also priority fees. The question is, does the chain work still? And so a few things still work really well. The local fee markets actually work way better than before. Transaction landing is much better than it was again in the past six months due to mostly Safeway QoS. Much better, but it's still not perfect. And then one thing that's interesting actually is the sandwich tax have gone down because a lot of the transaction spam has gone down due to sequels. So all in all it's been pretty, pretty good so far.
00:00:40.047 - 00:00:44.275, Speaker A: Probably don't want to jinx it, but good metrics all around.
00:00:44.655 - 00:01:15.375, Speaker B: This episode is sponsored by SEI. The Parallel Execution EVM compatible layer 1 with sub second finality incentives for users are coming to SEI this month from teams like DragonSwap. Start farming on SEI today by visiting DragonSwap app. We'll hear more from SEI later in the show. Hello and welcome back to another episode of Lightspeed. I'm your host Jack Kubenek, joined today by my co host Mirt Memtazz. Mert, how you doing man?
00:01:16.315 - 00:01:17.615, Speaker A: Good sir, how you doing?
00:01:18.515 - 00:02:26.875, Speaker B: I'm well, I'm well. It's been a little bit since we've done one of these and we're doing a little bit of an early week news roundup in a week where there's been a lot going on in the Solana world and that's kind of the place I want to start. Mert is just with this crazy metrics boom we've been seeing the past couple of weeks. I actually just checked before this episode and Solana's rev, the real economic value, which basically just looks at the tips and fees that the Solana Network is generating, shot up to 55 million last week, which topped the previous high of 36 million which a lot of people were posting about and before that it had been like 27 million even at peak. So essentially the amount of tips and fees doubled what the all time high was on a weekly basis over the summer, which is pretty crazy. And Mert it I feel like in your position at Helios you have pretty good visibility into kind of what's happening on Chain. So I'm just curious to get even like a status report like is stuff breaking right now, Our clients having trouble kind of accessing the things on Salana they need to with all the volume or what are you kind of seeing?
00:02:30.375 - 00:03:20.555, Speaker A: Certainly the increased volume is noticeable and it's but I also put another Chart of all the different metrics. And yeah, so the total economic activity is up, which is counted by, you know, the JITO tips, but also priority fees. And by the way, the priority fees themselves are also at an all time high, even if you totally exclude JITO in mev. So when people are like, oh, this is all sandwiches or something, it's like actually priority fees alone are at an all time high. And but like, so, so is like tbl. I mean, TVL is approaching an all time high since, you know, December or the 2022, 2021 season where it could be argued that it was fake cvl. Anyway, so this is perhaps real all time high.
00:03:20.555 - 00:04:12.955, Speaker A: And you know, transaction counts and developer activity is the one I'm most familiar with because obviously our customers are developers and a lot of developers are coming to use Solana. And I also tweet about this and one thing I found interesting was a lot of them are actually from other ecosystems. And so especially in the past two or three weeks, there's been a lot of teams who are kind of just like, yeah, we're looking to expand from EVM and then they need some education on how to understand Solana. And so we're pretty good at that. And we kind of just get them up and up and running. And there's a few other ones that are coming soon, which I don't think I can talk about. But like within the next month I would say there's going to be even more teams migrating.
00:04:12.955 - 00:04:36.185, Speaker A: And obviously there's the hackathon where 1400 plus people submitted, which is, I believe Maddie said it's the biggest crypto hackathon ever by his counts. Like you couldn't find anything else, so that's quite large. And so, and then obviously there's, you know, the AI meme coins and then the regular meme coins and then.
00:04:38.605 - 00:04:38.893, Speaker C: A.
00:04:38.909 - 00:05:31.027, Speaker A: Lot of random activity that I've actually kind of lost track at this point. And okay, so the question is, does the chain work still? And so a few things still work really well. So the local fee markets actually work way better than before. So last cycle, not last cycle, but last six, seven months or something when fees would spike, the fee markets were actually broken. And so it didn't matter how much you increase your fees for your transactions, it landing was still very up the chance. And so people will just set random fees. And now the average fee is actually much higher than the median fee, which means somebody who's competing for a hot spot in like a Jupiter market or like a radium market.
00:05:31.027 - 00:06:21.075, Speaker A: Will pay higher for that market. But if I'm just sending USDC to my treasury account, then it's not as high. And so the fee markets are being isolated, which is pretty good user experience for the most part. Transaction landing is much better than it was again in the past six months due to mostly segway QoS and now it is much better, but it's still not perfect. So one thing that annoys some people is twofold. But the first one is that you can land your transaction, but some traders want it to land within the next like 400 milliseconds and they want to snipe basically. And to do that, that's actually quite difficult.
00:06:21.075 - 00:07:28.085, Speaker A: It's kind of up to chance, unless you use jito, in which case it's up to how much fees you pay. So that part annoys some people. And the second thing is again, the shitcoin volatility. When you let's say you want to buy some new shitcoin that just got released and the price is changing every millisecond and you submit a transaction, it might fail due to slippage and there's a few reasons for that and one of them is just that it's actually quite complex. But like the price that's shown to the user is there's some latency for the apps to actually fetch that price and show it and then by the time they click, okay. It also needs to land within a certain kind of frame timeframe for the slip it should not exceed. So I think people just need to get creative around app level solutions for this, like limit orders or like actually educating the user on what this means.
00:07:28.085 - 00:07:48.405, Speaker A: And then one thing that's interesting actually is the sandwich attacks have gone down because a lot of the transaction spam has gone down due to Segway QoS. So all in all it's been pretty, pretty good so far. Probably don't want to jinx it, but good metrics all around.
00:07:48.945 - 00:08:49.894, Speaker B: I'm interested to hear you attribute the better land rates and the less spam to stake weighted quality of service. Because my understanding was sort of that following April when there was also a huge spike in metrics and the Solana blockchain at that point could not handle it and users experienced dropped transactions and things like that, that essentially there were like patches that were quickly pushed out by Anza and you get like a central scheduler and things like that. Excuse me, but stake weighted quality of service predates that, right? So why would that be the culpable for the land rates being better? During this kind of euphoria, couple of weeks.
00:08:52.674 - 00:09:34.359, Speaker A: When it was first launched, it actually had a bunch of bugs in it and those bugs were causing. And actually there was like, I don't know, maybe five or six bugs that were all contributing to this and like some weird design decisions where you could actually DDoS the network, like forwarding infinitely or not infinitely, but like very. You could basically DDoS network. And there was a certain RPC provider that was doing this and I called them out and nothing, nothing came of it. It's not Helios or Triton, it's a multi chain one. I think everybody can kind of guess. But yeah, around that time there's a lot of bugs within the system.
00:09:34.359 - 00:10:01.695, Speaker A: And so Anza just kind of kept patching them. And I mean, it's still not perfect, right? Like Segway QoS fundamentally is still a band aid, but like now the experience is obviously at least better than it was during that other cycle in the past six months. And there's teams working on like a new quality of service system and you know, like the Temporal guys, even Fire Dancer.
00:10:01.995 - 00:10:07.271, Speaker C: So once that goes live probably within.
00:10:07.343 - 00:10:16.655, Speaker A: A few other, let's say half a year, then secret QoS will be obsolete. And thankfully, because it's not a good.
00:10:16.695 - 00:10:43.693, Speaker B: System, maybe also just conceptualize for us, like, what is the, what is the ceiling for the Solana network? Is it, you know, say we hit 110 million in RV or something and volume just hypothetically continues to really explode? Like what would be the ceiling that would cause things to start to break for the blockchain, in your opinion? Based on where things stand right now?
00:10:43.829 - 00:11:24.897, Speaker A: I actually think if the price went up like 2.3x. Like if salon was at like 500 or 600, I actually think that would be like pretty bad because rent would go high and fear fees would go high and it would probably induce more demand, which would then make the fees even higher. Now the fees would never become like Ethereum, but like as soon as you start getting above like 0.01, let's say dollars in fees, that's I think, too high. And so Solana is talking about increasing block limits, by the way, with Agave 2.1. 2.0 is just rolling out right now, so 2.1
00:11:24.897 - 00:12:21.011, Speaker A: will be the one after that. And so what that means is more transactions per block, which means obviously higher tps, but also more revenue and ideally better UX as well. If it, if the, if the accounts or the blocks are filled properly in terms of what would break it like one of the interesting things is the people who need to land transport actions within like, and they care about the ordering. They use like, a combination of Helios and Jito. But the ones who use Jito, the good thing about that is Jito is technically out of protocol, meaning it wouldn't directly break the protocol like Solana. Now, it can make it work a little worse, but I'm not too worried about that right now. So it's the main problem of Solana's history, let's say.
00:12:21.011 - 00:13:25.631, Speaker A: It's kind of always been the same thing, actually, which is that there's a block leader that produces a block and then it rotates and there's another block producer, and then it just kind of keeps doing that in a known schedule, which is called a leader schedule. And the problem almost always has been some combination of we know who that leader is, so we're just going to send them a lot of shit and then that person is going to get overwhelmed and they're going to stop producing things. With Segway QoS, that goes away. It doesn't go away fully, but it goes away to an extent such that I haven't seen any data yet since it's been live to indicate that it's letting anything through the cracks. But, you know, things can always get crazier. And one thing I like telling people, especially on Solana, is like, don't get too comfortable because there could always be another outage. And people are like, oh, wow, that's crazy.
00:13:25.631 - 00:14:21.095, Speaker A: It's like, it's, you know, I would say another outage is within until the time that Fire answer comes live, which is like, let's say spring 2025 or something. There will probably be another outage, is my guess, because, like, these are systems that are like very, very high scale adversarial conditions that aren't like soaked in testing environments for years. I know some chains take that approach and it's, you know, I think every chain kind of has to make that decision for themselves. But, you know, slowing down shipping is something that we have done. Like Solana has slowed down shipping quite a bit, I would say, to avoid outages. But I would be very surprised if there was not another outage within a year or two.
00:14:21.795 - 00:14:44.005, Speaker B: Hmm, interesting. And, and the argument you've made is that once Fire Dancer comes online, there is no liveness issue anymore because there's multiple clients. So even if the Anza client goes down, Validators can switch to Fire Dancer and the chain doesn't stop producing blocks, essentially.
00:14:45.385 - 00:16:02.855, Speaker A: Technically, it depends on the implementation, like if top 66% of the stake sets up this fallback system where if Fire Dancer starts working, then you fall back to Anza. If they all did that, which is very unlikely, I don't think they would, at least at first, then there wouldn't. But my guess is financier at first does not help with Liveness Finance at first helps with recovery. And what I mean by recovery is if there's like a catastrophic bug, then you can get the network to kind of restart with the new clients in perhaps before it would have taken like, I don't know, 12 hours to find the bug, patch it and all this stuff. But with this you can just switch over instantly and then it's just a matter about how much you can get the cluster to upgrade to that client. And so the recovery time is much shorter, but also the security's improved because I mean fundamentally this is one of the things that people kind of don't understand about Solana, which is that the priority is safety over aliveness. It's kind of how we've messaged it, which is to say that if the network goes down, the reason it goes down is because it says, wait a minute, there's some funky business happening here.
00:16:02.855 - 00:16:33.057, Speaker A: We're going to stop everything so that nothing happens and then we're going to fix it. And so I personally store all my funds on Solana and because I really trust that system of always valuing safety. Now, you know, if you're the type that has levered positions that are at 50x on some per exchange and you're. And the chain goes down. Yeah, that sucks obviously. And so that's something you need to kind of work out the math for yourself. And there's actually been teams.
00:16:33.057 - 00:17:22.714, Speaker A: I got so mad at the outages like code the payments app that they're like fuck this. And they literally just made their app work without Solana being live. They actually tested it during the last outage and you can send payments with, with within the code app when Salon is down because the state channel and then it's just bash post them back when this chain is back up. So it's, it's, it's like a very. People always kind of do this thing where they're like, if a chain goes down that means it's centralized, which from a distributed systems perspective is actually very incorrect. That actually it's, it's slightly related, but it does not imply that in any way. For example, the entire, any decentralized system can go down due to like a low level kind of common shared module in any of these software.
00:17:22.714 - 00:18:38.455, Speaker A: And that's kind of like with the client, it's very obvious because it's software the validator runs, but it'd actually be anywhere in the thing. Like, I forget the exact instance, but like the other day there was a bug in like a JavaScript client or like a virus or something. And like the entire Internet uses those JavaScript modules and the Internet is pretty decentralized, right? And like it doesn't matter how decentralized it is if it's just software and there's a common shared module. And so what Ethereum does is something called an inactivity leak to prioritize liveness. So they have like, let's say four clients, three clients, something like that. And as soon as they kind of detect malicious behavior, they actually start cutting those validators out of the network and reducing the quorum size gradually and gradually and gradually so that the chain keeps running and there's no liveness failure. But the downside of that approach is that there might be like a bad fork or like an inconsistency with the data that you then would have to kind of settle.
00:18:38.455 - 00:18:47.419, Speaker A: And Solana kind of just like says, no, that's not the approach we want to take. So it's. Anyway, I'm kind of just rambling at this point.
00:18:47.547 - 00:19:13.483, Speaker B: The SEI network brought parallel execution to the EVM with their v2 update this past spring. Subsecond finality and massive throughput are now available to EVM developers everywhere on SEI's high performance layer. 1. Incentives for users are coming to SEI this month from teams like DragonSwap. Start farming on SEI today by visiting DragonSwap app. That's DragonSwap app. Thanks again to SEI for sponsoring today's episode.
00:19:13.483 - 00:20:04.267, Speaker B: That's interesting. I didn't really know that difference, that trade off between liveness and safety. I guess maybe to bring this full circle. You had mentioned there's a number of different reasons why activity is up right now. In my own kind of just looking around causally like it seemed like this Goatseus Maximus AI agent meme coin thing, as soon as that really took off and Mark Andreessen tweeted about it, that's when the jito tips and the priority fees all went up a ton. So is that sort of your understanding that it's largely this kind of latest AI meme coin craze that's been driving the split spike in income?
00:20:04.331 - 00:20:22.691, Speaker C: So I've been. Because Dan keeps posting the economic activity chart from Blockworks and he's been kind of posting it for like four, four days consecutively. And so I think like the first one of that was before the AI thing or at least before the newest AI. I think there's like a bunch now. I can't keep track.
00:20:22.883 - 00:20:25.619, Speaker A: But yeah, certainly it's no secret that.
00:20:25.707 - 00:20:39.575, Speaker C: A bunch of it is due to these coins that are. Let's say I actually haven't kept people think I'm like some djen trader or something, but I have no idea what these coins are or what they even called. I heard some goat thing, you know, whatever that means.
00:20:40.035 - 00:20:43.203, Speaker A: And so yeah, a lot of it's due to that.
00:20:43.299 - 00:21:52.795, Speaker C: A lot of these do these telegram bots, which to be I'll be very clear here, some of them do overpay for the fees quite a bit, especially on the non priority fee side. And but what's, what's interesting about that is it actually begets other activity that's more interesting. So we like when this stuff is happening at Helios, we're supporting like basically all of them in a sense like a bunch of them, these telegram bots, these meme coins, these dexes, whatever, Jupiter, all this stuff. And as we support that other teams come in because they see the activity that are like, you know, doing other things like like multi settings or payments or stables and some new deep and stuff, some new social fi stuff. There's a new one called Tribe that Fun time that fun as well obviously. And like it's actually bringing other activity on the chain as well. So in some weird sense the meme coins or at least the activity due to the meme coins is attracting other people to build the non meme coin stuff.
00:21:52.795 - 00:22:30.679, Speaker C: So it's like an interesting loop. But yeah, to be clear, a lot of it is due to the meme coins. Now the one thing I'll caveat that with is people think like oh, the fees are all from sandwiching people and like retail getting fleeced. That is not the case. If you look at the data, the sandwiches are actually a pretty minor part of the mev revenue. And actually people are using the Jito client not to sandwich. Obviously there's like a small percentage of that, but mostly it's to actually do what I said, which is land transactions within an earlier slot.
00:22:30.679 - 00:22:35.795, Speaker C: So it's actually all basically for priority access to the blockchain so far.
00:22:37.055 - 00:23:09.765, Speaker B: Interesting. Yeah. As far as the current meme coin meta, I've been plugged in, I've been following it. I'll be honest, the Original one was this kind of independent bot trained on sites like Reddit and 4chan to just kind of make really edgy Twitter posts. And then it endorses a meme coin. The meme coin is probably near a billion market cap now. I don't exactly know, but it got really, really popular.
00:23:09.765 - 00:23:48.125, Speaker B: And as I've seen this play out, the take I've sort of formed is that, you know, up until now, for the past, like, six months, meme coins have been financial nihilism, right? It's, it's. It rejects any meaning. It's just a picture of a cat. And if people like the picture of the cat, they buy it more. Maybe behind the scenes, there's like, liquid funds that are also propping these things up. Who knows? But there's actually something limiting about just saying, hey, none of this means anything. It's just all a big, you know, gamble that we're all making for fun.
00:23:48.125 - 00:24:45.157, Speaker B: I think the AI agent meme coins, and I appreciated your tweet about this mert, where you were like, we're just rebranding chatbots to AI agents now. But all of the AI bot stuff, it at least claims to, like, have some kind of purpose where it's like, now AI can decide what's a compelling meme and what's not a meme, and you can train it to sort of sift through different meme coins and decide which ones it likes or whatever. I don't know, like, how meaningful this is, actually. But it at least claims to have a meaning which is different from where meme coins were previously. So I think it'll. I think that's why there's, like, such a explosion in interest around trading these things. And if you go on any of the, you know, deck screener type sites that are aggregating, you know, the popular meme coins, it's all like, AI agent stuff.
00:24:45.157 - 00:25:29.853, Speaker B: There's this new thing called Luna Virtuals or something that's a similar project on base, I believe. And I, I think, you know, I would have to think Q1, 20, 25, we're going to see a bunch of these types of projects raising and launching on, in Crypto and probably on Solana, just because it's been such a hugely successful kind of trope. Like, the AI meme coin phase has driven Solana to double the largest amounts of weekly tips and fees it's ever generated. Like, it definitely is a business case that people are going to want to explore more, and it clearly makes a lot of money.
00:25:29.949 - 00:26:01.423, Speaker C: So, yeah, there's A few things I want to perhaps say at a high level about it, just to sum up the topic. One is that so from an engineering and mechanism design perspective, what we care about currently is like, okay, is the chain working? How is it working? What is the user experience? Right, that's what we care about. And in that sense the source of the activity does not matter because you.
00:26:01.439 - 00:26:03.151, Speaker A: Can just swap out the source for.
00:26:03.183 - 00:27:09.395, Speaker C: Some future use case and show that the chain works. And so one of the things that I was really impressed by and one of the things that was a big question was back in the day, this is like 2021, 2022 summer, people would criticize Solana and say, you cannot build a sustainable L1 with low fee transactions, it'd be too cheap and you're basically just losing money the whole time. And so now we've shown that you can actually charge only priority hotspots like AI coins, let's say, but then use that fee to subsidize the lower fee transactions and then still generate a lot of income for the chain, which then makes it interesting because people are then putting more liquidity on chain, but people can also compose with more things. And so it's. We've actually shown that you can empirically build a sustainable L1 with low fee transactions as long as the fee markets are isolated. So that's actually like a pretty big finding in a sense because it's been shown, it's not theoretical. If you look at Dune or I think Blockworks as well, you can see the discrepancy between median and average fees.
00:27:09.395 - 00:27:46.635, Speaker C: And the reason that's important is because, you know, I mean, quick math lesson for. I'm guessing everybody knows this, but like, you know, if you have, let's say 100 transactions and they're all $0.01, but one of them is $100, the average is going to be skewed towards the hundred dollars, right? Like it's going to be skewed towards a higher number. But if 99% of those transactions were less than $0.01, then that doesn't, the average doesn't show you the user experience. Then you look at the median, right? And so those things being like super different is actually a very good sign that means a few markets are working. So that's number one.
00:27:46.635 - 00:28:37.805, Speaker C: And then number two, this is, this is just, let's say more philosophical on my end, which is like whenever I post this chart of like the fees, which is by the way, like, I think of meme coins as basically crypto native gaming in a Sense like the people aping these things are not like damsels in distress. They're not like these innocent, you know, bright eyed people who are like, oh, I'm gonna change the world. No, they're clearly just trying to gamble. Like, obviously, okay, they're trying to have fun, gamble whatever. They know what they're doing, they're not idiots. Like, there's some agency there now, does that mean there's like zero people who don't know what they're doing? It's like, yeah, sure, some people don't know what they're doing, but hopefully they're not using their entire life savings to do things they're not supposed to be doing.
00:28:37.845 - 00:28:38.045, Speaker A: Right?
00:28:38.085 - 00:29:09.583, Speaker C: Like, I think there's like some very obvious common sense here that you need to attribute to the people. And so every time I post these like the fee things, the fee charts, people are like, oh, but like, where is that coming from? Like, you guys are robbing retail and stuff. And it's like, okay, from the perspective of the blockchain, it people are just paying fees to be included in block space. Okay? That's all that's happening. That's how crypto works. It's the same with all chains. I mean, all chains are also trying to do meme coins basically, in a sense.
00:29:09.583 - 00:29:48.605, Speaker C: Like some of them even have meme coin funds. Like Jesse and Brian from Coinbase literally tweet about getting AI coins on their chain all the time. So, you know, spare me kind of the moral conundrum there. But, but the interesting part to me is that there is no agency being assigned to the people actually aping these things. Like, like, these people. I. Nobody goes into something called, like, what was it called, goat or something and, and says like, ah, this is gonna be a really good investment for my children's education.
00:29:48.605 - 00:30:29.075, Speaker C: Right? Like, nobody's doing that. They're like, oh, this is fun, it might go up or something. It's like, sure, okay, that's what's happening there. It's not like they're just being willed against with like a gun to their head to say like, oh, you must invest in this or you're like a scammer. Like it's really the. And then like the quality builders, let's say, get like discouraged in a sense because they're like, oh, like these meme points are this much tension. And like one of the things I really don't like about that framing is like, if you don't like that, that's the use case being leveraged by users.
00:30:29.075 - 00:31:21.927, Speaker C: Build something that they want to use, right? Like them building something that people have used, even if you don't agree with the morals of it, does not mean that if you build something that actually solves their problem, they're gonna be like, yeah, this really solves my problem. Like, I really need to send remittance to my grandma in El Salvador. But there's meme coins on chain and therefore I'll do that. It's like, that's not how it works, right? Like if you build something that solves a problem, like for example, squads, we so multisig, we store some of our treasury within it. I'm not gonna not use squads because there's meme coins like that thinking, really, really it bothers me because it's so incorrect. Nobody's stopping you from building things that people want to use that aren't meme coins, right? Nobody. You can still do it.
00:31:21.927 - 00:31:33.275, Speaker C: And with the local fee markets, your experience is actually not even that much affected. And so you can do it on the same chain. You don't even have the excuse that like, oh, meme coins are making the chain like super expensive. He's like, no, the median is still low.
00:31:34.175 - 00:32:02.925, Speaker B: So anyway, final question on this, Bert. We've been in this kind of meme coin world for quite a few months now. I can remember back when Iggy Azalea first started tweeting about crypto. That was a long time ago. So I'm just curious if over the past six months or however long it's been that we've been in kind of the meme coin world on Solana, has your take on meme coins changed at all or did you always kind of not care for them and you're still in that place?
00:32:06.345 - 00:32:54.929, Speaker C: I made a post a while ago about how, like, I think I probably over intellectualized a little bit, but basically it was like memes have existed for all times really, in some format or fashion, even before the Internet. And so now basically people, it's almost like a prediction market for social memes is kind of how I think about it. It's like if you see a meme and you think it's going to be resonant with people, you can kind of capitalize that and bet on it. So it's like a bet. It's like prediction markets in a sense, which is another great rebrand. And that's kind of it for me now. I think I don't do them right.
00:32:54.929 - 00:33:17.541, Speaker C: Like, I mean, people did like three or four meme points about me, which was like, kind of hilarious. Like they had all these pictures of me and like quote tweets and like screenshots. This one actually my girlfriend has like a, like a murdered. Like one of the things was like, you got murdered or something, just like a sticker of it and like people.
00:33:17.573 - 00:33:18.405, Speaker A: Just hand them out.
00:33:18.485 - 00:34:01.185, Speaker C: So it's like funny. And obviously the trouble starts when like there's information asymmetry. And information asymmetry is like basically just unethical, right? Like, hey, you're dumping on people without giving them full information. So that part is certainly questionable and bad. And ideally there's more analytics tools and better launch mechanisms and stuff. And a lot of these things do go to zero and people kind of use that as like robbing retail. But again, the way I think of it is everybody who's aping these things knows the game they're playing.
00:34:01.185 - 00:34:26.433, Speaker C: Nobody's looking at these as like a long term investment for their endowment or you know, their children's education fund. They're doing it to gamble. Perhaps before they would gamble on horse racing and now they're gambling on which memes will go up. I personally don't care for it. I don't do it myself. I just don't find it interesting. Like, I don't know, it's kind of just boring to me.
00:34:26.433 - 00:34:59.511, Speaker C: To be honest, I actually liked NFTs better because NFTs are like kind of fun. And I'm like, oh, I like the picture, you know, what trait will I get? It was kind of fun. Again, I didn't do that much either. But my thoughts to your original question. My thoughts haven't really evolved on this. I think they're just a form of crypto gaming. And I do hope that the information asymmetry part gets sorted out and launch mechanisms are better and stuff.
00:34:59.511 - 00:35:15.209, Speaker C: You can't just blatantly rug people and that would be nice. I'm not sure how that gets solved. One thing is I don't want the government to tell people what to do about this because it's like, you know, I mean some regulations of force.
00:35:15.257 - 00:35:15.465, Speaker A: Good.
00:35:15.505 - 00:35:31.657, Speaker C: But like, I think there's like a. It's always hard to say what the scope of it should be, but in general I don't use them. I just buy soul or stake with validators. No, that's a lie. I stake with validator, which is mine.
00:35:31.721 - 00:36:18.855, Speaker B: So I was talking to a VC about the goat stuff and I was like, what do you make of it? And he's like, there's two use cases. There's speculation and there's stable Coins. So we've, we've talked a little bit about the speculation. Now I want to get into the stable coins Mert, Stripe acquired Bridge, which is a kind of stablecoin on and off ramp service for businesses including SpaceX I believe for a reported 1.1 billion in equity. We don't know if that was, you know, the deal might have been marked up and worth less than that if, I don't know they were able ever to try to cash out on that equity. But that aside for a lot of money, Stripe acquires Bridge.
00:36:18.855 - 00:36:21.067, Speaker B: Mert, what was your take on this deal?
00:36:21.171 - 00:37:25.605, Speaker C: Yeah, I have a lot of thoughts on this. But fundamentally or overall great kind of sign for crypto because Stripe is arguably, you know, people have like these companies they look up to like Steve Jobs and Apple and Tesla and stuff. I actually like Stripe the most. I think they built a great business and they're basically the backbone of the Internet in some case or some sense in terms of digital payments. And a lot of businesses use them to accept online payments or like we use them actually at Helios and so them getting into stables in a big move and I think the largest acquisition in crypto so far, I believe. So that's a great sign because. Yeah, because not only does Stripe make great products which now will be improved with crypto Rails, but also Stripe is a very well known company, meaning that this now means that fintechs will be looking to stable coins but also web two VCs and then obviously VCs in general will start being more interested in it.
00:37:25.605 - 00:38:51.545, Speaker C: And so it's good kind of attention and you know, Circle is going to go public at some point and so I think stables are kind of going to be like for example, I can actually already pay with stables in, in some parts in the UAE here, which is interesting. And I did like a, a profile with, it's called the national, it's like the Abu Dhabi News Organization and they were actually considering or exploring using stables for like the Durham and using it for like just everyday life and stuff. So like I think the, it'll probably still take some time obviously like this stuff will take a while, but I think it's a really good sign. And then the other part of it is like I hope it encourages founders in crypto to be more like Bridge and less like scammy in that I quote tweet and I said like dear Noobs, this is what an exit actually looks like, right? Which is you build something, let's say you get the licenses, you kind of grind. You build something useful such that governments use it, but also Space X. And then like a great company like Stripe comes and says, hey, you guys are quite valuable. Do you want to join forces? That's an exit.
00:38:51.545 - 00:39:33.745, Speaker C: Not, you know, hey, we're going to release this thing and then we're going to talk shit about all our competitors while doing it. It's not going to be great. And then within two years I'll cash out and fuck you. Right? So that's been a very common case. And so hopefully this gives some hope to like the serious founders in crypto, like hey, this can happen and like paves the road for them and that's the positive. I think it's a really good thing. The libertarian in me is concerned to some extent, which many people disagree with me on this and you know, rightfully so probably.
00:39:33.745 - 00:40:31.935, Speaker C: But you know, stablecoins that are centralized are also not that great in my view because like they're very, very in line with surveillance. So anyone can freeze it, anyone can see what you're doing. It's, it is more efficient engineering wise, systems wise, it's more efficient, better cross border stuff, better, better international stuff, better payments. But now the states have a lot of surveillance over you. So ideally my hope is that there is some decentralized stable in the future. Historically those have not worked. Obviously DAI might be like the only example that's kind of worked.
00:40:31.935 - 00:40:35.583, Speaker C: But that is also my concern.
00:40:35.719 - 00:41:47.735, Speaker B: I had this conversation a bit with Daniel Lev from coinflow last week where I was like how cypherpunk are stablecoins and he's like kind of agreed, like it's undeniable that bitcoin is maybe more in line with these libertarian cypherpunk ideals that crypto was largely founded on. But if you want to get in and out of trading bitcoin, for instance, you need stablecoins to provide the liquidity. So they're kind of like a middle ground. And yes they are, you know, like more to make Trad5 more efficient in a lot of the ways they're conceptualized than into build, you know, a new form of money that's not dependent on governments. Obviously they're generally pegged to the US dollar, but I think there's an argument where, you know, they're a middle ground that you need to get. If like the kind of maximal privacy decentralization is your thing, stablecoins are kind of the thing that get you there. I was just interested in this deal as well, like you said Mert, for the implications for M&A.
00:41:47.735 - 00:43:05.349, Speaker B: And also perhaps for more IPOs in crypto, I think it's a bit of an unspoken thing, a little bit spoken, but that it's not an ideal state of affairs that basically if you're a crypto VC right now, the only way you can expect to see a return on your investment is through a token launch. And it leads to, in my view, a lot of projects launching tokens that maybe shouldn't with kind of like debate, like dubious reasons or utility for the token once it launches. And ultimately like a lot of users of that product get really pissed off and it's a movie we see again and again. And you know, if there was more of an M and A market or more of a kind of chance for companies not named Coinbase or bitcoin mining stocks to ipo, maybe there wouldn't be as much pressure to launch these tokens. VCs would think, okay, I can, you know, exit my equity in a different way than potentially selling tokens. So, you know, we'll see. I don't think it's a guarantee that this means, oh, we're now in an M and A world for crypto or that any of the regulatory obstacles keeping companies from IPO are going to disappear overnight.
00:43:05.349 - 00:43:43.571, Speaker B: But it's at least encouraging in that regard. The final thing is I just am curious why Stripe actually acquired Bridge in the first place. Like, I don't know it. People talk about how on and off ramps aren't really a moat necessarily. Like an argument I've heard is that this all goes to zero over time and just the, the price you pay to on and off ramp stable coins for Fiat just gets competed down to zero. It becomes a commodity. And so I'm curious why what the value Stripe saw in Bridge was.
00:43:43.571 - 00:43:52.975, Speaker B: I'm not inside the company, I can't know. But it seems like they really like stablecoins and maybe felt like they didn't have the staff right now to build this thing themselves.
00:43:54.315 - 00:44:40.863, Speaker C: Well, I think there's a few things and yeah, obviously I'm speculating but like it's more than just on and off ramps. Like Bridge also, you know, helps with issuance movement. But perhaps like, so if they're working with governments in like large treasuries of very large companies, there's a lot of regulatory red tape that you need to get all these licenses for. And like Stripe probably can't do that due to some other regulations. And so I think that's probably what happened there. Like they're like, okay, like we can spend the years required to get these licenses or we can get just a company that has these licenses and you know, like the deal is worth 1.1 billion.
00:44:40.863 - 00:45:09.619, Speaker C: But like, I don't know if crypto people, I mean, actually crypto people probably aren't aware, but like, it's not like you just get the 1.1 in cash and then just leave. But that's not how acquisitions work. It's still like, generally, maybe it's equivalent to the bank balance that you had for the first part and then there's some vesting for the rest of the four years and then you still have to work for Stripe that whole time. So anyway, a couple more rapid fire.
00:45:09.667 - 00:45:42.197, Speaker B: Topics I want to get into for today's episode. One is something I'm keeping an eye on and that's mobile apps. Crypto generally has been interested in mobile for some time because it's, you know, where most people access the Internet most often. But it feels like, okay, now we're in a period of time where, especially in Solana, these map, these apps are actually seeing the market. It's not just a talking point. So Bird Eyes app is coming very soon. Cubes app is coming this week.
00:45:42.197 - 00:46:01.635, Speaker B: Drip is coming in December. There's probably others that I'm forgetting. In this list we just saw a Jupiter app. Obviously the new Solana phone is coming out. So Merck, how do you feel about mobile apps? What is the benefit of these things coming to market and do you foresee them growing the pie, so to speak?
00:46:01.715 - 00:46:43.945, Speaker C: In crypto, all apps that are consumer focused need to have mobile strategy things to be mobile first. That's a given. Most people are just on their phones. And one thing I've noticed with myself at least, is that I almost exclusively use crypto through just the laptop and the desktop and not necessarily anything to do with any phones. And like that makes things quite a bit more annoying. And maybe that's a skill issue. I mean, it probably is to some extent, but like the discoverability of these apps isn't great because there's not that many and the experience is generally not that great.
00:46:43.945 - 00:47:49.997, Speaker C: But like, I think it's a net, certainly a net positive that people are starting to think more mobile first because like, you know, if I just open my phone right now and I look at my apps, right? I have a mobile banking app, I have a mobile ride sharing app, Perplexity mobile, Twitter, you know, Instagram, email, everything is kind of mobile first messaging except for the thing that my career is based on, which is crypto. So that's kind of weird, I think with. Oh, and I actually also have code which is like the payments app for Solana. But the problem is everybody else needs to have it on their mobile for me to kind of take advantage of it to some extent. And then I do have a wallet here, a Coinbase wallet from when I used to work there actually. And they have like this explorer built in to, you know, explore things within the wallet. And so I think it's.
00:47:49.997 - 00:49:07.455, Speaker C: I don't think we've quite figured out the UX for mobile that well yet because it's, you know, anytime you go from something not existing to it existing, there's always these weird spots where you have to figure it out. But. And you know, I teased totally about like, hey dude, like why the fuck are you working on this phone? You kind of need to fix the L1, you know, it's still pretty broken, but I think they sold like 200k phones or something. And granted probably a good amount of those are like one person has like five or something, but if you can even increase that number by like 50k, like the number of users with phones and like a good mobile app store for crypto apps, you don't need much. Like one of the things I like about that's interesting about crypto is it's not like traditional web2, where you need like a billion users on the platform to make it good. Like with the network effects with crypto you can even just have 10,000 people and then it can still be a valuable app because the capitalization levels are much, it's much easier to capitalize 10,000 users in crypto than a billion users in Web2. So perhaps it doesn't need to be that many people.
00:49:07.455 - 00:49:28.843, Speaker C: I think the developer experience probably isn't that great. So that's why we're seeing a lot of, let's say, lag there. But then also the app store models are really bad from what I understand. Like people are just getting fleeced with these fees. And I think Ethereum also released a phone or something. I saw some things about it.
00:49:28.939 - 00:49:30.095, Speaker B: Yeah, I've seen that.
00:49:30.795 - 00:49:32.535, Speaker C: What is that about? Did you look at that?
00:49:33.395 - 00:50:17.209, Speaker B: It's not a phone, it's. I think, I think it's more of like a souped up mobile wallet that you can also maybe access the Internet on. I don't, I don't really know. It doesn't look like it's very close to market, I would say, but very surface level. Have looked into this thing, but I think that's sort of what the Solana Seeker could become. Because I think, at least in the current world, with this next phone, I don't foresee a ton of people going the, what was it? Matt Siegel from Vaneck, who told us that he uses it as primary phone. I don't think a lot of people are going to do that, but I think there's a world where people have their iPhone or something and then they also have their crypto phone that they do crypto stuff on.
00:50:17.209 - 00:51:05.937, Speaker B: And there's a lot of incentive for crypto apps to build on the Solana Dap Store, they're calling it, with the, you know, Apple famously charging a 30% tax on transactions and Solana charging a 0% tax. Like that's a huge difference. And that's the sort of, like, the sort of discrepancy is what I think it would take for the Solana phone to see like meaningful adoption. Obviously that's from the developer side, from the user side. We'll see. I think another thread I'd look at too is Telegram apps. Telegram is arguably the most successful crypto mobile app.
00:51:05.937 - 00:52:00.325, Speaker B: I guess the Coinbase app, you'd also have to put that up there. But Telegram has really good product market fit. It had tons of users playing these tap to play games. Even the like, head of the Iranian military was commenting on Hamster Combat and how it was being used to kind of spread Western soft power or something like this. So, you know, Cube is launching an app on Telegram and I was chatting with Bartage over there and he was like, yeah, it's, you know, you don't have to deal with kind of the Apple App Store regulations and requirements and you already have a huge crypto native user base, so. And Telegram has some kind of native app store built in. I don't know if they take 30% or not, but I would think that you'd start seeing more mobile apps built within Telegram as well.
00:52:01.865 - 00:53:01.993, Speaker C: Yeah, that's actually one of the most common pitches I get, which is like Telegram, but also WhatsApp apps. Basically. WhatsApp is like huge in this part of the world now that I moved into Dubai. Like, people just, I, I bought some Zins the other day and I just gave the guy some soul and he's like, sure, really interesting one, like random thought is, you know, so, okay, I like what SUI is kind of trying to do, which is they're like this little PSP kind of gaming device and it's like, yeah, so first, I'm not sure exactly how that works, but like, I, I think what would be interesting is like trying to create a category instead of trying to replace an existing one. So like Kindle is probably a good example, which is like a Kindle is not meant to replace your phone. It's meant to be a new way of reading. And it's just black and white or the new one, actually there's a colored one, but it's black and white.
00:53:01.993 - 00:53:51.701, Speaker C: And it's just for reading, just that. And it is a mobile device in that it is mobile. You can bring it with your places and you know, it's kind of the same with like a Game Boy or like, you know, you remember those Tamagotchi things, like the little device things. I actually think that could be more fruitful where it's not like a replacement for a phone, but it's like its own category of device where you just kind of bring it along with you. Like a ledger in a sense, like a Kindle or like one of those, you know, now there's those remarkable tablets or something like that where you just take notes. I actually think that's probably how it would actually make meaningful impact because like you are just not going to replace Apple. It's just.
00:53:51.701 - 00:54:07.825, Speaker C: Yeah, I look, I'm like the most optimist person ever, but like that is a fucking hard thing to do. So, you know, I think that could be interesting. Just a new category defining device.
00:54:08.565 - 00:54:10.225, Speaker B: What do you think about glasses?
00:54:12.685 - 00:55:11.799, Speaker C: Oh, I actually like them quite a bit. I was a big fan of Google Glass even back in the day. I think Zuck is Zuck, like recently announced they're like kind of mixed reality stuff and like it took them like eight years to develop it or something and obviously it's not perfect but like I think within like three, four years, like some iterations that stuff is going to be quite interesting because like I have the Quest or I used to have the Quest, the Meta Quest 2. Well, it used to be called Oculus, which is a much better name. Um, and that's actually like pretty fun. Uh, I actually quite liked using it. And if you can take that and like bring over some of the experience to glasses, I think that's like still my like first three startup ideas were all within that space, which is like virtual reality ar and like I had these ideas in high school and so like the tech wasn't there.
00:55:11.799 - 00:55:44.455, Speaker C: I had this idea where you could like virtually try on clothes so that you know, they would fit without shopping for them online, like and just getting, you know, wrecked and you have to return and all this. So I Even had the idea for like, I don't know if you've seen like the IKEA stuff, but, like, you can just take a picture of your room and then it turns into like a virtual reality place and then you can kind of put together the furniture virtually. I actually think that stuff is going to become more and more important over time, so. I love the glasses.
00:55:45.835 - 00:55:57.091, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm. I haven't like, gotten a chance to, to try on any of them, but you should have, man. You should have taken these to market. You could have sold to Ikea. You'd be a. Be a very rich man, probably. I don't know.
00:55:57.091 - 00:56:03.295, Speaker B: I don't know how that tech got developed or what it was, but Palmer Lucky is doing quite well, I guess.
00:56:04.795 - 00:56:06.083, Speaker A: Yeah, it was just this weird thing.
00:56:06.099 - 00:56:11.591, Speaker C: Where I'm like, oh, I'm just in high school, whatever. Like, I can't actually build a business. Looking back, that was stupid. I probably should just done it.
00:56:11.623 - 00:56:45.995, Speaker B: But I guess, Mert, I'll just ask you to like conclude the show. You know, we've talked a bit about meme coins as a driver of a lot of the Solana volume, but there's also been a lot going on recently with, you know, the radar hackathon, I think just finished submissions. You're in the UAE now, kind of doing super team stuff there, I guess what's just like, give me like something you're interested in or some kind of cool new app that you're excited about seeing coming to Solana or being built right now.
00:56:46.115 - 00:57:34.955, Speaker C: So my answer to this, I don't think has changed in the past year almost, which is social fi. I just, I really do think it's the most interesting thing to build in crypto right now. Personally. Like, I don't think it's objectively, but subjectively the most interesting thing because once again, social media network effects are basically impossible to break. But with crypto, you've seen that adding some capitalization to it in some regard. It doesn't have to be like, you know, pay to play or pay to earn or something, but it could even just be like, what was that new thing that just got released? Well, there's tribe that fun on Solana, which is, you know, seems interesting, has some traction. Davs fun also has the social elements as well.
00:57:34.955 - 00:58:33.031, Speaker C: And time fun is also coming to Solana and that has a social element. And the reason I think that's interesting is because actually the mobile point, which is that people who do social go on their phones and if there's a mobile element or like Telegram and Solana, like does have a strong social layer rights. That's arguably one of the most or one of the strongest aspects of it, which is that because everybody kind of has the same understanding and mutual understanding of the community and the like, you saw Breakpoint. Breakpoint was quite large, but also quite unified and like exciting for most people. And so you combine all those things and I think there's a really interesting opportunity there. I don't think it's like a group chat that you have to pay to enter. I don't think that's the thing.
00:58:33.031 - 00:59:31.263, Speaker C: But I think there's a lot of interesting ways you can like tap it back into Twitter or Telegram and then start mixing this data. And I think that's interesting. And then second, I've seen a lot of pitches over the past few weeks about like AI, obviously. So, you know, there, there is a world in which like using text or voice or whatever to somewhat simplify on chain actions, but also even maybe development such that the accessibility is higher. I think that would be interesting. But, you know, if I could just pick the next big app, then I would probably just build it myself. So this is, this is kind of hard to kind of reason about.
00:59:31.263 - 01:00:15.351, Speaker C: But what I would use personally, which I've said this a bunch of times and somehow it doesn't exist. I don't know how, which is very simple. I get thousands of DMS per week. I have to like keep clearing all my inboxes, all that I need. And like totally would use this and a lot of other people will use. This is like some paid email or message forwarding service where you say, like, okay, I'm going to pay this person $1 or $5 and then I can ask them for like pet check help or some Solana research help or something like that, such that I can actually go and manage my connections and my messages and my agenda. And with crypto it's super easy.
01:00:15.351 - 01:00:38.153, Speaker C: You just, hey, give me one usdc. And it's not about like us making the money. It's more so that it acts as a filter such that you, you like. Because people just will spam anything. And so if they want to be more careful about what they say, such that it respects both their time and like the reader's time, that's like a very simple app. I don't know why it doesn't exist. I would use the shit out of that.
01:00:38.153 - 01:00:39.845, Speaker C: So somebody should build it.
01:00:40.145 - 01:01:02.633, Speaker B: You heard it here first. Someone go build it. Well, look, it's been a good episode, Mert. We've covered a lot of ground and good to get back on the other side of the mic from you doing a roundup episode. So it's been a good time and we'll see you in the next one. This episode would not have been possible without the SEI network. Don't forget user incentives are coming to SEI from teams like DragonSwap.
