00:00:00.440 - 00:00:17.185, Speaker A: The question that I ask isn't, hey, are you going after a Web3 user? You know, non Web3 user? The question I ask is like, who is the target market for what you're building? And so it's less about choosing one of these dichotomies in a vacuum and it's more about what is the actual problem you're trying to solve and who has that burning need.

00:00:44.205 - 00:01:13.559, Speaker C: Hello, and welcome back to another episode of Lightspeed. We're super hyped today to have Iman from Solana Labs leading the Solana incubator over there on the podcast to chat about the second cohort of the Solana incubator applications recently opened. That's going through October 4th, I believe. And. And you're in the office where it's going to happen, right? That's where you're filming from right now.
00:01:13.727 - 00:01:26.715, Speaker A: Yep. Thanks for having me, Jack. Yes, I'm in the New York office right now and yes, October 4th is the application deadline. So I'm really looking forward to having the next cohort in this space starting.
00:01:27.795 - 00:01:34.955, Speaker C: Great. Well, yeah, so if you're watching on YouTube or Spotify and this office looks like a good time, that's where it'll be.
00:01:35.035 - 00:01:35.227, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:35.251 - 00:02:35.615, Speaker C: Iman, thanks for joining. Excited to have you today and just get to talk about the first incubator cohort and maybe just philosophically a little bit, the way you look at the startup landscape on Solana, things like that. Very excited to have you. So I'm going to just start broad here and maybe a little bit devil's advocate, but in the past I've heard the argument made about incubators that it's not really a good use of time if you're a founder because you could just go and spend those three months or whatever doing things yourself that would launch your startup, that would get you headed in the direction that you want to head. So maybe just convince me or give me the best pitch you can for why founders who only have so much money, only have so much time, should take three months of their of their lives and go through the Solana incubator.
00:02:36.515 - 00:03:42.017, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a great question. I think the important point with that question is that it's not like they're stopping progress on their company for those three months to go through a program. I think there are programs out there and you know, there are some accelerators out there where it is very programming heavy, where hey, we're going to teach you how to be a founder, how to go out and raise capital and some of these more kind of educational elements where it doesn't feel like you're actually making concrete progress on your company. Whereas we chose the name Incubator very intentionally, where we're working hands on with four to six companies in the space, we're actually building and growing their companies alongside these teams to help them succeed. And so the way we think about it is, you know, this is going to be the most intense three months of your company's existence where we're really going to have sort of a boot camp style experience where we're pushing forward on, on all fronts. And so I think that's, that's part one of it. The second part of it and you know, getting into being here in New York is there are just some of the best minds in the Solana ecosystem here in this building.
00:03:42.017 - 00:04:51.975, Speaker A: So not only do we have Solana Labs, Solana foundation on working out of this building, we also have folks from various ecosystem teams. Whether it's Drift dialect, Tiplink, we have amazing VCs who come in and out of this, this building as well. And so it's putting you at the nexus of the ecosystem where you can get support from, from sort of all of these different channels and meeting you where your needs specifically are. And this is where the other element of the Incubator comes in where you know, you have all of the traditional Y combinator type elements like weekly dinners and speaker events with amazing founders and one on one mentorship. But then on top of that, the most important facet of the program is actually working with you ad hoc around whatever those needs your team is, is facing at that week. So maybe one week you're working through a go to market strategy and we sit down with you heavily during that week and pan that out together maybe the next week you're thinking through, hey, is this user experience flow streamlined enough from a design perspective? Our designers get in there and figma with you and leave comments. So it's actually that building alongside experience to really spearhead your company forward during these three months.
00:04:52.675 - 00:05:12.493, Speaker C: Yeah, speaking of the building, I'm interested to get into that as well because to my understanding A lot of the Solana stuff that goes on is out in sf and when Solana Labs was initially raising and things like that, it was an SF company. So why did you decide to base it in New York rather than sf?
00:05:12.669 - 00:05:38.755, Speaker A: So I think New York is just such a huge hub of web3 today. Even just in terms of count of people who are coming into this office versus San Francisco office. I mean, San Francisco office is amazing as well. But we just felt like the activity that was happening here, once again, the VCs that are in the ecosystem, the different teams building out of New York, it really creates sort of a flash point for all of these folks to come together and work to push these teams that are in the program forward.
00:05:39.495 - 00:05:51.475, Speaker C: I have to say. So I came down and visited the building a few months ago, back when like sanctum and Cohort 1 was in there. You had a very chill doorman. Do you have the same doorman these days?
00:05:52.055 - 00:05:58.745, Speaker A: Jose is great. Unfortunately, last week was his, his last week here. He went on to broader pastures, but yeah, he's amazing.
00:05:58.935 - 00:06:05.725, Speaker C: Well, best of luck to Jose. Whatever his next thing is. He may. He made my day. I was running late. I was all sweaty. It was, it was a tough day.
00:06:05.725 - 00:06:07.349, Speaker C: But super chill guy.
00:06:07.477 - 00:06:14.545, Speaker A: Yeah, we gave him, we gave him a great sending off. Yeah. So he was, he was wonderful. We're all going to miss him.
00:06:15.125 - 00:06:40.965, Speaker C: I'm glad to hear, I'm glad to hear he got his due. So. Okay, so we've talked a little bit like vaguely about why the incubator is important, why you need one. I'm curious about. Well, okay, actually, let me start here. So you came on Lightspeed back in November, I believe it was before I was hosting. And you just talked a little bit in theory about what the Solana incubator was going to be.
00:06:40.965 - 00:06:59.745, Speaker C: Now you have 10 months or so of experience. How has your understanding of what the purpose and kind of the benefits of the Solana incubator are, how is that different from what you came on and said back in November?
00:07:00.085 - 00:07:46.819, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a great question. And to be honest, I don't know if this came across in, in the interview or not last, last November. We were still really figuring out what the program was at that time. You know, we didn't know whether it was going to be in person or virtual. We didn't know exactly how many teams, how we, how we were going to have the teams coalesce together. So I think first off, in terms of the actual substance of the program, that is obviously materialized a Lot more now that we've done one cohort, you know, it is, it is in New York, it's three months, January to April, relocation, stipend for four teams who decide to come on board. I think the other big one, having gone through a cohort of it, a lot of the things we expected to happen happened, thankfully, where we saw the benefit of building alongside these teams and the success that they could have.
00:07:46.819 - 00:08:44.373, Speaker A: We saw the benefit of bringing everyone together and getting them the mentorship and the VC support and whatnot. I think the piece that was most unexpected and the biggest pleasant surprise was how important the camaraderie within the actual cohort was. You know, when you bring in the top founders from across the ecosystem, have them work out of the same office space day in and day out, obviously relationships, friendships, bonds start to form between all of these different teams and then there's a deep desire to actually help and support one another, where maybe someone has expertise in an area you're not familiar with, you grab a conference room and jam with them on that specific topic. Maybe, you know, a designer has a different viewpoint on how to approach a specific flow and they give you some insight and tips there. So I think the cross cohort support camaraderie really created this family environment for, for the batch that has lasted to this day. You know, break points right around the corner. We're all getting together there.
00:08:44.373 - 00:08:51.305, Speaker A: We have Slack channel, telegram channel. Everyone's still pinging each other. So I think that's been the biggest pleasant surprise on my end.
00:08:52.925 - 00:09:26.391, Speaker C: Yeah, that is cool. I feel like the in person element of it is important and it seems like the crypto world generally is getting more interested in that. You had vital retreat in Montenegro that I'm forgetting the name of it. You have like Edge City is this new kind of techno village people are coming up with. I think crypto is a very remote first, you know, largely anonymous kind of ecosystem. But I also think that the in person stuff is, you know, at the end of the day becomes really important.
00:09:26.583 - 00:10:03.065, Speaker A: And, and it just makes it easier to get support around the things you need. Like, and this is where the build alongside piece comes into play more as well is when you have a challenge, if you had to reach out to someone, set up a zoom call three days from now, like, inevitably, either you're going to find another path around that challenge or you're going to get that, that insight too late. Whereas when you literally can just tap someone on the shoulder or come to me and say, hey, Iman, this is what I Need support around, I can go up to that person in the office. Hey, are you willing to jam with this team really quickly? It just, it allows you to iterate so much more quickly as a, as a company and get past those roadblocks much more efficiently.
00:10:03.605 - 00:10:33.627, Speaker C: And it feels like there's a little bit of this. There's a minimum amount of importance for a Slack message. I felt this when I was starting out at Blockworks even. There needs to be a question if you're going to reach out and ping someone on Slack. But if you're in the office, you can just chat about nothing. And sometimes that's actually where really cool ideas or breakthroughs I'm sure for these startups happen. So Cohort one, looking through it, some of the names you had.
00:10:33.627 - 00:10:36.763, Speaker C: Sanctum, of course, Shagga, if that's how you pronounce it.
00:10:36.819 - 00:10:38.627, Speaker A: Chaga, Shagga, Shaga.
00:10:38.691 - 00:11:10.025, Speaker C: Okay. Espresso, Cash, zbit, Juicer, Armada, I guess Meme Royale. I want to get into that as well, because I think that was maybe like a mid cohort pivot type thing, but just looking at that list of names, it sounds like a lot of apps rather than infrastructure, perhaps. I'm curious if that was a conscious choice and if you're going to make sort of similar decisions as you're choosing Cohort 2, or maybe just broadly what kinds of startups you're interested in having in the incubator.
00:11:10.325 - 00:11:46.473, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a great question. I would say, Both for Cohort 1 and for Cohort 2, we didn't have a specific mandate around a vertical of choice that we're going after. Our goal with the program is really to create the next blue chip companies on Solana. You know, how do we have the next Jupiter graduate out of this program? For Core one, I'd actually say it was a mix. I think Sanctum, you know, it's powering liquid staking infrastructure. Armada is doing a bunch around defi infrastructure as well. And so it wasn't predominantly a focus of ours to have more apps as part of the cohort.
00:11:46.473 - 00:12:15.505, Speaker A: Rather, I think the big thing we look for in who we support is do we have really incredible technical founders who we think can be the core pillars of our ecosystem 12 months down the road. And if we see that technical success in the founding team, if we see a bit of traction, if we believe what they're working on will be for the benefit of the ecosystem as a whole, that's where we'll say, hey, we're really excited about these folks and we want to dive in deeper.
00:12:15.975 - 00:12:35.675, Speaker C: Mm. And so I'm also curious, before we maybe just get into chatting about Cohort 1 a little bit, does Solana Labs make venture investments? I know that's kind of what Y Combinator does. Is there a similar thing at play here? Or. I guess, what's the business case for Solana Labs to be running this incubator in general?
00:12:35.975 - 00:13:01.583, Speaker A: Yeah. So we have. For teams that are interested in fundraising support, we have Solana Ventures that sits within Solana Labs. And so they'll also obviously take a look at each of these teams. But the reality also is that for a lot of these teams, they might not need fundraising. You know, for. For, I think maybe half of the cohort, when they came in through the program last time, those weren't teams that were looking for fundraising at that moment.
00:13:01.583 - 00:13:34.915, Speaker A: Instead, they were what we consider coming into the program for the right reasons, which is the kind of building alongside accelerating the progress of the company. Obviously, if capital is a constraint for these teams, both through Solana Ventures or any of these other capital providers in the ecosystem, we can go out and help the team raise around. But predominantly our. Our focus isn't to fund these teams. It's to really accelerate the progress of these teams. And we look for teams that aren't doing the program just for the funding, but rather for all of these other resources and services we're providing.
00:13:35.665 - 00:14:02.415, Speaker C: And the reason why Solana Labs is providing those resources is that because to my understanding, Solana Labs now sort of is a software company that develops things like gameshift like Solana Mobile to use the Solana blockchain to do. To build other businesses, I suppose. So I'm just curious, from a business perspective, why is it beneficial to Solana Labs to be doing an incubator later?
00:14:02.715 - 00:14:30.475, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think there's. There's two hats to. To put on. One hat is sort of the ecosystem hat, where within Solana Labs, everything we're doing is still to try to push for the Solana ecosystem. And so if we can actually help, you know, get the next Jupiter onto Solana and help them get up to speed more quickly, that's a. That's a huge win for us across the board. The second half, though, you know, the way that I like to think about Solana Labs is kind of a portfolio of different assets.
00:14:30.475 - 00:14:57.285, Speaker A: So, yes, Solana Mobile, Game Shift, they're. They're a part of that portfolio, as is the full ventures portfolio, and now as is the incubator portfolio as well. And so the focus there is really just pushing for the ecosystem across this portfolio, whether it's companies internally that we're building out or whether it's existing ecosystem teams within ventures or with an incubator that we're trying to support.
00:14:58.835 - 00:15:20.015, Speaker C: Yeah, that makes sense. So I want to get a little bit into Cohort 1. Maybe I'll start generally, what is it that was the biggest challenge that you found that was keeping these founders from getting their startup wherever they wanted to go?
00:15:20.875 - 00:16:16.291, Speaker A: Yeah, I think coming into Web3, there's such a focus of. Let me get the Web3 mechanics right, which. Which obviously is a really important focus. How do I write a smart contract effectively? How do I get the right Web three implementation pieces in place? How do I create the right incentivization structure for the users that are coming to my platform? But in that process, I think some of the core Web two elements al almost of, you know, finding the user base that has the most critical need for this, distilling the value proposition to what the needs of that target market are, creating the smallest possible MVP to go to go out and attract that user base. Those are the pieces that I think can sometimes be almost paradoxically trickier in a way. Obviously, there's so much glass we chew to get a product up within. Within Web3, but that ends up taking up, you know, 95% of the focus.
00:16:16.291 - 00:17:16.160, Speaker A: Whereas our belief is, you know, to build a successful company. Yes, product matters, it's a huge part of it, but distribution also matters. And marrying those two together to create the right distribution channels, to create the right funnels for the user base, and to create the product that that user base actually needs is crucially important. So actually, what we did when we first started with, with the program was we spent almost like 2 hours per team per initial meeting understanding their business, understanding why they made the decisions that they did, understanding why their value propositions are the ones that they are. And oftentimes what you saw was what was once maybe three different value propositions for three different target markets, getting distilled into one specific one or, hey, you know, we had this, this long roadmap that required five different products. Actually, this is the one we want to go after for these reasons after doing user interview or quantitative testing. And so really distilling in on the, the.
00:17:16.160 - 00:17:28.484, Speaker A: The core message, the core product, the core market that they're going after and the ways in which they hook into that. That market, I think was probably the biggest thing we did with, with each team early on.
00:17:29.064 - 00:17:41.355, Speaker C: Do you. Do you. Just from where you sit, do you think there's a way to successfully launch a project on Solana in 2024 and achieve distribution without having a token attached in some way.
00:17:41.855 - 00:18:53.595, Speaker A: I definitely think so. You know, tokenomics are a great incentivization mechanism for, for folks to pay attention to the product, to get eyeballs on on the product. But I don't think they're, they're the sole element that you need to build a successful company. And in fact I think Espresso Cash is a good example of this where Espresso Cash was targeting hyperinflation within Nigeria and essentially using USDC based cash accounts and remittances and P2P payments to help Nigerians hedge against the rapid inflation in the Naira via leveraging a more stable currency. And when you look at Espresso Cash, that's a business where off the bat they got these financial rails, this financial infrastructure that would take years and years and years for them to build themselves. But by virtue of having Salon in place, they can build on top of that infrastructure build still a really strong business from the standpoint of Core Web2 Economics without actually needing to leverage a token. And so I don't think a token needs to be the be all end all for four products operating within Web3 by any means.
00:18:55.375 - 00:20:08.765, Speaker C: So I guess how do you approach that question though? Because clearly just in today's world investors really like to have a token because not many crypto startups at all have IPO'd and teams like the token as well, because it's sort of just another form of equity that they can have. So I guess what's your if an incubator startup were to come to you and say, hey, we're thinking about launching a token, there's not a super clear use case for it necessarily, but we think it would help with go to market or whatever. What's your advice to them? And I guess I'll just preface this by saying that on this podcast and elsewhere I voiced some skepticism about token launches because they can perhaps incentivize a little bit of short termism where it draws a lot of users and interest to your project in the short term. But if a lot of your users are getting burned by, you know, these low float high FTV tokens, does that disincentivize kind of long term, more dedicated user base? So, so just with that disclaimer as to my own priors, I'm curious sort of how you go about advising projects on that question.
00:20:09.105 - 00:21:32.619, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a question that we've actually gotten from from projects in Cohort 1 Franklin and my answer is the same now as it was then, which is that, you know, launching a token sucks. It's so hard to do. You have to get so many pieces and mechanics right that really for most Web3 businesses, and there are exceptions to this, but I think for most web3 businesses it's something you do once you've hit that quote unquote, Web three product market fit, once you've actually established your company, you have users, you have traction. At that point, if you think that a token helps you create the right incentive mechanisms or it allows you to decentralize the project in the right way, then you know, by all means we can, we can have that conversation and see whether it makes sense otherwise for companies who are kind of like, hey, I'm struggling to get distribution, let me launch a token and that'll be my key to getting users. I think for the most part that rarely, rarely works for a lot of the reasons that you described. You get short term, more mercenary users, but it doesn't actually create that longer term retention. And frankly a lot of the companies that have that mindset, it's almost like as a replacement for doing the true product development work, which is doing, doing the iteration of target market, of user, of product, of understanding what the core problem is that you're going after.
00:21:32.619 - 00:22:18.171, Speaker A: And that's kind of a lot of what we do at the incubator is like almost a back to the basics approach of hey, you know, yes, a token is great, I'm sure you would love to launch a token, but we sort of know that that's not going to lead to the retention you guys are hoping for. And so how can you find, can we find that retention and that engagement through more sustainable mechanisms? So in large part I agree with the viewpoint. Obviously there's certain businesses where a token is more fundamental to sort of the operations of the business. DePin comes to mind as a potential example of that. But in large cases, I think the emphasis on a placement, emphasis on a token is misplaced when the intent is to spark user interest in your product where you don't have it already.
00:22:18.363 - 00:23:00.025, Speaker B: Fragmentation is a big problem for Ethereum, but also for the subscription industry. We all know the pain of tracking which subscriptions you're paying for and the hassle of trying to cancel them. Well, Access Protocol is here to help with a new way to consume content via staking.

00:23:30.239 - 00:24:29.185, Speaker C: Rodney, I would agree. I'm curious to speaking of, I guess, projects that launch tokens, I'm curious to hear just looking at Cohort 1, the project that maybe has the most mind share in the current world, not sure how things will unfold in the months and years to come, but right now, perhaps the project from Cohort 1 that most listeners would be familiar with, if they're just casually in this line, it would be Sanctum, which is this kind of liquid staking business. Just recently announced that they'll be helping Binance and Bybit and Bitget as well as two others I am told that are not public yet. A lot of exchanges basically helping them launch their liquid staking tokens. They also have their own INF liquid staking token. Folks are likely as familiar with them. So I'm just curious from your perspective to maybe just get a little bit of the inside scoop of what it was like having Sanctum in the cohort.
00:24:29.185 - 00:24:39.685, Speaker C: Obviously they experienced a lot of growth during those kind of months that they were in Cohort 1, and so I'm just. Yeah, what was the story there? What was that like?
00:24:39.985 - 00:25:38.279, Speaker A: Yeah, so Sanctum is actually a team that we've been familiar with for a while, probably a year before the incubator happened. We wanted to do more around liquid staking infrastructure on Solana. We were familiar with a team called Unstake It. This was Sanctum pre Sanctum and so started, you know, getting involved a little bit to understand them better, understand the space they were working in, the challenges they were trying to solve Fast forward, you know, almost a year, saw that they had applied for the incubator. And at that time, I would say Sanctum was definitely on to something. They'd done a lot around unifying liquidity for liquid staking tokens on Solana, but it was sort of pre this huge growth in these different projects having liquid staking tokens. And so we saw them as a company that was doing really good work, that was beneficial to the ecosystem and that we could help really accelerate their progress.
00:25:38.279 - 00:26:34.391, Speaker A: And so it sort of hit this like magical three of benefits that we were going after. And a lot of what we did, it's worth mentioning, a lot of what we did during the application process for Cohort one was actually turn away teams that, that might even have been bigger than Sanctum. You know, we were very privileged to have some of the biggest companies in Solana apply. But we try to be very honest with teams who apply and say, hey, you know, we really value you as a team, we think you're doing great work, but what you guys are looking for, we probably wouldn't be the best place to give you guys that support or you guys are just frankly too far along. And while it'd be great to have you as part of this program, we don't think it'd be in the best interest of your company. And so we try to be very honest with what companies are going to get out of the program. And with Sanctum, that was one where we actually thought we could provide a lot of value and we shared the vision of the future and we wanted to help bring it to life.
00:26:34.391 - 00:27:39.975, Speaker A: And so at the time they came in, I think they were still acting as this liquidity unification layer, but they didn't have this massive rise in every project having their own liquid staking token. And so the two things we did initially, one was try to hook them in with the right projects that we thought could benefit from the narrative of having an lst. And part of that too. I think this is getting into some of the benefits, but it's also sharpening the sales pitch there. It's understanding, hey, from an enterprise sales perspective almost, or enterprise BD perspective, what are some of the value propositions and core pieces we need to hit on with these projects? How does it differ depending on the project that you're selling into to try to attract them to this concept? But then the second big one for them was Wonderland. So they were launching their loyalty program. And so we really tried to get in the weeds with, with them both from program design, economics, Referral flows and even actual, not, not just program design, but actual visuals they're using.
00:27:39.975 - 00:28:16.795, Speaker A: Does the gamification mechanism make sense? And so probably halfway through the program, did you really see all the hard work Sanctum had been putting in pay off, where they kind of went through this massive hockey stick growth and very quickly went into like bunker mode where, you know, up till 3, 4 in the morning, struggling into the office afterwards. But it was just, it was such a fulfilling experience to get to, to see, to get to be there alongside of them. I'm so proud of FP and the team. And yeah, like you said, you know, they're, they're a team that we're extremely proud of. We're humbled by the fact that they chose the incubator and we're happy to see all of their success.
00:28:17.455 - 00:28:30.071, Speaker C: I know a lot of times when like a software product starts to scale a bunch things just start breaking. Was, was that the case for Sanctum and did you have to help them put out any fires while they were in the program?
00:28:30.223 - 00:29:23.707, Speaker A: Yeah, there were a bunch of fires. Not. Not only though did, did products break and you know, things needed to be fixed. I think bodies broke as well. You know, there was, there's a two week period of time where the team themselves just like got, got so sick from being up all night, their immune systems weren't, you know, keeping up with them, their bodies needed some rest. And I think that's where sort of another facet of, of the incubator comes in, which is almost like therapist is the wrong word for it, life coach is the wrong word for it, but basically being a sounding board for, for these teams when they're going through these tough times, sometimes teams just need a shoulder, just need, you know, someone they can vent to, someone they could just express their problems to. And I think having that, whether it's, whether it's myself, whether it's one of these other amazing founders from, from the cohort or from some of these companies that help us on the mentorship side.
00:29:23.707 - 00:29:32.735, Speaker A: It's just being able to express that to folks who have been through that experience previously, who know what you're going to, going through, I think just makes a world of difference.
00:29:33.525 - 00:29:59.991, Speaker C: Yeah, I remember when I visited the incubator office, I was like walking out to leave and I saw FP just eating a cup of noodles, instant noodles out of the microwave. And I was like, this man's locked in, like he doesn't have time for go get food. We're in New York City, there's so much good food around, but he's just microwave noodles. Gotta keep doing whatever I'm doing. And yeah, that was right in the middle of the kind of wonderland craze and everything.
00:30:00.093 - 00:30:29.865, Speaker A: So, yeah, it's the hope with this. And to that point, it's like it kind of reminds you of in some ways, like what we all imagine early YC to be. You know, early yc. Just a few companies. Paul Graham cooking for the cohort, them coming in, jamming together, some of the companies folding and then people going and becoming founding engineers for some of these other projects. I think honing in on the magic of in person, small batch, the importance of relationships, everyone knowing each other and getting along. That.
00:30:29.865 - 00:30:32.925, Speaker A: That's really, I think, where a lot of the magic of the program comes out.
00:30:33.345 - 00:30:38.405, Speaker C: It looked like you all watched the eclipse from the roof as well. I've seen that picture floating around.
00:30:38.745 - 00:31:08.715, Speaker A: Yeah, that was a funny day where we all knew it was the eclipse. I think we all sort of assumed that someone would have eclipse glasses. And then we're sitting there, there's probably like 30 of us in the office between us and ecosystem teams, and we realize we still don't have any glasses. And it's like 10 minutes away. And so I'm frantically texting everyone I know. Does anyone have any extras? I went to a bunch of stores and then finally a friend like Uber delivered me an extra pair of his. And so we all, all 30 of us shared this one pair of glasses and got to see the eclipse.
00:31:09.055 - 00:31:11.671, Speaker C: That's a real friend right there. Yeah, I know.
00:31:11.743 - 00:31:15.295, Speaker A: I did Venmo him for it, but still a real friend nonetheless. Good, good, good.
00:31:15.335 - 00:31:28.361, Speaker C: Yes, yes. I too was kind of forgot the eclipse was happening. And fortunately my roommate had an extra set because we were like 98%, I think here in New York. It was, it was a good, A pretty good eclipse.
00:31:28.513 - 00:31:46.001, Speaker A: I know. I. That experience made me realize that experience. I think Tim Ferriss had a good post. It made me realize I want to see the 100%. Like I should have, you know, gone up upstate to see the 100%. I think I've put the Greenland one in 2026 or whenever the next one is on my calendar to try to go see it.
00:31:46.193 - 00:31:58.469, Speaker C: I had friends that drove to Vermont or New Hampshire or something and it was cloudy, so that's. I mean, oh, man, you're making a massive bet by doing that. But I mean, if you're going to Greenland, like, how bad can it be?
00:31:58.517 - 00:31:59.437, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:31:59.541 - 00:32:21.695, Speaker C: Still seeing things. Okay, so as far as Cohort 1. I'm also curious we said sanctum kind of one that is pretty well known currently. I'm curious if you had to pick one out of, out of Cohort one that you think is the most underrated or just doesn't really get its due in maybe the public perception side of things, which one would that be?
00:32:24.515 - 00:33:12.805, Speaker A: I think both Chaga and Espresso Cash come come to mind for that one. So Chaga, a web 3 cloud gaming platform where they basically saw that existing web 2 cloud gaming providers like Xbox had just a ton of latency that made it difficult for gamers to actually leverage them. And they realized the reason this was was because the data centers that the Xboxes of the world were using were too far from where the PC was that the gamer was using. And so they said hey, this is an opportunity to go peer to peer and leverage deepen to sort of incentivize the growth of the network. And they also just launched their gamer pad which is really exciting. This is a hardware Web3 device. It's a Web3 controller that has a built in wallet.
00:33:12.805 - 00:33:43.759, Speaker A: So basically you can hook your phone into. It's basically, you know, I wish I had it but you have the two, two things of the controller. You put your phone in between, you can game web3 games but it also has the wallet built in. And so cementing executing transactions is basically seamless at that point. So go, go look up Chaga if you haven't seen what they're building. It's really exciting. And then Espresso Cash, I know I mentioned them earlier, but I think for me that the thing that everyone comes back to both originally for crypto and to this day is is payments.
00:33:43.759 - 00:34:19.185, Speaker A: And the benefit of cross border payments is the benefit of having these extremely beneficial financial rails in some of these countries that experience hyperinflation or that don't have the trust in their governments or financial systems. And so the fact that Espresso Cash is laser focused on developing economies starting with Nigeria to try to solve some of those issues is really noteworthy. And actually they're another good example of huge success during the incubator where they went from a few thousand app downloads to 100,000 downloads during the course of the program. So a lot more coming from, from them as well.
00:34:19.485 - 00:34:21.861, Speaker C: What countries are they seeing traction?
00:34:21.933 - 00:34:50.474, Speaker A: Primarily just out of curiosity, it's mostly hyperinflation countries actually. So it's, it's Nigeria, it's some other African countries, it's some South American countries, some countries in the Middle east and the Challenge now is, you know, they're kind of racing to meet the demand where they had great on ramp, off ramp partners in Nigeria, but now that they're, you know, folks are knocking on their doors from some of these other jurisdictions, they're rapidly seeing if they can embrace additional on ramp and off ramp partners to meet the needs there as well.
00:34:51.094 - 00:35:26.567, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a. Who is I is AgriDex, if you've heard of them. It's like a agriculture based exchange on Solana. I was chatting with them and they do a lot of stuff in Africa and yeah, just in a lot of the developing world you don't really think about it, but for startups there's a huge cost to just being able to operate in different jurisdictions. Like all of the counsel, you need to get all of the different on ramps and off ramps. It wasn't really something I'd consider, but there's a big cost just to existing in parts of the developed world as a, as a payments startup, I guess.
00:35:26.711 - 00:35:42.355, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%. It's like you get all of this beneficial infrastructure from the Solana blockchain itself, but then there's all of these other hurdles that, that you have to deal with. But thankfully, at least the infrastructural piece is out of the way and you can focus more, more of your attention on these other pieces.
00:35:42.795 - 00:35:58.295, Speaker C: I guess while we're speaking of it, like, how do you help founders? Because obviously this is like a US based program. How do you navigate the regulatory hurdles founders face and how do you kind of advise on that?
00:35:58.755 - 00:36:30.135, Speaker A: Yeah, so obviously regulatory hurdles, it depends on the jurisdiction that the founder is based. We try to give obviously our best practices, the best things to avoid. But a lot will also depend on the regime that, that that founding group is operating under. And that's also where we try to ensure that each of these teams is set up with the right external counsel for themselves. As a team that knows that jurisdiction well, knows that regulatory environment well, so they don't run into, into meaningful challenges.
00:36:31.275 - 00:37:00.513, Speaker C: Okay. Yeah, makes sense. So getting back to Cohort 1 a little bit, I'm also curious to hear about Meme Royale, because that was a project that had come across my radar as sort of one of these pump fund competitors that's a little more like efficient capital efficient, I guess you could say. And then while I was prepping for this episode, I realized that they were sort of related to the Solana incubator. So I'm just curious to hear the story of how Meme Royale came to.
00:37:00.529 - 00:37:43.717, Speaker A: Be yeah, it's a great story. So about two thirds of the way through the program, we sort of recognize the camaraderie that that was in the cohort, how much everyone loved working together, and so decided to put on a hackathon where basically we encourage teams over a weekend to come work, work with other founders, work on things maybe you feel like you don't have the time to work on. And we come back in Monday morning, I'm expecting, you know, four or five different projects coming out of the hackathon. That's when they told me they've all been working on one specific project. I'm like, wow, you know, all of these big brain founders working on one project. They must have figured out the cure for world hunger, world peace, using, using blockchain. But no, instead we get Meme Royale.
00:37:43.717 - 00:39:07.017, Speaker A: But no Meme Royale. It's, it's a really interesting project. I think they saw what was happening with Pump Fund and some of these other token launch pads and they asked themselves, how can we actually create really compelling, almost like gaming mechanisms around this? Where the core of Meme Royale is you have the same elements as pumped up fun in terms of being able to launch tokens, grow tokens, but now there's this rating concept as well, where any token at any point can raid another token and essentially that other token has to play defense against the raid. Where for a certain period of time during the raid, maybe it's a three hour raid, both communities of both of those tokens are working to essentially pump their token and whichever token pumps the most during that raid essentially wins the raid. And the other, the other token goes to zero and gets looped into the token of the winning community. And so it's kind of creating this, this fun, more gamified experience with eventual goal once again of graduating on to Radium and being a fully flush token. And from a hackathon project perspective, it was something the teams were all excited about, wanted to work together on it, created this environment where, as I mentioned, the different skill sets of the different founders in the program came together.
00:39:07.017 - 00:39:25.845, Speaker A: And honestly, sometimes it's, it's nice to have sort of a side project to work on as a distraction when you're really in the thick of your startup. So that was the story of Meme Royale still going. I think they recently had their full launch, but still iterating on the platform. So we'll see where they go from here.
00:39:26.305 - 00:40:12.507, Speaker C: Yeah, it's funny to hear that that's where that came from because I remember seeing it and I was like DMing the meme royale Twitter account, not really knowing who was behind it, but just asking for more details. But I guess it was y'all lifting off the Scooby Doo mask a little bit. Yeah, it's a cool concept just because whatever you make of pump fun or whatever, there's a lot of tokens that end up with like two and a half Solana in them and that those funds may never leave. They may just stay stuck in these meme coins that don't exist. So the idea of like raiding and then moving the liquidity to another token that's actually going to make use of it, it's kind of cool. I don't know, it's. It's.
00:40:12.507 - 00:40:22.997, Speaker C: Yeah, I haven't gotten a chance to play with it since it launched, but that's. Yeah. Glad your hackathon was fruitful there.
00:40:23.061 - 00:40:41.105, Speaker A: As the team likes to say, it's the survival of the shittiest mechanic where meme coins that aren't working out, they'll go to zero and then the ones that are hopefully, hopefully graduate. Yeah, it's a really cool dynamic. You should definitely check it out if you haven't yet. And like I said, we'll see where the platform goes from here.
00:40:42.245 - 00:41:36.895, Speaker C: Yes. So transitioning a little bit. We mentioned before, Solana Labs is behind the Solana incubator. So Solana Labs initially developed the Solana Validator client and then kind of spun off and gave to my understanding kind of control over day to day management stuff for Solana to the Solana Foundation. And today Labs develops things like gameshift, which is this gaming infrastructure business or Solana Mobile or there's a customer loyalty thing called Bond that came out recently. So I guess I'm curious, you know, looking at that. The Solana Labs product that maybe was the buzziest over the past year to my knowledge, is the Solana Mobile.
00:41:36.895 - 00:42:05.045, Speaker C: The Solana saga had a lot of people interested in it because of airdrops and some other things, but. Long winded question, but what I'm trying to get to is do you see kind of synergy, I guess, between the products that Solana Labs creates and this incubator and specifically with mobile, are you looking or hoping that with this new cohort there will be some kind of Solana related mobile business that you can accept into the cohort?
00:42:05.545 - 00:42:40.559, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a great question. So definitely a lot of synergies between the product specific teams within Solana Labs and the incubator itself. One is just that the deep bench of knowledge that we can leverage within Solana Labs. So a few examples of that. For instance, Chaga, in launching this, this Gamer Pad, it's a hardware product. It's kind of similar to what we were trying to do or complimentary to what we were trying to do with Solana Mobile. And so they, they met quite a bit with the Solana Mobile team around best practices for that and with Anatoly, frankly, given, given how much of a whiz he is to.
00:42:40.559 - 00:43:38.119, Speaker A: To iterate and get that right. Also, for a lot of the applicants where, you know, cohort one, we had almost 300 applicants, we saw games who could potentially benefit from Game Shift. We saw folks building on Solana Mobile who could benefit from working more closely with that team. And so we actually, even if they might not have been a fit for the incubator and what our mandate was, we actually funneled those teams into gameshift and Solana Mobile and potentially we'll do the same with Bond this time around to get those teams the support that they need. So, and also I think across these different teams, there's just so much web3 expertise and folks have seen so much that they can jump in and kind of support these teams based on what, what their expertise is. So definitely synergies there. And then in terms of the second part of your question, yeah, we're always open to teams who want to build on Solana Mobile, who want to build a game leveraging Game Shift.
00:43:38.119 - 00:44:11.575, Speaker A: That's not explicitly a mandate of the program. And we're not saying that, hey, 100% of the cohort needs to do that or even. We're not saying that even a single team in the cohort needs to do that, but that's definitely something that we're open to. And actually one of the changes we made to our application this time around was, was formally codifying that was, was asking a question on, hey, are you interested in interfacing or leveraging game for Game Shift? Are you interested in launching within Solana Mobile? And at the very least, we'll do the same thing this year of get, get those teams in through the right BD funnels for each of those teams and get them the support they need.
00:44:12.475 - 00:44:36.945, Speaker C: And on the topic of just the labs side of this, to my understanding, you've been at Solana Labs since 2022, so I'm just curious with the launch of this incubator, how your role has shifted? Like, are you doing the incubator stuff full time? Are you doing stuff with salon adventures? Like what's, what's your role these days and how has the incubator kind of shifted that?
00:44:37.445 - 00:45:10.665, Speaker A: Yeah, so my, I've kind of worn so many different hats during my time within Solana Labs. You know, I came in first and foremost to lead our DAO vertical and that meant getting realms up and running SPL governance and figuring out the right future for, for that product once we got it to a good place, then came in and helped run a number of partnerships. Namely our Discord partnership was, was probably the biggest one that we launched. Discord integration, I should say is the biggest one that we launched on that side. Came in to lead our defi vertical and a lot of that.
00:45:11.765 - 00:45:14.709, Speaker C: What's the Discord Integration? That's. That's a new one to me.
00:45:14.837 - 00:46:06.371, Speaker A: Yeah, so the Discord integration, I think it came out late 2022. It basically is a way to link your wallet on Discord and then ascribe roles based on that, that wallet itself. So at the time a lot of communities were struggling to token gate their community or NFT gate their community. And we gave a way to actually hook into the Solana blockchain to verify what assets that user owned. And then on top of that, you can create other interesting roles based off of that, where you say, hey, a user both owns the NFT and has taken a certain amount of actions on Twitter and has done something else and therefore they get a certain role within, within our community. And that, that hopefully the hope is that opens the door for other more web3 native things on Discord, whether it's commerce, whether it's peer to peer payments, whether it's something else using Web3.
00:46:06.563 - 00:46:18.099, Speaker C: Okay, yeah, I'm vaguely remembering this. There were other things happening in late 2022 that took a lot of my attention at the time. But I'm. That's ringing bell. But, but sorry, I'm terribly rude, I interrupted you.
00:46:18.227 - 00:46:18.747, Speaker A: No, no, no.
00:46:18.771 - 00:46:19.615, Speaker C: As you were saying.
00:46:20.095 - 00:47:14.395, Speaker A: Yeah. So then I came in to lead our defi vertical and as part of that we were putting out a lot of reference implementations at the time and experimented with this notion of an incubator where we're working with these teams who are building on top of the reference limitation to see if we can help them become more successful and saw that there was kind of a growing need around this space where Solana Labs, by virtue of the five years we've been in existence, probably longer at this point, we just have a lot of battle scars, a lot of learnings. We've seen so much in this space. And we said, hey, what is the best way to actually scale those learnings? And that expertise across the ecosystem Incubator was one of the answers to that question. So yeah, now I am full time on the incubator, still get pulled into a number of things across the organization, but both supporting the existing teams that we have and now getting ready for the next cohort of teams.
00:47:15.445 - 00:48:37.665, Speaker C: Okay, that's interesting I guess for the next couple of minutes and maybe to conclude I want to get a little bit more existential perhaps as far as the incubator and just your views on Solana. So thinking about startups in the Solana ecosystem, I would say revenue wise, by far the most successful one this year has been Pumped Fun, which just crossed 100 million in revenue since launching in January, which is just an insane amount to be making in the first year that you launch your platform. So clearly there is product market fit of some kind for meme coins buying and selling assets at the same time. You mentioned things like Espresso Cash which are doing things like helping people in the developing world escape hyperinflation or things like that. So I guess I'm just curious how you think about the trade off between things that work and make money a la pump fun. Although they might not be the most exciting or long term feeling or revolutionary, you could say, versus products that maybe have more impact on the real world, but right now they don't draw a lot of users or excitement. How do you think about the trade off of those two things as you're sort of evaluating startups?
00:48:38.085 - 00:49:37.691, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a great question. I don't necessarily think of those two as mutually exclusive. I mean obviously we would all love for Web3 to have a massive impact on the real world and there's amazing companies working to do that today. And I don't think that having an impact on the real world means negating revenue either. I think there are successful businesses that you see out there who, who are addressing real world topics, who can find sustainable revenue sources. What I will say is that, you know, pump find the NFT craze, a number of these other mechanisms have tapped into at least some zeitgeist piece of a certain Web3 audience that has brought users into the ecosystem. And if that's what it takes for a user to, you know, get their first crypto wallet, you know, become a pump fun user, but then onboard into Jupiter or Drift or whatever other product within the ecosystem that's, that's serving a role for, for everyone.
00:49:37.691 - 00:50:04.095, Speaker A: So my mentality here is kind of like a Rising. Rising tide lifts all boats. And if the entryway, the gateway, is, you know, something like pump fun, then that's fantastic. And, you know, they've built an incredible business doing that. And so, you know, my mentality isn't, you know, we just need teams addressing the real world. We just need teams focusing on kind of these more Zeitgeist users. I think we're all working together to push this ecosystem forward.
00:50:04.875 - 00:50:28.995, Speaker C: Yeah, that. That makes sense. I guess, relatedly then, something I've been thinking about in that same realm lately. I did a Lightspeed newsletter piece recently about there's all of these new addresses on the Solana blockchain since the bull run began. Like, I don't know, hundreds of thousands. That's off the top of my head. Don't quote me of new addresses.
00:50:28.995 - 00:51:40.233, Speaker C: And so are these new addresses new to crypto or are they new to Solana? Are they rotating in from other crypto ecosystems? And from the reporting I was able to do, it seemed like a lot of the new Solana users were not new to crypto. They were just, you know, had messed around with Ripple in the past cycle or whatever, and now they're transferring over to Solana because it's the hotel blockchain of the moment. So I kind of want to get your perspective on this, because I was looking through some of the application materials for the incubator and you said we're interested in projects building on Solana, we're also interested in projects building on other blockchains or in Web2, and you want to start adding sort of Web3 rails to your project. So as far as the third category there, these Web2 projects that are kind of appealing to Web2 users and could bring new users in, but add crypto Rails, how do you actually make that happen? Where new users on Solana or new users coming to these startups aren't already in crypto, they're people who are on the sidelines completely and are entering crypto through encountering these projects on Solana, if that makes sense.
00:51:40.369 - 00:52:46.401, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a great question, you know, if we. If we make sort of a dichotomy between users who are companies that are building for existing crypto users versus companies that are building for a. Net new user base. It's actually, I find it to be a very interesting dichotomy to make because in my ideal world of crypto adoption for the masses, everyone today who's building Web3 infrastructure is even building, like, products catered toward existing Web3 users. Like they're Essentially creating that, that foundation for the user base and adoption of tomorrow. And when I think about that user base and adoption of tomorrow, what that looks like to me is a large number of users engaging in apps, having no idea that beneath the surface those apps are powered by web3 rails. And to go back to two examples we talked to today, you know, Chaga and Espresso Cash, users of both of those products theoretically could use them and not realize that the infrastructure that they're built on is web3.
00:52:46.401 - 00:53:30.975, Speaker A: In the same way that I might use a product and not realizing, realize it's using AWS under the hood. But to create that level of abstraction and that level of user experience, it requires all of these other teams and individuals doing this foundational work today that is catered to the Web3 audience. It's almost this notion of dog fooding your own product. You know, in, in startups that there's this thing of, hey, you should use your own product before end users do. So, you know, what's wrong with it? That's kind of the whole Web3 ecosystem today is we're all, we're all collectively dog fooding these products and making sure that they're up to par. But as I think about the crypto of tomorrow, it is that crypto, where everyday users are using, using these applications and crypto is buried under the hood somewhere.
00:53:31.515 - 00:54:12.403, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, I think that's a good point, that maybe they aren't mutually exclusive things. But I think it's an interesting question for startups to reckon with is if I go the conventional route and launch a token and go through the like web3 marketing apparatus that kind of exists. A lot of the users I'll draw are people that are already in crypto. But if I don't know, seven, according to the Fed, like 7% or maybe 15% of American adults own crypto. Like there's a huge untapped user base if you're only confined to the crypto world. So it's an interesting question to think through at the very least.
00:54:12.579 - 00:54:53.795, Speaker A: I guess I think the thing I'd add to that as well, Jack, is like, when I chat with teams in the program, outside of the program, the question that I ask isn't, hey, are you going after a Web3 user? You know, non Web3 user. The question I ask is like, who is the target market for what you're building? Who actually has the problem that your product is trying to solve? And the answer to that, if it is a Web3 user, we get even deeper of, okay, what is the archetype of that web3user. If it's a non web3user, we get into the archetype of the non web3user. And so it's less about choosing one of these dichotomies in a vacuum and it's more about what is the actual problem you're trying to solve and who has that burning need.
00:54:54.995 - 00:55:09.643, Speaker C: Yeah. So if there's any prospective or current founders who've listened with us this far who think they have a problem that they can address for users, what's the best way to be in touch or learn more about the incubator?
00:55:09.699 - 00:55:48.525, Speaker A: Yvonne yeah, so you can check out solanaincubator.com Our application deadline is October 4th, so would encourage you to reach out and apply. Have any questions? I'm, I'm active on Twitter, I'm at Iman Motamity, so feel free to drop me a DM there. And I should also I never formally introduced the program. I'm, I'm realizing but the incubator itself, you know, it's, it's three months in New York City, January to April 2025. The biggest thing is building alongside and growing with the Solana Labs team where we're working with you ad hoc each week around the specific problems you're facing. But then on top of that we have a ton of programming depending on your needs.
00:55:48.525 - 00:56:38.125, Speaker A: So we have business review meetings each week, we have a speaker series and a dinner each week, office hours where we bring in amazing VCs like a 16Z like multicoin paradigm, etc to work with these teams. We have workshops where we bring in subject matter experts around things like go to market brand smart, contract development, et cetera. We have one on one mentors with some of the companies I, I mentioned earlier, drift, tip link, dialect, et cetera, cohort huddles where we actually work with founder to founder across the different teams in the cohort and then finally some social events where we can actually relax in, in the, in the thick of all of this building. So just, just wanted to quickly give the description because I realized I never covered that. So thank you for giving me the time to do that, Jack.
00:56:38.475 - 00:56:56.651, Speaker C: Yes, absolutely. A good little plug there and yeah, applications are open right now, so go check it out and otherwise Iman, thank you for coming on and I'm excited to have you on another 10 months from now to chat about how Cohort 2 was.
00:56:56.843 - 00:57:00.811, Speaker A: Can't wait. Thank you for all the great questions Jack and really appreciate the time again.
00:57:01.003 - 00:57:02.615, Speaker C: Absolutely man. Take care.
00:57:05.415 - 00:57:05.655, Speaker A: SA.
