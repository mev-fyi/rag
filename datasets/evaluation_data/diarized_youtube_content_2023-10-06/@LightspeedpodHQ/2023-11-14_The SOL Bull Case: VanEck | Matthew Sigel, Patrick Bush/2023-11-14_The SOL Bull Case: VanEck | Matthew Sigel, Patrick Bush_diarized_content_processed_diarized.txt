00:00:00.170 - 00:00:13.662, Speaker A: The experiment here was really to think about, which is going to be the chain that onboards an app with a hundred million users. Because of Salana's performance advantages, it is maybe the first and only chain to reach that hundred million users on a single app.
00:00:13.716 - 00:00:47.980, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by Das London, blockwork's number one institutional crypto conference, where all the top institutions and people in crypto are going to be this march in London, what's becoming maybe the crypto hub of the world. I have a link in the show notes where can learn more and also discount code that will get you 20% off. So click the link, find out more and I'll see you there. What's up, everybody? Welcome to another episode of Lightspeed. Today we're joined by Matthew Siegel and Patrick Bush from Van Egg. Matthew Siegel is the head of crypto research there, and Patrick Bush is a senior investment analyst. Guys, welcome to the show.
00:00:47.980 - 00:01:07.458, Speaker B: Ken, most people in finance in general would know a lot about Van Eck, but maybe not in the crypto space in particular. I know you've been an asset manager in traditional finance, but I just went to your Twitter page actually, like 2 seconds ago, and the banner on there says into the ether, which I'm assuming is a crypto comment there. So I'm just curious, could you give us like a high level overview of what Vanek does and how you got.
00:01:07.464 - 00:01:10.690, Speaker C: Into the crypto space? Sure.
00:01:10.840 - 00:02:09.654, Speaker A: So we're a traditional asset manager, mostly mutual funds and ETFs, about 80 billion in assets. But the DNA of the firm is really a macro, thematic approach to investing. Think of it as a family office with an asset manager bolted on top and the CEO and owner. Jan and his family were very early to identify the opportunity in gold and gold mining stocks in the 1970s with a thesis of kind of austrian economics and the unsustainable US dollar. And that proved correct. But we were also just super worried about that part of the business being disrupted. And when bitcoin began to gain prominence ten years ago, Jan was reasonably early in recognizing that it could be a threat to our existing gold business, and the underlying technology could eventually disintermediate the financial system as we knew it.
00:02:09.654 - 00:02:51.742, Speaker A: So we were the first Trifi firm to file for spot bitcoin ETF in 2017. When that couldn't get off the ground because of regulations, we pivoted and started investing into venture to get smarter in the space. Have since launched a number of actively managed digital asset strategies run out of New York. But in Europe, where the regulation allowed we did launch a number of ETFs and ETNs, and one of the first was Solana ETN, actually in the summer of 2021. So I came from an equity research background. I worked for Kathy Wood for four years in the alliance Bernstein days pre arc. We were huge shareholders in Qualcomm.
00:02:51.742 - 00:03:32.622, Speaker A: A big believer in the disruption that they were bringing to radio frequency technologies, enabling the cell phone industry. And when I came across Salana in 2020, kind of realized that what Anatoly was doing, optimizing the blockchain for the speed of the hardware, was something that was truly innovative and unique and could disrupt something like a Nasdaq. It was the chain that might be able to bring a central limit order book on chain. So we started following it closely. We launched the ETN. We've been holders of the token and various strategies ever since. But the answer to your question is that we're trying really hard not to get disrupted here.
00:03:32.622 - 00:03:42.830, Speaker A: And we're doing that by bringing products to market, both on the tradfi side with these ETNs, and then also trying to participate directly on chain where we can with some of these liquid token funds.
00:03:42.910 - 00:03:43.250, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:03:43.320 - 00:04:25.954, Speaker D: Thank you. Thank you for that. And I think I really appreciate the context on Anatole and kind of that connection with Qualcomm, because most of the Solana core guys are ex Qualcomm engineers. So that makes a lot of sense from a personal level, why you have your own thesis on, right, and kind of how you guys started with, well, bitcoin and then gold, maybe that kind of parallel. And then now there's these smart contract platforms and Ethereum and Solana and others, and maybe getting a bit more specific because that's not a traditional asset class. I would say, like smart contract platforms, Bitcoin is much simpler to conceptualize. How do you guys think about the state of.
00:04:25.954 - 00:04:37.480, Speaker D: What is your thesis on smart contract platforms? How do you decide, okay, we should support this chain like a Solana, or we shouldn't support this chain. How do you kind of see that playing out?
00:04:39.210 - 00:05:53.854, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think about it as starting with some core beliefs about what percent of the existing financial system can and may be intermediated by open source blockchains. And bitcoin is kind of the killer app 1.0 of that. But because it's not turing complete and we can't embed a lot of automation into that blockchain, then it's most appropriate to comp it versus something inert like gold. Although that narrative may be changing a little bit with some of the l two s that we're seeing built on bitcoin, and that the smart contract platforms are going after a slightly different but adjacent market, but still requires an underlying belief in open source money. And I think that's where we have some disagreements, even within the team as to can Solana work if, let's say, a Home Depot isn't buying tens of millions of dollars worth of soul to put on their balance sheet to pay in advance for some of the gas transactions enabled by these stablecoins? Personally, I don't think it can.
00:05:53.854 - 00:06:38.134, Speaker A: I think that it requires institutions to adopt open source money. There's a lot of regulatory hurdles to that, but that's what the bullcase entails. And then all of these different smart contract platforms just lay on a spectrum of decentralization and performance that the market is in process of sorting out. The regulator obviously disagrees on some of these, calling Solana security in the Coinbase suit, for example. We'll see how the courts shake out on this, but we basically look for a sufficient level of decentralization and open source code to give us conviction that we're investing in an open source project and not a private blockchain where personally.
00:06:38.182 - 00:06:48.750, Speaker D: I have zero interest talking about the bullish case. You guys made headlines with the very bullish price estimation which took over Twitter.
00:06:49.810 - 00:06:53.950, Speaker C: Can you talk a bit about that bull case?
00:06:54.020 - 00:07:05.460, Speaker D: Like what kind of informed it, how you guys think about it? And obviously you had a neutral case and a bear case as well. So for people who aren't familiar with you writing, can you maybe go into detail and describe that?
00:07:06.250 - 00:08:37.858, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll do the kind of top level and then toss to Patrick here. But basically what we're trying to do is set some assumptions, both at the 30,000 foot view, what percent of financial activity is going to be intermediated along these blockchains, these open source blockchains, which end market, whether it's kind of banking and finance, social mediagaming, or core tech infrastructure like storage and compute, what are the likely penetration levels for each of those end markets? What will the monetization be in each of those three markets? And which open source projects have the highest chance of kind of monetizing the most? And then where will the apps be? And the experiment here was really to think about which is going to be the chain that onboards an app with 100 million users. Because I think what we've seen throughout 2023 is a big rally in coin prices, but led by bitcoin, because generally on chain activity has been lagging the speculation, frankly, in the bitcoin price. And since we're bullish on this space, we want to imagine a situation where that changes and where on chain activity materializes, and where, because of Salana's performance advantages, it is maybe the first and only chain to reach that 100 million users on a single app. I'll leave it to Patrick here to go through some more of the model.
00:08:37.944 - 00:09:46.118, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks, Matthew. So the next component, I think one of the most important parts, is kind of gluing that top down, overarching thesis, and then, okay, like, precisely how would Solana make money? That's something that to be like, we're not sure exactly how work. What we tend to come at it is that Solana is similar to a platform like an Uber or an Amazon, where there's economic activity on it and there'll be some take rate OD activity based upon the end market. And so that sounds really fine in theory, but in practice, it's a little difficult precisely to pin that down. So we tend to ballpark these things by looking on chain and saying, okay, like on Ethereum, for example, what's the fee share between a uniswap versus what it pays to ethereum versus what the fees are for using the product? And we kind of look at that as, like a take rate, then extrapolate that. So, for example, I think uniswap must have checked the fee ratio to the ratio of on chain gas it paid was something like two to one. So that's kind of how we see that breaking out.
00:09:46.118 - 00:10:45.738, Speaker C: So that'd be like a 66% take rate for the chain versus what Uniswap gets, something that salana doesn't have as high. So we looked at some of the salana Dexes, and so in terms of the fees it collected versus what all of the different blockchain fees were for using those dexes, but something closer to, like, one and a half percent. So when we come at this, we say, okay, well, Salana is going to take a much smaller take rate than Ethereum. But what's interesting is that you started thinking about it further and looking something like local fee markets. Like Tarun had a really good presentation about how you can start dividing up and pricing different blockchain resources rather than just doing okay, it's going to be compute units on Solana, maybe you want to make things cheaper. Like, if you're going to do something in parallel, might be a lot cheaper than something that's going to be contentious for the same piece of state, just at a base fee level. And so we kind of end around and said, okay, well, maybe there's a path where Solana can monetize things explicitly based on what they're being used for.
00:10:45.738 - 00:10:50.700, Speaker C: Something you don't really see, an EVM. That's not really possible. And this is because of the local fee market's design.
00:10:52.270 - 00:11:17.446, Speaker B: Yeah, I found that piece really interesting because Doug Colkett has been in the Ethereum space, and he talks about price discrimination. He's like Ethereum in some ways, stumbled across having this constrained base layer, and then you can do price discrimination through L two s. And he talks about, like, an example would be Microsoft. Like, you're going to charge enterprise customers more than you might retail. Same thing with colleges. In state tuition is going to be cheaper than out of state. And he's like, in some ways, I think a lot of people have addressed Solana as not really having that.
00:11:17.446 - 00:11:56.474, Speaker B: You have these cheap fees across all transactions, no matter what the value is actually being processed, whereas something like these local fee markets, maybe in the future, is something that you guys hint at, can actually be utilized to almost have this form of price discrimination, which does come in effect today through priority fees. Because obviously, if there's a hot contested state, those fees do go up. And we've actually seen that happen over the last few days. It just doesn't affect the whole network, which is obviously one of the biggest bull cases for Solana as well. I have, like, two sentences I just have to read from this article because I thought this was so great. Says Solana has translated its pioneering spirit into an ecosystem philosophy of risk taking and techno optimism. Pretty great verbiage there, more so than any other ecosystem.
00:11:56.474 - 00:12:13.720, Speaker B: People building projects in Solana are creating things that may provide a tangible impact on everyday life. This sounds pretty great to me. I'm just curious, what makes you say that? What attracted you to Salana? Is this recent? Is this like, some of the upgrades that happened in 2022 or what kind of gave this bullish view?
00:12:14.650 - 00:12:17.014, Speaker A: Patrick, you wrote that line. I'll let you go first.
00:12:17.132 - 00:13:05.058, Speaker C: Yeah. So let's go back to last year, and there was quite a bit of talk about Solana and its potential and all the things that can be built on it, and I didn't really buy that. I was actually kind of bearish on Solana and had a lot of pushback internally. And then when FTX happened, I sort of felt validated because you think about, okay, Solana hasn't had a lot of traction from users, TVL developers, whatever standpoint. And in fact, those have shrunk over time, right? And even today, they're much lower than they were as percentage of all crypto. And I also saw FTX happen, and it was like, okay, this thing is in deep. I I likened it to something like Moon river, moonbeam on polka dot.
00:13:05.058 - 00:13:59.010, Speaker C: When they had the Nomad bridge hack, they lost all their TVL, they lost a lot of their VC capital, and they were going to the deep, right. But then something bizarre happened is that it didn't. It kept going, and it was pretty profound. It's like, in evolutionary biology, you have, like, two schools of thought, or at least there used to be that there's something called punctuated equilibrium versus gradualism, where gradually the changes happen over time, an advantageous species will win out, right? Versus punctuated equilibrium is like, hey, there's like, a really bad event, and all the ones that don't have some sort of attribute die out, right? And so you had that on Solana. It wasn't, like, gradualistic. It was like, okay, there's this horrible event. The chief backer of the chain is gone, and suddenly you have this ecosystem that's kind of on its own, and it survived.
00:13:59.010 - 00:14:45.778, Speaker C: Not only did it survive, but it thrived. When bonk happened, it was like, oh, okay, this is all bad. And so that's kind of like how we got back into it. And then it started looking more and more that they would start resolving the different issues over time. So thinking about local fee markets and quick messaging and things along those lines, it made a lot of sense that they were going to solve some of the underlying problems. And so then it became looking at all the different evms and thinking like, okay, is this stuff going to scale? Can you have a really big consumer application? Or more importantly, can you have multiple consumer applications that depend upon one another to write state the same time, or to process transactions or whatever the cool kids call it these days. And the answer is like, no, not the same as Solana.
00:14:45.778 - 00:15:30.614, Speaker C: It's not even close. And so when you see projects like backtack NFT or you see Hivemap or teleports, you see that there's a lot of capability. And so, in the future, we're thinking, okay, there'll be a super app, but the super app won't be one app. It will really be like a constellation, like a dozen or two dozen apps. Think about having something like credit card payments on chain. Maybe you have pools where people put risk capital, right? And then you have different entities that are doing verification identity, and you have all these things kind of bundled into one transaction. So for that you need something like atomic composability, the ability to interact, and also a pipeline that will allow that throughput to happen, because it's not contentious, that won't be affected by other parts of the state.
00:15:30.614 - 00:15:52.906, Speaker C: And so it's like, wow, you can't do that on most EVMs, right? That's why I thought it was really cool. It just has the potential to disintermediate. And then you think of all the different ways that they're looking at the consumer, they're trying to solve problems for people. They made a phone. Everyone's like, this is so stupid. The phone is the most idiotic move I've seen. But this is what people are interested in.
00:15:52.906 - 00:16:02.382, Speaker C: They're going to get something new that affects their everyday lives and you potentially do payments from your phone and places. That, to me, kind of brought me around. So that's how I see it.
00:16:02.436 - 00:17:13.154, Speaker A: I think Patrick's describing a bit of internal volatility that didn't necessarily manifest in our token movements, where we've been pretty steadfast since 2021, that this is a different type of chain. And if the monolithic version can succeed, then they'll be able to capture more of the value versus Ethereum, who is sharing it with all these l two s. So simply put, like, we think Salana has pricing power. If the transactions and users materialize, then fees are going to go up, pricing is going to go up, and yet it will still be the cheapest blockchain to use. And one way that we can kind of put that into context is if you look at our Ethereum model versus our Salana model for ETH, we have, call it a five x return in our base case. And that assumes that ETH captures 70% market share of all the value sent back and forth across open source blockchains. For Salana, our price target is a ten x return, and yet our terminal market share is only 30%, less than half of Ethereum's.
00:17:13.154 - 00:17:23.026, Speaker A: And that's because basically they'll be able to raise prices and capture more of the value without sharing it with the L two s. So just some context.
00:17:23.138 - 00:17:24.134, Speaker C: Yeah, those are great.
00:17:24.172 - 00:17:53.630, Speaker B: I do want to pull this up. I don't know if you're on YouTube, you can see this because we've talked about the base case and also the bull days, but we haven't really said the price. If you haven't seen the report, the base case, by 2030, the price is at 335 is what the analysis has here. And then it's over 13,000 for the bullcase. And we've already kind of talked about some of the reasons for that bullcase. One of these being in the report. It's that Salana will be the first ecosystem to actually host an app that has 100 million people, which be game changing, not just for Salana, but all of crypto.
00:17:53.630 - 00:18:37.226, Speaker B: I do want to touch on a few more of the challenges that you put in the report, or, like, what maybe holds you back when you think about Salana. One of those we talked about was the cost. You had another one that I thought was interesting, and that you talk about the network outages that happened in 2021, 2022, and there's been a lot of improvements through quick and stakewiddic QoS through that. And there hasn't been any outages lately. But one thing you mentioned is fired answer as well, in that institutions may have an extremely hard time looking at Salana, seeing those past outages and actually choosing the chain. And that fired answer, even though it could bring anywhere from, let's just say, ten times performance improvement, it could actually be almost like you almost restart from zero to prove out how hardened the protocol is in some ways. I'm just curious, because you have a touch on the institutional pulse.
00:18:37.226 - 00:18:39.146, Speaker B: Do you think that's still a big factor?
00:18:39.178 - 00:18:40.878, Speaker C: We did see visa, I think it.
00:18:40.884 - 00:18:49.240, Speaker B: Was back in August, actually announced that they're going to start doing settlements on Salana. Do you think that's changing? Because in the report, it seemed like you still thought that was a pretty big problem for Solana right now.
00:18:49.770 - 00:19:37.394, Speaker A: So I'll go first. And one thing that really attracted me to Solana personally was the fact that Anatoly's building in America. And I think that if the SEC's draconian regulatory attempts are like, as they recede and crypto starts to win these court cases, and we can see it just in the last week or two, it's american. Finally, for the first time in all month, the biggest increases in prices are coming during US trading hours. And the ETF has catalyzed some us interest. And I think Solana has kind of more beta to that american story and was more depressed partially because of it. And the outages kind of played into that.
00:19:37.394 - 00:19:47.960, Speaker A: Whereas if you thought that they were going to solve the outages, then the upside was so much more because of the potential to capture us market. Patrick, anything to add on?
00:19:49.630 - 00:20:27.054, Speaker C: Think so. Thinking about when people give pushback to Ethereum and all the centralization, like you talk about. Okay, there's only a few relevant block builders. They talk about the fact that there's only kind of, like, one market for block space, or maybe two going forward, and maybe they'll talk about something like, there'll be only a certain number of relays. And so I think that in the Solana, I think the problem that I see is that fire dancer will have massive capabilities, and people will say, okay, well, then there'll be, like, two clients in the system. Like, no big deal. But I don't see how people wouldn't switch over to fire dancer if it was a lot more lucrative.
00:20:27.054 - 00:21:26.034, Speaker C: And I think another thing I have a serious problem with this is that I mentioned those block builder things, because I think someone, like jump building, this is inherently going to have a substantial advantage over everyone else, and they'll probably become the chief block builder of the ecosystem. And so I think having this massive capability and throughput of school, but from a technical lift, it may be really difficult for entities to compete from a block builder or a searcher standpoint. And so having that one entity being controlled that much of the chain, I think something quite uncomfortable with. And then something else to think about right now is just kind of like how MeV works on Solana. And to me, it seems that there is a ton of OCAs currently are happening, because you need to be so close to each of those validators in order to see the transactions come through and respond accordingly. And obviously, Jito is going to fix it. It's going to fix it by kind of doing a speed just, and then having more of a set block that goes up rather than keep streaming shreds.
00:21:26.034 - 00:22:00.914, Speaker C: So I just worry that going forward, that fire dancer is going to be able to take that over, and then you're not going to see anyone able to compete in that block building segment. And so that's, like, one thing, I think, and then other people who are more technically gifted than I, and understand it very deeply, we're discussing that potentially, like, a fired answer could potentially change historical state. Now, I'm not sure about that. That's like a big leap, but that's something that people discussed. I saw most people said, no, it's not possible, but I'm not sure how that will play out.
00:22:01.032 - 00:22:22.626, Speaker D: Maybe I'll start in chronological order there. I think your first point was about, well, if there's fire dancer is the second client is much more performant, then people are probably just going to switch over to that, and that's going to be the dominant one. And that's correct. I think that's probably what will happen over time. The main benefit of the newer client is actually, at first, mostly from a security perspective.
00:22:22.738 - 00:22:23.026, Speaker C: Right.
00:22:23.068 - 00:22:46.734, Speaker D: Because you're recreating the code base in a different language from the ground up, and so you're minimizing the probability that there's a catastrophic failure event in the code base. Right. And so that's actually what Tolle says, at least it keeps him up at night, and now he can sleep slightly easier. And then over time, there are plans to make automatic failovers. So the idea is people would run.
00:22:46.772 - 00:22:48.498, Speaker C: Kind of both clients, and then in.
00:22:48.504 - 00:23:20.902, Speaker D: The event that fire dancer has a problem, it would fall back to the Solana client, the Solana Labs client. And so that would help with liveness. But to be fair, that is not the case when it goes live. And so that'll take some time. And then I think your second point was about, so jump is doing this, and they're going to have an inherent advantage in kind of block production. I think there's certainly something to be said there. It's a very difficult code base to understand, but at the end of the day, it is open source.
00:23:20.902 - 00:24:00.258, Speaker D: So people who are interested, and there's certainly quite a few parties who've shown interest, looking at the code base, that's not the state. Jump won't have that advantage. They will, but it is open source. And so I would say it's a bit more fair than maybe the tradfi version of how this stuff works. And then I think the third thing you mentioned is about the state. I'm not sure what the context is, but you cannot change the state, historic state. There might be different versions of the ledger, in which case you would have to build some kind of trust guarantees to that.
00:24:00.258 - 00:24:52.300, Speaker D: But the state itself, which is what everybody cares about, you can't change that. But that's kind of really cool that you guys are exploring that deep into the ecosystem, because that's stuff that's extremely deep and shows a good understanding. And so I'm really glad to see that. And I guess maybe talking about that, since you guys are like this deep into Salana, you guys are obviously also quite deep into just crypto in general, and Ethereum and l two s and the modular roadmap. I'm kind of curious, from a technical perspective, if you guys have any high level thoughts on comparing the integrated thesis and the modular thesis of blockchains. Matthew, I know you mentioned you kind of hinted at this with, like, the fragmentation of value capture between L two s and Ethereum. So it seems like you've thought about it there a bit, but I'm curious how you guys think about it and how it plays out in, like, five to ten years.
00:24:53.470 - 00:25:01.418, Speaker A: Yeah. Now, I think there's still so much that's uncertain. So a lot of these roadmaps are more theoretical.
00:25:01.514 - 00:25:02.160, Speaker C: But.
00:25:04.210 - 00:25:59.374, Speaker A: What we see in web two is that the winner take all characteristics of digital platforms are considerable because the marginal cost of serving the nth customer is so low. So that's how we ended up with what Warren Buffett calls a natural monopoly for Google. And there's two things that can disrupt that. You can either come after them on price, or you can come after them on regulation. We're kind of seeing, hopefully, a combination of those two that will catalyze large blockchain market shares increases over time. It's my personal view that one or a handful of very small handful of l ones are going to capture the lion's share of that value. There'll be some interoperability, like all these bridges that have come out.
00:25:59.374 - 00:26:14.900, Speaker A: That market share is very volatile. It comes and goes. It seems to me like the bridging market is being taken up by increasingly coinbase and rails that are regulated in some.
00:26:16.550 - 00:26:17.186, Speaker C: As the.
00:26:17.208 - 00:26:56.910, Speaker A: As a portfolio manager, I'm trying to kind of hold these collection of call options in the right proportion so that the chain and the token that captures what I think is going to be the lion's share value is at least in the portfolio. And then we're kind of like constantly handicapping those probabilities and trying to hold the coins in proper ratios. So maybe that value is split between a monolithic and a modular. Maybe it's all modular, maybe it's all monolithic. But within those two categories, ETH and Solana are clear winners, at least from my perspective. And so those are my largest.
00:26:57.890 - 00:27:23.586, Speaker B: You may have, I think you talked about this on Bangalores to some degree. And Matthew, I think you commented as well. This is when you wrote the report on Ethereum, and the base case for that by 2030 was 11,000 something dollars. And one big factor you talked about were the l two s. And is there going to be a long tail distribution of l two s, or will you have a few that almost have more negotiation power over ETH? So the more commoditized, in some ways, that these l two s are, the less differentiated they are, the less power they would have over Ethereum.
00:27:23.618 - 00:27:24.486, Speaker C: But if you had, like, two or.
00:27:24.508 - 00:27:47.300, Speaker B: Three, they might be able to say like, hey, we have the users here. We could actually go off and go to Celestia or do something else. I'm just curious, has your vision evolved on how you see the l two landscape playing out? Because at one point I think every app thought they needed a roll app. And then it was like, okay, no, we just need a few l two s. But then those l two s are all going to have frameworks with their own roll app. So I'm curious how you think about that.
00:27:49.590 - 00:28:34.160, Speaker C: Yeah, it's kind of difficult because when you go back to the heart of it, Ethereum was changing its whole business model. And what's become more and more clear that there's different entities that will be doing different things that process and sell down to Ethereum or whatever. And so really what we're talking about, whether it's l two s or data availability, there's some sort of taxing rate on Ethereum at some point. And so it's like from a system standpoint, it's like Ethereum by itself. Execution, data availability, settlements, consensus, that's one value proposition. But then if you start sharding it off into different components, then it becomes much more different. And so from my standpoint, I'm starting to see the commodification of the l two s.
00:28:34.160 - 00:29:26.274, Speaker C: I could see a lot of paths for that. But at the same time I also see reasons why execution won't exist on Ethereum. So maybe you have something like chain, like automation, or you have risk zero, or you even have uniswap x, right, where you can move a lot of the transactions off chain. And so I'm not quite sure how that tick rate is going to play out. It's difficult to say because imagine what if Ethereum starts enshrining l two s, those become like dominant paradigm and then they could probably extract more value from that. And so it's so in flux right now, it's really hard for me to say. My views change quite a bit, but at the same time I could see something materially changing just because again, just thinking about all these different entities that they might have, maybe the execution becomes the dominant value accrual component of this, right? Maybe not.
00:29:26.274 - 00:29:54.954, Speaker C: But if it does, that's obviously not good for Ethereum. So it's really hard to say what's going to happen with that. But we're definitely thinking about it. So it wasn't a perfect answer for you of Garrett, I'm sorry, but it's a rapidly evolving space. But that's a potential bear case for Ethereum, right? It's chosen settlement DA layer, maybe lots of competition with DA. Maybe like the DA network effects don't matter. Maybe the DA other factors don't matter.
00:29:54.954 - 00:30:21.394, Speaker C: Maybe you don't even really need a valuable DA layer. Maybe you have multiple DA layers. I don't know. Maybe the bridging value of Ethereum as a settlement system, that's all that matters, right? Since there's value there, do you bring it elsewhere? Maybe that's not really valuable. So the way in which they're kind of gluing all together is through this case for like, okay, east mock money. And we can export that money to other ecosystems and kind of give it like security or whatever. So that could help it.
00:30:21.394 - 00:30:30.294, Speaker C: But from the initial standpoint of how we understand chains today, then it does seem like it's changed a bit more bearishly, for sure. Yeah.
00:30:30.332 - 00:31:09.418, Speaker A: If you look at the volatility of l two tokens versus ETH, it's at least two to one, oftentimes three to one. And then if you look at the underlying volatility of market share of TVL or transactions or users, l two volatility is similarly like a two to three X what ETH is. So when allocating capital, that volatility matters a lot. And for me personally, it's reflected in just order of magnitude difference in position sizes.
00:31:09.514 - 00:31:36.322, Speaker B: Quick break to tell you about an upcoming event I promise you don't want to miss. It's blockwork's biggest and best institutional conference, called Daslon London. It's a two day event happening in London this March, where we're going to have over 700 institutions, 130 speakers, and a couple of thousand of us all under one roof. Crypto is in a position for the first time to actually onboard these institutions, and they're showing up. We have companies from BlackRock to visa launching real products in the space. We have the real world asset narrative taking off. We have things like payments that have been exponentially growing, and then we have things like deepen happening in the salana ecosystem.
00:31:36.322 - 00:31:58.746, Speaker B: There's a ton of capital right now in this institutional space that's going to be coming on chain. It's to completely change the industry. Whether you are an institution or you're a retail user, or you just want to learn more about what's going on in the space, this conference is for you. You're going to be able to meet some of the best and smartest people in the space. The speaker lineup is absolutely incredible, and you'll get to hang out with me, but the best part is you actually get 20% off your ticket. If you use light speed 20 when checking out, that's light speed 20. I put a link in the show notes.
00:31:58.746 - 00:32:06.822, Speaker B: I recommend buying this today because, one, you'll forget about it. Two, these ticket prices go up every single month. So anyways, I hope to see you there. Now, let's get back to the show.
00:32:06.876 - 00:32:21.930, Speaker D: Matt, you're using metrics such as TBL to assess some aspect of these ecosystems. I'm curious what metrics you guys like using to compare ecosystems and what metrics you just don't believe in and maybe are overrated.
00:32:24.590 - 00:33:05.990, Speaker A: Well, first, I believe in price. The market usually pumps for a reason, and in this asset class, you have to respect the pump because that's capital formation, right? That's what makes this asset class unique. That's why it has recovering CFA. And my Twitter bio is because crypto enables a different form of capital formation that traditional DCFs don't account for. So, yeah, we're looking at price, we're looking at transactions, we're trying to look at repeat users. Sometimes that's harder data to find. That's something Patrick's done a good job of trying to isolate.
00:33:05.990 - 00:33:47.266, Speaker A: Definitely. Fees, especially during the bear market, we really tilted towards profitable blockchains, which functionally meant large overweights in ETH. And we're looking for that inflection point where fees are accelerating and issuance is decelerating. And that's where you can often find the most explosive price performance. So I'd use some examples, like kind of render would be one that came to market with a lot of hype. Tons of issuance token was up to $5, then crashes back down to one. But under the hood, you can see like, oh, users are starting to pick up, partnerships are starting to pick up.
00:33:47.266 - 00:33:51.366, Speaker A: People are using this product, but we're in the trough of disillusionment for the price.
00:33:51.468 - 00:33:53.560, Speaker C: And that's where we try to put.
00:33:53.930 - 00:34:09.626, Speaker A: More substantial capital to work is to find those types of projects that describe those as the sweet spot. Like a year, two years after launch, there's been tons of inflation. The early holders are disillusioned, but users are coming in. Okay, we want to bet big on.
00:34:09.648 - 00:34:10.220, Speaker C: That.
00:34:12.130 - 00:34:26.610, Speaker D: And talking about respecting the pump. The Ethereum ETF was announced, and there was some news about that recently. What are your thoughts on that? And do you think we ever see a Solana ETF?
00:34:28.710 - 00:35:24.162, Speaker A: So by the Ethereum ETF being announced, I think you're probably referring to the headline on the tape yesterday, November 9, that BlackRock is looking to file for spot ETH ETF Vanak filed for that years ago and refiled in September. So there is an application pending. The deadline for the current round of applications is May of next year. So let's get these BTC products off the ground. But it does appear like we're on a glide path towards having spot ETH ETFs by spring of next year. Remember, these already exist in Canada, in Europe, spot bitcoin ETFs around the world have taken in more than $500 million in flows in the last month. The year to date number is 650.
00:35:24.162 - 00:35:31.240, Speaker A: So we're doing like three quarters of the flows in the last four weeks. Yeah, I'm not going to quite answer the Solana question.
00:35:33.050 - 00:36:00.030, Speaker D: And actually that brings up an interesting question. Maybe it's the crypto degen and. But so obviously there's Vanak, there's Blackrock. But I would say you guys are, with your Twitter presence, with the Vanak Twitter account, I would say maybe like a fan favorite. And I'm curious how you guys think about maybe the community aspect of crypto and kind of competition amongst kind of other types of asset managers in crypto.
00:36:01.730 - 00:36:33.046, Speaker A: Yeah, this is a participatory asset class. The whole point is to hold your own keys and custody your own coins. Everyone is at their own point in the lifecycle of investing. Some people, if they're investing for their kids, they don't want to hold the coins. They want a regulated custodian to hold them. They want to be able to see it in their brokerage account, which is kind of what an ETF enables. So we think it's important to touch these smart contracts directly.
00:36:33.046 - 00:37:26.330, Speaker A: We have a community NFT project on ETH. We're bringing to market some NFT functionality with this segment product that you'll see coming out soon. So we're donating 10% of the revenues from EfUT, which is our Ethereum futures product, back to protocol guild, which is the community of open source ETH developers. We're exploring similar things for bitcoin. When you look at surveys of all the wealth that the boomers have and how much of that is going to be given to the next generation, and then what they're going to invest in, we're going after that part of the market. And if we can build that community, then when those folks need someone else to hold their keys instead of doing it themselves, then we're right next to them. So thanks for the shout out.
00:37:26.330 - 00:37:28.842, Speaker A: Get out there and look at our ETFs and please buy them.
00:37:28.896 - 00:37:42.078, Speaker B: Thinking about the model that you guys had. Again, it's really a DCF that you run on both Salana and Ethereum back in the day, and over 67% of the cash flow that you have is coming from MeV or the value. So MeV is a huge factor here.
00:37:42.244 - 00:37:43.646, Speaker C: But my bigger question is just running.
00:37:43.668 - 00:38:23.646, Speaker B: A DCF to model L1s. What else are you looking at? Is that really the biggest factor? Because to me, l ones are so hard to value as a DCCF in some ways, because it's more of like the GDP of an economy that you're looking at. Our analysts talk about this all the time when you have applications. To me, like DCFs are a little bit more straightforward, like Dydx. Now they have their own app chain, so that does change some things, but especially like an application on top of Solana. But then again, if the biggest money in the space and the institutions all use the DCF, whether that's the best way to think about value or not, if everyone's kind of converging on that analysis, then objectively it is the best way to value an ecosystem. So I'm just curious how you think about it, only using a DCF to value an L1, or like maybe.
00:38:23.668 - 00:38:24.880, Speaker C: What else you look at?
00:38:25.410 - 00:39:21.470, Speaker A: Sure, I'll go first. We think one of the advantages we have in this space is as close to permanent capital as you can get. Jan has extremely strong conviction. He's the largest investor in our token strategies, and he wants us to be looking at the winners over 2510 years and not focused on the month to month. So that's what the DCF really lets you do, is bring your long term vision into the space and see how the market is valuing things now. So I think there are other metrics, price to TVL, price to fees, and all those are relevant for contextualizing the current state of the market, but they don't do a great job of bringing some creativity into how the market may value it in the future. But curious to hear from you, Patrick.
00:39:21.470 - 00:39:29.134, Speaker A: You built this DCF. What other metrics do you think people are looking at?
00:39:29.172 - 00:40:12.254, Speaker C: No, I had guidance from the Michelangelo, the project, and his name might be Matthew. I'm just a simple artisan, the working man, this blue collar and his hard hat. I don't know. Because you're trying to project the world in the future doesn't exist, and you're trying to say, okay, here's the things that happen, and glue back to a price. And the whole point of the exercise is like, okay, what's potential for this? What's a possibility. And going through a DCF is like, it's kind of a metric that we're kind of meaning into existence, because logically you can value it in other ways, like usership or how active those users are. User attrition, TVL, stablecoins, right.
00:40:12.254 - 00:40:46.954, Speaker C: Transactions, whatever, right? And so I think it's the best way because you're glueing the value to something that people understand who are going to invest in it. And with all different kinds of memes of investing, whether it's like price of sales or price equity or whatever, the new ones are, right? It's all about people care about that. And the point in which we're doing is just setting the floor. What's the expectation? What should we be looking for? Why should we looking at it? How is it something you already know? So it's kind of like giving someone like, hey, here's this new thing. But actually it's kind of like this old thing. So here's why it makes sense. Here's how you value it.
00:40:46.954 - 00:41:27.494, Speaker C: And so that's why I think the DCF is like a really good way of looking at it, because then tradfi brain just says, yeah, asset money up, good multiple, right? That's just how it works. And so I think it's a really good tool. And like any other tool, it can be used effectively, certain things, but other ways suboptimal. So realistically, if you want to look at profitability, there's no such thing as that. But then saying, okay, what percentage of money is going to exist versus going out for the token? And that's what matters at the end of the day. And we thought that a DCI for some kind of economic value of what's going on, there is a good way of doing that. And again, glue into something people understand.
00:41:27.494 - 00:41:34.666, Speaker C: They get Uber as a business, they get Amazon, they get the App Store. And so that's kind of like how we went about business.
00:41:34.768 - 00:42:16.440, Speaker A: And when you think about the number one critique of digital assets is that there's no intrinsic value there, but the way that some of these tokens are architected, there will be value that flows back to the token holder. And it's our job to try to size that value and then value it based on a terminal cash flow. So we're taxing these cash flows before we DCF them. We're really imagining a world that open source blockchains are comprising 5% to 10% of the value across our financial networks. So it'll be integrated with existing financial system.
00:42:17.450 - 00:42:40.590, Speaker D: One thing I'm curious about. We've talked a lot about Ethereum and Salana and the different perspectives on open source blockchains. We haven't really touched on cosmos. So I am curious if you guys have any thoughts on value capture and kind of institutional mind share of something like Cosmos and app chains and how you guys think about those ecosystems.
00:42:41.570 - 00:42:42.320, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:42:44.150 - 00:44:03.430, Speaker A: The way we think about the positions in general is that we have kind of core positions where product market fit is established, tokenomics are reasonably clear, and the ecosystem is flourishing. And those positions are multiples, the size of the fringe positions where maybe product market fit is established but not at scale, or tokenomics are not completely sorted, or there's major lockups that are coming and those positions are much smaller. And then there's moonshots where this is true venture, and maybe the tokens, maybe there's no product market fit, maybe there's no product, and those positions maybe in a word of magnitude, even smaller than that. So in the first bucket, it's really like ETH and Solana and then Cosmos. From a fund manager's perspective, just the monetization seems to be still very contested and a lot of things that are up in the air, but the technical. Patrick's long been a fan of kind of how the chain is architected. The technical characteristics of it hold a lot of promise.
00:44:03.430 - 00:44:05.226, Speaker A: And last couple of weeks, we're starting.
00:44:05.248 - 00:44:41.206, Speaker C: To see those inflows looking at something like the cosmos. Why I thought it was interesting was that you get to build your own chain. And I think that was fascinating from the standpoint of being like a uniswap or something that is able to suddenly capture all the value that's leaked to Ethereum. But it's become clear over time to me, like, building that is a massive lift, and it takes a lot more engineering talent and, quite frankly, funding. But I think once an application becomes mature, that's kind of the ideal place to do something, at least like an app chain. It doesn't have to be the cosmos can be l two or whatever. And so cosmos always had the interesting approach of like, okay, here's how you build.
00:44:41.206 - 00:45:18.850, Speaker C: You can build a chain, here's the software for it. Do what you need to do. Use tendermints like bootstrap is consensus, and then you can glue it using some sort of mechanism to understand how your application works relative to the blockchain. And so you have this asset blockchain. And so the problem I have, from a value accrual standpoint at least, like, the atom token is like, what's the. So what? Why are you going to buy security from them? Why not somewhere else? I guess the biggest thing people will be like, oh, well, the atom token is like, the most valuable. The other one is because of the way in which tendermint's design the cosmos works, is that tender is like an allegorical system.
00:45:18.850 - 00:46:07.140, Speaker C: So it's like you'll see the same top 1020 validators in all these chains. So say there's 64 chains right now. You'll see Cosmos station, bobble or friends validator, whatever, all these. Right? And so the problem I have is like, okay, if you're going to build a security hub and you want to make sure that this new bootstrapping chain gets like the validator said it needs, why do you really need to go to the cosmos hub? Why would you just go to the validators itself? Because the validators themselves right now are kind of like vetted entities. Everyone knows who they are, and everyone kind of understands that through a social consensus layer, if they do something bad at one chain, they'll probably lose a visit to another chain. And so to some standpoint, it doesn't really seem that cosmos probably be necessary. If that's the way you view it, does that make sense to you guys? How do you see that?
00:46:09.830 - 00:46:40.794, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I have a lot of friends in Cosmos, so I'm not going to say anything too crazy, but I agree that especially you're framing on kind of the so what, right. I think there's still a lot of unanswered questions there. I do think it makes sense for some folks who are comfortable being in their own islands, like a Duidx, and maybe they want full vertical control from a technical perspective. But the economics, I think there's just too much to be worked out there.
00:46:40.832 - 00:46:45.120, Speaker C: Still, at least for the Adam, for the Cosmos hub. Right?
00:46:46.210 - 00:47:12.626, Speaker D: Yeah. So, I mean, the oligarchical system that you said, that's an interesting way to put it, but it's actually pretty true. Some people might argue that they're very involved validators, and that's kind of what you need. And there's a lot of kind of governance, and cosmos is kind of known for that, as opposed to something like Ethereum or other networks where there's these institutional validators who kind of control most of everything. So there's some trade offs.
00:47:12.658 - 00:47:17.526, Speaker C: But, yeah, I like Matthew and how.
00:47:17.548 - 00:47:24.614, Speaker D: He'S categorized this, which is like, there's like, the core positions and there's kind of the fringe positions, which might be useful. And I think I would personally align.
00:47:24.662 - 00:47:35.738, Speaker C: With that, a lot of interesting things going on in the cosmos, for sure. And I'm a fan of a lot of the projects. I think that something to be said about these people who are building there. But yeah, they've just really struggled to.
00:47:35.744 - 00:47:55.606, Speaker B: Find like a cohesive narrative. And I think that's really hard. One of the great things about the cosmos is that you do have complete sovereignty, but because of that, you don't have something that's simple to understand. There's no clear message. I think Ethereum is really easy to understand from ETH, like this maximal decentralization. And then you have Solana, which focuses on speed and low latency and high throughput. It's pretty easy to understand where cosmos just lack that completely.
00:47:55.606 - 00:48:23.642, Speaker B: I do think the tech is kind of there. But one thing you're seeing across all ecosystems is a convergence, right? Like you're seeing that we talked about the end game with Vitalik. I think he posted that in December 2021. Like the end game for Salana and Ethereum are very similar, where you have the beefy builders and then you have where end users can verify the chain, and then kind of the same thing is happening with cosmos. It's like app chains, but now you're going to the shared security model is what they're leaning into. And that's really the way that they're trying to have value accrual for Adam. And in some ways, every chain kind of has this.
00:48:23.642 - 00:48:45.878, Speaker B: Maybe Slan is one big difference is right now they're not looking at L2 app solutions at all. But you do have the SVM that popped up this year, like eclipse bringing the SVM to Ethereum. So anyways, it's just really interesting. I do think cosmos kind of struggles there. But I'm curious, when you guys are thinking about crypto, how much do you think about macro in general? Is that something that you're paying attention to? I know you're looking at 2510 years out.
00:48:46.044 - 00:49:43.960, Speaker A: Yeah, we're definitely looking at macro. Jan describes our house as a macro thematic shop. His investments in crypto span from venture to BTC and ETH to these private funds. And I can observe that his and the firm's macro views impacted his check writing activity over the last two years. Like, he basically stopped writing checks into venture a couple years ago. And a lot of the ways that our active portfolios were positioned reflected like the tougher fed liquidity backdrop. So that's beginning to change somewhat and the setup looks a lot better for next year.
00:49:43.960 - 00:50:44.362, Speaker A: And then on a tactical basis, it kind of depends on the strategy. One thing we're quite proud of is derisking our liquid token exposure. Right. When the coindesk article came out about FTT a year ago. And was that a macro observation? Kind of, but not really. But having a global presence, like traders on multiple continents, an operations department that is used to handling 24/7 transactions, heavy focus on compliance, that we think gives us some extra skills in navigating very volatile and tricky markets, and we think we've executed well on that. But yondols out the money, and if there's crypto money, he wants it invested in crypto, not in cash, for long periods of time.
00:50:44.362 - 00:51:06.210, Speaker A: So generally, with these strategies, we're long only, we're directional. We may be in a little bit of cash from time to time, depending on the macro, but we're not shorting. We don't want to take counterparty risk with trying to hedge positions. We basically want to be long, strong, and then avoid the worst of the downdrafts.
00:51:07.910 - 00:51:47.966, Speaker C: I want to add one thing that doesn't have to do with macro. It's more geopolitics. And I will say for the last 30 calls, 40 years, you've had kind of a unipolarity in the international geopolitical system. Right. United States has been dominating, and alongside that, you've had domination by United States financial system. And I think we're at a moment where we're moving more towards a multipolar, maybe even a bipolar kind of setup, where there's definitely China, maybe Russia, maybe India, maybe whoever else has come into play. And I think because of that, crypto straddles an interesting paradigm where it's like a neutral financial system.
00:51:47.966 - 00:52:05.138, Speaker C: So, logically, if you have a unipolar system, geopolitically, the backschill unipolar financial system, you suddenly have come to a place where, okay, maybe there's multipolarity geopolitically, why not multipolarian financial system? And I think that's kind of like crypto is at the moment where it.
00:52:05.144 - 00:52:06.802, Speaker A: Could actually prove that it could be.
00:52:06.856 - 00:52:23.850, Speaker C: Like, a financial system that's credibly neutral, right. That's outside of the paradigm of the control of one of these major powers. And that's why. That's why I'm always really fascinating about this. And then stepping back to something like visa. Visa kind of already takes this as is. And what I mean by that is to visa.
00:52:23.850 - 00:52:35.354, Speaker C: Visa is not necessarily building things on Solana. Right. It's more like you say, hey, here's like a network. I can use. I can use Ethereum, I can use Solana. If people want to sell, use that. I'll dang it, I'll do it for them.
00:52:35.354 - 00:52:52.498, Speaker C: Right. That's kind of like the essence of what they're doing. And so that's how I feel like crypto is right now. It's a new place where people can transact value globally outside of the system. That's under the purview of some kind of dominant entity. Now, that's not the house view. We're us based.
00:52:52.498 - 00:52:54.414, Speaker C: But that's why I see it potentially.
00:52:54.542 - 00:53:32.090, Speaker A: No, but that's a great point about the multipolarity, because our active strategies, we have emerging market equities, active strategy and market to market bonds. Active strategies. And the bond team allocates almost entirely based on what's going on in the politics and the geopolitics of the countries that they analyze. We were early to be bullish on El Salvador. Made a lot of returns in El Salvador fixed income last year. El Salvador has just upgraded again by S P yesterday. Economy keeps outperforming there, partially because of the bitcoin gambit.
00:53:32.090 - 00:53:51.990, Speaker A: So there's a lot of cross pollination on the geopolitics and most of our shop is pretty aligned that as Patrick says, crypto is a neutral alternative for a lot of frontier and emerging markets that financially privileged in the US generally don't even think about. So it creates a lot of alpha opportunities.
00:53:52.810 - 00:54:29.058, Speaker D: Yeah, that's really well put. I like your mental models on that. And how I like the visa example of facilitating payments. Just use a tool that gets the job done. I am curious if you guys have either personally or maybe through the Vanex side, if you guys have any interest in specific verticals in crypto. So like for example, deep in with helium or deFi, specifically payments, any verticals you definitely don't care for, maybe like NFTs. Although I know you just mentioned you guys have like a community NFt thing coming out.
00:54:29.058 - 00:54:31.330, Speaker D: What are your thoughts on the different verticals?
00:54:32.550 - 00:55:38.258, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess the use cases that we're excited about, like buying and hodling bitcoin. I frankly think that a lot of the activity in the space is just people finding new and interesting things to do once they're holding on to paper. BTC profits, stablecoins as a new payment rails nfts as a form factor for Fortune 500 companies. And deepen because world is hungry for physical infrastructure with lower take rates than verizon and at T and Uber, just to put it very simply. And we think that consumers can really get excited about bootstrapping physical infrastructure projects with crypto at its core. So we did make an investment in hive Mapper, which is a dash cam mapping project on Solana. And I'd say deepen kind of punches above its weight in the various strategies compared to the product market fit that's been found so far.
00:55:38.258 - 00:55:46.140, Speaker A: So these are kind of moonshot projects, but we think a handful of them kind of have to work for the whole space to work.
00:55:48.030 - 00:55:49.190, Speaker C: What about you, Patrick?
00:55:49.270 - 00:55:50.494, Speaker B: What's your favorite thing?
00:55:50.532 - 00:56:16.786, Speaker C: Crypto. I really love the disingregation narrative where you have all these entities. They're just rent seeking. They're taking too much. Like, think about Uber. Uber is taking, I think, something like 30% to 40% of what the driver is making and extrapolating that, that doesn't seem like a fair way of doing it. I think there's a lot of room for disrupting them.
00:56:16.786 - 00:56:52.810, Speaker C: But what is that premise on? It's premise on building a new network and having a new bunch of drivers that are able to do that, people using it. I think crypto offers the best way of doing that. So I think I like something like teleport, which is a Solana project. I think helium, super interesting, like how it was able to boot trip this massive ecosystem. They got to over a million hotspots. And don't get me wrong, IoT doesn't seem like the ideal place for getting value, but going in towards mobile, that's really cool. $5 mobile plan, that's incredible.
00:56:52.810 - 00:57:54.254, Speaker C: And they're going to be expanding that to the whole United States. That's something that no one else is doing. There's other projects like giant protocol. It's not on Solana, but it's building a decentralized trading of mobile bandwidth. And so those are the kinds of things that impact people's lives every single day. You can look and be like, okay, well, I don't know how this is happening, but it's affecting my life. I talked to this project called Composable Finance, and they conditioned a study where they looked at way people in Lebanon, merchants interact with the blockchain, and most of them didn't even know that they were using a blockchain product, right? Most of them just know TRC 20, right? They exchange payments using USDT, and they see the applications, they'll see the Tron wallet as they would like anything in traditional finance, like a we payer or whatever else, right? And so just like, not even knowing it's on crypto is important, touching people's lives that that becomes a really useful use case for the stock.
00:57:54.254 - 00:57:58.760, Speaker C: So that's like a sliver of some of the things that I really like.
00:57:59.290 - 00:58:02.600, Speaker B: Yeah, I love those. Do you want to do a rapid fire today?
00:58:03.450 - 00:58:18.620, Speaker D: Yeah, we can do a quick one. Sweet. All right, so Matthew, Patrick, I'm just going to ask some random questions and just answer with the first thing that comes to your mind. And if you don't want to answer, that's fine. If you want to expand further, it's fine as.
00:58:19.230 - 00:58:21.450, Speaker C: Right. So if.
00:58:21.600 - 00:58:34.020, Speaker D: Okay, assume you are showing a family member crypto for the first time. Which application do you show them to convince them to use crypto. And let's go, Matthew. And then Patrick, in order, every time.
00:58:38.230 - 00:59:24.450, Speaker A: I'm showing them a chart of bitcoin versus every other asset class in the world on a one, three, five and ten year basis. And then I'm showing them this new cold wallet that I just got, which is called Arculus. It's a metal credit card with NFC technology inside. This company has like 80% market share in metal credit cards that they make for American Express and JPMorgan. And they've got patents where they can put the NFC technology into the metal credit card. And that's like the core business, which is 99% of their business. But they just launched this cold wallet.
00:59:24.450 - 01:00:17.810, Speaker A: And it's my thesis that eventually, once 100 million, 200 million Americans own bitcoin, that they'll be spending their crypto and their fiat off of the same card. And it'll be something like this with like three FA and a combination of custodial fiat, self custodial crypto. I don't mean to just pump my own PA bags here, but I think it's a very innovative use case. And I would remind them that we were able to sell our USDC the weekend that SVB went under, and we were able to sell that USDC on a weekend and buy ETH, which had much more upside on Monday. And that's transaction that you can't make in fiat. So I think that's how I would describe it.
01:00:17.880 - 01:01:02.174, Speaker C: I'm a little more ideologically motivated by the space because of the potential. And it's something like data ownership, I think is really important to me. And all these bread seeking extracted value, these bother me. So my family kind of knows that I'm a weirdo like that. So I would show them something like demo, where I'm like, hey, demo is something that plugs into your car and tracks your car and gives whoever you want to sell that data to the ability to buy that data, and then you get value for that, as opposed to Google, where you're getting value out of the product for sure, but probably not as much relative to what your data is worth. So I like having that idea of data sovereignty and the ability to sell it. And I think having a demo, there's a lot of.
01:01:02.174 - 01:01:18.500, Speaker C: So what's right you can do out of like you can eventually have an NFT, your car on there, you could have it tracked, you could have it standardized to when you sell your car, you go through an NFT and send some paper entity. So I think it's something that's really interesting that could potentially impact people's lives.
01:01:19.110 - 01:01:46.366, Speaker A: I'm going to give another answer just because mine was too long. I'm just going to say also that I would invite them to take a drive in my car with me and watch me earn money by mapping my surroundings with the hive mapper dash, and then show them the money that shows up in the phantom wallet every week and explain that we are taking a chunk out of Google's margins 1.1 kilometer at a time and we're going to own this network. That's the most captivating use case in.
01:01:46.388 - 01:01:57.650, Speaker D: All of crypto, actually, I have a hive mapper dash cam right here. So, yeah, big fan. Okay, so we talk about what you would show them. What would you advise them to not do in crypto?
01:01:58.150 - 01:02:30.458, Speaker A: I think that retail investors should stay away from leverage, generally speaking, that most of the pain of the last cycle was due to folks borrowing money irresponsibly in a super volatile asset class. And we should avoid that. Right? Look at all the bitcoin miners that went bankrupt and had to restructure. They've all now learned their lesson, by the way, and they're all sporting much, much cleaner balance sheets. I hope that retail investors can follow that advice in the next cycle.
01:02:30.554 - 01:02:51.362, Speaker C: Yeah, I would tell them to avoid influencers. There's just so much dissemination of false information out there that gets people to do things that are suboptimal, pushes them into scams, whatever else. So I would caution them against that. That'd be probably my one thing. Okay.
01:02:51.416 - 01:03:33.230, Speaker A: I mean, I've changed my mind completely on bitcoin's role in a smart, contract oriented portfolio or strategy. So I had a view that bitcoin was really distinct and one's allocation should be thought of almost separately to allocation to smart contract protocols and dapps. And I've changed my mind on that. I think that there's enough going on at the bitcoin l two level to make it a reasonable alternative for certain applications.
01:03:33.730 - 01:03:36.622, Speaker C: And yeah, that's been a change.
01:03:36.756 - 01:03:38.430, Speaker A: No one else on the team agrees.
01:03:41.190 - 01:03:48.280, Speaker C: Honestly, Matthew, I wasn't listening. I was trying to think of my own cool and I still don't know the answer.
01:03:48.650 - 01:03:52.280, Speaker A: I think Patrick changes mind every month.
01:03:53.130 - 01:04:47.670, Speaker C: Yeah, I tend to do think. Okay, the biggest one probably would be nfts, like a year, a year and a half ago, or let's go back like two or three years ago was just like, to me, like a speculative nonsense vehicle and just seeing what something like backpack has been able to do and was potentially possible in terms of identity or showing some sort of debt position or whatever. NFTs really expands the use case. And I think there is a lot more than meets the eye. And I think that we're talking about modeling it today based upon like, oh, it's going to be art collectibles in the future and having some sort of similar modeling exercise that we do where it gets a percentage of that market. Right. But that's not the way you do it.
01:04:47.670 - 01:04:58.540, Speaker C: There's a massive potential to all the things that you could do. I was so remiss in being dismissive of that. So that's something. I've changed my mind.
01:04:59.070 - 01:05:00.310, Speaker D: That's a good one.
01:05:00.480 - 01:05:01.294, Speaker C: Okay.
01:05:01.492 - 01:05:06.910, Speaker D: What is the number one mistake you see investors making in the space position?
01:05:06.980 - 01:05:07.870, Speaker A: Sizing.
01:05:09.650 - 01:05:10.400, Speaker C: Just.
01:05:12.390 - 01:05:16.530, Speaker A: Putting too much in overly risky assets.
01:05:21.910 - 01:05:57.840, Speaker C: I would riff on that and say not having an invalidation point and sticking to it, I think it really matters that you come into an investment with an understanding of when you take it off, when you kick out of it, or whatever else. And if you don't do that, you let things run against you because you start justifying your position, you start looking for the narratives, you start the cycle of hope, and that usually leads to very poor investment. So that's the biggest thing. And then being emotional about the investment, those are the kind of having a weird attachment to it for some reason.
01:05:58.450 - 01:06:06.258, Speaker D: Okay, final question. What is your ideal state of crypto in five years? What do you want to see happen?
01:06:06.424 - 01:07:24.106, Speaker A: I would like to see central banks buying bitcoin for their reserves as a way of kind of validating the stranded assets that have resulted from this maniacal focus on net zero. I think that printing too much money has been really bad for some of the poorest countries in the world, and they're finally seeing an opportunity to distance themselves from that fed based money printing and using bitcoin to capture methane or excess flared gas. And turning that into a state reserve is a fantastically powerful narrative that is going to grow. So really excited to see what's going on. And hopefully in Argentina on the 19th, where Malay's ODs has been rising, I noticed that the largest private argentinian oil and gas company just announced plans to start mining crypto with their vented methane. So really hopeful that that narrative takes off. It does seem like the world is starting to cancel this unrealistic net zero narrative, and I am here for it.
01:07:24.288 - 01:08:14.254, Speaker C: I would like to see crypto force the data juggernauts to give something back to the people that provide that data and generate that data. I would like to see that generate something that leads to a bill or some sort of way which gives people data rights to data privacy. And I think crypto could be a vector for that. That's kind of like my big hope is that it's able to disintermediate a lot of these rent seeking entities in general, and that it's able to provide value to the people. The people actually who are making things are providing services to the real economy rather than being directed through some entity that just has a huge take rate on their productive activity. So I think it expands the ability of people to actually get value for their work. And no, I'm not a communist.
01:08:14.402 - 01:08:29.600, Speaker A: No, but you're right, Patrick. The biggest deflationary impulses usually lead to consumer welfare gains broadly, right. And like, a number of entrenched losers and then consumers in general benefit. And that's why we're both here.
01:08:30.370 - 01:08:43.460, Speaker B: Yeah, I love those answers. Matthew, Patrick, thanks so much for coming on. I think everyone's probably blown away in how deep you are in this space. We're really lucky to have you, to have in such a professional firm like Van X. So thank you so much for coming on. It's a lot of fun.
01:08:44.230 - 01:08:45.620, Speaker A: Thanks for having us.
