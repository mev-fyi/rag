00:00:00.170 - 00:00:24.362, Speaker A: There's going to be a lot of next gen blockchains that can compete with Salana from a technical perspective, but you're never going to see any L One launch at the same valuation that Salana launched at. Just because of how well Salana did in public market VCs are not going to let that happen. And people had time to essentially get into the community at those low price levels. And that community aspect is one of the most important pieces of building out an L One blockchain.
00:00:24.426 - 00:00:54.346, Speaker B: This episode brought to you by Jito. Jito is the easiest way to start earning mev rewards on Solana through Liquid staking. Get your soul, stake it with Jeeto, and get instant access to liquidity through their liquid staking token. Jito soul get started today at what's up, everybody? Welcome to another episode of Lightspeed. Today we are joined by Ansem. If you don't know Ansem, he's one of the top traders in the space. He's also huge on Twitter.
00:00:54.346 - 00:01:01.226, Speaker B: He likes to shit post, but he also has a lot of alpha and really clear and concise tweets. So, Ansem, thanks for joining.
00:01:01.418 - 00:01:03.294, Speaker A: Yo, what's good, guys? Thanks for having me on.
00:01:03.332 - 00:01:37.338, Speaker B: Yeah, man, pumped to have you here. Actually, two years ago, I wrote down the top ten people in the space based on the takes that they were giving out. And yesterday we interviewed Kyle Somani, and he was on there. And then, Ansem, you were also on there. So I'm pumped to have you on. I think one thing people don't know about you is maybe they see your Twitter post a lot of your shit posting, but they probably or maybe haven't read your articles. And you're a very clear thinker and I'd love to touch on what you I think this blog was from March 2022, and you started it by saying one of the favorite phrases that you took out of the pandemic was terminally online.
00:01:37.338 - 00:01:42.982, Speaker B: And I want to know what that phrase means to you and why it's relevant to crypto and where the space is headed.
00:01:43.046 - 00:01:59.060, Speaker A: Yeah, I can talk about that a bit. So as a kid, I was a big gamer. I was always online. So I played a ton of World of Warcraft. I played League of Legends, like the backyard football games, all that. I played on a computer. I actually played with my dad a ton.
00:01:59.060 - 00:02:57.662, Speaker A: I was the kid who would get my work done and then stay on the computer until, like, two, three a. M. And just be gaming. But it's like recently, that trend of being online has converted into making a ton of money, not just in crypto, but also in gaming, like Esports, all of that. And I think during COVID you kind of saw that accelerate a ton, and then people were just home all the time and trying to figure out, okay, I'm not making as much money as I want to at my regular job. How can I make money online, and there's just a ton of people that are online, I think more and more and more and CL talks about it, I think a good way very eloquently. The metaverse is not strictly like games and video games, but just people being online and being in that online state, having their own online persona that's different from what they have in real life and in crypto, if you do that in the right way, you can convert that into actual capital.
00:02:57.662 - 00:03:15.110, Speaker A: If you are able to follow the trends of attention and where people are looking just like narratives in crypto, as well as the space and just how it's moving, that's kind of generally what it means for me. I've been online all the time and then obviously pretty much converted into being in crypto.
00:03:15.190 - 00:03:39.246, Speaker B: More and more people are spending more time online. One of the use cases for like, NFTs is people want to own more online because they're spending more time online, they're having their networks online, et cetera. And I think what you've written about and who you are really represents that. One of the things you said used to play a lot were games. And I know in your writings you talked about DeFi kingdoms a lot. What is it that drew you to DeFi kingdoms and crypto gaming and why you thought it was so unique?
00:03:39.358 - 00:04:14.019, Speaker A: Well, for me, trading crypto is essentially a video game in itself. On its own, it's a video game that you can make money on. But DeFi kingdoms was the first application that I saw. I've been bridging to basically every new chain that dropped a DeFi incentive program. I was bridging, I bridged AVAX, I bridged what to harmony phantom, like all those different places had DEXes where you would do the yield farming. I know you guys know that the dex, you look for the dog coin, you look for whatever the borrow lending coin. And that was like the early playbook sensor for people who were doing stuff on chain in 2021.
00:04:14.019 - 00:05:10.426, Speaker A: And then DFI kingdoms was the first application that I saw in crypto. I was like, oh, this is not just a dex. It's also a game, has decent graphics, it has a soundtrack behind it, and it has all these pretty well thought out mechanisms on how they want to design their game, like, in the long term, in the future. And when I saw all the different classes where it's like, you can be like mage warrior or whatever, all the different classes, I was like, oh, this is like world warcraft. I can use these as NFTs and I can level them up in game by doing stuff that I'm doing already. Whereas on the DEXes where you were just liquidity mining, you're getting tokens, but you weren't really leveling up a character in any way, shape, or form. Sounds like my main draw on DFK is like, I've done this in world of warcraft I've grinded up gold, grinded up my theory, crafting whatever mining abilities in those games.
00:05:10.426 - 00:06:09.394, Speaker A: I can do this in crypto but now there's also tangible money, monetary value attached to it. Whereas if you're trying to sell your gold in World of Warcraft you have to sell it to somebody through PayPal or some other sell your account. That and I don't think crypto has done it yet, but I do think it's a great opportunity there where if you have the correct game design and the correct incentive structure, you can create a fun game that also people have ownership and be able to profit off playing the game. So it's difficult to find that balance. And DFK, what happened with DFK is they grew way too fast, way too quickly. It's difficult to build out all the features in the game they wanted to do in a couple of months, but people's attention just blew up on it, went to like multibillion dollar market cap. If you actually look at the game now, they've implemented a ton of the stuff that they wanted to earlier, like a year ago, but it's down like what? 98, 99% if you go play the game.
00:06:09.394 - 00:06:16.990, Speaker A: It's like a lot of the stuff that I was looking at and expecting them to do, they actually finished and have done. But that was like my main draw towards DFK.
00:06:17.070 - 00:06:37.100, Speaker C: So you said something pretty interesting there that you basically think of maybe crypto trading or whatnot as kind of like a real life video game. And I know you have some good takes on people commenting on the speculative asset or aspect of crypto. Is this aspect a future or a bug? What are your thoughts on this and why?
00:06:37.550 - 00:07:36.122, Speaker A: I think it's definitely a future. So it's good and bad? I would say that it's good because the reason crypto has been able to stay around so long is that the people who are early to these networks have that. They have such a strong attachment because they were able to profit off these networks growing like the early Bitcoiners who bought it at whatever, under a dollar, under $10 back in 2012, 2013, they're diehard Bitcoiners forever. And it's kind of like almost a religion in that aspect. But they have really core, you need that core group of people who really know why Bitcoin is important, why the network has value, because those are the people who are putting bottoms in during bear markets when public sentiment is low and stuff is down 80%. Those are the people who still have that vision of what Bitcoin is, why is important and the ethereum community is the same way. But that aspect of being able to profit off these networks in a way from very early stages is something that only exists in crypto.
00:07:36.122 - 00:08:30.430, Speaker A: Whereas when you have stocks you're buying somebody's 1000 X immediately when it gets listed on public exchange like the Nasdaq or S P, whatever. And that happens a bit more now because the space is more popularized and there's more VC involvement. But there's still that aspect of if you're early to things in crypto, you're going to get much more benefit than you would in other asset classes. But then I'll say the bad part of that is you also attract a ton of bad actors because crypto is so early as an asset class, you can make a ton of money off people who are purely looking for that speculative, oh, I can make money off this really quickly. So you also attract bad actors in that way. So there's a duality to it. You have the people who are building because they understand why crypto is important and the fundamental value of these decentralized networks being able to exchange value without any third party build, like whatever applications you want on chain immediately.
00:08:30.430 - 00:08:40.082, Speaker A: And then you have the people who are just purely trying to make money. So it's a duality, but both will always need to exist, I think.
00:08:40.216 - 00:09:09.366, Speaker B: Hey, Everyone. Quick break to tell you about Jito. Jito is the number one liquid staking provider in Solana. Jito has been known for the Mev software and now they're the fastest growing liquid staking provider in the Solana ecosystem. Solana DeFi Summer is heating up and what assets do you want to Use in DeFi? Liquid staking tokens. Why? Because with Jito, you can take your Soul, stake it, and get instant access to liquidity through their liquid Staking Token jito Soul. You can then use Jeto Soul throughout the Solana DeFi ecosystem while earning yields through Mev rewards and Staking rewards with Jeto.
00:09:09.366 - 00:09:29.482, Speaker B: And Jito makes Staking super simple. You can take your Soul, stake it, get instant liquidity, and start earning rewards all within three clicks. And not only do they make it simple, they make it secure. Jito has seven audits. They have more than a million soul staked, and they're one of the most respected teams in all of DeFi. Jito is for whales who need deep liquidity. It's also for people like me and you who just want to get started with liquid Staking.
00:09:29.482 - 00:09:52.870, Speaker B: You have your soul, why not stake It, earn some yield, and start dabbling in Solana DeFi. So go get started today. Check check them out at Staking. I'll put a link in the show notes. Use the link so they know that I've sent you and go get started today. Everyone. We'll get back to the show in a minute, but I want to let you know that we got a permissionless conference coming up.
00:09:52.870 - 00:10:08.302, Speaker B: It's our Conference of Bankless that is the biggest and best conference in DeFi. It's going to be in Austin, Texas, this year? Yep. I know you love it. They Got Tacos barbecue Barton Springs We got it all. September 11 through the 13th. You've been in crypto for a while. Know that The Bear Market Conferences are The Best conferences because those are the ones where all the alpha is at.
00:10:08.302 - 00:10:36.166, Speaker B: The people that are still in crypto all really want to be there. It's going to be great for building a network, for learning a lot. And look, we've got a phenomenal lineup of speakers that include people like Hasu Sani, Christine Moy, and Kyle Simani talking about ZK Tech roll ups, account abstraction, mev app chains, and more. Look, I'm damn excited because you're a listener of Lightspeed. You're going to get a special discount. Type in discount code Lightspeed 30 and you'll get 30% off your ticket. That's right, just type in Lightspeed 30 when buying a permissionless ticket and get 30% off.
00:10:36.166 - 00:10:42.220, Speaker B: Click the link at the bottom of this episode and go get it now because prices are going up every two weeks. All right, back to the show.
00:10:44.030 - 00:10:51.920, Speaker C: So while we're on the topic of DeFi, I know you're always on the hunt. What are you most excited about in DeFi right now?
00:10:52.690 - 00:11:28.600, Speaker A: Definitely solana DeFi. I think Solana DeFi is definitely the biggest opportunity for people. You have these DeFi coins on ETH, like Uniswap, like Ave Maker, a ton of coins who have done really well, and they emerged out of the last bear market where there wasn't really any ETH DeFi existing at the time. And these are all like multi billion market cap coins. And Solana DeFi hasn't had that emergence yet. So the first cycle for Solana was basically just a token. Like Soul went parabolic, but all of the early apps on Solana were not.
00:11:28.600 - 00:12:17.094, Speaker A: Essentially nobody on Solana made money off any of the early DeFi apps like Oxy didn't do well, Maps didn't do well, but Serum was like, didn't do all that great underperformed Soul for most of the time. And I think that's just like, because it takes a while to build up the developer ecosystem and also like, the social community on a chain. And I think Solana's done that over the past couple of years. But now you have a ton of really strong DeFi teams that don't have tokens and are like launching their incentive programs to try and get users on their platforms. And I think they've seen pretty significant growth over the past couple of months. And it's also at a period where public sentiment on Solana is super low. So if you have that divergence of, you actually are seeing new growth, but the public sentiment is not matching yet.
00:12:17.094 - 00:12:41.440, Speaker A: That's opportunity for you as a trader to benefit off of. Whereas stuff like ZK Sync. Everybody's like, oh, I'm farming ZK sync. That's like a very common thing. I saw the air job I got with Arbitrum. I'm going to farm this. So there's a ton of people are like, spinning up a ton of accounts, farming ZK Sync, whereas stuff like margin phi, Drift, I want to say Drift had 2500 users past month.
00:12:41.440 - 00:13:01.560, Speaker A: That was up from like 1000 something the month before. And margin phi, I want to say is around 5000. So your competition is a lot much smaller if you're looking for alpha there. So it's like you will probably get an outsized portion of whatever Airdropper or whatever they do in the future if you are early to that.
00:13:02.570 - 00:13:12.330, Speaker B: You mentioned marginfi. I love Mcburnon and his Tweets, and I know you've talked about this. It says, if you think Solana is stuck as a low TVL chain, you're probably a moron.
00:13:14.350 - 00:13:25.866, Speaker A: Yeah, I like the margin by guys because they're one of the more aggro teams in the ecosystem. They're not afraid to say to talk back to people. So I like them. They're funny. But he's right, though. He's right. Yeah.
00:13:25.888 - 00:13:58.642, Speaker B: He goes into the Tweet thread, which we don't need to go into it too much, but he talks about TVL to value stakes, and on ETH at 60% and on Sol, it's 3%. And Seoul right now has TVL. I think it's about 320,000,000 or 300 million today. But if that ratio goes from 3% to 30%, which is half of ETH, then that TVL jumps to 3 billion. So I don't know how great that math is. But I think the other thing interesting about Salon is they talk about D Five 2.0 a lot, which is a lot of these projects don't have Tokens, which you talked about, and they're doing these points programs.
00:13:58.642 - 00:14:28.882, Speaker B: I don't know what I think about D Five 2.0, because that reminds me of, like, Olympus, Dow and Tokmac. That didn't really work out. But what is your overall salana thesis? Because I think you started trading Salana back in 2021, and then I don't know when you got back into it. I think maybe like December when STX was falling apart, part of me was like, I saw Ansem on Twitter being jumping on the salana train. I was like, always just looking for a new ecosystem to be, like, the influencer of it. But at the same time, you talk about how obvious of a trade it was, and you were just making a really smart move.
00:14:28.882 - 00:14:30.322, Speaker B: So I'd love to hear your thoughts on it.
00:14:30.376 - 00:15:13.146, Speaker A: Yeah, so my original Salana pieces back in early 2021, I missed most of DFI Summer. I came in D Five Summer late, but I saw what happened with D Five Summer, and I was there when gas fees started spiking on ETH. And it was actually Jeremy who pointed me towards Salon and Sarah originally. But yeah, I was looking at Salon, I was like, well, if there's another L, one that can do what Ethereum is doing, but cheaper, faster, as a pretty simple thesis. And BNB was like a similar thesis. So at that point, it wasn't nearly proven out yet at all. It was more of like, the idea behind, oh, this guy SBF is supporting.
00:15:13.146 - 00:15:47.862, Speaker A: This is a cheaper and faster chain. Looked into Anatoly and read through his podcast, his interviews, and his background and where he came from. And it seemed like a pretty good hedge against ETH. If you are also betting on the bull market continuing, while you're also expecting risk to go down the risk curve and people to bet on other altcoins. So if people can't do Salana or people can't do DFI on ETH, they're going to do DFI on these other chains. That was the original idea. And then through 2021, 2022, that's like two years of growth in the Salana ecosystem.
00:15:47.862 - 00:16:33.126, Speaker A: And I'd seen essentially everything evolve there, basically front and center. So I feel like I've been exposed to the ecosystem for a while. I saw what happened, the issues with congestion on the chain, like when they were getting the spam from NFT mints and there were essentially no fees, so people were just, I'm going to spam, spam, spam, spam. There were hella bots and it would break the chain. But I think what people miss is a lot of the upgrades that happened during mid 2022 on Salana that kind of made these congestion issues not as much of a problem before. And so I was aware of that and then I also was aware of the public sentiment. And then also you have the FTX blow up, which crashed price 80% from the highs.
00:16:33.126 - 00:17:03.774, Speaker A: I was in Lisbon in late 2022 talking with all the teams there, and nobody was talking about SPF at all. People were excited about Salana, people were excited about moving forward with the ecosystem. I think it was trading around 37, 38. And then we get on a plane to go back to the States and it was like, literally FTX stuff happened. So it was a combination of price being, I think, down further than it should be. I think it should be around like 40. If that FTX thing didn't happen, then you have the technical upgrades on the chain.
00:17:03.774 - 00:17:58.594, Speaker A: So it's trading at the same price as it was in early 21, but doesn't have any of the issues that it had during that same time period. And then you have probably 100 X more, just like social community, developer community, like active D, five teams in the ecosystem, all that happening at the same time. And I tweeted it like a couple of months before I was like, I think I'm about to be a sole maxi again soon. I just have a feel for when I think it's about to be time, because it had been trading pretty much sideways a few months still like six, seven months sideways in this 20 to 25 area range. But I was like, eventually this is going to get repriced higher. Just because it doesn't make sense that they have the second most active users, one of the most active developer communities, and just, in my opinion, a better UX than all the other L ones on the market. And it's trading at like, whatever, 5% of Ethereum's market cap.
00:17:58.594 - 00:18:14.342, Speaker A: I was like, that's way too low. And I also thought okay, we're at the beginning of a bull market, so this stuff is going to bottom eventually. It's a pretty good bet to make. I wasn't trying to just be the influencer of Soul, but I thought it was a pretty cogent thesis.
00:18:14.406 - 00:18:38.498, Speaker C: But yeah, you actually remember the NFT Bodding spam problems and congestion due to low fees. But then you said a lot of people are missing, that actually it's actually fixed. So that's actually something I want to talk more about. Solana did have a lot of improvements since those days, but the narrative hasn't necessarily upgraded. Why do you think people have such outdated notions about Solana still?
00:18:38.584 - 00:19:18.186, Speaker A: Well, I think it's two parts. So you have the community in crypto that doesn't read anything, which is like the average person, they're just not going to read white papers, not going to read the developer updates. If I tell you, go look at Patch 1.14 on Salana, they're going to be like, no, I'm not doing that. So you have those average people and those people will only listen to the people they think are smarter than them on Twitter or on podcasts or on whatever else in crypto. So that's like one group of people that just will not do the work to read. And then you have the other group of people in crypto who are very dedicated to what their bags are and where their money lies.
00:19:18.186 - 00:19:47.494, Speaker A: So there's really no reason for them to talk about, oh, I'm going to draw attention to what Solana upgrades are because that takes away from my work and what I'm doing and where my money is, essentially. So I think it's twofold. It's like the people who don't want to talk about Sauna even though they know what's going on there, and then the people who just have no idea. And it was actually three pieces, I think, then. And it's just like a marketing thing. Like, Ethereum does an amazing job with marketing. All of their technical achievements, technical upgrades, they do a really good job of that.
00:19:47.494 - 00:20:25.858, Speaker A: They have a good community that's super supportive of them and all their developers, like E 2.0, when they upgraded to proof of stake, that was like a huge achievement, which it was. But I think that Salana should have had a similar sole 2.0 type of movement and push and marketing push when they released, like the isolated fee markets quick and what is it? The stake weighted quality of service when they released those three things that should have been like this is Salana 2.0. We're not going to have the issues that we had before with all the congestion and then point to literally look at this month over month. We had four outages in the past four months. The past nine months, we have one.
00:20:25.858 - 00:20:48.026, Speaker A: So that should be a clear draw that should have been pushed, I think, super hard. It's threefold, but yeah, people in crypto, I'm not going to say people in crypto don't want to like the average person in crypto who doesn't know a ton about crypto. They just don't have the time to research everything on their own. So if they're not given that information, then it's hard for people to know about it.
00:20:48.208 - 00:21:11.220, Speaker B: Yeah, I think one thing we all like about Solana is like the isolated fee markets, optimizing hardware and software. Obviously not only Solana can do that, maybe they're the only ones that have done it today. But you have sui Aptos and other chains that are working on it. I've heard you talk about Salana's Moat, which is probably their community, and a lot of that has to do with when it actually came out in March 2020. I'm curious if you can expound on that.
00:21:12.070 - 00:22:18.354, Speaker A: Yeah, so I do agree there's going to be a lot of next gen blockchains that can compete with Salana from a technical perspective. That space is going to get a lot more competitive in the future, but you're never going to see any L one launch at the same valuation that Salana launched at, just because of how well Salana did in public markets. VCs are not going to let that happen. So you're never going to see an L one with whatever, 300 million dollar valve where it was, and people had time to essentially get into the community at those low price levels. Which is why I think even though Salon is still down 90%, you have a really strong community of people that are invested in the ecosystem, very strong developer community. And that community aspect is one of the most important pieces of building out an L one blockchain, in my opinion. So teams like Suite Aptos, I think Monad is another good one, say they're going to have to do a lot of legwork on that part as far as building out community, building out their developer community, just getting people excited about their ecosystem.
00:22:18.354 - 00:22:31.118, Speaker A: So Solana has like a two year head start in my opinion, on that front. And then, as you said, like the technical fees, they can also have that advantage currently, but that's something that's easier to catch up on, I think.
00:22:31.204 - 00:23:03.030, Speaker C: So while we're on the topic of different L ones and these different kind of chains, there's obviously a lot of other chains, right? There's kind of cosmos. Zapchain thesis. There's the L two S and modularity, which I know you've talked about optimism before, and Arbitrum there's now base with some interesting shenanigans going on there. And so it's super confusing for somebody just entering the space, probably right? There's just a lot of stuff. What is your mental framework for navigating all these different kinds of architectures and blockchains?
00:23:04.570 - 00:24:14.202, Speaker A: Yeah, so I try to have a thesis on both parts. So the modular piece, which is like separating the execution layer, separating the settlement layer, separating the data availability layer, and then the monolithic piece, which is like we're going to do everything on one blockchain. My current thought process is it makes the most sense to scale the base layer as far as you can before you add these other L two S on top. So for people who don't have that general knowledge, ethereum is focusing more on the modular architecture, meaning that Ethereum wants to be settlement layer and data availability layer for these other roll ups. So they want to push as much execution off chain for these other blockchains as possible, like Optimism, Arbitrum, ZkSync, and then essentially just have Ethereum be the most secure layer and settle all of the proofs of these transactions that happen on these other chains on Ethereum. So one of the reasons I'm really big on the Cosmos ecosystem is because they've been pushing the modular architecture for a really long time. Their whole thought process around app chains is essentially that modular thesis.
00:24:14.202 - 00:25:15.306, Speaker A: We want each specific blockchain to have its own thing, own focus that's kind of like kind of similar to what Ethereum is looking at with rollups. But in the Cosmos ecosystem, you also have teams like Celestia and Dimension which are focusing on being dimension wants to be a modular settlement layer. Celestia wants to purely be modular data availability layer and then have rollups built on top in the Cosmos ecosystem. So I try to think through how I want exposure to the modular thesis as well as the monolithic thesis. I kind of lean more towards the Cosmos ecosystem right now. I really like the Optimism team and what they're doing with the Op stack because they essentially want as many roll ups to use their SDKs as possible and be able to interchange whatever DA layer or whatever infrastructure you're building on top, but still be able to use the Opsack. And I think they want to operate with like a shared sequencer across all the roll ups.
00:25:15.306 - 00:25:33.880, Speaker A: But, yeah, I try to think of it and I try to have exposure to both, but I think it just makes sense to scale the base layer the furthest you can before you do anything else, because you're always going to be restricted by how scalable that layer is. Whether you're just pushing proofs to it or whatever else, you're still going to be restricted by how scalable that layer is.
00:25:34.570 - 00:25:47.510, Speaker C: Yeah, you cannot cheat physics, as I like saying there. So actually, I think you said something interesting there. You said you preferred maybe the Cosmos approach a bit more, which I think is probably non consensus.
00:25:47.670 - 00:25:48.042, Speaker A: Right?
00:25:48.096 - 00:26:06.030, Speaker C: So obviously there's L two S and maybe the new L two app chains, and then there is Cosmos, which maybe are competing quite a bit. And you said you kind of favor Cosmos. What is everybody missing there? How do you think about those two things? And why should people care about Cosmos?
00:26:06.850 - 00:27:02.002, Speaker A: Yeah, it's definitely not a popular thesis because it's not proven out yet. Cosmos has probably, I think, the. Least mind share and activity out of those top three. If you look at top three, like Cosmos Ecosystem, ethereum Ecosystem, solana, cosmos Pride has the least mind share from users and activity from that perspective. So my thinking on why I like cosmos so much is if you were to design a modular architecture from the ground up, I think that you would build something more similar to something like Celestia and have the roll. Up separate for all their individual roll ups separate or that's sovereign roll ups or something else instead of building out something like Ethereum, which I think really pivoted to the modular architecture after figuring out that Ethereum didn't scale with how it's currently designed as an L one. So it's like you're pivoting to something.
00:27:02.002 - 00:27:36.190, Speaker A: But we have a ton of tech debt, and that's why a lot of the Ethereum upgrades take so long to do, because they just have a ton of tech debt that they need to get over whenever they're implementing something new. And that's why they are very safe with all the upgrades that they make. That's why they take a while. And I think that the Ethereum developer community is super strong in that regard. Like, they don't want to break anything. That's their number one priorities, not break anything on Ethereum before we move forward. I think that's good as Ethereum the push for why Ethereum Ecosystem is going to be the strongest forever that that community has, because it's the most secure.
00:27:36.190 - 00:28:24.750, Speaker A: But in my head, I'm like, we're only at 500K, whatever, 700K daily active. I mean, less than that if you're talking about people who are actively using all the D Five protocols. So if you look out in the future, say ten years, and we have, what, tens of millions of users in crypto, which is hopefully the case, I don't think that that moat that Ethereum has, which is purely from a time perspective. As I see it, that security advantage is going to be as powerful as having the best technical infrastructure when you have because you can catch up on all these new users joining into crypto in the future. So if you have all these new users that outweigh the current cohort of really rich people on chain, it's like, what are they going to use first? They're going to use whatever team has the best UX, whatever experience is the best for people. That's kind of how I think through it. It's definitely not proven.
00:28:24.750 - 00:28:48.580, Speaker A: I think Zachie had a really good Tweet a few months ago. He was like, Cosmos has six months to really gain mind share in crypto, or you're going to have a ton of catching up to do. I think they'll do well. There's a ton of teams building out in the Cosmos Ecosystem over the next few months. That should get attention more that way. But yeah, that's my general thought process.
00:28:49.110 - 00:29:28.194, Speaker B: I agree with you on Cosmos. One thing I am curious about is, and a lot of people have been talking about this, but Cosmos and Ethereum in some ways are almost converging on their path and what they think the future is going to be. Yeah, right. It's been very clear at this point. But I'm wondering on the path dependency here, you're bullish Cosmos, but that doesn't necessarily mean the Cosmos hub and Atom itself versus ETH the asset. And none of this is financial advice, but my thoughts on this is that because Ethereum started as, like, this single logical state that the whole community got around, and now it pivoted to roll ups versus something like Cosmos. Which had this vague vision of what Atom was going to be.
00:29:28.194 - 00:29:49.570, Speaker B: It always knew there's going to be all these different applications with their own tokens. It never had that coherent, strong community that ETH has. And now you see the roll ups, like arbitram and optimism and others who are pledging allegiance to Ethereum for really no reason other than just to latch onto that community, whereas you don't really see that in Cosmos. I'm curious how you think about that and maybe what you think about the hub itself and Adam.
00:29:49.730 - 00:30:21.294, Speaker A: Yeah, dude, it's the hardest, I would say the biggest struggle for them. Honestly, that modular thought process is like, there's no one winner, so it's like you don't have people to join around and center around one chain, one person. Yeah, so it's tough. That's one thing the Ethereum community has done really well. But I think these newer Cosmos teams are aware of that and kind of see in the Cosmos ecosystem. Like, the dYdX CEO, I think, talked about it a bit. He's like, I don't want to be seen as a Cosmos chain.
00:30:21.294 - 00:30:57.680, Speaker A: I want to be seen as dYdX, like an individual chain in the Cosmos ecosystem and we're our own thing. I think that's kind of the right mindset that you're going to have to have if you're working on bootstrapping a community on your own. I think the Say guys have done a pretty good job of pushing towards that as well. They want to really rally their community in the early stages. Funny enough, like a pretty bad example, luna, which obviously blew up a ton of stuff in Cosmos. But what they did a really good job of was evangelizing their community. Like the Terra I don't know what they used to call them, the Terra people or whatever.
00:30:58.930 - 00:31:00.720, Speaker B: The lunatics, I think.
00:31:03.250 - 00:31:53.226, Speaker A: So the lunatics. They were like super gung ho on Luna and everything Doe Kwan was doing. He was a really great figurehead in bringing people around, even though the technical emperor behind it was not solid. But I think you need a leader like that around a certain chain that's going to be able to rally people and bring community. That's like a really important aspect that people don't really talk about as much. I think in the Cosmos community, they have a ton of really smart devs, but the marketing and the community aspect around individual chains is kind of weak. It's tough being bullish on Cosmos as a ideology, but then, okay, what do I buy in the Cosmos ecosystem to make money? So it's like, yeah, I'm not as bullish on Kerr like, right now compared to stuff like Solana.
00:31:53.226 - 00:32:04.450, Speaker A: I think Solana is probably a better bet because of how mispriced it is. But, yeah, there's a few chains over there that I think are good setups right now that people are kind of flying under the radar.
00:32:05.590 - 00:32:18.074, Speaker C: So in the previous question, you mentioned the word tech debt on Ethereum, which is something that generally software engineers talk about a lot. Which reminds me, you're actually previously a software engineer, right?
00:32:18.192 - 00:32:18.860, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:32:19.310 - 00:32:51.140, Speaker C: So with that said, I want to ask two questions regarding that, because most people in the space that are maybe traders don't have that technical background and don't really understand what they're talking about when they're commenting on technical architecture, but you actually have an edge there. Okay, the first question is how do you think your software engineering background helps in terms of how you think about blockchains, if it even does? And two, if you were building something today, which chain would you pick and why?
00:32:54.070 - 00:33:35.380, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it helps a bit. It helps me being able to understand all these papers that people put out and read through all the information. It's, I think, easier for me to digest than your typical person who doesn't understand anything about crypto at all or tech at all. I think it definitely helps me in that regard, like doing FA research. But honestly, I've not been an active developer in all three ecosystems and compared them like the devtooling. Myself, personally, I've done some stuff, some basic stuff, but nothing like, really in depth that would be able to formulate an opinion. Okay, this has the best onboarding for devs, so I can't really speak to that that much.
00:33:35.380 - 00:34:25.646, Speaker A: But just generally, I probably would say Solana just because I think that you have a combination of a ton of people who are looking at that ecosystem from a social perspective, the community perspective. And then obviously, I use Ethereum all the time. There's no application that is going to be able to scale, really on that. L one, even, like, arbitrary monopolism, they spike whenever you had like I think when the arbitrary AirDrop happened, fee spiked, like $10, whatever it was. So just like, there's much more throughput, like, much lower fees on Salana. So if you want to build any global application, in my head, I want to build something for 10 million plus people that are going to be using every day. And just the way that Salana is architected, it just makes the most sense.
00:34:25.828 - 00:34:53.260, Speaker B: Yeah, I think one of your secrets to being a good trader and also talking about this and reading about it is that you actually use the product. You've probably used 10,000 chains at this point. I don't want to know how many wallets you have or how hard your taxes would be. I'm curious, as you've explored all these different chains, what are either your favorite products that you're using or have used, or what do you think is missing? What does Solana need to actually build out that next step?
00:34:54.350 - 00:35:40.634, Speaker A: The biggest thing that I think Solana and other crypto applications need is a focus on people who aren't in crypto. And that's where I really want to focus a lot of my time over the next few months, is how do I bridge that gap between people who have absolutely no understanding of crypto at all? I don't know what crypto is and bring them into crypto. Like, what applications do those people want to use? I don't know if that's like, more social stuff, more NFT stuff. I kind of lean towards that as like, good way to onboard people. I know if I give some of my friends maybe some ETH or some bitcoin, like, oh, I have some ETH or some bitcoin, but if I give one of my friends an NFT, it's like, oh, I have an NFT. I'm a part of this community. We share this with all these different people, and it's kind of like a more communal thing.
00:35:40.634 - 00:36:26.342, Speaker A: So I really like what Drip House is doing. They're one of the newer apps on Solana. They're kind of comparable to art blocks on ETH, where they do drops with art, but instead of doing Mints, they do free drops for people every week, and they give out all these art to people who subscribe to different artists on their platform. And then you can tip the artists if you really like their work and then share and send other people. But I want to say they've sent out NFTs to something crazy like seven hundred k, eight hundred k wallets. And out of those new wallets on their platform, two hundred and fifty k of them have gone to use other salana apps in the ecosystem. So they've done a pretty good job of onboarding completely new people.
00:36:26.342 - 00:37:07.842, Speaker A: Like, you don't need any salon in your wallet to get the NFT completely free. Now you have, and you're like, oh, now what else can I do in the ecosystem? So I think they're doing a really good job of onboarding people, stuff like that. I just think more applications along those lines, and then I'm still big on gaming. I don't think anybody's really hit it hard yet. You need something. It doesn't really have to be all that complicated, but I think about a lot of the mobile games, stuff like Flappy Bird and games of those types where they weren't really that complex, but they did a really good job of getting people's attention. And I think crypto has a really great lane there to do that, especially with Solana focusing on Solana Mobile and App Store and everything else with Xnfts and backpacks, stuff like that.
00:37:07.842 - 00:37:09.766, Speaker A: So that's kind of where I'm at with it.
00:37:09.788 - 00:37:52.930, Speaker C: So you mentioned Drip house there. I'm just going to quickly show we did an episode with Drip, if people want to listen to that. But yeah, I totally agree, especially on the reaching out to people who aren't even in the market or at least in crypto and getting those guys in. I think that's the biggest unlock. And something interesting you said there is about attention, right? You are very good at the Bird app, or I guess it's called the X app now. And crypto does play a very big the bird app does play a very big role in crypto in general, which is kind of weird, I would say. I don't think many industries have this much reliance on a single communications channel.
00:37:52.930 - 00:37:56.994, Speaker C: How do you think about that? How should people think about using Twitter for crypto?
00:37:57.042 - 00:38:33.022, Speaker A: I honestly don't know, man. I've been active on Twitter since 2012 or super early, so people always ask me, why are you doxed on Twitter? Why are you one of the only people in crypto who's docs? And I tell them all the time, it's because my Twitter was my college Twitter. My Twitter that I had in college was the same Twitter that I used for crypto. I was just always tweeting out random stuff about whatever was going on during the week. When we would go out to parties and stuff, I would tweet about that. I'll tweet about whatever I'm doing with my boys. I just always tweet because I was always online anyway.
00:38:33.022 - 00:39:22.160, Speaker A: I went from Tumblr to Twitter, and I was just in my space online. So then when I found out about crypto in 2016, 2017, I was like, okay, who do I follow on Twitter to learn about crypto? And that's when I guess got into crypto. Twitter followed people like Kobe, trader, Main, all those people. I would say for people who are not in crypto, you definitely need to be on crypto Twitter, because there's no other place on the Internet where you can get such a large concentration of alpha information, free information. People like all these different types of discussions only live there on Twitter. And I've learned probably like 90% of what I learned about crypto has come in some way from Twitter. Whether it's like linking out to a blog post, linking out to somebody's account, like learning about trading stuff, learning how rotations work.
00:39:22.160 - 00:39:42.310, Speaker A: Kobe, I don't know if you guys know Kobe's pyramid. He's like a pyramid of his portfolio breakdown. And he was like, top 40. 50%, you do bitcoin eve 30%, you do mid cap walls. 20%, you do whatever. 10%, you do like giga digit stuff, shitcoin stuff. And I was like, that just thinking, thought process.
00:39:42.310 - 00:40:31.926, Speaker A: I didn't have that coming into crypto. Didn't know how to trade before crypto and how crypto market cycles work are different from a lot of other asset classes because they're so rapid paced, because the industry is so new. And the only reason you're going to learn how to trade any of those rotations and narrative shifts in crypto is by being on crypto, Twitter. So a lot of that I would say if you're new to crypto, learning about crypto, you got to be on Twitter. As far as from a protocol perspective, I do think that push and marketing push is big on Twitter. I honestly didn't realize it as much until this past year, but I was like, I don't really know what marketing people do. I don't really know what the core day to day of a marketing person is.
00:40:31.926 - 00:40:54.330, Speaker A: But I realize a lot of people focus all their attention on what people are talking about on Twitter. So if you don't have a big presence on Twitter, you could be building the greatest technical, whatever protocol to exist. But if it's not big and people don't know about it, nobody's going to use it. So it's a huge piece for spreading the word about your protocol.
00:40:54.750 - 00:41:12.046, Speaker B: Ansome, I remember you tweeting, Ansom would do these threads. It's probably like a year ago. He'd do a thread, but the threads would never be attached. He'd like do a tweet every hour or like 45 minutes. So you never knew what he was talking about. Trolling everybody. But that's one thing I really like about you Ansimize, you don't take yourself too seriously.
00:41:12.046 - 00:41:33.820, Speaker B: And that's something in crypto, probably people don't do on average, especially a lot of group think going on. I'm curious, what do you not like about crypto? It could be a hard industry to stay in year after year as the market implodes. And there's a few cringe things that happen throughout the ecosystem. One, what do you not like and then what keeps you in it?
00:41:35.070 - 00:42:15.560, Speaker A: How do I not like about crypto? Yeah, I think that the market as far as from a markets perspective, there's not really much I don't like. I think the opportunity outweighs all the volatility, like the blow ups and stuff, that's like a challenge for me. So I was mad during the Luna blow up because I was out with my family. I see Mother's Day, but I was like, dang, that was an easy killer short. Whoever caught that printed off that short. Yeah, a lot of people got crushed on the other side of it, but those opportunities for traders only exist, stuff like that in crypto. So the volatility aspect doesn't really bother me all that much.
00:42:15.560 - 00:42:57.618, Speaker A: I would say probably the thing that bothers me the most about crypto is just like some of the community, like some of the people online, the Anon kind of like the anon culture is kind of similar to stuff. I don't know. You guys don't like four chan, the old four chan boards and they're just like some people who just say a lot of crazy stuff online. I get a ton of DMs from anonym people or like saying whatever that I know would never say anything like that to me in real life. That's probably really the only issue I have with crypto, like crypto Twitter. Other than that, it's pretty cool. I would say out of all the people that I've met from online that I meet in real life are great people.
00:42:57.618 - 00:43:11.110, Speaker A: Everybody that comes outside and leaves their house are cool people. But it's like the people who are purely online came from whatever message board and are only sitting at their desk, like typing, typing, typing. Some of those people can be pretty weird.
00:43:13.310 - 00:43:25.840, Speaker C: So I know there's obviously people watching this who want a better Twitter game and you have one of the best. What advice would you give them? How should they use the bird app?
00:43:26.690 - 00:43:58.722, Speaker A: Honestly, the best advice I would say is to be genuine. I would say people are much more willing to listen to what you have to say when they know that you're not hiding anything from people. I've shared so many losses on Twitter, so many of my losing trades, also my winning trades. But it's all there. I don't delete stuff. I'm like, oh, I did this when I didn't really do it. So it's like, I think being genuine and just being true to yourself and what your actual personality is, is invaluable.
00:43:58.722 - 00:44:39.714, Speaker A: Especially in a place like crypto Twitter, where a lot of the people are faking stuff and trying to get people to believe things that aren't necessarily true. Because even if you don't think people can tell, people can tell. People can really tell when you're a genuine person and you're being honest about whatever you're sharing. So I try to be open as possible then also just really responding to as much people as I can. A lot of the friendships that I've made in real life friendships were from responding to some random anon when they had like five followers on Twitter. And they're like hitting me up in my replies and I just hit them back and they're like DM me. A couple of times I hit them back and I'm in a discord with them and they're like, yo, I'm going to be here in this country during this time.
00:44:39.714 - 00:45:02.154, Speaker A: And I'm like, I'm going to be here. And then we link and it's like, oh, you're my homie now. And we link up in places all over now. And that's happened a ton of times with people. And I think it's kind of easy to find online which people you really vibe with and sync with. I don't know how to explain it. It's like an online vibe check and then you meet them in person.
00:45:02.154 - 00:45:20.786, Speaker A: It's like an in real life vibe check. And it's like the people that you have those connections with is huge. So I would say, yeah, just be as responsive as you can to people because you never know who's going to be your friend that you meet and then down the line there's somebody that you may be working on something with. So I'll say be genuine and talk to people as much as possible.
00:45:20.968 - 00:45:33.480, Speaker B: Love that. Coming up on an hour so we'll ask a few more questions. One thing, I think it was in a Twitter space yesterday you said the next six months for crypto are really important, something that you're watching. Yeah, why do you say that?
00:45:34.090 - 00:46:24.518, Speaker A: Yeah, see you guys have seen I've converted into full bull mode. Yeah, but I think the reason for that is the next six months I think are the last time that crypto is going to be seen as a fringe asset class. So if you look at what BlackRock is pushing with their spot ETF grayscale like, with their spot ETF and a ton of these big traditional financial corporations building out stuff for crypto, like, oh, we're going to be the ones who own all the exchanges. We're going to be the ones who own all the rails. We're going to be the ones who own everything going into crypto. And once that happens, crypto is no longer a small thing on the side. It's like now it's going to get passive flows to bitcoin, passive flows to ethereum and then once that happens that opens the door for just a lot more money to flow into the space.
00:46:24.518 - 00:47:27.180, Speaker A: In general because crypto is right now I want to say we're like 2 trillion market cap or maybe smaller than that and BlackRock alone manages 10 trillion. Like if you compare how small crypto is to the bigger stock market, we're tiny. So this is the last bear cycle in my opinion where you kind of have that outsized opportunity as a retail trader, retail investor, to get into a really early asset class that has outperformed everything else in the past decade. And then once it's a multi trillion dollar asset class and it stays there, then the volatility is going to drop a ton. You're still going to have like altcoins in the mid cap range, do whatever, but the volatility just in general is going to drop a ton and I think it's going to be less opportunity than previous cycles after it's that big just because stuff gets dampened when it's that big of an asset class. And that's like one of the advantage that we have right now. Everything that we're doing on chain, like being early to stuff, I don't think you're ever going to have an opportunity where you're like one of 5000 new users on a platform in a bear market.
00:47:27.180 - 00:47:44.798, Speaker A: That's something that I think people are taking it too much for advantage right now. That's why I'm super heavy on the bullpost. Like charts can go up and down 20%, but if you're thinking out six months plus I think the most opportunities right now.
00:47:44.884 - 00:47:59.526, Speaker B: Do you think bitcoin needs to rally again? Does bitcoin then send off the rest of the market? I know the happening is happening. I think it's March 2024. Do you think that still needs to happen where bitcoin leads the way and then risk capital slowly kicks out to.
00:47:59.548 - 00:48:56.066, Speaker A: More and more risk? I think it will happen. I don't think it needs necessary to happen for you to generate alpha in other areas of crypto. Like if bitcoin and ethereum are chopping around, there's currently enough opportunities in the market where if they go sideways, you can still find plays to long and opportunities protocols to be early too. But yeah, once bitcoin re rates higher, like if it goes back to 50 or whatever k, that's like not only are the bitcoin holders up a ton in profits, but that news cycle is going to hit. So it's like, oh, bitcoin is back near all time high, ethereum is back near all time high. And when that happens, that's when you also have a ton of the retail, like, oh, it's time to buy crypto again, and then the money trickles down across the board, like across the risk curve, like you said, that's always going to happen in crypto. I do think that the rallies in bitcoin are probably going to get progressively weaker.
00:48:56.066 - 00:49:44.262, Speaker A: Like the one we had last cycle I think went to like sixty nine k, and previous high was 20K, but before that it was something like, whatever, one k or whatever to 20K. So I do think it's going to progressively just be smaller cycles, less volatile, not as parabolic on the majors, which is one of the reasons why I'm so confident in salon outperforming ETH. And I don't know why people push back on it so hard, but it's like if the ecosystem doesn't die, it's very unlikely that you have a $250,000,000,000 asset outperform, something that's $10 billion, just generally in crypto. That's how the altcoins work. Ethereum re rate higher, it's okay. Like, what else is going to re rate higher? That's a solid alt in crypto. See, I think it will happen.
00:49:44.262 - 00:49:47.750, Speaker A: It doesn't need to happen for stuff to do well in the interim.
00:49:49.770 - 00:49:56.266, Speaker C: You just mentioned, why do people push back on it so hard? You don't know why this is, and.
00:49:56.448 - 00:49:58.106, Speaker B: I've seen people push back on it.
00:49:58.128 - 00:50:13.680, Speaker C: Quite a bit and very aggressively as well. What do you have to say to these people? How should we handle these people? Because I've seen you do god's work here, but I'm just curious, what's your approach here?
00:50:14.130 - 00:50:51.398, Speaker A: Well, what I say is I'm supportive of everybody in crypto. That's building something to bring new users into crypto and move the space forward. I'm fully in support of all that. Support of ethereum, supportive cosmos, all the roll ups. I like all those teams. I think that the industry as a whole needs to be more honest about what the backdrop of the current state of the industry is you can still be bullish ETH and you don't have to talk bad about solana, you can still be bullish solana and you have to talk bad about optimism or talk bad about Arbitrum. But you can also be critical of these protocols.
00:50:51.398 - 00:51:41.726, Speaker A: You can say that rollups maybe are centralized more than they should be right now. You can say that ethereum can't scale past whatever TPS on main net right now and that high fees are not good for people who don't have $100 to spend on each transaction. I think you can be honest about each ecosystem's pitfalls while also championing them, because from my perspective, there's a ton of developers in the Salana ecosystem, but they can't be like, I'm bullish on, I'm bullish on bullish line because they're not objective. Obviously they're working on salana protocols. So that's one of the reasons I'm so bull Salana publicly on Twitter is because I feel like I can help them in that regard. But that's what I'll say. I think people just need to be more honest about how we talk about the state of crypto and not try and confuse new people.
00:51:41.726 - 00:52:04.834, Speaker A: Because a lot of the marketing efforts, I think, from some teams are intentionally confusing to new people in crypto just to pump whatever their coins are, which I think is really net negative for the industry as a whole. That's what I would say. I'm supportive of everybody, but I think we can be honest also. I love that.
00:52:04.872 - 00:52:08.962, Speaker B: I love that answer. Hey, Mert, do you want to do a fire round?
00:52:09.106 - 00:52:09.558, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:52:09.644 - 00:52:10.274, Speaker B: Sweet.
00:52:10.402 - 00:52:12.534, Speaker C: Do you have anything else or let me just go.
00:52:12.652 - 00:52:13.720, Speaker B: Let's do it.
00:52:14.330 - 00:52:29.114, Speaker C: All right, sir. So we are now going to do a rapid fire. I will ask you not so pointed questions, but I will ask you some aggressive questions and just try to answer them quick, short, but if you want to expand on it, obviously, go ahead.
00:52:29.232 - 00:52:31.294, Speaker A: Okay, cool.
00:52:31.492 - 00:52:35.630, Speaker C: All right, your favorite three D five protocols in crypto.
00:52:37.970 - 00:52:57.750, Speaker A: Margin, fi, drift. Can I say one that's not out yet? Sure, yeah. Up to that team, but yeah, well, they're like public. Well, I think pair is cool. Like pair protocol, because all I do is pairs trading. A lot of the pairs trading I do. So they're like one.
00:52:57.750 - 00:53:00.680, Speaker A: I think they're not out yet, but that's a cool one.
00:53:01.930 - 00:53:04.390, Speaker C: Your favorite three NFT collections.
00:53:05.130 - 00:53:20.170, Speaker A: Oh, man. Definitely the babies. Dang the Pandas campaign. Pandas. And I'm going to say the Lotus. Lotus NFTs.
00:53:20.690 - 00:53:24.510, Speaker C: Oh, nice. Three most overrated chains.
00:53:27.810 - 00:53:30.720, Speaker A: Polygon. Polygon is number one.
00:53:32.050 - 00:53:34.750, Speaker B: Polygon is like 100 chains. So it's confusing.
00:53:34.830 - 00:53:44.690, Speaker A: Yeah, bro, I could three times. It's like three different things. Polygon, harmony. I want to say polygon twice and then Harmony.
00:53:46.390 - 00:53:56.840, Speaker B: Throwing back to earlier in the conversation, d five Kingdoms launched on Harmony, which is an L one, and then they deploy it as a subnet on avalanche. So anso I'm. Curious what you think about avalanche right now.
00:53:57.210 - 00:54:17.760, Speaker A: I like avalanche. So one of the things I push back on Luigi and them all the time on AVAX is because they didn't have anything like IBC, which cosmos has with their chains, where all the chains can easily communicate with each other. It's like a standardized messaging protocol. But now AVAX has built out, I think it's called what is it called?
00:54:19.890 - 00:54:23.946, Speaker B: Probably cross chain communications, something cxmtp.
00:54:24.058 - 00:54:51.274, Speaker A: Yeah, close. Yeah. But AVAX warp messaging, so they're building out that, which makes it easier for all the subnets to talk to each other. And then also their hyper SDK, which is supposed to allow different VMs to be easily built out. On top of all these subnets. I think they're interesting because they focus more on the institutional side and their BD is pretty strong. So that's like one thing that differentiates them from other chain is like they're really heavy on the web.
00:54:51.274 - 00:54:52.490, Speaker A: Two partnerships.
00:54:52.830 - 00:54:56.730, Speaker C: You like writing. What's your number one writing tip for aspiring writers?
00:54:57.550 - 00:55:26.098, Speaker A: Write every day. That's my number one tip. Literally, if you can write something every single day, like whatever you're thinking about, just be consistent on doing that, you will get better consistently, consistently, consistently. I try and journal as frequently as possible, but I think it's really like you got to be really the biggest thing is consistency. Because you may think, oh, this isn't that good. But you write, you read, you write, you reiterate and just keep going, keep going, keep going. I think that's probably the biggest thing.
00:55:26.098 - 00:55:37.990, Speaker A: And also ask your friends. I have a ton of smart friends in crypto I can ask about really anything. So yeah, I would say bounce your ideas off your homies.
00:55:39.070 - 00:55:41.610, Speaker C: Your three favorite apps in crypto overall.
00:55:42.510 - 00:55:57.600, Speaker A: Drip house. I like play the heist right now. It's like NFT game, maybe. Quinta on optimism. Yeah.
00:55:58.850 - 00:56:01.230, Speaker C: Your most controversial take in crypto?
00:56:01.890 - 00:56:19.000, Speaker A: My most controversial take? I think my most controversial take is probably the salon of the .1 e. I'm pretty confident that's where it's going this next cycle as price prediction. I think that's probably my most controversial take.
00:56:19.530 - 00:56:25.126, Speaker B: What's something a year ago that you strongly had a belief in, that you've completely changed your mind on?
00:56:25.228 - 00:56:59.300, Speaker A: I think it might be Adam 200 bill one of them. I did a list of things that had low possibility chance of happening but I thought could happen at the beginning of 2022. And I said Adam's like 100 billion market cap. I think it's honestly more realistic that you have a conglomerate of chains that get to that size or that combined more than just Adam as a hub getting that big. That's probably what I'll say.
00:57:00.390 - 00:57:03.170, Speaker C: Your favorite three twitter follows.
00:57:04.070 - 00:57:10.550, Speaker A: Oh, man, that's hard. Oh, my god. That's a good question. My favorite three twitter follows.
00:57:10.890 - 00:57:12.200, Speaker C: That's a good five.
00:57:13.130 - 00:57:14.360, Speaker B: That's not fair.
00:57:14.890 - 00:57:17.270, Speaker A: Dang, can I check twitter real quick? Let me see.
00:57:17.340 - 00:57:22.394, Speaker B: Dude, I would have said, I was like, it would have been Kobe. I feel like maybe, but he doesn't tweet anymore. He's gone.
00:57:22.432 - 00:57:40.238, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, Kobe's like, all time. Probably like, one of the most my favorite accounts, for sure. I feel like I got to shout out some of the new guys, bro. I like v horny. V horny is cool. Lucas is cool. Who else is cool?
00:57:40.324 - 00:57:43.250, Speaker B: Mer asks us questions so that someone will say him eventually.
00:57:44.070 - 00:57:44.980, Speaker A: I like.
00:57:51.110 - 00:57:52.610, Speaker C: Mission accomplished.
00:57:53.350 - 00:57:58.790, Speaker A: Air Mass. Oh, air mass. Air mass is the homie. And BDB big Dick Bull.
00:57:59.930 - 00:58:04.310, Speaker B: When you said Lucas, are you talking about Buffalo or is that which Lucas?
00:58:04.970 - 00:58:12.614, Speaker A: No. The schizo poster. What's his name? Schizo, I think. Schizo underscore fr E q.
00:58:12.732 - 00:58:20.830, Speaker B: Got you. All right, I got a random one. I know you're really into basketball, so if we're playing a game to 20 is five on five, how many of the points are you scoring?
00:58:22.610 - 00:58:25.280, Speaker A: Five on five. Are we playing with crypto people?
00:58:26.850 - 00:58:28.480, Speaker B: It's all crypto people.
00:58:29.170 - 00:58:31.440, Speaker A: Probably like 1414 points.
00:58:34.550 - 00:58:36.066, Speaker C: Favorite NFL team?
00:58:36.248 - 00:58:38.610, Speaker A: Eagles. Easily Eagles.
00:58:38.950 - 00:58:40.322, Speaker C: Favorite NBA team?
00:58:40.456 - 00:58:41.410, Speaker A: Fixers.
00:58:41.750 - 00:58:44.610, Speaker C: Who should everybody block on crypto? Twitter.
00:58:46.470 - 00:58:58.700, Speaker A: Dang. Who should everybody block, bro? All the Dang who don't even have that many people blocked, bro. I don't know. I don't really block people. I mute people.
00:58:59.630 - 00:59:03.370, Speaker C: All right, maybe that one's a little targeted.
00:59:05.630 - 00:59:14.110, Speaker B: We'll end it on a wholesome note. What's, like, one piece of advice you'd give to, I don't know, just anyone listening to this. And that can be in crypto or outside of it. Just something that's really helped you.
00:59:14.260 - 00:59:47.734, Speaker A: I think I've been pretty consistent. My biggest piece of advice in crypto is keep your balance between crypto and whatever you got going on in life. So it's like during bull markets, you're going to make a ton of money if you are online all the time, 24 hours, not sleeping, not getting good rest, but currently tapped in. Like, oh, I'm on every new launch. I'm on every new chain. I'm on every new rotation, and catch everyone. You'll make a ton of money that way if you really just cut everything out in your life and do that.
00:59:47.734 - 01:00:23.106, Speaker A: But the issue with that is when market turns, it's a lot more difficult for you to unplug and then go back to whatever else you were doing. So it's beneficial in the time, but you also lose a ton of just in real life stuff. I think it's much better to have a good routine where you're balanced. You can go obviously heavier on crypto in bull markets, but don't just go like 100% and not talk to your homies, not talk to your friends, not hoop or whatever. And keep active. That's the biggest thing. Don't get sucked into being 100% in the bull market.
01:00:23.288 - 01:00:31.254, Speaker B: Great advice. Great advice, Anson. Thank you so much for joining. Everybody. You need to follow Anson on Twitter. I'll put links also to his blog. Go read them even the older ones.
01:00:31.254 - 01:00:35.042, Speaker B: They're really insightful. So anson. Yeah. Thanks for joining, man. This is awesome conversation.
01:00:35.186 - 01:00:37.094, Speaker A: Yeah, man. Thanks for having me on.
01:00:37.292 - 01:00:38.740, Speaker B: Sweet. All right, we'll see you next time.
