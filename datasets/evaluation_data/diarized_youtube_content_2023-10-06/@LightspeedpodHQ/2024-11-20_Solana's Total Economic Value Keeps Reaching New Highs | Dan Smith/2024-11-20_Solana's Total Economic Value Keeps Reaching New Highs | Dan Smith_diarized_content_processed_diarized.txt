00:00:00.480 - 00:00:28.862, Speaker A: There is a chance that we are just in like a point in time. Reference Ethereum 2021 November, right? There was days in 2021 where Ethereum did well over 100 million rev in a single day, right? Solana just did that in a week. When I think about NFTs of 21 versus meme coins today, it's like effectively the same thing. It's like this gambling game. So the question would be how do you retain this if you're Solana? That's a question that I will be.

I'm your host Jack Kubenk, joined today by my co host, Mertman Taz, and very excitingly, Dan Smith, data lead at Blockworks and also former host of Lightspeed. Dan, always a blast to have you on the pod. Thanks for. Thanks for coming back on.
00:01:56.780 - 00:02:02.036, Speaker A: It's always a pleasure to come back and chat about the latest and greatest going on in the Solana ecosystem.
00:02:02.228 - 00:02:06.820, Speaker C: Absolutely. Have you been. Have you been missing hosting Lightspeed? Is it a hole in your heart?
00:02:06.860 - 00:02:22.746, Speaker A: A little bit it is, man. Hosting pods is fun. It's a ton of work and I really wanted to go back and focus on the data side of things. Selfishly, but it's fun, man. It was always a pleasure. And you know, talking to Mert does keep you fully ingrained in the latest and greatest. So like I said, pleasure to Be back.
00:02:22.868 - 00:02:27.134, Speaker C: You know, I appreciate your presence in the telegram chat and on Twitter. I feel like.
00:02:27.222 - 00:02:30.210, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, join us in there. Come on. We need to rally the troops.
00:02:30.550 - 00:02:42.830, Speaker C: I know I need to put some work into that, man. I need to like, you know, put some like, Ethereum is good type post and just, you know, get people angry, get them worked up. But I haven't quite had the time. So that'll be good with the.
00:02:42.870 - 00:02:46.490, Speaker A: You're good with the Gen Z memes. You need to bring those in there. That gets the people going.
00:02:47.030 - 00:03:05.588, Speaker C: Exactly. That's. That's my biggest strength. I want to congratulate you as well. I feel like the kind of rev, what used to be TEV metric that you've been cooking for a while and put out publicly, I don't know, a month or two ago, I feel like, has really taken off and has become something that kind of drives conversations in crypto.
00:03:05.764 - 00:03:13.604, Speaker A: I appreciate that. But all credit to John Sharp, really. He did all the legwork on that. I just came up with the shitty acronym and he did the rest of the work.
00:03:13.772 - 00:03:49.156, Speaker C: Gotcha. Yeah, well, so you came on the show a few months ago, I think maybe over the summer, late summer, and you made a prediction and we hold people accountable on this show. So we're going to start there. And you predicted back then that economic changes were coming, something like inflation was going to be lowered and you would start to see, you know, simd's to kind of change the way the Solana Protocol works in the coming months. Update us on that a little bit. Do you still think that economic changes are coming? What might that look like? What are your thoughts today?
00:03:49.308 - 00:04:25.048, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, good question. I appreciate holding people accountable for what they say on the show. That's the rigor we need. So, yeah, basically my prediction was historically Solana has been exclusively engineering focused and now that it's kind of hit this top three category, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana. My prediction was people are going to start thinking about the economics a little bit closer. So largely that meant like where fees move through the system. So like where the top line rev falls down into which parties and which stakeholders as like one piece and the second piece of that is like the issuance.
00:04:25.048 - 00:05:00.412, Speaker A: So as part of the REV framework, it's important to note that the total sum of issuance is not a cost. The piece that is a cost is the validator commission on that. The piece of inflation that does not go to the token holders in, in aggregate. The token holders consist of stakers and non stakers and Issuance is a cost to non stakers. They do not receive that cost, stakers do. So the aggregate position of the both of them combined is there say value transfer from non stakers to stakers. That's an important starting point because the raw amount of issuance itself doesn't really matter.
00:05:00.412 - 00:05:37.968, Speaker A: It's not going to break anything. At 6% versus 4% people will be marginally better off. But the point there is that issuance is a taxed on the unstaked position and if it doesn't need to exist it's just like exactly that. Unnecessary and needless. Right now roughly 96% of inflation is paid to stakers. That means the 4% again this is the cost allocation of the total amount that 4% goes to validators. And that like many, I mean the sole price is up 10x over the last roughly 12 months.
00:05:37.968 - 00:06:14.772, Speaker A: So this is a bit of a, this is kind of the, you see the struggle you have to balance here. But that 4% supports the validator ecosystem like multiple times over in the whole. Of course that doesn't get fully distributed out evenly between every participating validator. That's a stake weighted distribution. So in that note there hasn't been any like there's no SIMDs, there's no discussion posts on the SIMD section of the GitHub like this is still that the inflation piece I think is still a little bit untouched to is very loud about like he's like make the simd, I don't care, it doesn't matter. And then to his point, like it really doesn't. I just think it creates this unnecessary tax on the unstaked position.
00:06:14.772 - 00:06:50.846, Speaker A: So that's like one side of it and then the other side again is the distribution of top line rev through the ecosystem. Right now roughly 70% of Rev makes its way back to token holders. My take on this is that's very very good and that will trend higher moving forward further into the future. That distribution looks like comes in two forms. One is token burning the base token. This benefits both the non staked position and the staked position. And the other one is like a yield payment to stakers, right? This is going to be MEV tips or priority fees that aren't burned or anything else that makes its way back to the staker.
00:06:50.846 - 00:07:32.510, Speaker A: In the case of Solana Today 50% of fees are burned and 50% of the fees go to the validators. 0% make their way back to the token holders. There is a discussion post, I believe it was posted by Ben Hawkins. That's Kind of like in the vein of okay, well we have this commission set up for the inflation rewards. Why don't we bring that same logic into block rewards which consist of transaction fees and then MEV tips already have their own separate commission value. And so really what this is going to do is SIMD 96 was already accepted and it is waiting to be implemented. When it is implemented, something like 98% of transaction fees will now go to the validators and only that like 2% roughly will be burned.
00:07:32.510 - 00:07:55.546, Speaker A: And this discussion post that I'm referring to will basically say just allow validators to take a commission of that 98% that's unburned and pass the rest back to stakers. So that one very specifically is like an action item on this list of economic changes that is being actively discussed. Seems like there's some decent momentum there just talking to the community. But no simd if no official SIMD has been created there yet.
00:07:55.698 - 00:08:32.004, Speaker C: A couple things there. First I guess you're noting that issuance is a cost to non stakers. Dan, is there any valid reason not to stake sol? Like we have these liquid staking tokens where you can get staking rewards and also have like a liquid token you could use for things like DeFi. I guess you need Solana to transact on the network but that's pretty trace amounts. But is there any reason besides just people who bought SOUL on Coinbase who never noticed that they could stake it there? Like is there a valid reason not to be staking Soul and should that be a concern as you talk about issuance as a cost?
00:08:32.172 - 00:09:11.792, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a great question. So you can definitely make an argument for either side I think. But broadly my point is that it's you shouldn't be penalized in a significant amount for not staking because that is the native token of the chain you mentioned. You do need it for gas payments. You also need it for sole liquidity like market makers and or AMMs both kind of rely on this liquidity and that liquidity is very important for things like margin engines, protocols like Kamino. So it is important. But yeah, you can definitely argue that Mert's got a great LST and H soul like just hold that 00% commissions.
00:09:11.792 - 00:09:26.320, Speaker A: I don't know why I'm doing his shilling here but you know there's plenty of great options out there that kind of give you this ability to still get liquidity on your staked assets and also earn that yield and then again not have this like not be the one brunting, the cost of inflation.
00:09:26.400 - 00:10:11.144, Speaker D: There is a SIMD being cooked up. It's not public yet for issuance or I guess inflation basically comes from a place. Because I asked Tolle actually on this podcast, why is the number the way it is? And his answers quite clearly, we just copied it from Cosmos and focused on other things. And so that's actually the reason. And basically with inflation, there's kind of three factors. There is the inflation rate, there's the APY for the stakers, and then there is kind of the staking rate of the network. And basically you keep two of those fixed and then you focus on the other ones or the other one.
00:10:11.144 - 00:10:38.108, Speaker D: And so the question is like, okay, what do you keep fixed? And so perhaps it makes sense to actually aim for a staking ratio for the network so that, you know, maybe 80% of the network is staked and then the APY and the inflation is dynamic. So something a bit more sophisticated. And since it's a bit more sophisticated, it requires something that Salon doesn't do, which is math or sophisticated analysis. So it'll take a while, but it's basically being worked up.
00:10:38.164 - 00:11:05.566, Speaker A: And Toy's explanation of that in the episode, which is a great episode recommend, everyone listens, was literally just honest truth. He's like, we had really hard problems to solve. The core validators that were helping us launch a chain came from the Cosmos. We did what the Cosmos did. And since that, the Cosmos has done a ton of work on this exact problem, which is what is the right amount of inflation for an ecosystem. So I think there's a lot of lessons learned. Like, I don't think you have to do some grand magic box thing here.
00:11:05.566 - 00:11:35.148, Speaker A: I just think you need, you know, roughly inflation should support the validator set that you desire. And yeah, I think in the long run you want to see a vast majority of that top line rev. So it's going to be transaction fees or any other protocol mechanism, really, it's just a sum of user. The fees that users pay to transact on the chain. You want to see that mostly flowing to the token holders and validators will run at some margin and some may be willing to run at a loss given it, you know, helps participate or benefits them in some business sense.
00:11:35.244 - 00:12:15.540, Speaker C: Mert, I'm curious to hear from you. Maybe kind of the business side of running a validator. What are the considerations you make? You know, obviously, Helios validator, I believe, is the biggest in Solana. I haven't looked recently, but it charges 0% commission, which is very attractive to stakers, you would think because they get higher apy. But then at the same time that means that, you know, Helios is passing up a potential big driver of revenue. So just walk me through, like as a founder, kind of the business considerations you're making when deciding what margin to charge and sort of how you've grown, gone about growing that validator to being 3% of Staker or whatever the number is.
00:12:17.200 - 00:12:44.872, Speaker D: Sure, there's a lot of considerations here. We never planned on running a valid leader. Basically, seven or eight months ago, transaction landing on Solana stopped working and totally kept talking about StakeWave QoS. And I told Toli, you can't just push this to Prod and yolo. It's nobody has stake, all the RPC buyers would get fucked. And nobody listened to me. And it did go live within a few months.
00:12:44.872 - 00:13:16.598, Speaker D: And I was like, shit, we need to spin up a validator now. And we did. And I share about the developer experience, which can definitely use some work and landing transactions. So just tweet about the validator, set the commissions to zero for MEV and issuance. And I actually had no idea of expectations of block rewards. I didn't know how much you would make from block Rewards. I didn't really care, just wanted to, you know, the cost is basically, you vote once per day.
00:13:16.598 - 00:13:57.286, Speaker D: The hardware costs are super negligible for us because we run 700 plus nodes anyways, like it doesn't matter. And so that was the only consideration. And then we just started getting steak because of that. I mean, mostly because of the APY probably, but also because of the brand. And I think there's something to be said about providing value to the ecosystem and having them support you because it's not like supporting you in terms of charity or donation. They're supporting you by just parking their money with you and also earning more money. So it's like a win win, win for win for the stakers, win for the validator, win for the developers.
00:13:57.286 - 00:15:08.918, Speaker D: So it's like a very nice effect and basically just start getting more stake from that. And then once you start getting into the top 50, let's say you start noticing that there's actually a lot of regulatory capture and arbitrage happening at those levels where people will buy discounted soul and then to buy it off them, you have to stake with them. Or if you're coinbase, they recently just put out an announcement to their custody clients like, hey, you can't stick with Helix anymore. You have to stick with us if you're using Coinbase custody. And so it starts getting a little dirty, let's say. So there's definitely considerations, but fundamentally it's about I think of it as running a regular equity business, which is how do I maximize value for the shareholders? And in this case, how do you maximize value for the stakeholders to people who actually hold stake on the validator? And sure, money is one part of that, but also do they get, for example, discounts on the Helios platform? Do they land better transactions? Do they have like a voice that can represent them? Once it comes to network wide changes.
00:15:09.094 - 00:15:21.306, Speaker B: The SEI network brought parallel execution to the EVM with their V2 update this past spring. Sub second finality and massive throughput are now available to EVM developers everywhere on SEI's high performance performance layer.

Thank you Ledger for sponsoring this episode.
00:16:11.394 - 00:16:45.550, Speaker C: We spoke a bit at the top of the show about Solana's Rev. I was off this weekend. I was in Buffalo watching the Bills demolish the Chiefs and so I took a couple days off from looking at crypto stuff. I opened up the Blockworks Research dashboard this morning and was kind of astonished at the is it 111 million now in weekly Rev? So that's fees and tips processed by the Solana blockchain. Yeah Dan, you threw it up here.
00:16:45.590 - 00:16:58.942, Speaker A: Those dashboards are available for free to everybody@solana.blockworks research.com definitely be sure to check them out. Love something, hate something, let me know. Shoot me a DM on twitter. Just tweet at me. Always happy to build and iterate.
00:16:58.942 - 00:17:17.094, Speaker A: Just Sonia Kim earlier today was like hey, you should build a chart with showing the percentage of tips as a tips total judo tips as a percentage of Dex volumes. We got that shipped same day, I think within the hour. So always happy to build and iterate. Please do let us know.
00:17:17.262 - 00:17:18.770, Speaker C: Block work ships, man.
00:17:19.230 - 00:17:57.592, Speaker A: Block work ships. But yeah, so the Weekly View did hit, I think it was 111 million. And even this morning I checked it and we're at a new high, yet another new high of 24 million on the Daily View. So RAV calculates, you know, it's like a proxy for user demand to interact with the chain. So it's all transaction fees, priority fees, base fees, things of that nature, plus any out of protocol tips paid for transaction inclusion, which in this case will be like JITO tips, right? So anything moving through that engine and yeah, you can see the up and to the right growth here. And it is pretty crazy. Crazy like on the far left of this chart you can barely even see this was, you know, on the Daily View.
00:17:57.592 - 00:18:46.214, Speaker A: It's only three months ago and you can hardly see the daily figures here. If we go to the weekly to your point, Jack, like yeah, we did get a bit of this God candle here moving up to 100, 100 million. And so it is pretty insane to see the growth. And this chart on the bottom right here you can kind of see what I'm talking about when I mentioned roughly 70% of the value makes its way back to the token holders. So about 45% is like payments to stakers and another 20, 25% is through sole burn today. And again simd will send simd96 will send the burn to roughly zero. But yeah, so why, you know, why, why is REV the right metric to look at as opposed to transaction fees and ignoring anything out of protocol being that it's exactly that out of protocol.
00:18:46.214 - 00:19:28.810, Speaker A: So I, I think a blockchain top line, it's really important to capture 100% of the user paid demand to interact with that chain. Why is that important? Well, it becomes comparable across every single chain. And again you're getting the user demand to transact on the chain. And so if you think about excluding out of protocol things, you're starting to miss that. Right? Like JITO tips make up roughly 50% of the fees. And so you can ask yourself, why is that? Well, a large part of that probably has to do with atomic arbitrage, sextex arbitrage or front running, which is the unfortunate reality of blockchains today. We haven't really as an industry solved this yet.
00:19:28.810 - 00:20:01.994, Speaker A: That is definitely bad mev. And there is like okay MEV or good mev, right? That's the other way to look at this of atomic arbitrage and sex decks. That's maybe more neutral rather than good is probably a better framing there. But if we look at something like something a little bit more income statement based. You have your top line RAV in this section here. The current quarter to date here as of November 19th is an all time high. About 358 million in rev and 225 million of that has made its way back to the token holders.
00:20:01.994 - 00:20:36.538, Speaker A: Again that's the aggregate position of stakers and non stakers. So because tips are roughly half of this total rev and roughly 80% of that makes its way back to the token holder, you're completely ignoring a very, very important piece of the token holder's net income. If you just say ah, that's out of protocol so we can't count it. And to which the rebuttal may be. Yeah, but you know, JITO does control this. They take fees out of it, out of that tip, total top line tip number and they can, you know, make the fees 100% if they wanted. Yes, they could do that.
00:20:36.538 - 00:21:16.760, Speaker A: And then this, you know, this would just update accordingly and there would be no, no longer would tips be something that token holders should care about. But that day is not today and if it does happen again, this will just automatically update. So I think you're just ignoring a reality of interacting with a chain today. So we have the same methodology for Solana with jito, Ethereum with MEV Boost from Flashbots and on Polygon proof of stake, there's a system built by Fastlane that is now called Atlas. And it's all the same concept. You're just paying an extra fee to be processed in a more efficient manner or include some bundle in in the case of Salon and Ethereum.
00:21:18.780 - 00:21:23.460, Speaker C: But also it's, you know, 90% of this R just, just comes from sandwich attacks.
00:21:23.540 - 00:21:39.100, Speaker D: Yes. So it seems like some people, whenever I post this chart seem to think that all the economic activity is a result of robbing retail through Samsung. But if you look at some of the research been done by was it.
00:21:39.140 - 00:21:44.840, Speaker A: Certus 1 chorus 1 chorus 1 and ghost logs I believe have both put out two pieces on this.
00:21:45.460 - 00:22:36.100, Speaker D: Yeah, you can see that sandwiching is a minute very small part of this quote unquote revenue and most of it is actually due to a skill issue in the transaction pipeline where you can land. Let's say there's a new token that gets launched and you want to be one of the first people to snipe it. JITO might give You a better chance of doing that because they have a different auction system. And you can actually see this very clearly when JITO went down about a week ago when, when they went down, the median priority fee on the chain went up a lot during the moment that they were down. And so priority fees are MEV technically but they're not sandwiching. And so there is something to be said about the maliciousness of this which is extremely overstated.
00:22:38.120 - 00:22:50.064, Speaker A: I can actually pull up a quick chart here that shows exactly what you just talked about there with that relationship of. There was a 45 minute window. Let's see on.
00:22:50.152 - 00:22:51.344, Speaker C: Yeah, this chart is really cool.
00:22:51.392 - 00:24:02.198, Speaker A: Yeah, November 13th there was like a 45 minute window where digital block engine was malfunctioning or hit some bug where in most of its regions it basically went offline TLDR and so on this chart you can see the blue bars are the number of tips per minute and then the orange line is the median fee. And so median fee jump from roughly 500ths of a cent in the beginning of this particular hour up to 3 cents. So you saw a like an multiple orders of magnitude increase in the median fee when the bundle JITO auction process basically went offline. Not entirely, it was like a, you know, 90 plus percent draw down here in the peak outage. But you did see this response of oh, we, you know, JITO is offline so we shift our methodology to using priority fees. So that's kind of when you see that this is really just like market segmentation and, and users that really need that immediate inclusion or they want to include a transaction bundle, they would prefer to use Jito. And that gives them the ability to kind of just like scale this their, their transaction payment higher.
00:24:02.198 - 00:24:33.150, Speaker A: Right. If you see $100 arbitrage opportunity on on chain, I'm probably willing to spend 90, 95, $99 to land that transaction before anybody else because I will still capture some profit. And that's kind of what JITO enables you to do. And that takes all of this aggressive noise, if you will, or all of this aggressive transaction demand away from the priority fee market. So that kind of like keeps this lower where you know, if I'm just sending USDC to somebody, I should be paying roughly the median fee of the chain. We can talk about that in a second as well.
00:24:33.850 - 00:25:26.118, Speaker C: Yeah, Dan, good stuff with that chart. We should put that in the show notes. But it's just a really interesting almost real life, real time experiment that shows the way that JITO MTV kind of artificially lowers the Median priority fee, I guess, before we move on, just to make this sandwiching discussion a little more productive as well. You know, a few months ago, sandwiching was something that was being talked about quite a bit. The Solana foundation removed a bunch of sandwichers from its delegation program, I think. So essentially you can't get steak from the Solana foundation if you're sandwiching users. There sort of was this process by which sandwichers were identified, I think by sending a transaction with high slippage and seeing if you got sandwiched.
00:25:26.118 - 00:25:59.488, Speaker C: Now, the criticism of that was it's kind of like playing whack a mole because you can identify sandwichers, but what's going to stop them from, you know, operating on a different validator and still doing the same thing? So I'm just curious, Mert or Dan, you know, from, from where you both sit, do you think that the sandwiching problem on Solana was meaningfully alleviated through the, the kind of Jito and Solana foundation blacklisting process and getting rid of the mempool, or is it still kind of a significant thing that needs to be addressed?
00:25:59.664 - 00:26:37.500, Speaker A: It still exists, right? Like, there are still sandwich attacks on Solana there. This isn't like a Solana specific problem. This is an industry problem. Nobody with a permissionless validator set has cracked how to 100% stop sandwiching today. Now, obviously, if you have a single, if you have an L2 with one box, of course you can stop this. You can just do first come, first serve, let's say Arbitrum, or you just don't accept transaction bundles and then you force the deterministic side of sandwiching attacks to go away and you have to basically probabilistically sandwich, which gets down a whole rabbit hole of. That's probably just trading.
00:26:37.500 - 00:27:02.390, Speaker A: So does it exist? Yeah, absolutely. Is it bad? Yeah, absolutely. Front running should be eliminated entirely. It's just a question of like, how do you actually do that in practice. To your point, the Solana foundation kind of took a couple steps to help mitigate it. JITO took a very direct step at working to mitigate it. So, like, there are benevolent actors making great decisions in the ecosystem, but it's just a very hard thing to completely kill.
00:27:05.740 - 00:27:38.000, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's one of those interesting things as well where the victim is a little bit invisible. Like it, it gives unsophisticated users worse prices. But that's maybe harder to see than if I came into your DEFI protocol and drained $100 million or something. Even if you could make the same amount. So it seems like one of these problems that needs people to look at it for it to be solved. But uh, it only gets kind of talked about in these short spurts when there's public actions taken to get rid of sandwiching.
00:27:38.080 - 00:28:29.140, Speaker A: Yeah. And then just one more thing to add to. You know, Mert brought up the course, one of the ghost ghost logs analysis of this is that it's also really hard to detect sandwiches these days because there is so much pressure around killing sandwiching that there's the response action, right, is to hide or obfuscate how you're sandwiching so we won't get, I don't know, I don't think there's a need to dive into the technicals of like how things people are doing right now to kind of like obfuscate this. But it makes the traditional sense of just like looking for sandwiches much more difficult. So this is like one caveat that I would add where when we look at these sandwiching reports, like you'll see a number that's like confirmed sandwiches, but there is probably some margin higher than that. It's really hard to know what that number is. And then one more thing I want to add is just like transaction sending on Solana today is still a little inefficient, I would say.
00:28:29.140 - 00:29:02.744, Speaker A: You know, Mert, you and I had a good convo on this on Twitter the other day around the cost of a USDC transfer. Like that is a non contentious transaction conceptually that should always pay the median fee. Or like there's. There is no other, there's no one, no one is racing me to send USDC from my account to Jack's account. But in practice, like that's not really what we're seeing. And I was, I was, I was tearing through some USDC transfers and noticed there was a binance deposit that cost the user $8 in a transaction fee. That was the most egregious example obviously.
00:29:02.744 - 00:29:34.530, Speaker A: But the median fee that is 2 cents. When looking more broadly at the chain, we see a much lower median fee and even the 10th percentile there is 3/10 of a cent. And so in my head you should always be paying 3/10 of a cent. Again because these are non contentious transactions. But Merc, can you just like walk us through the troubles of being an app developer, a wallet, whatever it may be, and like act accurately getting the priority, priority fees right to deterministically land user transactions?
00:29:35.830 - 00:30:43.130, Speaker D: Sure. One is that you cannot deterministically land a transaction, given you also want to control for let's say another parameter like confirmation time. So for example, you can't get a price for the problem. I want to land a jupyter swap within five seconds. There is nothing that can guarantee that in terms of fee alone because it's not up to fee alone, it's up to latency between the sender and the leader, some implementation details, who's using jito, what market you're accessing, what is the compute units being added to the block, is the block full? All these sorts of different things. That being said, if it's something simple like a USDC transfer from Dan to Jack that will land basically 100% of the time, the only variable there will be the confirmation time. So it might land in 400 milliseconds, it might land in up to 20 seconds.
00:30:43.130 - 00:31:41.002, Speaker D: It really depends on the network congestion. The binance example is basically an issue with let's say using the fee API. So there's we, we have, there's a few fee APIs now, which is almost also kind of a problem. Solana native RPCS released a fee API way back and it's a very brute and very raw, it doesn't really tell you anything. So Helios released one where basically what it does is it just watches the chain and then broadcast the markets for those accounts. So for example, let's say you want to do a swap on Jupiter, you would say I want to do a swap on Jupiter. You enter Jupyter's account and then let's say the other accounts that you're touching and then we'll look at that and then give you a fee that worked in the past 150 slots and then we'll give that to you in percentiles.
00:31:41.002 - 00:32:20.340, Speaker D: Like Here was the 25th percentile, lowest 50th, this is the very highest. And here are like the breakdown of fees that have landed. And then we also have something where you give the rec, you get the recommended fee and the recommended fee is just the median. So for example way fee markets work is it's local at first, but if the block is full then it becomes global such that you need to be included in the block to begin with. So it's like something because there's no dynamic base fee. And so with, with things like a basic transfer, you should never pay that much. And that's just a development devex error.
00:32:20.340 - 00:33:25.916, Speaker D: And probably we can do a better job of documenting the APIs a bit better. And I mean we've been in the past two, three weeks we've Been having hundreds of, maybe even thousands of chats saying like here's how to use the API, do this, don't do that, etc. But people obviously it's not intuitive to not have deterministic guarantees. And the only people who should be paying a higher amount should be the folks that are basically sniping these token launches where you just released with like no liquidity and then somebody's just going in there to gobble it all up. And at that point what people will do is something like they'll get a GRPC server from Helios, they will co locate it with near to a JITO block engine which is I believe in three places on the world now, maybe four soon. And so you watch for the opportunities right away. You get the data and then you instantly double send to Jito and then Helios because Helios has the most bandwidth and then Jito has their own auction.
00:33:25.916 - 00:34:24.961, Speaker D: And so that's generally how you would do it. But like the JITO fee auction starts getting a bit more expensive because it's 15% of lock space. But for a better guarantee for reliability versus the Helios one is just the native Solana one where we can guarantee you'll land but we can't guarantee how quickly and within if it was the 0th index of the block or the 500th index of the block. Whereas JITO can do a better job of saying actually you can land like the 30th block index here. So it's certainly not. So we're going to basically release a new fee API that is a bit more based on PID controllers where we're correcting an error based on what we see. We just kind of shipped this because again if you go back to the earlier episode here, we just shipped it because they just randomly released State Wake OS and we're like oh fuck, we need to release a validator and we should also have a fee API.
00:34:24.961 - 00:34:30.481, Speaker D: And so we just shipped everything, the first version, but there will be a version too that's much more sophisticated.
00:34:30.545 - 00:34:57.899, Speaker A: One of the other things you mentioned I want to jam on quickly is if the block is full. I was looking at Solana Compass this morning and I don't know if their data is accurate. And this is like block size is like a hard thing to track on Solana for some reason most of the explorers don't show total block size in Cus if you click on the block tab. I actually don't know if Helios beta version does this. I didn't Check, to be fair. But it's a challenge. It's not an easy thing to compute.
00:34:57.899 - 00:35:35.362, Speaker A: And even spending time with the Solana data on Dune or other data providers, yeah, you can get like the last 10 blocks and your query will blow up. But the staking facilities dashboard for the Fire Dancer, I guess the Franken Dancer client shows when that validator is the leader. It does track the CU consumption and every block it leads for is chock full. Right? Like 79, sorry, 47,999,999 cus basically. And so I was curious if you knew like is that a Franken Dancer specific thing or are basically all blocks right now just chock full?
00:35:35.466 - 00:36:25.630, Speaker D: There's no consistent answer. Like I don't think they're fully filled up all the time or they're like half empty all the time. There's a lot of problems with estimating compute units and setting them. So like if you don't set the compute units properly, you might request more compute units than you need and as a result actually pay a higher fee because the fees are actually based on the compute units. Right. And so, and like the way of estimating how much a compute unit costs is also super naive and doesn't really work that well. And also the compute unit is split up into threads, so the compute units allowed in one block is 48 million, but that's actually split, spread in or split into four threads of 12 million.
00:36:25.630 - 00:37:08.196, Speaker D: And so per account you can only have certain amount of cus. And so you kind of start doing all the. There's all these variables here and you add them up and it seems like generally they're full during high congested, high congestion periods, but full in the sense that it's full numbers wise. But the hardware could probably do much more work because it's so inefficient right now. And there's a lot of changes coming around this. So they're going to mess around with the block unit or the compute units in Solana Agave 2.1, which is the next release coming up after this one just released and we can actually talk about that one as well.
00:37:08.196 - 00:37:09.924, Speaker D: And then yeah, please do.
00:37:09.932 - 00:37:11.200, Speaker A: That was my next question.
00:37:11.820 - 00:37:56.264, Speaker D: Also they are going to start making the default compute units different rather than just like requesting the max, you kind of just have to set it, otherwise your program will break. And then there's like the idea of mapping the work your program is actually using to like the specific compute units as opposed to really guessing. So there's a lot of. And this is why I'm pretty bullish on the future of Solana because it works well enough right now. It does good. A good amount of activity, there's liquidity and composability happening, but that's happening with an insane amount of engineering inefficiencies that are just straight up shit. Or just shift to prod and like a fuck it, we'll just come back to this.
00:37:56.264 - 00:38:16.380, Speaker D: Let's solve this other problem. Oh, there's another friar now. So we have to fix this. And so the amount of fires in the backlog is quite a bit. And once you start, and these are all engineering problems, they're not like fundamental problems. And so once you start fixing them one by one, it just keeps getting better and better and better. And that's what I'm bullish about.
00:38:16.380 - 00:38:19.920, Speaker D: I mean, the work is cut out and we just have to execute.
00:38:22.020 - 00:39:25.110, Speaker C: I'm curious to ask just one caveat on this conversation about fee markets. Is it theoretically possible to segregate fee markets by use case? Because I'm just thinking about like at moments when fees spike or get out of control, it's often these, you know, trading bots having some kind of frenzy around meme coin excitement. And then you think about something like what Sphere is building with this like on chain wise money transfer thing for businesses. And if you're a validator, I would think it's better for you to be absorbing, you know, peer to peer payments or business to business payments as opposed to these bots that are spamming the chain over and over trying to land a transaction. So could you essentially artificially raise the median fee that these bots or meme coin traders have to pay and then lower the transaction fee to use something like Sling Money or, or Sphere or something like that?
00:39:28.300 - 00:40:13.070, Speaker D: Well, you can't really codify what a use case means in the context of machine language. What you can do is you can say we give you these structures called accounts and these accounts can be used independently of each other in terms of fee markets. And so what you can do is something like for example, code the micropayment guys where they have a state channel where they do all the transactions with Solana Durable nonsense. And then so it gives feedback to the user immediately and it just transfers. And it can even work during a salon outage. And then they just batch post it, or actually I'm in batch post it. They post it back to Solana main.
00:40:13.070 - 00:40:58.970, Speaker D: Net whenever they think is appropriate. I think it's within like 30 seconds or something. So that's absolutely. Doable and even light protocol is kind of like that where ZK compression, the sequencing is still done on the L1 but everything else it's not like the traditional model where you come from the EVM world where you have to just take everything off chain, roll it up, batch it and then post a proof back. Well as some route on Solana you can still do everything on the L1. Now it doesn't have to be synchronous, right? Like it doesn't have to be like right away you just send the transaction, just execute it. You can do that and that's important for markets and shit coins and things of that nature.
00:40:58.970 - 00:41:26.004, Speaker D: But for other use cases you don't need that. So it just comes down to the use case. That being said, it would probably be useful if there were tools that were let's say tailored around making those cases easier. So that I agree with. But for the time being I don't see how you could do it use case based because that's somewhat of a subjective measure on a purely theoretical or technical system.
00:41:26.172 - 00:41:27.268, Speaker C: Yeah, but, but say otherwise.
00:41:27.284 - 00:41:33.960, Speaker D: You could try something like Avalanche where you just have like this new L1 for this chain and that chain, et cetera.
00:41:34.300 - 00:42:19.618, Speaker C: Say if there was some kind of curve for like when you get above 5,000 transactions in a day, your priority fee starts address. I guess that's true. Yeah. There's no way to actually solve for this. Something I want to get in to with you guys a little bit is when I opened up the charts this morning, did a bit of a skim and saw that God candle on Rev that Dan talked about. It got me thinking a little more big picture just about what to make of all of this. What is this? You know the, the story of a lot of the onchain volume for a number of months now.
00:42:19.618 - 00:43:21.254, Speaker C: I think after kind of the airdrop Defi stuff on Solana ended has been meme coins. And that's often, you know, portrayed as just a stress test on the network. It's helping Salana become more antifragile in this kind of thing. But I don't know, I wonder if there's a bigger answer of just what's going on. What, what, what time period are we living in? And as like a mental kind of comparison to make, I did some research and just read some News articles from November 2021, which is when Defi is at what is still an all time high. I think the total value locked in DeFi is still 50 billion off of what it was in late 2021. And if you look at the types of projects that are getting talked about, you have Curve, you have new Dexes, you have stuff that's still around like Uniswap and aave, but you also have Yearn and Convex and Defi.
00:43:21.254 - 00:43:49.350, Speaker C: Apps that aren't quite as talked about. They may still be around, but they're just not used quite as much. And that got me thinking. Maybe we're, we're in a period of time where like the blue chips will really survive and then a lot of the other things people are excited about, we're not talking about anymore in three years. But I don't know, when you all zoom out and just think about this moment where TVL crosses 100 million after being 7 million two months ago. I mean, what is this?
00:43:50.690 - 00:44:06.416, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a. I mean there's a couple different directions to take this. There is a chance that we are just in like a point in time. Reference Ethereum 2021. November.
00:44:06.528 - 00:44:06.896, Speaker C: Right.
00:44:06.968 - 00:44:32.660, Speaker A: There was days in 2021 where Ethereum did well over 100 million rev in a single day. Right. Solana just did that in a week. And this was driven by NFT mints, really is kind of the main driver there. And when I think about NFTs of 21 versus meme coins today, it's like effectively the same thing. It's like this gambling game. So that is one way, I think that's reasonable to look at where we're at.
00:44:32.660 - 00:45:22.060, Speaker A: The question then becomes, okay, if that's the case, how does Solana maintain the momentum? Whereas as it looks right now, it doesn't seem incredibly likely that Ethereum's fee rev count will, will hit those 2021 highs this cycle. It's hard to project out further than that. But as things are moving right now, that doesn't, it doesn't seem like there's a driving catalyst for that to happen. I think another way to look at it is this is probably like the, I don't know, I guess you could say like the bull case for, for what meme coin activity is, which I don't really have a strong view on this. I don't really think like meme coins in their current form are like this financial nihilism, blah, blah, blah. Like that's, that's not really my cup of tea. But one of the interesting angles I think is just the idea of permissionless capital markets or permissionless capital formation.
00:45:22.060 - 00:46:32.600, Speaker A: Yes, people are just launching Fartcoin or whatever on pump fund right now, but what if five years from now, four years from now, next cycle, whatever it is, people are launching their business and that's how they get funding for it. This kind of just takes you back to the ICO era, but that doesn't seem totally unreasonable. So one of the interesting pieces here is if this meme coin activity will be sticky in terms of the usage and the liquidity. I don't know if Pump Fund will continue the glorious run it's had with the several hundred million dollars of revenue that company has made. But will those users stick around? I think history kind of tells you it's pretty hard to move people and their funds. If you look at Ethereum, stablecoin TVL right now is massive, right? Are people just parking stablecoins there? Why are those assets still there? Is it like this trust based system? They have a ton of confidence in holding their funds on this chain and the security guarantees there. It's hard to say whatever user prefers, but empirically, if we look at how funds move, it does seem fairly sticky.
00:46:32.600 - 00:46:37.740, Speaker A: So the question would be, how do you retain this? If you're Solana, that's a question that I would be asking.
00:46:38.800 - 00:47:05.408, Speaker C: Yeah, it's also interesting just to. I mean it feels like there's certain things, whenever this moment in defi reaches another all time high. There's certain things that'll never recover though. Like a lot of the governance tokens that were launched back then, I haven't looked at like what uni is at recently, but I know for a long time they just never really got close to all time highs ever again. And I think you'll see some of that with some of the things people are excited about right now.
00:47:05.544 - 00:47:30.010, Speaker A: Yeah, that's probably true. And even if you think Back to the D5.1.0 of last cycle, right, there was people just like throwing ideas at the wall and seeing if they worked. Some of them did work, some of them did not work and some of those projects have totally fell off the earth. Or you have interesting things like convex and yearn 2D 5.1.0 classics from the last cycle. They're like teasing this merger type deal.
00:47:30.010 - 00:48:01.220, Speaker A: I don't really know what the details are, but Sam K from FRAX was tweeting about this and they just put out some cryptic post this morning of like, I don't know, it seems like they're doing some merger. So we'll see this defi m and a thing happen as these businesses try to evolve and take the next leg up. And that's not like crypto specific, right? That's how businesses and the physical world work and operate. Some ideas work, some don't. Those that don't either die or continue trying to push the ball forward.
00:48:02.240 - 00:48:50.750, Speaker C: I know we have a bit of maybe a cognitive bias for thinking that history always repeats itself and rhymes, but maybe to try to make sense of this current bubble. A lot of the defi stuff that's going on, you know, some of the newer use cases there, like broadly, what do you think has lasted from 2021? I guess Uniswap was big then, it's big now. But of all the innovation that came out of Defi summer and the 2021 early use cases, yield, farming, all that kind of stuff, can you see things today that came out of that? That or real steps forward that are new in defi?
00:48:53.650 - 00:49:21.564, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I definitely think that you can say that. Right? Like AMMS themselves were kind of like popularized from last cycle. We still see AMMs playing a very important role. Lending protocols. AAVE is absolutely crushing it right now. The popularization of LSTs and like what those are and how those actually work in practice and how you generate liquidity around this lst, how you make it a useful asset and how you kind of tie all three of those things together when it pertains to the lsc, that's useful. So I do think we built some core primitives last cycle.
00:49:21.564 - 00:49:55.890, Speaker A: I think they need to continue innovating on them. And so if you try to predict what that would be. What was the DEFI of last cycle? This cycle? Obviously I want it to be deepen. I think there's a lot of interesting ideas there, but it feels like very early in the venture process, if you will, of will this stuff actually work? I know the DSI stuff seems pretty interesting. I don't really know. I haven't looked into this pump science thing or whatever. I know they've got this meme effect going on there, but the Hairdao thing seems cool.
00:49:55.890 - 00:50:21.256, Speaker A: I don't know enough to know if that's legit or not, but there seems to be some innovation in that space. So I think we'll see DEFI continuing to iterate and improve more ass. Like I. I don't know, this kind of get ties in the RWAS thing. Like we're already seeing asset issuers just spread to every chain. This makes a ton of sense to me. If you're an asset issuer, you make money by getting your asset in the hands of other people.
00:50:21.256 - 00:50:54.970, Speaker A: You're not going to like pick a favorite chain or whatever. Like you're. You're going to go to where the demand is and get make the lower the amount of friction required to hold your asset. We're seeing this securitize is pushing the BlackRock buildal fund literally everywhere. We're seeing the same thing from other large funds. I expect that trend to continue and then that kind of levels up the assets you have on chain. So you go from just meme coins to now these governance tokens, project tokens, some will start to accrue real tangible value given them hopefully some regulatory changes coming.
00:50:54.970 - 00:51:09.090, Speaker A: So you get these pseudo equity like products that exist fully on chain, you have this true crypto native value and then you get this third bucket which is the off chain assets coming on chain which I think all three of those things are exciting for different reasons.
00:51:10.310 - 00:52:00.930, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm glad you bring up sort of some of these apps and things Dan, because obviously when prices are approaching all time highs, the metrics are insane. You just look at the current thing and you look at meme coins and what's going on on the chain. But a few months ago, kind of when, when I was starting to take over this podcast, people really wanted more discussion around apps like the infrastructure era is over. It's time to build usable apps that benefit people's lives that are outside of kind of the speculative casino side of things. And I think like that stuff is still continuing to be developed. It just doesn't happen as quickly or as excitingly maybe as some of the defi huge lucrative opportunities. I continue to be excited about payments.
00:52:00.930 - 00:52:16.386, Speaker C: I think Sling Money, which just launched in the US is pretty cool. It's just a global Venmo. It's like a 10% better, better Venmo I guess for us users. So that stuff exists. It just. It's a matter of whether we're looking at it or not.
00:52:16.538 - 00:52:35.138, Speaker A: Okay. One point to add there is that stuff takes longer in the development cycle because you have to build a real product. You don't just get to launch a Twitter account and a token and then tweet and then that's the product. Right. You have to actually build the thing that's useful to people. And that does take time if you're curious. I think Solana does an outstanding job of this.
00:52:35.138 - 00:53:05.908, Speaker A: First of all relative to all chains. But if you're curious how that ecosystem is progressing, look at hackathons. That is the next generation of things that will come on mainnet and be useful to people. I think the Coliseum just closed their most recent accelerator cohort. There's some pretty cool stuff There, there's like a fantasy sports type game, like Dark Pools and there was like another Deepen project I thought was interesting as well. So you're seeing like that's where those are like those three big verticals I think is like Deepin Defi. And consumer.
00:53:05.908 - 00:53:19.814, Speaker A: Consumer's still like super, super nascent. There's going to be like a lot of trial and error there. Like, nobody's really cracked that. Farcaster is probably the closest. But like, you know, I. I use Farcaster quite a bit and then, you know, fast forward to today. Like, I'm just back on Twitter.
00:53:19.814 - 00:53:24.850, Speaker A: Like, that shit's addicting. I don't know. Like, I can't get off it. Like it's. It's really hard to rip that platform out.
00:53:26.990 - 00:53:51.370, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. A good way to sum it up is it's hard to build real products that people want to use. That is all the time that we have for today, but it's been a blast having three Lightspeed hosts in one call. Dan, thank you so much as always for coming on. Everyone, please join the Telegram group.
