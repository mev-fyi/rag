00:00:00.240 - 00:00:31.522, Speaker A: The fact that enterprises and institutions are waking up to like, hey, wait a minute. Like, we don't have to set up our entire own infrastructure and run it and do all these setups and integrations, but we can actually just plug into this globally atomic state machine that everybody else is already using and has done the hard work of like maintaining, securing, building integrations on top of. Then you start getting like this. Maybe you start getting somewhat closer to Crypto's vision of, you know, p two p payments and much better global commerce. Much more efficient. Hopefully we see more of that going forward.
00:00:31.658 - 00:01:01.094, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by helium Mobile. They've created a crypto native phone plan for unlimited talk, text and data for just $20 a month. We'll chat more about them later in the show. Before we get moving on today's episode, just a quick disclaimer. The views expressed on this podcast by either myself, my co host, or any guests are their personal views and do not represent the views of any associated organization. Nothing in the episode should be construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal, or any other advice. Okay, let's jump into the episode.
00:01:01.094 - 00:01:42.278, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Lightspeed. We missed you last week, so this is our first roundup in two weeks, so we got plenty of talk about. There's no doubt about it. But mert, I know you were just at consensus last week, and people used to love to try to call cycle tops based on the craziness of the conference or what people are talking about, or is it all price talk or all shop talk? I don't think that really exists anymore, or it is really like a working function now just because conferences have gotten crazy full stop. There's a lot of them put on by a lot of different teams and people love to go all out. So I don't really think it works anymore. But nonetheless, I want to get a vibe check from you.
00:01:42.278 - 00:01:46.074, Speaker B: What was it like from the boots on the ground perspective being in Austin last week?
00:01:46.654 - 00:02:25.598, Speaker A: Sure. Yeah. So. Well, my perspective is going to be biased because I went to Solana events and VC happy hours and stuff like that. I didn't actually go to the conference itself except for like a side event, but overall, I think, like, one of the themes was a lot of institutional folks and like these sovereign wealth funds and like, you know, s and P even, and some of just the trad tradfi companies. Looking more into crypto was kind of what I noticed, even a lot of like, political stuff as well. Like, I think there was a good dinner with senators and political fundraisers and whatnot.
00:02:25.598 - 00:03:33.454, Speaker A: So, you know, compared to some of the other ones I've been to, where people are kind of just flashing lambos and, you know, their watch collections, this one seemed to be refreshingly, was a weird thing to say, but refreshingly focused on, you know, policy, regulation, products, adoption for some of the older institutions, and just, you know, chatting, seeing what the pain points are and overall, things like that. And one of the other things I noticed was, so I went to Austin last year for permissionless, permissionless two from block blockworks. And that was kind of like just me and Anatoly and like Lucas and like maybe seven, eight, nine other Solana people. And we kind of felt we were in, like, foreign land. And this time there was like a, there's a Solana house, and it was so overcrowded that they made another Solana house. And there was a lot of Solana events. In fact, I couldn't go to all of them.
00:03:33.454 - 00:04:14.806, Speaker A: And so I really liked seeing, and then, like, even at the Solana events, there was a lot of people from other ecosystems, like the move guys and some Ethereum folks, cosmos folks. And so it seemed to be much more collaborative and a wide range of, let's say, chains and ecosystems. And so I would say, like, overall, I was super happy with the progress we made. If you can judge crypto by conferences, I would say this conference was better than most of the other ones I've been to. And so, yeah, that's. I give it a thumbs up.
00:04:14.940 - 00:04:28.474, Speaker B: Nice. That's good to hear. It's funny. Permissionless last year was about September of last year. I just pulled up Coingecko and Price was at $17 for soul. So nothing drives sentiment like Price, am I right? But that's good to hear, man. Did you.
00:04:28.474 - 00:04:50.040, Speaker B: I'm curious, did you see there's always, like, the builders that go to these conferences to try to push their upcoming and emerging ideas? Was there any new verticals that you see coming? Like builders coming to Solana to build, like, x on Solana, anything like that, that you were like, oh, this is a really cool iteration or something. I'm excited to see the creator focused.
00:04:50.112 - 00:05:42.822, Speaker A: Things, which maybe ties a little bit into the celebrity coin trend a little bit. I saw quite a few of that. Like, people are trying to look at new ways of observing dynamics between creators and their fans and whatnot. I also even saw some Solana focused infrastructure stuff. Some of this stuff might be confidential, so I'm probably not going to go into too much detail, but basically more infrastructure on Solana in the context of maybe off chain compute, ZK exporting Solana's stack to other ecosystems, maybe interoperability with other ecosystems. That generally used to not be such a thing, but now it is. I also saw a lot of.
00:05:42.822 - 00:06:15.204, Speaker A: And this is obviously biased somewhat due to the events that I was at, but a lot of look into the internals of Solana, like, better block packing, relooking at mev transaction landing, things that would be interesting for some of the quant firms, the market makers, et cetera. I saw a relatively big uptick in that. And also gaming. Web three. Gaming. I hate saying the word web3. Damn, I hate it, too.
00:06:15.244 - 00:06:16.624, Speaker B: I really hate it.
00:06:18.724 - 00:06:38.954, Speaker A: So, yeah, it seemed like some sort of validator stuff, gaming creator stuff. I saw some proof of work based stuff, like, similar to Oregon. So that was interesting. And teleport was there. Teleport is like the. We actually had them on the show, right? Let's say decentralized Uber. They were actually.
00:06:38.954 - 00:06:42.442, Speaker A: They had rides with teleport, uh, where you could call it. So that was interesting.
00:06:42.538 - 00:07:02.374, Speaker B: How did it work? Because every time I'm in a city, I'm like, I go to New York every now and then. It's still not in New York, but it makes sense. I'd go to the conference cities, but I saw a couple screenshots of, like, $6 rides when Ubers were $20. Of course, you know, this is exactly like what Uber did and Lyft did, and, like, battled each other to get the fees low. Covid hit changed everything. But I'm curious, how was the. The teleport ux?
00:07:02.934 - 00:07:06.702, Speaker A: So I actually didn't use it because I have an Android, and it's for iOS only.
00:07:06.798 - 00:07:07.942, Speaker B: Oh, brutal.
00:07:08.118 - 00:07:32.844, Speaker A: But I did go on the ride where other people called it, and, you know, it seemed like a normal uber experience. That's obviously a gargantuan task in startup to build. But I thought it was cool that they actually had customers and it was being used, which is pretty refreshing from the usual state of affairs in crypto, which is you say it exists, raised money for it, and then ship it, but. So this exists. So I was. I was pretty happy to see that.
00:07:35.384 - 00:08:04.814, Speaker B: Nice, nice. All right, that's cool. That's cool. I don't want to show our own podcast here, but I did an episode with SV from Baxis, and that was the most interesting conversation I have had in crypto in so long. I was getting, like, really burnt out and tired, honestly, of this, just, like, infrastructure circle jerk. And he came in and was like, oh, yeah, I like, backed into crypto. Wanted to build a really cool marketplace centered around trading wines and spirits, mostly whiskey.
00:08:04.814 - 00:08:35.956, Speaker B: And like, oh, yeah. I realized, like, building on a blockchain would actually give me some really cool benefits that would be very hard to get outside of that. And I was like, holy shit. Because in this industry, we are covered with just a bunch of nerds, including myself. It was like, I love what's going on here. Let me try to, like, build a product on it, which then you're like backing into the useful piece, right? You're trying, you started with the idea of where you're going to build it, and then you're trying to figure out what to build versus SVi had the total opposite route where he was like, yeah, I'm building a marketplace. I'm starting to get some traction and I just want to make it better.
00:08:35.956 - 00:08:59.612, Speaker B: And like, oh, okay. Now I'm picking up my technical backend based on how to make it the best. I was like, holy shit. Like, we do not see enough of that, which is really, really interesting. But that, that whole conversation, like, I don't know, like, even going back and telling the analyst team, I was like, guys, I just had the best podcast ever. And everyone was like, all right, like, what was it? I'm like, okay, don't laugh at me. It's putting whiskey on the blockchain.
00:08:59.612 - 00:09:34.480, Speaker B: So it was funny. It is kind of an interesting thing. And at first pass, it does sound silly, but I don't know. The idea of putting marketplaces like that on chain actually does get you this massive liquidity and composability benefit that I think is really challenging to get outside of blockchain. And I think the whiskey market is actually one of the more interesting places for this because, you know, it has always been in the back shadows and a lot of it happens in like, rural areas. And it is actually bringing, it's like digitizing a very old and longstanding industry. So I don't know.
00:09:34.480 - 00:10:12.350, Speaker B: That has got me really fired up to go hunt for businesses that are building on chain because it improves the product of that they already have or already caring about building. And the last piece I thought that was super interesting about this was I would encourage everyone to just like, go, like, log in, make an account. It's like a typical Gmail sign in or whatever, because you don't have to buy anything, obviously. But going on there, you have no idea that it is built there, uses a blockchain backend and that has been one of those ideas that people kept spewing for a while was, oh, yeah. Like, eventually you're going to log into these apps and have no idea that you're on chain, but now it's actually happening. So I don't know. It was like a really cool, like, wake up moment for me.
00:10:12.350 - 00:10:19.074, Speaker B: So I don't know if you saw anything like that, but that is very much what I'm personally on the hunt for now and really, really finding interesting.
00:10:19.504 - 00:11:00.866, Speaker A: Yeah, I think, I mean, certainly. So I'm an investor, actually, in the company. I think it's pretty cool if you met Todd, he's pretty cool. At last breakpoint, I was just at, like, a Solana event, and Todd had this backpack, and his backpack, there was, like, a bunch of whiskey samplers and stuff. So he, like, really? And, like, he'll, like, do, like, a tasting with you and, like, gives you, like, these, you know, tips and tricks on how to. How to enjoy it and stuff. And so, like, the concept of you having maybe this idea that you're really into in this business and then using the chain, using the properties of the chain to help improve that business is ultimately what it's kind of all about.
00:11:00.866 - 00:11:26.320, Speaker A: Right. It's the same idea with Hivemapper, the decentralized mapping network. They tried to do their business without crypto at first, and they ran into a few issues which blockchain's really helped them with, and it helped their business. And I actually believe that the baxis, the whiskey thing, actually also uses, or at least will use helium as well.
00:11:26.472 - 00:11:52.024, Speaker B: Yeah, they use it to operate like, a lot of their sensors. So they'll run the hotspots and then plug in their humidity sensors or temperature sensors, and they can give live updates on the status of the vaults where the bottles are stored. And so, like, I don't know how they're, like, specifically passing that metadata back into the nfTs. I don't know if they're going to create their own standard or. I think they're using metaplex. I don't know. I need to dive into more the technical details, but I'm like, it's all on chain, which is the beauty.
00:11:52.024 - 00:11:55.164, Speaker B: And it's there waiting to be accessed and analyzed.
00:11:55.504 - 00:12:35.116, Speaker A: Yeah. And so, like, you know, that kind of maybe speaks to the composability aspect a little bit as well, so. And, you know, that's, people who've been listening to this or at least been following me are probably well aware at this point, but kind of my entire gripe with the industry has always been like, work backwards from some problem that you have or some market gap that exists and then build something and see if crypto helps. Forecast is also super good at this. Like, they didn't even use the chain for a lot of aspects. And it's sometimes you just kind of forgot you were not a blockchain, but you still get certain inherent, certain properties of a blockchain. And so, yeah, it's.
00:12:35.116 - 00:13:33.984, Speaker A: I'm quite bullish on things like, because entrepreneurs like that inspire other entrepreneurs, right. And then you kind of have this network effect of, oh, they did this. Maybe I can tweak it a little bit and build something else, and then you kind of start getting this effect where more legit businesses are being built and, yeah, like, that's super excited to see that and props to that team. And also, there's also, I've seen some sort of, okay, with regulatory clearance coming a little bit in more, let's say, people showing, political politicians showing support for some of these real world assets and crypto, and how crypto rails can improve things. For example, like how PayPal now extended to Solana as well. You kind of, you know, the dominoes start falling and then all of a sudden, hopefully next year, by the time you lose podcast, we even recognize the industry.
00:13:34.364 - 00:14:00.226, Speaker B: All right, let's take a quick break to talk about helium mobile. Every month I'm reminded of the pain of a phone bill. For someone who is terminally online, those tainted charges are no joke. Well, helium mobile is bringing a crypto native solution to this. It's powered by a combination of a decentralized wireless network and the nation's largest 5G network to bring reliable coverage to its users. The coolest part for me are definitely the mobile token rewards. They're earned by sharing a location which allows more people to build coverage where it's needed most.
00:14:00.226 - 00:14:27.856, Speaker B: So effectively, the token rewards end up bringing a better product to the customer. But even cooler, you can take these rewards and pay for your phone bill directly within the app. This is a beautiful showcase of arguably Crypto's two strongest use cases, incentivized user action and crypto payment rails. The phone plan is unlimited time, text and data. Plus, it's affordable at just $20 a month. If this sounds interesting to you, go to hellohelium.com to get three free months of service with the code lightspeed mobile.
00:14:27.856 - 00:14:41.000, Speaker B: Again, that's lightspeed mobile. All caps, no spaces. Be sure to check out the link in the show notes for easy access. All right, guys, let's get back to the show. For sure. For sure. And there was two other major themes over the last two weeks.
00:14:41.000 - 00:15:23.184, Speaker B: I feel like one I personally find far more exciting than the other, but PayPal is launching Pyusd on Solana and specifically using token extensions. They really, like, wanted some of the customization features that token extensions offer, which is super, super cool. And the other one is celebrity coins. They're coming in hot left and right, some better than others. And so I think those are two interesting to talk about. But on the PayPal side, first, this is what I personally find more interesting. They, like, really leaned into the fact that you can do confidential transfers and not reveal the amount of tokens being transferred from point a to point b and from user a to user b, which is a super interesting, um, from, like, a transparency standpoint, you know, like, that's something that often gets talked about about blockchains.
00:15:23.184 - 00:15:53.118, Speaker B: Like, hey, you can see everything. You can, like, assess the financial health of an industry or a protocol or a risk engine. But the other side of that is like, you need some form of privacy. And so I don't, I haven't really peeled back the layers on token extensions yet. Something I'm, like, in the process of doing now as I'm going through and trying to track some of the PyuSD data. But it is really, really cool to have some more functionality. And I thought it was very interesting that the PayPal team, like, specifically cited this as a reason why they wanted to launch on Solana.
00:15:53.118 - 00:16:15.270, Speaker B: So these people are now sophisticated payments companies, are being very intentional about what they're doing and have a much deeper understanding than I think has really ever existed before. So I don't know, I was blown away by the news. I don't know if you watched the presser at all, but I was impressed by the team and the way that they talked about the depth of knowledge around Solana as well.
00:16:15.462 - 00:17:13.944, Speaker A: Yeah. And it kind of shows you a trend that, and I tweet about this, which is that maybe going back slightly over a year, people kind of thought, you know, Solana is gone, it's the next eos. And since then, basically, we've had some sequence of events in the form of visa shown interest in Solana. Right. Then woocommerce, worldpay, Shopify, pay, and then Discord, and then Mastercard actually is doing a pilot stripe most recently, and then now PayPal. And so you're kind of starting to see, like, a lot of these serious institutions are looking at two main chains, really, which Ethereum and rightfully so there's a lot of economic security and kind of network effects there. But then also Solana, which has shown that it can handle production loads at scale while being decentralized.
00:17:13.944 - 00:18:12.234, Speaker A: The interesting part of that, of course, is that they didn't expand just for the speed aspects of Solana, but also because of the native programmability of how the token extensions work on Solana. The one you're highlighting there is the confidential transfers feature, which basically encrypts the amounts being transferred because you don't want everybody to see, you know, how much you pay for what, et cetera. Right? And so it's pretty interesting to see that. And I, and I say this kind of, I said this very frequently, but I really do think that the payments talent on Solana is pretty crazy. Like, there's so many X stripe Venmo and Shopify pay, etcetera, kind of talent on the chain. There's sphere on ramps, off ramps that. And then code is doing things like microtransactions, right? Micropayments.
00:18:12.234 - 00:18:50.336, Speaker A: In fact. Actually, they had a. I forgot to mention this, but at Austin, they had these little things where it was tip cards where you can just kind of. It's a physical tip card. Like, you can leave it somewhere and then if you just scan it, you can send them any kind of small amount of tip and like, in like 400 milliseconds or less because they use like a soft sequencer instead of waiting for the l one. So I really like, oh, and then, like, there was a, there was actually, like, at the salon house, you could pay for coffee using USDC and stuff. And there was even a rave that I went to and they, they asked for phantom, and, like, you would pay.
00:18:50.336 - 00:20:04.914, Speaker A: Pay with it using that. And so it's just such a, it's just such, it feels like such a modern experience. And so I'm super glad to see payments taking off more. And I think the fact that enterprises and institutions are waking up to like, hey, wait a minute, we don't have to set up our entire own infrastructure and run it and do all these setups and integrations, but we can actually just plug into this globally atomic state machine that everybody else is already using and has done the hard work of maintaining, securing, building integrations on top of, if you can kind of hook into that and then use our distribution and let's say, business prowess and start to contribute, then you start getting like this. Maybe you start getting somewhat closer to crypto's vision of p two p payments and much better global commerce. Much more efficient, rather than these weirdly old and integrated, like, CObol mainframes that do batch processing every two days in the basements of New York banks. So hopefully we see more of that going forward.
00:20:05.774 - 00:20:39.444, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm with you. The payments narrative is important, I think, and we're going to see it grow. And I think the so what for users is just like, at the end of the day, if this, we're seeing experimentation, we know that's happening. And if it leads to a better user experience for you, like, you win, and you probably don't even end up knowing what the backend is, and that's okay. So for the user, you probably just get a better ux. And for, like, if you're just Solana passionate, you know what that means is an influx of transaction demand. And I think that's definitely something that most people are looking for as well, if, again, coming from that, like, crypto native lens.
00:20:39.824 - 00:21:37.906, Speaker A: Yeah. And there's like, two sides of this where, like, multicore actually had a good piece on this. But, like, when you think of payments, there's kind of actually two aspects, right? There's kind of the rails themselves, like the technology that you use to move the money around, but I think. And then there's for that to work, you need on ramps and off ramps, and those to be pretty solid and frictionless and great ux. The other part of this, though, is if you're a chain that is home to deepen in rwas and stuff like that, you start to earn money directly on chain. And that completely eliminates even the need for on ramps and off ramps, right? If you're like, let's say you do bounties and write code, or maybe you're in a hotspot, or maybe you're mapping, or maybe you rent out your GPU capacity or something, you're earning these things directly on chain. And as more and more people do that, I don't know what that timeframe looks like, maybe five years or something.
00:21:37.906 - 00:22:19.144, Speaker A: But as more and more people do that, then the need for just being able to pay without worrying about the on ramps and off ramps goes up. And I think that's pretty interesting, especially in developing places where the on ramp, off ramp situation is like, bordering. Bordering robbery, I want to say. Right? Like, it gets pretty bad. And so I think if there are some small pockets in the world of small markets like Latams, or the world, maybe some parts of Africa, Southeast Asia, et cetera, where you don't even have to worry about on ramp soft frames, you just get paid on chain, but then use the existing payment rails on chain to conduct finance or commerce. That starts looking super interesting.
00:22:20.124 - 00:22:47.390, Speaker B: Yeah, that's actually a great angle. I've never even considered it from that lens. Maybe I'll try to find that multi coin piece and put the link in the show notes as well, because that's a good one. I guess the other side of this was the celeb coins. I'll try to do a recap of an attempt at what happened over the past couple of days. I think it really kicked off with Caitlyn Jenner launching a token. It seems to be this ominous character named Sahil.
00:22:47.390 - 00:23:29.710, Speaker B: That is what what appears to be. And again, I'm sure there's a couple of degens out there that are about to call me an idiot for getting the sequence of events here wrong, but this is, from my point of view, seems to be this Sahil character, kind of behind the scenes, reaching out to the managers of these famous people and saying, hey, like, I'll launch this token. You'll make a bunch of money. Probably leaves out the fact that he will too. And he's like, running the contract deployment. And like, the Twitter popular, the social media presence for these campaigns seemed like Caitlyn Jenner had hers first, and then kind of was like this weird sequence of like, Floyd Mayweather was on there. Rich the kid was back in the conversation about having this as well.
00:23:29.710 - 00:23:52.890, Speaker B: DeVito was another one, and then Iggy as well. Iggy Azalea. Iggy Azalea. I think, like, realized that what was happening here from, like, this is mostly a scam point of view, and so decided to, like, independently launch her own token. And this one, she hosted a Twitter space, which I listened to crypto. Twitter was like, in love with the Twitter space. I don't know.
00:23:52.890 - 00:24:24.396, Speaker B: To me, it just sounded like she was bored and wanted to have some fun. And like, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that, but, like, I don't think she's, like, coming at the space to, like, make it better or anything like that. I think she was just like, yeah, like, this looks cool. Like, let me try to do it. Why not? I don't think there's anything wrong with that. But there is this weird push and pull of these social tokens. If you rewind to the NFT craze of last cycle, social tokens really were something often discussed.
00:24:24.396 - 00:24:55.278, Speaker B: You saw a lot of celebrities launch these NFT projects that were supposed to have utility. Most of them don't because they've been abandoned. Um, and it's like, it's really hard to kind of figure out like what is the proper purpose of a social token, right. You don't get a portion of their, you know, career earnings or most like a lot of these recent launches, you don't get any utility at all. And a lot of them will like advertise that you don't get any utility at all. It's like just like a fun thing. Right.
00:24:55.278 - 00:25:10.804, Speaker B: But like why does the marginal buyer exist? Is because they think that the token price will go up. So I don't know, what are your thoughts on the ideas of like these celebrities launching social tokens? It's this very strange time we're in. I genuinely do not know how to think about this.
00:25:10.964 - 00:26:06.794, Speaker A: Yeah, it seems to be quite a controversial topic, especially when the price goes up. Things that seem a bit questionable seem to be controversial because people's, let's say financial motives get in the way a little bit. So yeah, there are a few things about this. So I mean, I don't think the inherent idea of celebrities launching a coin can be good or bad. It kind of just is my problem. So several problems with this, but one of my problems is that people try to over intellectualize this and to be like, oh, well, you know, this is the next future of finance. There's this economy and then you use tokens to capture this part of this economy and it grows and its stuff and its like, no, the reason youre saying that is because the price is actually going up right now, but the price is not going to keep going up forever because its not backed by anything.
00:26:06.794 - 00:27:14.874, Speaker A: And then people will say something like, well, money is a meme, okay, and im like, okay, go to the United States, let me know what you think is the meme there because that is an entire nation backing that thing. Okay, so its like Kyle says a lot, which is reasoning by analogy often leads to the wrong conclusion. It's absolutely true here. I think there's a few things here, but basically as long as you're super upfront about the information asymmetry present in these things, for example, a celebrity will have maybe some wallets that are anonymous holding x percent of the token, and you just like can't know that the tooling for it doesn't really exist. And basically what we do is rely on Zach XBT to call them out at some point. And if he does that, then we won't buy it. If he doesn't, then who knows? And so I think it's actually quite good to practice high degrees of skepticism here, because historically, the success rate of these things is basically zero.
00:27:14.874 - 00:27:29.870, Speaker A: Right. And so I think if you just label it as something like, okay, we're having fun. It's a casino. We're speculating on all this stuff. It's like, you know, fine, that's. I think that's okay. I think if you want to.
00:27:29.870 - 00:27:56.304, Speaker A: If you're, like, super upfront about that, that's cool. As long as there's no, like, information asymmetry that you're hiding from the buyers. Right. Because my thing is, as long as there's. As long as the buyers and sellers have the same information. Right. And the buyer or the sellers aren't, like, hiding certain things, like, unlocks in, like, you know, the eventual rug of the project or something, that's fine.
00:27:56.304 - 00:28:35.660, Speaker A: And so. But I think using that to say, like, we're getting, like, real adoption or something is kind of missing the point. And I tweet about this yesterday, which is that, like, one of the silliest ideas is kind of looking for adoption for the sake of adoption without it actually solving any problems. Right? Like, it's kind of like looking for a girlfriend just for the sake of getting a girlfriend without actually liking the person you're with or something. It's like, sure, you got the adoption, but it's like, why? Just so you can say you did it. Like, it's not. And so I think.
00:28:35.660 - 00:29:32.684, Speaker A: And this goes actually back to what we're talking about with Baxter and maybe Highmapper, which is that adoption is something that emerges from there being a problem, and then you putting out a solution, and then people adopting that solution to solve their problems. Okay, so in this case, the problem is maybe people are bored, and maybe they want ways to make money and speculate, and then. So is this adoption for that? Sure. Absolutely. I mean, clearly, meme coins have adoption in the case of, you know, making money, having fun speculating. Now, obviously, there is also, when you combine that with information asymmetry, that also leads to a lot of scams. And I think it's wrong to say that it's all scams, but I think it's also wrong to say that this is like adoption and, like, we're bringing things on chain because, you know, that's what crypto is all about.
00:29:32.684 - 00:30:18.284, Speaker A: The truth is often much more nuanced than that. And one of the things I wasn't liking on CT was when people try to, like, they completely lose the plot, and they're like, well, you know, how is this different than you know, like a peloton stock going down or like a uniswap token price going down. And it's like, okay, now you're on very dangerous territory because now you're basically trying to make it seem like everything on earth is a meme and that nothing matters and that nothing should be tied to reality. Okay? That is really. That's cope. Okay. You are coping with the fact that there is no real value being created anywhere, right? Speculate all you want, that's fine.
00:30:18.284 - 00:31:07.928, Speaker A: But do not detract from the work that people are actually doing. Like, peloton fundamentally, at least produces things that they think will help people in that market, which is, you know, people trying to get fit and maybe work out at home or whatever, or maybe join a community, stuff like that. And so they produce some sort of goods and services and they get value for it, and then the market values it, however. But there's still some aspect of reality there. And so if you are now going with this narrative that everything is a meme, it's super dangerous, because now you're maybe inspiring other people to think that way. And so now, in a space that already doesn't have too much substance to begin with, I mean, there's some substance, but maybe it's a little lacking. If you're now saying, actually nothing is real, everything is a meme.
00:31:07.928 - 00:31:25.464, Speaker A: Therefore, just focus on memes. That starts to look pretty stupid and false. Like, it's just not how it works. And if you do that, I don't think you ever get true adoption. So that's my gripe with it. Again, speculate all you want, whatever, that's okay. I do not care about this.
00:31:25.464 - 00:31:42.564, Speaker A: But do not try to over intellectualize it to, like, this is actually really good because of x and nothing is real anyways. Okay, that's kind of my point on it. And so, you know, you kind of have to hold these two things in your mind without going too far into one camp, in my view.
00:31:43.064 - 00:31:54.408, Speaker B: Well said. Well said. But the role of a VC is to over intellectualize Mert. No, I'm kidding. No, I mean. I mean, I agree. I like to do so at the very beginning there, which was, it just is like, this will just exist.
00:31:54.408 - 00:32:21.540, Speaker B: I would prefer people to not blatantly scam people, but if you're going to just, like, launch a token and, like, not rug it, like, okay, I don't know if there's any legal consequences there. Like, I don't think anybody knows, but it seems like something that's going to happen and you're going to get these things called social tokens, and they're probably going to end in tears. So tread. Tread carefully, but speculate freely. I mean, that's kind of the TLDR, in my opinion, in there as well.
00:32:21.652 - 00:32:48.986, Speaker A: Yeah. Also, the one thing that I'd like to say is, like, people were like, so Iggy's coin, I think mother or something, like, went down and then it went up and people like, oh, look, it didn't rug. That was their standard, right? It had been maybe four days, I believe. And they were like, oh, like, she's super into crypto. She has been talking about it for four days and didn't rug. And it's like, what I would say to that is, please have some higher standards.
00:32:49.050 - 00:32:50.530, Speaker B: Yeah, right?
00:32:50.682 - 00:33:25.644, Speaker A: Like, I mean, look, if I have 7.6 million followers or whatever and I launch a token, no real rational person would rug that unless they just totally don't care. And so the fact that it wasn't rugged and that she asked questions like, you know, how does this work? It's like, okay, cool. But maybe, maybe we're being blinded a little bit by the price going up and starting to, like, just the number one thing is think for yourself and don't let markets kind of thing for you, because if you do that, you're not going to like it when the market goes down.
00:33:25.684 - 00:33:25.908, Speaker B: Right.
00:33:25.956 - 00:33:33.192, Speaker A: I think Jeff Bezos has some sort of saying like that, just. Just please have some higher standards than, like, oh, this is successful because it didn't rug right away.
00:33:33.368 - 00:33:45.152, Speaker B: That's what I was saying about the Twitter space. Like, everybody was like, oh, my God, she is incredible. Like, this is awesome. Like, she, like, just is curious. That's like, that was my takeaway. She was like, oh, yeah, this is, like, cool. Like, let me play around with it.
00:33:45.152 - 00:33:58.576, Speaker B: Like, I'm interested. That was the standards. I totally agree. I'm like, good Lord. Like, you gotta pick it up a little bit, people. But I don't know, maybe that was an interesting take as well. And Ryan Connor from the blockworks research team had a really interesting viewpoint on this.
00:33:58.576 - 00:34:14.972, Speaker B: He was like, this feels pretty normal to me. I don't know. Like, me and my buddies will throw $100 on whatever random sports, you know, if it's like NBA finals. So, like, we're betting on that. We're going to watch it. It's not about winning. It's about, like, enjoying the moment with your friends and, like, making fun of the guy who made the shitty bet.
00:34:14.972 - 00:34:39.496, Speaker B: Like, that's what it is, you know, it's like, this just feels like the same thing, but with a different sport, and it's meme coins. So that was probably that one hit home for me because I was like, yeah, nope, me and my friends do the same shit. So it's. It's just this weird speculative gambling in, like, a different Internet context. Feels kind of dystopian when you frame it like that. But, like, the sport is watching green and red bars on the screen. Like, that's literally what it is.
00:34:39.640 - 00:34:52.564, Speaker A: Yeah. And, like, that's fine. Okay. That's fine. If you want to do that, go ahead. The problem starts to arise when you then extrapolate to say, this is the only thing this industry is about, and everything is a meme. Okay.
00:34:52.564 - 00:35:13.856, Speaker A: I disagree with that strongly, and I think many other people trying to build real things would as well. And so, you know, just, I do not want people to look at crypto and be like, this is it. That's it. Nothing else. Right. And because, you know, that's not going to work in your favor against regulators either. It's like, hey, you know, senator, what is.
00:35:13.856 - 00:35:23.168, Speaker A: What is crypto good for? It's like, oh, well, Iggy Azalea launched a coin and didn't rug in four days. So, you know, it's like, let's do maybe some higher standards, my friends.
00:35:23.256 - 00:35:56.718, Speaker B: Big, big news. Blockworks is hosting permissionless three in Salt Lake City this year. So we're heading west for three days starting October 9. Permissionless is our industry's premier defi event that brings together crypto natives from all over the globe. I've personally been the last few years and can honestly say that the attendees are incredible. It's people who actually care about crypto. We also have more than 200 industry titans speaking at the event, and this includes builders like Lucas Breuder from Judo Labs and Brian Pellegrino from Layer Zero, or investors like Kyle Simone and Joe McCann, and even elected officials like representative Tom Emmer, who is fighting the good fight in Washington.
00:35:56.718 - 00:36:20.976, Speaker B: And it's narrative season, so we're going to be covering the seven hottest themes in crypto. This includes things like modularity and restaking, or bitcoin and l two s, and even AI and crypto. The goal is to keep you up to speed on major developments in the industry. Ticket prices will be structurally increasing over time, so get your ticket today from my lightspeed family. I got you. We're going to use code lightspeed, ten in all caps. No space for 10% off your ticket.
00:36:20.976 - 00:36:41.206, Speaker B: All right, everyone, I look forward to seeing you at permissionless three. And let's get back to the show. Yeah. Yeah. Another thing I wanted to talk about, I guess, is more ending on a technical note, but failed transactions just keep coming up, which. I get it. It's like an easy chart that gets circulated around, and, you know, like, even we do this, like, green has failed, red or green is successful, red is failed.
00:36:41.206 - 00:36:53.654, Speaker B: And so when you filter out the green one, you just see these red bars that said failed. And people are like, well, oh, this is a shitty ux. And so I've had it. I've. I've had it with this narrative because it's just not true. And it. I don't.
00:36:53.654 - 00:37:15.116, Speaker B: I don't. Like, I'm not upset with anyone. It is a hard concept to understand. And I put out a thread that was, like, a four part series on this concept, which was literally three, four lightspeed episodes, ending with the Tolle and Lucas episode. And so I want to take a look at some of this data. So let's start from the top again. Here's the failed transaction count.
00:37:15.116 - 00:38:02.004, Speaker B: Total transaction count. We'll filter out the votes. So we're just looking at non votes here in the top left, we saw a material decrease starting around the beginning of June, which we'll jump into in a second. But I just want to take a look here because one thing that I found super interesting was I've broken out the transactions based on the number. Like, basically created user segments based around the number of transactions you send per day. So I broke that up between, like, one to five transactions being like, this very simple user, six to 50 being more of like, a power trader, right? If you run, like, 15 transactions in a day, like, you're someone trading celebrity coins all day, and that's okay, but you're a different user group. And they've kind of scaled that up to basically bots that are, you know, if you send over 5000 transactions in a day, like, you are not a human.
00:38:02.004 - 00:38:31.978, Speaker B: I don't. I physically don't think you could push or you could click that many times in a day. And so I've kind of segmented these to, like, really draw out real users from, like, very clear bots that are spamming the network. Couple things to take away the one to five transactions per day group accounts for 1.6% of the total transactions sent per day and 76% of the total active addresses in a day. So we have this huge address pool that only generates 1.6% of transactions.
00:38:31.978 - 00:38:59.466, Speaker B: And on the flip side of that, we see the bots group or that over 5000 transactions per day, they're 86% of the total transactions and only 0.1% of the total addresses. So we have about 3000 addresses that account for 86% of the transactions in the day. I think that's going to be a trend you see going forward on every major chain. That's cheap. If you have cheap transactions, you have the ability to run interesting scripts. A lot of this is related to arbitrage.
00:38:59.466 - 00:39:47.622, Speaker B: I don't think that's a good or bad thing. That's another one of those things that just is. Now, when we see this chart in the top right here, which is the non vote transaction breakdown between failed and successful transactions, everybody gets all alarmed here because like, oh, my God, over half the transactions on Solana fail, meaning I have to send two transactions to get what my intent through the system, which is not the case. When we look back at our table, that breaks down what these failure rates are for each of these transaction groups. We see that the bot group, again, over 5000 transactions in a day, fails about half the time. But the normal user, that one to five fails about 9% of the time. When we look at that on a chart, I've put basically calling the normal users, the power users and the bots on this chart here on the left.
00:39:47.622 - 00:40:27.414, Speaker B: And you can see the discrepancy over the last month between these groups. And what this tells to me is like, hey, there are arbitrages that are profitable if you spam them over and over again. But I was talking about this on Twitter the other day, and somebody had a very good point. They're like, hey, well, a 9% failure rate is still not good. That's one in every ten transactions failing for a normal user. I was like, okay, that's a good point. The takeaway is there shouldn't be like, the transaction doesn't just go through just because, again, these are failed transactions where your transaction made it into the block but reverted before it could complete because there was some error.
00:40:27.414 - 00:41:15.744, Speaker B: So I zoomed in on that one to five transactions per day group and said, all right, well, what are the errors that you guys are hitting the most? And so 75% of the errors that happened for that group are slippage related errors for Jupiter and radium based swaps. So this is like a use. This normal user goes in and is like, hey, I want to buy this celebrity meme coin and I'm going to put my transaction through for like $100 and 0.1% slippage. Like these meme coins are so volatile that will almost always fail. And so the point here being like, this is like sort of a front end or an application issue and not a chain level problem. And so I just want to unpack that again because I feel like the discourse is still related to this is a chain problem, but it's not.
00:41:15.744 - 00:41:49.632, Speaker B: The chain problem is the networking layer. And when I click send on Phantom and I just get a spinning wheel for about a minute to two minutes and then nothing happens. That is a dropped transaction. It never made it to the leader. Or if it did make it to the leader, the leader can never process it and recognize it as being there. And that is the big, big problem, but is much harder to track because the leaders basically are the only people that have this data. On that last podcast I mentioned earlier with Anatoly and Lucas, Anatoly said there was about like a half million, 500,000 transactions that are hitting the leader at times.
00:41:49.632 - 00:42:31.814, Speaker B: And if we look at the box, there's only about 800 to 1000 or so transactions, non vote transactions that are making it in. And so those dropped transactions, like those are the big issue. So, mert, I don't know if there's any color you want to add there, but one more thing I found super interesting on this is looking at the median fee paid by these groups. So that bot group has a very, very low median fee, meaning that they're figured out a way to or when they're spamming. I haven't really unpacked this. This is me thinking aloud. But when they're sending all these transactions, they're like, because we're sending so many of these will probably be at the front of the block and don't really need to worry about paying a high priority fee, given that the priority fee mechanism is a little bit broken today.
00:42:31.814 - 00:43:19.824, Speaker B: And then on the contrary, you see that one to five and six to 50 groups, you see both of them being like, I want this thing through. And like, people hear priority fee, they're like, if I pay more, it'll go faster. And so you actually see a significantly higher priority fee for both of those groups relative to the bots. But even more interestingly is the six to 50 is consistently paying more in their median fee relative to the one to five. And if you think about who the difference is between a six to 50 transactions per day and a one to five transactions per day, that is somebody who is actively trading meme coins and is willing to take on more risks or to pay higher fees, because nobody is trading a meme coin for a 5% gain. They're all trading for ten x 50 xs. That's an interesting dataset that I've recently been playing with.
00:43:20.524 - 00:44:11.574, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah, thanks for that. First of all, I think I need access to this so I can look at it, create some stolen tweets. But, yeah, I mean, I think that also makes sense. And one of the things is, like, what people don't seem to understand is that, like, free markets exist, but they're not implemented in a bulletproof fashion. And so what you end up having, and by the way, continuous block building makes this worse as well, because it's some sort of probability function to be included in the block, and it consists of fees, but also spam. And so some combination of spam and paying the right fees and being from some geography, given who the leader is, et cetera, being first the leader, you combine all these things and you get some output for probability of being included in the block.
00:44:11.574 - 00:45:18.812, Speaker A: And so we're kind of in this awkward phase where you can get included in the block if you spam enough. Sometimes some values are actually starting to block that because it's super low quality traffic, and they obviously have an incentive to maximize their block rewards. But then some searchers or arbitrators are exploiting the system as well, which is, well, we actually, if you spam enough, we might still be more profitable than just paying the fees to get in. There are some shortcomings with the system, but we are aware of pretty much all these issues. There's a lot of work behind the scenes by a lot of teams. Cheeto fired, insert Anza margin, Helios overclock, and we're making a lot of good progress here. And this is actually my favorite part of shitcoins, which is that we built a system as engineers, and shitcoining leads to such an environment where people are always trying to exploit certain parts of the system, trying to extract value on both kind of the supply side and the demand side.
00:45:18.812 - 00:45:56.586, Speaker A: And you play these out in production with adversarial environments and different motives, and you start to see how the system behaves. And then that's like, that data is gold. Once you have that data, you're like, okay, here's what I need to fix. Here's what I will fix once I fix this. And then when the next, whatever activity happens or cycle happens, we're much better off for that, and the system scales much better. That's kind of the superpower of being an engineering driven culture on Solana, which is you ship things you see how they work and then you fix the things. And if your time horizon is long, right, it's not, you know, two years.
00:45:56.586 - 00:46:26.022, Speaker A: Right. Let's assume Solana goes down in like the next five months and your time horizon is one year, that's bad. But if your time horizon is 100 years and that learning actually improved Solana and made it much more antifragile for the next x amount of years, that's what you want. Obviously, you don't want aliveness failure on purpose, but you do want the learnings. And sometimes the only way to get those learnings is to kind of ship things in prod and serve users and see what happens. And so that's very solid analysis. Thanks for doing the work there.
00:46:26.158 - 00:47:05.670, Speaker B: Yeah, you've called out the engineering focused culture. Sometimes I'm like, think like an economist for just 2 seconds here, and then let's go back to the engineering side. But because sometimes I'm like, I think we need to think about the economic side of this. But I think you can see Ethereum has shifted probably too heavily in the economist camp rather than the engineering camp in some regard. And so, yeah, I think there is a balance there, I will say. But when the beginning half of the lifecycle, I do very much think it needs to be like, you got to be maxing out for the, for the engineering side of things because of what you just mentioned. Like, you're going to end up optimizing for a situation that is not going to be your normal state.
00:47:05.670 - 00:47:59.302, Speaker B: And what I mean by that is like, even talking to Tolly and Lucas on that episode again, he was like, there should be an order of operations where we shouldn't make an economic decision based on the current state of the chain, because we know there are bugs in the implementation of our networking layer. And so if we did them in the reverse order, then we'd end up having to change it twice. And so I'm like, okay, that's a very practical way to approach the problem. And one thing I think about that really gets lost in the sauce of the comparisons between Ethereum and Solana, is people are comparing the nine year old Ethereum to the four year old Solana in their current states. But I'm like, if you shift the timelines back and compare four year old Ethereum to four year old Solana, and that's where you get a very much different world, right? People point to the inflation of like 5.5% on Solana and say, oh my God, like, this is crazy. Ethereum's like raw issuance is, like, less than a percent.
00:47:59.302 - 00:48:19.416, Speaker B: Like, yeah, it's a nine year old chain. It's already, like, gone through its economic cycle, and that has not happened on Solana. We still have a fee mechanism that nobody really likes but is functional. So we keep it. Right. Like, I don't know. I'm really kind of thinking about comparing these things on a more life cycle timeline than, rather than, like, the point a and point b of today.
00:48:19.416 - 00:48:33.224, Speaker B: I think that, like, adds an extra layer of complexity there and gives you a little bit deeper of an analysis. That's something I'm building. Maybe I'll have it ready for next week. But nonetheless, always a pleasure chatting. Mertz really enjoyed this week's roundup. And to the listeners, we will see you next.
