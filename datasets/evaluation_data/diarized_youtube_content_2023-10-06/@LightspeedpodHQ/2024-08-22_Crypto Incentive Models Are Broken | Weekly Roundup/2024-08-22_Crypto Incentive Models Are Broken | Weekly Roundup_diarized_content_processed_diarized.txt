00:00:00.320 - 00:00:22.321, Speaker A: I think there needs to be something change to change with the incentives of crypto where builders are actually building real businesses that use crypto rails to improve their businesses as opposed to starting from a tech stack and a token and then be like, you know, what's the best way I can sell this to other people and get a bigger bag? Like, that's just not productive.

00:00:49.245 - 00:01:10.585, Speaker C: Hello and welcome back to another episode of Lightspeed. I'm Jack Kubenek, co hosting alongside Mert. I am still recording from North Carolina. I got rugged by Spirit Airlines and I'm spending another week in the South. And Mert, you were having plane troubles as well, I hear.
00:01:11.325 - 00:01:17.021, Speaker A: Yep, stuck in New York. But I got a $20 voucher so I'll be fine.
00:01:17.213 - 00:01:40.003, Speaker C: That, that fixes everything. I yeah, I had a earlier this summer, Delta, like not due to weather or anything, Delta just delayed a flight. I was on six hours. I missed a wedding. It was terrible. And they, yeah, they gave a $10 lunch voucher which at LaGuardia Airport gets you like a snack, if that. So yes, bearish on airlines these days.
00:01:40.003 - 00:02:39.351, Speaker C: But yeah, fortunately I have somewhere good to stay and I'm enjoying North Carolina. But yeah, so today we're going to be doing another roundup. It's been a little bit since we've done one of these. There's been some interesting news to break, some fun stories and so excited to dive into it all with you, Mert. We're going to get into the Eigenlayer token drama, which is maybe one of the bigger stories, but I want to just warm us up a little bit. I'm going to start with prediction markets, which are a topic that I'm personally very interested in given how they relate to news and media and the job I do and stuff. So I guess maybe like one piece of news to pull out here is this week a group of Democrats signed a letter urging the CFTC to ban prediction markets.
00:02:39.351 - 00:03:29.885, Speaker C: So pulling here from a piece by my colleague at Blockworks, Casey Wagner, the eight senators and representatives argued political betting markets could influence and interfere with election results. A quote from the letter they sent said, you Know, prediction markets would replace political convictions with financial calculations. So you're not voting based on your, you know, conviction. You just want to make a profit off of whoever wins. Now, a lot of, you know, fans of Poly Market, which is crypto's big prediction market that's doing tons and tons of volume ahead of the election right now, we're not happy with this letter. But an interesting point that Casey raises in this piece is that technically US Citizens can't use Poly Market already. So this letter doesn't really change anything.
00:03:29.885 - 00:04:11.955, Speaker C: Obviously, many people use VPNs and still access poly market in the US but it's maybe not a good signal if the CFTC bans prediction markets. But currently only competitors like Predictit or Kalshi are usable in the U.S. so that's one strand. Strand two. We're recording this on Tuesday, August 20th, yesterday, the 19th, drift this perps Dex on Solana launched prediction markets. When I last checked, there were $400,000 bet the odds track what's on Poly Market and sort of the pitch for Drift. Prediction markets are, I mean, a.
00:04:11.955 - 00:04:51.741, Speaker C: It's the first prediction market, I guess, to be built on Solana, but it's also seen they're pitching it as being more capital efficient because you can use any asset as collateral, not just usdc. And while you're locked into your position, you can earn yield. So say you bet on Harris to win the election in November, between now and November, that money that you locked into the position can earn yield. So it's a more efficient prediction market. Maybe, if it works out. David Liu, who is one of the core contributors over there, wrote on Twitter, it's going to represent capital markets for truth. So that's a bit of a summary.
00:04:51.741 - 00:05:10.795, Speaker C: And mert, I guess where I want to start with you is how do you view prediction markets broadly? Are they capital markets for truth, like David Liu is saying, or is this just an extension of the crypto casino? It's another way to use crypto to gamble your money first.
00:05:10.835 - 00:05:21.195, Speaker A: By the way, just while it's on my mind, it's not the first betting platform on Solana or the predictions market. That's a team called Hedgehog that's been around for a little bit.
00:05:21.235 - 00:05:22.299, Speaker C: Oh, sure, yes, yes.
00:05:22.347 - 00:06:22.605, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So, I mean, I saw a tweet yesterday, I think from Mike Dudas, which put it well, which was something like, so we're calling betting prediction markets or something like that, or like the rebrand of betting to prediction markets is up there with crypto to web3 and yeah, I think that's pretty much accurate. I mean you're essentially just betting on an outcome. I do like the name prediction markets better. Sounds, sounds, makes me feel cooler. And now if it's are these markets for finding truth, I think currently they're definitely more of a casino resemblance. I think over a long period of time and much more capital where you're able to.
00:06:22.605 - 00:07:24.261, Speaker A: Because the problem with markets is at least volatile in early markets is that they can be swayed quite easily by a single individual. And so one of the things I hate using or one of the biggest mistakes people make in just pure stats is using average instead of median in certain kind of data sets. So like for example, I think Naseem Taleb has a saying, you never want to cross a river that's a thousand feet or that is like 3,000ft long on average or something. Never cross a river that is on average four feet deep. And that's because you'll die if you do that. And I think it's kind of the same thing here. I do think it's fun.
00:07:24.261 - 00:08:32.335, Speaker A: And the one thing I really like about prediction markets is I would say most of the people I know, maybe it's just my friend group which is extremely djen that's not in crypto actually bet on basically everything. Like they'll bet on sports, obviously fights, but they'll fight on some weird shit like, like virtual hamster races or some. And like they bet on that stuff. And so that's a pretty big use case. And I guess the one thing that you need to then think about is what does crypto solve here that existing betting apps like FanDuel and whatnot don't like what, what is the missing thing that they're solving for? It seems like Drift has some ideas, right? Like you can obviously it's already a perp stacks so you can use. They have a good cross margin system and there's some good liquidity. You can get yields and I mean arguably the user base for crypto is much more, let's say degen and so it might benefit the platform more as well.
00:08:32.335 - 00:09:14.205, Speaker A: And then there's obviously polymarket. I've actually never used Poly Market, so take my words with a grain of salt. I tried using it once and then it asked me for like an EVM wallet and I was like yeah, I'm not going to do that but, but. And oh. And then the other thing that I think would be quite interesting actually is if they integrate, integrate this with blinks so I can just scroll things and if I Just see like a random bet like, hey, will Conor McGregor win this fight? Or something. And it's just on Twitter and I'm just scrolling. Then maybe I'll just press yes and then put in like a few bucks so that I think that it could be quite interesting.
00:09:14.205 - 00:09:32.979, Speaker A: So excited for it. I don't really know much about the regulation stuff. I'm much more of a small government guy. So the fact that they're trying to ban it kind of feels weird, especially because us people can't access it on without doing some weird stuff. So, yeah, that's all I got.
00:09:33.147 - 00:10:17.259, Speaker C: Yeah. I think to also give Hedgehog markets its credit, I think they, they did build a blink of a prediction market of some kind. I saw that on the timeline. I think. Yeah, I'm, you know, for a while it seemed like a Twitter growth hack in, in crypto was to tweet that, you know, prediction markets are going to replace traditional news and it's a more fair and objective way to reach truth and all these things. And obviously I'm biased because I'm in news, but that always just annoyed me a bit because I think a lot of truth exists more in shades than in, yes, no outcomes that you can bet on. And so there's always going to be a place for news.
00:10:17.259 - 00:10:52.075, Speaker C: And I think prediction markets tend to react to news more than create news, which is sometimes how they're pitched. One good example is, you know, the Democratic VP nominee, Tim Walls. Walls, I don't know how to say his last name still. I should learn that. But he was trading at below 25% odds to be the VP pick right up until he was chosen. And you know, if this was a truth seeking market, then you would think that insiders would have, I guess, traded on, you know, Kamala Harris's thinking. But those types of people aren't really trading in these markets.
00:10:52.075 - 00:11:44.175, Speaker C: And much more likely it's, it's a place to gamble. It's, it's, it's a betting market. I do, however, think there are uses for these, like if you want to lean into the market's identity rather than just betting. 1 Neeraj Agarwal from a coin center tweeted yesterday, like there was this kind of questionable headline that went viral for a little bit that if Harris was elected, she'd make Gary Gensler chair of the SEC or something like that. The sourcing was a little bit suspect on that. It was like a right wing outlet, probably with Republican sources who may not know. You know, Harris is thinking, and he was like, what like, what if there was a poly market that went up right after this headline went out for whether it's true or not.
00:11:44.175 - 00:12:44.371, Speaker C: And then, you know, you can force people to actually, you know, have a financial stake on if they believe this or if they're just engagement baiting on Twitter, things like that. I also think that, like, political polls famously don't work very well. In the past couple of US Presidential elections, the, the kind of predicted voting outcomes have been very different from how the vote actually shook out. And I think if people have a financial incentive to be correct, maybe you can trust a poly market poll more than like a pollster calling a bunch of people on the phone and then extrapolating that to the whole population. So I get, I think there are uses for prediction markets. But yeah, that's a little bit of a bugaboo for me is when they're pitched as sort of this post news method of truth seeking. One other interesting point to bring out on these is Nigel Eckles, I believe his name is.
00:12:44.371 - 00:13:30.635, Speaker C: He's building kind of a casino project on Solana or something. And he Formerly was at FanDuel, I believe, but he was tweeting that, you know, you won't really know if Poly Market or I guess Drift Bet now is a sustainable business until after the election because elections are very unique news events in that they're settled by a yes no outcome. And a lot of news events are very gray. Like it's hard to take a bet that resolves at a specific date. And you saw, I mean, there was controversy about the Baron Trump Trump token and whether it was involved with Baron Trump. And the yes no on Poly Market had a lot of controversy. So there's a lot of problems.
00:13:30.635 - 00:14:03.567, Speaker C: I think you have to wait until after the election to see if they are sustainable businesses. I wonder if Poly Market will pivot to sports because those are, you know, things that have binary outcomes you can bet on as well. But yeah, and I believe we'll also be having drift on the pod so we'll get more of a chance to chat with, I believe, Cindy over there about prediction markets and whether they're going to take my job. But yeah. Do you have, do you have further takes on prediction markets, Martin?
00:14:03.711 - 00:15:04.411, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's definitely incorrect to call them truth machines or, you know, whatever the saying there is. I think certain parts. I mean, you can definitely not create knowledge or truth from them, which is, you know, let's say like most knowledge that exists in the world is some sort of contrarian thought that becomes True, because somebody kind of articulates it in such a way like science is one example or just creating new products or outcomes. I think Parisian markets seem to be a good tool for converging on truth, but potentially not actually determining truth. Again, it's just, it wouldn't really make sense to me. I, I don't think that's going to be possible. Even with sports betting for example, that's a prediction market on who you think will win.
00:15:04.411 - 00:15:53.125, Speaker A: There is no, you know, way to determine the truth of something that neither fighter like knows in a fight who's gonna win. And so it just seems like a two over convergence which is, which is cool. But I would be careful to not make this the, that mistake of thinking they tell the truth. And yeah, I think the part I'm actually interested in is kind of Nigel's comment because Nigel is quite, quite experienced in this. I mean he's the co founder of FanDuel, which is one of the biggest betting apps on earth. And so he really knows what he's talking about. And yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's an interesting question whether these things will be, I mean they'll be around for sure, but whether they'll be the talk of the town after the election.
00:15:53.125 - 00:16:56.961, Speaker A: I was talking to a few VCs because polymarket raised or at least announced their raise a few months ago or pretty recently. And yeah, some of the VCs are basically saying, well, like we don't believe this business will be sustainable or keep the same pace of growth, let's say after the election cycle. And VCs only bet on growth. Like they're not okay with like you just stay at a number and then make money. They need to, you just keep growing so that they can be a good exit sometime. And I think then it becomes fascinating because it becomes a question of marketing to me. Like if I were running one of these companies and then it's like, okay, you have to look at the market and be like, okay, who are my users? Who's doing the most betting? Who's using these things the most? And then yeah, generally it's sports but I've always been still and I keep kind of beating on this drum which you know, I don't think most people agree with.
00:16:56.961 - 00:17:26.755, Speaker A: But like I've always been a big social fi guy and I feel like you could do some quite interesting things with prediction markets and social fi and just, you know, like will Adam Cochran write a shitty tweet thread about this event or Something like, I think it could be funny and I think it's just going to be all in the go to market and go marketing and so that's going to be fun to watch. Um, I don't know how it plays out, but it'll be fun to watch.
00:17:27.495 - 00:17:30.915, Speaker C: Did you, did. Do you like sports bet, Mert?
00:17:31.455 - 00:17:33.471, Speaker A: Yes, I do.
00:17:33.583 - 00:17:42.695, Speaker C: Do you know that like if you're too good at sports betting, like if you're consistently beating the line or whatever, they'll limit your amount. You can bet every day.
00:17:43.635 - 00:17:45.179, Speaker A: I have not been there yet.
00:17:45.307 - 00:18:24.485, Speaker C: I was. You're not good enough, Merton. But I was listening to a Bloomberg podcast about this where, you know, because betters will run models to figure out like what, you know, lines are being biased by, I don't know, people like the Yankees and so they're getting too favorable of a line or something. Um, and if sportsbooks catch you doing this, they'll just ban your account or they'll limit you to like $1 in betting per day, which is seems really like corrupt to me. I'm. I'm. It's amazing that this sort of thing is, is kind of legal in a lot of states now where crypto even isn't.
00:18:24.485 - 00:18:45.095, Speaker C: But I wonder if that's a potential use case for something like Poly Market too is just the crypto ethos of permissionlessness. Like, hey, we're not gonna ban your account for being too good at trading. Go ahead and run models because the whole point is to discover truth or something.
00:18:45.595 - 00:19:07.255, Speaker A: Yeah, that'd be useful, I think. So goes back to answer my earlier question on what could this enable that existing ones don't? So yeah, that could be cool. I mean, assuming they don't get shafted by the regulation or some sort of hack, but the end state of it seems more ideal.
00:19:08.595 - 00:19:18.975, Speaker C: Do you see the social fi prediction market stuff playing out on like as a blank on Twitter like you mentioned earlier, or on like its own side app?
00:19:19.555 - 00:20:21.945, Speaker A: Yeah, you know, Blinks. I think they're struggling a little bit to get adoption from what I've seen, which, which is to be, I think expected anytime you introduce something like this, which is relatively new, like it's a new primitive, didn't exist before. That's going to require an insane shit ton of go to market marketing repetition and just keep drilling into the head of the user that hey, you need this. And so yeah, I think that could be one. I think though its own app also makes sense. Like I do think there is because people love. Like if you look at Twitter for example, One of the things I noticed about Twitter is that it's a lot of people saying a lot of shit about what they think will happen with a lot of certainty, like, you know, L1 races over Ethereum 1 or like, you know, the only way to build a company is this.
00:20:21.945 - 00:21:27.505, Speaker A: Like, people just make, basically, if I refactor the common thread there just, they just make a lot of statements with a lot of confidence and it's like, okay, why don't you back that up with some money? And I think that'd be interesting. So I think there's some intersection of social and prediction markets that is not super explored yet that I think think could be huge. But you know, like, if I could just bet on sports, that's also okay with me. I just want to bet. Or, or actually one thing that'd be interesting is betting on companies like, you know, will X beat earnings? Or like will Jupiter's fees be this? Will Ethereum surpass Solana index volume? I think that could be interesting because that actually does the thing that the politicians were worried about, which is then you get people in the ecosystems trying to get those outcomes by doing weird shit. So, yeah, I don't know, I'm kind of a noob at these things, but I think it'd be cool to bet on random social shit.
00:21:27.845 - 00:22:04.497, Speaker C: Yeah, I think too, as far as blinks and their adoption, like, I think a big thing is just the mobile, the lack of mobile integration because even with, I mean, I don't do sports betting, but friends of mine who do, it's on their phone that's kind of, you know, you're on your phone watching the game on TV and you're betting. And I think like, if blinks were to take off as a prediction market X integration, it would have to, you know, be on mobile predominantly. That's just my guess. Although I'm a laptop Twitter user, I think it's way more fun on the laptop even if I'm at home. But that's just me.

00:23:16.611 - 00:24:12.385, Speaker C: Yeah, kind of the big story of the past week. A great investigation by Sam Kessler and Danny Nelson over at CoinDesk into Eigenlayer, reportedly pressuring an associated project to airdrop tokens to a list of wallets that belong to its employees. I'm just going to go through the bullets on this article real quick and then we'll just dive into initial takeaways. So Eigen Labs, which is the developer behind Eigenlayer, gave a list of wallet addresses to ecosystem projects. Some of these projects said they asked Eigen Labs for the list. I think Etherfi was one of them as like a thank you. But one that CoinDesk spoke to said that they didn't ask for the list and they felt like there would be negative repercussions if they didn't make an airdrop to Eigen Labs employees.
00:24:12.385 - 00:24:36.235, Speaker C: This obviously, you know, raises some conflict of interest concerns. Eigen Labs and the Eigen foundation have now banned payouts to employees, but it nonetheless is raising a lot of interesting questions about just the state of airdrops, I guess. Mert, when you saw this story and in the I guess week now since, what's been your takeaway? What's been your reaction?
00:24:37.695 - 00:25:33.037, Speaker A: So, a few things. First, I want to be clear that I don't know the truth myself. So I'm speculating on the opinions put forward and just assuming they're true, or maybe assuming they're not, depending on the picture I'm painting. But so if it's the case that people that they work with did not ask or insinuate anything like we're going to airdrop people or your wallets any tokens, but then they just sent you this random list and they were kind of like eh, it would be cool if you guys gave us like an airdrop. And then I think the quote I saw in the article was something like the guys felt pressured to do it because their business relies on eigenlayer and so if they didn't their business basically wouldn't work. I mean that's extortion or at least it's definitely close to it. So I don't.
00:25:33.037 - 00:26:23.211, Speaker A: That would be bad. Like it's, it seems like that's the picture that the article is painting but I haven't seen any super clear evidence of that. So it's hard to reason about these things because you know, one side might just be, let's think like a hurt party. Now if they could get like 5, 6, 7, some sort of meaningful numbers of people who said the same, like the exact same story, that would be different. But I think you know, most of these things I think the way I think is always I blame things on incompetence as opposed to malice. I think people like maybe it was like a project manager or something was like just stupid and was just like getting greedy or something. But like probably like Sriram just did not even.
00:26:23.211 - 00:27:07.165, Speaker A: He probably has no idea what was going on or something. So I, I like blaming things on incompetence because it's generally more accurate than pure malice or pure greed. That being said, it also shows you, let's say my rant that I outlined a few weeks ago now about what's wrong with crypto or like what's the main problem with crypto which is incentives. And so consider these two scenarios. One is you work on a super difficult web two startup. Let's say it's like SpaceX and you're working your ass off every single day. You're going to work, you're working 18 hours, you're actually changing the world in a sense.
00:27:07.165 - 00:28:09.855, Speaker A: But you're not getting, let's say you're not really making much money. Like you get a salary and you get equity. That company is never going to go public or anything like that. Or they might wait later in the future. But basically you're just making money through hard work in making an impact on the company's bottom line. Okay, in crypto let's contrast to the eigenlayer case in the assuming that they were airdropped, you joined a company which does not have a product yet, which it's questionable whether it actually solves a problem even that's raised hundreds of millions of dollars that has the ethereum foundation as advisors, and you're getting money dropped to you from the air while the product is still not live. And so then it's like, okay, if those are the incentives, then maybe is it so questionable or weird that we don't have great apps in crypto? It's because it's totally misaligned.
00:28:09.855 - 00:29:38.355, Speaker A: And then when they launch it, they're still going to get the token and then get a huge payout again. And so what you have is you have people who've become millionaires by doing unclear if they've solved a problem that has actually made a meaningful change in a market. Oh, and don't get me started on every single startup that has now spun up as a downstream consumer of eigenlayer. Right? It's like, oh, well, if Eigenlayer succeeds, then we can use it to do this decentralized system. And it's like, okay, a problem that wasn't a solution, that wasn't solving any problem, now leading to another solution that was also not solving a problem conditional on that. And so that was really my main takeaway from it, is that, look, even if the extortion stuff isn't true, which there's always some part of truth, some part of exaggeration on those things, even if that weren't the case, it still does show to me the biggest problem in crypto, which I don't think is going to be solved anytime soon, which is just perverse incentives and these people getting ridiculously rich for not, let's say, I don't want to say deserving, because that's a structure, I'll use it for not deserving it from the market. Right.
00:29:38.475 - 00:30:41.765, Speaker C: So, anyway, yeah, I'm glad you bring that up, Mert, because I think that was the reason I was happy when this story came out, is I just think there needs to be more coming to light about how TGEs and these token launches kind of work. Because it's felt to me like for a while, airdrops and token launches have been a pretty nakedly bad thing. Like, it's not a new conversation, I guess I'll say. And obviously if eigenlayer is pressuring, pressuring or, you know, carrying out extortion like, like you're suggesting could be happening, that, you know, that crosses a line. But even if they're not, I think there's so many token airdrops happening all the time, and it just raises this question of why. And in large part, I think it's that, you know, teams building these companies and investors are seeing that they can create really quick paper returns and that's short sighted thinking. It's not good for the businesses.
00:30:41.765 - 00:31:52.061, Speaker C: You know this, this debate about low float high FDV tokens which I think boils down to people are being asked, being airdropped or you know, encouraged to buy into tokens that have no chance of viability long term speaks to like a larger issue which is that I don't know, there's maybe a lot of these tokens don't need to exist that are coming out. They don't really serve a purpose. Especially if you want to claim that the tokens aren't securities and shouldn't be regulated like that. So there's no expectation of profit or anything. Yeah, I think the reality is we live in a world where bitcoin mining stocks and coinbase are like a select few crypto companies that have ever ICO ed. And for like VCs it's probably hard to report returns on your crypto investments especially with the current regulatory environment. And so you do a TGE, you can you know, report back to your LPs that you made these big returns on paper but there's no such thing as at some point someone is left holding the bag.
00:31:52.061 - 00:32:01.125, Speaker C: I don't know, I guess sort of to broaden the conversation maybe Mert, like do you think we need fewer tokens launching?
00:32:01.245 - 00:32:59.107, Speaker A: I don't think we need fewer tokens but I would say we like I'm never, you gotta be careful with these things. But I'm never on the side of making something more scarce because I more of an accelerationist. But the only way more tokens is going to work is if there are more real businesses or more sustainable economies to begin with. One of my criticisms, let's say of DeFi so far has been that it kind of resembles the Toronto economy. To me having not liked Toronto a lot and basically the reason I say that is because Toronto, if you look at like downtown it's all banks and then there's some real estate and that's about it. And those are the richest people and the biggest companies. Now the problem is that's not an economy.
00:32:59.107 - 00:34:03.849, Speaker A: Right. An economy is you need to produce things. You need some productive output, like maybe it's oil or maybe it's, I don't know, wool or tech like Silicon Valley. You need to produce these things and then once the things, the goods and the, let's say assets are produced then you need this system for actually financializing it, making more efficient commerce, trade, et cetera. And then it makes sense and then now you have this two sided thing. But currently crypto and not all of it by the way, like there are some like stable coins and some RWAs, but the vast majority of it is kind of circularly traded things on smart contracts that are meant to swap things basically. And so one of the things that's going to be a make or break thing for crypto is whether it can actually achieve economic let's say output or creation.
00:34:03.849 - 00:35:23.845, Speaker A: I think depend is the only example of this I've seen so far and which is why I always bring it up. I'm such a huge fan like because people are creating value like let's say mapping stuff in the world or distributing Internet and getting paid for it on chain and so there's real value being created and then that value can be let's say whatever financialized or something like that with defi. But I don't think it's so much that we need less tokens or fewer tokens as much as we need to seriously think hard about generating more real businesses. And I think again the problem is it comes down to the incentives of there's the incentives to create a new business or a useful business are just not the same as traditional models which have shown better results like the Web2 model let's say. And that doesn't seem like it's going to change anytime. And so it seems like to me one of my opinions here is that the only way this changes is if you have irrational people. So founders who are just like yeah, like I don't really care that much about making a few million dollars right now.
00:35:23.845 - 00:36:19.345, Speaker A: What I care about is having this self sustaining protocol that'll actually create in change in the world and it doesn't matter if it takes 10 years and all my friends get rich in the way. I'm so autistic, let's say irrational that I will persevere through it. And there's been like a few kind of like that I think but it's quite rare. And then the other thing of course is that crypto markets reward being familiar in consensus rather than being contrarian in everywhere except like actually spot prices. So like if you were contrary on Seoul, you would have made a lot of money let's say when it was at $8. But let's say if it's a business that's contrarian, you are not going to make that much money as opposed to if it's a consensus bet and you just do an airdrop. Right? That's just kind of how it works.
00:36:19.345 - 00:37:08.305, Speaker A: And it also maybe goes back to the earlier point, if you, if you think about it a bit wider, of prediction markets not determining truth, but converging on truth, which is that markets are kind of a tool for convergence. And so, yeah, the TLDR is. There's certainly doesn't need to be fewer tokens in my view because I, I don't ever believe in making stuff more scarce for, for its own sake. I think there needs to be some something changed to change with the incentives of crypto, where builders are actually building real businesses that use crypto rails to improve their businesses as opposed to starting from a tech stack and a token and then be like, you know, what's the best way I can sell this to other people and get a bigger bag? Like, that's just not productive.
00:37:09.525 - 00:37:58.555, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, point taken. Defi is just Canada. But I do like, I think there's, I still do think there's a case to be made that token airdrops do more harm than good. You know, time after time, the token users end up really pissed because the airdrop wasn't as big as they wanted. It creates a lot of, you know, enemy between with the founders and people using the project. And I think you could make the argument that you end up with VCs now that have an exit and employees at your startup that like, have an exit, they can, they can dump these tokens. I mean, I'm sure they're subject to lockups and things, but whenever the vesting period ends, they can, you know, have a way out.
00:37:58.555 - 00:38:37.693, Speaker C: And I wonder if it just makes you less disciplined as a startup, right? Like, why solve a problem if you can just do a TGE and bam. You have already made a ton of money off of your company. So I'm still a bit on the side of like, just don't do them. They do more harm than good, arguably. But I'm sure this is a debate. We'll have much more down the line as well because this trend is not showing signs of stopping. I want to get into another news story that I thought didn't garner as much attention as it maybe should have regarding payments.
00:38:37.693 - 00:39:32.689, Speaker C: So this is according to Bloomberg reporting from last week. I believe that Apple is going to begin letting third parties use the iPhone's payment chip to handle transactions, which means that banks and other sorts of services can now compete with Apple Pay, use the kind of NFC chip technology to, you know, do payments using the iPhone. And the person that brought this to my attention was the Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, who tweeted you know, usdc, Tap to pay. Coming soon. The move followed pressure from regulators, which things Apple does that are, you know, allows competitors to build on the iPhone. That tends to be what happens. Developers will have to pay associated fees and enter a commercial agreement with Apple.
00:39:32.689 - 00:40:20.775, Speaker C: So I'm guessing if you put USDC into Tap to pay, you'll have to, I don't know, pay some kind of transaction fee to Apple when people use it. But one big piece of the article that I found very interesting is users will soon be able to set a third party as the default payment system replacing Apple Pay. So if you have an iPhone and you double tap and Apple Pay comes up, you could have your USDC wallet come up as the default. Instead. There's more than a billion iPhone users and now payments are going to be broader than just Apple Pay. So I guess, Mert, let me pose to you, is this the type of thing that payments on Solana need? And in order to catch on in a more mainstream way.
00:40:23.275 - 00:40:51.887, Speaker A: I think these are necessary but insufficient solutions. So what I mean by that is I think it's obviously a net good that this is possible now or this will be possible potentially. That's obviously good. Like nobody would debate that. But it's unclear to me whether that's the thing that actually helps adoption. I think it's a very complex equation. But like, basically what you need is.
00:40:51.887 - 00:41:14.937, Speaker A: Okay, so first of all, you need the person to have usdc. Okay, how are they going to have usdc? Well, one, they need to either get paid in it or they need to earn it. Let's say via Deepin or something. Or they need to have USD and then go into your. Some other coin and then swap into it. So there's three different ways there. I'm not sure which one's gonna be the most dominant.
00:41:14.937 - 00:41:35.273, Speaker A: Okay, once they do that, they need to find someone who accepts it. Right? So let's say they. It's. Let's say the common thread is accepting Apple Pay. Okay. And like, first of all, I don't know what the details there are, I didn't read the article. But let's say it's just Apple Pay and then there's some abstraction.
00:41:35.273 - 00:42:17.935, Speaker A: Okay, so now you do usdc and it's like, okay, what happens on the back end there? Does it get converted back into something else? Because if the contract that they're accepting is Apple Pay, do they also need to accept, you know, USDC specifically? Like, what does this look like on the merchant side? Okay, so there's that problem and Then there's like, okay, does the merchant have a need to accept usdc? Okay, so that's, that's another problem. Once they get it, what are they going to do with it? And then it's the same problem again. And so I think it's like a very difficult problem because there's so many sides to it and it's unclear which one comes first.
00:42:19.115 - 00:43:11.583, Speaker C: Yeah, it, it's true. I think the, maybe the, the like, hope for people building payment stuff is just like how extractive credit card companies kind of are. I think something I hadn't really thought of until I, you know, started reporting on Solana. And just thinking about payments more often is, you know, credit cards charge somewhere between 1 and a half to 3 and a half percent from merchants on all transactions. And that's just passed along to consumers. But that's like a really like large chunk for, for every payment that ever happens. Like all merchants now essentially have to accept credit cards and sometimes they, you know, will charge you an extra fee or they won't accept credit card under a certain transaction size.
00:43:11.583 - 00:43:41.083, Speaker C: But like one and a half to three and a half percent is really big. And that just, that seems like there's an opportunity there to undercut credit cards on the fees that you can charge. Obviously credit cards have these integrations with airlines that are very lucrative. Consumers really like them. But it's like, man, you know, and yes, as you mentioned, like, on ramp, off ramp is a problem. The merchant probably doesn't want crypto. They probably want Fiat so they can, you know, buy groceries and things like that.
00:43:41.083 - 00:43:44.935, Speaker C: But, you know, I think.
00:43:45.275 - 00:44:39.555, Speaker A: Yeah, sorry, the one thing that's, I just remembered. So when we launched Helios, my company, we were actually the only dev platform accepting USDC at launch. And that actually ended up being quite useful because there's a lot of developers who already had crypto and wanted to pay in it. And it was like an easier experience because you're not to do the whole stripe, like fill out your billing address, fill out this, fill out this. And so that was like a, that was like a better ux. So like, there are certain interesting cases, maybe it's like E commerce, where it's generally a bit more streamlined. But I think like you said, with the airlines and stuff, the US or the west, credit cards are so well thought out and like, look, they can kind of just reduce their fees if they feel threatened enough.
00:44:39.555 - 00:45:39.355, Speaker A: But like, they have so many things, like you get free lounges, free this, free that, insurance, downside protection, this app that comes with it integrations. And it's just very hard to compete to the point where I would say like probably where you'll see payments succeed first will be just international, like one of these other kind. Like if I go to Turkey, then I would probably be much more interested in paying in crypto or even accepting crypto if I was a merchant than if I were in New York. There's just different problems for the different parts of the world. So I think payments still needs to be fundamentally from emerging markets driven. And then of course the other part of this is privacy where you make a transaction on the chain and people see it and it's just much easier to track even with credit cards. Obviously that's the case, but at least in that case it's only the credit card company, let's say.
00:45:39.355 - 00:46:33.925, Speaker A: But in this case it could actually just be whoever has access to this chain, which is everybody. So I think my takes on payments have evolved over time, but I think the useful cases won't be things like tap to pay unless emerging markets like Latam or Turkey and stuff employ those as well. I don't know what the rollout looks like globally, but it's going to be that plus E commerce. And I think much more importantly, and this is a dark horse, it's going to be private money, like actually private payments. I was with Zuko recently, the founder of zcash in the uk and he was showing me like a few demos and some ideas he had for it. And like, I think that's like fundamentally still one of the things that crypto needs to tackle that I think would be super impactful. Like we actually don't have digital cash, right? We have digital traceable money.
00:46:33.925 - 00:46:54.525, Speaker A: But like if I do a cash transaction, I don't want people to know about it, which I think is my right. Like I don't understand why people need to know what the fuck I'm doing with my own money. I can't do that in a blockchain other than, well I can use zcash, which has its own problems for now like scalability. But like I feel like I should be able to do that and I just can't really do it. And I think that needs to be solved.
00:46:55.025 - 00:47:31.107, Speaker C: I read an interesting article a little while ago in like a German magazine about how the German sort of right wing party, one of their issues is the right to use cash because a lot of places are just don't accept cash at all anymore. So like if you want to get on a bus and pay cash, they Won't let you have to use your bus card or, I don't know, a credit card or something. And, like, it just. I didn't. I personally don't have much of a preference for, like, private money. I don't really care. But, you know, for a lot of people, like, the only truly anonymous way to transact is with cash.
00:47:31.107 - 00:47:51.055, Speaker C: And that's sort of, you know, you can chalk it up to, like, this is. In a democracy, I should have the right to transact without being traced where the money's going, and that's what cash provides. So I haven't thought deeply about private money, but that's an interesting. Interesting one as well. Yeah, I think. Go ahead, Bert.
00:47:51.635 - 00:48:21.501, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I mean, I just. It just makes me angry. Like, I don't. I don't see why there needs to be some father figure that needs to know what I'm doing with my money. Like, it just feels like it shouldn't be there and that it has much more leverage for one side than the other side. And it's like a weird power dynamic. And it's like, I don't, like, okay, as a kid, fine, like, you're under supervision of your parents, whatever, Obviously, then it's like, it's an interesting dynamic.
00:48:21.501 - 00:48:40.031, Speaker A: But, like, why is the government watching what I do with my money? Like, shouldn't you have other things to worry about? Like, I don't understand. You already have laws like, don't do crime, and so if I do crime, you can arrest me, but, like, why do you have to see how much I'm spending on subway? Like, I don't understand this. It just feels weird.
00:48:40.173 - 00:49:36.983, Speaker C: It's sort of like the eternal question with privacy stuff. And Ryan Connors, a researcher at Blockworks, and I have chatted with him informally about this, but it's like, do consumers have a demonstrated preference for privacy? Does anyone actually care about these sorts of things? Because I think if you ask people, they're like, yeah, I'd rather not have my data be farmed and sold to third parties or things like that. But then you'll have these huge data breaches at, like, Microsoft or something, and nobody really pays attention or switches the search engine they're using or where their passwords are stored or whatever. Like, I just wonder if it's one of those things that ideologically you can get there of. Like, yeah, like, the government shouldn't know where my money is. But are consumers actually going to have a real. Lately, is there a real market for private money aside from people who are just Committing crimes.
00:49:36.983 - 00:49:38.031, Speaker C: I don't know.
00:49:38.223 - 00:50:12.497, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think the market is very big. So I would say most people don't care. And about privacy, like, they just won't. And that's been kind of the challenge as well, like with the markets or startup builders in these markets. But you could also say the same thing about decentralization rights, which is like, have people shown they actually care about decentralization? It's like, not really, but I don't think that means that decentralization doesn't matter. It's more like. It's more like this where you go on Amazon and you expect it to be up.
00:50:12.497 - 00:50:43.641, Speaker A: And so there's like a. This expected outcome, like, or property of the system that makes it up. And if it's decentralized, it's kind of the same thing, which is like, okay, you want to make the system more resilient in catastrophic failure. And privacy is not quite the same, but it's along the same lines of like, if something happens, you're going to want. Like if you're. For example, it's like the states has, I forget, I don't know my amendments, but like you have the right to bear arms or something in certain states. Right?
00:50:43.673 - 00:50:44.273, Speaker C: Second Amendment.
00:50:44.329 - 00:51:09.377, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And it's like, well, how many people really care about that right? Like, I don't know. Certainly nobody in Canada cares. And they're like just a few kind of miles north. And I think it's kind of the same, which is like, I should have the right. For the very few people that do want it, they should have that right now. You don't have to use that.
00:51:09.377 - 00:51:42.905, Speaker A: Right. Like, you don't have to go and get a gun and start shooting around or something, or just have it in your thing. Closet. But like, some people think it's a fundamental right. And I think so. Talab has this thing called the minority rule, which is in a population, the sample size with the most kind of intolerant, let's say, preferences will get their way. So one of the things is like halal or kosher or peanut butter allergies and stuff.
00:51:42.905 - 00:52:21.597, Speaker A: It's like you go to any restaurant in the west, they ask you where your allergies are and the prevalence of allergies somewhere else in the world is actually quite little. But it's like, it's still. Because what happens if somebody gets an anaphylactic shock is such a bad outcome that they're like, okay, this is a rule that's worth implementing here. Or a common, let's say And I think privacy, like if you squint a little bit, I don't think it's quite the same, but I think it could finally follow the same path where it's like it is, it could be a right for some sort of societies or cultures. So anyway, I'll stop there.
00:52:21.621 - 00:53:11.035, Speaker C: Yeah. It seems like time after time though, in the history of crypto you have these sort of privacy focused currencies or pieces of infrastructure and then they get hit with regulation because they become really popular among criminals. And I think that's an unavoidable thing you have to reckon with if you're building something like zcash. I mean, I'm thinking about like Tornado Cash. There were, I guess, reasons you would want to use Tornado Cash, but as a non criminal. But also like the DPRK really liked it because they could carry out a huge crypto hack and then move the funds around. So it's a politically difficult thing because the government doesn't like pieces of infrastructure that make crimes more easy to commit.
00:53:11.035 - 00:53:35.857, Speaker C: And I guess it comes down to like, do you. Is it the value of the minority of people to transact privately or is it such a threat to the public that you can't, you know, North Korea can hack a crypto bridge and make off with the fund successfully? That that right is, you know, going to be ignored in this circumstance. It's an interesting question.
00:53:35.881 - 00:53:55.285, Speaker A: Well, they do that anyway, like Korea as I think Zach did a thread on this where it's like there's like this team of Korean developers, North Korean developers that's on like 30 teams or something. There's. I don't even know how they do that. But anyway, yeah, I won't get any.
00:53:55.825 - 00:54:02.969, Speaker C: Have you had any North Korean people interview for jobs at Helios? I've heard this is a thing in crypto today.
00:54:03.017 - 00:54:29.883, Speaker A: I had. So when I used to screen. So now we work with recruiters that when I screen myself, I had some very suspicious GitHub profiles. But the thing that saved me is that the way I hire is you need to be an extremely, I won't say extremely good, but you need to be a very competent writer. And these people have broken English almost always. And so I would always just filter them out. I don't give a shit how talented you are.
00:54:29.883 - 00:54:36.695, Speaker A: If you can't write, I'm not going to hire you. And that was a good enough filter that we never got anything like that.
00:54:37.515 - 00:54:51.795, Speaker C: North Korean developers, if you're watching, don't apply to Helios. You won't make it through. But, like, that's. That's all the time we have. I have to go write a newsletter. But, Mert, it's been a good time. Glad we got to walk through this.
00:54:51.795 - 00:54:53.335, Speaker C: I'll see you next week, man.
00:54:53.635 - 00:54:55.595, Speaker A: Yes, sir. Thanks for watching, everybody.
