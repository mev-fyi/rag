00:00:20.690 - 00:00:31.254, Speaker B: What's up, everybody? Welcome to another episode of Livespeed. Today we're joined by Nick Carter, the gym partner at VC firm Castle Island Ventures. Nick Carter is an OG in the crypto industry. Nick, welcome to the show.
00:00:31.372 - 00:00:33.254, Speaker C: Thanks for having me. Excited to be here.
00:00:33.372 - 00:01:07.934, Speaker B: Yeah, pumped to have you on. Nate. One thing I want to talk about, because I've been listening to your show and you talk about stablecoins a lot, which I think a lot of people would argue is maybe the only product market fit that we have found in crypto, maybe outside of, like, Bitcoin as a store of value. I heard you on the Bankless podcast. This is way back in 2020 talking about stablecoins, and is that going to be a threat to ethereum? And if you fast forward to today, stablecoins are now 10% of crypto's total market cap, and I think it makes up about 75% of the dollar volume that goes on in crypto. So a lot of crypto is just moving around dollars. So I'm curious, Nick, what's your current thesis and thoughts on stablecoins?
00:01:08.062 - 00:01:09.822, Speaker C: Where'd you get that data from? Garrett?
00:01:09.886 - 00:01:11.620, Speaker B: I stole it directly from you.
00:01:12.470 - 00:01:56.782, Speaker C: I was about to be like, well, hang on. Did somebody else also figure that, well, give or take, let's say 70%? But yeah, I've wrote a white paper on stablecoins in 2020 where I called them crypto dollars, but nobody liked that. And at that point, I ran the data. This is on chain transaction volume, not exchange. As a caveat, actually, the ratio of exchange volume is higher for stable coins, and at that point, it was 30%. So stables were small, but they were doing 30% of sort of the global market share of on chain transaction value between Bitcoin, ETH and other L ones. Today, it's 70 ish plus percent, which is remarkable.
00:01:56.782 - 00:02:36.862, Speaker C: So basically, crypto became dollarized. People haven't even realized it yet. It kind of makes sense that you wouldn't use the native assets as a collateral type or to settle transactions, because it doesn't really make sense to do. I mean, you want stable value in your smart contracts if they have a long duration, and if you're even using it as a bridge currency or something like that. If you're going fiat, crypto fiat, you want something that's stable on the inside, and you don't want to incur capital gains tax liability whenever you transact. Right. Unfortunately, in the US.
00:02:36.862 - 00:03:03.590, Speaker C: That's actually how the dollar's preeminence is maintained, is the dollar is kind of carved out. So if you hold dollars and it appreciates that's unlikely to happen. Let's say it did. So you sort of won in real terms. You're not owing tax on the difference on the delta there. If you're holding a foreign currency or commodity or something else, you are on the hook for capital gains taxes. So something people don't realize.
00:03:03.590 - 00:03:23.666, Speaker C: Tax policy is one of the ways the preeminence of sovereign currencies are maintained. Not just because you need the dollar to extinguish your tax liability in the US. But because of this capital gains issue. And it's an accounting overhead, it's tax overhead. It's annoying. So people just use dollars now. And this is what happened in crypto.
00:03:23.666 - 00:03:58.700, Speaker C: It's remarkable. I think it was somewhat predictable, like there's this whole school of thought that payment tokens would win out, maybe Bitcoin would become the payment token, maybe Ripple would maybe stellar people really thought that was a thing that was wrong. Right. That's just not true. It's stablecoins and that's the world we live in. That's the direction we're going and people need to come to terms with that. Yes, Bitcoin and ETH are things people want to hold for long durations of time, but when it comes to intermediating transactions and holding stable value within smart contracts on chain, it's going to be dollars.
00:04:00.990 - 00:04:28.802, Speaker D: One thing I'm curious about is the crypto community maybe has some different perspectives on the types of stablecoins. So there was obviously the collapse of Terra and decentralized algo stablecoins and then there's things like USDC and whatnot, which work much better. But some people are concerned that they're obviously kind of centralized in a sense. How do you think about kind of the state of stablecoins and what would you like to see there?
00:04:28.936 - 00:05:08.554, Speaker C: Yeah, I was a big hater of Luna Terra. I'm on the record being a hater, so feel vindicated by that. I diligenced Basis, formerly known as base coin back when I worked at Fidelity and I sat down one afternoon and designed like 15 attacks on it and convinced myself that it wasn't going to work. And then I read about currency boards and things like that and I realized crypto people are just trying to do something that central bankers have done for decades. And there's actually a playbook there. If you want to maintain a peg, you want to maintain parity is you need convertibility. There's a saying which is no convertibility, no parity.
00:05:08.554 - 00:05:46.906, Speaker C: Luna didn't have that or UST didn't have that. It didn't have a credible organization backing the reserves, obviously. And it grew too large because of the artificial interest rate that they attached to it. So it was predictable, it was going to fail. Many people did. I don't think I have any particular special insight there in terms of the current cohort. I don't really buy the notion of a unless it's issued somehow, you're sterilizing the exchange risk of some native crypto asset and creating a dollar against that, which there are attempts to do this.
00:05:46.906 - 00:06:29.000, Speaker C: So I actually kind of do want to dig into that. So ETH collateralized, USD, stablecoins are some really interesting projects that are now emerging. So, synthetic dollars, unless that is the case, you're always going to be exposed to government policy as an issue of a stablecoin. And it's not good enough to be like, well, we're just not going to put a freeze and seize function in the contract that doesn't work, because if you have dollars in a bank somewhere and a government doesn't like what's going on, they're going to ask you to freeze them. You'll get a court order, and then if you're unable to do that, they'll just seize the reserves, the underlying reserves. Right. So this is something that Austin Campbell, who's one of my stablecoin gurus, says a lot.
00:06:29.000 - 00:07:07.714, Speaker C: You might as well put that function in the smart contract if you're Fiat backed, if you're backing the stablecoin with any real world assets that are exposed to governments, if you don't have it, you're not immune. So you are going to always need to have that. And you can still have a very successful, credible, functional system if you do have that. So I'm on the incrementalist side. I don't think you can go fully decentralized, at least not with the tools that exist today. It may be possible to issue a USD stablecoin in a capital efficient way against, let's say, ETH collateral. There's some interesting experiments there.
00:07:07.714 - 00:07:54.658, Speaker C: The fact that ETH has staking now makes it much more tractable. But, yeah, generally I think the fully Fiat backed model is the best one. And there's obviously an array of strategies there. I'm on the side of we should have a heterogeneity of issuers in a bunch of different jurisdictions with a bunch of different sort of quality of property rights attached to them, and then you can sort of pick your poison. That seems to be the direction we're going. Mostly offshore now, is where Fiat backed stables are going, but still dollar denominated and, yeah, the existing issuers, we can sort of run through them. I'm a bit of a Tether apologist, I would say.
00:07:54.658 - 00:08:51.302, Speaker C: I would say Tether is sort of not as bad as people think it is and there's sort of very good reasons for why people like Tether. So we can also dig into yeah, one thing to note there is, I advise this stablecoin ratings agency called Bluechip. So I'm hoping that there will be many more such things that emerge. Maybe it's blue chip maybe it's moody's maybe it's Standard and Poor's. Let's start to rate the stables and give regular folks the ability to, very quickly, at a glance, see what their credit exposure is to the stablecoin issuer, what their recourse in bankruptcy is. Is this bankruptcy remote? Is it held in a segregated trust and what jurisdiction it's issued in? What's the quality of the assets backing the thing? What's their liquidity and duration profile? And it seems like things are progressing in a really good direction there. So, overall, I'd say I'm actually pretty happy with the stablecoin space.
00:08:51.302 - 00:08:57.378, Speaker C: I think it's unfortunate that the US. Is chasing it. But yeah, pretty content with it overall.
00:08:57.474 - 00:09:14.266, Speaker B: Since you mentioned, know, at the end of their lifeline there, they added Bitcoin as that reserve currency almost behind it to save the system in times of stress. What did you think about that at the time? And is that something think you see as a future at all? I mean, it's a form of synthetic dollar being backed by Bitcoin.
00:09:14.298 - 00:09:14.542, Speaker C: Right.
00:09:14.596 - 00:09:18.606, Speaker B: Do you think that's really a feasible case for Bitcoin or you'd say that's a dead use case?
00:09:18.708 - 00:10:01.706, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I called for that in my 2020 white paper. I actually interviewed Doe Kwan as part of that process, and he told me that tarot was being used in Korea to buy household goods with Chai the app, if you remember. Turns out he was very much lying about that. That was later proven to be a gigantic lie. But I think his gambit with backing it with Bitcoin was an attempt to I can't even think of a good analogy here, but basically trying to bring down the whole crypto industry with him. So he wanted to make terra systemic. I think I said this at the time.
00:10:01.706 - 00:10:28.100, Speaker C: If you go and dig up my old tweets about it, I think he was trying to make the terra system as systemic as possible so that the industry felt compelled to backstop the token as they entered that time of crisis. I think that's actually what he was trying to do. So I'm kind of glad in a sense that it collapsed when it did. I obviously grew way too big, but it could have been much worse also. Like, he could have dragged down even more of the industry with him.
00:10:30.490 - 00:10:56.800, Speaker D: Just for our audience, some of who may be kind of unfamiliar or newer to crypto, there is a lot of controversy around USDT terra, which you just touched upon. So one, could you maybe talk about how you think maybe it has kind of an unwarranted rep? And two, I'm also curious on your thoughts on delta neutral stablecoins, so things like UXC or like the one that Arthur Hayes was mentioning as well.
00:10:57.170 - 00:11:39.882, Speaker C: Yeah, I think Athena, which is the brainchild of Arthur Hayes, is a fascinating product, and I think something like it will succeed, maybe Athena itself. So we'll start with that one. So the key idea here is that you can combine if you think back to the early BitMEX days, traders on BitMEX would sterilize their exposure, because I think bitcoin was the only collateral type for a long time. And so they would hold an offsetting short BTC position against their long BTC spot holdings, and that would create a synthetic dollar. Right. And generally speaking, you get paid for being short. Right.
00:11:39.882 - 00:12:21.782, Speaker C: So not always, but generally, yes. And so there were entrepreneurs as early as kind of 2018 17 that realized you could build a synthetic USD stablecoin. And we actually backed some of them. We invested in some projects like that, trying to create a USD stablecoin based on bitcoin collateral, and it didn't work. And the reason was, you're not always being paid for being short. Sometimes you have to pay for being short, at which point the carrying cost of the system gets significant, in particular in 2022, but other times, the volatility as well. So on its own it doesn't work very well to have a synthetic USD.
00:12:21.782 - 00:13:27.630, Speaker C: However, there is a crypto asset that pays you for being long now called ethereum. So I don't know, just recently I think the ethereum rate is sort of four and a half percent. I checked a month ago it's actually the exact same as the three month treasury 5.5% which I thought was very interesting. And so now if you have a portfolio of long spot staked ETH and short ETH futures you get paid in two ways and the yields are not really that correlated as far as I can tell, which is a great thing right. So I think based on the analysis I've seen, you can reliably maintain a synthetic USD position based on the long staked ETH spot position plus the short ETH future position and also have a yield on top of that, which you can keep and use to bolster your reserves and keep as a kind of insurance fund. Or you can pass along to holders in an interest bearing manner.
00:13:27.630 - 00:14:39.394, Speaker C: So I think that's going to be a very attractive product for a lot of people that the alternative would be a tokenized treasury, basically a stablecoin that passes along treasury yields, which I do think is very interesting and we're backing projects like that. But I think people will really find it attractive to have a USD position where the value of that actually accretes to ether itself. And maybe in the future bitcoin too. Like you could imagine a portfolio of both ether and bitcoin as the underlying collateral there, especially because the funding rights for ether and bitcoin are not identical. So I think that's an incredible innovation which is mainly facilitated by virtue of the fact that ETH staking works now and the entire carry trade with ETH can be carried out now you can borrow dollars, buy ETH, get exposure and close out that position the whole cycle can be completed right so that's a great innovation. I think this is the subject of my talk at token 2049 and probably Missari Main net too, so you'll hear a more fleshed out version of this in the future. But I think that'll be successful.
00:14:39.394 - 00:15:17.886, Speaker C: And I think you'll see this come to occupy at least 20% of stablecoin aggregate market cap synthetic USD stables, which has never been the case. I mean you could say Die is a synthetic USD stable but mainly Die is a kind of USDC front end and then the other question was about Tether tether I think is unfairly maligned and I've been tangling with the tether truth ers for like six years now. And I'd like them to introspect and acknowledge that they have been wrong. Maybe they were right, that it was sketchy, but they were wrong. That it was going to fail. Maybe it will fail. But if it does fail, it's not systemic.
00:15:17.886 - 00:16:00.030, Speaker C: I think the theory that it was completely unbacked is false. The fact that they have tether themselves have done some sketchy things is not part of the tether business model. It's sort of by design and I would say it's a feature, not a bug actually. So the fact that they're running around the world trying to find banking, trying to find partners that are going to do business with them, payment processors, that's because they're offshore, right? That's because they are meant to be somewhat immune from US government. So they're trying to be remote from the US government apparatus. Right? Because of that they're being chased around. Their bank partners are being pressured to shut them down.
00:16:00.030 - 00:16:39.274, Speaker C: Then they historically have had to go find unsavory partners, right? Like crypto capital back in the day stole 800 million from them or something. Ridiculous. That's when Bitfinex commingled their reserves with tether and extended them a kind of Ursats loan. So that was questionable. But that happened because they were offshore and trying to be as remote from the US as possible. So if you think of Tether as kind of an unregulated global shadow bank, it kind of makes sense that they keep running into these problems. But then the reason that that's worth it for them is because the tether holders themselves find value in that.
00:16:39.274 - 00:17:11.874, Speaker C: They like tether for that exact reason, because it's perceived as being more offshore than a USDC for instance. And if you look at recent data like you see with Operation Choke .2.0 in the US as that happened in March, it really accelerated. People fled USDC for tether. They found a safe haven in Know. They felt that it was a place where their value would be secure and they would be more immune from US government provocation. So that's kind of the point of tether.
00:17:11.874 - 00:17:49.362, Speaker C: So people always wonder why does anyone use tether if they've been so sketchy? I could never see myself using it. Well, it's because these people are operating from the mindset of being integrated into US financial markets. And if you're not, then you can see why you might want to be a little bit more remote from US financial regulators. It makes sense, especially as financial policy in this country became super interventionist. They started freezing Russia's reserves. They're getting really aggressive with the crypto industry, cutting them off from the banking system here. So it makes sense.
00:17:49.362 - 00:18:08.390, Speaker C: So I'm not saying Tether is never going to fail. I don't think it'll last another three years, actually. I do think eventually it'll be unwound. But I am saying it makes sense to me why someone would want to use Tether if they're in a particular type of circumstance. And to be clear, that's not me. I don't use tether. I use USDC.
00:18:08.390 - 00:18:18.854, Speaker C: If I'm settling a transaction, which we do at our fund, and we're making an investment with Stablecoins. But, yeah, I can understand why someone would use Tether.
00:18:18.982 - 00:18:25.406, Speaker B: Nick, I wanted you to double down on that. Why did you say you think Tether will be unwound? What would cause that?
00:18:25.588 - 00:19:04.010, Speaker C: Yeah, so they've existed since, what, 2015, but meaningfully multibillion since, say, 2018. I think eventually they'll hit the end of the road. And I think the US. Ultimately does have an enforcement arm that reaches globally. So if they really want to get them, they'll be able to. I don't think it's going to be a catastrophic thing. It'll just mean that there'll be some sort of net settlement, sort of aggregate global settlement, where if you are a real institution, you can pass KYC, then you can withdraw your sort of parada share of the underlying reserves.
00:19:04.010 - 00:19:58.730, Speaker C: But, yeah, I think as the crypto industry sort of legitimizes itself, you're ultimately going to see these global offshore shadow banks like Binance and Tether ultimately marginalized, right. Especially if, let's say, USDC or an onshore Stablecoin gets a kind of regulatory baptism, a blessing. Let's say there's a Stablecoin bill, then I think at that point, there's a lot of political will to go after the competitors that are perceived as cheating or not operating on the level playing field. But I think it's solely a question of political will. The Tether system itself appears to be fairly stable, frankly, but ultimately, given that they have a long history of being pretty insolubrious, I think they'll be chased down eventually, but I don't think it's catastrophic.
00:20:00.670 - 00:20:22.418, Speaker D: So, talking about politics, a lot of people might have seen talks about the Stablecoin Act and Stablecoin regulation in the US. Especially right now. You probably are more familiar with that than anybody, and especially are more articulate. Could you maybe just walk us through what's going on there? What is the state of the Stablecoin Act and how do you see it going?
00:20:22.584 - 00:20:53.562, Speaker C: Yeah, the State of the Union, as far as it pertains to Stablecoins in the US. Is poor. In January, Custodia, which was a bank registered in Wyoming, they were trying to issue Stablecoins and they were trying to get connectivity to the Federal Reserve. They were stonewalled. The Fed didn't grant them a master account. They are operational. I don't exactly know how, but they were basically walled off from that exclusive club.
00:20:53.562 - 00:22:01.140, Speaker C: And there is an open constitutional question as to whether the Fed should even be allowed to do that, to exercise that kind of discretion. There's a good paper from Professor Julie Hill covering this. Does the Fed constitutionally have the right to say no to a bank that is satisfying all of the other criteria? And ultimately, I think it'll go to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court will say these master accounts are a shall issue function from the Fed, not a may issue. So we'll see what happens there. But either way, that was pretty devastating for folks trying to issue stablecoins onshore from the bank construct. Then also in January of this year, the Fed said banks shouldn't touch stablecoins, period effectively. So they de facto banned banks from engaging with stablecoin, which was pretty bad because this has led to a lot of entities like for instance, BNY Mellon not being able to really advance any of their plans in the US.
00:22:01.140 - 00:22:55.090, Speaker C: Other issuers still can. So that's why you have Circle, but they're issuing it under the state by state MTL licenses, which isn't really fit for purpose. It would be better if there know the Fintech charter at the OCC which Brian Brooks had proposed under Trump or dedicated federal legislation laying out how stablecoin issuers can operate. We don't have actually just recently, earlier this month, the Fed kind of reiterated their view that banks really shouldn't touch stablecoins in any way. So the Fed said, okay, well, if you're a bank and you want to deal with stablecoins, you're going to have to explicitly ask us for permission proactively and we're going to have to give you a letter saying yes, you can do this. So it's kind of like the Fed's basically saying, here's the process, go ahead, give it a shot. Obviously we're going to say no, but yeah, there's like a way to do it.
00:22:55.090 - 00:23:29.146, Speaker C: Of course there isn't. The other thing that they keep saying is, well, you need to be able to characterize all the users of the stablecoin, which is a paradox, right. Because as an issuer of a stablecoin on a public blockchain, you don't know who is transacting in those secondary transactions on chain. You don't know who has the wallet, the thousandth wallet on Tron that's moving around a unit of Tether, right? You just don't know. You do know who's creating and redeeming the stablecoin. So that's the whole sort of stablecoin construct. It's what some people called permissioned pseudonymity.
00:23:29.146 - 00:24:20.410, Speaker C: So there's an element of permissioning at the ingress and exit layer where you have fiat moving into the system and funds from the system moving back into the fiat that part's permission. But then the secondary transactions where the bulk of the activity happens, you as the issuer don't really know who those people are. And that's the way cash works. Also think about cash, right. You go to the ATM, you go to the bank teller and you withdraw some cash, they know who you are, right? But when you then go and use that cash at the grocery store or you tip your valet, nobody is being informed about that, right? So the bulk of the cash transactions happening on a P to P basis are not being surveilled. So you might think to yourself, well, okay, so this is identical to the cash system. Why isn't it allowed? Well, because financial policy in this country is insane.
00:24:20.410 - 00:24:43.560, Speaker C: So unfortunately, the Fed has disallowed effectively the orthodox stablecoin model as far as banks are concerned. And so I would say it's really bleak in the US. Now. There is a stablecoin bill that's moving through Congress. I think it might have advanced committee. I'm not 100% sure. That might be the other bill.
00:24:43.560 - 00:25:16.100, Speaker C: I'm pretty bearish on its prospects to actually be passed because the Senate is Democratic controlled and of course we have a Democratic president, and so I would be really surprised if it passed. Of course things can change. We have an election next year. Maybe it'll be two Republican houses. At that point, who knows what's going to happen with the presidential election? No idea. So things can certainly change. But as of right now, the system is not set up to encourage onshore stablecoin innovation at all.
00:25:16.100 - 00:25:56.698, Speaker C: It's set up explicitly to discourage it. Stablecoin issuers themselves have been the targets of regulatory attacks. Like Paxos was targeted. They're the ones that are issuing the stablecoin with PayPal now. They were the target of huge attacks around the time of the BSD wind down. The other thing I'll just mention last here is for stablecoins to really work, you need corresponding real time fiat clearing and settlement to occur, especially outside of business hours. And the networks that did this were the Sen network at Silvergate and Signet powered by Signature.
00:25:56.698 - 00:26:37.930, Speaker C: And what those allowed was the creation and redemption of stablecoins outside of banking hours. If you think about banking hours, that's not even the majority of hours, okay? There's more non banking hours than there are banking hours. And so that meant that stablecoins could sort of keep very close to the peg because the fiat inflows and outflows, which is how you arbitrage the peg back to parity. That's how that happens. But those networks were destroyed because in my view, regulators cracked down very hard on those banks in particular. I think that story will come out eventually. They didn't just fail, they were murdered, in my view.
00:26:37.930 - 00:27:13.298, Speaker C: I know that's maybe a controversial view. The point is, there's no fiat. And as the bank assets were sold, the crypto businesses were not included in the subsequent sales. Right. If you look at the sale of Signature and their assets to what is it, NYCB, the crypto deposits were told to leave, and Signet was not included in the sale. So unfortunately, the fiat leg of the trades, which is essential for stablecoins to really work, it doesn't work anymore. So the future of stablecoin issuance for the time being is going to be offshore.
00:27:13.298 - 00:27:25.340, Speaker C: It's still going to be dollars, but it'll be Euro dollars. And it'll be out of Hong Kong, Singapore, Bermuda, Cayman, london, maybe. Probably not the EU, but it'll be.
00:27:26.510 - 00:27:33.798, Speaker B: You know, I'm not the first one to say this, but if cash was invented today? I don't think it would be. Yeah, that kind of goes in that conversation.
00:27:33.894 - 00:28:04.774, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, quick break to tell you about Jito. Jito is the number one liquid staking provider in Solana. Jito has been known for their mev software, and now they're the fastest growing liquid staking provider in the Solana ecosystem. Solana DeFi summer is heating up and what assets you want to use in DeFi liquid Staking Token. Why? Because with Jito, you can take your soul, stake it, and get instant access to liquidity through their liquid staking token, jeto Soul. You can then use Jeto soul throughout the Solana DeFi ecosystem while earning yields through Mev rewards and staking rewards with Jeto. And Jito makes staking super simple.
00:28:04.774 - 00:28:27.194, Speaker A: You can take your soul, stake it, get instant liquidity, and start earning rewards all within three clicks. And not only do they make it simple, they make it secure. Jito has seven audits. They have more than a million soul staked, and they're one of the most respected teams in all of DeFi. Jito is for whales who need deep liquidity. It's also for people like me and you who just want to get started with liquid staking. You have your soul, why not stake it, earn some yield, and start dabbling in Solana DeFi.
00:28:27.194 - 00:28:49.278, Speaker A: So go get started today. Check them out at staking. I'll put a link in the show notes. Use the link so they know that I've sent you, and go get started today. Everyone, we'll get back to the show in a minute, but I want to let you know that we got our permissionless conference coming up. Start conference with Bankless. That's the biggest and best conference in DFI.
00:28:49.278 - 00:29:03.298, Speaker A: It's going to be in Austin, Texas this year. Yep, I know you love it. They Got Tacos barbecue Barton Springs We got it all September 11 through the 13th. If you've been in crypto for a while, know that the bear market conferences are the best conferences, because those are the ones where all the outfits had the people that are still in crypto.
00:29:03.394 - 00:29:04.326, Speaker B: All really want to be there.
00:29:04.348 - 00:29:29.474, Speaker A: It's going to be great for building a network, for learning a lot. And look, we've got a phenomenal lineup of speakers that include people like Hasu Mustani, christine Moy, and Kyle Simani talking about ZK Tech roll ups, account abstraction, mev app chains and more. Look, I'm damn excited because you're a listener of Lightspeed. You're going to get a special discount. Type in discount code Lightspeed 30, and you'll get 30% off your ticket. That's right. Just type in Lightspeed 30 when buying a permissionless ticket and get 30% off.
00:29:29.474 - 00:29:33.890, Speaker A: Click the link at the bottom of this episode and go get it now because prices are going up every two weeks.
00:29:33.960 - 00:29:35.540, Speaker C: All right, back to the show.
00:29:37.350 - 00:30:11.050, Speaker B: We're talking about how important stablecoins are and dollars and how much it dominates the crypto industry. I mentioned this at the very beginning of the conversation. How do you, from like an investment perspective, value creation or capture, how does that impact your thoughts on native l one tokens or even just tokens in general? Because for people that don't know Nick, he's been the bitcoin community a long time. Very strong feelings on property rights and self sovereignty. He also got a lot of flak from the bitcoin community because he actually said he likes things outside of bitcoin too. So, Nick, I'm just curious, how has your thesis kind of changed over time? And how do you think stablecoins maybe affect the value of these l one tokens?
00:30:11.210 - 00:30:53.150, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say I'm very interested in the world as it actually is, not in the world as I might want it to be. And I think as an investor, your responsibility is to try and perceive actual reality as opposed to some fantasy world that you inhabit in your head. And I was probably a bit naive. I was very focused on the bitcoin mindset for many years and eventually moved away from that. In fact, stablecoins are one of the things that really constituted an awakening for me, and they're one of the places where I think a lot of bitcoiners have gaps in their mental model, too. They think bitcoin is going to be the medium of exchange. That's just not the way it works.
00:30:53.150 - 00:31:44.330, Speaker C: Right? Gold is what, $12 trillion asset class, but no one settles transactions in gold, actually. Right? And I wrote a piece for Bankless some years ago digging into this and understanding why the dollar has supremacy in the US transactional apparatus. And as I mentioned at the beginning, there's a few things that make it vastly more efficient to use the dollar as opposed to some other financial asset that's really floating. I think bitcoiners are still a little naive. I think they think that because lightning moves quickly that that is going to be the payment rails of the future. And to be clear, I invest in lightning businesses. I think lightning is interesting, but I don't think the medium of exchange and the unit of account is going to be bitcoin.
00:31:44.330 - 00:33:21.566, Speaker C: So the question is, how do you reconcile those things? How do you reconcile the fact that people want to use dollars? They have a revealed preference for that, if not a stated one, with long term value accretion for these networks. And I thought what the Ethereum people did was interesting in that they built in this kind of capital return mechanism for ether holders, which is a function of how much people use the ethereum network that created ethereum value for ethereum, which scaled with the usage of the system. Regardless of what asset is transacting on the system, bitcoin people still tend to think people are going to transact with bitcoin, and that's going to create a reserve where people have an inducement to hold bitcoin for transactional purposes and that will accrete value to the bitcoin system. So the current Bitcoiner mindset is more out of stuff with reality, from a stablecoin perspective, than the Ethereum mindset. The asset gains from usage of the Ethereum system, regardless of what asset is moving on those Ethereum rails. So the question is, can bitcoin ultimately change itself in any way? Or can Bitcoiners contrive a way to use stablecoins on Bitcoin? Or can you find a way to issue stablecoins against bitcoin? Those would all harmonize the system whereby people want to use dollars, but they would like it to be backed in some way by Bitcoin. That hasn't happened yet.
00:33:21.566 - 00:33:27.738, Speaker C: On bitcoin. The two dominant networks where stablecoin transactions occur are Ethereum and Tron.
00:33:27.834 - 00:33:31.214, Speaker B: Today, for what it's worth, is Tron just like 90%?
00:33:31.252 - 00:34:16.030, Speaker C: Just in some, though, people use tether on Tron. I mean, that's the dominant crypto asset used in emerging markets. If you look at Revin. Howard digital's recent piece on stablecoins, which was excellent, it's just a matter of looking at the data, right? I've always been very data driven, obviously founded a data company. And it was that notion of looking at the data that made me realize stable coins are there's something different here. They have a much higher velocity than crypto assets, structurally speaking, and there are different characteristics. So, like, Ethereum has a huge amount of stablecoin volume by dollar value transacted, but those are much larger transactions.
00:34:16.030 - 00:34:41.160, Speaker C: On Tron, you tend to have smaller transactions. So it's more like retail style transactions. I think that's a function of fees. But, yeah, it's really just a matter of looking at the data. And once you do that, I think a more reliable picture of the world emerges. And I think that can then cause you to rethink your normative approach, which is certainly what happened for me.
00:34:42.650 - 00:35:18.210, Speaker D: So you mentioned maybe kind of certain members being out of touch with reality and living in some fantasy world. You wrote a piece on this on Twitter. A very long one in two pieces. I think you know which one I'm talking about, about maybe like, the everyday bitcoin users and maybe the laser eyes. I would argue maybe the similar thing is happening on Ethereum and maybe even Salana. You can kind of start seeing it happening. What do you think is the cause of that? Can you maybe explain why people are kind of form into religions based on the L one tokens?
00:35:18.550 - 00:35:52.362, Speaker C: Yeah, great question. If I could answer the question of why we have secular religions in the world today, I would be a best selling author. I think it is one of those things where if you strip out religion, established organized religion from someone's life, it's not that they become secular. No one is truly secular. You just fill that metaphysical void with some other affiliation and you find meaning elsewhere. Right. Whether it's CrossFit or veganism or being a bitcoin maxi.
00:35:52.362 - 00:36:31.546, Speaker C: Right. So you can't ever stamp out religion, I think is the point here. And people want to belong to a tribe. Right? And crypto is so powerful because it recruits marginalized people that have kind of typically minority views on things, especially finance and central banking. And it's this incredibly powerful cult because it is financially lucrative, historically, to be a crypto acolyte. And you feel like you've had some sort of key truth revealed to you that nobody else possesses. Right.
00:36:31.546 - 00:37:27.626, Speaker C: That's the essence of a religion is right. You have had a revelation, and you alone, and your peers in that group are adherence to a truth that no one else agrees with. So you feel special and unique and powerful. And so I think it's very seductive, and it kind of depends on when people joined. Like, if you joined the crypto space in 2012, yeah, you probably became an adherent of the bitcoin religion. Of course, you get so wrapped up in this, and it happened to me, too. Your identity becomes dominated by your membership in this religion, and it's very hard to extract yourself from it because you have your peer group and everyone knows you within that space, and you are a celebrity within the sector, and you financially win from being part of that.
00:37:27.626 - 00:38:41.570, Speaker C: So of course it's true, right? Like, of course the underlying values are true because you've done so well out of it, but sometimes things change, and I think it happens with each of these tribes. But, yeah, I think it's very hard to be a true sort of crypto pluralist. It's very hard to be an outsider that's also kind of respected by the different tribes, and it's hard to be data driven and see where the market is actually going and see where the opportunities are. But at the end of the day, if you're an allocator, that's actually your job. It's your duty to extract yourself from any specific tribe. And ascertain what are people actually using crypto for? What are the real world uses, and to strip out those normative beliefs of what people should use it for and to focus on the reality. And so, yeah, I think this kind of becoming a member of an in group and then having audience capture happen to you, that happens with every single l one that is really successful, whether it's bitcoin, ethereum, salana, cosmos.
00:38:41.570 - 00:39:29.060, Speaker C: So I don't know if that's like, a tractable problem to be solved. I think the process of disillusionment is very like, look at the you know, unfortunately, like, been quite familiar with Hex through my friend Eric Wall, who became sort of the chief antagonist of the hex community. So I've actually followed their travails a little bit. And if you talk to hex people today, they are still believers, they still believe in it. What their exact beliefs are, I'm not sure, but they feel that Richard Hart was hard done by and that the SEC charges won't stick. And they don't see themselves as victims. They see themselves as all in together.
00:39:29.060 - 00:40:25.046, Speaker C: With their leader. And even though objectively, they have lost money from being part of the Hex community, the vast majority of them have. The financial loss has not caused them to reevaluate their beliefs because they had so much validation in the years and months leading up to it that their beliefs became extremely concrete and rigid. And even today, they're still adherents and they haven't become disillusioned. So even the most obvious scam ever, the adherents and the victims of that scam, still defend it and still believe in it. Think about other crypto assets where, yeah, there's a drawdown, but people will still stick with those sort of like the core beliefs. So it's very hard to get these people off these ideas once they're rigidly focused on them.
00:40:25.108 - 00:41:01.370, Speaker B: It's like when a community becomes a religion, it becomes a cult. And that's something you see with hex. I remember I had this acquisition audit for Solana Twitter post that did pretty well, and Richard Hart actually commented on it, and he said, you should do this for Hex. And I got ratioed like a thousand to one. Just the fire behind that community is absolutely insane. I think one thing that I've really respected of you is actually seeing that transformation while you've been in crypto and opened up your views and you openly talk about it. One thing like going back through your old talks that I think maybe you've changed your mind on is how you think about crypto networks and scarcity in the sense of like, do crypto networks need to be profitable? And why I think this is really applicable to this conversation.
00:41:01.370 - 00:41:33.414, Speaker B: And also we talk about Solana a lot here. Solana has a little bit more of a, I would say, ubiquitous theory of value in that you just want to get people to use the asset itself and that will add value to sole the asset and the network. Whereas obviously ethereum is a little bit different with like, ultrasound money, and it's really about scarcity. And I saw you talking about Bitcoin, and one of the big critiques right now is the security budget, because I think about 98% of the budget to miners right now is paid through inflation, not fees. And as we know, bitcoin is only going to have 21 million. So that could be a problem. You thought the long term solution for this is likely.
00:41:33.414 - 00:41:55.342, Speaker B: You're going to see exchanges and custodians be altruistic miners in the network, and that's because they have enough of a business and a reason and incentive to mine, even at a potential loss. You could say, just looking at the network alone, do networks need to be profitable? Because based on that, it sounds like it's more important what's built on top of the network than the inflation and the fees itself that are created.
00:41:55.486 - 00:42:55.842, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we weigh over index on the scarcity features and the monetary policy of these l one networks. And under index on the networks as businesses, basically. And it's weird, Ethereum is kind of caught in the middle a little bit in that they were still kind of beholden to the Bitcoin ideology of, oh yeah, the number of units really matters and the direction of travel really matters. I think Ethereum just had a deflationary year over the last twelve months for the first time ever. But that doesn't really matter. I mean, having some notion of a credible monetary policy matters for sure, but there's nothing special about the absolute number of units and the fact that you have some decaying curve where there's an absolute scarcity at the end. And this is one of my biggest issues with the Bitcoin community is this obsession of the stock to flow.
00:42:55.842 - 00:43:58.562, Speaker C: And that's a completely incoherent, absurd idea. And it's very sad that anybody believes that. I mean, it's remarkable, frankly. It's remarkable that anybody believes that. I think the Ethereum people also felt they were, like, held hostage to that idea. But really what matters is are you creating a settlement network that is credible, that gives you strong settlement assurances? And is there some theory as to how the usage of that network would result in the accretion of value to the token, the L one token itself? And so, to the credit of the Ethereum people, I think they eventually came around, they had that realization and they put a number of things in place which cause accretion to occur, scaling in line with usage. I think that my qualm with Ethereum would actually be they went too far and they created a system that was excessively extractive, actually and whereby transactors interests are opposed to the interests of the people that want to be long ETH.
00:43:58.562 - 00:44:45.400, Speaker C: So generally today, ETH is a system that extracts value from users who want to use ETH for settlement and returns that value to ETH holders. So that's actually a tension that I think they're going to have to deal with at some point in the future. Yeah, I think the right way to think about this stuff is are you creating a transactional space that's attractive for people to operate on that gives them transactional qualities that they really value? And are you doing it in a pretty credible way or are you being super arbitrary, changing the variables all the time, extracting too much value? Are you being user hostile? So that's the tightrope that you have to walk? I think that's very well put.
00:44:45.850 - 00:45:13.460, Speaker D: While we're on this topic, I am curious as an investor on your thoughts on maybe a mental framework that you use because obviously there's a lot going on right now. There's bitcoin and lightning. There's ethereum l two s, but then l two s kind of have ZKS and rus. And then there's the app chain, Theses. But then there's monolithic or integrated now with Solana, Monad, Se. There's just a lot going on. What is your mental framework? How do you think about these things.
00:45:13.990 - 00:46:40.342, Speaker C: I think the biggest and most important debate in crypto at the moment is the monolithic versus modular debate. And the question is, is it better to have a flat financial topology whereby everybody is resident on the same network? And so you have very strong composability, right? And I think this is one of the best feathers in the cap of the Solana folks, is the notion of composability. And that is what makes crypto so good, actually. If you look at what crypto is actually competing with, which is the legacy correspondent banking system, that is a highly non composable system, right? You don't really have the ability to interact with the financial system on an API basis and it's heavily, heavily intermediated, right? If I'm making a transaction from Jakarta to Mexico City, it has to go through London or go through New York and it has to do all these hops to get to the one of the hubs and then all these hops to get to the other destination. So that's the status quo that we always need to keep that in mind is our North Star. We need to be better than that, right? That's why stablecoins are so great because I can create USDC with dollars here in the US and then send it to anywhere, really. And as long as there's some ultimate last mile fiat conversion.
00:46:40.342 - 00:47:20.870, Speaker C: Now that's a three hop process as opposed to a 50 hop process with tons of intermediation, tons of costs. That's why remittances are expensive, right? Because you have to do all these transactions, go from bank to bank to bank to bank to London or to New York, then bank to bank to bank to bank again to get to the know. I would encourage people to think in those terms and not in these crypto native terms, actually. So then we get back to composability. And what made DeFi was so great was the composable nature. I mean, it's a poison chalice as well, because if something breaks, then everything that relies on it breaks too. But let's just assume we can sort of figure that out eventually.
00:47:20.870 - 00:48:27.114, Speaker C: The status quo you have on ethereum now is challenging that you actually lose that composability when you have lots of segregation into different L two S. And we're having an L two explosion right now. But if you think about what an L two is, it's like a recreation of the correspondent banking system, right, where inverted and ETH base layer is like the equivalent of New York in the banking system. And then L two S are like these other banks that sort of have this settlement that's occurring. But I think the risk is that people are sharing the same broad network, but they're not actually able to transact with each other directly, right? These smart contracts can't call each other directly. You ended up with all this segregated liquidity that's in all these different pools and I think that undoes the value of crypto, which is to have everybody on a shared big network. So I think there's definitely room to take the alternative view and be like, okay, well, we're going to do our best to create a single layer where people are transacting with each other directly.
00:48:27.114 - 00:49:09.770, Speaker C: And I think that leads to absolutely the best DeFi experiences, no question at all. Because once you get this segregation into different altus, now you reintroduce elements of counterparty risk, settlement risk, more delays in transaction settlement. And that's the literal reason that people liked crypto in the first place, because it got rid of those things. So it's kind of weird to see it coming full circle there. Like that where we're reintroducing the sort of downsides of the legacy TradFi system. So, yeah, from a Solana perspective, I think the strongest thing is this very strong emphasis on composability.
00:49:10.510 - 00:49:33.106, Speaker B: Yeah. And you were on Empire back in December 2022. That's when I was the producer for the show. And you said at the time that I think Salana was the number three, maybe most invested ecosystem for your firm. Is that still true? And I guess has your thesis changed? That was back when Sauna was going through some difficult times and obviously the industry as a whole, as. Did you feel stronger about Solana afterwards or like yeah, what's your view?
00:49:33.128 - 00:50:15.890, Speaker C: Yeah, good question. I think what I'm seeing in the Solana space right now is very encouraging. I think they're showing a lot of, you know, that's the hardest thing is emotionally recovering from a big drawdown and from being loved to being hated, and then it's like, how do you recover from that? So the fact they've been able to rally, a lot of communities wouldn't be able to do that. They just wouldn't have a strong enough conviction to be able to actually rally off that huge drawdown. And so that's relatively uncommon among L ones, I would say. And yeah, I think the recent data should be considered very validating for Salona people. Now, in terms of your question, actually haven't really run the numbers recently.
00:50:15.890 - 00:50:33.480, Speaker C: I would say a lot of what we're focused on right now is pretty blockchain agnostic, so kind of traditional looking financial businesses that have a blockchain element, but they may be operating on half a dozen chains, things like that.
00:50:35.130 - 00:50:55.358, Speaker D: So we've talked about financial applications of blockchains and stablecoins and payments, et cetera, a lot this episode. I'm curious what your thoughts are on the other verticals of crypto, like things like social collectibles, NFTs, et cetera, gaming. Any of these, like you're particularly interested in and any of these that you.
00:50:55.364 - 00:51:41.206, Speaker C: Think is just extremely overrated gaming, overrated, metaverse, overrated. I can't stress that enough. Maybe it'll work with gaming eventually, but you have to make a good game. The game has to be good, right? I haven't seen a good blockchain native game, or there has to be some reason why making some of the in game assets persistent and composable, having interoperability, there has to be a reason why that enhances the game experience. So I'll change my tune on gaming once I start to see that. But I'm not really a gamer myself, so not a focus area for me. Other sectors, I really like the digital sector.
00:51:41.206 - 00:51:49.742, Speaker C: I know that's possibly the worst word in existence. It's so terrible. Can someone come up with a better one, please?
00:51:49.796 - 00:51:52.270, Speaker B: You want to describe what that is, though, for people that don't know?
00:51:52.420 - 00:52:45.566, Speaker C: Yeah, basically linking the analog and digital world and NFTs are a really good way to do that. So we're an investor in quite a few startups that do this. We're an investor in the biggest manufacturer of the chips that go into physically embodied digital products or digital products that have a physical counterpart. And the common form factor is you have a chip which has a key pair on it which is literally embedded into some physical good where sneaker or sweatshirt or something, and then you can interact with it via NFC, I would say is the most common way. And that gives you just amazing qualities. Like you take these analog inert collectibles and you digitize them and maybe you have a counterpart that you can use. I just said I hated metaverse.
00:52:45.566 - 00:53:18.986, Speaker C: But you have a counterpart that you can use in a metaverse. To the extent those emerge, we'll see you have a relationship with the issuer. You have persistence of metadata, right? And so this gives the asset a long life. And I think you have the ability then to trade securely on a secondary market knowing that this is an authentic good. Right. So you have very strong counterfeit resistance properties too. This is one of the sectors that I see growing, even as NFTs are totally a hated sector now.
00:53:18.986 - 00:53:41.520, Speaker C: I still see this growing, especially with Legacy and sort of web two brands. They see the benefit here of having that very close direct digital relationship with a collector or user that I think should be encouraging for that sector. What else do I like? What were some of the ones you mentioned?
00:53:42.850 - 00:53:54.818, Speaker B: This is slightly adjacent into this, but I'm curious what your thoughts are on deepen. Like, have you done any research on deep end? Do you invest? Because that is something where you're using digital assets, NFTs and things in the real world to create a network.
00:53:54.914 - 00:54:31.410, Speaker C: That was actually the third one I wanted to touch on. I'm an LP in a deepen fund, actually escape velocity. I think it's very interesting. I think helium maybe will be able to recover, but I think a lot of the dynamics in helium were unnecessarily ponzi like, which is sort of the original sin of crypto, is how in nature, all these different types of creatures end up looking like crabs, right. Even though they are evolutionarily, not linked. It's the same in crypto where everything turns into a ponzi for some reason. It's completely unnecessary.
00:54:31.410 - 00:55:00.682, Speaker C: We need to get away from trying to get these short term bumps from injecting ponzi mechanics into these structures. Forget about the ponzi stuff, guys, please. That's my entreaty to the crypto space. Stop trying to put ponzi stuff in things. It's not conducive to long term growth. However, I keep seeing ads for helium apparently is like selling $5 mobile coverage in Miami. Is that a real thing? I don't know.
00:55:00.682 - 00:55:02.090, Speaker C: That's remarkable.
00:55:02.430 - 00:55:06.490, Speaker B: Yeah, look true. Nick, how much do you hate Frontech?
00:55:07.010 - 00:55:54.160, Speaker C: So I didn't sign up to fronttech because it has ponzi dynamics in it, which is unnecessary, and I think it's going to lead to a lot of hurt feelings. However, I do think there's really interesting stuff you can do with tokenized consulting rights. Like, I issued this orb which eric wall came up with, which has a harbinger tax mechanic, which I think is so know. The point is that the owners have to pay a tax that's proportional to the price that they set for the asset. And that means that the person that derives the most value from holding the asset is the one that ends up holding it. So it's sort of an anti squatter type function. So I do think there's really interesting things that can be done there on the social tokenization side.
00:55:54.160 - 00:56:33.814, Speaker C: Frontech, I think is a good product, kind of UI UX wise, but I think it encourages people to I mean, from a securities perspective, it's very questionable, to be clear. But then also it kind of has these perverse dynamics where it just leads to issuers encouraging speculation in their token as opposed to issuers wanting to create value, I think, for the holders of the token. So look, I think someone's going to get it right eventually, but I don't think it's historically it was bit cloud and now it's front deck. I don't think those ones are the ones that will be the winners.
00:56:33.862 - 00:56:44.240, Speaker B: Do you have any hypothesis that you're working on now that maybe isn't validated but you think is coming true in crypto? Or maybe it's an assumption that you've questioned and you're kind of looking into right now?
00:56:45.810 - 00:56:55.200, Speaker C: Yeah, a lot of my hypotheses pertain to stables. So I have a bunch of predictions I was going to make in my talk, but maybe I can share some of them now.
00:56:57.010 - 00:57:02.318, Speaker B: Let me you have like 20 talks coming up. So you're running a marathon of talks?
00:57:02.494 - 00:57:28.006, Speaker C: Yeah, I just want to remind people that I exist, basically. So I think people forgot. Let's see here. I don't want to maybe share all them, but give us two or three. So as it pertains to stablecoins, I think USD is going to remain the dominant unit of account. That's very simple, safe prediction. Today it's over 99% of all stable coins.
00:57:28.006 - 00:58:04.470, Speaker C: I think it'll remain 95. I think most stables will be issued in dollar terms, but they'll continue to be issued outside the US. So 70 75%, I think 50% of the stablecoin market cap is going to become interest bearing. So they will pay holders interest on the reserves. They won't just keep the interest for themselves. I think that'll happen very quickly. Within 24 months, I think, as I said earlier, I think about a quarter, at least within two years of stablecoin supply will be based on crypto native collateral, which is going to be one of the best ever developments for this space.
00:58:04.470 - 00:58:19.050, Speaker C: That's the hardest. Yeah. Harmonizing dollar transactions with crypto collateral. That's what I called for in my 2020 white paper. It didn't happen. People failed to do the synthetic stablecoin thing. Well, die, I think, basically failed, I would argue.
00:58:19.050 - 00:58:57.122, Speaker C: But I think when it does happen, it's going to be really validating. Last thing, this is definitely more speculative, but I think to the extent the BRICS countries, which are growing in stature now end up creating a settlement network between themselves based on dollars held offshore and gold, I think it will be issued on a public blockchain. So I think you will eventually have a bricks coin where they are contributing reserves. The reserves are held offshore. The liabilities are on chain. So that's sort of like my big claim.
00:58:57.186 - 00:59:01.080, Speaker B: Do you think they have incentive to spin up their own network or they'll use a public one?
00:59:01.610 - 00:59:30.962, Speaker C: I think for liquidity purposes, it'll make all the sense in the world to use a public. I think, you know, people have been trying private blockchains for a decade now, has failed. If they wanted to succeed, I think they'll want to rely on the existing exchange liquidity that is already in operation worldwide and all the sort of crypto tools and custodial and transactional technology wallets that we've built so far. So I think they have a strong motive to do it publicly on chain. Nice.
00:59:31.016 - 00:59:34.580, Speaker B: Yeah, those are great. All right, Merton, you want to go into rapid fire?
00:59:35.350 - 00:59:50.170, Speaker D: All right, let's have some fun. You can expand as much as you want, but ideally keep them short. Okay, so what do you think is the most underrated idea in crypto?
00:59:53.470 - 01:00:17.060, Speaker C: Underrated? Wow. I think a lot of my stablecoin views are not widely shared, but I would say, like, the notion that a fiat backed stable is good and having freezencies is good also. And I think, yeah, maybe the notion of the digital sector taking off, too. I really believe in that. I don't think a lot of other people do.
01:00:18.230 - 01:00:21.250, Speaker D: What is the most overrated idea in crypto?
01:00:23.190 - 01:00:42.810, Speaker C: The creation of spurious new L ones. And the concept that those are investable, I think is incredibly overrated. And the notion of tokenizing everything and creating tokens for every single use case. I think most of the time, corporate ordinary models work just fine, and you don't need a token.
01:00:43.790 - 01:00:45.386, Speaker D: Does that also apply for L two.
01:00:45.408 - 01:00:57.600, Speaker C: S, or do you. Think L ones everything applies universally. I think maybe 0.3% of the time you actually need a token when you think you need one.
01:00:58.610 - 01:01:02.142, Speaker D: What is something you've completely changed your mind on since last year?
01:01:02.276 - 01:01:30.970, Speaker C: And I'll add one other thing is I think an underrated idea would be an L, one that doesn't have a token at all. And I think it can be done. What have I changed my mind on? Well, I thought that the Bitcoin community could be sort of more tractable and they could be sort of negotiated with and actually have an open discussion about things like the security budget. And I don't think that's possible anymore.
01:01:32.110 - 01:01:37.450, Speaker D: What is a hypothesis that you were super excited about that turned out to be wrong in crypto?
01:01:39.890 - 01:02:15.670, Speaker C: So many I would say most of my hypotheses have been wrong. Maybe the idea I thought that institutional adoption of crypto would be much faster than it was. And I also thought that we would have much higher inflation and that we would see crypto dollarization in emerging markets. And I don't know if that's wrong, but it hasn't happened. I also thought more central banks would be buying Bitcoin.
01:02:17.630 - 01:02:20.410, Speaker D: Who do you think is Satoshi?
01:02:22.910 - 01:02:58.706, Speaker C: I honestly think a committed researcher, like a journalist that actually wants to reevaluate the question will be able to identify Satoshi. I think it's completely doable. It would just take a good journalist like six months to figure it out. I think it's possible that it was the NSA, like it was a US government project. And I call this the bitcoin Lab league hypothesis. I think the system could have been developed by NSA cryptographers and then one of them chose to just release it to the world rather than let it just wallow in the archives forever. The bitcoin.
01:02:58.706 - 01:02:59.750, Speaker C: Lab leak.
01:03:02.570 - 01:03:08.366, Speaker D: What is your two favorite apps to use in crypto? Two favorite apps?
01:03:08.498 - 01:03:10.890, Speaker B: He used to ask three, so he's made it easier.
01:03:13.470 - 01:03:24.430, Speaker C: MetaMask is pretty good. MetaMask and phantom wallet. Yeah. That question is so you know, I'm not very crypto native.
01:03:24.930 - 01:03:26.922, Speaker B: Nick, is the mustache a mainstay?
01:03:26.986 - 01:03:43.106, Speaker C: Are you keeping was a it's? I kept it because there's a girl I was dating that really wanted me to keep it. But then we broke know, I can get rid of it now, but I feel like it's kind of a trademark now.
01:03:43.208 - 01:03:45.970, Speaker B: I think it is, yeah. Okay.
01:03:46.040 - 01:03:59.414, Speaker D: Two final ones, a bit more serious. One is you are a prolific writer in crypto, probably one of the most well known ones. What are some writing tips that you would have for people looking to start writing more in crypto or just in general?
01:03:59.612 - 01:04:29.538, Speaker C: The most important thing with writing is to develop original ideas and that's what gives you the motivation to actually write them down. If you don't have anything to say, then I would say don't force it. So the number one thing is to be curious and try and develop your own ideas. And once you do that, you're going to feel compelled to share them with the world. And that's when the best writing occurs. I go through phases. Sometimes I don't have any ideas or any things where I feel like everyone else is wrong and I'm right, and in those times, I don't write anything.
01:04:29.538 - 01:04:45.254, Speaker C: So it's when I feel kind of a resentment against the world or I feel like everybody else is wrong, there's something that's wrong that's important for me to kind of tell the truth about. That's when the best writing occurs. Don't force it is my tip. Don't force it.
01:04:45.292 - 01:04:45.880, Speaker B: Okay.
01:04:46.650 - 01:04:52.170, Speaker D: What is one piece of advice you would have for startup founders in crypto?
01:04:52.830 - 01:05:36.920, Speaker C: Don't price for perfection. Try and find a venture fund that's aligned and believes in the idea. And don't try and optimize for price. If you do that, you're setting yourself up for failure down the road, or you're limiting your set of optimal scenarios to a very small number where you're outrageously successful, but you don't have a lot of wiggle room. And so try and find a capital partner that believes in you and will actually work for you as opposed to, like, a celebrity fund or someone that you like, because the optics things go wrong so frequently when you try and absolutely optimize for valuation and price.
01:05:38.250 - 01:05:38.978, Speaker B: Sweet.
01:05:39.074 - 01:05:40.534, Speaker D: All right, that's all I got.
01:05:40.652 - 01:05:59.550, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, Nick, thanks for joining today. Anybody that's not on YouTube, make sure to tune in because Mert is wearing his Hawaiian shirt today, which is unusual and great. But, Nick, thanks so much for joining. Really liked our conversation on stablecoins and just on scarcity and value in general. So anybody that hasn't read Nick's writings, I'll put some links in the show notes. They're really great.
01:05:59.550 - 01:06:02.238, Speaker B: So yeah, guys. Nick, thanks so much for coming on.
01:06:02.324 - 01:06:08.340, Speaker C: Yeah, look, I recant much of my old writings, okay? The older it is, the worse it is. Don't read it.
01:06:08.870 - 01:06:20.278, Speaker B: I think it's framing, though. It's nice to actually go back and listen to old podcasts and blogs because you can kind of see the shift of where things have gone in crypto over time. It's kind of like looking back on history, and I actually think it probably sets you up for more success in.
01:06:20.284 - 01:06:24.310, Speaker C: The so, yeah, I read back my old stuff and I cringe.
01:06:26.010 - 01:06:34.460, Speaker D: I think Peter Thiel said in a recent talk, or writing a book is much more dangerous than having a kid or something like that.
01:06:36.430 - 01:06:42.302, Speaker C: Well, thanks, guys. This has been really great. You guys really put me through the wringer. So glad we could do it. Yeah.
01:06:42.356 - 01:06:44.430, Speaker B: Thanks for joining me. All right, we'll see you next time.
01:06:44.500 - 01:06:45.340, Speaker C: All right, take care.
