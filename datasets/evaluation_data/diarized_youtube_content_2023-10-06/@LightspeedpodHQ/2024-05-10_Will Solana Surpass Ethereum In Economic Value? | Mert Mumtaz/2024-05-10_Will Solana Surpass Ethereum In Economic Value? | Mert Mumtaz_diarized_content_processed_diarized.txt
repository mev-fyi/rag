00:00:00.440 - 00:00:39.390, Speaker A: High fee per transaction is bad. Okay, let me put it very simply, but if you have a lot of transactions at low value and then those add up to give you a high adequate cost, that's good. Ethereum. There's not many transactions, and those transactions are high cost. Solana has thousands of transactions, and they're low cost. Solana now has so much activity that the usage times the fees is actually now going to surpass Ethereum, potentially. The thesis of integrated l one s and like Nasdaq on blockchain, I think it's slowly starting to get there.
00:00:39.390 - 00:00:40.774, Speaker A: So I'm pretty excited about that.
00:00:40.894 - 00:01:10.084, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by helium mobile. They've created a crypto native phone plan for unlimited talk, text and data for just $20 a month. We'll chat more about them later in the show. Before we get moving on today's episode, just a quick disclaimer. The views expressed on this podcast by either myself, my co host, or any guests are their personal views and do not represent the views of any associated organization. Not nothing in the episode should be construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal, or any other advice. Okay, let's jump into the episode.
00:01:10.084 - 00:01:38.674, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Lightspeed. Mert and I are coming at you with a roundup episode today. We are recording on May 8. So the Tuesday of the week and coming at you with all of the latest happenings over the last few days, there's been a lot to talk about. As usual. We are fortunate enough to be able to do weekly roundups, given that this industry loves doing ridiculous things. So there's always ridiculous things to talk about.
00:01:38.674 - 00:02:24.430, Speaker B: But before we get into the ridiculous side of the industry, there's some cool data driven analysis I was poking around with the other day. I fired off a tweet that was Solana will flip ethereum in transaction fees, plus captured MeV this month, potentially even this week. And then, as Twitter unsurprisingly does, they really took that one and ran with it prior to me giving any supporting evidence. So let me go ahead and pull this tweet up for the viewers. I want to go ahead and walk through exactly what I was looking at and kind of the conclusions that I arrived at. And so I took this metric of I am soliciting new names for this metric because I hate the metric, but total economic value, show me better names. I need them.
00:02:24.430 - 00:03:20.248, Speaker B: But basically saying defining total economic value as transaction fees plus captured MEV quickly to define captured MeV here because this gets a bit convoluted pretty quickly. The idea is we can calculate the amount of MEV capture that is happening on a chain and specifically capture meaning flowing back from the transaction to the validators of the network, potentially through the validators. This can either be then burned or then passed back onto token holders in some other capacity. There's a lot of options here, but the point is it comes through the front door of the system. On Ethereum. What I'm using for this calculation is actually a baseline MEV calculated by rated network. Rated network pioneered this idea of what baseline MeV is, and it's pretty necessary to have a special calculation just because of the way mev boost in Ethereum works.
00:03:20.248 - 00:04:05.376, Speaker B: We won't get too into the details there, but basically if you just counted the raw number of tips flowing through the Mevboost system, you end up double counting priority fees. So for the Ethereum MeV calculation, we use baseline MeV and we'll put a link in the show notes of how rated network defines this. And on the Solana side, we are just looking at tips that are moving through the geeto tip programs. There are seem, there seems to be, we've talked about this a few times, there seems to be some private mempools cropping up and some searchers participating in these private mempools and sandwiching some users. This is a very small percentage of stake, but it does appear to be happening. Unfortunately, we have not been able to identify like where how the tips are moving from the searchers to the leaders. So we don't really know the size of that.
00:04:05.376 - 00:04:43.752, Speaker B: So we're just looking at Geeto. So it's not a one to one absolutely perfect metric on either end, but it is a pretty holistic view of what mev capture looks like on either chain. So with the definitions out of the way, the exciting piece here is for the first time ever, it looks like Solana is approaching a flippening of Ethereum when it comes to total economic value. So for the listeners here, I've got two charts up on the screen. One is the total economic value for Ethereum and Solana. Again, that is transaction fees plus mev. And then the other one is just the mev capture piece alone.
00:04:43.752 - 00:05:14.946, Speaker B: And Solana has already flipped Ethereum when it comes to specifically just the mev capture. But then when you add in fees, Ethereum is still outpacing it, and so it's coming down to the wire. So the last couple of days it's been Ethereum has outpaced Solana by, like, roughly $300,000 or so on, which is about 10%. Right. They're both doing close to $3 million in daily total economic value. So really excited to been following this, to have been following this for a while. And it's crazy that it's getting so close.
00:05:14.946 - 00:05:31.034, Speaker B: What is your take on the idea of looking at transaction fees plus mev as this, like, total economic value number, and then, of course, like, Solana actually being within a shout or not being a far cry away from Ethereum's total economic value created?
00:05:32.334 - 00:06:42.494, Speaker A: Well, I think it's useful, especially in the context of node operators on the network. Right, because these are where your rewards come from, excluding the issuance of a proof of stake network coin. So this is, for example, now that I run our validator, the helios validator. I have noticed this before, the charts, because you can see it directly in your income, and then you can see, and this is also obviously somewhat due to the LSE season on Solana, but it's becoming more and more interesting to become a validator on Solana because you can actually earn and capture some of this mev revenue and fee revenue on the chain. And so this criticism of like, oh, Solana validators are super unsustainable because there's like a high network cost. It's like, I mean, the yearly cost for the hardware is really not much. It's like three to $4,000 maybe, excluding bandwidth, which is very variable depending on where you are and how much stake you have.
00:06:42.494 - 00:07:27.588, Speaker A: But the fee income that you get is orders of magnitude different or higher than that. So I just looked at a cogent cryptos calculator, for example, for helios, and we take zero commission on both the issuance and the MEV. So we take zero fees, we pass it all back to the stakers, and it says our net income for the year is going to be 1.2 million. And that's with us doing nothing like taking no cuts from this is just from the block rewards, which is the priority fees. And we're actually going to return those back because we're an RPC business. You don't need that money for the validator.
00:07:27.588 - 00:08:04.778, Speaker A: But other validators, they can just take zero fees on the other two and then make a living and support themselves and provide other services and build businesses with this. So it's pretty cool. And so, like, I think this, this narrative of, like, Solana validators not being like a good, not having good economics is pretty overblown. Now, obviously, if you don't get stake delegated to you, you're not going to succeed. But I think that should be pretty obvious because it's a delegated proof of stake network. The whole point is to provide value so that stakers are aligned and give you their stake. Right.
00:08:04.778 - 00:08:36.514, Speaker A: That's kind of how this whole incentive works. Otherwise you're not going to just earn money for existing, which I don't think makes sense, which I'm not sure why we should even encourage that. And so, yeah, that's pretty interesting to see. And it is like, I think most, you know, I think multicore probably called this a few years ago, which is that like, you know, the value is going to go to these l two s and whatnot. That's kind of what they meant by their parasitic to eth, in a sense. Now, I don't really agree that they're parasitic to eth. Absolutely.
00:08:36.514 - 00:09:36.266, Speaker A: I think they could be, but I don't think it's guaranteed that they are. And now you're kind of seeing that play out as the activity stays on the all one for Solana and more like activity like meme coins, which we'll get into later in the episode with meme coin indices these days stay on the l one and then all the other activity on other chains kind of fragments. This is kind of what happens, right? The validator sets start looking weird. So I think it's just kind of the modular, integrated thesis kind of playing out. I'm not sure if you can realistically get around this. The one thing that's maybe I'll touch on briefly though, is people get really sensitive about the topic of fees in MeV in terms of like value judgments, right? Like they say, oh, high fees. Why bragging about this? It's like so high fee per transaction is bad.
00:09:36.266 - 00:10:12.954, Speaker A: Okay, let me put it very simply. But if you have a lot of transactions at low value, and then those add up to give you a high aggregate cost, that's good. Okay, ethereum, there's not many transactions. It's twelve TPS. And those transactions are high cost. Solana has thousands of transactions and they're low cost. But then if you compare the sums, this is just saying that Solana is now has so much activity that the usage times the fees is actually now going to surpass Ethereum, potentially.
00:10:12.954 - 00:10:36.898, Speaker A: So that's a good thing, right? That's how all businesses work. You either make something scarce and expensive or abundant, but then scalable, and then you break even on scale. So that's the fee part. And there's the Mev part, that's the part where people start getting like, really? You know, like, oh, MeV is bad. You're stealing from users, and it's like, okay, Mev. There's multiple kinds of MeV. Right.
00:10:36.898 - 00:11:14.244, Speaker A: Not all of it is malicious. In fact, currently on sauna, most of it is not malicious. It's going to be arbitrage between dexs and sexes and, you know, market making, et cetera. So it's mostly arbitrage, atomic arbitrage, from what I've seen. Or actually, and to be, to be clear, this number is probably a bit inflated because people are using bundles to actually just land transactions to begin with in an atomic way. So there's also that which counts as Mev, but no matter what you call it, it's still revenue going to the validators. Right.
00:11:14.244 - 00:11:45.502, Speaker A: I'm not too, I don't really care too much why you label it, as long as the cash is moving from there to there. And then. Yeah, you also mentioned I want to touch on. There's also some sandwiching going on maliciously, and it's not clear if that's included in this chart. I think it probably is actually kind of represented, because I do believe the sandwiches do still use jito bundles. Ultimately. I'm not sure if it's all of them, but some of them certainly do.
00:11:45.502 - 00:12:56.270, Speaker A: And then Jiro can't, like, police that because just a cat and mouse game, people can send these transactions from anywhere, and it's just about the bundle. So, anyway, I think, like, maybe to sum up my thoughts on this, low fees times, high usage, equating to revenue for the chain, plus a healthy mev ecosystem that's not fractured, I think is super compelling, and I think it's just a matter of time before that flips ethereum and I can kind of see this. I'm an RPC provider, so we get quants and prop trading firms and all these types coming to us daily, multiple times a day, asking us for staked connections or trading setups or private infrastructure to help them land trades on the chain and capture some of these opportunities. So there's a lot of, and this is before fire dancer, right before the king quant basically comes in and then sets up an ecosystem or sets up a new client that's going to, like, supercharge us in a sense. I hate saying that word, but so, like, I think the thesis of integrated l one and like, Nasdaq on blockchain, I think it's slowly starting to get there. So I'm pretty excited about that.
00:12:56.422 - 00:13:22.226, Speaker B: All right, let's take a quick break to talk about helium mobile. Every month I'm reminded of the pain of a phone bill. For someone who is terminally online, those tainted charges are no joke. Well, helium Mobile is bringing a crypto native solution to this. It's powered by a combination of a decentralized wireless network and the nation's largest 5g network to bring reliable coverage to its users. The coolest part for me are definitely the mobile token rewards. They're earned by sharing a location which allows more people to build coverage where it's needed most.
00:13:22.226 - 00:13:49.884, Speaker B: So effectively, the token rewards end up bringing a better product to the customers. But even cooler, you can take these rewards and pay for your phone bill directly within the app. This is a beautiful showcase of arguably Crypto's two strongest use cases, incentivized user action and crypto payment rails. The phone plan is unlimited talk, text and data. Plus, it's affordable at just dollar 20 a month. If this sounds interesting to you, go to hellohelium.com to get three free months of service with the code lightspeedmobile.
00:13:49.884 - 00:14:23.316, Speaker B: Again, that's lightspeed mobile, all caps, no spaces. Be sure to check out the link in the show notes for easy access. All right, guys, let's get back to the show. You said a lot of great things I want to unpack, so let's work backwards. The mevpoint, it doesn't seem fair to count people just wanting inclusion. Like you can send a single transaction through the jito engine, kind of get some MEV protection because there's no mempool and it doesn't really feel like that's a good way to count. That shouldn't really count in this MEV calculation.
00:14:23.316 - 00:14:54.584, Speaker B: And so I actually built the MEV charts comparisons first and started thinking about that. I was like, yeah, Geo is directly integrated into the Jupyter front end. For example, any user can toggle to send a bundle and tip, and then that's not really MeV, which is how I backed into. All right, well, let's include all transaction fees and this fee revenue coming through. I'm just calling it MeV. But it's sort of like some form of other. Some other form of inclusion payment, right? I just want to be included in the block, take my money.
00:14:54.584 - 00:15:45.804, Speaker B: And so that's kind of why I ended up at the newer total economic value chart, which I think is a little. I say it's probably a better way to really be representative about it because even if you just like jacked up priority fees on an Ethereum transaction that could kind of achieve the same thing, but that wouldn't show up in, like, the baseline mev calculation. So I think looking at the total value is a little bit more productive. I definitely agree with your point there. Taking a larger step back to your comments around the validator, I actually just learned this fairly recently, that in Solana's current setup, the commission only applies to issuance or emissions, or new SoL tokens being created that go to validators and then can be dispersed across stakers as well. I didn't realize that fee revenue was actually exempt from that. I know there's a simd to kind of change that.
00:15:45.804 - 00:16:30.884, Speaker B: I don't think that was, like, really an intended outcome, but that's just sort of how v one of the chain was built, and fees have been so negligible for so long, it didn't really matter. But now, if there is meaningful fee revenue, it does make sense to split this out. But that's crazy. I didn't know that that was a thing. And I love that your context around the numbers, because you're at, like, what, the top 60 on the helios validator in terms of the amount of soil you have staked, right? And so, like, okay, top 60 making a million dollars in just fee revenue. That's kind of crazy, I gotta be honest. That is, that, that's super helpful context for even my understanding of, like, how profitable is it to run a validator? And then, to your point, that's on taking zero commissions on issuance and Mev, that is really, really cool to see.
00:16:30.884 - 00:16:33.480, Speaker B: You know, that could be, that's all.
00:16:33.512 - 00:16:57.174, Speaker A: Delegated stake, by the way. Like, we put up nothing. Well, I mean, I put up my own money and we don't. Because the Solana foundation delegation program, that's like, a common criticism, is like, Solana foundation subsidizing it. Well, actually, once you break a million in stake, they withdraw everything. And so that's totally from Solana network participants, right. That aren't Solana foundation.
00:16:57.174 - 00:17:34.523, Speaker A: And so we just, I mean, I like to think I provide some value to the ecosystem, hopefully. And so people maybe want to stake with us as a result of that. Plus helios RPC services and whatnot. And so you just stake with us, they earn like eight to 10%, and then we earn, like, the income the block rewards, which we're actually going to give back to the stakers. We're kind of waiting for the debating, waiting for that simd that you mentioned to go live, or just doing it ourselves via the liquid staking stuff. So like depending on how long that takes. But the great thing is we're not seeing business, so we don't need the money from the stake.
00:17:34.523 - 00:18:18.714, Speaker A: We just want the stake so we can produce blocks and take advantage of the transaction landing properties. Which goes back to Anatolia's point about people don't necessarily look at the incentives for running a validator. Maybe we've over indexed on how accessible it is to run a validator, which I mean, to be fair, that's an important metric. Obviously you should be able to run a validator if you really want, obviously. But then there's the other side of it, and maybe the former side you can call supply and maybe the other side, the incentives, is called demand. I want to run a validator for my business to function. I don't need to make money from the validator, but the validator helps me in other ways for my business, so I'm going to run it.
00:18:18.714 - 00:18:56.320, Speaker A: That's not going to be covered in an economics white paper, right? I mean, it might be, but like, that's not, that's not. That's like a second order use of the validator. And a lot of people actually do something similar or starting to do something similar. And that's like the example that toll uses, which is like if circle detects something on their full node, right? Like, so you actually can just do for pure security purposes as well if you think it benefits your USCC business more. Right. So I think, like, that's certainly not talked about that. I've seen on CT nearly enough.
00:18:56.320 - 00:18:59.724, Speaker A: Like, the incentives for running the validator are also quite important.
00:19:00.224 - 00:19:33.394, Speaker B: Yeah, I totally agree with that. And it totally was the first person to really talk about that. And it clicked for me that running a validator may or may not always be about making money. Right. And the simple framework in my brain is you can just run it as a cost of goods sold as part of your business. If running a validator improves the quality of your business, all right, just like a line item on your income statement that's in the expense section. Granted, if you are in the top 60, it sounds like you're doing pretty well, and it seems far from an expense in the grand scheme of things.
00:19:33.394 - 00:20:48.466, Speaker B: But what I also thought was interesting about just hearing what people had to say about the idea that there's more economic value happening on Solana than Ethereum. One of the really interesting points was a lot of people came at me for not including l two activity in this chart because Ethereum is making the very specific design decision of pushing activity towards the l two s, and that is where the scaling will happen. I thought about this, and I'm pretty aggressively on the side of it does it should not be included in this because there's two routes here. There's option one, where you do not scale the l one and you export your asset. So in this process, you derive value from transactions being denominated in your asset, right? So this is exactly what ethereum is doing, because it is deriving value from l two s, using eth, the asset, as a gas currency, right? You have to actually use the asset to run a transaction. Now there's some other demand drivers there, like NFT marketplaces that are happening on l two s, or maybe as a eth, as a dex pair, or some of these other ideas. But largely ethereum is deriving value from its export by exporting its asset to l two s, and the l two s are using it as a currency.
00:20:48.466 - 00:21:35.796, Speaker B: Then there's option two, which is scale the l one. And in this way you derive value from transactions being denominated in your asset. Right? Let's use Solana as the example here. To execute a transaction on Solana, you must pay in sole, and you also get to capture the value because it is happening on your chain. This is a very distinct difference in my mind, because if you go option two, you still derive value from using the currency as using the token or the asset as the payment for gas, but you also get to capture the value for the chain yourself. So the value of option one is definitely greater than zero. I think there is a meaningful way to capture value by exporting your currency and it being used far and wide in more locations.
00:21:35.796 - 00:22:20.704, Speaker B: I think that that is definitely a valuable thing to do. But to me, the value of option two just has to be greater than option one because it is still getting the currency in more places. This isn't a perfect metric, but total transactions happen on Ethereum and its l two s combined for Solana, Solana is still higher. This is not a perfect example, it's not a one to one. But my point here is that if you can sufficiently scale the l one such that you have a large amount of activity happening on that chain and it's using your currency, this is a more valuable method as it pertains to getting the asset. It's getting the assets in more hand. And this really highlights just a clear trade off that Ethereum is making.
00:22:20.704 - 00:22:39.660, Speaker B: When it's exporting its asset. It only has to rely, or only can rely on that monetary value. Right. And an example of why this is, is let's look at arbitrum, arbitrum's gross margin right now. So transaction fees, less anything paid down to ethereum equals your gross margin. It's at 99%. More than 99%, right.
00:22:39.660 - 00:23:23.106, Speaker B: So for every dollar that users pay in transaction fees to arbitrum, Ethereum is capturing less than one cent of that. So let's call that a rounding error. And then. Okay, well, then where's the value being derived from? Well, the asset is being used and is the largest TVL, largest part of Ethiopia, is the largest part of Arbitrum's TVL, and there is meaningful activity happening on arbitrum. So it's just a different way of capturing value. And to me, it seems much more intuitive that doing both scale or doing both value capture by scaling, getting both pieces of value capture by scaling the l one, um, is probably a better long term play. So that's why I didn't include l two activity in this.
00:23:23.106 - 00:24:12.594, Speaker B: And I think there's reason to, like, look at it like, right? If you did total transaction fees denominated in a particular type of currency, that could be an interesting metric to look at. Um, but to me, it's like if I, you know, gun to my head, I had to pick a number here of if you had $1 of activity happening on your chain and $1 of activity happening denominated in your currency, like, what is the relative value of those two things? Like, it's got to be like less than 10%, maybe even less than 1%, right? So where you'd need like $100 of value denominated in your currency to drive, like some equivalent metric to having $1 of activity happening on your chain, that's like an impossible number to pinpoint down. Like, the market's really ultimately going to have to price that out over time. But I don't know, that's strictly why I didn't include the l two s in this.
00:24:13.194 - 00:24:48.634, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that makes sense. I think that's reasonable. And I do think it's kind of like, almost contradictory to include it, because, like, some proponents of maybe that vision of scaling will say something like, well, you're an app. Why are you leaking your value to the l one? You should capture all of it. It's like, okay, then I will. But then the end result is that the l one doesn't capture it. And so you can't now use the argument that the l one captures value, right? Obviously, for example, Coinbase gets basically all that revenue, not ethereum, Coinbase.
00:24:48.634 - 00:25:28.894, Speaker A: And then now if Coinbase scales via l three s, which seems to be base's plan for scaling, for isolating the hotspots, like via degen, the l three, and then there's some other l three s being launched, well, now those l three s have zero reason to use eth as money. They can just use their own things. And I think they do use their own currencies as money. And so what you end up getting is maybe not so much value being propagated back to Ethereum in monetary aspects. And so that's just kind of a consequence of that design. Like it's just kind of how the physics plays out. I don't see any way around that, really.
00:25:28.894 - 00:26:11.240, Speaker A: And then maybe another line of thinking here is that Solana can also just add l two s if it actually needed to, right? Like this isn't Altus. They're not a moat for any chain. They were kind of a moat for Ethereum because eth assets valuable and people want the effects from ethereum and exporting of Ethereum. But once Solana gets a sufficient amount of activity, there's already people trying to build some sort of l two stuff on Solana. And so you can also do that on Solana. That's not a moat that any chain has. And so, and then, you know, it does.
00:26:11.240 - 00:26:48.884, Speaker A: So I think, like, I am actually genuinely curious how that'll play out in terms because like DA is also getting cheaper and people have alternatives there. So doesn't seem like that would really be a big revenue driver. DL1 isn't scaling. So obviously that's not going to be. Now, some people will say some things like, well, eth one is just for super high value transactions and, yeah, I mean, like, I don't know. I don't know about that. I kind of like liken that to like people saying like, steam engines cost more energy, therefore they're more valuable than like a Tesla or something.
00:26:48.884 - 00:27:41.858, Speaker A: It's like, okay, it's just, it's more inefficient on the engineering side, which is why it costs more. Not, not the whole reason, but a pretty large chunk of it. And so I am curious, like, what's going to happen there, right? Because you need DL, you need like, basically what you would need, I think, is like a few giant l two s who are super ethereum aligned to just use eth as money. And then those have a lot of demand. But if you have something like base, which is an l two, and then it scales via l three s and then those l three s get activity. Now you're leaking probably the most amount of value possible, honestly, other than just not selling on ethereum. And by the way, like going back to your point about the fees being captured, I mean, the fees, what we're trying to see there is kind of validator economics, right? And so if we're counting l two s in that those fees are going to the sequencer, not the l one validator.
00:27:41.858 - 00:27:48.002, Speaker A: So I don't even see how that would make sense to include in that in the first place. But anyway, ranch over.
00:27:48.178 - 00:28:46.898, Speaker B: Yeah, and the other issue here is by offboarding the scaling activity to the l two s, you're off boarding the mev, capture complexity to the l two s. And again, this is like a largely unsolved problem on every single chain, despite those chains who wish to claim they have solved it. So it's just like, I think all the single sequencers, all the single sequencer l two s today are fifo. So colocation, if you were someone who is aware of where that sequencer is, you're at a significant advantage. So I don't know, I don't know what the actual solutions there are, but this is just strictly design decision differences between Ethereum and some of these next gen, high throughput, performance based l two s, or, sorry, l one s. And also a lot of the pushback I got on the l two thing was, ethereum is electing to do this, so you need to include it. Sorry.
00:28:46.898 - 00:29:09.270, Speaker B: No. Just because they're making a design decision doesn't mean it's like the truth or correct. I'm not saying that about Ethereum, that's just a general truth about the world. Just because something is happening doesn't make it true. And there's reasons why they're doing it. Of course, Ethereum is prioritizing the decentralization of the base layer. They just crossed a million nodes, which is pretty interesting.
00:29:09.270 - 00:29:23.164, Speaker B: Nodes, not meaning individual validator operators, meaning the actual number of validators running on the network, which is very much so, controlled by far less than 1 million individual humans or organizations or anything in between.
00:29:23.504 - 00:29:32.164, Speaker A: I think it's about 10,000 full nodes. Like actually machines something. 10,000.
00:29:32.744 - 00:30:23.084, Speaker B: I should have looked that up before this. Maybe I'll do that at the next break, but agreed. Yeah, it's interesting because their design decision is prioritize the base layer, the decentralization of the base layer, and actually storm from paradigm paradigms been doing a work on Ethereum recently, and Storm has been doing a ton of that work himself. They're also pushing out the rest client as well. But he just posted a thread that is thinking about ways to raise the gas limit, which raising the gas limit would increase basically the amount of activity happening in each block. There's a great thread here as well as a blog post on this would encourage you guys to check this out. But basically the takeaway is Ethereum history is growing so big that many nodes will soon run out of storage.
00:30:23.084 - 00:31:11.434, Speaker B: And this is the ever present problem of state growth and state management. Like the two true bottlenecks, if you will. There's a whole thread here kind of walking through which pieces of the chain are actually causing this growth. It's actually bridging activity and roll ups seem to be adding the most state growth to Ethereum on a monthly basis right now, which kind of puts some success towards their path of actually being able to export their activity to l two s. Like it's clearly working. Whether or not that's something you agree with or whether they should be doing that is up for debate. But even on a percentage basis, like a lot of this activity now, I think it's somewhere on the order of like 50% of activity looks like it's coming from state growth.
00:31:11.434 - 00:31:47.330, Speaker B: Activity is coming from bridging and roll up based applications. So I'd encourage you all to read this. He's pushing for EIP 444, which should permanently solve the history growth issue by changing the way the network preserves its history. So super technical won't dive into the meat of it here. But again, point being, this is really just a design decision of a dedicated decision that Ethereum wants to make. And it's sort of the only person or person only he blockchain that is pioneering or pushing this idea forward. So personally I love to see it.
00:31:47.330 - 00:32:27.424, Speaker B: There's a lot of the high throughput spaces becoming more crowded. I think Solana has done a pretty good job of starting on the maximum end of the performance spectrum and then weaning back in. There's 1000 something node operators now, or live validators. Not really the incentive for at least in a delic, I don't think. Let me know if you disagree here, but in ethereum, if I have 64 eth, I have to create two nodes in Solana. I don't need to do that, and I can just create one validator with my total value. You don't have to break it up into any sort of chunks.
00:32:27.424 - 00:32:48.224, Speaker B: I think it's probably closer to if there's 1000 active validators, it's probably roughly 1000. I'm sure there's a couple duplicates, but I'm curious if you have thoughts around does it in Solana, does the validator node count map closer to one to one with the actual number of like, entities or people running machines?
00:32:50.404 - 00:33:55.446, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, like, if you're comparing, because, like ethereum has a lot of validators. And like, I think, like, the most obvious example of this was like, or the Hillary's example was like the stark Nat guy complaining about his airdrop and he was one guy and he was running like 1000 validators himself, something insane. But the number of actual physical boxes, what we care about. And Ethereum, the last time I checked, was hovering around 10,000, 9000, something like that. And then Solana in terms of full machines was something around 3.2k. So 3200, half RPC's, half consensus nodes, which are ones who actually vote. There are certainly people on Solana that run multiple nodes, and it's private, so you can't tell who's running what node, which Ethereum is the same, but I think Solana, you're much less likely to do that because of the operational complexity of operating those nodes.
00:33:55.446 - 00:34:34.130, Speaker A: You'll just get penalized if you're not performing. And. Yeah, so that's like, I know for. And then, oh, and then there's this other theme that I really don't like on Solana, which is like infra companies running validators on behalf of teams so that they can get access to stakeweight qos, which, by the way, doesn't work. That's a whole other topic. But that's a false sense of security, because if an RPC company is running ten nodes for ten different teams, that's the single point of failure. That's what centralization means.
00:34:34.130 - 00:35:29.904, Speaker A: Is there a central thing that links these things together? It's like, yes. So I don't like that, but I think I'm pretty happy with the decentralization of the network so far. I think we can get much better. But all things considered, I think it's quite good. And then going back to maybe the state history growth thing, this is just something I see get conflated, like, way too often, especially by the bitcoin people who have the longest chain rule, like the Nakamoto consensus, where they conflate it. But it's like a note on Solana does not store the entire ledger of Solana, the entire history of Solana, because the entire history or leisure of Solana is billions of transactions. And that is, I think, like just about 300 terabytes or something crazy that cannot be stored on a node.
00:35:29.904 - 00:36:09.552, Speaker A: What is stored on the node is the state, because the state, I mean, a blockchain is a state machine that's resilient to failures. Basically, like any arbitrary failures, the state machine can recover from that failure could be collusion, whatever. It could be any source of these things. We can condense it down to that simple sentence. And as long as you have the state, you can kind of provide guarantees, trip periodically. That's kind of the whole point of blockchain. You do not need the transaction from five years ago in your node to prove that, because that's the hash was already derived with that in mind.
00:36:09.552 - 00:37:01.192, Speaker A: Now, if you really doubt it, you can replay that to reproduce the hash. Fine, you can do that because there's a bunch of archivers who store the history, including RPC nodes and filecoin now and other things in the process. It's actually the same problem that Ethereum will run into, because blobs don't persist forever, right? They're not in the nodes forever. They get pruned, and then they're, it's like it's on maybe an RPC operator or something to provide that to developers or whoever needs it. Same thing on Solana. But, like, it's important to understand that the ledger size, which is the history of all things that have happened, is not the same thing as the current state of the network. Right? Like, if I give you a dollar, the validator will store your that you have $1 more and I have $1 less, but it will not store that.
00:37:01.192 - 00:37:16.904, Speaker A: Merc gave Dan a dollar on May 8 for longer than like a week. Once it gets to that point, it'll prune it and then send it to an archival node will store that information instead. So that's important to understand.
00:37:17.324 - 00:37:51.548, Speaker B: My friends. Big, big news. Blockworks is hosting permissionless three in Salt Lake City this year, so we're heading west for three days starting October 9. Permissionless is our industry's premier defi event that brings together crypto natives from all over the globe. I've personally been the last few years and can honestly say that the attendees are incredible. It's people who actually care about crypto. We also have more than 200 industry titans speaking at the event, and this includes builders like Lucas Breuder from Judo Labs and Brian Pellegrino from Layer Zero, or investors like Kyle Simone and Joe McCann, and even elected officials like representative Tom Emmer, who is fighting the good fight in Washington.
00:37:51.548 - 00:38:13.430, Speaker B: And it's narrative season. So we're going to be covering the seven hottest themes in crypto. This includes things like modularity and restaking or bitcoin and l two s. And even in AI and crypto, the goal is to keep you up to speed on major developments in the industry. Ticket prices will be structurally increasing over time, so get your ticket today from my lightspeed family. I got you. We're going to use code lightspeed ten in all caps.
00:38:13.430 - 00:38:50.112, Speaker B: No space for 10% off your ticket. All right, everyone, I look forward to seeing you at permissionless three, and let's get back to the show. Absolutely, absolutely. There's a great podcast by John Charb and Hasu on uncommon core that's titled something to the effect of the SVM versus the EVM, and they go into very in depth discussion around the state of state growth today and sort of where it goes forward. Potential solutions that both chains are exploring. Definitely recommend listening to that one, but I'm going to pivot the subject here. Murray, you flagged this one to me, and I find it very, very interesting.
00:38:50.112 - 00:39:12.744, Speaker B: The Vaneck meme coin index. So let's see, I just pulled up this page here, and there's van Hack has launched what is titled Meme Coin. It seems to be, like, a private fund index that is tracking the index. I'm trying to break down the holdings, but what do you make of a index based on meme coins?
00:39:13.884 - 00:39:51.398, Speaker A: Yeah, and then it also includes Wif and bonk. And then I'm not sure what the 6th one is. The 6th one seems to be. Oh, Floki. Yeah, so it's doge 30%, shib 28%, Pepe 14%, wif 13%, Floki 7%, and then bonk 6.7%. That's. Yeah, so, I mean, you know, so I actually didn't believe that it was real at first.
00:39:51.398 - 00:40:13.474, Speaker A: So I tweeted, chat, is this real? And Matthew Siegel, who's the head of research at Vanek, commented with the saluting head, the saluting emoji, and then linked me to the thing directly, and I said, what an absolute mad lad. And, yeah, it is real. So, I mean, I think it's.
00:40:16.314 - 00:40:19.254, Speaker B: Like, 186%.
00:40:20.834 - 00:41:13.824, Speaker A: It's hard for me to, like, how often does this get balanced, I guess, is the question, because, like, these things, like, live and die, and it's like, how does that process work? But, like, overall, I think it's just, you know, I could go. I haven't really thought about it too much, but I'm just gonna say it's fun. Like, as long as, I mean, it is called meme coin index. So, like, you can kind of, and I think it says, like, on the text, it says these coins are intended for entertainment purposes. So it's like, okay, if you communicate that clearly, then I think it's okay for people to just have fun and buy, you know, memetic things. You know, it's their own money. You should be able to do whatever you want with your own money.
00:41:13.824 - 00:41:16.044, Speaker A: So I'm all for that.
00:41:16.824 - 00:42:02.158, Speaker B: It brings up a pretty interesting question, actually. Is, like, our indexes the best way to invest in crypto, given that there's likely, or like, if you bought, I don't know, if you bought every l one. And we're like, I'm going to hold this for a decade. You're going to have a lot of losers. And the question is, like, I guess it's kind of like venture capital in a nutshell, right? You kind of don't want to take, like, large bets on a large number of, uh, projects, knowing that many will go to zero, but the ones that don't will basically make up for your whole portfolio. So I don't know. I wonder if, like, indexed is index funds are maybe a good way to invest in meme coins, if there is one.
00:42:02.158 - 00:42:10.274, Speaker B: I don't know, that seems like a, like, I can't even say the statement without laughing, but it seems interesting at the bare minimum.
00:42:10.774 - 00:42:34.846, Speaker A: Interesting for sure. I mean, like, I'm not a trader. I'm not like a finance guy. I have no idea. I mean, it seems like it's not good that people who didn't have access to random fun coins now have access to it. It could be bad that they buy this without knowing what's involved and then lose money and then have a negative thought of crypto. But, like, honestly, I'm kind of at the point where it's like, I don't even know how crypto can get a worse reputation.
00:42:34.846 - 00:43:06.818, Speaker A: So, like, what's the like? I mean, all things considered, like, at least these aren't like these. I mean, most of these coins have been around for like, some time now. They've been around for, I think all of them have been around for at least a year. And so, you know, if people want to have fun, go ahead. If this helps with mass adoption, go ahead. I personally don't do index funds myself. I just like, my risk tolerance is like, super high.
00:43:06.818 - 00:43:26.510, Speaker A: And so I'd like to just get pretty deep conviction on like, one or two things and just go all in on those. But I don't think that's for everybody. So I think. I think if you want to get your mom or something to invest in crypto memes or something, this could be a fun way to try it. And then you can report back to me what happens next thanksgiving.
00:43:26.702 - 00:43:54.352, Speaker B: How do you feel about this social fi narrative that's brewing? A friendtech released its token, and all the token trading has to happen within the app. So I'm pulling out my phone here to check the token price. It's at 205. I think that's, like, roughly a $200 million market cap. Friendech is a really shitty application. It's just not fun to trade your friends and be in private chat rooms. I don't know.
00:43:54.352 - 00:44:19.918, Speaker B: I owned your keys for a while. I'm sorry I dumped you. You weren't cutting it for me. So friendtech is one. They actually did some pretty interesting tokenomics as far as making it interesting to stay involved in the application. But again, to me, if the core application sucks, you're not like, the token is not going to abstract that away, but I know you're also messing around on blast. You're a big Twitter celeb, so I know the fan.
00:44:19.918 - 00:44:26.154, Speaker B: I think it's what fantasy top is, doing an interesting Twitter game. What all is going on with that one?
00:44:26.974 - 00:45:09.636, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, look, I just love the idea of social on crypto because that's, like, the area that just has not progressed in, like, the past two decades almost. I mean, I got Facebook in, like, grade six or something, and that was right around MySpace, right after MySpace, I mean, and then I got Twitter, Instagram, and I guess now there's TikTok. That's kind of it. Like, those companies are just. They have full control over everything, and it's kind of annoying. And so if crypto is like, this, this new building material for networks, right, as Christian would maybe say, um, then social networks are super interesting to experiment with. And I actually like friendtech.
00:45:09.636 - 00:45:24.100, Speaker A: Um, I don't find myself using it. Um, but I like the idea. I mean, I think. I mean, I like racer as well. I didn't even check if I got the airdrop, honestly. I should probably do that. Um, so I can buy some h soul.
00:45:24.100 - 00:45:52.650, Speaker A: Uh, but. But, um, like, I. And then I really like Farcaster, obviously. We got Dan on the show, and then fantasy, that's the latest one. Yeah, this one is interesting. It's like, it's just such a wild idea or an unorthodox idea I just didn't think of, which is basically represent people on crypto Twitter with playing cards. And then you have a deck of cards, like fantasy sports, except it's fantasy crypto Twitter.
00:45:52.650 - 00:46:17.726, Speaker A: It's such a niche. It's like the most niche market you could isolate in, like, gamify and, like, they've done that. And I think they're generating, like, loads of revenue. Like over a million. Was it per day or something crazy, like something wild? And I actually checked my guy, like, my. They're called heroes. And I have, like, 2.93
00:46:17.726 - 00:46:21.594, Speaker A: eth on my car because he will trade me. And I'm like, holy shit, that's crazy.
00:46:22.464 - 00:46:31.244, Speaker B: Feel free to start trading me. I don't know if I have a card. I'm not nearly important, but I will take the trading fees. Get to it.
00:46:33.344 - 00:46:54.104, Speaker A: So, I mean, I think it's a fun idea. I always like social fi and experimenting because it's like the random experiments that give you other ideas that might evolve into something else. And so I'm all for it. If you build something that people are using, when it seems people are using this, all the power to you, man. I mean, that's. That's great. I.
00:46:54.104 - 00:47:39.712, Speaker A: And then now it does. Fantasy in particular opens up to some weird second order effects where people will buy you and then we'll bought your followers so that because they benefit from it or, like, they'll, like, retweet the shit out of everything you say, even though it makes, like, no sense or something. So it does bring up, like, interesting social dynamics that I think are always fun to, like, observe and explore. Um, so we'll. We'll see how they navigate that. Um, one thing I'll say, though, which, uh, particularly hit me with friendtech and blast. I mean, not blast or I guess blast, but fantasy specifically, is that when I first try these apps out, the UX was horrible.
00:47:39.712 - 00:48:04.904, Speaker A: Like, I could not get them to work. I remember, if you guys remember the first week of friendsec, it just basically didn't work. Fantasy is the same. It basically didn't work. Currently, if I go to it, sometimes it still doesn't work. And I have to do hard refreshes, look at the console, try to debug message Travis, some wild shit. But I still find myself using it more than the other apps in crypto.
00:48:04.904 - 00:48:30.400, Speaker A: Then I tweeted the other day, hey, this is what everybody gets wrong. It's not that UX doesn't matter. Ux obviously matters, but it's not the thing. The thing is that you have something that people want. Okay? And then once, because I wanted to use these apps. Once I want that, the UX makes that easier or harder, but it doesn't make me want a good ux, doesn't induce demand for me. Right.
00:48:30.400 - 00:49:05.604, Speaker A: So that's like something that I got a lot of hate for for some reason. But I think it's like, pretty obvious. The first iteration of most breakout apps are, like, always garbage. Like, they're so bad, but it's like they've built something people want and then they keep improving the UX so that it's better and better and better and better and so you can, it has a virality and stuff. And so I'm super interested to see how this plays out. And I think, and then Farcaster obviously is another, like, big hit that just had like a conference far con. I believe that's like much more developer focused and less Degen, which is great.
00:49:05.604 - 00:49:26.124, Speaker A: We need that in the industry for sure. But I really do think that social, I want social to be the big thing in crypto for the next while. I don't know if it will be, but I think that would benefit a lot of people because social is incredibly monopolized and it's basically how people live their lives these days.
00:49:27.864 - 00:50:01.616, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a cool thought of, like, blockchains are really just giant open APIs. And that was a lot of the shortcomings of the social world was building on closed APIs and then getting your product drugged. But yeah, I think that's really the key takeaway there is build things people want, and I think people just enjoy social applications. But I wouldn't limit the development cycle there to software. Right. The first Tesla sucked. It literally combusted the first iteration of the apple glasses.
00:50:01.616 - 00:50:20.564, Speaker B: Like, the AR glasses didn't seem like the be all, end all. I think they're iterating on that. I know people are complaining that they're super heavy on your eyes, and that's obviously not going to fly. I think Meta's like ray ban sunglasses. Those haven't taken off yet either. The slime itering on that. The Internet.
00:50:20.564 - 00:50:21.568, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:50:21.616 - 00:50:49.630, Speaker A: You used to be able to not go on the phone and it'll break your Internet connection and stuff. Like, I don't know, the first iteration of most apps that I've seen, at least back in the day, are just so bad, just don't work. I mean, Helios basically didn't even work the first, like three weeks because we just kept, like, we try to parse Solana transactions and that people would change their ideals and we'd have to reparse and be like, oh, shit. But then people were still using it. It's because they, like, it's a pain point. And then. So anyway, that's.
00:50:49.630 - 00:50:50.670, Speaker A: I'm kind of just going on a rant there.
00:50:50.702 - 00:51:01.274, Speaker B: But no, it's true. It's true. Blockworks research launched two years ago to the day next week. And it's very funny to think about the first thing we put out versus what we have now.
00:51:01.734 - 00:51:02.634, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:51:03.094 - 00:51:26.606, Speaker B: But I think that's really the takeaway here, is just build things people want, experiment. Or is actually another great example of hardhat. Chad was like, fuck it. This is gonna be a cool idea. Just toss some contracts into production. People experimented with it, and then he wins the Solana Coliseum hackathon takes away the grand prize for. Or, like, how cool, like, that is literally the definition of cool shit being built in production.
00:51:26.606 - 00:51:38.074, Speaker B: And that's the kind of attitude that gets me fired up personally. But that's probably a good exclamation point to put this episode on. Mur, thanks for joining me again this week as another fantastic episode. And to the listeners, we will see you all next week.
00:51:38.454 - 00:51:39.614, Speaker A: Yes, sir. Goodbye.
