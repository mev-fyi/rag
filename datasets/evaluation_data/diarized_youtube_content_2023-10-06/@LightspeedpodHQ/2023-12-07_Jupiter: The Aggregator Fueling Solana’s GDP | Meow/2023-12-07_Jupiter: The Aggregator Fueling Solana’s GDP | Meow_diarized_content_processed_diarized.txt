00:00:00.170 - 00:00:17.050, Speaker A: I fully intend to use Jupe to drive as many fucking users into the system as possible, because once they come to Jupiter, they start exploring everything. They start exploring all the games, all the NFTs and all the coins. Everyone comes to Jupiter. They don't just come to Jupiter, they go everywhere.
00:00:17.130 - 00:00:18.286, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by.
00:00:18.308 - 00:00:27.382, Speaker C: Das London, blockwork's number one institutional crypto conference, where all the top institutions and people in crypto are going to be this march in London, what's becoming maybe the crypto hub of the world.
00:00:27.436 - 00:00:28.386, Speaker B: Have a link in the show notes.
00:00:28.418 - 00:00:33.158, Speaker C: Where you can learn more and also discount code that will get you 20% off. So click the link, find out more, and I'll see you.
00:00:33.164 - 00:00:46.810, Speaker B: There's what's up, everybody. Welcome to another episode of Lightspeed. Today we are joined by Meow from Jupiter Meow. Welcome to the show Meow.
00:00:47.390 - 00:00:49.126, Speaker A: Okay, before we get into the details.
00:00:49.158 - 00:00:52.060, Speaker B: I got to ask you, go buy meow. What's the backstory behind that?
00:00:52.590 - 00:00:55.738, Speaker A: I mean, I love cats and cats love me, so meow, you know?
00:00:55.824 - 00:00:56.554, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:00:56.752 - 00:01:07.454, Speaker A: I mean, furthermore, and furthermore, people can hit on founders, right? But they can't hit on know, right? So it's a really good way for me to go about how to go about, yeah, fair enough.
00:01:07.492 - 00:01:24.918, Speaker B: More people like dogs, but you know what? People like cats. If anyone doesn't know what Jupiter is, you're hiding underneath the rock. So Jupiter is a decks aggregator that's on Salana, and they're facilitating over 80% of trades that are happening right now. So absolutely dominant. I want to get to that. I want to get into the token launch that you have coming up and.
00:01:24.924 - 00:01:25.366, Speaker C: A whole lot more.
00:01:25.388 - 00:01:36.630, Speaker B: But before we start, I just want to get to your background story and also, how does Jupiter even get in the place to be facilitating 80% of trades? You've obviously made a lot of the right decisions along the way. So I'd like to get some of that backstory before we get started.
00:01:36.780 - 00:01:56.250, Speaker A: Yeah, I think just real quick is that I think I spent quite a bit of time in the ether. And before that I was actually advising a lot of different ETM projects. And when I say advising, I really mean, like really going in the trenches, right. And kind of trying to win across. And I was advising instead, which was number ten, TDL.
00:01:56.330 - 00:01:56.586, Speaker D: Right.
00:01:56.628 - 00:02:12.102, Speaker A: And one of the probably the dominant smart contract, greater wallet, and also Kyber and also was a senior advisor portfolio. I also started WPTC, which is obviously kind of the most used wrap token today.
00:02:12.156 - 00:02:12.326, Speaker D: Right.
00:02:12.348 - 00:02:33.802, Speaker A: So I started that with some friends yeah, so I think been around for a bit, but really kind of just focusing on doing things. Right. So that was my pre. Yeah. So I think after that and then we started on working on stuff, eventually got to Jupiter.
00:02:33.946 - 00:02:34.446, Speaker D: Right.
00:02:34.548 - 00:03:17.434, Speaker A: I think for Jupiter, I think what's actually really interesting is that it's weird to say we're dominant because we don't think that way. We don't think of dominating. In fact, if you think of the way, if you see the way we do things, it's always about growing the pie and making things better, right? Adding more value to users, right? And actually I think that's actually the reason why we are good. Because from the very beginning, very beginning, from actually very beginning, we had what I call a joke promise, right? Like best price, best token selection and best ux, right? So we never ever top of metrics. I'm not kidding. We didn't win top metrics, right. I mean, it was obviously really nice to see the metrics go up slowly over time, right? But for us it was really just about every day.
00:03:17.434 - 00:03:23.070, Speaker A: Okay, we do have token. Do we have the best price, the best routing? How much is the API? Oh, shit. Starts going down.
00:03:23.140 - 00:03:23.470, Speaker D: Right?
00:03:23.540 - 00:03:26.650, Speaker A: So it was never a moment whereby we popped.
00:03:26.730 - 00:03:27.406, Speaker D: Never.
00:03:27.588 - 00:03:29.582, Speaker A: There was no popping moment for us. Never.
00:03:29.636 - 00:03:30.334, Speaker D: Right.
00:03:30.532 - 00:03:42.434, Speaker A: In fact, the only popping moment we had was after point when we announced things and then there was some hype. But even then it wasn't like dominant, it was just like more coming in.
00:03:42.472 - 00:03:42.914, Speaker D: Right.
00:03:43.032 - 00:03:56.770, Speaker A: But yeah, I would say that it is that relentless focus on the promise, right? Like best token, let me say again, best price, best token section and best user experience. Right, that was helpful.
00:03:56.850 - 00:03:57.480, Speaker D: Right?
00:03:58.330 - 00:05:06.394, Speaker A: And the other thing is that I think is that we are also obsessed about our APIs and SDKs and everything, right? And we mean that from two points of view, right? The first point of view is that what's actually interesting about Solana, right? And the reason why I would say that what we do is really hard is because Solana is actually very diverse, right? You have really obs, you have sexors, you have amms, you have really interesting protocols like liquidity and sanctum, right? So I can bring all these different amms into one single endpoint. And making it work like this wasn't easy. It was just a relentless grind of work, right? So for example, I think one of the things that we do also on one side, one of the things that we do a lot of, is that we work with the new liquidity providers way before they launch, right? Often like even two months before they launch. We work at them to make sure everything's tested. We put it in production. We run a lot of simulations. Firstly, we put into production for a day to achieve ending bricks and then put it for a week ending bricks and one month ending bricks, right? And nothing breaks that road of production.
00:05:06.394 - 00:05:06.926, Speaker A: We announce it.
00:05:06.948 - 00:05:07.182, Speaker D: Right.
00:05:07.236 - 00:05:09.214, Speaker A: We never ever announce before we test it.
00:05:09.252 - 00:05:09.790, Speaker D: Right?
00:05:09.940 - 00:05:21.790, Speaker A: And then on the other side of integration, whether you are a really big wallet or really small app, we listen to you, right? We take care of your SDK needs. We try to cater to you. We try to make sure that what we have is reliable.
00:05:21.870 - 00:05:22.500, Speaker D: Right.
00:05:22.950 - 00:05:32.360, Speaker A: I think it's really this relentless focus on figuring things out. That's why we do. Well, it's not because of any magic, I think. Yeah.
00:05:36.410 - 00:06:12.450, Speaker E: Because you mentioned you guys were kind of consistent. And then there's a spike after your hype announcements at breakpoint. I want to get to that, but I want to first maybe dive a little deeper into the story, because you said you were on Ethereum and you helped with very impressive stuff casually, like WBTC. And then what made you even pick Salana? I mean, at that point, there was a lot of stuff happening. There was like the L two roadmap, there was altel ones, different EVM forks, and then Salana. Why Salana?
00:06:15.030 - 00:06:56.020, Speaker A: I guess I've gotten a bit tired of the EVM stack. I feel like on ethereum you have two main problems, right? The first main problem you have is that you are either always optimizing for gas, right. Your entire mental model is not about user value or growing the pioneer. It's about gas, right. Or you are trying to figure out. Trying to figure out which outer you go to, whether to set on out to, right? So it's either whether side owner, which outer go to, or guess, right. I feel like these are like, how do I put it? Non expense, non growing the pie problems.
00:06:56.020 - 00:07:11.970, Speaker A: In some sense, these problems weren't really like, solving these problems wouldn't really help to bring the nicknames in, right? Because they don't want to do that shit. They don't pay $5 per gas. They don't have to navigate between 25 autos.
00:07:12.050 - 00:07:12.390, Speaker D: Right.
00:07:12.460 - 00:08:03.720, Speaker A: I mean, I don't care how good the U is. Like 99.9% people doesn't do that, right? So I found that. And so I found that to be one major reason why I started looking elsewhere, because I think I got a little bit tired of the state bit of the technology evolution over there and how obsessed they are over those cell problems. Secondly, is that, again, I do preface this every time with this, because I think Ethereum is amazing. I think if you look at the stack of things they have, their research community and everything is just amazing, right? So I think big respect to them. It's just maybe not quite the type of problems I want to accessible over.
00:08:03.720 - 00:08:05.382, Speaker A: So that's my take.
00:08:05.436 - 00:08:06.038, Speaker D: Right.
00:08:06.204 - 00:08:53.254, Speaker A: I think Sona was only the only blockchain that had a unique technical point of view. It was the only one that said, okay, you know what, we are not going to go evm, right? We're not going to go multi chain, we're going to have one big chain. You see that fundamental belief being reflected in the tanker model as well. It's parallel, it's account based and everything, right? So in some sense I think it's rust based, right. So having a very unique technology stack and philosophy to go with it was certainly a big barrier, right? I mean, we all know how big of barrier that is, right. But also gave us a certain weird kind of confidence that, okay, you know what, these features are different, right. And it's probably worth investigating, right.
00:08:53.254 - 00:09:19.774, Speaker A: And the third reason is obviously back then also I think FTX and Sam was a really big forcing function in that as well, proving out a lot of the viability of the space and putting a lot of capital in the space as. So I think those three things are the main reasons why Solana, talking about.
00:09:19.812 - 00:09:49.046, Speaker B: Gas minimization, some people call it gas golfing, because you try to get the lowest score as possible or as few gas spent as possible. So I know that's not like the best resources spent for a developer. How did it feel for you coming from Ethereum to Solana? Do you feel constrained over an ethereum? I know weren't really live at the time. Maybe you were working over there, but then you come to Solana. Rust is much more performant. I'm not a developer, but I've also heard that it can be quite a bit more complicated than just writing solidity, which is more like JavaScript. And you also have to do some certain things like put up the state that you're going to hit up front.
00:09:49.046 - 00:09:54.502, Speaker B: How does it feel as developer? Do you feel like you're constrained in Ethereum versus Solana? What were your takeaways?
00:09:54.646 - 00:10:29.442, Speaker A: Oh, actually initially in Solana there are many, many constraints, the transaction size being like the biggest one. But I think over time, I think what we see is that we see that three things. Number one, I think the development stack became way better, right? For example, you went from being like the anchor was the ankle. Big deal. Priorities to a big deal. Look at the big deal. I think what we felt as a team was that initially it was really tough, but over time, we felt like many of the problems, the constraints that had started going away.
00:10:29.576 - 00:10:30.260, Speaker D: Right.
00:10:32.230 - 00:11:06.046, Speaker A: And now I would say that, okay, we feel like way more comfortable building on Solana than Ethereum, and I think that will actually, I think, continue to improve. So one of the points that I do make quite often is culture. Blockchains are like countries, cities, right? They have cultures. And I think what we do notice is that I think in terms of, it's a very pragmatic problem solving culture, which means that problems tend to get resolved.
00:11:06.158 - 00:11:06.818, Speaker D: Right.
00:11:06.984 - 00:11:41.414, Speaker A: You can kind of see that whenever big problems come up, wherever things crash or things doesn't work, this is very full on, full stack effort from every part of the stack. And I think that's actually what's actually very impressive from the foundation, engineering side of things, the labs, RPC providers to adapts, everyone just like, come bang, okay, we got this problem, let's solve it, right? It does. So one of the most amazing things to happen for me to see, right. Is that every time there's a crisis that happens, it gets solved. Seriously. Whether ecosystem crisis, technical crisis, financial crisis.
00:11:41.462 - 00:11:42.810, Speaker D: We get to it, right.
00:11:42.880 - 00:11:43.518, Speaker A: As a community.
00:11:43.604 - 00:11:43.854, Speaker D: Right.
00:11:43.892 - 00:12:20.200, Speaker A: And that's actually really impressive for me, right. And I think that's also one of the reasons why earlier this year, when everybody just left, why we, and I'm sure murd as well, and a lot of other good friends, Brian and Mango, everyone, I think the reason why I think we were so convinced that it's all going to work out, right. Is because we've seen it before, right. We've seen Cris hit, we've seen us rally, we've seen us get over it, right. And it happens so many times, right. That even when a really big crisis hit, no problem, let's go. I think here we are today.
00:12:21.790 - 00:12:35.310, Speaker E: That's a really good point. I'm going to steal that. I never thought about it. When you have like a big integrated blockchain, you actually have all parts of the stack trying to help solve a crisis. That's very interesting.
00:12:35.460 - 00:12:36.160, Speaker D: Okay.
00:12:37.810 - 00:12:55.230, Speaker A: We did it, right? And you were a big part of it. Right. When crypto. Crypto is not technology. Crypto is not anyone who thinks that crypto technology is kind of not being, right. Crypto is a really weird mix of technology, finance. Let me not finance technology.
00:12:55.230 - 00:13:06.406, Speaker A: Money and emotions, right? So it's like constantly, technology has to be up, money has to be flowing and the emotions need to be up.
00:13:06.508 - 00:13:07.254, Speaker D: Right.
00:13:07.452 - 00:13:15.866, Speaker A: When I say those things that don't mean they can't be down. I just have to be up at some point, right. And money can flow up, but they come here at some point, right. Technology can go down, go up again.
00:13:15.888 - 00:13:16.026, Speaker D: Right.
00:13:16.048 - 00:13:19.174, Speaker A: So it's this flow of things that I think I really appreciate.
00:13:19.222 - 00:13:19.386, Speaker D: Right.
00:13:19.408 - 00:13:34.538, Speaker A: And I think over the last few, it has been really fun last two years, just looking through all the ins and out of things, and I really appreciate it. You'll be part of that. You were amazing part of that. Right. Look, every blockchain needs two or three really amazing providers.
00:13:34.554 - 00:13:34.734, Speaker D: Right?
00:13:34.772 - 00:13:35.674, Speaker A: RPC providers.
00:13:35.722 - 00:13:35.982, Speaker D: Right?
00:13:36.036 - 00:13:38.758, Speaker A: Literally like the hot rock of the ecosystem.
00:13:38.794 - 00:13:38.946, Speaker D: Right?
00:13:38.968 - 00:13:39.730, Speaker A: And you did that.
00:13:39.800 - 00:13:40.420, Speaker D: Right.
00:13:41.030 - 00:13:52.470, Speaker A: We all know what you did for us in terms of. In terms of just pushing the whole. I think you were a terrific bit rock of the host.
00:13:53.930 - 00:13:55.126, Speaker E: Thank you, sir.
00:13:55.308 - 00:13:59.080, Speaker B: Mert's going to cut that section and send it to his girlfriend. So thank you.
00:14:01.870 - 00:14:25.470, Speaker E: She thinks I'm like a pro gamer or something. She has no idea what this mean. That's, first of all, I'm going to steal that because that's a good way of thinking. So if anybody's watching this and sees me post on Twitter, I stole from meow. I think we've done a really good job of covering why you guys came here and what your journey has been like.
00:14:25.540 - 00:14:38.658, Speaker C: Quick break to tell you about an upcoming event. I promise you don't want to miss. It's blockwork's biggest and best institutional conference, called Das London. It's a two day event happening in London this march where we're going to have over 700 institutions, 130 speakers, and a couple of thousand of us all under one roof.
00:14:38.744 - 00:14:40.178, Speaker B: Crypto is in a position for the.
00:14:40.184 - 00:15:02.942, Speaker C: First time to actually onboard these institutions and they're showing up. We have companies from Blackrock to visa launching real products in the space. We have the real world asset narrative taking off. We have things like payments that have been exponentially growing, and then we have things like deepen happening in the salana ecosystem. There's a ton of capital right now in this institutional space that's going to be coming on chain. It's going to completely change the industry. Whether you are an institution or you're a retail user or you just want to learn more about what's going on in the space, this conference is for you.
00:15:02.942 - 00:15:19.538, Speaker C: You're going to be able to meet some of the best and smartest people in the space. The speaker lineup is absolutely incredible and you'll get to hang out with me. But the best part is you actually get 20% off your ticket if you use lightspeed 20 when checking out. That's light speed 20. I put a link in the show notes. I recommend buying this today because, one, you'll forget about it. Two, these ticket prices go up every single month.
00:15:19.538 - 00:15:22.930, Speaker C: So anyways, I hope to see you there. Now, let's get back to the show.
00:15:23.000 - 00:15:44.634, Speaker E: Now, I want to talk about the future and the opportunity that Jupiter has, right? Because you talk about it. So it seems apparent that in your vision that Jupiter's opportunity is much bigger than anything before, right. Can you maybe talk a bit about that? What does the future look like for Jupiter and why you're excited about mean?
00:15:44.672 - 00:16:00.366, Speaker A: I would say, first of all, I would say that I think one big problem, really fucking big problem, I see in the whole crypto page right now, right, is that we've become so fucking cynical, we literally forgot why we got started in the first place.
00:16:00.468 - 00:16:01.070, Speaker D: Right?
00:16:01.220 - 00:16:08.702, Speaker A: It's like bitcoin. Just worry about being a store value ethereum. Just worry about more and more autos. Justifying why more and more autos.
00:16:08.846 - 00:16:09.540, Speaker D: Right?
00:16:10.150 - 00:16:38.102, Speaker A: Seriously, guys, come on. Seriously. Can you imagine justifying why blast is a technology advancement? I mean, come on, let's get over. I mean, I don't claim that Jupiter is solving cancer, right? Why will you claim that blast is like something that's so great. Come on. I mean, it's fine, right? It's an L, two, and it gets TVL and farmer.
00:16:38.166 - 00:16:40.010, Speaker E: It's a bridge. It's a one way bridge.
00:16:40.750 - 00:16:48.878, Speaker A: And it's great. I mean, nothing wrong with that. I'm not hater. I'm not a hater. I am, but I don't stop cancer, right? And you don't innovate. Done. That's it.
00:16:48.878 - 00:17:18.454, Speaker A: Let's go. So I feel like that's actually the basis from the unhappiness with how sneaker we have become as an industry and how satisfied we are with creating new servers and you farming on them and just deploying contracts and you farming on them and being happy with that. I feel like that's the limit of thinking on that industry. I think you move past that. So I think that's actually the thing. So I would say it's not even that. I think we are thinking big, but more, I feel like we forgot a lot of things.
00:17:18.454 - 00:17:49.860, Speaker A: I mean, think about it. What do you want to do now? We believe in crypto sovereign remittances, payments, social systems and all that good stuff by replacing Nasdaq, right. I feel like we kind of forgot about doing all that. Seriously, we did, right? So I feel like that's actually what I think we should really think about. How do we really kind of bring upon the world where we can actually imagine this happening now? I think we need to onboard millions and tens of millions of users into.
00:17:50.950 - 00:17:54.514, Speaker D: Know in the two years and get the critical mass.
00:17:54.712 - 00:18:37.746, Speaker A: Because when we get to a certain level of critical mass, such as, okay, when someone in the US has her grandma in the Philippines has so account, bang, the remittance happens easy, right? And of course, I think so many things like payments and remittances and even Nasdaqs and everything, I think they become possible when you have somehow critical mass, right? And it doesn't matter if you buy crypto. And here's the reason why. Because buying crypto is different with using crypto, right? Because we can have the entire world buy crypto, but if they keep buying crypto on binance, right, nothing happens. Zero. Nothing happens. And I mean nothing.
00:18:37.848 - 00:18:38.258, Speaker D: Right.
00:18:38.344 - 00:18:41.282, Speaker A: The capital is down chain, right. It's traded on central changes.
00:18:41.336 - 00:18:41.554, Speaker D: Right.
00:18:41.592 - 00:18:42.850, Speaker A: You can't actually use it.
00:18:42.920 - 00:18:43.250, Speaker D: Right.
00:18:43.320 - 00:19:13.338, Speaker A: You don't actually use capital for anything. Nothing happens. Everything we talked about the dream of crypto, right? Remittances, payments, decentralized social systems like NFTs, like social networks, decentralized identity, none of those happen if the capital is stuck on a centralized exchange. That's why we think it's so important for us to bring all these users on chain, to be using things on chain.
00:19:13.434 - 00:19:14.080, Speaker D: Right.
00:19:15.570 - 00:19:49.046, Speaker A: And that's kind of what I want you to do. We want Jupiter to kind of like, we call it the spear tip of bridging that centralized, centralized systems to kind of bring one more to be in. And the first thing that people use is trading. The first thing that people use is trading. That's like the most basic use case of crypto or of any definites, right? So at a very high level, we think that, okay, if you want to bring crypto, like this whole decentralization forward, right. We got to really let more people use decentralized systems. And then the second thing is that below that, we think that, okay, we think that Solana is the best place.
00:19:49.068 - 00:19:50.038, Speaker D: To do it, right.
00:19:50.124 - 00:20:05.526, Speaker A: Time is now, right. We're talking about bitcoin and Ethereum and everything is starting. I think time is now. I think. I think the technology stack is finally ready. And also one big advantage of the FTX thing is that people get it now. Wow.
00:20:05.526 - 00:20:10.378, Speaker A: Okay. It's centralized thing. No, matter how safe it seems, it's probably not as safe.
00:20:10.474 - 00:20:10.878, Speaker D: Right.
00:20:10.964 - 00:20:33.618, Speaker A: So there's actually a very big readiness on our end. We think that, hey, you know what? Hey, you know what? I think we are in a really good position, Jupiter, to kind of welcome these people, give them the right ux, give them right liquidity and give the right incentives, give them a community to come and come in here. Because once they come to Jupiter, they don't come to Jupiter.
00:20:33.714 - 00:20:33.974, Speaker D: Right.
00:20:34.012 - 00:20:34.882, Speaker A: They come to everywhere.
00:20:34.946 - 00:20:35.126, Speaker D: Right.
00:20:35.148 - 00:21:04.578, Speaker A: They start exploring everything. They start exploring all the games, all the NFTs and all the coins and everything and stuff. And we're seeing it today. We're seeing it today right now, actually, everyone come to Jupiter. They don't just come in Jupiter, they go everywhere and we see that big, you know, and that's also why we are doing things like Jupiter start today. We just did a really amazing community intro thing with obvious NFT whereby their community came to our community and then we just introduced our entire community to them. It was great.
00:21:04.578 - 00:21:07.858, Speaker A: So much fun. Our community loved their stuff.
00:21:07.944 - 00:21:08.482, Speaker D: Right?
00:21:08.616 - 00:21:29.334, Speaker A: And then we are going to also promote data markets next week. A big power trend do is just really bring along into a decentralized game, right. Then go, wow, using a deck is so much fun. Holy shit, I can do everything else. And then once they come in, they don't go know. Right, so that's the. Yeah, yeah.
00:21:29.372 - 00:21:54.734, Speaker B: I think you're doing something with Jito as well this week. So if anyone doesn't know Jupiter, start. It's basically a way that this is really cool. It was announced at breakpoint as well. It's a way for Jupiter to introduce people to other projects in the ecosystem, essentially, actually, and to spread awareness. I'm curious, I might be jumping the gun here, but when you have new users, you're talking about all these users coming to the space. I would say right now, if you're coming to Salana, there's a 50% chance the first thing you do is go to Jupiter because that's how you're going to interact with different tokens and then maybe you go play on another project.
00:21:54.734 - 00:22:15.238, Speaker B: How do you think about it? Because onboarding is so important here. How do you think about it? If a new user comes and they come to Jupiter and then the first thing that happens is their wallet pops up, but they don't have a wallet with Salana. Is that something you guys are working on or do you think more about it as we want to integrate with phantom in every single wallet instead of maybe hosting our own because to me that's a troublesome friction point. If you're a new user, you come to Jupiter and all of a sudden ask for a wallet and you don't.
00:22:15.244 - 00:22:38.878, Speaker A: Know how to get one. Yeah, I think the way we think about it is that we definitely think that there are a lot of great wallets out there. So I think it's actually a really good point right now. I think the UX right now is definitely still pretty much around. Like, okay, you already have a wallet, right? So maybe a really good ux could be like, you don't have a wallet. Do this.
00:22:39.044 - 00:22:39.614, Speaker D: Right.
00:22:39.732 - 00:22:42.670, Speaker A: Okay, you know what? We're going to do it next week. Let's go.
00:22:42.820 - 00:22:43.520, Speaker D: Right.
00:22:45.570 - 00:22:57.422, Speaker A: That's actually a great thing to start looking into for sure. Yeah, I feel like that's actually really important because we are going to look into as we start into looking into kind of bringing more and more users into the whole decentralized space.
00:22:57.496 - 00:22:57.926, Speaker D: Right.
00:22:58.028 - 00:23:01.414, Speaker A: I feel like that's a really good reminder. Thanks for sharing that.
00:23:01.452 - 00:23:01.606, Speaker D: Right?
00:23:01.628 - 00:23:22.366, Speaker A: Because we really share. Oh, it's a really good point because right now if you click connect wallet, it just says no wallet. It should be like, hey, are you confused? Are you not sure to do, here's what you do kind of thing. Right. I feel like that will actually be a much better experience. Yeah, I'm going to do that next week. I should do, you phantom should pay.
00:23:22.388 - 00:23:23.982, Speaker B: You for that distribution, to be honest.
00:23:24.116 - 00:23:28.446, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll let you decide that. I mean anybody, right? I don't think so.
00:23:28.468 - 00:23:57.030, Speaker B: Then I think one important part to hit on that I didn't think about until yesterday when I was listening to your podcast with Chow is why an aggregator like Jupiter works so well on Salana. And then you have a Dex like orca which does, I don't know, 46% of trades go through there, but most of their trades are routed through you. Whereas if you go to Ethereum, almost everyone goes directly to uniswap. They don't go to one inch, which is an aggregator. Can you explain why on Ethereum people go directly just to one decks a seven aggregator, whereas on Salana most people go to Jupiter.
00:23:58.010 - 00:24:19.150, Speaker A: It's actually pretty easy, right? It's just guess, right? First of all, I think the 80% refers to retail volume. That means retail volume, right. I think when bought, I think it's about 60%, 50, 60. Anyway, I think it's quite simple. It's gas. On Ethereum, it sounds very complicated, but it's pretty simple.
00:24:19.220 - 00:24:19.550, Speaker D: Right.
00:24:19.620 - 00:24:43.026, Speaker A: And it goes into one reason why I started Jupiter space, because I understood the landscape on Solana as being fundamentally different, right, from the landscape, ethereum. On Ethereum, unless you're doing really big trades, if you're okay, it doesn't make sense to do one each because they get to kill you. Whereas on then on the L two, you really don't have a lot of.
00:24:43.208 - 00:24:43.614, Speaker D: Right.
00:24:43.672 - 00:24:59.626, Speaker A: So it doesn't even make that much sense to aggregate, right? So I think that's actually one thing. And secondly, that on Ethereum, one uniswap is very dominant, right? Whatever you want, you have it there and then, whereas on Solana you have onridium and opinionates and everything and stuff.
00:24:59.648 - 00:24:59.786, Speaker D: Right?
00:24:59.808 - 00:25:34.758, Speaker A: So that's another big reason. And third thing is that, well, you know what, Solana just have a much bigger diversity of systems too, right? You have Phoenix open book and like lipid and gurus and everything and stuff that you just don't have on Ethereum. I think that is only going to grow, right, because it's extremely hard to have an instant staking, unstaking pool on Ethereum, right? Whereas Salana is directly integrated to Jupiter, right. Literally. It's amazing. One trade goes like, one sole trade goes in, depending on what price it is. You can go to oka, radio, open book and sanctum, right, which is the direct staking, and it comes on your end, as I saw, right.
00:25:34.758 - 00:26:13.380, Speaker A: And all that happens at 0.2 cents. So I feel like that's also the reason why we are so committed to the craft of making things work, because it's actually really fucking hard to make everything, all these different things work really well. In one thing, in summary, I would say that partly it's because of gas and how dominant things are and also diversity of things. Right. But I also have to give massive credit to my team because we really work it day in, day out for a long time to make it work. Well.
00:26:15.830 - 00:26:24.466, Speaker E: Yeah, that makes sense. And yeah, I know your engineers. They are very smart and very committed.
00:26:24.578 - 00:26:30.822, Speaker A: I feel like it's one thing to be smart and I think to be committed as well. They are like instantly committed to the craft.
00:26:30.966 - 00:26:31.322, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:26:31.376 - 00:26:31.980, Speaker A: Amazing.
00:26:33.790 - 00:26:56.738, Speaker E: So we talked about what you want to do, which is, in a sense, bring people on chain, bring back the decentralized kind of vision that the industry kind of came from, and grow the pie for everybody. Use Jupyter as a gateway into other stuff and grow the pie is how you say it, what you want to do.
00:26:56.824 - 00:26:58.354, Speaker A: I love pie. Let's get pie.
00:26:58.392 - 00:26:59.140, Speaker D: Let's go.
00:27:00.070 - 00:27:40.986, Speaker E: But that's what you're going to do. But okay, I guess the question is, how are you going to do it? Right. What does the execution look like here? So I know, for example, you guys obviously are an aggregator, but you're also now adding perps with 100 x leverage. So that's been fun for me. You first went very vertical within swaps, but then now you're kind of expanding out. So I guess I'm curious, what does that look like concretely for you when you say you're very excited for the future of Jupiter? What are you guys going to do explicitly?
00:27:41.018 - 00:27:41.166, Speaker D: Right.
00:27:41.188 - 00:27:49.620, Speaker E: And there's also, we just had Ben on with Meteora and there's kind of like synergistic effects, you know, what does the actual tactics look like?
00:27:51.670 - 00:27:54.530, Speaker A: As I mentioned before, I think crypto is a very interesting game.
00:27:54.600 - 00:27:54.834, Speaker D: Right.
00:27:54.872 - 00:27:56.914, Speaker A: Because it's not just about technology.
00:27:57.032 - 00:27:57.410, Speaker D: Right.
00:27:57.480 - 00:28:00.194, Speaker A: It's also about community and incentives.
00:28:00.322 - 00:28:00.902, Speaker D: Right.
00:28:01.036 - 00:28:24.522, Speaker A: So I think to answer the question, I think we look at it not just from a product point of view, but also from a community and kind of finance point of view, right. I think we laid out several key things to be the start, which involves around both the community and also launch pad and also atlas, kind of like really helping new projects and new tokens get traction.
00:28:24.666 - 00:28:25.262, Speaker D: Right.
00:28:25.396 - 00:28:49.954, Speaker A: We think that's going to be a very important part of what we're doing forward, which is to kind of take whatever community we have and try to help other projects get the community as well. Very important. And then we also look into some cross interchanging as well. But the key thing there is that we'll be doing in a way we want to do it in a way such that we really help to bring more liquidity into Solana and not our Solana.
00:28:50.002 - 00:28:50.166, Speaker D: Right.
00:28:50.188 - 00:29:04.550, Speaker A: So that's how I think boring on the trading side of things is really kind of making sure that our spot offerings and our per offerings is better or on par with all the taxes.
00:29:04.630 - 00:29:05.260, Speaker D: Right.
00:29:06.990 - 00:29:25.310, Speaker A: So that's actually like table six. Table six. Because all the incentives they want. However, I think if we can't actually have equivalent level of usability or liquidity as a taxes, people just still not come in.
00:29:25.380 - 00:29:25.950, Speaker D: Right.
00:29:26.100 - 00:29:37.134, Speaker A: That is like basic. But thankfully for Jupiter. Thankfully Jupiter, right. We don't live in a silo. If you are sacked, you operate in a silo.
00:29:37.182 - 00:29:37.394, Speaker D: Right.
00:29:37.432 - 00:29:50.210, Speaker A: What does it mean? It means that you have to get all the liquidity yourself. You have to get all the users regarding yourself. But we're not, we work at ecosystem, we don't have to implementing ourselves.
00:29:50.370 - 00:29:50.790, Speaker D: Right.
00:29:50.860 - 00:30:40.826, Speaker A: Essentially, if you're a new amm and you want to grow the BTC volume or BTC trading, we help you. If you are a cool new app with a fun use case or NFT, they're getting a draft to help you, right. So it's actually very important because we don't have to do everything ourselves in order to kind of create the kind of utility that you need, right. And think about it, right. It's like, okay, can a small debt beat binance? Very hard? But can an ecosystem be mean? Why not? I mean, think about it, why not, right? If we as ecosystem cannot be financed then over like say five years, right? Something's very wrong. We're not doing things right. So that's how I think about it.
00:30:40.848 - 00:30:40.986, Speaker D: Right?
00:30:41.008 - 00:31:11.218, Speaker A: So that's the reason why I keep thinking grow high, because I don't think it's possible that we alone bring forth this thing, right. I certainly want to help, but I think it's more about how do we as ecosystem build our utility, right. I think that's one very important thing that we always don't understand. Don't think about as industry, right. We always think about, okay, is unicorn better than. No. Is we as ecosystem better than binance? I think yes, it has to be at some point.
00:31:11.218 - 00:31:27.946, Speaker A: So that's my first answer to you, right. And I think, I do actually think that trading is like the main and the first use case that we win and we don't win it on our own, we need it together. And that's on the trading side of things.
00:31:27.968 - 00:31:28.202, Speaker D: Right.
00:31:28.256 - 00:32:01.294, Speaker A: And then the other side of things is the incentives and community over here. I'm just going to say right here on this podcast that I fully intend to use Jup to drive as many fucking users into the system as fucking possible. Okay? And I said it, okay? I said it, right? And I'm not sure I'm going to do it yet. I'm not sure, but I'm going to do it.
00:32:01.332 - 00:32:01.966, Speaker D: That's it.
00:32:02.068 - 00:32:41.946, Speaker A: I don't know what to say. Yeah, I don't have any answers right now, but that's my tactic. And clear, it's not just Jupiter. I think there's many, many tokens, right? But I think it's through the combined power of all these tokens that we can drive more people in. So in summary, it's number one, liquidity, liquidity liquidity, NFT, liquidity user liquidity trading liquidity, right. That's the first thing we need to actually really have better liquidity as ecosystem than any sex, right? Second, utility, utility, utility. Can we actually make having things on chain much more useful, apparently.
00:32:41.946 - 00:32:59.670, Speaker A: Useful, useful, right, than hemisex. And thirdly is incentives. How do we actually use incentivity correctly? Build right community. That's how that's answered to you. I don't think it's one answer. I don't think it's about product at all.
00:32:59.740 - 00:33:00.022, Speaker D: Right.
00:33:00.076 - 00:33:13.718, Speaker A: Product is very important, but I really think there's a synergistic approach towards tackling the problem. What I call bridge the centralized meta, right. And bring forth the decentralized one. Okay.
00:33:13.804 - 00:33:42.142, Speaker B: Talking about competing with centralized exchanges again, I'm kind of looking ahead here. This is probably like five to ten years out. One thing, salon has been known as not having a lot of tokens. We're seeing that change right now. One reason people are probably coming to Jupiter and actually downloading Solana wallets for the first time is because they want to get access to those tokens because you can't trade them on centralized exchanges. For the most part, they're a little bit slower in actually adopting those tokens. So what I am wondering though is when I first started my journey in crypto, I downloaded Coinbase, but then I downloaded Kraken because they had certain tokens that weren't listed on Coinbase.
00:33:42.142 - 00:33:58.662, Speaker B: Then I downloaded Gemini because they had tokens that weren't listed on Coinbase. But one of the best things about these centralized exchanges is that they cover multiple chains. I'm just curious how you think about that as Jupiter, because to truly compete with a centralized exchange, I think that could be really hard potentially if you're only having Solana tokens.
00:33:58.806 - 00:35:03.694, Speaker A: How do you think about that? I think you solve this problem in phases, right? And the first phase you solve it is that you solve it by making sure, as you said earlier, making sure that Solana has compelling tokens and Jupiter is the best place to trade them, right? I think we see that very clearly. We see a lot of new tokens as well, right? So I think, first of all, it's like, first of all, in your homebase, before homebase, homebase means that, okay, you do actually have a sell of tokens that is only available on so on. So you do need a homebase, right? And that alone is good enough for competing, because at least you will come to you for a reason. At least you have a reason for the second. And the second phase is the majors, ETH, BTC, RVX, op, or any of the new big hot tokens, even woke coin. So I think all those are called the majors you can think of. Maybe you can take the top hundred trader tokens and have a way to do that, right.
00:35:03.694 - 00:35:31.482, Speaker A: And then later I call the meta where the full set of decentralized tokens that you might want to buy or sell anywhere. In summary, I think I do see as a multi set problem. I mean, I'll be just be honest here. Even peef, for example, it was still traded mostly on know than decentralized exchanges. I mean, I know we can talk really big about tenure down the road, right? But the truth is that right now, even right now, when new tokens launch on Solana, they are mostly available on sexus.
00:35:31.566 - 00:35:31.958, Speaker D: Right?
00:35:32.044 - 00:35:46.086, Speaker A: And I get it because there's a lot more liquidity there than here. The pumping power of debt is a lot higher than here. But I do actually want to even the playing field first. So that's my immediate goal right now. And also to kind of really make it more compelling.
00:35:46.118 - 00:35:46.314, Speaker D: Right.
00:35:46.352 - 00:36:07.246, Speaker A: That's the first thing. And secondly, for the majors, I think it will have to come down to having a very robust MMs, whether it's Metura or other, right. That really incentivize that kind of like liquidity to come in. And I do actually think there's opportunity here to make it such that any token is tradable on Solana.
00:36:07.438 - 00:36:08.180, Speaker D: Right.
00:36:08.630 - 00:36:15.218, Speaker A: That would be a very big tank undertaking right now, but we'll be starting on the next.
00:36:15.384 - 00:36:15.714, Speaker D: Right.
00:36:15.752 - 00:36:39.078, Speaker A: And hopefully we have some really good news to share next year and stuff on that front. So in summary, three different problems. I don't think any of them can be solved at one goal, right. But I think we can inch towards solving each of them individually and hopefully one down the road we are pretty good. Tweet down the road, we are on par and fires. We are winning.
00:36:39.174 - 00:36:39.434, Speaker D: Right?
00:36:39.472 - 00:36:44.986, Speaker A: Yeah. But I definitely see this as long term thing, not a short term thing, which is why I'm very determined.
00:36:45.018 - 00:36:45.166, Speaker D: Right.
00:36:45.188 - 00:36:48.110, Speaker A: Which is why I think everyone keeps asking me when.
00:36:48.260 - 00:36:48.574, Speaker D: Right?
00:36:48.612 - 00:37:09.160, Speaker A: No, but I think for me, I think it's much more important that I communicate that what our goal is and make sure that every step of the way people know what we are doing or thinking about rather than bang, bang, bang, like airdrop launch everything. Right. I make sure that everyone knows kind of where we're going and what our roadmap is.
00:37:11.050 - 00:37:14.520, Speaker E: That's a good segue because talking about when.
00:37:16.730 - 00:37:20.522, Speaker A: Let's go when. Yeah.
00:37:20.576 - 00:37:34.814, Speaker E: So the moment everybody has been waiting for and probably where people will skip to in the timestamp. And so if you're just tuning in, hello. I did ask on Twitter what people.
00:37:34.852 - 00:37:35.454, Speaker B: Want to ask you.
00:37:35.492 - 00:37:49.460, Speaker E: And actually you responded. And one of the things was your philosophy around airdrops launches and when. So what do you think? What is your philosophy around this? What can you tell the djens who are bloodthirsty here?
00:37:50.390 - 00:38:17.242, Speaker A: I love you. I love you. No, seriously, you guys are amazing. I really appreciate all the wins, right? I always say this to my team. I know all this can be frustrating at times, but trust me, the only thing, what? You really don't want no one asking you when, right? People asking you when. It's a great sign, right? That means they want your shit. That's a good thing.
00:38:17.242 - 00:38:30.174, Speaker A: Trust me. So I think for the I love you, everyone. Keep the ranch coming, hopefully. You always ask me when for a long time to come. That's the first thing. Please keep coming. I love you.
00:38:30.212 - 00:38:30.880, Speaker D: All right.
00:38:31.410 - 00:39:00.422, Speaker A: I feel like if you look at the airdrop thing that we did, right, traditionally, airdrop book like this, right? They drop, complain, token go to quit. So it's like done. Everything happens in a week over, right? It's like you bang, you come done over, right? And I'm like, I get it. I get it. It's easy. It's not messy. You just get over done with.
00:39:00.422 - 00:39:46.150, Speaker A: But I'm like, can you want romantic here? Can we be romantic here? Can we just talk about it first? You know what I mean? Can I just have a conversation about it first? I say, hey, we are doing this, right? And then we're like, okay, you know what? Let's do this. How are you going to do this? And then we just talk about it. And that actually summarizes my philosophy. Right? Okay, cool. That's why I think I announced the adrop and we talked about it, and then lots of people get to that and we iterate on. It's something very rare for airdrops. We declared the criteria expressly and told people in the airdrop form what criteria they were under and what they were led to, and we even let them protest.
00:39:46.150 - 00:40:14.960, Speaker A: And then we have 10,000 submissions, by the way. 10,000. And we are going through all of them, obviously doing some machine learning and stuff, but whatever. But we do take it very seriously. So you contrast the other address. You just don't know, right? I've seen so many adrops, people don't know why they got something or why I didn't get something, right. I'm personally positive why for the last few adrops, I didn't get anything or got something.
00:40:14.960 - 00:40:35.766, Speaker A: I feel like I wanted to treat this as engagement, right? I think that's actually my first thing. And that also answers my question about all the wins. Right. I don't really treat the whole token launch thing as like, okay, here we go. But more like, okay, let us talk about it.
00:40:35.788 - 00:40:36.262, Speaker D: Right.
00:40:36.396 - 00:41:07.520, Speaker A: Let me try my best to communicate why I think we should launch this way. And I'm giving enough time to kind of grow together. You know what I'm saying? So, in summary, I think a lot of people are very used to a certain way of doing things right. It's up to us to kind of explain properly that we see this whole token launch process as a journey, not a bang bang bang kind of thing. It's a journey we take together.
00:41:09.650 - 00:41:26.406, Speaker B: A lot of pillow talk. Yeah. You've been very transparent about everything. It's all been on Twitter, too, which is funny how all of this just goes to Twitter, but you've put all the details behind the thinking, and it's been back and forth between the community. It's been really cool to see. I know you're going to have four rounds of airdrops. This first round was eligible to about a million wallets, roughly one stat that stuck out to me.
00:41:26.406 - 00:41:41.354, Speaker B: That thought was interesting, and I'm sure this is true. With every d five protocol is 0.1% of the wallets account for 60% of the volume on Jupiter. And then if you look at 0.2% of the wallets account for 80%. That just sounds absolutely absurd. Are those bots or those whales? What do you think is going on?
00:41:41.472 - 00:41:44.586, Speaker A: Oh, I mean, it's a bunch of things, right? It's a combination of wheels and bots.
00:41:44.698 - 00:41:45.070, Speaker D: Right?
00:41:45.140 - 00:42:04.366, Speaker A: Small bots and wheel bots. You definitely have those. Some of them are doing abbing. Some are doing, like, centralized abbing. Some are doing short decks, Abb, some are doing triangle abbing. Right. To be clear, I think what I said is that we love bots, but we do try to give humans a fair chance.
00:42:04.366 - 00:42:12.738, Speaker A: So we do actually discount boss a bit. But then as part of the discounting of boss, I think some people got really upset because they're like, I'm not a boss, but I got marked as bought.
00:42:12.754 - 00:42:12.886, Speaker D: Right.
00:42:12.908 - 00:42:20.150, Speaker A: So that's actually one of those things that we are doing right now, right. That's just going through all those submissions and figuring out how we can actually improve it and getting back to them.
00:42:20.220 - 00:42:36.382, Speaker B: What was the goal of the airdrop? Because people talk about airdrops in a lot of different ways. You're obviously rewarding past participants. That's great. But that's all like in the past, maybe they come mercenaries, but to you, what is it? And I like also that people have learned maybe don't do all of your airdrop at one time. You actually are going to have four rounds of this.
00:42:36.436 - 00:42:41.102, Speaker A: Yeah. I would just be very clear about something.
00:42:41.156 - 00:42:41.614, Speaker D: Right.
00:42:41.732 - 00:42:48.078, Speaker A: Is that I do actually expect going to be launched sometime during or after the second airdrop.
00:42:48.094 - 00:42:48.226, Speaker D: Right.
00:42:48.248 - 00:42:51.426, Speaker A: So we're doing the first airdrop, we're doing a token sale pretty soon.
00:42:51.528 - 00:42:51.890, Speaker D: Right.
00:42:51.960 - 00:42:54.286, Speaker A: And then I'm going to start the national airdrop.
00:42:54.318 - 00:42:54.562, Speaker D: Right.
00:42:54.616 - 00:43:03.302, Speaker A: And a token will be launched somewhere during or after a second round. So it's not too long.
00:43:03.356 - 00:43:03.526, Speaker D: Right.
00:43:03.548 - 00:43:05.974, Speaker A: So I mean, I like to talk, but not too much.
00:43:06.092 - 00:43:06.760, Speaker D: Right.
00:43:07.290 - 00:43:11.702, Speaker A: So just to set it up. It's not going forever.
00:43:11.766 - 00:43:11.946, Speaker D: Right.
00:43:11.968 - 00:43:22.334, Speaker A: We're just going to do it pretty fast. But yeah, I think going back to a question about the adrop thing, the reason why we did things the way we did.
00:43:22.372 - 00:43:22.574, Speaker D: Right.
00:43:22.612 - 00:43:29.646, Speaker A: Is also because I didn't like how sneakily it had become.
00:43:29.828 - 00:43:30.270, Speaker D: Right.
00:43:30.340 - 00:43:41.554, Speaker A: In some sense. Right. Okay. I think people think of the addressing tool, marketing tool or as something you have to do. We don't see that. Okay. This is true to God.
00:43:41.554 - 00:43:43.774, Speaker A: Right. Whichever God you prefer.
00:43:43.822 - 00:43:43.986, Speaker D: Right.
00:43:44.008 - 00:44:13.418, Speaker A: I'm extremely grateful. I'm extremely grateful to everyone who used Jupiter, who told all their friends about Jupiter and who trusted us for daily know and enabled us to kind of be somewhere. So I see this as a unique once in a lifetime chance. Talk to them about what's important after this. Seriously, the moment, if I don't do it now.
00:44:13.504 - 00:44:14.150, Speaker D: Right.
00:44:14.320 - 00:44:17.390, Speaker A: I can't do it anymore. There's nowhere impact can do later.
00:44:17.540 - 00:44:18.240, Speaker D: Right.
00:44:18.690 - 00:44:43.026, Speaker A: And that's also the reason why we're opening up 1% for the community contributors who contributed to us pre November 2. But again, I think a lot of them have talked about Jupiter in the past, but I haven't had a chance to engage them and to kind of see them. And again, I think I'm telling you, our ad messages, our DMs have exploded right now. Just completely exploded.
00:44:43.058 - 00:44:43.446, Speaker D: Right.
00:44:43.548 - 00:44:46.306, Speaker A: It's impossible for me anymore to keep track anymore.
00:44:46.338 - 00:44:46.582, Speaker D: Right.
00:44:46.636 - 00:44:53.366, Speaker A: But I think there was this course set of people that was still small enough for me to kind of talk to and appreciate.
00:44:53.478 - 00:44:53.898, Speaker D: Right.
00:44:53.984 - 00:45:30.840, Speaker A: So that's the reason why. So that's actually one very big reason why it's going to be a challenge going through everything. In summary, I think we should be a conversation versus the bang and bang. The second thing is that I think once he loses chance, right. We won't get him anymore. So I really want to take a chance to talk to everyone and make sure that even if I can't give them what they want, at least they know that we try. And thirdly is that it's a way for us to have a more personal thank you to everybody involved versus just, hey, Jamie, go away.
00:45:30.840 - 00:45:35.986, Speaker A: Which I feel like characterizes a lot of the antagonism.
00:45:36.098 - 00:45:36.518, Speaker D: Right.
00:45:36.604 - 00:45:43.898, Speaker A: Like, oh, I'm a developer, you're the user. Thanks. Free money. Go. And I don't want that. I want to make sure that everyone feels like, okay, we are here for them. Yeah.
00:45:43.898 - 00:45:45.100, Speaker A: That's the reason.
00:45:45.790 - 00:45:49.660, Speaker E: Yeah, that's how my dad speaks to me. Here's your money. Go away.
00:45:51.710 - 00:45:55.626, Speaker A: How's your girlfriend? That's the opposite.
00:45:55.658 - 00:45:56.560, Speaker E: Give me the money.
00:46:00.210 - 00:46:00.526, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:46:00.548 - 00:46:52.960, Speaker E: So that makes sense. And one thing I'm curious about that I don't think gets talked about a lot is what you've built here is arguably the, and I've tweeted this, I think it's certainly the best aerator in crypto, but I also think it's probably, like, one of the best apps in all of crypto. And I don't even think that's an opinion. I think that's just true. And you talked about your philosophy on this, which is like, okay, we don't even look at the metrics. We just look at, okay, is it the best experience? Is it the best prices? Is it the best in whatever metric you're looking at? So I guess my question is, obviously, there's a lot of founders who listen to this, either people that are crypto founders or specifically defi founders, or maybe people who just want to start their own companies, and you're obviously quite good at it. What advice would you have for them?
00:46:53.670 - 00:47:00.158, Speaker A: It always shows up. It always shows up. Right. Quality always shows up somewhere.
00:47:00.254 - 00:47:00.658, Speaker D: Right.
00:47:00.744 - 00:47:02.318, Speaker A: So it's not so much we do not metrics.
00:47:02.334 - 00:47:02.418, Speaker D: Right.
00:47:02.424 - 00:47:08.146, Speaker A: It's more like if we do poorly, it shows on the metrics. If we do, well, show the metrics.
00:47:08.258 - 00:47:08.678, Speaker D: Right.
00:47:08.764 - 00:47:12.386, Speaker A: I feel like people use the metrics as nostalg.
00:47:12.578 - 00:47:13.126, Speaker D: Right.
00:47:13.228 - 00:47:34.218, Speaker A: But metrics don't tell to do right. Metrics won't tell you that. Okay. You got this very specific button that is not working right. That needs to be fixed. Your metrics won't tell you that 10% of your users got rocked because you didn't reset the sippage setting right after they change a thing and you did reset.
00:47:34.314 - 00:47:34.766, Speaker D: Right.
00:47:34.868 - 00:47:45.302, Speaker A: The metrics won't tell you that you're not offering the best price unless the user going somewhere else right. So they won't tell you these things. Right. What will tell you these things is users.
00:47:45.466 - 00:47:45.938, Speaker D: Right.
00:47:46.024 - 00:47:56.834, Speaker A: So if you are very in tune with the actual problems that users are facing, what do I actually want? And not just in tune, right. But you try your best to improve and get that.
00:47:56.872 - 00:47:57.218, Speaker D: Right.
00:47:57.304 - 00:48:09.766, Speaker A: So in some sense, you almost listen to the user first and you see, okay, hey, I get it. Oh, this is the reason why metrics are that way. So I feel like that's true for a lot of great projects. It's not just crypto, by the way.
00:48:09.788 - 00:48:09.926, Speaker D: Right.
00:48:09.948 - 00:48:39.074, Speaker A: Any kind of project or industry, you see, they have a very keen sense of what people actually want and what people care about, and they make sure that they're alert to when the metrics might show that. But it's all in spirit of the user. So that's how I think about it. That is also how we plan to reach our goals. We can talk about strategy or take all I want, right? But end of the day, I think we will ultimately win by being extremely careful to listen to what people want.
00:48:39.192 - 00:48:39.570, Speaker D: Right.
00:48:39.640 - 00:48:45.426, Speaker A: What do they need and what do they want in order to come here? And that's what we focus on and that's how we get there.
00:48:45.608 - 00:48:56.486, Speaker B: All right, that was beautifully said. Mert just had to drop off, which is a good thing because I'm going to mention l two s, and he goes, oh, my God, he goes into Hulk mode. Anytime we talk about l two s, I want to know.
00:48:56.668 - 00:49:15.790, Speaker A: It's amazing. Please keep this part in the chat because I think I'm so inspired by, holy shit. Every time I feel I'm afraid to share opinion, I just open Twitter. I get inspired. Okay, let's go. Please leave this in. I want you to hear that.
00:49:15.860 - 00:49:19.950, Speaker B: I will leave it in. I wouldn't say it to his face, but I'm lucky to have him as a co host.
00:49:21.490 - 00:49:24.654, Speaker A: His ego is really this big. Just keep it up.
00:49:24.852 - 00:49:38.120, Speaker B: Every ecosystem needs a mert and it is true. People see him on Twitter and if you don't know who Mert is, like, eversoft, and they're like, oh, it's just this really aggressive guy that constantly comes out across against ethereum and it's like, that's not really who he is. He's also really informed, which makes a big difference between.
00:49:38.730 - 00:50:03.418, Speaker A: And we work with him on Helix, right? And he really cares, too. It's awesome working with him because he cares about details, he care about new setup, he brings on stuff mean. He's not just a great ecosystem guy, he's a good product guy. Great founder, too, right? And then him and Triton, both of them on the RPC side. That's great because just great founders, they're just amazing thousands.
00:50:03.434 - 00:50:03.614, Speaker D: Mr.
00:50:03.652 - 00:50:19.866, Speaker B: Degree, you got to make people care. Mert makes people care. Okay, let's get to l two s. So you used to work in the Ethereum community. You're obviously in Salana full time and built the most successful app in Salana. What do you think about l two s right now? There are multiple l two s you can choose from. They probably have grants.
00:50:19.866 - 00:50:30.200, Speaker B: They also have, obviously, l two s, to me, are going to work in the future. There are training wells right now versus something like Salana is your honest take, maybe not just your Twitter hostile takeover take.
00:50:31.130 - 00:50:34.146, Speaker A: My honest take is that I don't want to speak about success or failure.
00:50:34.178 - 00:50:34.470, Speaker D: Right.
00:50:34.540 - 00:50:36.998, Speaker A: I want to speak about the future I want.
00:50:37.164 - 00:50:37.880, Speaker D: Right.
00:50:41.150 - 00:50:57.786, Speaker A: I don't really want a future whereby we are incestantly spinning out new l tools that don't necessarily add anything to the space. In fact, they might make it worse.
00:50:57.818 - 00:50:57.966, Speaker D: Right.
00:50:57.988 - 00:51:01.834, Speaker A: Because fragmentation is very good, because you get innovation.
00:51:01.882 - 00:51:02.094, Speaker D: Right.
00:51:02.132 - 00:51:35.066, Speaker A: But I don't really think that we are going to see lt at innovation. That is my fundamental thing. If l twos break out and they add new innovation, that is great, right. But I don't think that's going to happen. I think what I seen more and more is out to become almost a cynical place, is a way for me to have a new token, have a way for me to kind of have more, have my own whatever, right. And I don't think that's. I will speak to that.
00:51:35.066 - 00:51:51.486, Speaker A: Certainly it has been a great way to do, well, creation, capital creation. But it's just not the future I want. Yeah. The future I want is one where we have critical mass. The Internet is critical mass.
00:51:51.508 - 00:51:51.598, Speaker D: Right.
00:51:51.604 - 00:51:57.970, Speaker A: I mean, for example, think about if your grandma and you use different Internet, right? You can't talk.
00:51:58.040 - 00:51:58.660, Speaker D: Right.
00:52:00.390 - 00:52:30.880, Speaker A: The reason why Internet works, that you and me are talking on one network. That's why it works. And I wonder, for blockchains, right. And I think that's actually really important for blockchains. I think that's going back to what I said way earlier. I think that's how payments can work, how business can work, how a truly seamless system to market can work. And that is how some interpreter can work when you can do a single transaction that cuts across like seven, eight markets, interchange that with a payment transaction or something.
00:52:30.880 - 00:52:40.730, Speaker A: So I want that future because that single network future is one where I think we get much closer to the promise of the decentralization.
00:52:40.810 - 00:52:41.440, Speaker D: Right?
00:52:42.610 - 00:52:48.850, Speaker A: Again, I love Ethereum. I respect alter the scaling solution for Ethereum.
00:52:49.350 - 00:52:50.146, Speaker D: Right.
00:52:50.328 - 00:53:26.330, Speaker A: But that is not the future I think brings us closer to where we want to be. I think a lot of the city conversation become quite Macky, and I personally don't really lean there. But what I lean extremely strongly towards is the idea that, okay, we got to keep in mind what the end goal is. And to me the end goal is around having one network that we can all transact seamlessly on. And then not to say there won't be other networks. Right. But I do actually think that having a network that we have as many people on as possible would be extremely helpful for moving the world forward to a decent transition.
00:53:26.330 - 00:53:28.638, Speaker A: And that's the world I want.
00:53:28.804 - 00:53:59.318, Speaker B: Yeah, I couldn't agree more. If you have so many l two s, like you see this on Coinbase's wallet right now, there's a drop down, you can select which l two you want to go to. It's pretty confusing, right. So you'd really have to have some really high level abstractions that the average user never knows what they're interacting with. Defaults are really important, even if it's very easy to switch networks, programs, whatever it might be. And a good example of that is how Google pays apple $20 billion to be the default search engine for Safari. And it's not that you don't have to use Google search engine on Safari, it's just the default and they pay for that.
00:53:59.318 - 00:54:12.110, Speaker B: But a user could easily go in and just switch it to another network or another search engine. They just don't. Because users just want to do what's easy with the lowest amount of friction. And that's something like what salon offers versus when you have this world of multiple l two s, it starts getting pretty confusing.
00:54:12.530 - 00:54:13.934, Speaker A: If you don't mind me jumping a little bit.
00:54:13.972 - 00:54:14.174, Speaker D: Right.
00:54:14.212 - 00:54:36.494, Speaker A: I actually definitely see a world where, I mean, I come from multichain background, right? And actually over the last year I've also been dabbling in a lot of multichain research as well. And then I also did WBTC, so I'm pretty used to figuring out multicolored stuff. And these days I'm working a lot. Wormhole and debris and all the other awesome, like all the other CCt as well.
00:54:36.552 - 00:54:36.918, Speaker D: Right?
00:54:37.004 - 00:54:47.506, Speaker A: So I definitely do see a world where it is possible that Solana become the universal abstraction layer for everything, for all. It's been changed.
00:54:47.538 - 00:54:48.118, Speaker D: Right.
00:54:48.284 - 00:54:51.674, Speaker A: It kind of makes sense because if you look at the, it kind of makes sense even look at outside at once.
00:54:51.712 - 00:54:51.818, Speaker D: Right?
00:54:51.824 - 00:55:09.438, Speaker A: What's different anyway, right? It's just basically a breach. It's definitely not my focus area right now, but I definitely would be very interested to figure this out sometime next year or something. But in summary, who knows, right? Maybe Solana could actually become that universal layer. That could be really cool.
00:55:09.524 - 00:55:10.590, Speaker B: Sounds bullish.
00:55:10.930 - 00:55:12.206, Speaker A: I'm very bullish here.
00:55:12.308 - 00:55:49.500, Speaker B: Okay, I've got two quick tactical questions and then one question. We'll close it out. I was thinking about this earlier, and what's really cool about Jupiter is it routes one trade, it could be a $1 trade across multiple markets if it's for the best price. Right. When you do that, if it's going across Dexes, for example, that haven't launched a token or they're going to in the future, are those users then potentially eligible for those airdrops? From those separate know, airdrops are often based on prior usage. But if the user is coming to Jupiter, can those other projects also identify the wallet that's making that trade on Jupiter? Say, oh, they've actually routed trades through us, we're going to give them an airdrop in the future?
00:55:50.270 - 00:56:17.586, Speaker A: Yeah, certainly that's been the mean. We do it in a very friendly way. We do it in a very friendly way. If you transact through Jupiter through anything else, by the way, people don't use Jupiter through Jupyter directly. I mean, a lot of people use Jupiter through wallets and other apps, everything, right? So we don't treat them separately. We try way that doesn't matter what interface is, we treat equally. And certainly other projects can do whatever they want.
00:56:17.586 - 00:56:57.540, Speaker A: But I would say this, I think the way we do it is that for them, if you are new Dex, you don't pay us anything, right? We work our ass off to make sure that you get into Jupiter and you get all the retail flow, volume flow, everything, right? So it will be a bit mean if you don't pay the favor for us, whereas we do. But that's not all my control. I think what is in our control is that we just try to do the best for the user. But if you don't do the best for our users, then it gets to be awkward in Singapore. But for now we have the problem. We work really hard to make sure that we have a win win situation, everybody. I think people see that.
00:56:57.910 - 00:57:43.234, Speaker B: Okay, one more question on this aggregation theory that I like to talk about a lot. With Jupiter, you've become in some ways the front end of Solana, and I won't make you say that, but that's how I feel. But it's very much grow the pie, as you like to say, because you're bringing in new users and you're giving access to all these different protocols, not just what's on Jupiter. My feeling is though, in the future, having that front end, being the aggregator is very powerful and it's a great position to be in. Could you ever see another project, say there was like a uniswap style project that also had a lot of demand on Solana and they wanted users to go directly to their amm to their decks, not to Jupiter. Is there an easy way for them to cut off access to Jupiter where Jupiter can't route trades through their decks? Amm, is that possible? And do you see that future happening?
00:57:43.432 - 00:58:34.240, Speaker A: I mean, it's definitely possible. And it would be just a bit counterintuitive because then they have to offer better rates than everybody else or we can spin up our own thing and have more liquidity or something. That's one of those things that, first of all, it's one of those things that I think we don't think about that much. I understand where that concern comes from. I think our main thing is just to make sure that we are as ecosystem friendly as possible. Yeah, that's how thing about it, if you ever see us doing things that not right for the users or the ecosystem, it'll be pretty obvious.
00:58:35.570 - 00:58:53.110, Speaker B: I know it's different. But Jupiter does remind me a bit of stripe. Not only because you have like a plugin that different apps can use to do swaps, but also, I think stripes, their statement, or used to be it, was to grow the GDP of the Internet. And to me, Jupiter's goal is to grow the GDP of Swana. And so I just see the overlapping things of crypto and crypto.
00:58:53.850 - 00:59:21.630, Speaker A: We think the crypto, we think crypto GDP of crypto right now is like zero point or what it can be. And I will circle back to the whole l two thing, is that I'm very upset that we are not growing the GDP of crypto. We're just creating more insider games, really bring more people in. You know what I'm saying? I just say that I don't take anything for Jack Garrett. It's important.
00:59:21.700 - 00:59:22.320, Speaker D: Okay.
00:59:23.330 - 00:59:29.902, Speaker A: The really beautiful thing about the decentralized world, right, is that I don't hold the customers funds. Jupiter doesn't hold the customer's funds.
00:59:29.966 - 00:59:30.482, Speaker D: Right.
00:59:30.616 - 01:00:05.918, Speaker A: We literally have no lock. We have zero lock, only thing. So it's the thing about it, right. The only thing that there's no way we can be powerful, literally, because we don't hold anything, we can't even control anything, right. And that's actually what I love about decentralized world, right. Because it doesn't matter how big Jupiter gets, we have no login. Literally, the moment we stop doing the best, the moment we stop providing value, the moment we start doing anything that's counter user, we die, who's not zero.
01:00:06.084 - 01:00:06.558, Speaker D: Right.
01:00:06.644 - 01:00:17.442, Speaker A: So I feel like that's actually one really important thing to understand as you talk about things like that, because I think that's actually one really important thing about decentralized world.
01:00:17.496 - 01:00:18.100, Speaker D: Right.
01:00:19.190 - 01:00:20.530, Speaker A: Your lock in is very different.
01:00:20.600 - 01:00:21.220, Speaker D: Right.
01:00:22.870 - 01:00:26.466, Speaker A: Your lock in is really about value and community and vibes and trust.
01:00:26.568 - 01:00:26.834, Speaker D: Right.
01:00:26.872 - 01:00:33.618, Speaker A: And much, much less about. Okay, like using vendor power or custody or barrel to entry or barrier to exit.
01:00:33.714 - 01:00:34.214, Speaker D: Right.
01:00:34.332 - 01:00:35.382, Speaker A: No such thing.
01:00:35.516 - 01:00:35.814, Speaker D: Right.
01:00:35.852 - 01:00:38.502, Speaker A: So I think that's actually one really big difference there.
01:00:38.556 - 01:01:04.962, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. I mean, you see this with Internet service providers, for example, they could have a monopoly in the sense that they actually have cables that go into your house, right? So that's like a supply side constraint. But then you have something like Amazon, there really is no constraint. Like anybody can just go into Google and go to another website. So it's not that they have some supply side constraint, but just the user experience is so good that users pick it and it's a great position to be in, but it's not because they have some lock in, it's just a better product.
01:01:05.096 - 01:01:14.930, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think that's really important. So it really compels us to how do we keep on providing the best user experience.
01:01:15.000 - 01:01:15.186, Speaker D: Right.
01:01:15.208 - 01:01:19.366, Speaker A: And the best products. Right. And I think that's very important.
01:01:19.548 - 01:01:27.030, Speaker B: So on that, and we'll do this as the last question. What are you most excited about just over the next twelve months for Jupiter or Salana or crypto.
01:01:29.850 - 01:01:53.866, Speaker A: Pie? I go back to my, what I always say, growing pie, because I feel like, oh, my God, it has been more than how many years? 15 years since you contacted? 15 years. I think that we are finally at. I mean, it's a long time, but a really fucking short time. Right. I've been involved in that for six, seven years. I think we are really starting to see the user experience and everything being able to be as good as centralized exchanges.
01:01:53.898 - 01:01:54.190, Speaker D: Right.
01:01:54.260 - 01:01:59.630, Speaker A: You know what I'm saying? I think over the next two or three years and stuff, we're going to see the gap really start closing.
01:01:59.790 - 01:02:00.162, Speaker D: Right.
01:02:00.216 - 01:02:29.594, Speaker A: And as I mentioned, before when we start closing a gap and capital starts being used in Dexes where it can be used on chain, then everything happened. Then we would see remittances, payments, games, social networks, and all that kind of good stuff they wanted happen. And I think I'm really excited that we had the chance to be part of that and potentially pioneer a lot of that, hopefully, right?
01:02:29.632 - 01:02:29.786, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:02:29.808 - 01:02:36.560, Speaker A: So that's what I'm the most excited about. I've been waiting for a very long time for.
01:02:37.490 - 01:02:52.606, Speaker B: Well, thanks for coming on, man. Jupiter is such an exciting product. I love not only Jupyter itself and how easy it's made interacting with Solana, the grow the pie, but also just your energy and positivity. A lot of crypto needs that. I'm not trying to take away all of the back and forth between different communities. It's kind of fun. It's just like sports.
01:02:52.606 - 01:02:57.634, Speaker B: But we thank you so much for coming on. This is an unbelievable episode.
01:02:57.762 - 01:03:07.078, Speaker A: No, but yeah. Thank you so much for having me, man. Really great. Really love everything you like. Everything, so. Yeah, thank you.
01:03:07.164 - 01:03:07.414, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:03:07.452 - 01:03:07.894, Speaker A: Well, thank you.
