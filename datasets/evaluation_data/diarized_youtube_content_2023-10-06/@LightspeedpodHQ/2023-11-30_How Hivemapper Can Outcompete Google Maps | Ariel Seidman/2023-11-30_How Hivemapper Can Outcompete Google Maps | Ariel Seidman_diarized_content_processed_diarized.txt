00:00:00.170 - 00:00:21.658, Speaker A: You know, if you look at Google Maps, why did it become so dominant on the business side? Well, they had all these customers that are already using them on the consumer side, that is the big unlock there. You get into consumers'lives, you get into hundreds of millions of consumers'lives, then the business side actually becomes easier and easier. You're getting lead generation for people who are just kind of pulling you into their organization.
00:00:21.754 - 00:00:37.766, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by Das London Blockworks number one institution crypto conference, where all the top institutions and people in crypto are going to be this march in London, what's becoming maybe the crypto hub of the world. Have a link in the show notes where you can learn more and also discount code that will get you 20% off. So click the link, find out more and I'll see you.
00:00:37.788 - 00:00:45.130, Speaker A: There's what's up, everybody.
00:00:45.200 - 00:00:51.626, Speaker B: Welcome to another episode of Lightspeed. Today we're joined by Ariel, who is the co founder and CEO of Hive Mapper. Ariel, welcome to the show.
00:00:51.728 - 00:00:53.178, Speaker A: Thank you for having me, guys.
00:00:53.344 - 00:01:13.806, Speaker B: Yeah, we're pumped to have you on. So hive Mapper is a new way to make maps across the world that's leveraging crypto. You've absolutely killed it. You have over 6 million mile unique miles mapped, which is about like 10% of the world's streets, and you have over 25,000 contributors. And those are drivers and also people that are assisting on the AI process. And all those metrics are in just one year. So the traction is absolutely incredible.
00:01:13.806 - 00:01:23.718, Speaker B: But before we get into that and the details and the business strategy, I want to start with the history of hype Mapper, because similar to helium, you launched several years ago without a crypto component. So I'd love to get some on that. And the origin story.
00:01:23.884 - 00:01:59.634, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it's definitely been this fun, long, winding road that's also been painful at moments. And so I'll just take you back to really my first job out of school, which was Yahoo. Like 2005, 2006 time frame. And so I landed in the Yahoo. Search group at the time. And it was actually a really fun time to be at Yahoo because we were very competitive with Google, right. We had about 30, 35% market share in search, which was like a core product and just a very highly monetizable product.
00:01:59.634 - 00:02:53.474, Speaker A: We obviously had Yahoo Mail, so I looked after all of kind of all the local data because about 30% of all queries coming into Yahoo search at the time had some sort of local geography mapping component to them. So it's a very large percentage of searches when you're talking about billions upon billions of searches every single day. And so what happened was I started to really understand a, how costly it was to build up these very valuable data sets and how you had to actually physically be out in the world. And so what started to happen was Google, with their Google Tree View program and other data collection programs, started to actually build their own data. So they weren't just licensing data, they were building their own data. And that's when they started to really pull away from Yahoo. Maps and some of our other products in the local data side.
00:02:53.474 - 00:03:58.322, Speaker A: And I was, you know, we went to the executive team at Yahoo, and we're like, we need to pony up, right? We need to plow hundreds of millions of dollars to compete with these. You know, unfortunately, they weren't interested in retrospect, obviously, big mistake. But what it left me, I left Yahoo because that's not my deal. And I started my first company with this idea of, if you can lower the cost of collecting this data and maintaining a certain level of quality, then you have something really compelling, because a lot of the mapping approaches historically have either been very costly, like Google Stream, and therefore you cannot refresh them. You have to have very highly monetizable data products, or you're just kind of like giving it away for free and trying to make your money elsewhere. Right? Or you go the full crowdsource approach. But in the full crowdsource approach, what usually happens is the quality bar starts to drop pretty dramatically.
00:03:58.322 - 00:04:38.242, Speaker A: And so the number of use cases and applications for the data starts to also drop. And so the sweet spot there is, how do you collect data that is both high quality but also low cost and do that at scale? So my first company was called Gigwalk. About two or 3 million people all over the world collecting data with their iPhones, Android devices. This is like 2010. We scaled that to about 2 million contributors all over the world. There were some fundamental business problems, business model problems that we never really tackled. So it was like a single, like, in Silicon Valley terms, it's like a single 2015 came around.
00:04:38.242 - 00:05:15.026, Speaker A: I was like, okay, we're going to do this, and we're going to do this right. And the way you do this, initially, what we thought in 2015 was drones. Okay, we want to build a map of the world. We're going to use drones. Drones seemed to have a very unique capability, which was they could both see from above. So you got the aerial map view, but they fly low enough below the cloud cover that you can also see not all but many of the kind of the street level navigational components, like stop signs and traffic lights and turn restriction signs and all that kind of stuff. So that is true.
00:05:15.026 - 00:05:46.890, Speaker A: But the problem with drones was that they didn't scale. The battery technology never really improved. So, like, a drone that you bought in 2015 that could fly for 25 minutes, maybe that same drone at that same price point today can fly for 35 minutes. You need a drone that can literally fly for six, seven, 8 hours at a time to really scale out on a global level. And then the other was just local regulation. The regulation between San Francisco and Oakland was totally different. So we put that to the side, and we said, okay, we're going to go street level.
00:05:46.890 - 00:06:09.986, Speaker A: We started off with iPhone Android devices that didn't work. The churn was very high, and the positioning technology in the iPhone Android device wasn't very good. So we thought you were here. You're actually, like, four blocks away. The thing overheated in the middle of the desert. Like you're driving around in Phoenix, Arizona. The thing would literally turn off into, like, 20 minutes.
00:06:09.986 - 00:06:40.134, Speaker A: So then we said, okay, let's go use a dash cam. And we use a third party dash cam at first, and that actually had much better retention. Right. So driver would stay with us longer. But fundamentally, the positioning technology was kind of subpar, and it did not have good APIs. So we were, like, literally hacking into these third party dash cams, and we go to these dash cam manufacturers and be like, hey, we need this and this and this and this. And they'd be like, sure, put an order in for, like, 20,000 dash cams.
00:06:40.134 - 00:07:08.382, Speaker A: And we had, like, $4 million in the bank, $5 million in the bank. They were like, no, we can't do that. So we started building our own dash cam. This is, by the way, before we pivoted into crypto and before we raised our series a for $18 million, we started to build our own. We actually had a customer who was, like, effectively funding that. Right? And so we knew a lot of the challenges associated with it. And then I reached out to Amir.
00:07:08.382 - 00:07:40.858, Speaker A: Amir was kind enough to take the call from me, and I showed him kind of what we're building, and we actually had real customers and real things. And he's like, that's pretty cool. I'm happy to help you in any way I can in terms of, as you kind of navigate this crypto, because I thought that component that they added in terms of crypto was just incredibly smart, incredibly clever for a lot of reasons. We can go into. And then he introduced me to Anatole and then kind of, the rest is history, I guess. And we raised 18 million. And then we kind of build out the real dash Camry.
00:07:40.858 - 00:07:53.140, Speaker A: We start to sell. Getting it from a prototype version, which is effectively what we had to like a real device that was incredibly challenging, very painful, but we did it. So cool.
00:07:53.510 - 00:08:20.380, Speaker C: Can you maybe walk us through in more, zoomed in detail on what the discovery process was for crypto? Right. So you have this business that's already. I mean, you're a repeat founder. You have an idea, and then now you're kind of looking for this final piece. And then it seems like you probably just saw how Amir and helium did it. Was that kind of the inspiration? How did you even think about going to.
00:08:22.110 - 00:08:47.474, Speaker A: Some fun? We were paying people in. Paying people. And we had some issues with that. One was sending the cash places like Nigeria. Literally, our business operations person would have to go down to the bank, get, like, photographed, fingerprinted, provide her passport. I mean, it was just kind of crazy just to send like $100 or $200 to Nigeria every single time. And it was very costly as well.
00:08:47.474 - 00:09:22.080, Speaker A: And then people like, in the Philippines started to ask us, like, hey, can you just pay us in crypto? It's easier that way. And we're like, oh, that's interesting. And so that was kind of like, probably set off the initial, like, okay, there has to be an easier way here. And I'm not like, I mean, I've owned Ethereum for a long time now, but I'm not religious about crypto. I know as we get into these crypto communities, people are fundamentalist about it in a way. I'm not one of those, but I'm obviously very curious. I was very curious by the know enough to buy.
00:09:22.080 - 00:09:49.814, Speaker A: So that was step number one or issue number one that we had to solve. Issue number two, know we're effectively competing with somebody like Google Maps, right? And so we felt like, okay, if we're paying somebody, let's just make it. We have these tiles, and if you map them, you would earn $0.05. Okay, something like that. And I was like, okay, let's play this out here. If we play this out, this really works. Well, Google has sitting on $120,000,000,000 of cash.
00:09:49.814 - 00:10:23.570, Speaker A: They can pay somebody $0.25, right? And then all those people are really like, okay, like, screw hive mapper. I'm only getting paid $0.05. I'm going to go to felt like with crypto and what I started to see with helium was there was this. I participate in the economics of this project in a way that is beyond just transactional. Right. And I think that was, like, very deeper emotional connection to the project than just getting paid five cents per tile.
00:10:23.570 - 00:10:49.834, Speaker A: And a lot of people that we have, this is proven out, which is a lot of the people. Like, right now, you have to install the dash cam, and the only thing you really have to do is you have to mount it properly. Okay? So you obviously have to be looking at the road. You can't be looking up at the sky, or you can't be looking down at nothing at the dashboard or something like that. So you have to obviously look new around. So it takes about, like, maybe five minutes to optimize that. Maybe a little bit less.
00:10:49.834 - 00:11:17.410, Speaker A: And so when we were paying people cash, people did not care at all, like, gave no shits. Sorry, excuse my language. And it was really frustrating. It was like, look, you're not getting paid because your dash cam is like looking at the sky. And they would yell at us and tell us we're a scam and blah, blah, blah and all this kind of stuff, and we're like, no, literally, it's looking at the sky. You're not mapping the road. And we show them evidence.
00:11:17.410 - 00:12:02.020, Speaker A: Now, with the high mapper community that exists today, people will go to great length and try to help each other to make sure that the mountain is correct. And so it's just like this different emotional feeling that people have because they feel they're a stakeholder in this project. They want to see the thing succeed in a way that simply didn't exist. And I think really tapping into that is critical if you can do it, because it's beyond just the transaction. Right. Like, if Google were to go and copy what we're doing today. Well, no, people really are invested in the idea, the concept of building something new from scratch and participating in the economics associated with that.
00:12:02.950 - 00:12:47.010, Speaker C: Yeah, that's very underrated. And a lot of people talk about dows and communities, but deepin decentralized physical infra networks are probably the best instance of dows that I'm aware of. Same with helium and now high Mapper, where you kind of get the token has an effect on people to, it's like equity in a company. Obviously not exactly like that, but there's something interesting there. So, okay, that's kind of the founding story and how you guys came to be where you are today. For people who are unfamiliar, just listening to this for the first time, could you maybe just explain exactly how this would work from kind of both sides. One, if you're a driver, and then two, if you're maybe somebody interested in the mapping data.
00:12:47.080 - 00:13:04.406, Speaker A: Yeah, I was going to mention that in the beginning, and I kind of failed to hit that point. It's a critical point. Okay, so we're mapping the world. We're focused on street level maps, so we're not focused on, like, satellite or anything like that. And so what does that mean? So you buy this dash cam. There's two different models. One is like, I think, about $250.
00:13:04.406 - 00:13:31.760, Speaker A: And then the other one, I think, is a little bit pricier. It's like 500 or 450 now with a discount. And you install the dash cam in your car. You can either install it front facing, or you can do side facing as well. And you connect it to this app. And then you just drive, right? You just drive like you normally do. So we don't ask you to drive specific routes or anything like that.
00:13:31.760 - 00:13:56.520, Speaker A: And whatever. Your driving patterns are great if you drive like a bus. In other words, all you do all day long is go up and down Broadway. It's not going to be very effective. Right. And so we're really looking for people who definitely have a little bit more diversity than just going to Starbucks every morning and back home. And we can go a little bit more into why that is.
00:13:56.520 - 00:14:36.450, Speaker A: And so that's one mode of contribution. There's another mode of contribution called AI training. You do not need a dash cam. All you need is a phone or a computer. And there you're effectively training the map AI systems that actually extract out all of the different features of the map. So, for example, we think something is a 25 miles per hour speed limit sign that is located in this position. At this precise location, you're effectively helping us determine, a, is this really a 25 miles per hour speed limit sign? And then B, is it actually correctly positioned at this location? And so by doing that, you're training the AI systems to improve and improve, improve.
00:14:36.450 - 00:15:38.840, Speaker A: And so those are the two modes of contribution. Then what do we do? Who's using the map? There are real customers today using the map. There's a set of mapping APIs that we provide. So there's one which is a very basic map image API where customers are ingesting all the image, this geolocated imagery that's incredibly fresh, and they're utilizing it in their own data products or supplementing their existing data products. And there are customers using that product, and there's customers, they're using the map features product. Map features is effectively like, hey, I want to know about all the speed limit signs, all the stop signs, all the churn restriction signs, all the construction road work, et cetera, that is happening in this location or the entire United States or wherever it may be. There will be other data products that will add over are really, if you kind of take a step back and you say, okay, who are the big customers of all this data? So Google has all their API products, billions of dollars, millions of millions of customers.
00:15:38.840 - 00:16:16.066, Speaker A: I know a ride sharing company, not called Uber, not here in the United States actually, who spends $25 to $30 million per year on Google Maps APIs. Right? So it is a big revenue driver, is all the business customers that are consuming and utilizing these APIs in various ways. They're very costly. And we think that we can not only compete on lower cost, but also much fresher. Right. Fundamentally hive Mapper, because we're so much lower cost, we're seeing a given location 30 to 50 times more frequently than Google. That is not an exaggeration.
00:16:16.066 - 00:16:57.054, Speaker A: Google will see a location like downtown San Francisco, maybe once every twelve months, maybe suburban Austin, maybe every two to four years, places outside the United States and kind of more suburban, if they've seen it at all, maybe every eight to ten years. So we're just going to be a lot fresher. And this is the history of all technology, right. Which is fundamentally, people want the freshest thing. The freshest thing is the most accurate thing. And Google is a little bit hamstrung because of their very costly approach to building these maps, utilizing these Google Street View cards, which are inherently expensive. Yeah.
00:16:57.092 - 00:17:05.906, Speaker B: Ariel, so would you say that freshness is probably the killer feature of Hive Mapper? And then with that, can you maybe explain what burst is? I think it's a new feature that you guys have.
00:17:05.928 - 00:17:26.202, Speaker A: It's really cool. Yeah. Yes. Freshness is definitely the killer feature. I would also say that as the network expands in year two and year three, so we're only in year one, that coverage will also become a killer feature. We can go see places that Google doesn't see. Right.
00:17:26.202 - 00:18:10.230, Speaker A: Because ours are connected to just regular cars. They're not Google preview cars. And so places like Kazakhstan or places like rural Brazil, that fundamentally you're not going to ship a Google preview card to Brazil for six months and then have it go to some small little town in like. That's just not a good use of that asset. You're going to focus it on Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, right? And so, yes, over time, it's also going to be coverage as well. We're already hearing that from some customers who are being like, oh, you have this town in Romania, right? That was never a thing that we could imagine. Okay, burst basically a lot.
00:18:10.230 - 00:18:48.034, Speaker A: Like right now, all driving is passive. You just drive like you normally do. There's this thing that we just introduced about three or four months ago, which is called a burst. A customer determines where to place a burst. And what they're really saying is, I want this location to be know new, freshly, or there's no coverage there. And I would like to have coverage, and I'm willing to pay a little bit more for it. So basically, you can go open up the apps in some cities, like Phoenix, Arizona and Houston and some others, and you will see some of these burst, and it's quite phenomenal.
00:18:48.034 - 00:19:24.494, Speaker A: Like one customer said to us, hey, you got to achieve at least 90% completion rate. And their version of completion rate was that we were seeing their locations at least twice a week. We hit 99%, and they were like, we don't believe it. So it works. It works phenomenally well. And really there, it's like, look, if you're in the neighborhood and you can just make a right hand turn versus making a left hand turn and maybe spend an extra five minutes, it could be worth your know, that's really up to the driver. Yeah.
00:19:24.532 - 00:19:53.154, Speaker B: When I first heard of Bursa, made me think of two things one had to do with. Maybe this is a use case you support today. I'm not sure. Say a private equity fund is investing in Costco's or they want to. You could potentially have, that firm could actually pay to have that area mapped to see how many cars in the parking lot that might be a little far fetched. And then the other one is Pokemon go, which I know you're a big fan of. If you think about maybe you would have some stores that could actually pay Pokemon go, maybe they're coffee shops in a certain area to bring in more Pokemon in that area to attract a certain type of clientele.
00:19:53.202 - 00:19:53.318, Speaker A: Right.
00:19:53.324 - 00:19:58.442, Speaker B: And they could actually burst that to get traffic. And you could do the same thing with Hive Mapper. Just different use case.
00:19:58.576 - 00:20:30.470, Speaker A: Yeah, no, for sure. I think as it gets bigger, as the community gets bigger, those types of opportunities, like, we hear that a lot because a lot of the people who drive for Hivemapper today, they're uber drivers, they're Lyft drivers, they're truck drivers, they're delivery drivers. And what we hear from them is their job, I think, has a lot of meaning. Right. They're providing really essential products and services to people every single day, but it can become monotonous. Right. And so this adds, like, a layer of fun, a layer of discovery, a layer of purpose.
00:20:30.470 - 00:21:09.314, Speaker A: And I think a lot of the things that you mentioned there before speak to some of that, like, okay, I'm helping another business. I'm helping this map grow. I'm helping this community. And so you're starting to see that. But, yeah, going back to the private equity, what we started to hear is that if you're in the real estate investment business, before you start to buy a property, you want to know everything about it, right? And so, yeah, of course, you pull up Google's preview and you pull up Google satellite and whatever, but you really want to understand what this place looks like week after week. And maybe you want to look at it like what's happening on a Tuesday versus a Friday. Right.
00:21:09.314 - 00:21:25.542, Speaker A: And that's a very valuable data. And so we're starting to build out the tools. It's called scout, where you can do that more easily. Right. It's just a really optimized UI to enable those kinds of folks to be able to quickly do that kind of stuff.
00:21:25.676 - 00:21:52.602, Speaker B: Quick break to tell you about an upcoming event, I promise you don't want to miss. It's blockwork's biggest and best institutional conference, called Das London. It's a two day event happening in London this March where we're going to have over 700 institutions, 130 speakers, and a couple of thousand of us all under one roof. Crypto is in a position for the first time to actually onboard these institutions, and they're showing up. We have companies from Blackrock to visa launching real products in the space. We have the real world asset narrative taking off. We have things like payments that have been exponentially growing, and then we have things like deepen happening in the Solana ecosystem.
00:21:52.602 - 00:22:15.026, Speaker B: There's a ton of capital right now in this institutional space that's going to be coming on chain. It's going to completely change the industry. Whether you are an institution or you're a retail user, or you just want to learn more about what's going on in the space, this conference is for you. You're going to be able to meet some of the best and smart as people in the space. The speaker lineup is absolutely incredible, and you'll get to hang out with me. But the best part is you actually get 20% off your ticket if you use Lightspeed 20 when checking out that's light speed 20. I put a link in the show notes.
00:22:15.026 - 00:22:23.306, Speaker B: I recommend buying this today because, one, you'll forget about it. Two, these ticket prices go up every single month. So anyways, I hope to see you there. Now let's get back to the show.
00:22:23.408 - 00:22:43.214, Speaker C: I'm curious on maybe if I put on my founder hat a little bit. On maybe your strategy overall as you look to expand the business. And what I mean by that is what level you have. Kind of the bottom of the layer, which is providing raw mapping data, and there's things you can build on top.
00:22:43.252 - 00:22:43.406, Speaker A: Right?
00:22:43.428 - 00:23:20.406, Speaker C: So, for example, you mentioned freshness of data that I could see being super useful for, like a GPS app, because in the streets of Toronto, roads get closed all the time. Waze or Google Maps doesn't update it, and I get rugged instantly by my GPS, and I have to do all those things. And it could be pretty cool for me to use this as part of my maybe driving app or something like that. Or I could even see from a business point of view, like, let's say I'm a car manufacturer like Ford, and maybe I want to partner with you guys and tell my purchasers, hey, you guys will actually alter crypto if you buy this car if you're in some weird area that doesn't have much coverage.
00:23:20.518 - 00:23:23.306, Speaker A: So I guess all that is to say, what do you see?
00:23:23.328 - 00:23:35.620, Speaker C: High mappers role in the next five years as you guys grow and cover more of the world? Is it going to be just fundamentally focused on the raw data part, or is it going to be more like picking certain verticals and doubling down on those?
00:23:36.310 - 00:24:07.340, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think there's three major segments. From a customer perspective, there is kind of the traditional data, which I think you alluded to, which I think we have paying customers in that segment today. And at the end of the day, though, it's usually a human being utilizing the data in some form or another. Right. So, for example, we have a customer today who's the ultimate consumer of the data is an analyst. Okay.
00:24:07.340 - 00:24:41.430, Speaker A: And we have other customers today that, again, it's kind of like these map editors, whatever, but fundamentally, it's a human. Then there's another customer group, which is robotaxis and ADAS. ADAS basically stands for advanced driver systems. Ford has their product called Blue Cruise, and they charge $800 a year for it. So not all the cars have all the sensor package that can do it, but it basically takes over driving in certain situations. So highways and major arterial roads and stuff like that. I think that is a very compelling product, quite frankly.
00:24:41.430 - 00:25:17.950, Speaker A: And then there's a third customer segment group, which is the consumer, the navigation app experience. For that, you obviously need scale, right? You need all the layers of the map. So you need beyond just the layers that we have today, you need to continue to build more and more layers. So you need places, you need traffic, you need all these additional layers that would build out over time. So the way we're looking at it is the first one, we can satisfy that today, and we have customers in that group. The second group is we can also satisfy their requirements today, and we're going after them. We're going after them aggressively.
00:25:17.950 - 00:25:51.482, Speaker A: That one is really interesting because there's 1.5 billion cars in the road, and they are now consuming more and more data every single day. And the data requirements that they have ensure that it needs to be fresh. Let me restate that. A car, unlike us, we look at a map and we're like, oh, shit, the road's closed. Okay, I got to go this way. For an ADAS system or a robotaxi system, if there's construction, it needs to know about that, and it needs to make sure that that information is very accurate.
00:25:51.482 - 00:26:32.282, Speaker A: Right. And so the requirements that they have from a freshness and a reliability perspective are understandably quite high, and we're a great fit for that. So that's a massive new market, and it's a market that's monetizable because consumers are showing that they're willing to pay whatever, $800 a year, $1,000 a year, or $2,000 a year for these ADAS products. The third one is obviously massive. Right? You're talking about billions of people who use naps every single day, but it will take more years to kind of get to that level of ensuring that we have all the layers. But if I look forward five years from now. Yeah.
00:26:32.282 - 00:27:08.530, Speaker A: Hundreds of millions of cars, Adas robotaxis, are relying upon hive Mapper to navigate safely and efficiently to their destination. And hundreds of millions of consumers are relying upon hive mapper to navigate safely, efficiently, and so forth. That's how you get really big, and that's how you become really compelling in the mapping world. Right. Like, if you're just providing data APIs to the traditional players, you can build a good business, but it's never going to be a business that is churning out billions upon billions of dollars a year in revenue.
00:27:09.430 - 00:27:42.126, Speaker B: There's rumors that Hivemapper has closed in partnerships with some pretty big name companies. I don't think you can disclose any of those yet, at least from what I've seen. So I'm curious if you can, but if not, I'm curious when you're talking with these bigger, whether it's corporations, companies, et cetera, what's the main pushback or hesitation? When I think of deepen, maybe it's lower cost, but it might be hard to. Investment committee meeting when you mentioned crypto, whether that's just because of regulatory reasons or also just reliability, because you're dealing with a Dow, and do you trust a Dow or like a board? And for me, I could see how that could have some complications. So I'm curious what you've experienced so.
00:27:42.148 - 00:28:15.658, Speaker A: So far, that hasn't been an issue. I mean, people have asked us about the crypto side, and I think they're curious about it, but they don't, frankly, care that much about it, because when they're dealing with, there's really two sides of Hivemapper. There's Hivemapper, Inc. Regular startup, Delaware based corporation. We're effectively a developer that uses and license the data from the Hive Appper network. The network is, like you said, controlled by the Dow, controlled by the honey token, and governed by that. So when we close a customer, so let's say the customers comes to us, says, okay, I want $100,000 worth of your data product.
00:28:15.658 - 00:29:11.280, Speaker A: We then have to basically go and license X amount from the Hivemapper network, and then we go and do all that. They don't care about that. They're just like, okay, is this data high quality? Is it fresh? The thing that we do see is privacy. There's a lot of questions, understandably, about privacy in the world of mapping. And there's a lot of customers that want to make sure that they're working with a company that respects people's privacy, both from the contributor, but also from the perspective of the bystanders, who are potentially just being seen by the dash cam. And so there's literally a 30 page document that we have about how we actually go and collect this data in a privacy centric manner. And there are some customers that are spending weeks, if not months, digging into this stuff at a very deep level.
00:29:12.850 - 00:29:50.874, Speaker C: So talking about maybe the crypto side here, I do have two follow up questions. One is just so I really understand how you guys utilize crypto here. It seems like the main purpose of using a blockchain here is facilitating rewards and payouts of the honey token. Okay, so that's number one. Just correct me if I'm wrong there. And then maybe if you have any future plans for putting more data on chain? I know people have different philosophies on that. Then two, I guess that's probably something you could do on most networks, I would say.
00:29:50.874 - 00:29:55.690, Speaker C: So that is to say, why did you guys maybe go with Solana?
00:29:56.510 - 00:30:28.946, Speaker A: Yeah, we will add more data on chain. Let me just address that one, because I think it's interesting. Maps are very controversial. They're geopolitically sensitive. Wars have been fought over maps in terms of somebody draws a lines here, someone draws a lines there. I think you're seeing that sometimes play out all over the world today. And so we will take boundaries as well as what we call network level privacy zones and put those on chain.
00:30:28.946 - 00:31:12.786, Speaker A: So, like, a network level privacy zone would be as, like, there's a military base here, or the CIA headquarters is here, and we don't map those areas. Like, if you were to go into it inside a military base, we just will turn off. And I think it's important that that stuff reside on chain, so it's all there. If we make changes to it, everyone can see those changes and all that kind of stuff, because it will become like this geopolitical volleyball in many ways, from a Solana perspective. To me, it came down to trust and costs. So let's start with cost. I mean, look, as an entrepreneur, you're taking on a lot of risk, and you're trying to just constantly reduce risk, reduce risk, reduce risk in order to grow your business.
00:31:12.786 - 00:32:05.140, Speaker A: And so when I looked at this and, you know, Ethereum, okay, there's all these crazy gas fees with Solana, that was clearly not the case. And I said, well, why would I potentially incur this additional cost that could balloon right at any given moment in time? And it just kind of seemed like an idiotic cost to take on. So that was the primary thing. And the secondary thing was trust. Trust in the Solana ecosystem that I started to kind of look around and then trust in talking to people like Anatole and Raj, and they said, look, if this doesn't work for you, then by all means, we will help you migrate to another chain that does work for you. Right? And I think that was really important thing to be said, which was make. We're going to try to make this work, but for whatever reason, if it doesn't work, we know you got to grow this business, and we're going to help you move off.
00:32:05.140 - 00:32:27.180, Speaker A: We've never had to have that conversation, obviously, because we've been very pleased with Solana. Most people don't realize this. We only have one engineer who's working on all the salon infrastructure. I view that as a positive. I don't want 20 engineers working on Salana infrastructure because that's time away from the map, that's time away from other stuff that we could be doing.
00:32:27.710 - 00:32:43.822, Speaker B: Ariel, is there any credence to a network effect of all these deep end projects on Salana? So Anatolia had a tweet the other day, and he's like, there should be a startup that has a teleport autonomous car that's using hive mapper data, that's say, using render for the GPU calculations in the backend. And it's like, is there a network effect?
00:32:43.876 - 00:33:14.758, Speaker A: Yeah, there. Like, in terms of. On the contributor side, absolutely right. On the contributor side, we see this, which is, you know, I'm introduced to helium and then I started with Hivemapper because I'm an Uber driver, or I know an Uber driver and I bought a dash cam for him and we split the tokens. And there is absolutely, especially in what I would refer, know, the deep end projects that are physically in the real world. I mean, I think render is obviously a deep in, but as well. But it's more virtual.
00:33:14.758 - 00:33:37.550, Speaker A: Right. Ours, you have to be in certain locations at certain times to be able to actually build the map. And so, yes, that is very. I agree with him on that. There is this kind of great network effect ecosystem that you can tap into. All these people who want to build, they want to help build new things. I will also say there's a lot of people coming into deep end, and I think they learned some wrong lessons from helium.
00:33:37.550 - 00:34:11.850, Speaker A: I love helium. I mean, Amir is the George Washington in many ways of the deep, so. But helium was founded or started to grow in a very specific moment in time. And the supply side, I think they would argue, kind of grew too fast. Right? That wasn't like they didn't do anything. It was just like the crazy markets kind of took them and ran with them. Right? And I think there are some entrepreneurs who learn, like, oh, you just have to have supply, grow supply, grow supply, grow supply.
00:34:11.850 - 00:34:51.782, Speaker A: And I'm like, grow supply for what? Right. Really? It's about matching demand and supply. It's not about just growing supply for the sake of growing supply. And I think a lot of people from the external looking in, say, oh, my God, look at this thing. It has crazy growth in terms of blah, blah, blah, blah. And I'm like, well, a lot of that is probably useless and you're just throwing away tokens and you're just throwing away time and energy and money and whatever it is. And so I think we have to kind of like, what's the right lessons that have been learned from helium and others? And if we see what they're doing now with mobile, it's very clever, right? They're going after specific regions.
00:34:51.782 - 00:35:23.262, Speaker A: They're going after specific incentives and saying like, look, if you place your 5G hotspot or whatever they call it in these specific locations, you will earn more than somebody else because we need this coverage here, right? Because we know we have demand here. And so I think that demand supply matching is the real interesting part. And I think burst speaks to some of that, that more entrepreneurs should focus on versus just like supply growth for the sake of showing the community supply growth.
00:35:23.326 - 00:35:32.630, Speaker B: You tweeted that most web3 companies fail for the same reason that web two companies fail, and that's that they're competing for the wrong KPIs. What is the main KPI for hive mapper?
00:35:33.690 - 00:36:13.390, Speaker A: The main KPI right now is for a given region. How many API calls are hitting that specific region? Okay, so, for example, now one of the customers is basically coming in. They put a purchase order in early this year, is relatively small, five digits. And they came back and they did another purchase order for six digits. And they came back and did another one for six digits. Why? Because we were actually had demand in the right places. Or now with burst, we have the right tools to help them get coverage or better freshness in the right places.
00:36:13.390 - 00:36:58.110, Speaker A: Right. And so we had another customer came in and they know they started just actually in San Francisco, and we had to hit certain metrics, right? So we had to hit certain freshness metrics. Like we had to see the given locations that they added to the map x amount of times per week. If we hit that, then they said, okay, we'll expand this to more regions across the United States. Well, we hit those metrics. And so those are the things that I actually focus on every day is like, are we hitting the metrics that matter to our customers in terms of coverage and freshness? And, you know, given where their API calls are, they actually getting back something that they wanted? That matters a lot more to me than how many dash cams we sold last month or blah, blah, blah.
00:36:58.190 - 00:37:19.740, Speaker C: God, it's just such a fascinating business. I've never really seen quite, this is a really niche but very impactful industry. I guess there's so many ways to go with it. I'm just curious, on a personal level, what are some of the biggest challenges you think that you guys have to overcome to make this the next billion dollar business?
00:37:20.670 - 00:38:01.238, Speaker A: Yeah. To me, I think the holy grail is becoming part of not just integrating into all these ADAS products, which is really hard, very impactful in terms of their businesses. But if you look at Google Maps, why did it become so dominant and such a significant revenue stream on the business side? Well, they had all these customers that were already using them on the consumer side. Right. And I think that it's a lot easier to go into your business, whether you're, you know, Uber or whatever, and say like, hey, I think we should use this mapping product because I already use it in my personal life. Right. And I'm very happy with it.
00:38:01.238 - 00:38:57.654, Speaker A: And so to me, that is the big unlock there, which is like, if you get into consumers lives and you get into hundreds and millions of consumers lives, then the business side actually becomes easier and easier. You're getting lead generation for people who are just kind of pulling you into their organization. And so to me, that is, you got to build a lot more layers to the map, right? You need traffic layers, you need places layers and so forth. You need obviously turn by turn directions and all that kind of stuff. But then you start to achieve something that will be around for decades upon decades because it is now being used by tens of millions, hundreds of millions of people in their daily lives. And once you kind of get pulled into that world, you're going to then pull it into other parts of your life as well, especially if you work in a business or a car manufacturer or whatever it is. And so, yeah, I think it's challenging because you're both going after B to B and B to C.
00:38:57.654 - 00:39:33.122, Speaker A: But I think if you look at a lot of the B to B, like Mapbox, who I have a lot of respect for, I think they've had a bigger challenge because, yes, they have a great product in many ways. I think it can be better if they use hive Mapper data, quite frankly. But yes, they have to prove themselves from 0.0 with every customer versus if some of those customers were already using their product in their daily lives, there would kind of be this built in trust, right, where you wouldn't have to start from .0 with that customer.
00:39:33.256 - 00:39:55.210, Speaker B: I was listening to the good Game podcast, and I had Kyle Somani on and he mentioned actually Hivemapper and Filecoin. He was saying Hivemapper is the perfect partner for Filecoin in that you have high, say, relatively high compute and storage cost. So I'm just curious, especially with this LLMs, probably that you're using AI, et cetera. How do you control those costs? Think about economics. And would you use something like Filecoin?
00:39:56.190 - 00:40:10.590, Speaker A: Yeah. So we definitely focus a lot on those costs, 100%. And so today we use AWS. We've been talking to the guys. We haven't. We haven't transitioned over yet. It's a non trivial transition.
00:40:10.590 - 00:40:38.306, Speaker A: And there's also costs. And integrated, like, moving data off of AWS is sometimes just as expensive as moving it on. Probably more expensive because they don't want you to take the data off. But the short version is, yes, compute is being moved more and more to the edge, to the dash cam itself. That is the way that you bring down the costs on the compute side, like full stop. Right. You got to move the compute to the edge.
00:40:38.306 - 00:41:19.094, Speaker A: And there's a lot of things that we've done in the last six to nine months to achieve some of that, a lot of those cost savings on the storage side. The thing that we're trying to do now more and more, is say, do we need this new image? Is there anything new in this image that we actually need it? Or is it like, okay, or maybe we have a better one because it's sunnier and now it's cloudier. So let's choose a sunnier one versus a cloudier one, and then just dispose of one, which is crappier. So there's a lot of things like that that can actually help us from a store's perspective, but it is very focused on it. Look, I love the file coin guys. It's a little bit complicated, to be honest. I've shared the feedback with them as well.
00:41:19.094 - 00:42:14.786, Speaker A: And I think this is like a struggle across crypto, is that if the crypto people get a hold of the thing, the thing becomes super complicated. And at the end of the day, you need real developers or business people or whatever you, real human beings to use your product. And they're trying to solve a problem fundamentally, and they don't really care about the crypto stuff. And if you let the crypto stuff get in the way of that, man, you got a big problem. And so I think that hopefully people are starting to realize, like, crypto is a technology and it has specific applications and specific use cases that it's really good for our cases about coordinating and incentivizing and rewarding tens of thousands of people all over the world in an open and a transparent and trustworthy way and everything else. We want to simplify the crap out of right. Because we have now people who came in from mapping geek.
00:42:14.786 - 00:42:40.270, Speaker A: I'm a mapping geek, but. So they're mapping geek geeks too, right. And it's interesting to hear their feedback on high map. Or they love it from the simplicity in terms of, it's easy, like, it's a dash cam, it's know all this. But then they're like, what's a like? They're smart people. Okay? They're very smart people. They're very technically savvy, but they're like, oh, I had to learn about what a wallet is and all these other concepts.
00:42:40.270 - 00:42:52.058, Speaker A: So there's already enough complexity in crypto that layering it on or deeply intertwining it with every aspect of your product, in my view, is a big mistake.
00:42:52.234 - 00:43:12.300, Speaker B: Well, I think it's amazing that we have people coming to the space working with you that are not. Maybe you're crypto native, but aren't obsessed with what is a wallet and know all these other things. It's really just like creating a better product and business strategy, which I think is awesome. I'm curious, since you call yourself a map geek, what do you think about the rest of crypto? Is there any other sector that interests you, or did you follow crypto long before you started?
00:43:13.790 - 00:44:03.866, Speaker A: Mean, look, I think that what I do believe in is, look, whether you believe what the United States government did was right or wrong, in terms of freezing the assets of Russia when they invaded Ukraine, I think it was a wake up call, right to, holy crap. The US government is weaponizing the dollar, and it's not really my dollar. And so I do think that's a very fundamental issue for the entire world to deal with, which is when you use these other assets that are ultimately controlled by the government, they're not really. So I find that incredibly fascinating. So that aspect of crypto, I think, is really interesting. Obviously, I'm a big fan of deep in. I think there will be many, many more products and applications in deep end.
00:44:03.866 - 00:45:00.666, Speaker A: I think we're just at the early phases of this. I think we're starting to kind of going back to my previous point. I think we're starting to hopefully build more forbiddable products that really focus on that demand supply equation that I was talking about and not just like metrics for the sake of crypto metrics. So I do think there's, there, I will say that I think that I've been a little bit disappointed that there's been so much venture capital dollars flowing into infrastructure layer. Maybe I don't want look, I think between things like Solana and Helios and others, there's a lot of good things already, right? This idea that we got to build a ton more infrastructure, that doesn't seem to me like the big problem. The big problem seems to me like there's not enough really good, high quality applications that are then taking crypto to a much wider audience. That feels to me like the fundamental problem.
00:45:00.666 - 00:45:20.660, Speaker A: And I think within the VC community, there doesn't seem to be a lot of appetite for that. And they're just kind of focused on the infrastructure level, probably because it feels safer. I don't know. I haven't talked to a lot of VCs about this, but I think that fundamentally feels a little bit broken at the moment, which is what the market needs versus what investors are investing in.
00:45:21.270 - 00:46:11.410, Speaker C: Yeah, it is absolutely broken. There's new l two s coming out every day, l three s. And so I am curious, because it's good that you point that out, because one of the things that I'm super interested in is, okay, how do we get more traditional Silicon Valley web two type kind of founders interested in crypto and actually make it a viable option for them to help enhance their businesses products or enable new business models that they couldn't do before? And you've done it right. So you came from web two. You actually had no intention of using crypto. And correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like crypto literally actually enhanced your business in a way that not using crypto wouldn't have. And so that's actually quite rare in my experience.
00:46:11.410 - 00:46:34.262, Speaker C: Right. Most of the time people will say something like, why do you even need a blockchain for this? But it's like, in your case, well, you tried it without a blockchain and the blockchain worked better. And so I'm curious, in your own words, what do you think we need to do to attract more a caliber founders into crypto or just home run startups?
00:46:34.406 - 00:47:15.042, Speaker A: Yes, good question. I mean, Les, Sam Bakeman Fried's on the front page of the Wall Street Journal would be a good think. You know, fundamentally, that's a big right, which is a lot of people don't want to be associated with it because we have had some bad actors. And I always tell people, I was like, look, I was in search and search had this thing called search spam, which is effectively a lot of bad actors trying to infiltrate the first or second pages of our Yahoo search results and they were effectively spam. Right. Like fraud effectively, right. And the same thing for Yahoo Mail.
00:47:15.042 - 00:48:07.666, Speaker A: And so it wasn't like Web two didn't have a lot of bad actors, but web two, I think, did a much better job of hiding or tamping down those bad actors. Right? I mean, there's a whole cybersecurity industry now around Web two, effectively, right? So there's obviously a lot of bad actors, but we've definitely had our fair share. When I say in the crypto world of just outright fraud on a really large scale, and it hasn't just been Sam, it's been others as well, and that just keeps people away fundamentally. And I think it starts, hopefully we're starting to close that chapter. And I think that there's voices like yourself and Brian and Anatole kind of speaking out like, no, this is a Ponzi scheme. This is ridiculous. This is just total bullshit.
00:48:07.666 - 00:48:45.474, Speaker A: You should not engage with this. And I think we just need more and more voices like that across the industry. And I think it'll just give us a lot more credibility, like when we go to the Senate and to Congress, people in general, and say, look, we think there's regulation that's appropriate, because this is a new technology and this is what it looks like. If they see the industry trying to tamp down, not tamp down, basically eradicate all these bad actors and ensure that new ones don't come into the system, then I think they're going to take us a lot more seriously. Feels like a big part of that.
00:48:45.512 - 00:49:05.770, Speaker B: Showing what's only possible with crypto. Ariel, I'm curious, with your experience, you've kind of tried to do this in the past. Do you think with 6 million unique roads mapped, 10% of the world, it's 80 million mile total, and that's in less than a year. Do you think a VC backed company could start today and replicate that over the first year? Or is this really only possible because of you leveraging crypto?
00:49:07.390 - 00:49:55.100, Speaker A: Yeah, I think crypto played a huge role. I mean, what Mer said is 100% correct, which is like, this was a very important tool that we utilized, I think, quite effectively. And without this tool, look, if you just compare us to previous iterations of this, we're growing a lot faster. I mean, we're growing four times faster than Google preview did. And Google's preview, I can assure you, Google had a lot more capital than we did. So we are definitely growing faster than a lot of competitors out there, because crypto and the way that we've employed it is a very important tool. So 100%, and I've gotten asked like, oh, will you go talk to the folks in DC about it and whatever and all that kind of stuff? And generally my answer is like, not really.
00:49:55.100 - 00:50:28.342, Speaker A: And the reason for that is because I don't think their minds are prepared to hear it. I can say this and I can share it with them. Right. And I can go testify in whatever it is. But I think you just have a set of people in DC now whose minds do not want to hear that. Right. And so if I go and talk, it'll all make logical sense to them and then they will still vote the way they're going to vote because they have some kind of existing biases against it or for it.
00:50:28.342 - 00:50:54.320, Speaker A: And so I don't think my voice is going to actually change the dynamic in any meaningful way. What will change it is actually having real customers utilizing the product, getting real value out of it and starting to, no, no, this is actually better and more cost effective than Google. Right. That's going to be a lot more interesting to the DC crowd than me going and talking.
00:50:55.890 - 00:51:04.290, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a great point. Maybe we can focus on breaking up map monopolies instead of sandwich monopolies.
00:51:07.430 - 00:51:10.130, Speaker A: There's not enough sandwich diversity out there. Mur.
00:51:12.390 - 00:51:56.274, Speaker C: I was going to say, so you are a repeat founder and in fact, you've been in this specific domain for a while and that's generally what I would say and what do I know? But having super deep domain knowledge in this specialized field is generally the kind of recipe for building a great company, which seems like it's working out pretty well for you. I guess. I'm curious, what are some lessons you've learned since you've been a founder about the nature of startups? Some mistakes you've made? We have a lot of people on Solana who are either series A or seed stage founders or just maybe looking to start their own ventures. I'm just curious to hear a bit about some of the lessons you've learned and maybe anything you can relate to them.
00:51:56.472 - 00:52:25.706, Speaker A: I think tolerance for pain is probably the most important thing. Obviously you have to be really passionate and very curious about your domain. I've tried to do other startups outside of the mapping world or the geo world, and I could do it for like three, six, maybe even nine months. And then I get bored of it just very quickly. This is kind of cool. I built something, some customers are using it. That's awesome.
00:52:25.706 - 00:53:18.278, Speaker A: But I don't know, do I want to do this for another three, four or 510 years? No, not really. I want to do for another day, let alone another three years. So for whatever reason, I'm really passionate and interested and curious about maps and navigation and how people in cars and vehicles move from one location to another and all that kind of stuff, that just fascinates me. And so I think you have to have that right because otherwise you're not going to build anything really great, because you're not going to want to go like ten layers deeper, all that kind of stuff. But fundamentally, it comes down to, are you willing to be very embarrassed? Because you will. There's going to be some moments where you go down a lot of dark things that just don't work out. And a lot of other people would be like, why am I going to do that? I'll look like a fool.
00:53:18.278 - 00:54:13.722, Speaker A: And whether you tell yourself that or there's kind of some subconscious thing, that's kind of the same outcome, which is like, you just don't go there because you don't want to be like, fail or be made a fool or be embarrassed or whatever it is. And, yeah, tolerance for pain, because you're just going to get told no, and you're going to get told, this is dumb and you're going to get told a lot. All that crap that you hear all the time. I think this is a big part of problem with America today. This kind of just kind of go macro is like, there doesn't seem to be like a level of optimism that there used to be. Everyone kind of looks at things from a very negative, pessimistic view, like, the world is ending, climate change is going to end us all. Stop having kids, to AI is going to kill us all, to self driving cars are going to kill us all.
00:54:13.722 - 00:54:42.360, Speaker A: Like, Jesus. No, that's all not true. And so that's the part that I think is concerning for entrepreneurialism in America, which makes America very dynamic. And, yeah, I think it's pretty concerning, actually. Maybe that's what Congress should focus on, like how to bring this level of optimism and entrepreneurialism back to America, which is really what made it so great.
00:54:43.130 - 00:55:14.320, Speaker C: Yeah, 100%. As somebody from Canada, I can agree even more, since everybody who starts the company in Canada just moves to the states. Well, pain tolerance, being passionate about what you're doing, all good advice. I am curious on a personal level, and I do like getting philosophical at the end and asking people, why are you still doing, like, what is kind of the North Star? What are you trying to accomplish? What's the chip on the shoulder here?
00:55:15.570 - 00:56:01.440, Speaker A: Well, one is to show that Google's not the only game in town. So I think that there's like a David of earth is Goliath kind of piece of it, which is just, like, very fascinating to me. And I'm a competitive person. And so just from a pure competitive perspective, that definitely motivates me. The other part of it is, there's a couple of other parts of it. One is creating something that lives well beyond my lifespan on this earth, right. This idea that 50 years from now, 70 years from now, this machine will still start will continue to work because there's incentives, because there's structure, because there's something useful that is being created out of it every single moment of the day.
00:56:01.440 - 00:56:38.570, Speaker A: That's very fascinating to me on a philosophical level. And then on the third dimension is, look, I think maps are an essential tool for human beings, and they should be owned by the people who use them. They shouldn't be owned by some massive corporation. We all use them, and oftentimes we also create them. Right. And so I think it's fundamentally wrong that today Google Maps is utilizing all your data and then turning around and basically building this proprietary data that they can monetize. Right.
00:56:38.570 - 00:56:57.860, Speaker A: And they only get value out of. And so I think as the primary human species, as the only human species on this earth, and we're the ones who use all these maps to navigate this earth that we all live on, that that map should actually be owned by the people who are building it and using it.
00:56:58.550 - 00:57:23.306, Speaker B: I love your passion, and I think that's one thing that's kind of beautiful about deepen is it brings in a different type of entrepreneur than maybe the typical crypto builder in the sense that you're working with crypto, which is digital, but also like real world assets. And some people just like to feel something or see something that they built. And I think that's going to attract a whole new type of builder that crypto hasn't had, because some people do want to change things in the real world, not just digitally. So that's really cool. Mert, do you want to close out.
00:57:23.328 - 00:57:27.642, Speaker A: With a rapid fire? Yeah, let's do it.
00:57:27.776 - 00:57:41.834, Speaker C: All right, cool. So time for rapid fire. I'm just going to ask quick questions. Try to answer quickly. Just try to have fun. Okay, so number one mistake, crypto founders.
00:57:41.882 - 00:57:45.570, Speaker A: Make growth for the sake of growth.
00:57:46.550 - 00:57:49.060, Speaker C: Number one mistake, web. Two, founders make.
00:57:52.470 - 00:57:56.120, Speaker A: Raising VC dollars way too early and way too much.
00:57:58.730 - 00:58:19.340, Speaker C: If you had to onboard somebody to crypto, but you couldn't use hivemapper, what would you show them to use helium. Yeah, that's an easy other one. Okay. What do you think is the most overrated concept in the entire industry right now?
00:58:21.470 - 00:58:47.400, Speaker A: Um, not sure overrated, but I just like, l two s, l three s, l four s. It just feels like complexity on top of complexity on top of complexity. And so I know there's, like, a lot of dollars chasing that at the moment, but it just feels like to me, a road to nowhere or a road to more complexity, which is like, the exact opposite of what crypto needs at the moment.
00:58:48.970 - 00:58:52.310, Speaker C: What does America need to do to be optimistic?
00:58:54.890 - 00:59:21.360, Speaker A: Hmm. I think we need, like, a Steve Jobs type of know. Elon is obviously a great entrepreneur, but he's not a Steve Jobs in terms of his ability to communicate in very clear terms, in very philosophical terms, in very inspiring ways, like Steve Jobs did. And I think we're missing that kind of person today.
00:59:22.950 - 00:59:32.002, Speaker C: Who are three of your favorite founders or CEO types in the industry today? Not crypto, just all of tech or.
00:59:32.056 - 01:00:28.982, Speaker A: All of, I think, you know, probably Steve Jobs for. Well, he's not alive, unfortunately, anymore, but definitely I've read a lot about him and very inspired by what he did. Jensen Hong at how I pronounce his last name, but Jensen from Navidea. And then the one that I think doesn't get enough credit. This isn't directly a CEO, but I think this is a venture capitalist. Know what Fred Wilson at Union Square Ventures did? I don't know if your audience is going to know him, but I think people should look him up, is pretty phenomenal because what he did wasn't just like, okay, he's going to jump on a new trend and chew the first or second or third best. I think oftentimes he invested in things, like, way before other people realized what was going on.
01:00:28.982 - 01:00:59.854, Speaker A: And I think he did that with Twitter as well. And so he had, like, over many decades. He saw things at a very early stage, well before most people did, and he didn't care what other people thought. I mean, that to me, is like a venture capitalist, not just someone who's like, okay, there's, whatever, 50 deals going by my desk, and I'm going to pick three or four or five, and one will take off. And there you go. I made my money. I think he would find that.
01:00:59.854 - 01:01:04.370, Speaker A: I don't know the guy, but I think he would find that pretty boring.
01:01:04.790 - 01:01:09.410, Speaker C: What is the most underrated quality in founders?
01:01:12.150 - 01:01:54.206, Speaker A: Yeah. Focus and tolerance for pain. Like, focus, because if you're trying to do 20 different things and go after 20 different markets all at the same time, I think you're just going to fail. If you're jumping from one thing to the next to the next, I think that's also like a big red flag. And then tolerance for pain, that one's hard to, because some people who are great communicators can hide it. There's like a lot of things that it's kind of hard to figure out who has that tolerance for pain. But to me, if you're a VC and you want to figure out who's going to really stick with something, if you could figure that out and you have like a $0.06
01:01:54.206 - 01:02:07.220, Speaker A: about that, that's pretty phenomenal, but that's hard. I don't do investing as a profession. Maybe you guys do a little bit, but on the side. But if you could figure that out, I feel like you could make a lot of money.
01:02:07.910 - 01:02:12.806, Speaker B: Likely very similar. But what about when you interview people? What qualities are you looking for? Or do you have a specific question.
01:02:12.828 - 01:02:58.294, Speaker A: You like to ask? I like this question. What's one thing that you believe that very few other people believe because you're really trying to understand? Are they willing to go away from where society is pulling them? Right. Just every single day we're getting hammered, right? Like by our friends, by our family, by advertising that we see, by things written in the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal, to believe a certain way, to believe a certain narrative. And so if you're willing to say, you know what, that doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Here's what I actually believe. Something the exact opposite that means is like you're a critical thinker. You don't care that much about what other people think.
01:02:58.294 - 01:03:43.780, Speaker A: And you have your own perspective on things. And so therefore, you're potentially, not always, but potentially have a higher tolerance for pain and more resilience and not just going to kind of go with the flow. And I think that's really important at a startup, right? Because at a startup you're fundamentally doing something that if it was easy and if it was like everybody knew it was going to work, then 100 other companies would have done it, right. And so I think that's a really important question. I mean, obviously the person has to have certain skills and capabilities and experience and that kind of stuff, but that to me, is a pretty big one. And it's hard. Even if you know the question in advance, you may still stumble on it.
01:03:43.780 - 01:03:58.380, Speaker A: And so it's not like one of those questions where, like Microsoft or Google right. Whereas people be like, oh, they asked this kind of question, and if you had pre briefing on it, then you would probably do better on it. It's not one of those types of questions.
01:03:59.390 - 01:04:02.220, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a good one.
01:04:04.590 - 01:04:10.140, Speaker A: What do you guys ask new ones?
01:04:10.510 - 01:04:28.350, Speaker C: I ask some weird stuff. I ask like, philosophical questions, technical questions, different scenarios. It depends on the role at Helios, basically our hiring practices. And I sold it from Coinbase. We do work trials.
01:04:28.430 - 01:04:28.674, Speaker A: Right.
01:04:28.712 - 01:04:49.420, Speaker C: So we'll actually work with the person and see what they're capable of in practice for like two, three weeks. And then that's mutually beneficial as well because they can see if they like it and then obviously it's paid. I have asked that question before, but I find that people kind of just bs their way through it. And I'm like, that's not really an unpopular opinion. Right?
01:04:49.870 - 01:05:00.810, Speaker A: Yeah, that's true. One I got was, every male should shave their entire, sorry, wax their entire body, all body hair.
01:05:01.250 - 01:05:02.510, Speaker B: That's an interesting one.
01:05:02.580 - 01:05:12.720, Speaker A: Yeah. I was like, wow, that's pretty cool. I was like, they're like, every male should do that at least once in their lifetime. And he was very adamant about it.
01:05:13.410 - 01:05:14.510, Speaker C: A swimmer?
01:05:14.930 - 01:05:38.426, Speaker A: No, he wasn't even a swimmer. He was like just a normal dude. It was like, what's that? Yeah, I thought he was like, to biking or swimming. I asked him exactly. I was like, are you a biker or swimmer? He's like, no, I just think that everyone should do it and do it once to see if they're, and then he had a whole bunch of reasons, like, females do it. And then he's like, do you have the tolerance for pain associated with that? And a bunch of other stuff.
01:05:38.608 - 01:05:39.900, Speaker B: Do you hire him?
01:05:40.590 - 01:05:55.200, Speaker A: We made him an offer. Unfortunately, he didn't accept. That's funny. Yeah, it was a pretty good answer. I was like, I mean, I remember it. I'm sharing with you guys. So I've had some pretty interesting ones.
01:05:56.290 - 01:06:03.200, Speaker C: Well, can't really top that. So final question will be, what's the best way to get started with Hivemapper for people listening to this?
01:06:03.810 - 01:06:23.542, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, if you want to become a contributor, just go to hivemapper.com and you can either buy a dash cam or you can start playing these AI trainer games immediately. If you're interested in using the data, there's a whole kind of mapping data console that we have, or you can just reach out to us via Hyatt hivemapper.com and we can help you out. Love it.
01:06:23.596 - 01:06:41.706, Speaker B: Ariel, thanks so much for joining I think before starting this podcast, I was pretty skeptical of deepen and what it could actually do, what the future was. But after interviewing several companies and looking at Hive Mapper, I'm like genuinely excited and it's one of the most exciting things that we have in crypto right now. So thank you for joining the industry, everybody. A lot more hope and yeah, thanks for joining us.
