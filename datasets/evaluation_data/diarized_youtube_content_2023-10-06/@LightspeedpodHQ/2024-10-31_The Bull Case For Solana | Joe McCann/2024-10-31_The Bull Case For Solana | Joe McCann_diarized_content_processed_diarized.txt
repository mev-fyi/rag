00:00:00.440 - 00:00:32.665, Speaker A: My point here is the fundamentals behind the growth of Solana. The core technology is improving and people are paying attention to that because it's being reflected in the metrics that Solana is consistently outperforming Ethereum on. As a trader, you should just look at this and go, Solana is the fastest horse it's got. Significant upside to get to parity of a market cap of Ethereum. Even if it doesn't get there and they're flipping Ethereum on metrics, this is a very easy trade to make.
00:00:37.645 - 00:00:49.573, Speaker B: All right. Hello and welcome back to another episode of Lightspeed. I'm your host Jack Cubanek, joined today by Asymmetric founder, CEO and CIO Joe McCann. Joe, thanks for coming back on the show.
00:00:49.709 - 00:00:51.437, Speaker A: My pleasure. Glad to be back.
00:00:51.621 - 00:01:33.935, Speaker B: So you've been on the POD before, I think around a year ago actually talking about your Solana thesis at a time when the price was not nearly what it is now. And just also your own story. There's a lot of good stuff in there. We'll link it in the show notes and people should check it out. But Joe, the reason I really wanted to have you on right now today is that right now is just a really fascinating moment to throw out a couple stats. One that's being cited often is what Blockworks Research calls real economic value Rev, if you will, which can be thought about like the income that the Solana blockchain generates just set a weekly all time high by like 9 million. And it's set to break that again this coming week.
00:01:33.935 - 00:02:06.265, Speaker B: Sol ETH, the ratio of Solana's price to ETH hit 7% for the first time ever. And Jito tips alone brought in over $6 million yesterday. So just lots of all time highs kind of everywhere you look. Some of these numbers may shift by the time people hear this due to release schedules and things like that. But Joe, I just want to start out and ask you, give me your take on what's happening right now in the Solana market and especially why that's happening right now.
00:02:06.805 - 00:02:58.255, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. I mean, so there's, there's the fundamentals and then there's kind of like the market. So we can kind of, we can dive into each one of these separately. So on the fundamental side, Solana is executing against the roadmap that they have put forth for years that's publicly available. Anybody can go see what's available on the GitHub repos and create SIMD's or read them and anticipate what they're doing and Anatolia and the broader Solana Labs team and frankly, the broader open source community around Solana has been very public about what they're intending to do with this high performance, high throughput blockchain. And it's happening. For a while there were, I would say, critics, and some of that was justifiably valid.
00:02:58.255 - 00:03:08.875, Speaker A: Criticizing the reliability issues associated with Solana. Well, that only happens when you have a lot of activity and you're in a production environment, AKA mainnet.
00:03:08.955 - 00:03:09.575, Speaker C: Right.
00:03:09.995 - 00:04:02.875, Speaker A: Have we had any reliability issues lately with Solana? No. Has the activity been at all times highs? Yes. So what does that tell you? It tells you that the learnings that the core team and members of the broader open source ecosystem around Solana are taking the challenges that we've had around some of the reliability issues and implementing changes to improve that form of reliability. In fact, by the time this airs, Coinbase, Coinbase.com has a scheduled outage over the weekend and it will turn out that Solana was more reliable than Coinbase for 2024 when that is done. So like, let that sink in. Obviously, Coinbase is a very Ethereum heavy, focused shop and they've done a great job with base as their L2 as well as supporting the broader Ethereum ecosystem.
00:04:02.875 - 00:04:51.699, Speaker A: They have a less reliable service than Solana. And so my point here is the fundamentals behind the growth of Solana. The core technology is improving and people are paying attention to that because it's being reflected in the metrics that Solana is consistently outperforming Ethereum on. My buddy Kyle Simani over at Multicoin dropped an amazing presentation and deck around how Solana will absolutely flow, flip Ethereum's, you know, core metrics. And I, I encourage folks to go read this even if you're an Ethereum maxi, because it'll at least be, you know, some sort of maybe, you know, cause you to think a little bit more critically, even though, yes, me and Kyle are clear. Salon of Bulls. It's happening.
00:04:51.699 - 00:05:27.705, Speaker A: And I mean to your point about the, the rev JITO tips, I mean, JITO right now, you know, full disclosure, I'm an investor and I love those guys. Like they're running at a $2 billion annualized run rate right now. Two billion. That's insane. Especially given that the narrative for so long has been that, oh, you know, Solana as a chain isn't going to generate any real revenue and it's not sustainable and this and that, it's all nonsense because the value comes from the activity on the network and the activity is Exploding. So let's talk about where the activity is happening. No shit.
00:05:27.705 - 00:05:59.091, Speaker A: Meme Coins, right? You have this explosion of Meme Coin related activity. That's great because what we're doing is we're constantly pressure testing the network with hardcore speculators that are operating in a PVP video game like environment. This is exactly what you want to see. We can debate the merits of Meme Coins. I think they're great. Other people think that they're a, you know, a sour spot as it relates to crypto. But it's a permissionless network so we should encourage innovation is my broader view.
00:05:59.091 - 00:06:37.893, Speaker A: And frankly, if folks want to speculate on football games or they want to speculate on Meme Coins, let them have it. That's where a ton of the activity is happening today. But more importantly, the way that the broader kind of Solana ecosystem, whether it stems from Defi to de pin, all of these things are starting to incorporate things like, you know, Jito bundles MEV protection on things like Jupiter. You know, Camino is now like the largest lending platform on, on Solana and there's tons again, it's almost like a repeat of October last year. Tons of stable coin flows are leaving Ethereum and coming to Solana. It's the exact same setup.
00:06:37.949 - 00:06:38.189, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:38.237 - 00:07:34.445, Speaker A: So I think in a nutshell, the fundamentals of the platform or the blockchain itself and the broader kind of applications that are built on top of it, as well as some of like the kind of know infrastructure, things like Jito are clearly playing out as, as like at least myself and I think others have envisaged for quite some time now. Let's talk about the market. You mentioned the Soul Eth chart. This is a, this is a pair that we at asymmetric track very, very closely and it did just reach a new all time high. Why is that the case? So if you're a trader, let's say you know nothing about the technology. If you're just a trader and you're trying to form an opinion on what's the thing that's going to generate me the best return from a relative value perspective for the rest of 2024. So we've got roughly call it two months left.
00:07:34.445 - 00:08:50.865, Speaker A: Is it going to be Ethereum or is it going to be Solana? Because everybody's got an allocation of Bitcoin that's clear. Where are they going to get some sort of beta in their portfolio? Well, it turns out through the end of Q3 of this year, Ethereum is of a beta of less than 1, as it relates to Bitcoin, that's not where you're getting beta, right? Solana's beta is much higher than that. And furthermore, if you take some of the fundamentals, just the metrics that Solana is consistently outperforming Ethereum on, and I mean consistently with a fraction of the tvl, which is a nonsense metric, but most Importantly, at roughly 20% the market cap of Ethereum, as a trader you should just look at this and go, Solana is the fastest horse. It's got significant upside to get to parity of a market cap of Ethereum. Even if it doesn't get there and they're flipping Ethereum on metrics, this is a very easy trade to make. And so I think that the market is, we will know in roughly 10, 12 days who the President of the United States will be for the next four years. I think the market is telling you at least that their perception is, is it's going to be Donald Trump.
00:08:50.865 - 00:09:09.423, Speaker A: And if that's the case, you want to be long beta to Bitcoin, you want to be long Bitcoin, period, but everybody's already long Bitcoin. And so you want some beta to, to Bitcoin. That trade is clearly Solana at this point and literally the numbers support it because Ethereum's beta is actually less than 1.
00:09:09.519 - 00:09:26.471, Speaker B: This is a dumb question, maybe, but I want to start with the sole ETH metric. How meaningful is that ratio? Because it's cited a lot. But the price of Soul versus the price of ETH doesn't necessarily need to be one to one.
00:09:26.503 - 00:09:26.695, Speaker C: Right?
00:09:26.735 - 00:09:38.735, Speaker B: Because what matters is the percent return because these things have different issuance schedules and so forth. So what is actually the benchmark or like, how would you evaluate Soleith as a metric?
00:09:39.875 - 00:10:20.775, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, so there's a, there's a couple things, a couple ways to think about it. A, you know, a cross currency pair is just what the market is telling you it's valued at. So if you want to, you know, if you want to, you know, if you have Euros and you want to buy Japanese yen, there's going to be some, you know, value associated with that and there's some spread that's going to be associated with that. It's the same thing for something like Soul Eth. And yes, the arbitrageurs will look at Soul USD and ETH USD and then try to, you know, map out sort of the, the arbitrage opportunity of Soul versus eth. That's how this works. It's kind of triangular Arbitrage.
00:10:20.775 - 00:11:41.799, Speaker A: But why? Like why do we track it or why is it important and how do we think about it? Solana has real inflows. Solana has clearly become the chain for retail. And when you start to add those things together, what are you subtracting? Well, about a week ago from at least the day that we're airing this over the weekend, I noticed a huge transfer from an unknown wallet into Coinbase for Ethereum. There's a few hundred million dollars and I thought to myself, I was talking with my trading partner, I was like, I'm pretty sure they're going to dump Eth this week and rotate it into slot. And that's pretty much exactly what happened because people are looking at the sole Eth pair, the relative value of that and also just frankly capitulating on the lack of frankly price action or positive price action associated with Ether Ethereum. And so if you're looking at soul Eth, we look at as power traders relatively valuing one versus the other. How are traders relatively valuing Eth btc? People have been all year long saying that the bottom in Eth BTC is it.
00:11:41.799 - 00:12:10.991, Speaker A: That's it just hit a new year to date low this past week. Why? Because traders see the relative value of ETH versus BTC as less than holding ETH versus btc. So they're selling it. It's the same thing with Sol. People meaning traders are putting their money where their mouth is and effectively saying the relative value of Solana vs eth is underpriced and I'm going to bid that higher. So I would look at the Sol. We don't trade the solid pair.
00:12:10.991 - 00:12:22.487, Speaker A: We don't need to. What we do is we use it as a, as a guiding like metric as to how the market is int is interpreting the relative Value of Solana vs Ethereum.
00:12:22.591 - 00:13:58.573, Speaker B: Another thing you brought up that I've been looking at this morning is the blockchain's performance. In April there was this huge kind of maybe first iteration of like the Solana meme coin mania, largely revolving around or which is a proof of work currency on Solana, it really degraded kind of the chain's performance and the ability for users to get transactions to the blockchain. And you know, when I first started out the Lightspeed newsletter, writing daily about Solana, this was something I looked at a lot was what percentage of Solana transactions are failing in that peak in April it was over 70%, over 75% some days today it's closer to like 35% and you know, people will tell you that failed transactions don't really matter because it's just business logic. And so if you're a bot, you could spam the chain a million times, but you're not necessarily competing with everyday users. And, you know, if you're just a person swapping soul for a meme coin, your transaction isn't going to fail 35% of the time. I still just think it's an interesting stat though, because, like, it's not the most efficient for 70% or more than 50% of transactions to fail. But this weird thing happened if you look at the charts where in early June, all of a sudden the transaction fail rate fell by like 20% and it's just stayed there.
00:13:58.573 - 00:14:40.485, Speaker B: And even as the metrics have raced up recently, more transactions aren't failing. So I think part of that is due to upgrades that have been made to the Solana network. There also was a claim that Soul Zen, which is this meme coin, was sort of crowding out block space. But for one reason or another, bots are not finding it profitable anymore to just spam the chain ceaselessly to try to land transactions. And so it's, it's operating more efficiently. So I think that's an interesting one to note as well, because, you know, we bring up that stat when it's really bad. But it's also interesting to note that failed transactions haven't increased during this two weeks of everything kind of going parabolic.
00:14:40.565 - 00:14:46.741, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, what you're underscoring is exactly the point I made earlier in the fundamentals discussion.
00:14:46.853 - 00:14:47.149, Speaker C: Right?
00:14:47.197 - 00:15:09.273, Speaker A: Like you have to have step function increases in activity on the network to figure out where the hotspots and the bugs are. It is next to impossible to replicate a production environment main net in a test environment. They're just literally fundamentally different.
00:15:09.329 - 00:15:09.929, Speaker C: Right.
00:15:10.097 - 00:16:06.629, Speaker A: And yeah, I'm sure there's probably some black magic programming wizardry that some genius can figure out how to replicate it one for one, but it's just like paper trading versus real trading. A lot of people will run back tests on a paper trading strategy that they have, and they're like, oh, it performed like 18% annualized for this backtesting strategy. It's like, right, except you weren't actually putting money into the market. And the second that you do that, you change the order books, you change the outcomes of those markets. That's the same thing with running a test environment versus a production environment or testnet versus mainnet. And so the challenges that we ran into with those failed transactions which to your point, is actually, believe it or not, beneficial to the user because the business logic is doing exactly what it should do. Doesn't change the fact that the user experience sucks.
00:16:06.629 - 00:16:53.779, Speaker A: We don't have that issue anymore. That is testament to the process that the Solana core team and the broader kind of open source community has adopted for how to actually upgrade, fix and improve the Solana network. Which by the way, is exactly how software has been shipped since the Web2 cloud computing era for the past 16, 17 years. Back in the 90s, you know, some guy would like pull up to your business with like Rolex and you know, the Gartner Magic Quadrant and point to his company's software and be like, you need to buy this for this reason. And then in one year we'll give you the next version and it's on like a cd, right? Those days are way gone. That's how Ethereum ships software. And by the way, that's fine if they want to do that.
00:16:53.779 - 00:17:27.295, Speaker A: It's just not consistent with how software has been shipping in a, you know, a real time kind of high iteration, high like highly innovative Internet that we've had over the past 16, 17 years. So people always ask me like, is, is, is, is Solana done with having reliability issues? And I said, I hope not, because then we're not pressure testing the chain and also doing things to improve the user experience. So yes, you are astute in pointing out that no one's talking about that now. Why? Because we improve the network right now.
00:17:27.955 - 00:18:00.897, Speaker B: And really, for the last six months, it seems like a lot of the ebbs and flows of Solana network usage has gone with the meme coin market. When people want to trade meme coins a lot, the rev goes up. The price of soul goes up. In a lot of cases, not exclusively. So just as a trader, like meme coins are a catalyst for the soul price, it seems like. I'm curious how big of a catalyst it is and what are the other kind of driving factors behind the price of Soul that you would look at?
00:18:01.081 - 00:18:09.411, Speaker A: Yeah. So I will respectfully disagree with you on this, that meme coins are a driving factor. I'll say they are a contributing factor.
00:18:09.553 - 00:18:09.831, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:09.863 - 00:18:37.585, Speaker A: Because the, you know, if you, if you watch like traditional finance media like CNBC and this and that, they're always like, oh, you know, The S&P 500 is up 1% today because of this reason. It's like, no, no, that's actually not true. It's not true. There are literally more buyers than sellers that that's actually why The S&P 500 is up. But human beings don't like hearing that they. We want to understand the causal connection to things. It's in our nature to do that.
00:18:37.585 - 00:19:24.475, Speaker A: But in a market, there is no causal connection. It's literally like, are there more buyers and sellers now? There are things that can influence more buyers and sellers. So one of them could be, hey, all these folks that are like, coming over and bridging to Solana, they need to buy some soul so they can trade meme coins. Yes. But secondarily, let's look at the election. If Donald Trump is the presumptive winner of the presidential election, what is going to do well in that outcome? It's going to be obviously Bitcoin and the things that trade beta to bitcoin. So you could also make an argument that, you know, whether it's retail or institutional investors like myself are buying Solana as a, you know, a call option on the future of the presidential election.
00:19:24.475 - 00:20:08.153, Speaker A: All of these things are actually contributing factors as it relates to Meme Coin activity in general. Yes. There's no doubt that the kind of flood of people that are engaging in this PvP video game are contributing to, you know, the activity on the network as well as, like, the potential rise of Soul. But that can also be offset by the fact that Pump Fun has sold, you know, 70, $80 million worth of Solana from the protocol revenue that they're generating from their app. So it's like you have sellers on the one hand with Pump Fun, and then you've got potential buyers on the one hand of retail coming in and doing these PvP video games, trading meme coins. So I just want us to be, you know, kind of intellectually honest with why the price moves up or down. It has less to do with an.
00:20:08.153 - 00:20:15.525, Speaker A: A specific causal connection and more to do with the fact that there are things influencing buyers decisions to buy more Salon.
00:20:16.505 - 00:20:29.595, Speaker B: So, okay, maybe an impossible question, but you kind of brought up a potential Trump presidency and Meme Coins to two catalysts. Which do you think is a stronger driver of price action?
00:20:29.755 - 00:21:14.375, Speaker A: Oh, easily Trump. Yeah. I mean, at this juncture, you know, I've been on record for months now basically saying, like, I think it's a coin flip. I would give an edge to Trump. At this point, I could be totally wrong. But, you know, we talked about this on the BIPS and BIPS podcast about how, you know, Jeff park from Bitwise was on, and he brought up an excellent point which I firmly agree with, that prediction markets or markets in general where people are putting their actual money at risk is a much better signal and indicator than polls because polls are easy to be biased. It's easy for someone to be lying.
00:21:14.375 - 00:21:23.021, Speaker A: And you know, frankly the, the, the cohort of people that participate in polls is also skewed.
00:21:23.123 - 00:21:23.765, Speaker C: Right.
00:21:24.105 - 00:21:32.289, Speaker A: How often do, does a poll have a true representation of the American populace? The answer is it doesn't because it's a poll that's targeted.
00:21:32.337 - 00:21:32.545, Speaker C: Right.
00:21:32.585 - 00:22:07.253, Speaker A: Like, and you know, they, they do their best and then you have myriad polls, then you try to aggregate all these polls. There's no money at stake. It's like paper trading. It's the same thing like, or it's like playing poker with no money. It's the same concept. And so the prediction markets, poly market, sure, but also predicted Intrade, all of these have Trump significantly ahead at this time in 2012. Intrade in the company out of Ireland that has a prediction market had Obama leading mitt Romney like 61 to 39 or something.
00:22:07.253 - 00:22:41.565, Speaker A: That's kind of where we're at right now with Trump and Harris. Could it turn out that the prediction markets are wrong? Yes, it's a prediction. Right. But when folks put their money at risk, to me it's a much stronger signal. Now there's a second thing that you can look at that we definitely look at as well as it relates to how the, how the kind of capital markets are interpreting the presidential outcome. One, it is no surprise that Trump will increase the deficit more than Harris. Both of them are going to increase the deficit.
00:22:41.565 - 00:23:16.113, Speaker A: This is why I don't think it ultimately matters who is president as it relates to, you know, call it new all time highs in Bitcoin. It's really just the speed at which we get there. Under a Trump presidency, it's way faster. Under a Harris administration, it's probably, you know, a bit steadier, slower so to speak. But the, the, the direction is the same is, is higher because ultimately deficits will increase pretty significantly under either administration. Well, if you look at what is the, what is the, the market that proxies deficit, you know, increase deficits for any government. And that's the bond market.
00:23:16.113 - 00:24:07.725, Speaker A: And then you look at the, the yield curve. Well, what's the, what's the one that actually has the biggest impact is the 30 year, which is called the long bond. If the long bond is selling off, meaning the interest rate is, you know, the, the coupon, the, the, the interest you're going to receive on that 30 year, 30 year bond. If that, if that number is going up. That's the market saying, you're going to have to pay me higher interest to fund this deficit long term. So as the long bond has been selling off pretty significantly over the past, you know, week, week and a half, that implies a Trump victory because deficits will be higher under him than Kamala Harris. The other thing to note is it also favors a stronger US Dollar under President Trump than potentially President Harris.
00:24:07.725 - 00:24:31.699, Speaker A: What has the dollar been doing? It's up significantly over the past three weeks. It traded. The DXY, which is the dollar index, was trading around 100. It's a little over 104 as we sit here today. That's a pretty material move. That's also suggesting that the market is interpreting a Trump win. Finally, Goldman Sachs, I mean, all the banks have this, but Goldman Sachs prime book.
00:24:31.699 - 00:25:03.715, Speaker A: I put out something recently about a week ago. They have these baskets which are like, you know, Democratic winner versus Republican winner, right? And so these are. These are companies or stocks in these baskets that benefit from a Democratic President Harris versus a Republican President Trump. About a week, week and a half ago, or whatever it was, people started dumping the Democrat basket and buying up the Republican basket. Now, again, this is a. This is a form of a prediction market. They could all be wrong, right? Like, Harris could win the election.
00:25:03.715 - 00:25:05.947, Speaker A: And they're like, oh, shit, I made the wrong trade.
00:25:06.011 - 00:25:06.619, Speaker C: Right?
00:25:06.787 - 00:26:13.663, Speaker A: But if you put all of this together, the prediction markets, the yield curve, the US Dollar, and frankly, the basket of stocks that, you know, traders and investors are dumping and buying, it points to a Trump win. And if that happens, I mean, yes, meme coin activity is one thing, but that's a microcosm of the broader financial world. Whereas the presidential election is the most impactful thing to markets. You know, call it this quarter at a minimum. And so a Trump win, I think you could see, you know, bitcoin, if Trump wins, bitcoin's going to 100k, I think, on a rope, like, meaning very, very quickly. If it's a red wave or a red sweep, where it's a Trump presidency and it's a Republican Congress, Bitcoin's going to like, 150k. Because in that scenario, what you end up having is the clearest path to Bitcoin becoming a strategic reserve asset for the US Government in the treasury, right? Like, we have gold and oil and stuff today.
00:26:13.663 - 00:26:45.005, Speaker A: And if that happens and they execute against the planet that they had put that the Republicans put out a few months ago, that's like 5% of the supply of bitcoin and they're going to take five years to buy it. Like that's an enormous amount of money. So I just think that if Trump wins, bitcoin's going to 100k. If it's a, if it's a, you know, a red sweep, bitcoin's going to 150k. What does that mean for all the other assets? They're going significantly higher. Except for Ethereum.
00:26:46.785 - 00:27:03.721, Speaker B: Had to, had to slip in the Ethereum jab. I've seen you tweeting though that you think ultimately price action doesn't depend on the election, that even in a Harris administration you still get positive price action, just more delayed, essentially.
00:27:03.873 - 00:28:09.565, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, our view, the way that we're kind of war gaming the day of the election, in fact my trading is going to be with me here sitting next to me as we're trading on, on that night, is if, if, if there's a Harris win, Bitcoin's going to get absolutely pummeled immediately and then we'll bounce back. And the reason we think that's the case is that one, there's these, they're called market abuse algorithms that trade on headlines. And you know, the, the firms like Jane street, the kind of big algorithmic trading firms have these, these market abuse algorithms ready to go at all times and there will be real extreme realized volatility the day of the election and in the night of the election with every new headline popping out about who's ahead and who's behind. If Harris ultimately wins, I think you'll see the momentum, ignition algorithms pummel the price of Bitcoin. It could be down 5, 10 depending on where the price of bitcoin is. I mean, we're trading near 70k, right? 69k somewhere in that range.
00:28:09.565 - 00:28:23.265, Speaker A: If we're at new all time highs by the election and Harris wins, bitcoin's going to get smoked. But then it's going to come right back because the macro still suggests that you should be long bitcoin, because Harris is also going to increase the deficit.
00:28:23.385 - 00:28:23.737, Speaker C: Right.
00:28:23.801 - 00:29:21.835, Speaker A: So the, the kind of immediate term play is that if Harris actually wins the, the night of the election, you should, you should see bitcoin sell off pretty significantly and then, you know, that would affect the broader crypto market. But in the intermediate to longer term, it's, it's going higher based on like the macros, the Mac, the macro setup with higher deficits. Fed cutting rates, ECB cutting rates, bank of England cutting rates, bank of Canada, like all the Global coordination around rate cutting, hitting the markets and improving global equity, all of that stuff. That's why I say it doesn't really matter in a longer term. If you're a trader like us, where we want to trade the volume that happens the day of the election, you got to have a plan. Trump win, Harris win, red, red sweep, blue sweep, you know, divided Congress. All these things have to be in your kind of war gaming profile for the night of the election if you're going to be trading the price, price action that night.
00:29:22.775 - 00:30:18.535, Speaker B: So something that, when we think about the election and a potential change in administrations. Trump has pledged to fire Gary Gensler. It's debated how much that is within his power to do on day one or whatever. But something that doesn't maybe get talked about in the Solana world as much as it should is that the SEC stance is currently that, you know, Solana is a security. And there aren't really venues, to my understanding in the US Right now that are set up to trade a Solana security token. And so if the SEC stance in that Coinbase suit is seen out to completion, it's kind of an existential risk because US Investors can't acquire the asset and you just lose a ton of like the biggest capital market in the world. So I don't know, how do you think about that kind of, I would argue, existential risk to the asset?
00:30:20.635 - 00:30:41.135, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, existential risk is a really good way to farm engagement on the Internet, I will give you that. So let's like zoom out a little bit. And yes, you're, you're pointing out a specific detail as it relates to the SEC claiming that Solana's security with myriad other tokens.
00:30:41.175 - 00:30:41.471, Speaker C: Right.
00:30:41.543 - 00:31:23.387, Speaker A: They're not alone yet. They're not providing any justification as to why. Okay. Furthermore, the SEC has taken more losses this past year than I can ever remember the SEC taking, especially as it relates to crypto regulation, which is just regulation by enforcement. Furthermore, and I think that this is probably an, you know, this is somewhat, you know, broad spectrum pattern recognition here. Kind of like reading the tea leaves, trying to forecast based on some other events that may not have anything to do with the SEC lawsuits. Stripe just acquired this company called Bridge for $1.1
00:31:23.387 - 00:31:28.485, Speaker A: billion. And Bridge know, provides like stablecoin infrastructure for startups and developers and whatever.
00:31:28.525 - 00:31:28.725, Speaker C: Right.
00:31:28.765 - 00:32:13.041, Speaker A: Makes it really easy to integrate Stable coins into your application. Stripe is the textbook, like canonical, perfect Silicon Valley elite startup. The founders are amazing. They built an incredible company. The investors behind them are all the top tier Investors in Silicon Valley, and they are grooming this company to be what it is today and have been grooming it and being very decisive and deliberate about the direction that the company heads. So years ago, Stripe was pro crypto, and then all of a sudden they were, no, we're not touching crypto.
00:32:13.153 - 00:32:13.805, Speaker C: Right.
00:32:14.625 - 00:32:18.003, Speaker A: I'm speculating that that had to do with some of that grooming.
00:32:18.089 - 00:32:18.335, Speaker C: Right.
00:32:18.375 - 00:32:29.183, Speaker A: Saying, no, no, no, this is, this is too, like, we've got a good thing going here. Let's not mess with this thing. That could be in a regulatory gray area. We don't want to be in the, in the target zone of, say, regulators, for example.
00:32:29.239 - 00:32:29.719, Speaker C: Right.
00:32:29.847 - 00:32:33.807, Speaker A: Yet over the past year, stripe has completely 180 on that.
00:32:33.951 - 00:32:34.663, Speaker C: Right.
00:32:34.839 - 00:33:22.837, Speaker A: They support crypto, they have a dedicated crypto team, and now they just bought a stablecoin infrastructure company. That doesn't happen without the approval of the board. The board being these, you know, tier one, elite Silicon Valley VCs, they're not making that bet. If they assume that there's existential risk to crypto, whether it's Solana or anything else in the United States, they just won't do it. And because it. Why would they? The company's worth 70, 80 billion dollars, depending on what the secondary share market is trading. Why would they make that move if they felt like there was existential risk to crypto in the United States? Furthermore, why is Visa doing that? Why did PayPal launch their own stable coin?
00:33:22.981 - 00:33:23.381, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:23.453 - 00:33:34.101, Speaker A: These are publicly traded, regulated companies that are doing these things. So could they all be wrong? Yes. What's the percentage chance that's the case? Infinitesimally small.
00:33:34.213 - 00:33:34.605, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:34.685 - 00:34:18.641, Speaker A: And so from my perspective, the existential risk is a left tail event that's so small that you almost have to discount it to zero. You can't discount it entirely to zero, but you have to almost discount it to zero, because look at what else is happening in the industry in the United States right now. So I, you know, maybe I'm just a little bit too optimistic. Excuse me. I don't see the existential risk. What I actually see is asymmetric upside for these companies that are actually investing and putting real resource behind shepherding in the United States as the leader in web3 blockchain and cryptocurrency.
00:34:18.833 - 00:34:59.338, Speaker B: Yeah, good bow to put on the politics section. Joe, there's a tweet I want to bring to you and get your take on. So Ray, who's the CEO of L1D, tweeted this week, quote, liquid funds are more active in Meme coins than you would expect. Portfolio construction benefits too good to ignore. Managers keeping it hush hush for now. If those have major positive P and L hits, it will suddenly be accepted. And this interested me just because I think the perception of meme coins is a thing that is predominantly traded by retail in like small amounts.
00:34:59.338 - 00:35:13.995, Speaker B: Asymmetric obviously has been involved in MOTHER and other meme coins Bonk. I guess. But I don't know. Are you seeing this as well? What's sort of your take on the professional investors getting into the meme coin world narrative?
00:35:14.615 - 00:36:04.865, Speaker A: Yeah, so yes, I was the first institution to buy meme coin. It was bonk. Worked out really well for us. But it was also a validation of my thesis around the tokenization of, you know, Internet culture and institutions have limited partners known as investors to make money for. And if you are stuck in layer one or infrastructure or DeFi, all of these things are radically underperforming meme coins and a lot of the, you know, you mentioned, they keep it hush hush. Isn't that interesting? You're going to be quiet about the thing that makes you the most money.
00:36:05.645 - 00:36:06.197, Speaker C: What?
00:36:06.301 - 00:36:31.619, Speaker A: Why? Because most managers are afraid to talk about something that may not be intelligent, which is the opposite. If you're intelligent, you would have identified that meme coins are going to be a fundamental construct for digital assets portfolio going forward a long time ago. Am I patting myself on the back? Of course.
00:36:31.707 - 00:36:33.547, Speaker C: But it's true, right?
00:36:33.691 - 00:37:30.243, Speaker A: Because a lot of these folks that go out and raise money, they sell a story. Defi is going to change finance. All everything's going to be running on, you know, Ethereum, Rails and this and that. And it's like, oops, you have now radically underperformed something called mother, right? Like, you know what I mean? Like, it's just, it's ridiculous. And so, you know, I've said this time and again that my job as a hedge fund manager is to make my LPs money. And we don't have this absurdly, you know, intellectually biased or elitist perspective on what we trade because our job is to make our LPs money. And if you're a hedge fund manager and you're justifying your positions through fundamentals that, oh well, you know, AAVE has this much protocol revenue on a price to earnings ratio.
00:37:30.243 - 00:37:51.335, Speaker A: It should be valued at this. No one cares, right? No one cares. And those are last, you know, cycles tokens. I saw this thing today on, on my. One of my. This guy I follow on Instagram. I did his podcast when Shift happens It's a really good podcast and it was this montage of like three guys.
00:37:51.335 - 00:38:28.253, Speaker A: It was, the timing was crazy. The first guy said, he's like, what's your prediction for this year? And he's like, I think defi tokens are going to hit new all time highs. So. And he literally said like, you know, ave maker, etc whatever. The second guy said I would be Max long Ethereum and not Long Salana because of the, you know, the regulatory environment all. And the other guy said like I would avoid meme coins. I was like, every single one of these guys could not be more wrong because they're not in tune or in touch with what's actually happening.
00:38:28.253 - 00:39:12.585, Speaker A: And they may also be suffering from what we call bag holder bias that they can't see past this view that they have. I think one of the things that we do at Asymmetric is we constantly question our perspectives. Am I actually crazy to think that meme coins are going to explode and the real time tokenization of viral content and engagement on the Internet is wrong? Like I question that all the time. I'm yet to see the evidence to support that claim. And so if you have a view that meme coins are. What is the dude's name? He's Vance from Framework. He said, said some nonsense like yo, well pump fun slowing down, Solana's over.
00:39:12.585 - 00:39:42.367, Speaker A: When the meme coin craze is done, it's like, oops, wrong again. That's not happening. The opposite is happening. And it's because if you have, you know, huge Ethereum bags and you, you are seeing what's happening on something like Salana that's a direct competitor to your P and L as well as your, you know, fundamental views on what's happening in crypto in general. And Vance is not alone. There's lots of people out there like that. Unfortunately they're all going to underperform if they are actually liquid fund managers.
00:39:42.367 - 00:39:58.573, Speaker A: So the long answer longer is yes, these guys are actually getting involved in meme coins because they have to. Are they going to talk about it? They'll talk about it if they have a good performing year. And if they don't, they're definitely not going to say anything. Yeah.
00:39:58.749 - 00:40:26.121, Speaker B: What do you make of parallels maybe drawn between the 2021 NFT craze and following huge crash in the NFT market that's yet to recover and what we're seeing today? Like essentially the argument that every crypto cycle has its speculative flavor. Meme coins are this one. But long term it could end up looking like how meme NFTs look today.
00:40:26.193 - 00:40:31.321, Speaker A: All that's true. Every cycle has its speculative mania. Yet ICOs, you had NFTs, now you have Meme Coins.
00:40:31.393 - 00:40:32.005, Speaker C: Great.
00:40:34.025 - 00:41:05.125, Speaker A: The way that I look at it is kind of like software, meaning when, when you ship software you have like version 1.0. Those that was the ICO craze. Then there was version 2.0 which were NFTs, and then you have version 3.0 right now, which is Meme Coins. But software is, if you keep shipping new major releases of a software product, it's improving.
00:41:05.505 - 00:41:05.889, Speaker C: Right.
00:41:05.937 - 00:41:59.639, Speaker A: So what did the ICO craze do? Well, it did bring in number one, a ton of capital, but also users into web3. What did NFTs do? It brought in more capital and users particularly, you know, call it like the creative or more like normie side of of the world into crypto. What are Meme Coins doing? Arguably onboarding the most new users without like Bitcoin trading $100,000 and every TradFi media outlet covering it and getting baby boomers and retail to pile in at the top. Like it's onboarding more and more people into the ecosystem of web3. So do I think that there's going to be some speculative mania and it's going to bust? Yeah, that's how markets work. The same thing happens in the stock market, the same thing happens in real estate. The same thing happened with toilet bulbs 400 years ago.
00:41:59.639 - 00:42:37.261, Speaker A: It's never going to change. The question is, are Meme Coins like go? Are are they going to be here to stay, so to speak. And the short answer is, is I don't know. What you'll end up with is a new major release of the software version 4.0 that could look totally different than Meme Coins. I do think that there's a point to be made about NFTs versus meme coins and the crash in the NFT markets is it's almost like duh, light bulb moment is like non fungible token versus we can create a trillion of these. Which one has better distribution? Right.
00:42:37.261 - 00:42:45.725, Speaker A: Like we, you know, I think people, myself included, I have a huge NFT collection that I don't even look at because I'm just like the value of it is de minimis at this point.
00:42:45.765 - 00:42:46.345, Speaker C: Right.
00:42:46.925 - 00:43:14.219, Speaker A: Relative to where it was. But in that moment of 2020 and 2021 we also were, you know, Covid money printing airdrop free money to people. Like people were also just stuck on their computers at home and on their phones. So it was A it was a moment in time where you had a combination of things that were absolutely affecting what was happening not just in crypto but also in traditional markets. We don't have that now.
00:43:14.347 - 00:43:14.635, Speaker C: Right.
00:43:14.675 - 00:43:51.149, Speaker A: We're not all, you know, in our homes, you know, avoiding a pandemic and we're not all getting free money and we're not zero percent interest rates. In fact, we're the opposite of that. But we're still seeing a lot of onboarding into the ecosystem through things like meme coins. And I mean look, 99.9% of the meme coins on that are created on pump fun are zeros or minus 99%. So one could argue you already have the collapse in the speculative bubble. The difference is it's trivial to keep creating new meme coins and keep trying to capture the engagement.
00:43:51.149 - 00:44:18.007, Speaker A: Which is why I get back to this point of it being more like a video game. It's or you know, buying a lottery ticket or something to that effect. Like I think that the number of people that have made a million dollars plus on pump phone tokens is like 0.00003%. You know, that's, that's kind of lottery ticket odds. It's the same thing. And so are people going to stop buying lottery tickets? Nope. Are people going to stop buying the brand new meme coin? Nope.
00:44:18.007 - 00:44:36.055, Speaker A: It's going to keep happening. I think the difference is will see valuations at some blow off top moment. Whether it's in 2025 or 2026, a lot of people are going to get burned. Welcome to speculation. That is exactly what has been happening for hundreds of years and it's never going to change.
00:44:38.195 - 00:45:12.471, Speaker B: Maybe last question on this like markets talk but I don't want to put you on the spot too much here but you spoke a bit about you know, at Asymmetric you really believe in questioning your assumptions. Throughout this episode we've talked a lot about reasons that you're bullish on soul. You very vocally have been for some time. What would the conditions be in your view for you to be wrong? Like say that this is somehow the sole top or there's a Harris win something. What are the conditions for your Solana thesis to be wrong in your view?
00:45:12.543 - 00:46:08.665, Speaker A: So at a high level and this, this is like a somewhat of a lagging indicator because it takes time to to be able to digest would be and I I think I mentioned this on the last time I did this a year ago. The risk to Solana is a poor developer go to market currently we don't have that problem. Developers love to build on Solana. There are absolutely areas that we can improve and the Dev Rel team is doing a phenomenal job of addressing those current concerns in public. So my concern has always been how do you continue to capture the mindshare of developers? I ran an open source company called Node Source, which back to the Node JS open source project and like getting, getting that developer go to market. Right. Is so incredibly critical for the, for the health and growth of any open source project.
00:46:08.665 - 00:46:23.239, Speaker A: And Solana is no different. So if you, if you don't focus on onboarding developers and meeting them where they are, then you have a potential existential risk.
00:46:23.327 - 00:46:23.955, Speaker C: Right.
00:46:24.615 - 00:46:42.325, Speaker A: So that's more, you know, broad strokes. What would be the thing that would, that's maybe more like, you know, specific or tactical. I would likely need to see activity completely plummet.
00:46:42.825 - 00:46:43.209, Speaker C: Right.
00:46:43.257 - 00:47:11.603, Speaker A: So if for example, Jito's tips just dramatically drops and for days or weeks at a time, then I would be concerned like what's happening? Why all of a sudden is there less activity or, or this extreme drop in activity? And these are very easy metrics to track. Jito's making new all time highs with, with their economic activity.
00:47:11.659 - 00:47:12.255, Speaker C: Right.
00:47:13.355 - 00:47:19.011, Speaker A: That's going to pull back at some point. How deep is the pullback and how long is that pullback?
00:47:19.123 - 00:47:19.635, Speaker C: Right.
00:47:19.755 - 00:47:33.345, Speaker A: Those are aspects that I would look into and that's just one example. I mean there's myriad other ones, stable coin flows, you know, etc. That would be something that would give me concern because where is that activity now?
00:47:33.725 - 00:47:34.085, Speaker C: Right?
00:47:34.125 - 00:48:13.511, Speaker A: Because it's unlikely that all these people that are doing things on Solana stop doing that and don't go someplace else. Do they go to sei, right? Maybe do they go to like aptos or swe maybe do they go to Ethereum? Maybe. But that would be something that I would want to see is if there's a serious drop in the economic activity of the network as well as like stablecoin flows out of Solana. That would make me question whether or not like, all right, this is just like, you know, kind of a head fake breakout of this range trade that we've been in for a very long time.
00:48:13.623 - 00:48:57.415, Speaker B: So Joe, you're involved in Venture, the like Solana Venture world as well. There's one kind of specific venture question I want to ask you and then we're going to get out of here. But the stripe bridge acquisition this week brought up a lot of conversations I think among VC folks I talked to that now you have another exit for equity. So until the present, kind of outside of bitcoin mining stocks, the only crypto company to my knowledge to IPO has been Coinbase. So investors haven't seen exits on their equity unless they have tokens that they can sell, essentially. And this is not an ideal state of affairs. I think most people would agree.
00:48:57.415 - 00:49:19.495, Speaker B: But this Stripe Bridge acquisition raised the question of, okay, if you have an M and A market, you could see returns that way. Maybe also IPOs next year can, can heat up. What's, what's your take on all of this? Where do you think things are most likely going as far as the ways crypto VCs are able to realize returns?
00:49:20.995 - 00:50:02.597, Speaker A: Yeah, so the, the Bridge acquisition, you know, I talked earlier about Stripe being this kind of canonical perfection of a elite Silicon Valley backed, you know, startup. But the acquisition of Bridge, also by Stripe, also now gives agency and comfort to traditional Web2 Silicon Valley VCS that hey, there are exit potentials in Web3 and crypto. I'm now allowed to play in that space.
00:50:02.741 - 00:50:03.425, Speaker C: Right.
00:50:03.765 - 00:50:52.929, Speaker A: And I just saw Lightspeed just raise an $8 billion fund. Good luck deploying all of that. Clearly, like all of it's going into AI. But I do think that the signaling to investors, specifically Silicon Valley VCs that are not really touching crypto is pretty powerful. Furthermore, at full disclosure, I'm an investor in Circle and it is no surprise they publicly mentioned that they are looking to go public. Well, with an acquisition of something like Bridge, with what my understanding is an incredibly high multiple against their revenues that favors a Circle ipo. Now a lot of things have to go right.
00:50:52.929 - 00:51:44.305, Speaker A: You know, you don't want to necessarily IPO in a recession, you don't want to IPO in a toxic regulatory environment. You don't want to IPO if you're, you know, you're not growing and hitting your targets like you're expecting. Right. There's a lot of things that have to still go right for the Circle team. But I do think you're going to see a Circle IPO next year and I don't think that that's going to be the last one. I also think that there's a really good time for a lot of these startups that raise at absurdly high valuations, which I always recommend against in the last cycle to consolidate amongst, you know, some of the kind of column category winners. And the Bridge acquisition is likely the kind of, you know, the first mover catalyst, if you will, for these types of plays.
00:51:44.305 - 00:52:41.645, Speaker A: As you know, you see the larger companies like, you know, I'm completely speculating, but like Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, they all have like, cloud computing services and platforms. There's a lot of Web3 companies out there that could be picked off at a relatively cheap price to bolster and support a lot of the stuff that they will need to do with Web3 and crypto. And so, yes, as a VC, I'm talking my own book here and I'm obviously biased, but I do believe that if a lot of these things happen, there's obviously, if Trump wins and the regulatory environment becomes much clearer and cleaner now, investors can start investing in more startups that are in Web3 now, other companies will be looking at acquiring these types of businesses because they're going to need to bolster that aspect of their, of their, you know, offerings, et cetera. And you should see a lot more of these, I think, in 2025 and 2026.
00:52:42.665 - 00:52:53.605, Speaker B: Interesting. Yeah, well, it will be something to keep an eye on, but that is all the time we have for today. Joe, it's been really good having you on the show. Thanks for sharing all of your takes and best of luck in the trenches.
00:52:54.145 - 00:52:55.097, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:52:55.281 - 00:52:56.825, Speaker B: Absolutely. Take care. We'll see you in the next one.
