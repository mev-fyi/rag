00:00:00.410 - 00:00:20.714, Speaker A: We're not winning until Salana is at least a billion TVL. And the next step is like ten Xing everything, right? Tvl volume users, what are the ways to Ten X? The problem that we can solve for Salana is to drive liquidity. Let's drive broader liquidity for new tokens that are coming up because they need deep liquidity to build confidence and trust in their projects.
00:00:20.762 - 00:00:48.726, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by Das London, blockwork's number one institutional crypto conference, where all the top institutions and people in crypto are going to be this march in London. What's becoming maybe the crypto hub of the world. Have a link in the show notes where you can learn more and also discount code that will get you 20% off. So click the link, find out more and I'll see you. There's what's up, everybody. Welcome to another episode of Lightspeed. Today we are joined by Ben Chow, the co founder of Meteora.
00:00:48.726 - 00:00:50.140, Speaker B: Ben, welcome to the show.
00:00:50.670 - 00:00:55.114, Speaker A: Thank you for having me. Excited to see you guys and chat again.
00:00:55.312 - 00:01:05.934, Speaker B: Yeah, we're pumped to have you back on. We just had Ted Livingston on. He was the first guest to come on twice. And now you're number two. So pumped to have you. I want to get deep into Meteora and some of the strategy and what's coming next. Before we do.
00:01:05.934 - 00:01:13.460, Speaker B: Meteora has a really interesting story, so I'd love to get that origin story from you and kind of that shift in branding and so forth and the learnings you've had over the last few years.
00:01:14.550 - 00:01:39.994, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, let's get started. I think we're one of the OG projects in Salana now, which is just crazy to even think about it because this was 2021 when we launched. But for those who don't know, our first project was called Mercury Finance, and we raised money on that. We had a token that was called.
00:01:40.032 - 00:01:40.650, Speaker C: Mer.
00:01:42.430 - 00:02:49.582, Speaker A: And we were part of that cohort of DFI projects that came out in 2021 and did a bunch of whole FTX style launches. And for those who don't know, Mercurial Finance was the first stable amm on Salana. And actually, I think at our peak, we had over 200 million in TVL. We were the largest source of UST liquidity along with before terra collapse. For those don't know, there was a point in time when that happened and then we were the largest stable liquidity provider for a while. And then Saber also launched and did Saber sunny and sort of, we were in a stable Amm war at that point. So what happened was that when FTX collapsed last year, a large portion of mer holdings were in FTX, and the FTX hacker actually also took off with those funds.
00:02:49.582 - 00:04:28.350, Speaker A: And so the token itself, that created a lot of uncertainty around the token. A lot of the Defi tokens from that era weren't doing well anyway. And the collapse just accelerated a lot of that too. And we took this time to be like, look, let's reset the whole thing where we built a new technical foundation, create a whole new protocol called Meteora, and we create an entirely new token with clean tokenomics and give 20% of that to our Mer holders, right? And this not only cleaned up sort of the FTX side and sort of the things that happened, but because we were also in an aggressive sort of mini bull market emissions war with Saber, this sort of reset the whole thing, right? And we had a lot of learnings based on that time and that love to share, but one of the things we wanted to do was that we had been really building out these core technical foundations for what is now Meteora to tackle some major problems with Dexes. One of the major problems is sustainability, right? So for the most part, and people always say this about amms, most people make money on the farming rewards, right? Not really on the fees. And also the Dexes themselves, I don't know how many people know this, but the Dexes themselves are not that sustainable. A lot of them don't even charge protocol fees.
00:04:28.350 - 00:05:48.874, Speaker A: They're reliant on their own protocol treasury. And that may work for a short period of time, but over, if you think about wanting a protocol that will last like a decade plus, that will be able to survive multiple cycles, you need to have really strong protocol and LP revenue. And so we started building that foundation back over a year ago, and the first leg of that was to build this lending aggregator. So that's very composable that we use in our amm pools. That allows lps to earn from lending yields and trading fees, right. What's been really cool is that we now have some of the most sustainable liquidity pools for stable lps. So you can go into, for example, our USDC USDT pool, or some of our LST pools, like our USDC USDT pool has like about 8% APY, right? Which is, I mean, not as crazy as some of the volatile stuff, but for stable, no impermanent loss, it's better than the fed rate.
00:05:48.874 - 00:06:06.830, Speaker A: And it's on a huge base. That pool is like three and a half million dollars so far. And it's all fees like lending yield and trading fees. There's no farming rewards, there's no incentives. We're just trying to maximize the fees for lps.
00:06:06.910 - 00:06:07.442, Speaker C: Right?
00:06:07.576 - 00:06:31.530, Speaker B: Yeah, Ben, at a simplified level, just so the users following along, is it essentially you'll put your liquidity into your amm, which will then get deposited into one of these lending pools to earn additional yield. Is that almost kind of like Wi Fi? That's on Ethereum. They have these vaults, for example, so you can deposit your assets in there and it'll deploy automatically across different strategies, trying to find the highest risk adjusted yield.
00:06:32.430 - 00:08:04.706, Speaker A: Yes, but it's composable. So basically, when you deposit in our AmM pools, you're earning trading fees, but the capital that's not being used to power the trades or the swaps is being lent out to the lending protocols to earn yield and then pulled back when it's needed for the swaps, which is like something that is only possible on Solana. And actually, I think there's a massive opportunity in this vault system to take idle capital anywhere in a wallet, in a contract, and earn yield on it when it's not in use, and then pull it back and use it and then redeploy it out. This is actually for those in tradfi, this is like most businesses make money this way, like on the float, right? If you look at Robinhood, for example, they don't charge any trade fees, right? And that's how they're able to get a lot of users. Like, look, you don't have to pay a fee when you trade. So how do they make money, right? They take that capital and when it's not in use, they earn interest on it and they make money on that interest. The really cool part about this is that, and if you look at v one of DFI right now is that everyone is competing on fees, right? Like, if I want to get more users, if I want my users to make more money, I have to charge them lower and lower fees to be competitive.
00:08:04.706 - 00:08:38.194, Speaker A: And that's like a race to zero. So basically that says all the protocols are like, hey, for me to be competitive, I have to make less money, which is not sustainable, right? You have to pay your team, you have to pay your operating costs. That's crazy, right? To break free of that model, you need to be able to earn money in other ways. And this other way could be just earning money on the idle capital. You did all this work to build up your TVL and you have idle capital sitting in your protocol and you could make money, like earning yield off of it.
00:08:38.232 - 00:08:38.578, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:38.664 - 00:09:11.994, Speaker A: And share some of that yield with your users. And then that yield is no longer something where you charge your users up front to make yourself less competitive. It frees you up in a massive way. So I think there's, like this big opportunity that this system that we've built will open up. It just needs defi to be a little. I think it'll be more relevant sort of in the next bull cycle or the coming bull cycle as teams get bigger.
00:09:12.042 - 00:09:12.640, Speaker C: But.
00:09:15.250 - 00:09:51.100, Speaker D: To just. We went a little technical, want to. I want to maybe zoom out a little more. So you guys did mercurial and then FTX happened, and then you founded Meteora, and then you guys also did Jupiter, I believe. And you're still doing Jupiter. Just going to mention that just for people's mental models, because it's a very complex world out there. What was the main shortcoming that you saw with the current state of defi that you're like, we must start meteoro like this Solana really needs.
00:09:52.270 - 00:09:52.730, Speaker C: Right.
00:09:52.800 - 00:09:59.510, Speaker D: Was it mostly kind of the fee emissions from other protocols and how you want us to have, I believe you called it sustainable yield.
00:09:59.590 - 00:09:59.894, Speaker A: Right.
00:09:59.952 - 00:10:04.240, Speaker D: Sustainability is a big theme. Was that like the main driving force behind.
00:10:06.130 - 00:10:39.734, Speaker A: If you. If you look at it. I'll just use Saber as an example. Saber did a really powerful trick where they dropped their fees to zero. Nobody was making money on the fees, and they used the volume metric as a way to kind of pump their token price. And then the token emissions was how people made money, and they focused on that.
00:10:39.772 - 00:10:40.214, Speaker C: Right.
00:10:40.332 - 00:10:46.118, Speaker A: There's a problem with that. The problem is that that mechanic, while powerful in a bull, does not work in a bear.
00:10:46.214 - 00:10:46.474, Speaker C: Right.
00:10:46.512 - 00:11:02.286, Speaker A: Because token prices don't go up in a bear. Kind of like what you saw and what's problematic is like, look, if you try these bull market tactics, you will die in the bear. You are not building a protocol for the long run.
00:11:02.388 - 00:11:02.846, Speaker C: Right.
00:11:02.948 - 00:11:07.230, Speaker A: You need to build mechanics that are going to sustain you through any cycle.
00:11:07.310 - 00:11:07.746, Speaker C: Right.
00:11:07.848 - 00:11:33.190, Speaker A: And that means you need to build up real revenue, real sustainable revenue. And that was like the big problem we started to tackle at the end of. During 2022. And we are continuing to build these liquidity systems that improve lp profitability protocol profitability and sustainability in all dexes.
00:11:33.350 - 00:12:09.830, Speaker B: One thing that a lot of investors like Kyle Simani and multicoin will talk about salana for years now, is that you can build new use cases, new products that you can do on Ethereum. And one of those is like amms versus clobs. But what's interesting is that mercurial and meteora is an amm. And I think even 46% of the volume right now roughly goes through orca, which is also an amm. So I'm just curious how you think about that. And you're leaning into TVL here because you're talking about, like, the more TVL we have, the more we can put across these lending protocols and generate sustainable yield. That also kind of goes against the normal ethos of Solana, which is like, no, it's all about capital efficiency, not TVL.
00:12:11.850 - 00:12:27.654, Speaker A: Yeah, this is really the, the thing is, it's like, all right, the reason why people are so against TVL is that TVL can be gamed, is gamed through various things. And it's not a real leading metric.
00:12:27.702 - 00:12:27.914, Speaker C: Right.
00:12:27.952 - 00:12:43.014, Speaker A: You really need economic activity, trading volume. These things are a little bit harder to game and they're a better leading metric for real traction. But you still need TVL.
00:12:43.082 - 00:12:43.700, Speaker C: Right.
00:12:45.270 - 00:13:53.826, Speaker A: And the reason why is that to make Salana a true trading hub in crypto, right, any trader has to be able to trade at size with minimal impact. So if I want to trade a million dollars of pith, I can't do that today. If I want to move $10 million from eth or polygon into salana with little price impact and little fees, I can't do that, right? If I want to trade, you can't even do like 10 million, say, in sole USDC, I think, without hitting definitely greater than 5% impact, maybe more. So this is a barrier for institutionals, this is a barrier for heavy traders. It may not be as much of a problem now because we have a lot of retail traders, but we need to set the groundwork for this tv. We need to build this liquidity because all these institutionals and these whales are going to be attracted to all this retail organic trading. They're going to be like, wow, look at these volumes.
00:13:53.826 - 00:14:50.220, Speaker A: They're great, right? And I want to trade, I want to move my capital in. I want to do it in the most efficient way possible. And you have to have that liquidity set up beforehand, because when they want to move their capital, they're going to want to do it frictionlessly. And if they can't, they're going to be like, oh, I can't, forget it, or maybe I'll DCA in. But that takes several steps and they can't just move. So it's a little bit early, but I think we have to do it now before waiting, before Solana gets bigger and people start feeling the pain and the issues like, why can't I do this? And I think both Solana is in a great place now than say, even a few months ago. And Meteora is also prepared with its upcoming launch to really set the groundwork for this.
00:14:50.910 - 00:15:29.118, Speaker D: So you just mentioned something interesting, which is price impact when you're making large trades. And a few weeks ago, maybe months ago now, I noticed a few Ethereum people coming over from Ethereum to Solana and they kind of had this meme where it's like, okay, now I came on Solana, I can now stake my soul and then stake my soul again and then stake my soul again. And then maybe like swaps, like big, big size swaps would give them some too much price impact. So now fast forward to current date. Assume somebody from Ethereum comes over or maybe just somebody who's new to crypto comes over and they're now on Solana.
00:15:29.134 - 00:15:29.266, Speaker C: Right.
00:15:29.288 - 00:15:44.620, Speaker D: They have a phantom or sole player or backpack wallet and they go on Meteora. So can you maybe give us like a masterclass? Like, what can I now do on Meteora? What are some things I can do? What are some things you recommend doing? Just maybe walk us through that entire platform.
00:15:45.870 - 00:15:46.522, Speaker C: Sure.
00:15:46.656 - 00:16:14.030, Speaker A: Well, today we're probably the best place for stable liquidity and LST liquidity. So if you're an LP and you're very passive, you're like, look, I don't want to take directional risk. I don't want to market make. I just want to take my stable like I have USDC USDT or something. I just want to take it, earn some yield. You can earn around 8% now. It's all stable.
00:16:14.030 - 00:16:59.278, Speaker A: You can set it, set it and forget it. Don't have to market make. And when you need it to do something, you can pull it out and do something and we'll get you the best yield. You don't even have to think about farming rewards or when it ends or anything, just set it. Similarly, if you're getting into SOl and staking and you're taking positions in MSOL GdOSOL BSoL LST and you want to earn extra yield on that, you could LP into our LST pools, which are similar. You don't have to worry about a permanent loss. They're stable.
00:16:59.278 - 00:17:29.574, Speaker A: They earn incredible fees because they're concentrated and they earn from lending and trade fees as well. And you could also set it and forget it. You don't have to market make, you don't have to think about your positions. You don't have to worry about a permanent loss. You just want to push capital here, earn some money and come back later and use it or something. That's really great and you can do that today. The other thing that we're doing is that all our pools are permissionless.
00:17:29.574 - 00:18:19.574, Speaker A: So if you're a token project and you want to launch your own community coin, it only takes 1 minute and you can set up a pool with any token pair on Solana, it goes live in a minute and it gets integrated into Jupiter within a few minutes. And we have some of the highest price tiers as well. So if you want to provide, if you're the sole liquidity provider for your token, you can actually make some good money on the fees there. Some people have taken advantage of. So for example, Jupiter has the JLP token, which is capped, so no one can really buy it directly. So the secondary markets are the only way other people can buy that token. A lot of people like that token.
00:18:19.574 - 00:18:45.380, Speaker A: So early people created a Meteora JLP pool with like 6% fees. It was like really high and they were making a lot of money on the secondary in the beginning. It's gotten much more price competitive now, so that you can't really do that in the long run, but it's completely permissionless and if you move fast, you can take advantage of it.
00:18:45.830 - 00:19:07.030, Speaker D: Awesome. So just to reiterate, you can park stables and get 8%, which is pretty high. I mean, Canada is even at 5%. So I will be doing that after this show and then earn extra yield on your lsts and then three launch community coins. So that's the current state of Meteora.
00:19:07.110 - 00:19:27.518, Speaker B: Quick break to tell you about an upcoming event. I promise you don't want to miss. It's blockwork's biggest and best institutional conference called Das London. It's a two day event happening in London this March. We're going to have over 700 institutions, 130 speakers, and a couple of thousand of us all under one roof. Crypto is in a position for the first time to actually onboard these institutions and they're showing up. We have companies from Blackrock to visa launching real products in the space.
00:19:27.518 - 00:19:50.214, Speaker B: We have the real world asset narrative taking off. We have things like payments that have been exponentially growing, and then we have things like deepen happening in the Salana ecosystem. There's a ton of capital right now in this institutional space is going to be coming on chain. It's going to completely change the industry. Whether you are an institution or you're a retail user, or you just want to learn more about what's going on in the space, this conference is for you. You're going to be able to meet some of the best and smartest people in the space. The speaker lineup is absolutely incredible and you'll get to hang out with me.
00:19:50.214 - 00:20:04.800, Speaker B: But the best part is you actually get 20% off your ticket if you use Lightspeed 20 when checking out. That's light speed 20. I put a link in the show notes. I recommend buying this today because one, you'll forget about it. Two, these ticket price go up every single month. So anyways, I hope to see you there. Now, let's get back to the show.
00:20:06.050 - 00:20:13.460, Speaker D: Maybe give us some alpha, like what is going forward? What are you going to be adding to Meteora? How is the platform going to evolve and what are you most excited about?
00:20:14.550 - 00:21:24.280, Speaker A: Yeah, so we are moving into this incredible big next phase for Meteora. So we call it like it's our three pronged plan to grow Solana TBO, right? And it's going to include a new technical liquidity platform, a DAO that will be stacked with DeFi experts that will be focused on growing TVL and a set of massive incentives for lps to grow liquidity on our new DLM for Meteora, for Solana. I think it's the right time to do this. We need massive liquidity in a number of big areas, right? Like, for example, ETH and BTC. Liquidity is still too low to really be trading. And Solana is such a great place to trade those assets cheaply with very little fees. But you just can't do it at size.
00:21:24.280 - 00:21:54.670, Speaker A: We still need useful bridging liquidity salon itself is moving into forex trading. We still need lots of trading on that and deeper liquidity around rwas, as well as even just more liquidity around solust and some of the other really popular tokens that are coming out. But our current set of pools weren't really designed for these types of pairs.
00:21:54.750 - 00:21:55.378, Speaker C: Right?
00:21:55.544 - 00:23:15.980, Speaker A: So we're about to launch what we call our DLMM, our dynamic liquidity market maker, which is a new concentrated liquidity amm on Solana that will be important in two ways. One, it should help improve LP profitability. And it does this because this will be the first concentrated liquidity amm to have dynamic fees, which is like super cool, right? And basically the fee will increase as the price volatility increases, right? So if there's a lot of trading and Seoul price is pumping, right, the price is changing and rapidly shifts, right. Basically, traders at that point, traders are less sensitive to fees, right? Like they're going to take that 1% price impact or whatever it is, to try to ape into that token or buy that token. And that's the time where you want to be able to grow your fees to capture some of that fee revenue from those trades. And our system will do it automatically. And right now we have a pool that we've been trying out that's doing really well, but it can go as high as 10% in fees, which is like insanely high.
00:23:15.980 - 00:24:33.620, Speaker A: And this thing will just on its own, you don't have to do anything, it just works. The second really powerful attribute about the DLVM is that this is hard to share without graphs, but it's this zero slippage, bin based thing, a bin based approach to liquidity, which you can think of it as like getting closer to limit order book. It's some hybrid between Amm and limit order book, but the real benefit is that you can precisely concentrate your liquidity and it opens up so it's more capital efficient than the current stuff, and it opens up the door to a whole number richer LP strategies. And all these new use cases that I think are going to be very interesting to Solana. One of them is that you can use this to precisely DCA into a token. You can also use this if you want to bootstrap liquidity for a token. You can design your own bonding curve without writing any program code.
00:24:33.620 - 00:25:31.270, Speaker A: You don't have to do any of that. You just literally draw your own curve and sell your token on the curve. It's one sided, right? And you'll get all the benefits that I talked about, which is like the dynamic fees. Actually, one really cool thing will be the ability to sell your token on this bonding curve and then take the profits from that and be able to set up a buyback price so you can kind of guarantee a minimum floor price for your token if you're launching a token on our platform. And that'll be like a really cool feature that usually other token projects had to write code for, get it audited. Hopefully they didn't make any mistakes or anything. And after we launch this thing, you won't have to do that anymore.
00:25:31.270 - 00:25:37.702, Speaker A: No code is needed, really. And you can do these really interesting things.
00:25:37.836 - 00:25:59.470, Speaker B: That reminds me a bit of uniswap before with their hooks, and people can think of it as plugins. You can do all these customized strategies that other people deploy. It sounds really complicated too. Like as a liquidity provider, what am I going to do? So is that where the vaults come into this as well, because if I'm just a typical retail person, I'm not really sure what my strategy should be to optimize profitability. Is that where the vaults will play a role?
00:26:02.630 - 00:26:22.550, Speaker A: I need to distinguish a few things. Our current vaults are lending aggregator vaults, not market making vaults. We're actually working with a really good launch partner for vaults. So we will have for people who want to access the power of our DLM but don't want to actively market.
00:26:22.620 - 00:26:23.240, Speaker C: Make.
00:26:25.450 - 00:26:31.530, Speaker A: They'Ll be able to use our partner vaults to do the automatic market making for them.
00:26:31.600 - 00:26:32.220, Speaker C: Right.
00:26:33.150 - 00:27:15.750, Speaker A: So that's going to be coming very soon. It's going to be pretty cool. We're going to probably stack incentives on that. But then also I still think the best utilization for an AMM or any LP, to be honest, is to be more active. The best way to manage your yields and reduce impermanent loss is just to be more active and you can choose how active you want to be like every day, every week, every month. But the more active you are, the better it is. And so completely passive.
00:27:15.750 - 00:27:32.250, Speaker A: Liquidity just is not as performant. These auto vaults do a good job, but I do recommend for advanced things like the deal. Now to take the full usage of it, you do need to be a little bit more active.
00:27:33.710 - 00:27:44.610, Speaker B: So Salana has token 22 coming out and they have transfer hooks. They're going to allow you to run programs before swap or some other action happens with the token. Is that something meteor is working on or you see leveraging?
00:27:46.550 - 00:28:05.750, Speaker A: Probably in the future we'll do it. I think it's early, to be honest, actually we're kind of in the frontier mode of that to be. So a lot of people who are interested in trying out new tokenomics.
00:28:07.690 - 00:28:08.066, Speaker C: You.
00:28:08.108 - 00:29:20.640, Speaker A: Kind of gravitate towards token 22, but not all the wallets support it yet. You can't compose on top of it quite a bit. That standard is actually fairly tricky because each token project can carve out which permissions it wants, which feature sets it wants for itself, and then it's on the integrator. So if you're a dex, it's your responsibility to make sure that you follow those feature sets. You conform to those feature sets, so the permission transfers and private transfers or something, because the burden is on the protocols to implement those things. I think adoption will be slower than we think, and it needs more critical mass of adoption before maybe a few big tokens to come out before I think we will actually go in on it. So anyway, I think it's early, but there are really cool features there.
00:29:21.890 - 00:29:39.720, Speaker D: Yeah. And if you are watching this and you want to work with it, Helios does have support for it, so give it a try. Okay, so DLMM is the big new thing coming out. What is the timeline for that? When can people kind of start playing around with this?
00:29:42.410 - 00:30:15.810, Speaker A: Like any day. In fact, if you're really interested, it's already on main net and in a number of people have been privately using it. So we'll be announcing really soon this whole thing. And yeah, it's pretty cool. I don't know if you saw a Tweet. I just did a tweet yesterday on a little bit of a screen share.
00:30:15.960 - 00:30:16.322, Speaker C: Oh.
00:30:16.376 - 00:30:31.942, Speaker A: The really cool thing is you can watch in real time as trades happen against your liquidity and watch your swap fees grow and your balances change. It's really sick. So I don't think anyone's ever seen that before, but it's pretty cool to watch.
00:30:32.076 - 00:30:33.350, Speaker B: Did you tweet that?
00:30:33.500 - 00:30:34.662, Speaker A: Yeah, I did tweet it out.
00:30:34.716 - 00:30:37.362, Speaker B: I'll put it in the show notes. If you're listening, go check that out.
00:30:37.516 - 00:31:21.958, Speaker A: Yeah, it's kind of addicting actually. I don't know. I was demoing and we have a testing group that's been trying it out and I was answering questions and I think in the time, it was like maybe 4 hours or so, I was doing all this stuff and talking to people. I think the liquidity I had made, like, I don't know, maybe $300 or something. $300 in the time that we're just talking. And that was because I was able to concentrate that liquidity super tightly, like really tightly. And the dynamic fee thing was going off and I was like, wow, this is cool.
00:31:21.958 - 00:31:51.680, Speaker A: I don't know. I'm really curious to see, as we open it up, we'll open it up in stages and what people do with it. I think it's going to be a powerful level up for anyone who wants to kind of try out some new lp strategies that they couldn't do before.
00:31:52.690 - 00:31:53.150, Speaker C: Cool.
00:31:53.220 - 00:32:06.260, Speaker D: Well, yeah, I'm pretty excited for that, especially watching it in real time. That's one of those little product improvements that you don't really think about, but once you see it, it's probably going to be pretty addicting, as you said.
00:32:07.850 - 00:32:08.454, Speaker A: Okay.
00:32:08.572 - 00:32:49.410, Speaker D: One of the things I'm interested here is, so you mentioned composability a lot, and a lot of the way that meteora helps with sustainable yield is because of composability on Solana. In a sense, I do have an unpopular opinion here. But one of the things that brings or opens the door to is going to be more risk, right? And specifically maybe cascading risk, like if event x happens and something, since everything is composable, a kind of domino effect all the way throughout the ecosystems. How do you think about that? How do you think about risk, risk management, et cetera?
00:32:50.390 - 00:32:52.580, Speaker A: Damn, that is a fantastic question.
00:32:54.390 - 00:32:54.706, Speaker C: Because.
00:32:54.728 - 00:33:33.470, Speaker A: We'Re butting up against this today, right? We're composing on all these lending protocols and people think that, okay, the more protocols you compose on, the more risk, which in a sense is true, right? But first of all, I'm a composable maxi because I think the end goal for DeFi is composability. That's the only way where we can unlock massive amounts of value that tradfi can't, right? We have to be able to compose, right? But risk is sort of a big friction or barrier into that. But if we don't overcome that, we don't get composability.
00:33:33.550 - 00:33:34.274, Speaker C: Right?
00:33:34.472 - 00:35:00.178, Speaker A: But here's where I think it works for us, because we compose, but we compose in an aggregated way, right? And so what has kind of happened as a lending aggregator is that we've become sort of the lending expert that is able to assess risk in real time, right? So we are as an aggregator not only assessing yield, but assessing risk every minute. We're looking at the utilization of the pools and that is our sort of metric for risk. And when it gets too risky, we pull out, right? And what's cool about this is that actually the dynamic the lending aggregator has been through, like three black swan events. The last one was when the Silicon Valley bank collapsed and USDC de pegged, which triggered liquidations on lending protocols, right? All our users'funds were safe. Why? Because we saw those liquidations and the utilization spike, and it's all software. The code just pulled out automatically, right? We'll withdraw faster than a human being reading crypto Twitter saying, holy shit, what's going on? And then having to go into their browser. Maybe it's not working because everything's congested.
00:35:00.178 - 00:35:12.526, Speaker A: They have to pay priority fees. You don't have to do that as a sort of Defi composable infrastructure. We're taking care of that for you automatically and quickly.
00:35:12.628 - 00:35:13.086, Speaker C: Right.
00:35:13.188 - 00:35:54.350, Speaker A: And we'll move faster than you. The way I see it is that, yes, there's more risk, but you have more sophisticated ways to deal with that risk. And we deal with it in a number of different ways. And the other important part of that is that we're transparent about. Here's our metrics for how we assess risk, which is we actually look at the team, the code, the protocol. Do you audit? We look at it operationally, like pool utilization. There's also new protocols coming up that are able to assess the underlying risk based on liquidity pools.
00:35:54.350 - 00:36:54.320, Speaker A: And this is all happening sort of continuously, right? It's not like a one off thing with us, I would say, because we do this too, we're not maximizing yield for people. It's sort of this balance risk adjusted thing. And I think this is the best way. I think it's turning out to be the best way to sort of approach risk in a composable way, because an end user doesn't understand the intricacies of the technical risk and the financial risk. Whereas as an aggregator, we have to, on behalf of our users and protocols that compose on top of us, we become that expert and we build in the operational infrastructure to deal with those things continuously. I don't know. It remains to be seen how things will play out, but so far I think it's working out really well.
00:36:55.170 - 00:37:19.554, Speaker B: It's such an interesting topic. I remember because you have to essentially bat some of these other protocols that you're integrating with. And I remember there was a lending protocol a few months back when you had this DPEG, I think, in USDC, and they had just hard coded USDC to equal one. Right? And so that wasn't the case in the market anymore. So everything kind of fell apart. But it also makes me think, I have to shill Salana for a second. It makes me think how hard it would be to audit across different protocols, but also chains.
00:37:19.554 - 00:38:05.400, Speaker B: So across l two s, like you're trying to compose across. That has to be so hard, because not only do you have bridging risk, you have smart contract risk, and then you have like chain risk and just sounds like impossible. And on top of that, if you want to make all these changes, like a quick sell or transfer, if you're using Ethereum, just like I used argent, which is even more expensive than using something like a metamask, because it's abstracted, the fees are so high, it makes you not want to take an action, which is also another risk. So that happened to me a lot. I'm curious, how is this? Can users see what, as an LP provider, can they see where their liquidity is going? Or is it more of a black box? Because I think of blockfi, which I think they had really good intentions, but obviously things just fell apart. And people had no idea where their funds were actually being deposited. So I'm curious, as a user, can I look and see easily where my deposit is going?
00:38:05.770 - 00:38:26.990, Speaker A: Yes. On our UI, you can see all the distributions for every vault, and it updates in real time. So every minute it's changing. And that's because we also update. This is something that you don't see in ethereum, because I don't think people believed us. We are moving capital around every minute because Solana is so cheap. We can do this.
00:38:26.990 - 00:39:11.900, Speaker A: And so if all of a sudden drift lending yields start to spike, you will see capital move out of, like, say, soland into drift or like, mango into drift. It'll happen like that all the time, and this is happening all the time, so it's really cool to see. And also, I will just say we've been quiet about the system for a long time because Solana Defi, six months ago, even more just wasn't there. Like, the lending yields were terrible. They were like below a percent or something. And so it was nothing to talk about. It was like, you can't really make much.
00:39:11.900 - 00:39:35.154, Speaker A: But because what's cool is, and this is what's great about bear market building. We were building all these systems. The yields were terrible because Solana Defi wasn't doing great, but we built the infra. Right now that Solana Defi is growing, lending yields are growing. Everything is growing. All this stuff becomes like, these really important flywheels. Lending yields grow.
00:39:35.154 - 00:40:14.400, Speaker A: So our aggregators grow, so our Amm yields grow because trading is also growing. So our amm pools are great because trading yields are hot, lending yield is hot, and everything is starting to stack on top of each other. If that was what we cared about in the beginning, we wouldn't have built that, right? We didn't want to solve these problems of sustainability. We wouldn't have done it because you couldn't get those yields in the bear market. They just didn't exist. But because it was really important to solve these longer term problems of like, okay, we need to improve fee generation, we need to improve sustainability. Let's do this work.
00:40:14.400 - 00:40:31.480, Speaker A: Even though it's not going to make anything in this bear market. And this is why I think you see these spikes in the bulls, because people have built that infra, and now when the bull turns around, all that infra starts multiplying the value of everything.
00:40:31.850 - 00:41:18.150, Speaker D: So, Ben, I'm looking at the meteor we. So you have a few things here. One is your multi pronged approach to driving liquidity in Solana, we talked a lot about sustainable and efficient protocols, which is one of the points here. The other two points are supportive community and long term liquidity partners. And then for upcoming steps, you have launched Dow and released, locked, met token to our stakeholders, and then bootstrapping long term partners and then sustaining, researching and developing new systems and mechanisms that can attract and grow liquidity over a long period of time. Curious if you can maybe talk a bit more about those things that we haven't touched on so far. They're in the docs.
00:41:19.130 - 00:41:20.438, Speaker A: Yeah. Love to.
00:41:20.524 - 00:41:21.174, Speaker C: All right.
00:41:21.292 - 00:42:03.298, Speaker A: So one of our goals is to make, look, actually, I said this, I tweeted about this earlier. I think we have really strong teams in Solana. We need stronger dows, right? We need dows that are going to push the boundaries of what decentralization should. So one of our goals is to make one of the most effective dows out there. And we're trying it out in a few different ways. One is that we're going to have a highly focused dow. Like, basically, our Dow has one goal, one initial goal, and that is grow Salana TVL right.
00:42:03.298 - 00:42:08.262, Speaker A: And it will have 80% of our token to play with in doing that.
00:42:08.316 - 00:42:08.918, Speaker C: Right.
00:42:09.084 - 00:42:35.822, Speaker A: Okay. The second thing that we're doing is we're collecting the best DeFi experts to help us, to help the Dow push forward strong proposals that are going to really make a difference. And to do that, we're going to allocate, this will be a proposal, but we intend to allocate 2% to incentivize those people.
00:42:35.876 - 00:42:36.286, Speaker C: Right.
00:42:36.388 - 00:42:44.130, Speaker A: And they will be in the form of experts who are advocates and champions, but also just on the ground people.
00:42:44.200 - 00:42:44.578, Speaker C: Right.
00:42:44.664 - 00:43:02.354, Speaker A: I think there's a lot of on the ground Dow contributors in Solana who are awesome. They're like the most knowledgeable folks. They participate in all these other dows. And actually, they're the most underpaid people in crypto.
00:43:02.402 - 00:43:02.710, Speaker C: Right.
00:43:02.780 - 00:43:46.034, Speaker A: Some of these people are like community people, like community managers and whatnot, which are some of the most underpaid folks. And so we're carving out these percentages for those people as well, because they're the people that are going to day to day make sure that the Dow is moving in the right direction and really do the heavy lifting on a lot of this stuff. So it's both the day to day and then sort of like, I don't know, you can say kols or experts who have influence, who can help champion Meteora, that are going to form sort of the foundation of making this Dow really effective.
00:43:46.082 - 00:43:46.680, Speaker C: Right?
00:43:47.770 - 00:44:29.940, Speaker A: And the last part is just like incentives. We think the timing is good now. We're going to go super hard on incentives. We have a really great plan for how the token will roll out and how things will happen. As I mentioned, like 10% is going to be allocated and we will aggressively emit that. I don't know, it'll be a short duration. But following that, we have one thing that's going to be really cool.
00:44:29.940 - 00:44:33.634, Speaker A: We've talked about this. I'll just tease at it.
00:44:33.672 - 00:45:19.540, Speaker D: That's pretty cool. Certainly Solana needs stronger dows and this seems like, I think the important part is having a mission and actually alignment on the one mission instead of everybody just doing random things. So pretty excited for that. Kind of on a side note, but sort of related to the dysfunction that comes from Daos, which is kind of what led me to this point. I've been seeing a lot of Twitter fighting, let's say between defi people. It's not specific to Solana by any means, but certainly Solana's as maybe people come back to Solana and Solana defi specifically. There's a lot more eyes, and more eyes means more competition in a sense.
00:45:19.540 - 00:45:39.210, Speaker D: And there's been a lot of chatter on the interwebs, especially Twitter. What do you think about that? Do you think that's good, bad? You're like a defi og. Obviously. You're a vest. What would you recommend to these maybe people in the ecosystem?
00:45:40.990 - 00:46:06.386, Speaker A: Man, good question, man, really good question. I personally try to stay away from those things. Honestly, I'm not the biggest fan. I get it. And I think that social media has a tendency to be polarizing. And so if you want engagement, I think it's good. But we're really interested in growing the.
00:46:06.408 - 00:46:06.980, Speaker C: Pie.
00:46:08.950 - 00:46:56.434, Speaker A: In Meteora for Salana. Honestly, we're not winning until Salana is like at least a billion TvL and the volumes grow insanely and the number of users, I think the next step is like ten xing everything, right? Tvl volume users, right. And I don't think the kind of fighting amongst each other helps that, to be honest. I get it. And I don't even mind some people. In small ways, it's helpful just to keep people honest. Oh, hey, dude, that wasn't a cool move or something, right? But I think we shouldn't take our eyes off the prize, right? I think we need to grow this whole thing.
00:46:56.434 - 00:47:10.930, Speaker A: Who cares what some other protocol is doing, right? If you really want to ten x stuff, forget about whatever other protocols are doing, what are the ways to ten x? Where are the new growth avenues? What are the problems we need to solve?
00:47:11.010 - 00:47:11.638, Speaker C: Right?
00:47:11.804 - 00:47:55.200, Speaker A: And that's why for Meteora's part, we're like, okay, our problem, the problem that we can solve for Salana is to drive liquidity. Let's make deeper liquidity for all the pairs that need to be traded at deeper liquidity. Let's drive broader liquidity for new tokens that are coming up and help them deepen their liquidity because they need deep liquidity to build confidence and trust in their projects. And it doesn't matter if a competitor does it or we do it or they do it for one token, we do it for another token, the whole thing lifts. Right. I guess I'm just not interested in getting involved in these side things because I think there's more important things to work on.
00:47:55.770 - 00:48:24.720, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it's a beautiful answer. I think all these token drops that are happening on Solana right now are going to be great for TDL, but the competition is also going to pick up because you've had a leaderboard right now just based on volume that you can compare the different protocols, but soon you're going to have price. And price is like the ultimate thing that drives these discussions on Twitter. So it's going to be interesting. What advice would you give just from what you've seen with your experience in the past, releasing a token that these teams in Solana, who, I'd have to guess, in the next year, we're going to see a lot of teams drop tokens. What are some learnings you've taken away that you think these teams should apply.
00:48:26.770 - 00:48:28.122, Speaker A: For token airdrop?
00:48:28.186 - 00:48:28.800, Speaker C: Wow.
00:48:29.650 - 00:48:49.174, Speaker A: All right, I'll just share what I think has worked well for. I think the Jupiter Token airdrop has been a good example of what I think tokens should do. And that's a few things. One is that get the community involved, have a discussion, the team can have the final say.
00:48:49.292 - 00:48:49.960, Speaker C: Right.
00:48:50.410 - 00:48:59.946, Speaker A: But I think one of the things that has been problematic is the team doesn't talk about it because they're afraid of people gaming the system.
00:49:00.048 - 00:49:00.698, Speaker C: Right.
00:49:00.864 - 00:49:14.730, Speaker A: And then your community has mismatched expectations. Some people don't get it when they thought they would get it, or people that you forgot about. Like you just forgot this group of people didn't get it and then they get upset.
00:49:14.810 - 00:49:15.486, Speaker C: Right.
00:49:15.668 - 00:49:58.694, Speaker A: So if you get the community involved, you discover who are the people who care, who are the people who want it. You get new, fresh ideas on what could happen, but you decide you as a team figure it out because you're the only one to balance all the concerns. Right. Probably what I would say is, tactically, some things that are probably good is, well, actually at a higher level, maybe everyone should be decently happy, but not super happy, and make sure it's like the fairest approach, which you can only do openly.
00:49:58.742 - 00:49:58.954, Speaker C: Right.
00:49:58.992 - 00:50:46.060, Speaker A: You can't figure that out by yourself. Everyone's case is different, but large airdrops to the community, I think, are really powerful. Like Bonk proved that out. I think the Jupe airdrop has gotten people really excited because of mean. There's a lot of alignment in that because Jupiter is a very community focused project. So if that is sort of like your North Star is community and you want to build a strong community, I would recommend a large percentage of the token go out to them and allow them to do maybe price discovery. And I guess maybe the only thing would be like.
00:50:46.060 - 00:51:11.442, Speaker A: Maybe another small tactical thing would be. Would be like doing maybe a locked token sale and then a liquid airdrop later. But I'm not saying that anyone is doing that, but I feel like that's a good sort of order of things. Yeah. And then just go, I guess people.
00:51:11.496 - 00:51:12.100, Speaker C: Should.
00:51:14.230 - 00:51:58.306, Speaker A: Go, I guess. One other thing that I've been telling our community, too, because we're going to have a lot of tokens, is, man, we're definitely entering in this bull market. And I would say for holders and community members, really pay attention to the people who built in the bear and who are launching tokens, whether they're big or not. There's definitely strong teams with strong tokens, but I would say anyone who survived the bear, no matter what size, if they're launching a token, chances are they're going to be a stronger, better team, more focused on the long term than any new token. That just popped out of nowhere because of all the hype. It's not a bet on token, it's a bet on think, you know, go with a team you trust.
00:51:58.408 - 00:52:25.414, Speaker B: All right, Ben, I've got one more question before we close up here, and I just want to ask you about. You're going to have a token, and there's a big discussion going on right now with the protocol treasury and what happens with tokenomics and yield. And I'm curious. I know the protocol just voted, this is meteora to take protocol fees to zero. This is in October for the next three months. So that's lps still get a fee on every trade, but right now the protocol is going to get zero. I know that's just probably attract more demand.
00:52:25.414 - 00:52:52.350, Speaker B: I'm curious how you think about that long term and this is a little tangential, but related. You've seen the same discussion with Uniswap and they're discussing like what type of fee should we have? Should we have a protocol fee or not? But then you saw them come out, Uniswap Labs or the foundation, I forget which one. And they're going to charge 15 basis points from the front end, which actually doesn't go to the treasury at all and isn't really related to the token. So I'm just curious how you think about that. Like the monetization or the fee accrual, whether it's the token or the protocol.
00:52:52.510 - 00:52:54.130, Speaker D: Yeah, just how you think about it.
00:52:54.280 - 00:53:33.122, Speaker A: Yeah, no, great question. Definitely our 0% protocol fee is actually for a limited time. And the community voted for this too and had good discussions. We had really great discussions around it, right. Which is like, look, we're launching this new dlmm. We've got some really cool offerings for meme coins. Let's just help them make more money, right? And part of it too is also to be honest, in this early phase you don't make that much money anyway, right? Like the volumes are just starting to pick up and they're doing well.
00:53:33.122 - 00:53:45.474, Speaker A: But in a bear, even where we are now with the volumes, even if you charged a healthy fee, you're not sustainable. We're not paying salaries and operating costs.
00:53:45.522 - 00:53:46.120, Speaker C: Right.
00:53:48.490 - 00:54:20.522, Speaker A: So the goal is like look, let's just attract as much help lps, help token projects, drive deeper liquidity, help them become more profitable, build that traction up and then later on find ways to make money. Now that can be in fees. But then I also talked about this idea of making money on float, right? We actually do do this today. So the lending aggregator, those lending yields, the protocol takes a cut of that yield. So it's not all from the trading fees.
00:54:20.666 - 00:54:21.360, Speaker C: Right.
00:54:23.730 - 00:54:43.222, Speaker A: Now maybe this will be a great discussion for our dow, but we could say, hey look, the more we take in the trading fees, the less volume, the less revenue for lps. There's a lot of pressure to not have trading fees. Maybe we just take more from the lending yield. That could be all the side of capital that doesn't impact any of that.
00:54:43.276 - 00:54:43.880, Speaker C: Right?
00:54:44.330 - 00:55:18.702, Speaker A: So that's going to be a great lever for us I think. And what's great about that is that's super scalable and that's actually about TVL. So the more TVL we have, actually the more you get of this and it has nothing to do with trading. So basically what happened? Say I have some meme coin project. It's like meme Coin X and USDC, right? Okay. The trading volume on that meme coin usually lasts about a week, and then it just drops.
00:55:18.766 - 00:55:19.426, Speaker C: Right.
00:55:19.608 - 00:55:22.658, Speaker A: So your fees will spike for a week and then nothing.
00:55:22.744 - 00:55:23.378, Speaker C: Right.
00:55:23.544 - 00:55:28.966, Speaker A: But the lending yield on the USDC side is forever. That is just going to keep going.
00:55:29.148 - 00:55:29.830, Speaker C: Right.
00:55:29.980 - 00:56:20.022, Speaker A: And the more TVL you have that more that you have. And if as a protocol at dow, we say, look, why don't we just split it? Actually, we're taking a very small percentage of it. But if we just say, hey, look, we split this a larger percentage, then it doesn't impact any of the trading performance. And again, the more tv we have, the more that revenue works. And for a team of a fixed size, all of a sudden, let's say you have 200 million in TVL, maybe 50 million of that is in USDC. You're earning like, actually, the USDC lending yields can be as high as like 4%. But just say, okay, I'll earn 2%.
00:56:20.076 - 00:56:20.680, Speaker C: Right.
00:56:21.050 - 00:56:23.174, Speaker A: Just on the USDC, not the sole side or anything.
00:56:23.212 - 00:56:23.366, Speaker C: Right.
00:56:23.388 - 00:57:17.634, Speaker A: So as this stuff just grows, that should fix the sustainability. You can pay your team, you can pay your server operating costs, your infrastructure, which is really important. I think the other secret that people don't talk about is that the on chain part is a small part of what makes these protocols run. There are huge off chain infrastructure that every team is paying for that need to run for the protocol to work. And this is why a lot of in the bear, you saw protocols projects disable their protocol program. Their programs, they just shut them off because they can't run the program without paying for the servers for their own infra. So this is why sustainability can be so important, because it's not just the on chain component.
00:57:17.634 - 00:57:24.380, Speaker A: That's a small component for a lot of these things, and we need to be able to pay for those things.
00:57:24.750 - 00:57:44.020, Speaker B: That's really interesting. Yeah, I remember we had Ilya from tensor on. He was saying how I think it's like 90% of their code base is off chain. So that has to do with the data pipelines and the servers and all these things you're talking about. So, yeah, I think people do forget that last question. I know I lied here. Does protocol own liquidity come into this at all? Could you maybe explain what that concept is? And does Meteora think about that?
00:57:44.390 - 00:58:22.750, Speaker A: Yeah, we're thinking about that pretty. So right now, we don't have protocol on liquidity. Most Amms don't have protocol on liquidity. Lafinity is probably the best example of it. Lafinity is also a really good example of sustainable decks because it owns its own liquidity, right? So instead of renting that liquidity, so that model actually works. Now, they took advantage of this because they sold their tokens in a bull market. So they were able to get a decent amount of protocol on the liquidity and then put that to use to earn fees for their holders.
00:58:22.750 - 00:59:30.126, Speaker A: So we have been talking to various people about acquiring protocol on liquidity, and there's a big unlock there in a few different ways. One of them is that, and people may not know this, but especially for us based companies, or highly regulated companies, even euro based companies, you cannot be involved in any market making any of your own token, any selling of your own token. You can't do anything like that, right? So, you know, like there's, there's a good synergy between allowing people to buy our token with their liquidity, so that way we can provide the liquidity for their token and not them. And then not only does that give them the ability for us to provide deep liquidity for their own tokens, but it allows our projects to be more aligned.
00:59:30.158 - 00:59:30.354, Speaker C: Right?
00:59:30.392 - 00:59:48.120, Speaker A: So they get a big vote in our governance and also vice versa. So we could apply that token to voting in its governance. So for strong projects that are focused on the long term, like us, we have been talking about that as a mechanism because there's a lot of synergies and benefits.
00:59:48.490 - 01:00:17.446, Speaker B: Yeah, it's really interesting. I remember Durden tweeted, he's from linfinity, and he tweeted, one hard thing about protocol and liquidity is it has this curse that people often evaluate your, they tie your token price to the treasury amount of protocol and liquidity. And they're like, oh, if your protocol and liquidity is only 100 million, your token should be worth 100 million, just not actually how this would work. And like a DCF or however you want to value a token. But it is something people consider. But I think that's really exciting, and I'm pumped to see what comes out of meteora. We're really lucky to have you in Salana.
01:00:17.446 - 01:00:27.950, Speaker B: Seriously. It's been fun to see the DeFi projects not just launch tokens, but also the people that survived the crash of last year, and then their projects right now are just taking off. So it's fun to see.
01:00:28.120 - 01:00:43.862, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you, man. I'm so glad to be a part of this ecosystem. Everyone here is super cool. Really strong builders. I feel like we kind of, honestly, this is the way I see sort of the infighting. It's sort of like interfamily bickering.
01:00:43.862 - 01:01:14.562, Speaker A: But really, honestly, everyone we work with see the bigger picture. We're all kind of trying to help each other out, and I love that. It's such a good. I've never been a part of an ecosystem that has kind of come to, I mean, I mean, this is, I guess the bear market does that to you. Come together. Actually, the bear market and I guess the ethereum community is shitting on us, has made us have to come together and work together. That's really cool.
01:01:14.562 - 01:01:15.986, Speaker A: I hope to see more of that.
01:01:16.088 - 01:01:24.150, Speaker B: Agreed. Solana has the best vibes in crypto. But Ben, thank you so much for coming on. I'm glad this was round two. It was a really good conversation. So thanks for joining us.
01:01:24.300 - 01:01:26.214, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you for having me. It's fun.
