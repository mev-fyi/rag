00:00:00.280 - 00:00:18.545, Speaker A: But November 5, we will have an election, and after that, all of those markets goes away. The other problem is that, yes, election markets have seen growth, but most of that growth comes from this massive sort of bubble of interest around political markets.

00:00:44.045 - 00:01:18.897, Speaker C: Hello and welcome back to another episode of Lightspeed. I'm your host Jack Kubenek and today joining me, I have Kyle Dipepe from Hedgehog Markets and Nigel Echols, who is building Bet Hog. I'm very excited to have these guys on the podcast today because we're going to be talking about one of crypto's most interesting trends, most maybe polarizing kind of consumer apps at the moment, which is prediction markets. So. Well, Kyle and Nigel, first of all, thank you guys for joining the pod.
00:01:18.921 - 00:01:19.881, Speaker D: I'm glad to have you.
00:01:19.993 - 00:01:20.569, Speaker A: No, thank you.
00:01:20.617 - 00:01:22.965, Speaker D: Thanks for having us on. Yeah, thanks for having us.
00:01:23.605 - 00:02:02.127, Speaker C: So I'll start out just with a quick intro to both of you. So Kyle is the CEO of Hedgehog Markets, which is a prediction market that is built on Solana. Mert caught me slipping in our recent roundup and I didn't give you credit as being the first, I believe or had forgotten about Hedgehog Markets. But yeah, big in the Solana community is integrated with blinks and things like that. Kyle was previously at places like Goldman Sachs and T. Rowe Price. Nigel Echols is CEO and co founder of Bethog, which is a betting platform being built on Solana.
00:02:02.127 - 00:02:24.607, Speaker C: It's in kind of a testing phase right now and previously he was CEO, I believe, and co founder of FanDuel, which is, you know, the major sports betting platform in the US and I think also involved in some legal action with them. I think I saw that on Twitter, which will spare asking you questions about that for now.
00:02:24.631 - 00:02:29.955, Speaker A: Nigel, I've got a 216 page complaint if you want to read it in your spare time.
00:02:30.255 - 00:03:17.599, Speaker C: Great. Yeah, a good weekend read. We'll link it in the show notes. No, but so the reason I wanted to have you two specifically on the pod to talk about prediction markets is that Nigel, you publicly have been a bit of a prediction market skeptic. And Kyle, you obviously are The CEO of a prediction market platform. So I think it'll be interesting to just have a little bit of a dialogue between you two and be able to, yeah, kind of weigh the pros and cons. But before we do all of that, I think it's important to just define our terms here because something that Merton and I talked about on our roundup is like, our prediction markets, not just betting platforms.
00:03:17.599 - 00:03:31.315, Speaker C: So I guess I'll pose this to you, Kyle, and then Nigel, you can maybe come in as well. But what is a prediction market and how is it different from a betting platform of the kind that already exists?
00:03:31.775 - 00:04:31.045, Speaker D: To me, I guess prediction markets are finding the odds that the community thinks that something will happen. So it's, I guess, not always necessarily like correctly predicting the truth in a sense. Like, you know, the odds won't necessarily be 99%, just like when you have like, you know, money line odds with a game. You know, a team might be plus 500, which has, you know, lower chances of winning, but like, there's still a chance that they could win. So it's just finding the truth of like what the implied odds are of something happening and typically financializing that is just a better predictor of that outcome. So whatever event it is, and I guess how is it different than other betting platforms? I would say at a high level it's the same. If you look at sports and sports odds, the idea is that you're looking at the implied odds of that team winning a game, for example, or a certain amount of points being scored.
00:04:31.045 - 00:04:53.955, Speaker D: It's just that prediction markets are now applying that same stuff to more long tail markets, like basically like political elections right now, which is obviously the hot topic. But you can really apply it to whatever. It's just, you know, whatever bet you want to make with somebody else, you can basically look at what are the implied odds and will somebody take the other side of that bet at those implied odds?
00:04:55.415 - 00:05:02.911, Speaker C: Nigel, does that comport with you? Like, what is your understanding of what prediction markets are?
00:05:02.983 - 00:05:39.105, Speaker A: Yeah, so prediction markets are just betting markets. I don't think there really is a distinction. So one of the first we call it a prediction markets is Betfair, which launched in 2000. I used to work there. I was part of a competitor flutter and we merged with them in 2001. And in the UK, there's no regulatory requirement for the operator to have they can take bets on one thing or not in another. So Betfair can take bets on literally anything and has taken markets on a whole range of things.
00:05:39.105 - 00:06:09.297, Speaker A: And so there's no real distinction between Betfair and say Poly market or Hedgehog markets. I'd say the distinction, maybe more in the US is that a prediction market is usually referred to something outside of sports. So it's non sports betting market. And it usually has a veneer of, shall we say, sort of truth finding. You know, it's, you know, Betfair doesn't really give a shit about that. All they care about is volume. And then people are betting on it.
00:06:09.297 - 00:06:32.615, Speaker A: They don't even go to their site today. It's actually very hard to understand who is the favorite, you know, how the odds have been moving because they don't really care about that. Whereas prediction workers do care a lot more about that because there's a really big user base that, that's never going to play as a bat but wants to go and check the odds. So I think that's a kind of distinction that sort of developed over time as well.
00:06:33.835 - 00:06:40.415, Speaker C: So it's like sports betting for like smart people, I guess, or I wouldn't.
00:06:40.875 - 00:06:53.755, Speaker A: It's for people who are not into sports. Right. Like it's funny. Let's take Betfair as an example. So here we have a market. It's open not only in the uk, but lots of other countries. So they take bets in anything.
00:06:53.755 - 00:07:21.457, Speaker A: The non sports, non racing racing is a very big category. That's horse racing and dog racing. But non sports, non racing, I would say is best, maybe hits 1% of their volume max. It's, it's actually probably a lot less than that. You know, like you look at the US betting market that they're taking, you know, they'll take a lot more in cricket than that. They'll take a lot more. And you know, a lot of these things are tertiary sports you would consider.
00:07:21.457 - 00:07:40.485, Speaker A: So in these markets where, you know, you've got all of these things. So the vast market is where internationally, where it's not constrained, wants to bet on all these other things. Only a small minority of people really want to put serious money into what you would consider to be prediction markets, which are politics and everything else.
00:07:41.945 - 00:08:28.513, Speaker C: Yeah, that makes sense. And you know, before sports fans flood my, you know, mentions, I'm, I'm a big sports fan. I don't bet on them, but I'm very excited for the NFL season coming up. So just to, just to clear that up. But now that, now that we've defined our terms, I guess, Nigel, I'd like to go into kind of the tweet that I saw that spurred this episode which came together over the weekend while I was at the airport. So thank you guys for responding last minute. But you wrote a long tweet that was a little bit contrarian to I think what a lot of people in crypto are saying right now.
00:08:28.513 - 00:08:41.368, Speaker C: And it boiled down to, you know, prediction markets are going to have difficulty surviving past the election. But can you just, I guess for the sake of listeners, walk us through a little bit of what that argument was?
00:08:41.416 - 00:09:39.303, Speaker A: Yeah, so I wouldn't say quite that. What I'd say is prediction markets are in a predictable bubble at the moment because if we look at them and let's just use poly markets data, you know, I don't know 18 of their top 20 markets is politics and by volume politics or not just politics, but elections is like well over 95% of their volume. That ends November 5th. Well maybe with, I think I mentioned maybe with a little bit of a tale if one person doesn't lose and doesn't accept it, usually a little bit of a market that. But November 5th we will have an election and after that all of those markets goes away. The other problem is that yes, non election markets have seen growth, but most of that growth comes from this massive sort of bubble of interest around political markets. And so that's where people coming in now post November 5th.
00:09:39.303 - 00:10:14.715, Speaker A: I'm not saying that prediction markets are going to go away. They've survived before and they will survive after. But any and there's a few people on Twitter seem to be intent on drawing this straight line from this growth or even, you know, accelerated growth. That's ridiculous. Like that is not happening. We're going to see election markets go to zero after November 5th and we're going to see non election markets drop substantially because all of their news or all of their buzz is being driven by the election. Now I expect there will be prediction markets and I think some of them will be successful post election.
00:10:14.715 - 00:10:25.575, Speaker A: But we're not going to be talking about them right like at anywhere near the level we are today and we're not going to start talking about them again anywhere near the level we are today until 2020 yet. That's my prediction.
00:10:26.465 - 00:11:03.617, Speaker C: So yeah, I have Polymarket open here and just to sort, you know, sorted by most volume you have election winner, popular vote winner, electoral college, will Biden finish his term. The super bowl sports a rate cut, do like Congress, congressional elections, does RFK Jr drop out. So like a lot of them up near the top are political prediction markets. Why is that, Nigel? What about political Prediction markets makes them interesting for people to bet on.
00:11:03.681 - 00:11:38.091, Speaker A: So for something to be a good market you need a couple of things. First thing is you need something that's a binary clear outcome. It happened or it did not happen. And that immediately eliminates so many things like these running news stories where well A or B, but it actually turns out to be C. You know, like what's the future of Ethereum? Like huge discussion at the moment. How would I create a market around what the future of Ethereum is? Will this or this happen? Well and. Or we could say well what about a market? You know, we could boil it down and what happens to Ethereum price.
00:11:38.091 - 00:11:59.361, Speaker A: But there really is a market for that which is just buy Ethereum or short Ethereum. So the vast majority of the world is messy and isn't easy to put into markets. The exceptions number one, sports and horse racing. Right. Very clear cut. Who won the Super Bowl? It's never been in contention. Who won this game? Sometimes in contention.
00:11:59.393 - 00:11:59.537, Speaker D: Right.
00:11:59.561 - 00:12:24.149, Speaker A: But you know, pretty much, you know, we've got accepted rules for it. Finance is another one. Like you could have a market on whether the doll will open or close. And those are really big markets in our own right. And then we have elections again, pretty clear cut who won generally. And so those are good. After that it just gets really messy and it's really hard to create a market around that.
00:12:24.149 - 00:12:49.549, Speaker A: And then the other problem on top of that is most of those things don't have the other thing that you need to have a good market which a lot of people interested. So that's the first thing who were willing to risk large amount of money on it. So that's sort of like you might have a story that becomes like a headline story. And even if we could formulate like you know, the classic kids stuck down a well story. Right. This is a bit of morbid one like will they save the kid?
00:12:49.597 - 00:12:49.757, Speaker D: Right.
00:12:49.781 - 00:13:18.765, Speaker A: It's a running news story. I can battle it. But are there lots of people willing to put lots of money on this? Not really. Right. Only study because it's morbid. But there's also sort of, I think they call them hanging, you know, hanging cliff stories that does it fall right there just it doesn't have the amount of broad interest and willing money to make an interesting market. Let's say the super bowl does are really, you know, even the preseason NFL games have like they get real money.
00:13:18.765 - 00:13:52.251, Speaker A: These news stories just generally don't. And the other thing is, you know those bettors are kind of, you know, they are in that ecosystem that, you know, every weekend they'll be watching football, they'll watch NBA. And so it's kind of part of their whole zeitgeist. And the people who want to bet, that's kind of where they're at. So for there to be markets for these other things, we have to create this or a new class of people that are just like super in the news and want to bet on it, like every day with real money. And certainly currently that's a pretty small group of people.
00:13:52.403 - 00:14:07.055, Speaker C: Kyle, just broadly with that take, you know, elections and sports is where most of the interest is. Beyond that, it might be hard to draw a lot of liquidity. Just what's your take on that in general?
00:14:09.515 - 00:14:36.771, Speaker D: I would honestly say that for the most part I agree. And I think like, these are things that we constantly think about and I'm sure polymarket is as well. And if they're not, then they should be. But yeah, it's really what does happen after the election. Like, we saw this in 2020, we're seeing this now. Like you have that hype that gets amplified because the news picks it up. They report poly market charts, right? You get that nice sort of data visual of how the odds have changed over time.
00:14:36.771 - 00:15:20.243, Speaker D: They love to talk about whenever Trump and Kamala odds flip each other based on whatever. It's just good talking points. We see the same thing with crypto Twitter, right? It's like whatever is the hot thing of the day, that's what's on the timeline. Right. And I think to that point too, we definitely are in that sort of prediction market bubble as far as narrative people talking about it, maybe investment in deal flow. But even when the elections end, they will still be around. And I think like, what we're trying to think through and solve for is, you know, what, what will those markets look like? So I think like most people think of prediction markets in terms of like a club or amm, where you're trading these.
00:15:20.243 - 00:16:01.167, Speaker D: Yes, no shares. But you know, kind of like we mentioned at the beginning, prediction markets are just betting on different things. So we're trying to think through how can we make it where, you know, right now there isn't really a good way for anyone to spin up their own prediction markets. And so that's something that we're trying to solve, which there's a lot of nuance there, which is why it's difficult. And we can kind of go down that road if you want to, but that's one thing we're kind of looking into. And then maybe like a different market style. So like, you know, with sports betting the casino is sort of acting as the house and they're setting those lines and the idea is that they're effectively market neutral, they're acting as a market maker and they take the spread.
00:16:01.167 - 00:16:25.665, Speaker D: So is there a different, you know, fee model or a different way that you could sort of monetize prediction markets that people haven't thought of or aren't thinking about because you know, you kind of see something and that's how you always think of prediction markets. And so we're trying to expand and have different market types that we're offering in addition to letting the users be more engaged with sort of the product creation.
00:16:27.885 - 00:16:38.875, Speaker C: Like, do you think that the primary like volume markets on Hedgehog are still going to be politics and sports post election?
00:16:41.975 - 00:17:36.220, Speaker D: I mean definitely not politics. I think sports will be. So I think, you know, is there, you know, a different model that we can carve out that is slightly differentiated? Are there long tail markets that sports books don't want to allow people to bet on? I've often heard of people that will find an edge and then they either get capped on how much they can bet on sportsbooks or they get rid of those markets entirely because the sports book isn't profitable because of it. That's where crypto can come into play. If you can create a more peer to peer club trading model or just peer to peer betting, you know, if there are enough people that are interested, that market becomes self sustainable. If there aren't, then kind of the same thing will happen with what's happening with traditional sports betting. And so I think sports will always be high volume.
00:17:36.220 - 00:18:14.395, Speaker D: So if there's a way to carve out that niche on chain that people are interested in, great. But you know, it's tough to compete. You have, you know, FanDuel doing a majority of the volume in the U.S. draftKings I think is in number two. And then everybody else is pretty far behind them. And then like Nigel touched on early on, you can't really operate these on chain crypto markets per se in the US So you're doing geo blocking, you're having click to say I'm not in these locations. You're doing a lot of things to sort of prevent users from doing that, which makes it hard to compete in that market when you can't operate in that market.
00:18:14.395 - 00:19:13.551, Speaker D: So I think it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out. I guess like one answer which I don't even think this is a great answer, but I do think we're early. I mean if you just look at total TVL on chain, it's very small. So if people do think that we're going to be more cryptocentric and more crypto native overall in the future, then this is more of a, I guess long term bet that as more and more people come on chain, as more and more people use usdc, they might look for these options and these avenues. But you know, the user experience honestly is great for traditional sports betting. So trying to bring that volume on chain is going to be a hard I guess cookie to crack there. But I think going after long tail markets and more like user centered markets is something that we're thinking about and trying to engage with similar to like pumped out fun, right? Like it's people that are just sort of spinning up these little micro communities around tokens.
00:19:13.551 - 00:19:22.635, Speaker D: Over 90% of them are just getting rugged by the dev or going to zero. But clearly there's a business model there. So why can't we do something similar with prediction markets?
00:19:23.495 - 00:20:19.025, Speaker C: And the one piece there, Kyle, I would maybe push back on is I think politics can be a place for betting markets post election because if you like, you know, when you say prediction markets only work for sports and politics, I feel like that's a lot of news. Like that's open up the front page of the New York Times and it's, it's going to be politics day after day even after the election happens. And you know every like streaming service right now is competing to be able to have streaming rights for sports. Like these are really, really big markets that people care a lot about. So I guess Nigel, I'll pose to you then like is that a knock on prediction markets if they only work for politics and then maybe sports, although then it, it's a betting platform like others. Like you know, that's still a pretty big pie, right?
00:20:19.445 - 00:20:54.669, Speaker A: Well so sports and racing is enormous. Like Betfair handles, you know, billions of dollars in bets every year. It's just that politics isn't a huge part of it. So the other thing I would say, and this sort of goes back to the history of sort of betting exchanges. So we say what we used to call them, they weren't as successful as we expected. So betting exchanges were revolutionary. When Betfair launched in 2000 was really the first because now there wasn't a bookmaker.
00:20:54.669 - 00:21:27.275, Speaker A: So you weren't betting against the house. You weren't going to get limited, that is, you know, you could always bet you could, you could lay a bet, you could bet against events. So they were revolutionary. And in sort of 2000 to 2004, 2005, like a lot of people sort of thought this was going to be the future of betting online. We weren't going to have sportsbooks. That's turned out not to be the case. A bunch of reasons, some of which were the sportsbooks just got a lot better.
00:21:27.275 - 00:22:05.345, Speaker A: They made it fast. They allowed you to do things like cash out, they allowed you to do things like in play betting. Those were, those were two inventions that were invented on betting exchanges, specifically betfair. So the sports got better. But the other thing that we didn't fully appreciate was that most sports bettors are retail consumers who are not as price sensitive as you think. They actually care about convenience and bonuses more than they care about, hey, I can get slightly better odds on this betting exchange. And I can hear the betting exchange by definition is going to be more complex and confusing.
00:22:05.345 - 00:22:31.505, Speaker A: And so the consumers just gravitated towards sportsbooks where it was simple, it was a single price. They just got put the price on, the price wasn't as good, but they got a deposit bonus and they were happy. And so that's one of the things I would say it's the more of betting exchanges have largely failed their initial, I'd say initial hype period more so than say prediction markets.
00:22:32.285 - 00:22:36.705, Speaker C: And like prediction markets of the past have had bad ui. Right.
00:22:37.805 - 00:23:16.435, Speaker A: And I would say this, this cycle is definitely the best. Like it's like, you know, probably 10x what the UI was like, you know, four years ago, I think predicted was sort of one of the dominant ones and then bat fair would be in another one. As a, you, as someone who lives in the us you go to, you go to bad fair and you're going to get geo blocked. I'm not even sure if you can, I think you can see the site but you can't, you can't actually see the price history. Then the prices are in decimal odds, which to 90% of Americans is totally alien. You know, it'll say, you know, it'll say something like Trump is 1.98. You know, I know what that means.
00:23:16.435 - 00:23:43.935, Speaker A: That means he's slightly better than know he's slightly better than even. But you know, they don't really make any effort to turn that into like, I want to go there and check out what the price is. And the price history is locked. Only logged in users can see it. So that's what it was four years ago. And then Predicted was like a very complicated, horrible ui, very difficult money at a night. So this cycle, you know, you can go to polymarket, you can go to Hedgehog, and you can see, bang.
00:23:43.935 - 00:24:00.641, Speaker A: It's a percentage. I understand that. Well, some people understand it. Some people seem to think that if your candidate's favorite, that means they're going to win, which obviously we all know is not the case. But, you know, that's still a problem. But you can still, you know, the 51%, you've kind of an idea what that means. Right.
00:24:00.641 - 00:24:06.365, Speaker A: Whereas, you know, 1.98. You don't. So definitely a lot better, 10x better than it was four years ago.
00:24:07.145 - 00:24:07.545, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:24:07.585 - 00:24:28.475, Speaker C: And I think they're also like, even if prediction markets aren't these vehicles that we collectively use to find truth quicker than news media or whatever, I think they're still helpful for surveying public opinion. Like, Vitalik has written about this.
00:24:28.515 - 00:24:56.585, Speaker A: But I'm a fan. I'm a fan of prediction markets. I've worked with them for 24 years. Betting markets and prediction markets, just the danger is like, the importance is to understand their limitations. And, you know, a couple of them are like, one is that they're really good in a limited set of places, elections being one of them. The other one is they. They're not.
00:24:56.585 - 00:25:24.391, Speaker A: Prediction market may not be a good name for them because people think they predict, right? And they're like, when prediction markets said that I think Trump had a less than 30% chance of winning in 2016, suddenly the market was wrong whenever he won. And everyone was like, oh, my God. The market said. And so did the pollsters. The pollsters got it wrong as well. The market said they were wrong and they weren't. They basically said, he's 2 to 1.
00:25:24.391 - 00:25:47.987, Speaker A: And that happens every day. But they're not a prediction of the future probability where I think they're really useful. And what I like about them are things like news media 100 times a day comes up with a story that there's like significant. Right. They're like significant development in the Harris campaign. You go read about it, you go, yeah, that looks pretty bad, right? Like, that's what happened in the markets. Nothing happened in the market.
00:25:47.987 - 00:25:54.603, Speaker A: And so that significant development is bullshit. Right? And so I think the markets are great at saying, okay, what was significant?
00:25:54.739 - 00:25:55.395, Speaker D: First.
00:25:55.555 - 00:26:12.847, Speaker A: First debate, very significant. We saw it immediately in the market. And in fact, I felt that the market underweighted. How significant it was that buying clearly it was going to drop out. Now, what happened after, I didn't know. But so that was a very significant assassination attempt, was significant. And how Trump responded.
00:26:12.847 - 00:26:44.993, Speaker A: We saw that in the market. You know, the VP pick, like, you know, obviously the VP pick market was a market itself, but the impact on the odds hasn't really changed anything. So a lot of these things that people sort of pundits and journalists pretend are significant, they don't really, really move the mark. And I think that's really useful because it's telling you something that the news media don't want you tell you, which is, you know what, you don't really need to read the news. You can just go check it, you know, nothing changed. You don't read any news today because there was no news. Right.
00:26:44.993 - 00:26:52.455, Speaker A: Like, that's, that's something I think they're really cool for. It actually saves me time reading the news. I don't have to because I know nothing, you know, nothing important happened.
00:26:53.025 - 00:27:12.217, Speaker C: However, you know, there's, there's times where prediction markets don't quite work well for the news. There was one today where people on Poly market are upset because the. There was a prediction market on whether RFK Jr would drop out. But he suspended his campaign.
00:27:12.361 - 00:27:13.121, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:13.313 - 00:27:21.459, Speaker C: Which means he functionally dropped out, but he can still accept donations, basically. And, and so it's like a gray area.
00:27:21.507 - 00:27:42.187, Speaker A: There's a real world. Like when we got a prediction, America Spitzer resigned. We had a market on whether he would resign. He was governor of New York at the time. We had a market whether he would resign by dead X. He resigned effective after the date that we had said. So, like, did he resign before the date or after? And like, there was no right answer.
00:27:42.187 - 00:28:10.129, Speaker A: And so I think one thing I will say for prediction markets is they will get better at this. We'll have the case law, as it were. We're like, well, the RFK ruling means that if someone suspends, we start to build a case law. And so I think we get better at those things. But those are still within the narrow category of yes or no. Did he drop out or not? And we'll build up case law and we'll get more accepted, but it's kind of an example of the messiness of the real world.
00:28:10.227 - 00:29:08.325, Speaker D: Yeah. And like, this is something that I think the biggest reason as to why it's not just let users make any market they want. Because when you have markets that trade as an AMM or club and these yes, no shares are constantly trading and repricing, when you end up with an outcome like this, how do you resolve it? Because you can't easily set that to invalid because then somebody's losing money or winning money just for no reason, basically. And then also resolving it one way or the other, people can argue both sides. So, you know, there's a lot of nuance when it comes to, I guess it's more so on the creation side because when you create the market and you basically set the outline of like this is how it should be resolved, it's hard to take into account some of those Black Swan events. And that's where you get into these ambiguous, like resolution disputes that happen with some of these markets. And that's why it is very hard to let users generate markets.
00:29:08.325 - 00:29:50.531, Speaker D: Which again is something that we've been thinking about and we've sort of found a quote unquote simple solution with a different market style so that we can allow users to create their own markets. And basically worst case scenario is if they are poorly worded or ambiguous in any way, you can mark them invalid and people get their money back. But these are more akin to like shorter term sports bets where you're putting on a bet with somebody else, you're not constantly trading and repricing these specific bets and it allows you to unwind them. So now you can kind of open it up and allow other people to be part of the entire process and feel like they're making a more customer niche bet, depending on what they want to bet on that day.
00:29:50.723 - 00:30:18.555, Speaker C: Yeah, Kyle, let's dive into that more because I was looking around in hedgehog markets and I saw the create your own bet coming soon and I was like, this sounds like a nightmare for hedgehog markets. Like how do you keep. Like, I just don't get how you pull that off without really angry users. So I'm just curious to hear a little more about how you're planning to release that feature.
00:30:19.535 - 00:30:51.625, Speaker D: Yeah, so, yeah, so to start off simply going to be sports, right? You can pull in sports, you can allow users to create that sport market. And kind of the path we're going down is like creating this permissionless protocol on Solana so users can create the markets themselves. Anybody can then participate in it. And then we will have an optimistic oracle that can be used to resolve these markets. We don't have to touch anything. It's all kind of up to the users to partake in that. So with sports, the nice thing is you just pull in that data.
00:30:51.625 - 00:31:33.925, Speaker D: The market terms are kind of known for those, so the user doesn't have to input anything. They just sort of click the creation and pay the small amount of fees to get that deployed on chain. So that's where we'll start. Then from there you can kind of start to formulate certain more popular markets. So that's where you could bring in politics, fed interest rates, up down markets for crypto. And these are more of just like templates. So users can kind of come in, whether it's a completely fixed template or you allow users to have maybe one or two inputs, but basically being able to control what users can do and help them not have to make as many choices.
00:31:33.925 - 00:32:42.455, Speaker D: So the choices are kind of determined for them and they can just tweak one or two of the inputs and then that way, this way they can sort of see the wording, see how they get resolved and they can still participate and they can spin up markets that they think will be the most interesting, that they want to bet on or other people want to bet on. So that's kind of the plan for how we'll initially launch that and then kind of go from there. See what users are most interested in, what they ask for and we can start to open it up more. I think if we go down the route of custom markets, that would probably be like invite only type situation where if there are communities that want to make markets or a pooled parlay style bet, which is one that we're releasing with their community, we can sort of white list a specific wallet that will be able to create those markets themselves and be able to create truly custom markets in a sense and just sort of help them through that process so that the markets don't end up being ambiguous or hard to resolve. So that's kind of how we're looking at it and hoping that that is more engaging with users and communities.
00:32:43.715 - 00:32:55.545, Speaker C: So is the idea here, I guess I'm curious why this is better for users than just spinning up the sports bets yourself.
00:32:58.525 - 00:33:45.925, Speaker D: Again, I guess that kind of goes in line with that cryptocentric idea of permissionless fully on chain markets where anybody can deploy these. So it's not just us making markets for other people constantly. So by allowing anybody to do it, it kind of works towards that goal of anybody making any type of markets maybe at some point. And so with that, you know, there's different sort of incentives or reasons and like levers that you can pull, you know, one of those is we have a baked in creator fee. So if you spin up markets, you would get a fee from that market, you know yourself just by creating it. So if you think it's going to be popular, it might be worth, you know, paying the small fee to spin up on chain. And this kind of goes the same way with like meme coins.
00:33:45.925 - 00:34:10.725, Speaker D: You know, let the users spin them up like as a team Pump Fun isn't going to go pick out memes and deploy them thinking, oh, this might be popular to trade. They're going to let the users, you know, figure out, okay, this is a funny meme or would be a funny community, so we'll let them spin it up. So that's kind of like the mindset and the idea and I guess thesis of a new market type that we haven't really seen yet.
00:34:10.805 - 00:34:57.656, Speaker B: Fragmentation is a big problem for Ethereum, but also for the subscription industry.

00:35:22.549 - 00:35:32.185, Speaker C: What's been your experience? I saw Hedgehog markets put out like prediction market blinks. What's been the results with that?
00:35:33.085 - 00:36:20.575, Speaker D: Yeah, so I think those have been great for just low price, low barrier to entry. You know, you can kind of get the product right in front of users. And so with, you know, crypto, Twitter and all of that, a lot of times the narrative is happening on Twitter itself and so it's hard to say if that's happening there. How do you then bring users away from that platform if they Want to bet on that on our site. And so blinks are a great way to do that. You can reply to somebody, you can send it in a DM and they'll unfurl. So if Solana and Crypto natives are sort of the first users that will be onboarding to our platform, this is just like a nice sort of low hanging fruit, easy avenue to enable that on ramping to the platform and just get used to these small bets.
00:36:20.575 - 00:37:10.655, Speaker D: So you know, a lot of the fields that we have are just simple like one click buttons for like a $5 bet or a $10 bet that the user can place and it just creates that transaction right there. They can also claim from that exact same tweet. So if you use bookmarket you can come back to it later. And so there's actually a market about Mert moving out of Canada. You know that got shared on Twitter and that did a lot of volume. And when you look at the transactions you can see, see that those are all being generated from those small, very easy to participate blinks. And that's also what we're going after with our pooled parlay style markets, which is sort of like a fixed small nominal entry, but then there's a big pool of funds and you basically select the outcome for multiple questions and then whoever gets the most correct wins the entire pool or might split it with a few other people.
00:37:10.655 - 00:37:33.135, Speaker D: So I think with crypto there's a lot of it's very fast paced, like meme coins are launched and die every single day. People want to, you know, bet one soul to make 100 SOL. So we were, you know, sort of playing off of that same kind of mindset of okay, who's, who's the current active customer on Solana and what might they enjoy or like to see?
00:37:34.555 - 00:38:10.551, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm looking, I'm trying to look up the odds. Okay, 89% chance Merck moves out of Canada by the end of 2024. I'm not going to release any insider info on the pod, but that's funny to watch. I did see the blank on the letter. Yeah, I'm putting in my wallet info right now. Nigel, maybe to broaden this, you're working on a betting platform on Solana. I guess what I was curious about, just with your background, I mentioned you were a co founder of FanDuel.
00:38:10.551 - 00:38:13.119, Speaker C: You also were CEO of a prediction market.
00:38:13.207 - 00:38:24.875, Speaker A: That's right, yeah. FanDuel before became FanDuel was a prediction market. We started it in 2007. It became FanDuel in 2009.
00:38:26.055 - 00:38:50.457, Speaker C: So I wanted to ask because obviously those are like Fiat platforms, particularly FanDuel. So why have you made the pivot to crypto today? What's the benefit? I guess especially listeners to this podcast would be interested in Solana. What's the benefit of running prediction markets, betting markets, on chain and on Solana?
00:38:50.641 - 00:39:27.245, Speaker A: Well, let me give you crypto in general and Solana specifically. I'm a huge crypto fan and I have been for many years. However, like, crypto is actually not good at a lot of stuff. It's actually a very big, slow and expensive database, and that's even the best of them compared against centralized options. And so if you're going to use crypto, you really have to have a good reason to do it. And so when a lot of these, you know, startup ideas are like this, but with crypto it's like, okay, good thing. But I've made it slower and more expensive and more difficult to develop.
00:39:27.245 - 00:40:13.479, Speaker A: So usually not a good result. Two things that crypto are really good at and only crypto, I'd say, you know, arguably only crypto can do. One is payments and the other is community. So if we go into those payments, if you're running a sports book, even an onshore one, like, say, FanDuel Payments is one of your biggest problem. How do you get money from people onto the site? You know, if you're dealing with a credit card, you're taking, you know, at least 3%, but you're a high risk category, so it might be 5% per $100 deposited. You don't get all of that because otherwise also people are going to withdraw it. And so suddenly, you know, if you think you've got a decent margin, your margin is getting hit by payments.
00:40:13.479 - 00:40:50.855, Speaker A: If you're running a sports book like Bedhog is, which is international, those costs are only bigger, like trying to get credit card payments out of, you know, Indonesia. Right. And really, really difficult, or even having somebody with a credit card in Indonesia who wants to use your site really hard and really expensive. Crypto is incredible of that. It also, it's also sort of fulfills crypto's kind of mission of like giving people control of their money where they can decide where to go. Like, you know, I've had this experience plenty of times where the bank has stopped it because reasons, right. We don't want to send money there.
00:40:50.855 - 00:41:20.277, Speaker A: And sportsbooks and crypto casinos have this huge problem of money getting stopped and refused even if they can get to the user. So that's the first One crypto is incredible at that. That's why Bad Hog is built on crypto. The second one that crypto is incredible is community formation. Biggest issue with most consumer apps is not can you build a product and you build a really good product, is can you get a community around it. You're not just users, but really engaged and behind it. That's where crypto is really exceptional.
00:41:20.277 - 00:41:56.661, Speaker A: It's kind of why I stayed in crypto sort of all these years is just like when I look at meme coins and they're so simple, but when you see something this simple that has such strong community, that are really engaged and, you know, every day, that's kind of part of their identity, that's really cool. And to me, that's something that I would love to see harnessed. So those are the sort of two things that only crypto can do or something I think only crypto can do. And. And then why Solana? Well, Solana. Well, Solana three years ago could only do the first one well, right? Which is I need payments, I need it fast, I need really cheap. Right.
00:41:56.661 - 00:42:31.213, Speaker A: You know, three years ago when we started, when I started in Solana, you know, today I think there are other options, but Solana is just the one with the best ecosystem for being fast and cheap. I'd say the rival might be like Base or Blast, but. But I don't think they're as complete in terms of like a defi ecosystem that Solana has today. So that's why Solana is really good for that. And then in terms of community, like, you know, Solana has got the number, you know, is the biggest meme coin community. It's got the biggest kind of consumer community. And then a third one, I'd said Raiz is like, Solana is just focused on consumer.
00:42:31.213 - 00:43:12.535, Speaker A: It's RA focused from day one. When I started using Solana in early 2021, like, that's where all the focus was on. It wasn't about building L2s or really, you know, it wasn't infrastructure for infrastructure was we need this infrastructure for these consumer applications. And that to me has been almost unique for Solana compared to any other chains that I've interacted with, which is that sort of focus on real consumer applications and building continue to improve the chain for that and continue to build for that. So that. That's why, like, I've explored other chains, like Blast, I think is interesting, base is interesting. But Solana is still, like, today is like, if you're building consumer, that's where I Think everyone should be building.
00:43:14.955 - 00:43:30.975, Speaker C: Kyle, I'm curious to ask you, like is you spoke a bit about permissionlessness as one of the benefits of building these things in crypto. Does hedgehog markets limit the size that you can bet bet like for an account?
00:43:32.475 - 00:43:59.417, Speaker D: No. So like the way the way all of our markets work and will work is basically you connect your wallet and you interact with the protocol itself. So like we're never escrowing your funds. You're not depositing and withdrawing onto a platform before placing a bet. Like you're just interacting with the market which is a, you know, it's an on chain program. You're just interacting directly with that market itself that's on chain. So no, we don't restrict anything.
00:43:59.417 - 00:44:55.855, Speaker D: There's no way for us to hold back your funds. You're not withdrawing back to a bank. So that's also part of the permissionless nature where you're not going to get restricted by some casino or with bank deposits, anything like that. And just to add on with why Solana obviously, fast, cheap, consumer focused, that was all amazing. But also, you know, having that all at the L1 layer, you know, recently I think it's probably like two months ago now, but we integrated with Lulo and so the USDC in our pooled markets and we've also integrated what will be really soon, which is the parlay markets and the peer to peer markets. But the USDC on the pooled markets right now, it gets deposited into whatever the highest yielding USDC borrowed lending protocol is. So that's all also done on chain, permissionlessly and then it goes back to the market when you pull it out and that's able to earn yield.
00:44:55.855 - 00:46:00.565, Speaker D: So it's kind of like another interesting avenue that isn't really possible anywhere else. Maybe there are some L2s that can do that now, but I still don't know that they have as robust of a DEFI ecosystem or lending and borrowing protocols built out. I don't know how easy that composability is. But that's another nice added benefit of building, building on top of Solana and another way to leverage different potential market types as well in the future as well as just different either revenue streams or ways to, you know, interest users where it's like, okay, I'm earning yield if I am placing a longer term bet. So there's different, you know, levers we can pull there and play around with. But I definitely think it's interesting and we've seen also like LSTs get very popular recently with like Validator specific liquid staking tokens. So whether it's that or just putting USDC or PayPal's new stablecoin or whatever it is and earning yield on it, I think there's also interesting ways that you can sort of leverage no loss prediction markets.
00:46:00.565 - 00:47:08.525, Speaker D: So it's a way where you're not actually even risking money, but now you can basically earn yield on that and use that to pay out prize pools. So that was something we had played around with. However, Defi wasn't as big back in 2020, 2021, the yields weren't quite the same, the TVL wasn't quite the same. And so I think that could also be something interesting that could be built or explored in the future as the ecosystem gets more and more robust and we sort of see, I guess over a longer period of time, are these yields more sustainable? What is the average that's actually maintaining? A lot of times we're seeing these juiced incentives or points programs or with PayPal even, you know, adding additional rewards to get adoption faster. So it's like, well, what does that actual yield sort of in the long run average out to be? So we are interested in watching those things as well. But yeah, the composability, the community being able to build on the L1 itself, not have to worry about bridging for the user experience. Like those are all some of like the niceties of building on Solana.
00:47:09.305 - 00:47:22.445, Speaker C: So you say no loss prediction markets is the idea that the losing side is paid back and the winning side earns based on the yield that the locked funds generated.
00:47:22.785 - 00:48:41.385, Speaker D: Yeah, so there's actually some banks that have done this in the past where it's like instead of getting like a 2% APY on your savings account at the bank, basically whatever money you have in the bank is like a ticket for like a monthly raffle. And the monthly raffle is basically they take all of the yield for all of the savings deposits and then they pay it out to like one raffle winner. So if like 2% is a nominal amount to you because you only have a couple hundred bucks in there, you know, why do you care about a couple dollars where it's like, okay, I'd rather just be entered into some lottery, even though my odds are very low, if I do hit it, it's much more life changing in a sense. So that's kind of the idea around no loss prediction markets. The biggest thing is that you need to have a big enough pool where the yield is interesting or you could also use it as an onboarding, like a customer acquisition cost where you could juice the pools in addition to having yield, get users to play these free betting markets because you're not actually risking any capital and then hoping that you convert over to something else. Similar to what you see with sportsbooks where they say your first bet is on us or they'll match it or whatever it is. I think there's interesting things that you can also explore with that.
00:48:41.845 - 00:48:59.755, Speaker C: Those sports books have to be losing so much money. I remember when New York legalized sports betting and it was $1,000 in free bets, which Caesars? I think so. Yeah, yeah, you just do basic odds. It's like a free, I don't know, you double your money essentially. Right?
00:49:01.335 - 00:49:38.905, Speaker A: Yeah. So the New York market opening saw probably some of the stupidest customer acquisition offers I've seen in 25 years in the sports betting industry. And Caesars was the main culprit. I think they went up to one and a half grand deposit bonus with one time rollover. And so, yeah, I had people that I knew that never bet and I was like, okay, here's what you do. You open an account, your friend opens an account, you bet opposite sides and one of you is going to double, you're going to double your money, you're going to withdraw. And they did it and they went.
00:49:38.905 - 00:50:07.635, Speaker A: Their market share in month one was something like 70% and now I'm pretty sure it's below 10%. They just dropped so much money on users that they will never recover from. It was, it was really, it was kind of like a once in a lifetime. Like, oh my God, this is like the dumbest thing I've ever seen Today. Those offers have all gone away. In fact, they disappeared pretty quickly when Caesar figured out just how much money they were losing from users that they were never going to see again.
00:50:08.135 - 00:50:17.901, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, I remember that. I never did it, but I was like, dang, I missed out on like a really, really insane, subsidized kind of.
00:50:17.933 - 00:50:51.175, Speaker A: Yeah, they, there was like, there was a few other states, you know, they're never. Not as high as that one, but like, you definitely could have made a few hundred dollars here and there pretty much risk free. Although, that being said, you know, the reason the books do it is even the people that chase these bonuses, you know, sometimes they come in, they chase the bonus and then they're like, they get the money and then like, oh, but those odds look pretty good as well. And before they know it, you know, they have that user for life. So, you know, Those numbers didn't make sense, but like smaller deposit offers, deposit matches, absolutely do make sense for them.
00:50:51.255 - 00:50:52.395, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah.
00:50:52.775 - 00:51:36.891, Speaker C: So yeah, like a minute ago I brought up permissionlessness because, and this is sort of just my personal vendetta, I guess you could say, with sports betting platforms. So, Nigel, I wanted to talk about this with you because some, like after sports betting was legalized and became very mainstream over the past couple of years, I always wondered, you know, why don't sophisticate, like these are very liquid markets that have a lot of like dumb money in them. So why don't sophisticated investors just like whip up models to figure out where people's emotions are, making them bet on the Dallas Cowboys, but like X small market team is going to win.
00:51:37.003 - 00:51:37.299, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:51:37.347 - 00:52:11.903, Speaker C: And what I found out, the reason is, is that sportsbooks will ban you if you're like too good at betting, essentially. Or they'll limit your daily bets to $1 or something like that. So there's like an art and that, that like makes my blood boil a little bit because, you know, crypto somewhat fairly is labeled as a casino. And it's a casino where you could be hacked or whatever, but at the very least, no one is going to say, hey, you're not allowed to trade anymore. You've been too profitable in this casino. So I'm just curious what your take is on that. And if crypto is sort of, I.
00:52:11.919 - 00:52:47.013, Speaker A: Would say, you know, in the uk, I've often thought, you know, where we've had like gambling advertising a lot longer, that the book should be taken to sort of court under the Advertising Standards act or something like that. Because it's not that what they're doing is wrong. It's a business. Right. A casino is a business. You know, if a user can go to the casino and be profitable, like card kinders, you know, certainly up to the casino to say we don't want your business. Where I have a problem with it is if you advertise, they say like, hey, come and win loads of money.
00:52:47.013 - 00:53:28.491, Speaker A: You could, you could be, you know, having this experience, but you can't, you can't win because we ensure that if you are a winner or we even suspect you're a winner, like I've had accounts limited and I'm not great at sports bettor. Then you're not really delivering on what you're marketing. Right. Your marketing is saying you can win, you can have this, you can win millions of dollars. And they're kind of really, the small print is, well, maybe in the short term you can, but if you do it too often, then we're gonna ban you. And that's sort of where I have an issue with it. I think that betting exchanges for prediction markets are a huge opportunity.
00:53:28.491 - 00:54:15.359, Speaker A: So three years ago, I started working on something I'm still on the board of called betex, which is a betting exchange. It's focused on the international market, it's focused on sports, and it's very similar to betfair in that way, which is there is no house. We don't limit customers. In fact, at the moment, we don't even charge a commission. The whole idea is that there should be a marketplace where people, if they are really sharp, can make money and trade of other people on it. And so that's the idea behind Bet Decks and it's built on Solana, and that's the opportunity that that market should exist. Now, there's still place for retail that if FanDuel DraftKings, you're a punter, you're not going to bet, you don't have to deal with an exchange.
00:54:15.359 - 00:54:41.855, Speaker A: But I think there should be a space for like a public market that can trade. And it would trade, you know, bet still in development, but it could trade billions, trillions of dollars in sports bets and incredibly thin margins. And everyone could bet. No one's getting limited. Like, no one gets limited in the stock exchange. Like, no one gets limited on, you know, on a crypto exchange because they're too profitable. That's kind of the ideal for.
00:54:41.855 - 00:54:43.915, Speaker A: That's what Bet Decks is trying to achieve.
00:54:44.655 - 00:55:08.835, Speaker C: And is there, like, I'm curious, you know, DraftKings will limit you because it's. It's bad for them if you're really good at betting and they have to consistently give you payouts. Do like the way crypto markets and rails work allow you uniquely to not have to do those sorts of things. And you can just charge like a.
00:55:10.775 - 00:55:42.855, Speaker A: Well, so what Crypto the way just to explain how Betax works. So Betax is a broker built on a protocol called Monaco. Anyone can also build on Monaco, and we do have other people who are building on it and better is plugging directly into Monaco. Monaco is a betting protocol. It basically creates a smart contract around an event. You know, money goes in and whenever the event happens, it settles and the money goes to the winner. What the broker does is it basically acts as just a front end to consumers into that protocol.
00:55:42.855 - 00:56:11.691, Speaker A: And so it's totally permissionless. Anyone can spin up a contract around anything within it and it's, you know, it doesn't have a central agency. Betex can't say, actually, we're not going to start charging, you know, are we going to limit users? Because Betex doesn't even know who the users are and it isn't, it can't. Doesn't the ability to limit them, doesn't the ability to tax them. So because the Monaco is controlled by the Monaco Protocol. So that's kind of the idea.
00:56:11.803 - 00:56:13.627, Speaker C: How does Vettex make money, though?
00:56:13.771 - 00:56:28.335, Speaker A: Oh, so it's a broker. So Betex is a broker on top. And what Betex can do is charge a fee on top of it and say, okay, but what we're going to do is we'll charge a bet tax fee. If you want to use the Monaco Protocol via our interface, that's how we charge a fee.
00:56:28.675 - 00:57:21.323, Speaker C: Okay, that makes sense. So for our last few minutes here, I guess, you know, we've talked about the business of prediction markets. There is a segment of people in crypto, though, that think prediction markets can be a lot more than just places that you go to, you know, bet on sports, games or election outcomes. And this manifests in a lot of ways. But I guess I want to get into just a specific one, which is futarchy. So this kind of new method of governance that was popularized on Solana by metadao, where you have pass markets and fail markets for governance proposals. And according to metadao, this is better than kind of one token, one vote, the broken state of DAO governance.
00:57:21.323 - 00:57:35.005, Speaker C: So I'm just curious if either of you has a take on futarchy or like, is it a thing that can work or is it just kind of this, you know, fun thing to speculate about?
00:57:36.545 - 00:58:26.167, Speaker D: Yeah, actually very familiar with futurkey. I'm actually at Mount right now, so, you know, talking to the metadata team and I, by the way, it's, it's really good. A lot of touching grass on the weekend and then, you know, pretty much just, just like working 247 during the week. So it's definitely a good time. If anybody's building on Solana, definitely highly recommend Mountain Dao, checking it out. But yeah, I think Futarchy complements prediction markets in the sense that you're trying to figure out which is the more positive EV outcome for something. So metadow, more specifically, it's like someone will put up a proposal and the idea is that you're trying to figure out, okay, should we pass this proposal or fail this proposal based on if it's going to be positive EV for metadao.
00:58:26.167 - 00:59:19.659, Speaker D: Itself and therefore the metadata token. And so I think like this, this somewhat gets reflected in the stock market, but it's more of after effect rather than a prior effect. So it's like when a CEO changes, you'll see the stock price either skyrocket or drop 15% the next day. In theory, what Futurkey solves for is like, well, instead of just making that change and then making it harder to undo it, you would set up and say, should this person be the CEO? So instead of trying to predict the outcome, you're trying to predict if this would be a good outcome. And so I think there's definitely some interesting things there that honestly probably make a lot of sense for publicly traded stocks. I think that futarchy, if it could be applied, would be pretty interesting for some things there. Similar to having a board vote.
00:59:19.659 - 00:59:51.151, Speaker D: The board is trying to decide what is the best outcome for something, but then you see that reflected later in the financial market. So this is kind of flipping that and saying, does the financial market think that this will be a good outcome and then we'll implement it. I think the problem is the regulatory hang up. As it is with a lot, it's just like, it's a lot of red tape, it's hard to get through. And so it's like, well, it's not really worth it. And so nobody really pushes that forward. So I definitely am a fan of what they're doing.
00:59:51.151 - 01:00:21.045, Speaker D: I am very interested to see how it plays out. You know, I know they're building some tools to help daos be able to implement this. So, you know, they have this tradable token. You know, you could even apply this to meme coins going forward where you could take those Meme coins and trade them around. You know, do we want to give grants or do we want to advertise somewhere for the meme coin or the dao or the project? So I think like cute Tarkey and prediction markets complement each other very well and one just kind of a precursor for the other.
01:00:21.865 - 01:01:06.403, Speaker C: I mean, I do think one thing is like prediction markets. I don't know if we've like said this explicitly, but at least I think they're more suited for retail than for like sophisticated actors, I guess. And sometimes there is a, like it's made out to seem like polymarket for instance. And their terms and conditions will say, you were encouraged to insider trade if you have insider information. Poly Market is helping us get closer to the truth. And so you should trade based on the inside information you have. I do like if something like futurkey is applied to corporate governance, I just do wonder if you have really big community concerns with insider trading, the ways that people could manipulate these sorts of markets.
01:01:06.403 - 01:01:23.955, Speaker C: I do. I mean, you know, I covered DAOs at Blockworks. Like, when I was an intern here. It was like my beat. And, man, like, those things don't work. And so Futarchy, I think, is very, like, I'm happy to see it applied to daos because there's. It's something new.
01:01:23.955 - 01:01:36.783, Speaker C: It aligns incentives, maybe. And the way DAO governance happens now is just ineffective. And really, anything new, I would welcome. Nigel, do you have thoughts on Tootharky?
01:01:36.839 - 01:01:51.715, Speaker A: Yeah, I do. I think it's a terrible idea, I think. And I've been firsthand seeing daos. I totally agree. They just don't work. They're kind of like communism. They look good in paper, and then once you get into one, you're like, oh, my God, this is terrible.
01:01:51.715 - 01:02:42.915, Speaker A: And, you know, when you think about it, the, you know, I live in a village here in New York, and, you know, I elect a representative. Actually, I don't, because I'm a green card holder, but if I did, I'd vote, and I would, you know, every couple of years get annoyed about certain things, and I'd vote for a candidate and I'd lobby if they were doing things they didn't like. The idea that instead. And I know very little that goes on the village, like, a tiny bit. I'm annoyed about a couple of things, but mostly it was okay. The idea that I would have a vote on everything just makes no sense to me at all. And if I were to apply it within my startup, like, you know, trying to have everyone have an opinion on, like, what does the marketing team do? What does the product team do? Like, yeah, there's a forum to get together.
01:02:42.915 - 01:03:28.915, Speaker A: But as a startup, what makes sense to me is that we hire people that we trust in certain roles, and one of those roles is CEO, right? It kind of like, okay, we're gonna trust you to, like, make these decisions, right? Everyone has agency, so everyone can leave, right? Like, this kind of, you know, this, you know, they're like, I don't like where this is going. I'm out of here. That's very important part of it. And I think some people who've never been a CEO don't realize that the CEO is actually very mindful of that. They're like, good CEOs are, like, they don't want to lose good talent, right? Like, they're One of their top jobs to get really good talent and keep them and keep them excited. And they're even more worried about not just people leaving, but somebody quiet quitting. They're like, yeah, whatever's fine then like just quiet quitting.
01:03:28.915 - 01:04:40.095, Speaker A: So, you know, so you do. It might look from the outside that the CEO is like all powerful, but actually that's not the case. Doing that either, whether in a dao or futur, I just don't think makes it any better. And in fact the optimal DAO structure I've often joked is that the token holder should vote for a leader who should be there for at least a couple of years and then that leader should pick deputy leaders who should be in charge of different departments and if they don't do their job, the leader should fire them. And you know, like, basically the joke is I've just created like a, you know, typical corporation, right? But that's the joke, right? Like, but it's, you know that, you know, startups are really, really, really hard. I actually think that structure is the right structure. The only scenario where I see dao's work is where it is already quite a mature protocol and you really only need certain consensus around upgrades and those people that are running validators are really engaged and it's not that sort of complicated anymore.
01:04:40.095 - 01:05:11.515, Speaker A: It's like, okay, this is what we run and maybe we vote on certain things. That's where I see it working. Whenever it's pre product market fit or even in a scaling stage, I think it's a disaster. And I think the reason we've seen like you know, over how many thousand we started is because it just doesn't really work. And I personally don't think it's through lack of tools or technologies or futurchy, whatever it is. I just think that structure just doesn't work for doing stuff in my view.
01:05:12.255 - 01:05:19.643, Speaker C: Do you think there's any broader application of like markets to decision making or truth?
01:05:19.759 - 01:05:59.889, Speaker A: Yeah, I do think, I think the technology itself really interesting. It's not a great track record, right? Like, you know, we are, you know, it's not. This prediction market has been around a long time. I do think some things people who don't think of as markets, but like, you know, if we look at community notes on Twitter, they're really good at truth seeking, right? They're not perfect. There's, there's flaws in it. It could be that you could introduce some sort of staking to it that, you know, you stake it and if it's true then you Know you do, you know, and if you, if it's not true, you get slashed. There are mechanisms like there that I think potentially you could explore.
01:05:59.889 - 01:06:30.843, Speaker A: Although, you know, a lot of the times and there's lots of economic research on this, like people's social status is much more than their financial status. So if you added money to it, you might actually make it worse. Like whenever you just say, well what, why does this matter? Well, it's just your social status. People are like, you know, I want to be right. And you know, and so like, why do you know, for example, like, what would be a fair compensation for people on Wikipedia? Like, it's impossible. The fair compensation is nothing because if you started paying people it wouldn't work.
01:06:31.019 - 01:06:31.715, Speaker C: So.
01:06:31.875 - 01:06:55.875, Speaker A: But I do think there are market mechanisms. Maybe it's their social status that you start to, you know, you way up and down. Like people within Wikipedia can see who has status. Like, this guy's amazing. Look at the number of edits they have. This girl's amazing. But I do think that there's things around prediction markers that potentially we can use to kind of move, make those mechanisms better.
01:06:57.495 - 01:06:57.871, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:06:57.903 - 01:07:09.237, Speaker C: I also, I mean, I'm curious to see just if I guess not in like a decision making sense, but I do think that there's a real problem with how polls, like political polls work.
01:07:09.381 - 01:07:09.805, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:07:09.885 - 01:07:11.645, Speaker C: I don't know the past two.
01:07:11.805 - 01:07:26.021, Speaker A: They tend, polls tend to be inputs into markets. They're. They're not. Polls by no means are perfect. And I don't think they ever really. I think they're in a lot of ways got worse. People have become less trusting of them or less trusting.
01:07:26.053 - 01:07:28.705, Speaker C: Yeah, we don't want to pick up our phones. You don't give our phones.
01:07:29.485 - 01:07:54.581, Speaker A: You even want to give them a truthful answer. So there's a lot of issues around it. I feel the markets are better aggregators of knowledge as opposed to like finders of truth. And in an election scenario, like, and you see that sometimes it's rare now, but sometimes a significant poll comes out and the market moves. You know, it doesn't happen the other way around. The market doesn't move. And then unless there's an insider at the pole.
01:07:54.581 - 01:08:07.675, Speaker A: Right. Like that's the thing. So I'm not sure the markets can replace polls. If we live in a world where there was no polls. I think you would find the markets are a lot more sort of erratic because they don't have these sources of information.
01:08:09.535 - 01:08:35.445, Speaker C: Yeah. So we're running over time. My editor is going to yell at me, Kyle I'm going to throw the last question to you here, which is we started out this podcast kind of talking about can prediction markets thrive, survive whatever, past the election in one year from now? It's late August, we're recording this. What does success look like for hedgehog markets?
01:08:36.945 - 01:09:42.029, Speaker D: Yeah, so I guess to just start off I would say yes, and then I would say success looks like more community derived markets or user derived markets. I think, like, I think it might potentially be a slightly different twist than what everybody thinks of as prediction markets right now. And I guess in a simple format it's peer to peer betting, but I think they'll take a slightly different form is kind of what I'm getting at. I think there's other avenues that haven't really been explored and I think that these other avenues need to be explored to find, I think more staying power outside of this like election hype cycle. Because I think like those markets require market makers and liquidity and a lot of trading. And I think there are markets that are good for that. Like, you know, there might be enough traders for Fed interest rates, politics, and even for like sports betting having like a decentralized like order book for sports.
01:09:42.029 - 01:10:00.664, Speaker D: But when you get into more niche prediction markets or the long tail prediction markets that people still want, I think we need to sort of change how we think about them and how people can approach them and make them more user friendly and easier to spin up and not just from a centralized source.
01:10:01.524 - 01:10:06.304, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. More community in one year is the bar.
01:10:06.604 - 01:10:07.012, Speaker D: Yes.
01:10:07.068 - 01:10:21.127, Speaker C: You guys, it's been a great conversation. Not Nigel and Kyle, I hope we were able to bury the hatchet a little bit here with some of our disagreements. But in all seriousness, I think it's been really enlightening and thank you guys so much for coming on the pod.
01:10:21.231 - 01:10:21.863, Speaker A: That's great.
01:10:21.959 - 01:10:22.715, Speaker D: Thank you.
01:10:23.815 - 01:10:24.375, Speaker C: Take care, guys.
