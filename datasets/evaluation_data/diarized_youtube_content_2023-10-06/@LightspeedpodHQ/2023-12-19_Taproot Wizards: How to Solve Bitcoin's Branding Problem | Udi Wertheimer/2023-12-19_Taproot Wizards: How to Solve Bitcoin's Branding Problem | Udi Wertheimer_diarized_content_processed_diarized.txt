00:00:00.170 - 00:00:34.498, Speaker A: A lot of the gold value in the world is stored through ETFs, but most people don't have the gold ETF. Right. But what a lot of people do have is gold jewelry. Right? Probably the main way that people interact with gold is through jewelry. That might be a similar case where bitcoin becomes very institutionalized and financialized, but most people end up interacting with it through inscriptions, like kind of art and more creative kind of stuff that they can flex.
00:00:34.594 - 00:01:03.226, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by Das London, Blockwork's number one institutional crypto conference, where all the top institutions and people in crypto are going to be this march in London. What's becoming maybe the crypto hub of the world. Have a link in the show notes where you can learn more and also discount code that will get you 20% off. So click the link, find out more, and I'll see you there. What's up, everybody? Welcome to another episode of Lightspeed. Today we're joined by Udi Worthmeyer, who's the co founder of Taproot Wizards.
00:01:03.258 - 00:01:06.574, Speaker A: Udi, welcome to the show. Thanks for having me. Yeah, man.
00:01:06.612 - 00:01:09.966, Speaker B: Pumped to have you on. Love the sunglasses. Is that the look you do on every episode?
00:01:10.078 - 00:01:16.690, Speaker A: This is the FTX sunglasses. I only wear them for Solana podcasts. Can you see it? I don't remember which site it is. One of these.
00:01:16.760 - 00:01:17.634, Speaker B: We zoom in.
00:01:17.752 - 00:01:26.354, Speaker C: Oh, there we have the. Do you have the FTX condoms? What does it say? Won't break liquidation.
00:01:26.402 - 00:01:29.710, Speaker A: I'm wearing them all the time to be safe.
00:01:29.890 - 00:01:31.226, Speaker B: You're wearing one, right?
00:01:31.328 - 00:01:35.594, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. All right, man.
00:01:35.712 - 00:01:56.738, Speaker B: I don't think most of our audience knows what taproot wizards is. Probably don't know what ordinals is. Inscriptions, et cetera. Mert actually tweeted today that inscriptions are a global threat for all blockchains. We'll get into that in a little bit. I think it would be interesting to maybe start a little bit of history with your background, but really, nfts on bitcoin, the history of that, and then we'll get to what we're knows are.
00:01:56.904 - 00:02:26.666, Speaker A: Yeah, look, I've been, like, a bitcoin addict for a good ten years or whatever. It was kind of before it was cool, and I was just a nerd, right? Like, I was a software developer. I was reading up on bitcoin. I was like, hey, this sounds, like, really cool. And I had some run ins in the past with my bank or whatever, when I tried to do some wires, and they're like, no, you can't do that. And I was like, pissed. So it clicked for me.
00:02:26.666 - 00:03:29.130, Speaker A: I was like, hey, this is money that I can use however I want, right? So I became like a bitcoin nerd, and I became known among my friends and colleagues as the annoying bitcoin nerd would keep rambling about stupid blockchain in 2013 or whatever it was. But one thing that sadly occurred was that I joined the bitcoin maximalist laser eye cult fairly early on in my journey, and I was a full blown cult member for many years. That's why I think I love Mert's tweets, mostly about the Ethereum maximus, because I see the same thing in them that I saw in myself being a cult member. And they're like the cult members of today, and I find it hilarious. So I finally broke free of the cult, kind of, I don't know, the last couple of years, but before that, I was fading NFTs as hard as I possibly could. I hated nFts. I felt like they were attacking my well being and my identity.
00:03:29.130 - 00:04:05.114, Speaker A: And I was like, man, you guys need to buy bitcoin. Why are you buying nFts? And mind you, bitcoin. NFTs did start on bitcoin. Technically, they didn't become popular in bitcoin, but they did start on bitcoin with rare pippies and stuff like that, and counterparty in whatever it was, 20, 14, 15. So I'm one of those rare people who faded NFTs for seven years. I have find a lot of that, but I have. From my point of view, it is what it is.
00:04:05.114 - 00:05:04.700, Speaker A: I'm more interested in bitcoin. That's just life. But I think that one of the things that I've seen, as I've been trying to kind of onboard people into bitcoin over those many years, is that, of course, most people just don't care. So they don't. But even when there's someone who clicks into the idea, one thing that it's always been difficult for people is self custody, right? Like, they're like, well, I'll buy some bitcoin on Coinbase or whatever, but I'm not going to move it to my own wallet. And what I've seen with NFTs, especially in 2021, 2022, is that people are so passionate about them that they're willing to jump through all the hoops to install metamask or phantom or whatever it is, to understand seed phrases, to do all that stuff just in order to play along. I was like, well, you know what? Maybe there's something there maybe through NFTs, boomers like myself can teach people about why we think bitcoin is cool.
00:05:04.700 - 00:05:53.926, Speaker A: And at least for us, that's kind of how the idea behind Tepper wizard started. We're like, okay, can we make NFTs that bitcoiners care about and that bitcoin people will be trying out and that will help onboard people into bitcoin. And it was kind of a wild thought, but I think it kind of mean in the last year, and we can't really take credit for this. The orals protocol is something that was invented by Casey Rotomore, and it's just really cool. It works on bitcoin. It allows you to issue JPeGs and other types of NFTs directly on the bitcoin chain. I think what's special about them is that unlike most NFTs on most chains, the data is on chain.
00:05:53.926 - 00:06:20.386, Speaker A: So it's going to stay there forever. It's not going to change, it's not going to disappear. The rules are not going to change on you. The issuer cannot show up after a year and say, hey, actually you can only trade on these two marketplaces, but the rest, you can't trade on them because they don't have royalties or whatever. So it's very strict and clear and you see what you get. And I think in that sense, they're just cool. I don't know if they're better than ethereum NFts or Solan NFTs.
00:06:20.386 - 00:07:00.466, Speaker A: I think they're different, and they're different enough to be interesting. So that started, and people have started using that kind of space that you can use to store JPEGs, to also store other stuff. And one of the very popular things that people have been storing is json files, which is a little bit absurd, but it allowed them to issue tokens like they call them BRC 20s. So tokens on bitcoin, and they're incredibly inefficient because they use JSON. And that's absolutely absurd. Like, if you're a developer, you know, that's really stupid way to do things, to store json files on chain. But hey, it works and people do it.
00:07:00.466 - 00:07:12.294, Speaker A: And I think that part of the reason they've done so well is because they're so absurdly inefficient and stupid that so many people were fading them. So it's part of the thing.
00:07:12.332 - 00:07:30.540, Speaker B: And I want to get further into taproot wizards here in a second. But stepping back a little bit and describing the difference between ordinals which maybe people have heard about, versus inscriptions like today, inscriptions took down arbitrum. What is the difference between those two? And why did it take until today? I think ordinals took off in 2023. Why hadn't we seen those in the past?
00:07:32.130 - 00:08:16.220, Speaker A: Yeah, so I guess strictly technically, ordinals is kind of a way to track pseudo tokens throughout the bitcoin system. They're not really tokens in the same way that they would be on other networks. You are essentially tracking SATs, which are the smallest unit of a bitcoin throughout the network and throughout the chain. And you're just assigning value to each SAT. You're saying, okay, this particular SAT is going to be token X, and this one is going to be token Y, and this one is going to be some NFTs. So Ornoles is just a protocol for tracking them. That's all it is.
00:08:16.220 - 00:08:38.226, Speaker A: It's interpreting preexisting bitcoin transactions. There's nothing special about the transactions. They're completely normal bitcoin transactions. It's interpreting them in a way that will tell you which ordinal went to which address, basically, so that you can essentially have a token scheme on top of bitcoin. Would you need that? Just.
00:08:38.248 - 00:08:52.886, Speaker B: Sorry to butt in here, but we're seeing encryptions, which I know you'll describe here in a second, on other networks, like Ethereum, avalanche, arbitrum, do they need a protocol like ordinals as well? Is it because how the Utxo model is different from how those blockchains work? Do you not need that?
00:08:53.068 - 00:09:12.750, Speaker A: Yeah, I would say that the other ones don't need that because they already have a native way to track tokens. Right. So Solana has SP 20, and not SP 20, just Spl. Right. Is what it's called. Sorry. Ethereum has ERC 20, and those are just native ways to track tokens.
00:09:12.750 - 00:10:10.286, Speaker A: And on bitcoin, you don't have that. So it's kind of a hack to track the units of bitcoin itself as an alternative to tokens. So I would say other networks probably don't need that component, but they do use encryptions. So inscriptions is a complement to ordinals, which is just a way to basically write arbitrary data originally into the bitcoin chain in any size. In the past, bitcoin developers have tried to limit the kind of amount of arbitrary data you can write into the chain, and encryptions kind of found a clever way around that. And what we did with Tucker wizard in the beginning was we mined like one big four megabyte block. One four megabyte transaction, a single transaction that had this massive JPEG file inside it.
00:10:10.286 - 00:10:55.200, Speaker A: And that blew a lot of people's minds because they didn't think it was possible. So that's what inscriptions are. A bunch of times they come with those kind of incentive schemes, right? So, like with BRC 20, people are incentivized to create those inscriptions because that's how they claim the BRC 20 tokens. And they, of course, believe they'll go up in value. So they do it, and that ends up filling up blocks. And I think in other chains, people have looked at that and they're like, hey, maybe we should do some incentivization schemes to help people fill up our blocks too, because then it looks like the chain is being used. A bunch of people have done that.
00:10:56.850 - 00:11:33.450, Speaker C: Yep, they sure have. And sometimes it takes them down. But I'm curious, maybe if we take a step back here, you mentioned how bitcoin kind of, some of the people, obviously not all them, maybe turned to some laser eye cult members, and then you wanted to make an NFT that would actually appeal to bitcoiners. What is it that makes, when you think about that as maybe a product person, how do you think about that? What is it that makes something more appealing to bitcoin people than to Ethereum or Solana people in terms of NFTs, other than the fact that it's literally on bitcoin?
00:11:34.110 - 00:12:02.260, Speaker A: Right. So I think, look, there's a bunch of things that I think different people find different kind of benefits to speak to them. One is that we talked about before, they're kind of uniquely bitcoin in the sense that they're immutable. Like, they're truly immutable. And the data is on chain, and the issuer no longer has any control after the NFTs are issued. So that's one thing. It kind of hits the kind of bitcoin ethos in a way that I think some people like.
00:12:02.260 - 00:12:39.534, Speaker A: But also tupperware wizards themselves are based on a meme from 2013, which is the bitcoin wizard meme, which is a really cool story. If we go back to 2013, most people didn't know what the word bitcoin even meant, right? They probably never heard that. And the few people who did assumed that it was something that criminals use. Right? Like you use it to buy drugs or whatever. So it had a pretty massive branding problem at the time. Most people didn't know it existed, and the few who did thought it was for criminals. Not great.
00:12:39.534 - 00:13:12.140, Speaker A: So what some people who were kind of bitcoiners did, they were trying to promote the bitcoin subreddit. That was where people were talking about bitcoin at the time. So they're trying to promote the bitcoin subreddit to the greater Reddit community. And what they did is they did a contest. They were like, hey, let's come up with an ad. And someone posted this ad that basically looks like a wizard drawn in Microsoft paint. That's what it looks like.
00:13:12.140 - 00:13:37.054, Speaker A: Very silly. It says magic Air and money and join us. And that's it. And it looks like super silly. But that ad ended up, at least at the time, being the most successful Reddit ad ever at the time, in 2013. So it did better than all the other ads on Reddit before. People just loved it.
00:13:37.054 - 00:14:28.046, Speaker A: And actually, a ton of people that you talked to who were in bitcoin at the time would tell you that the way they got into bitcoin is because they saw that ad. So it's like this infamous, crazy, stupid ad. It's a cool story, it's a cool meme. We think bitcoin has a similar branding problem today in the sense that obviously today it's very well known. Right? You'll be hard pressed to find someone doesn't know what bitcoin is. But if people actually look into bitcoin, at least in the west, usually what they're going to see is a bunch of laser eyes on Twitter that are yelling that you can only eat meat and that, I don't know, a bunch of rules and laws that have nothing to do with bitcoin. And people just are like, and you can't own other coin.
00:14:28.046 - 00:14:45.094, Speaker A: That's a sin. So you can't do that. And a bunch of crap. The people just look at that and they say, okay, these guys are crazy. And best case scenario, they move on to Ethereum and Solana. Worst case, they just fuck off. So we're like, okay, there is a branding people because those, or they become.
00:14:45.132 - 00:14:49.080, Speaker C: Like Steven Deal or Naseem Taleb and just make it a personality to shit on.
00:14:52.010 - 00:15:12.574, Speaker A: That's, that's probably the worst. You know, we were looking at that. We're like thinking, okay, these guys, the laser eye, cold, it's small. It's not really the majority of bitcoiners, most bitcoiners are not like that at all. But when people look at it, that's what they think that bitcoin is. So that's a branding problem. And if you want to fix that, branding problem.
00:15:12.574 - 00:15:51.434, Speaker A: You need to put an alternative face for bitcoin out there. And that's kind of where we're going with this. And I think a lot of people in the bitcoin community were like, hey, you know what? Yeah, we fucking do need this. This is actually something important we need to support. And also, I think, for a lot of people in kind of the greater crypto ecosystem, one of the things that I'm almost ashamed of, really, is that I think in the last two years, most people who got into crypto since 2021, I would say, probably didn't touch bitcoin at all. Never got a bitcoin wallet, never bought any, because there was no interesting opportunity to play around with. Right.
00:15:51.434 - 00:16:11.454, Speaker A: So people are like, okay, I don't know, NFTs and D five on other chains, and that's it. They're not even thinking about getting BTC. They're like, oh, it's too expensive, and there's nothing for me to do there. And they just move on. And I think that's shameful. That's absurd. And it's also really unfortunate, I think, that everyone in crypto should have at least some exposure to bitcoin.
00:16:11.454 - 00:16:49.600, Speaker A: Right. I would say if you're in crypto and you don't have at least, like, 5% exposure to bitcoin or something, then I don't know what you're doing with your life. That's absurd. But the way that bitcoin has been branded over the last few years just made it uninteresting. So what we've seen is, obviously, this should be obvious as you give people something to play with that they can get into these BRC twenty s and those inscriptions, then they're suddenly like, okay, yeah, I do want to play around with bitcoin. Sure, I might spend more time on Solana, but this looks like a cool opportunity. So that's really what we're going.
00:16:49.600 - 00:16:56.240, Speaker A: You know, we weren't sure in the beginning, but it worked well, way better than we.
00:16:57.890 - 00:17:39.440, Speaker C: That's a. You made some very good points there. It is fascinating to me, as somebody who maybe started with bitcoin and then just maybe more with Solana Maxi these days, I would say it's not clear to me what percent of the bitcoin community still feels like the laser eye cult mentality, and then what percent are actually like, okay, I'm sick of this. We need to do something about the chain. So that's my first question. What would you say the relative percentages there are and two, and this is a harder question. And I think we asked this to Nick Carter and bology, too, on the show, which is, how did this.
00:17:39.440 - 00:17:52.580, Speaker C: Why? Because you realized early on, or at some point you're like, okay, there's something weird here with this cult. We need to change something. What made you have that realization, and why don't other people have it?
00:17:53.910 - 00:18:13.500, Speaker A: I'll start with the second question. I was late. I was knee deep deep in the cold for many years. I think I only started looking outside of the cold two years ago. One of the reasons that I'm yelling off the rooftops is, look, I really do genuinely believe it's a cult. It's not a joke. It is a cult.
00:18:13.500 - 00:18:46.306, Speaker A: It fulfills all of the conditions of being a cult. And I think a lot of times in real life, when you'll meet someone who's an actual cult survivor, they'll tell you, what do you want to do with your life? I want to make sure that other people don't get into the cult, because I really think it's bad. I think it's unhealthy. It's unhealthy for bitcoin. It's especially unhealthy for the members of the cult. So, yeah, I just think it's an important thing to talk about. And I'm seeing the same thing in Ethereum these days and in a bunch of other ecosystems.
00:18:46.306 - 00:19:22.778, Speaker A: So I think it's important. It's like an important topic, but more than that, like everything. I think it started with good intentions. I think around 2017 especially, there were just so many scams, man, there are so many scams. Like 2017, with all the ICOs, it was ugly, really was. And I think a lot of people got burnt. People who were already in bitcoin in 2017 and went into these ICOs, and they got burned badly.
00:19:22.778 - 00:20:08.510, Speaker A: And I think a lot of this kind of laser eye cold thing was kind of a reaction to that, where people were basically trying to defend the tribe and saying, like, okay, if someone's raising money for a crypto project, they're probably a scammer. And in 2017, that was a pretty good heuristic. And I think at some point, we missed the signs that things are changing, and it's no longer just scams. Now, to be clear, I would say the crypto is still, like, 95% plus scams, but it's not 100% anymore. And I think we missed the transition as bitcoin maximalist. Right. We missed the transition from, hey, it's all scams to it's no longer all scams and that was a mistake.
00:20:08.510 - 00:20:33.782, Speaker A: It wasn't anyone's bad intention, it was just a mistake. And then it kept reinforcing itself to. At some point it just cope. At some point it just becomes cope. You're like, oh, why are Ethereum people making money? Why are salana people making money? Why is everyone making money? And bitcoin is only up 100% in three years. What's going on? So it just becomes cope. And at some point you're like, you can't stop it.
00:20:33.782 - 00:21:00.734, Speaker A: People are obsessed and completely out of their minds. I think that's roughly what's going on there. But to the question of percentages and stuff, I think the laser eye cult is no bigger than 5% of bitcoiners. And it's probably. I can't have hard numbers, right? It's probably much smaller than 5%. I'm saying 5% is like an extreme exaggeration. It's probably way smaller than that.
00:21:00.734 - 00:21:34.886, Speaker A: Most bitcoiners that I know from the time that I kind of became a bitcoin holder are not like that at all. Look who bought into the Ethereum. ICO exclusively bitcoiners. There was no one else. Everyone who got into the all of 100% of the early Ethereum people are bitcoiners, right? All of them. I know a ton of big bitcoin supporters who are also big salana supporters. It's very common for bitcoiner.
00:21:34.886 - 00:21:48.160, Speaker A: How do you become an early bitcoiner in the first place? It's because you're open minded and you like experimenting with stuff, otherwise you're not going to become an early bitcoiner. Right. So of course, for the majority of those people, they're not like that at all.
00:21:49.250 - 00:21:53.998, Speaker B: When you say that, though, I think it's interesting because like two adjectives I think of with bitcoin, which I am.
00:21:54.004 - 00:21:57.882, Speaker A: A fan, but I think of Doomer and boomer, right?
00:21:58.036 - 00:22:05.058, Speaker B: Older and people think that the world's going to end. Even though you just described as people got involved with bitcoin, who were more exploratory, wanted to get involved with the.
00:22:05.064 - 00:22:06.786, Speaker A: Tech cryptography, which is true.
00:22:06.808 - 00:22:24.202, Speaker B: Like people in my college that were early to bitcoin were those type of people. So I'm curious, where did that go wrong? And one thing I really like about you, I've heard you describe yourself as more of a storyteller in that taproot wizards allows you to show, not just tell, you don't just have podcasters talking about why the world's going to end. And you should use bitcoin instead.
00:22:24.256 - 00:22:26.538, Speaker A: It shows people a thing to be.
00:22:26.544 - 00:22:29.370, Speaker B: Optimistic about and then they might get involved with bitcoin afterwards.
00:22:29.790 - 00:23:03.046, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. I think that's the branding problem I was talking about. Right. Yeah, I know. When you look at bitcoin, anyone who's not part of the bitcoin ecosystem, and looking from the outside into bitcoin, they're like, yeah, these are like boomers, preppers, right? They're sitting in their underground basement with nuclear defenses or whatnot and ready for the world to go kaboom and sit on their fucking bitcoin and tell everyone that they told them so. Right. That's what they look like.
00:23:03.046 - 00:23:18.330, Speaker A: They look like gold bugs, essentially. Like the digital gold bugs. Right. And the thing is, it's not true. Yeah, there's a bunch of those. There's like maybe 10,000, 20,000 people like that. But there's 100 million bitcoin holders.
00:23:18.330 - 00:23:47.080, Speaker A: There was this interesting research paper, I think, by Grayscale in, I think it was last year in 2022, if I remember correctly. And they basically set out to find in the US specifically how many bitcoin holders also have other coins. What do you think, percentage wise? What do you think the number is going to be?
00:23:49.850 - 00:23:50.920, Speaker B: 80%.
00:23:52.090 - 00:24:19.390, Speaker A: Yeah. So 87% of bitcoin holders in the US also own other crypto coins, right? Because of course they do. I mean, it's absurd. Why wouldn't they? Right? Of course they do. And only 13% only have bitcoin. And now out of those 13%, I would assume the majority is not for ideological reasons, not for religious reasons. It's not because they think that ethereum is a sin.
00:24:19.390 - 00:24:41.880, Speaker A: They happen to look into bitcoin. They bought some and they moved on with their lives, and it's sitting in their Coinbase account or in their treasure or whatever it is, and that's it. But it's not because they're ideological about it. So how many people are actually ideological about you? You may only own bitcoin. If you own anything else, you're a sinner. Yeah, I'm sure it's less than 5%.
00:24:45.450 - 00:25:13.540, Speaker C: I believe that. It is interesting, though, because the things that you see most on the interwebs, right, Reddit and Twitter are usually the laser guys, because they tend to get the most attention or at least controversy, and so it ends up spreading. Do you think that ever changes? Or I guess maybe a better question is how do you see that playing out in the next five to ten years? Do you think that always remains there?
00:25:14.630 - 00:25:57.886, Speaker A: Yeah, so if you'd asked me the same question a year ago, I was almost ready to lose hope. It was difficult to see what was going to change it. I thought it was clearly damaging both to those people themselves and also to bitcoin as a movement and as an asset, really. But I didn't know what changes it. Right. So what happened with Ornolds, though? I think the most important and interesting thing that happened there is that it really opened people's minds as to what is possible with bitcoin. A year ago, people would be like, well, you can't build X on Bitcoin because bitcoin cannot support it.
00:25:57.886 - 00:26:56.398, Speaker A: And I think that now people have seen a lot of stuff built on bitcoin within a single year. People are like, well, you know what? Probably everything has happened if we go and build it. Everything is possible if we build it, right? And I think that just really changed the approach. One of the problems you asked before, how did this happen? I think the reason the laser eyes got to this kind of prominent position is because there was nothing else to talk about on bitcoin. What else would you talk about? So the people who became popular are the people who, they talk about macro conditions all day. They talk about bitcoin as a way of life and what you need to eat and how you need to educate your children in order to be a true bitcoiner, because there was nothing else to talk about. You look at other chains, obviously, who are the kind of figures that you look up to on other ecosystems.
00:26:56.398 - 00:27:36.030, Speaker A: It's usually builders, founders, entrepreneurs, traders sometimes. But it's people who go out there and do shit and have both interesting opinions, but also actual accomplishments. And people look up to them because they did something right. And on bitcoin, because nobody did anything. You didn't have people to look up to who are like that, right? And I think that what happened in the last year is people are like, well, actually, here's a group of people who made a ton of money on bitcoin. Here's a group of people who created something. Here's a group of people who built a marketplace that people are using.
00:27:36.030 - 00:28:00.806, Speaker A: So actually, those people are a lot more interesting than some podcaster who's rambling about diet, right? So I think that's making a very deep cultural change in what bitcoin is. I'm super bullish now. I was really about to give up. And now look, I've been in bitcoin ten years. I don't think I've been this foolish ever.
00:28:00.988 - 00:28:07.154, Speaker C: Oh, wow. Okay, that's interesting. Alpha for some of the salon listeners.
00:28:07.282 - 00:28:34.122, Speaker B: Quick break to tell you about an upcoming event I promise you don't want to miss. It's Blockberg's biggest and best institutional conference called Das London. It's a two day event happening in London this March, where we're going to have over 700 institutions, 130 speakers, and a couple of thousand of us all under one roof. Crypto is in a position for the first time to actually onboard these institutions, and they're showing up. We have companies from Blackrock to visa launching real products in the space. We have the real world asset narrative taking off. We have things like payments that have been exponentially growing, and then we have things like deepen happening in the Solana ecosystem.
00:28:34.122 - 00:28:55.094, Speaker B: There's a ton of capital right now in this institutional space that's going to be coming on chain. It's going to completely change the industry. Whether you are an institution or you're a retail user, or you just want to learn more about what's going on in the space, this conference is for you. You're going to be able to meet some of the best and smartest people in the space. The speaker lineup is absolutely incredible, and you'll get to hang out with me. But the best part is you actually get 20% off your ticket if you use light speed 20 when checking out. That's light speed 20.
00:28:55.094 - 00:29:04.746, Speaker B: I put a link in the show notes. I recommend buying this today because, one, you'll forget about it. Two, these ticket prices go up every single month. So anyways, I hope to see you there. Now let's get back to the show.
00:29:04.848 - 00:29:37.954, Speaker C: So I am curious, actually, there's actually more than ordinals. When I last looked, you guys are even talking about, I mean, obviously there's stacks, there's lightning network, there's even talk of L two s on bitcoin. Where I want to approach this from is our audience probably doesn't know bitcoin too much. They're probably going to be Salana or Ethereum people. Can you maybe do like a lightning summary of those developments and what's going on in bitcoin land? And that's not just holding the would say so.
00:29:37.992 - 00:29:58.890, Speaker A: A lot of those things. I would say most of those things are very early. Lightning has been around for a long time, and I feel comfortable saying that lightning has been a failure. A lot of bitcoin people would be annoyed with me for saying that, but I think that's pretty self apparent. Nobody's using it. Nobody gives a shit. So I would say that has not succeeded.
00:29:58.890 - 00:30:50.646, Speaker A: But I think again, what's changing the last year is people are like, well, we can try other stuff. One reason I really like your criticism about L2s on Ethereum, because I think they're true. What's really interesting in the context of bitcoin though, that a L2 or roll up is actually something completely different. Because a roll up in the context of Ethereum, you're obviously only talking about scaling, right? That's what a roll up does in the context of Ethereum. And yeah, when you start thinking about it, has a far bone like fracturing liquidity and a bunch of other issues that that creates. From the bitcoin point of view, a roll up is not mainly about scaling. A roll up is really about adding functionality.
00:30:50.646 - 00:31:29.610, Speaker A: Because bitcoin does not have a VM doesn't. You could say that the bitcoin script is a very basic VM, but that's not an interesting thing to say. Yeah, bitcoin doesn't have like a serious real VM. And if you add a roll up on top, then now you can use the bitcoin asset in a VM in a somewhat trust minimized way. So in the context of bitcoin, a roll up doesn't just add scale in some broken way. It actually makes bitcoin more functional and allows people to do more things with bitcoin. So I actually think that the roll up design is a much better fit to bitcoin than it is for Ethereum.
00:31:29.610 - 00:31:55.234, Speaker A: Bitcoin also has this. Unlike Ethereum, bitcoin really cannot change a lot. It's really hard to change bitcoin, make upgrades to the kind of base layer. And I think we probably would be able to get a few small upgrades in. But no one's going to turn bitcoin into Solana. That ship has sailed a long, long time ago. Bitcoin is going to remain very similar to its architecture today.
00:31:55.234 - 00:32:58.086, Speaker A: So building in layers on top of bitcoin makes sense because that's the only thing you can do in terms of bitcoin. So yeah, I think that a roll up on bitcoin actually makes way more sense than a roll up on Ethereum. And I assume that the way would go is that those roll, it's very likely there would be one roll up and not 50, and it's not a way to decentralize things or to scale them. It's probably going to remain very expensive to use that roll up, probably, but at least you would be able to use BTC and smart contracts if you really wanted know. I don't ever see bitcoin becoming a mainstream platform where they build the next Instagram on top of it or something like that. I don't think ever is going to happen. But if people want to build a marketplace for high end nfts, like very high end nfts, where the velocity is kind of low, then yeah, maybe.
00:32:58.086 - 00:32:59.640, Speaker A: I think that could work.
00:33:01.050 - 00:33:34.286, Speaker B: Do you see a future at all where ordinals become a large percent, a continual large percent of the bitcoin block? Because let me know if these numbers are right, but I think fees are up like 300 times since ordinals have come out. I have some numbers here. It's like 48 million ordinals in total have been, I guess, minted is what we would call it in Salana or Ethereum. And then it's about, I think, 160 or 260,000,000 in fees, which a lot of people know that bitcoin does right now have a long term fee problem, potentially. So I'm just curious, where do you see that going? Do you think ordinals will be a larger and larger percentage of what bitcoin is?
00:33:34.468 - 00:34:27.438, Speaker A: Yeah, I suspect it's going to continue. Yeah, I think the way I'm looking at it. Look, of course some people are not going to like that, but the way I'm looking at it is I think there is a high probability that bitcoin ends up becoming like a playground for basically rich people who are able to pay very high fees and in return they get to play around with those kind of luxury items. And I assume that's probably what's going to happen. And I view things like Solana as what everyone else is going to use, like the vast majority of people are probably going to use, right? And that's awesome. And then I look at Ethereum and I'm like, well, what is Ethereum for then? Because most people are going to use Solana. Bitcoin, I believe, is going to be kind of the luxury end of the spectrum.
00:34:27.438 - 00:34:34.580, Speaker A: And then what the heck is Ethereum for? I generally don't know, but we'll find out.
00:34:35.190 - 00:34:44.534, Speaker B: How do you feel about bitcoin being exported to other chains? Let's just say to Solana, I know you lose some of the security of bitcoin, but do you feel positively and how does the rest of the community feel about that?
00:34:44.732 - 00:35:32.226, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it depends on who you ask, right. I think WBTC on Ethereum has been pretty popular, right? It's fairly popular on defi apps. So obviously there is a market for that. I would have preferred to use Solana for those things than Ethereum, but also the last time someone tried tokenize bitcoin on Solana was FTX and that didn't really the best way possible. So hopefully the next one will be better. It depends on who you ask. But I think one of the things I'm pretty sure there are going to happen is that bitcoin will end up at least having the ability to bridge in a more trust minimized way to other chains.
00:35:32.226 - 00:35:47.340, Speaker A: Today it's like really fully trusted bridges. But I think that bitcoin will receive the upgrades that are necessary in order to at least remove some of those trust assumptions so that you can easily bridge it to other chains. I think that's something that will happen.
00:35:48.750 - 00:35:58.670, Speaker C: What do you think? Or what do you see as somebody that's obviously pretty active in the bitcoin community? What do you want the chain to look like in five to ten years?
00:35:58.740 - 00:35:58.974, Speaker B: Right?
00:35:59.012 - 00:36:08.100, Speaker C: Like let's say we're even more boomer now we're looking at the chain. What do you want to see? What's the ideal state?
00:36:09.110 - 00:36:50.350, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's where I see it as kind of the luxury DFI NFC playground. I think that's why it's going to be, which means we're not going to have millions of transactions per minute or anything like that. I think it's going to remain at something like 4000 transactions every ten minute block like it is today. Same ballpark. But I think just the value in those transactions is going to grow a lot. And yeah, the other thing, we just happen to just talk about those two things, but I think the other thing is BTC itself as an asset, I think can be very valuable in other chains. And I think that's something that's going to happen a lot.
00:36:50.350 - 00:37:52.062, Speaker A: People bridge their bitcoin to other assets because look, at the end of the day, I think especially people who know people talk about institutions and I think it's true for institutions, but I think it's also true for a lot of types of just whales and just people who sit on a lot of crypto. I think for a lot of them, they do prefer to have a large portion of their portfolio in bitcoin just because they consider it to be more stable, more reliable and less risky. So I think for these kind of big wallets it makes sense to maintain BTC, but maybe they still want to deposit it into some lending app in Solana. So I think that that functionality is going to be pretty important when people talk about L2s or bitcoin. I'm like, yeah, okay, fine, whatever. But I don't see a difference between, I think that's probably something we agree on, Murd. I don't see a difference between the term L2 and just a blockchain.
00:37:52.062 - 00:38:21.510, Speaker A: Right? It's just marketing speak. So if someone wants to use bitcoin on Ethereum or Solana instead of on bitcoin, L2, I don't see the difference. Like, whatever. It's the same product wise and conceptually it's the same thing. So I think bitcoin would allow for those kind of things. And just as a financial asset, look, bitcoin is a trillion dollar financial asset now. It's a grown up and we're looking at an ETF that I'm pretty convinced is going to happen imminently.
00:38:21.510 - 00:38:29.280, Speaker A: So it's just a serious asset that people are going to have in their portfolios and we're going to want to use it everywhere is what I think.
00:38:29.810 - 00:38:48.674, Speaker B: Got one thing to add in here, Merck. I saw you react to that. One thing that I do think with l two s that ethereum has that maybe bitcoin doesn't, is one just the developers. So bitcoin isn't known. It's more stagnant as you've described it. It's actually encouraged people not to change bitcoin at all. And so a lot of those developers have gone to Ethereum.
00:38:48.674 - 00:39:13.200, Speaker B: And in Salana land we talk about why velocity and efficiency is much more important than TVL. Ethereum has very high TvL and I think that's true. But also that TVL attracts developers and also l two s because they know they can get some of that TVL into their l two. I mean, we've seen what happened with blast, like 700 million. They don't have a product. So how do you get that to change on bitcoin? Because you need both those users and that developer mentality to change.
00:39:14.690 - 00:39:52.566, Speaker A: Yeah, look, luckily there's a trillion dollars in TVL on bitcoin right now. Right. So the trick is to get a portion of that to kind of start mobilizing. Right. There's a lot of dormant TVL on Bitcoin and the trick is to get this to start moving, to get people to start allocating. And look, what we've seen in the last year is that it's happening, right? Like it's happening, I think, way faster than we expected. So I do think that trend will continue to a point that eventually people will be like, well, actually, if you're looking for the highest EVL, that's probably on bitcoin and on Ethereum.
00:39:52.566 - 00:40:03.520, Speaker A: We're not there yet, not for real. There's definitely more value on the bitcoin chain, but it's dormant, and I think that a lot of those dormant coins are going to become active soon.
00:40:04.850 - 00:40:33.698, Speaker C: One thing I'm curious about is, and I can kind of maybe pattern match based on your answers this episode. But one thing I'm curious about is how bitcoin people see, and obviously this depends on the person, but maybe you personally see the entire industry right now in crypto. And what I mean by that is, honestly, it's quite complex. Like, you enter and then you hear, well, there's bitcoin, but then there's Ethereum. There's all twos. There's all threes. Some of those all twos use Celestia.
00:40:33.698 - 00:40:56.206, Speaker C: Some of those L2s are zks. Oh, and then there's Salana, and then actually there's also cosmos and app chains. So there's like quite a bit going on. And then now there's Aptos. And you, how do you think about this? As somebody who's quite early to the space, did you see this coming? Did you see any hints of a future like this?
00:40:56.228 - 00:41:26.680, Speaker A: At the time, I did not think it will turn out that way, no. I thought it would be too complicated for people to care. Right. And there were always projects talking about very things that seemed like really up there in L2s and layer threes. But I always assume that it'll be like, well, I can't wrap my head around it. I just don't care as I thought, what people would think. But clearly that's not what happened.
00:41:26.680 - 00:42:34.606, Speaker A: I think though, at the end of the day, obviously, look, obviously the main use case of crypto right now is gambling. Right? I think that's pretty clear. But if we look a step beyond that, then I think people also want to hold assets, and different people have different preferences for different types of assets. Not everyone is necessarily going to the extreme end of the risk curve. Like Shore Bonk is fun, but some people prefer something that's a little more grounded. Right? If I had to guess, and I've been wrong so many times before, so who the fuck knows? But if I had to guess, I think that if we're going to kind of break through into the billion user stuff that people are talking about sometimes, if we're going to get there, I don't think that people are going to know what chain they're using and what's the tech behind it. It just doesn't make sense to me that everyone will be that deeply into it.
00:42:34.606 - 00:43:00.360, Speaker A: And there's probably two things they're going to know. One is which asset I own and two is maybe like which app or game am I playing or whatnot? I don't think they're going to interface with those things with five different wallets, and I just don't see that happening. So maybe we just don't get to a billion people. Maybe. But if we do, I think that a lot of this stuff is going to have to be kind of abstracted out, probably.
00:43:02.170 - 00:43:24.560, Speaker B: Do you see taproot wizards becoming something more than just an. And, you know, you've seen bonk, and a lot of people think bonk and other NFTs, for example, and Solana and also Ethereum, that if you own one of those nfts, you'll get airdrops and you'll be recognized by other communities. And I'm sure that could happen with Taproot. But also you see some of these NFT projects expanding into other things. Do you want to do that at.
00:43:25.730 - 00:44:15.338, Speaker A: Absolutely. You know, we announced stories, I think it was a month ago, and the goal with that is not to just draw more JPEGs. We think that that same community that has been pushing bitcoin forward in the last year, we think that that same community will be able to really, we talked about stuff like roll ups and a bunch of other things that need to happen in the bitcoin ecosystem, and we think we need to go out and build it. Is the TLDR. I don't think anyone else will if we don't start pushing it forward. And I think that once that happens, I think bitcoin is going to become much more competitive as an ecosystem. So we just believe that there's this gap between bitcoin right now and Ethereum and other ecosystems.
00:44:15.338 - 00:44:45.480, Speaker A: And I think that a big percentage, a big chunk of that gap is going to be closed. Not all of it, but some of it. Right. And I think there's a ton of opportunity in just building what is necessary to at least make that gap smaller again, because we talked about how it's a trillion dollar ecosystem and some of that is going to become active. So, yeah, we think there's a lot more to do there beyond just jpegs. Absolutely.
00:44:46.090 - 00:45:10.270, Speaker B: I'm just thinking in my head, it'd be pretty creative to see if you could do this with cryptography if you're a Solana project and you want to target bitcoiners that probably do have a lot of capital that's been idle. You could target those addresses that own, for example, a taproot wizard, and say, somehow, if you can cryptographically link a bitcoin address, we have a wallet waiting for you with an airdrop of our token over in Solana. So that'd be a pretty cool acquisition.
00:45:13.650 - 00:46:04.778, Speaker A: Think. You know, in general, I think we're going to see a lot more of this kind of cross chain things. Right? Culturally, it's funny, bitcoin and Ethereum has this massive rivalry, and Ethereum and Solana has this massive rivalry, but it's only one generation. It never lasts for two generations. So I don't know a lot of bitcoin people who are particularly upset about Solana and vice versa. And I think that as those generations continue, I think you're going to continue to see that there's going to be a lot of communities that are happy to cooperate between themselves. It's only like the stupid rivalries between the edges that are like, yeah, but those are know, I don't think that's going to be what stops cooperation between these networks.
00:46:04.874 - 00:46:26.630, Speaker C: So I posted before 1 minute before the episode. I was like, okay, chat, show me some questions for Rudy. None of them are really good. They're really pretty weird. Like when butcoin SVM roll up, or when Solana wizards, or when SVM on bitcoin Dog or fat cat. Anyway, so that is all to say. I am curious, though, because you're a big Twitter user.
00:46:26.630 - 00:46:38.780, Speaker C: First of all, what do you think about the app and how do you use it in the context of crypto? Because I know people have different views on this.
00:46:39.390 - 00:47:12.094, Speaker A: Yeah, look, you hit the nail on the head. Twitter is mental illness. So I think anyone who's using it frequently is not. Well, I'm definitely in that group. You can tell yourself, like, oh, no, I use it for market research, and it's marketing, and it's just a form of sickness. But also, look, also, honestly, I don't think crypto would exist without it. Right.
00:47:12.094 - 00:47:57.346, Speaker A: We do need a place to congregate. Maybe it would have been something else instead of Twitter, but there definitely needs to be a social layer where people interact. I think that's really what we're doing in crypto. And all the blockchain stuff on top of it is kind of just to make things easier, but if we had to, we would have done it with spreadsheets, which, by the way, in oral, that's what we've done in the first month before we had marketplaces and wallets built out. We literally just said, okay, we're inscribing this and here's a spreadsheet that we write down who owns what and you can buy your position in the spreadsheet. And eventually when we figure out the technical parts, we'll stop using the spreadsheet, which is what happened. But yeah, I think that's what we would have done.
00:47:57.346 - 00:48:09.820, Speaker A: We would have used a spreadsheet for bonk and we would have said, like, who owns what and just trade it there if we had to. Right. But the social layer behind that is what really counts, if you ask me.
00:48:11.870 - 00:48:15.082, Speaker C: Gary, do you have any final questions before I do? Some rapid fire?
00:48:15.216 - 00:48:29.978, Speaker B: Yeah, I just got financial advice questions for you, odi. I've got the ETF coming up. What do you think about it? I mean, it doesn't have to be from a price perspective, but how do you think that's going to change either the community, or how people think about bitcoin, or how do you think it's going to change the demand for it? Any thoughts?
00:48:30.154 - 00:48:56.134, Speaker A: My main assumption during the year, and look, it could still turn out wrong, but my main assumption during the year was that we're going to see the price run up towards the ETF approval. And from there on I'm not as sure. Thank you. Gladly. The first part came true. Now I hope that I'm wrong about the second part. I don't know.
00:48:56.134 - 00:49:37.058, Speaker A: It's not that I think that necessarily everything's going to crash. It's more that I view it as kind of a singularity event, that I don't really have a strong opinion about what happens next. Whereas I felt like it was pretty easy to tell what was going to happen before. So now that most of that, I think, kind of played out, now it's like, yeah, honestly, I don't have a strong opinion anymore. I don't know if I completely have to guess. I would say, yeah, probably. Maybe you see some kind of a blow off top and then you realize that the institutions are not standing in line to buy the ETF eventually over three, four years.
00:49:37.058 - 00:50:44.854, Speaker A: I do think that it's a very important growth engine, but not in one week like some people seem to expect. Like, hey, VTF approves, we go to 2 million, because immediately everyone buys it. Probably not, but it is a very important, crucial part of the infrastructure that I think over the next few years will probably play a big part. So that's how I'm thinking about it at least. I think the one interesting thing, though, if you accept that bitcoin is going to go through a process of financialization over multiple years, and it's not like a one week event, but a thing that's going to take a while, I think you can compare it to the financialization of gold in whatever, like 30 years ago, whatnot. And I think it's really interesting how you might argue that a lot of the gold value in the world is stored through ETFs, but definitely not most people in the world are interacting with ETF.
00:50:44.902 - 00:50:45.066, Speaker B: Right?
00:50:45.088 - 00:51:39.610, Speaker A: Like, most people don't have the gold ETF. Right. But what a lot of people do have is gold jewelry. Right? Probably the main way that people interact with gold is through jewelry. They have whatever, necklaces and stuff, and it's made of gold, and that's when they think of the world. Ward gold. That's why they think even though the majority of the gold value is financialized, and I think it might be similar with bitcoin, and I'm not talking about like a month from now, but kind of years into the future, I think that might be a similar case where bitcoin becomes very institutionalized and financialized, but most people end up interacting with it through stuff like ornaments and inscriptions, like kind of art, and more creative kind of stuff that they can flex.
00:51:39.610 - 00:52:07.480, Speaker A: I think that's a very possible outcome. So that's one of the reasons why I'm so interested in that. I think if we go into a world where bitcoin is viewed as truly digital gold, just a digital version of gold, and I think the way they flex it is not by saying, hey, I have half a BTC in my wallet. It's more by saying, hey, look at my cool jpegs. I think that makes more sense.
00:52:08.890 - 00:52:20.150, Speaker C: All right, time for rapid fire. I am caffeinated today, so I will be asking these fast. All right, favorite NFT that's not on bitcoin.
00:52:21.210 - 00:52:30.022, Speaker A: Mad lads. Well, mad lads and cryptopunks, those are the two. Obviously, cryptopunk has their place, but in the last year, like, mad lads, I think, are killing it.
00:52:30.176 - 00:52:32.270, Speaker C: Favorite app that's not on bitcoin.
00:52:34.210 - 00:52:40.160, Speaker A: Man. I don't know. They're all shit. I don't know. Okay.
00:52:41.010 - 00:52:46.900, Speaker C: If you had to recommend people follow someone to keep up with bitcoin, that's not you, who would it be?
00:52:49.430 - 00:53:17.020, Speaker A: Man, that's a tough one. That's actually a tough one, because interesting recommendation that people would not expect. Maybe Dylan Leclerc. He's kind of almost in the laser eye camp, and I disagree with him with a lot of stuff, but I think he's kind of fresh and knows how to appeal to a lot of people. So I think he's a good first follow. Okay.
00:53:17.630 - 00:53:20.974, Speaker C: What do you hate the most about crypto, man?
00:53:21.012 - 00:53:38.846, Speaker A: It's just so much scams, man. And it's very scammy. And it's clearly unhealthy. Right. It's not healthy to be in crypto. We agree of that, right? I would not recommend it, but once you're hooked, you're hooked.
00:53:39.038 - 00:53:41.090, Speaker C: What do you love the most about crypto?
00:53:45.450 - 00:53:54.806, Speaker A: The risk taking is fun. I don't know. It's fun living on the edge or.
00:53:54.828 - 00:53:58.470, Speaker C: What is your most unpopular opinion that you think is true about the industry?
00:54:00.250 - 00:54:20.800, Speaker A: Yeah, it's probably this about how I think bitcoin is going to catch up with the other ecosystems. I think bitcoin is going to be kind of unrecognizable in a couple of years from now, and people will be like, wait, are you telling me that two years ago there was nothing else to do with it other than holding it in Coinbase? Impossible. So I really believe that's going to happen.
00:54:21.810 - 00:54:25.970, Speaker C: What are your three top ecosystems outside of bitcoin?
00:54:26.950 - 00:54:37.990, Speaker A: I don't know, man. Like ethereum, Solana. What else is there? I don't know. What do you think about binance is cool. Binance onboarded a ton of people into crypto.
00:54:39.290 - 00:54:53.580, Speaker C: What do you think about some of those earlier proof of work, like litecoin and stuff? What do people generally think about those? I know they're kind of memes, but I'm curious if there's what you think about them.
00:54:55.630 - 00:55:11.630, Speaker A: I mean, they were necessary. I think a lot of what went into the Ethereum design started through all those proof of work, altcoins, but I don't know if there's a point in them anymore. Right. Yeah, they're just memes.
00:55:12.370 - 00:55:17.140, Speaker B: Udi, what's something that you've learned now that you're leading a brand that you didn't know before?
00:55:18.390 - 00:55:56.398, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's mainly like the storytelling stuff, and that's kind of like an experience that I kind of gained through the years, probably. But yeah, it might be obvious to you guys, but you just don't go and yell at people that you want them to. Hey, you need to use self custody. You need to use this coin and not that coin. That doesn't work. It just doesn't. You need to give people a good story and something to play with if you want them to change their behavior, and it will need to make sense to them.
00:55:56.398 - 00:55:59.182, Speaker A: It will need to have value for them and not just for you.
00:55:59.316 - 00:56:00.000, Speaker C: So.
00:56:01.730 - 00:56:03.140, Speaker A: That'S probably it.
00:56:03.990 - 00:56:07.940, Speaker C: What's the number one advice you would give to people looking to build on bitcoin today?
00:56:09.590 - 00:56:36.300, Speaker A: Yeah, just start, man. Just start. There's so much opportunity in capital flowing into funding. Basically anything. Just don't wait and do it, because I'm 100% certain in the opportunity that is there, and I think it's not going to stay there forever. I think the gap is going to get closed much sooner than people think. So just start now, like today.
00:56:37.710 - 00:56:40.780, Speaker C: All right. I think that's a good place to finish.
00:56:41.150 - 00:56:42.006, Speaker A: Sweet, Udi.
00:56:42.038 - 00:56:52.650, Speaker B: Well, this is an awesome conversation. This is our first bitcoin conversation we've had, so if we're going to have anyone on, you're the person for it, man. You're very forward thinking in the bitcoin community, which you've kind of described doesn't always exist.
00:56:52.730 - 00:56:54.446, Speaker A: So lucky to have you.
00:56:54.628 - 00:56:58.114, Speaker B: Have to have you on in another year and actually see where bitcoin's gone.
00:56:58.232 - 00:57:03.970, Speaker A: Yeah, let's see if I'm bullshitting or if I was right. I'm looking forward to that.
00:57:04.120 - 00:57:06.114, Speaker B: Sweet, mate. Well, thanks so much for coming on.
00:57:06.232 - 00:57:08.786, Speaker A: Yep. Thanks, guys. See you next time.
