00:00:00.330 - 00:00:28.280, Speaker A: My philosophy has always been that you, as someone who grew up on the Internet, you, as a user of the Internet, sort of no longer have a choice about whether or not you want to be on the Internet. Like, if you go on a date, someone's going to look you up before on Instagram. And if you're not on Instagram, that's to be weird. Like, you kind of just you need to be on these platforms. You need to be on LinkedIn, as cringe as it is, if you want to have, like, a trad job. Like, all of these things feel very true. And so I think if we don't have the ability to exit these systems, we should at least have a voice in them.
00:00:28.280 - 00:01:07.890, Speaker A: If we want to get people to the point where they can actually have a voice and this becomes effective, you need to use mechanisms that get people interested and engaged in digital spaces. And the way that we know you can get people interested and engaged in digital spaces is by making them addictive. So I think there's definitely, again, a dark pattern here that you want to be careful about, but I think we need to start using some of these more questionable practices on the Internet. Actually. I think that we should explore what it might look like to ethically use some patterns that I think we've stayed very far away from as a matter of principle.
00:01:14.550 - 00:01:17.246, Speaker B: What's up, everybody? Welcome to another episode of Lightspeed.
00:01:17.278 - 00:01:17.522, Speaker C: Today.
00:01:17.576 - 00:01:30.120, Speaker B: We are joined by David Phelps and Chase Chapman. David is the founder of Joker Race, and Chase is the host of a podcast called on the Other Side. It's actually on the Blockworks Network and also contributor at Metropolis. David and Chase, welcome to the show.
00:01:31.450 - 00:01:32.200, Speaker A: Thanks.
00:01:36.570 - 00:02:06.370, Speaker B: If you guys heard the beginning before we hit record, be very excited about this conversation. This one's going to be a bit different than usual, but I actually think it's not only going to be fun, but it's going to be super insightful. Chase, I'm going to actually copy you on a question that I've heard you ask a lot of your guests, and you say, what are assumptions that you are questioning or, like, should the crypto community be questioning? And I think a really good place to start would be in governance because you both have some really fun and insightful ideas on this. So maybe Chase, let's start with you. What is something that crypto gets wrong about governance?
00:02:06.870 - 00:03:01.510, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think starting out, we think about governance as this design space that people give a shit about, and I just think that's not really true for the most part. I think if we want to have this user owned and user controlled Internet that seems to be sort of like the guidepost for where we're going, I think we need to be thinking about governance a lot more as a feature than as a product itself. I feel like last bull market, we did a lot of building around governance as like this thing that people are going to want to do. And I think we need to move towards governance as this feature of consumer applications where it's kind of built into these experiences. It's maybe native to consumer, sort of like flows and interfaces. And so I've been thinking a lot about that and how to make governance more fun, which I know David has also been thinking about and building around for Joke race and in general. I know something you've been thinking about, David.
00:03:02.410 - 00:03:37.166, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it's interesting because it's like you say the word governance and everyone just shoot themselves. Unless you're like a hacker or an Arbitrator and you're like, governance is amazing because it's like, I can go in and rug a treasury. Governance is this awesome thing for me. But unless you're that guy, yeah, governance sucks. That's why we don't even use the term governance. We use the term contests. And I think when you switch it to the word contest, you realize, okay, wait, everything is contest, right? Your yearbook thing is a contest.
00:03:37.166 - 00:04:22.974, Speaker C: Your election for president is a contest. But even every social media platform is a contest. When you're going on Twitter, you're putting a proposal to the world and saying, what do you think of this? And then a bunch of people upvote it with this feature called like right. And then if they upload it enough, then it gets more popularity to be seen by more people. And so you are in a contest where you're competing against everyone else's content in order to gain visibility. And that is the game that you are playing is like you are in this constant contest to try to get votes by saying, I have a proposal, give me votes. Right? And so it's like once you get into that mindset of like, oh, wait, Twitter is governance, right? That's working okay, maybe that's not working well, it's working pretty shittily, but it works effectively, at least as an addiction to get people excited and participating in this.
00:04:22.974 - 00:04:53.734, Speaker C: And then it's like, okay, there's a lot we have to learn from social media about how to build contests, right? And it's this interesting thing because it's like, I mean, what is a blockchain? A blockchain is a contest. It is like a bunch of transactions all competing to get inclusion in a block. Right. That is a contest too. And so it's like all the way down, you just see contest contests everywhere. It's how our society functions is like we love to think about the contest between presidents and that fight as know. And then you get to the Dow space and it's like there's no way to submit.
00:04:53.734 - 00:05:22.420, Speaker C: You don't get to have your voice heard, right. You only get to vote. You usually vote negatively against things that makes you look bad, right, as well. And then you're voting on boring decisions that you are not actually in any position to have an opinion on. And then people are telling you we need more participation because we need more uninformed people making really boring decisions that are going to count against them in terms of their reputation. And it's like what the hell are you guys thinking? This is a terrible system, don't do this. That's it.
00:05:23.590 - 00:05:34.358, Speaker D: So it seems like you guys definitely have some hot takes on this. I am curious if you think anybody has gotten it right so far or even close to right.
00:05:34.524 - 00:06:32.860, Speaker A: That's interesting to me. The things that come to mind as people who have gotten it right are mostly projects who have built either governance into applications and not even called it governance. I think in a way there are certainly things about Friend tech which I'm sure we'll get into, that are like mechanisms that have been built natively into the application that I don't know that I would call it governance, but they're like these building blocks that are done in a very subtle way. I think the other application that comes to mind is FWB, where they have the FWB app and they built in a governance page on the app, basically where you can look at all of the proposals that are happening. So I think one of the things for me is definitely the mechanic where you actually have these things built natively into applications as opposed to thinking explicitly about governance as this thing that people need to go do.
00:06:35.790 - 00:07:08.818, Speaker C: Well. My immediate temptation is to shell some of the use cases that people have done on Jokeray. So like WiFi putting up $400 and being like tell us a feature you want us to build. And I think that's governance. A bunch of people submitting options all prioritizing them, voting on them, seeing what their favorites are, campaigning for it, publicly performing actions to get allowed listed, building on trade, reputation, marketing it, et cetera. Rehash also comes to mind. There like just an amazing podcast that is built on users deciding what speakers they want and then getting power when they win onward.
00:07:08.818 - 00:07:54.370, Speaker C: But I think the ultra great use case of this was the Mirror Right Race two years ago. And the Mirror Right Race, if anyone remembers it was like this weekly recurring contest where people would all vy to try to get a right token which would allow them to have a publication on Mirror. And the really cool thing about this mechanism was if you won, you not only got a right token, but you got to become a voter as well. And so you got this status position as well. And so what's really cool about the Mirror Right Race is it's actually an election in disguise that's never marketed as an election. It's marketed as a contest to win a publication. But what you're doing is you're electing this council that expands over time of legitimate users deciding who else is legitimate and who else they bring in.
00:07:54.370 - 00:08:42.722, Speaker C: And so it is this progressive decentralization right where it includes more and more people over. You know, without giving too much away, I will just say there's some really cool use cases coming up on Joe Craze with some big protocols that are really looking towards that model because it's a really effective one of almost a status game of getting everyone excited to have the publication, the status and the votes. But then this really cool final thing that happens when you do that is everyone goes to social media, right? Everyone campaigns every week to be like vote for me. They're tagging each other and so you get tons of traction because it's recurring case at a set time and place. You can adjust it if anything goes wrong but you are also building the status game over time. And so I think the mirror right race is still one of those really cool phenomena that was really successful and I think we just still have a lot to learn from.
00:08:42.776 - 00:09:28.490, Speaker A: Frankly, I feel like the other call out on that in terms of almost all of those examples is like when things get interesting, is when you move beyond governance for governance sake, and you get to the point where you're actually providing value to the people who are participating in governance in some way. You're either making it really easy for them or you're providing some value optimally. You're doing a combination of those things. But I think the big delta between what we've seen and where we're going is really that function of how can we make this interesting and fun as a game first. And governance is just sort of the mechanism to do it rather than being like we need to govern this protocol and decentralize it, that is never going to end up in something that is interesting or really all that successful.
00:09:28.570 - 00:10:11.294, Speaker C: I agree with like 99% of that. But the one place I'd push back is like I don't think we should make it easier for people. I don't think it makes any sense to make it easier for people for a couple of reasons. And one is if you're doing big decisions about how do we diversify this treasury, you do not just want any rando participating, you want a hybrid entry of people have thought about this, considered it, really poured their time and energy into understanding the implications of the decision that they are making, right? But the other one is just like in terms of a game, nobody wants to play an easy game. It is not fun to play a really easy game that is easy to win. You want to play a hard game that is challenging, that raises your heart rate and that gives you anxiety that you don't know if you're going to win or not. That is what a fun game is.
00:10:11.294 - 00:10:56.030, Speaker C: And so it's always a challenge if you look at board games, like how hard do they make it because the harder you make it you get less of an audience, but you get a much more passionate audience. This is true across the arts, right? The more experimental you get, the harder it is for people to participate, but the more passionate the people are who actually do it, right? And so there is a balance I think in terms of where you want to go. Do you want to have candyland or do you want to have Twilight struggle like a twelve hour World War II game. There's different types of games that people can create but I think having a challenge generally and making it hard and that is what is fun. We all think we want complacency and none of us actually do. We're all bored by it. We want challenges.
00:10:56.370 - 00:11:53.294, Speaker A: So this is where I think we get into an interesting dynamic though, which is that my gut feeling is that we're going to have two types of governance emerge. One is passive and one is active. Where passive is to your point like Twitter the like right? Like TikTok has their own governance of your personalized feed. I think that is a version that needs to be easy and optimally. People don't even realize that they're actually governing something. When I think about a user owned internet and what that might be able to look like, I do think there's an opportunity to have governance on the back end, but these interesting very subtle dynamics on the front end that are just kind of like gauging user sentiment and stuff like that. I think on the flip side, you have this more active type of governance, which is what you're talking about, which is definitely like, yeah, you don't want to make it easy, particularly if they're types of decisions that are consequential and have real impact and I think for something like that you don't want know decide how you allocate a treasury based on the number of BOOKMARKS on a.
00:11:53.412 - 00:12:01.250, Speaker B: That seems dumb that's David on that can you explain really quick what joke race is? Because I think it plays into this whole conversation.
00:12:01.990 - 00:12:50.554, Speaker C: Probably should have done that before, you know, talking about use cases. Yeah, it's on chain contest platform and so you deploy a contest anyone can deploy contests on our site to any EVM chain. And the way it works is you put a prompt out to a community, people can submit responses, people can vote on their favorite responses and then if you want, you can add a rewards pool as well to fund the winners as well. And so what's cool is like we're tokenless which means you can actually decide you can create an allow list for who gets to submit and who gets to vote. And so you can imagine right, if you did like the traditional governance that we've always done where it's like a core team just puts a proposal to a community and lets them vote on it, then you have a very small team putting the submission out and then a whole wider community voting on it. But you can imagine, you can also do the reverse. Like a hackathon.
00:12:50.554 - 00:13:53.318, Speaker C: You have a bunch of people submitting and then just a small jury votes, right? And so we give you total modularity to be able just to design this however you want so that you can run hackathons grants, giveaways like prediction games, bounties, RFPs, et cetera, whatever really any sort of on chain decision you want to make as a community developer. Dow we're working with to do a bunch of on chain hackathons. And so you would actually have all the contributors dropping their project and there a jury votes on them. And you can imagine, even if you lose the hackathon, you're getting this on chain attestation in the form of a vote, right? And so where a lot of this gets really exciting is like the on chain reputation piece. You can imagine. I never win a contest, but I participated in so many that I've actually gotten more votes than anyone else has combined. And down the line, when people are deciding they want to do Airdrops, or they want to give access to builders, or they just want to dig into data about who their users are, that on chain reputation that you've built is really valuable to you even if you didn't win that specific contest, right? Stuff like that.
00:13:53.318 - 00:14:08.620, Speaker C: Those are good cases. Live Pure, I think, is doing like a logo contest right now to design their logo that you can participate in. CoinDesk is doing one right now to decide who the most influential people are of 2023. So submit to that one. Go Shill. That's a great Shilling opportunity.
00:14:08.990 - 00:14:39.070, Speaker B: Okay, so Joke Race is about making everything a contest. And you're talking about one of the secrets to governance is to make it fun, to make it where people want to play the game. And Chase, you mentioned Friendtech just a little bit ago, and Friendtech, it's an app that's on base. Coinbase is layer two. And Base had over 136,000 users last week because of Friend tech. It's essentially like social media network where you can trade shares based on popular Twitter figures. Chase, how does Friendtech play into this, making governance fun or implicit in the app itself?
00:14:39.240 - 00:15:22.258, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think they're definitely playing with dynamics that are a lot more like on chain assets than it is governance itself. And the way that they designed it definitely makes it hard to build in governance in this interoperable way because of the smart contracts. But I think what Frontek to me represents is a lot more of a broader strokes kind of attempt at making crypto in general fun and interesting. I think something that became very clear to me after playing around with it and seeing the reaction on crypto twitter is essentially that. And this sounds shitty, but I do think it's kind of true. We're not building addictive enough applications. If governance becomes addictive, we win, basically.
00:15:22.258 - 00:15:52.640, Speaker A: And I think there's a lot of nuance there in terms of whether or not that's actually what's good for people and all that stuff. But applications are addictive anyway. Like consumer tech is basically how addicted can you get your users and so we might as well give them power and make those things addictive in the sense that at least you're governing a platform or dynamic or whatever it is that you're governing, at least you have power. And so to me that is much more of what Frontech represents above all else.
00:15:53.330 - 00:16:14.370, Speaker C: The problem with governance is we're not making people addicted to power. If there's one thing that it should be so easy to get humans addicted to, it is power. The whole history of the world tells us you should be able to get people easily addicted to power. And the fact that we haven't even managed to do that, that just speaks to all of crypto's failings to date, basically.
00:16:14.520 - 00:17:00.510, Speaker A: And I mean to add some nuance to it as well. My philosophy has always been that you as someone who grew up on the internet, you as a user of the Internet sort of no longer, or I guess even as a person who exists in the world, sort of no longer have a choice about whether or not you want to be on the internet. Like if you go on a date, someone's going to look you up before on Instagram and if you're not on Instagram, that's going to be weird. You need to be on these platforms, you need to be on LinkedIn, in as cringe as it is if you want to have a trad job. All of these things feel very true. And so I think if we don't have the ability to exit these systems, we should at least have a voice in them. If we want to get people to the point where they can actually have a voice and this becomes effective, you need to use mechanisms that get people interested and engaged in digital spaces.
00:17:00.510 - 00:17:31.390, Speaker A: And the way that we know you can get people interested and engaged in digital spaces is by making them addictive. So I think there's definitely, again, a dark pattern here that you want to be careful about, but I think we need to start using some of these more questionable practices on the internet, actually. I think that we should explore what it might look like to ethically use some patterns that I think we've stayed very far away from as a matter of principle.
00:17:32.850 - 00:17:34.080, Speaker D: What would be an example?
00:17:37.010 - 00:18:20.650, Speaker A: What would it look like? I mean, I think Frontech is actually a great example, which is like you're buying shares in your friends on the surface kind of fucked up really. That's something that shouldn't feel awesome, but it's super fun. And I've gone back to the app way more than I'd like to admit because it's interesting and I want to check and there's something fun to that dynamic. I think we have not done a great job of experimenting with what those use cases outside of speculation might be. And I'm not saying that Printech is going to save the world, nor is it really like a movement towards a user owned Internet. But I think that we need to be more willing to experiment with that stuff. And yeah, I guess that kind of makes me a villain right now of being like, we need to do all the dark things.
00:18:20.650 - 00:18:29.870, Speaker A: But I do kind of think that we need to be more open to playing around with existing patterns on the Internet that we know work to get users engaged and excited about apps.
00:18:30.690 - 00:19:18.138, Speaker C: Chase I think you're getting at something really interesting here, which is like, soft power in the 21st century is getting people addicted to you. Say whatever you want about Elon. This is something Elon understands really well. If you get people addicted to you and you have power, right, and that's how social media works. And so there's this interesting question which is like, what happens when you have communities and collectives because there's no longer that individual figure for people to get addicted to. And what Friendtech does well is it brings back the individual figure as a character, right? And it's like, you can oppose this on a lot of ethical lines and be like, oh, no, we don't need to go back to great man history of single people who reign supreme and have relative value over each other that we've actually quantified. And that's super gross.
00:19:18.138 - 00:20:05.406, Speaker C: We need to have a collective movement. But I do think they're saying in the fact that even collective movements to succeed need to have characters and figures and relatable voices that people get really into and are excited. Like, we saw that happen with Bernie, we saw that happen with Trump in some ways, but it's like all the collective movements that we've had in crypto I don't think have done that job of narrative and storytelling and voice and character that actually gets people really excited. And so Friendtech is like kind of a shortcut to that, which is like, quantify your friends, it's hot or not with money, right? It's just like you're just ranking your friends, except this time with dollar signs in front of the number.
00:20:05.588 - 00:21:02.830, Speaker A: Yeah. And I mean, I guess the other thing to call out here is one of the reasons that I feel comfortable with us experimenting more with these ethically gray area type of things is because if you build your contracts, correctly and you actually are using Web three Rails in a way that is ethical. You can build addictive front ends with back ends that support user ownership and user empowerment and all those kinds of things. So I think the problem that you run into with Web Two is when you build really addictive applications that exploit users. I think that's the big difference here in my mind in this ecosystem, which is basically like, how can you build addictive experiences that empower users in some ways as opposed to exploiting them directly or bring them closer to a collective and help them explore a collective identity in a way that's really interesting and lightly addictive?
00:21:04.530 - 00:21:39.002, Speaker C: Chase, I want to join you in your villain era. Can't leave you alone. You know, something I think a lot about with games, when we talk about gamification is like good games are safe spaces for chaos and violence. And so when you play a game that's really enjoyable, you want to kill your friends, you want to destroy them, you want to beat them. Right. Often, depending on the video game, it could be like a really violent way too. Right? And these are safe spaces for us to enact a lot of our own, our ID in some ways.
00:21:39.002 - 00:22:25.514, Speaker C: And it's like the irony of all this is that action is what brings us together. As long as it's within a safe space where we know it's a game and we know there's a framework for it, at the end of that game, we're closer to each other, like we have bonded with each other through that act. Right? And so I think there's a lot to be said where it's like, can we embrace these kind of idlike, chaotic behaviors in a safe space that overall then actually brings us together and creates more of a collective unity, right. The way that a good board game will do. And I think it's like we are instead trying to live where the games we play are following our own ideals of collective joint support. And that's not really that fun. It's more fun when you're competing, it's more fun when there's a challenge, it's more fun when you want to beat your friends and you're standing up against each other.
00:22:25.514 - 00:22:45.678, Speaker C: Right? And so I think there is a lot to be said for creating those kinds of dynamics. It gets a little scary to me when you bring in money once you're financializing that that's maybe an element that I'm not so sure personally that's a safe space anymore. But yeah, I'm otherwise happy to go full villain with you. Chase.
00:22:45.854 - 00:23:33.138, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the money thing is a very good call out. That is the interesting thing about money in general, which your piece that you published a while ago, I think demonstrates really well, which is that money makes everything become real for people. And so it no know, we can go and play Katan and that's all fine until the resources that I gather in Katan could be taken to coinbase and traded for real money and I can go buy my own house. And that certainly changes the dynamics, which is why I think also one of the most important things that we can be doing in terms of governance and consumer crypto is trying to experiment with what does it look like? To not just play speculation games. And can we use this technology for consumer apps that are not solely based on the financialization of your friends? Which is definitely a big question mark.
00:23:33.304 - 00:23:41.602, Speaker C: I'm actually collateralizing my sheep right now and using that to buy a bunch of friends. I don't know what you're talking about.
00:23:41.656 - 00:23:42.530, Speaker A: Incredible.
00:23:42.870 - 00:23:43.620, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:23:47.670 - 00:23:56.934, Speaker B: Everyone, we'll get back to the show in a minute, but I want to let you know that we've got our permissionless conference coming up. Start conference with Bankless. That's the biggest and best conference in DFI. It's going to be in Austin, Texas, this year.
00:23:56.972 - 00:23:57.266, Speaker C: Yep.
00:23:57.298 - 00:24:27.062, Speaker B: I know you love it. They Got Tacos barbecue Barton Springs We got it all September 11 through the 13th. If you've been in crypto for a while, know that the bear market conferences are the best conferences because those are the ones where all the outfits had the people that are still in crypto all really want to be there. It's going to be great for building a network, for learning a lot. And look, we've got a phenomenal lineup of speakers that include people like Hasu Sanni, Christine Moy, and Kyle Simani talking about ZK tech roll ups, account abstraction, mev app chains, and more. Look, I'm damn excited because you're a listener of Lightspeed. You're going to get a special discount.
00:24:27.062 - 00:24:41.640, Speaker B: Type in discount code, Lightspeed 30, and you'll get 30% off your ticket. That's right. Just type in Lightspeed 30 when buying a permissionless ticket and get 30% off. Click the link at the bottom of this episode and go get it now because prices are going up every two weeks. All right, back to the show.
00:24:45.290 - 00:24:57.878, Speaker D: You guys just kind of pointed out a bunch of things that we should be doing that we could be doing that you think might make more sense. I guess I'm curious in an industry where I don't know, I don't want to say the rules are blurry, but I mean, they are blurry.
00:24:58.054 - 00:24:59.450, Speaker C: Yeah, they're pretty blurry.
00:24:59.870 - 00:25:09.760, Speaker D: Why haven't we gotten this right? Is it the hyper financialization aspect that slowed us down? It seems like it would be an obvious fit, but it hasn't worked so far. Why not.
00:25:13.190 - 00:25:44.330, Speaker C: Dude? Building consumer apps in crypto is hard, man. It's really challenging. It's like a short long game. It's like long term on chain reputation, on chain data. Totally beats any sort of webtooth silo system. Like your ability to have an interoperable identity that will win you access and rewards and opportunities and that you can control and attest to. That is a game changer for advertising, that's a game changer for users monetizing, that's a game changer for job opportunities.
00:25:44.330 - 00:26:24.598, Speaker C: It wins. But the problem is there's still so much less data in Web three, especially because all the data to date. Has basically been financial and there's been no social data developed compared to even just APIs you can pull from web two platforms. And so that transition is really hard. And it's really hard to make that long term case for data when web two data is currently better than web three data. And so I think without that, then you're stuck with, well, the US sucks. You have to have these terrible wallets, you have to pay gas fees for everything, you have to connect to a chain, right? And you have all these challenges just on the UX side.
00:26:24.598 - 00:27:02.306, Speaker C: And the other thing is, until the past year, it wasn't financially doable. You couldn't pay to do any of this stuff. Even now, on Joke Race, if you set up a contest at Mainet Ethereum, which we let you do, it's $200 to deploy it and it's like $40 to submit it, right, versus like on the roll ups, it's like two cent to submit. And so it's like even now when we say, oh, there's gas, people are like, oh, I don't know if anyone's going to be able to afford that. And it's like, well, no, it's two cent, it's not $20. Things have changed, but it's still a totally new paradigm to actually work within a system that is affordable, never mind. Ecdu's I'm curious to see what you.
00:27:02.328 - 00:27:20.840, Speaker B: Think as well, because you have a Tweet out there I thought was funny. And you said that crypto conferences have better product market fit than any crypto product out there, which I tend to agree with. And you said one of the reasons for that is also because our focus on pure decentralization. Do you really think that's what's holding us back or what is it?
00:27:21.370 - 00:28:01.814, Speaker A: I think a lot of this is kind of like a combination of two things. One is a death by a thousand cuts, which is what David, I think is getting at in a lot of ways, where it's like, it's expensive. Onboarding people onto a wallet is a pain in the ass. You need to decide if you want to custody their keys or if you want your users to custody their keys. There are all of these questions that I think up until recently have been just huge pains in the ass. I think we're finally getting to a point. And again, I think Frontech is an interesting example of this just because it's a recent thing where it's not an application, so it doesn't have to go through Apple, it's using Base, so the fees are really low.
00:28:01.814 - 00:29:00.150, Speaker A: Like, all of these specific things I think, enable this potentially. Like, I'm not going to say Cambrian explosion of consumer applications, but I do think that we're going to see a lot more. I think what that unlocks, which is the other piece that I think we've been missing, is the ability to just experiment and see what works in the traditional consumer tech world. The whole name of the game is just throwing shit at the wall and seeing what works and seeing how users engage with it. That's really hard to do when you're dealing with all of these random things that are just going to cause friction, including things like gas, but also onboarding onto a wallet. And so my hope is that as we start to fix those holes in the boat, we could basically start to actually do a bunch of experiments and just see what works. And the other thing I'll call out is, up until now, it never made sense for users to spend a bunch of time or money setting up a wallet or paying gas unless they had a significant confidence in the ROI on that time and money.
00:29:00.150 - 00:29:21.370, Speaker A: Meaning that speculative games have always been the thing that made sense to invest user time and money into. And so my hope is that the other side of this is not just experimenting on the project side with applications, but also that as we reduce the barriers to entry there, we start to see new types of use cases that are not only centered around speculation.
00:29:21.450 - 00:30:12.970, Speaker C: It's one other thing. That point that's worth making here too is technology comes in waves, right? And you look at what are the major apps that have been developed in the past ten years, it's really TikTok and maybe Chat GPT and that's it. Every major app that we know that's out there was basically built like over ten years ago. I actually think that's a reason to be optimistic that there's going to be a whole new wave of kind of crypto apps that are enabled. I think this stuff comes in cycles and I'm working on a piece right now on Chat GPT and why I think it's kind of a game changer for what apps look like as well, including the fact that it's web based as are the big apps that have now launched on crypto, beam and Friendtech as well. And so I do think we're looking at paradigm shifts right now that are going to be huge. I think we're at the very beginning of a new wave just of apps generally as technology is shifting.
00:30:12.970 - 00:30:29.506, Speaker C: But yeah, consumer preferences are pretty entrenched and it's like you have Be Real and Clubhouse come along every two years and people get excited for four months and then they turn out to be novelties. Right. The ability of anyone to develop a compelling app has been really limited in the past ten years.
00:30:29.608 - 00:30:48.570, Speaker B: Yeah, it sounds like identity would be a big part of this because you're talking about you had the next bull cycle, you have like three things that need to happen. One of them is that, well maybe not the next bull cycle, but like a huge bull cycle is to actually have more data on chain like you're talking about. For Advertisers and Chase, you had something interesting when you were talking about wallets or not payment apps, but they're identity apps.
00:30:49.150 - 00:30:49.610, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:30:49.680 - 00:30:58.922, Speaker B: How do you guys think about on chain identity? Do you think that's something that needs to be decentralized? Do you think it's fine if Coinbase comes out with something and how that can enable new identity?
00:30:58.986 - 00:30:59.310, Speaker C: Really?
00:30:59.380 - 00:31:01.566, Speaker B: Is that something that's holding us mean?
00:31:01.588 - 00:31:33.354, Speaker C: I think it's a crucial unlock. Let's take a contest. Let's say you do a contest that's like what was your know, song you listened to this week? And community comes together and they all vote on what their favorite song was that they listened to this week, right? You have some sort of AI bot. You could actually figure out what users preferences are overall map to their wallet address. That then enables all sorts of targeting, right? Et cetera, maybe give them new offers and opportunities. But forget that. Say you're using data that has no idea what the actual content of this contest was.
00:31:33.354 - 00:32:05.086, Speaker C: You can still look and see, okay? People tend to vote on the same things over and over every week, right? And so now you have a social graph that these people's tastes are very aligned. Maybe they should know each other, maybe they should date each other. That basis for a social app is just so powerful. Once you have those kinds of tastes exposed, you have the fact that it's like whatever's getting voted on, this person wins every week. They have really popular taste. They really understand the zeitgeist. They are popular within this community and what they say is very important to listen to, right? You have that data because every vote is an attestation.
00:32:05.086 - 00:32:46.782, Speaker C: You have the whole transaction histories. You take those two people that voted on the same thing over and over each week. It's like you can dig into one of their profiles, see all the NFTs they hold. Now you know a lot about them that might also indicate the preferences of the other user as well. And so then the challenge becomes, okay, well, how do we put this on the user side? Like, how does the user have right to protect this data? Monetize it, sell it, expose it when they want to. And that's where you really get into probably ZK tech stuff. But it's really exciting to think about all the social graphs that can come out of just like one contest, right? And so that's all identity and it's like, never mind the fact that, oh yeah, this user, we did this marketing campaign of what feature you want us to build? And this person keeps winning every month.
00:32:46.782 - 00:33:22.122, Speaker C: It's like, maybe we should hire them. They're really good, they have great ideas. Maybe someone else should hire them, maybe someone else should do an AirDrop to them because they're a valuable builder. Developing this kind of like qualitative information about how the value you provide to communities is a total unlock from the very rote identity data analytics that we've had so far. Which has just been how much liquidity have you provided? That's the only information we've had. All we've been able to determine an identity to date is are you rich or not? Because we've only had financial use cases. And so it's just this incredible flywheel that the more social data you generate, the more you can then feed that back in, right.
00:33:22.122 - 00:33:57.320, Speaker C: To be like, okay, now let's develop our next contest, giving Extra Power allow list to those people who have provided a lot of value to and you can start to create these really incredible flywheels where you develop power over time in these status games, in these financial games. Just in these social games. Right, too. And so it's just trying to get that flywheel to unlock. And once it does, I think that's where we're going to see the whole kind of ecosystem shift. And I do feel like as much as I am really skeptical, I have a lot of issues with friend tech. It does feel like it's the beginning of something new there.
00:33:58.430 - 00:34:00.860, Speaker D: What are some of those issues that you're skeptical of?
00:34:02.510 - 00:34:03.882, Speaker C: Financializing your friends?
00:34:04.016 - 00:34:07.050, Speaker D: Yeah, just the dark patterns.
00:34:07.630 - 00:34:49.302, Speaker C: Yeah. I think, again, our idea that there's a universal metric, first of all, it's not a relative local metric, but a universal metric for reputation and value is really dangerous. And then for that to be a financial value is pretty dark and it's just popularity is what it comes down to. And so, yeah, I really believe value needs to be local and relative my value to my closest friends is very different from my value to my enemies right. Or to the people who don't know who I am. And it's like Web Two has just trained us over and over again to think that the more followers you have, the bigger your numbers are, the more popular you are. And that's actually not true.
00:34:49.302 - 00:35:18.900, Speaker C: You look at the most popular people on Twitter, they're not the ones with 100,000 followers, they're the ones with 5000 followers where all 5000 of them think that person is a god. Right. Look at like Shiram from Eigen layer or something. He doesn't have hundreds of thousands of followers, but everyone who follows Shuram knows how valuable that guy is. Right. It's like playing these quantity games of just like and then reducing that to money is just so I don't know, I think it's just so simple minded as a system of describing value and yeah, I think it's a little dark too.
00:35:20.790 - 00:36:12.450, Speaker A: I think in general that also gets at like this idea of having a single metric for your identity or value or whatever is certainly problematic. And I think the idea that this points towards a more localized and contextualized identity and maybe even set of social spaces makes a ton of sense. I think. To me, the thing that I've been thinking about in the identity space is the whole thread situation where Instagram launched Facebook launched Threads. They also own you. Your initial social network on Threads was seeded basically through Instagram. The thing that that taught me was that I do not want the people who I follow and who follow me on Instagram to engage with me in a text based app that looks like Twitter.
00:36:12.450 - 00:36:34.426, Speaker A: And so I think your point, David, and that experience both point towards this idea that identity needs to be contextual and that who I am on this podcast is not who I am when I'm joking with David about whatever and that matters. And so there's a lot more dick jokes going on when David and I are one on one and I'm not.
00:36:34.448 - 00:36:35.734, Speaker C: Really making on the podcast.
00:36:35.862 - 00:37:46.866, Speaker A: And so I think that type of thing really matters in the context of how we design these systems because composability and interoperability of identity across different platforms is kind of a double edged sword in that way. I don't think that we have fully had experiences yet where that comes to fruition because we haven't had as many consumer apps take off and so much of these things has already been financialized. So it's like the financial lens is the way that we primarily see users in crypto today and most applications have supported that thus far. Once we get into these use cases that are not so financial, I think that's where things start to become really strange and people will start to feel a lot more uncomfortable with the fact that their entire financial history is also associated with these much more intimate parts of their digital lives. And so I think on the identity side, I don't know what that will end up looking like. I totally agree with you, David, in terms of where you see things going with zero knowledge proofs and all that stuff. But yeah, I think contextualizing identity and the ability for users to control what is shared in what contexts and in what applications and with who is something that people say all the time.
00:37:46.866 - 00:37:53.860, Speaker A: But that, I think from a purely human centric perspective also feels like it matters a lot moving forward.
00:37:57.210 - 00:38:36.100, Speaker D: While we're on the topic of identity, one interesting thing that crypto enables is kind of identity over owning a certain coin, right? So maybe you are a bitcoin maximalist ethereum, Solana, Cosmos, whatever it might be, which seems to be different from kind of other industries. How do you guys think about kind of the tribalism between these different identities, between the different blockchains? Or what do you think we've gotten wrong there? How should we improve upon our tribalism and stop shitting on each other all the time?
00:38:36.550 - 00:38:39.060, Speaker C: Wait, can I ask your take on it?
00:38:41.590 - 00:39:18.560, Speaker D: My take on it is that I think each chain kind of has different values that emanate from its history and technical choices. So like Bitcoin, obviously you have Satoshi and the store of value kind of meme on Ethereum. You kind of have credible neutrality, ultrasound money now and kind of scaling via roll ups and being ethereum aligned as well. And then on solana, maybe you have something that's a bit more like we care about products and UX and.
00:39:21.170 - 00:39:21.534, Speaker C: Of.
00:39:21.572 - 00:40:15.490, Speaker D: I think probably what everybody kind of misses is those things obviously have some overlap, but they're fundamentally different goals to shoot for. Some of these things, even if they're possible on all three chains, just make much more sense on one of those chains. I don't want to hold high value NFTs on something that's not ethereum. Personally. I'm just going to prefer that better because I think it's a better settlement layer. On the other hand, if I want fast execution, sensor resistance, and information propagation, let's say, which is a very niche thing, but let's say I'm a trader and I want that, then I'm probably going to use solana. And I think the problem arises when people try to when the financialization aspect kind of occurs, because they think that if chain x gets more stuff built on their chain, then maybe the price of my coin will go down and that'll hurt my identity.
00:40:15.490 - 00:40:19.140, Speaker D: But I'm curious what you guys think.
00:40:20.230 - 00:41:12.130, Speaker C: I think it hurts the identity of the people who formed their identity around shilling tokens. So the loudest voices online are the people who are shilling the loudest for their bags, but those aren't necessarily the majority of bag holders. Right? And so I do think there's a question of like, yeah, those people are engaged in a tribal war against each other to try to prove themselves because their entire identity is based on them being right about a token price. But I don't know that that's true for the majority of solana holders or ethereum holders or bitcoin. Bitcoin it probably is, but for solana and ethereum, right. This idea that your ideology is based on what you bought, it's just an extension of 20th century consumerism to its kind of like, endpoint. I think it's a pretty nihilistic endpoint, which is like, you are what you buy and you're no longer buying a thing, you're just buying money itself.
00:41:12.130 - 00:41:50.586, Speaker C: And the money that you buy is now your identity. This is very dark and very dumb, but I also don't think it's the majority of holders. I think people buy this because they actually think it's a good investment because they like the technology, not because they believe that their own identity is based on it. So I think we skew a little bit because the social media voices that win are the ones that are most tribal and the shilliest often as well. But yeah, I know a lot of people who hold both ETH and solana and like both those projects, as do I. Personally, I hold both those tokens and I love them. Uh, so maybe I'm projecting.
00:41:50.586 - 00:42:32.542, Speaker C: I don't think there's a need to choose. I think it's exactly what you like. These are different use cases for different purposes. And yeah, one doing really well creates a great opportunity for another to do well. I mean, the funniest place you see this is with the roll ups where it's like now all the roll ups are going through their own wars with each other and it's like, honestly, if one of these roll ups does super well, its gas prices are going to spike, right? It's going to get really expensive and it's going to create a great opportunity for everyone to go to another roll up. All these roll ups, the more that there are, the cheaper they're making block space and the more opportunity they're creating for each other. And there's a lot of ways that I think they all actually are working together in creating a really great roll up world, but they're not positioning themselves that way.
00:42:32.542 - 00:42:36.110, Speaker C: They're positioning themselves in this tribal war because that's what gets attention.
00:42:37.890 - 00:43:18.710, Speaker D: One thing I'd say that's so I have two questions. One is I kind of like the example you just gave actually just kind of thinking out loud. If like a roll up got really popular and then the gas fee spiked, that would presumably mean that people might get to another roll up and it's an opportunity for that roll up. I'm going to push back on that a little bit just because I'm not sure I've seen it happen. I'm not sure I've seen it happen that much in crypto. It seems like maybe once there's congestion on a network, they'll kind of just keep wanting to use that network because they kind of feel at home there. And it's maybe not as utilitarian as just going to another chain.
00:43:18.710 - 00:43:42.114, Speaker D: At least this is kind of speaking from experience. Like when ETH gas fees spiked, people would still stay on ETH and then would justify it in some way. Like, this just means there's a lot of value going to secure it as opposed to maybe I'll just of course some people moved over, but not everybody. So I'm curious on maybe the extreme edge case there of why aren't those people moving over? Or in your words, why do you think that is?
00:43:42.152 - 00:44:25.138, Speaker C: Well, I mean, interoperability with roll ups is just a lot easier than interoperability between ETH. And, you know, it's very easy to bridge from one roll up to the other. It's not very easy to bridge from Ethereum to know when I say very easy, I mean relative bridging still. You know, I do think because you're in the Ethereum ecosystem, there will be that opportunity to stay there. But honestly, I do think Ethereum's gas prices spiking was great for Salana. A lot of the salana narrative is really based on the inefficiencies of Ethereum in 2021 and just watching Ethereum play out and being like, there's no way this is going to work. This cannot possibly be the future of what blockchains look like.
00:44:25.138 - 00:44:37.160, Speaker C: $100 to buy an NFT just for the gas fee alone. Salana looked really great in that context too. So I do think it actually drove a lot of people there, including me.
00:44:38.250 - 00:45:11.390, Speaker D: Cool. And then the second part of the question, which completely going to be offside, or maybe not that related, which you guys kind of both mentioned the distinction between exit and voice so far in this podcast, which kind of brings me to Balaji and maybe some of his work on network states and communities. How do you guys because you thought a lot about governance communities, whatnot how do you guys think about kind of the network state framework?
00:45:13.110 - 00:46:02.734, Speaker A: Such a loaded question. I had a very interesting podcast episode that I'll send you guys to link in the show notes that's basically, like, there are a lot of problems with the network state. The Blockchain Socialist was who came on the show to talk about it, and he's done a ton of really great writing and podcast episodes on his own podcast about this. I think that I'm very much aligned with his approach on a lot of that stuff, which is basically like the underlying reasoning behind why the network state might be interesting. I e like, nation states are failing us. These things are not necessarily designed for the digital spaces that we spend so much of our time in. I agree with and makes a ton of sense in terms of biology's principles, of why we've gotten to the point where we need something new.
00:46:02.734 - 00:47:11.990, Speaker A: I think the actual implementation that the network state suggests, and this is very much what the Blockchain Socialist argues is problematic in a ton of different ways and probably doesn't work. And so I think the general sentiment around the need for it is a yes, the details on how we do these things needs a lot of reworking. And I think that the problem that you run into around a lot of that narrative is just like kind of adopting what Balogy says at face value when it comes to how these things actually get built. So I'm very skeptical of the acquisition of pieces of physical land of a bunch of people who are rich in Internet money deciding to kind of colonize different areas of the world. Also, the sort of one commandment type governance makes very little sense. We know that polycentric governance is a much better way to run especially highly complex human systems. So I think there's a lot of revisiting, which is exciting because that's also where this work happens.
00:47:11.990 - 00:47:28.758, Speaker A: That's where I think a lot of the innovation of crypto steps in is like, how do we rethink governance for a digital and physical space and how can we do it in a way that just makes a ton more sense from what we have right now? David, I'm curious to hear your thoughts.
00:47:28.934 - 00:47:30.700, Speaker C: Oh, no. Do I have to do this?
00:47:31.390 - 00:47:36.240, Speaker A: Yes. Do you have to publicly say that you love Balaji's network state?
00:47:36.690 - 00:48:26.814, Speaker C: I love it so much? No, I think you encapsulated my thoughts pretty perfectly, which is like the theory of digital statehood is really exciting because it enables these things like forking and opt in systems that you have never had in physical terrains, and also being able to be part of multiple states at once, right? The fact that you can choose to participate in multiple networks, right, that you can just permissionlessly fork it and build social consensus and that's not a violent act of a Confederate war. That's just you expressing a different digital preference and seeing if you can build social consensus around it. All of that is really exciting. And it's really exciting because it can't be done in physical states. Physical states are scarce by definition. They are not abundant. They are not able to endlessly be created and opted into.
00:48:26.814 - 00:49:27.620, Speaker C: You are trapped within a specific locality. And so there's this kind of like sleight of hand with a lot of Balaji's writing where he takes the ideals of a digital network and then applies them to a physical network, where actually those ideals, I don't think, you know, there's a lot of hand waving about. Oh yeah, you just get the UN to approve your state and it's like, how easy is that to do, to get the UN to approve your state? And you look at the motivation behind it and it is a question of know. The point of all of this should be, in some ways, to get out of tribalism towards being able to be members of multiple tribes, opt into whatever you want and let other people opt into their system. But instead you're getting the system that's very much based on rich people congregating together in order to protect their own interests by colonizing land. And that seems fairly terrifying to me personally. And I know people are excited by this because the return on investment of a state is pretty huge.
00:49:27.620 - 00:49:59.610, Speaker C: I do think as much as I lean in many ways towards anti regulation, so much innovation historically has been funded by governments over and over again. All Silicon Valley was funded by governments. Technology in the 20th century is funded. So having strong governments matter, having governments that we opt into matters. But I think the kind of solutions that they're coming up with to just get a bunch of rich people together and take over a bunch of land, I don't know. I struggle with this one personally.
00:50:00.990 - 00:50:45.322, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm really curious, where do you think crypto is going to push things? Because crypto to me has a network effect in almost applications, protocols, et cetera. And when you're talking about nation states, part of that also makes me think of like Cosmos app chains. And you have this long app chains and most of them have no activity on them right now. Now, in the future they might. But I'm curious if you also think it might just lead to a barbell effect where it's almost like the 90 ten, where you have a few protocols or ethereum different ecosystems that maybe capture 90% value and then you have a lot of others, but it also pushes out the middle. And I think about this in media as well. So you have someone like Ben Thompson who is his own business, his own rider, and he's doing great, right? And that's actually been enabled by technology, by PayPal or Stripe, and that's something that maybe crypto could do as well.
00:50:45.322 - 00:50:54.800, Speaker B: But all the local and regional, like, they kind of lost their business to Ben Thompson and then you have the Wall Street Journal. So I'm just curious, do you see that playing out in crypto as well?
00:51:02.620 - 00:51:40.912, Speaker C: Good question. Yeah, hopefully not. Hopefully digital abundance means that everyone is able to develop their own platform in voice. We are already at a state within society where the local writers do not have centralized backers that they can go to. The only option is to write online. And will you face that creator economy problem that 90% of creators don't have any views, are not getting any audience, not building social consensus? Yes. I think, Garrett, what you're getting at is that creating a blockchain is basically the next extension of the creator economy.
00:51:40.912 - 00:52:04.220, Speaker C: You're creating a culture and you're trying to get people excited around it, right? And it's like, ultimately, Solana wins, not based on the technology, but based on a bunch of people getting excited by it, right. And sharing it with each other and wanting to use it. It's around culture, right, that you win. And so the same thing is going to be true for all these blockchains that spread up. But I do think there's a way where you look at 90% of them failing. That's a very good thing. That means that you've enabled tons of experimentation.
00:52:04.220 - 00:52:44.808, Speaker C: You've been able to try every version of it. It's like evolution. You want to be able to maximize for diversity, right? And so being able to see that anyone was able to try this and even if they didn't build social consensus, they were able to at least go out and do this thing and see what happened and get the data from that. It's not such a terrible thing. I think it is. If everyone's livelihood depends on this, right? If everyone's like, we live in an economic system where the only way to make money is to launch a roll up, then this gets scary. But as long as we have some sort of economic protection in place where we can try this stuff as experiments, then it's a really beautiful thing if a lot of stuff fails, because that's how you learn.
00:52:44.808 - 00:52:48.590, Speaker C: And that means that we really gave the chance to everyone to experiment too.
00:52:49.200 - 00:53:35.304, Speaker A: I also think over the next few years, we're probably going to start to see, especially as crypto consumer applications hopefully take off. I think we'll start to see which. Parts of the stack make sense as these shared pieces of infrastructure and which parts of applications are going to just make a lot more sense for teams to build their own infrastructure and own their own infrastructure. And I think that is not really a dynamic that we have a ton of conviction on yet. I think we've learned that it seems like Ethereum as a settlement layer makes sense. Awesome. I think moving forward there's going to be a lot of experimentation and failure of teams who either want to pull in other tooling, but realize it makes more sense to build their own.
00:53:35.304 - 00:53:55.328, Speaker A: On the flip side, there will also be teams who build all of their own stuff throughout the entire stack, basically, and end up realizing like, this made no sense. So I think from a sort of centralization of decentralized infrastructure perspective as well, this is something that I think is going to shake out over the next few years.
00:53:55.494 - 00:54:28.970, Speaker B: I think somehow this ties in on what you're doing with Metropolis to me to some degree. Because one thing that's made the Internet really accessible is when you have like a thousand websites, but also things like PayPal made it where all these websites can actually charge for things because people trust being able to put their credit card information in and buying something. And something that you're doing in Metropolis right now is you have a tool, I think, to see permissions on contracts, right? So you can see if it's a multi SIG, if it's a three or four, et cetera. And it feels like maybe to enable this. Why consumer adoption? Also experimentation. You need to have more products like that. And it seems like is that like a core thesis that you guys hold?
00:54:29.500 - 00:55:10.170, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think what we've started to see is the emergence of a ton of different types of users. You have people who are highly technical and are going to go straight to Etherscan to look at contracts. You have people who want a more accessible interface but are still checking the chain, and then you have people who don't give a fuck about any of that stuff and just want to buy shares of their friends. And I think we've been doing a lot of thinking on the people in the middle there. I think the on chain literacy that we've seen in the space thus far has, I think, actually grown over, like with tools like Dune. I think we're seeing a lot more people. I mean, even Blockworks has a ton of people who do incredible research.
00:55:10.170 - 00:56:00.968, Speaker A: And so I think we're getting a lot closer to making these things more accessible and making it easier for people who might skew more towards the I don't give a fuck but are now able to verify what types of contracts they're using and what the interactions between those contracts are. I think especially as we move into this consumer phase, what's going to be super important is not necessarily like auditing contracts on etherscan, but being able to verify that you aren't going to get totally screwed by contracts either. And so I think this type of tooling is going to be super important in the context of saying, okay, how can we teach users, again, trust but verify, to push this sort of like on chain mechanic that frankly, we haven't seen before. It hasn't been possible for you to check the chain when you're paying someone's PayPal. So I think building more of this type of tooling is going to be super important.
00:56:01.134 - 00:56:16.940, Speaker D: Before I do rapid fire, I just want to ask one question that I saw, or ask your take on a Tweet that I saw from you that I thought was interesting. You said on July 19, you cannot L Two your way to PMF. What does this mean? Can you expand?
00:56:17.520 - 00:57:10.012, Speaker A: Yeah, I had some people who were like, this is a terrible take, and some people who are like, this is a great take. And by the way, I wasn't subtweeting anyone in particular. I think that the thing there for me is just that I think that what we've seen is a lot of times applications or projects that have struggled to get traction have kind of fallen back on the idea of being like, well, gas fees are just expensive and it's really hard to onboard people. Which is true. Again, to the point about a death by 1000 cuts and being able to experiment with this stuff, I do think that makes a big impact. I would really love for people to avoid immediately defaulting to going a layer deeper in infrastructure because they couldn't find consumer traction. And I think that's kind of what I'm getting at there, which is like, there is an appeal to being like, well, this didn't work.
00:57:10.012 - 00:57:42.804, Speaker A: Let's just launch an L two. And there's value in that. I think having a ton of L Two S is going to be great. I'm excited about that, but I just think it's a very easy thing to fall back on rather than looking more critically at why whatever it is that you were doing did not work. And then I also just think that everyone's going to be launching L two S and everyone's going to be competing for that, basically demand for block space. And I don't think that that is necessarily the perfect solution to getting to PMF. There's a lot of layers to unpacking.
00:57:42.932 - 00:57:45.716, Speaker C: Icoing. Is the proper is the proper solution.
00:57:45.908 - 00:57:50.830, Speaker A: Of course, to PMF launch tokens, not change. Let people speculate on you.
00:57:52.480 - 00:57:59.884, Speaker B: When you said that, it reminded me of a life coach that essentially you couldn't figure out what you wanted to do in life. So instead you go down a layer and you become the life coach, then.
00:57:59.922 - 00:58:01.904, Speaker C: Tell other people what to do 1000%.
00:58:01.942 - 00:58:44.860, Speaker A: And there's nothing wrong with doing that, but it's like, we still need people who are actually doing things that are not building infrastructure. So, yeah, I want to be wary of that. And to be clear, I'm super excited about the potential for app chains and app specific roll ups. And I think there's a lot of excitement, at least in my head, in terms of what that means for consumers. I just want to be wary of people or projects who have not reached any degree of consumer PMF being like, well, we're just going to do the infrastructure instead, because we end up in the same thing that we've gotten to already, which is just like, the incentives make a ton of sense to do that. And it also means that we don't actually make any real meaningful progress towards mainstream adoption.
00:58:46.080 - 00:58:56.204, Speaker C: Yeah. In 2021, you were a Dow. In 2022. You're an NFT. In 2023, you're a chain. Right. And you're just like, yeah, joke Dow, joke NFTs joke chain.
00:58:56.204 - 00:59:01.010, Speaker C: We're just going to keep pivoting with the times and trying to design guys.
00:59:01.700 - 00:59:17.290, Speaker A: Yes. If you don't anticipate sufficient demand for your roll up because your app is really killing it, perhaps consider whether or not you should be launching a roll up for your that's that's kind of, I think, the dynamic there.
00:59:18.620 - 00:59:19.156, Speaker B: Swallow.
00:59:19.188 - 00:59:19.624, Speaker C: Put.
00:59:19.742 - 00:59:21.690, Speaker B: Mert. Do you want to go into the rapid fire?
00:59:22.060 - 00:59:34.636, Speaker D: Sure. Okay, I'm going to keep this short. Just going to ask some rapid fire questions. Try to keep it brief, lizard brain. But if you want to expand, go ahead, of course. And we'll just go with David and then Chase in order every time.
00:59:34.818 - 00:59:35.550, Speaker C: Cool.
00:59:36.160 - 00:59:37.070, Speaker D: All right.
00:59:38.020 - 00:59:39.040, Speaker B: Get nervous.
00:59:39.620 - 00:59:41.036, Speaker D: It's just round robin.
00:59:41.148 - 00:59:43.170, Speaker C: I already am, don't worry. Yes.
00:59:45.540 - 00:59:47.760, Speaker D: Your three favorite crypto apps?
00:59:49.140 - 00:59:57.924, Speaker C: None. I don't have any favorite crypto apps. Yeah. Joke, race. Joke, race. Joke and race. There we go.
00:59:57.924 - 00:59:58.976, Speaker C: Nice. Chase.
00:59:59.168 - 01:00:29.056, Speaker A: Damn. I like Twitter, which is not a crypto app, but I think that's one. I actually love using DeFi like ave. I know, that's so boring because it's basically saying a savings account, but there is something exciting about being able to earn ETH on top of my ETH. That just feels good and it feels like a real use case that actually makes sense. So I'm not going to give you three, but I'll give you two. Yeah.
01:00:29.056 - 01:00:30.370, Speaker A: Uniswap is also.
01:00:32.820 - 01:00:35.810, Speaker C: It feels good to beautiful app. Yeah.
01:00:36.660 - 01:00:40.320, Speaker D: How would you explain what a Dow is to your parents?
01:00:43.940 - 01:01:02.090, Speaker C: It's when you give up all of your money and decision making to a bunch of random people who are buying a thing called your token that you actually don't get any money for either, because it's all secondaries. How's that?
01:01:03.500 - 01:01:06.040, Speaker A: Incredible. You're a great salesman, David.
01:01:06.860 - 01:01:08.750, Speaker C: Everyone want to join the down out?
01:01:09.440 - 01:01:14.344, Speaker A: Mine is just user controlled, user owned Internet. User owned digital spaces.
01:01:14.472 - 01:01:16.524, Speaker C: You're going with the positive? The positive one, yeah.
01:01:16.562 - 01:01:20.640, Speaker A: Okay. I'm going with the Cope. I like that we're going full Cope.
01:01:21.540 - 01:01:25.200, Speaker D: What's a community that you wish existed in crypto.
01:01:28.500 - 01:01:52.580, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay, quick rant. We're talking a lot about these network states, and it's like the thing they have in common is it's like we're talking about digital sovereignty, but in practice, it's a bunch of rich people going to land. That's not where the opportunity is for crypto. The average community for crypto, we know this is the Unbanked. It's all the people around the world who don't have access to an international finance system. And we've finally created an international finance system that can be inclusive and include everyone around the world with Internet.
01:01:52.580 - 01:02:30.212, Speaker C: And the idea that you now want to split that off and just take over a small piece of land with a bunch of rich people, this is what I think the bullcase is for Solana. Solana is the international chain, right? The one that doesn't know boundaries and can include everyone. I would like to see communities of Unbanked people who are actually able to pull resources together to support each other. I think Gia is, like, a really great project working on, but yeah, like, I'm much more interested in the opportunity both in terms of the chain, but also in terms of the people who don't have access to this than the people who have the most access and them getting to use it just for their own sake as well. There we go.
01:02:30.266 - 01:02:34.344, Speaker A: Chase big plus one. Can't follow that up, so I'll plus one.
01:02:34.382 - 01:02:36.408, Speaker C: It all right.
01:02:36.494 - 01:02:38.872, Speaker A: Which is the laziest answer. Sorry.
01:02:38.926 - 01:02:44.280, Speaker D: No, it's a great answer. What is your most unpopular take in crypto?
01:02:47.180 - 01:03:09.410, Speaker A: Mine is probably this addictive thing, which I'll say there's a lot of nuance to it. I don't think we should make everything addictive. I definitely don't think we should financialize the shit out of everything we're doing. But right now, I do think that we need to be making more trade offs than we've been willing to make in the past to actually experiment and understand what works.
01:03:11.640 - 01:03:16.500, Speaker C: Mine is probably that buying tokens was a distraction from the actual use cases of blockchains.
01:03:18.040 - 01:03:29.960, Speaker D: That is a hot take. Nice. What is one thing that you wish everybody listening to this would take away from governance? What do you want to drill into people's heads about? Governance?
01:03:30.940 - 01:03:32.280, Speaker C: Needs to be hornier.
01:03:32.620 - 01:03:34.520, Speaker D: Chase yeah, hornier.
01:03:35.420 - 01:03:49.490, Speaker A: It needs to be hornier. It needs to be the feature, not the product, I think. And yeah, I mean, hortiness as a feature, as a mechanic for governance, is that's how we get to PMF? Basically.
01:03:51.620 - 01:03:53.730, Speaker D: All right, last question.
01:03:56.980 - 01:03:59.916, Speaker B: Don't get murdered excited if you clip.
01:03:59.948 - 01:04:04.996, Speaker A: That, by the way. You have to clip it with David saying that first. You cannot just clip me.
01:04:05.098 - 01:04:24.440, Speaker B: You'll be first. Don't worry. It'll only be you. I've got a question, even though it's not like a formulated question yet. You are both super fun and get along together really well, and it seems like, one, you're extremely smart and insightful, but you don't take yourself too seriously. One, how do you do that? How do you talk about being horny and dicks all the time?
01:04:24.510 - 01:04:29.576, Speaker C: But how are you comfortable all the time? Literally all the time?
01:04:29.678 - 01:04:39.120, Speaker B: How are you comfortable doing that? Or how do you maintain that? I feel like most people in the space take themselves way too seriously. So I'm just curious, either your philosophy about that or, I don't know, some insight.
01:04:41.540 - 01:04:43.890, Speaker A: Why are we so horny on Main?
01:04:44.420 - 01:04:51.580, Speaker C: Yeah. Do you guys have a problem? How did you make it where you can? Therapy.
01:04:51.740 - 01:05:01.940, Speaker B: I think other people wouldn't feel comfortable doing it. So do you think you just started being authentic one day and owned it and then everybody just accepts it? Because I think some people would be like, if I say this, I'm going to be canceled off Twitter.
01:05:03.820 - 01:05:38.496, Speaker C: I think it's just like, we haven't gotten canceled yet, and so we just keep going. And then at some point at some point, we'll get canceled. But yeah, honestly, for the first six months I was on Twitter, I never told a joke. I wanted to be taken seriously. And it was getting very little traction. And my friends are like, why do you have this stick up your ass on Twitter? Why can't you be you? And I was like, oh, that's interesting. And I realized being likable is actually one of the most important things you can do in social media.
01:05:38.496 - 01:06:04.040, Speaker C: Being likable is like, that's a reason people want to work with you, both in terms of hiring, but also just in terms of BD and things. And so if I can have fun and that actually is a winning business strategy. That is what is unique about crypto as a sphere that historically has not been true. You did not historically get to both have fun and have that be a good business opportunity. But crypto is really special in that way. And that's why, despite all the issues with this industry, I fucking love it.
01:06:04.190 - 01:06:04.840, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:06:04.990 - 01:06:45.668, Speaker A: I also think crypto is very much like a not serious industry in the sense that, again, we haven't achieved product market fit in most of the things that we're doing. So the whole taking yourself super seriously thing, I think I'm just not particularly sold on. David, I think is way funnier on the Internet than I am. I think David is way funnier, period, than I am. But I do think that there's an element of just like, if you take yourself super seriously, you're holding yourself back. I feel that way in general about posting on the internet. By the way, if you have this high bar for how you want to be perceived, you're never going to create anything and you're never going to share anything because you're always going to hold yourself to something that's just like, unattainable on a long enough timescale.
01:06:45.668 - 01:06:59.420, Speaker A: So I think that doing whatever the fuck you want and being at least somewhat authentically, you is just much more interesting. And really, the risk in crypto of that is so low. Like this is J. P. Morgan.
01:07:01.120 - 01:07:21.456, Speaker C: Yeah. And when you remember it's all theater, you're just a B testing your personality. Like, with every Tweet, which is scary, 280 characters to see what people like. And it's like most people do not like most of my tweets for good reason. They're not good, but it's like I get to a B test and find out what parts of my personality actually are effective. It's great. I get to myself all the time.
01:07:21.558 - 01:07:30.150, Speaker A: We've talked a lot about David, but there's also a scary version where, you know, your engagement drive your personality, but that's a whole nother audience capture type thing.
01:07:31.400 - 01:07:39.956, Speaker B: Well, you guys are just super anti Mimetic in that way, and I think people are attracted to that. And on the embarrassing bit, I actually think it's interesting, too, because you have a competitive advantage. Like, oh, people find this embarrassing.
01:07:39.988 - 01:07:41.032, Speaker C: This is perfect for me to do.
01:07:41.086 - 01:07:45.768, Speaker B: Because no one else will do it. Even being a podcaster in Crypto to.
01:07:45.774 - 01:07:46.424, Speaker C: Me is like, uh oh.
01:07:46.462 - 01:07:49.756, Speaker B: And then it's like, oh, wait, most people won't do that. So I love it.
01:07:49.778 - 01:08:01.628, Speaker C: I love Fit, the product market fit in crypto is being know, like dogecom rockets, like bald coin, whatever it is. Crypto dick butts cringe wins. Yeah.
01:08:01.794 - 01:08:05.312, Speaker B: Murder. Are you going to follow that with anything, or do you want to close?
01:08:05.366 - 01:08:08.928, Speaker A: No, that was guys, I am going to miss my flight if I do not run.
01:08:09.014 - 01:08:10.000, Speaker C: Okay, we got to go.
01:08:10.070 - 01:08:12.496, Speaker B: Chase, David, thank you so much for coming. See you next time.
01:08:12.518 - 01:08:13.180, Speaker C: Thank you. Gag.
01:08:13.260 - 01:08:13.792, Speaker A: Thanks, guys.
01:08:13.846 - 01:08:14.350, Speaker B: Everybody awesome.
