00:00:00.640 - 00:00:37.837, Speaker A: We think that the asset class is going to grow dramatically over time, but that One of these L1s is likely to take 80% market share over the long run. So we're holding a collection of call options. We're looking at if the penetration rate of these open source blockchains collectively can approach, say, 5% of the financial world. If one of these L1s can take 80% market share, we look at what they charge for fees, we look at what they're earning now, and we basically just try to do a discounted cash flow flow of what that fee income could be worth in five to seven years.

00:01:03.085 - 00:01:32.685, Speaker C: Hello and welcome. Welcome back to another episode of Lightspeed. We are super stoked today because we have Matthew Siegel joining us today. He's the head of digital assets research over at Vaneck, which obviously recently filed for a Solana etf. And so we're very excited to have Matthew on the pod today to talk about that and just his other expertise throughout crypto. Matthew, thank you so much for joining Lightspeed.
00:01:32.865 - 00:01:34.345, Speaker A: Good to be back with you guys.
00:01:35.005 - 00:01:50.465, Speaker C: I have to ask before we begin, I've watched a couple podcasts with you, Matthew, and you always have the HODL hat on with like the headset going on. Does the HODL hat just live in your desk or, you know, what's the situation with that?
00:01:52.365 - 00:02:07.965, Speaker A: It's my good luck charm. You know, I feel like we got the best ticker for the Bitcoin ETFs and I've been wearing it before we actually got that, so it just feels like bad luck to take it off at this point. I do have some hair though, unlike the other guy on our pod.
00:02:10.225 - 00:02:40.753, Speaker C: Murd immediately catching strays. Okay, well, I'm glad we were able to clear that up. Look, I guess we'll start with what a lot of Lightspeed listeners are likely interested in. And it's the Solana ETF filing that VanEck made. There was one from Vaneck. There also has been 1 from 21 shares in the US so stepping back in time. Right.
00:02:40.753 - 00:03:21.085, Speaker C: It's, you know, mid late May. ETH ETFs are sort of surprisingly approved by the SEC. And the immediate question becomes, what's the next ETF going to be? Solana seemed like it could be a clear contender because there's a lot of interest in the ecosystem. The price had gone up hugely since the lows in 2022. But you know, people weren't sure. There were some takes out there that it would be a dogecoin ETF because of, you know, decentralization. Obviously that that was answered by Vanek when you all filed for this sole ETF.
00:03:21.085 - 00:03:32.943, Speaker C: So Matthew, why was it that after the Bitcoin ETF, after the Ether ETF, VanEck decided Solana should be the third ETF that it's going to go for?
00:03:33.119 - 00:03:41.871, Speaker A: The simple answer is that we like the coin, but the more complex answer is that you need a number of.
00:03:41.983 - 00:03:46.355, Speaker D: Stakeholders to coalesce around an etf.
00:03:46.815 - 00:03:49.629, Speaker A: The sponsor has to be bullish and.
00:03:49.677 - 00:03:54.105, Speaker D: Be able to explain the investment case in a prospectus.
00:03:54.565 - 00:04:05.213, Speaker A: You need to have other ecosystem participants, like market makers and exchanges that are willing to sponsor such a product and.
00:04:05.269 - 00:04:06.573, Speaker D: Work with the issuer.
00:04:06.749 - 00:04:17.861, Speaker A: You need to have the regulator approve it and you need to have client demand so who's actually going to buy it. So I think the client demand on.
00:04:17.933 - 00:04:22.265, Speaker D: Things like Doge is probably pretty low.
00:04:22.845 - 00:04:31.821, Speaker A: I think it's harder to explain an investment case. Whereas for Solana, we've been on paper for three years now as being bullish.
00:04:31.853 - 00:04:33.685, Speaker D: On the project, seeing a lot of.
00:04:33.725 - 00:04:36.133, Speaker A: Upside, and when the regulator approved the.
00:04:36.149 - 00:04:44.125, Speaker D: ETH ETFs that really blessed ETH the asset as a commodity. And we've been observing considerable momentum in.
00:04:44.165 - 00:04:47.661, Speaker A: The decentralization of SOL over the last couple of years.
00:04:47.773 - 00:04:49.821, Speaker D: So we feel pretty strongly that SOL.
00:04:49.893 - 00:04:51.581, Speaker A: Is also a commodity.
00:04:51.733 - 00:04:54.245, Speaker D: And then we have that other stakeholder.
00:04:54.325 - 00:05:01.997, Speaker A: Support, the ecosystem participants, the client demand, and now we'll just see about the regulatory approval piece.
00:05:02.101 - 00:05:08.105, Speaker E: When you say you are bullish on the coin, why are you bullish on the coin?
00:05:08.405 - 00:05:23.733, Speaker A: Because of the performance of the blockchain. Simply put, it's the fastest, cheapest, decentralized database project that we can find. And the market is also acknowledging that.
00:05:23.909 - 00:05:27.917, Speaker D: By choosing SOL to launch literally hundreds.
00:05:27.941 - 00:05:32.597, Speaker A: Of thousands of new assets. So it's really the performance, if you.
00:05:32.621 - 00:05:34.967, Speaker D: Look across which project has the, the.
00:05:34.991 - 00:05:45.063, Speaker A: Capacity to run a decentralized NASDAQ on chain someday, you know, years in the future maybe, but for us that's, that's Seoul.
00:05:45.239 - 00:06:35.115, Speaker C: So Matthew, as far as customer demand, it feels to me like you can build a case where, look, you know, Bitcoin had big inflows when the ETF started trading. Ethereum so far has been less. So it's been, you know, a fraction of what Bitcoin flows were to ETFs. And you could build a case that Solana ETFs would be even less. The type of person that might want exposure to Bitcoin through an ETF probably isn't the same type of client who would be interested in Solana, which at least I would associate with maybe more on chain degen type of folks. So like, where do you see the demand coming from? Do you think there would be significant demand were these ETFs to get approved and start trading?
00:06:35.695 - 00:06:55.727, Speaker A: Yeah. So the first thing to note is that we actually already have a Solana ETF trading in Europe and in that product right now there is about $70 million. So, you know, there's some demand. But the important thing to do is.
00:06:55.751 - 00:06:57.943, Speaker D: To lay the groundwork for these products.
00:06:58.039 - 00:07:07.275, Speaker A: Because given the current state of the regulation, it could take a while to get them. And that's really the mission here, right?
00:07:07.315 - 00:07:08.563, Speaker D: I mean, based on what we've seen.
00:07:08.619 - 00:07:12.547, Speaker A: So far, given the personnel appointments that.
00:07:12.571 - 00:07:16.255, Speaker D: Are rumored by a potential Harris administration.
00:07:17.075 - 00:07:31.549, Speaker A: It could be that a Harris presidency is even worse for US based digital asset entrepreneurs than Biden would be. So I don't want to be just too optimistic here and say it's going.
00:07:31.557 - 00:07:32.973, Speaker D: To get done right away and there's.
00:07:32.989 - 00:07:41.557, Speaker A: Going to be a billion dollars in it. There's a number of steps that have to get through. I think that stepping back, investors are.
00:07:41.661 - 00:07:56.895, Speaker D: Crowded into these magnificent seven stocks. They're 30% of the S and P roughly. They're earning profit margins that historically are unsustainable. They either get competed away by regulation or by new technology.
00:07:57.275 - 00:08:01.011, Speaker A: And we can observe polling of institutional.
00:08:01.043 - 00:08:06.867, Speaker D: Investors that's flashing red. These stocks are too expensive and they have structural growth issues.
00:08:07.051 - 00:08:09.339, Speaker A: It is amazing to me that this.
00:08:09.387 - 00:08:13.339, Speaker D: Administration is winning antitrust lawsuits against big.
00:08:13.387 - 00:08:18.035, Speaker A: Tech while attacking open source alternatives. That's illogical.
00:08:18.155 - 00:08:27.067, Speaker D: That fails to protect the consumer welfare that regulators are entrusted with safeguarding. And investors realize this and they're looking for hedges.
00:08:27.251 - 00:08:28.743, Speaker A: So it's up to us and the.
00:08:28.759 - 00:08:35.199, Speaker D: Other players in this space to explain why. Solana and Ethereum are both potential hedges.
00:08:35.327 - 00:08:41.191, Speaker A: That are going to give entrepreneurs the ability to build cheaper, decentralized app stores.
00:08:41.263 - 00:08:45.039, Speaker D: To compete directly with Google and Apple. And when you look at the drawdowns.
00:08:45.087 - 00:08:54.751, Speaker A: That these assets have, just as an example, ethereum drew down 80% last cycle. So did Meta Stock. So even these mega cap names that.
00:08:54.783 - 00:08:57.063, Speaker D: Investors own automatically if they own The.
00:08:57.079 - 00:09:00.827, Speaker A: S&P 500 are susceptible to big drawdowns.
00:09:00.971 - 00:09:03.059, Speaker D: And over time we think that these.
00:09:03.107 - 00:09:05.595, Speaker A: Platforms are going to be attractive hedges.
00:09:05.755 - 00:09:12.455, Speaker D: That said, the lack of staking in the early Ethereum ETFs, I do think that it's hurting the demand.
00:09:12.875 - 00:09:15.179, Speaker A: The end user really can't get the.
00:09:15.227 - 00:09:16.659, Speaker D: Utility out of the asset.
00:09:16.707 - 00:09:27.035, Speaker A: They're buying it for speculation, and that's going to take time and luck in order to harmonize the regulatory treatment and.
00:09:27.075 - 00:09:30.215, Speaker D: Let tradfi investors access the yield.
00:09:31.195 - 00:09:57.477, Speaker E: What do you think about the lack of. Because I believe when you guys announced this, it was kind of a while ago now in crypto years, but I seem to recall at least one person saying, oh, this is more so of a marketing move because there's no futures market. And I think you refuted that with saying that you don't actually need one. Could you maybe expand on that a little bit?
00:09:57.651 - 00:09:58.445, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:58.865 - 00:10:02.033, Speaker D: So there have been ETFs in the.
00:10:02.089 - 00:10:20.645, Speaker A: Past in the natural gas market, the electricity market, where the ETF depended on a futures contract that was either listed on the CME or maybe it was listed somewhere else.
00:10:20.945 - 00:10:22.425, Speaker D: So the point is that lots of.
00:10:22.465 - 00:10:29.203, Speaker A: These idiosyncratic assets, like electricity, for example, they're not standardized.
00:10:29.259 - 00:10:31.563, Speaker D: The price formation that takes place on.
00:10:31.659 - 00:10:35.307, Speaker A: The CME might not actually be where.
00:10:35.371 - 00:10:47.987, Speaker D: The actual supply demand is happening. And there are examples of ETFs that have traded that are not based on the CME futures rate, but rather on some other market.
00:10:48.091 - 00:11:07.351, Speaker A: So we think the SEC has been taking too strict of interpretation of that futures market, and we think that's basically a Gary Gensler psyop that only started to become prominent once he took power. So we look forward to making the case and you'll be able to read that.
00:11:07.503 - 00:11:41.095, Speaker C: So you mentioned that you could foresee a Harris administration being more difficult for the crypto space than a Biden administration. And obviously, as you said, it sort of sounds like you're implying that a Gensler administration or a Gensler SEC would not buy the argument that you don't need a CME futures market. So, yeah, was this made with kind of the bet in mind on a Trump presidency being the only way this thing sort of gets over the line?
00:11:45.065 - 00:11:46.185, Speaker A: You have to be in the game.
00:11:46.225 - 00:11:49.841, Speaker D: To win the game. So putting down our arguments in paper.
00:11:50.033 - 00:11:58.305, Speaker A: And then either winning them in a lawsuit or because the regulator chair turns.
00:11:58.345 - 00:12:00.965, Speaker D: Over, or because the president turns over.
00:12:01.465 - 00:12:15.941, Speaker A: All of these are possible. But unless you put your arguments down, then you'll never win. So in the case of grayscale and their Bitcoin lawsuit from last year, they had a real economic need to get that done.
00:12:16.013 - 00:12:19.069, Speaker D: Given the discount in the GBTC product.
00:12:19.237 - 00:12:23.797, Speaker A: We don't really have that economic need. So you'd have to ask Alan Vanek.
00:12:23.821 - 00:12:25.157, Speaker D: If he plans to sue the sec.
00:12:25.261 - 00:12:35.385, Speaker A: My guess would be no. But if the administration changes, then we think this argument is going to be well accepted.
00:12:36.925 - 00:13:25.765, Speaker C: And, you know, I'd like to dive a little bit just into some of the considerations involved because there hasn't been the question of a Solana SE ETF approval for as long as with Bitcoin. So what's sort of the argument that Vaneck would make as far as why Solana is a commodity and not a security and should be allowed to trade as an etf? Because I think sort of academically I could get to the place of saying, look, there's more of a common enterprise based on that's expecting a profit based on the efforts of others than with, say, Bitcoin or even Ethereum. So what's the case Vaneck is making for why Solana should be allowed to trade as an etf?
00:13:26.745 - 00:13:33.561, Speaker A: Yeah, so part of it has to do with the ripple decision where the.
00:13:33.593 - 00:13:36.465, Speaker D: Secondary sales of the XRP token were.
00:13:36.545 - 00:14:02.037, Speaker A: Ruled not to be security sales. And when you compare Solana's governance and architecture and decentralization to XRP to us, it shows as more decentralized. Additionally, while there were obviously presale transactions with Solana in the early days, many.
00:14:02.061 - 00:14:04.397, Speaker D: Of those are in the rearview mirror.
00:14:04.541 - 00:14:19.833, Speaker A: And when you look at the number of validators, the distribution of holders, how much the foundation owns, and then now the existence of the second client, Firedancer, it appears to us like no single.
00:14:19.889 - 00:14:23.353, Speaker D: Entity controls this chain and it shares.
00:14:23.409 - 00:14:44.227, Speaker A: More with Ethereum in terms of its decentralization than there are differences. So there's obviously still a SEC lawsuit against Coinbase which claims otherwise, and perhaps that may need to get settled before.
00:14:44.371 - 00:14:47.775, Speaker D: Like this SEC would permit this product.
00:14:48.075 - 00:14:49.907, Speaker A: But, you know, we think Coinbase is.
00:14:49.931 - 00:14:53.067, Speaker D: Well situated in that suit and a.
00:14:53.091 - 00:14:56.043, Speaker A: Settlement, you know, is not too far away.
00:14:56.179 - 00:15:35.945, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I'm curious on the question of the Coinbase suit, obviously, recently the SEC amended its Binance suit to drop the question of securities, including Solana, from that case. That was sort of touted as the SEC doesn't classify Solana as a security, which isn't really true. You know, the SEC was probably making a litigation strategy decision there. But I don't know. Like, do you foresee a world where the SEC drops this argument from the Coinbase suit, or maybe just due to sort of political pressure, the SEC reverses course on classifying Solana as a security.
00:15:37.525 - 00:15:39.053, Speaker A: So this is a lot of speculation.
00:15:39.149 - 00:15:42.225, Speaker D: Here, but it's based on kind of past examples.
00:15:43.965 - 00:16:01.283, Speaker A: I think that the change in language in the Binance suit was just about consolidating the staff's efforts to litigate the Coinbase suit and kind of focus on that one. But when you look at kind of previous high profile litigation and the book.
00:16:01.339 - 00:16:03.211, Speaker D: Black Edge comes to mind, which was.
00:16:03.243 - 00:16:08.011, Speaker A: About the DOJ investigation into Stevie Cohen.
00:16:08.123 - 00:16:19.259, Speaker D: Insider trading at SAC in point 72, like, these cases go on for years and what inevitably happens is that these assistant prosecutors get tired of making 80k.
00:16:19.307 - 00:16:21.347, Speaker A: A year working for the government and.
00:16:21.371 - 00:16:26.723, Speaker D: They leave and they all end up as general counsel at whatever hedge fund or whatever crypto fund.
00:16:26.819 - 00:16:36.071, Speaker A: And who's ever left gets, gets tired of litigating an old case and finally the word comes down, okay, settle. So that's, I think what we would.
00:16:36.143 - 00:16:38.031, Speaker D: Expect is that all the key players.
00:16:38.143 - 00:16:50.911, Speaker A: Basically leave the SEC and then, you know, they settle the case. I don't know if that's next year, the year after. We could talk to Paul at Coinbase about that and see what he thinks, if he'd tell us. But that's my guess as to how.
00:16:50.943 - 00:16:53.151, Speaker D: This ends, if not with a loss.
00:16:53.223 - 00:16:55.375, Speaker A: By, by the sec.
00:16:57.675 - 00:17:23.046, Speaker E: Something I'm interested in, which is actually going to be quite a naive question on purpose here. What is the significance of the ETF for the network? Do you have any thoughts on that? As in, obviously it brings more eyes to it, more financial activity in some regards. But like, do you think, what is the benefit to the blockchain that it brings in terms of.
00:17:23.070 - 00:17:25.350, Speaker D: Come on, mert, it's a TradFi L2.
00:17:25.542 - 00:17:28.622, Speaker A: It expands the available market, right?
00:17:28.678 - 00:17:30.414, Speaker D: So you reach a whole other class.
00:17:30.454 - 00:17:41.774, Speaker A: Of investors that won't operate or don't operate on open source blockchains are interested in the asset but need the security of a third party custodian in order.
00:17:41.814 - 00:17:43.598, Speaker D: To hold onto those keys.
00:17:43.726 - 00:17:51.394, Speaker A: I think that's really the biggest use case. Now one of the things that struck me by looking at the 13F filings.
00:17:51.472 - 00:17:56.271, Speaker D: On the Bitcoin ETFs, which are the quarterly filings that reveal who holds the.
00:17:56.303 - 00:18:19.305, Speaker A: Asset, who holds the ETFs, is that after the first quarter, hedge funds owned twice as much Bitcoin ETFs as investment advisors, despite managing 5% of the assets. That tells me that hedge funds basically front running Investment advisors, they noticed that.
00:18:19.685 - 00:18:27.629, Speaker D: The wire houses, the big banks and brokers have not yet put out these asset allocation models that include Bitcoin.
00:18:27.757 - 00:18:30.509, Speaker A: That's why the rollout from the Morgan.
00:18:30.557 - 00:18:35.005, Speaker D: Stanleys, the UBS is, the Merrill lynch has been so slow because those chief.
00:18:35.045 - 00:18:53.879, Speaker A: Investment officers haven't yet put out like hey, own 60% stocks, 39% bonds, 1% bitcoin, those types of 30,000 foot air cover for asset allocation. We think those are in progress and are going to come out second half of this year, next year.
00:18:54.047 - 00:18:56.023, Speaker D: Hedge funds are like, okay, once those.
00:18:56.079 - 00:19:09.295, Speaker A: Come out, the advisors are going to buy. Why don't we buy ahead of time? I think that's been the complexion of buying has been retail hedge funds either speculating or playing the cash and carry.
00:19:09.335 - 00:19:15.147, Speaker D: Trade by owning the ETFs and shorting the futures and that the asset allocators.
00:19:15.291 - 00:19:28.475, Speaker A: Are going to be later in the game. My guess is if a Solana ETF were to come to market, probably be a similar story until these advisors get more cover from the banks and brokers.
00:19:28.515 - 00:19:31.347, Speaker D: That often set their allocation strategies.
00:19:31.531 - 00:20:03.355, Speaker C: And do you see these banks and brokers just playing this out a little bit? Is there a world where it's like hey, take 5% and allocate it to crypto through these ETFs. And the exposure because we have ETFs is easier to get for a large broker than like trading through Coinbase or something like what do you think down the road could be the sort of strategy in a bullish world that investment advisors would give their clients.
00:20:04.415 - 00:20:07.023, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it starts with kind.
00:20:07.039 - 00:20:10.031, Speaker D: Of in that 1 to 3% allocation.
00:20:10.183 - 00:20:23.895, Speaker A: To digital assets holistically and then bitcoin taking maybe 70% of that allocation. That's the typical model that we've seen.
00:20:24.015 - 00:20:28.783, Speaker B: Fragmentation is a big problem for Ethereum, but also for the subscription industry.
00:20:28.959 - 00:20:30.455, Speaker C: We all know the pain of tracking.

00:21:36.383 - 00:21:43.703, Speaker E: Actually, something just came to my mind and correct me if I'm wrong here, but I believe you guys have a Meme Coin index, right?
00:21:43.879 - 00:21:44.327, Speaker A: Yes.
00:21:44.391 - 00:21:46.639, Speaker E: And I think it's literally called Meme Coin.
00:21:46.807 - 00:21:47.663, Speaker A: That's right.
00:21:47.839 - 00:21:57.595, Speaker E: And I think it was. I forget all the names on it. How was that? How has that been so far? Any interesting insights or reactions to it?
00:21:58.095 - 00:22:07.247, Speaker A: Yeah, so we own an indexing company called Market Vectors. It's a wholly owned subsidiary and they.
00:22:07.351 - 00:22:18.595, Speaker D: Run a pretty large digital asset indexing business. They have more than 40 different indexes, whole bunch of sectors, layer ones defi Meme Coins.
00:22:19.105 - 00:22:21.969, Speaker A: Vaneck will either license one of those.
00:22:22.017 - 00:22:24.361, Speaker D: Indexes to build a product on top.
00:22:24.393 - 00:22:28.881, Speaker A: Of it or Market Vectors will license it to a third party who will.
00:22:28.913 - 00:22:30.193, Speaker D: Build their own product.
00:22:30.329 - 00:22:34.777, Speaker A: So in the case of the Meme Coin index that was licensed by an.
00:22:34.801 - 00:22:41.513, Speaker D: Exchange customer and they're running a product based on it, and then they pay a small licensing fee to Market Vector.
00:22:41.569 - 00:23:00.343, Speaker A: So on the Vaneck asset management side, we haven't made a product on Meme Coins. We are generally trying to limit our investments to products that have a great doxed team building a product that is.
00:23:00.399 - 00:23:05.023, Speaker D: Better than the Tradfi analog with product.
00:23:05.079 - 00:23:07.955, Speaker A: Market fit, a path to scale to.
00:23:08.295 - 00:23:16.455, Speaker D: 50 million users and some type of tokenomics that returns value to the token holder. It's very, very small number of products.
00:23:16.575 - 00:23:31.595, Speaker A: Projects that actually tick all those boxes. So position sizing, you know, we might choose to buy something that only ticks four out of five, but generally speaking that's what we're looking for. And Meme Coins have not passed that high hurdle yet.
00:23:32.255 - 00:23:39.115, Speaker E: What are your personal views on Meme Coins? Do you think they're sustainable? Do you think they're fun, a distraction?
00:23:40.735 - 00:24:10.841, Speaker A: I think they're fun. I think that they prove the product market fit of individual asset issuance. Right. So I started as a journalist, my career covering finance at like networks like Bloomberg and cnbc. And I got really disillusioned with the news process and felt that journalists are not incentivized to figure out what the.
00:24:10.873 - 00:24:13.081, Speaker D: Truth is and are not incentivized to.
00:24:13.113 - 00:24:14.305, Speaker A: Print the whole truth.
00:24:14.425 - 00:24:15.637, Speaker D: And that when you look at how.
00:24:15.681 - 00:24:30.145, Speaker A: How capital formation happens in tradfi, that kind of pipeline from venture capital to private funding to IPOs and bank research.
00:24:31.605 - 00:24:33.757, Speaker D: It'S a very narrative process.
00:24:33.901 - 00:24:42.589, Speaker A: We saw it in the SPAC market in 2021 that it can go horribly wrong. And I'm a believer that social media.
00:24:42.677 - 00:24:50.689, Speaker D: Changed the news business and made memes more important and that changed how, how capital forms. So whether I like it or not.
00:24:50.737 - 00:24:55.641, Speaker A: Is kind of like irrelevant. Like I wouldn't invest other people's money in meme coins.
00:24:55.793 - 00:24:57.393, Speaker D: But I think that they prove the.
00:24:57.449 - 00:25:01.177, Speaker A: Use case here, which is that narratives.
00:25:01.321 - 00:25:04.721, Speaker D: And memes are instrumental to capital formation.
00:25:04.833 - 00:25:07.713, Speaker A: In the 21st century. And you can build a brand on.
00:25:07.729 - 00:25:09.985, Speaker D: The back of a meme as long as you execute.
00:25:10.065 - 00:25:13.113, Speaker A: So I've seen some data on how.
00:25:13.129 - 00:25:15.065, Speaker D: Many of these meme coins are actually.
00:25:15.185 - 00:25:28.345, Speaker A: Kind of getting off the ground. I saw some Data there were 17,000 tokens that launched in one day on August 10th. Of those 17,000, I think like 175.
00:25:28.449 - 00:25:31.967, Speaker D: Made it onto radium pools and there's.
00:25:32.071 - 00:25:51.225, Speaker A: 19 that have like a $69,000 market cap. So 19 out of 17,000. Right. So 1 in 1,000 success rate. I don't love those odds if I'm managing other people's money, but everyone's free to allocate the way they see fit.
00:25:52.885 - 00:25:55.301, Speaker D: I think that Solana's success in meme.
00:25:55.333 - 00:26:02.749, Speaker A: Coins is just a validation. It's revealed market preferences. If it wasn't happening on Sol, it might be happening on some other chain.
00:26:02.837 - 00:26:04.325, Speaker D: But no other chain makes it as.
00:26:04.365 - 00:26:06.745, Speaker A: Easy to issue an asset as Solana.
00:26:07.405 - 00:26:39.035, Speaker C: Just picking up on the idea that in the social media era, narratives have come to matter a lot in the prices of assets. And with meme coins you can see there's a lot of money to be made. Or even meme stocks, like a gamestop, there's a lot of money to be made in this sort of narrative formation process. So I guess just in your view, being in the asset management world, is this a bad thing? Is this something people should run from? Or is it sort of a sustainable state of affairs?
00:26:40.295 - 00:26:43.275, Speaker D: My Twitter handle is recovering cfa.
00:26:43.575 - 00:26:56.435, Speaker A: So like, I recognize that the classic cash flow based analysis of real tangible assets is just less relevant in today's world.
00:26:57.255 - 00:27:02.159, Speaker D: Two thirds of US GDP is generated from intangible assets.
00:27:02.287 - 00:27:20.873, Speaker A: Things like brands, goodwill. That's acquired in acquisitions, not factories. So if 2/3 of GDP is coming from intangible assets, then memes definitely have value. And I just think it's a different research process.
00:27:21.049 - 00:27:29.241, Speaker D: In Tradfi, you're on this quarterly schedule where you get fresh data on the operating metrics of the company every quarter.
00:27:29.313 - 00:27:56.973, Speaker A: And there's an entire industry that exists to kind of package that information on a calendar based schedule and let the market interpret it at the same time. In blockchain world, we can track these PNLs daily. There's always something new on social media. It's just a very different and I think higher turnover, higher velocity ecosystem.
00:27:57.109 - 00:27:59.625, Speaker D: It makes it much harder to run.
00:27:59.925 - 00:28:08.765, Speaker A: Kind of buy and hold strategies. I think that's one of the challenges in the space and that's why at Vaneck we're experimenting.
00:28:08.885 - 00:28:10.285, Speaker D: No one can claim to really know.
00:28:10.325 - 00:28:24.265, Speaker A: Exactly how this industry is going to shape out. And that's why we have 22 different digital asset strategies. Many of them are ETFs, passive, that run systematically. But then even on the active side, we're experimenting with a couple different models.
00:28:24.605 - 00:28:27.341, Speaker D: A large cap, lower turnover strategy that's.
00:28:27.373 - 00:28:30.419, Speaker A: Trying to stake aggressively, make sure we.
00:28:30.557 - 00:28:34.303, Speaker D: Avoid dilution and hopefully own the winners.
00:28:34.439 - 00:28:42.879, Speaker A: And then we have like a smaller cap, higher turnover, riskier strategy that while it doesn't own meme coins, you know.
00:28:42.927 - 00:28:47.223, Speaker D: Ends up getting kind of meme coin adjacent or more meme coin adjacent by.
00:28:47.359 - 00:29:17.405, Speaker A: Investing in some of the picks and shovels makers that are benefiting from the meme coin explosion. So, you know, I don't, I don't think it's good or bad. It just, it kind of is what it is. It's a little bit sad that the regulators haven't adjusted to that reality, but we're still taking the view that these tokens are largely commodities and the regulator will eventually come along on that as well.
00:29:19.985 - 00:29:49.995, Speaker E: Talking about some of the challenges of maybe blockchains, one of the things that I find challenging is let's say the noisy field of metrics in which ones you can trust and which ones are fake and being actively incentivized, etc. I guess the meta question here is how do you personally, or maybe from the perspective of VanEck value L1s, like what are some things you look at? Do you look at these weird CT debates? Like is issuance a cost to the network, et cetera?
00:29:51.055 - 00:29:51.415, Speaker A: Yes.
00:29:51.455 - 00:29:52.915, Speaker E: Just curious, some thoughts there.
00:29:53.625 - 00:30:17.729, Speaker A: Yeah, so we do think issuance is A cost. We're basically looking at fees, right? So we think that the asset class is going to grow dramatically over time, but that One of these L1s is likely to take 80% market share over the long run.
00:30:17.857 - 00:30:20.285, Speaker D: So we're holding a collection of call options.
00:30:20.625 - 00:30:24.211, Speaker A: We're looking at if the penetration rate.
00:30:24.323 - 00:30:30.691, Speaker D: Of these open source blockchains collectively can approach, say, 5% of the financial world.
00:30:30.777 - 00:30:47.815, Speaker A: If one of these L1s can take 80% market share, we look at what they charge for fees, we look at what they're earning now, and we basically just try to do a discounted cash flow of what that fee income could be worth in five to seven years.
00:30:49.085 - 00:30:53.821, Speaker D: Now, there are other variables that play into it, such as the current inflation.
00:30:53.893 - 00:30:56.285, Speaker A: Rate and the current staking rate.
00:30:56.445 - 00:30:58.461, Speaker D: So for me personally, I can see.
00:30:58.493 - 00:31:09.869, Speaker A: Just a very tiny handful of assets that are producing a positive real yield where the staking reward exceeds the inflation rate.
00:31:09.997 - 00:31:12.077, Speaker D: And that for me is a very powerful dynamic.
00:31:12.101 - 00:31:23.101, Speaker A: When you have that, that justifies a very high position because you're not going to get diluted. And then there are some of these kind of newer, perhaps technically superior projects.
00:31:23.173 - 00:31:25.685, Speaker D: But where the issuance is just too high.
00:31:25.845 - 00:31:27.773, Speaker A: And that means that when you go.
00:31:27.909 - 00:31:29.949, Speaker D: Through the drawdowns or the bear markets.
00:31:30.037 - 00:31:35.705, Speaker A: You'Re going to have big sell offs. And there it's about managing the position size.
00:31:38.725 - 00:31:48.117, Speaker C: I'm curious if you're more bearish on Ethereum post Denkun then with less fee revenue going to the layer one as.
00:31:48.141 - 00:31:51.065, Speaker A: A result of blobs, my less bearish.
00:31:52.085 - 00:31:52.957, Speaker D: I think there have.
00:31:53.021 - 00:31:54.421, Speaker C: Excuse me, more bearish. I missed.
00:31:54.453 - 00:32:13.989, Speaker A: More bearish, sorry. There's definitely some fundamental challenges to ETH's scaling roadmap from the perspective that Denkun, while it did catalyze an increase in.
00:32:14.077 - 00:32:21.889, Speaker D: Transactions, that increase was not enough to soak up all of the excess capacity that was enabled.
00:32:22.017 - 00:32:29.385, Speaker A: And as a result ETH fees are down like 55% since Denkun and the.
00:32:29.425 - 00:32:31.569, Speaker D: Network has turned inflationary again.
00:32:31.657 - 00:32:41.257, Speaker A: So that's not positive. Like it's hard to spin it and say that's positive, but these lower costs.
00:32:41.401 - 00:32:47.665, Speaker D: Given how many shots on goal ETH has and how many developers are working on this problem and how many different.
00:32:47.705 - 00:32:56.005, Speaker A: L2s are iterating around that main chain, I personally feel like eth's odds of.
00:32:56.125 - 00:33:08.605, Speaker D: Success, and by success I mean finding that handful of apps that soaks up the blob space eventually turns around gas prices and turns around the token relative performance. I still think there's a reasonable probability.
00:33:08.685 - 00:33:51.815, Speaker A: That that's going to happen and I haven't like aggressively sold any eth. Still staking a lot of it in my personal strategy that I manage. Solana is now a bigger position than eth, but that's happened more through performance than it has because of selling ETH as the grayscale outflows now ease and especially I think post the election when I do think there's going to be a big beta rally in equities and crypto, I think there's a decent chance that ETH catches up, but fundamentals have not been great over the last three, four, five months.
00:33:53.075 - 00:34:13.575, Speaker E: Well, make sure to stake that soul with Helios. Well, we talked about basically the bear case for Ethereum. Let's talk about some things that Solana could use for improvement. I'm sure you have some thoughts, maybe a few things that you'd like to see differently or progress more going to the future.
00:34:14.165 - 00:34:43.165, Speaker A: Yeah, so we've got a handful of things that I think bears point to Solana that are somewhat justified. So one of them is that Solana's high reliance on MEV is always going to attract some haters. So just because of kind of how the chain is architected, MEV is a.
00:34:43.205 - 00:34:46.125, Speaker D: Much bigger percentage of our discounted cash.
00:34:46.165 - 00:34:58.253, Speaker A: Flow for SOL than it is for eth. And we can see that the team has already taken some steps to tamper.
00:34:58.349 - 00:35:01.261, Speaker D: This mev, like restricting the validators who.
00:35:01.293 - 00:35:45.905, Speaker A: Engage in sandwich attacks. But still, the Solana MEV averages about 0.2% per transaction and it's something that people are going to talk about, so that's out there. The second is issues with spam and chain congestion. So when it works, it's a great experience from the user perspective, issuing assets and trading assets. But in March and April, 70% transaction failure rates, that's too high. So we're hopeful that, you know, the next time there's a big frenzy of activity, whether it's Firedance or some of the other upgrades, maybe that, maybe that helps.
00:35:45.905 - 00:36:08.569, Speaker A: The third is that the block explorers for Solana are pretty brutal to use. And last week when Solana Defi activity flipped ETH briefly and you know, there's a lot of charts out there showing that and you know, we were were some of the folks that were highlighting that momentum.
00:36:08.617 - 00:36:10.705, Speaker D: I got a bunch of angry emails.
00:36:10.785 - 00:36:22.889, Speaker A: Highlighting all of the wash trading or alleged wash trading that's happening on some of these illiquid meme coin pools. And the fact is, it's just hard.
00:36:22.937 - 00:36:24.793, Speaker D: To figure out the reality because there's.
00:36:24.849 - 00:36:28.305, Speaker A: So much data and no one really stores it all.
00:36:28.425 - 00:36:30.473, Speaker D: So there's no equivalent to D Bank.
00:36:30.569 - 00:36:35.537, Speaker A: On Solana for tracking defi assets. Maybe it's an impossibility, but I think.
00:36:35.561 - 00:36:37.489, Speaker D: That improving the Block Explorers would go.
00:36:37.497 - 00:36:40.405, Speaker A: Along way to helping to push back.
00:36:40.445 - 00:36:48.189, Speaker D: On some of the fud. All right, just two more hang with me. Number four, Solana consensus design is so.
00:36:48.237 - 00:36:57.397, Speaker A: Complex that few actually know how it works or how it can be improved. So we love that, like totally.
00:36:57.421 - 00:36:59.309, Speaker D: And the move fast and break stuff.
00:36:59.397 - 00:37:31.719, Speaker A: And kind of the ethos around Solana. But it may hurt onboarding devs to build consumer applications without more knowledge of how intricate the chain functions and the monetary policy. So something to work on. And then the last one, which I also think is improving, but building an app on Solana. Tole calls it chewing glass. I'm not a developer, but that doesn't sound terribly fun. So it's difficult.
00:37:31.719 - 00:37:36.447, Speaker A: It necessitates like 10x developers and a.
00:37:36.471 - 00:37:39.183, Speaker D: Deep understanding of Rust of C how.
00:37:39.199 - 00:38:07.869, Speaker A: To work within these specific coding rules. And we think the tooling has improved with Anchor and some of the other educational programs, but some of the other monolithic chains that are more nascent, maybe a bit easier and simpler to use. So that's our call to the SOL community. There's tons of things we love, but I guess those are the areas for improvement.
00:38:07.997 - 00:38:30.395, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, I think that's pretty valuable feedback. So I think I largely agree with a good chunk of them. Explorers certainly suck and we're going to be releasing one pretty soon. And then on the fifth point of the developer experience. Yeah, I mean, it's definitely harder, but I think it's all. Yeah, like, I think next year when we do this episode, hopefully we fixed all those issues.
00:38:31.695 - 00:39:00.625, Speaker C: I'm curious, Matthew, on the point of mev, you know, assuming that Solana is able to prevent sandwiching, which universally people agree is bad and you know, screws over users, is it like what is drawing haters as far as mev, like outside of sandwich attacks? That's sort of a new argument to me.
00:39:00.745 - 00:39:10.993, Speaker A: I think it comes down to the fact that the blocks are so much shorter that having a powerful machine matters.
00:39:11.049 - 00:39:13.049, Speaker D: That much more when you're fighting for.
00:39:13.097 - 00:39:34.574, Speaker A: Space in the last 5 milliseconds or whatever it is. So in our valuation of Solana, that MEV portion is more than half of Solana's fee income, whereas for ethereum it's like 30%. Now this is like if you're in.
00:39:34.675 - 00:39:37.193, Speaker D: TradFi, you want a contentious Environment. Right.
00:39:37.249 - 00:39:40.497, Speaker A: You want lots of well funded market.
00:39:40.561 - 00:39:43.481, Speaker D: Makers competing to offer the best price.
00:39:43.673 - 00:39:50.701, Speaker A: To the end client. And that's kind of what's happening on Solana also. So I'm not a hater of it.
00:39:50.773 - 00:39:52.389, Speaker D: I think that this model is actually.
00:39:52.437 - 00:40:04.909, Speaker A: Kind of necessary if you want to transact at the speed of light globally and draw in big capital that's going to be incentivized to make these markets tight. But it's out there.
00:40:05.077 - 00:40:07.229, Speaker D: I did some math on the MEV.
00:40:07.277 - 00:40:11.269, Speaker A: For Solana this year so far, maybe.
00:40:11.317 - 00:40:13.243, Speaker D: Wrong, so you might have different numbers.
00:40:13.309 - 00:40:21.031, Speaker A: But I count about $200 million in MEV year to date.
00:40:21.223 - 00:40:24.571, Speaker D: So that annualizes to call it 400 million. Right.
00:40:24.663 - 00:41:09.715, Speaker A: So if we say that Solana is $100 billion asset and the staking rate is roughly five and a half percent, so you're talking about $400 million in MEV on a base of like five and a half billion in staking rewards. So it's, you know, it's a pretty small amount. It moves the needle year to date. It changes the staking Yield by about 10bps. So it's meaningful, but it's not like all that matters. And even without all that mev, I would calculate that Sol would still have a positive real staking rate that exceeds.
00:41:09.875 - 00:41:11.379, Speaker D: The level of inflation.
00:41:11.547 - 00:41:18.211, Speaker A: But the MEV is, it's a help and it's a bigger percentage than on eth.
00:41:18.363 - 00:41:50.985, Speaker E: It would just because obviously you run a validator and the priority fees, I would say generally are where the validators make the money. And then obviously you can choose to share that with the stakers as well. One thing I'm curious about is so Tolle's, let's say slogan of NASDAQ or blockchain at Nasdaq speed. Some people like it, some people don't like it. Let's take it a bit literally. With kind of your background and expertise in this field, do you think that's actually possible? Like the Nasdaq running on a blockchain or something similar?
00:41:55.125 - 00:42:03.065, Speaker A: Is it possible? Technically, probably yes. Although the user experience would not be as good as Nasdaq.
00:42:04.165 - 00:42:06.645, Speaker D: Unclear if it's possible from a regulatory perspective.
00:42:06.685 - 00:42:07.005, Speaker A: Obviously.
00:42:07.045 - 00:42:08.293, Speaker D: Actually the answer to that is no.
00:42:08.349 - 00:42:32.755, Speaker A: Right now because you can't even use USDC on Solana in New York State. So the regulator's not on board. But there's a new national stock exchange that's going to open in Texas. You've got Citadel making moves about being in there. Other big players. So how the world may change in a few years, I don't know. And we love the idea that with Solana.
00:42:34.535 - 00:42:37.035, Speaker D: Devs are incentivized to build something.
00:42:37.815 - 00:42:39.839, Speaker A: That leverages how the chips are going.
00:42:39.847 - 00:42:44.543, Speaker D: To be in three years, in five years. It assumes this continual improvement.
00:42:44.719 - 00:42:56.887, Speaker A: And that's the attitude that you have to have, I think to execute on that vision of NASDAQ. Permissionless NASDAQ. In 2007 I was working on a.
00:42:56.951 - 00:43:09.951, Speaker D: Global equities fund and we were big shareholders in Qualcomm because if you remember, Qualcomm had an operating system that leveraged gps. There was a potential that Qualcomm would.
00:43:09.983 - 00:43:12.871, Speaker A: Have been the company that monetized location.
00:43:12.943 - 00:43:15.119, Speaker D: Based services and sold ads against it.
00:43:15.207 - 00:43:19.551, Speaker A: It ended up being Google, but Qualcomm had the tech and that was actually.
00:43:19.583 - 00:43:20.727, Speaker D: One of the reasons that we owned.
00:43:20.751 - 00:43:35.919, Speaker A: It back then in those days. So when I first heard like Totally's background and how he was approaching the proof of history mechanism within the Solana blockchain, it just resonated with me. And I thought, you know, this is.
00:43:35.967 - 00:43:38.583, Speaker D: Maybe round two for the original Qualcomm.
00:43:38.639 - 00:43:40.475, Speaker A: Vision to get executed.
00:43:41.735 - 00:44:06.345, Speaker C: So there's this decentralized NASDAQ idea or conception of Solana and then there's also like these apps or I think a big one that is pretty dominant right now is depin. Things like Helium. Which of those are you personally more interested in or do you think has more sort of promise casting Solana down into the future over the next year?
00:44:06.465 - 00:44:09.169, Speaker D: I think the Depin story will probably.
00:44:09.337 - 00:44:52.411, Speaker A: Resonate more strongly because of the regulatory hurdles to getting NASDAQ on chain. I don't think we're close to trading securities on the Solana blockchain and just repeating that you still can't own or you still can't transfer USDC on Solana in New York. Whereas for DePin, we've disclosed previously that we're investors in projects like both Helium and hivemapper and there you can see strong growth. Helium's now over 100k subs. Hivemappers mapped 15% of the world's mappable kilometers. I think the low transaction costs on.
00:44:52.443 - 00:44:54.939, Speaker D: Sol will help those networks.
00:44:55.067 - 00:44:58.003, Speaker A: And I think in the case of Helium, you're starting to see some potential.
00:44:58.099 - 00:45:02.147, Speaker D: Spin off ideas leveraging the main Helium network.
00:45:02.291 - 00:45:25.729, Speaker A: So the market caps are very small in that space. It doesn't take a ton of flows to move the price and that's where we're observing more momentum. It'll be interesting how, how Solana's architecture adapts I guess to if there's more depend usage because on our numbers I.
00:45:25.737 - 00:45:27.805, Speaker D: Think it's like more than 80% of.
00:45:28.105 - 00:45:32.489, Speaker A: Transactions on SOL are paying tips and priority fees.
00:45:32.657 - 00:45:37.329, Speaker D: That's not the type of environment that you'd imagine for a deep end project.
00:45:37.417 - 00:45:39.325, Speaker A: So that'll be interesting to watch.
00:45:40.385 - 00:45:54.411, Speaker E: Yep. Thank you for the kind words on my project. Well, as we get ready to wrap here, I mean you talked about five things you'd like to see better about Solana. What are five things you like about Solana today? What gets you more excited?
00:45:54.483 - 00:46:00.451, Speaker A: Yeah, the first thing that we love is that the vast majority of the.
00:46:00.483 - 00:46:02.855, Speaker D: Time it's an excellent user experience.
00:46:03.955 - 00:46:11.891, Speaker A: Transactions are executing in two to three seconds. It's a fraction of a penny. I personally, I use the Solana Saga.
00:46:11.923 - 00:46:14.643, Speaker D: Phone as my main phone if you can believe it.
00:46:14.739 - 00:46:18.915, Speaker A: The batteries like really bad. Yeah, I know. I'm gonna.
00:46:19.215 - 00:46:24.035, Speaker C: What is that? Like I need to, I need to cut you off there. You're the first person I've met that does this.
00:46:25.495 - 00:46:27.935, Speaker A: Except for the crappy battery, you know.
00:46:27.975 - 00:46:31.431, Speaker D: It'S, it's working okay. I'm definitely looking forward to round two.
00:46:31.503 - 00:46:34.343, Speaker A: But it, you know, gets all my needs done.
00:46:34.439 - 00:46:35.927, Speaker D: And I think it was a very.
00:46:35.991 - 00:46:45.493, Speaker A: Important project in terms of putting a flag down and saying we're gonna build for the consumer because what we see is just way too many infrastructure apps.
00:46:45.629 - 00:46:48.677, Speaker D: Everyone's going for these high B2B SaaS.
00:46:48.741 - 00:46:54.861, Speaker A: Margins and we don't see much on the consumer side where admittedly like there's.
00:46:54.893 - 00:46:57.757, Speaker D: More turnover, lower multiples, it's a harder problem.
00:46:57.901 - 00:47:28.781, Speaker A: So I love that they're attacking the harder problem with largely speaking, a great user experience. So that's number one. Number two is clear purpose led by a brilliant founder. So you know, totally is open minded and has a clear vision for this project. And because of that I think the community has given him almost like a divine right. A founder that has the vast majority of the community that is behind his.
00:47:28.813 - 00:47:31.825, Speaker D: Vision so that they can execute it without interruption.
00:47:32.205 - 00:47:45.259, Speaker A: Whereas you know, Eth you could argue is kind of more has to worry about stepping on other projects toes or being stepped on. Number three is that the community, especially.
00:47:45.307 - 00:47:47.299, Speaker D: The research community, seems to be driven.
00:47:47.387 - 00:48:15.493, Speaker A: By practitioners, not so much like theoretical wonks. So lots of them have practical experience creating things that utilizes the chain's high performance and they're focusing on function, not esoteric economic ideas. So that's refreshing. And the fourth is just the commitment to push the envelope and look to.
00:48:15.509 - 00:48:16.925, Speaker D: Where the puck is moving.
00:48:17.045 - 00:48:28.157, Speaker A: And I guess that's Just a general comment that kind of wraps it up that we love the phone, we love the mobile stack, we love the vision that you're supposed to write code for.
00:48:28.181 - 00:48:30.773, Speaker D: How the chips are going to be in five years, not for how they're.
00:48:30.789 - 00:48:31.813, Speaker A: Going to be now.
00:48:31.989 - 00:48:33.953, Speaker D: And that's the vision that has enabled.
00:48:34.009 - 00:48:39.285, Speaker A: Companies like Nvidia to scale 100x. So looking forward to the next five years.
00:48:40.665 - 00:49:17.065, Speaker C: So maybe to kind of conclude things then. You've outlined some things you don't like about Solana. You've outlined some things you do like. I was looking at sort of the Vaneck research reports earlier. You said your base case, Solana takes up 30% market share, Ethereum 70%. What is the make or break for whether Solana kind of breaks through and becomes that 80% asset or is 30% or less? What is the key thing that's going to make or break the Solana network in the next 10 years?
00:49:17.565 - 00:49:42.913, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a good observation that we put out our Ethan Sol models pretty much right at the same time. And to get to our price targets, we had a much more conservative estimate for Solana where our base case was only based on a 30% market share. We've since suggested that just because of the fundamental momentum in the chain and we're now using comparable estimates of 70% market share.
00:49:43.089 - 00:49:45.465, Speaker D: And that's one reason why when Sol.
00:49:45.545 - 00:49:54.325, Speaker A: Flipped eth in my little strategy I respected the tape and did not rebalance aggressively.
00:49:57.505 - 00:50:13.115, Speaker C: And I guess is there anything about the networks where you're like this is going to determine can kind of Solana overcome the first mover advantage and smart contract blockchain world that Ethereum has.
00:50:15.375 - 00:50:17.287, Speaker D: It's going to come down to which.
00:50:17.351 - 00:50:31.999, Speaker A: App can onboard 50 million people. And for me right now the only like killer app in crypto is owning Bitcoin. Like that's the only thing where everyone who owns it kind of is mission.
00:50:32.047 - 00:50:33.911, Speaker D: Aligned on the same view that holding.
00:50:33.943 - 00:50:36.919, Speaker A: It is the use case with the.
00:50:36.967 - 00:50:42.391, Speaker D: Proof of stake chains. I think there's still a lot of kind of competing visions of how things.
00:50:42.423 - 00:50:50.463, Speaker A: Are going to shake out. And collectively stablecoins appear to be one of those killer apps. But I can't point you to a.
00:50:50.479 - 00:50:53.767, Speaker D: Fortune 1000 company that is now, you.
00:50:53.791 - 00:50:58.101, Speaker A: Know, has a direct Solana USDC relationship.
00:50:58.133 - 00:51:03.645, Speaker D: With their clients and are actually using smart contracts. So whoever can onboard the merchant that.
00:51:03.685 - 00:51:09.425, Speaker A: Makes that happen is going to be the winner. That's my guess, yeah.
00:51:10.485 - 00:51:29.205, Speaker C: Well, look Matthew, we're at time, but it's been a pleasure having you thank you for taking the time to swing by Lightspeed. Yeah, Please be in touch. Best of luck engaging with the SEC down the line and with your Solana Saga phone.
00:51:31.505 - 00:51:36.185, Speaker A: Jack. Thanks for the time. Yeah, thank you. Take care.
