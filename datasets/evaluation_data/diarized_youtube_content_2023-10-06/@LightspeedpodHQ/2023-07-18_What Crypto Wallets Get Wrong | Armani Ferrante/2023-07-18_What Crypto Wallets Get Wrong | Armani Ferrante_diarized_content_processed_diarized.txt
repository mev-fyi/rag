00:00:00.170 - 00:00:22.974, Speaker A: I think when we saw a bunch of the Solana ecosystem leaders move to other chains, the narrative was always, I'm going to ethereum, or I'm going to polygon. I'm moving. And in some cases, it was like, I'm removing all of my Solana association and replacing it with ethereum association, whatever. And to me, that's, like, totally the wrong way to think about it. It's like you don't want to replace one pie for another pie. You want to have both pies at the same time. Right.
00:00:22.974 - 00:00:29.720, Speaker A: Especially if you're a startup trying to grow. It's less about me going to other chains, and it's more about bringing other chains to us.
00:00:34.410 - 00:00:46.220, Speaker B: Hey, everybody. Welcome to the first episode of Lightspeed. Today we are joined by Armani Ferrante, the founder behind Backpack Xnfts, madlads, Coral, and Anchor development Framework. Guy's a beast. Armani, welcome to the show.
00:00:46.590 - 00:00:48.042, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks so much for having me.
00:00:48.096 - 00:01:01.520, Speaker B: I want to get right into it. We're the gatekeepers of the crypto ecosystem, which are wallets today. When you think about wallets, often people relate to MetaMask, Phantom, Kepler, there's a few others, all competing to win the end user relationship. What do people misunderstand about?
00:01:01.890 - 00:01:32.890, Speaker A: Oh, great question. What do people misunderstand about think? I don't know if people misunderstand anything in particular, but I do think there are some maybe unfulfilled responsibilities of most wallets. I think a wallet is basically the gateway. It's the entry point to any l One ecosystem. And l One is only as good as its best wallet. Right. You bring up MetaMask as an example, not to be too harsh on them, but I think it's important for wallets to evolve at the same pace that the ecosystem evolves at.
00:01:32.890 - 00:02:12.470, Speaker A: And I think in the Solana ecosystem, anatoly is constantly talking about Solana in the context of some constantly evolving open source software, not something that ossifies, right? And so there's constantly new protocols that are being created, new things like priority fees, new things like NFT protocols, interfaces, Das standards, all of these things, right? And I think that it's a wall's responsibility to keep up. And I think that's one of the most not misunderstood things, but one of the least talked about things, about the growth potential of any given l One ecosystem.
00:02:12.890 - 00:02:49.506, Speaker C: So it seems like you're basically saying that l One is going to move fast. Right. And it's on the wallet to kind of keep up with those futures, to really showcase the chain. Otherwise, you're kind of falling behind. And I think we've seen this on Solana, and I think probably one thing that helps a lot with that is the fact that backpack is actually open source and so people can actually make contributions. Was that the main kind of driver behind that decision, or what do you think? Because there has been some successful wallets without open source support on Solana as well. What do you think? The reason there is I think a.
00:02:49.528 - 00:03:14.902, Speaker A: Lot of people misunderstand my view or take on open source. I actually don't really care if things are open source or not. I care a lot about honesty and consistency. And so you have to keep in mind that, well, the wallet is the central touch point. It's the central piece of point of trust in a crypto ecosystem. It's like, okay, sure, the core protocol has to be safe and secure. Smart contracts have to be safe and secure.
00:03:14.902 - 00:03:58.934, Speaker A: But really, the wallet is the thing that's managing the private keys. And when you sign something, you're putting all of your eggs into that basket. And so if we're going to go out and promote these permissionless systems, well, it's pretty important to know what the wallet is doing. And so from that point of view, it's quite valuable for a wallet to be open source or not even open source source available. And that is the reason why we started with backpack being kind of having a source available. If it wasn't in crypto, if we were building a wallet for, I don't know, Apple Visa or Mastercard or whatever, it probably wouldn't be open source. But it really is just about this point of intellectual honesty and consistency with what we're building.
00:03:58.934 - 00:04:01.802, Speaker A: And that's really where it's coming from.
00:04:01.936 - 00:04:16.960, Speaker B: Yeah, armani on that. I want to get into backpack, and I really like how you describe how being a wallet as they are today is almost table stakes, and you relate that to the iPhone. I'm wondering if you can describe that analogy that you have for the audience and then give us a high level what backpack is.
00:04:17.890 - 00:04:48.902, Speaker A: Yeah, so, I mean, the story I like to give is when the iPhone first came out, how is Steve Jobs talking about it? Right? He called it as I don't know, it's like this Internet computing advice. It's like, okay, well, what does that you know, you had phones at the time. You had blackberries. That was probably the closest thing to a smartphone. And it's like, okay, you can call and text people. It's like but that's not exactly right, because an iPhone could do so much more than just call and text people. You have this rich developer ecosystem.
00:04:48.902 - 00:05:16.562, Speaker A: You have an app store, you have browsers, you have the ability to access rich on device capabilities. And any one of those things can describe an iPhone, but none of them are necessarily correct. Like, Internet computing device. What does that mean? It's like a router. Is it a switch? It's not a browser, but there's a browser in it. It's like all these different things, right? And so you ask the question, well, what's an iPhone? Well, it's like, I don't know. You put all these things together and what comes out? It's like, I don't know, the iPhone comes out.
00:05:16.562 - 00:06:11.700, Speaker A: And I think that is kind of the orientation when thinking about kind of a wallet. Right. It's not like an asset manager, even though the majority of the value today comes from gaining access to your private keys and managing your tokens and your NFTs. But really what it is, it's like a blockchain computing device, if you want to call it that. Put in those terms, it's like the central touch point that gives you access to all of the data in the blockchain. Right. And so with Backpack, we've taken the approach where the starting goal is like thinking about how do we get every protocol and every blockchain inside of a single user interface and take this kind of iPhone esque approach where you can build an awesome flagship consumer kind of product and do it in a way that positions it more as a platform and as an open ecosystem that anybody can build on.
00:06:14.150 - 00:06:50.110, Speaker C: While we're on this topic, actually I do have, because you're obviously a pretty well known and let's say a founder, I align myself with a lot. I look up to you in most of your takes. One thing that's interesting and the fact that you mentioned Apple kind of brings me back to because I was actually at BlackBerry and BlackBerry was trying to compete with Apple, and obviously that didn't work out so well. Obviously wallets are super competitive right now, or maybe I don't know if competitive is the right word, but there's a lot of wallets out there. How do you, as a founder, think about competition broadly, but also specifically as it relates to wallets?
00:06:52.530 - 00:07:20.006, Speaker A: I think the name of the game is Demand generation. It doesn't matter what you're building. I think block space is abundant. I think there's a lot of incredible infrastructure out there nowadays, especially on Solana. But I think demand is, from my point of view, the thing that I've prioritized. It's like, how do you generate demand? And whoever can generate demand can operate in greenfield. And there's a ton of wallets out there.
00:07:20.006 - 00:07:57.560, Speaker A: There's a ton of NFT marketplaces out there. Those are kind of like the two products that I would point to as the single most competitive knife fights in crypto. That's because the barrier to entries of both of them are low. There's not really any moat in either of them. There's some distribution effects that's maybe hard to transfer your private keys over from MetaMask to phantom or from phantom to backpack or whatever, but you don't have to be competing like that. Right. I think it's pretty well understood that the number of users in crypto is relatively low when looking at the big flagship consumer applications in web two.
00:07:57.560 - 00:08:22.826, Speaker A: And so as a founder, it's always kind of maybe it hasn't always been. It is my view as of today that Peter Thiel is right and that competition is for losers and that we should be focusing all of our energy not on trying to kill our competitors, but on growing the pie, so to speak, if you want to put it in those terms. That's very much how I'm oriented, I don't know. As of right now.
00:08:22.928 - 00:08:40.754, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes sense. And you were talking about how wallets and talking about the iPhone and phone is the table stakes, but there's so much more to it. You talk about what you're doing at backpack to build that network similar to what the iPhone is, where it's not just a wallet, but it goes beyond that. And I think while you answer that, that will probably answer the question, why.
00:08:40.792 - 00:09:46.486, Speaker A: Would I choose Backpack as a user? Yeah, totally. I mean, the starting impetus of the entire project was really this concept of xnft where the idea is really simple, honestly, in my opinion, pretty unimaginative, where instead of just, like, tokenizing an image, we could tokenize code on chain applications or on chain WeChat mini programs, if you want to put it in those terms. WeChat is like the analogy everybody loves to use in Web Three, but let's just tokenize code and have a plugin system where you can have some nice set of APIs and build an application ecosystem around it's. As simple as that. And you have some nice primitives, right? You have key management as a primitive, the ability to sign transactions not just on solana, but anywhere. You have user identity, right? You have some addresses that are associated with you. You have your username, you have maybe a nice profile picture, maybe you have a social graph, right? You have friends, the ability to look, know, Mert and Garrett on a blockchain, see what their address is, maybe go look at their NFTs, maybe go propose to barter with them, maybe bid on one of their NFTs or something like that.
00:09:46.486 - 00:10:23.780, Speaker A: We could start building out this application ecosystem and make our Web Three experiences as rich or richer than we're used to on Web Two, right, where we're all in the same database, right? But none of the applications are built in a way that kind of leverages it. And so with Backpack and with the wallet, it's really taking the point of view that there should be much more UI level composability with heterogeneous protocols and apps on a blockchain than currently exists today.
00:10:25.430 - 00:10:52.890, Speaker C: So you are a very big proponent of distribution. So in the conversation of is it product or is it distribution, which one, as a founder, do you focus on? So you have this, know, distribution wins. Facebook was just a MySpace clone, which was just a Francis clone with novel distribution through universities and iteration along the way. Can you maybe talk to us about how you think about product and distribution, especially as how it relates to crypto and wallets?
00:10:53.050 - 00:11:47.690, Speaker A: I think there's many different ways to achieve distribution, and I think where that quote is coming from is I think a lot of there's a saying that I didn't make this up. Some thought leader VC in Silicon Valley made this up, where first time founders focus on product and second time founders focus on distribution, and I think that's very much how I feel. But I think also good product can lead to good distribution, particularly when you're operating, when you're a first mover operating in Greenfield, right? So Bitcoin got distribution because it was the first blockchain and now it's the most powerful meme. And it doesn't matter what you think about the tech, it doesn't matter if you think it's slow, it doesn't matter if you think it has any real world use case. It's not going to go anywhere. It's probably never going to go anywhere. It's the strongest brand in crypto, and that's because it has distribution on the meme.
00:11:47.690 - 00:12:13.030, Speaker A: And that's zero sum. There can't be another bitcoin. Some will try. There's some like meme coins. Maybe dogecoin is the closest thing where it was able to carve out its own meme, where it's not necessarily the decentralized censorship resistant store of value, but it's like the cute dog or whatever. We all kind of laugh and play and it moved. But I think both of those things are good examples of distribution winning.
00:12:13.030 - 00:12:56.802, Speaker A: That distribution happened because it was innovative, right? There were first movers, bitcoin was the first proof of work chain, and Dogecoin was the first meme coin. I think product is important, but with that said, I think very rarely does the first mover always win, right? I think in the context we're talking about that tweet in the context of threads, where a lot of people were looking at threads. And I doing what I did as a teenager when I saw MySpace, and when I saw Facebook come up, I was like, all my friends were going to Facebook. I'm like, why are all my friends going to Facebook? MySpace is great. It's a better product. We're all here. You can play music.
00:12:56.802 - 00:13:44.786, Speaker A: Facebook, you can't even play music, right? It's like, why are we doing the exact same thing but on another platform in a way that's maybe less compelling? I can't think of any good example, any good reason other than, well, that's what all the cool kids were doing, right? Because, I don't know, all the colleges were doing it. And so everybody moved over almost overnight. Honestly, that was probably like, that's burned into my head. I don't know why it is, but maybe I loved MySpace so much, I love music. And then I was like, really wanted my top eight profile and my carefully curated CSS to not go away. But I think it's super important. Why is threads useful? Or why is threads interesting? I think a lot of people are mid curbing it.
00:13:44.786 - 00:14:16.270, Speaker A: They're like, oh yeah, the network effects on Twitter. All the smart people are on Twitter, all of our followers on Twitter, let's just stay on Twitter. But it's like, no, it's missing the point. The reason why threads is really important is because you get this entirely new set of people that weren't otherwise using Twitter. Now exposed to this form factor. I think it's kind of safe to say that the set of people, at least in my network, the set of people that are using Twitter is mostly disjoint from the set of people using Instagram and Facebook. It's like very self selected group of weirdos that are in the Twitter sphere that I think we could all relate to.
00:14:16.270 - 00:15:17.440, Speaker A: Instagram is very flashy, right? You want to show know, look how awesome my life is. Twitter is like a war zone, right? We're all going to debate and get into fights with people that are anonymous on the exactly, you know, mert. But when threats came around, when I looked at it, I saw an opportunity to grow my own personal following and network, right, where like, oh, like all the people that use Instagram, they have no idea who I am, they have no idea what my tweets are. And we've sharpened our knives and trained with this interesting form factor and now it's being applied to this new network, right? Everybody on Facebook and Instagram. And so I saw that as like an opportunity to not kill Twitter, but to bootstrap off that existing network effect and apply the form factor to it. And to me, that's why it was exciting. It's like distribution at a new level, especially because Instagram and Facebook have, I don't know, at least an order of magnitude more users than Twitter does.
00:15:18.370 - 00:15:39.770, Speaker B: When you think about like, I just got a thread a few days ago and it's connected to your Instagram, which you see some people don't really like. Does it matter or not? How do you think about that in crypto? Because people talk about like, do you want to have one identity that's used across different apps? And it is true. Like, I'm a different person on Instagram than I am on Snapchat and on Twitter and LinkedIn. Is that something that you can do on backpack or how do you think that can work in crypto?
00:15:40.830 - 00:16:17.400, Speaker A: I think with backpack we took a very restrictive small first step where we said, let's just be pseudo anonymous and use NFTs only as profile picks. So it's very Twitter esque because that's a one way door. As soon as you start introducing real identity, you don't go back. And so that was kind of I wouldn't say I have like a super comprehensive view on what the correct answer is, but we very much are trying to keep our options open there. And NFTs and pseudo anonymity is what makes crypto special, I feel. So what makes the subculture unique. It might not always be that way, but it's certainly what makes it special today.
00:16:18.970 - 00:16:54.180, Speaker C: So while we're on the topic of maybe threads versus Twitter, I think maybe an interesting parallel is kind of multi chain versus picking a single chain. And while we're also on the topic of distribution, how do you think know as a obviously you're actually multi chain, you are on Solana and Ethereum, what do you think is the right thing to do in terms of distribution? Should the products go to different chains to increase their distribution or should their main goal be attracting people to come onto that chain? Because most people aren't in crypto to begin with.
00:16:55.590 - 00:17:46.526, Speaker A: I think mean not to throw too much shade at anybody in particular, but I think when we saw a bunch of the Solana ecosystem leaders move to other chains, the narrative was always I'm going to Ethereum or I'm going to Polygon, right? I'm moving. And in some cases it was like I'm removing all of my Solana association and replacing it with Ethereum association, whatever. And to me that's totally the wrong way to think about it. It's like you don't want to replace one pie for another pie. You want to have both pies at the same time, especially if you're a startup trying to grow. And so from my point of view, it's less about me going to other chains and it's more about like, well, bringing other chains to us. Right? And you saw this with the Mad Lads Drop where we got a bunch of folks from Ethereum just because we started in Ethereum.
00:17:46.526 - 00:18:42.766, Speaker A: We know a lot of folks in Ethereum and we had them come to Backpack, get some soul, download the app and mint and that's because they thought madlads was cool. Backpack was an interesting experiment and we want to bring them to us, right? And so I think that is like the moral orientation. And maybe the best product that you see this in is just exchanges. Nobody views Coinbase as like an Ethereum or a Bitcoin or a Solana project, right? It's just coinbase. And I think that's the positioning that people should take, especially with NFT projects. I feel like NFTs in mean, I guess there is a lot of tribalism, but I feel like the biggest NFT projects won't be associated with any given. Like if Disney wanted to create an NFT project, it'd be the biggest NFT project in the world and nobody would view it as like an Ethereum thing or a Solana thing, they would just view it as Disney.
00:18:42.766 - 00:18:51.080, Speaker A: And I think that's the scale that you need to get to if you're like a venture backed startup. And that's not really a way that a lot of people are oriented today.
00:18:51.690 - 00:19:13.820, Speaker B: On that thought, on distribution, what do you think Backpack's key feature is to win? I don't know if it'd be users from MetaMask or the new users that come into the ecosystem. And to me, I think maybe part of that is I've heard you say that mobile is like the most important computing paradigm that exists right now. And then that's something that it seems that Backpacks focus on, that other wallets like MetaMask are maybe missing out.
00:19:14.830 - 00:19:51.458, Speaker A: Yeah, I think getting distributed there's a bunch of novel ways to get distribution, but it basically boils down to how do you get people into crypto that aren't currently in crypto? That's basically what you want to do. And I think there's a bunch of different ways. We've been thinking about it. The first way was like, all right, let's just experiment with wacky new ideas like x, NFT. So it's like the first wacky new idea. Mad Lads was like the second big component to that, where we thought to ourselves, all right, let's just try to build a native web3 kind of brand, but then let's throw out the whole web3 part and let's just build a normal brand. Let's build our own version of Red Bull.
00:19:51.458 - 00:20:37.238, Speaker A: And then if that's dope and cool and we have cool content and we have a bunch of people that like, I don't know, big wave surfing and jackass content and motocross and snowboarding and stuff like this, then they'll probably also like crypto as well. And let's introduce them to the crypto part later. But let's separate the brand, separate the brand from backpack and spin off mad Lads. It's in the same company, same set of people, but we very intentionally separated those two things so that we can get distribution on a non crypto level and then use that as like a top of funnel to bring down into crypto. And that was like a very intentional thing. NFTs is kind of its own world and its own kind of strategic considerations and its own storytelling and its own form of marketing and building product and stuff like that, of that. But I think that was one small example of something that we start to do.
00:20:37.238 - 00:20:59.726, Speaker A: And so that's kind of like running as its own kind of life form at this point. And then there's a bunch of kind of other new product things. Like, you got to build new things that have never been done before. That's basically what it comes down to. If you're building things that have been done before, you're wasting your time. And the wallet is very much just like the table stake starting point for a lot of this stuff. So things like soul abstraction are like new ideas, right, where it's like, all right, well, we have all these things.
00:20:59.726 - 00:21:44.714, Speaker A: We have smart contracts, we have a wallet, we have X, NFTs. What happens when you put all three of those things together and then out of that you need all three of those things to get sole traction? I can talk about that later. These are kind of like what were some of the first early ideas. And we certainly haven't succeeded. We haven't gotten to the point that we want to get to yet. But this is certainly how we're thinking about it. And there's a bunch of other miscellaneous kind of experiments that we're trying to kind of do to kind of figure out how we can build new things, right? Things like the social graph on backpack, things like messaging, things like NFT, gated group chats, all these kind of basic things that are valuable from the point of view of less of I'm trying to beat Telegram, and more of coming at it from the perspective of like, oh, I'm already on a blockchain.
00:21:44.714 - 00:22:10.360, Speaker A: I already have a wallet. How can I make use of that to do things like, I don't know, peer to peer? NFT barter right. And so it's like these kind of new products that not a lot of people have really done before, surprisingly. And so, yeah, I mean, there's a bunch of stuff that's coming out, like, in the next year that we're working on, like new product experiments. There's a couple of no brainer things, I think, that if you think about it really hard in the context of a wallet will pop out of your head.
00:22:14.010 - 00:22:26.386, Speaker B: Everyone, we get back to the show in a minute, but I want to let you know that we got our permissionless conference coming up. Start conference with Bankless. That's the biggest and best conference in DFI. It's going to be in Austin, Texas this year. Yep. I know you love it. They got Tacos Barbecue Barn Springs.
00:22:26.386 - 00:22:52.046, Speaker B: We got it all September 11 through the 13th. Been in Crypto for a while. Know that the bear market conferences are the best conferences because those are the ones where all the alphas had. The people that are still in crypto all really want to be there. It's going to be great for building a network, for learning a lot. And look, we've got a phenomenal lineup of speakers that include people like Hasu Sani, Christine Moy, and Kyle Simani talking about ZK Tech roll ups, account abstraction, mev, app chains, and more. Look, I'm damn excited because you're a listener of Lightspeed.
00:22:52.046 - 00:23:16.166, Speaker B: You're going to get a special discount. Type in discount code, Lightspeed 30, and you'll get 30% off your ticket. That's right. Just type in Lightspeed 30 when buying a permissionless ticket and get 30% off. Click the link at the bottom of this episode and go get it now because prices are going up every two weeks. All right, back to the show. So you have Saga and you have an App Store, and you can develop apps there for crypto projects, and then you have X NFTs.
00:23:16.166 - 00:23:51.480, Speaker B: And I think I've heard you say that X NFTs could show up in that App Store as well. Like, it just wouldn't be on Backpack. I guess if you have an X NFT of a project or a protocol, and then you also have a native app to say something like an iOS or like, why would you use the X NFT? Why would you use the Backpack scenario? Because I've heard I don't know if he's the founder or one of the people that worked on the Saga phone. He talks about how native apps can take advantage of the iPhone capabilities and so forth that Xnfts can't. So I'm just curious how you think about that on how a native app versus an X NFT would win and why you would pick one or the.
00:23:52.810 - 00:24:07.626, Speaker A: I mean, they're definitely not mutually exclusive. I mean, all an Xnft is it's a special file format. That's it. An NFT is just a file. And what's in that file and what it points to is more or less up to you, I think. It can be a native app. It can be a website.
00:24:07.626 - 00:24:44.550, Speaker A: It can be your Oculus Goggle binary. It can be your Apple CarPlay kind of system. It's up to you. I think the main difference at the product level is that Xnfts, as they're currently built, auto connect the wallet, so you remove that point of friction. But beyond that, maybe the best analogy is thinking about native iOS Android apps versus WeChat mini programs. That's basically what it right where you have apps that hook into something, an existing ecosystem, or Facebook games, or Facebook plugins, messaging plugins, Imessage plugins. Those are all X NFTs.
00:24:44.550 - 00:24:54.458, Speaker A: And that's more or less how I think about the difference between the two. But they're more or less isomorphic if you want them to be nice.
00:24:54.544 - 00:24:55.990, Speaker C: Big word isomorphic.
00:24:56.070 - 00:24:58.460, Speaker B: Yeah, I like that. We need to drop a few more of those.
00:24:59.870 - 00:25:10.990, Speaker C: Well, so you just mentioned or not just mentioned, but you just talked about how you guys actually started in Ethereum and then kind of came over to Salana. So let's kind of dig into that. Why Salana?
00:25:13.730 - 00:25:43.466, Speaker A: Okay, so context came into crypto. I think 2017 started on Ethereum, started working on L two S. Was really interested in scaling solutions right at the time. Ethereum, the whole concept of world computer is like, the coolest idea ever. Just brought in every kind of engineer into the space. I was interested in making computers go fast, and at the time, a bunch of L ones got funded. Salana was one of those because the prospect and idea of a world computer was, like, the most exciting thing at the time.
00:25:43.466 - 00:26:09.534, Speaker A: But it was very much an unfulfilled dream. And so the Ethereum community started thinking about all this stuff, namely started thinking in two directions. The first direction was Sharding, and the second direction was L two S. I pretty quickly didn't like the idea of Sharding for various reasons. Don't have to go into them. But I thought l two S are pretty cool. So I started exploring and learning about L two S and started looking into state channels, looking into plasma.
00:26:09.534 - 00:27:03.854, Speaker A: These are kind of things that were like kind of the early ideas that were the precursors into what became roll ups, which is now like the dominant kind of Ethereum scaling narrative at this point. And I thought to myself, well, there's I don't know. Got to be other more traditional ways of doing this. I felt like, in hindsight, I think a lot of the ideas at the time were thinking about all of this. Crazy new language like crypto economics and fraud proofs and all this crazy stuff at the Times, but nobody was thinking, oh, how do we just build a parallel transaction processing system like every other database in the world uses? And so started looking for kind of like, new L ones. About that time, the first one that I found was Oasis. Oasis was a company that spun out of a research group at Berkeley.
00:27:03.854 - 00:28:11.574, Speaker A: And the whole idea there was, well, sharding has fixed scaling throughput, right? Because you can't shard a shard. Eventually, if you have a fixed number of shards, it's a constant sized performance input, and then that's the upper bound, and you don't go beyond that, right? And so they thought, okay, well, instead of scaling with sharding, what if you scale with multiple different tendermint committees and then you have linear sharding, linear scaling with respect to these groups, and as long as the rewrite sets don't conflict, then you get, like, infinite scaling. And that was the first kind of idea. I was like, oh, yeah, that's a pretty cool idea. That sounds like, morally speaking, the right way to think about it, right? Scaling in every other sense of the term is linear. It's not like some constant increase. And so that was the first kind of company I joined that was, like, outside the Ethereum ecosystem, where we were exploring these kind of new ideas that didn't work out for a bunch of reasons.
00:28:11.574 - 00:28:36.130, Speaker A: Turns out building L ones is really hard, and building startups are really hard. And then Solana was the next one that I saw that had this same property, except it was linear with respect to hardware and using kind of these kind of more traditional kind of systems techniques. And that was basically what drew me to it at the beginning.
00:28:39.990 - 00:29:09.740, Speaker C: When you joined, it was the early days, right? There was nobody there. Just everything was pretty awful. And you were kind of like I remember you had a tweet about, if you're at the stage where the docs are already there, you're too late. This is kind of the opportunity. Why did you stick around? Why were you like, okay, I'm going to build anchor for this network. I believe in it. Is it just because Tolle is very handsome? What is the rationale why'd you stick around?
00:29:10.770 - 00:29:45.960, Speaker A: That is a great question. Okay, so people seem to forget how extraordinary the initial conditions for salana are. They're, like, truly incredible. Like, very hard to recreate, might be impossible to recreate. So the historical context is about, I think, when I started paying attention, it was summer 2020. DFI summer. This was the start of the last major bull market where we were riding off of the extreme moral lows of the bear market.
00:29:45.960 - 00:30:10.634, Speaker A: 2017. 2018 were great times. 2019 started to get scary, and basically everybody started leaving crypto and that bear market. I don't know if you guys remember this. It felt morally so much worse than this bear market. It felt like we weren't sure if this thing is actually going to actually stay around. Now it's like, okay, we all kind of know crypto is not going anywhere.
00:30:10.634 - 00:31:11.938, Speaker A: There's people that like to say mean things online, but it's too big at this point to where the cat's out of the back. But it really felt like this isn't going anywhere. And then DeFi summer happened, and everyone and seemingly their mother were yield farming, know, and SBF in particular had this incredible saga with the sushi swap vampire attack, and then chef nomi and maki's kind of chef nomi, I guess, fall from grace, right, where they successfully vampire attack, uniswap. Sushi swap goes to the moon, everybody loves it. And then all of a sudden, the founder seemingly, then, you know, SBF is like the prince of crypto at the time. It's crazy to say this out loud, it's absolutely insane to say this out loud, but this is what people were thinking. It's like, at the time, he was the god.
00:31:11.938 - 00:32:23.222, Speaker A: Everybody loved him. Everybody was talking about him as the savior of DeFi summer and crypto, right? He's this genius kind of trader that was yield farming to valhalla and making all this work. Before FTX started, I was actually at alameda for three months. So between my time leaving apple and going into ethereum land, I had this like three month stint where when alameda was very first getting started trading in crypto, I was working on the trading systems there. I left because I was more interested in working on ethereum than I was in building a market maker. But I digress anyway. I particularly saw this at the time, and it was like this incredible thing where we're back, the bull market seems to be coming back, and this thing called solana was created, right? And the promise at the time was an on chain, decentralized, censorship resistant, immutable nasdaq.
00:32:23.222 - 00:32:55.630, Speaker A: And that was just like the coolest thing ever. It's like, okay, uniswap was the big thing at the time. Sushi swap came around. It showed how much excitement and passion there was for DeFi. Everybody was yield farming, but we can bring this up a whole nother level by using order books. Like AMMS are capital inefficient order books is like what the regular world uses. Everybody that was interested in trading and was taking a look at kind of DeFi was like, well, why don't these things exist? And it turned out, well, you need a fast blockchain, and that blockchain now exists.
00:32:55.630 - 00:33:46.120, Speaker A: And so this was the narrative at the time that was just super exciting. It brought in so many people from TradFi, people not only from DeFi on ethereum, but also people from jump came in. Folks from citadel came in. All these more traditional trading firms just started kind of looking at the space and people a lot of really smart engineers started looking at solana for this reason, it's very different now than it was back then, but now it's like Solana is very much an NFT chain. But back then it was very much like people who identified as traders went to Salana to explore DFI and you had this incredibly well capitalized backer, right, that invested heavily into the chain. SBF was on Twitter saying, I'll buy all your soul at $3. Give it to me or fuck off, or whatever.
00:33:46.120 - 00:34:15.150, Speaker A: He was the golden child of the industry, pumping all of this capital and time into Solana. I don't know, it was just like a really special point in time for a new network. I mean, in hindsight, again, it's crazy to say that with everything that we know today, but at the time, if you put yourselves in the shoes of the regular person in crypto, this was a really magical kind of six month period where everything kind of started.
00:34:15.300 - 00:34:28.674, Speaker B: You talked about how when Anatolia was first building Solana, it was positioned as a Nasdaq on chain, and you just said that now it's an NFT chain. In a way. Is that how you think Solana should position itself? Or what do you think the branding is for Solana? Because it seemed to change over the last year.
00:34:28.792 - 00:34:52.054, Speaker A: I kind of fundamentally believe that you don't choose Product Market Fit. Product market. Fit chooses you. And that very much is what happened with NFTs, especially given the network downtime. Like, DeFi just doesn't work if the network's down. I mean, that's been changing significantly over the past year. There's been a ton of really incredible improvements to the core network, where DFI 2.0,
00:34:52.054 - 00:35:37.560, Speaker A: as people are calling it on Twitter these days, is coming back on Salana, and I think we'll see a rebirth. I mean, I'm optimistic. Who knows what will happen, but I would love to see a rebirth and resurgence and energy being put into it, because I do think that recreating all of the very flawed economic engines of the world on something like a blockchain just makes a ton of sense. And so I do think we'll see that change over time. But NFTs were just so exciting and it was such a great way to get people into crypto that it chose Solana because it was fast. Right? And I think it's hard to say what will happen in the future, but I think there's a lot of desire to bring DeFi back.
00:35:38.430 - 00:36:21.766, Speaker C: You said product market fit chooses you right. It's like maybe the wand in Harry Potter. What do you think about Metaplex? Just for some context for the reader or listeners? Metaplex, I'm just going to do a quick crash course here. On Ethereum, you have standards and interfaces and the NFT standard is shared interface that anybody can kind of inherit from. But on Solana, you have kind of these centralization risks with one program kind of controlling the entire landscape until interfaces go live. And to date, all NFTs on Solana have went through the Metaplex program. So that's kind of metaplex's role in this.
00:36:21.766 - 00:36:30.220, Speaker C: So what do you think about them? Do you think they've done a good job so far? How would you like to see the Solana NFT ecosystem evolve going forward?
00:36:31.710 - 00:37:29.418, Speaker A: I think that they built something that became so popular that it outgrew them. That's basically how I feel about it. And it exposed not a problem with them. It exposed a problem with Solana, which is that Solana does not have either the tooling or the social processes to create robust interfaces, which is a super important piece of social technology as much as it is a piece of developer technology, to be able to solve a lot of these messy human level problems. I don't think any of us on the network think that it's a good idea that a single for profit entity can control the asset standard for the entire ecosystem of players. Right. It just creates so many problems, especially when you're trying to build a competitive business that might be competing with the owner of that.
00:37:29.418 - 00:38:12.506, Speaker A: This is maybe a point that is often overlooked, but a lot of people think that open source happens because people want to feel warm and fuzzy inside. Open source often happens. There's some people that are passionate about it, and there's incredible folks like, I don't know, Free Software Foundation that fundamentally believe that it's important. But it really comes down to incentives, I feel, where if you want a bunch of competitive, disparate businesses like, let's say, Google, Apple, Mozilla, et cetera, Brave, you need neutral standards so that they can put the future of their business on it. Right. They can bet on it. They know it's not going to get pulled out from under them in an anti competitive way.
00:38:12.506 - 00:38:45.166, Speaker A: And only with that can you have buy in. And I think that's super important, and that is the piece that was missing, and that Metaplex or all of the associated metaplex problems exposed on Solana. And I think the solutions are there. I think we just need to execute on them as an ecosystem. And I don't think it was anything specific to them other than they just ended up being so freaking successful, or at least NFTs ended up being so freaking successful.
00:38:45.358 - 00:38:59.750, Speaker B: Yeah. Is it right just for people that don't understand interfaces and we won't go into it too much, but without an interface that's adopted throughout the ecosystem right now, if you launch an Ft and you don't do it through metaplex, it just won't even show up on Magic Eden, for example.
00:38:59.820 - 00:39:02.860, Speaker A: Is that right? Yeah, that's right.
00:39:04.910 - 00:39:36.660, Speaker B: I think one thing that would be interesting to me is you were working on Ethereum or in theorem ecosystem. I think that'd be back in 2018, 19. And that was when the state channels and L two S were really just in ethereum. Right. And L two S today are launched and they have a high TVL, but they're still on training wheels. How do you feel differently about Ethereum now? Like, if you were building in that ecosystem today, do you still think that you would go over to Salana? Because I've heard you mention you think app chains could be like the future of many scaled applications and Cosmos embraces that idea. Do you think Ethereum has that right now and it just didn't at the time?
00:39:37.510 - 00:40:31.926, Speaker A: Yeah, I think mean, I'm very far removed from the state of the art thinking over there, but from my point of view, they very much have pivoted into this very cosmos esque view of the world, where you have this global settlement layer and then a bunch of disparate roll ups on top that all checkpoint and use the settlement layer for things like data availability and fraud proofs and all that stuff. And it's funny, everybody in Solana thinks I'm a multi chain masky. Everybody on other chains think I'm a Solana maxi. But I really love the Cosmos, this view of the world. I very much view the end state for all of the biggest applications to be their own. I don't know what you call it, app chain or roll up or whatever. I feel like that's just a very nice thing to do.
00:40:31.926 - 00:41:34.518, Speaker A: It's like if I have something brand new, maybe it's like an MMORPG, maybe it's a big social network, maybe it's an exchange. There's going to be a lot of unique idiosyncrasies that I'm going to need out of either the runtime or the consensus mechanism, or just like the properties of the underlying blockchain, where it makes a lot of sense sometimes to have your own infrastructure layer that optimizes for it, right? Like blockchains, there's databases, right? It's like Kafka. But instead of being fault tolerant, it's like Byzantine fault tolerant. Right. And you don't choose a database when building an app based on it's not like a branding question, right? It's, what is the set of trade offs in the design space that I need question, and different things will give you different trade offs. And this is so trite at this point, especially for a lot of us in the Solana ecosystem, because there's not a lot of maximalism. But I think this is why I really love the Cosmos view of the world.
00:41:34.518 - 00:41:43.386, Speaker A: It's like, yeah, if I need to customize something, I'm going to go do it, and I'm going to do it with my own chain. And I think it makes a ton of sense. So I don't know, it's pretty simple as that. Not particularly creative, though.
00:41:43.488 - 00:41:55.650, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess when you say that though, then, what do you think about the future of Salana in that? And I know that's like a long time away, but it's a global state, doesn't have to do with app chains. There is the SVM on things like Eclipse and so forth. So yeah, I'm just curious.
00:41:56.950 - 00:42:31.754, Speaker A: I think there will be a couple huge L ones with huge network effects with very specific use cases. I don't think you're going to have a big MMO on Salana. I think if there's a big MMO like World of Warcraft, it'll probably be a separate chain. Maybe you put the economy on there or something. Maybe you do like gold or you put the auction house there. But I digress. I said this when I was talking with Austin Federa the other day.
00:42:31.754 - 00:43:03.298, Speaker A: I do think one interesting way to think about it is in the context of the programming model. So the reason why something like Solana is so compelling as a like it's so compelling if I just have to have a smart contract and a helios subscription, that's it. That's all I need. And I can build applications that transfer billions of dollars all around the world. permissionlessly. Verifiably. That is incredible.
00:43:03.298 - 00:44:03.734, Speaker A: That really is a superpower. It's like maybe one good mental model for thinking about technology is thinking about how it leverages a single developer. And if you look at the progression of all the tools that have been built over the past, I don't know, 30 to 50 years, I'm going to say 30 years because I'm 31 years old. If you take a look at it, it's like every year a single developer can do more and more and more all by himself and grow faster and faster and right. You probably used to have to know millions of dollars to be able to build something like a Facebook or a Google or whatever, right? Facebook had to literally build their own databases and manage hardware in their own data centers and do all this crazy stuff right now. You could just literally ship a rust binary, put it onto a blockchain and it just works. It doesn't go down.
00:44:03.734 - 00:44:52.598, Speaker A: You don't have to worry about fault tolerance. You don't have to worry about I mean, you have to worry about the smart contract and make sure that there's no exploits and that's hard and that's its own set of challenges. But you don't have to think about all the infrastructure. And that serverless model is so empowering for a developer, especially if you're building anything remotely related to asset ownership or economic value transfer, that I don't think that's going to go away. And a single global state machine is super compelling from that point of view. And I think it's pretty obvious that we'll have both. And I think systems like roll ups and app chains are just super compelling, but for different reasons.
00:44:52.598 - 00:45:49.290, Speaker A: To me, they're not compelling for scaling reasons. They're compelling from the point of view of I want to iterate and build new things that have never been done before. How do I tweak this to customize the VM or have my own state logic in a way that I don't have to go to the base layer and have lobby the fire dancer and Solana and Mango team to all implement this the way I want. Right? If I want to have every single smart contract on my network be open source and Verifiable, I can do that. Right? And I can just fork Cosmos or whatever and make that happen. But that is much more of a, I don't know, business product selling point than it is a scaling selling point. I think Coinbase's l Two is, like, a great example.
00:45:49.290 - 00:46:10.820, Speaker A: That's basically my view of the world. That just wraps it up right there. I don't view L2 S as going to be like platforms or ecosystems by themselves. I mean, there are some, like, Arbitrum and optimism. I think they do incredible job, especially at the social level of getting people excited and stuff like that. But as a developer, what Coinbase is doing very much resonates with me.
00:46:12.150 - 00:46:41.790, Speaker C: So you're referring to just for people who don't have context. Armand is referring to base Coinbase's New L two. It is weird how bad of a job we've done marketing to developers, right. You can write a few lines of code and you can move money at the speed of light with no permission and compose with anybody else. I do wonder what we've gotten wrong there. But maybe on that train of thought, what is something that we should be talking about more in solana? That's just completely under the radar.
00:46:47.960 - 00:46:50.070, Speaker A: I wouldn't say I have a good answer to that.
00:46:51.240 - 00:46:52.660, Speaker C: What about in crypto?
00:46:57.080 - 00:47:09.870, Speaker B: And Armani just is still one of your Tweets. You said, If I've learned anything from the past six years in this industry, it's that when people scoff at something, you should probably pay attention to it. What's something that people are scoffing at in crypto that they should pay attention to?
00:47:12.240 - 00:47:42.464, Speaker A: Yeah. These are all the hard questions. Yeah. I think that Tweet was coming from a place where I have personally, I feel like most developers can this will resonate with them, where I see a lot of stuff and I'm so smart and experienced as a developer that I know the entirety of mankind's knowledge and I know what a future and stuff like that. Right. But I personally have seen a lot of things. I saw it with NFTs, where I look at it, I'm like, oh, this is dumb.
00:47:42.464 - 00:48:22.284, Speaker A: I'm not getting involved with this. This is so dumb. And you see these toys, whether it's something like seeing an AMM for the first time or seeing an NFT for the first time, or seeing something like Bitcoin ordinals for the first time, where it's very easy to have a knee jerk reaction. I personally have had my own share of knee jerk reactions. I will continue to have my own set of knee jerk reactions, but it's easy to write it off. But it turns out there's like, a lot of these things that are just imperfect at the time end up being really good ideas. And I've just seen it time and time again with ideas in crypto.
00:48:22.284 - 00:49:01.008, Speaker A: Solana was like, maybe a great example of this. When I came to Solana for the first time, it was just a constant battle on Twitter where people are making fun of us. It still is. It's still a constant battle on Twitter where people are like, it's dumb, it's decentralized, it goes down. Nobody's going to use rust, Anatole's hair looks funny. I don't know what people want to say, but whether it's NFTs or L ones or money at the speed of light, if people are using stuff, there tends to be something interesting. And I think it's worth spending the time to explore what those interesting things are.
00:49:01.008 - 00:49:03.490, Speaker A: So anyway, well put.
00:49:04.020 - 00:49:20.900, Speaker C: Okay, I'm going to completely pivot off of crypto, and this is a question I've been meaning to ask because I found that the best way to piss people off on Twitter is to say working hard is good. What are your thoughts on work life balance?
00:49:24.710 - 00:50:29.542, Speaker A: I feel the problem with these conversations is two things. The first thing is people tend to be prescriptive where they think of it in terms of what's right and what's wrong and what I should be doing versus what others should be doing. And the simple answer to that is like, there's no right answer, right? Everybody is different and it's all about context and what is your goal, what are you trying to do? And if your goal is to build a billion dollar startup, that's very different than if your goal is to just be happy. Those are two very different things. I think people just aren't really easily people don't put it in those terms, right? And that's like kind of how Twitter is designed. They just want to maximize chaos. But once you start putting it in that context and you can have these conversations that are much more, you know, for us, we're a venture backed startup.
00:50:29.542 - 00:51:05.540, Speaker A: Our goal is to build kind of fundamental kind of improvements that change the world, right? And if that's your goal, and if you are competing against a bunch of other people that also have that same goal, that are also really smart, well, the fact of the matter is some people are just going to work harder than you, and they might be smarter than you, and they're going to do everything in their power to beat you. Some people are just wired like that. I'm charging my computer right now, so I apologize so it doesn't go out. And I think people have this.
00:51:07.350 - 00:51:07.618, Speaker C: I.
00:51:07.624 - 00:51:39.566, Speaker A: Don'T know what it is, I don't know if it's like insecurity or what, but they hear these things and they're like, well, if I'm not working really hard, the problem is not with me, the problem is with you. And I think that's kind of where it comes from. I don't have work life balance. I'm not going to pretend like I do. I don't tell other people to not have work life balance, but I definitely don't. I work all day every day, seven days a week, every waking moment of the day. But I don't think that's like, the right thing for everybody to do.
00:51:39.566 - 00:52:02.600, Speaker A: It's kind of just like how I've always been and how I'm wired. And it's funny because people will tell you, like, oh, yeah, you'll burn out or whatever. And I was like, no, I've been like this my entire life and I haven't burnt out. I don't know what's worse, like, you telling people to work too much or other people telling you to not work. And the fact of the matter is, if you're happy, you're happy and nobody has the answer right? And it's really as simple as that.
00:52:03.290 - 00:52:18.540, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that question is probably asked a lot out of insecurity. Either way, a lot of people feel they work too much or too less, and so, yeah, it's an insecurity question. If you weren't working in crypto, you obviously like to build things all the time. 24/7. What else would you be working in?
00:52:19.390 - 00:52:26.654, Speaker A: The answer is so ridiculous. It's just so obvious, right? It's like AI, obviously. Yeah, fair enough.
00:52:26.692 - 00:52:32.670, Speaker B: Do you think AI and crypto actually have like, do you think that's going to come to fruition or do you think it's way overblown right now?
00:52:32.820 - 00:52:53.190, Speaker A: Feel like it's overblown, but they solve different problems, right? I think AI is like the other obviously most I mean, in 2017, it was the most exciting thing in addition to crypto, and in 2023, whatever date year it is, I lose track of time. It continues to be the most exciting thing alongside crypto.
00:52:54.170 - 00:52:59.210, Speaker C: What are your thoughts on working in remote or in person versus remote?
00:53:00.110 - 00:53:46.086, Speaker A: My thoughts on this have significantly updated since running a company. I think for developers, being remote is totally fine, especially if you've worked on a lot of open source. But part of running a company is figuring out things along the way. It's like you almost never know the problem that you're solving until you actually start solving it. And opportunity is inherently temporal. The story I like to tell to my team is opportunity is like these windows of time that open up. It's like an Ephemeral Pokemon, if you want to use that analogy, where it pops up out of nowhere and you have some fixed period of time to capture it.
00:53:46.086 - 00:54:51.286, Speaker A: And if you don't capture the Pokemon before it disappears, you'll never capture it again. And it doesn't matter how hard you work, it doesn't matter how good the product is. If you do it a second after the Pokemon disappears, you're not catching that Pokemon. And so time is everything. And not only time, but also all of the micro decisions that you make all day, every day. You do, like, make a million different decisions, right? Should I be talking to the person next to me? Should I be reviewing code? Should I just be force pushing the Master? Should I be reverting this PR? What should I be working on? Should I be focusing on iOS? Should I be focusing on making the system go fast? Should I be sitting in discord getting people hyped? Should I be thinking about the new Mints? Should I be trying to get BD partnerships and getting people excited? You don't know what to work on, right? And in order for you to actually make good decisions, you need to have all that business context. And so if you know what you're doing, I'll priori and you can have a nice year long roadmap where you are figuring where you know everything and you just need to execute.
00:54:51.286 - 00:55:32.970, Speaker A: And I think for some things, like I think building an L one blockchain that's 100 X faster than the next thing was probably fit in that category. But for other things where you're trying to find product market fit, that's a lot less objective and a lot more escapable, I think being in person is just a huge advantage to me. It's like not even close. And I think there are some of our best engineers are remote, no doubt about it, and they would be less productive if they were in person, for sure. But I think for a lot of folks, particularly non engineers, being in person is just such a huge advantage.
00:55:34.190 - 00:55:49.950, Speaker C: That makes a lot of sense. You're obviously CEO backpack and you just said your views on this topic have changed since before starting and after. What are some leadership lessons you've learned along the way since starting backpack?
00:55:53.270 - 00:56:42.090, Speaker A: I think there's a lot of boring things mechanically on how to motivate people and get productivity out of people that are maybe less interesting. I think the main big thing is that you actually don't know what you're building until you just start building. And the starting point is just like an excuse. We built backpack as an excuse to start building stuff, right? And it's not about where you start, it's about the million decisions and pivots that you make along the way to end up in a good spot. And I think that is the main thing. So yeah, there's a million wallets out there. But if you want to build a wallet, you should just build a wallet.
00:56:42.090 - 00:57:17.500, Speaker A: Because the point is not going to be the wallet. The point is what comes as you build the wallet and all the things that you learn along that way. I think that's probably the biggest thing, which is like maybe counterintuitive, but it's definitely, I think, been a big lesson. The big factor is when you raise money. That's the big thing. The challenge is when a lot of people, when you raise money without having that big kind of compelling idea that you have high conviction on and at that point, then that's when the ordering of operations matters a bunch there.
00:57:21.150 - 00:57:54.402, Speaker B: Sorry to cut you off there. I was. Going to say, we felt the same way about this podcast. You can plan what the description is going to be, what the show is going to be about, who you're going to have on it's. Like, you need to just go do it after a certain point and start executing. I think one interesting story that I heard you talk about was your internship at Apple, and you thought you'd go in and just be coding all day, but I think they made you dedicate, like, two days or three days to just building presentations. And that probably taught you how important the UX and presenting things is, which I think goes into your conversation about distribution.
00:57:54.402 - 00:58:03.178, Speaker B: So I'm just curious, is that something that changed your outlook on everything and how you go about backpack and distribution? Was that kind of transformative? Because it sounded like it would be.
00:58:03.344 - 00:58:16.014, Speaker A: Yeah, it was crazier than that. It was two weeks. It was two weeks of hammering a presentation every day. It wasn't two days. It was way gnarlier than that. No, it definitely did. It definitely did.
00:58:16.014 - 00:59:27.766, Speaker A: Like, storytelling is super important to me because these are all just the classic Steve Jobs lessons, right, where it was very much like a parent in the company culture that that's what they cared about, right? They cared about not just what you built and how you built it, but also how you presented it to the world. And little things like the packaging matter, right. In the context of software, it's maybe not physical packaging, but it's how you talk about it publicly. And so I think small things like Twitter and Twitter spaces and even this podcast are really important when telling your story and inspiring people to use kind of the technology. Right? Because the technology is ultimately like a means to an end. Like, you don't build tech for the sake of building tech. I mean, some people do, but people use tech because they care about the human level improvements in their life, right? Whether they make something that you can connect with your friends and be happier, or you can find information quick, or you can call your mom when you're at school or something like that, that's what people care about.
00:59:27.766 - 00:59:39.554, Speaker A: It's a human level property, and the technology facilitates that, and so it's important to communicate that. And I think that was the takeaway. Yeah, it's really cool.
00:59:39.612 - 00:59:43.814, Speaker B: Bert, we're coming up on an hour. Do you want to do your Fire Round segment?
00:59:43.942 - 00:59:44.522, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:59:44.656 - 01:00:01.360, Speaker C: All right, so, Armani, we're going to do a rapid fire. I don't prepare these questions beforehand. I just think of random shit on the spot. So are you ready for that? Just basically, I'm just going to ask some questions, and then you're just going to answer as quickly as you can.
01:00:01.810 - 01:00:03.040, Speaker A: Let's do it.
01:00:03.830 - 01:00:10.930, Speaker C: All right, let's get started. All right. Board. Ape Yacht Club or d gods.
01:00:11.910 - 01:00:13.090, Speaker A: D Gods.
01:00:15.030 - 01:00:16.850, Speaker C: L two S or cosmos?
01:00:19.190 - 01:00:20.422, Speaker A: Really putting me in the fire.
01:00:20.476 - 01:00:21.640, Speaker B: That's a good one.
01:00:23.130 - 01:00:30.610, Speaker A: I want to say L two S because that's where I started. But I also want to say Cosmos because they're the relative underdog. So I'm going to vote for Cosmos.
01:00:30.690 - 01:00:33.370, Speaker C: Who is the one person you look up to in crypto?
01:00:35.390 - 01:00:36.570, Speaker A: Vitalik?
01:00:38.270 - 01:00:40.886, Speaker C: What is one thing the Solana ecosystem needs to do?
01:00:40.928 - 01:00:50.720, Speaker A: Less? Fight with who?
01:00:51.410 - 01:00:53.758, Speaker C: Each other. Other ecosystems? Both, obviously.
01:00:53.844 - 01:01:06.970, Speaker A: Yeah, both. Infighting. Just focus on your customers. Focus on shipping. Focus on creating value. Don't focus on what people are saying on Twitter. Don't focus on trying to win by killing your competitors.
01:01:06.970 - 01:01:14.600, Speaker A: Focus on winning by delighting and inspiring your users, because there's not that many of them and we need more.
01:01:15.290 - 01:01:25.210, Speaker C: If you could steal one personality trait from anybody in history, what would it be or who would it be from? So, for example, Steve Jobs'storytelling, et cetera.
01:01:26.990 - 01:01:59.240, Speaker A: I think it would be Steve Jobs's ruthless commitment to building great product above all else. Even at the sacrifice of, I don't know, being perceived as kind. It's not necessarily the most admirable thing, but in terms of my personal composition of personality traits, I think that would be the most complimentary that would make me improve the most.
01:02:00.010 - 01:02:01.990, Speaker C: Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos.
01:02:02.650 - 01:02:05.030, Speaker A: Oh, elon Musk. Yeah, no doubt.
01:02:05.450 - 01:02:15.610, Speaker C: Do you have a thing against bald? Uh, I was going to say, who are your favorite three? Twitter follows.
01:02:16.750 - 01:02:39.300, Speaker A: Twitter follows. You're a pretty good one. I mean, not just saying that. I think you say a lot of things that are thought but not otherwise said, and people are afraid to say so. Definitely think you're pretty close to the top of the list. Mad Lads and backpack accounts. Those are the three.
01:02:40.950 - 01:02:46.770, Speaker C: Awesome. What is one tip you would give to founders about forming a community like Backpack and Mad Lads?
01:02:47.610 - 01:03:41.314, Speaker A: If it's on the topic of community building, I would say two things. First is focus on purpose and bringing value to the community. What is it that you're building and why are you building it? Is it to make friends on the Internet? Is it to make a compelling product? Is it just have a reason for existence? It's not about making vibes. I mean, there's some communities around Vibes and there's some that pull it off, but that's like saying being a meme coin is a good idea. It's like, yeah, the doge exists, but you're probably not doge. So I think this is where most people go wrong with building communities. It's really all about incentives, and you need to have that fundamental incentive there where you can inspire people with your mission.
01:03:41.314 - 01:04:22.450, Speaker A: Right? It could be Tesla and accelerating the transition to a sustainable energy source. It can be pure branding like Nike, but you got to have a purpose and a story to rally people behind it. And then the second thing is you have to internally actually believe what that story is. You can't just write it on a piece of paper and then say it on Twitter and hire some marketing people and say, oh, yeah, I think this is a good idea. This is what people like, irrespective of whether I like it itself. I think humans are really good BS detectors. People can tell if you're being internally inconsistent or if you're being externally inconsistent with your internal views.
01:04:22.450 - 01:04:54.650, Speaker A: I don't know what it is, but I feel like humans are incredible at detecting that. And so if you're going to say things and build a community around this purpose, you really need to believe it and be consistent with that view. It's like going back to why open source? Right? It's all about consistency and honesty and eating your own cooking, so to speak. And I think those two things together are a good combination for aspiring community builders.
01:04:55.550 - 01:04:57.870, Speaker C: Well said. Cats or dogs?
01:04:58.610 - 01:05:01.306, Speaker A: Cats or dogs? I got to go with dogs.
01:05:01.498 - 01:05:02.800, Speaker C: Coffee or tea?
01:05:03.190 - 01:05:04.494, Speaker A: Coffee, no doubt.
01:05:04.622 - 01:05:09.460, Speaker C: If there's one lever you could pull to improve the state of crypto, what would that lever be?
01:05:12.630 - 01:05:16.662, Speaker A: One lever, I guess.
01:05:16.716 - 01:05:18.006, Speaker C: First thing that comes to your mind?
01:05:18.188 - 01:05:19.590, Speaker A: Yeah. Regulation.
01:05:20.330 - 01:05:22.760, Speaker C: Regulation. What about tech in general?
01:05:23.130 - 01:05:26.390, Speaker A: Clear regulation. We need to know the rule sets.
01:05:27.210 - 01:05:32.540, Speaker C: Yeah. And what is one lever you would pull to improve the state of tech in general?
01:05:39.660 - 01:05:40.970, Speaker A: Immigration law.
01:05:41.660 - 01:05:48.060, Speaker C: Oh, that's a good one. All right, last question. What is one piece of advice you would give to aspiring founders?
01:05:51.920 - 01:05:52.990, Speaker A: Fuck it.
01:05:55.200 - 01:05:55.852, Speaker C: Beautiful.
01:05:55.986 - 01:06:06.428, Speaker B: I love it. Before we close up, what would you tell the audience? What should they check out? Obviously, we'll put your links in the show notes, but what would you tell them to do to learn a little bit more about your projects?
01:06:06.604 - 01:06:29.332, Speaker A: Yeah, all the basic stuff. Twitter is probably the best place. Go to Xnft underscore backpack on Twitter. Madladsnft. I think for the madlads account, those are probably the two best places to get started. And then there's all the other stuff. TikTok Instagram YouTube Chrome Store GitHub Repos You can find all that stuff from the Twitters.
01:06:29.476 - 01:06:38.730, Speaker B: Amazing. Well, thank you so much for joining. This was an amazing first episode of Lightspeed Armani. You're absolutely killing in the ecosystem, so I'm so glad you joined. This was a lot of fun.
01:06:39.740 - 01:06:42.250, Speaker A: Yeah. Thanks so much for having me, guys. Appreciate it.
01:06:42.700 - 01:06:47.180, Speaker B: All right, we'll talk to you later. Jump.
