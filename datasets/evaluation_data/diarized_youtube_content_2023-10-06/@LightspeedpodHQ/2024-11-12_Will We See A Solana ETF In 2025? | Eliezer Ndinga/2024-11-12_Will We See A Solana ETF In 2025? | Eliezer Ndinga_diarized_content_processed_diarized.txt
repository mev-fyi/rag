00:01:09.125 - 00:01:27.065, Speaker B: Hello and welcome back to another episode of Lightspeed. I'm your host Jack Kubenek, podcasting from Ireland today after a bit of time across the pond and I'm joined today by Ellie Dinga, the head of strategy at 21 shares and 21 co. Ellie, thanks for coming on the show.
00:01:27.565 - 00:01:30.945, Speaker C: Jack, thanks for having me. It's great to be here.
00:01:31.525 - 00:02:19.677, Speaker B: Yeah man. So I wanted to speak with you today Ellie, because I don't know if you may have heard, but there was an election this week and with the election of Donald Trump as the next President of the United States, many in crypto are expecting a more favorable regulatory regime to come. This has really been, I think the story of the year in crypto and so one that we definitely should touch on in LightSpeed. 21Shares has filed for a spot Solana ETF in the US so you all would definitely be a beneficiary of a more favorable regulatory climate in a new administration. So Ellie, I'll just start with can you give me your initial kind of market crypto takeaway from the election outcome?
00:02:19.741 - 00:03:17.265, Speaker C: I think this is a watershed moment for digital assets, especially for putting market, but also for the future of media and information where essentially the markets can decide as well some of these event based initiatives and moments. And I think for for me what has changed is the number of people telling us how much a blockchain based application was extremely Helpful without even them realizing that they're actually using a blockchain based application, which is polymarket. I think a product like that that can actually spot ahead of time and also predict based on the market's movements, the US elections compared to the traditional media outlets is a complete shift of, I think, mindset, but also understanding of information ahead of time. And that's extremely powerful.
00:03:17.385 - 00:03:34.245, Speaker B: Yeah, a couple of pieces there, I think firstly on the Poly Market being this really breakout app during this election cycle. I think even if you're a prediction market skeptic, which I sort of am, you really have to give Poly Market its flowers.
00:03:35.075 - 00:03:35.891, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:03:36.003 - 00:04:46.143, Speaker B: Really all of the mainstream polls missed the extent to which Trump in the end defeated Harris. And you could like, you can make the argument that, I don't know, polymarket has more of a right wing user base that would have been more able to predict a Trump victory maybe than if the roles were reversed. But one of the things we did learn was that this big French whale that betrayed, I don't know, tens of millions on Trump used his own kind of novel polling method called the neighbor method, where instead of asking people, who would you vote for? It's who do you think your neighbor would vote for? So if someone wasn't willing to tell a pollster I would vote for Trump, they might say, my neighbor is going to vote for Trump. And that ended up being for this guy. It ended up being more accurate in predicting what the outcome was than what a lot of pollsters sort of saw as a much closer race down to the end. So it was, it was definitely a major victory for polymarket. I mean, I think it remains to be seen whether it can retain meaningful usage in a non election year.
00:04:46.143 - 00:04:59.499, Speaker B: We'll see kind of what Poly Market's second pitch is, so to speak. But. But yeah, the fact that Polymarket got it right is quite impressive and I give credit where it's due. Just for the record, 100%.
00:04:59.587 - 00:06:13.021, Speaker C: I couldn't agree more. I think, you know, the party market moment is kind of like the Airbnb moment as well for crypto where I don't know if you know that, but like Airbnb was trying to actually make the ends meet by, you know, creating serials boxes between Obama and Mike Kane back in 2008 so that they can actually raise more brand awareness for their services and then down the line downstream actually offering over experiences as well moving forward. So I think that's super interesting. One thing that I think the Solana audience would absolutely love to hear that is during the election day multiple people came to me and said where the hell is putting market built on? Because like it's kind of like expensive and I wish it was actually built on Solana. So I think for, for, you know, for, for the founders and the people working on putty market or production markets, you know, very exciting to see, you know, what comes next with drift and what have you and where they could find also, you know, product market fit for a significantly better user experience as many people were trying to also interact at the time on putting market during the election day. So excited for someone that as far.
00:06:13.053 - 00:06:27.943, Speaker B: As the regulatory environment. Ellie, do you believe a. Just to start basic, let's establish. Do you believe that a Trump administration would be more favorable for crypto than a Harris administration would have been?
00:06:27.999 - 00:07:20.449, Speaker C: I think we, from, you know, from, from the election race we've seen that Trump was clearer on the direction around crypto compared to Kamala Harris. But then of course, you know, we have get to see the implementations of all the talks and the promises moving forward. He would be officially president next year in January 20th. So hopefully we can see something really, really positive for the asset class. But Regardless, we are 21 shares. We always work with both administrations to make sure that this asset class advances in the hands of Americans or any of the regulators around the world. But certainly I would agree that from what we've seen, the patterns and the speeches, that certainly it seems to be a lot more positive for the asset class.
00:07:20.449 - 00:08:44.811, Speaker C: And certainly I think you've seen that as well with the DEFI tokens raising a lot higher than some of these meme assets for the past couple of days, which is basically a testament to the fact that certainly could be a DEFI renaissance as multiple people say, especially in our research team at 21Shares. We truly believe that DEFI actually can raise from the hashes from, from this new and upcoming administration with probably clearer understanding of the taxonomy and the classification of these assets. But certainly for us now we're incredibly excited to still make the case to the financial regulator as we did for Bitcoin as well, to be eligible as an ETF in the US So certainly making the case for Solana to, to be eligible as, as an asset within an ETF format. We still going to keep shingling along and push for regulatory clarity around that and ensuring that the investors would be able to still invest in anything beyond Bitcoin. I mean we incredibly excited of course about the, the adoption rate and most importantly the latest price developments for Solana. But everything on top of it as well is incredibly impressive for us. And we've been looking into these for the past four years as we pioneer the first one in Europe in terms of this one etf.
00:08:44.811 - 00:08:48.135, Speaker C: So very excited to see what we can do in America.
00:08:49.035 - 00:09:46.801, Speaker B: So you made a subtle point there that I want to draw out a little bit more, which is that one of the big issues that people in crypto ran into under the Gensler SEC regime was that there was this regulation by enforcement thing going on where crypto companies didn't exactly know where they stood until they received a Wells notice and had to deal with these kind of ongoing lawsuits. But that isn't the case for every asset. So Bitcoin has been declared to be not a security. The same can be said for Ether, given that we have ether ETFs. So I'm curious, especially when we think about Ethereum versus Solana, the tokens. You know, Bitcoin has its own reasons to, you know, potentially have upside under a Trump administration. There's been talks of this strategic Bitcoin reserve, which we'll see.
00:09:46.801 - 00:10:38.765, Speaker B: But there's other reasons that you could be positive on Bitcoin. As far as Ethereum versus Solana, I would wonder if, you know, something we've been talking about recently on this show is there's a little bit of an existential risk for Solana right now, which is that the SEC's current stance is that Sol is a security. And if anyone who sells Soul tokens in the US is an unregistered security broker, the network would have a lot of trouble kind of continuing to grow at all if a more regular, a more favorable regulatory regime comes in. Says, hey, Seoul is not a security. Doesn't Soul have more upside than Ether then? Given that Ethereum doesn't have that huge risk hanging over it at the moment.
00:10:39.865 - 00:11:28.635, Speaker C: I think you're making a fantastic case here. I think it's a scenario to consider. However, these are allegations that these and these token, including Solana, may be a security from these court cases. But we of course have yet to see whether this is true or not. And the Ripple case from a year ago where they were able to win and make the case that XRP is not a security. I think there is also some interesting pathways and patterns that we can learn from the past, from these previous court cases that could be also applied for the case for conveys, and allegedly, of course, the SEC mentioning that. So that may be security specifically, and especially when you look at the functioning of the token and where the token is coming from.
00:11:28.635 - 00:12:28.345, Speaker C: And why the token exists in the first place is actually very similar to the way Ether is securing the network as well, with a mechanism of proof of stakeholders is very different with Solana, with history. But at the end of the day, the principles, the first principles functioning of the token is actually very similar to Ether. So it's possible that there is a pathway for Solana to also be considered as a commodity and to be sufficiently, also decentralized moving forward and is growing significantly. Of course, as hardware becomes a lot more efficient and effective, Solana is going to be less cumbersome to actually run your very own nodes. And that we know that. So I think it's going to be incredibly interesting to see how the case may be evolving, but I think we're incredibly confident to keep pushing and making the case for Solana to be a commodity and accessible to an etf. And also when you look at the metrics of solana, there is 6 million daily active addresses.
00:12:28.345 - 00:13:44.321, Speaker C: Solana is going to become probably the second largest, you know, defy hub after Binance. And I think, you know, these are the things that we're seeing where there are some metrics that are certainly showing that there is disruptive patterns of Solana because it's cheaper, it's faster, it's more effective. And certainly there are use cases around AI agents, but also micro payments and, you know, remittances is actually very, very strong, especially for a platform that, you know, can settle transactions in, you know, less than 400 milliseconds and in a very cheap and effective way. So certainly, of course we're seeing that this is incredibly disruptive to all the L2s on top of them, but also like, you know, the base layer for Ethereum too. So certainly there is a lot more upside. However, I would say that Ethereum is still a significant juggernaut with over $45 billion in TVL because of the Lindy effect, you know, and most importantly because of the fact that there has been a lot more applications built on top of it. But again, for us, we're incredibly excited about what is going on right now on Solana.
00:13:44.433 - 00:14:30.537, Speaker B: Elliot, you're going to get me in a lot of trouble at work talking about active addresses on the pod, but point taken. There's been a lot of activity on Solana, as we know, in recent times. I guess while we're on the topic, because people love this stuff, you know, 21 shares is more blockchain agnostic. It's not just a Solana firm. So I guess what are the lines that you draw between Ethereum and Solana? And what kind of world does it look like where Ethereum maybe wins and takes most of the market share? And what does the world look like where Solana takes a lot of the market share? I saw some tweets on the timeline that you were comparing Ethereum to BlackBerry. So I don't know if. I don't know if you're more bullish, Solana, but I'm curious kind of what your analysis is there.
00:14:30.641 - 00:15:17.835, Speaker C: So to rectify, I basically mentioned that there are certain patterns where it's possible in crypto that we could actually experience our very own BlackBerry moment, where essentially a product could be used widely by multiple people, as we've seen with multiple government officials. And even our very own former US President Barack Obama was using a BlackBerry and today most of the US Government officials are using an iPhone. Right. So I think once you got your App Store moment in crypto, it's possible that we are seeing one of the largest players actually becoming disrupted. So my view is that it could happen and that would shock everybody in the future. Whether it's a anything else, we don't know. I think it's really hard to tell at the moment.
00:15:17.835 - 00:16:08.905, Speaker C: But I would argue though, that because crypto is an international phenomenon and a global phenomenon, you give people a choice, right? So it's not either or. It's not very binary in terms of like, how disruptive this asset class could be, and people would just choose one environment compared to the other. I think it's possible that you get a duopoly of like EVM and SVM or EVM and non EVM and very similar to iOS and Android type of thing. And I think this world would make a lot of sense. And also I would not discount completely Bitcoin as well, because Bitcoin is evolving with smart contracts that we've seen with several L2s. They have yet to prove themselves, but that's really interesting to see the evolution there too. And Bitcoin is 60% of the market share, Right.
00:16:08.905 - 00:17:36.655, Speaker C: So we cannot discount that. But in a world where Solana actually could be incredibly disruptive, is actually when Sol has a lot more developer retention, has a lot more disruptive applications that can only be built on Solana, as we've seen, for example, Helium, that completely disrupts the broadband markets. And I think if you provide a cheaper and faster way to be connected with your smartphones and other devices, that changes the game. And we've seen that the disruptive innovation always comes from a very niche market and then grows to a bigger market with a cheaper and faster solution for the niche market and then growing to a more widespread virus to a broader market and vertical. So I think this is where we cannot discount some of the innovations that can only be built on Solana and then growing to a broader market as well. And I think this is where we could see that I could become a lot more dominant in certain areas that actually are not possible or actually cumbersome on top of Ethereum until Ethereum actually changes the dynamics and the opcode to be a lot more effective. But we know that actually the L2s are the middle child trying to actually gain and make Ethereum a lot more accessible.
00:17:36.655 - 00:18:18.219, Speaker C: But I think disruption is also one thing that is not to discount when you look at the top L2 on Ethereum. Base is actually the top L2 now. And that's thanks to the reportedly 100 million users that Coinbase services. Right. So if you know that distribution is key and I think the App Store and the iPhone actually won because of the deal that Steve jobs signs with AT&T. We know that actually at some point Solana we also need to kind of like have a decentralized network of distributors so that we can actually get applications in the hands of people without realizing that they're actually using solar right now. And I think, you know, Helium is one of them.
00:18:18.219 - 00:19:15.011, Speaker C: That's incredibly exciting. People don't really have to figure out the engine behind it because they just want to be connected and interact with the families or having B2B type of businesses on top of their smartphones. So I think this is where we could see a world where Solana could be also losing market share compared to like, you know, something like, like a base or anything that would be on top of it. Because there is a lot more distribution and user adoption on top of a base because you're able to have this kind of like on and off ramp through an exchange that's just one company. Right. So that's why to me the good thing with Solana is that it's kind of like moved away from the previous main distributor, which used to be FTX and now actually is living on its own ecosystem is down 20% from the all time high, is going to be the second largest Defi hub. And that's just Defi.
00:19:15.011 - 00:19:33.953, Speaker C: And Defi is actually, you know, a very interesting use case. But there's a lot more happening on Solana as well, especially with Deepin. And I think Deepin is a niche market that we haven't seen anywhere else. And if Deepin becomes bigger than Defi, then this is where I think Solana would be quite disruptive compared to the other smart contracts platforms.
00:19:34.099 - 00:19:46.272, Speaker A: The SEI network brought parallel execution to the EVM with their v2 update this past spring. Subsecond finality and massive throughput are now available to EVM developers everywhere on SEI's high performance layer.
00:19:46.357 - 00:19:46.741, Speaker C: 1.
00:19:46.893 - 00:20:19.089, Speaker A: Incentives for users are coming to SEI this month from teams like DragonSwap. Start farming on SEI today by visiting DragonSwap app. That's DragonSwap app. Thanks again to SEI for sponsoring today's episode. As anyone doing stuff on Chain knows, security for your crypto is super important. That's the benefit you get from Ledger, which has been around for a decade now and is the most secure hardware wallet for your Solana and logins. Ledger's newest devices, Ledger Stacks and Ledger Flex, have secure touchscreens, making it easier to manage your crypto.
00:20:19.089 - 00:20:36.271, Speaker A: And with Ledger Live, you can seamlessly and securely manage and stake your Solana alongside Ledger Stacks and Ledger Flex. Ledger introduced the Ledger Security Key app, a safer alternative to traditional passwords, enhancing your overall digital security. Thank you Ledger for sponsoring this episode.
00:20:36.383 - 00:21:32.135, Speaker B: So I want to dive a little bit into ETFs because sure, when I was thinking about, you know, a new regulatory regime, who benefits? I think one of the clearest answers I mean obviously if Salon is declared a security, there's bigger problems, as I mentioned, but one of the outcomes is you never get a Solana ETF. 21 Chairs is one of a few firms now that has filed for Solana etf. We had Matt Siegel from Vaneck a few episodes back talking about their ETF application. So I guess maybe just walk me through the rationale when 21 shares I believe over the summer did file for a Spot Sole etf. And was that sort of a call option on a Trump victory at the time, as people are saying? And how are you feeling about that application now after the election outcome?
00:21:33.035 - 00:21:58.909, Speaker C: It's a fantastic question. And as I told you previously, we are apolitical. We filed for the Bitcoin Spot etf. We were actually the first firm to file for the Bitcoin Spot ETF back in April 2023, way ahead of the BlackRocks and the Fidelity of the World. And that was a very contrarian move. And I think we are 21 shares. We really try as much as possible to listen to customers and we know that Solana is here to stay.
00:21:58.909 - 00:23:16.599, Speaker C: We know that this is an investable product that should be wrapped into an ETP in Europe as well as an ETF in some time, the future in America, when regulatory approval allows. So that's why for us, we really want as much as possible to be first to market, to apply the same playbook as we've done in the European market to other regions. It's our global expansion to what we've done so far in pioneering Europe, regardless of the administration. So, no, it was not a call option on the possible Trump victory, but actually it's a closely listening to the wealth advisors, the family offices, the hiring network, individuals, and, you know, investors like you and I that we talk to in America to educate them impartially about this asset class, showing them the evolution of crypto. And that actually it's not just Bitcoin, Ethereum, which arguably today is like, you know, over 70% of the market share, but there is actually a lot more moving forward. We actually also pioneered a classification system like the geeks for stocks that we applied for crypto called gccs. We actually launched that with Congeco last year to actually show the investors that, you know, cryptocurrencies are not the same.
00:23:16.599 - 00:23:51.785, Speaker C: And actually they should not be called currencies, per se. Even bitcoin is not a fantastic medium of exchange, but it's an emerging store value. I think for FM and Solana, we can compare them to app stores and there's a lot more exciting stuff that can be built on top of these app stores. And, you know, the rise of the mobile economy made Airbnb uber possible. And we can see that, you know, with Solana, with the rise of helium and over applications on top. And there is also decentralized mapping that we haven't even talked about and just focusing on broadband. So that's why for us telling all of these stories, multiple investors really relate to the analogies.
00:23:51.785 - 00:24:53.607, Speaker C: They also relate to, okay, I classify this asset in a certain way. What does it mean then from a valuation perspective? How do we actually compare the multiple with various sectors and industries within crypto? That makes sense with the benchmarks of publicly listed companies. And then also, what does it mean for my portfolio? How do I locate how much? Some investors are comfortable with 1%, others are more adventurous with more than 5%. And we always have to adapt the language to all these various wealth advisors and multiple institutions to get more and more comfortable with this asset class. And again, I like to say that ETFs are kind of like the IPO moment for crypto assets. So basically, you make them publicly listed on regulated stock exchanges, whether it's in Europe or whether it's in America. And that allows then the entire financial system, assuming approval from warehouses and platforms for their users and investors to access then the underlying etf.
00:24:53.607 - 00:25:06.335, Speaker C: So that's why for us, we're incredibly excited to apply the same playbook as we pioneered in Europe. We're very excited about what is going on across this ecosystem and we'd like to be early.
00:25:07.195 - 00:25:59.133, Speaker B: That's an interesting point you make there, Ellie, with ETFs being like an IPO for a crypto token. I guess, more broadly, like, what's the benefit of a Solana ETF when the asset tends to be, I would say, more degen than Bitcoin? I think we saw a little bit of this effect with the Ethereum ETFs and you could argue that maybe ETH as an asset has less potential than Solana or less upside that's perceived. But still, like the inflows were much less. And I wonder if it's because just the type of crowd that's going to be investing in Ethereum and Solana isn't the type of crowd that wants to access crypto in an ETF wrapper in a regulated way. So I'm curious where you see the demand side coming from for a sole etf.
00:25:59.269 - 00:26:36.365, Speaker C: Yeah, but also I think pretty differently on the ETF wrapper. Think about how people invest in gold. Some people can invest in gold and go through the bank, have a vault opened and then put the gold bars in the vault attached to the names. Or some people would actually be a lot more skeptical about the direction of society and they would have gold bars under the mattress. Right. So if you have a ledger under your mattress, you're kind of like these kind of people as well, very skeptical about society. Or you would actually have your ledger in the bank, if you actually trust your bank to not do anything with it.
00:26:36.365 - 00:27:33.175, Speaker C: And then you have also other people that do prefer to have a proxy so that they don't have to deal with insurance policies, they don't have to think about their private keys. But also for estate planning is actually incredibly helpful because if something happens to you or there is natural disaster, actually you can get also the wealth value of your position in, for example, Bitcoin or any other ETFs to your heirs and kids and grandkids. So I think there is a lot of utilities or I would say access point that ETFs provide. And then people have to choose. And I think for us, we Always want to give an additional choice for people to invest in this asset class. And I mean arguably our solar ETF when we look at the European market, is actually our top two ETF by market cap. That's a billion dollar product.
00:27:33.175 - 00:28:34.087, Speaker C: And I think again it's all about the story, it's all about also the market timing. You know, when the Bitcoin ETF launch, it was in Q1. Q1 in terms of flows in traditional ETFs is actually one of the best months out there alongside Q4. I mean if they actually launched in the middle of the summer and there is this adage that says, you know, sell in May and go back in September, something of the sorts. So again, you know, it was, it was a moment where in the middle of the summer we also had, you know, a market correction and some uncertainty around whether the Fed will actually cut interest rates or not. And of course geopolitical risks as we've seen a couple of months ago. So I think market timing was not, was not right for the Ethereum etf, but we've seen still a significant amount of investments into these products and even pension states investing in the Ethereum ETF too.
00:28:34.087 - 00:29:18.175, Speaker C: So again it shows that there is still a pent up demand for these ETFs and it would be a mix of, you know, market timing, education. But at the end of the day for us, 21 shares, we're here for the long haul, you know, and we launched the world first Bitcoin ETP in Europe right in the middle of the bear market in 2019. And I don't know if you remember that, but in 2019 Bitcoin went from like $10,000 to then three months for $3,000 for a while. And then Facebook came out with Libra and then the market jumped to $8,000 again. Again, but, and then we drew down again when we had the COVID 19 market crash. Fast forward to a year later. Right.
00:29:18.175 - 00:29:58.923, Speaker C: So I think despite the fact that we have short term fluctuations, at the end of the day we know that the long term trajectory is incredibly interesting for the asset class. Half a billion people today have access to crypto. There is actually more crypto accounts than MasterCard accounts, which is really impressive. There is nearly on paradise the same amount of annual transaction volume for stablecoins as Visa, which is $10 trillion on an annualized basis. And Solana certainly is going to take a lot more market share from other smart contracts platforms given how effective is a settlement layer. And you've seen that with Visa and Other companies mentioning that they want to actually build on top of Solana too, to circle back.
00:29:59.019 - 00:30:35.625, Speaker B: If people over time become much more comfortable with wallets and seed phrases and what have you, then where is the demand for regulated institutional project products that charge a management fee? Right. Is it pension funds like these larger kind of managed funds that, that wouldn't be holding their crypto on Coinbase? Like, I'm just curious, is there a tension between crypto growing in general and the growth of these institutional investment vehicles?
00:30:36.005 - 00:31:12.493, Speaker C: Yeah, I would argue that. I think crypto does a fantastic job at making sure that it becomes easier to use moving forward. But again, you know, are you running, are you running your own nodes? Are you running your own mining rig? Probably. Probably you and I are doing that because we're a lot more advanced in this asset class. But some people would be more comfortable to go with a staking provider to actually stake their assets, or they would prefer not to run their own nodes for several reasons. I don't know if you're running your own Solana node, for example, but I think it's giving an additional option. Then where the demand would be coming from.
00:31:12.493 - 00:32:44.333, Speaker C: I think it would be a mix of both retail investors as well as, you know, wealth advisors are the gatekeepers of the wealth management industry and they're managing trillions of dollars on behalf of customers and their fiduciary duty to ensure that they are educating themselves and are able to direct the investors to certain assets. So again, you know, education is going to be very key so that these wealth advisors, they're actually really the gatekeepers of the financial system in America, are able to get a lot more educated and comfortable to explain in a convincible way about the asset class and getting, you know, really good research, you know, from the blockworks of the world, the 21 share of the world, and over, of course, ETF issuers that do also a good job at expanding this asset class. We are stewards of the crypto market, so we have to ensure that the, the adoption continues to steep and grow and grow significantly. But I would argue that, you know, you're going to have university endowments, you're going to have pensions, insurance companies that would certainly invest on behalf of customers as well, but for several reasons. They would also invest specifically in certain assets. From a Treasury management perspective, it could be, for example, Bitcoin into your alternative suites because they want to actually preserve wealth. So they would be like alongside gold, it could be also sacrificing a portion of the gold allocation into bitcoin or it could be both of them and sacrificing, for example, fixed income for Bitcoin.
00:32:44.333 - 00:33:26.031, Speaker C: I think there are different ways that I think you're going to see portfolio managers looking at this asset class very differently. But the demand will be here to stay. And the reason is because multiple financial institutions, institutions have a mandate to actually invest in regulated investable assets. They cannot actually open any crypto exchange account and then hold the assets in cold storage. That does not happen and compliance will never be comfortable with that. But it's possible that some firms may be a lot more avant garde. There is actually a pension fund in the UK that invested directly in Bitcoin without going through a proxy like an ETF or an ETC as also ETCs are available to exchange trade.
00:33:26.031 - 00:34:00.595, Speaker C: Commodities are available also in the United Kingdom. But again, I think it would be dependent on how these compliance and risk departments are going to get more and more comfortable with the setups. We know that also KPMG invested in Bitcoin, Ethereum and that was directly not using a proxy. So I think it would depend, it would be on case by case basis. But I think it's a great thing that at least we're giving options to investors to either use Bitcoin directly or Solana directly or using a proxy like an etp.
00:34:01.095 - 00:34:26.059, Speaker B: Okay, that makes sense. Another piece I wanted to touch on that you kind of glossed over, but it's a stat I came across last week that's really crazy. And it's that 21 shares is Solana ETP is. I checked before this call. It's the fourth largest in Europe with over a billion in assets under management. This is according to ETF book, which is really big. Like it's.
00:34:26.059 - 00:35:02.145, Speaker B: It was surprisingly large to me because all ETPs in Europe include, excuse me, all crypto ETPs in Europe. But that includes all of the Bitcoin funds, all of the ethereum funds and 21 shares is Solana ETP. It was the second largest last week or the second or third largest last week. It is gone down to fourth, but it's right up there among the biggest ones. So I'm just curious to get some color from you on like when did you start seeing all of these inflows to that Solana product? And what is. Where's a lot of the demand coming from that you're seeing?
00:35:02.565 - 00:35:36.863, Speaker C: This is a fantastic question, Jack. Actually it has been over the years. Right. And I think being first to market certainly helps. Market timing was fantastic. You know, we launched ahead of the first DeFi summary for Solana where we've seen the Orca and the Radium, you know, showing and raising to the surface. But also I would say, you know, it's an incredible amount of work by our fantastic research and sales team and marketing team to really go after with education educational content across the municipal markets where we are available.
00:35:36.863 - 00:36:44.573, Speaker C: Whether it's, you know, for multi asset teams at asset managers or hedge funds or family offices or private banks, it's a huge amount of efforts. But of course, you know, this is it takes a village to of course raise a billion dollar. But we've been incredibly well positioned to have a fantastic research to really push for this product to be launched as soon as possible in 2021. And then you know, pushing for educational content and being out there for the clients, you know, with webinars and physical meetings to ensure that Solana could be top of mind as well as a differentiator as a diversifier to their portfolios beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. So it has been an incredible amount of work and that's why we're incredibly proud to see that product being in the hands of several investors. And actually Savannah for the past year or so, you know, has been one of the top performing assets. Even when you look at the top five, I think since 2023, Solana jumped by over 1500%.
00:36:44.573 - 00:37:16.115, Speaker C: That's a significantly important performance that we hadn't seen in a while. You know, last time I think Bitcoin raised by over a thousand percent over several like months, like 15 months was probably in 2017. And I think that's why for us, you know, we were able to get to be first market with deep education. And it has been an organic rise for all these assets under management. And actually that represents one and a half percent of Solana Security Supply.
00:37:17.135 - 00:37:18.863, Speaker B: Really? One and a half percent.
00:37:18.959 - 00:37:20.195, Speaker C: One and a half percent.
00:37:20.855 - 00:37:21.835, Speaker B: That's high.
00:37:23.615 - 00:37:34.299, Speaker C: But it's decentralized. Right. Because multiple investors invest in this product is not owned by 21 shares. It's actually multiple investors having access to this fund.
00:37:34.467 - 00:37:37.699, Speaker B: Are you staking that Solana and staked as well?
00:37:37.747 - 00:37:38.335, Speaker C: Yes.
00:37:39.155 - 00:37:42.375, Speaker B: And are those rewards shared with the investors?
00:37:43.395 - 00:37:44.255, Speaker C: Yes.
00:37:45.195 - 00:38:26.395, Speaker B: Okay, so that's probably going to become table stakes. You would think for, I mean at least in Europe, among European ETFs that you really have to be staking the Sol and sharing their rewards. We'll see what happens in the US but related Ellie, that I wanted to ask you, I saw that 21 shares has also filed for an ETF for the only Asset with more hype than Solana right now, which is xrp. So the XRP ETF filing went out. I'm just curious, like, how many ETFs, how many assets do you think will come to garner ETFs, let's say, in this cycle, how many assets deserve ETFs.
00:38:28.135 - 00:39:27.677, Speaker C: Well, I think, I think we can look at the top assets by my market cap. We can limit it by outside of stable coins, you know, the top five by market cap at a time, by market cap, depending, of course, on the maturity of the assets, depending on some of the requirements that the SEC would be asking for these ETF to be arguably eligible, as you know, in several stock exchanges. So it's pretty hard to tell. But you know, what we want to do is applying the same playbook that we've done several years ago. We also launched the world's first XRP etp. And xrp, of course, had significant tailwind from a legal perspective, as you know, from last year with the court cases against the sec. So, so certainly for us, we want to make sure that we give the assets that we research and analyze and done our due diligence on as ETPs.
00:39:27.677 - 00:39:45.085, Speaker C: So it could be two or three, but certainly we don't know. I cannot even name names. But certainly you're going to see public filings from us for these potential ETFs to be approved. But, you know, that's dependent on regulatory approval by the sec.
00:39:45.545 - 00:39:56.605, Speaker B: Well, I'm excited for when the DOGE ETF drops. I've been tinfoil hat that it's going to happen at some point. It's decentralized, it's not a security. But I digress.
00:39:58.705 - 00:40:00.321, Speaker A: Is there, is there an upper limit.
00:40:00.353 - 00:40:23.855, Speaker B: Though, is what I'm kind of trying to get at. Because, you know, I wonder if there just comes a point where wealth managers no longer need another crypto etf, or there's maybe a bitcoin etf, an eth, a soul, and then like a crypto, like a basket of DeFi tokens, ETF or something like that. But will all of these tokens get the ETF treatment, do you think?
00:40:24.755 - 00:41:05.885, Speaker C: Well, at least in Europe, we have, you know, several ETPs, we have DeFi tokens like Uniswap and AVI. We also do have baskets, you know, top five, top 10. We also even have larger baskets as well. So I think, I think we really want to give diversity of options for the investors. I think we also have to be humble to realize that the asset class is a joining asset Class is an ever changing asset class and we have to adapt to it as well. I think this is the reflection of the wider range of ETFs that we have. Of course, we conduct significant research on all of these assets.
00:41:05.885 - 00:41:58.529, Speaker C: We listen very closely to our customers to understand also the appetite for aesthetications in these products. But also, quite frankly, some of the things that have changed for the past, I would say, couple of years is that a lot of these institutions are incredibly interested about tokenization. And you've seen that with asset managers launching potentially tokenized products and Solana too. So there is one part where there is the investable opportunity, but also there is the other part where how can I use these protocols like tcp, IP or SMTP or HTTPs. Right. And I think these are very real questions that multiple investors have and we are stewards of these asset class to ensure that we're able to respond to these very simple questions sometimes, or they're very tough ones or technical ones. So that's really the exciting part where we really want to give optionality.
00:41:58.529 - 00:42:19.161, Speaker C: Right. So you've seen us managers launching on Stellar or launching on Ethereum. Some of them are looking at Solana, and again, you know, we have to provide optionality. And then they would decide, the market would decide which one will win. And I think polymarket was the best example of what, what is the force of the market here.
00:42:19.273 - 00:43:05.025, Speaker B: I'm going to transition then and leave you with this, Ellie, and I'm putting you on the spot a little bit. But before we go, I'm going to ask you just for one thing, you're bullish on with Solana and one thing you're bearish on with Solana. It can be a use case, it can be something about the tech, it can be a project. I don't know, because we've spoken a lot about just how investors are going to get access to the asset, but obviously 21 shares did file for these ETFs earlier than they did for other assets. And so the firm does have opinions. So I'm just curious, kind of what gives you hope and what gives you less optimism about the token?
00:43:06.085 - 00:43:47.073, Speaker C: That's a great question. I think we're looking at these more broadly than just the token. We're looking at the ecosystem overall. What I'm extremely bullish about is all of these uniquely built applications on top of Solana that actually cannot be built anywhere else. Which means that essentially you have this unique positioning, this moat that we cannot see anywhere else where you don't have this variety of Blockchains with the same applications as we see with, for example, Layer Twos on Ethereum. So I think this is where I'm incredibly bullish about, especially I'm incredibly bullish on broadband. The overall disruption here for Verizon of the world and the T Mobile of the world.
00:43:47.073 - 00:44:16.013, Speaker C: I mean, you and I are based in the us so you definitely relate to these names. And for my European friends, Swisscom or Orange or Free or all of these other providers, and that's truly incredible. If you can do that on a specific chain and that cannot be built anywhere else, it creates. Multi. Creates distribution. And I think this is exactly the way to go. The other thing that I would say should be improved and again, that will happen over time, it's.
00:44:16.013 - 00:44:46.247, Speaker C: It's how to make sure that running your solar node becomes a lot more possible, especially a full node, a lot more possible for. For anyone around the world. So that, that can actually increase decentralization, that can increase the, you know, the accessibility of the, of the product, especially from a, you know, transaction validation perspective. So these are the things that I'm incredibly, incredibly excited about. So let's go solar.
00:44:46.351 - 00:45:03.351, Speaker B: But cool. That, that is sadly, all the time that we have for today. But Ellie, thank you so much for coming on. It's been a really enlightening conversation and I wish you the best of luck as you may or may not be engaging with regulators in the coming months and working on new products and all that kind of.
00:45:03.543 - 00:45:10.555, Speaker C: It's been a pleasure, Jack. I truly appreciate the time and very excited for the upcoming episodes.
00:45:10.975 - 00:45:12.479, Speaker B: Absolutely, man. Take care.
00:45:12.607 - 00:45:13.847, Speaker C: Thank you. Take care.
