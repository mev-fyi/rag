00:00:00.240 - 00:00:25.578, Speaker A: The North Star for us is always like, what's the percentage of sold as liquid stake? There are some metrics about, like, tvl or dominance or whatever. Like, I care less about that. I care a lot about how much of that soul is liquid stake. Many people don't stake their soul. Like, there's still, like, 33% of the soul not being staked. And that's crazy. And so, like, this represents to me a tremendous missed opportunity to try and convert this soul to staked soul, because that, you know, earns them yield and.
00:00:25.578 - 00:00:29.210, Speaker A: And also it helps to secure the network. So that's my North Star.
00:00:29.362 - 00:00:59.266, Speaker B: Before we get moving on today's episode, just a quick disclaimer. The views expressed on this podcast by either myself, my co host, or any guests are their personal views and do not represent the views of any associated organization. Nothing in the episode should be construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal, or any other advice. Okay, let's jump into the episode. All right, everyone. Welcome back to another episode of lightspeed. You got to bear with me this week.
00:00:59.266 - 00:01:18.534, Speaker B: I'm in the middle of a move. So we're coming live from a new random corner of the house, but we're joined this week by Sanctum and FP Lee. So, FP, thanks a ton for joining us. You guys are building a really, really interesting protocol on Solana and would love to get your expert view as to, how do you define this? How do you define what sanctum is and what problems it's trying to solve?
00:01:18.994 - 00:01:46.942, Speaker A: Right, yeah. I mean, thanks for having me on on such short notice as well. Yeah. So I think the goal of sanctum, we've been talking about this, and really, we're trying to build what we're calling the infinite LST future. And that sort of encompasses a couple of ideas. One is, first and foremost, that I think most souls should be staked, or maybe also should be staked. And then of that soul, most, if not all of it, should be liquid staked as well.
00:01:46.942 - 00:02:20.994, Speaker A: Right? The second thing is that there should be a lot of reasons for you to stake your soul over and above just earning the yield from staking your soul. And so we want to give you a thousand reasons for you to stake your soul. And that means sort of a thousand different lsts, each with their own purpose. So be it supporting art or supporting public goods or just getting extra yield, these are all options available to everybody. And so that's kind of what sanctum is doing. We're building the infrastructure, and we're building this infinite LSD future.
00:02:21.694 - 00:02:37.950, Speaker B: And that's a perfect tagline when one of your flagship products is, of course, called infinity. And talk to us a bit about what this product is and how it differs from other lsts, and then we can jump into the second core product that you guys have, of course, working with partners to launch their lsts.
00:02:38.102 - 00:02:59.196, Speaker A: Yeah. So infinity is not. It is an LST, but the special thing about it is it's an lst of lsts, or it's a basket of lsts. So it's an index fund of lsds, however you want to call it. But the idea is that. So if a normal LST, um, usually holds, uh, a stake account. Right, or a bunch of stake accounts, in the case of a stake pool, like marinade, jitto, et cetera.
00:02:59.196 - 00:03:45.632, Speaker A: Um, and the infinity pool is the first ever LST that holds other lsts. So in infinity, it's holding Jirozol, Besol, you know, et cetera, as well as the validator lsts, which we'll get to in a bit. Um, and this basically allows it to be, um, an infinity pool, right, that earns the average of the combined staking rewards from all the lsds that it holds. Plus it allows any kind of swaps in between them. So if you want to go from sort of M soul to B sole, right, if the infinity pool has both these assets, then it can service a swap. And of course, importantly, it allows you to service any pairwise swap. So if you've got 100 lsts in them, then you have, like, 100 times 100 different swaps.
00:03:45.632 - 00:04:16.684, Speaker A: Like, you can sort of any pair between the hundred. And this is like a big sea change compared to regular amms, because regular amms have two assets. And so if you want to support 100 different assets, you're going to have to spin up 1000 different amms. So the idea of infinity is that it is a single pool that allows all of these lsts to be in the same pool, and it allows swaps between any two of them, which then makes it the most capital efficient amm possible for an infinite LSD future. Yeah.
00:04:17.084 - 00:04:27.756, Speaker B: So are the assets held in the pool actually sitting on, like, some amm curve? And thus, when you swap between them, does it favor the liquidity or the depth of one of the assets in the pool?
00:04:27.940 - 00:05:00.000, Speaker A: Right. So the way we don't have. We don't have a curve, and we don't use an oracle price, right. Because the key insight is that all lsts are, like, semi fungible in a way. They all redeem down to stakehold. That gives us, for every single LST, a floor price for how much this LST is worth and will be worth at some future date. So that basically, just taking the ratio of one LST to another in terms of stakehold value allows us to calculate for you the fair price.
00:05:00.000 - 00:05:31.696, Speaker A: And this price is sort of invariant for no matter how much size you swap, because they're always going to be one to one. That's the special thing about lsts. Now, this isn't the case for a stable swap for USDC, but USDT, because actually one of them can de pact. You never know. But here in this case, we have this infallible on chain Oracle that tells you how much stake sold you're going to get for the LST. And that is the sort of key invariant that we use. And having this sort of key invariant allows us basically to do, basically zero slippage swaps.
00:05:31.696 - 00:05:40.112, Speaker A: I mean, obviously we charge a fee, but the price that you pay does not need to increase with the size of your swap. Does that make sense?
00:05:40.288 - 00:06:05.264, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. And what is the. So how does this change? Like, the risk assumptions there? Because you mentioned, of course, and USDC can both kind of depeg. And the difference here being lsts and the Solana ecosystem all tend to use the same core contracts, if I remember correctly. And, yeah, talk to us a bit about how that changes the risk assumptions. Because if you did price about one to one, like, what actually changes two.
00:06:05.304 - 00:06:43.434, Speaker A: Key risks, like smart contract risk, when it comes to infinity, one is, of course, an exploit in the actual smart contract. Right? And that's always going to be there for any smart contract. And the second one that's. That's unique, is that, obviously, if you have an amm that holds a basket of assets, if any one of those assets deepaks for whatever reason, or just gets exploited, then it can be drained. The entire pool can be drained. So that's the risk. Many people have asked us, well, if you're going to be an infinity pool and you're going to have all these lsts, all it takes is for one LST to be compromised in order for the whole pool to go down.
00:06:43.434 - 00:07:24.238, Speaker A: Um, that's kind of true, but not exactly true, and I'll explain why. Right? Because as you said, um, in. In reality, even though there look to be like 100 different lses, most of them, I think every single one of them except marinate soul, runs the same smart contract, which is the SPL smart contract, the stakebook contract. So it's the exact same code. Um, there might be different deployments of the contract. So, like the, the multi stake is held by different people, but, um, you know, the, the actual con, the actual contract, the actual smart contract is the same. So it's as though you kind of had an Amm with two assets, realistically, the marinade asset, and then the sort of the SPL asset.
00:07:24.238 - 00:07:48.450, Speaker A: Right? And so it doesn't matter how many new lsts we add to the pool, as long as they're only using that initial contract. Now, of course, if we started to add a new LST with a new contract now, that would be a huge risk, and that would be something you'd have to manage very carefully, but we don't do that. Right. So the marginal risk of adding new LST assets that use that same deployment is zero.
00:07:48.562 - 00:08:00.174, Speaker B: So because the risk there is quite small or near zero, do you, like, broadly accept any LST that is using those same contracts, or is there still some sort of, like, whitelisting feature?
00:08:00.874 - 00:09:02.392, Speaker A: There's one consideration that goes, actually, besides the soft smart contract risk, you can be holding an LST that's underperforming. And for example, there are lsts now which hold 0% APY, which give you no yield because the yield is directed to public goods or to fund a team or something like this. And these are sort of legitimate lsts. Right? And of course, there are also lsts that could at some point be malicious in that sense, that sort of taking your staking returns. And so in a general case, the infinity pool needs to make sure that it has a right balance between sort of being able to service all of these lsts, including the poorly performing ones, whether by design or by accident, and making sure that there's not this overweight of these poor performing assets, so that the entire infinity pool just gets dragged down by a 0% asset. We have a couple of ways to deal with that. One is an economic sort of, we can tweak the fees for every pairwise asset.
00:09:02.392 - 00:09:55.112, Speaker A: So if you have an asset that is sort of low performing, for whatever reason, we make it expensive to sell it to the pool, and we make it cheap to buy it from the pool, and maybe it's even free to buy it from the pool. And so in this way, arbitrages, as well as sort of market dynamics, will make sure that there's a tendency for that asset to sort of go down over time. That's a way in which we can rebalance via tweaking the fees for every pairwise asset. The other thing we can do, of course, is a manual rebalance, because, as I said, at the end of the day, they all come down to stake accounts. So what we can do is we can take the LST, we can unstake it, unwrap it, get the stake account, we can unstake that stake account, restake it to a better performing LST, move the stake account, etcetera. So there are ways in which the infinity pool can maintain a sort of healthy allocation.
00:09:55.288 - 00:10:30.856, Speaker B: My friends, big, big news. Blockworks is hosting permissionless three in Salt Lake City this year. So we're heading west for three days starting October 9. Permissionless is our industry's premier defi event that brings together crypto natives from all over the globe. I've personally been the last few years and can honestly say that the attendees are incredible. It's people who actually care about crypto. We also have more than 200 industry titans speaking at the event, and this includes builders like Lucas Bruder from Geeto Labs and Brian Pellegrino from Layer Zero, or investors like Kyle Simone and Joe McCann, and even elected officials like Representative Tom Emmer, who is fighting the good fight in Washington in its narrative season.
00:10:30.856 - 00:10:53.766, Speaker B: So we're going to be covering the seven hottest themes in crypto. This includes things like modularity and restaking, or bitcoin and l two s, and even AI and crypto. The goal is to keep you up to speed on major developments in the industry. Ticket prices will be structurally increasing over time, so get your ticket today from my lightspeed family. I got you. We're going to use code lightspeed ten in all caps. No space for 10% off your ticket.
00:10:53.766 - 00:11:24.204, Speaker B: All right, everyone, I look forward to seeing you at permissionless three, and let's get back to the show. And can some of that rebalancing be done, like, algorithmically? I think Jito's pushing out their stake net idea, which is really trying to use Solana as the database to with. To hold a lot of the validator performance history, which kind of enables you to do sort of exactly what you're talking about is, like, once you bring this data on chain, you can do a lot of this, like, algorithmic auto rebalancing. Is that something that is possible today, or if not, is that something you guys are looking to add in the future?
00:11:25.064 - 00:11:45.416, Speaker A: It's possible. And I think everything that we are doing, really what we already caring about, is that price of stake sold over time. Right? Of course. Um, there are two. There are two issues with that, right? One is that, you know, doing it automatically on the chain with sticknet is great. And we are sort of actively trying to work with Jiro team to do that. The question is how? Right.
00:11:45.416 - 00:12:14.874, Speaker A: It's more a normative question. Right? Um, which is that? How much is too much? Or, you know, that, like, what is this? What is this algorithm? Because I think about infinity not as trying to maximize the APy at all cost. Like, that's not, that isn't what we're trying to do. Right? That's. I mean, of course it earns staking yield and trading yields, and we want that to be high, of course, otherwise people don't want to hold it. But I see ourselves also as waving this flag of like, this is the LST future. Infinite LST future.
00:12:14.874 - 00:12:50.482, Speaker A: Like, come join us. And I think that is perhaps sometimes opposed to maximizing APy all the time. For example, maybe with a public good project like iSol, the cubics. Isol, that is like a LST that gives you zero return. But maybe there's some case for saying, okay, maybe infinity puts in some token amount like 1000 soul or 5000 soul or whatever the amount is. And yes, it's taking a hit on that 5000 soul, but perhaps that 5000 soul makes a big difference into that ecosystem. It can encourage more or lessees to come in and just sort of push this future forward.
00:12:50.482 - 00:13:23.666, Speaker A: So there are these tricky normative questions that I think infinity needs to tackle. It isn't just because at the end of the day, you know, us LST, like, you know, here at sanctum, we're trying to push this vision of the LST. We're trying to make staking better, trying to make Solana better. Right? And so, like, that is perhaps the best way to do it, is not by maximizing APY at all costs, but rather to do some of these things that maybe drop Apy a bit but get us outsized returns in sort of adoption or, you know, mind share.
00:13:23.730 - 00:14:12.214, Speaker B: Yeah, that brings up a pretty interesting conversation around, like, how do you define, you know, good validator performance, right? It's. If there are these like, very quantitative metrics, like, you know, yield uptime commissions, and those are like, easy to measure, but there's a whole bunch of like, qualitative aspects. Like, and maybe the client you're running, if, you know, they want to promote or promote client diversity, or even the opposite of like, oh, no, we really want to promote people on fire. Dancer, once that comes live or something of that nature. Like, how do you guys think about the more qualitative side of, of these other additional factors? I know you kind of touched on one being maybe they're doing some, like, public good funding, but, like, what other qualitative factors are there that, you know, you kind of have considered to be like, all right, this is probably a good validator, even if their apy isn't maybe like the Max yield maximizer.
00:14:12.594 - 00:14:36.498, Speaker A: I think, in general. Right. The question is, who's pushing Solana forward? Right? Who's, who's a good actor in this space? Like, who's pushing Solana forward? There are validators who run, for example, 20 different chains, right? And there's nothing inherently wrong with running. So validators on 20 different chains. But it's kind of like, how much time can you really spend on Solana, right. As opposed to if you run validated with, like, Solana and two chains, two or three chains, or if you are Maxi. Right? Like, you know, that's just sort of like the fact.
00:14:36.498 - 00:15:21.114, Speaker A: And there are a lot of validators who make it like a, like a business, and they're very professionalized and very, like, it's like, you know, you know, again, nothing wrong with that. Right? I, you know, there's nothing wrong, but it's just like, you know, how much can you care if you have your attention split between all of these chains? You know, that's one we think about. I think the other one is very hard to measure. So you have someone like San Tetsu who is like, he's always on the discord. He's very concerned about vote lagging and so on and so forth, actively participating validators came together to validate the governance, passing votes and stuff, organizing conferences. A lot of this is how you can't measure it. It's not something that you can measure.
00:15:21.114 - 00:15:54.472, Speaker A: It's not something that shows up on the, on, you know, on the, on the metrics at all. Right? And so, and, you know, as you said, sort of like client diversity and so on. Right. But, but at the end of the day, I think one really makes, needs to make a judgment call about what, you know, who is trying to, who is genuinely here and, you know, trying to push the network forward as opposed to treating as a job or seeing it as free money. You know, things are just opportunistic and mercenary. So I think that, like, at the end, at the core of it, that's, that's, that's the key. Yeah.
00:15:54.608 - 00:16:17.576, Speaker B: That's kind of a perfect segue into the second project that the second product you guys offer, which is kind of like providing the infrastructure for partners to launch their LST. So you guys are working with about 20 partners now, through the likes of, you know, Jupiter, Helios, Bonk and drift and a bunch of others, uh, talk to us a bit about what this, what this offering is and how you launch these partners, or how you help these partners launch their own lsts.
00:16:17.760 - 00:17:04.352, Speaker A: Right? So the first step we did was to build this base layer infrastructure. So the promise is that any LST is able to be swapped for any other LST with minimal sort of fees and slippage. And on this basis of the liquidity layer being done, that then paves the way for all these new lsts. I think the idea is that given that the cost of lsts becomes so low, like the cost, the marginal cost of spinning up and maintaining an LST becomes so low that no fixed cost, because previously you had to have millions of liquidity to fund your amm. Otherwise your LST was basically useless. It wasn't liquid at all. Now that we've solved that, it means that anybody can spin up an LST without having to have this massive cash outlay.
00:17:04.352 - 00:17:51.238, Speaker A: I think the product we offer is really just projects come to us, or we go to projects. Sometimes projects come to us, or validators come to us and say, hey, I would like to set up a liquid staking token. And these LSTs can take all sorts of different forms. The most basic one is the single validator LST, which is a project, runs a validator, and the LST delegates exclusively to that validator. This is the lion's share of it. But as I said, we've also seen, and I'm really personally very interested in launching all these new kinds of lsts. Things that aren't just state pools of single validators, but for example, like isol funding public goods, pathsool whitelisting, sort of an unruggable NFT.
00:17:51.238 - 00:18:15.444, Speaker A: And then a couple hours ago, I launched Fpsoul, which is the first personal LST, just a proof of concept. But the idea is that everybody, like you and me, can have their own LST. And when someone buys that LST, that's directing the future, staking yields to you. And I see this being very useful for authors, artists, all kinds of sort of creative, or creators in general.
00:18:15.784 - 00:18:36.152, Speaker B: Yeah, I definitely wanted to ask about fpsoul. I was poking through the docs and the site right before this pod, and I saw that it's even token gated to a private discord, which is pretty cool. Do you expand on that a little bit? Because you mentioned artists as well. And so it does feel like the token gating side of that is potentially a cool use case. Is that what you were thinking?
00:18:36.288 - 00:19:14.596, Speaker A: Yeah. So the core insight, really, and this is only possible on Solana, is you want to abstract the LST away from the validator, away from the stake account. Right? And so most people think of staking as staking to a validator, which is true. But then when you have an LST, what that is, is that validator is completely abstracted. It's like, at the end of the day, which validator it delegates to, eh, it's almost irrelevant. What you care about is that where do the staking yields for that LST go to? Because that's a completely different. Where the sole is staked is that base layer.
00:19:14.596 - 00:19:50.718, Speaker A: But where do the staking yields go to is a different question. And so with these personal lSTs, what you can do is that you basically abstract that layer down and you decide, okay, which personal lst do I buy means who do I want to direct my staking yields to? And this is just like a. It hasn't been done before on Ethereum, on Solana, and just having this idea of separating where the stake is staked and where the staking returns goal just sort of includes a ton of different use cases. Yeah.
00:19:50.886 - 00:20:01.518, Speaker B: Okay, so that's pretty interesting. So in the case of the FP Sol, then what does the bottom layer then look like? Are you running the validator behind that, or is it getting delegated elsewhere?
00:20:01.606 - 00:20:18.518, Speaker A: Exactly. So the fpsol is delegate. So when you. So basically, how it works is on the base layer, it's delegating to a validator. And right now, it's delegating to lay invalidator, which. Who is a personal friend of mine, and I trust him. Right, but it could be anyone else.
00:20:18.518 - 00:20:54.974, Speaker A: I've just chosen that guy. But on the top layer, what that does is that I've created the LST, and I've taken 100% take rate, which means that all of the fees go to me instead of to you. And I can point any arbitrary wallet address where it goes and it goes to my wallet. What that means is that at every epoch, when you get your staking returns, they go directly to me. That's how it works. The token gating, of course, is just one. At the end of the day, you have to give someone a reason to hold your token.
00:20:54.974 - 00:21:32.564, Speaker A: Maybe for me, there's the utility. I've deliberately made it very minimalist, because I do not want people to ape into the FPSO. I said, there is no airdrop, there is no secret alpha, there is no wonderland. There are no points, there is zero. Please do not expect a single cent of monetary return to come from holding FP sole. And that's kind of like, I mean, in part because we don't want to be accused of, like, self dealing, right? But as an influencer or as an artist or as a creator, the sky's the limit. You can offer any kind of thing that you want.
00:21:32.564 - 00:21:50.228, Speaker A: Private telegram, private discord, token gated. You can offer, I don't know, onlyfans, if you want. Or sneak peeks to your new albums or music diss track. I don't know. The point is that you know who holds and for how long. You decide what to do with that.
00:21:50.316 - 00:22:23.886, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Social tokens have long been this, like, crazy idea of using crypto for some real world asset, and we haven't really seen them, like, hit that inflection point. But this is yet another interesting iteration on it. And I'll go ahead and underscore for that for you, though, that this is just an experiment, so don't go aping into this thing. But you also mentioned something interesting at the beginning of this question, which is the idea of liquidity for lsts that is very much formerly was an unsolved problem. Right. If you look at the largest liquid staking protocol is Lido.
00:22:23.886 - 00:22:41.934, Speaker B: Of course, on Ethereum, they spent tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars on token incentives driving liquidity towards staked ETH. So one of the things you said was, you solved it. Talk to us a bit about why you solved it. I guess that ties back in the original product, but walk us through why it's solved.
00:22:43.594 - 00:23:33.284, Speaker A: To answer this question, I hope you don't mind. We have to go way back. We have to go way back to 2021, when I first started sort of working on Solana. And at that point in time, in 2021, Solana had basically just done sort of like, liquid staking wasn't a thing. And so the first sort of initial draft of a smart contract had been written, and they had asked, they had basically asked me, asked people to help with helping with dashboards and so on for the new liquid staking things that are going to happen on Solana. And I went there and I realized that, oh, wait, actually, there's this exploit, that exploit, and maybe we can help a little bit with this. And so one thing led to another, but initially, we were going to do a dashboard for stake pools.
00:23:33.284 - 00:23:56.054, Speaker A: We realized that there weren't any stake pools, so maybe we should run the stake pool before we think about a dashboard for stake pools. And so we started running a stake pool. And at that point, Jitto hadn't, didn't exist yet. So it was marinade, and then it was Lido. And then there was us, which was socian. This was back in August 2021. And I think we, you know, we.
00:23:56.054 - 00:24:26.064, Speaker A: We. Maybe we. Maybe we made a mistake, but we didn't launch our token early, or I didn't want to. Right? Because marinate and Lido had their very sort of, you know, it was like a big duopoly. They were fighting it out, duking it out for this liquidity, basically, you know, incentivizing saber pools and so on. It was like the saber wars, right? And I was just looking at my stake pool at the time, and I was like, well, this is dumb. I don't want to play this zero sum game and let Alameda farm all of our tokens away.
00:24:26.064 - 00:25:04.304, Speaker A: This is very silly. And I was just thinking that maybe there's a better way. Maybe there's a better way. And so instead of thinking about how do I win this battle? In which case it would be launch the token incentive very heavily, try and fight for a piece of that pie, I was thinking, like, maybe there's like a way in which we can actually solve this problem by the root. Right? And then the key insight, really, as I said, is that all these stake pools are all wrappers around the same stake account. And that when you unstake, when you do a. The way that the program is written is that when you do an instant unstake.
00:25:04.304 - 00:25:31.940, Speaker A: Sorry, when you do a withdrawal from a stake pool, you get the stake account. Right? Ethereum is different because you have this sort of withdrawal queue and so on. So you don't actually get your soul until the withdrawal queue comes out. And that leads to a huge win and take all dynamic because you can compose upon it. But here in Solana, it's very different. You get your stake account like this. When you withdraw, you get the stake account, you don't get a ticket, you don't get into a queue and so on.
00:25:31.940 - 00:25:57.228, Speaker A: You get your soul right away. And that insight led us to create what is called unstake it, which is basically a naked. A naked pool of soul. And that allows all the, you know, it basically, when you come in with msoul or when you come in with St Soul or ScN Sol, it does a withdrawal, right? It gets the stake account. And that stick account is then like basically interoperable. And then you can sort of put it into Sol, right?
00:25:57.356 - 00:26:10.432, Speaker B: And just to underscore that one as well, is. So you get the stake account, but the soul is still staked, right. Because if I were to, like, then withdraw from the stake account, I do have to, like, wait till the end of the epoch. Correct.
00:26:10.628 - 00:26:11.280, Speaker A: Okay.
00:26:11.392 - 00:26:14.936, Speaker B: The key difference is then you can own the actual staked portion. Okay.
00:26:14.960 - 00:26:29.024, Speaker A: Very. And that's, that's. And that's the key. Right. And so, um. Yeah. And so, like, that, like, that gave us the idea, which is that instead of trying to solve liquidity for my stake pool, maybe I solve liquidity for all stake pools.
00:26:29.024 - 00:27:00.910, Speaker A: And I was thinking, well, this, you know, this whole idea of an orca pool is very inefficient. Because, number one, you know, if you have, like, an amso pool, right, half of that asset is not really being used. And why do I say that? Because if you care about an MSO Sol pool, and usually it supports two kinds of swaps, sole to amsoul and am sold to sole. Right. The problem with that is that when you want to go from sole to am Sol, you don't need the pool for that. You have already a way to go from sole to amsoul in infinite size with zero slippage. It's called staking into the pool.
00:27:00.910 - 00:27:39.572, Speaker A: And so that part of the. Doesn't make sense of that soul. It can only, again, get the m soul part. And so I was thinking, what if there was this massive pool of soul, just soul, not m soul anything, because, again, that leg is not important. What if there was a naked pool of soul that accepted all of the lsds? And so that was the precursor. That was unstaked, which basically allows any stake account to be. To be entered into the pool, which also then extends to allowing any LST, because, again, LST is reduced down to stake accounts.
00:27:39.572 - 00:27:45.364, Speaker A: So that was the idea of how we solved liquidity on that base level. Does that make sense?
00:27:45.444 - 00:28:24.504, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, no, that's super, super interesting. And so, once you have this new level of liquidity, that, because one of the questions I was going to have is, all right, so helios Mertz, co host of the show, so we'll use him as the guinea pig here. They just spun up their LST. Um, I think they have, like, 250,000 ish sol, uh, last I looked. And so my first thought is, okay, well, that's great, but, like, you know, let's say I was a lending protocol, and I wanted to integrate this thing. Um, like, why? You know, like, a huge requirement there is liquidity. So does this model then, like, still make it useful in a you know, like a DeFi Legos composability context.
00:28:24.504 - 00:28:27.790, Speaker B: Given that there is still a way to get liquidity on these assets.
00:28:27.952 - 00:28:59.278, Speaker A: Yeah, so that's the thing, right? So before sanctum came about, right? If you had 250k in h soul, right? And you then have to kind of incentivize twenty five k at least of h soul Seoul. Right? At least, right? And 25k. How much is twenty five k h soul sold? It's like a ton of money. It's like for like 25k, like 5 million. I mean, it's a couple of million dollars, right. For a sort of not that big. Um, lst.
00:28:59.278 - 00:29:39.304, Speaker A: Um, and obviously, you know, as it scales, you have to scale linearly. Otherwise, sort of like, no, no lending protocol will integrate you and so on and so forth. Um, and, and of course, I mean, if you are a tokenless protocol, right? Or you don't just don't want to give your token, you know, to out to do this, then sort of like your upshit creep, right? Um, so, so the idea of having this naked, uh, you know, this naked soul pool is that anybody doesn't matter if they have their own liquidity or not. They can just spin it up and they can borrow this liquidity. So that's the base layer. But also. And this is a little bit more technical, so stop me if I'm going off too deep.
00:29:39.304 - 00:30:06.518, Speaker A: Is that if you've got. Because you have now this infinity. Even if that sort of base pool runs out, I think now we have about 210k into that naked soul. The sanctum reserve, we call it. It's a reserve pool. But even if that route is not available, you can go from H Soul through infinity to maybe Jiro soul. And we've got 400k into 400k in Jiro Soul in infinity.
00:30:06.518 - 00:30:41.606, Speaker A: And so you can go from H Soul, swap it to Jiro Soul and then borrow Jiro soul's liquidity, which is very deep because they've been incentivizing it for God knows how long and so on. And so you can also borrow m souls, liquidity and bsos liquidity, etcetera. Every, like, this is the key. Every single LST is able to borrow the liquidity of every other LST's liquidity. Right? And that's like, that is not just the 200k that is, you know, like that. That reserve. But it's like if Jiro so has like 2 million, you know, sold off liquidity, great.
00:30:41.606 - 00:30:47.382, Speaker A: It means everybody can use it. And that's like. Yeah, that's. That's really cool.
00:30:47.518 - 00:31:07.694, Speaker B: Okay, so there's, like, two layers to this, right? There's the infinity. Let's call it the infinity pool, which you can swap the, like, lsts through this pool that both. Because they all use these same stake pool contracts. And you can also. Or stake accounts contracts. And then you also have this, like, lower layer, which is the reserve. How do we.
00:31:08.834 - 00:31:33.054, Speaker A: So. But the key is that when you go. So here is when the hop comes in, right. So it's not. It's not just that you're swapping your h soul to Jiro soul in size infinity, is that jitto soul soul pools are heavily incentivized and very deep. That's like 2 million sol in Jiro soul orca pool or something. And so previously, it's like, that would be a huge moat for Jiro Soul.
00:31:33.054 - 00:31:56.682, Speaker A: Previously, it would be like, yeah, that's the deepest LST. And that's going to be when it's a positive feedback loop. Now, even if you're a tiny little LsT who doesn't have a single radium or orca pool, that doesn't matter. You go through infinity from. So. So, like, one hop h soul to Jiro soul. And then Jiro sold to Sol via all of the ones that they have, you know, incentivized.
00:31:56.682 - 00:32:11.570, Speaker A: Right. And so you basically borrow someone's, like, borrow the liquidity from some other LST. But, I mean, I don't think about it like this. I think about it as this massive, unified, like, grand unified pool of liquidity that's available for every single LST. And everyone benefits. Yeah.
00:32:11.722 - 00:32:30.026, Speaker B: No, that. That makes a ton of sense. And it's interesting. I haven't really heard it pitched that way before. So this is a first for me. I'm loving it. And at the lower layer, though, the reserve layer, like, what is the incentive for users to deposit? Or, like, where does liquidity come from? And what is the incentive to do so to deposit into that reserve layer?
00:32:30.130 - 00:32:43.314, Speaker A: Yeah. So that reserve layer takes fees. Right? So it's currently close to public. So we sort of fund it. And I think. Yeah, so that's currently close to public. And, you know, we have.
00:32:43.314 - 00:33:04.958, Speaker A: So we funded ourselves. But I think, um, something that people don't know is that. Oh, I mean, people know. But maybe something that is, like, a little bit unintuitive is that the infinity pool is a superset of the reserve pool. Because the infinity pool also holds soul as an asset. So if the infinity pool. When the infinity pool gets big enough.
00:33:04.958 - 00:33:26.234, Speaker A: Right. It can basically supplant the. The infinity pool, by just holding that amount of. Of soul. And so that pool becomes like, the one pool to rule them all, basically. We won't need this whole separate pool idea. There are some concerns with that, because, of course, you have this cash drag.
00:33:26.234 - 00:33:43.478, Speaker A: So if you are holding 200,000 sold, that 200,000 sold is, by definition, not making any returns. And so you'd have to balance that a while. But if there are lots of trading fees coming in and out, then this might be a, um. You know, this might be still profitable overall. Yeah.
00:33:43.606 - 00:33:56.118, Speaker B: So do the trading fees then go to the pool, a deposit, like. Yeah, I guess we're in. When are the trading fees earned and accrued in the infinity pool? Where do those flow through to? Is that the split between the depositors.
00:33:56.166 - 00:34:01.422, Speaker A: Protocol and the depositors? So 10% to protocol, 90% to depositors. Yeah.
00:34:01.478 - 00:34:17.346, Speaker B: Perfect. And then the. On the other piece. So, like, running h soul or these other partner protocols, is there any value accrue that flows back to the protocol? Like, I'm curious what the business model there is for. Like, allowing these other protocols to use.
00:34:17.370 - 00:34:22.554, Speaker A: The infrastructure well, as in, are you talking about the benefit that accrues to helios?
00:34:22.594 - 00:34:27.186, Speaker B: Or the opposite, really. So, like, you know, helios is used? Yes, exactly.
00:34:27.290 - 00:35:03.528, Speaker A: Well, I mean, so it's a couple of things. So I wrote. I wrote, I mean, way back in September or July, I think I wrote this document, right, which is that we have two goals, right? Number one is to just. Basically just explode the percentage of liquid stake sold on Solana. That's like step one. And step two, capture all of that volume that comes from that cambrian explosion of lsts. So even if we don't take any fee on those lsts, if I can get the proportion of lsts from what was like, relatively, like 4% and 4.5%
00:35:03.528 - 00:35:34.554, Speaker A: when we started, and now it's at 6%. If I can get that to 50% and I can capture that trading volume, which at the time was 1 billion. But if you sort of ten exit, it becomes 10 billion. And if I can capture that 10 billion volume, that 10 billion trading volume, and take ten bits on that or whatever, however many bps on that, then sanguine can make a ton of money. That alone. And of course, fee switch, I guess you can always turn it on. You can always put some sort of commission on the Aum and so on.
00:35:34.554 - 00:35:50.496, Speaker A: I mean, again, this is sort of far from my mind right now. To me, this is like early days where at 6%, why don't we get to 60%, and then we'll talk about the. Yeah. And I think even then, we'll be eight digit sort of revenue figures, I think.
00:35:50.560 - 00:36:13.830, Speaker B: Yeah, no, that makes sense. And as far as it's still such a grow the pie part of the explosion here. There. It just doesn't make sense to kind of be over indexing on doing something else. Next question here is really. I think it's. So you mentioned decentralization a few times and the idea of, like, the protocol accruing fees.
00:36:13.830 - 00:36:26.182, Speaker B: And you guys are also running sanctum Wonderland right now. Talk to us a bit about, like, the design of this points program. And, you know, you intentionally took, like, a more. I don't know if gamified is the right word, but, like, a more fun spin on it. Talk to us a bit about the program.
00:36:26.358 - 00:36:46.664, Speaker A: Yeah, so Wonderland is. Is, you know, we call it a user loyalty program. It's a points program. But, you know, I don't like to. I don't like to say this because, like, the. The thing that we got, the feedback that we continuously got was, like, gosh, like, please don't run a points program. I'm so fatigued.
00:36:46.664 - 00:37:11.774, Speaker A: I, you know, I'm gonna. I'm gonna throw up if I see another points program. Right. So that was, like, the thing. And we were like, okay, you know, we don't want to do that. But at the same time, I think points programs are good for the protocol. They bring in users a lot of interest, a lot of engagement, and it's a quantitative way to at least track how much people have contributed to the protocol over time.
00:37:11.774 - 00:38:00.856, Speaker A: There are strong reasons to run a points program, but we definitely did not want to do yet another one with Wonderland, instead of thinking about how can we. How can we maximize our metrics, the primary design goal is how can we make our users have fun? How can we make our users feel like this joy and whimsical and feel like, okay, this new LST fusion is so exciting, and let me be part of it. And so I think a couple of design choices, deliberate design choices, were made. One is, of course, the design of it. It's cute. We spent a lot of time on the art and just making the bars sort of thing. Most pro, like, technically, we don't take snapshots every 2 hours.
00:38:00.856 - 00:38:31.644, Speaker A: We take them every five minutes, which is, like, a massive engineering challenge, but that's required for the responsiveness of the UI to make it feel a lot more fun and interactive. And then I think the other thing is that a lot of points. Program feels very pvp. It's like everybody's competing for your attention, and you have this fixed pot of cash to go into this, and which one do you farm? And so on. It's just, and as more users come in, you worry about being diluted and so on and so on. It's just not a great. And you're constantly worried about your rank going up and down.
00:38:31.644 - 00:39:04.820, Speaker A: It's just not a fun experience. But if you don't do it, you feel like you're missing out and so on. So, again, trying to fix that a little bit. So we, like, instead of, we could have easily done, like, just incentivizing inf, and we deliberately chose not to, even though it's a lot of effort. Right. So we went to all our, all the partners, most of which we tried to do the art for them and also, importantly, to incentivize collecting all of them. So we have 18 in season one, and there is no sort of additional incentive.
00:39:04.820 - 00:39:36.148, Speaker A: But if you get 18, you get this little golden batch on your profile, and people love that. It's like, oh, I want to collect all these pets. And we made that bar very low. So, like 0.1 of that lsd, which is maybe $15 or something like this, and just make sure the bar is just really low so that everybody, not just the rich, can enjoy having that, collecting that 18 pets. And of course, we also try and push all of our partners, which is like, hey, it's not just inf. All these partners are good choices to put and put your soul into.
00:39:36.148 - 00:39:46.944, Speaker A: And I think that's our way of just trying to inject some much needed fun and levity and life into this points meta.
00:39:47.284 - 00:40:08.252, Speaker B: Yeah, the points meta is at a place where we absolutely need some, we need some life, make points programs great. Again, there's no doubt about it. And I'll give you that. The blobs are cute. There is no doubt about it. So I love to spin on it. And, you know, you're really trying to drive the user action of using the lsts and getting liquidity in or getting deposits into these, into these different lsds.
00:40:08.252 - 00:40:45.854, Speaker B: And I also like the point of, like, you know, it could have just been inf and it could have been boring and it could have been a leaderboard, but it's really nice to see a change of pace there. One thing we touched on earlier was sort of the winner take all dynamics, and I kind of want to take a back step onto it, because if we look at Ethereum, I think Lido has about seven. It's about, call it a 25% stake rate, and Lido has about 70% of the liquid staked market share. Do you think the liquidity issue that Ethereum has relative to Solana, for all the reasons we just discussed, is like the key driver of why the winner take all dynamics here are so much stronger?
00:40:46.474 - 00:40:59.180, Speaker A: Almost certainly. Right. Because again, with ETH, you have this withdrawal queue, so nobody can. It is not possible to build that kind of infinity protocol that we built. Right. It's just, it really isn't like an opposing. Well, okay, maybe not.
00:40:59.180 - 00:41:40.852, Speaker A: Like, maybe if I were like Ethereum, like super genius, I could probably find some way, but I don't think there is and I think nobody has built it. Right? And so there's this like, it's this immense, like PvP mode, um, that like, it's this intense pvp environment and this like huge liquidity mode that Lido has. And I think like, that's bad for a lot of reasons. Like one of them of course, is, you know, we talk about like if Lido gets too big, then it's like a single plutocratic governance layer, governance token controlled by, you know, a couple of VPN sees a couple of people and that is basically able to halt the chain, basically. And that's horrendous. That is existential. That might be a bit far fetched, but I think much more possible and likely is that Lido gets very ossified and you don't see any innovation, you don't see any competition.
00:41:40.852 - 00:42:17.734, Speaker A: They start being really rent seeking and nobody can really do anything about it because it's just so entrenched in all the fucking protocols across all of Ethereum. And I think that's not where we want to get to with Solana. We don't want this winner take all thing. And well, thankfully we have this. The stake pool program was designed in such a way that you get back your stake account, which then allows. The other thing that also makes a difference is that the epoch is only two and a half days. If the epoch was 21 days, then this product would be a lot less viable.
00:42:17.734 - 00:43:00.074, Speaker A: But those being the case, and no slashing as well. Maybe. But given all of these things, it means that a protocol like ours is a lot more is possible. And we are able to then supercharge innovation. Because when the barrier for entry to creating a new LST is not like a couple million dollars from a vc, but it's like, oh, just talk to me and I spin it up for you in a couple of hours and you don't need any money to do it. Then all of a sudden people can just try different things. All these validators are trying new and different ways to build their brand to get people to come.
00:43:00.074 - 00:43:39.436, Speaker A: They're dropping tokens, they're dropping soul, they're putting in Mav rewards, maybe dropping nfts, maybe, I don't know. But they are now cambrian explosion of lsts, which means lots of innovation, lots of healthy, friendly competition in the. In the sense that you have to sing for your supper rather than build up this mode. And that is a lot better for the consumer. I don't know what fee Lido takes on Ethereum now, but when they came, I think they take a 10% of the staking returns. And to me, that is insane. That is number one rent seeker.
00:43:39.436 - 00:43:47.488, Speaker A: And now people are almost paying you to. They are almost paying you to buy the LST. That's how crazy. That's the difference between Solana and Ethereum.
00:43:47.636 - 00:43:57.168, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Lido is indeed still at 10%, with 5% going to the Dow and the other five going to the validator operators. Yeah. So there is. It is higher than the commissions we see on average.
00:43:57.216 - 00:44:14.234, Speaker A: Can you imagine that? Like a 10% tax on every single transaction on Ethereum? Like, basically. Right? Because, you know, Eve and stick eth is like the bit St EV is like the bit roll and it's like 10%. I mean, that's. It's a great, you know, great to be Lido, but, like, I don't want that to happen on Solana. Here.
00:45:02.234 - 00:45:27.584, Speaker B: Another key, interesting key differentiator. There would be the stake weighted Qos that Solana uses. And so it kind of creates this different landscape. So can you give us a quick primer on what stake weighted Qos is? We've done a lot of episodes on this, so for the listeners, there is a good resources to go pull from. But could be a good intro if we get what is stake weighted Qos? And how do you think that's going to shape this Solana staking landscape going forward?
00:45:28.284 - 00:46:17.254, Speaker A: Right. So the stake weighted Qos is a feature that tries to address the congestion that Solana has had over the past month or so. And the idea is that a validator gets the right to send transactions to the leader proportional to the stake that it has over the network. And the idea behind this idea, the idea, what am I saying? The idea is that if you have, you're not able to spam transactions. It's an anti civil measure, because previously, without this, you can just spin up lots of different nodes with zero stake each and then spam and sort of basically degrade the network for everybody else. And this is like a prophylactic against that. Yeah, so that, stick with the QoS.
00:46:17.254 - 00:47:12.248, Speaker A: I think we've seen over the past few months, past few weeks protocols care a lot about landing their transactions. Jupiter, for example, Helios, for example, drift as well. And all of them have started to set up their own validator to try and attract their own stake in order so that they can land transactions when they need to. For Jupiter, it's extremely important because, for example, with the LFG, you have this big token launch on the platform. You really do not want some sniper to come in and take all of this up and then dump it on the users. It's very important for protocols to be able to land transactions when they can. We see this competition heat up, and that has been quite good for us at sanctum because then they'll try and set up lsts as well.
00:47:12.248 - 00:47:33.104, Speaker A: I think there is some discussion about whether or not stakeholder Qos is the right approach. There are some other ideas, like whitelisting and so on. There are many good validators who are discussing this right now, but I think at the moment it's like a good enough solution.
00:47:34.444 - 00:48:10.072, Speaker B: Yeah. And what I find super interesting about it is it creates yet another reason for if you're running a very successful business on Solana, you have an incentive to run a validator, which makes what you guys are doing at sanctum even more interesting. Because if I'm, say I'm some large retail brand and I run something on chain on Solana, so I have this, like, popular brand, and running a validator makes my business better because I can get more transactions to the leader now. I'm like, okay, well, I would want to continue increasing that. So having my own LST seems like a fantastic way to do that. But FP, this has been a fantastic conversation. I've really enjoyed it.
00:48:10.072 - 00:48:21.244, Speaker B: Maybe as a closing question here to leave with the listeners, what are a few key milestones or KPI's that you intend to track for sanctum over the next twelve to 18 months?
00:48:21.614 - 00:48:25.230, Speaker A: Oh, twelve to 18 months. That's a long time.
00:48:25.302 - 00:48:26.142, Speaker B: Or we can shorten it.
00:48:26.158 - 00:48:53.924, Speaker A: All right, let's take a look. That's good. I think the North Star for us is always, what's the percentage of sold as liquid stake? And there are some metrics about TVL or dominance or whatever. I care less about that. I care less about that. I care a lot about how much of that sold is liquid stake. And in particular, I'm interested in the proportion of soul that isn't staked now, but that could be staked.
00:48:53.924 - 00:49:23.176, Speaker A: And we've realized this, that many people don't stake their soul. There's still 33% of the soul not being staked. And that's crazy. And so these people are usually sort of less sophisticated users, or they're NFT holders and so on and so forth. And so this represents to me a tremendous missed opportunity to try and convert this soul to stakehold, because that earns them yield, and also it helps to secure the network. It is good. So that's my north star.
00:49:23.176 - 00:50:21.394, Speaker A: And then going a little bit even more speculative is I want to see lsts completely change in nature from what we think about them now, which is a box in which you stake your soul and you get some yield back, stake pools and so on. That's like an Ethereum model. But to think about them as basically, I want everybody to have an LST. I want it to be like this circular Solana economy, where you pay for things like you pay for goods and services not by giving USDC, but paying fiat or whatever, but rather by just moving your soul into the LST of the person to pay for their good of service. And I want to see this circular soul economy where I hold your LST and you hold mine and you hold so. And that's where value, real value, is created on Solana natively, as well as staying on Solana. Because the problem right now is that you have sold and you've got to get it out in order to do anything useful.
00:50:21.394 - 00:50:47.774, Speaker A: All of that is speculative and you have to take profits somehow. But if we can have an economy where the value is created and captured via the circular sole or LST holdings, then I think Solana can really become the global currency. And maybe it would be even bigger than bitcoin. That is my pie in the sky, very long term vision. But I think that's super, super exciting.
00:50:48.274 - 00:51:02.480, Speaker B: Preston, the bullish future is definitely a great place to leave off on. Thanks again, FP.
