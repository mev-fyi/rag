00:00:00.160 - 00:00:30.934, Speaker A: Are bringing more users on chain than now are using BONK or USDC or ORCA or Jupyter, therefore introducing more transactions on Solana itself, even if some of those transactions are being performed perhaps in an ephemeral rollup. The core mission of MagicBlock is to bring more users to Solana by means of enabling these different use cases that are not possible on Solana right now and therefore contributing to adding more value because now those users are gonna transact on the network.
00:00:31.112 - 00:01:18.724, Speaker B: This episode is sponsored by SEI. The Parallel Execution EVM compatible layer 1 with sub second finality incentives for users are coming to SEI this month from teams like Dragon Swap. Start farming on SEI today by visiting DragonSwap app. We'll hear more from SEI later in the show. Hello and welcome back to another episode of Lightspeed. Today we're very excited to have Andrea Fortuno, who's the CEO of, of MagicBlock, which is a Solana gaming company that people are really excited about. I think whenever I ask people about just the state of crypto gaming, Solana Gaming, MagicBlock tends to come up.
00:01:18.724 - 00:01:46.480, Speaker B: They're building a game engine that makes use of this kind of novel technology called ephemeral rollups, which we'll get into. And by the time this episode drops, it'll have been announced that they also raised some funding, including participation from a16z through their crypto startup accelerator program. We're very excited to have Andrea on today. Thanks. Thanks for coming on the podcast, man.
00:01:47.740 - 00:01:50.360, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for having me. Excited to be on the pod.
00:01:51.180 - 00:01:56.320, Speaker B: How has Singapore been so far for you? Is it kicked off or is it pretty chill so far?
00:01:58.030 - 00:02:10.290, Speaker A: Very busy, but very exciting as well. I love Breakpoint, so it's great timing to reconnect with a lot of good folks and people that we've been working with. So, yeah, it's just a great, great time.
00:02:11.150 - 00:02:15.014, Speaker B: And you're in Singapore right now, right?
00:02:15.182 - 00:02:16.566, Speaker A: Yeah, correct.
00:02:16.758 - 00:02:27.928, Speaker B: Okay, so I was seeing all these pictures on Twitter yesterday of like long lines for a Barachain event or something. Like, were you around there or what was the deal with that?
00:02:27.984 - 00:02:38.648, Speaker A: No, like, totally not. Like, I'm glad I wasn't there. But yeah, I saw, I've seen those picture. I was in the office, to be honest. So, yeah, pretty, pretty fun to see.
00:02:38.704 - 00:02:40.392, Speaker B: In founder mode, as they say.
00:02:40.496 - 00:02:41.832, Speaker A: Founder mode, Absolutely.
00:02:41.976 - 00:03:11.860, Speaker B: Yeah, I was for a second. I was going to be coming to Singapore on this flight that. Did you see all the videos of kind of the like crypto flight that they chartered from Dubai? Yeah, I was. I was chatting with them about coming on that flight and after seeing the videos I was like, man, I am glad I did not sit through 10 hours of that. I'm sure it wasn't them singing and yelling and sweating for 10 hours, but that looked like a lot.
00:03:12.880 - 00:03:15.800, Speaker A: But yeah, intense for sure.
00:03:15.840 - 00:03:43.630, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Lots of fun shenanigans to come and fun announcements as well. So getting into it a bit here, Andrea, I guess I gave a brief introduction, but for viewers who just might not be as familiar, Magic Block is a game engine. So just explain what that means and sort of what part of the gaming industry you're hoping to enable.
00:03:45.330 - 00:04:38.712, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. So magiblock is, as we call it, a high performance engine for fully unchained games and fully on chain applications. So you can use our stack to build any sort of application that is running entirely on chain. And the reason why we are excited about enabling those sorts of experiences is that you can supercharge some of these consumer experiences with features like persistency, permissionless composability that you don't really get if you're building off chain system if you have server or some sort of centralized component that enable those games or applications. So we cover big part of the stack pretty much end to end. But the biggest innovation that we bring to the table is definitely ephemeral rollups. Ephemeral ups is I guess, a Solana extension.
00:04:38.712 - 00:05:07.030, Speaker A: It's a way for developers to build on Solana and then delegate offload on demand, some of their transaction if they need and when they need it to these fast SVM instances that are deployed all over the world. So it's basically a way for developers to get real time latency and customization at the runtime level without having to leave Solana or without having to use an L2.
00:05:07.980 - 00:05:32.680, Speaker B: Yeah. So I'm excited to dive into ephemeral roll ups in a second, but maybe before we do that, I just want to back up and ask why do games need to be fully on chain? Because I feel like there's a lot of crypto games out there that sort of have these off chain and on chain elements. So what's the benefit to a game of running fully on chain?
00:05:33.830 - 00:06:08.230, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a great question. And when I started working in crypto, I find myself working with some of the largest game studio that were coming on chain. We were doing bridging and we facilitated a lot of onboardings and token exchanges across different chains. But what happened in 2021, through the previous cycle is that fundamentally games started to use tokens or NFT and tokenized assets. Right. So the whole narrative was around ownership. But if you think about it, there's already a pretty big market.
00:06:08.230 - 00:06:45.906, Speaker A: In fact it's bigger in terms of volume with traditional skins and traditional digital items that players trade and own. And they don't feel really the need to use an NFT to own that thing. And so I think there's something more that a blockchain can bring to games than just ownership. I think ownership is important. I think you know everyone and it's pretty excited about that. But it's not the only feature, definitely. And so as I start to sort of dig deeper into some of these properties, I found a few games.
00:06:45.906 - 00:07:29.464, Speaker A: Like the first one was probably Dark Forest. And Dark Forest was an entirely unchained game that for the first time showed how permissionless composability could alter the dynamic of the game. So if the whole game is built as a smart contract is essentially an open platform. So everybody can build on top of that game. They can introduce new level, new progression system, they can build prediction market that could result without the need of an oracle. There could be any sort of new customization or extension on top, which is pretty cool. It took Roblox 20 years to get to a stage where the user oriented content was really significant and was bringing in new players instead.
00:07:29.464 - 00:08:20.458, Speaker A: With a fully on chain game you sort of get those features by default from day zero. And then the other interesting feature is verifiability or trustless compute. So any sort of high stakes game doesn't really have to rely on a centralized party to operate. I have plenty of friends that onboard it into crypto and find out about Bitcoin because Full Tilt, the poker side that they were playing was banned and they lost all of their money. So there's also lands and an angle that enable financial games. So any sort of casino, but you can also think of esports like any games that have some sort of high or value at stake is a good fit to be built on chain. And then the last feature that I think it's interesting is persistency.
00:08:20.458 - 00:09:12.400, Speaker A: So is the ability to deploy a game once and then not having to think about DevOps at all. The blockchain is your server effectively and that game is going to exist forever, which obviously leaves the door open to digital experiences that can last forever, which is a super interesting idea and that's probably something. Nothing new there. So overall during our journey we figure out that some of these properties were only possible for games that were built entirely on chain. And so as we start to build some of those games ourselves. We got pretty excited about those experiences and we decided to build the full stack that could bring those experiences that could enable those experiences in terms of completely brand new category, potentially of games.
00:09:14.070 - 00:09:53.594, Speaker B: Interesting. So I've covered crypto gaming on and off throughout my time at Blockworks. And something I've noticed is that video games take a long time to build. And so there's just a lot of games that are doing lots of marketing and pr, but they're nowhere near ready for actual users to play with them. I have a banger tweet in the drafts that I just need. It's like 90% of the way there about this where. Where it's like gaming companies announcing their private gated DevNet coming in Q2 2025.
00:09:53.594 - 00:10:10.070, Speaker B: So I'm just curious, are there examples out there? You mentioned Dark Forest as a fully on chain game that you had played. Are there examples out there currently of fully on chain games that users are playing that you think illustrate the benefits of this?
00:10:11.100 - 00:11:11.446, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean Dark Forest was really the first one. I think a better example would be Pirate Nation, which is a fully on chain game built by the same team that originally built farmville. And what happened with farmeel is that they were building on top of Facebook and when Facebook changed their API, they were basically screwed and they had to change the whole business model because they were relying on this centralized platform to operate. So it's funny that that same team is now building a fully unchained game. They have this very playful sort of aesthetic to it, but the point is that they are building this autonomous war or this unstoppable forever game that they're sure is not, is not gonna get banned or stopped by anybody. Another one, most recent news is Evil Line. Evil Line has been one of the best games over the past 20 years.
00:11:11.446 - 00:11:41.640, Speaker A: They have millions of players. The average players of EVE Online have more saving than the average U.S. household. That status is crazy. And they are building a fully on chain version of EVE called EVE Frontier, previously called Project Awakening. And so it's. That is an established studio that is moving into these sort of new experiences to tap into the exact same feature that we were discussing about.
00:11:42.660 - 00:12:16.680, Speaker B: Yeah. And I sort of ask because as you're describing your business, it strikes me that the success of MagicBlock is in some ways dependent on the success of the Solana gaming industry in general. Like if there's not compelling games to play on Solana, then you know, there won't be funded developers to build using the game engine. So I guess like how much do you think about just the success of the Solana gaming industry in general as you are sort of trying to build out magic block as a company?
00:12:18.100 - 00:13:06.240, Speaker A: Yeah. So for sure I think that games are a great way to onboard new people into crypto. But at the same time, if you think about it, a lot of the properties that I was mentioning before really applies to other applications. If you think of what happened with ftx, it was pretty much the same problem. Users were trusting a centralized party with their funds, which is the same of the story with the poker side with my friends. So Aduma is the same problem. So what MatchBlock is doing is building the foundational infrastructure to enable not only fully on chain games, but also this brand new category of applications that have share the same property.
00:13:06.240 - 00:14:16.570, Speaker A: So what you can build with our stack is better central limit order book or applications that run entirely on chain and can get more easily customized. And of course fully on chain games are one of the better example I think is definitely where most of our focus is right now. But we're not exclusively about games in that games are more often than not games are at the technological frontier and the tag that you build for game then end up enabling a whole other bunch of applications. Think about Nvidia for example. They really built a GPU initially to enable shaders in video games and now they're powering AI because they added so much computational capacity that now they're powering, you know, high demanding compute applications. And so I think we're sort of on a similar path where blockchain right now are really like slow databases in a way. And the more compute you add and the more application you enable that have real time latency and customization in the way that developers can build them.
00:14:16.570 - 00:14:32.230, Speaker A: It's going to be important not only for games but for many other applications as well. So I definitely love to see the gaming ecosystem on Solana side succeed. But I think the tactic we're building goes way beyond just video games.
00:14:32.850 - 00:15:48.260, Speaker B: Yeah, that's an interesting point. It's like if you can do these really compute intensive tasks on chain through the kind of ephemeral roll up innovation, then surely there's other ways you could apply doing intensive things on chain outside of gaming. I feel like that's so often the hang up for crypto projects is it's just expensive to use a blockchain. And so if you can, you know, like that was the issue with a lot of these like AI and crypto projects is like why, why Should AI be running on Chain? It's insanely expensive. So that's a fair point, I guess. Just one other point on the gaming business, as I think about the world we live in right now and the crypto games that have succeeded up to date in 2024, it's a lot of tap to earn or much more rudimentary games. So probably the biggest success story still is Axie Infinity, which is, you know, terrible, like not very good ux.
00:15:48.260 - 00:16:21.190, Speaker B: But when I think about Magic Block and maybe what you're describing, it sounds a lot more like aaa, very high budget, you know, deeply developed kind of games. So I'm curious, like is there, are there thoughts about going into mobile or into less kind of rigorously developed games or are you really going to focus on like Assassin's Creed on Chain type of thing?
00:16:23.170 - 00:17:11.270, Speaker A: What we see right now is that studios building the highly polished AAA games are studios that are coming from a traditional gaming background and they are integrating the chain for the assets. So they are integrating Solana for NFT or maybe they have a token. And so typically we support them with some of our open source libraries like the Solana Unity SDK for example. Whereas fully on Chain games are more experimental in a way. So typically it's the smaller studios that can afford to take more risk or indie developers that build those experiences. And definitely I think mobile is going to be pivotal to popularize some of those games. I'm so bullish on Saga 2.
00:17:11.270 - 00:18:05.492, Speaker A: I cannot wait to see what happens when those 100,000 devices, whatever number they manage to sell is gonna start shipping and they get into the hands of users and we'll start to have more consumer experiences, namely games on that DAP store. So definitely we're really big on our mobile strategy. We did the integration with the Saga team early on in terms of supporting Unity with Saga and I think that is going to be an excellent distribution channel for these experiences. But yeah, typically that's this sort of dichotomy that we see in the market between students coming from a traditional gaming background versus studios that are more crypto native and can play around with this sort of more experimental tech stack.
00:18:05.636 - 00:18:55.334, Speaker B: The SEI network brought parallel execution to the EVM with their v2 update this past spring. Sub second finality and massive throughput are now available to EVM developers everywhere on SEI's High Performance Layer 1 incentives for users are coming to SEI this month from teams like Dragon Swap. Start farming on SEI today by visiting DragonSwap app. That's DragonSwap app. Thanks again to SEI for sponsoring today's episode. Yeah, so with a little bit of that introduction, I guess we should dive into ephemeral rollups, which is really Magic Block's calling card and what it's come to be known for. I guess maybe a place to start that's a little silly, but there was a video that like demo that you posted, I don't know, a couple months ago that went pretty viral.
00:18:55.334 - 00:19:24.990, Speaker B: I feel like I've seen it times and just people in the online Solana world were very excited about this. And it shows like a character moving around in a game on the top half of the screen and then the bottom half of the screen is like a cli spitting out a bunch of code. So can you just explain that video, like what's happening and how that sort of explains what an ephemeral rollup is doing?
00:19:26.060 - 00:20:24.234, Speaker A: For sure. I think that was sort of the aha moment of everyone realizing what ephemeral rollup can do. But to take a step back, the reason why we started on this whole journey of thinking how we could reduce latency on chain is because we were building fully on chain game ourselves. And after one or two, we realized that the UX was just really, really bad. Solana is amazing for providing composability. And so for if you think of experiences that are predicated upon the fact that anybody can build on top, they can compose with defi, they can compose with any smart contract, then Solana makes a lot of sense. But then if every interaction is a transaction, half a second is pretty bad UX for most games, players get pissed off if they have 100 millisecond latency.
00:20:24.234 - 00:21:12.356, Speaker A: So forget half a second. And so we didn't want to really build a roll up either because, like, there's no point in doing that. You are fragmenting the liquidity, you're moving away from user base developers, you're losing access to state. And so we came up with this idea that you can leverage the SVM and its feature in order to delegate and move only part of the state temporarily into a faster node, into a faster SVM node. So what we did is we almost rewrote from scratch a Solana node. We started before Anza started to modularize the SVM. So we started from the 1.17
00:21:12.356 - 00:22:00.410, Speaker A: validator client. We remove a bunch of rust crates, we really optimize the execution environment so the ephemeral validator doesn't have gossip, doesn't have consensus. We remove all of those overheads and we just focus on execution. And so what developer can do is that they can build a smart contract on Solana as they would do normally. They can run transaction there, but when they need it, they can delegate. They can interact with an on chain smart contract and a node will pick up the request, will clone the state into this ephemeral validator, and from that point onward you can write on that state in the ephemeral rollup. And you cannot write on the state on Solana because that state on Solana gets locked.
00:22:00.410 - 00:23:11.148, Speaker A: So you have this way of cloning that particular state and now you can run transaction there much faster, not only because the execution environment itself has been optimized, but also because you can co locate the node close to the use. So by means of colocation, what you're doing is you're reducing the network latency effectively you're not bound by consensus anymore. And so you can achieve, with the execution plus the networking, you achieve a latency that is around 50 milliseconds. So it's more than enough for real time multiplayer games. And from there on you run transaction on Solana for the state that is, you know, still there and unlocked. You run transaction in the ephemeral rollup for the states that are locked on Solana and delegated into the ephemeral rollup and everything is abstracted away. So what was happening in that video is that the position state of the player was delegated in the ephemeral rollup and therefore the character was running around and what you saw in the, in the terminal where the transaction logs.
00:23:11.148 - 00:24:25.972, Speaker A: But then what happens in the video is that we mint, where we capture a gem and we mint this token and we show that the token gets minted directly on Solana. And that is because the mint itself is happening on Solana. So you have this way to selectively decide what you keep on Solana and what you temporarily move into the FM roll up for the execution part. So all in all, what it does is it allows developers to build their application the same way that they would do on Solana, benefiting from composability and deep liquidity and defi and payments and all of that good stuff. But then if and when they need, they can tap into this faster execution environment, which by the way can also be customized to the specific applications that they are serving. So you could have loops, for example, which is something that typically games need to perform physical computation or to simulate the passage of time. So there's a whole bunch of customization that you can add to the ephemeral validator but again while maintaining the composability with the base layer.
00:24:26.116 - 00:24:59.680, Speaker B: That's a good overview. It almost strikes me as a similar insight to like ZK compression. If you've been following this on Solana, they, I think it's there, there's an announcement coming from them today. I have to check my telegram, but sort of the, the same insight that the state on Solana is kind of customizable and that it, it's, it's separated out in a way that it's not in Ethereum leads to some like really interesting kind of potential things like ephemeral roll ups.
00:25:00.180 - 00:25:43.570, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, correct. Ephemeral rollups are enabled by this native separation of state and logic that the SVM has compared to the evm. And the way to think about it is that ZK compression reduces storage cost of accounts. Ephemeral rollups reduce the compute cost. So it's a way to achieve potentially cheaper and more scalable compute, reduce the latency by means of colocation of the nodes and tap into specialized execution environments again on demand. So only when you need it without having to deploy your smart contract on L2 or having to leave Solana ever.
00:25:43.870 - 00:25:54.850, Speaker B: Yeah, and then my understanding is it's a fraud proof system. So it would work like Arbitrum or Optimism on Ethereum kind of in terms of the roll up side of it.
00:25:55.530 - 00:27:30.550, Speaker A: Is a slightly modified fraud proof system in the sense that you can potentially prove the whole session but in practice your knowledge validity proof are still not performant enough. And so we came up with this idea of a dynamic fraud proof where developers can specify fraud proof window and then any honest party can raise a challenge. But additionally you have a set of nodes that can be light clients that are sampling and verifying that the node is not cheating and they have to sign off the state before it gets finalized. So what happens is whenever a user or developer wants to roll the state back from the ephemeral validator to Solana because they want to, you know, unlock some, some other operations there, they request a commitment. The validator, the ephemeral validator post a commitment of a state div that is not finalized just yet. So these additional like lines have to sign off the state commitment and basically signaling that they are not raising a challenge and everything happened correctly and the validator is not cheating and only when the threshold of signature is reached and the challenge window elapsed, then the seed becomes final. So it's still a fraud proof system because anybody can, any honest party can raise the challenge and then you enter into the dispute game and you have to resolve that dispute game to a zk.
00:27:30.550 - 00:28:26.280, Speaker A: But assuming that everything happens correctly, as it should be in an optimistic system, you need to wait for these light plans to verify that the validator didn't did anything wrong. Basically only at that point the state becomes final. So it's a slightly modified flow through system in the sense that you have this dynamic challenge period. And the reason behind it is that we don't want to wait seven days before that state becomes final. There's no reason from first principle why or really any technical reason why the fro window is seven days. It's just that that is sort of a social construct. There is enough time for anyone as party to raise a challenge and if something wrong happens then you can socially coordinate to fork the system instead.
00:28:26.280 - 00:29:26.200, Speaker A: If you are reducing the fraud proof window, you are decreasing the probability that someone's party is raising a challenge. But that's why you need the Light clients to actually be monitoring and watching, acting as Watchtower to keep the node that is running that ephemeral obsession in check and then sign off that state commitment before it can get finalized. So yeah, that's kind of the system that we design in order to have good security properties in the FM roll up. Because obviously whenever you are delegating the state, there you are effectively trusting this centralized validator that doesn't have consensus to behave honestly. Except that if you have the additional security committee then you don't have to trust the node anymore. The Light clients are incentivized to act as Watchtower and they will get a reward if the node is misbehaving.
00:29:26.780 - 00:30:27.570, Speaker B: Okay, so I want to bring this back to the video game level then. So I'm playing a game and sort of like my understanding is a little bit that some things, some things in fully on chain games are going to need ephemeral roll ups. Some things Solana will do well enough and you won't need an ephemeral roll up. So is the idea that if you start doing some very intensive thing, I don't know what that would be in a game. I can't come up with an example off the top of my head. But that magic blocks engine will create an ephemeral roll up and then, and then that's like one roll up that's sort of has data being added to it for as long as you're playing the game. And then when you turn off your console the the data gets posted to the layer 1 or like I guess just at the connection to the Video game level.
00:30:27.570 - 00:30:29.190, Speaker B: How does all of that function?
00:30:30.170 - 00:31:08.970, Speaker A: Yeah, so first of all, all that we described so far happens behind the hood. Like users don't really feel any of this. But by default we think that you should be running games tightly on Solana. Except that when you need low latency, namely 50 millisecond latency, the block time is 400 millisecond. Right now it would probably get to 150 millisecond or around that. That latency is still not low enough to justify a smooth ux. If players have to perform transaction at every game interaction.
00:31:08.970 - 00:32:08.004, Speaker A: And so for multiplayer game, fast paced PvP game, you might need an FM roll up, but you can only move the state of the position for example and you keep all the other high value transactions such as tokens, payments, NFT on Solana itself. So you don't have to bridge, you don't have to do anything, you just temporarily move delegate that state into the ephemeral rollup. So from that point onwards if a player is playing from Singapore, it will access a node that is co located close to that area of the world. So you can also reduce the network latency. Which by the way is exactly what happens with traditional multiplayer game server. They have this way of cluster users around geographical areas and then at that point they will just play the game. They don't need to bridge, they don't need to use different wallets, they don't need to use different payment method, they can reuse whatever is currently available on Solana.
00:32:08.004 - 00:32:53.928, Speaker A: It's just that whenever they are changing the position of their players, that particular piece of stake will change in the ephemeral. That's the only difference. But you don't even notice it. Everything is abstracted away from you and that's a technical reason for it. And then whenever they, let's say that someone win a game, they want to get their NFT or they want to get their payout, whatever, then that's where the whole kind of security committee has to intervene. Because at that point you have to prove that the move that have been performed by the validator are indeed correct. And so at that point when there is a request to commit that position state back on chain, then the whole security committee verified that the state is indeed correct.
00:32:53.928 - 00:33:32.558, Speaker A: The light clients sign off the state commitment and then at that point you can trigger an NFT reward on Solana. If you are again doing a payment, you can run it through Solana perfectly fine. If you are minting an nft, you will do it through Solana. Instead, there's no reason to use an FM rollup. There's no reason to really move that state away from Solana. And the other important idea is that also the smart contract are on Solana themselves. So if you are updating the state every now and then, someone using an existing RPC can still read that state because it's the same data.
00:33:32.558 - 00:34:43.208, Speaker A: It's just an account that has been locked and now it's updated. So yeah, that's how we envision really a firm rollup working in the context of a game. And in this example I was discussing about the position of a player. But if you extend that view, then you can have really like a broad variety of system being built on top of this technology. You could have a central limit order book, for example, that have liquidity on Solana, but then run the matching engine on these FM rollups. I was reading a tweet from Toli who was mentioning that it would be cool to have different instances around the world that could run at 10 milliseconds and where users can submit this bid and ask and you then have a way to resolve those order book, those matching engine on chain and the liquidity stays on Solana. So that is something that FM rollups are uniquely equipped to enable because it's the exact same setting is collocation of the nodes, really fast execution without having to leave the chain.
00:34:43.208 - 00:34:51.580, Speaker A: And you're only moving in that case, you're bidden asking to DFM roll ups while you are maintaining your liquidity on Solana itself.
00:34:52.880 - 00:35:19.392, Speaker B: And one other thing I think we should add is the term ephemeral just means like temporary. It's called an ephemeral roll up because it's not always in this state of running the roll up. Right. So it can kind of, you know, disappear and just turn into regular Solana. And then a temporary roll up can be spun up during these moments where you need low latency. That's. That's kind of why it's called an ephemeral roll up.
00:35:19.392 - 00:35:19.980, Speaker B: Right?
00:35:20.600 - 00:35:46.348, Speaker A: Correct. In a way they are, they're almost stateless. The. The state that is in the ephemeral rol of state that exists on Solana. You cannot create new accounts in the ephemeral. You always have to create an account on Solana first and then you can mirror that state, run some state transition, and then update the original account with that updated state. That's what an FML rollup does.
00:35:46.348 - 00:36:40.010, Speaker A: And just in time is another term that you can use. Basically we want to stress the idea that you could use these systems only if and when you need them. So you could also have a way to dynamically offload some transaction whenever there is some hot state. For example, if a smart contract or an account gets more than a certain amount of requests per second, then you offload some of those transactions in the rollup and then whenever congestion is solved, you wind that session down and you're fine. So they're quite versatile and we think it's really one of the best way to preserve the composability of Solana and without, you know, ever needed to needing to leave Solana itself.
00:36:42.030 - 00:37:41.480, Speaker B: So a criticism that's sometimes made by Solana people of the Ethereum layer 2 ecosystem is that a lot of these L2s, which is where a lot of this sort of transaction volume in the Ethereum world happens now, are at some level controlled by multisigs that you need to trust that they're being honest and they're not going to screw you over. So I'm just curious, running a similar kind of optimistic roll up system while at the same time talking about the ability to permissionlessly create on top of games and that games should run fully on chain for all of the kind of benefits that that creates. Like is there a tension there to you? Or how do you think through the kind of security implications of running like an optimistic fraud proof system to make on chain games happen?
00:37:42.350 - 00:38:40.490, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. So whenever you are delegating or accelerating some transaction with an FM roll up, you have to make sure that there is a security and all the trust assumptions in place to make sure that you're not really trusting a centralized party. The point is that the system is completely opt in, so you could use that same game entirely on Solana. For certain type of games, especially fast paced PvP games, the performances might be degraded, but you can still play with that game without having to trust a counterparty if you really want. And even if you're temporarily trusting that counterparty, you're not really trusting it. If there's this system of nodes in place that makes sure that the validator is not cheating. And I didn't mention that matchblock aims to be a permissionless and open source system.
00:38:40.490 - 00:39:29.686, Speaker A: So right now the node is not open source just yet, but we will open source the node and at that point anybody will be able to run their own node or run nodes for their own users if they want and really contribute to this extension quite literally of the network again on demand and only when there's need. It's a completely opt in system. You don't have to use it if you don't want. It's just a way to extend what Solana cannot do. Which again, minimizing the latency by means of colocation or having specialized execution environment for applications. So yeah, that's kind of the answer there. And it's not to say that again, we don't have to take security seriously seriously.
00:39:29.686 - 00:40:10.710, Speaker A: We obviously have to make sure that the nodes are being kept in check by this System of Light clients that sample and verify the transaction and the node will get slashed. They have to have some economic bond in order to, you know, some other party to be incentivized to run those checks. So yeah, that's kind of a balancing act. But we think it's one of the best trade off that you can do if you're introducing additional off chain compute. Because again, you don't deploy your smart contract on an FM rule. Your smart contract are always going to be on Solana and you're always going to be to transact on Solana as you would do normally.
00:40:11.770 - 00:41:19.610, Speaker B: And so that maybe can be a window into just more broadly. I was preparing for this episode and thinking a bit about how there's different ways to think about like there's kind of broad agreement that you can't do fully on chain games just like on Ethereum or something because the latency would just be too high. But there's other versions of kind of what Magic Block is doing with different theses. So there's Sonic SVM is one that comes to mind which uses the SVM but calls itself a L2 and I believe it settles to Ethereum. I'm not entirely sure. There's also immutable ZKEVM which is building this kind of zero knowledge L2 for gaming. So I guess just do you like, maybe I'll start with why don't you just build a L2 and why are you building the kind of roll up that doesn't exist outside of Solana instead?
00:41:21.070 - 00:42:06.970, Speaker A: Yeah, again we don't think L2 make much sense in the sense that you're really fragmenting the ecosystem. And we've seen these empirically through the lenses of the Ethereum ecosystem where you used to have this amazing and vibrant environment where everybody was building and contributing and playing around with Defi and all of that good stuff. And then all of a sudden you have like 50100 different L2s, like you're fragmenting. The Mindshare user base is really like it's not clear what is the chain that you should go on. It's not clear for the developers. Different programming languages, different stocks, different trust assumptions. It's a mess.
00:42:06.970 - 00:43:08.886, Speaker A: We love the idea of a single state machine. We love the idea of having everything on the sim layer. We have been on Solana since pre ftx. So we are all on board with the vision that Solana have. But at the same time we recognize that there are some limitations that a general purpose VM cannot address for specific kind of applications or in order to have these really, really low level of latency that's probably that even the Solana in its last kind of form cannot achieve. And so the point of building a firm roller Solar than an L2 is precisely to extend Solana capabilities and introduce new use cases that could build on Solana and leverage those amazing feature that Solana have. Rather than being extractive or to build our own thing.
00:43:08.886 - 00:43:24.370, Speaker A: But then having to rebuild an ecosystem from scratch, you would need to bridge, you would need to ask Circle to issue native. As you see there, it would be a complete mess. We are really not much into that.
00:43:24.990 - 00:43:35.090, Speaker B: Will there ever be a Magic Block native token or are you planning on staying just with Solana as the sort of token for the game engine?
00:43:36.230 - 00:45:07.356, Speaker A: So the token is serving to bootstrap the node operators, the node operators that are going to provide this additional compute for Solana developers. So tokens have proven to be an amazing distribution channel or like rather than distribution channel bootstrapping mechanism for node operators since Bitcoin basically. And so that is one of the main reason why I think a token would make sense. But then in terms of what users should use, ephemeral apps are meant to look and feel like an extension to Solana quite literally. So they should always use native assets. They shouldn't have to bridge, they should use Sol. And if you are alluding at the fact that we could potentially be extractive to the ecosystem, the point is that if you're introducing and enabling use cases that are not possible because the latency isn't there, or because you don't have the ability to customize the runtime, you are bringing more users on chain than now are using BONK or USDC or ORCA or Jupiter and they are therefore introducing more transaction on Solana itself, even if some of those transactions are being performed perhaps in an ephemeral rollup.
00:45:07.356 - 00:45:39.460, Speaker A: So I think the end goal and like one of the core mission of MagicBlock is really to be to bring more users to Solana by means of enabling these I different use cases that are not possible on Solana right now and therefore contributing to adding more value because now those users are going to transact on the network and they're going to pay with USDC or BONK or interacting with the SMART contract and protocols that are on the chain.
00:45:40.200 - 00:46:39.196, Speaker B: Yeah, that was why I was asking a bit. Is that the sort of Layer two versus network extension debate that's being had by some nerds in the Solana and Ethereum world? A lot of it comes down to the fact that the Ethereum layer 2s sort of arguably accrue value to their native token rather than to eth. And so the kind of economic value of the Ethereum layer 1 is limited by the fact that a lot of fees are being paid to these L2 sequencers. And so yeah, I was asking for that reason about the native token because if Magic Block was driving value to its token instead of to Solana, then there's. There is maybe that parasitic relationship. But yeah, you sort of explained that a bit with our last couple minutes here. Andrea, I just wanted to ask about, I guess like firstly you released this demo video.
00:46:39.196 - 00:46:53.690, Speaker B: We've talked a lot about what you're building. I'm just curious, what are the timelines for things like when are, when are you going to be to market? When. When do you think we'll start seeing fully on chain games that are being built with the Magic Block engine?
00:46:54.990 - 00:47:30.430, Speaker A: Yeah, we're about to release on mainnet with a widelisted version of Ephemeral rollups and we have a lineup of game that are going to announce pretty soon and so you're going to be able to test Ephemeral rollups yourself and play with some of those games on Solana mainnet and so leveraging tokens that are on Solana but also with the extra capabilities of real time performances that Ephemeral have introduced. So yeah, pretty exciting times when it comes to seeing some of these games in action.
00:47:33.690 - 00:47:41.270, Speaker B: What's the biggest source of delay or just what's the most time consuming part of building Magic Block?
00:47:44.260 - 00:48:51.320, Speaker A: You mean from. Well, 90% of our engineering has been focused on improving the execution environment of the node of the Ephemeral Validator. We recently published a containerized version of the node that weights 47 megabytes. So super lightweight and at the same time if you run it locally against a Solana node, you'll see that is about 15, 20 times faster just because we really optimize the execution environment. Then there's a bunch of other developer tooling, developer tools that we have to build out in order to allow developers to really just build on Solana as they would normally do and then not having to think about even changing rpc. But whenever they interact with the on chain program, which is a delegation program, they can tap into this extra capacity and extra capabilities that the Ferment rollups provide. So that has been most of our engineering efforts so far.
00:48:52.100 - 00:49:03.680, Speaker B: Interesting. And how much of your time goes into just developing Magic Block versus finding games to actually serve as clients and build with the engine?
00:49:05.170 - 00:49:54.586, Speaker A: Yeah, so I'm pretty proud that so far we spend zero time reaching out to games. And so we've seen a good amount of demand, you know, from some of the game gems that we organize or we are recently sponsoring. Radar, the Colosseum, global hackathon. And so we are really seeing excitement in terms of not only games, but also in terms of other applications and how they want to not move into an L2, but really use the FM roll ups to stay on Solana and get those additional capabilities. And then from now on, we want to start creating some of these experiences ourselves. We think that we are obviously uniquely equipped to. We understand deeply the tech stack.
00:49:54.586 - 00:50:22.570, Speaker A: And so we really want to build some of those consumer experiences ourselves. And at the same time, we would start reaching out to studios that are outside of the Solana ecosystem. Now that we're seeing CCP and evolve, starting to build some of these fully on chain games, we think that the times are ripe enough to really onboard a whole other bunch of users on Solana itself.
00:50:24.110 - 00:50:34.310, Speaker B: Just out of curiosity, do you play video games in your spare time these days? Or is it like, I need a break from that world? I'm not gonna, you know, play games that I'm not working.
00:50:35.250 - 00:50:47.790, Speaker A: Yeah. These days it's mostly about finding out what. What is the latest fully on chain game out there. And sometimes I play Halo, but yeah, not. Not much time to do that, honestly.
00:50:48.130 - 00:50:53.190, Speaker B: Gotcha. Yeah, it's been a while since I played Halo, man. But what a fun. What a fun game.
00:50:54.050 - 00:50:54.990, Speaker A: Amazing.
00:50:55.970 - 00:51:34.700, Speaker B: So I'm also curious to hear, I think listeners would be interested in. MagicBlock went through the a16z crypto startup accelerator, which is a pretty sort of prestigious accelerator that they do, I think twice a year. And a 16Z has very deep crypto investments, but maybe less so in recent times. And I think people are just always interested in what Andreessen's thinking because it is such a huge venture fund. So I just wanted to ask, what was the A16Z accelerator like? How was the experience?
00:51:36.280 - 00:52:26.584, Speaker A: Well, the whole A16Z team has deep expertise on the operational side of things. So what you got if you join the accelerator is basically the ability to interact with their team of cryptographers, researcher, engineers, marketers, lawyers, you name it. So it's a deeply, deeply kind of foundational experience for an early stage startup. It definitely help us a lot. And then at the same time, it's very cool to see that the whole A16Z is super bullish on games and gaming. And so they invested in a bunch of fully on chain games themselves. They invested in the two that I named before, Piran Nation and Eve.
00:52:26.584 - 00:52:44.384, Speaker A: And so yeah, they have been amazing partners so far and I'm sure they will keep helping us in different shapes and forms. So highly recommend it for any like early stage startup out there. For sure.
00:52:44.552 - 00:52:59.200, Speaker B: Yeah. From the conversations you had with people over there, what does the bullishness on crypto gaming stem from? What's their thesis for why it's a good place to invest their money and hope for venture size returns.
00:52:59.360 - 00:53:58.804, Speaker A: So games are one of the way through which you can really onboard a lot of users by means of, you know, this additional level of ownership that digital assets provide. That's sort of the simple thesis. And then if you go on a deeper level, you start reasoning around those ideas that we were talking about before. So these digital realities that can persist forever. As soon as our AI overlords are going to take over. As humans, we'd have to find out ways to spend our time. And like James has been evolving and in really interesting way, there are these very pervasive experiences that are going to keep increasing in terms of fidelity and also in terms of, yeah, just kind of more active digital experiences compared to, let's say watching Netflix.
00:53:58.804 - 00:54:47.840, Speaker A: And so they're more interactive, of course. And so yeah, it's just both on a kind of broader societal level and then also just in terms of ability to onboard the next wave of consumers into crypto. If you think about it, 2017, Ethereum got clogged through CryptoKitties, a game. And then next cycle, 2021 Stepn, right, and Axie Infinity. So in sort of both the previous cycle, the best consumer application were games. And so I'm ready to bet that we're going to see kind of another cycle where we really onboard the next 10 million 100 million players through a really, really successful game.
00:54:49.180 - 00:55:47.600, Speaker B: So the gaming industry in general is struggling right now. And I was having a conversation the other day because a friend of a friend is a game designer who is working on a game that was sort of funded during the pandemic. And the kind of demand for it has dried up in the years since that it took to create the game. And it started this conversation of during COVID when everyone was posting about playing that Nintendo Switch game with the animals that is escaping me right now. And like everyone was inside and video games were just a big part of life for a lot of people. It seemed like video games were just like the popularity of video games is a lot greater than maybe it is today. Have you seen that just in the time that you've been building Magic Block over the past couple of years that maybe there was a.
00:55:47.600 - 00:56:00.250, Speaker B: A bit of an overestimate in terms of how popular games would be coming out of the COVID era to a world where people just aren't on screens as much.
00:56:01.510 - 00:56:54.530, Speaker A: Yeah. So we started building matchblock in 2023. So we were really kind of beyond that initial wave of influx of new users. And also on the crypto side of thing, that whole like phase where a lot of projects raise ton of money and start launching NFT and stuff like that. So I haven't really seen a stark downtrend, at least from the adoption of our user base. Vice versa, I've seen an increase. But it's completely true that the game industry sort of peaked around Covid and then right now is kind of going through this phase where there's really a saturation to the game genre that are out there.
00:56:54.530 - 00:57:53.556, Speaker A: Roughly half of the revenue in the gaming industry is generated through mobile. And the business model of mobile is completely broken. Aside from the fat fees that the app stores are taking, they're taking a healthy 30% cut on whatever developers are earning. But also when it comes to monetization, typically 2% of the players are actively paying for a game. And so you have games that have to hyper optimize for ads or really create this super airtight kind of user acquisition channel where every cents counts really. And so there's plenty of opportunity for crypto to completely disrupt that model in terms of on so many levels like payments discovery, user acquisition, on chain referrals, new game genre that are not possible off chain. There's so many level that are ripe for disruption.
00:57:53.556 - 00:57:59.640, Speaker A: And so that is another way and another reason why we're so bullish on these experiences.
00:58:00.380 - 00:58:16.862, Speaker B: Do you think there's a public perception problem a bit with. With integrating crypto into games just in that people that aren't in the crypto web 3world already tend to be sort of suspicious of that world 100%?
00:58:16.966 - 00:59:14.750, Speaker A: Yeah. And I Think part of that is sort of a knee jerk reaction compared to the previous cycle where a lot of projects that were frankly like really bad, like decide to launch NFT or like token because, you know, whatever, like web3 gaming was the future. Now we're seeing more quality games coming to market. And you know, that's not to say that the perception is completely changed, but it's not definitely as stylish as it used to be. And at the same time it's also often a matter of terminology. So for a fully unchained game you don't even have to have an NFT if you, if, if you don't want, if it doesn't make sense, you can call it a digital asset and people will be, will be probably fine. And if they, if they don't really like, if you're not using the term crypto, you're using the term forever game or autonomous war, then they're willing to at least explore.
00:59:14.750 - 00:59:36.440, Speaker A: And if the game is fun, then they're hooked. So yeah, I think there's definitely a terminology problem there. But also, you know, it's just a matter of having more games and really getting the experiences that we can build on chain on par with what you can currently do off chain.
00:59:37.100 - 00:59:57.970, Speaker B: Yeah, and that's kind of the whole ball game a bit is just, is the game going to be fun? I think some of the aforementioned, like Axie Infinity or whatever, they're not necessarily fun for what they are outside of speculation. And if you can just get these games to market that are really fun regardless of the crypto element, I think that's the biggest, the biggest piece.
00:59:59.030 - 01:00:29.378, Speaker A: I mean, yeah, fun or net new and interesting in a new way. Like if a game gets financialized for some reason and that's fine for some users that's fine as well. Right. Like it's just going to be a game that perhaps the crypto native are playing and not the traditional players but you know, is still valuable. And so I really like don't have any preconception of what's fun and what not. Fun means a lot of different things for different people. Like what I find fun might be like disgusting for someone else.
01:00:29.378 - 01:01:46.810, Speaker A: And so I think of course the game has to be fun because like a game by definition is, you know, someone overcoming some obstacle and finding pleasure out of that process that that's really what a game is. And so I think it's interesting to move the narrative forward, bring new game jar, innovate on the design space and then really find out what we can do with these experiences and potentially create digital worlds that can exist forever. I mean, that whole concept, that whole rabbit hole can go in so many different direction and it's so interesting in and on itself that can potentially be completely disruptive compared to the kind of games that we used to play right now. And especially if you take into account AR VR, all that sort of incremental technology that are AI in terms of the ability for players to generate their own assets, to generate their own story, to come up with their own lore. And so, yeah, just so, so many interesting things happening all of a sudden and all together that I cannot not be bullish on games.
01:01:47.670 - 01:02:12.764, Speaker B: Yeah, it'll be interesting to see how it all unfolds for sure. Especially, like over the coming months and year. That is, unfortunately, all the time that we have for today, but it's been a really good conversation. Andrea, thank you for coming on. I'm excited to see sort of what Magic Block has in store. Congrats on the raise. Best of luck with sort of getting things to mainnet.
01:02:12.764 - 01:02:15.360, Speaker B: And thank you very much for coming on Lightspeed.
01:02:16.180 - 01:02:19.660, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for having me. It was a pleasure.
