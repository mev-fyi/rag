00:00:00.200 - 00:00:20.558, Speaker A: Rewind to like, just a year ago. People just thought, okay, Salon's dead. Like totally dead. Chain. Everybody left. The developers are leaving, 75 developers, whatnot. And then now perhaps the biggest payments company on earth, along with visa at least, is live demoing a new crypto integration for the entire industry using Solana.
00:00:20.686 - 00:00:49.914, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by Helium Mobile. They've created a crypto native phone plan for unlimited talk, text and data for just $20 a month. We'll chat more about them later in the show. Before we get moving on today's episode, just a quick disclaimer. The views expressed on this podcast by either myself, my co host, or any guests are their personal views and do not represent the views of any associated organization. Nothing in the episode should be construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal, or any other advice. Okay, let's jump into the episode.
00:00:49.914 - 00:01:16.222, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Lightspeed. I are here for another roundup. We are recording this on the 1 May. So happy spring. I think May 1 is the first day of spring, but we're going to pretend like it is busy, busy weeks in Solana land over the past couple days. And so it's been a while. It feels like we've been a while since we've done a roundup.
00:01:16.222 - 00:02:07.108, Speaker B: So a lot of ground to cover. But one of the most exciting things for me was this stripe news. So in a world of like, SEC lawsuits, tiresome infrastructure launches, meme coin gambling, and all of this, we finally got a huge canary, if you will, of somebody actually bringing real world adoption into blockchain rails. Stripe announced that they're bringing crypto payments directly into their platform. So anyone who uses stripe for payments can actually receive payments in crypto. And there's a full 40 minutes talk on exactly what the details of this are, and more broadly on their vision of transactions instantly settling on chain. But there's a two or three minute segment specifically where they did a live demo.
00:02:07.108 - 00:02:30.108, Speaker B: And so anybody who's done any sort of presentation knows the risks of a live demo. And they did the demo on Solana, no less. And this was like, I think it occurred on the 24th or 25 April. So they did a live demo on Solana, like weeks after, days after, a bunch of patches went live to try to clear up some network congestion. And it worked. It worked flawlessly. It was beautiful.
00:02:30.108 - 00:02:38.984, Speaker B: Exciting to see from such a powerful company like stripe. I want to get your take on. I know you watched the clip and it was pretty cool to see, but when I get your take on the whole thing.
00:02:40.324 - 00:03:29.922, Speaker A: Yeah, I think you said it well, it was the founder of Stripe or their brothers. I think one is a CEO and one is, I don't know what he does. I think coo or something. And I was surprised that it was the founder doing the demo. And no less, he was doing a live demo, like you said, on Solana, days after congestion, or really during congestion, I would still say we're not really out of the woods yet. And in front of a lot of people to announce a pretty integration, because I believe stripe had support for crypto, like, a few years ago, and it just was like a bit clunky for them, I believe. Like, I think they had, like, bitcoin payments, and then now they just brought it back with, you know, like you said, crypto is back.
00:03:29.922 - 00:03:58.584, Speaker A: And I think he said something like, don't blink or you'll miss it or something. So, yeah, that was good to see. And I think it's, like, pretty underrated that they use Solana to do that. Right. If you zoom out and rewind to just a year ago, maybe slightly before then, people just thought, okay, Solana is dead. Like totally dead chain. Everybody left, the developers are leaving, 75 developers, whatnot.
00:03:58.584 - 00:04:35.684, Speaker A: And then now perhaps the biggest payments company on earth, along with visa at least, is live demoing a new crypto integration for the entire industry using Solana. And then to be clear, it's not just Solana they support. They also support Ethereum and Polygon. But they did a demo using Solana, presumably because it confirms the fastest would be my guess. But Phantom had support for all three. So, yeah, I mean, I'm pretty proud of about it. And, like, it's, there's kind of a theme here, right? Like there's.
00:04:35.684 - 00:05:07.896, Speaker A: For. Visa first expanded to Solana with their pilot. Mastercard actually did the same, which kind of went under the radar a little bit. Stripe is now doing the same. Shopify had already done that as well, shopify pay. And then one of the things that really impressed me about Solana is like, and I don't want to, like, maybe show Helios here, but, like, if you go to, like, helios website and look at the use case under payments, um, we work with these teams and they're like all ex Venmo or like ex PayPal. Um.
00:05:07.896 - 00:05:55.062, Speaker A: Oh, by the way, PayPal is also supporting Solana now soon with the, their stable coin that's already on Ethereum. Um, the amount of payments talent on the, on the chain is pretty insane to me. Like, I worked in digital payments before. This is actually why I got into crypto. And I've never seen such a concentration of people who understand payments inside and out, both from a consumer level, but also an enterprise level. And so payments generally take longer to really start flourishing just because there's a lot of hurdles in terms of legal and regulatory adoption. But this just shows that the tech there is very, very ready for payments.
00:05:55.062 - 00:06:43.120, Speaker A: And I think, like a global state machine just makes much more sense for global payments because the existing payment systems in the world are basically these kind of sets of islands that you have, and there's kind of different systems within them. And that's kind of how you end up with fractured systems. You can never truly abstract that away. There's always something you can't abstract away, like, it's always a cat and mouse game. So I think, I mean, it kind of just confirms my personal thesis that integrated out ones, especially ones like Solana, which have shown kind of results in production, have, are kind of the right solution for payments. So. But then it's also running on Polygon.
00:06:43.120 - 00:06:51.374, Speaker A: I believe it's the POS chain, though I could be wrong on that. So we'll see how it progresses with these different architectures.
00:06:51.994 - 00:07:45.234, Speaker B: Yeah, it's interesting you brought up the architecture side of this as well, because they made a decision in my mind of there was two routes. There's a fork in the road. At some point in the rollout of this, where do you roll out support for the major chains? I think they post announced, but they also integrated avalanche, I believe. So they have a good group of chains where activity is happening. Do you roll out support in that way? Versus the alternative, which is launch? A former colleague of mine actually tweeted this, and this is cool and all, but you're not using the latest and greatest infrared tools. Why not roll out an app specific l two, like op stack chain that's using a celestia for DA, so it'd be super cheap and kind of go that route so you don't have the noisy name or problem. You're guaranteed low pay, low fees and whatnot, because you'd kind of be the only activity happening on this chain.
00:07:45.234 - 00:08:28.258, Speaker B: And I actually thought that was an interesting perspective because to me, they took a view, they took a stance and didn't go that route. I don't know how intentional that was, but to me, when I was thinking about this, they're a payments business, a multi billion dollar payments business. They're not a blockchain company. They don't want to think about running a chain, they don't want to think about the infrastructure setup that is required to do that as opposed to what they did, which is just roll out smart contracts on a limited number of chains and like process payments that way. And I think it often gets lost on like, the challenges of actually launching a chain. Right. You need to set up like reliable RPC support.
00:08:28.258 - 00:08:51.664, Speaker B: You need native USDC, native USDT or any other tokens you want to like actually process payment payments in. You need a block explorer so people can actually see what's happening on your chain. You probably want to get your data integrated to, you know, I feel like I'm going on the same rant I've gone on many times on this show. You need to get your data out there. So I'm like doing it flip side or all of them, so people can actually interact with it. And like, none of those things are trivial. Those are like all things that require a lift.
00:08:51.664 - 00:09:29.440, Speaker B: And I brought that up and his response was, yeah, there's like RaSp providers, right? People spin up a chain for you these days and I'm like, a multi billion dollar business is not going to use a six month old startup. And I love the conduit team. I think they're great people and they're building a really great product. It'd be exciting to see where it goes in the future. But I think that's ludicrous to think a multibillion dollar company would like, use a Ras provider. Or the alternative is like, do it yourself, which is time and a significant amount of money. I'm just curious how you think about the actual rollout being on existing integrated chains as opposed to their own roll up or l two or even l one.
00:09:29.440 - 00:09:30.884, Speaker B: That's just for their payments.
00:09:32.224 - 00:10:27.026, Speaker A: Yeah, I have. I think that's super silly. Take to do global payments on an isolated environment. Right? Like, I think one of the, okay, like, if you look at Swift today or just how digital payments work, one of the biggest problems with payments in existing systems is that it always needs to take hops to get to its destination. And every time you take a hop, especially in web two, there's take rates and there's latency and there's potentially a difference in regulatory approaches for those different jurisdictions. And then in the context of crypto, especially, every hop now also has the additional complexity of different trust requirements and assumptions and bridge complexity. And you might say, okay, well, there's going to be near or like polygon in some period of time where they unify this.
00:10:27.026 - 00:11:24.004, Speaker A: It's like, okay, and then maybe then stripe can come back and do that. But that's years away. It has not been tested, it has not shown anything in production currently. And so then as an engineer, you look at this and you say, okay, well, obviously the best solution is a global kind of state machine, because what do you want? You want first, composability with existing rails you can instantly plug into USDC, for example, or PayPal USD, or whatever stablecoin you want, infrastructure that's already set up for you. Like you said, there's all sorts of data providers already, RPC providers, different teams that build services for that chain, like different payments integrations as well, like Solana pay or like different gas relayers or whatnot. A set of validators that already maintain the chain for you. Right? You can obviously run your own full note as well.
00:11:24.004 - 00:12:45.464, Speaker A: And so, like, I just, two of the things that I think make much more sense to live in a unified l one are just defi, so finance and in payments, like, those two things make much more sense to me that they are on a shared environment, unified or universal environment, rather than kind of these different islands connected through, you know, cryptography eventually, but currently they'd require quite a bit of trust. So I think that, you know, I'm not sure if they did this on, on purpose. Like, I doubt that stripe was like, very into these discussions. Probably what happened there is Solana, avalanche, etcetera. Polygon have very solid business development support, right? They have very competent people in those roles that can handhold you, that can give you resources, that can hook you up, help with marketing, all sorts of things. So, you know, I think, like suggesting something like, why didn't they just do an app chain and then use Celestia as da? And then, like, that's just so complex. Like, nobody cares about this, okay? And I don't understand how that would be the best solution.
00:12:45.464 - 00:13:37.098, Speaker A: Like, a transaction on Salana is still usually cheaper than that. And by the way, with local free markets, which are admittedly bugging implementation, but that's an implementation bug which is being fixed once that happens, payments are super easy to, or trivial to paralyze, right? Like if I send you a payment and then, you know, my dad sends my grandpa a payment, those are paralyzed. They pay different fees or they pay the same low fees that aren't affected by some other hotspot. So I just, I'm super. And maybe like, I did work on digital payments at canadian banks and fintechs. So, like, I do have PTSD from, from doing that potentially. But, uh, I I just think a global, uh, infrastructure that you can plug into without worrying about all these weird fractal situations is just much more comfortable for me.
00:13:37.266 - 00:14:03.116, Speaker B: All right, let's take a quick break to talk about helium mobile. Every month I'm reminded of the pain of a phone bill. For someone who is terminally online, those tainted charges are no joke. Well, helium mobile is bringing a crypto native solution to this. It's powered by a combination of a decentralized wireless network and the nation's largest 5g network to bring reliable coverage to its users. The coolest part for me are definitely the mobile token rewards. They're earned by sharing a location which allows more people to build coverage where it's needed most.
00:14:03.116 - 00:14:30.710, Speaker B: So effectively, the token rewards end up bringing a better product to the customer. But even cooler, you can take these rewards and pay for your phone bill directly within the app. This is a beautiful showcase of arguably Crypto's two strongest use cases, incentivized user action and crypto payment rails. The phone plan is unlimited talk, text and data. Plus it's affordable at just $20 a month. If this sounds interesting to you, go to hellohelium.com to get three free months of service with the code lightspeed mobile.
00:14:30.710 - 00:14:47.898, Speaker B: Again, that's lightspeed mobile. All caps, no spaces. Be sure to check out the link in the show notes for easy access. Alright guys, let's get back to the show. Yeah, and that makes sense. I definitely agree with the sentiment there. I'm trying to play Devil's advocate here, though, just for the sake of the argument.
00:14:47.898 - 00:15:21.016, Speaker B: And what are the advantages? I guess one advantage would be Solana sucked really, really bad for about a three to four week span there. And if I'm a payments processor, I do not want that experience from my user. They did integrate a handful of chains where if Solana was broken, that doesn't mean crypto payments are broken. You have other options. Um, but I guess, like one benefit would be you have your own. No, like the only thing happening would be your transactions. But I like to your point about femarkets.
00:15:21.016 - 00:16:09.672, Speaker B: Like, I agree, um, transfers are going to be low CU requirement transactions that shouldn't be intensive by any capacity and should be parallel paralyzable. What's also cool here is like, I'm 100% going to build a dashboard that tracks all of stripes payments across all these different chains. Like, how cool is that? We see the real time economic activity happening in the physical world through the proxy of a blockchain. Then that shit is so cool to me, which you could theoretically do on your own app chain, but I don't think we've seen any good data dissemination of any of these newer app chains that are being launched by these RAS providers. It's hard to get your data indexed because there is a manual process and indexing is not easy. So, yeah, I mean, I definitely agree.
00:16:09.768 - 00:16:45.876, Speaker A: To your point about potentially the, like, if there's a problem on the chain, like, what happens? Like, for example, used in the past three or maybe like two weeks ago as an example. Well, one, no blockchain is safe from implementation bugs. Right. One of these RAS services potentially might have a bug in it. Probably much more likely than Solana, actually, since Solana's been around for much longer and has a lot of engineers working on it now with multiple clients in the works. So that is going to be a problem regardless. Now, yeah, it did happen on Solana due to insane activity.
00:16:45.876 - 00:17:11.056, Speaker A: That's fair. There's actually a team called Code who's been on the show twice now. They actually noticed this in, like, 2021. They were one of the first teams to migrate, and they actually built the soft sequencer on their end such that if there's a problem on Solana, the payments still happen through their channels, but then it sells on Solana afterwards. Kind of like a quasi l two. So, you know, I mean, I think it's a fair concern, but I don't think it's unique to Solano.
00:17:11.200 - 00:17:31.848, Speaker B: Agreed. For sure. Agreed there. But, yeah, maybe that's a good, good ending point for the stripe discussion. Overall, I think it's huge, and I think my, still. My biggest takeaway of the whole thing is web two is excited to do the rebranding for us. Like, when I heard the whole, I'll put the link in the show notes, I encourage everyone to go listen to the two minute piece.
00:17:31.848 - 00:18:07.384, Speaker B: The 40 minutes thing is super cool, but the two minute piece exclusively is like a bit of an oh, shit moment. Um, so, yeah, I guess, uh, next segment, let's bring out the knives a little bit. Let's get people fired up. So, uh, I've been tracking Mev capture on the l one s for. I've been paying attention to this for quite some time. And more recently, I think this came back up, uh, because Jito has been crushing it and there's no way around it. So Jason Yanowitz, founder of Blockworks, had a podcast with Santiago and Kyle Samani, the Multicoin.
00:18:07.384 - 00:19:01.918, Speaker B: I think he manages the liquid book there. I'm not entirely sure if it's the liquid or the venture side, but nonetheless, Kyle and all of multicoin, I think, have this view that the only valuable piece of a blockchain is MEV. That is what you're valuing. They think transaction fees will trend to zero over time, um, as resources get more efficiently priced and machines get better. And because of that, I was like, huh? You know, I haven't plotted the mev capture on Solana, which, because of geo, has grown exponentially against that of Ethereum, which is sort of the mev capture giant with flashbots building mev boost roughly two years ago now. So I plotted this out on a chart, and, like, you know, I don't have a huge opinion on whether or not Kyle and Multicoin's framework on, like, Mev being the only valuable part of a blockchain being true or false. But nonetheless, it is pretty interesting to see the comparison here.
00:19:01.918 - 00:19:57.434, Speaker B: Solana, over the last two weeks has actually flipped Ethereum and MeV specifically, that is being returned to validators for the more technical folk in the audience. We're using the baseline MEV calculation pioneered by rated network for Ethereum, and then we're just counting all tips, less the 5% judo labs fee that are being processed by the digitobloc engine. So that is the comparison here. It is effectively the amount of MEV being returned to validators and personally think it's a good comp, but would be curious to debate it if anyone felt passionately about that not being the case. But nonetheless, what I think this does signal is what we've all known and just actively discussed over the last few months is economic activity is flourishing on chain, on Solana. Um, but I'm curious if you have any thoughts around the idea of MEv capture, uh, the merits of it. Is it good? Is it bad? Is it evil? Is it sinister and kind of like where it goes in the future?
00:19:58.414 - 00:20:04.022, Speaker A: Sure. Yeah, I actually wasn't aware of this. Um, so that's. That's interesting. I wasn't expecting that shout out to.
00:20:04.038 - 00:20:06.994, Speaker B: Those guys over at blockworks research, man. They're killing it.
00:20:08.294 - 00:20:41.224, Speaker A: Um, agreed. So, like, uh, you know, Mev has. It feels like one of those bell curve meme topics where, like, some people just are like, oh, Mev's evil. Just robbing retail or something. And it's like, okay, that's like, one way you can think about it, but really, Mev is just a thing that exists that you can't really avoid in block building. People will say some stupid shit like, oh, just randomize the transactions or something. It's like, that's not going to work.
00:20:41.224 - 00:21:23.866, Speaker A: What are you talking about? Um, like, you seriously think we did not try that or, like, thought about that in the past eight years? Um, so, like, it's just a thing that's going to exist, I think, um, I asked, um, uh, Lucas this question, actually, the CEO of judo on. On this. In this. On this podcast with Toli. And I think his answer was, like, he sees the end state as being super transparent, accessible, and democratized. Like, something along those lines. Like, I think what sucks or what potentially could suck is, like, Mev is being done by, like, this one evil entity that's just, like, robbing everybody all the time, and nobody's even aware of it, for example, like, just shady stuff.
00:21:23.866 - 00:22:01.034, Speaker A: But, like, if people have access, like, fair auctions that they can, like, tip validators such that both they benefit and the validator benefits, and then everybody's aware, and then everybody has access, then you've kind of minimized the externalities of it. And I don't know, I think it's just. Maybe it's like, a weird example of uv rays from the sun or something. It's like, that's going to just be there. You can be prepared for it and take steps to benefit from it. Maybe even tan a little bit. But you can't just say, the sun is evil.
00:22:01.034 - 00:22:04.902, Speaker A: I just kind of made that up.
00:22:04.958 - 00:22:06.006, Speaker B: No, I kind of like it.
00:22:06.030 - 00:22:59.784, Speaker A: I kind of like it. And then about multicoin framework, specifically, I do agree that there's a lot of. Probably a tremendous amount of the thesis of, like, an asset's value probably relies on mev, which is actually why I think probably multicoin isn't too bullish on l two s, because, like, the second you start doing that, like, where's Mev going? Right? Like, are the sequencers capturing it? I think, like, didn't somebody launch, like, a bootleg, like, base sequencer or something that was capturing some mev that Jesse wasn't aware of for, like, a few days or something? Like, people do some crazy shit for me. We actually. I should bring this up as well. People already started spinning up private mempools on Solana that are sandwiching users, by the way. I just kind of remember this.
00:22:59.784 - 00:23:50.564, Speaker A: But remember we chatted about how, like, the argument was like, okay, well, now that jito has stopped, others will just come in and spin this up. But then the argument was like, well, it's very difficult on Solana. And then, like, it'll be hard for people to get like half the stake to adopt. It turns out people are actually, they already have figured it out and there's already Mev happening in the form of sandwich attacks, which is relatively recent. And so what I'm trying to portray with that, we can talk about that, by the way, is that MeV is this thing that's just going to be around. And I think the approach that Jito has, which is trying to make it transparent and accessible, is going to be in the best interest of everybody. So that's what I think about it.
00:23:50.704 - 00:24:48.948, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, no, you bring up great points there. There's definitely like good and evil Mev, if you will. I think the multi coin framework is actually pretty good in calling it benign and malicious. Maybe I forgot the other word, but nonetheless, there's definitely benign MeV, right? Like this could be like oracle updates or liquidations or cross decks, arbitrage, things that, like, generally benefit users and are good for the system versus, you know, seeing a transaction in a mempool and sandwiching it, giving the user a worse trade and you profiting, that is extractive. It's definitely a challenge, like separating. How do you promote and capture and return the benign MeV to the correct user? And I'm being vague here, because you could say you could burn it, give it back to all of sole holders, or you could give it to the leader who is distributing that to their stakers, and maybe that's the relevant party here. So there's room for discussion there as well.
00:24:48.948 - 00:25:44.456, Speaker B: But you mentioned one other thing there, which was base, and so what happened there was they actually left an endpoint to their sequencer public so people could see basically the sequencers mempool. Definitely an oopsie. But I think they've since fixed that issue. And then the third piece there was, okay, I didn't know. I've heard chatter of these new mempools cropping up, but I don't know anything about them. Do we know what the names of these businesses are? Because I want to go track this and figure out how much stake they have in this, but I haven't had the time to dig in. I'm curious, do you know any about the frequency of which these validators are opting in? Because you're right, there's a massive monetary incentive to participate in sandwiching users if, like, that's what you're okay with doing.
00:25:44.456 - 00:25:58.484, Speaker B: The money is there and the money brings in people. There's no doubt about it. It does inspire people to do crazy shit, and that is not unique. To blockchains. That is a global, real world phenomenon. So I'm curious, do you know how much stake these guys have?
00:26:00.144 - 00:26:41.610, Speaker A: I think I don't know the percent of stake they have. I do know that there is sibyls within a delegation program that are, that need to be kind of squashed out that are doing this. I believe it's like two or three providers even that are doing it, based on what I read on Twitter and some chats. But I don't know anything beyond that. It is pretty difficult to. You can detect it on Shane. You can see it.
00:26:41.610 - 00:27:22.416, Speaker A: There's a guy named Shane who posts about it where you can see just users getting wrecked. And then Jupiter actually added kind of an MEV protected way of swapping on Jupiter. I don't know if you caught that in the past week. So most trades happen there through anyway. So that should help users. But, yeah, I would say details are a bit sparse on this because it's pretty evolving and it does take advantage of, like, some things that are kind of broken on Solana that are being fixed. And so it's just like a very moving target.
00:27:22.600 - 00:27:58.332, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I remember we did a pod right after judo shut off the mempool. And I think my, like, you know, knee jerk reaction was, this is probably not a good move because it's going to, you know, the incentive is so large. Um, I think, you know, fast forwarding. I definitely see the, the team's perspective and it probably was the right move to turn it off. But I think they need to be cognizant of, like, if these things do these all, you know, alt mempools, if you will, start, like, do getting a meaningful portion of stake. I mean, it's almost like this necessary evil that, like, the judo guys are actually trying to solve for Mev on Solana.
00:27:58.332 - 00:28:31.724, Speaker B: There is no doubt in my mind about that. They want all of the good things for the base layer. There's even a SImd, SiMd 0109 that I think was Buffalo posted to the Solana Foundation GitHub. And it's basically to add a tipping mechanism to send sold directly to the leader. So, like, they're trying to make this as accessible as possible. And it's like, yeah, like I said, I kind of disagreed with the decision at first, but I definitely learned my lesson to not fade these guys. Like, they're actually trying to make this a better place, specifically Solana as it pertains to Mev.
00:28:31.724 - 00:29:20.108, Speaker B: And so, I don't know, man, it's a tough problem, but I guess this kind of parlays into fire dancer. We ended the Anatolia and Lucas chat on what does fire dancer mean for the chain. Helios just put out a nice post on the explanation of fire dancer titled what is Fire Dancer? And it's a deep dive, so I will link that in the show notes as well. But how does fire dancer tie into the MeV side of this? Actually, Mike Bolido and the other co founder of blockworks, him and I were chatting earlier today, and, uh, he brought it up. It was just like, okay, so, you know, the a team from jump is building fire dancer. Jump is also has a HFT trading firm. And does it give this HFT arm, like, a competitive advantage when it comes to Mev? Because they, like that code base is extremely complicated.
00:29:20.108 - 00:29:41.604, Speaker B: And yes, it's open source, but it's going to take time for other people to get up to speed with exactly how this code base works. And I actually, this was right before I hopped on the pod, so I don't have a good take on this yet. But I'm curious, does fire dancer being built by the jump team give those minds any edge over maybe other people competing in this landscape of Mev?
00:29:45.424 - 00:30:24.400, Speaker A: Well, the way it works currently is that they do chat with, like, Anza and Jito quite frequently, I believe. I mean, especially Anza. And so, like, people are aware of what's being worked on and how it works continuously, especially within Solana core. And so I like, I think in that sense, like, Anza obviously has somewhat of a incentive to detect if something like that were to happen. Same with Jito, obviously. And so it based on how nobody has a text of that. And, like, I mean, I don't know.
00:30:24.400 - 00:31:01.334, Speaker A: I do know a good amount of the people working on it, and I know that they're like, like, half of them weren't even at jump before this project. Like, Richard wasn't at jump, Liam wasn't that jump. And they kind of just joined for this project, I believe. I mean, I don't know if they're incentive, but, like, they're not. Like, so I don't. Some professor from Columbia actually commented on my post, too, about, like, hey, like, isn't it kind of weird that jump is doing this? And like, you know, Jeff is a colossal entity and this is one small, tiny technical team. They are getting a grant for it, so they already have an incentive from that.
00:31:01.334 - 00:31:26.708, Speaker A: And it is open source, most importantly. And they do share all updates, so anybody can take a look. And judging by how people have already brought back mempools. Like they're for sure looking at, at least some set of people are looking at the code here. Right. And so, and you know, by the way, it's gonna be like testnet for a while. It's still like a while out.
00:31:26.708 - 00:32:08.116, Speaker A: Like people always ask like when. And it's probably like end of this year to beginning of next year at the very best, assuming nothing goes wrong. But you know it's, it is an interesting consideration but I don't, I think it's like super overblown. Like it's just code. Like you can just see it. Well like people, anybody who knows c for example will have an advantage, let's say, okay, because it's in c, maybe they'll be able to understand it better. But then again that's just like, that's not like a, I feel like crypto has this thing of like just framing everything as malicious and non malicious or something, which is probably a good thing to have in such an environment where a lot of things often are.
00:32:08.116 - 00:32:13.744, Speaker A: But like in this case, you know, maybe it's reading a bit much into it in my view.
00:32:15.204 - 00:32:30.260, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, that's a fair point. And to be extremely clear I'm like not implying any insidious behavior or anything. It was just like a. Huh. You know, like does the builder of the, or the creator I should say of the, of the client like have any edge? And I don't really have a good answer to that.
00:32:30.292 - 00:33:04.878, Speaker A: But I mean they definitely have an edge. But like the edge is kind of like I don't know. I know for a fact that jump has extremely strict legal and regulatory compliance. Like they can't even really sweet things. So like if they were doing mev, right that would be like I just don't think they would take that risk. Like I just highly doubt it. That's kind of my, which actually now that I think about it and that's a pretty fair point because like if they're too scared to even tweet they are not going to be doing malicious enemy beyond the chain.
00:33:04.878 - 00:33:07.874, Speaker A: Like they will absolutely not take that risk.
00:33:08.254 - 00:33:25.214, Speaker B: Okay. That's probably a good point, is you also brought up the Anzac client there and what is the end state for the Anza client considering fire dancer will be significantly more performance right out of the gate. Like are they trying to be. Yeah, I guess. Let's leave it there. Like what is the end state of the Anzacliant?
00:33:26.114 - 00:34:10.582, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean one, I'm not sure if the fire answer client will be much more performant out of the gate. I believe there will probably be some hiccups and iterations that still need to be made after that, I just. I haven't seen many engineering releases go flawlessly in my life, if ever. So that'll probably be an issue. And I think what will happen is Anza will learn from fire dancer and take the best parts of their sack and try to improve their sack as much. And then maybe you kind of start having, like, kind of a competition. I would say maybe that because, like, salon doesn't believe in, like, the.
00:34:10.582 - 00:34:44.861, Speaker A: Or at least from what I've seen, I don't. It doesn't seem like this community believes in kind of the DEI approach of client diversity of, like, everybody must get their fair share. I think it should be. Personally speaking, I think it should be just the best solution is the best client that people run. And then if you're concerned about liveness failures, we add some fallback mechanism. Right? And the top two valid. The top, you know, 33% of validators, most likely, if there's sufficient activity on the chain, are in a financial position to be able to do that to begin with.
00:34:44.861 - 00:35:17.508, Speaker A: Right. That's my take on it. Obviously, Amsa is a company. They have their own incentives and goals that might change that. I'm just not familiar with that. Trent will smack me in the face with if I get wrong, but I, like, if I were them, I would probably just try to take what's best from fire dancer and then kind of do this kind of friendly competition between the clients such that the performance is always kind of at the bleeding edge, and people are just pushing themselves to make this the best kind of global state machine there is.
00:35:17.636 - 00:35:36.760, Speaker B: My friends. Big, big news. Blockworks is hosting permissionless three in Salt Lake City this year. So we're heading west for three days starting October 9. Permissionless is our industry's premier defi event that brings together crypto natives from all over the globe. I've personally been the last two years and can honestly say that the attendees are incredibly. It's people who actually care about crypto.
00:35:36.760 - 00:36:13.674, Speaker B: We also have more than 200 industry titans speaking at the event, and this includes builders like Lucas Bruder from Judo Labs and Brian Pellegrino from Layer Zero, or investors like Kyle Simone and Joe McCann, and even elected officials like representative Tom Emmer, who is fighting the good fight in Washington. And it's narrative season, so we're going to be covering the seven hottest themes in crypto. This includes things like modularity and restaking or bitcoin and l two s and even AI and crypto. The goal is to keep you up to speed on major developments in the industry. Ticket prices will be structurally increasing over time, so get your ticket today from my lightspeed family. I got you. We're going to use code lightspeed ten in all caps.
00:36:13.674 - 00:36:40.328, Speaker B: No space for 10% off your ticket. All right, everyone, I look forward to seeing you at permissionless three, and let's get back to the show. Competition indeed breeds excellence. So I do enjoy that, that approach there. Yeah, I know it'll be interesting and I kind of agree. Like, the Ethereum's approach, I guess, makes sense given it's like there's two different views. Solana is definitely a go fast and break things chain.
00:36:40.328 - 00:37:06.844, Speaker B: It goes down. The last outage, it had, token price barely budged. Nobody cares because that's a precedent of, hey, we're trying to build this thing to be as fast as it physically possibly can be. It's gonna go down sometimes. That's kind of like the general overview of how maybe the average market participant would view it. Whereas Ethereum going down would be catastrophic. People would, mines would break, basically.
00:37:06.844 - 00:37:53.252, Speaker B: I like your approach of maybe we just try to max out one of these things and then have a fallback option for something that's reliable. Seems to be a logical second way to approach the concept of a blockchain client. Even paradigm is building rest or they're rebuilding the go ethereum client and rust. And it is, by all intents and purposes, seems to be a significant performance boost over the existing client. Clients, plural. And I think that's really going to empower l two s more than anything else, because my very novice understanding of ref is that there will be an increased hardware requirements to run it, and thus it's better suited for l two s probably than the base layer. So it'd be super interesting to see how this pans out.
00:37:53.252 - 00:37:55.384, Speaker B: I don't know if you have any thoughts or looked into that at all.
00:37:57.064 - 00:38:35.806, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I'd be interested to see what happens if paradigm releases a client that's like x amount more performant than any existing client, especially like random shit like enterprise Java clients, which I don't like. Why is that there? Once that's there, I would be very interested to see what happens to the social layer of the chain and this approach to client diversity. Like, you know, I just. Maybe you can kind of do a thought experiment. Like assume that it'll have the same hardware requirements. Okay. But assume that it increases performance.
00:38:35.806 - 00:39:08.034, Speaker A: Two x. Okay, so, meaning you can get the same amount of people, nodes on the network, but you get better performance. Now, do you still force them to arbitrarily do client diversity? Okay, that's an interesting thought experiment. Ethereum kind of has the inactivity leak stuff, right, which is kind of different than Solana. So there's like some difference that, like, it's not humor fixed to compare these things one to one. But I'd be interested to see that. I do agree that it seems like it'd be more useful for l two s.
00:39:08.034 - 00:39:53.382, Speaker A: And by the way, I think Altoo should be like, just personally speaking, just beefed up to the max. Just jack the shit out of those sequencers and do as much performance as you can. So we can actually give developers like a useful sandbox that they can build applications in, and then you can add your validity proof on top of that. Okay. It's like it's already relatively central or, you know, you're already making quite a bit of assumptions with the security councils and the proofs not working properly, uh, in, or just not there in the first place. So, like, why not just, you know, I, I just don't like this mediocristan approach of like, oh, we're kind of decentralized. We're not really decentralized.
00:39:53.382 - 00:40:15.860, Speaker A: We're kind of performing. Not really performant. It's like, just do the thing. Right? And that's why I like Solana. Although to be, to be honest, I think Solana is now price shifting a bit more conservative. Right? Like, the upgrades seem to be coming at a much slower pace with much more paranoia around it, as opposed to just shipped thing. Right.
00:40:15.860 - 00:40:43.148, Speaker A: Which, you know, probably, I mean, that's just a business decision by Anza for what they think is correct. But I like playing around and just, I think we're just so, like, if your time has of crypto is like, okay, this is going to be around for hundreds of years, whatever. Thousands of years. Okay, this is like not even the first 2nd then in that timeframe. And so why not push it as much as you can? But I don't think everybody is as insane as me.
00:40:43.316 - 00:41:23.892, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I definitely get your viewpoint, but then it's like, if you even rewind, let's say 18 months ago, you could very much do that. Yes, there's absolutely people building on chain 18 months ago, but you're very much in the chewing glass phase, whereas now it's like, all right, there's a lot of real applications that people are interacting with and end users on chain, and breaking now hurts a little bit more than breaking 18 months ago, I think. So I do get it. But to your point, there's two ends of the spectrum. There's maximizing for decentralization and maximizing for performance. And maybe ethereum is very much maximized for decentralization. That's a design decision trade off.
00:41:23.892 - 00:41:44.418, Speaker B: That is very much so. A trade off. There's pros and cons to that. And then Solana Aptos, we are probably further out on the other opposite end of this spectrum, um, where you kind of want to, like get decentralization over time. But for now, it's like, let's, let's max this puppy out. Totally agree with you on the l two s. Um, and I always have, like, wondered why this is, but I think it's really a product of the evM.
00:41:44.418 - 00:42:20.534, Speaker B: Right? Cause easily, even if you just like juice the, uh, the gas limit on each block in an l two, and, like, you still have the problem of state growth and state management, which isn't really solved for the EVM, which I think Reth takes a good stab at doing. And then Monad is building out a whole custom stack to optimize this piece of the EVM as well. And so it's like you can't really maximize them today. I think Reth really is the answer. And then you're also seeing SVM l two s come online, and that's where it's going to get super interesting. Like clips is one that comes to mind. Like disclosure here.
00:42:20.534 - 00:42:56.014, Speaker B: I did take part in an early round in eclipse, but I called them the megatron of blockchains. Right? Like they're using the latest and greatest for DA, the latest and greatest for execution environment. And they're also like pulling from ethereum liquidity. So I guess can be really, really interesting to see what that thing can do. Or some of these even like these move roll ups. We just had rushi on the pod from movement labs, and they're like bringing moved roll ups to Ethereum, which is, which would be cool too, because I think that's where you're gonna get that next wave of performance. When it comes to l two s.
00:42:56.014 - 00:43:03.610, Speaker B: I don't really know the timeline on Ret. I'd love to chat with somebody from paradigm about that and when that'll be ready for l two main nets.
00:43:03.762 - 00:43:31.670, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that makes sense. Alt vms, certainly the guest vm roll ups make a lot of sense. Move vms. I guess I need to get more familiar with it, but that makes sense. High level. I think there's a team called, a team I invested in called Mega Eth. That is really about beefing up the hardware and just making the trade offs very clear, and this is what we're going to do.
00:43:31.670 - 00:43:33.394, Speaker A: So I like that approach a lot.
00:43:33.854 - 00:43:36.274, Speaker B: Dumb name, mega eth. Come on.
00:43:37.094 - 00:43:49.454, Speaker A: Yeah, I think they had hats that were in the style of megadeth, like the metal band. Yeah, I forget there's a story behind that name, but we can have them on the show at some point to talk about it.
00:43:50.234 - 00:44:42.784, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. And going back to that earlier point of people building on Solana, and you kind of got to be cognizant of the ship increasing and having to steer this thing through the open ocean. Camino and Drift have recently launched their airdrops and the announcement of their token. So we're finally starting to see some of these blue chip Solana projects become liquid, which begs the question is, like, what's going to happen? With a bit of a wealth effect taking place in the Solana ecosystem? Jito really kicked this off, dropped everybody a new Toyota Corolla or nicer. And Camino and Drift again recently joined the crew there. You've been very loud about wanting people to drop their tokens, so I'm curious if you're excited to finally see some of these top end projects really get there. Drift is the go to perp Dex on Solana, and honestly, I think Camino is the largest non LST provider by TVL these days.
00:44:43.924 - 00:45:31.094, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I tweet about kind of the team slash tokens a few months ago, just trying to maybe get some steam off Jito's momentum. It probably. It's hard to say this is a good time, bad time, whatever, because if your time horizon is, you know, vast enough, it shouldn't really matter. But, yeah, overall, I'm pretty excited about teams releasing their tokens. Camino and Drift are both great teams, and there'll be more, like, Zeta also announced a while back as well. And then there's also a lot of LST is being launched on Solana now as well. So there's a lot of, like, I really like it because you're giving.
00:45:31.094 - 00:46:22.980, Speaker A: Well, in the case of Camino and Drift, those are protocols that people use, so they have good user bases. I use drift quite a bit, or I used to before I lost all my money, so it's really good to see. And then now, of course, the market kind of tanked yesterday. This is May 1, and so I feel for the community team there, but I think they've been around since the bottom of Solana. So this will kind of just be like a little papercut for them. They'll just come back. I would like to see people in the future probably stay away from this meta of points and, you know, incentivizing usage.
00:46:22.980 - 00:47:11.750, Speaker A: But then like not really making anything clear in terms of criteria. Like actually maybe a good point here is the Eigen layer drop that happened this week. Yep, I thought that was, you know, people seem to have very strong opinions about it. Like for example, specifically the case where people from every geo were able to participate in farm and whatnot and help the protocol, but then those who are in those same regions aren't actually able to claim the drops. So yeah, people get very spicy once there's free tokens and whatnot involved. My biggest problem with it was that it was just super fucking complicated. You do not need that many words to describe what you're doing.
00:47:11.750 - 00:47:43.354, Speaker A: One of the things I really am passionate about, let's say, is founders of the projects doing direct, simple communication with their audiences, saying like, hey, this is the token, this is what it does. Here you go, that's it. Like a 44 page paper. Fine, great. But like pre coordinating with your investors, which obviously they did from the amount of threads that I saw, which were very well thought out. Plus like these media appearances. And that's all fine and good, but I still don't quite understand what the token does.
00:47:43.354 - 00:48:18.904, Speaker A: Right, like kind of do, but like, I just, I don't know, there's just a lot of things that we need to rethink about the meta of like announce airdrop or points program farm users and users farm you. This is like everybody's farming each other. Use some of that to raise, do a raise, set weird conditions. Not everybody can claim everybody's angry. It just doesn't seem very, it's only worked in certain cases. It seems like it's not like a recipe for success. So I'm not sure why people follow as a recipe.
00:48:19.444 - 00:48:58.224, Speaker B: 100% true. The inner subjective work token of Eigen universal. Exactly. I agree, I agree with your high level of thoughts there. I think it comes under a lack of communication, which we see pretty consistently in this industry, unfortunately. Um, like, yeah, you should have told, you know, regions that aren't going to be eligible up front, they may have, may or may not have known that, um, to be honest. But like then there's probably some like weird legal aspect where maybe the labs entity is running the front end and the foundation is responsible for the token drop.
00:48:58.224 - 00:49:20.518, Speaker B: And um, you know, that could cause some issues there. Um, I don't know. I definitely, again, I sympathize for anybody in the US trying to launch a token. It is not easy to do. But there's also rumors. Again, these are rumors. I have no idea if these are true, that the token vesting got backdated and tokens have already been vesting.
00:49:20.518 - 00:49:29.594, Speaker B: I want to, again, caveat that with I have no idea if that's true. That rumor was really circulating hard when this whole news came out.
00:49:30.214 - 00:49:32.886, Speaker A: Isn't the vesting period also unknown or something?
00:49:33.030 - 00:50:01.164, Speaker B: No, but it's one year cliff, two year lock. That's worse than industry standards. So to me, it's one of those situations where there's three or four red flags. And if you had one of those, like, okay, fine, and everybody has a red flag, all right, but you have three or four. So there needs to be, like, a deeper level of analysis here. And because, like, to me, they tried to do something kind of interesting with the token launch. So low float, low float, high FTV tokens are a serious problem.
00:50:01.164 - 00:50:36.168, Speaker B: You basically get an FTV that you can never live up to. And when there's unlocks that happen, or whether it's programmatic issuance, your token has to go down. Because it can never be this perceived value of the FDV, and people who buy at the top get wrecked and will never recover. It can look at a lot of token charts and see the evidence of this. I think they actually took a pretty interesting approach at attempting to solve that. They basically said, all right, we're going to do 5% of the airdrop upfront, and that's going to be locked. So it's basically like a vested airdrop.
00:50:36.168 - 00:51:21.388, Speaker B: And then my presumption, I don't know how accurate this is, but my presumption is they'll basically do like three seasons where you get 5%, 5%, 5%, and on the third season, all of the airdrop will unlock. So that way you get this, like, extended rewards program. You're not just like, shooting your shot all at once with a full 15% airdrop. This is better for the protocol by kind of extending this rewards program out. Then you also don't get, if I can launch today and the token was liquid, it'd be 5% circulating. That is bound to be a classic high FTV token with a low float that can never live up to this FTV, and users will get screwed. I think they took a candid approach to trying to fix this, assuming that that was the plan.
00:51:21.388 - 00:51:57.806, Speaker B: If they were actually going to do 555. Get the 50%, unlock these tokens. Now, when you pair that system with a team and investor schedule, that's shortened at a two year vest, one year cliff. And it's like, ah, is that really what you're trying to do? You're kind of again pairing up these red flags together and then the lack of communication on who's eligible as another, like, it got. It's found out of control really quickly, to be honest. And I think it's really easy to point the gun at somebody launching a token. And then this is the last piece here, I think is like, you're making a trade when you're farming.
00:51:57.806 - 00:52:18.680, Speaker B: And I don't think that gets fully understood. Right? Like, if I'm depositing into Eigen lair, I am making a trade that they are going to reward me. And they might not, and I can be upset about that, but it's not like, criminal. It's definitely morally corrupt. I think if you just, like, ran a points program and then didn't reward users. Yeah. Like, you're literally now you're returning the farming.
00:52:18.680 - 00:52:33.160, Speaker B: But the reality is the users are farming the protocol. They're going to take this free money and sell it and profit. Right? Like, that's what's happening. It is very much a trade. And, like, people will say, oh, yeah, but the cost of capital, blah, blah, blah. Like, it's not free. I'm putting my money in there.
00:52:33.160 - 00:52:51.260, Speaker B: Yes, you absolutely are. But you're not thinking about the fact that your cost of capital includes doing the exact same thing in another smart contract that has probably got worse audits than what Eigen layer got. Um, so I don't know. Like, I. I really struggle to sympathize with. With farmers on this. And I'm sure I'll get clipped and dunked on for that.
00:52:51.260 - 00:53:08.824, Speaker B: But I tend to want to take the side of the protocol because just put yourself in the shoes of being a us resident and launching a token like, it's a fucking shit show. It is not easy to do. Uh, but again, like, I just want to exclamate, like, put a point on. Um. There's a lot of red flags here and a lot of questions that are unanswered.
00:53:09.584 - 00:53:48.922, Speaker A: Yeah, I think. I mean, I don't think there's, like, probably any single person to blame for any of this is probably just like a momentum and inertia thing. I don't think users are in the wrong. And then, you know, I don't think. I personally think protocols are generally more in the wrong because, you know, very simply, they kind of just fail to build something people want. That's kind of, I just super simple minded there. Like, left curve probably could blame the VC's to some extent as well, or really just regulatory environment is another problem.
00:53:48.922 - 00:54:48.328, Speaker A: But, like, and I've switched a few times now, but, like, this meta of, you know, paying people or promising to pay people so that they pretend to use your shit so that you then grow or you have inflated metrics which you then raise off of is just this weird version of leverage that mixes financial and social capital. And it's just so bizarre. And all of it would go away if actually the thing that you were building was solving a problem that actually benefits somebody such that they were just using the thing. That's the point. Like, and I may I say this example a few times, but, like, I was using Jito's protocol to earn Mev revenue because I wanted to do that. I did not know there was gonna be an airdrop. And then I was like, oh, shit, they gave me money for this and I still use it.
00:54:48.328 - 00:55:14.754, Speaker A: Okay. And I'm now interested in the governance proposals, for example. Like, that feels like a well flushed out one. Anyway, that actually reminds me of another thing that I saw today. I saw an article by coindesk of potentially multiple teams doing restaking on Solana. I think he said something like half a dozen. So, like, six teams doing it, including Jito.
00:55:14.754 - 00:56:19.914, Speaker A: And that prompted my tweet today, which was something like, there's this bizarre loop where something gets buzz on one chain and then a set of teams take it and they're like, okay, this, but on this chain, and then they raise it at crazy valuations because the VC's just pattern match without actually thinking for some reason. And they're not, they're not familiar with the intricate details and the differences between the different chains that make these comparisons basically infeasible. Like, reeking on Solana is not re staking on ethereum, okay? It's not. And for a team that does not work on Solana, has not worked on Solana, or has a surface of understanding, to come and do this on Solana is going to be just about impossible. I mean, it's super difficult because you don't understand the problems. You don't understand the fine details that you really can't understand unless you've worked on the core protocol yourself. And, like, what problem are you solving? Right? Like, are you, are you solving for the problem of raising money from VC's? Because there's nobody.
00:56:19.914 - 00:57:04.274, Speaker A: Like, what was the problem solving? And then the elephant in the room then is you're competing against judo, who actually is trying to solve problems, who has been here and understands is better than you. So this skeuomorphic copy, this product on this chain is something that's known me for a long time, which is why I just came up with only possible on Solana to encourage people. Okay, just build shit that's only possible on Solana. You have like an inherent moat by the platform that you're building on, right? Like if you're building on AWS, you don't have a moat against Google cloud. Your company does not. But in the terms of, in terms of blockchains, that's actually not the case. The platform you build on can literally give your business a boat over other chains sometimes.
00:57:04.274 - 00:57:11.222, Speaker A: And there's a finite amount of time you have to take advantage of that. So anyway, ranch over.
00:57:11.398 - 00:57:42.104, Speaker B: No, that's a proper rant. And honestly, like, my issue with the rest, taking stuff in general, is like, what is this enabling? What are we building that we couldn't build before? Let's look at the, I think it's like the first six or seven avss that have been approved to launch on eigen layer. So we have data availability. Oracle service consensus layer for deep Insk coprocessor. ZK coprocessor. Again, a roll up solution. Interoperability for rollups.
00:57:42.104 - 00:58:03.184, Speaker B: Web three gaming. Okay, that's interesting. Multiprover and omni chain l three for trading. Like, what the fuck have we accomplished there? You can do all of that already? Like, we already have a DA layers left and right. And I don't know, like that's really what my issue with this is. And so there's like two pieces to restaking. There is the native restaked asset.
00:58:03.184 - 00:58:38.746, Speaker B: So in the case of Eigen layer, that is a solo node operator actually restaking the ETH that it controls itself. And then there's the idea of like restaked lsts, which is literally just taking any unit of value and allocating it to provide some service. USDC would function the exact same as lidostaked ETH, so there's like two buckets there. The native restaked asset stuff is way more interesting and actually could probably add some benefit to the Ethereum base layer. For example, we mentioned base roll ups earlier. That is when you use the l one as a sequencer. A huge problem with that is you cannot give pre confirmations.
00:58:38.746 - 00:59:04.784, Speaker B: So users on the l two, that is a base sequencer, are subject to the block times of the l one, which, for the case of Ethereum is 12 seconds. And that's kind of a no fly zone at this point. Too many chains that offer too fast of confirmation times. A restake solution is a potential option to solving that problem. Very cool. Now we're actually bettering something. But again, I think you could argue that that should just be a native offering of the l one and doesn't need restake solution.
00:59:04.784 - 00:59:38.814, Speaker B: So there's some native Solana restaking stuff that could be pretty interesting. But again, that's a whole new problem set. Um, and I think, like, building that on Solana being incredibly complex, I'd love to have Lucas on the. On the pod or whoever's leading the restaking charge for Gito, uh, just to dive into that specific side, because there is probably something there. But the whole, like, idea of I'm restaking lsts, like, that is really stupid in my mind. And, like, I mean that in the nicest way possible. It just does not seem to be productive, and that seems to be, like, really pushing forward the infrastructure.
00:59:38.814 - 00:59:52.624, Speaker B: Circle jerk of all the shit we're building. You rant about this all the time. Like, we need apps, man. We need apps. Give me something people can use. And I just don't see restaking as being that thing that's going to enable new apps in my mind.
00:59:53.164 - 01:00:44.876, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think it certainly won't enable. I mean, I don't want to say certainly. It doesn't seem like it would enable the new apps, especially not ones that. I mean, because, like, I don't know, I feel like people just. This decentralization thing always gets misdefined and politicized and stuff. But it's like, decentralization is good, but decentralization for its own sake, which generally seems to be what's happening here, is useless, because what are you decentralizing? You need to first have something worth decentralizing. Otherwise, why are you making something that's already not working even less workable? On Solana, it's a bit different, because you can actually use the stuff on Solana itself, whereas on Ethereum, they're kind of just offloading this to other things that kind of connect to Ethereum.
01:00:44.876 - 01:01:09.992, Speaker A: But on Solana, it's just all doable on the all one. And so you can maybe get, like, a weird effect. And I think Cheeto has stakenet, which one of the things it enables is this. That could be interesting. But again, I just. I actually really preferred the. And this is, I think where the next wave will come from.
01:01:09.992 - 01:01:51.894, Speaker A: The social fi side of crypto. Like, people talk shit about frontec quite a bit when it came out, but, like, look, man, it's fun, it's interesting. People want to use it. Okay? You can probably leverage that in some less different bonding curves, let's say. But, like, it's, it's, it has users, okay, Farcaster has users. Like, I think social apps personally are going to be what's more important going forward. And, like, Forecaster doesn't even really need to use a blockchain, right? Like, they, they kind of just use, like, optimism, I think, for, like, a registry of, like, identities and stuff, it seems, and not too much else.
01:01:51.894 - 01:02:25.032, Speaker A: And so, I don't know, I would just, if there's anything to take away from my rant, I would say to anybody who's ever interested in building anything, please just look at an ecosystem, identify the gaps, be curious about them, and then build something to solve those problems. But try to stay away from following a trend and then launching another chain just to benefit from the trend and raise a few bucks, because, like, it's going to come down at some point unless you solve a problem as a.
01:02:25.048 - 01:02:36.864, Speaker B: Bag holder of your friend tech keys, man, get it together. We need, we need your posting, dude. Smart. It's been a pleasure ranting with you today, my man. I appreciate it, as always. And we will be back next week with another roundup. Cheers.
