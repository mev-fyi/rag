00:00:00.080 - 00:00:15.912, Speaker A: Ethereum is the the kind of giant in the room. But thinking pragmatically, like, if in fact it does take until 2029 to release this new version of Ethereum, I don't know if Ethereum can really compete.
00:00:16.056 - 00:00:35.320, Speaker B: Yeah, I would agree. I think the final point there is you have competition now. It's not 2018. And your competition isn't just Solana either. There's a lot of other chains coming and Solana has competition too. So it's a heated market and you need to accelerate to win.

Hello and welcome back to another episode of Lightspeed. I'm one of your hosts, Jack Kubenek, joined today by my co host Mert Mumtaz for a roundup. Mert, how have things been?
00:01:45.370 - 00:02:02.440, Speaker B: Not great, Jack. Basically a prisoner in the Canadian banking system. Cannot move my money out, can't wire. They basically told me to fly back from Dubai to Canada to do a simple transfer, so not great.
00:02:03.300 - 00:02:09.500, Speaker A: But the bags, however, the bags are up quite a bit this week, so there's always a silver lining.
00:02:09.580 - 00:02:23.950, Speaker B: I'm pretty radicalized by this. I'm going to do whatever it takes to make sure I don't have to fly back and actually solve this problem with some creative endeavor.
00:02:24.530 - 00:02:39.910, Speaker A: Yeah, it's been, it's been watching, you know, your I, I, I, I feel like I've had a bit of a front row seat to the radicalization on this podcast over the the past few months and it sounds like you're, you're kind of going for the the crypto hub in Dubai these days.
00:02:40.930 - 00:03:34.514, Speaker B: Yes, certainly, I think, well, first of all, anywhere outside of Canada is going to be a great place. But people always ask what is kind of the purpose of crypto and what problems does it solve, et cetera. And here's one obvious example. If I just had root access to my money with some private keys, I can be mobile, I can go anywhere in the world and just be able to use it. Except now I try to take out money and there's like a five thousand dollar Canadian dollar limits which is like five dollars US and it's impossible and it's just, it needs to be solved and we're going to solve it.
00:03:34.682 - 00:03:53.390, Speaker A: All I'm saying Mert, is there's a country that hosts the majority of the world's capital markets with a city that, where a lot of those capital markets are held. A lot of crypto folks in New York. So I'm not, I don't know, I'm just saying that that, that could be on the table, that could be the play as well. I quite enjoy it out here.
00:03:54.330 - 00:04:03.202, Speaker B: I like New York quite a bit. Probably I will come there in the summers of Dubai where it's very hot, just brutal. It'll be my second home.
00:04:03.306 - 00:04:59.880, Speaker A: The place I want to start with you at least mert, is the Ethereum beam chain was just announced by Justin Drake, the Ethereum foundation researcher at devcon. You know we talk a lot about Sol versus Eth on this podcast and I think this is one of the more consequential announcements for Ethereum or at least telling as far as what's on the roadmap. So the TLDR here, the Ethereum beam chain, it's the next evolution past the beacon chain, which is what Ethereum has kind of run on since the merge to proof of stake. It decentralizes builders and relays, which is good. It'll move ethereum down to 4 second block times. I think it's currently like 12 second block times or somewhere in that wheelhouse. It only requires 1 ETH to be a validator, down from 32 ETH currently.
00:04:59.880 - 00:05:32.570, Speaker A: And it has this snark based cryptography to kind of guard against quantum computing and keep the consensus layer secure. I think the biggest part of this whole deal was that it's proposed to launch in 2029, which drew a lot of criticism both in the Ethereum world and outside, saying that that's way too long of a timeline. But I don't know Mert, with the extent that you have looked into beamchain, I don't know how much it's been. But what's kind of your initial takeaway on this proposed next step for Ethereum?
00:05:32.650 - 00:07:05.960, Speaker B: My friend Doug Korket made a tweet the day before the announcement and basically said, you know, here's what's going to happen. And he said one second block times, etc. And I think what caught everyone by surprise was the timeline where basically I believe it's roughly a five to six year project and the outcome seems to be two second, four second block times, I believe and some other stuff around the consensus layer. The fundamentals of the end solution seem reasonable, although probably still a little too slow in my view for not utilizing the available bandwidth that the world's Internet providers already give you. It's. It's just a timeline that everybody is super confused by or at least angry at. And perhaps some of this is multiplied by the fact that the ETH BTC chart has looks like a Christmas tree where it went up quite a bit and then went down basically the exact same amount to make an actual triangle shape, which I haven't seen that shape before.
00:07:05.960 - 00:08:25.314, Speaker B: I don't really look at charts but thought that was crazy. Obviously the usual suspects like Max Resnick and Solana people, but also even I think Ethereum core people and researchers like John Charbonneau were kind of like how can this possibly take five years? I made a tweet which I deleted after and it was something like so basically, if my math is correct, humanity will have reached Mars before Ethereum gets 4 second block times. And I like that analogy because it's a good contrast because the argument for is taking a long time is Ethereum is the most valuable smart contract platform. It has the most tvl, it has the most liquid assets and the most to lose basically from something to go wrong on Mainnet, like an outage or anything like that, like an attack. And so certainly there is a case to be made for yes, Ethereum has to move slower by definition. That's just how it has to be. And then people from Ethereum foundation will market this as something like hardness, where they'll say Ethereum is really hard.
00:08:25.314 - 00:08:44.279, Speaker B: It's hard to change on purpose because it gives you some guarantees about the system and so you can kind of feel safe and that's fair. On the other hand, I don't remember the exact roadmap, but it was something like the first year will be pilling.
00:08:44.779 - 00:08:59.559, Speaker A: I was just about to bring that up. It, it, it isn't, it's only 2024. 2025 is specking but from now until the end of the year is, is all pilling, right. And then two years of building, two years of testing.
00:09:01.099 - 00:09:53.080, Speaker B: Right. And engineering timelines never actually are accurate. And so you would add at least two years to that, in my view. And I think I would be okay with that if the outcome was super ambitious. So like one second block time, single slot finality and very, very kind of big step changes. But if it's things like quantum resistance, cryptography, four second block times, especially when Monad is going to come out with something that's more performant while also not having crazy hardware requirements, as far as I understand. I think it is disappointing personally because yeah, I obviously like Solana much more than Ethereum.
00:09:53.080 - 00:10:40.700, Speaker B: At the same time, I do want crypto to succeed. And so to see an engineering effort take that long is just, I'm sorry, but it's just, that's not how this works. You need a leader who has that dog, who has this fire, who's just gonna go there and say, here's what's gonna happen. Here's the software we wrote the code, we tested it, we're doing all these things, drive consensus, get people to the finish line and ship this thing in two years max. I mean, Fire Dancer is taking two years. It's a total rewrite of a protocol without a spec. So they had to come up with a spec on their own.
00:10:40.700 - 00:11:24.730, Speaker B: And that's on Solana, where there's upgrades to Solana four or five times a year. Right. And obviously Solana has less to lose in terms of, you know, if there's a catastrophic failure or something where there's an outage for eight hours or something. That's still not going to affect Solana as much as it would Ethereum. But I just really, I philosophically disagree with the way that things get done in that ecosystem. It seems to me like a case of Greece versus Romans or scientists versus engineers. You want very driven, passionate engineers to do the driving here.
00:11:24.730 - 00:11:45.150, Speaker B: Researchers obviously are valuable and obviously have a different skill set that, that is necessary. At the same time, somebody needs to ship this code and drive everybody to consensus. And I personally am super disappointed by the lack of ambition.
00:11:46.130 - 00:12:26.790, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a, it's a bit of a head scratcher. I guess. What I wanted to. What's been rolling around in my mind a little bit thinking about this is just, is this a way in which you sort of just give in to the L2 scaling roadmap? All of the big Ethereum apps move to their own L2s this is essentially already happening. You have Unichain ENS just announced a blockchain this week. Because with blobs and things, my understanding is that you kind of can scale Ethereum through L2s. Now that obviously takes away from some of the income that Ethereum, the layer one is able to generate.
00:12:26.790 - 00:12:43.762, Speaker A: But if ETH is money, then maybe you don't care about it having income quite as much. And so through that lens you can a little bit make sense of the long roadmap. But I don't know, there are a.
00:12:43.786 - 00:13:45.796, Speaker B: Few schools of thought on this and roughly you can classify them as maybe John Charbonneau's way and Max Resnick's way, which is that the L1 fundamentally needs to still scale because the reason why you need an L2 or the reason why an L2 makes sense is because all the valuable assets are on the L1. And so you can extend those assets from the L1 and then do some computation off chain, put them back. And then perhaps people who want different security guarantees can still do things on the L1. And so if you just make, let's say 2.3x improvement on the L1, that already puts you ahead by quite a bit, at least compared to where you were. So that's the L2 or scaling the L1 arguments. And also if there's a future with all kind of these ZK layers interoperating, you do want fast finality on the L1 so that the interoperability actually makes sense in cross layer communication, all sorts of things.
00:13:45.796 - 00:14:30.174, Speaker B: So that does need to happen. And then the counter, or not necessarily the counter, but let's say an 89 degree turn away from that is we're not going to do anything to the L2. I mean the L1 we're just going to have all these chains that just settle to Ethereum. And it's important that those chains use eth, the asset as currency for transacting. And one that's a social incentive. There's no real technical reason why you need to use ETH as money. There's for at least in most cases.
00:14:30.174 - 00:15:36.650, Speaker B: So for example, one chain that we should actually probably talk about is that the L3Dgen complained about being held hostage by their role up as a service provider. And what people don't understand about or maybe might not know about that chain is it's an L3 on top of base, but it uses DEGEN as the money token, it doesn't use eth. And so they have no reason to use ETH as money. And so it's. You can kind of alignment your way into using eth, but it's not a super strong guarantee. And so then the people will say, well, it's very important that the hardware requirements and everything are super minimal so that obviously we can be the most decentralized chain. And people don't necessarily specify what they mean by decentralized, but fundamentally why you want better hardware requirements is because you want people to be able to verify but also be able to transact on the chain without permission.
00:15:36.650 - 00:16:16.490, Speaker B: So without meeting this RPC or whatever, you can just spin up your own systems. I think where that falls short is it really underestimates the amount of hardware improvements in the world. I can get a gigabyte worth of Internet very easily. I do have it right now. It's really not much money. And hardware requirements like RAM and state drives and, you know, storage, those are also not that pricey. I mean, kids all over the world pay thousand dollars just to set up gaming rigs.
00:16:16.490 - 00:16:27.730, Speaker B: And so I think there is something to be said for maybe not underestimating how far hardware has come so far.
00:16:30.030 - 00:17:14.880, Speaker A: Yeah. And you know, to be fair, like, some caution is needed when you're, when you're talking about upgrading ethereum, it's a 400, 400 billion market cap asset, I believe, maybe a little under that. It's three times as large, three to four times as large as SOL and market cap. So it's not like you're taking some marginal chain and you're upgrading it and throwing spaghetti at the wall to try to get users to your chain. Ethereum is the kind of giant in the room. But thinking pragmatically, if in fact it does take until 2029 to release this new version of Ethereum, I don't know if Ethereum can really compete. That just seems like too far of a.
00:17:14.880 - 00:17:54.988, Speaker A: With how quickly narratives in crypto move and with a new U.S. presidential administration, that might make institutional participation in crypto more of a thing. It's hard to think that you can just sit on the sidelines effectively until 2029 and not ship something sooner. So all in all, I am, I'm just confused by it. Obviously Ethereum is the incumbent. It's very large as a huge market cap, but it's hard to see how you can keep that momentum. And historically, the ETH roadmap has been a strength that it has that other chains have kind of tried to emulate.
00:17:54.988 - 00:18:19.460, Speaker A: I know Cosmos foundation started releasing a roadmap because it was like, well, the Ethereum roadmap creates all this excitement around the chain. But this. I don't know if this version of that roadmap is going to really work because I think we're in a place where people are going to start to want to start seeing real tangible results and apps and things that people use in their everyday lives.
00:18:20.080 - 00:18:30.552, Speaker B: I would agree. I think the final point there is you have competition now. It's not 2018 and your competition isn't just Solana either.
00:18:30.616 - 00:18:30.772, Speaker A: Competition.
00:18:30.786 - 00:18:39.056, Speaker B: There's a lot of other chains coming and Solana has competition too. So it's a heated market and you need to accelerate to win.
00:18:39.208 - 00:19:38.702, Speaker A: Chaos Labs, the leading on chain risk management firm, recently launched its new flagship Oracle product Edge, which delivers integrated high precision risk and price data for any on chain application with a market. Edge emerged from stealth after two months securing Jupiter, the top swap platform on solana, already securing $30 billion in volume and more than 60% of all Solana perp's volume. Edge is comprised of three price, risk and Proofs. It delivers high precision price data with an integrated risk engine powered by Chaos's advanced outlier and anomaly detection algorithm. It automates delivery of real time parameter adjustments on chain based on current market conditions and it enables the secure on chain delivery of customers data points, including reserve attestations delivered via zkps. Most recently, Wintermute announced its selection of the Edge proofs Oracle for Outcome Market, its new smart contract based election prediction market tool. Thank you to Chaos Labs for making this episode possible.
00:19:38.702 - 00:20:20.178, Speaker A: As anyone doing stuff on Chain knows, security for your crypto is super important. That's the benefit you get from Ledger, which has been around for a decade now and is the most secure hardware wallet for your Solana and logins. Ledger's newest devices Ledger Stacks and Ledger Flex have secure touchscreens making it easier to manage your crypto. And with Ledger Live you can seamlessly and securely manage and stake your Solana alongside Ledger Stacks and Ledger Flex. Ledger introduced the Ledger security key app, a safer alternative to traditional passwords, enhancing your overall digital security. Thank you Ledger for sponsoring this episode. I want to chat a bit about the outage that Jito had yesterday as we're recording this.
00:20:20.178 - 00:21:04.356, Speaker A: So Thurs Wednesday it happened. The Jito you know stopped producing bundles for about an hour and a half amid record high demand for bundles and so some apps like Jupiter were not able to to use Jito, MEV protect and certain features broke. Liveness was not affected so transactions and slots were still processed. But Mert you on I think our last roundup predicted Solana downtime in the near future. And I thought this might be it. When I saw the, the JITO tweet go out, that wasn't what ended up happening. But I think what was kind of interesting was the JITO outage was a bit of a case study in how priority fees work.
00:21:04.356 - 00:21:58.260, Speaker A: So Dan Smith from Blockworks, former Lightspeed host, posted this chart gave that showed the median priority fee. You know, near the bottom of the chart, the G MEV tips a little higher, GEO MEV tips disappear because JITO is down. The median priority fee spikes for a bit and then when go comes back on, the median priority fee goes back down. So essentially the takeaway from this is that JITO MEV tips seem to be lowering the median priority fee, so making it cheaper to functionally get your transaction included in Solana blocks, which is kind of an interesting little real time experiment we got to see yesterday. Mert, I don't know how much you were involved with all the JITO stuff, but what were you seeing sort of on the RPC side of things as this was all going down?
00:22:00.720 - 00:23:28.120, Speaker B: Yeah, so I saw the fee markets fluctuate pretty drastically and I noticed that first actually, because I wasn't on Twitter for once and I was just looking at our dashboards and I was like, holy. Why is the, why are the fees going up so, so much? And the way it works, one of the systems, how it works on Helios is there's obviously two ways of sending transactions on Solana. You either send it directly to the leader or you send it via a staked connection from a validator. And staked connections land much more effectively, land faster, land better. And the way we route this on our system is if you pay the median fee or above, when you're sending a transaction to Inhales rpc, it automatically routes you to stake, so you don't have to do anything else. But what I realized was that people had actually hard coded this fee value and when the fees went up, because the JITO auction was now stopped effectively for 10, 20 minutes, people started using the median went up and as a result, people weren't sending transactions to stake because they weren't using the fee API. So it was a good test to show that the fee markets do work.
00:23:28.120 - 00:24:18.240, Speaker B: They don't work perfectly, but they do work. They kick in. It's actually kind of similar to an L2. So Jito is not an L2 by any means, but it's also not necessarily part of Solana Core. And so it's basically a Separate auction that you can put your transactions through where you are competing for the top of the block, which is important for arbitrage folks, people sniping shit coins, etc. And so that's a very competitive market, but it's a very limited market. And so what happens when that goes away is now they need to compete during or through the regular Salana fee markets, which obviously makes the fees go up.
00:24:18.240 - 00:25:00.580, Speaker B: So I thought that was pretty, pretty interesting. Obviously the JITO block engine is a centralized service for the time being. I'm not sure if they have plans to decentralize that, but it is, it is a good way. I think the good way to think about it is something like let's say your L2 stopped, the sequencer stopped, but you were already on E to begin with and you can still submit on Ethereum and that. And, and to, to be fair, JITO fixed the issue in like 10 minutes. That was super fast. It was sub superhuman.
00:25:00.580 - 00:26:00.634, Speaker B: So, and that was at I believe, I don't know how many bundles exactly, but millions. And that's a very hard engineering problem. So I guess my TLDR here is that Solana Network wasn't affected except for fees going up. And that's to be expected obviously. And it's the thing that I'm perhaps should draw a yellow flag to is how certain products or certain parts of certain products stop working. So for example, MEV protect on something like Jupiter because you need the bundles to land MEV trades in the first place. So if JITO is not functioning then you're already default protected by MEV or from mev.
00:26:00.634 - 00:26:21.170, Speaker B: And so there's a lot of weird kind of rough edges in the pipeline of ecosystem teams, apps, core, jita, all this stuff and stress tests like this help us kind of smooth those out so that the system becomes more resilient the next time around.
00:26:21.870 - 00:27:19.570, Speaker A: Yeah, it didn't seem like too many things broke. I mean Jupyter had some issues save which used to be Soland had some problems. But yeah, totally, totally had a tweet after the downtime where he was basically saying JITO has. I think what he was saying was JITO has slightly a higher latency which makes it the, the JITO bundles have slightly higher latency which make them more stable. And there's a certain class of transaction senders who are willing to accept this higher latency because they want the stability and they also will pay MEV tips to validators. And so what this does is it artificially lowers the median fee for everyone else and makes the blockchain cheaper to access. And you sort of saw this in real time because the median fee spiked, which I just thought was an interesting little caveat.
00:27:21.350 - 00:27:59.304, Speaker B: I'm not sure if that's entirely accurate. I need to look up on this. But if you use Jito transact the JITO clients, there's something called the relay that the validators run or JITO runs and the transactions get delayed by 200 milliseconds and so. But the bundles don't. From what I understand, I could be wrong on that. It's a very complex system and I think this is where we need more Solana specific research.
00:27:59.472 - 00:28:07.960, Speaker A: Do you think it's an issue that 90% of Solana stake uses the Jito Solana client? Like that.
00:28:08.000 - 00:28:46.156, Speaker B: That was 90% of stake. I think Ryan from Bankless said something like 90% of the stake is run by Jito or something, which that's the wrong framing. It's more like 90% of the stake uses the same client. And this is the same thing where obviously before Jito existed, 100% of the stake ran Onsa's client or Solana Labs client. And then now it's split between JITO and somewhat Anza. And then obviously there'll be Fire Dancer, there'll be Frankendancer, and we'll see what the adoption on those will be do. I think it's a problem.
00:28:46.156 - 00:29:38.150, Speaker B: Anytime there's a market with no competition, that market will become inefficient over time. And so ideally there's some competition at that layer, so that new things are being created for the consumers, whether that's the validators or the transaction centers or the searchers. And I think I'm starting to see that happen more. That being said, JITO is a good team that's competent and clearly has good intentions. And so they also deserve the success they've had. But I'm not sure I would be very surprised if competition doesn't arise as Solana gets bigger and the economic value to be, let's say, captured in some percentage keeps increasing.
00:29:39.210 - 00:30:05.668, Speaker A: And it makes sense why so many validators run Jito Solana like Jito MEV tips now drive more. Like this week, I believe there's more daily Jito Solana MEV tips than there are priority fees paid on the network. So it's just incredibly lucrative for a validator. I don't really see why you wouldn't run Jito Solana with how the network is operating right now amid all the trading and craziness.
00:30:05.764 - 00:30:36.110, Speaker B: But yeah, by the way, if you are listening to this and you stake with a validator that runs jito, which is probably most of you, what you might not know is that if you did a native stake so you didn't find LST, you can go to jito.network harvest and connect your staking account and then you'll see your MEV rewards there and you can claim them. I tweeted that the other day and people had thousands, tens hundreds of thousands in those rewards. So go check.
00:30:36.190 - 00:31:09.484, Speaker A: Speaking of rewards and money, I don't know, this isn't a good segue. Bitcoin hit an all time high this week. It crossed 90k on euphoria related to the Trump electoral victory in the US. Solana hit a three year high, it crossed $220. And one thing I tweeted last night that was stuck out to me is you, you get this, you know, research note from Bernstein that says welcome to the crypto bull market. Don't fight it. Buy everything you can.
00:31:09.484 - 00:31:30.828, Speaker A: Which from investment analysts you rarely see that sort of, you know, buy everything you can sentiment. But yeah, I'm, I'm like, mert, I know you're not a big markets guy, but I don't know how silly do you think things are going to get? What's sort of your read on where things are sitting right now?
00:31:30.884 - 00:32:17.830, Speaker B: My strategy is very simple. It's do I think this tech will be around in 10 years? If so, buy in size, keep buying and follow your own convictions. Which is thankfully why I was able to be pretty well off from Solana during $8. But currently all I do is I buy 8 Soul. And that's also somewhat of a productive yield because you get up like we just mentioned MEB yields, which is productive yield from things actually happening. I think people have all sorts of price targets from what I've gathered. I think Michael Saylor went on CNBC and said something like bitcoin can be like 1.3
00:32:17.830 - 00:33:03.280, Speaker B: million or something. Pretty crazy numbers. And people have price targets for SOUL and eth. And I'm just, that's not how I do the thing. I think certainly you can play these games where you have your group chat and you're looking for the next coin. And I believe I saw Thread Guy, who is actually a friend, go on Twitch as a live stream and said something like, quit your job, focus just on the trenches. You can change your life, you can make all the money in the world, et cetera.
00:33:03.280 - 00:33:21.826, Speaker B: So there's kind of that school of thinking. Plus the MEME coin traders like Murad and all these folks. I think that probably works for some people. That's. And I. I find nothing morally wrong with that either. If people want to play around and permissionless capital markets, go ahead.
00:33:21.826 - 00:33:54.446, Speaker B: That's what crypto is for. So sure. That being said, I just, I find it boring. That's my thing with it. I don't care about making some green charts on my P L because I care about building the things and actually creating things. That's what gives me joy, like being able to create things. I had that experience where I could not transfer money from Canada to the UAE and I don't care about the money there to myself.
00:33:54.446 - 00:34:12.072, Speaker B: I'm thinking, I'll pay whatever the fucking fee is. Just let me do this. I need a solution. The tech needs to exist. The technology does not exist. And so what would give me satisfaction and joy, such that I can actually sleep at night is okay. We built a system where you can actually transfer this money from here to here.
00:34:12.072 - 00:34:28.294, Speaker B: The UX is good and we can keep building these Lego blocks and build this amazing structure and people can do whatever they want on it. But that's what gives me joy. So I don't personally don't care about that. My holdings are very limited. Basically 90% each solution.
00:34:28.372 - 00:34:40.802, Speaker A: So you're telling me you weren't following this? You know bitcoin's price run on Monday where it added 12k or whatever it was. I mean, like, it's. Moments like that are just. I don't know, it's. It's very memorable. I'll at least say the only way.
00:34:40.826 - 00:35:05.722, Speaker B: I find out about those is if I just see it on Twitter. Like, I don't generally go on any charts or anything. The only exception is I like shit posting quite a bit. So if the price goes up, then I'll put in a nice copy pasta and talk about how bubbles are mathematically impossible. It is fun. I do like people having fun and being, you know, hopeful and enjoying the price action. So that's awesome.
00:35:05.722 - 00:35:11.190, Speaker B: It's just not super enjoyable for me. But if people are having fun, let them have fun.
00:35:11.490 - 00:36:35.840, Speaker A: Yeah, I have a couple price thoughts that I'll drop on the people. As far as bitcoin, I think if there is in fact a bitcoin reserve, which Cynthia Lummis and, you know, has kind of spearheaded and Trump has at least signaled support for, who knows how silly things could get. I think that would obviously drive a ton of investment into bitcoin, but I'm still in, wait and see. Mode on that because I think as much as crypto people would love to see that happen, there's a lot of things that a presidential administration has to do and, and who knows whether a bitcoin strategic national reserve, which I don't really know philosophically why that needs to exist or why that's a good thing. It's probably just good for the price action. Who knows if that actually gets built. And so I'm in, in wait and see mode on that I think also I'm interested in seeing if Seoul obviously can, can hit $260 recapture an all time high because I think there is an argument to be made that despite all of the positive price action for Seoul, a lot of it came from the fact that the market overcorrected for FTX supply overhang and was really worried that FTX would dump a bunch of soul onto the market, it would crater the price.
00:36:35.840 - 00:37:25.010, Speaker A: That ended up not being the case. You had kind of large firms buy all of FTX's soul at discounts in these OTC deals and they haven't sold. And so it was all kind of these like fears based on a black swan event that didn't come true. It almost feels like now we're at ground zero. And so can Seoul continue to gain on ETH from here? From Seoul being, you know, within a rock throwing distance of an all time high. So I'll be interested to watch that it, you know, eth has, has not meaningfully pumped it seems like the whole cycle which is I think where a lot of frustration from eth continues to come from. It's where a lot of the beam chain frustration comes from.
00:37:25.010 - 00:38:16.880, Speaker A: But I'll be interested to see if, if soul can continue to gain on eth can can you know, soul come to be worth 1/10 of eth? Does the market cap really significantly narrow the gap as more defi use cases emerge and things like that. So yeah, while price is not the most interesting thing in the world, it is something fun to watch. And yeah, it's been quite a week for all traders in the crypto market. I personally don't do meme coins. It is so bad for your mental health I think because even if like you know, you, you can sell when the price goes up, but then what if it, you know, gets listed on binance and then you miss out on all these gains that, that would just be horrible for me. I'll never do it. But well, if you are, good luck I guess.
00:38:18.180 - 00:39:01.564, Speaker B: Yeah, it's fundamentally a game and if people want to Play games and do it. Games are fun. On this SOL E thing, I've heard this mentioned a few times. You know, will SOL flip eth? That's. I don't really have any comments on that because obviously to make a statement like that, you need to understand ETH as well as you understand SOL to some extent, if you're not relying on getting lucky. I think I understand eth, but perhaps not as well as obviously somebody from Ethereum. And so what I would say about, let's say my thesis for SOL is just as simple as possible.
00:39:01.564 - 00:39:58.230, Speaker B: There's an economy that's on chain within the Solana blockchain, and there are some goods and services provided within that economy, that is block space and markets. And if you want to access those markets, then you pay a fee. And if those markets are inefficient, the MEV searchers will kind of come and arbitrage it away. And on top of that, to store data on Solana, which is another, let's say, scarce resource, you need to pay money. And so you put those things together and then you just look at, okay, does the real yield from activity happening on this chain surpass something like inflation? And that seems very, very likely to me. I think it's come pretty close. And that's without even block rewards being shared with stakers in most cases.
00:39:58.230 - 00:41:16.428, Speaker B: So if you just look at it from a pure stocks framework, let's say it actually is just a good asset to hold, in my view, because even speculation aside, you literally make real yield. And if you have a fundamental thesis that block space will be valuable in the future, and capital markets can benefit from high performance while being secure, and those capital markets can compose with each other because of the scale that the chain allows. And that seems like a very good domino effect where you can feel pretty comfortable holding that asset. So that's kind of my thesis for it and why I hold basically all my crypto and sol. So I think, and by the way, people will say something like, well, it goes down sometimes. And while it hasn't went down since February, what happens when it goes down is that it halts itself on purpose to prioritize safety so that your funds are actually safe, so there's no real risk. Or actually there's basically no risk of funds, loss of funds.
00:41:16.428 - 00:41:36.394, Speaker B: The only exception is if you have this open leveraged position and maybe liquidation bots have some sort of latency race before the change shuts down or something, or oracle attacks. But if you're just holding the spot asset and staking you're protected from inflation and you earn real yield. So seems like a no brainer to.
00:41:36.402 - 00:42:09.720, Speaker A: Me on that topic though I've been thinking recently because to me the, the staking yield you get on soul is like astonishingly high. It's like above 8% which is, I don't know, more than double what you would get for holding t bills or something. And obviously SOUL is a riskier asset than bonds but that, that 8% has to go down. Right as more people stake their soul. Like do you have an understanding of what drives the staking rate?
00:42:11.620 - 00:42:53.106, Speaker B: So actually if you listen to the last episode that I did with Anatoly, the staking or the inflation rate is arbitrary. It was set based on cosmos parameters and it was just a random number. And to be fair it is a curve that goes down over time so keeps going down, down, down and it's, it's a black box. The money doesn't leave the system or something. Basically what happens is if you're not staking, you get diluted by people who basically are staking because the stakers are protected from the inflation. And I believe, I don't know the exact amount but it's, it's not 8%. The real number is not 8%.
00:42:53.106 - 00:43:39.608, Speaker B: It ends up being something slightly lower than that. And there will be some proposals to reduce this. Totally doesn't care and nor should he. It's just about. And there are some other mechanisms that are that were, let's say pondered by other folks. For example time based staking where the longer you stake the higher yield you earn such that it you have these parameters or maybe dynamic issuance based on different parameters. And so those are all interesting experiments to play out but currently it's simply just attacks let's say from stakers on non stickers.
00:43:39.784 - 00:43:52.540, Speaker A: But it's not, it's not just inflation. Right. Because stakers will share or validators will share MEV rewards with their stakers as well. So the, the yield on staked SOUL comes from multiple places.
00:43:53.280 - 00:44:33.140, Speaker B: Yep. But I guess you get it from yeah, mostly inflation. A pretty good chunk from MEV rewards recently. And that also depends on what cut the validator is taking. So a quick lesson is validators make money in three ways and you see commission numbers when you're staking with them. And what those commission numbers means, the native one, what it means is given that this validator makes all this money from issuance, are they taking a cut of that or are they giving it all back to you or what percent are they taking a Cut of. So for Helix, for example, we take a 0% cut, meaning everything goes back to the people who staked with us.
00:44:33.140 - 00:45:31.510, Speaker B: And then there's MEV commission, which you can only see on certain sites, so something like Stakewiz you can see it on. And Jito searchers tip the validators to include their block and the validator accepts it and then it collects these, accumulates these tips, and perhaps it takes some percent of a cut and then passes the remaining back to the validator or the stakers. With Helios, for example, it's 0%. We take no cuts, we just get the money and then we shovel it right back out to the stakers. And three, which is going to be the interesting thing to watch in the next few months is there's block rewards where you pay a priority fee, the native priority fee that you pay from the wallet, let's say, and that goes directly to the validator. And there is not an in protocol way of passing that back to the staker. Currently now there is a SIMD which will be activated sometime in the future such that there is a method for this.
00:45:31.510 - 00:45:56.270, Speaker B: And at that point you'll then also need to look at, okay, how much of the block rewards are they giving me? With Helix, for example, what we're going to do is we're going to take some of the block rewards that come in and we're going to deposit it back into the eight soul pool, such that it's the functional equivalent of us passing it back, except via the lst. So you can do all sorts of things like that.
00:45:57.370 - 00:46:46.536, Speaker A: Yeah, I, I was thinking about doing a piece on this this week of basically, when the price of soul goes up, where does value flow? Because it's not as straightforward as you'd think. So like as you mentioned, Mert, you essentially get diluted if you're not staking your soul, if you're just holding the sole asset as inflation happens. There's also a chart that Dan posted in the Lightspeed Telegram, which if listeners, if you're not in the Lightspeed Telegram, join the Lightspeed Telegram. I tweeted the link to it, but essentially something like 97% of inflation ends up going to stakers and only 3% to validators. So that split is like really staker heavy. And I wonder if that also starts to shift or something. But we've spent not nearly enough time talking about meme coins.
00:46:46.536 - 00:47:18.536, Speaker A: So one thing I wanted to insert here that I thought was interesting this week is Robin Hood listed a bunch of assets that formerly were deemed securities by the sec. Solana, xrp, maybe most importantly Cardano. Congratulations to you, Mert. But that was very interesting to see. Also listen, Cardano, Charles Hoskinson has the. By his, by his own account has the ear of the Trump White House. So Cardano might be, might be the play.
00:47:18.536 - 00:48:01.358, Speaker A: Mert. They might have a lot of, might have a lot of crow eating to do. But all that to say you also saw Coinbase in one day list both Pepe and Dog with Hat and, you know, listing meme coins only. So interesting. But I think on the Robinhood and the Coinbase front, it definitely shows a shift in how these exchanges are thinking about regulatory risk. They're, you know, Robin, the SEC's opinion technically has not changed about Seoul and Ada and all these other assets that are alleged securities. Same with Coinbase.
00:48:01.358 - 00:48:56.988, Speaker A: The, the significance of them listing Pepe and WIF is that coinbase had a policy in which it would only list assets if they had utility. So I think the last meme coin that coinbase listed was Bonk. But Bonk has these things like bonkbot and all these things it did to show that it has utility and so it can be listed on Coinbase. I don't think Dog Whiff hat has any utility that you can point to other than, you know, if it goes on the Vegas sphere, who knows. But it, it shows a corner in how exchange listings might be working, which is interesting because Gensler is still in charge at the sec. It's not entirely clear if Trump legally can fire him, although he has, you know, pledged to try to do so. But if that doesn't happen, Gensler could still be around for, I believe, a year and a half, up to two years, something like that.
00:48:56.988 - 00:49:37.688, Speaker A: So I think it's interesting seeing these exchanges start to change the way they're thinking about regulatory risk and start listing all these coins that they didn't before. Probably. It's just there's going to be a bull market. We want to have soul on Robinhood because lots of users want to trade it. And so even if Gensler may still be in charge, we're just going to make the bet that Trump will be able to fire him and install a more favorable regime. But congratulations. Like Whiff and Pepe Holders, that that is my one note that we're seeing an interesting exchange listings policy change here in real time.
00:49:37.824 - 00:49:43.976, Speaker B: I mean, Trump launched a himself, so unless, yes, he's going to come after him too, which they're not.
00:49:44.048 - 00:49:53.828, Speaker A: We haven't seen any w World Liberty Financial Token, you know, no one's talking about that token. That might be the. That might be the play anyways, perhaps.
00:49:53.924 - 00:50:44.606, Speaker B: Or Doge went up because, you know, the new Department of Government Efficiency, I believe, which is a great department, by the way. Yeah. I mean, Coinbase and Robinhood have to maximize profits for the shareholders, and I think it's pretty stupid. I'll reframe. I think it's very arbitrary and silly to randomly allow and disallow different coins based on these parameters. Just make the regulatory framework clear so people can use it instead of guess and play these legal games and because what that does is it actually Coinbase is a super strong legal team. They can get around it or they can fight it.
00:50:44.606 - 00:51:01.374, Speaker B: They can do. They can do all these things. The smaller exchanges can't do shit. They're scared. And while I don't even think people should be using centralized exchanges, sometimes you have no choice to, let's say on ramp, off ramp, things like that. So I'm all for it.
00:51:01.462 - 00:51:41.046, Speaker A: Okay, we have a couple minutes left here. Couple other items to get through. Shane Coplin, I don't know if I'm pronouncing that correctly, but CEO of polymarket, his house was searched by the FBI yesterday. It. According to reporting in various outlets, the FBI is investigating Copland for running an unlicensed commodities exchange because the platform settled with the CFTC in 2022 and said it wouldn't let us users on the platform. I think it's kind of obvious that there were US users on the platform. And so I guess it's investigating whether polymarket was explicitly encouraging that.
00:51:41.046 - 00:52:17.540, Speaker A: This is notable especially because it comes shortly after Pavel Durov, the Telegram CEO, was arrested in France, who's also, you know, a popular founder of a crypto adjacent app. I guess you could say Kaplan framed this as like a personal attack by the Biden administration. More details are yet to emerge, but I don't know, it could get. It could get interesting, it could get weird. I wonder if this will. You know, I doubt he gets arrested like, like Durov did, but I don't know what your take is on this whole situation, Mert.
00:52:18.600 - 00:52:29.632, Speaker B: So I read a bit of history on this, actually. I read Pirate Wires, which is my favorite publication, by Mike Solana. Actually, his last name is Solana.
00:52:29.696 - 00:52:30.822, Speaker A: Yeah, it's very funny.
00:52:31.016 - 00:53:47.274, Speaker B: I think he's the head of. He's head of comms at Founders Fund, I believe, and also runs pirate wires and they go into the history of what exactly is the CFTC doing about prediction markets and basically what they've tried to do is they've tried to classify betting on all these things or prediction markets as gaming and they've brought actions against Kalshi I believe is the other one in the past and even DARPA in the past. And although I'm not sure if the DARPA was by CFTC or by another entity and basically something they had these cases and people should read this full post actually. And the court, the district court actually was not really favorable to cftc. They basically said well you can't just classify everything as gaming because that undermines the Senate Senate's word on this. Which Senate basically said here are the things you're not allowed to do and like elections was not including one of them. And so CFTC is taking a very favorable or broad look on that and trying to make the case for it.
00:53:47.274 - 00:54:39.670, Speaker B: Vibes based litigation is what I like to call it. And it seems like that court basically said no, like you can't really do this and they passed it back down to the other court again and based that article makes a pretty compelling case that it's very silly to or at least it's shaky at best to let CFTC kind of run wild on this. And then so that's that. So I don't think that's going to be a very strong claim based on what I read there and based on already existing court rulings. I did see something like it. The DOJ probe is about if they willingly let US citizens or residents access the app. I don't know the details on that.
00:54:39.670 - 00:55:14.128, Speaker B: It seems to me like they took measure. I mean they obviously took measures to not let us people go on it. I couldn't go on it when I was in the US and I'm not, I don't even think I go on in Canada. I don't quite remember. But so that that part I have no comment on. The other thing that I did see was there was this viral email actually from somebody from Kalshi emailing someone about hey these guys are doing some suspicious look into it. Which I was like, you know, what the are you doing here? It's too early in the game for Sabotage games and Zero Sum Games.
00:55:14.128 - 00:55:45.552, Speaker B: We're just trying to get crypto to the mass here. So that obviously lost him a bunch of customers and brand reputation. I will not use them. And of course Shane came back with new phone who dis after they took his phone. So that was good. And then Elon commented on it too. So if they want visibility, the visibility being the administration, they got It, Although I don't think it's going to be very favorable for them because again, it's.
00:55:45.552 - 00:56:03.900, Speaker B: I find it very bizarre that people just randomly attack crypto for no real reason. And it's just not, I think. What was that? Pack the crypto. Favored candidates. I think it was like 92 to 6 or something. Like they.
00:56:04.920 - 00:56:06.818, Speaker A: Yeah, they won nearly all of the races.
00:56:06.984 - 00:56:40.470, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. So, like, what are you doing? I'm not quite sure. And the thing that got me. And perhaps I should have taken more time to gather my thoughts, but raiding his house is like, what the hell is that? Why would you. Because you can just. Hey, Shane's attorney, we're going to need to see this and that and this. Usual channels, like, what are you, what are you doing? It just seems North Korean esque.
00:56:40.470 - 00:57:02.192, Speaker B: Obviously that's a dramatic escalation, but don't do that. I don't. I mean, Shane can fight it. He has money, he has support, he has resources. But what message is that? Sending that to other entrepreneurs who are building things and they're like, oh, well, I'm not sure if I should do this because the government will literally raid my house. So I don't like that. But we'll see where it goes.
00:57:02.192 - 00:57:05.340, Speaker B: Maybe potentially there's details I'm not aware of.
00:57:05.880 - 00:57:55.578, Speaker A: Yeah, it's, it's so early, details are yet to emerge. I think my reading, my, my speculation, I'm, I'm openly speculating here. I think that, like, you'll see claims that it was a politically motivated attack, quote unquote. I don't think that's entirely true. I think if I had to guess, it's some version of the FBI has been working, or the doj, whichever agency is running this, has been working on a case against Coplin where they believe that Polymarket has been openly soliciting US users to the platform, which, who knows, maybe they were, maybe they weren't. There's definitely a business incentive to do so, but I have no knowledge of what was going on inside of Polymarket. They see that a Trump administration is coming in, they're going to lose their jobs and they don't believe that a Trump administration would continue the probe.
00:57:55.578 - 00:59:07.900, Speaker A: And so they're basically pushing to get this done before January 20th or whenever the inauguration is. So in that sense, it was, I could see it maybe being politically motivated in the sense of, you know, careers are made based on, in law enforcement, based on getting these big convictions against big companies and so forth. And so if you're able to, you know, hand down a big fine to Polymarket that maybe looks good on your career. And so perhaps whoever's inside of these agencies feels pressure to get the probe finished before an unfriendly administration to their work enters. Obviously it sucks to have your, your home rated and your phone taken and all of that. And, and I do hope that, you know, it all resolves to nothing because I think Polymarket is a really interesting app and this election was, I think, a huge success for them, especially with the way that Polymarket correctly predicted the election outcome in a way that traditional polls did not, which is what crypto people were saying all along, and it ended up being true. So credit where it's due, but that'll be an interesting one to follow for sure.
00:59:09.730 - 00:59:34.154, Speaker B: Yeah. And also it's just stupid that US citizens can't use it. Like that's article makes a case about this too. It's like it's markets. People are just casting votes based on their money on what they think is correct or what will happen. And that's just one data point amongst many other data points. There's also polls, there's also other things, there's commentary.
00:59:34.154 - 00:59:40.388, Speaker B: All this and so this weird babysitting mentality, I'm just philosophically opposed to.
00:59:40.444 - 00:59:55.840, Speaker A: You would love to see more of a pro innovation stance on this, but we will see where it all goes. But Mert, it's been a great episode. Thanks for coming on with me. Canada, please give this man his money back. That's all he wants. And we will see you all in the next one.
00:59:56.860 - 01:00:03.560, Speaker B: Yes, sir. Fuck Canada. It.
