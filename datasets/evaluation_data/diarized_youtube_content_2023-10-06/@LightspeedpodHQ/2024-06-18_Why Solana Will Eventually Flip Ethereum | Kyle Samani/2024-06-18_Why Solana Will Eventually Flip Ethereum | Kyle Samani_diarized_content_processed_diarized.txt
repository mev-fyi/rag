00:00:00.560 - 00:00:15.982, Speaker A: At some point there is going to be in a fairly short window of time, like it'll probably be a one to three month span. The market is going to say, oh wow, the flipping is real. Meaning solely it's not meaning HTTPC. I do think it will happen, and then when it happens, it will be. It'll be pretty quick.
00:00:16.118 - 00:00:56.652, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by Helium Mobile. They've created a crypto native phone plan for unlimited talk, text and data for just $20 a month. We'll chat more about them later in the show.

00:00:56.652 - 00:01:26.900, Speaker B: Okay, lets jump into the episode. All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Lightspeed. We are joined today by Kyle Samani, the managing partner at Multicoin, who has a strong track record of interesting theses. And it's really no secret that he is excited about a future that prioritizes high throughput systems, including Solana. Kyle, the last time we had you on it was about ten months ago. Title of the episode was ending the monolith modular versus monolithic debate. Ten months later.
00:01:26.900 - 00:01:52.424, Speaker B: We have certainly not in that debate, but it does feel like we're making some progress in either direction nonetheless. But thanks for coming on. We've got an exciting lineup for us today to jam on, but I want to start things off a little bit different than usual. And the question I want to ask to get things moving is like when somebody who's loosely familiar with maybe bitcoin Ethereum Solana asks you, what is the core value proposition of building in crypto? How do you respond?
00:01:53.564 - 00:02:46.534, Speaker A: Uh, it's the best financial rails to move money around. One thing zooming out for a second, you know, there's all this discourse of, like, decentralized identities and computers that make commitments and trust, minimize computation, and like, all these other very abstract constructs, um, I really think they pollute your. Your mind of like, what, what are blockchains? Blockchains are asset ledgers. And if you look at actually the presentation I gave at the multicoin summit last year I open up, which was about modular versus integrated. I open up the presentation asking the question, what do blockchains do? And blockchains do really one thing, they keep track of who owns what at any block. Like a block is static at a moment in time. And there's a list of who owns what.
00:02:46.534 - 00:03:37.414, Speaker A: And so, you know, like, and then like, there's really two things you can do with a list of who owns what. You can either trade assets or you can make a payment. And really, if you think about it, trading assets is just two atomic payments going back, going back and forth. So really all you can do is pay people. Like, these systems kind of have like one base function. And like, these systems are either nine years old if you're measuring ethereum, or like 14 years old if you're counting from bitcoin. And like, we have yet to unlock a use case that is not payments, with a couple of very small exceptions, like governance, voting is kind of cool and stuff, but everything else basically maps to that calling these things like computers that make trust, minimize computation, all these things, world computer, Internet computer, I think these terms are actively confusing.
00:03:37.414 - 00:03:57.384, Speaker A: These are asset ledgers, they are financial systems. And they are much better financial systems than the old ones, for lots of obvious reasons. And so we focus our energy and effort on people who recognize the interesting properties of this financial system and are building applications that can leverage it.
00:03:58.644 - 00:04:19.154, Speaker C: With that in mind, does that play nicely into the idea of a globally shared state? Fundamentally, if all these things are just asset ledgers, then presumably you not want the state across multiple different ecosystems. Is that how you think about the l one l two thesis?
00:04:22.054 - 00:04:57.824, Speaker A: Kind of. And before I jump into that, I also want to add one other comment, which is there are a bunch of interesting tools, like ceramic, tableland, Filecoin, are we, these other things that, like those systems, they have Filecoin and arweave, happen to have their own asset ledgers. Those systems are clearly pretty functionally distinct. Those systems are about storing large volumes of data. So I would just say that crypto is broader than asset ledgers. I want to be clear about that. And Multicoin is an investor, or has invested in all four of those names that I just mentioned, among others who are playing around in that space.
00:04:57.824 - 00:05:38.754, Speaker A: But I think it's important to note, like, when we're Solana and Ethereum are very different than Arweave and ceramic and tableland. These are like, functionally, these systems do functionally different things. We can come back and touch on those other things if you want, but those are different, and those are not blockchains. They are inspired by blockchains, certainly, and they, I'd say, tend to reflect the ethos of the crypto ecosystem, but they are functionally not asset ledgers. Come back to your question, myrt of like. Well, does the implication that asset ledger means should we have, like, one global asset ledger? I don't. That's too clean of a conclusion.
00:05:38.754 - 00:06:35.814, Speaker A: The reality is you can have multiple asset ledgers as long as they're bridged together. The most important asset ledger bridge in the world is between the Fed and all of the banks, right? And obviously, every time you move a wire or do an achievement, then you're hitting the Fed bridge, so to speak, to move money from JP Morgan, the Bank of America, and the way we have scaled financial systems over the last 40 years to support, I don't know, four, five, 6 billion people or something like that have electronic banking today. Obviously, there is no single AWS application that supports that scale. Maybe the chinese or the indian ones are the closest to that. I'm actually not sure, and I don't appreciate the architectures of the systems, how federated those are internally. I don't know the details, but you can't have asset bridges is obviously the core point. Asset bridges are fine.
00:06:35.814 - 00:07:28.136, Speaker A: I think it's improbable that we will have 8 billion people on one asset ledger, especially if you start imagining that you have IoT devices and cars and other weird things. Also, having private keys that need to move money around, that's not going to all fit on one asset ledger, at least not given current extrapolations of Moore's law, Nielsen's law, to the best of my understanding, absence and breakthroughs in hardware. But I think you can get pretty far on one asset ledger. The other problem with bridges is historically all bridged asset ledgers, again, fed to the banks, are all based on trust. That that's the only way it's ever been able to work. And if you look at all of the bridges in crypto, you know, they all, various spectrums of trust in those bridges. Um, pretty hard to say any of them are actually trust minimized.
00:07:28.136 - 00:08:26.814, Speaker A: Um, even the Oru and ZKR flavored bridges, uh, like, I wouldn't call those trust risk free, because the orus are just new, the fraud proofs are new and weird. And with zkRs, like, dude, there's like a real chance that there's a cryptography bug in these things, and they just implode tomorrow, it's going to be like three to five years before we can definitively say like before, you'll be able to say with a straight face that we have a genuinely trust minimized asset bridge. That's, that's three to five years away. Just, just given like tail risk with these things, because the definition of trust minimized means you have eradicated tail risk. So we're a long ways away from that. There will be multiple asset ledgers, but probably one asset ledger can support, you know, at a million TPS world, which I think is within the realm of physics today, you can support a lot with a million TPS. I don't know if that means a 500 million people or 3 billion people.
00:08:26.814 - 00:08:34.374, Speaker A: Unclear. Depends on, you know, average transactions per day per person. But a million TPS will get us a long way.
00:08:37.314 - 00:09:10.794, Speaker B: And with that thesis in mind, there, there's kind of, this kind of like breaks into two things in my mind. One is like the infrastructure layer and actually building out these rails and these, these asset ledgers as you refer to them. And the other one is like, what gets built on top? We're going to get into like a robust conversation around the infrastructure layer and here at the, towards the later part of the episode. But I want to talk about the application layer on top. Like what I know you mentioned earlier a couple of your investments that you're excited about, but like, what at the application layer, like which verticals are you really, really excited about that crypto rails uniquely empower.
00:09:11.654 - 00:09:40.624, Speaker A: Yeah. The two areas we're spending most of our time on at the firm today are stablecoins and deepin and deepin. And I'll include D vin as well in that. So those are probably the most, two most interesting payment applications we've discovered. I should say like application layer, things of blockchains we've discovered. We continue to follow gaming. We have one gaming investment called portals that is actually doing pretty nice.
00:09:40.624 - 00:10:12.934, Speaker A: They've been very quietly growing and are actually doing quite well. Caught up with the founder this morning, but I'd say gaming, it's still TBD. If it really works with DPin and Dvan, I can say pretty confidently it works. With stablecoin payments, very confidently it works. So we're spending our time there. Around stable coins, there's lots of things to do. There's the basic thing of just like get wallets in the hands of people all over the world, and that is not a homogenous problem.
00:10:12.934 - 00:10:54.474, Speaker A: Getting wallets in the hands of everyone in the world is inherently regional and local. Obviously, you're gonna have local governments. You gotta deal with. There's one team I met recently that like, they're focused on, I think they're called juntas, which are like these group savings programs that are fairly common in Latam and other countries around the world. And their core thesis is we can get crypto wallets in the hands of people by building basically a junta as a smart contract on a blockchain. And there's other people focusing on this in different places. So there's really hundreds of, should be hundreds of entra scale opportunities, I think, for teams focused on the right ways to get stable coins in the hands of people.
00:10:54.474 - 00:11:41.518, Speaker A: The other very obvious class of applications on top of stablecoin are facilitating, making it easier for businesses to conduct business in stablecoins. To overly simplify business payment flows, you've got pay ins and payouts. Pay ins meaning customer pays business and crypto. And then payouts is the more interesting one is business pays its suppliers in crypto. The most obvious example of this would be paying Uber drivers like stablecoin payouts. So paying on only one, which is that new Solana app or like onlyfans payouts in stablecoin. That's actually a very interesting and like pretty obvious use case I think you'll probably see in the next few years companies like Grab or other like long tail, like basically anyone doing Uber or DoorDash or Taskrabbit or like fiverr, all of these things.
00:11:41.518 - 00:12:30.744, Speaker A: I'm fairly certain we'll offer stable coin payouts within the next few years because their customers, the suppliers and the systems will demand it. Theres obviously lots of stuff around on and off boarding stablecoins. Youve got all these peer to peer exchanges and stuff, people like Dymo and El Dorado and a bunch of these other things all over the world. So theres some fairly obvious categories of stuff to invest in around stablecoins and then theres obviously issuers, which is the core of it. We just announced our investment in Mountain protocol a few days ago. Mountain protocol is to the best of our knowledge, the only team that has a regulatory, credible, permissionless stable coin that you can move around the blockchain that accrues yield on an auto rebasing basis every day. So meaning you have your wallet today, you open your wallet tomorrow and you have more dollars, you don't have to go claim it or whatever.
00:12:30.744 - 00:13:06.762, Speaker A: It just, they just appear based on obviously the risk free treasury rate from us government. So those are like the obvious things around stable coins. There may be some other non obvious sectors, but those are the obvious ones. We have made bets in all of the above and continue to look for more. More on deep in D vin networks we've been one of the most active investors generally. There have made a ton of investments and a bunch recently that are not yet disclosed, but continue to be very intrigued. We recently made our third true d pin investment, meaning one that has a hardware component.
00:13:06.762 - 00:13:51.664, Speaker A: Helium was our first, Hivemapper was our second. I can't announce what the third one is, but we did just get a deal done with them. It is in the energy sector, so smart grid, virtual power plant kind of a thing. And then devins, there's a ton of these. Most of the D vins call themselves dpins, which I think is a little confusing. We internally think about those as very different constructs. But the number of people trying to distribute video, anything video related, anything bandwidth related, anything storage related, certain types of compute workloads, these are all fairly interesting challenges to distribute and there are I mean today probably 200 or 300 teams working on various versions of this and we're certainly pretty aggressive there.
00:13:51.784 - 00:14:33.904, Speaker B: Decentralized physical infrastructure networks are a massive point of emphasis in the crypto industry today, and helium mobile is a fantastic example of a business that is leveraging this distribution approach. Like any network, there's a supply and a demand side. So the supply comes from hotspot deployers, while the demand comes from phone plan subscribers. Together they create and power a decentralized wireless network that provides expanded connectivity and amazingly priced phone plans. But let's zoom in on how it works for deployers. So you get this device and you set up this hotspot, and anytime a helium mobile phone user is near your device, they will send and receive data through the Internet using your device instead of their cellular network. The cool thing here is that you earn mobile token rewards for providing this service based on the amount of data routed by your device and how much coverage you're creating.
00:14:33.904 - 00:15:16.218, Speaker B: Theres also what are called boosted locations which are directing rewards to the targeted areas that actually help individuals and businesses deploy these devices in the proper areas where coverage is actually needed. Based on where subscribers are currently, thats in LA and Miami, but soon to be coming to New York City again. By creating coverage, youre helping build a better network together while earning mobile token rewards. If providing the service is something thats up your alley, head over to hellohelium.com hotspot to get 15% off your indoor or outdoor helium mobile hotspot using the code lightspeed hotspot that is all caps, no space light speed hotspot. And we'll be sure to put that link in the show notes starting from the top there. You mentioned getting wallets in the hands of everybody.
00:15:16.218 - 00:15:45.004, Speaker B: And the LAtAM context is really, really interesting. In the west, it feels like the holy grail moment would be like, I don't know, Apple just released that new tap to pay thing, right? If that was, if you could do that with USDC on the spot, that to me, that kind of feels like the holy grail moment. Solana saga is going the other direction of like, let's get the device in people's hands rather than like, the. Where the devices already are. Like getting crypto into the device. What do you think about, like, what that looks like in the west for actually getting, you know, crypto rails in people's hands?
00:15:46.744 - 00:16:10.414, Speaker A: I think buying coffee at Starbucks in the United States is the final frontier for crypto. I don't spend any energy thinking about that. Not relevant at all. Not going to happen in the foreseeable future. Don't spend your time on it. Focus on low hanging fruit, which is retail outside the US. The greater the industry, the better.
00:16:10.414 - 00:16:23.274, Speaker A: The more difficult. Even industries that just deal with payouts. Any marketplace business dealing with payouts is more interesting than consumer buying Starbucks with crypto. Consumer buying Starbucks with crypto is the final thing that happens.
00:16:25.574 - 00:16:31.314, Speaker C: What do you and the firm think about RWas? What's your thesis on those?
00:16:33.374 - 00:17:11.374, Speaker A: Look, I'm happy they exist. It's great. I think the term is mostly counterproductive because it is homogenizing assets that are not homogenous. Tokenized equities are very different than tokenized real estate, which is very different than something like parcel, which is very different than debt on chain, which is very different than mountain protocol and tether and circle USDC. So I think you need to reason about each of these markets on a basically a per asset class basis. The only RWA category that really matters today is stable coins. Nothing else is even within two orders of magnitude of that.
00:17:11.374 - 00:17:59.184, Speaker A: And that will continue to be true for quite some time. I think that will stop being true once stable coins eclipse a trillion and their rate of growth slows down because it's a function of size. But it doesn't mean other categories can't become interesting. Probably the next most interesting category is us equities. Just because, hey, things that get a lot of pressure, there are people who may want to access them that cannot. I actually put out a tweet a few days ago being like, hey, when roaring kitty was talking about GameStop a week ago, there was a news cycle that said e trader was considering banning his account for manipulation or something. So I retweeted that and said, hey, this is your opportunity for tokenized equities.
00:17:59.184 - 00:18:48.304, Speaker A: So if I were to guess, I think the next asset that eclipses 10 billion on chain for, like, a single asset type that is, like, not dollar treasuries slash currency issued by governments, I would say it's most likely to be equities because at least they're fun. They're interesting, they're volatile, and there are a lot of people who can't access them. We're poking around there. We have not made any investments there, but we're poking around beyond that. Everything else, hard to say. It's interesting. As a venture investor, again, I'm very glad that people are putting private credit funds on chain and tokenizing real estate and whatever my ability to profit from that seems basically impossible.
00:18:48.884 - 00:19:04.236, Speaker C: So let's turn it the complete opposite way around. Solana currently is the center for social coins, meme coins, things that are not real world stuff. What are you? Not multicore? But what do you think about social coins and meme coins?
00:19:04.380 - 00:19:34.732, Speaker A: You know, the more older I get, the more I appreciate capitalism and, like, not having the government tell you what you can and can't do and how things should be run. So, like, I'm very supportive of the existence of meme coins. Fuck it. Go have fun, man. So far, they haven't actually accomplished anything of substance. That doesn't mean that they can't. And, like, hey, let's see what Iggy is doing with cell phone service.
00:19:34.732 - 00:20:03.884, Speaker A: I don't. I don't know. Cool. Let's see where it goes. I'm guessing she's kind of looking at Ryan Reynolds just made a couple bill, and I'm guessing that's her inspo. I'm skeptical of the path of meme coin to cell phone service, but, you know, like, she may prove me wrong. I continue to look for, like, ways for meme coins to become a more interesting than just strictly, like, speculative fun.
00:20:03.884 - 00:20:11.804, Speaker A: Um, I have not identified a path for that to actually happen, but we continue to observe and try and make sense of it.
00:20:12.544 - 00:20:22.494, Speaker C: I think Tushar said something like, this might be web3 native gaming instead of this humor fix. You know, triple A's coming on chain. Do you agree with that?
00:20:23.874 - 00:20:54.666, Speaker A: There is something to, like, the. The hive mind of, like, hey, we're all in it together, but also like, hey, you, I'm going to sell my bags to you, and like, there's an inherent tension there and an inherent, you know, like the hive mind gets excited on the Internet together. So I don't know if I'd call it, you can call it a game if you want. If you just say, like, it's some function of entertainment. If that's the definition of game, then yes, I think. I think these are games. My definition of game, I think, is a little narrower than then just like, provides entertainment to me.
00:20:54.666 - 00:21:32.126, Speaker A: Game is, you know, there's a screen and an app, and, like, you click the buttons and there's some, there's some, like, defined objective, but, you know, eyes wide open that there's no explicitly right or wrong answer there. To be clear, there are some crypto gaming teams that are interesting. I am very skeptical of 99% of them. And multicoin is, generally speaking, avoided that sector. But, like, portals is interesting. What third, what photo finish is doing photo finish live is interesting, and then what the, what's it called, parallel colony guys are doing. I think those are really genuinely interesting.
00:21:32.126 - 00:21:47.302, Speaker A: There's some, I'd say, longer tail interesting stuff happening around autonomous worlds, but admittedly, I think that is more, far more niche in what they're going for. So I'm not as optimistic, but those three are the three that have, like, I've caught my eye and I'm paying attention.
00:21:47.478 - 00:22:07.234, Speaker B: Can you expand on why you find those ones interesting? Because largely, you know, people keep talking about on chain gaming and, like, every action is on chain, and that doesn't. I can't, I can't, I haven't, I can't get that. Get over that bridge where that makes a ton of sense. But, you know, people, the idea of putting the marketplace on chain, okay, that probably makes sense, but how do you, how do you, like, put these into context? And why do you think those ones are interesting?
00:22:07.854 - 00:22:31.326, Speaker A: Um, they're all interesting for very different reasons. Uh, photofinny, I think, is interesting because, um, it's horse racing. Horse racing is explicitly gambling. And, like, what is crypto speculative gambling? So, like, it just maps very cleanly. Um, and the team, like, uh, Ian and the team is. This is their third iteration of building horse racing games on online. So, like, they know the market, they know how to do it.
00:22:31.326 - 00:22:52.394, Speaker A: You know, they're like the endorsed, um, like, horsefitting app from the Kentucky Derby. The whole team was just there a few weeks ago. I was also at the derby and, like, saw them there. And, like, you know, it, it's cool, it works. The system makes sense for that. You know, niche and it seems to be growing. I generally, the odd numbers appear to be up into the right, although I don't know the details.
00:22:52.394 - 00:23:47.554, Speaker A: Parallel colony to me is interesting because it's, it's the most ambitious crypto game I've seen by, by far. And I generally like things just as a function of sheer ambition. Once the AI boom kind of started to happen twelve to 18 months ago, a very obvious thing to go do was build a simulation of the world where each person in the world is an LLM or like some AI agent thing. I'm sure there's lots of teams doing this now. Like, inside of unreal engine, for example, there's been a lot of discussion of, like, airports are using unreal engine to model, like, traffic flow through. And, like, I'm sure some of the people in the traffic flow are like, LLMs. But the more interesting iteration of that is with economics where, like, you've got all of these players in a system and, like, they, they all have, you know, defined economic objectives and stuff.
00:23:47.554 - 00:24:27.484, Speaker A: And, and obviously those objectives are heterogeneous. And you throw a bunch of people in a room and, like, see what happens. That is going to happen. Like, there's going to be some sort of large scale virtual simulation thing that we create that, like, is thriving. That seems inevitable to me. And, like, given all of the Sci-Fi inspo from the Matrix and a bunch of other movies, it's a sexy enough of an idea that, like, it'll, it'll capture the imagination of, like, all the tech nerds around the world. And so I'm like, 100% probability we get some sort of economized simulation thing.
00:24:27.484 - 00:24:58.664, Speaker A: And the parallel colony team, as far as I can tell, is the first pedigreed team to try and go for it. Maybe too early. Who knows? Tons of execution risk, tons of technical risk, really just hard with something like this. It is inherently path dependent. And so there's a real case that, like, the first guys do it, make a bajillion mistakes, and the optimal move is to just watch them, like, learn from all of their mistakes and then, like, try again. Um, who know? Who knows? Love the team. Sasha and the guys, super smart.
00:24:58.664 - 00:25:30.926, Speaker A: We are not investors, but, like, incredibly ambitious. And, like, I love it. Just as a function of sheer ambition. Uh, and then the third is portals, which we are an investor in. Um, portals is, uh, I'd say they're like, trying to fulfill the vision that probably LittlebigPlanet first started to go after, which is like a tool set to create a game. In a game, Roblox is kind of the other thing that's in the same bucket. But Roblox is like, it's simplified to the point of like really limiting.
00:25:30.926 - 00:26:04.504, Speaker A: And obviously that was by design. Roblox is really trying to push the boundaries of like a game that lets you create any arbitrary game strictly with visual tools. That to me strikes me as fairly important. And then in terms of the crypto part, they are like, look, we need an on chain economy. We need economic tools in the ability to create arbitrary games. And it was very natural for them to use crypto rails for that. So really focusing on complete permissionlessness, complete openness, that struck me as pretty important.
00:26:04.504 - 00:26:13.484, Speaker A: Those three games are interesting to me for extremely different reasons, but they all have elements that are cool.
00:26:15.224 - 00:26:49.424, Speaker C: Going back to meme coins. Something that's happened is they've given rise to a lot of financial activity on chain, especially in the form of Meb. The other day, Solana foundation announced that they'll be pulling stake from those who do private mempools to sandwich retail, which received a lot of, let's say, straw men and misconceptions. But I think Tushar commented, saying something like this is kind of the proof of stake security model in practice. What are your general thoughts on that whole ordeal?
00:26:50.804 - 00:27:47.670, Speaker A: Non issue? I mean, it's like, dude, I'll try to give a more important framing. Proof of stake systems are explicitly political in a way that proof of work systems are not. Proof of work systems are somewhat political, meaning if you are a miner and you are allocating to a mining pool and you for whatever reason disagree with the operation, the values or the operations of mining pool, you can redirect your hash power elsewhere, or you can obviously just mine on your own, which economically is pretty stupid, but you have the right to do so. So proof of work mining is in theory perfectly objective, in practice almost perfectly objective, with like a small amount of politicization to it, but it's like very minimal. Proof of stake is not that. Proof of stake is explicitly political because the people who own the stake have inherently, like different beliefs and they live in different countries with different regulations and stuff. And like, moreover, like delegation is a reality for all proof of stake networks.
00:27:47.670 - 00:28:35.518, Speaker A: Ethereum doesn't codify that into the protocol, which is just stupid, because then you just get Lido and Coinbase and binary and all the other weird things that are just like funky and like just, just unnecessary complexity and silliness. But like, you have to recognize proof of six are inherently political and people should move their stake if they disagree with what their validators are doing. So I very much support their decision to do so. I think where maybe the, you know, the negative reaction comes from the ETH side on this is they're saying, oh, this is your way of like fighting me. Malicious mev actors. This is never going to work. Which that argument is like, correct in theory, but like, they're just like over extrapolating the importance of the foundation's actions.
00:28:35.518 - 00:28:52.214, Speaker A: The foundation's actions just represent a near term political decision to, like, not support people, which is fine. And that doesn't preclude all of the other stuff people are still trying to do to deal with Mev on chain. Like, all of those things continue to progress, right? So it's just like a complete straw man criticism.
00:28:54.034 - 00:29:06.298, Speaker C: I believe you once said that Mev is the primary value capture of an l one. Do you still believe this? How have your thoughts evolved? And if so, can you explain that?
00:29:06.386 - 00:30:20.882, Speaker A: Or why you believe that our views have not evolved? Tushar gave a great presentation on this at the 2022 multicoin summit. It's on YouTube. But that view remains unchanged. The core view and the simple version of it is, look, if you are staking tokens in a proof of stake network and there's MeV, then searcher, and assuming you have searchers who are selfish and economically rational people, then they will bid up fees and stuff to go after the MEV. And that will be captured, some of that will be captured by the validators, and the validators will pass those deals back to stakers, because that's built into Solana that they have to. So objectively, that is a mechanism of value capture that exists. The primary question that has existed and continues to exist and will exist forever, but it's going to take probably three to five years to have real clarity around it, is what is the distribution of that MeV between the l one, between searchers, between apps, and between, like, other middleware things.
00:30:20.882 - 00:30:49.738, Speaker A: So, like, most obviously would be like pith. They have like their OEV thing, which is basically like back running as a service. And it's unclear what the distribution of MEV will be. MEV profits will be across the different kinds of parties. I can make arguments today like that. Those things break down in 252-520-2525 roughly. I can make arguments for 70, the rest 30 kind of different ways to think about it.
00:30:49.738 - 00:30:59.074, Speaker A: I don't have a particularly strong view on how that breaks out, but eyes wide open that there's a large amount of variability where those profits grew.
00:31:02.294 - 00:31:12.326, Speaker B: And when you're thinking about transaction fees, I think it was a recent episode on Empire, actually. I think you said when you're modeling these things out, you write transaction fees down to zero. Can you elaborate on that?
00:31:12.470 - 00:31:58.134, Speaker A: What is the cost of a signature verification, plus a state update, plus storage for, like, one node? And if you really think about the electricity cost of all that, if you really think about that, it's, like, extremely close to zero. You know, you're talking fractions of a fraction of a fraction of a penny, and, like, yeah, you multiply by, call it a factor of 10,000 to replicate that across the network. But, like, you know, a millionth of a penny times 10,000 is, like, still a thousandth of a penny or whatever. So, like, I just, like, these numbers are close enough to zero that I treat them as zero. And Nielsen's law and Moore's law guaranteed that those numbers will go down over time. Like, they will asymptotically approach zero. So it just, like, model them, like, for the purposes of being evaluated, for evaluation.
00:31:58.134 - 00:32:02.134, Speaker A: Just like the conservative assumption is just treat them as zero.
00:32:04.474 - 00:32:10.274, Speaker B: Understood. Okay. And so the idea then being it's all about priority access to state, like, that's what drives value.
00:32:10.434 - 00:32:12.066, Speaker A: That's the only thing that matters.
00:32:12.250 - 00:32:30.660, Speaker B: Gotcha. Okay. And then when you. If we look at those two numbers today, Ethereum and Solana are largely the only places where there's meaningful mev capture happening today. We use those two as an example. There's, like, a, let's round here and say Ethereum's a $400 billion protocol, FDV, and Solana is 100. There's a forex gap there.
00:32:30.660 - 00:32:59.434, Speaker B: And if you look at the mev capture and priority fees on both of those chains, there's not a forex gap. And some days it's even. I would not really, I'm not going to say Solana has permanently eclipsed that by any means, but it is more in the conversation than any point in history for any chain relative to Ethereum. How do you think about this from, like, the valuation standpoint of, like, is the market mispricing this, or is this just, like, not an understood principle? Like, when you see the differences in those two gaps, like, what comes to your mind?
00:32:59.934 - 00:33:48.734, Speaker A: There's a $300 billion relative valuation mispricing. That would be the very quick answer to your question. The more nuanced answer would be, don't think the market appreciates this. Huge amounts of back bias, huge amounts of people not paying attention, huge amounts of people who just like, don't think about these concepts. Um, I do think this will be one of those things that's slowly than quickly. Um, meaning at some point there is going to be a, in a fairly short window of time, like call, it'll probably be a one to three month span in which kind of every, not all huge percentage of the market is going to say, oh, wow, like, it's the flipping is real meaning solid, not meaning ETPTC. And that will happen in a fairly condensed period.
00:33:48.734 - 00:33:54.682, Speaker A: I don't know when that will happen, but I do think it will happen. And then when it happens, it will be. It'll be pretty quick.
00:33:54.858 - 00:34:29.078, Speaker B: My friends, big, big news. Blockworks is hosting permissionless three in Salt Lake City this year. So we're heading west for three days starting October 9. Permissionless is our industry's premiere defi event that brings together crypto natives from all over the globe. I've personally been the last few years and can honestly say that the attendees are incredible. It's people who actually care about crypto. We'll also have more than 200 industry titans speaking at the event, and this includes builders like Lucas Breuder from Judo Labs and Brian Pellegrino from Layer Zero, or investors like Kyle Simone and Joe McCann, and even elected officials like representative Tom Emmer, who is fighting the good fight in Washington.
00:34:29.078 - 00:34:53.339, Speaker B: And it's narrative season, so we're going to be covering the seven hottest themes in crypto. This includes things like modularity and restaking your bitcoin and l two s, and even AI and crypto. The goal is to keep you up to speed on major developments in the industry. Ticket prices will be structurally increasing over time, so get your ticket today from my lightspeed family. I got you. We're going to use code lightspeed ten in all caps. No space for 10% off your ticket.
00:34:53.339 - 00:34:57.383, Speaker B: All right, everyone, I look forward to seeing you at permissionless three, and let's get back to the show.
00:34:58.283 - 00:35:17.654, Speaker C: There was a recent episode between Justin Drake and Tolle about a bunch of things, but maybe tying this back to the previous point, the issue of issuance came up and people all over the place don't know how to classify this, don't agree on how to classify it. What are your thoughts?
00:35:17.994 - 00:35:37.422, Speaker A: Yeah. Oh, I remember the last thing I was going to say, and then I'll answer your question. Mark. Last thing I was going to say is, actually, we have told our LP's and our LP communications. We expect Solana will, um, meaningfully eclipse ethereum on all relevant metrics. By the end of the year. Right now, it seems like maybe neck and neck, or maybe like 20% kind of delta roughly, but, like, you know, pretty close.
00:35:37.422 - 00:36:06.124, Speaker A: Uh, but we're on the record with our lp's making that prediction, and so I'll go on the record with the podcast, too. Um, Danz, your question, Mert. What do I think about issuance? Um, so the problem with Justin Drake's framing of it, there's, like, two fundamental assumptions he's making that are incorrect. One is that the price of the asset is arbitrary, or rather that the asset itself is non productive. In the case of bitcoin, that is true. Bitcoin is not a productive asset. It does nothing.
00:36:06.124 - 00:36:32.260, Speaker A: And moreover, miners very explicitly are attacks on the system. They have electricity bills. They have to pay them. That is clear. But the system is nonproductive. So that's like a fundamental difference in what these assets do. I guess to take Justin's side on that, he'd say, well, eat this money.
00:36:32.260 - 00:37:20.808, Speaker A: And I'm like, okay, well, you can call it commodity money if you want to, but, like, even the mechanism by which your system achieves commodity money status or becomes ultrasound, rather, is via this burn thing. And the reason people are bidding up transaction fees is because of MEV, because it's a productive asset, right? So you can't decouple these things. I do think it is fundamentally strange to have money being a productive asset. That also strikes me as fundamentally weird. There really isn't an example in history where money is a productive asset. Money has always been commodities or debt, and obviously today dollars are debt, in this case to the Fed. So that's one misconduct.
00:37:20.808 - 00:38:08.304, Speaker A: Sorry, the relevance of that issuance is. Well, yeah, if you just think the price is arbitrary, then minor selling or staker selling is bad, because that's driving the price down. But that's assuming there's no notion of fundamental value. My whole premise of why I like productive assets over bitcoin is because they have intrinsic value, which is based a function of their yield. Now, we can all disagree on growth rates and discount rates and all that other stuff, but objectively, they have yield. And so the point is that if there is a forced seller, that should not matter in the long run, because that means if there's a forced seller, the price is coming down, which is increasing the yield for someone else. So, like, the asset is finding its true price as a function of the market's perception of yield versus cost of capital and risk.
00:38:08.304 - 00:38:27.684, Speaker A: So, yeah, that's a fundamental misconception that Justin I think doesn't understand here, and to be fair, totally didn't express that in those terms either. But it is financially correct. The other major difference here is.
00:38:29.464 - 00:38:29.752, Speaker B: Who.
00:38:29.768 - 00:38:57.204, Speaker A: Is bearing the cost of issuance. And again, Justin, his frame in which he answers the question implies it's bitcoin, meaning you are a BTC holder and there are people mining and there's new coins being issued and they are selling. And so like, you are bearing the cost of their selling by the price coming down. That is, again, true in a proof of work context. That is not true in a proof of stake context. In a proof of state context, you can just take your coins and you are guaranteed to beat the rate of inflation. Justin tries to steel man that by saying basically taxes is his argument.
00:38:57.204 - 00:39:37.308, Speaker A: And like, I have two problems with that. First, the vast majority of people in the world are not America. And secondly, there is tax classifications that, like, you can make an argument for that these assets are property, basically chicken laying an egg is the simple analogy here where if you own a chicken, chicken lays an egg, you're not taxed on the value of the egg until you sell the egg as a farmer. Same, like I hold the same view here, these are assets of property, not income. So yeah, issuance here is misunderstood. And then the last related point, issuance is people look at Solana, they say, oh, it's 80 billion, $100 billion. Market cap inflation is called five or 6%, something like that.
00:39:37.308 - 00:40:07.804, Speaker A: So do some simple math. And they say issuance is five or 6 billion per year. That's like grossly inaccurate representation of like actual selling pressure, so to speak. The reason is like stakers are just taking money away from non stakers. The correct way to think about like the cost of running the network would be to then take total issuance and multiply that by the average validator take rate. Merton, I'm guessing you know what that number is approximately, and I would guess it's roughly five or 6%. Is probably average take rate for validators.
00:40:07.804 - 00:40:25.484, Speaker A: I know a lot y'all are at zero and a bunch of folks are moving towards zero. So that number's coming down. So like, the cost of running the network is. Yeah, is not five or 6 billion. We're talking around one 20th of that number. And quite possibly, and I think that that's going to go down in percentage terms fairly quickly.
00:40:27.104 - 00:40:48.244, Speaker C: The other thing that came up as a result of this is, and we were talking about FTV economic security, right. And totally likes to go on many interesting changes about this. So does everybody I am curious what you think about economic security. And if you think people have gotten it wrong.
00:40:50.404 - 00:41:10.020, Speaker A: Yes, people have gotten wrong. I think both Toli and Drake get it wrong. Again, let's go back to history, is a helpful framing here. The reason people originally talked about economic security, and then let's start with proof of work. Because it's bitcoin. It was the first one, was because 51% attacks. And the risk specifically was reorg.
00:41:10.020 - 00:41:37.334, Speaker A: Right. It turns out that's really overstated in practice. Even if you have a three hour reorg, the only people who really are at risk are exchanges. Like. Yeah. And exchanges need to deal with that in terms of their policy of like, you know, how long do they wait to take an acceptance? But, like, that's why we have this construct. And the problem specifically in bitcoin is, technically, you don't have finality, because a reorg could happen at any time.
00:41:37.334 - 00:42:21.964, Speaker A: And like, look, if someone makes some crazy new ASIC chip, or there's some quantum computer, like, there may very well be one fucking massive reorg. Could be 50 blocks, could be 5000 blocks. Like, who knows? That risk is non zero. It's obviously very close to zero, but it's non zero, because there's no notion of finality. Once you have finality on a blockchain, then the risk of economic security just collapses. Because if you know this transaction is finalized as of call it 5 seconds ago, then it's finalized, and there's no risk that it's going to be reverted. So, like, when I think about economics, like, when I think about like, what is the guarantee a user wants? The guarantee a user wants is this transaction is final.
00:42:21.964 - 00:43:14.644, Speaker A: And that's true for both the sender and actually more importantly for the receiver. The receiver wants to know this transaction is final, because once they know it's final, then, like, they can do what they can credit your account if you're an exchange, or they will give you the coffee if you're Starbucks. And so, the most important variable from a user experience perspective is just latency, or explicitly time to finality. That by far is the most important thing. I think that's just empirically clear when you think about it through that lens. Now then, there's a following question, which is, what are the risks around the transaction coming to finality? But here, again, this is weirdly circular meaning on a Solana, there's an expectation that transactions are finalizing on a rolling basis. Call it every, I don't know, 5 seconds ish.
00:43:14.644 - 00:43:46.778, Speaker A: Like maybe it's two, maybe it's ten, whatever, but it's on the order of a handful of seconds. On Ethereum, the answer is twelve minutes. Consensus tells you guaranteeing the answer is twelve minutes. And so what's interesting is, look, if you're going to attack Solana, assume you've got, whether it's a third of stake or two thirds of stakeholders, I guess it's a third of stake. That way you could, like, disrupt finality. Well, like, everyone in the world, if blocks are not finalizing, then everyone in the world will know that and they will know something is wrong. And so, like, you stop, obviously.
00:43:46.778 - 00:44:17.930, Speaker A: Like, if you're, if you're an exchange, you stop crediting customers accounts because you're like, you know, you're pinging the helios and you're like, hey, man, like, is the money arrived? And you're like, I don't know, maybe, you know, you don't have received two thirds yet. And so, like, I just don't really understand what the attack is for economic security. Now. You could say, well, what's the cost of, you know, getting to a third? And, like, that's a function of market cap and liquidity. I don't really understand the economic motivation, though, for getting there. Like, it just doesn't make sense to me. When.
00:44:17.930 - 00:44:44.224, Speaker A: When all of this, when all of the meat space social systems are under the general assumption that finality happens on a rolling basis every few seconds, when that reality is disrupted, then everyone raises their hands like, hey, what the fuck is going on, guys? Like, something is wrong. And, like, now everyone's on high alerts, you know, and so, like, they stop accepting things as final. So, yeah, I mostly agree. Economic security is a meme, but I think neither Justin nor anatoly captured correctly.
00:44:45.724 - 00:44:55.288, Speaker C: There is something to be said just to maybe steel man a bit more, that you will interrupt liveness. Right? So you will halt the blockchain, and.
00:44:55.296 - 00:45:00.124, Speaker A: If you halt the blockchain, if you have a third of stake, yeah, if you have a third of stake, you can obviously prevent transactions from finalizing.
00:45:01.024 - 00:45:14.284, Speaker C: Yes. And I believe, I mean, I'm not even sure the exact attacks, but, like, the vanak guys, for example, talked about some oracle attacks that you could do and maybe cause some liquidations and stuff. Do you think that's realistic?
00:45:16.424 - 00:46:36.814, Speaker A: Look, these are all possible things for sure. Um, I. Look, I would venture to guess on neither Ethereum nor Solana, any of the derivatives teams or, or liquidation teams have written their logic to account for an extended reorg or an ext or an extended, you know, lack of finality, um, because it's not perceived to be a near term threat. Acquiring a third of stake and having the sophistication and willingness to act on it, and being able to produce a profit on the other end given slash, like, weird exogenous slashing risks and who knows? Whatever other weird compounding things happen. It just seems kind of like, I mean, we have, we have spent a lot of time internally thinking, like, how would we do this? And, like, we can't get there, and it doesn't, it doesn't work. Again, look, I could be wrong, but, like, it's, doing it profitably is basically impossible, not because of, like, the limits of the chain, but because of all of the other social realities around liquidity and economics and exchanges and, like, making all, putting all these pieces together and the sophistication required to pull this off to be pretty extraordinary. Now you can say, well, what about a attacker that's not motivated by profit? So basically, at this point, you're talking explicitly in the world of governments.
00:46:36.814 - 00:47:16.030, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm just not worried about that. Governments don't seem to perceive these things to be a threat. Even like, governments that you might think, like, the chinese government that might be particularly hostile, their view seems to just be, let's just ban our people from owning it. And they're like, okay, you know, America, Europe, whatever, y'all go do whatever you're gonna do. They certainly don't view these systems, at least not today, as a threat to their sovereignty, and that may change in the future. And, like, you know, I do think these systems need to get hardened over time, but it's just not something I think is relevant today right now. The thing that's relevant is, like, make the systems more usable and have more stuff happening.
00:47:16.030 - 00:47:54.012, Speaker A: And by the way, all of these systems are hardening over time. This actually leads to a very important point, which is the ethereum. People always tend to say if there are centralization vectors in, like, how consensus is designed, or the block producers, or, you know, like, people negotiating things off chain. Like, there's these concerns that, like, the system is centralizing naturally. And I think we have empirical proof that, like, that doesn't matter because, like, Solana from inception was fudded for centralizing. Blocks are too, you know, block producers are too big. Oh, jump is going to run the whole thing, and Alameda is going to run the whole thing.
00:47:54.012 - 00:48:44.284, Speaker A: Like, this has been, like, the critiques of it from day one. And what we've seen over time is that this has been true for the three largest chains, bitcoin, ethereum, and Solana, is that as the chain grows in market cap, everything decentralizes the user base, decentralizes the validators, decentralized the number of clients, decentralizes the political control over the system, decentralizes. Remember bitcoin in the early days? Dude, there were some hard forks and shit at one point. There were a couple of reorgan stuff. Ethereum obviously had the dao fork, whatever, whatever. So all of these systems decentralized on basically every metric over time. The only caveat I'll put is centralized sequencers on Ethereum, but we don't need to go down that rabbit hole right now.
00:48:44.284 - 00:49:18.074, Speaker A: But they just do. And why is that true? It's not magically true. It's true for the very obvious empirical reason of as market cap goes up, that means more people care, and that means more people are doing stuff, and different people show up and do different things because they have different skill sets and different interests. And so, like, these systems decentralized just organically. And so I just find like that kind of entire class of logic to just be silly. It just doesn't meet the like, way the world works test.
00:49:19.494 - 00:50:01.676, Speaker C: So the reason I asked about economic security is to segue into this next question from one of your tweets. And the tweet is multicoin is likely the largest holder in the world of tokens that could be eligible to be abs's in the world. And then you list a bunch of names, and then you say, I've never heard anybody say, Kyle, I think one of the primary things limiting our growth is the amount of quality of liquidity backing the crypto economic security of our system. Not once. So it seems you are maybe not so favorable. Restaking is that. Would that be like, what are your overall thoughts on what's been happening on Ethereum? And then, furthermore, you're also an investor in Jito.
00:50:01.676 - 00:50:03.584, Speaker C: How do you think it maps to Solana?
00:50:05.924 - 00:51:00.464, Speaker A: I have my first call with Sriram when he's raising the seed round, I don't know, two, two and a half years ago. I told him, I don't believe you're solving a problem. I, to this day, believe restaking is not solving a problem. Furthermore, I believe that all of the discourse around retaking dramatically fails to capture the intangible costs or immeasurable costs, which are social in nature and are quite substantial. I have a joke that I've shared on publicly a few times, which is that the goal of a blockchain or the goal of any of these systems is to minimize social coordination as you scale. And my biggest, my biggest fundamental problem with avss is they just increase social complexity. And the more people who use avss, the more the like you have like compounding effects of social complexity.
00:51:00.464 - 00:51:16.264, Speaker A: And so I really much hate that. So yeah, I don't like it. No interest in it. You know, today, judo is not a restaking system. There's been lots of discourse that judo will do restaking. Great. If they do, I don't particularly care.
00:51:16.264 - 00:51:27.864, Speaker A: We still own our juno tokens because they do the mev stuff and they have the best liquid staking token for it. Beyond that, I don't care.
00:51:31.284 - 00:51:54.944, Speaker B: Yeah, no, that's a fair point. And I like your comment there about complexity. If we look at using some native stake, using native stake, I think there are some interesting things you can be, you can do, such as giving preconfirmations to base rolls, trying to use Ethereum as their sequencer. That's an interesting way to decentralize a sequencer, given the, you pointed out earlier, like having a single centralized sequencer is a problem.
00:51:55.404 - 00:52:07.060, Speaker A: The correct solution to that problem is not that, it's Solana, 100% agree. You're just reinventing the wheels problems and you're like, ah, with all these restaking we can like, it's just like, no, man, like, this is too fucking complicated.
00:52:07.252 - 00:52:36.866, Speaker B: It's going through this massive at lift of additional complexity to avoid shortening block times. Right? That is literally what's happening. Which makes me wonder. I mean, the core ethos that sits at the heart of Ethereum is prioritizing the solo staker in the name of increased decentralization. And like that decision or that mindset has driven the entire design decisions. I'm not saying that's good or bad, that's just an observation. Whereas Solana has taken a different angle and these other high throughput systems as well.
00:52:36.866 - 00:53:01.494, Speaker B: The question is, like, where on that trade off spectrum do you start with like, hey, on day one we're going to have a more centralized system that will scale into decentralization for me, I guess. Like what, at what barrier can you define sufficient decentralization? Is that like a node count thing, geographic distribution, client count? Like, what kind of qualities do you look for to have to be like, okay, this system is sufficiently decentralized.
00:53:02.744 - 00:53:39.892, Speaker A: Um, Balaji wrote probably like the right blog post on this, um, in 2017, um, calling like, how do we measure decentralization? Or something like that. He has, I think, six measures, if I recall correctly, and they're like, node count number of client implementations. I don't even think he has Nakamoto coefficient or block producers in there. Maybe he does. Um, I forget the other variables he even includes, but, like, there's a few things you can look at. Um, I don't think there is a right answer. Could you construct some sort of, like, polynomial, like, six variable curve here? Like, yeah, I think it theoretically is possible.
00:53:39.892 - 00:54:29.406, Speaker A: And I think that, like, you know, I think today, normal people, most normal people look at Solana and they say, like, it seems sufficiently decentralized. I think that is the view that most people in the market view of Solana today. You can gripe about fire dancers not here yet and stuff, but I think that's generally accepted view. Ethereum, I think, is accepted on that view as well. Interestingly, bitcoin only really has one client that matters, and has also accepted that bitcoin is even more decentralized than Ethereum, which is an interesting thing. You wouldn't have expected that, given how much Ethereum prioritizes client diversity. So I don't have an answer for you other than to say there is some sort of six figure polynomial curve here that you could do to add up to some minimum threshold number.
00:54:29.406 - 00:54:56.164, Speaker A: No one is ever going to define that with any mathematical precision because it's unnecessary. I do think kind of intuitively, everyone is roughly doing that math and adding it up to see if it crosses some threshold. Again, this isn't literally happening with a calculator, but it just is clear when you get there. So it's not a good answer to your question, other than you know it when you see it.
00:54:56.744 - 00:55:10.244, Speaker C: Okay, final question for me, going to shift gears. You're obviously an investor. You've seen a lot of people build things. What is something you noticed, uniquely, that crypto founders get wrong?
00:55:17.764 - 00:56:11.006, Speaker A: I joke that every disagreement we've ever had internally is a function of differing time horizons. And I think this maps into crypto, specifically what founders choose to work on in a very weird way, which is like, things get hot, and then the founders choose to commit their lives working on it. And that's like, fundamentally a misunderstanding of how to think about strategy and time. By the time something is hot, and it's like being discussed, if you aren't already, haven't been building there, like, then you are by definition, at a disadvantage because it's becoming hot, because other people have been building there. And, like, that really bothers me, you know? Now look, it's okay to be late to the party if you then if you have some unique insight. And you're like, no, no, look, ZK is cool. It's all the other people are wrong.
00:56:11.006 - 00:56:42.082, Speaker A: For this reason, I figured out some new math circuit is really, is like a breakthrough. It's really 50 x better if you're that guy, like, awesome, you know, great. In fact, I would argue Anatoly roughly meets that characterization. Anatoly was not early to crypto. He only observed it because he's like, what's this ethereum thing? What are these icos? And I know, okay, like, I can make it better. He like, wasn't a crypto ideologue, right? But he was very clear about why it was substantially better. And I don't know, I'll highlight account abstraction of.
00:56:42.082 - 00:57:06.174, Speaker A: There was this wave twelve months ago where some EiP was passed or whatever. That was like, oh, account abstraction is here. And there were like 20 startups that raised money to build account abstraction. I was like, guys, what are you all doing? So, yeah, once a sector is being talked about, you should not start a company in that sector unless you really are very clear about why your views are different.
00:57:06.954 - 00:57:38.954, Speaker B: Well, I can't help but bring up roll ups and l two s here, because from a valuation angle, we see a lot of comparative valuation in this industry. And I think that's largely because historically, fundamentals have not driven any type of valuation. And we're seeing l two after l two launch at hundreds of million fdv. We've seen like, failed defi product projects kind of make this pivot and be like, hey, we're launching as an app chain for all these benefits, and then they get this, like, valuation boost. How do you think about that?
00:57:40.574 - 00:57:44.046, Speaker A: Market can be irrational longer than you can stay solvent. Don't short.
00:57:44.150 - 00:57:48.674, Speaker B: Is that just a product of being a nascent market as still a young market?
00:57:49.374 - 00:58:32.048, Speaker A: I think that's part of it, actually. Here, I'll make the flip side, which is, I mean, we are not expressing this trade at all, but my intellectual belief is that l two s are dramatically undervalued and l one ethereum is dramatically overvalued because I believe all the value comes from the MEV. Ethereum is explicitly foregoing the MEV and giving it to the l two s. And they're like, yeah, but we provide economic security. And I'm like, dude, economic security is nonsense. And like, I mean, look at, look at arbitrum. Like, they're the most active l two dow, they just approved a $250 million gaming fund, which is like the most egregious capital allocation decision I've seen in the history of crypto.
00:58:32.048 - 00:58:42.204, Speaker A: Yes. And, like, especially given the evidence we have over the prior three years, like, leading up to this moment in time, it's just, like, so fucking atrocious.
00:58:42.804 - 00:58:47.636, Speaker B: And I think $10 billion has gone into gaming, and we don't have a single game.
00:58:47.700 - 00:58:57.804, Speaker A: Sorry. Yeah, there's. There's just, like, there's just clearly nothing to show for it. And. And obviously, like, the decision to make a fund to invest is not based on some unique insight. Right. Um, and.
00:58:57.804 - 00:59:32.958, Speaker A: And so. But my bigger takeaway from that is the token holders of our arbitrum are, like, they live in a different fucking universe, and, like, they can be convinced of anything. And so, like, I expect there will be an activist campaign at some point that whether it's in three months or in four years, I don't know. And someone's going to be like, guys, why are we paying Etherium? This thing is nonsense. Like, it fucking finalizes in twelve minutes. We have a new system that finalizes in 4 seconds. Like, you know, like, fork Celestia in two years and, like, make it our own.
00:59:32.958 - 01:00:03.814, Speaker A: And, I don't know, some weird thing like that is going to happen. It's gonna go through governance, and, like, one of these things is gonna pass. I'm not saying it's gonna be the first one, but it just seems inevitable to me, given what we have seen of specifically this token holder community. Like, because, like, the guys who are arguing to do it are gonna say, what the fuck is Ethereum providing for us? Like, you know, we're just paying these guys all, look at all this money we're paying them, and you can see the political campaign already 100%.
01:00:03.894 - 01:00:33.726, Speaker B: It's funny you bring that up. Something I'm starting to get louder about is just the idea that tokens sitting in a Dow treasury are not real. They do not exist. They have yet to be issued. And that mental conception of people viewing the Dow treasury as being well capitalized or a bucket of real dollars is entirely false. For the first time, I think we saw a meaningful change in a very small change with Zk sync. So they're not minting the tokens into an address.
01:00:33.726 - 01:00:57.754, Speaker B: They're being held unminted, which is a very, very, very small change. But I think that has a massive impact on the token holder psyche of like, oh, no, we have to actually mint these tokens into circulation if we want to go pay for employment or fund some initiative, no matter how silly it may be. That's very small change, I think, actually is going to play a pretty massive impact on how these daos are run.
01:01:00.134 - 01:01:11.838, Speaker A: I agree. I don't appreciate exactly what behaviors are changing and, like, what defaults are changing, but obviously some defaults are changing and that will impact net capital allocation decisions.
01:01:11.886 - 01:01:15.474, Speaker C: Okay, final question. Solana, Altus, thoughts?
01:01:17.494 - 01:01:40.684, Speaker A: They will launch. Don't think they're gonna have a lot happening. I'll add one clarifying point. The term l two. The term. Look, there's a bunch of research people who argue about semantics of bridges and what's an l two? And stuff. I think as users perceive l two s.
01:01:40.684 - 01:02:27.756, Speaker A: L two s are functionally equivalent on Ethereum to the l one because you have the same contracts deployed and you have the same assets, and you even use the same metrics like TVL and trading volume and stuff to talk about them. Right. So l two means l one, but kind of sort of cheaper and faster. That's what normal users perceive. And that is like the Ethereum definition of l two. There are certain teams, like eclipse and movement labs and others that are, I'd say, like, bringing the same concept to Solana, and they are calling themselves l two s because they, like, generally speaking, you know, meet that same definition. Right.
01:02:27.756 - 01:03:07.404, Speaker A: Like, as far as normal users are concerned, I think the more interesting opportunity for Solana, l two s, is doing things that Solana, l one cannot do. And so I think of these as, like, ways to extend Solana in certain ways. So I wouldn't call them l two s, but I think, like, what drift is working on, what Zeta is working on, what grass is working on. There's probably some other teams I don't know about. They're all building systems that, like, they do live on top of Solana in some way, but they are not l two s in the way. That arbitrary optimism are l two s. And I think those are quite interesting.
01:03:07.404 - 01:03:13.560, Speaker A: And I think designing, yeah. These novel systems that extend the functionality of Solana will be. Will be pretty powerful.
01:03:13.672 - 01:03:18.484, Speaker B: Kyle, fantastic episode, man. Thank you so much for coming on. Anything you want to leave the audience with?
01:03:19.024 - 01:03:30.244, Speaker A: No, guys look super fun. Glad to be back on the show, Dan, thanks for having me, Mert. Appreciate you being here. Good to see you. By the way, a couple weeks ago in Austin, hopefully you move here. It seems like you're excited to get out of Canada. So hopefully come down to Austin.
01:03:31.504 - 01:03:32.520, Speaker C: Yes, sir.
01:03:32.712 - 01:03:34.556, Speaker B: Awesome. Cheers, everyone. Thank you.
01:03:34.720 - 01:03:35.124, Speaker A: Thanks, guys.
