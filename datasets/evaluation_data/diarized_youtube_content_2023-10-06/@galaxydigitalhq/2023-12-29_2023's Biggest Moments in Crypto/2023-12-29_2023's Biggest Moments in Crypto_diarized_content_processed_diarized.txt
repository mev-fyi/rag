00:00:00.160 - 00:00:05.870, Speaker A: What were some of the big moments in your mind in the sort of crypto market this year? So like just this.
00:00:05.902 - 00:00:50.404, Speaker B: Year, I would say Larry Fink being orange pilled, right? You see old videos of him from five, six years ago where he was a bitcoin skeptic and he's now saying it's going to be part of everyone's portfolio. And Blackrock's the largest asset manager, Invesco Galaxy. We're going to try to knock them off the ETF pedestal or at least be a good battler competitor in that space. And I think that's important because you're going to have 910 maybe firms trying to build ETF products. That's 910 sales forces going out and telling the bitcoin story. And after that they'll tell the Ethereum story and probably the Solana story. And so we're going to bring institutional capital into a space which has been dominated by retail.
00:00:50.404 - 00:00:52.984, Speaker B: So that's exciting. I would say that was one.
