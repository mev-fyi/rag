00:00:03.210 - 00:00:22.702, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Digital Research. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital, and I am joined this week by Christine Kim, Saul Kadir and Charles Yu from Galaxy Digital Research. Hey, everyone.
00:00:22.836 - 00:00:23.470, Speaker B: Hello.
00:00:23.620 - 00:00:24.286, Speaker C: Good morning.
00:00:24.388 - 00:00:25.494, Speaker D: How's it going on?
00:00:25.612 - 00:01:01.710, Speaker A: And I'm also joined by Bimnet, a BB, as we are each week to talk markets. And this week we're going to talk about Luna and UST, we're going to talk about Instagram adding NFT integration, and we're going to talk about Lido, the liquid staking protocol for ethereum's beacon chain. But first, BIMnet, let's turn to you. It looks like everything in markets is down this week. It's been rough since the FOMC, since Wednesday of last week when we had a little bit of a rally after the FOMC, but it's been now we're, I guess we're on the fifth down day here and tell us what's happening and what are you seeing out there?
00:01:01.860 - 00:02:02.498, Speaker E: Yeah, so what we've been seeing this year is the market sort of coming to grips with the state of inflation and the Fed's response function to inflation. And so last know, the Fed told you that they were going to take aggressive measures to prevent inflation by raising rates by running off their balance sheet. And today you got data that is going to support pretty aggressive tightening of financial conditions. Today we had CPI come in at 8.3% versus expectations of 8.1. So you're still at inflation levels that you haven't seen for 40 to 50 years, and they're continuing to come in above expectations. And so while inflation may have dipped due to certain base effects, it's pretty clear that inflation is pretty broad based.
00:02:02.498 - 00:02:44.574, Speaker E: You're seeing massive pickup in prices from everything from housing to airfares to dining out, and that it's likely going to be fairly persistent. And so the market is interpreting that as meaning the Fed's going to have a pretty aggressive response to this. And so odds are stocks are going to sell off. Right. And inflation is important for a number of reasons. But I want to highlight just one simple one, which is just margin compression, right. When you are a company and you have to pass through increases in labor costs and increases in the cost of goods to end consumers, it is most likely going to lead to margin compression.
00:02:44.574 - 00:03:51.222, Speaker E: You cannot pass on 40% increase in prices to consumers. And so that's what you're really seeing in a lot of us, equities in addition, the era of free money is over and valuations matter. And so things like expensive software companies, stuff that has traded at insanely high valuations, is now starting to normalize and to put some numbers behind it. These moves have been dramatic, to say the least. But since last Wednesday's podcast, high to low, the Nasdaq has moved lower by 11% and it's still going. And you've had technical breaks on the S and P, you're through 4000, and you've had big weekly breaks like last Friday's close was pretty indicative that you were going to get some follow through and just high level. Pretty much every big technical level this year that has gotten taken out on currencies, bonds, equities, has seen pretty material follow through.
00:03:51.222 - 00:04:09.302, Speaker E: And so this time is no different. We think that stocks likely continue to sort of move lower as the street sort of decreases earnings forecast for most companies. And I think that's going to be a headwind for crypto.
00:04:09.446 - 00:04:24.306, Speaker A: What do you think? I've been thinking about this a lot, and this isn't really a novel opinion, but you've got the fastest and largest money printing in history in spring of 2020. You've got now some of the most aggressive tightening that we've ever seen.
00:04:24.408 - 00:04:24.818, Speaker E: Absolutely.
00:04:24.904 - 00:05:01.514, Speaker A: I keep calling this a whipsaw monetary policy. Are we down or is this just really a reversion to the mean? Just opining here. What if we hadn't injected all that liquidity? I know everyone was terrified. We had lockdowns, but my view is like, the vaccines were going to come, the reopening would have happened. People were going to eventually get or not get Covid one way or another. Is that a prudent policy? It seems near universally accepted that it was a good thing to print all that money in response to Covid. But now taking that money away, right.
00:05:01.514 - 00:05:10.350, Speaker A: And it feels like a lot of pain and it's like, is this really just a mean reversion? Was the last two years of run up basically fake?
00:05:10.770 - 00:05:59.498, Speaker E: There's a lot to unpack in that question, and it's a great one. And so I just want to remind you of sort of what the world looked like in the spring of 2020 when Covid was happening. You had 20 million increase in unemployment. Right. People could not work from, they needed unemployment benefits, they needed stimulus checks, et cetera. And you were living in an era where you had somewhat tight financial conditions and interest rates were positive, et cetera, but inflation never really got out of hand. You were in a period where for I want to say at least five, six years, the Fed was consistently forecasting inflation that was higher than where it realized we were consistently below 2% inflation.
00:05:59.498 - 00:06:54.682, Speaker E: And the Fed was actually in the process of hiking rates. And so never did these central bankers think that you'd be printing 8%, eight and a half percent on inflation when they started to inject all the liquidity in the market. And then the other thing to keep in mind, the liquidity that the US and the Fed injected not only helped domestic policy, but also foreign policy, really, there was a massive scarcity of dollars. And if the US didn't step in in the way that it did, it would have harmed the rest of the world much more. And so with that, I think the most important thing to focus on, though, is forecasting is imperfect. People have been bad at predicting inflation for decades. Nobody is good at it, whether it's to the upside or to the downside.
00:06:54.682 - 00:08:20.154, Speaker E: I don't care if you have a gazillion phds, right? There's too many variables. And so with the information that people had back then, they did their best and now they're a little bit slow to react, and that's the main issue. But to your point, is this just mean reversion? And yes, it is. There's been a lot of excess wealth that's been created, a lot of froth in the market that needs to sort of get taken away. And I'm a chart guy, and so high level, the uptrend in us stocks that's gone on for the better part of half a century is still in place, right? Your average baby boomer that's retiring is still sitting on tremendous compounded gains over time. And so, yes, this is mean reversion, but it's different in the sense that it could be mean reversion in a stagflation scenario where you never really get out of this inflation because the inflation genius popped, right? Everybody's going to want to buy goods aggressively because you think they're going to go up 10% next week, right? And it starts to spiral like people start leaving their jobs because they have a family of four and everything costs 15% and more. And so if you hate your job, if you like your job, you're still probably going to move on if you're not getting a raise to keep up with that stuff.
00:08:20.154 - 00:08:39.650, Speaker E: So the question is, is that inflation genie out the bottle? And it's tricky because you have things like the Ukraine crisis, the China slowdown, all of these things that have historically been very tough to sort of forecast happening. So it's a very complicated equation right now.
00:08:39.800 - 00:08:54.470, Speaker A: It is tricky, but it's incredible how important monetary policy is in macro and in general, just investing in general these days. And I don't think that that's the role that the fed wants to be playing, but it is the one they find themselves in, right?
00:08:54.540 - 00:08:55.110, Speaker E: Absolutely.
00:08:55.260 - 00:09:39.878, Speaker A: Okay, this was great, Bimnet, thank you so much, as always. Okay, next we're going to talk about Luna and UsT. That's terra USD, the stablecoin in the luna ecosystem. USt lost its peg over the weekend and despite some efforts to support it, it fell at one point as far, I think, in like the 20 cent range when it's supposed to be a dollar. As a consequence, confidence in the luna ecosystems declined significantly. So the Luna token itself, which is the native digital asset for the terra blockchain itself and which is involved in the mint and burn process for UST, also down huge. I mean, I think when I looked, we're recording this on Wednesday, it was trading under a dollar, and that's down from its all time high of over $110.
00:09:39.878 - 00:09:57.142, Speaker A: So down massive losses in Luna as well. We've got. Charles, you here from the research team at Galaxy to talk to us about it? You've been following Luna for a while, Chuck. First, maybe just tell us briefly about Luna and the terra blockchain and then let's talk about UST.
00:09:57.286 - 00:10:39.622, Speaker C: Yeah. So a high level terra is a tendermint based proof of stake blockchain built on the Cosmos SDK and its governance token. Luna is used to absorb some of the short term liquidity and it's tied to UST. So through its market module, users can mint and burn Luna or UST, always at a dollar to one ratio, which really incentivizes arbitragers to step in and mint and burn Luna for UST whenever it deviates from its peg. So it's not explicitly collateralized, but Luna is just used to absorb some of the short term volatility.
00:10:39.766 - 00:11:05.262, Speaker A: So when you create UST, you burn Luna. Correct, correct. So over the last year and a half, I'm looking at the beginning of 2021, there was looks like less than a billion circulating of UST. Today it's over 18 billion. So that has corresponded those creations of UST with the destruction of Luna supply.
00:11:05.406 - 00:11:06.100, Speaker C: Correct.
00:11:06.950 - 00:11:50.474, Speaker A: But then the reverse happens. When you want to redeem terra, you mint new Luna tokens. And so I think you wrote about this in our newsletter a couple of weeks ago. This mechanism in general can work really well when asset prices are stable or rising. But in the case of a large move to redeem UST, that also puts significant pressure on Luna because it causes Luna's supply to increase. And that, that's sort of one of the ways the death spiral, quote, unquote, that's been talked a lot about with algorithmic stablecoins specifically, can manifest. So I think if we put it in context too, right, you've got several types of stablecoins.
00:11:50.474 - 00:13:07.334, Speaker A: I typically think of USDC, USDT as tokens that are ious to an off chain issuer, right? A centralized off chain issuer. And those issuers, be it circle or tether, they hold collateral in order to, upon which they issue these ious, right? And it could be all dollars, it could be some combination of securities and dollars and cryptos, right? There are variations in how these various centralized stablecoins collateralize themselves. Then you've got debt based stablecoins like Makerdao and Dai, which are typically over collateralized with crypto assets. Although it's worth noting, Maker die has a lot of USDC in there as collateral as well. And interestingly, right, Maker came under, had a lot of trouble on March twelveth 2020, not so much because of maker's design, but more because of congestion in the Ethereum network that day. People weren't able to get in and top up their margin positions, and oracle messages weren't properly getting on chain to Makerdao, causing a lot of cascading liquidations there. But what we've seen over the last couple of days is a bit different, right? I mean, this stablecoin, UST is really hard to.
00:13:07.334 - 00:13:39.458, Speaker A: There's not nearly as much backing it like a debt based stablecoin. When we say algorithmic, we sort of really mean programmatic. Right? And while there is a mechanism here to create and redeem Luna, it's not like a pile of Luna is sitting in a vault, right? And even if it were, that's only one asset. So this dynamic. But why don't you run us through, chuck, like, to the best of our knowledge, what actually happened to start this decline and de pegging of UST, and then we'll take it from there.
00:13:39.544 - 00:14:36.734, Speaker C: Sure. Yeah. So over the weekend, anchor, which is Terra's most popular savings and lending protocol, saw major outflows and UST deposits, which was largely started by a single wallet address on Saturday. And after withdrawing a large amount of UST on anchor, this entity then bridged it to Ethereum and swapped it for other stables on curve, which is one of the main UST liquidity sources on Ethereum. And so this led to a big supply imbalance with UST making up most of the liquidity pool on there and leaving less, quote unquote exit liquidity for others to swap their USt to. This was seemingly a deliberate and coordinated attack on UST. Prior to this, there was a large entity who borrowed $3 billion of bitcoin and sold their position to trigger some market panic.
00:14:36.734 - 00:14:59.046, Speaker C: And this was enough to cause the initial depgging, which on Saturday was just at $0.98 on the dollar across several exchanges. But really this created this negative feedback loop as market conditions were already bad, price of Luna was rapidly falling, and it really just convinced a lot of others to exit their US two positions.
00:14:59.158 - 00:15:32.386, Speaker A: Okay, so this all started happening during, over the weekend, and crypto markets were getting battered. And this followed down equity days on Thursday and Friday of last week. And then Monday, we know, was also a pretty red day. So that negative sentiment in markets, again, even outside crypto, persisted throughout the weekend. But yet crypto is the only thing you could trade. So anyway, Chuck, what did the Luna foundation guard and the Terra team, or whomever, what did they do to try to mitigate and stem the pain coming from this dpeg over the weekend?
00:15:32.498 - 00:16:28.962, Speaker C: Yeah, so I guess when they saw some of these supply imbalances in the liquidity pools on the external exchanges, and I say external meaning curve, potentially uniswap or even binance, these are basically just exchanges that are off of terra, where the on chain market module isn't available. So they helped contribute liquidity into some of these pools to rebalance things. But they found that after each capital injection, the exits were pretty persistent. The peg hadn't been restored, and it really showed no signs of slowing. So to give you an idea, anchor deposits were over, I think, 14 billion prior to the weekend, and we were seeing outflows of several billion dollars over the past couple of days, and it now stands at $3 billion. So that's over $10 billion of outflows.
00:16:29.106 - 00:16:55.026, Speaker A: Wow. So a lot of demand to get out of UST. The Luna foundation guard, they had raised a bunch of capital and held it in bitcoin. Right. We've talked about this on the podcast. They had bought a lot of bitcoin with the idea that it would add to the sort of collateralization defense mechanism for protecting the UST peg. It was intended, my recollection, that it would be a redemption option.
00:16:55.026 - 00:17:28.858, Speaker A: If you didn't want to mint Luna, you could actually take redemption in bitcoin at a slight haircut. Right. But actually, over the weekend, and maybe this was Sunday night, if I'm recalling Sunday and Monday, we started to see Luna foundation guard sending that bitcoin, it looks like, to an exchange in some kind of effort. Either they were going to provide it to market makers, maybe through an exchange, or even just buying UST with it, aka selling the bitcoin for UST to help defend that peg. That also didn't work. Right?
00:17:29.024 - 00:18:02.102, Speaker C: Yeah, it was not successful. Kind of viewed the use of the bitcoin reserves as a secondary option after these initial capital injections weren't effective in restoring the peg. So the LFG council actually voted to loan out $1.5 billion to OTC trading desks and market makers to actively manage their reserves. But they were forced to sell some of it in defense of the peg, which was basically what the attacking entity had planned for their short position.
00:18:02.236 - 00:18:23.358, Speaker A: Now, we don't know a lot about this attacking entity, but we do know that those initial withdrawals from anchor went to one wallet. Right. We do know there's a lot of speculation in the market that this was a very coordinated attack and trade around this, but we don't know who that was, if there even was someone. But there's tons of rumors online.
00:18:23.444 - 00:18:24.080, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:18:24.530 - 00:18:33.630, Speaker A: This was not a gradual loss of confidence in UST. Right. This was sparked by that. We can see that on chain.
00:18:33.710 - 00:18:45.118, Speaker C: Yeah. What we do know is that one single wallet address had quickly accumulated up to a billion dollars of UST deposits on anchor, and then withdrew them immediately.
00:18:45.214 - 00:19:16.334, Speaker A: And then we also saw the imbalancing of the curve pool, which further, shortly thereafter, which I don't know about, tracking coins as they move through bridges. That's probably pretty difficult, but very likely the same entity. Okay. And then know the story is still developing. But I mentioned this confidence in Luna is down significantly in general. I mean, the coin itself is down a lot. And we also have, I think confidence in algo stables is down a lot.
00:19:16.334 - 00:19:19.758, Speaker A: And we'll talk about that in a sec. What's up, Christine? Love to have you chime in here.
00:19:19.844 - 00:19:48.118, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess. What do we think about what this means to use bitcoin as pristine collateral? The fact that Luna foundation guard did try and use its massive reserves of bitcoin to restabilize the price. Does it make us doubt in the ability of bitcoin to act as that idea of it being like a digital gold reserve?
00:19:48.214 - 00:20:44.534, Speaker A: No, definitely not. I think the last thing that people have doubt about in this situation is bitcoin. The issue here, bitcoin is pristine collateral because it's highly auditable, highly secure, global liquid. Right. The reason it wasn't able to defend the peg has nothing to do with bitcoin and everything to do with the lack of confidence in Terra and just the simple lack of demand to buy and hold Terra, right. I mean, every one of those attempts to recover, if you look at the chart on, right, significant rush to exit UST, and they have a lot of bitcoin, but apparently not enough to defend that low level of confidence. I think the story where it gets, and to be clear, we don't know how much bitcoin has actually been sold to defend this peg.
00:20:44.534 - 00:21:46.842, Speaker A: I think we can see some bitcoin moving into where we think is a centralized exchange, which, by the way, market makers are on many exchanges. So even though it maybe lands at one, it can sort of then be on the market maker's balance sheet and be traded elsewhere. But centralized exchanges are kind of a black hole when it comes to on chain forensics, because once assets land there, typically what happens, happens off chain, right on their order books or whatever else. So it gets very difficult. I think one of the big takeaways here is algorithmic stablecoins. Can they ever work? And I've been, in general, a pretty big critic of these now, I don't even know if it's fair to actually say that terra, it was an algorithmic stablecoin. I mean, in the end, it know, backed by bitcoin, it had sort of active defenders on its side that basically undertook open market operations to try to defend the peg.
00:21:46.842 - 00:22:22.378, Speaker A: So that's not purely algorithmic, not like something like ampleforth was, or like what basis wanted to be. But this does feel like the sort of holy grail in sort of stable money that not only in this crypto era, but for thousands of years, people would want to engineer something that could just algorithmically, aka magically maintain its value. And we've never found that. And the holy grail itself was never found, as far as I'm aware. So it might end up still being that thing people strive for.
00:22:22.464 - 00:22:56.066, Speaker B: It did sound like Doe Kwan, who founded Terra, ultimately kind of agreed that this algorithmic stablecoin stuff won't work, and that UST, if it survives, will transition over to a collateralized stablecoin. Chuck, curious to know how you interpreted that statement from Dokwon on Twitter when he said that looking ahead to UST's future roadmap, that the team would be looking into collateralized options.
00:22:56.248 - 00:24:04.710, Speaker C: Yeah, first of all, I think. One thing I just wanted to point out, but I think an important distinction to make here is just around the term decentralized. The whole reason that Terra really blew up over the past couple of months was because we're seeing the protests in Canada with the freedom convoy, with the truckers, and now this Ukraine war. People need a form of seizure proof, censorship resistant currency so decentralized in that sense that it cannot actually be seized. And that's different than actively managing the role of your coin in open market operations or things like that, which are some of the typical criticisms that I see being thrown against Terra. Now, with that being said, I think the main problem that has really been illustrated here in this incident is how Terra is actually backed by faith in the coin and by demand in Luna. But this kind of falls along the same lines of actually fiat backed stable coins.
00:24:04.710 - 00:24:40.198, Speaker C: So your USDT tether, all it really takes is one FUd campaign, or anyone to spark a rumor, spark concerns in token holders to really sell off the tokens. And tether will never know what their reserves actually are, whether or not they can immediately meet all the redemptions of its holders. But still, even today, we saw tether trading off of its peg by a couple of basis points just on some news, like. So.
00:24:40.284 - 00:24:52.694, Speaker A: Yeah, actually, I think all the stable coins basically today were trading slightly below their peg. None of them, obviously, at the level of UST, but I think confidence is kind of shaken.
00:24:52.742 - 00:24:52.906, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:24:52.928 - 00:25:30.514, Speaker D: So two quick comments here to Chuck's point about the lack of demand for Terra. I think we've seen the writing on the wall for this for a while now. If you look at DeFi llama, for instance, TVL, Terra's anchor dominance, which just measures like the top protocol, how much TVL is affiliated with it. For Terra, it was 70% for anchor. And if you look at the other two main competitors, avalanche, it's only around 16% for Ave. And then Salana is about 12% for Soland, at least today. So what that shows you is that the demand for the coin is incredibly tied to just one protocol.
00:25:30.514 - 00:26:07.730, Speaker D: So if that domino falls, it could have massive, massive implications to a degree that's not necessarily true for other competing l ones. And the other small point I'll make with regards to algorithmic stable coins, I think the dream isn't dead. I just think this whole industry needs to mature by a couple of orders of magnitude, because at the end of the day, it didn't really take that much capital to cause this domino to fall. A billion dollars in the ballpark. Of that. But if this industry starts increasing by a factor of ten or 100, that becomes a lot harder. So just two quick comments there that I thought.
00:26:07.800 - 00:26:36.074, Speaker A: Yeah, good comments, Saul. Okay. And before we wrap up, Luna, let's talk about regulation and regulatory tension. Obviously, the US government and other entities have been really focused on stable coins, partly because they're concerned about some of the size of the reserves that back them. And in theory, what kind of collateral damage might be caused by particularly something like tether having to sell reserves to meet redemption demand. U. S.
00:26:36.074 - 00:26:43.226, Speaker A: Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen spoke about Terra and this before Congress yesterday on Tuesday. Let's roll that clip.
00:26:43.418 - 00:27:17.870, Speaker F: I would note that there was a report just this morning in the Wall Street Journal that a stable coin known as Terra USD experienced a run and had declined in. So I think that simply illustrates that this is a rapidly growing product and that there are risks to financial stability, and we need a framework that's appropriate.
00:27:18.050 - 00:27:47.426, Speaker A: So it does seem like there will be additional scrutiny, even just from this ust incident. And I don't know, it's really not clear at all yet where policymakers land on how and which and when to regulate stablecoins. But definitely one of the second order effects of this fallout is going to be it's certainly more fodder for regulators that are concerned about this part of the space.
00:27:47.528 - 00:28:15.478, Speaker B: And one other thing to watch out in terms of regulatory attention is how regulation around cryptocurrencies in Korea might change as well with the new election of south korean president, who ran on a platform where he was much more pro crypto than the former president. And it'll be interesting to see whether or not his stance changes or shifts somehow because of this incident.
00:28:15.654 - 00:28:15.946, Speaker E: Right.
00:28:15.968 - 00:28:29.774, Speaker A: Because Tara is based in South Korea. Right. And was big in the ecosystem there. Yeah. Okay. Well, this is a developing story, so probably more to come on it. But thanks, Chuck, for helping us unpack some of it.
00:28:29.774 - 00:28:59.658, Speaker A: And we'll read our newsletter, which is out Friday, today as you're listening to this. We'll have more content on this there. All right, let's move on. Let's talk about Instagram. This is a little lighter, think. But Instagram, the property owned by Meta, formerly known Facebook, the social media application, they're going to add integration for nfts directly into their platform, and soon. Saul, can you give us the rundown on this?
00:28:59.744 - 00:29:50.438, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely. So this was teased by Zuckerberg himself at SXSW a few weeks ago. And then on Monday, Adam Messari, who heads Instagram, announced that the platform will be testing nfts with select creators. As of right now it's happening and right off the gate it'll support Ethereum and Polygon when this launches for the public. Eventually Solana and the flow blockchain will be supported as well. In terms of wallets, it's going to support rainbow Metamask, trust wallet at launch, and then coinbase, dapper and phantom wallets will eventually be supported. And the idea here is you as a user can share nfts you either purchased or created in your main Instagram feed, in stories or in messages, which is an interesting departure from Twitter, which focuses entirely on displaying your nfts through pfps, profile pictures.
00:29:50.438 - 00:30:36.040, Speaker D: So different use case here. And the quote that Adam said, which was also interesting, was he acknowledges upfront that nfts and blockchain technologies are all about distributing trust and power, and Instagram is fundamentally centralized and there's attention there. And so there is a recognition on his part that they need to create this product in such a way that kind of balances both of these halves. And I think the long term vision with this in terms of meta's play here, is that this type of feature set will make its way over to Meta's suite of products. So think the VR stuff, maybe even Facebook and WhatsApp. And the idea is that as Meta builds out the metaverse, nfts will be kind of a key step towards iterating towards that.
00:30:37.370 - 00:30:45.340, Speaker A: A pretty, this would be probably the most prime time or mainstream integration with you, is that?
00:30:45.950 - 00:31:33.370, Speaker D: Think so. I think the way I describe it is nfts, at least from Meta's point of view, nfts are the gateway drug to the metaverse, which is why they're so focused on them. It's also interesting, Coinbase kind of showed some good foresight here in terms of integrating social features with nfts when they launched their marketplace, which hasn't done terribly well and probably is over engineered at this point. And now they're going to compete with Instagram that has the user base and can kind of bolt on the NFT functionality. This has always been my thesis with nfts and how it'll play out with web two is that it's much easier to just take an existing user base of 100 million people and integrate crypto versus build a crypto platform and then try to onboard 100 million people into your mysterious crypto product, which is interesting to see that play out and saw.
00:31:33.440 - 00:31:56.642, Speaker B: What do you make of the multitude of blockchains that Facebook has chosen for this release. Curious to know. To me, it sounds like they're trying to put their eggs in multiple baskets in case one scalability solution fails. But I think their selection of some of these still points towards what they think is going to win out in the end.
00:31:56.776 - 00:32:42.334, Speaker D: Yeah, I actually am very fascinated by this. And to reiterate, it's ETH Polygon, which is a side chain of Ethereum, and then Solana, which is a different layer one blockchain and flow, which I guess would qualify as a layer one. It's kind of a weird architecture there in terms of. I think this signals something that is correct. No one knows who's going to win out, especially with nfts, the change they selected, particularly Eth polygon, which is the tickers, Matic and Solana. Those three, in my eyes, have always been like the leaders in nfts as far as truly decentralized blockchains go. Flow has been this kind of weird, pseudo centralized, decentralized blockchain that has the partnerships right.
00:32:42.334 - 00:33:02.214, Speaker D: They integrated with the NBA, the NFL, the UFC, and only recently have they started opening up their APIs a bit more. They have a very rigorous onboarding process. I'm not even sure you can buy the token in the US. So I think Facebook chose pretty well, but it's obviously very measured. They haven't committed to one over the other.
00:33:02.332 - 00:33:12.342, Speaker C: One name that was excluded from the list that I thought would be on there would be tezos. Yeah, I think it is a lot more of a retail chain than some of the other ones listed.
00:33:12.406 - 00:33:39.870, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't know. At least as far as I can see in terms of the data. Solana for sure is like, in my opinion, the clear number two, that's permissionless blockchain that has a user base. I think Polygon is just kind of an easy integration and they're strong in the business development side. It's almost like you're taking bets on different aspects of the strengths of these chains. Flow's got the partnerships with AAA leagues, Solana has the numbers. Polygon is kind of like the easiest to integrate.
00:33:39.870 - 00:33:47.410, Speaker D: And so, yeah, it kind of does make sense why tezos would fall out, because they're not probably the best at any of those particular things compared to those guys.
00:33:47.560 - 00:33:59.014, Speaker A: So how do we think this gets used a lot? I mean, are we going to see, is it going to be just board ape people posting their ape and having it verified? Or what's the really cool idea here that they're betting on?
00:33:59.052 - 00:34:41.126, Speaker D: This is actually what I forgot to mention. I kind of teased it because Twitter has been all about pfps. So your board apes the world, your punks. This is where I think demand for actual art nfts, and not just like visual art, but think music, think even taking pictures like photography, this is where those use cases are going to be incredibly powerful and we're going to start to see demand for those types of nfts because they're being shared in their native form where people already interact with them. You're going to get hundreds of thousands of likes already. Why not monetize that through an NFT now how that looks like is a different question, and we're not really sure how that plays out since it's an app on an Apple product. But that is incredibly interesting.
00:34:41.126 - 00:34:54.774, Speaker D: They're departing completely away from pfps because that's not even a feature of Instagram. You can barely see your profile picture. They're not even saying that's going to be a supported feature. So I think it'll drive demand for the other NFT use cases outside of bfbs.
00:34:54.902 - 00:35:42.410, Speaker A: Fascinating. Okay. Really we're going to have to watch because this is, like we said, the most mainstream sort of integration for NFT platform or nfts in a platform that we've seen yet, and that could get very interesting quickly. So thanks for the background, Saul. Let's move on. Let's talk about Lido, the liquid staking protocol for Ethereum's beacon chain, which is a proof of stake chain that will merge with the existing Ethereum blockchain in the event called the merge eventually, and that will facilitate the transition to proof of stake. So Lido, this liquid staking protocol, it also issues the most liquid staked ETH token has, I guess almost 33% of all ETH staked on the beacon chain today.
00:35:42.410 - 00:35:47.258, Speaker A: Christine, you're here to explain this to us. What is this? What does this mean?
00:35:47.344 - 00:37:25.254, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's quite concerning for the network, I think, but it's not something developers and users in the ecosystem hadn't already seen coming for quite a while. Now, to put that 33% number into perspective, 10% of Ethereum supply is currently locked in the Ethereum beacon chain, which is Ethereum's, like you said, proof of stake blockchain. And over this past year, with a lot more active development happening for the merge, with greater confidence that the merge is going to happen before the end of this year, with more anticipation of validator rewards on the beacon chain rising significantly because of the merge, all of these factors have pushed users and more players to become involved and interested in this idea of staking their ETH. So year to date we've seen the amount of staked ETH grow by 40%, and just this past month it's 10%. And it hasn't been too surprising. And the reason why I say it hasn't been too surprising that a lot of this value has flowed into Lido instead of other self service staking providers or even other staking as a service platforms is because number mean you do need to have a certain amount of technical know how to be able to run your own validators. So as much as devs encourage people to run their own validator sets instead of using a staking as a service platform, it does make sense that a large amount of this interest hasn't gone to self service staking.
00:37:25.254 - 00:38:24.800, Speaker B: That idea that there are easy one click options where people can just stake their ETH, it makes sense that a lot of that interest has flowed into places like Lido, but also exchanges. So the second and the third largest depositors into the beacon chain after Lido are Coinbase and Kraken. And so if users already are holding their ETH on exchanges, especially long term hoddlers, it is a no brainer to kind of easily be able to stake it on that exchange. Especially if you're feeling more confident that Ethereum is going to transition over to proof of stake. There's an argument to be made that for proof of stake platforms, if you just hold your asset rather than stake it, you're going to get devalued over time, et cetera. But I guess the other interesting part of this is why Lido over other exchanges? Why is Lido kind of like the big winner here? And I really think it comes down to the liquid eth staking derivative token that lido's got. It's kind of like a chicken and an egg problem here.
00:38:24.800 - 00:39:28.500, Speaker B: For a staking derivative token to be useful and for users to want it, it has to be extremely liquid, there has to be a market for it, it has to be widely traded in the defi ecosystem. But for you to get there, you'd need to have the users that want that token. And that's where I think Lido had the first mover advantage. It launched a few weeks after the beacon chain first went live back in December 2020. And the reason why it was able to launch so fast was because Lido, unlike some other decentralized protocols like rocket pool, basically compromised parts of its protocol to launch faster and kept parts of its service centralized. And because of that Lido was able to capture a lot of that early demand for liquid staking token for a liquid derivative staking token, when not many others existed at all and has since built out that moat for Steth. And so, data wise, Lido currently has 93% of the liquid staking market in its hands.
00:39:28.500 - 00:40:33.990, Speaker B: So I think, for me, I think seeing this influx of users this year, it does make sense that a lot of it would go to Lido now that it's hit the 33% mark. There's been quite a lot of commentary on Twitter lead ETH two Dev Danny Ryan tweeted on Tuesday that Lido passing one third is a centralization attack on proof of stake, which I thought was an extremely strongly worded message. And of course, it's not great that one protocol holds this much eth. But the other alternative, the second and the third lead staking deposits are from centralized exchanges. And the reason why Lido was created was so that all the staked ETH doesn't flow to centralized exchanges. It flows to a business whose model is more aligned with that of the overall health of the ecosystem. And to that end, I think Lido is trying to innovate, trying to improve.
00:40:33.990 - 00:41:14.898, Speaker B: I think the kind of risks that Danny Ryan is pointing out when it comes to smart contract risks comes to lido validators suddenly getting slashed, et cetera. All of that is a risk. But I don't think that it's like a high risk because of the way that Lido is set up and because of the way that Lido incentives are aligned with that of the networks, at least for now. I think there is a bigger conversation, though, around the security impact of liquid staked ETH derivatives in general to the ethereum network that we can go into if we want. But I'm going to pause there.
00:41:15.064 - 00:42:22.762, Speaker A: No, that was a phenomenal overview. I think you hit pretty much all of my questions. I guess what I'm hearing is that it's more aligned with the ethos Lido than, say, just any exchange could be, but it's still problematic. Is this sort of an existential risk for proof of stake? This is what critics have been saying for years, was that staking is a centralizing force. By definition, capital finds capital, right? And it looks like that's happening here again, more aligned or not, even if it continues to grow and they put in other things, become more decentralized, lido itself, et cetera. You're actually still, though, taking the incentives and mechanisms built into the proof of stake design and essentially that try to protect the network, and then you're taking them off chain and putting them in another box, kind of like the way flashbots has. You're putting them in the Lido box and we're saying, okay, well, Lido's got a lot of stake, but we're going to decentralize it more so then it won't be as bad.
00:42:22.762 - 00:42:43.330, Speaker A: But that's what the proof of stake protocol itself was supposed to be doing. We're now moving that into another box, kind of like with flashbots, we're using it to mitigate or perform meV. But now we have to worry about censorship risk inside flashbots, right? I mean, isn't that part of the sort of inherent issue here?
00:42:43.400 - 00:43:44.290, Speaker B: I mean, decentralization, I think, is a spectrum. And even in the beginning of Ethereum's proof of work consensus mechanism launch, I don't think the network was as decentralized as it is today. And so many critics of Ethereum's proof of stake network said immediately, when the beacon chain launched, it's just going to go to centralized exchanges. I think the existence of lido shows that there is a middle ground, there is a process towards decentralizing proof of stake that can work. And I think the fact that 33% of stake has gone to Lido shows that it's possible. I mean, there's still, of course, a lot of promises to be fulfilled, but I think it's a testament to the ability of a proof of stake network to become decentralized over time, that Lido is leading the pack over other centralized exchanges.
00:43:44.790 - 00:44:31.822, Speaker D: I had a question for you, Christine. One of the unique things about Ethereum proof of stake is that, and a lot of people talk about this, is that they don't have delegation built into the protocol, whereas other proof of stake chains like Solana and Avalanche do. So what this means at a very simple level is like, if I go in my phantom wallet on Solana, I can type in the name of a validator I know and stake all of my Solana in one click to someone else very easily. And ETH doesn't have this functionality. Which leads me to theorize that this is part of the reason why people use things like lidos, because that's basically the only easy way for an end user to stake their coin. So I'm just wondering if you have any comments on that, if maybe that decision at the architectural level is having kind of the opposite effect that they intended?
00:44:31.966 - 00:46:07.442, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a great question. I think initially I was more in the camp of ETH, not having an ability to automatically delegate stake from the protocol level would be a good thing, encouraging users to stake themselves and would be ultimately a force to help decentralize stake more. However, the popularity of Lido, I think, does put that assumption into question. I think that there's quite a number of protocol level decisions for staking that are still being built out on Ethereum that I think would service stake decentralization better than just native protocol level delegation. So one of them is distributed validator technology, and that's basically allowing users from the protocol level to be able to delegate their stake to not a single validator, but multiple different validators and basically break up the keys for staking in a decentralized fashion. That's currently quite difficult to do on the network, but there are a number of projects working on it, and I think those are the kinds of solutions that Ethereum is working towards because of the fear that just native protocol level delegation simply incentivizes too much centralization. And in that sense, I would agree that not going that full route was the right move.
00:46:07.442 - 00:46:26.950, Speaker B: But obviously it gives question to okay, well then, does distributed validator tech and other protocol level decisions either increasing like the flashing risk of node operators that operate a lot of validator entities, these kinds of tweaks to the network, will those work out in the end?
00:46:27.100 - 00:46:51.514, Speaker A: Fascinating discussion. Thanks for all your knowledge on this, Christine, and the great question, Saul. All right, let's jump into the quick hits. Just like we do every week. We've just got a couple here quickly, compound the decentralized lending protocol on Ethereum. Actually one of the oldest, actually also the one that kind of kicked off the yield farming craze when they issued their comp token in spring 2020. That led to DFI summer.
00:46:51.514 - 00:47:00.622, Speaker A: So compound has apparently been rated a b minus credit rating by SNP. I didn't realize standard and poor was doing credit ratings for decentralized protocols.
00:47:00.766 - 00:47:03.650, Speaker B: Credit rating agencies are so irrelevant.
00:47:04.150 - 00:47:13.720, Speaker D: This just reminds me of the meme. This has nothing to do. This is not interesting at all. But there's like a meme when the stock went down and someone posted like, oh, standard and poor has the word poor for a reason.
00:47:16.410 - 00:47:48.574, Speaker A: What a development, though. We'll see if we see. I don't know how this helps compound really, or is useful, or if they intend to use their credit in some way, or even can as a decentralized protocol. El Salvador, our favorite central american country, has apparently bought the bitcoin dip. Naive Kelly, the president there buying bitcoin in the 30k range. Still clearly a believer. Despite the market turmoil we're seeing, love.
00:47:48.612 - 00:47:49.386, Speaker D: To see it get.
00:47:49.428 - 00:48:02.214, Speaker A: Stick to your guns. I'm not holding my breath yet on bitcoin City they're talking about, but if they pull that off, it'll be something to see. I'm actually planning to go down and visit El Salvador soon. Really interested in what they've been doing there.
00:48:02.332 - 00:48:02.758, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:48:02.844 - 00:48:23.994, Speaker A: Okay. So Brazil, I guess sticking in the southern, I guess El Salvador is almost right at the equator, but sticking with the western hemisphere and going further south, Brazil's new bank is adding support for bitcoin and ETH. This is interesting. I thought that I read somewhere that Warren Buffett was an investor in new bank.
00:48:24.122 - 00:48:39.822, Speaker C: Yeah, I think this is big because Brazilians have always had this natural distrust of traditional banks. So they've resorted to these fintechs and it's the main onboarding mechanism into the financial services for a lot of these Brazilians.
00:48:39.966 - 00:49:23.930, Speaker A: And lastly, Napster, which I know well, this was my era. We were in middle school. I was one of the first people that had broadband. The file sharing, the music, mp3 sharing, really probably popularizing, literally the mp3 format. Napster still around apparently has been acquired by Hive Mind and Algorand. Hive mind, I think the fund, a newish but very large crypto VC fund and Algorand, the layer one blockchain, I think, founded by Sylvio McCauley in Boston. I guess they've bought Napster or bought the IP or something for Napster.
00:49:23.930 - 00:49:28.034, Speaker A: I assume this is some kind of web3 music play.
00:49:28.152 - 00:49:43.000, Speaker D: Well, yeah, it reminds me instantly of when they brought back or they're bringing back limewire to create like an NFT marketplace. I guess that's the play. And also the play here is just take every major character from the social network and just invest in whatever they found in.
00:49:44.090 - 00:50:01.114, Speaker A: My gosh, that's true. Lord. So you got the social network, you got the Winklevoss twins obviously own Gemini, a big cryptocurrency exchange based in New York. You've obviously got Mark Zuckerberg with renamed his company Meta and obviously wanted to make.
00:50:01.232 - 00:50:01.706, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:50:01.808 - 00:50:02.134, Speaker E: Wow.
00:50:02.192 - 00:50:04.686, Speaker A: And now you've got Sean, what's his name?
00:50:04.788 - 00:50:05.562, Speaker D: Sean Parker.
00:50:05.626 - 00:50:23.940, Speaker A: Sean Parker, the Napster founder who, right was an early investor in Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook. They're getting the third movie to. We got to go back and read that book. It's Ben Mezrick's book. Or watch the movie and just see who else hasn't yet come up with one that we can spot early.
00:50:24.710 - 00:50:25.134, Speaker E: Wow.
00:50:25.192 - 00:50:50.234, Speaker A: Okay. What a week. Busy week out there. Hope everyone has an excellent weekend. Thank you for listening to Galaxy brains, and we'll be back next week.
