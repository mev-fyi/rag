00:00:00.240 - 00:00:52.420, Speaker A: The first one is related to EIP 7688. EIP 7688 introduces a forward compatible data structure that smart contract developers can utilize as Ethereum developers move forward with changes to the execution layer. Data serialization method so as a little bit of background, the serialization method, the data serialization method that Ethereum uses on the consensus layer is different from the execution layer, and that does cause a inefficiencies in the way that these two layers of Ethereum speak to one another. And developers are all in agreement that eventually Ethereum's execution layer should update its serialization method from RLP to SSE. It will again introduce more efficiencies to the network and allow the Ethereum protocol to be using more updated technology.
