00:00:10.200 - 00:00:25.142, Speaker A: Welcome to the infinite Jungle. I am joined today by Lucas Kaczynski, the founding contributor of Renzo, a liquid restaking protocol, and Zach Picardy, a fellow colleague of mine on the Galaxy research team. Thank you, Zach and Lucas, for being on the show.
00:00:25.246 - 00:00:30.000, Speaker B: Super excited to be on the show today and talk about Renzo and restaking.
00:00:30.190 - 00:01:48.760, Speaker A: Yes, restaking is such a hot topic lately, and I really want to get into liquid restaking tokens, liquid restaking protocols like Renzo. And I will note also that Galaxy Research has just published a new series on staking that covers staking and restaking, and our third one will cover liquid restaking. So this is very timely, which is why, Zach, I'm also very excited to have you talk about some of your findings from that report, too. Before we get started with the show here, as we usually do on this show, we're going to start off with a quick show disclaimer. I need to remind you to please refer to the disclaimer linked in the podcast show notes, and note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice, an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. So to get started, Lucas, there is one very important question that everybody's been asking, and that's what restaking yields and what restaking will look like once Eigen layer and some of these other protocols actually go live. Do you have more of a sense on the timeline around when we can see these protocols go live? And also what you're expecting in terms of yields when they do?
00:01:49.620 - 00:02:30.090, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think that's the anticipation that everybody in this space is looking forward towards. That's the whole point of launching a restaken protocol. Right now, we're hearing both from the Eigen layer and the symbiotic team that sometime in September. So don't quote me on that. And it's really hard to predict what that's going to look like, because there's a lot of variables that go into determining what kind of rewards restaking is going to be able to emit. And the way to think about it is Renzo is, first, a staking protocol.
00:02:30.090 - 00:03:20.550, Speaker B: So when you deploy deposit into Renzo, your deposits are first staked. So you get baseline rewards similar to Lido, and then the deposits are restaked. So what we're talking about here is the restaking rewards that are going to come online. And it really depends on how many avss are live, how much TBL has been deposited into eigen layer and symbiotic because it's probably going to be fixed emissions, meaning that a certain amount of emissions are divided by the depositors based on different factors. So there's a lot of factors that go into it if we have a chance here. The one thing I think most of the community is not talking about is efficiency.
00:03:22.090 - 00:03:23.434, Speaker A: What do you mean by that?
00:03:23.602 - 00:04:31.780, Speaker B: Yeah, so given that, restaken is a lot more complicated because you have all these avss that you could select, everything's done on mainnet and every single transaction means gas. So for the past year, restaken has really been just the deposit contract and securing ABS's. And in April, Eigen layer went live where you could actually secure ABS's. But there's no slashing or emissions. And it's extremely expensive to actually do that on chain, whether it's verifying proof or doing withdrawals and stuff like that. So the most important thing that is going to play out here once ABS is launch, is not only the selection of the ABS's from a risk reward perspective, but how efficiently can the protocol actually return those rewards to the users. So the more complexity and the more tech debt you have in the protocol, the more gas fees which eats away at your rewards that you'll receive as staker.
00:04:31.900 - 00:04:49.876, Speaker A: So the costs of something like initiating a slashing or allowing validators to enter and exit, those costs have to be borne by the AV's. Like when they are designing smart contracts or they're plugged into Eigen layer. They're the ones that are going to have to do it very efficiently or it'll.
00:04:50.068 - 00:04:51.836, Speaker B: It's actually the stakers.
00:04:51.988 - 00:04:53.630, Speaker A: It's actually born by the stakers.
00:04:53.740 - 00:05:35.470, Speaker B: The stakers, right. So it's the operators and the stakers that are going in to secure those ABS's. The AVss are at the very end of the flow. But the efficiency piece comes on. How well is the tech stack built to efficiently capture those rewards and then return them to stakers? And it's nothing around slashing, it's actually the reward payments. So when you think about it, for example, if you have three abs's, there are seven strategies that you could run. Secure a secure B Secure C AB, BC, ABC.
00:05:35.470 - 00:06:21.676, Speaker B: And each of those ABS's have different reward tokens. So how do you on chain this is on Mainnet as well, harvest those rewards, because you have to validate proofs and you have to secure these AVss. And then when those rewards get paid out, it's transactions, it's multiple hops that you need to execute on chain and return that. So the protocols are actually spending quite a bit of gas between the operators and the depositors to get that, those rewards back to. So this hasn't played out yet. This is what Renzo has been super excited about. We're the only protocol out there that's actually built from the ground up.
00:06:21.676 - 00:06:34.320, Speaker B: And what we mean by that is we weren't a liquid staking protocol before. We didn't have a different product. We've actually been able to build it specifically for restaking to be as efficient as possible.
00:06:34.780 - 00:07:25.122, Speaker A: I see. I believe, Zach, one of the things that you had mentioned in your report was that because of the costs that are going to be borne by these node operators to secure these avss, node operators are going to drop AVss because it just doesn't make sense for them to continue to support these AVss because of the rewards that they're getting is just not enough. You know, it's not. The emissions are not going to be, you know, sufficient. And that this is going to cause operators to. That certain AVss are not going to be able to get the purchase, the economic security that they want from say, an eigen layer. Curious to know how you think the dynamics are going to work when all these node operators have signed up to these avss on eigen layer.
00:07:25.122 - 00:07:55.930, Speaker A: They don't have emissions. How. How easily do you think they're going to be able to get out of some of these predicaments? Is it going to be a very easy, a very quick kind of move between avss and rewards and schemes? Or do you think it's going to actually be a very sticky situation where potentially operators that maybe even Renzo is running is kind of locked in and will have to bear very high costs for a certain fixed amount of time.
00:07:56.230 - 00:08:35.200, Speaker B: So I think there's two things there. It's the cost of actually securing the ABS's and there's the reward piece. On the cost side, there is a factor of economies of scale that's going to play out of. So if you're like a solo home staker or like just a small node operator, because of the variability. And what I mean by variability is that each ABS has different requirements that the operator has to be very good at running versus with staking. It's just one strategy that you're running. So you have one set of requirements.
00:08:35.200 - 00:09:23.088, Speaker B: It is going to make it very difficult and in a lot of cases unprofitable for smaller node operators to operate and be able to secure multiple ABS's. So we do expect the consolidation. We do expect economies of scale. So if you have a lot of deposits, obviously there's a fixed cost that you need to run these nodes and secure ABS's. So the more deposits that you have, that fixed cost remains the same, and then your margin kind of increases. So that's one way to think about it. And then your second question around, how easy is it to go in and out? It's relatively easy to go in and out.
00:09:23.088 - 00:09:58.100, Speaker B: And it's the node operators, in a lot of cases, at least, when it comes to restaking protocols, they're not doing that. The restate can protocol is actually triggering those functions for the node operators to do that. So it's not like Renzo contacts a node operator, or the node operator just does it on themselves. There's contract calls and smart contracts that execute this on chain. So going in and out is relatively easy. It's still expensive, there's gas costs. That's where I said the efficiency, how you built that is super important.
00:09:58.100 - 00:10:50.650, Speaker B: Switching from one abs to another, that is not only expensive, it's slow because there's a cool down period, right? So when you think about restaking, not only is the ETH being staked on the beacon chain, that I think earlier this week I was checking, it's a nine day cooldown period to unstake from the beacon chain. But restaking right now has on Eigen layer, for example, has a seven day cooldown period. So if you want to move ETH from one or from securing one abs to another, it can be a couple weeks to be able to do that. And there's gas costs associated with switching, but with withdrawing, that's a much smoother use case and flow.
00:10:51.030 - 00:11:16.506, Speaker A: I'd be curious to know also if some of those parameters change depending on the AV's that you are connected to. I don't know if I can. Layer does enforce maybe the specific. I'm sure Eigen layer has its own cooldown period. I wonder if AVSS themselves have certain criteria when it comes to the duration in which you stake for as an.
00:11:16.538 - 00:11:55.896, Speaker B: Operator, but yeah, right now they don't. But we do expect them to impose that on chain, and that's essentially to ensure that they have a certain amount of economic security. Think of it like a bond, right? If I'm running a service, I need to ensure that I have a baseline amount of economic security. And the way I could do that is essentially incentivize with emissions, with rewards. Or I could predefined and say, hey, if you deposit into my abs the funds are there for six months. So essentially you're capturing that economic security for a given period of time.
00:11:56.088 - 00:12:25.400, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the kind of flexibility that these avss are going to have, and the different like, models that they're going to move forward with once restaking goes live, you know, maybe in September, hopefully will be really interesting. Zach, anything that you'd like to add to the discussion on what we might, how we might see the restaking landscape kind of evolve once yields and emissions actually go live in September? Any kind of questions additionally that you wanted to ask, Lucas?
00:12:26.140 - 00:13:40.298, Speaker C: Yeah, so the report that I recently covered on re staking was kind of like a parallel look at what they're doing over in cosmos with replicated security, versus kind of like the more market driven model that Eigen layer has kind of adopted. So it's kind of interesting to see what they did there for the last year, and kind of like what they're building towards and then comparing it to what Eigen layer is launching with on day one, the idea of being forced into securing an AV's, which is the case with replicated security node operators can't just drop it, even if it is unprofitable. They're just forced to keep running with it. I think on day one, and even just looking at the rewards that node operators have earned in replicated security, is actually quite small, most of it coming from token emissions. So I was just curious to maybe get your input on what you think the breakdown in terms of composition of rewards will be. Do you think it'll be majority token issuance? Or will some of these abs be able to capture mev that they can then distribute to node operators? Or will it just be like network fees or what do you think that basket of rewards kind of looks like?
00:13:40.434 - 00:14:27.060, Speaker B: Yes. So it really just depends on the AV's and where they are, a maturity lifecycle from their product being used on chain. So I think one of the best examples that you'll hear Renzo talking quite a bit about is hyperlane. Hyper lane is a bridge. We at Renzo use Everclear for XCRC 20, which allows easy eth to go from arbitram to blast, blast to base without ever having such mainnet. And then we use Everclear essentially as the settlement layer and a bridge. And the reason I bring up hyperlane is they're a really good example where they have a product.
00:14:27.060 - 00:15:08.910, Speaker B: I think last month they had $800 million of monthly settlement between the chains. 70% of that volume is coming from Renzo users. And they're launching an AV's. So what you're going to see here is the hyper lane. AV's requires node operators essentially to go between chains. So Renzo as a protocol will have the option to secure hyper lane as an AV's strategy. That AV's who are hyper lane in this case, not only will probably have their own token in the future, but they are already capturing fees on chain.
00:15:08.910 - 00:15:55.854, Speaker B: So users of Renzo deposit ETH and get easy ETH back are actually securing hyperlane. They're using easy ETH and paying for gas to go between the chains. And then those fees are now going to be able to get shared with the same users that are securing the network and using Hyperlane. So it's one of the first examples that we're seeing of this full marketplace actually play out. But it really depends on the abs. Eigen DA is starting to be used by multiple roll ups. Those roll ups are going to be paying for those services versus if you have an ABS that's pre market.
00:15:55.854 - 00:16:52.608, Speaker B: So when I say pre market, there's like two factors, pre token and pre. Actually having clients that pay for those services. If they're subsidizing that, the composition of the emissions is going to be very different. So when you start thinking about the amount of variability that is introduced into restaking different Abs's, Abs's might pay in native eTh. If they're capturing fees, or in their own token, or in some cases they're pre token and pre clients, they might be doing point systems. All this variability is actually what excites us, because that means there's a lot of inefficiency. And if there's a protocol that's able to efficiently capture and manage that risk for stakers, there's a lot of value that is able to be added for stakers that if you try to do it by yourself, it's going to be very hard.
00:16:52.704 - 00:18:03.120, Speaker A: I want to talk a little bit about the value that's being created for stakers, at least right now, because this issuance is not real. So many people are just earning points. And so I wanted to talk to you, Lucas, a little bit about the logic behind points and the motivation for points. Because there's points, as I understand it, they're created by the issuer, but they have no monetary value. As Renzo, you could issue a billion points, or 2 billion, or 3 billion, and get and incentivize users in that way. But what does it actually really even mean for stakers? And so I'm curious to know, like do you have any concerns around the wind down of all these points that are in the market? Especially as I noticed kind of the staking that you guys have released? Most of the staking, most of the benefit of staking on Renzo is to earn points. Once, you know, tokens go live, once restaking issuance, once we actually get some additional yields for restaking, all of these points are going to have to be materialized in some way.
00:18:03.120 - 00:18:16.684, Speaker A: Do you think that there's going to be a drastic kind of drop off in activity and people engaging with the protocol because you no longer have that speculation around points?
00:18:16.852 - 00:18:52.766, Speaker B: Yep. It's one of the biggest challenges that most protocols in web3 have to face. The goal, the ultimate goal of launching a restaking protocol like Renzo is essentially two things. One, to have this baseline staking rewards that Renzo generates today. So again, I mentioned that at the beginning of the call that with Renzo, you're first staking your ETH. So there's rewards that are generated there. And we've all been working towards restaking rewards come online.
00:18:52.766 - 00:19:55.452, Speaker B: So when you think of like an XY access, just a chart where we are and where we're trying to get. We're trying to get to a point where there's this baseline staking. And then you're going to see restaking rewards ramp up as Eigenva launches and other ABS's. And the question is, how do you go from point a to point b and how do you solve for cold start problems? So in the current cycle, we're seeing a lot of protocols, launch point programs or loyalty programs to essentially see if there's even product market fit and if users are excited or want to use that product to begin with. So that's where you start off with points. But points, there's only so many to your point points that you could actually generate to create any kind of value for users. You have to go through this transition where essentially at the very beginning you have a cold start problem.
00:19:55.452 - 00:20:44.660, Speaker B: How do you attract users to use your protocol to find product market fit? This last cycle, points seem to be the way to do that. And then you have to transition away from points into real rewards, which are going to come from staking to restaking. So Renzo is kind of right in the middle right now where points are starting to taper off. And we expect we have the baseline staking rewards and we expect restaking rewards start coming online in September. And as more avss come online, there'll be more and more. So it's this transitionary period that we're in right now. That is extremely difficult to navigate because we're dependent on other protocols also launching and different pieces coming together.
00:20:44.660 - 00:21:04.840, Speaker B: The longer it takes, the more stretched out it is and the harder it is to navigate that transition from essentially a very early product with the cold start to product market fit with what we expect restaking to play out.
00:21:05.220 - 00:21:47.498, Speaker A: Yeah, and I think the communication around points is also very difficult given that there's so much speculation around what these points are going to be worth and being able to give information on how much your points will be worth, when the redemptions will happen. All of this is something that continues to keep the speculation alive or at a certain point comes crashing down in terms of expectations. I think that's what we saw with Eigen Lair points. But many others that have led to quite a bit of community lash back. It's a hard, it's like a type rope. You gotta so a hard balance to make. But um.
00:21:47.634 - 00:22:36.196, Speaker B: Well, essentially you have users in the marketplace that expect, again, there's this expectation in the market. It's never communicated that like the points are actually going to result in anything, but there's a certain precedence that's been set in the market. And essentially as a user, the, the hard part is there's a number of variables to try to figure out. It's like how many points are being issued, how long is it going to be between maybe me earning the points and being able to redeem them for something, whether it could be anything. Right. And then what is the multiplier or whatnot. So there's a lot of variables and at the end you have to execute and you have to build a protocol that has product market fit.
00:22:36.388 - 00:23:22.284, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess one question about then, one of the products that we hadn't spent a lot of time talking about on this episode yet is of course the liquidity restaking token itself. Curious to know your thoughts on the way that the growth of liquid restaking tokens will, the kind of impacts it's going to have on DeFi, on the broader kind of security, I guess, of ethereum. Right now, liquid restaking tokens don't make up a high percentage of what actually is represented in terms of ETH staked. But I have noticed some pretty lucrative ways to get people to use and to buy into the liquid restaking token. Is it easy eth? It's easy eth, right, easy eth.
00:23:22.372 - 00:23:25.140, Speaker B: We have EZ, Mpzeith and Pzeath.
00:23:25.180 - 00:24:30.564, Speaker A: Based on the symbiotic. That's hilarious. That's a good naming. One of them is on the ways in which people can deposit their easy ETH or pze into a lending protocol, a decentralized finance lending protocol like compound etH, just eth in return, use that to then mint more easy peasy eth stake, put that back into the lending protocol, get earned yield, and just kind of like loop that back multiple times. Seems to really jack up the yields that you can get in DeFi, but also seems like a dangerous way to increase a lot of leverage in the system. So what are your thoughts on how liquid restaking tokens and their proliferation during a time when liquidity is very scarce for these tokens and so many features for restaking haven't gone live yet. Are you concerned at all that the unwinding of some of these borrows and lends will have some pretty negative effects on DeFi users?
00:24:30.732 - 00:25:16.146, Speaker B: Yeah. So what you're seeing with liquid restaking tokens. So, like I mentioned, Renzo has easy Eth and Pze. Easy ETH is on eigen layer, PZ ETH is on symbiotic is the whole point of it is to be able to be liquid on your position. The fundamental use case is because there is this cool down period that could take two to three weeks to actually get your collateral back. The nice thing about a liquid token is that you don't have to go through that cool down period. You could actually go to Dex and you could swap in an owl and be liquid if you don't want to have exposure to a restaking protocol.
00:25:16.146 - 00:25:32.722, Speaker B: So that's like the fundamental use case that liquid restaken tokens try to solve for is the liquidity. And being able to be liquid on a position versus having to go through a cool down period that is also heavy on the gas side.
00:25:32.826 - 00:25:35.330, Speaker A: Now, not unlike liquid staking tokens.
00:25:35.410 - 00:26:19.764, Speaker B: Exactly right. It's the exact same thing DeFi B and DeFi and even traditional financial markets, when there's opportunities people like to lever up, they like to go leverage long, leverage short, leverage neutral strategies. That is just how financial markets tend to work on their own. What you're talking about is what we've seen is, and sometimes it's profitable, sometimes it's not. So it's people trying to find efficiency in the market when borrow rates on ETH are extremely low. And, you know, easy ETH is, let's say, generating 3.5% of rewards on staking.
00:26:19.764 - 00:26:49.058, Speaker B: Right now, some people will deposit easy ETH into like a compound they might borrow ETH. And then there's an opportunity there that they're trying to arbitrage. It is Defi, there are risks associated with it. So I encourage everybody to actually read up and understand what they're doing. I always say ape responsibly. Responsibly. We share that internally with our team.
00:26:49.058 - 00:27:40.700, Speaker B: But the risks, essentially, there's two risks. If a protocol doesn't have withdraws and people are levering up, and then a lot of people want to exit that position. At the same time, it does depend the price, even though the collateral is there, and it could cost cascading liquidations on a lending protocol. That's probably the scariest thing. Now, the one thing that reassures me, though, and I think is really important for our audience to understand, is that when you deposit into Renzo, let's say, EtH, that ETH is being used to secure Avssegh, that underlying collateral is always there. It does not go away. Well, hopefully it's always there if the protocol is safe and secure and everything else.
00:27:40.700 - 00:28:46.320, Speaker B: And then you have this liquid representation of the token that is trading in the wild. There is a big divide there now when. So I don't worry as much about what happens in Defi and economic security for AVSs, only in the case that people start withdrawing mass amounts of those deposits that are used as security. So this kind of comes back to what we were talking about earlier. How can AVSs ensure that they have the baseline economic security that they need to be able to secure their services? Because it is a, people can come in and out of the market, but there is like this collateral that's deposited, that ETH is being used to secure that ETH. The price doesn't change regardless of what's going on with the liquid token, two separate pieces dependent on each other. But there's a way to essentially manage the two.
00:28:46.700 - 00:29:55.264, Speaker A: Yeah, that's definitely one of the things that I'm the most concerned about knowing as Avss go live, because it what is the stake of so many users that are going to be collateralized, that are going to be potentially slashed? But also, independently of that, as the valuation of points changes, as certain tokens goes live, the appetite for people to engage in lending and borrowing, liquid restaking tokens, I think that demand will also shift. There's so many upcoming milestones, I think, in this restaking ecosystem that will impact demand. And so when I see more and more people locking up their tokens or rehypothecating them in different ways, the unwinding of them all just kind of like makes me afraid keeps me up at night sometimes. But on the topic of risks, I also wanted to give you a chance. Zach too. Do you have any other kind of questions, final questions for Lucas when it comes to the risks of liquid restaking tokens.
00:29:55.352 - 00:30:36.700, Speaker C: Yeah, I think just like kind of feeding off of the LRT to LST comparison. Like LRT's look pretty similar to what LST's did three, four years ago. Beacon chain didn't have withdrawals enabled. We were still issuing liquid tokens against them and kind of waiting for beacon chain to fully come to fruition. And that obviously had like impacts on DeFi. But when we think about LRT's versus LSTs in terms of like adoption, LSTs were able to benefit from kind of the commoditized nature of the service or the work that's being done underneath them, which is just beacon chain validation. But LRT's look a little bit differently on like a token by token basis.
00:30:36.700 - 00:30:53.470, Speaker C: Some may just secure AVSA and others B, and they don't benefit from the kind of network effects that come with the commoditization of the work being done underneath them. So I was just curious if you have any thoughts on where the network effects or like related flywheels come from in terms of LRT adoption.
00:30:53.930 - 00:32:07.894, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that the first important thing to kind of call out here is that security is the first thing that we are concerned about at runso. Not only smart contract and Defi and selection of ABS's and managing slashing risk, these are all components that we spend the majority of our time on. The other thing that I think is super important to kind of call out here is how these things are going to market. It's not like there's going to be no slashing and then slashing is just going to be enabled. Eigen layer is going to slowly dial up slashing to try to make it as safe and as secure as possible at the same time. This period over the last three months since April, when Eigen layer allowed to start securing ABS's with operators and not paying rewards and not having slashing is actually a really important phase of the project and their go to market. It, essentially, the way I explain it, it allows everybody to kind of speed date each other without having to worry about what the repercussions are because there is no slashing, there are no rewards.
00:32:07.894 - 00:32:56.702, Speaker B: So it allows you to build out those integrations and get operators to run the hardware that they need to to make sure it works, that you can deposit, that you can withdraw, and the rails are kind of loop. So when slashing is enabled, it's going to be very slow. We have a research team at Renzo that you could go look at our mirror. We constantly publish pieces around like portfolio 101 or how to manage risk. We talk with risk managers like chaos Labs and Gauntlet to really bring all that expertise. And everybody's trying to learn together. So I think that's really important and shouldn't keep you up at night because it's not like it's just going to go from zero to 100.
00:32:56.702 - 00:33:30.000, Speaker B: It's going to be probably a drawn out process. It's been a year since we started working on Renzo. It's probably going to be another year before we see a dozen avss with full slashing capabilities being turned on. So I think that's kind of 1 second. You talked about like the economic security. Again, Renzo is a staking protocol first. So we benefit from also securing the beacon chain and there's consensus and Mev rewards that are paid back to users and stakers.
00:33:30.000 - 00:34:08.680, Speaker B: And then once restaking comes online, we talked about, for example, hyper Lane. Same thing with Eigen da, right? Like Renzo is on nine chains today on l two s where you can natively deposit ETH. And it's the same users that are using those roll up services. So take arbitrum, for example, right? Arbitrum users are able to deposit Ethan into Renzo. That ETH comes to mainnet and it secures eigenvate. Well, arbitrum might be using eigenvate and actually paying for those same services. And those rewards are returned to those users.
00:34:08.680 - 00:34:47.758, Speaker B: So we do expect a blossoming ecosystem in the marketplace to take shape. It's going to take time. There are risks associated with it, so there's no reason to rush. If anything, it's super important that the restaking protocol that you're interacting with, you know, is one well funded. They focus on research, they have the right partners and is focused. We're seeing a lot of protocols doing a lot of things, not just restaking. That's actually what keeps me up at night is other players that are trying to do, you know, five or ten different things.
00:34:47.758 - 00:34:54.250, Speaker B: Instead of being focused and being the, the best at doing one thing at Renzo, all we do is restaking.
00:34:54.330 - 00:34:57.802, Speaker A: So very quickly, Lucas, what rollups are.
00:34:57.826 - 00:35:08.410, Speaker B: Building on eigen da celo mantle, I believe arbitrum optimism. You're going to see a lot of announcements coming out.
00:35:08.530 - 00:35:16.550, Speaker A: I didn't know that. Yeah, I didn't know that there were that many roll ups building on Eigenva, but that's good to know.
00:35:17.490 - 00:35:37.690, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, that's the whole point of risk. Think about it, is like an AWS app store. Instead of running your own infrastructure in a house now, you could actually go and rent it and pay, but it's targeted specifically at roll ups, being able to scale much, much quicker and cheaper.
00:35:38.390 - 00:36:04.218, Speaker A: Gotcha. Well, thank you very much, Lucas, for sharing all of those insights. And thank you, Zach, for joining the show. I feel like there's so much to look forward to in the next couple months as more announcements go live related to and some of these restaking protocols on Ethereum. Go live. Yeah. I thank you so much to our listeners as well for tuning into another episode of the infinite Jungle.
00:36:04.218 - 00:36:14.610, Speaker A: We hope that you learned something new about Ethereum, and we hope that in your explorations of the infinite jungle that is Ethereum, you guys stay safe out there.
