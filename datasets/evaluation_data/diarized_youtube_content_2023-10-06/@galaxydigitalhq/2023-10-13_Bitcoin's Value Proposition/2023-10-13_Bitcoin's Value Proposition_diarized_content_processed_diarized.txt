00:00:00.240 - 00:00:37.728, Speaker A: For bitcoin to be a bona fide financial asset? Well, there needs to be financial tools built on bitcoin. And so far, all those financial tools have been centralized and custodial. And as we kind of know, you know, beyond the black box point as well. Like, you know, custodial, bitcoin is fairly easy to confiscate, fairly easy to freeze. And so, you know, to the extent that we can build a alternative that allows folks who want to do it non custerially to be able to do so, I think that's super crucial to give that alternative.
00:00:37.816 - 00:00:41.184, Speaker B: Love that. Yeah. And it is. I think that is at the core of a bitcoin value proposition.
