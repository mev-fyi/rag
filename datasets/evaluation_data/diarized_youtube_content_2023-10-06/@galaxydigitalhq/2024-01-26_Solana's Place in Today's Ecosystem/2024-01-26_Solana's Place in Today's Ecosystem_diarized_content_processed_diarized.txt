00:00:00.090 - 00:00:01.338, Speaker UNK: What's your take on Solana.
00:00:01.434 - 00:00:39.606, Speaker A: In general? Where does it fit in this new world? Right. So I'll say this. I think there's obviously been some material activity on that which is given a little bit of lift. I think also people have to remember Solana got whacked the hardest. So it's like the hardest. I think there's a little bit of, like I said this on another podcast thing too. I think a lot of people infer that positive, roared back so much that what do we dollars, so call it, twelve X or whatever, but at the same time it fell the hardest from, it's just trading more volatile to a degree when you zoom out a little bit because there's other stuff that's rallied a bunch too.
00:00:39.606 - 00:00:50.810, Speaker A: And you don't see people being like, oh, instead people are moving to say a coin or whatever. So I think I don't like the narrative stuff as much. But there is rip, David Vorik Siacoin, is that not alive anymore?
