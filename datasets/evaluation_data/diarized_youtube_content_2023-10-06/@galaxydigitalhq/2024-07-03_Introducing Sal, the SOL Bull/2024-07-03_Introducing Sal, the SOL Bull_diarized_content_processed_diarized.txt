00:00:10.200 - 00:00:20.702, Speaker A: Welcome to the infinite Jungle. On today's show, I have Saul Khadir, the co founder and CEO of Bullpen, and my former colleague at Galaxy. Thanks for being on the show, Saul.
00:00:20.846 - 00:00:31.092, Speaker B: Amazing. Thanks for having me, Christine. Very excited to see you put out this show. I think it was a few months ago you launched it. Super cool. I've been in this studio before. It's weird to be back at the.
00:00:31.116 - 00:00:34.468, Speaker A: Office when we were all recording galaxy brains back in the day.
00:00:34.604 - 00:00:35.100, Speaker B: Oh, my God.
00:00:35.140 - 00:00:44.868, Speaker A: I think our boss, Alex Thorne, may not want everybody to go to the super, super early parts of the show, because it was a very different show, galaxy Brains, than what it is today.
00:00:44.924 - 00:00:46.636, Speaker B: But it was a different era in crypto, too.
00:00:46.708 - 00:01:01.470, Speaker A: It was. And now you, too. I mean, there's been so much developments of what you've been up to since galaxy. Tell me a little bit about bullpen and the recent developments of this. It's a telegram trading bot. Right.
00:01:01.890 - 00:01:59.316, Speaker B: And maybe I'll preface by saying the thesis beyond bullpen has been, can we make a front end for Defi that's really easy to use? Can we bring trading on chain the experience of that to feel similar to a Robinhood? Can we make Robinhood on chain? Those are the questions we've asked ourselves from the beginning. And so the first product, which we just opened up the beta for a couple of weeks ago, is a telegram trading bot that also has a telegram miniapp in it. And the response has been pretty overwhelming. People are already kind of anointing it as one of the coolest miniapps I've ever seen. And we're going to be pushing a lot of really interesting features through that. But, yeah, I mean, it's been super exciting to see that thesis play out. I think a lot of other startups are also waking up to that thesis, which to me has always been de frat protocols get commoditized over time, front ends start to win over time and be the key revenue drivers for businesses in crypto.
00:01:59.468 - 00:02:07.724, Speaker A: And so bullpen is more of like a front end for decentralized finance app, and it's built for the Solana ecosystem, is that right?
00:02:07.812 - 00:02:29.998, Speaker B: Correct. Yeah, we're currently on Solana. We're exploring other ecosystems, too. But Solana is where the action's happening. Solana is where people want to trade, it's where people want to onboard. If you look at even the numbers for regular wallets like Phantom, you know, it's regularly in the top five. And this is a huge departure from perhaps last cycle, where you sell more of the ETH wallets crack the top ten.
00:02:30.094 - 00:02:57.130, Speaker A: Yeah. Let's talk a little bit about market cycles, because before, right before we shot this pod or like we started recording, you were saying how a lot of the dynamics of the market today, especially between the competition between Sol and ETH, is playing out exactly like how you thought it would. So I want to elaborate on that. What do you mean by that? What are some key trends and changes that you're seeing in the industry that you expected?
00:02:57.830 - 00:03:33.936, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, this is something we can kind of try to split this up. But basically, from the moment I walked into Galaxy as a researcher in July of 2021 might have been August, the first thing I hear people talking about are l two s. And people would talk about altoos as if they're just this thing that have a lot of trade offs in terms of centralization, even just the optimistic roll ups. They have a seven day kind of period where you can contest state. And the overwhelming response from first principles was like, this is not really the future. It's just kind of stepping stone. People weren't finding them interesting at all.
00:03:33.936 - 00:04:19.800, Speaker B: But now, fast forward a few years now we're supposed to act like they were the solution all along. It just felt a little bit weird to me that there was all this love for the same l two s that people were kind of criticizing when I first joined. And fundamentally, the technology behind l two s never changed at all. They were still highly centralized, they were still very fragmented. And so my thesis was, there's no way this is going to successfully scale eth for a lot of reasons, which we can get into all those reasons throughout this interview, but it was very clear to me that that was not really going to work. And so, especially my perspective as someone who's trying to build something and has to choose an ecosystem, those were rarely. It felt like that was not a great choice for a lot of reasons as well, compared to something like a Solana.
00:04:20.100 - 00:04:57.420, Speaker A: So what do you think about the l two adoption lately? Because it has been picking up quite a bit. I feel like the entire Ethereum development roadmap has now shifted to being roll up centric. I think there's a lot more kind of support for roll ups now, like you said, and lots of user activity more so now. I think it's. I always go to l two beat. That website that shows a lot of the activity is now dwarfing what's happening on Ethereum. I most think Ethereum is kind of past the point of no return in terms of this roadmap for scaling.
00:04:57.420 - 00:05:46.390, Speaker A: I think Ethereum developers have really given up on the vision of scaling the layer one. So curious to know how you foresee kind of the dynamics of that playing out. There's a lot of questions around even how Solana, people who work in Solana and people who are very supportive of Solana, how they might view competition with Ethereum now, almost like because Ethereum is not trying to scale, it's not trying to be a general purpose blockchain anymore. It's trying to be a da. Layer is the competitive lens in which you look at Ethereum's growth now shifting to all these l two s. Is it Solana versus l two s, or is it still Solana versus Ethereum in some ways? Curious to know kind of how your thinking has changed there.
00:05:46.550 - 00:05:56.430, Speaker B: Yeah, it's changed in a lot of ways, I think. Here's the thing. Eth doesn't actually do anything well. And so I don't see any reason why people would use it like bitcoin.
00:05:56.470 - 00:05:58.210, Speaker A: I mean, more people use it than Solana.
00:05:58.750 - 00:06:17.984, Speaker B: I mean, it just depends on how you define usage. But I guess my point is. But it's not that ultrasound, right? Bitcoin's ultrasound, you can't scale it, so you can kind of use an l two if you want. But if you study what's happened yesterday, look, Vitalik's throwing his money at mega eth. That has nothing to do with base layer eth. Besides, it's EVM compatible. Mod ad, same story.
00:06:17.984 - 00:07:14.332, Speaker B: It's a separate l one has no direct ties to ethereum other than they can borrow from the research on the EVM side. They can compile the contracts to Monadhenne. My point is, eth, the asset, doesn't have any direct ties to what I think could scale the EVM landscape, which is these completely separate l one s that in fact look a lot more like Solana than anything else. The l two s, I don't think they're going to work because there's too many of them. So even if you have one, that sort of scales, if you have assets on another. Now, VC's are funding this paradigm called chain abstraction, which is just yet another piece of infra sitting on infra sitting on infra. That sort of, it gets very complex very quickly as a developer, like, how on earth am I going to convince one to even understand what the difference between eth on arbitrum is versus optimism versus base? How do you communicate that to a user? It gets very hairy very quickly.
00:07:14.332 - 00:07:36.310, Speaker B: The simpler solutions, let's start from scratch and build a scalable l one. That's why you saw Mega Eth's announcement make waves yesterday. That's why you see a lot of excitement for things like Monad, which probably have a better shot. That's what I consider to be real competitors to Solana is things like those versus the current approach we're supposed to use to scale Ethereum.
00:07:36.810 - 00:07:52.406, Speaker A: I'm curious because I haven't looked much into this mega EtH project, but are they using Ethereum for settlement or da? Is there an aspect of their technology that interfaces with the Ethereum protocol?
00:07:52.478 - 00:08:52.334, Speaker B: As far as I did a little write up on it yesterday, as far as I understand, it's focused more on leveraging parallelization node specialization, which to me just sounds like using bigger nodes like Solana has been doing forever. They're using the right words, though, to make it seem like something else. It actually just feels like another flavor of Monad in a lot of ways where it's still evm compatible and so you don't lose all the research and all of the ecosystem around ETH and all the code that's been written for Ethereum projects. But I do not believe there's any direct ties as far as DA or anything like that because I don't think that is going to work. I'm not convinced that people care about that stuff committing back, because again, now you have a bunch of startups that are now they want to be a DA layer. So at what point can you just completely remove yourself from ETH? You can pretty much do that today. And in fact, a lot of startups have an incentive to have you move away from committing or using ETH as a DA layer.
00:08:52.502 - 00:10:41.940, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there's a lot of cheaper DA layers out there for sure, that make it easier for rollups from a more like revenue perspective to be able to use other das. But I think the advantage of Ethereum as a DA is because of Ethereum's established kind of decentralization and the fact that it has the most reliable uptime and a lot of the security, the economic security backing Ethereum. So there are definitely some features of Ethereum that position it, well as a very definitely expensive DA, but also secure one. And I will also mention that I think what you said about the fact that mega Eth and some of these other protocols are taking so much of what Ethereum has built over the past couple of years, like the EVM, a lot of the toolkits, a lot of the developers kind of mind share that they can learn from I do wonder if Solana too has a lot, is benefiting and can benefit a lot from the same challenges that general purpose blockchains have and can learn from some of the same hurdles that Ethereum has went through. Definitely as it relates to scaling, scaling the all one believe that there are actually some l two s on Solana being built as well. And I know that Solana has also evolved quite heavily from its original vision of being a layer one blockchain with absolutely no fee markets. Curious to know your thoughts on these developments of how we're seeing blockchains.
00:10:41.940 - 00:11:14.132, Speaker A: Solana and Ethereum converge onto the same design, onto, and especially also deal with the same problems. So there's quite a bit, I think, that we can go into here, but I want to start off and know your thoughts about the relative convergence and divergence of design solutions around blockchains. Where I see, yeah, quite a bit being borrowed from the ethereum ecosystem and yeah, a lot of areas for, I think, improvements.
00:11:14.196 - 00:11:50.718, Speaker B: So, sure. Yeah, no, I don't disagree. I think what you saw in March with the massive hysteria or interest rather, in meme coins, it tested Solana in a way that we've probably seen before, but before it would just go down this time. It stayed online the entire time, but the fees started to go really, really high. Where there was cases where you could be paying 20, $0.30, there was cases where you'd pay more than an ETH L two to land a transaction, and transactions weren't landing very consistently. And then you also see this massive rise in mev activity on Solana.
00:11:50.718 - 00:12:25.220, Speaker B: And so now validators are making their money on Mev. They're not making money on commissions anymore. And so to your point, that is absolutely converging with where ETH has been kind of this entire time. Now it's a big deal in Solana, where it literally didn't exist, like a year and a half ago. Mev, that is, there's going to be. And to your point about mempools, while there probably will never be an actual mempool in Solana, it's not really built for that. What you're seeing instead is this rise of use of bribes for landing transactions faster.
00:12:25.220 - 00:13:09.126, Speaker B: If you use these advanced apps like photon or Bolex, they have a whole field for the user to not only put your priority fee, but put your bribe in as well if you want to land really quickly. And so that feels to me like very much like when you were in minimask and you wanted to tip to have your transaction line faster. That was never supposed to be an intention. When I was first looking at Solana, it was all about fast and cheap. These days, it's pretty fast, it's pretty cheap, but it's not consistently both. There's been cases where I've tried to land transactions on bullpen, and I'm waiting 20 seconds. So I will concede that Solana's design has been tested massively.
00:13:09.126 - 00:13:18.370, Speaker B: Their upgrades may be able to bring them back to being consistently fast and cheap, and the latest version, 1.18, seems to have helped a lot on that front.
00:13:19.110 - 00:13:49.660, Speaker A: I want to talk a little bit about the latest technical updates to Solana, because there's been quite a few Zika compression, something called blinks. Now, I am always, you know, trying to keep as up to date as I can about the technical progress being made on Ethereum. I need you to give me the 101, the update on the latest slew of technical updates being made to Solana. What have been some of the biggest changes that you think have been made to the Solana protocol that's worth summarizing now?
00:13:50.160 - 00:14:59.560, Speaker B: Yeah, the biggest one is kind of what I was getting at earlier, which is 1.18, the validator update that essentially tries to solve for the congestion issues. The way it works, basically, it just comes down to how they're handling. So the issue with Solana is people spam transactions, and so the solution to it is, can you throttle traffic better, and can you kind of ensure quality of service by favoring certain validators over others? And then there's another issue in parallel with that with respect to jitter, which is just even if you have a priority fee, you're not really guaranteed to have it land necessarily faster. This is something that Solana is also working on. I'm not sure if that one was actually fully solved in the latest update, but it's something that I know the team is kind of studying deeply, and there's still quite a few additional updates that they're going to be making. I think the main criticism of the way things are skating for Solana is you're essentially giving more and more power to validators with really high stake.
00:15:00.420 - 00:15:01.172, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:15:01.276 - 00:15:18.824, Speaker B: And so that can kind of, one could argue that's not great for decentralization, but, yeah, that's kind of like, I'm not super deep in the weeds on the protocol updates these days. I'm more focused on kind of the consumer side, which you brought up, Lynx. That's something we're looking at pretty closely as well.
00:15:18.912 - 00:16:36.820, Speaker A: Nice, nice. Well, so on the topic of some of those technical developments. It's really good that Solana is working on the downtime issue and has made some really significant progress on that with the v 118 update. I want to go back also to some solutions that are being talked about regarding meV, because some of the solutions that Ethereum has implemented, like proposer builder separation, which relates to MeV Boost, that has also created new, fresh problems on Ethereum. And I think one of the kind of knee jerk reactions that have happened on Solana is for the Solana foundation to take away delegated stake from certain validators that are engaging in Bad Mev Mev that hurts users, for example, like sandwiching other major players like Cheetah, also taking some actions. What are some of the other solutions, the longer term solutions, not some of these like we pick and choose and we make some very like, I guess, like short term band aid solutions. What are some of the longer term solutions that you're seeing evolve as the mev problem gets really big? I'm sure this is top of mind.
00:16:36.820 - 00:16:45.152, Speaker A: What have you been seeing in terms of the design space moving forward and how it might change Ethereum's or. Sorry, not theories article?
00:16:45.216 - 00:17:04.500, Speaker B: Solana yeah, it's a good question. I mean, maybe I'll start by saying I'm not super in tune with the mev side of just generally l one s. It's not something I've ever found super interesting to dive into. I recognize it's a very top of mind problem and super important.
00:17:05.240 - 00:17:11.700, Speaker A: Well, for trading, I mean, in the sense of having user transactions not be sandwiched or.
00:17:12.040 - 00:17:48.580, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. And I think there's a report that you might be referencing that actually points out, like banana gun and Maestro is two key sources of order flow for mev extraction on ETH. And so obviously we're thinking about that as well. For bullpen, I think the solution space, it's a little tricky. Certainly Jito's made a lot of strides there, and potentially solutions could be just involving redistributing mev rewards back to either users or validators. But again, it's not like a super easy problem to solve, because it's always going to exist.
00:17:48.580 - 00:18:29.296, Speaker B: It exists in tradfi with retail order flow, non toxic retail order flow. That's why Robinhood caught a lot of flack for selling it to Citadel, essentially. I don't know if it's an easily solvable problem, but I'm also not sure it's super important to solve at this juncture. People that are trading on these apps, they're not really worried about getting a bad feel. They're worried about just getting a fill on something that they think can perform well for their portfolio. And so I think there's a lot of smart people working on meV, think these things will get kind of resolved, or at least they'll come to a solution that benefits more stakeholders than just the person extracting it over time.
00:18:29.408 - 00:19:32.780, Speaker A: And in terms of when we go 2030 years, I mean, it's a very long timeline, but moving forward, projecting ourselves into the future as Ethereum's l two ecosystem evolves as Solana's, if it's still around, well, that was actually going to be my question. Do you foresee Ethereum and Solana coexisting as blockchain ecosystems? Of course, there's some very joke takes of, oh, well, Solana's going to become an l two on Ethereum. A lot of joke takes of what that future might look like. But seriously, I am curious to know kind of how you see the crypto landscape evolving more long term as solutions to mev get built out, as more of these of the technologies that you, the updates that are happening on Solana also get realized and implemented. Curious to know how you see the landscape changing.
00:19:33.420 - 00:20:24.870, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a tough question because going ahead 30 years, crypto didn't even exist 30 years ago. I would say they probably will coexist. ETH has some tailwinds just with the massive amount of capital that's already been deployed there. The ETF story that will continue to evolve over time, maybe it'll become part of a basket of digital assets that allocators will want everyone to have a piece of. With bitcoin, I think Sol will actually be part of that as well. I think they'll coexist. But I do think the way that people will use blockchains will look more like Solana and will look, I just don't know to what extent ETH will actually be tangibly used to power smart contracts that regular users are interacting with.
00:20:24.870 - 00:21:13.434, Speaker B: You see the early innings of this, just with the stablecoin story in emerging markets, the rise of TroN, which essentially has equal or more issuance of USDT than Ethereum itself. People are choosing to use a completely different chain to send dollars to each other in emerging markets. To what extent is Eth actually useful anymore? That's the question I have in my head. Nfts even too expensive to use it. People don't even, aside from, like the OG collections, no new mints are happening there. And I think you'll start to see just more activity move off of eth. The question is, will it be on a chain that's still tethered somewhat economically to eth or using as a DA layer? I don't know.
00:21:13.434 - 00:21:24.380, Speaker B: Yeah, just based on what's happening in the last year, it feels to me like we'll just see an EVM hyper scalable l one kind of subsume a lot of that activity.
00:21:24.800 - 00:23:03.552, Speaker A: I think that is one of the biggest questions of whether or not we're going to see more smart contract activity and issuance of major tokens and more user activity on various protocols. Various blockchains that pay to have some of their data finalized and settled on the Ethereum blockchain for security that might allow them to scale their execution of these smart contracts and of these transactions a lot more than they could if they also was a blockchain for data settlement and data finality. But I think that is, I agree with you that it's still to be determined. Is it gonna be a future where there is a game changing solution that allows a blockchain to do it all? Or is the future these L2s that pay money, that pay ETH in gas to have all of that data finalized and settled to that layer and in that future? Or I guess, can that scaling vision for Ethereum be achieved faster in terms of adoption than the technological developments that may arise to make a blockchain so scalable that it does everything all at once? It's kind of like the, we wrote that paper together, the blockchain layer one on galaxy, and I'll link to it in our show notes of like that innovator's dilemma where Ethereum is trying to solve this scaling problem. But can they innovate that fast enough before competitors kind of catch up?
00:23:03.616 - 00:23:31.090, Speaker B: I don't think they can. I think because if they could, they would. It's been what, three years since that we even wrote that piece of. It's just there's too much molasses. They're kind of too stuck in this current paradigm, which is that version of ETH just does not scale. And no matter how much complex stuff you throw on top of it, it is not going to out compete a fresh l, one that is built from first principles for scalability.
00:23:31.750 - 00:23:39.454, Speaker A: But I gotta say, it has been years and I don't see Solana having really beaten out Ethereum in much quite yet.
00:23:39.542 - 00:24:13.150, Speaker B: However, there's still a possibility it has. Just look at there was times where Dex volumes on Solana flipped ETH pump fund flips uniswap regularly in terms of protocol, revenue, number of wallets. And that's not a great metric, but there's signal there daily active wallets mind share. Just look at all these and you could say they're positive or negative for the space. But celebrities are not even touching Ethereum anymore. They're launching stuff on Solana. Lil pumps has phantom wallet on his car.
00:24:16.570 - 00:24:54.612, Speaker A: There are some good, what do you call it, anecdotes. But I do wonder how much of that volume is real user volume because of how much spam activity and trouble there is with Solana. It's rough looking at those numbers. I'm like, man, how much of this is real user activity? And so I think sometimes economic value, looking at the dollar value being moved around is sometimes a bigger indicator that can, is perhaps a little bit harder to gain. But that said, I mean, that can also be kind of pumped up in other ways. So not saying that that is the beyond end all indication.
00:24:54.716 - 00:25:21.598, Speaker B: Yeah. Again, I think you just see a lot of people doing things on Solana that you just don't see. Now I will say ETH has kind of succeeded or done more interesting experiments in the social time. Not fun. Was an interesting experiment we saw last week. Friendtech obviously is multiple times kind of captured some interest there. Base is compelling.
00:25:21.598 - 00:25:52.590, Speaker B: I think there's reasons to be excited about it, even though it is kind of just a regular old l two. The onramp is cool with Coinbase and people are experimenting with that. And the fact that they won't have a token kind of aligns incentives in a unique way. Although we'll see if they ever decentralized the sequencer. Coinbase makes a lot of money on that. That was never really a vision. I thought people in ETH would be comfortable with just one kind of company running an l two, but here we are, and they have interesting experiments being run on there.
00:25:53.010 - 00:27:08.280, Speaker A: Yeah. James Prestwich, who I had on the show last week, he made an interesting point that by Xdev doing the roll up centric vision, Ethereum was essentially just exporting the difficult problem of scalability to a bunch of different players. So like, Coinbase is an exchange and they're going to scale and build this l two, but in a very centralized way. And then you have other folks say like scroll or, I don't know, taiko that perhaps have different visions for the trade offs made with scalability. But essentially that Ethereum is just allowing that innovation to take place elsewhere and they as the base layer, I guess really he was talking about the Ethereum foundation is kind of being more hands off approach, which I thought was kind of an interesting way to look at it, and a lot of truth in that, too. Okay, so one kind of last couple questions that I wanted to ask you, because you are so focused on the user end, the end user and you're building a product that people are literally looking on on their phones. If you haven't already subscribe to the Bullpen news Telegram chat, because it really does do a great summary of what's happening in the industry.
00:27:08.280 - 00:27:51.660, Speaker A: Could you elaborate on certain interesting user facing use cases for crypto that either you're seeing on Solano or maybe other chains that you think are going to really bringing the next wave of adoption? Because that's kind of the big question right now. We're still, I don't want to really say we're in a bull market quite yet. And usually during bull markets, you've got, we had the defi craze, Defi summer. We had nfts. A lot of people are talking about perhaps gaming or deepen. Sure. What is the next major use case for crypto that you think is going to bring in a huge wave of non like crypto native adopters to this space?
00:27:52.680 - 00:28:59.230, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, you're kind of already seeing some early signals here, just with the, again, the massive amount of activity around pump on meme coins, speculation, speculative primitives. I think to a regular person outside of crypto, what being good at trading those tells you is you're in tune with pop culture, because if you were early to some of these memes and you bought them, you would be up a lot. You even saw last night with the presidential debate. People are simultaneously looking at what's happening on pomfont or moonshot or what have you, and seeing, is there any memeable moment here that I can capitalize on? That's what crypto does really well. It's permissionless ways to embed financial primitives wherever you're interacting with and even in parallel with that, again with the debates, you saw polymarket just immediately reflect live odds and what people are actually thinking is going to happen in November based on what they're watching. To me, that's one vertical. It's just embedding speculative primitives inside of venues where you traditionally couldn't express a view or do anything with that.
00:28:59.230 - 00:29:44.780, Speaker B: And that's super cool. And that's uniquely enabled by crypto. That's not something you could do in web two, which I think is an important differentiator. And then there was another sort of vertical, which is, again, we saw the inclinations of this in the last cycle, the whole play to earn meta, which it has its problems, and a lot of it just has to do with incentive alignment. But that is interesting, and I think it's most interesting when it's applied to things that are hard to do with one entity, meaning data collection. DPIn is one example of this hivemapper. They have more up to date Google Maps than Google does because thousands of people are earning tokens for essentially helping real time update mapping data.
00:29:44.780 - 00:30:01.554, Speaker B: You can apply this to any data collection, whether it's sharing data on social media or kind of manually tagging data. That's really hard for one party to do, but if you incentivize it with tokens, it's really powerful and everyone benefits.
00:30:01.722 - 00:30:27.026, Speaker A: That's pretty fascinating. I too have been thinking a lot about the next iteration of the play to earn, and we've talked about this even before when you were working on the gaming report. And so I too am very excited to see the continuation of that. And it's cool to see some of these use cases, like you said, that crypto very uniquely enables. Exactly. So, last question, because I want to bring it full circle back to bullpen.
00:30:27.098 - 00:30:27.426, Speaker B: Sure.
00:30:27.498 - 00:30:38.114, Speaker A: You had just did the beta for the beta launch or the open release for the Telegram trading bot. What's the next product? What's the next feature of bullpen that's going to go live?
00:30:38.202 - 00:31:08.344, Speaker B: We were just chatting about it with the team this morning. So basically we're looking at a lot of things that we're super excited about. But I think what we're going to hone in on, without revealing too much, is definitely on the social side of things and uniquely enabled by telegram, because there's already a lot of people using this app. And so that's kind of why we built it in telegram, this first version of the product. And so we're playing around with some primitives and features that are really exciting there, and that's kind of what we're driving towards this next feature release. So stay tuned for that.
00:31:08.472 - 00:31:29.186, Speaker A: All right, well, thank you so much, Saul. This has been a really wonderful conversation, and it's lovely to be able to go back into some of the Solani ecosystem trends and developments, because ever since you, you went on to do bullpen, I've been lacking my tabs on the Solana ecosystem and industry. So I appreciate it.
00:31:29.258 - 00:31:30.882, Speaker B: Absolutely. Thanks for having me, Christine.
00:31:31.026 - 00:32:15.010, Speaker A: Well, thank you also, everyone, to you for listening to the show and for joining us on this episode of Infinite Jungle.
