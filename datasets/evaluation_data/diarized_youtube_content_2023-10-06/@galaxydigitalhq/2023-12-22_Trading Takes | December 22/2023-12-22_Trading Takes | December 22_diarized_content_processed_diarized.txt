00:00:08.160 - 00:00:11.966, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy brains.
00:00:12.030 - 00:00:12.806, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:12.870 - 00:00:17.046, Speaker A: So bitcoin is still pressing, and crypto markets are still going higher.
00:00:17.230 - 00:00:17.798, Speaker C: Yeah. No.
00:00:17.846 - 00:00:19.234, Speaker A: Is this Santa rally?
00:00:20.374 - 00:00:26.606, Speaker B: Well, it's kind of a multi month rally if you think about bitcoin. It's basically at a Santa Claus rally almost every month this year.
00:00:26.670 - 00:00:27.074, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:00:27.174 - 00:00:38.174, Speaker B: Uh, which I think is why it's so compelling to traditional investors. Even the best traditional investors, they look at their portfolio. Let's say they were heavily weighted at Nasdaq, may be up 45%.
00:00:38.474 - 00:00:39.226, Speaker C: Not bad.
00:00:39.330 - 00:00:40.474, Speaker B: Pretty good, actually.
00:00:40.594 - 00:00:41.538, Speaker C: Epic. Epic.
00:00:41.586 - 00:00:48.374, Speaker B: Great. Fantastic. You know, one of the best years in a long time for the Nasdaq. Bitcoin's up 150% this year.
00:00:48.714 - 00:00:49.170, Speaker C: Right.
00:00:49.242 - 00:01:17.378, Speaker B: We've had Solana up over 600% this year. I mean, some of these alt moves have been insane, like, thousands of percents crazy. You know, nfts have done well, et cetera. But high level, there are liquid crypto things that offer competitive alternatives to traditional markets, especially if you're thinking about, like, where the money is right now in the world. A ton of it's parked in bonds, earning next to no yield.
00:01:17.466 - 00:01:17.834, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:01:17.914 - 00:01:18.154, Speaker C: Right.
00:01:18.194 - 00:01:20.042, Speaker B: Well, on a relative basis.
00:01:20.098 - 00:01:20.314, Speaker C: Right.
00:01:20.354 - 00:01:39.732, Speaker B: Like, you know, you still get tens, you know, us ten years at 390. Fantastic. If you go further out the credit spectrum, you can boost those yields a little bit. But would I rather be long bitcoin? Absolutely. Have you seen the recent bitcoin ads? Yeah, I mean, the Dos equis guy is about to be in front of people's faces shilling bitcoin.
00:01:39.828 - 00:01:43.796, Speaker A: I knew he was a bitcoiner. You could always tell he's the world's most interesting man.
00:01:43.900 - 00:01:44.468, Speaker B: Obviously.
00:01:44.516 - 00:01:47.140, Speaker A: Of course he likes bitcoin. It's the world's most interesting money.
00:01:47.252 - 00:02:01.092, Speaker B: Absolutely. However, let's, you know, stick to message, though, functionally speaking, there's a new investment vehicle for bitcoin that's going to unlock tons of money that hasn't been able to go in before.
00:02:01.188 - 00:02:04.664, Speaker A: I'm very confident it's going to happen. But can you imagine the rug if it doesn't?
00:02:05.004 - 00:02:06.012, Speaker B: No, it's going to happen.
00:02:06.068 - 00:02:06.356, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:02:06.420 - 00:02:13.988, Speaker B: And I'm telling you, I personally, you know, we've published. Galaxy has published estimates of, you know, how much the ETF inflows are going.
00:02:13.996 - 00:02:15.204, Speaker A: To be, which were conservative, by the.
00:02:15.204 - 00:02:19.402, Speaker B: Way, which were super conservative in my head. They're going to be north of third, 30 yards in the first year.
00:02:19.458 - 00:02:21.962, Speaker A: Wow, that's crazy.
00:02:22.098 - 00:02:42.842, Speaker B: Way north. The demand we've seen in crypto related equities, it's high. It's high. We're talking multiple billions over the past couple of months. And that's not even with an ETF product, like, wait for the actual ETF product to launch and it is game over. The prices you're seeing now are just noise.
00:02:42.898 - 00:02:44.082, Speaker A: These are introductory prices.
00:02:44.138 - 00:02:48.814, Speaker B: Introductory prices, absolutely. There's gonna be noise around the actual launch.
00:02:49.124 - 00:02:49.532, Speaker C: Right.
00:02:49.588 - 00:02:54.204, Speaker B: You know, speculation, stuff going up and down. The volume is going to be pretty intense.
00:02:54.284 - 00:02:54.668, Speaker A: Right.
00:02:54.756 - 00:03:04.212, Speaker B: But if you're a big picture investor and a big picture allocator, right, you are going to be stepping in. Gotta have something and in size, right.
00:03:04.228 - 00:03:05.036, Speaker D: You gotta have some.
00:03:05.140 - 00:03:07.236, Speaker B: The short term noise is just noise.
00:03:07.300 - 00:03:07.924, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:03:08.084 - 00:03:08.668, Speaker C: Right.
00:03:08.796 - 00:03:55.540, Speaker B: Once the ETF product launches, it becomes a buy and hold asset in the US capital market forever. There are, I mean, I don't know about you, but there are things in people's portfolios they don't touch forever. Like, here's what happens. You buy something, it goes up, right? If you ever want to sell it, you're going to have a taxable gain. If you're doing it in a tax deferred account, et cetera, you're just going to passively keep accumulating because people just run these strategies. And so what it constantly brings to mind is that an ETF and an ETF in the US is the best combination of things you could possibly have. World's best capital market and world's best wealth creation financial innovation product ever created ETF in the US.
00:03:55.540 - 00:04:10.452, Speaker B: And it's got a great narrative and all the big boys are joining. It's such an easy trade, it's so mid curve and you don't have to be a genius to do it, but that's where we're headed. And I think you're going to see tremendous inflows and the price appreciation is really just getting started.
00:04:10.508 - 00:04:11.116, Speaker D: Yeah. Okay.
00:04:11.140 - 00:04:14.674, Speaker A: So it's been a wild year for many reasons.
00:04:15.054 - 00:04:16.294, Speaker B: The Fed, though.
00:04:16.454 - 00:04:17.006, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:04:17.070 - 00:04:30.246, Speaker A: What's gone on with the Fed this year? It's been a big road. I mean, they continue to raise rates and they stopped. They also created among the largest bank bailout programs that's ever been created with the BTFP. Is that what it's called?
00:04:30.310 - 00:04:33.902, Speaker B: Correct. And expanded usage of the discount window and things like that.
00:04:33.958 - 00:04:43.864, Speaker A: How would you talk about just. Of course, I'm shifting gears a little bit, but we're at the end of the year, you know, chair Jay Powell is getting a report card. Like, what would you say?
00:04:45.084 - 00:04:48.716, Speaker C: So if you're, if you believe that.
00:04:48.740 - 00:04:59.844, Speaker B: Their goal was to bring inflation down from 9% to somewhere closer to 2%, which is their target, without harming the employment picture, they've done a great job of doing that.
00:04:59.924 - 00:05:00.380, Speaker C: Right.
00:05:00.492 - 00:05:26.038, Speaker B: But in terms of, like, the long run sustainability of, you know, this policy, you know, time will tell, right. Because there's still material reinflation risks. You know, they're also letting equity markets and bond markets get way ahead of themselves. With S and P and Nasdaq almost at fresh year to date highs, Russell, I mean, they are at fresh. Russell's ripping like crazy. Wow. I think that there's going to be a tremendous wealth effect from that.
00:05:26.038 - 00:06:00.858, Speaker B: I think mortgage rates dropping are going to bring more buyers into the market and not necessarily more supply. And so home prices could come back up. You've had tremendous benefit from oil prices declining meaningfully. But that's not to say they're going to decline permanently and stay low. And so you've got upside risks there and high level. This is still a banking system and a financial market in the US that's strung together by the ability of the Fed to print more money and for the world to not debase the dollar because of them printing their money. And that's just a function of us having no alternative.
00:06:00.858 - 00:06:10.842, Speaker B: But how did the US respond to the banking crisis? Oh, we're just going to do this blanket guarantee of all banking deposits in the US. We have the BTFP.
00:06:10.978 - 00:06:11.514, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:11.634 - 00:06:14.458, Speaker B: There is an issue about doing that.
00:06:14.586 - 00:06:14.898, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:14.946 - 00:06:16.314, Speaker A: And creates a moral hazard.
00:06:16.434 - 00:06:16.642, Speaker C: Correct?
00:06:16.658 - 00:06:17.770, Speaker B: The moral hazard issue.
00:06:17.842 - 00:06:18.210, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:06:18.282 - 00:06:51.350, Speaker B: And so I don't think, you know, we've yet seen the consequences of that. And I do think that bitcoin plays an interesting role, not necessarily right now, but thinking about where monetary policy is going to be in five years from now or ten years from now, when we're looking at deficit spending that went totally out of control, national debt levels that are just unsustainable and things of that nature. We're going to think back on these moments and be like, oh, wow, maybe that wasn't a good policy choice.
00:06:51.382 - 00:07:03.028, Speaker A: It's the same kind of thing a lot of people said in 2000 whenever they did tarp, right? Like, maybe they should have let them fail, right. So then they could learn the lesson and they don't do it again. And like, that's how capitalism's supposed to work. Right? Is that.
00:07:03.116 - 00:07:05.444, Speaker B: But that's not how capitalism in the US is ever going to work.
00:07:05.484 - 00:07:13.004, Speaker A: And it's definitely not how banks work in the US, because banks, absolutely, they're frankly pseudo government organizations at this point. I mean, truly, I don't mean that.
00:07:13.084 - 00:07:14.276, Speaker B: They are quasi government organizations.
00:07:14.300 - 00:07:27.614, Speaker A: Yeah, they really are. Because first of all, you need crazy levels of registration to even operate one. The number of banks is declining precipitously over years. But also, like, they are extensions of Fed policy. They are extensions of government policy.
00:07:29.234 - 00:07:31.882, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, they're quasi government entity.
00:07:31.938 - 00:07:32.154, Speaker C: Right.
00:07:32.194 - 00:07:37.658, Speaker B: During the COVID They did, they processed all of the small business loans and all of that and.
00:07:37.826 - 00:07:38.906, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah.
00:07:38.930 - 00:07:57.626, Speaker B: So at high level, I think I would give the Fed a reasonable report card. And it's a really hard job. And I respect what Jay Powell has done. I do find the level of coordination a little bit concerning in the sense that treasury is supposed to be independent from Powell.
00:07:57.770 - 00:07:58.290, Speaker C: Right.
00:07:58.402 - 00:08:10.770, Speaker B: But more and more, it seems like they're ever intertwined with how they conduct policy from the treasury standpoint and monetary standpoint. And I think that's more moral hazard.
00:08:10.842 - 00:08:12.330, Speaker A: Yeah, it is.
00:08:12.362 - 00:08:18.922, Speaker B: But yeah. Do I think all of these things are going to help bitcoin? Yes. They're going to lower rates and let risk assets rip into an election year.
00:08:18.938 - 00:08:19.042, Speaker C: Hello.
00:08:19.058 - 00:08:24.578, Speaker A: Here's the question I didn't ask, but certainly I love asking. Okay, wait, so let's, how does this impact bitcoin?
00:08:24.666 - 00:08:29.882, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, exactly. I mean, they're letting people and assets moon.
00:08:29.978 - 00:09:04.898, Speaker A: Well, you know, we're heading into, there's contrast with that. There's contrast with, to your point, the bank bailouts and then something like bitcoin, the sort of long term fiscal sustainability and something like bitcoin. There's also a forthcoming, it is going to be a contrast because the halving is going to happen in April. It's a narrative event more than a like sort of data quantitative event in my opinion, at this point. But it's a big narrative event coordinated by code, decentralized network around the world simultaneously will algorithmically, incredibly tighten its monetary policy.
00:09:05.026 - 00:09:05.594, Speaker B: So amazing.
00:09:05.634 - 00:09:11.490, Speaker A: And guess what the markets say. Guess when the markets are betting rate cuts start happening March, April, May.
00:09:11.602 - 00:09:12.298, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:09:12.466 - 00:09:23.772, Speaker A: This is exactly what happened in 2020. They hiked, they expanded the monetary base as quickly, more quickly and more largely than ever before. Right. At the last having.
00:09:23.868 - 00:09:24.236, Speaker D: Yes.
00:09:24.300 - 00:09:25.900, Speaker A: So as it's what a contract.
00:09:25.972 - 00:09:27.236, Speaker B: Get this, get this.
00:09:27.380 - 00:09:28.404, Speaker A: Nice marketing event.
00:09:28.524 - 00:09:37.420, Speaker B: There's also a little bit of a contradiction at play with Fed policy once they start cutting because they're also winding down their balance sheet at the same time.
00:09:37.572 - 00:09:37.908, Speaker C: Right.
00:09:37.956 - 00:09:56.996, Speaker B: And so why are you pursuing easier monetary policy while you're pursuing tighter monetary policy over here with your balance sheet. And so there's an argument to say that eventually they're going to pause that stuff. And if that pause lines up with the first rate cut and the havening, it's going to be gangbusters.
00:09:57.060 - 00:09:57.316, Speaker A: Beautiful.
00:09:57.340 - 00:10:14.764, Speaker B: They're going to be like, the Fed is no longer decreasing its balance sheet. Then it's like, what direction is it going to go? It's going to ultimately go towards expansion, because then you can't finance this debt without MMT and all this stuff. And the arguments are just so clear and so obviously well, and it's so reflexive.
00:10:15.504 - 00:10:36.604, Speaker A: Well, everyone is gonna go. If you celebrate the holidays this weekend, you're gonna go home and probably just like Thanksgiving, your parents and your aunts and uncles or whomever it is that hopefully you're spending the holiday with, they may ask about bitcoin. It's been quite a year, and I remember last year we started this at 16. Five. And goodness gracious, it's 44k today.
00:10:37.024 - 00:10:40.344, Speaker B: It's on its way to like six digits.
00:10:41.484 - 00:10:48.036, Speaker A: Have a great weekend, bimnet, and we will actually catch you next year, my friend. So thanks so much for having me.
00:10:48.060 - 00:10:54.228, Speaker B: This year, by the way. And I want to say I appreciate all the listeners out there. It's been a great year and hopefully we can have a great 2024.
00:10:54.316 - 00:10:56.764, Speaker A: Bimnada Bibi from Galaxy Digital Trading, thank you so much.
