00:00:00.200 - 00:00:06.614, Speaker B: Blockchains are very powerful technology. There's got to be a way that they could be additive. But what are your thoughts on this topic in general?
00:00:06.654 - 00:00:55.434, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think equity securities, I think fixed income securities, I can see tokenization being valuable for both. We're seeing some of that with tokenized money market funds, things like that. But why hasn't this happened sooner? Again, I would argue it's because if you have a regulatory environment in which you don't encourage that kind of experimentation to see where does this make sense and where doesn't it make sense? We all might have ideas of things, you know, why it might make sense, so let's let that play out. But we have created an environment where no one wants to come in and say to the SEC, hey, I have an experiment I want to run. This is what I'm planning to do. I know this is a highly regulated area, so let's figure out how we can run this experiment.
