00:00:00.160 - 00:00:55.354, Speaker A: Does bitcoin look a lot different in the future, you think? I think bitcoin looks a lot different in the sense that there will be more activity building on top of bitcoin that ultimately has a timestamp down to the bitcoin blockchain. But I view this as a logical progression where a lot of these early stage projects that we looked at back in the day around things like the open assets protocol and collared coins and eventually blockstack obviously came around and there are various ways to do this and to try to tie arbitrary data down to bitcoin. Now what is different potentially this time is that you're going to have the ability to have the EVM on top of bitcoin and the EVM seems to me like it is the dominant language. This seems to me like the JavaScript of blockchain. I guess we'll see how that comes out. Obviously the Solana virtual machine will also be a factor there, but the ability to bring the EVM over I think will just bring more development into bitcoin.
