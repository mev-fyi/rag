00:00:00.280 - 00:00:04.614, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bim Netabeebe from Galaxy Trading. As always bim net. Welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:04.694 - 00:00:05.670, Speaker B: Thanks for having me on.
00:00:05.742 - 00:00:32.550, Speaker A: I love having you on. And it's been kind of an exciting like, I mean bitcoin's mostly like ranging still, but in macro we had a lot of data this week. We had ISM and ADP and it looked like there was even bitcoin was recovering a bit in the beginning of the week. But then on the back of some of the numbers it and as well as stocks and other things came down a decent amount, not like a ton, but you know what's happening. Why.
00:00:32.702 - 00:00:56.534, Speaker B: So after quarter end you had a pretty dramatic repricing of the rate complex in the front end with respect to how many cuts were priced in and the back end with respect to how much term premium is priced in. What drove that was a series of hot numbers that you got earlier this week.
