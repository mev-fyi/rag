00:00:08.039 - 00:00:12.526, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:12.630 - 00:00:13.638, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:13.726 - 00:00:21.054, Speaker A: Love having you on. And it's. You were just priming me with. There's a structural shift happening in macro. What is happening?
00:00:21.134 - 00:01:20.608, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, well, basically the Fed during the last FOMC meeting, I think, told you that they're done hiking rates and they're done hiking rates because, one, they're worried about the risks of continuing to hike and the kind of financial stability concerns which we talked about with that. But more importantly, we're seeing softening in the data, whether it's employment, inflation, some of the sentiment surveys, and not only domestically, but abroad as well. You've got Europe slowing down pretty aggressively now, China continuing to slow down. I mean, we have a chinese inflation print tonight that is most likely going to be a little soft. And if you think about oil as a barometer for global growth and the industrial complex, et cetera, it's starting to trade incredibly weak. Right now. We're at $76 a barrel on WTI crude.
00:01:20.608 - 00:01:26.286, Speaker B: Brent just broke $80 a barrel. It doesn't seem like an economy, a global economy that's about to rip and.
00:01:26.310 - 00:01:31.542, Speaker A: Have crazy inflation handle 70 handle on oil. Correct.
00:01:31.678 - 00:01:35.222, Speaker B: And this is with a whole geopolitical situation happening in the Middle east.
00:01:35.278 - 00:01:39.430, Speaker A: And you think that's, is that driven by like declining production and stuff? Is that the issue?
00:01:39.462 - 00:01:43.374, Speaker B: Is that probably mainly a function of declining demand?
00:01:43.454 - 00:01:44.070, Speaker A: That's what I mean.
00:01:44.142 - 00:01:44.326, Speaker B: Right.
00:01:44.350 - 00:01:50.038, Speaker A: Declining demand. So I don't mean production of oil, I mean of other stuff in the economy that needs oil. So declining demand?
00:01:50.086 - 00:01:55.854, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, you have like the SPR bid level that is around here.
00:01:55.934 - 00:01:59.430, Speaker A: Sorry, I didn't mean to improvise. WTI was one of the examples.
00:01:59.542 - 00:02:34.574, Speaker B: It's just a market indicator right now telling you that stuff is soft. And what you've had happen in fixed income is a broad rally, including the back end. You've had a flattening of the yield curve. Right. So you got a double whammy with supply from treasury refunding last week, but rates are starting to rally in the front end. In the back end, you're starting to price in more cut activity, the wages side of things, even though you have UAW, et cetera. I think the three month run rate on wage growth in the US is sub 3%.
00:02:34.574 - 00:03:30.762, Speaker B: And so you're just in a situation where it looks like your goals of tame inflation and full employment is kind of like within reach. And you have some financial stability concerns as well. It seems like you're getting a huge sea shift in terms of how market participants are thinking about central bankers, their response functions, and the upcoming data as well. I think a lot of the forecasters and researchers that I've been talking to, they're expecting a continuation of the slide slowdown. If you look at things like credit card spending data, the delinquencies are going up for the most sensitive groups. Same thing with the auto stuff as well. If you think about it, somebody gets into a leverage loop where they have a high credit card balance that they can't really service and high interest rates.
00:03:30.762 - 00:04:14.666, Speaker B: You're starting to see that part of the economy or that sort of segment of the population start to really feel pain. And so that's going to lead to slow down in spending, and there's a whole crisis in freight happening right now. Tons of trucking companies doing layoffs and stuff. That's impacting all sorts of things, from banking to people's jobs, et cetera. And so there's just lots of anecdotal bits and pieces of evidence that suggests that the weakness is gonna continue and perhaps even accelerate. The counter to that is as rates move lower, people are gonna wanna buy homes again and stuff. And you've actually seen that.
00:04:14.666 - 00:04:51.234, Speaker B: So the 30 year mortgage rate this week dropped 25 basis points. It was the largest drop we've had in like three months. But you know what happened? A subsequent increase in mortgage applications, the highest we've had since June. And so there's like a push pull of like, you know, when people start to overreact to some of this softening data and rates start to drop further. That is stimulative, and that does cause things to come back. So it's got to be kind of like a swing of sorts back and forth, back and forth, but high level. It seems like we're making good progress on the prices.
00:04:51.314 - 00:04:55.490, Speaker A: Last week, did they not, was there not a hire for longer? Were they talking tough?
00:04:55.602 - 00:05:01.336, Speaker B: But they want it all? Yeah, they're just like, it's really tough.
00:05:01.360 - 00:05:04.496, Speaker A: So you think it probably isn't higher for longer right now?
00:05:04.520 - 00:05:05.312, Speaker B: No, it is.
00:05:05.408 - 00:05:06.520, Speaker A: It's staying higher.
00:05:06.632 - 00:05:08.272, Speaker B: It is higher for longer, but raising.
00:05:08.328 - 00:05:10.104, Speaker A: It higher from here at the moment.
00:05:10.144 - 00:05:20.944, Speaker B: Correct. The idea that they would go again after this, like, in my head, is done. And in the, you know, FOMC pricing, I think the Jan meeting has another four basis points of hikes, which is.
00:05:20.984 - 00:05:27.340, Speaker A: Basically not a hike. Right? Yeah. And then, and then I saw, I think now they're the market is pricing what in by the spring is cuts.
00:05:27.412 - 00:05:41.884, Speaker B: Yeah. 100 basis points. That's the expectation FOMC meeting, you know, next year. Next year. So, yeah, so there's a lot of cuts. But when you think about where we're coming from, like we're 525 to 550, like cutting 100 basis points, you're still pretty, you're still pretty high. Right.
00:05:41.924 - 00:05:45.092, Speaker A: Which is what the fed wants in the state that is higher for longer.
00:05:45.148 - 00:06:10.264, Speaker B: Correct. But there are some other things. I mean, you're starting to see more commercial real estate deals go through and those valuations and those marks start to feed through. There's just a lot of things that could potentially go wrong as well. And so I think path of least resistance is now lower in terms of yields. That should be constructive for risk assets and things like bitcoin.
00:06:10.344 - 00:06:42.476, Speaker A: Yeah, it's been an interesting ride with bitcoin. We've basically been in the range since the, actually we've straight up mostly bled higher. Yeah, we're pretty firmly now in the high 34s or even the mid 35 since the gamma squeeze we talked about now two or even three weeks ago. I'm forgetting, I think maybe two weeks ago, it's just been higher lows the whole time, but still struggling to break above 36. Do we have another leg higher in us before ETF announcement?
00:06:42.580 - 00:07:10.808, Speaker B: This kind of price action tells you that there are dip buyers. This kind of price action tells you that the pain trade is higher. I don't think there's been participation from the hedge fund community in a meaningful way. And most folks are under allocated. Even the crypto native folks that you talk to that are crazy bullish. All the people that I'm in chats with and communicating with, nobody has had this on like, oh, I'm gung ho crazy bullish bitcoin. I'm going to max allocate to it.
00:07:10.808 - 00:07:50.694, Speaker B: And the issue is everybody gets benchmarked to it, right. It's the most liquid thing in crypto and it's up over 110% with a great sharp. And it's got further upside because there's an impending catalyst. And so everybody that has this tool in their toolkit from a macro standpoint, from a crypto standpoint, is just looking at this and is underperforming this thing. Every ticket goes higher. And so that's why this thing has like such a strong bid on dips. And secondly, this is an asset whose value is determined by where people are willing to transact it.
00:07:50.694 - 00:08:22.462, Speaker B: There's sellers for miners, et cetera. But high level. When something gets to a value point or a critical mass in terms of ideas, bitcoin's value is now 35,000 to tons of people that trade money around. And the market makers determine where prices are set at the margin and stuff. But once something has value, it's tough to take that away. And God forbid we're back in a bull market and these equities and stuff. And so people are feeling good about owning risk assets.
00:08:22.518 - 00:08:27.874, Speaker A: Yeah, it feels like you combine it with the changing in the rates, environment, you got a bitcoin halving next year.
00:08:28.374 - 00:08:29.198, Speaker B: It's like the perfect.
00:08:29.246 - 00:08:36.182, Speaker A: You've got the catalysts, which could cause inflows and not enough people own it. It does. It feels strong right now.
00:08:36.318 - 00:08:39.824, Speaker B: It feels strong and normally stronger, stronger.
00:08:39.934 - 00:08:43.020, Speaker A: Than it basically has since we started this podcast.
00:08:43.132 - 00:09:15.542, Speaker B: Well, this is what we've talked about. There's a convexity to the thought, right? Right. And so once you get to that critical mass, right, it just starts to feed on itself. The positive price action is a positive feedback loop into the asset itself. Because your thesis gets rationalized, you're like, oh, my God, this is actually working. Getting validated brings other people in. And so we've talked about this, and so that's kind of, I think, where you're at, and it's a wonderful place to be.
00:09:15.542 - 00:09:40.440, Speaker B: And normally when you feel really great about something and it's gone your way, you're supposed to sell something like take profits, et cetera. But clearly, everybody that's felt good about this thing took some profit, and all of a sudden it's like all those profits that you took, you're underwater on them. And so this is what happens when an asset performs so well, especially late into the year, where you have, like, performance, you know, effects.
00:09:40.512 - 00:09:41.256, Speaker A: Yeah, right.
00:09:41.320 - 00:09:51.444, Speaker B: That's like you're a hedge fund manager, you're a venture guy, you're a crypto business. Anything you know in crypto gets benchmarked to this. So it's just. It just gets tough. And every tick higher is.
00:09:52.304 - 00:10:19.668, Speaker A: Last year we saw, we ended the year bleakly, right? FTX collapsed, like mid or early November. We bled down all the way down. I think we started 23 at about 16, five. But that also helped because then it was everyone saying, oh, base effect, fresh performance, base effect, low base. And we lifted off through March, after around the SVB collapse, we hit 30k. So it almost doubled in a couple.
00:10:19.716 - 00:10:23.580, Speaker B: Months earlier this year, God forbid we had the ETF when we had the banking crisis.
00:10:23.772 - 00:10:30.860, Speaker A: I mean, you talk about money flying out of the banks going into money market funds. A lot of it would have ended up in a bitcoin ETF.
00:10:31.012 - 00:10:33.140, Speaker B: I think a ton. Yeah, a ton of.
00:10:33.212 - 00:10:42.356, Speaker A: It's gonna be an exciting time. I'm happy we've got Bimnet Abibi here to talk with us about it. And of course, we'll continue to talk about it. Bimnett absolutely.
00:10:42.420 - 00:10:45.300, Speaker B: One of these days, I'd like to go off on just the BoJ. Okay.
00:10:45.332 - 00:10:50.364, Speaker A: We'll do a Bank of Japan episode. Bimuth BB from Galaxy trading, my friend, thank you so much. Have a good.
