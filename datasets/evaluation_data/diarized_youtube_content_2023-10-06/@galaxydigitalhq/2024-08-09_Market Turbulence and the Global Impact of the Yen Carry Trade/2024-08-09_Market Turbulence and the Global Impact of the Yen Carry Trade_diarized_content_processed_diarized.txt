00:00:07.520 - 00:00:12.254, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, Bimnett Abibi from Galaxy training. As always, Bimnett. Welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:12.342 - 00:00:13.134, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:13.182 - 00:00:18.054, Speaker A: We're back. We are here in New York City. I haven't been in this city for over a month.
00:00:18.182 - 00:00:19.222, Speaker B: I haven't left.
00:00:19.366 - 00:00:23.262, Speaker A: There you go. You've been tied to the desk, I'd say chained. Chained.
00:00:23.326 - 00:00:24.062, Speaker B: Imprisoned.
00:00:24.166 - 00:00:25.422, Speaker A: Well, that's what let's talk about.
00:00:25.446 - 00:00:26.174, Speaker B: Incarcerated.
00:00:26.262 - 00:01:00.898, Speaker A: Let's talk about it. Because it was sleepy, then it was bullish. Leading into Nashville. And Nashville, we touched 70k on bitcoin on the back of former President Donald Trump's speech in Nashville. And then we were mostly okay last week, and then over the weekend, and even at the end of last week, some deleveraging started to happen. And then, of course, there was a pretty major crash in equities, in, in cryptos, in bitcoin on Sunday night, Monday morning. Yeah.
00:01:00.898 - 00:01:03.550, Speaker A: In FX. What happened?
00:01:05.530 - 00:01:09.434, Speaker B: Yeah. So there's just so many things to talk about.
00:01:09.602 - 00:01:11.914, Speaker A: Let's start with Japan, though. What happened with the yen?
00:01:12.002 - 00:02:06.294, Speaker B: So, basically, for the past year and a half dollar yen has been steadily inching higher from, let's say, the 130s all the way up to 161. Right. And that's a function of the fact that us interest rates and other g ten interest rates were significantly higher than japanese interest rates. Japanese interest rates were below zero, essentially, and they were slowly raising them by ten basis points and a little bit more. But essentially, because of that huge interest rate differential, folks were constantly longing dollars and shorting yen and earning the carry. The most popular carry trade was Mexyn, where super high interest in Mex and super cheap cost to borrow on the yen. And so there are a lot of folks piled into the trade.
00:02:06.294 - 00:03:16.930, Speaker B: Over the past year, the BOJ has tried a handful of times to intervene, but ultimately it failed because the currency just kept going higher. And so it reached new highs. And so going into the BOJ meeting last week, they were expected to hike rates and slowed their bond purchases and broadly take a step back from all the easing measures that they have. And they came out more hawkish than expected. Basically, that started a huge deleveraging in that complex high level. What the carry trade is in the context of the BOJ is folks borrow yen at super cheap levels, then they sell it short to go buy a different currency, and then they go buy an asset with that currency. And so basically, there's a lot of money that was in Japan that got moved offshore because there's no place to actually earn any substantial interest on that money.
00:03:16.930 - 00:04:20.230, Speaker B: And so over the past 1520 years, there's been a lot of money just going from Japan offshore to purchase these assets and to conduct this quote unquote, carry trade. And what happens when the yen starts massively appreciating is your liability starts ticking up in value. And then in addition, when the asset that you've purchased also starts going down in value, let's say us equities or commercial real estate, whatever it may be, like you got hit with like a double whammy and then margin calls and then cycle of deleveraging. And so you basically had the start of a very big unwind. The way I describe it is this dollar yen trade, like basically front end interest rates in Japan have been sub 1% for my entire lifetime, basically. And so that carry trade has been building for 20 years. And over the past week, two weeks you've had an unwind to that, but it's just getting going.
00:04:20.230 - 00:05:09.008, Speaker B: And so all these dollars that have flown offshore and to the US, et cetera. And basically what's happening is these corporates need to bring back some of the money home and these pensions, et cetera. And so this repatriation flow has caused a bid to the yen and it caused risk assets to sell off. Now the risk asset sell off is a function of the BOJ stuff, but it's also a function of the data that you got in the US. And the data has constantly been slowing on a consistent basis here in the several months now. Yeah, a couple of months. And you had this non farm payrolls print on Friday that showed material weakness in the labor market even though it was a gain of like 113,000 jobs.
00:05:09.008 - 00:06:21.142, Speaker B: Like the private sector component was particularly weak. And we've seen some other jolts and other kind of labor market indicators that are softening. And typically the concerns around the softening labor market are super important because the Fed has a dual mandate, the inflation and full employment. In instances where unemployment starts ticking up, that starts to trigger like, holy shit, am I going to be on the wrong side of my mandate? And that specifically was what Powell highlighted during the last FOMC as something that would trigger him to be more dovish or to remove restrictive measures of a monetary policy. And so everyone is focused on the labor market because if it cracks right then the Fed will be forced to be more dovishde. And now kind of what the read through was from that soft print was that you could potentially be heading into like a hard landing scenario. And that's based on the fact that typically, when you see unemployment rise by 50 basis points or so, you're likely gonna see there's normally a bimodal distribution, basically.
00:06:21.142 - 00:06:44.554, Speaker B: So you're most likely gonna see a big uptick in unemployment. And in addition, when you think about what actually causes a severe downturn in the market, it's really tough for the market to slow down without people losing their jobs because as long as people have their jobs, they have a stream of cash flows. They can meet their mortgage payments, they can meet their credit card payments automatically.
00:06:44.562 - 00:06:49.722, Speaker A: They buy stuff at the mall. A lot of them will get a 401K contribution, correct? Yeah.
00:06:49.906 - 00:07:07.308, Speaker B: And so when you start to see that slow down in the context of rates already being super restrictive, that can actually lead to a pretty big slowdown. And so folks started to price in more of a hard landing scenario, more of a recession probability, and then the.
00:07:07.324 - 00:07:09.820, Speaker A: BOJ hiked rates more than expected.
00:07:09.900 - 00:07:18.500, Speaker B: Also, there was chatter about going 25 basis points. Now, you've had a bit of a retracement in that move because one of the BoJ governors came out last night.
00:07:18.540 - 00:07:19.520, Speaker A: He said, don't worry.
00:07:19.870 - 00:07:26.902, Speaker B: You know, we're obviously going to consider, like, basically financial conditions. Like, they're not going to hike rates when, like, the topics is down 10%.
00:07:27.006 - 00:07:31.606, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, they were on, on our Sunday night there, Monday morning, they were limit down.
00:07:31.678 - 00:07:31.958, Speaker B: Limit down.
00:07:31.974 - 00:07:32.694, Speaker A: Circuit breakers.
00:07:32.782 - 00:07:33.166, Speaker B: Yes.
00:07:33.238 - 00:07:42.318, Speaker A: Like, people remember during COVID the only time in our recent lifetimes that that's happened was like March 2020 during COVID where they literally halt the entire stock exchange.
00:07:42.334 - 00:07:48.142, Speaker B: Yeah. And you know, just to give you some context, like MUFG. Like Mitsubishi Financial.
00:07:48.206 - 00:07:49.246, Speaker A: Biggest bank in Japan. Right.
00:07:49.278 - 00:07:52.042, Speaker B: Biggest bank in Japan was down 20% Monday night.
00:07:52.126 - 00:07:52.458, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:52.514 - 00:07:57.426, Speaker B: If I told people in the US that JP Morgan Chase was down 20%.
00:07:57.498 - 00:07:59.874, Speaker A: It would be financial chaos in this country.
00:08:00.042 - 00:08:01.978, Speaker B: Okay. That's the polite way of putting.
00:08:02.034 - 00:08:13.602, Speaker A: Yeah. That's the largest bank in the world, right? JPM, I believe one of them by asset, but yeah, there's measures. Yeah, sure. But yes, this is a big deal in Japan. What, the fourth or fifth largest economy by GDP? Fourth, I think.
00:08:13.706 - 00:08:19.082, Speaker B: I think depends on if you put block EU as one or not.
00:08:19.146 - 00:08:28.542, Speaker A: Somebody was asking me, they're like, oh, my God. Like something blah, blah, blah can happen in Japan of this much of a thing. Like. Well, to be clear, it's literally like the top economy in the world.
00:08:28.606 - 00:08:29.414, Speaker B: Yes, absolutely.
00:08:29.462 - 00:08:47.182, Speaker A: And it was also the only. Let me just step back, actually. I want to talk about the carry because just to what I'm hearing from your explanation, borrow cost, the cost of capital in Japan was basically zero or very low. So it was a great thing to borrow. You had almost no interest payments to make so you could borrow.
00:08:47.246 - 00:08:53.006, Speaker B: And in addition, what was happening was you borrowed that thing, but it was.
00:08:53.038 - 00:08:56.222, Speaker A: Also depreciated until recently. It was weakening.
00:08:56.286 - 00:08:56.510, Speaker B: Correct.
00:08:56.550 - 00:09:07.566, Speaker A: So your repayment was actually going down. You were paying almost nothing in principle, borrowing cost. And the value, the total principal of your repayment was getting cheaper over time.
00:09:07.598 - 00:09:11.890, Speaker B: Depends if you were using it for. But that was the whole.
00:09:12.190 - 00:09:18.998, Speaker A: So people were loading up, though, going there for effectively liquidity. Cheap borrowing is similar to when we had basically zero rates.
00:09:19.054 - 00:09:19.646, Speaker B: Correct.
00:09:19.798 - 00:09:54.396, Speaker A: But in general, there's were even sub, like real unreal terms over negatives. Negative. So sometimes you're getting paid to borrow and then they're using that to buy other things like risk assets, like equities, us tech stocks. Right. And so to unwind this trade, you just like you have to back out of all the things you have to sell what you bought, use that to rebuy the yen that causes the equities to go down or the other assets. I mean, if you bitcoin, then it would be bitcoin that goes down. Well, no, not really because this is really, what are we talking about? Large institutional traders, hedge funds, big, like.
00:09:54.428 - 00:09:58.404, Speaker B: Japanese pensions, like real money type of deep, big capital.
00:09:58.572 - 00:10:00.320, Speaker A: But that means even a specific.
00:10:01.340 - 00:10:01.772, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:01.836 - 00:10:03.684, Speaker A: Okay, so now that this has happened.
00:10:03.852 - 00:10:04.860, Speaker B: And it's just beginning.
00:10:04.900 - 00:10:08.932, Speaker A: Okay, so, yeah, what does that mean? I mean, basically, do we expect a lot more, like over time?
00:10:08.996 - 00:10:09.660, Speaker B: Yes.
00:10:09.820 - 00:10:18.352, Speaker A: So is it merely a weakening bid that used to be be here because of that Kerry trade or is it like going to be, is it sell pressure?
00:10:18.496 - 00:10:45.318, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think what you're going to see is these real money types. Like, they're not stupid. Right. They're not going to sell assets when they're puking at the dead lows. Right, right. And so it's going to be a methodical kind of unwind of some of those trades and they'll slowly, you know, happen over time. You had the kind of dramatic, like margin I calls and kind of big aggressive move, taking out all the speculators, blah, blah, blah.
00:10:45.318 - 00:10:59.382, Speaker B: And now you'll just see like a slow trickle of that stuff. But it really depends on like one like, you know, how aggressive the BOJ is going to be, the data in Japan and stuff, if things start to cool.
00:10:59.446 - 00:11:09.064, Speaker A: Part of the reason, right, I mean, for the hike here is that they are dealing with their own inflation. Correct. So just like us, they've got to do something to keep their inflation down for their population.
00:11:09.192 - 00:11:20.380, Speaker B: Yes, but they also have a big debt issue where if they hike rates too much, then the interest that they're paying. And so it all leads to bitcoin. But let's be honest.
00:11:20.920 - 00:11:41.860, Speaker A: I was gonna say, gosh, it's like a Rube Goldberg machine. When you create a machine with pulleys and baskets and all that thing where it's this overly engineered system, it's just extremely complicated ball of wires where you're like, oh, crap, we got to do this thing to do that thing. But if we do that thing, then this other thing is going to happen.
00:11:42.020 - 00:12:19.020, Speaker B: Yeah, you're right. It's like, you can't have, I forgot what the analogy is, but you can't have a free floating currency and centralized economy. That's where the issue lies. And so if they did nothing, their currency would have kept depreciating and they would have to constantly intervene and the market would have bought it up. So then they are like, well, we have to back away from these stimulus measures and raise rates back to real levels. And then, holy shit, what happens? You get a massive deleveraging event and your currency appreciates way too quickly. It leads to asset sell off.
00:12:19.020 - 00:12:46.216, Speaker B: Because think about this. Japan's economy, they run a huge current account surplus. All of their corporates earn money abroad. They sell cars in America. And Toyota technology. Yeah, Toyota takes those dollars and so they have their net long dollars. And so when dollar yen collapses and the yen starts appreciating, like, that's some mark to market loss for those guys holding the dollars.
00:12:46.216 - 00:12:56.320, Speaker B: And so, like, yeah, I mean, there's a good reason why the topics is down and Nikkei is down, et cetera. And so it's all kind of like intertwined in a way.
00:12:56.400 - 00:12:57.440, Speaker A: Pretty wild, too.
00:12:57.560 - 00:13:42.158, Speaker B: But realistically, what does it come down to? And what are the lessons you can take away from this? The lessons are you've got a huge, complex financial market that's basically driven by central banks and the liquidity that they inject the facilities they have. And it's a super controlled thing. And ultimately, there's just so many unintended consequences of some of the policies that we've just done. People like to think that it's proactive policy, but they're just reacting. It's like those machines with the groundhogs, they come up and the alligator head.
00:13:42.214 - 00:13:43.718, Speaker A: Or whatever, you hit one and the.
00:13:43.734 - 00:14:27.698, Speaker B: Other one comes up and you hit the other one, it's like, boom. And it's like think about it now, in the US, it's like, okay, you start easing, you take rates to 3%, what happens? Some would argue that that means you're going to be back on the path of reinflation in short order. Because people then start being like, holy shit, I can actually afford a mortgage now. Maybe I'll start buying houses again. Maybe they'll unfreeze the housing market and asset prices might start going up again. It just leads to this endless loop of financialization that makes you be like, what is really the value of money? And what are these central bankers actually doing?
00:14:27.754 - 00:14:35.634, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're tinkering perpetually. And again, that's the system, like, forced to do that.
00:14:35.722 - 00:14:52.482, Speaker B: Yeah. And so, like, that's why, like, the value proposition of bitcoin in these instances, like, gets, gets highlighted at the same time, though. And what I would remind listeners is that, like, it is still a financial asset.
00:14:52.546 - 00:14:52.930, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:53.010 - 00:15:04.052, Speaker B: And when risk assets trade to one correlation, like, there's no risk asset that is safe. And I'll give you the example of gold. During 2008, it was still down.
00:15:04.156 - 00:15:07.332, Speaker A: I mean, gold was down. On Monday it was down two plus percent.
00:15:07.436 - 00:15:08.284, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:15:08.452 - 00:15:12.140, Speaker A: It was down. On Friday it wasn't down the 15 that bitcoin went down.
00:15:12.180 - 00:15:14.956, Speaker B: But you have geopolitical concerns because I saw this.
00:15:14.988 - 00:15:23.580, Speaker A: Peter Schiff and others were dunking on bitcoin. So much for store value and a risk off move. It went down.
00:15:23.960 - 00:15:25.392, Speaker B: But that's also what happens to gold.
00:15:25.456 - 00:15:50.456, Speaker A: And it's also separately, the bitcoin bet isn't that you can't engineer a global decentralized store of value from zero to one. Like magic. Like it's currently capitalizing. It wouldn't have growth potential if it had already become a stable store of value. Right. Like part of the bitcoin bet today, if you invest in bitcoin, is a bet that it will become that in the future. It's obviously still in its infancy in its early stages, so it didn't seem fair that dunking to me.
00:15:50.528 - 00:16:42.296, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm not going to entertain anything Peter Schiff says, but ultimately I do think that you do want to be in hard assets like gold and stuff. And the US, Japan, everywhere has its own challenges. China is dealing with a massive slowdown right now. Their property market is under a ton of pressure and it's being masked and stuff. And that's the second or third largest economy, however you want to think about it. And then in certain places, they've tried all these efforts to get inflation to come down, but it's still going higher and there's just so many different problems out there that to be honest, I hope that bitcoin is an answer for this stuff, but it's not the answer.
00:16:42.488 - 00:16:50.776, Speaker A: There's a lot of other factors here. Do you think the Fed markets are pricing in five cuts now by the end of 525 bps cuts by the end of the year?
00:16:50.808 - 00:16:53.208, Speaker B: People are, it's come down a little bit.
00:16:53.224 - 00:17:11.200, Speaker A: Okay. Well, there was some freak out in the streets market and it's closer to, but some people are calling Japan's more aggressive than expected hike a grave policy error. I've seen other people calling the Fed's lack of a easing cut last week a grave policy error.
00:17:11.280 - 00:17:11.952, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:12.136 - 00:17:22.276, Speaker A: What should the Fed do in your mind now? Should they definitely cut some amount in September? Some people were even talking earlier this week when there was panic a little bit in financial markets that there should be an emergency cut.
00:17:22.388 - 00:17:22.772, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:22.836 - 00:17:24.000, Speaker A: What's your view on that?
00:17:25.500 - 00:18:12.176, Speaker B: I think it's pretty clear from the data and what we're forecasting that rates are probably too restrictive already and that you should be closer to neutral. And neutral depends on what your idea is. But let's say that's 3%, three and a quarter somewhere around there. And so, you know, traditional monetary policy analysis would tell you that you should get to neutral as soon as possible. And so I would tend to agree with them that they probably should have started cutting in the July meeting. But it doesn't really align well with kind of how the Fed does things. Like Jackson Hole is typically when they announce like a big policy shift, it's also just the election makes things a little weird and stuff.
00:18:12.176 - 00:18:23.968, Speaker B: And so I do think that they should have been reducing. I'm not a fan of the emergency cuts because the economy is still fine, growth is still fine. The unemployment rate's only at 4.3%.
00:18:24.144 - 00:18:30.720, Speaker A: And like, major us stock indexes are still up like ten to 15% on the year. It's not like we're in a terrible.
00:18:30.800 - 00:18:32.096, Speaker B: No, we're not downturn or anything.
00:18:32.128 - 00:18:36.600, Speaker A: We're not in a, yeah, so it would signal weakness that isn't actually there to do an emergency.
00:18:36.720 - 00:18:51.406, Speaker B: And I prefer a fed that isn't panicked when there isn't any reason to panic. But I do think that they should be cutting and I think they should, I believe, just front load the cuts, scope for 50.
00:18:51.438 - 00:18:52.446, Speaker A: 50 50.
00:18:52.638 - 00:18:55.718, Speaker B: And then we're, and then you're at neutral and then you observe.
00:18:55.774 - 00:18:56.558, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah.
00:18:56.614 - 00:19:07.990, Speaker B: Right. Yeah. Like it's a difficult kind of place to, I don't want to be Jerome Powell. He has one of the hardest jobs on the planet.
00:19:08.030 - 00:19:09.350, Speaker A: He handles it with quite poise.
00:19:09.390 - 00:19:10.742, Speaker B: I mean he does, he does quite.
00:19:10.766 - 00:19:11.650, Speaker A: A lot of poise.
00:19:12.030 - 00:19:23.158, Speaker B: But it's, whatever you do, there's a consequence to it. And it's like if you ease too early, we just came from a period where inflation got to 8%. Are you concerned about that?
00:19:23.214 - 00:19:23.542, Speaker A: Oh yeah.
00:19:23.566 - 00:19:30.134, Speaker B: If you don't ease, oh, the deficit, the national debt, and people are gonna start losing jobs like crazy.
00:19:30.182 - 00:19:45.932, Speaker A: And let's be real, the central bank, regardless of whether they are part of the us government or not, they're not. They are part of America. The national debt does matter to Jay Powell and the rest of the 20,000 Federal Reserve employees. So they can't hike forever. That's just a fact.
00:19:45.956 - 00:19:46.548, Speaker B: No, they can't.
00:19:46.604 - 00:19:48.348, Speaker A: That's a fact. Numbers don't, they don't add up.
00:19:48.364 - 00:20:06.772, Speaker B: But it's like ultimately where are we headed? It's like MMT world. Huge debt to GDP, the Fed constantly buying the Treasuries that Treasury, the US treasury issues. And anytime shit goes crazy, everybody wants a bailout, everybody wants a stimulus.
00:20:06.796 - 00:20:09.996, Speaker A: Well, and they've conditioned the market for that unfortunately.
00:20:10.108 - 00:20:11.800, Speaker B: Literally money.
00:20:11.840 - 00:20:12.016, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:20:12.048 - 00:20:13.800, Speaker B: They just send people money.
00:20:13.960 - 00:20:21.488, Speaker A: Yeah. You couldn't even like it. I was gonna say, cuz if you. It's not like they mailed a check that you choose not to deposit. Just appeared.
00:20:21.584 - 00:20:22.112, Speaker B: Just appear.
00:20:22.176 - 00:20:30.672, Speaker A: Use your tax, your tax refund, correct dollar bank account information to just literally airdrop it into your account.
00:20:30.816 - 00:20:43.998, Speaker B: Yeah. And then, oh, inflation isn't gonna come from that. Like literally here's free money hindsight. You're like what? How on earth did you guys think. Not to mention that wasn't going to cause look, it was one of the biggest policy blunders.
00:20:44.134 - 00:21:02.702, Speaker A: It really was. Think about like $800 or I think what most people got or something around you got three of them. Okay, so like $2,000 now that probably helped during those, during for about a month or two, but at the expense of effectively net 30% price inflation over three years. No one if they could.
00:21:02.726 - 00:21:05.934, Speaker B: But it wasn't even just that though. You had the PPP loan.
00:21:05.982 - 00:21:06.718, Speaker A: No, no, for sure.
00:21:06.814 - 00:21:07.838, Speaker B: The student loan forgiveness.
00:21:07.854 - 00:21:11.822, Speaker A: But I'm just saying like it seems so nice. The stimmies seem nice.
00:21:11.926 - 00:21:12.350, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:21:12.430 - 00:21:17.134, Speaker A: But I would have absolutely given that money back to not pay, you know, $15 for a breakfast burrito.
00:21:17.302 - 00:21:17.998, Speaker B: I agree.
00:21:18.094 - 00:21:31.822, Speaker A: I mean I think most people would now, but it's. But it is kind of funny to make fun of the populace a little for demanding the bailout, demanding the stimmies, and then being like, why do we have inflation? It's like, well, it's like, if we all agreed to not spend it.
00:21:31.846 - 00:21:33.790, Speaker B: Oh, it's the corporate. Their price gouge.
00:21:33.830 - 00:21:37.254, Speaker A: No, dude, we all went out and spent that money on, like, GameStop stock.
00:21:37.302 - 00:21:43.446, Speaker B: No, no, no. Let's just do universal basic income. Just spend people money and, like, fix problems.
00:21:43.598 - 00:22:09.540, Speaker A: But, yeah, well, we will catch up with you again. There's more to come here. Obviously, bitcoin and crypto is repriced a bit lower. But, I mean, fifty six k. And still, you know, if you told me we crashed to year ago, if someone had busted in here while we were recording, we would have laughed at that. So I urge people to have some perspective. By the way, equity is also, like I said, I mean, if you're a passive equity investor, like most Americans are, 10% still doing fine.
00:22:09.540 - 00:22:17.776, Speaker A: But it did seem scary. It feels like that Monday of this week will be a pretty famous market day. People will remember that day.
00:22:17.888 - 00:22:30.092, Speaker B: They will. But it wasn't even that crazy. I mean, the japanese moves were crazy. Emergency cup pricing is crazy. But I don't know, I feel like just so desensitized because I work in crypto.
00:22:30.196 - 00:22:52.594, Speaker A: There was that thing where it was like, there's all these memes going around where it's like a little baby, and he's crying and it says -5% and then it's like, minus. They're giving baby shots, is what I saw. And a bunch of them are, you know, they get a shot and they cry. It's what a baby does. Usually when they get a shot, it's like, stock investor -5% and then there's this one of a baby getting a shot, and he just doesn't do anything. Just looks at the doctor like this, and they're like, crypto, like, -75% he's just, like, unphased, completely.
00:22:52.732 - 00:22:56.210, Speaker B: But we don't have a central bank to bail us out. Well, let's go.
00:22:56.590 - 00:22:59.814, Speaker A: No, we don't. Let's go back into crypto next week a bit more.
00:22:59.862 - 00:23:00.446, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:23:00.558 - 00:23:08.990, Speaker A: There have been some interesting things. Bitcoin dominance, a bunch of interesting sort of things happening there. But we are over time. So, Bimnet, my friend, thank you for coming on. Galaxy brains, thank you.
