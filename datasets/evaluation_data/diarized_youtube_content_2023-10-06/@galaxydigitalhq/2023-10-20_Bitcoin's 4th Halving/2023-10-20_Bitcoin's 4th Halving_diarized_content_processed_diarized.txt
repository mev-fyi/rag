00:00:00.120 - 00:00:49.264, Speaker A: What are miners doing to prepare for this upcoming halving that is going to happen in April of next year? Just generally. Really good question. What are miners doing? I think miners are shoring up their balance sheets. I think miners are restructuring debt. I think miners are preparing to operate in an environment that's less conducive to this 98% to 100% uptime that we've seen in the past and more conducive to optimization of free cash flow for the business with a lower uptime. And so ideally, like, miners are staying alive. Miners are staying alive with worsening economics going to the halving unless there's some catalyst that changes those economics prior to, I think, mid April of next year.
