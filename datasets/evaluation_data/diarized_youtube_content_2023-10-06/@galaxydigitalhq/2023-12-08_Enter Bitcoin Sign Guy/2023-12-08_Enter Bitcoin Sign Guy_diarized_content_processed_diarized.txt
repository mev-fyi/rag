00:00:00.320 - 00:00:33.394, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guests, Christian Langelis, bitcoiner known as Bitcoin Sign Guy, and also founder of Terrell Corporation, which is building a lot of stuff, including a new implementation for the Lightning Network. Christian, welcome to Galaxy Brains. Thank you for having me. I've wanted to have Christian on for a while. I've known Christian for a while. At this point, we're also going to talk a bit about urbit, which we'll get into even what that is. I don't even want to preface it, but, Christian, you've been involved and interested in bitcoin for a long time, and as I mentioned, you did a publicity stunt, and I apologize.
00:00:33.394 - 00:00:36.394, Speaker A: You must have to start every podcast you do with this discussion.
