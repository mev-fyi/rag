00:00:10.120 - 00:00:20.518, Speaker A: Welcome back to the infinite jungle. I have with me, Izzy, be a contributor to the light O'Dow as master of validators. Thank you for being on the show, Izzy.
00:00:20.646 - 00:00:21.782, Speaker B: Thank you very much for having me.
00:00:21.798 - 00:01:02.772, Speaker A: Christine, I am very excited to talk with you. I think this is the first, the first representative of the Lido Dao, of a Lido Dao member coming onto the show. And I have to start off this show by asking, what is it that you do? Your title says, obviously you're contributing to Li da Dao, but specifically you're the master of validators. And I think that always sparked my interest. Every time I looked at your Twitter profile, every time I saw you speaking at a panel, I was like, what does that title even mean? So please give us a little, you know, sate my curiosity and let me know. What does that mean? What does it, what do you do at Lido?
00:01:02.908 - 00:01:51.690, Speaker B: Absolutely. Very, very happy to, and oddly enough, I can't even take any credit for that title. It was thought up by the person who was doing this role, basically ad interim before I joined. So Felix Luch from, who used to be at chorus one, and he basically thought up the role. And the weird thing about it is it doesn't mean anything specific, but that's also the great thing about it. I really do a little bit of everything, but my work focuses on node operators and how do they use the lido protocol? So maybe just to quickly set a little bit of context here. And why do I differentiate between Lido down the Lido protocol? When I say Lido protocol, I basically mean the set of software that is running on Ethereum.
00:01:51.690 - 00:02:37.354, Speaker B: And when I say Lido Dao, I mean the DaO, the decentralized autonomous organization that currently basically helps this software and this protocol operate, because there's a lot of things that we can't currently do, like completely ossify the protocol, make it non upgradable because Ethereum keeps upgrading. So Lido needs to be able to keep up and stuff like that. But to that effect, basically, I'm a contributor that leads a set of contributors. We call ourselves the node operator mechanisms team. And what we try to do, well, maybe also to explain something else. I think of Lido as a protocol that basically has two core sets of users. One set of users are the stakers, so called so people who utilize STE as an asset.
00:02:37.354 - 00:03:21.074, Speaker B: But the other users are node operators. They use the protocol to run validators through the protocol for the Ethereum network. And those validators underpin basically the other product STE. We're responsible for things like node operator UX, like user experience for making the mechanisms that have to do with how node operators utilize the protocol and how the protocol rewards node operators for the services that they provide effective, efficient and sustainable as possible. So a lot of what we do kind of like centers around mechanism design. Everything that we try to do is based on incentives. Like we don't use things like legal contracts to control node operators because we can't.
00:03:21.074 - 00:03:55.276, Speaker B: Like, we're a real DaO. There's nothing that says that, like this node operator has an SLA and if I call them at 03:00 a.m. They need to pick up. Mostly they'll pick up because they don't want me to yell. But the really, really important thing here is that we act as almost like grease in an engine. The node operators are powering this engine and we are there to help it be more effective, more efficient, and to also cater to another set of stakeholders which aren't direct users of the protocol, but are basically beneficiaries of the protocol, which is the rest of the network and the rest of the staking community.
00:03:55.420 - 00:05:02.100, Speaker A: We should talk about simple DVT, which you mentioned in your response there. It's a big step for lido to finally launch the simple DVT module. Based on what you were saying about you really focusing on the node operator part and the mechanism design and the incentive design for node operators on Ethereum or on Lido, could you talk about the preparations and the mechanism design that you had to think through for launching the simple DVT module? I think I saw the way that rewards are broken down in simple DVT is slightly, slightly different from the basically the curated module. The curated module, the original or the normal way that people normally stake through Lido. So could you talk about designing this for a different set of node operators, clusters of node operators that would be running pretty novel staking software. Talk a little bit about that process and what you guys had to think through there.
00:05:02.242 - 00:06:07.344, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely, gladly. So I will take one step back just to provide some context around what are modules. So Lido V two is the upgrade, the current iteration of the Lido protocol, which was launched in May of last year shortly after the Ethereum Shapala hard fork to bring on board, not only as a core feature towards users withdrawals, which were unlocked with shapala, but also a kind of re architecturing, if you want to think about it that way, of the internals of the protocol. So like you put it, Lido started out with a permissioned or curated set of node operators. It started with very few operators, only five at the time of the genesis of the protocol, and steadily grew over time. That's one of the other things that node operator mechanisms helps with, is that we help the DAO, kind of like do due diligence on node operators when they apply. We don't actually select them, but we facilitate this process around, you know, identifying and possibly selecting through DAO votes new node operators.
00:06:07.344 - 00:06:47.930, Speaker B: It grew, I think at the point of sapella it was at 29 or 28 node operators, it's now at 37. And so these node operators constituted the curated operator module. But we always knew that there needed to be other ways for node operators to participate in the lighter protocol apart from just being selected by a committee. So there's been a long ranging research project. For example, how do you turn node operator selection into something like a market? We're not there yet. In terms of the maturity of the tooling that is available on chain. To be able to do something like that, you need to bring in a lot of information off chain on chain.
00:06:47.930 - 00:07:47.694, Speaker B: You need to have ways to verify that the information is correct, that you're doing the right kind of algorithmic selection around it, but it's something that's still running as a research project. But in the meantime, we knew that we wanted to add these new avenues for node operators to participate. One of the avenues that we wanted to add from the beginning, even though this is a little bit misunderstood sometimes, is that we always envisioned that there would be permissionless ways for node operators to use the Lidar protocol and run validators. DVT is something a little bit in parallel, but is also influenced by that. So DVT is the idea, distributed validator technology that multiple node operators can basically co run a validator much the same way that multiple users maybe co run an address through a multisig. It's a little bit more complex than that, but that is the basic idea. So you spread not only the operational, the technical risk of running a validator, but you might also potentially split the financial collateral that somebody might need to put up for running a validator.
00:07:47.694 - 00:08:28.538, Speaker B: So DVT protocols can be effectively used once you have permissionless entry, to also lower barrier to entries for solo stakers into protocols. So eventually the vision that we're working towards is not only permissionless staking, but also permissionless staking with DBT, if that's what node operators want. So simple. DVT is the culmination of, I think, around two years of testing on testnets with DVT infrastructure providers. Currently on Mainnet, there are twelve clusters. Clusters are just sets of participants that together would be running validators. It's unlocked using oval technology, but at the same time we were running an SSV testnet.
00:08:28.538 - 00:09:45.324, Speaker B: SSV testnet just formally finished yesterday actually, and we should be releasing the very good results regarding it within the week. That means that SSV powered clusters will be joining simple DVT on Mainnet within the next couple of weeks. Basically in the beginning we started with a really, really basic idea. Can we use DVT to run validators through the Lidr protocol? That's what the first testnet ascertained. The second testnet was, can we do this at scale? So can we, like node operators and lidar for example, are running hundreds or thousands of validators? Can these protocols really take up that amount of scale and validation? Three. Do these protocols work well with all of the other ancillary mechanisms around staking so things like mev boost right now, or PBS or however that might be implemented. And the most recent testnet basically had to do with can we do this by entrusting node operators and clusters to be almost like autonomous in the way that they approach this, by really making it kind of like a self help thing or doi thing, or do they need to be more tightly managed? And the great news from the testnet was that it turns out they don't need to be really, really tightly managed.
00:09:45.324 - 00:10:43.954, Speaker B: And we've figured out a ways to, at least for a pilot. Simple DVT isn't exactly like a pilot, but it's small scale to make it financially viable. And that's what leans into the thing that you were talking around earlier, where we've parameterized somewhat what the reward share looks like for simple DVT. So the curated module works pretty simply. There's like 100% of staking rewards on a daily basis, and 10% of that then goes into the module, where 50% of that 10% goes to the DAO treasury and 50% of that goes to the node operators for simple DVT. Because initially this module is going to be running much fewer validators than the curated operator module. The node operators there will be receiving an increased share of those rewards, and also potentially because the infrastructure provider themselves, like SSV or Oval, might want to be taking a small piece of that share so that it can further fund development efforts and things like that.
00:10:43.954 - 00:11:01.374, Speaker B: Obviously this is also important because as validators are run by clusters, there's more people participating, but the fixed cost of running nodes, if you're running one validator, like 100 is relatively the same. It only starts increasing in a stepladder effect once you start running thousands and thousands of valid.
00:11:01.414 - 00:11:50.732, Speaker A: Gotcha. Two, a couple quick points of clarification. I think I, yeah, had lost you a little bit in one of the, in a couple of areas when you were explaining that. The first was you had mentioned that the validators are, they have like a lower financial barrier to entry with DVT. So lido validators don't have any collateral at stake. They don't need any capital upfront to be, to validate on to run validators on Lido. Is that different for DVT validators on Lido? As in, do they have to have a certain amount of capital at stake in order to run validators on lido? Is that one of the differences that you're highlighting or.
00:11:50.788 - 00:11:56.004, Speaker B: That's a great question. So for simple DVT, no, simple DVT validators are also bondless.
00:11:56.124 - 00:11:56.556, Speaker A: Okay?
00:11:56.620 - 00:13:01.174, Speaker B: Node operators do not need to put up any capital as collateral because simple DVT is also semi curated. So basically we use the testnet participation as like a litmus test for which operators are ready to participate on Mainnet. And so it's not completely permissionless. Like you need to have participated in the Testnet and you need to have done well in order to be eligible to be formed in a cluster. Once you marry DVT with a permissionless staking module, like the community staking module, which is currently in development and was approved by the DAO I think, back in December, then you can use the idea of DVT as a means to effectively lower the bond. So if in CSM, for example, you might say that a node operator needs to put up, I'm just going to pull up a number like two and a half ETH to run a validator with DVT, because it's much harder to compromise an entire cluster versus just one operator, you might be able to meaningfully reduce that bond. What you do need in those cases is like some way to be reasonably ensured that the cluster isn't just one person and like four sock puppets.
00:13:01.174 - 00:13:04.250, Speaker B: But there are ways to do that.
00:13:04.402 - 00:14:32.216, Speaker A: Yeah, we had talked to the puffer team on this show a few weeks back, and they're definitely one of the teams that are also trying to get those minimum slashing or like trying to get those minimum requirements to run to be a node operator on permissionless thinking protocols down to as low as possible, if not non existent. But yeah, it's definitely a worthwhile research initiative to pursue and definitely something to keep considering or keep working on. Yeah, that was also one of the things that made it clear that this launch of simple DVT is quite in very early stages, 99.5%. The rest of the vast majority of Ethereum staked is staked through the vetted 37 and node operators in the curated module. And it's really a very small amount of stake right now. Just to get it started, I want to ask one more question around the reward structure that you had mentioned, part of it going to Ol and SSV. But before I do, just quickly, how? I mean, assuming that all of the clusters for oval goes well, and assuming that in the next couple months when you do the performance analysis, you notice that, you know, the performance of these DVT validators are as strong as our cluster, our 37 node operators.
00:14:32.216 - 00:15:00.940, Speaker A: Assuming that that performance, you know, happens, is comparable, how quickly do you think that the limit that the Lido Dao is going to vote to increase the limit from 0.5 to say like 2%? I know it'll, there's still quite a lot of innovation and of course lots of research still ongoing. But I'm curious to know how quick you think that number is going to go up over the next, before the end of the year or something.
00:15:01.052 - 00:15:37.826, Speaker B: That's a great question. So if all goes well, right? I think it can go up relatively quickly. Like it can go from 0.5% to 1% within the year. It might take a little bit longer for it to go to like 2%, but that's mostly an operational challenge rather than like a limit tweaking one. So there's operational, I guess, like it's not a difficulty, but it's just very onerous. For example, like the way that the current interaction between simple DVT and the DVT protocols works is like, it's not fully automated.
00:15:37.826 - 00:16:38.440, Speaker B: The fact like how do you spin up validators? How do you pre generate the keys and assign them to the clusters? Do you want to maximize the number of total new participants, or do you just want to maximize the number of validators per cluster? Initially we were really trying to go in the vein of maximizing participants. So basically bringing net new node operators to the protocol, because even though they might be running a small amount of total validators, what this does is it opens up the doorways for them to participate, like in the permissionless module that will hopefully come out by the end of the year by having not only proven their track record, but also being familiar with the protocol and then eventually also apply to other modules where the curated sets importance might go down from 99 point something percent to eventually something like 60%. So you might have fully fledged DVT modules within two years that work in a way more automated manner in terms of how fast can clusters be spun up, how easy is it to match participants without having to take them through a testnet first and things like that.
00:16:38.632 - 00:16:56.804, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's not just about the number like increasing the number, it's about making sure that the underlying operations can scale so that they can take on more stake in a way that Opal and SSV can have as little kind of direct involvement as possible.
00:16:57.824 - 00:17:20.884, Speaker B: And that kind of goes back to mechanism design. You don't want to sit and hand pick hundreds of operators. You want to come up with something a relatively automated way that's scalable. The first thing that we're doing though is making sure that it works. And I have really, really high hopes and all the testnets show that it will and getting people familiar with it. And once people are familiar with it, we can start to build these scaling processes.
00:17:21.214 - 00:17:54.554, Speaker A: I see, I see. All right. Yeah, I mean, it's still an exciting first step and yeah, definitely curious to see how it continues to evolve. One last question around the simple DVT and then we'll get into some very rapid questions around protocol design on the Ethereum protocol level. But you had mentioned that the oval rewards, the way that it's structured for simple DVT is that 8% goes to node operators and then 2% goes to oval SSV. The DVT software providers, is that right?
00:17:55.694 - 00:18:17.594, Speaker B: Not exactly, but let me clarify. So the total number of rewards that goes to the module is still the same. It's 10%. The split is different currently for Ol. It's for oval related clusters is a better way to put it because they're not in separate modules. 2% goes to the DAO, 1% goes to ol, and 7% goes to each cluster.
00:18:18.274 - 00:18:23.354, Speaker A: 7% goes to each cluster. 1% goes to the lido DAO, 1%.
00:18:23.394 - 00:18:25.530, Speaker B: Goes to oval and 2% goes to liteodao.
00:18:25.642 - 00:18:29.934, Speaker A: 1% goes to Opal, 2% goes. And then for the curated.
00:18:32.154 - 00:18:47.088, Speaker B: It'S 8% to the clusters. So SSV doesn't take an explicit rewards cut. However, you need SSV tokens to run nodes on the SSV network and so this kind of like balances that out. And 2% goes to the dow.
00:18:47.256 - 00:18:50.136, Speaker A: I see. And then for the curated it's five and five.
00:18:50.240 - 00:18:50.976, Speaker B: Correct.
00:18:51.160 - 00:18:55.056, Speaker A: Gotcha gotcha per operator, per validator.
00:18:55.200 - 00:19:04.764, Speaker B: Like percentage wise you make more, but you're also splitting it with another seven people. Right? And so you would need to run a lot more validators to make the same amount of absolute revenue.
00:19:05.384 - 00:19:19.096, Speaker A: Oh, fascinating. Okay, so each individual validator in the cluster is making less, even though the total amount of rewards being earned by that entire cluster is, say, higher for a node operator that might not be in a DVT cluster.
00:19:19.160 - 00:19:19.888, Speaker B: Yes, exactly.
00:19:19.936 - 00:19:53.794, Speaker A: Oh, fascinating. Okay, and do you think those incentives are sustainable for people to join through the simple DVT module as opposed to the curated? Because from that dynamic, it does appear that more professional staking node operators would by far continue to try and get vetted through the curated module path as opposed to the simple DVD path, even though the simple DBT path might be easier to, I guess, like run through if there's more available spots there.
00:19:54.174 - 00:21:00.392, Speaker B: That's a really good question. So simple DVT by itself, like any node operator that is participating, it's definitely not the idea that you're making a loss. It should be break even or according to current numbers, you'll be making a profit, but it won't be an obscene profit. But the idea is that this is a stepping stone into something else in future DVT based modules if you have proven participation in simple DVT on Mainnet, it's almost assured that you will basically be able to participate, if not earlier than anybody else, at a very, very good level. Because you have proof of reputation, which is the most important thing in this space, you will be able to run way more validators because you have essentially a proven track record not only for running validators, but also running validators via DVT. In terms of does it make more sense to join the curated set? Like in general, yes. But because these new modules are coming out, there's new ways to run validators, I don't think it makes sense to keep increasing the curated set at the same pace as we have in the past.
00:21:00.392 - 00:21:17.464, Speaker B: You want to reduce the total amount of exposure that the protocol has to the curated set and increase the amount of exposure that it has to other types of modules, like permissionless modules or DVT based modules, or ideally, eventually permissionless and optionally DVT based validators.
00:21:18.204 - 00:21:50.488, Speaker A: Interesting. Yeah, it does seem at the moment the curated set is the most scalable operationally, but I can see how working on this and taking the time to do this and hopefully scale those operations will ensure that increases to the curated that can happen a lot slower as the amount of ETH staked going into lido increases, you can have the rails to really be able to move some of that into these other more decentralized modules. Yeah, that's fascinating.
00:21:50.536 - 00:22:35.004, Speaker B: Maybe something just to really add to the last point. So there's already an organic stake reallocation process within the protocol when withdrawals happen. If, for example, somebody wants to withdraw a large amount of money or there's a lot of withdrawals over a certain period of time, it's possible that there's like an overage in the withdrawals because at some point somebody made deposit. And then, like, deposits are used to nut up withdrawals and you have a stake that cycles back into the protocol. The way that the Lido protocol currently works is that new modules that are not at capacity always receive the deposit priority. So once newstake comes back into the protocol, it will go to, even if it came out of the curated module, it'll go to simple DBT first.
00:22:35.744 - 00:22:38.024, Speaker A: And so until the 0.5% cap.
00:22:38.064 - 00:23:09.684, Speaker B: Until the 0.5% cap. Correct. And so as you add modules or increase the limits to modules due to just like organic processes of staking and unstaking, stake ends up like, evening out and maximizing whatever modules have capacity. And the same thing has also happened in the curated module where a lot of people were like, well, you have these five operators that joined at the beginning of their protocol. They're going to make so much more money than everybody else. But the way that deposits were allocated is that new operators always received deposits first.
00:23:09.684 - 00:23:40.950, Speaker B: And so if you look at the stake distribution of the Lido protocol right now, and I think that really this is like one of the amazing achievements is it's almost flat right now. So you have 37 operators who are almost all running the same amount of stake based on their own capacity. Right. Like, if somebody wanted to grow a little bit slower, they grew a little bit slower. This is great. Not only from a robustness perspective, spreading stake around the world, around different types of infrastructure. Some operators have on premises data centers, some people are running on cloud, some people are running on local data centers.
00:23:40.950 - 00:23:53.994, Speaker B: And also from a client and software perspective, you're pushing the stake out and making it as decentralized as possible, not only from a geographic perspective or an entity perspective, but also from an infrastructural perspective.
00:23:54.314 - 00:24:34.544, Speaker A: Yeah. The newest module always gets the. Or the newest, yeah, joiner. The newest module or the newest node operator that's been added gets to have first picks on their, or gets to receive the incoming stake first, and to confirm from the steeth holder perspective, you are getting rewards accrued into the pool from all the different modules. So all the node operators, all the modules, you are obvious. All the details around where exactly the rewards are coming from are obfuscated, as in you're not getting just the rewards from the staking module, only you don't get to pick and decide. But it all goes into a pool.
00:24:34.544 - 00:24:38.632, Speaker A: And from that pool, that's where the steed holders get their rewards.
00:24:38.768 - 00:24:49.204, Speaker B: I would say it's abstracted and maybe not obfuscated. Like if you want to follow it all you can because it's on the blockchain and that's the really great thing. But yes, it's abstracted away from the user and the choice is simplified.
00:24:49.664 - 00:24:50.928, Speaker A: Yeah, there is no choice.
00:24:51.016 - 00:25:21.674, Speaker B: There is no choice. There's always been an idea that maybe you want to pick your own module. Like I want my stake to go there. It's not something that the protocol currently supports. And there's questions around, if you allow this to happen, can something bad happen, right? Like somebody creates an operator and they send all the stake there. And then it turns out that operator is like a wolf in sheep's clothes or something like that, or is regulatorily captured by a bad government. And so in theory, this current mechanism prevents that from happening.
00:25:21.674 - 00:25:52.494, Speaker B: But eventually it may make sense to do this. And there's an allowance in the staking router design that eventually something like this might be possible and might be doable. But also in general, if you look at networks where like normal deposits, delegated proof of stake networks, when you let users pick, you kind of end up with like a beauty competition. And you have a couple of validators at the top that are like receive all the stake and then like a long tail of validators at the bottom that don't receive a lot of stake. And that's not so great for decentralization.
00:25:53.954 - 00:26:46.938, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I guess also in the sense of like if the vetting process and if the quality of all of these operators are technically the same, because that's what, you know, the Lido Dao or oval and SSV or all these people are, have already gone through, why would you kind of just leave it up to the user? I guess if it's like a little bit more the user must stake at their own risk. They have to do the due diligencing, they have to do the. I can see why you may want to give more freedom to the user, but I think it makes sense in the current structure and the design for sure. So I have two very quick questions for the last just couple minutes of our talk, and this is related to some of the upcoming changes in Electra that are coming up in the next upgrade. Very quickly. I know you mentioned Shanghai.
00:26:46.938 - 00:26:59.618, Speaker A: The Shanghai upgrade was really what launched Lido V two and withdrawals were, were enabled a few months after Shanghai went live. So technically, a few months after the protocol really supported staked ETH withdrawals.
00:26:59.666 - 00:27:02.402, Speaker B: Yeah, one month. After almost one month. Yeah.
00:27:02.498 - 00:27:23.516, Speaker A: Thanks. Yes. How quickly do you think Lido is going to be ready for validator consolidation when it goes live for electra? Is it something that you have high confidence this time around? Lido will be ready from day one, or tell me a little bit about preparations that are going into that and your confidence on Lido's readiness for.
00:27:23.660 - 00:27:58.226, Speaker B: Really, really great question. So apart from validator consolidations or so called max effective balance, there's also, of course, triggerable exits, which is also something very, very important for the protocol to be ready for. So EIP 7002. Let me talk about that really, really quickly. Triggerable. It's an important one because they essentially give staking protocols a little bit more power back. Previously, if somebody was a node operator and they were running a validator and they were doing a very bad job, or knock on wood, something happened and the validator kept running, but they weren't there to technically revive it.
00:27:58.226 - 00:28:45.800, Speaker B: Let's say this validator could basically be awol forever. Triggerable exits allow withdrawal credentials. So basically the address that is tied to a validator on the execution layer to send a signal to the beacon chain and say please exit this validator. And this is also great from a permissionless staking perspective, because it really reduces one of the risks, which is that you might have malicious node operators which hold a certain amount of principal stake ransom and say, you're never going to get this back unless you pay me whatever, 99.9% of the value. On the other hand, this changes the power dynamic between staking protocols and node operators. Now that protocols can basically effectively kick out node operators if they don't like them, it really changes the relative strength.
00:28:45.800 - 00:30:07.556, Speaker B: Let's say that node operators have it in this dynamic, one of the really, really important things there is to enfranchise the DAO and stakers to give them the ability to maybe disagree with DAO decisions around this. There's been a huge research effort which is now culminating, and actually there's a snapshot vote running on this. I think that went live yesterday for Lido, dual governance and the idea is to empower Steve holders to potentially veto LDO governance decisions that they disagree with. And this might include kicking out a node operator, it might include changing the fee structure, it might include even adding a certain node operator, or for example, exiting a subset of validators for whatever reason that the DAO may want to do, but the stakers may disagree with. So one of the core priorities for DAO contributors right now is to make sure that given that there is a functionality which is crucial for permissionless staking, in my opinion, and so therefore crucial for Lido to also implement as soon as possible in order to allow node operators to participate in Lido if they want to, you also have to offer something to offset this additional risk, let's say from a node operator perspective or from a protocol perspective, and re enfranchise stakers. So dual governance is a huge priority. The permissionless staking module is another huge priority.
00:30:07.556 - 00:31:10.734, Speaker B: And then that leaves maxib or validator consolidation. The spec is still very largely in flux. So when the spec still first came out, everybody was pointing towards consensus layer only consolidations. And that's really not great from a staking protocol perspective. But it looks like now that there's appetite, especially after a lot of thinking solutions kind of weighed in, that we may or very hopefully end up with execution layer triggered consolidations, which means that the protocols will be able to control via the withdrawal credentials when consolidations happen and how consolidations happen. Another thing that's really, really great about the evolution in the current spec and Max B is it looks like initial and therefore minimum slashing penalties maybe decreased. There was a fear amongst, especially amongst node operators, like less so protocols, but especially node operators, that why would we run like 2048 balance validators if like, yes, slashing is very improbable, but if it happens, it's really, really going to hurt.
00:31:10.734 - 00:32:08.924, Speaker B: And like, you know, if we need insurance against this, there's no way this wouldn't put us out of business. So it's looking that that's also going to happen. There are some things that may not happen, like automated sweeps may not make it in, or there's also a question around how partial withdrawals are going to work. Exactly. Like do you always withdraw the full amount or can you withdraw something less than Maxi B -32 and those things would have been great for staking protocols as well, but they may make it in future. AiPs, will the lighter protocol be ready for Max EB on pectoral launch? I think the more these kinds of things, like the more features that are boons for staking solutions make it in the more likely it is that the Lidar protocol will be ready on day one. However, there's a lot of work that goes into validator consolidation, especially from an accounting perspective.
00:32:08.924 - 00:32:55.054, Speaker B: I don't think it's probably going to happen day one. Consolidations will be supported. Like, I'm a huge fan, we need to get it done so that we can have a single slot finality. But I don't know if we can happen day one. It'll probably happen a few months after, especially given that the current efforts are focused on a permissionless staking. So like delivering on a belief in a core value proposition that Lido dial hub contributors have had from the beginning, 7002 and as a result of 7002, dual governance and like Pector is probably going to come out somewhere between December and February. I think we're not going to make the November date and so I think that's already quite a bit on the plate.
00:32:55.714 - 00:33:35.544, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm curious. Yeah, we're definitely going to have to touch base again about the dual governance aspect of Lido v three, but it is very exciting things and I really think that with Petra specs still up in the air, there's really only so much Lido can do right now other than participate in the conversations, try and obviously share with developers what really makes sense for staking pools. But until those specs are finalized, I'm sure that for the Lido team to implement and test all of that, that can really only get started once the client implementations are ready.
00:33:36.464 - 00:34:04.724, Speaker B: And you already need like two months for audits. So if you think about it that way and then work backwards, it's really, really difficult. And lido contributors have very, very stringent requirements on things like protocol upgrades. We need at least two audits. All of the audits that we're doing now have formal verification and invariant testing and stuff like that. And so that's kind of stuff that cannot be rushed even if you wanted it to. It just sets certain kind of like minimum type frames.
00:34:05.064 - 00:34:11.804, Speaker A: Yeah. And by lido contributors you do mean like the LDO token holders, right. And everybody else that's.
00:34:12.344 - 00:34:18.960, Speaker B: Yeah, and everybody that's like paid by the lido, paid by the dao to help develop things.
00:34:19.112 - 00:34:44.500, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. I feel like sometimes these terms, if you're not in crypto, it can feel a little bit confusing. But I really appreciate the time, Izzy, and I thank you for, you know, just so like meticulously going through all the details of how this works and what simple TVT is and some of the next steps in your thoughts around the electra upgrade. Yeah. So thank you. Thank you so much for the time.
00:34:44.500 - 00:34:45.380, Speaker A: This was a great conversation.
00:34:45.412 - 00:34:49.908, Speaker B: We didn't get to issuance, I guess, which is unfortunate, but maybe some other time.
00:34:50.076 - 00:35:01.634, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, we'll definitely get to issue. I'm sure it'll become a larger topic. I feel like right now it's still. It's early. It's early days anyways. All right, well, thank you so much. Yeah.
00:35:01.634 - 00:35:37.954, Speaker A: Thank you so much to everyone who is listening to this episode of infinite Jungle. We hoped you learned something new about Ethereum and especially about Lido. We will be back with another episode next week. So until then, fellow explorers, please stay safe out there.
