00:00:08.320 - 00:01:03.890, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. We burst into burst with the music we're making see me at the finish line to take rings and learn about the power with a new Blake king. Cause I'm breaking chains pull your steak up easy verbal golesee and I'm fire breathing wired, never tired like I'm flying through the breezy flip a couple coins see me spitting on the tv and I don't slip dipping in my whip yo I'm souping up my wheels like I'm pushing through a bit put my cold heart into space rocket man like Elton slamming every hater like Ben Shelton and I'm done up y'all can see me on the run up ain't a drop shotgun to keep me from the come up no hovering in place take a walk real far yo I'm covering the space like a blanket in the stars as always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmware research at Galaxy Digital. Thank you for listening to Galaxy brains. We have a great show for you today. As I said, blake King from Galaxy's bitcoin mining team is our guest. We're going to get deep into Texas power markets how bitcoin affects energy grids.
00:01:03.890 - 00:01:42.814, Speaker A: It is a very interesting conversation about electricity that I know you'll enjoy and learn a lot from. I certainly did. And of course, we'll check in with our good friend Bimnet, a BB from Galaxy trading, as always, to talk markets. But before we get to all that, I need to remind you to please refer to a link to disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. I love this episode. I think bitcoin mining and electricity are extremely misunderstood. They're much more complicated than the media will have you believe, and Blake is one of the world's foremost experts in the combination of the two.
00:01:42.814 - 00:01:50.450, Speaker A: Let's get right into the show. Let's go now to our friend Bimnett, a BB from Galaxy Trading. As always, Bimnett, welcome to Galaxy Brands.
00:01:50.522 - 00:01:51.370, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:01:51.442 - 00:02:16.868, Speaker A: So it's some exciting stuff has happened just since we last talked. BTC pretty much retraced the entirety of the grayscale pump from last week, which, you know, I think a lot of people kind of expected. The ETF stuff was very anticipated and thus probably priced in in a lot of ways. But we also just had another announcement or headline from Kathie Wood and Ark and 21 shares are filing for an ETH spot ETF.
00:02:16.956 - 00:02:17.228, Speaker B: Correct.
00:02:17.276 - 00:02:19.624, Speaker A: Just a few minutes ago. It's Wednesday, September 6.
00:02:20.124 - 00:02:20.636, Speaker C: I don't know.
00:02:20.660 - 00:02:21.664, Speaker A: Is that a big deal?
00:02:22.324 - 00:02:44.964, Speaker B: I think it is pretty meaningful because we've seen a bunch of ETF like futures ETF filings, and the logic of the grayscale versus SEC decision was pretty clear. If you approve the futures product, there isn't much of a difference between futures and spot, at least mathematically.
00:02:45.344 - 00:02:47.160, Speaker A: And they said that. They said mathematically.
00:02:47.232 - 00:03:03.344, Speaker B: Mathematically, there is no difference. And so if we're making the assumption that futures ETF is going to get approved, the next logical conclusion is a spotty tF. And much like our guest from last.
00:03:03.384 - 00:03:05.376, Speaker A: Week, Eric James Safer.
00:03:05.440 - 00:03:21.512, Speaker B: James Safer, sorry. I agree. I'm a little shocked that there haven't been more filings for spot ETF especially. And I do think it's more likely an inevitable type of situation. Cause all these guys, they see each other and then it's one thing after the other one.
00:03:21.528 - 00:03:35.016, Speaker A: There was that Bloomberg story, even at this point a couple months ago that said that the SEC was poised to not block those futures ETF. So I'm shocked that a spot wasn't filed sooner, to your point.
00:03:35.080 - 00:03:54.550, Speaker B: Yeah, but here's the other aspect of it. I mean, ETH is dramatically smaller than bitcoin, and there is much more institutional demand for bitcoin as the story that resonates more with folks. And so I do think that some of the bigger players are just focused on bitcoin.
00:03:54.582 - 00:03:55.910, Speaker A: Just one in front of the other.
00:03:56.022 - 00:04:16.366, Speaker B: Yeah, well, one front in front of the others. It's also like you want to want to have products that people want to trade. Right. People want to trade the bitcoin stuff. The demand for the ETH stuff is not in the same magnitude. Not that it won't be, but at least at the moment when trying to do a cost analysis, I do think.
00:04:16.390 - 00:04:27.870, Speaker A: Some of your bigger players, you got to do education and get it out on both platforms. Okay, so let's talk about other stuff. Cause one of the other macro stories I saw is that the dollar is just really on a pretty big crusade over the last couple months.
00:04:27.902 - 00:04:28.550, Speaker B: No, absolutely.
00:04:28.662 - 00:04:32.074, Speaker A: Pumping up higher. What impact does that have? What does that mean?
00:04:32.934 - 00:04:34.714, Speaker B: There's a lot of implications.
00:04:36.094 - 00:04:38.590, Speaker A: Can we start with why? Why is the dollar going up?
00:04:38.622 - 00:05:32.304, Speaker B: The dollar is going up because more folks are believing in a higher for longer stance in terms of interest rates in the US. In addition, it's literally the best house on the worst street right. Japan is stuck at negative interest rates. There's a property bubble that's bursting in China, and they're actively easing and they're cutting interest rates. In places like the UK, you're having a wage price spiral. In Europe, you've had softening of data material, softening of data manufacturing and services, et cetera, versus here in the US, we just had an ISM services that just beat to the upside. Powell's preferred measure of inflation, which is super core PCE surprise hire the week before.
00:05:32.304 - 00:06:10.886, Speaker B: And then most importantly, in terms of this last real leg in the dollar, I think it's a function of energy prices. And we're seeing crude top dollar, 88 a barrel, Brandt top dollar 90 a barrel. They have cut, they're committed to, to keeping that supply off the market. Comes out to like 2 million barrels per day, et cetera. But we're producing oil at like COVID levels right now. And that's on purpose because they have a quote unquote monopoly on energy markets.
00:06:10.950 - 00:06:16.834, Speaker A: Okay, so that's some of why it's been happening. But what are some of the implications of a stronger dollar? I know there was some fears.
00:06:17.224 - 00:06:56.258, Speaker B: So a stronger dollar means that for any commodity importing nation, that the commodity prices are a lot higher. So if you're importing a lot of oil, oil price went up and the dollar exchange rate went against you. And so it's like doubly compounded. And so for nations that are generally consumers of commodities, it's pretty bad. And so that's a major implication. In addition, there's a lot of dollar based debt. And so the higher the cost of that debt as a function of interest rates going up and your currency rate going against you, that fundamentally is going to lead to lower growth.
00:06:56.258 - 00:07:06.042, Speaker B: In addition, over 50% of s and P earnings are abroad. And so you're going to see earnings take a hit just from the FX impact.
00:07:06.138 - 00:07:06.578, Speaker A: Wow.
00:07:06.666 - 00:07:21.354, Speaker B: So if you're in a world where growth is slowing because of things like in China, et cetera, and you are getting hurt on the FX side, I think it's pretty bad for stocks in my head.
00:07:21.394 - 00:07:29.786, Speaker A: And I guess what most things too, that are, I mean, anything priced in the dollar essentially gets more expensive. Yeah. And so that also includes just assets of all types. Right.
00:07:29.810 - 00:07:53.730, Speaker B: It gets so, yeah, I mean, dollar strength, you know, typically means the risk off. Risk off. Yeah. But, yeah, there's a lot of implications. And the question is, like, can it continue? And absolutely all of the structural forces are there. Like as long as Japan is stuck in negative interest rates, their currency is going to get challenged. And so they're out there talking about currency intervention again.
00:07:53.882 - 00:07:54.218, Speaker C: Right.
00:07:54.266 - 00:08:24.486, Speaker B: China's actively trying to defend their currency too. And so it's got broad ranging implications. But the beauty about the dollar right now is it's just such a great safe haven play. Cause you get paid to belong. The thing, it's positive carry to belong dollars. And it's a hedge for shit blowing up. And so it's, you know, we've spoken about this before, but it takes on these unique set of properties that become almost self fulfilling.
00:08:24.550 - 00:08:25.206, Speaker A: Right.
00:08:25.390 - 00:08:50.622, Speaker B: And so that's kind of where you're at. And you're testing major levels across, you know, tons of different currencies. I mean, euro looks like it wants to break 107. I think 165 was the low on the year. We're talking about 147, 148 on dollar yen, you're thinking about 150. And currency intervention, like right now, I think cable is, you know, an absolute sale. I think it's like 126 and change.
00:08:50.622 - 00:09:30.104, Speaker B: Like it's, you know, it's going to go back down. But then, in addition, you're also having some of the most popular, like, currency trades in the world, which is long carry. And these things like Mex and Brazil, those are starting to get unwound now, too. And so there's like technical and things that are helping the dollar. And on top of that, you have the Fed that seems like they're reasonably intellectually honest. And so when oil prices go higher, that's going to lead to increased higher headline inflation and core, because you can't strip out the energy impact. But to give you an idea, the Cleveland fled.
00:09:30.104 - 00:09:36.544, Speaker B: Now cast for August CPI is a 0.79 month on month.
00:09:37.324 - 00:09:37.964, Speaker A: Wow.
00:09:38.084 - 00:09:50.204, Speaker B: Right. Annualize that, you're talking about 910 percent annualized on the August number. That doesn't even have the big spike. Well, it does have a reasonable spike in energy prices, but you're going to get another one in.
00:09:50.284 - 00:09:50.964, Speaker A: More is coming.
00:09:51.044 - 00:10:13.164, Speaker B: Potentially more is coming. And so if you're telling me the Fed is going to be looking at 0.79 inflation prints like and they're thinking about ending hiking policy, seems unlikely. Seems so unlikely, yeah. In what world would they have thought? They hiked 500 plus basis points, 525 in short order new year.
00:10:13.204 - 00:10:13.788, Speaker A: I was just gonna ask.
00:10:13.836 - 00:10:39.642, Speaker B: Engaged in QT, and we're a year later and we're about to print a .8 month on month headline CPI number. You could make a reasonable case that they're like, monetary conditions are not even remotely restrictive right now. Home prices are still holding up? Well, you've had moderate crack in the labor market, but, like, people are still spending money. Inflation is still high.
00:10:39.738 - 00:10:48.224, Speaker A: Phineas was just telling me where he lives in Brooklyn. They're just, there's more. Bunch of luxury stores opening up. People are spending money at all luxury stores all around them.
00:10:48.354 - 00:10:50.404, Speaker B: Yeah. Eventually that has to slow.
00:10:50.484 - 00:10:51.684, Speaker A: You have to think so, right?
00:10:51.724 - 00:10:59.284, Speaker B: Yeah, but at the end of the day, I mean, it's. Have to think back to the magnitude of money creation that happened.
00:10:59.364 - 00:11:01.468, Speaker A: I guess that's. It's just there's still so much out there.
00:11:01.516 - 00:11:06.804, Speaker B: So much. I mean, you printed trillions of dollars and you sent it directly to people.
00:11:06.964 - 00:11:08.372, Speaker A: They literally mailed it to people.
00:11:08.428 - 00:11:12.084, Speaker B: They literally mailed it to people. It's not like in certain instances.
00:11:12.164 - 00:11:40.466, Speaker A: What's this thing? Did you see this thing about the, you know, there was the program where you could get a big funding from the feds if you didn't fire people. I forget the name of this program, but yeah, as an employer and like, people are still. There's an. I read a story in the journal a couple days ago about companies that have sprouted up to help, like consultant in companies that have helped, helped sprout up to help. Employers still be claiming this money. And it's like they've now claimed over 180 billion of this money. Yeah.
00:11:40.466 - 00:11:45.730, Speaker A: More than double or something. What Congress, like, it's just there's still. They're still pumping money.
00:11:45.922 - 00:11:48.650, Speaker B: They are. I'll tell you, it's crazy.
00:11:48.722 - 00:11:49.746, Speaker A: People are still doing this thing.
00:11:49.770 - 00:12:01.666, Speaker B: No, people are still doing it. And like one of my strategists I talked to, there's still a reasonable amount of fiscal impulse left from all these programs and all that money that it's gotten spent over the next quarter.
00:12:01.730 - 00:12:02.002, Speaker A: Right.
00:12:02.058 - 00:12:03.466, Speaker B: Like, which is insane.
00:12:03.530 - 00:12:04.362, Speaker A: They're still spending.
00:12:04.458 - 00:12:07.010, Speaker B: But there's also a lot of fraud and abuse in those programs.
00:12:07.042 - 00:12:07.314, Speaker A: Totally.
00:12:07.354 - 00:12:13.786, Speaker B: And the fed. I'm sorry. And the treasury and IR's and all those people, they're coming after it for sure. But you're still.
00:12:13.810 - 00:12:22.420, Speaker A: But in the meantime, it's out there. It's getting out there still. Yeah, I mean, in the IR's stuff, there's def. Remember there was the. What are they called? PPE. Yeah, PPP.
00:12:22.532 - 00:12:23.396, Speaker B: PPE loans.
00:12:23.460 - 00:12:25.860, Speaker A: PPP program or whatever.
00:12:25.932 - 00:12:26.492, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:12:26.588 - 00:12:31.172, Speaker A: There was tons of fraud in that. I mean, that's what these people. But that money got out into the economy. A lot of it.
00:12:31.308 - 00:12:54.376, Speaker B: Well, here's the big concept here, is that when you stimulate to people that have an insanely high propensity to spend that money goes into the economy, right? Then that money as a multiplier versus when you give money to, let's say, folks with a lot lower propensity to spend, aka rich people, then that money.
00:12:54.400 - 00:12:55.080, Speaker A: Put it in assets.
00:12:55.152 - 00:13:01.124, Speaker B: They put it in assets and it's got much lower velocity. And so what we did is we did the most supercharged version of it.
00:13:01.544 - 00:13:02.400, Speaker A: And we got inflation.
00:13:02.472 - 00:13:06.744, Speaker B: We gave people checks in the mail to literally even better.
00:13:06.784 - 00:13:16.092, Speaker A: They just dropped them right into your account. You didn't even need to apply. Yeah, I think they used your prior tax info. It just showed up. Ridiculous.
00:13:16.268 - 00:13:23.700, Speaker B: And so like, yeah, like there are going to be unprecedented, like, consequences to that. And it wasn't just domestically that happened.
00:13:23.732 - 00:13:25.820, Speaker A: But I agree. No, everyone did that.
00:13:25.892 - 00:13:41.460, Speaker B: It's like, oh, my God, in Europe, energy prices are real high. Don't worry, we'll print more money. We'll subsidize the cost. Don't worry about it. They were saying that there are consequences. You make more money, the value of things relative to those dollars will increase because you're just increasing the demand.
00:13:41.612 - 00:13:44.196, Speaker A: Very simple. It's super simple, supply and demand.
00:13:44.220 - 00:14:08.100, Speaker B: And now I will tell you, the most important thing we talk about today, I think in this context, is fiscal dominance. I kid you not. I saw one or two central bankers getting interviewed about. So Congress is going to have another huge deficit. What are you thinking about? Might get worse. What are you guys thinking? There's a shutdown possible. What are you guys thinking about the fiscal.
00:14:08.100 - 00:14:18.898, Speaker B: And these central bankers stand up there and they're like, we can't control fiscal policy. That is a policy of Congress. So our job is to react to it. But more and more like, the one thing I believe about, that's what you.
00:14:18.906 - 00:14:23.154, Speaker A: Mean by fiscal dominance, that fiscal actually runs the sort of the market, especially.
00:14:23.234 - 00:14:43.320, Speaker B: When you have a constraint like, yeah, the government spends so much money that at a certain point, if they were to spend that money and fund it in the open market, it would cause havoc. And so the central bank has to print money to buy that at a certain point. And at a certain point, their decision making with respect to how they set.
00:14:43.392 - 00:14:45.256, Speaker A: Interest rates, it's like their hands are tied.
00:14:45.320 - 00:15:00.136, Speaker B: Their hands are tied by the ability or the necessity to absorb that supply. Not tied, but that's impacted. But then that's not an official mandate to accommodate insane levels.
00:15:00.160 - 00:15:03.128, Speaker A: You literally have to do it to control the absolute situation.
00:15:03.296 - 00:15:16.596, Speaker B: But my issue is like, they're so smart, they can see how disjointed Congress is. They can predict deficit spending pretty well. You know what? Don't predict it. Use the CBO's fucking estimates.
00:15:16.700 - 00:15:17.092, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:15:17.148 - 00:15:21.172, Speaker B: Like, oh, you want to claim that? You don't want to get involved in that.
00:15:21.228 - 00:15:21.668, Speaker C: It's fine.
00:15:21.716 - 00:15:32.188, Speaker B: Use the Congressional Budget Office and tell me, how are you going to respond to that? Three, four years of trillion plus dollar deficits. You're not definitely going to be doing QT.
00:15:32.236 - 00:15:33.316, Speaker A: You mean look ahead, right.
00:15:33.340 - 00:15:39.666, Speaker B: Don't react and tell us. But if they did, then that would.
00:15:39.690 - 00:15:41.490, Speaker A: Cause bigger problems because we wouldn't like what we heard.
00:15:41.522 - 00:15:46.234, Speaker B: We wouldn't like what we heard. But they're all so smart and they can do math for about five years.
00:15:46.274 - 00:15:47.094, Speaker A: Oh, my God.
00:15:47.754 - 00:15:59.466, Speaker B: But that's the predicament all these people find themselves in. And the problem is, once inflation's an issue, it's only going to get worse.
00:15:59.570 - 00:16:00.618, Speaker A: They have to act on it.
00:16:00.666 - 00:16:01.534, Speaker B: They have to.
00:16:02.314 - 00:16:06.682, Speaker A: That's why. So it's higher for longer. It's real. Right. No cuts. No cuts are coming anytime soon.
00:16:06.698 - 00:16:07.522, Speaker C: No cuts.
00:16:07.698 - 00:16:09.482, Speaker B: You know, you got short, short rates.
00:16:09.538 - 00:16:11.250, Speaker A: They're basically off the table. Long dollar.
00:16:11.322 - 00:16:12.242, Speaker C: I mean, we talked about two.
00:16:12.298 - 00:16:13.178, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, we did. Yeah.
00:16:13.226 - 00:16:16.322, Speaker B: Short rates, like short stocks, like long dollar.
00:16:16.458 - 00:16:17.058, Speaker C: Bim.
00:16:17.186 - 00:16:20.418, Speaker A: This is great. It's just getting more interesting.
00:16:20.506 - 00:16:23.706, Speaker B: Yeah. Honestly, I want to dedicate an episode to just.
00:16:23.810 - 00:16:24.426, Speaker A: We got to go.
00:16:24.450 - 00:16:26.898, Speaker B: Domino's. We need to do fiscal central bank bullshit.
00:16:26.986 - 00:16:38.378, Speaker A: Sorry. Bimnet of BB Galaxy trading, my friend. Thank you so much. Let's go now to our guest, Blake king from Galaxy's bitcoin mining team. Blake, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:16:38.466 - 00:16:39.858, Speaker C: Hi, Alex. Happy to be here.
00:16:39.906 - 00:16:53.374, Speaker A: I'm really happy to have Blake here. We've been wanting to get Blake on the pod for a while. Blake is a power engineer by trade and does a lot of work with Galaxy's bitcoin mining operations, which are big electrical operations.
00:16:53.874 - 00:16:54.642, Speaker C: That's right.
00:16:54.738 - 00:17:14.632, Speaker A: So they use a lot of power, but they have a lot of electrical. I mean, if you've ever been to a bitcoin mining site, there's transformers and stuff on site. They are massive electrical infrastructure. How did you get into bitcoin mining specifically because you came. Well, to give us a little bit of your background. Right. Because you come from power.
00:17:14.768 - 00:17:52.706, Speaker C: Yes, that's right. So I'm the result of bitcoin miners, like, moving more and more into the power and utility space. So I originally, like you said, I studied electrical engineering with an emphasis in power, and then I moved into, like, the traditional role as a power engineer working at ERCOT, which is a system operator. For the Texas grid. Worked there for a couple of years, and then I moved on to a national lab doing power system stuff as well. And then all the time being, like, a bitcoin fan, I kind of moved into it, got introduced to it, bought a little bit, kind of slowly rolled into, like, oh, this bitcoin thing is really interesting. And this mining thing is really interesting, too.
00:17:52.706 - 00:18:16.070, Speaker C: And I worked at ERCoT in kind of, like, the system planning role, and I remember talking to other planners and operations folks about the wind curtailment, right. Which is this huge story about how we have to curtail these wind generators and, like, they're not producing what they were. And I was like, what happens when we curtail their operations? Like, do we. Do we pay them for that? They're like, of course we don't pay them for that.
00:18:16.102 - 00:18:19.326, Speaker A: Well, do they turn off the wind turbines so they stop moving?
00:18:19.390 - 00:18:25.134, Speaker C: They stop moving, yeah, kind of funny. We can get into that, but it's like, you know.
00:18:25.294 - 00:18:26.998, Speaker A: And they didn't pay them. Sorry, I didn't want to cut you off.
00:18:27.006 - 00:18:57.654, Speaker C: Yeah, you know, that's right. You don't pay them because ERCoT is a market, and it's an energy only market, which means you get paid for energy, you deliver. So when the grid operator orders the wind turbines to turn down or the solar panels to turn down, there's lost revenue there. And I remember saying, well, why don't we do something with the bitcoin mining? It's a location agnostic. And that's really where I started on the mining part of my career was I started thinking, oh, we should co locate these bitcoin mines with these wind farms. They're losing.
00:18:57.694 - 00:19:02.198, Speaker A: They're out in the middle of nowhere. They can't deliver the power. Right. There was maybe not. They can't deliver transmission.
00:19:02.286 - 00:19:21.838, Speaker C: That's right. You got to go where the wind is, and that's usually where people are not. So there's a lot of transmission that has to take place, those lines get congested, and, you know, it's not all the time that the lines get congested, but it is sometimes, and that's lost revenue. And so I just couldn't believe. I remember I couldn't believe that they didn't get any revenue. It's just lost revenue for them. So that's really where I started.
00:19:21.838 - 00:19:58.592, Speaker C: And then I worked for a solar developer, which is basically a shop that goes out, finds land, builds a solar. I say, build a solar farm, but it's more like bundles up all of the contracts that you would need to start building a solar farm and then sell that to somebody else who then actually builds the facility. So then I got kind of exposure on the business development and technical side of, like, building generation. And then after that, Austin storms and I. After years of communicating via Twitter, he joined Galaxy and was like, hey, we need a power engineer because we're developing sites in ERCOT.
00:19:58.688 - 00:19:59.040, Speaker A: Very cool.
00:19:59.072 - 00:20:00.056, Speaker C: That's how I made it here.
00:20:00.120 - 00:20:09.768, Speaker A: Yeah. So we have sites in the Texas market, and what is it about Texas in general that's very positive for bitcoin miners? There seem to be a lot down there.
00:20:09.816 - 00:20:51.462, Speaker C: Yeah. What was it? The Cambridge Institute, like, 15% of bitcoin mining is going on in ERCOT right now. So the big thing, and they kind of bury the lead, or bury the lead, whatever it's called, in ERCOT, which is the big thing about ERCOT that's good, is the spot market. There is a spot market for electricity where electricity is valued in real time and the price changes basically every five minutes. That is unique to most electricity markets in the world, and it's unique to other vertical markets where there is no spot market for electricity. It's just, you get whatever rate you get in ERCOT. Let's say you were only profitable if the price of power was negative.
00:20:51.462 - 00:21:18.174, Speaker C: There's places in ERCOT where you could run 30% of the time, because the price of power is negative for 30%. It's a really interesting spot market, especially for bitcoin miners, who are looking for that low marginal price of power. There's also a pretty liquid derivatives market in ERCOT as well. It's not as liquid as traditional commodities or equities, but you can basically buy and sell power pretty long term.
00:21:18.754 - 00:21:32.752, Speaker A: So you can hedge. You can find that market, that spot market. Does that result in a lot of competition? I mean, is that what we get now? We get a lot of energy production in Texas now, competing with each other.
00:21:32.808 - 00:21:33.808, Speaker C: You're talking about generation.
00:21:33.896 - 00:21:39.712, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. On the generation side, does it result in a lot of electricity production? I guess, is my question. It seems like it would. And that it would.
00:21:39.728 - 00:21:40.224, Speaker C: Well, that's the goal.
00:21:40.264 - 00:21:56.492, Speaker A: Good for consumers would be the idea. Cause it's so competitive. Whereas, you know, if I'm in. I'm not gonna dox any particular place or grid, but, like, if I'm in some other place where it's like, no, you just buy electricity from Duke energy progress. So I've doxed a region here by saying that, but. Right. Like, I don't have any other choice.
00:21:56.492 - 00:21:57.844, Speaker A: There's nowhere else to buy at all.
00:21:57.924 - 00:22:04.068, Speaker C: That's right. And if your mining revenue goes below whatever tariff that Duke can offer you, you know, you just turn off. You're out of luck.
00:22:04.116 - 00:22:04.276, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:04.300 - 00:22:07.564, Speaker C: You just turn off. And there's no way for you to necessarily hedge.
00:22:07.604 - 00:22:08.668, Speaker A: Hedge it. Right.
00:22:08.796 - 00:22:43.268, Speaker C: That's right. And that's. So that's why people come to ERCOT, is because, you know, as a producer who can turn off and turn on and be exposed to the spot market, it's really interesting for you on, like, a ten year timeline, 15 year timeline, as you're developing assets to see. Okay. And as you said, with the competition on assets, a lot of this is driven. And if people look at ERCOT over the past ten to 15 years, there's been an explosion in wind specifically, and renewables more generally. Like, wind is the massive winner in ERCOT, and that's because of the wind production tax credit that's offered, like, a federal incentive.
00:22:43.268 - 00:22:44.556, Speaker C: Right. So, basically.
00:22:44.700 - 00:22:48.824, Speaker A: And they have a lot of wind, I guess, as well. There's also a ton of wind the plains.
00:22:49.324 - 00:23:25.752, Speaker C: Okay, so, Texas. So, going back a little bit, ERCOT, in, like, the late aughts, instituted something called the competitive renewable energy zone. Project Cres is what it's called. And in Crez, what ERCOT did is they went out and they proactively built a big transmission loop through the windiest area of the state, which is, like, up to the left of the panhandle. And basically because there's always been this chicken and an egg problem with transmission and generation. You know, back in the day, you used to be able to say, oh, they're building a coal plant. It's going to take them eight years, so we have time to build the transmission to them.
00:23:25.752 - 00:23:36.808, Speaker C: Well, you can stand up a wind or a solar farm much quicker than that. And so they were like, okay, well, how do we incent all of these producers to come and take part in all this wind energy out here? Let's proactively build this transmission loop.
00:23:36.856 - 00:23:37.064, Speaker A: Smart.
00:23:37.104 - 00:23:48.272, Speaker C: So, Ercot built it, and they came. They all came. So they all came. They all developed all these sites out in West Texas, and it produced a ton of wind. Like, ercot is. Texas is, like, the leader of wind energy.
00:23:48.328 - 00:23:52.832, Speaker A: Yeah, I heard it's the leader maybe even in the world, if you look at it, a country, it's the biggest in wind.
00:23:52.888 - 00:24:11.640, Speaker C: Yeah, makes sense. But the wind has, like, an interesting, you know, I mean, I would call it a problem. Other people just say it's characteristic of it, which is that, you know, they have pretty, like, parallel profiles, or. I can't remember the specific word, but it's all producing at the same time, and then it's all not producing at the same time.
00:24:11.672 - 00:24:11.792, Speaker A: Right.
00:24:11.808 - 00:24:47.994, Speaker C: Like, there's one wind profile for that area. And so what you get is a bottleneck in transmission, where it's all trying to get out at the same time, and then whenever it's not blowing, the transmission lines aren't being used at all. It's kind of a profile issue. And so this is really where the interesting use case of bitcoin mining has come in, which is like, there's times when there's so much supply that the price is actually extremely low. Right. Like, that's how you get the price of $0 or negative, is that you're actually forcing the wind to turn off, or else you're going to overheat the transmission line. That's what price is, negative.
00:24:47.994 - 00:24:58.098, Speaker C: So then you had this crazy supply that was mainly driven by that production tax credit that I referenced. And now there's a bunch of bitcoin miners coming in to kind of, like, soak that up, if you will, so.
00:24:58.106 - 00:25:05.826, Speaker A: They can sit next to the wind generation, perhaps, and either buy off the grid or take directly from the wind.
00:25:05.890 - 00:25:06.250, Speaker C: That's right.
00:25:06.282 - 00:25:12.522, Speaker A: If needed. Right. Especially in the time when there isn't enough takeaway capacity for the wind, so they just give it right to the miners.
00:25:12.578 - 00:25:13.276, Speaker C: That's the put.
00:25:13.370 - 00:25:13.816, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:13.920 - 00:25:25.096, Speaker C: That's one of the business models that's really out there that I've seen from all of these colocations. And you say you call it a colocation when it's a bitcoin miner and a wind farm, and they share, like, a common meter.
00:25:25.160 - 00:25:25.360, Speaker A: Right.
00:25:25.392 - 00:25:27.304, Speaker C: So the ercot market doesn't see.
00:25:27.424 - 00:25:41.944, Speaker A: They don't really exist as far as ErCot's concerned. They're behind the meter, quote, unquote. Right. So it's like you co locate with the energy generation. So this could be, by the way, I mean, I don't want to. I want to talk about. So we'll talk about now, but let's not forget I've got more ERCOT related to Texas stuff to ask.
00:25:41.944 - 00:26:02.248, Speaker A: But in general, is that a very. Is that how you see a lot of. Maybe not all, but a lot of bitcoin mining going in the future? That electrical electricity producers, either at themselves or in a partnership, will mine right behind the meter like that? There will be a place for them to offload some of their electricity in house, basically.
00:26:02.376 - 00:26:23.678, Speaker C: I think so. I think it really matters on how the deal is structured. Right. So I kind of, you know, I'm working on my analogy here, but the way that I kind of see it is. Is similar to, like, gas wars. If you remember, gas stations used to have these wars where they'd go cheaper and cheaper and cheaper. But as a gas station, you can never really offer gas, like, lower than your cost.
00:26:23.678 - 00:26:51.074, Speaker C: Right. Like, that wouldn't really make sense. Like, maybe to win market share, but not. But if you take a wind or a solar farm, right, they might have a, you know, a cost to get simple payback of, like 30 or $40, which is like three or four cents a kilowatt hour. But because of how they offer into the market, they're willing to take a dollar over zero. So their marginal cost is zero. So they're willing to sell at a dollar.
00:26:51.074 - 00:27:21.448, Speaker C: But a dollar would never really get them simple payback. That'd be a loss for their investors. So what you see whenever a wind or a solar farm wants to enter into some of these deals, well, they're not really going to offer you any power less than their simple payback. Why would they do that? They want. They want simple payback for their investors. So that sticker price is a little higher than, say, if you were just offering what they're offering the grid. Right, because they're bidding into the market at zero because they'd rather take a dollar.
00:27:21.448 - 00:27:48.824, Speaker C: But if you want to sign them up on a long forward contract, now, all of a sudden it's 30 or $40. So I think it really matters. And there are structures out there to kind of solve this, but they're kind of complicated, and no one's really shaken it out to where I've seen there's enough good upside for both partners. I mean, there are some deals that are pretty good. I think the answer is, if it's structured right, you're going to see a lot more models like this. But as it stands, it's kind of complicated to get through, and so is.
00:27:49.244 - 00:27:58.516, Speaker A: Go back to the win for a minute, too, because there's one thing a lot of people have said is that bitcoin mining can help incentivize the build out of renewable energy generation.
00:27:58.580 - 00:27:59.304, Speaker C: Got it.
00:28:00.304 - 00:28:21.136, Speaker A: Clearly, the tax credits and ERCOT building, the loop, the transmission loop that incentivize the build out for sure. Does bitcoin mining also provide some extra incentive? Is there a wind farm that isn't on the loop, that wouldn't otherwise be built but for a takeaway entity like a bitcoin mine?
00:28:21.200 - 00:29:07.302, Speaker C: Yeah, I put that tagline of bitcoin incentivizing. I've got basically a pile of taglines that people that claim that I look at and I'm like, oh, there should be an asterisk that's so much more complicated. And that's going to frustrate a lot of people when they say that. I think the answer is ultimately yes. But it's yes insofar like any demand would incentivize, any extra demand would incentivize a renewable project. Whenever I would do development on the renewable side, you'd find a couple short list places on the grid that you were thinking about developing a site, and you'd run a model to see what the future pricing is. And if we had more than a certain percent of curtailment, we would just kill the project.
00:29:07.302 - 00:29:43.314, Speaker C: Just kill it. Or if pricing was just a little bit lower, we'd kill the project. Of course, if you're going to add demand, it makes sense that that would incentivize generation. The interesting thing about bitcoin mining, and I think is one that as the power system continues to advance, we're going to see the benefits more and more of is the flexibility of their operation. And I think Harry had a good tagline on the episode. The episode that you all had was the last couple months ago, which is that the bitcoin mine doesn't become a burden. It provides the demand, but then it doesn't become a burden.
00:29:43.314 - 00:30:02.160, Speaker C: That's because you're so sensitive to the price. If you're a bitcoin miner that can just soak up all of what renewables consider the low value hours. But then the bitcoin mine also turns off whenever the grid is a scarcity. Eventually, then it starts to become a more interesting conversation of like, oh, it really is a buyer of electricity when.
00:30:02.192 - 00:30:03.880, Speaker A: No one else wants, like a buyer of last resort.
00:30:03.952 - 00:30:31.258, Speaker C: Yeah, that's exactly right. And it's easy to say that, but whenever you're at these workshops and task forces and you actually see how the grid operates, like saying that bitcoin mine is a buyer of last resort and then seeing their operation where it's like sometimes they're on, sometimes they're off, there's delayed operation. It's like it's not a perfect consumer yet. Like, I think we're going to get to a point where it becomes one. But just saying that it does a good job now, I think would be doing it an injustice.
00:30:31.346 - 00:30:41.786, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like if you have part of it is that you can turn on and off, like, immediately. Right. I think with pretty much. With basically minimum. Yeah. Like in a couple of minutes. And with.
00:30:41.786 - 00:30:55.230, Speaker A: I would say. I mean, theoretically, I guess, I don't know, turn my computer on and off over and over again. Probably has some effect over time, but with mostly no technological effect on the. On the mining machines themselves. Probably. Right. To turn on and off, but it consumes so much electricity.
00:30:55.230 - 00:31:06.750, Speaker A: Right. That you're like an aluminum smelting plant and you can't turn that off because then the. The aluminum hardens in the pots and breaks the whole plant. Right. So it's like. Takes weeks to turn that thing off.
00:31:06.822 - 00:31:07.406, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:31:07.550 - 00:31:11.254, Speaker A: So it's that we. Is that. Is that when you say the flexibility, is that. That's what you're talking about?
00:31:11.374 - 00:31:31.536, Speaker C: That's exactly what I'm talking about. And it's the. Yeah, I mean, you said instantly, it is pretty much instant, you know, and there's been. There's an Ercot task force right now. It's called a large, flexible load task force. That is kind of meant to address some of these issues. What we basically saw over the past year and a half is the china ban, whenever that occurred.
00:31:31.536 - 00:31:59.172, Speaker C: And then all of a sudden, there was this influx of miners into ERCOT. They all requested capacity, basically, and certain transmission operators agreed. And then ERCOT took a step back after a year and said, there's 30 gigawatts of bitcoin mining that is supposedly coming online. Ercot has a peak demand of 80 gigawatts. So we're saying, okay, how the grid number one, is that real? Is that real?
00:31:59.228 - 00:31:59.980, Speaker A: Let's investigate.
00:32:00.052 - 00:32:17.914, Speaker C: Let's investigate if it's real. And if it is, let's say even 10% of that comes on. This isn't turning your computer off. This is a third of the power going away all at the same time. We can't do. That's not how grids operate. Grids don't operate with demand that can come off and on so quickly.
00:32:17.914 - 00:32:27.594, Speaker C: We kind of really have to do this. And what you've seen at ERCoT specifically is they've started to impose these ramp rate limitations, or they haven't started to impose them. They've.
00:32:27.714 - 00:32:28.690, Speaker A: They're discussing it.
00:32:28.762 - 00:32:36.402, Speaker C: They're discussing it, right? They're discussing these ramp rate limitations, which is to say, you, as a bitcoin miner, can't turn off your entire load all at once.
00:32:36.458 - 00:32:37.738, Speaker A: You gotta go a little smoother.
00:32:37.826 - 00:32:39.018, Speaker C: Exactly. You gotta go smoother.
00:32:39.066 - 00:32:39.202, Speaker A: Right.
00:32:39.218 - 00:32:57.326, Speaker C: And there's. There's rationale for why they need to do this, right, like, Ercot's been operating the grid a certain way. They have to manage that deviation in frequency a certain way. And some of those costs are borne by the entire grid. Right. You can't exactly impose the cost of a miner dipping off directly on the miner. You have to socialize it.
00:32:57.326 - 00:33:11.788, Speaker C: I think that's the direction we're going, where the miners are getting so big and having such a large impact, they're going to be treated more and more like generation used to be, or is treated more limits, more size limits, more operational limits, things like that.
00:33:11.886 - 00:33:35.624, Speaker A: Interesting. And then maybe some of the mechanics we talk about from the bitcoin mining side, we talk about how we got potentially cheap energy. Lots of wind. There's lots of energy in general in Texas. We're not probably really going to go into it, but there's oil and gas in Texas. Famously, some bitcoin miners do the flare gas mining thing, which is a behind the meter.
00:33:35.704 - 00:33:36.684, Speaker C: Yeah, totally.
00:33:38.264 - 00:34:17.862, Speaker A: How then, are bitcoin miners structuring their operations? You've got a data center, you've got machines in the data center. You're connected to, what, the grid directly? Maybe also an electrical producer, if you're behind the meter, like we talked about. But then what are you actually doing? Are you locking in a long term power rate with your generator or with the grid? And then what are you doing when you then curtail, when you do ramp up or ramp down, what's actually happening? You said the wind producers were not getting paid for that. We read in the news that bitcoin miners are getting paid for this curtailment. What's happening there?
00:34:17.918 - 00:34:46.472, Speaker C: Sure. Well, it really depends on the structure. Let's just take the prototypical ERCOT structure, where you're not co located with any generator, you're just on the grid. You're in one of the deregulated areas, because ERCOT also has vertically integrated areas. So we just got to. Okay, you're in it, you're in a competitive zone, and you want to be a bitcoin miner. Well, the normal structure, like kind of the base, right, is you find what's called a retail electricity provider, a rep.
00:34:46.472 - 00:34:54.120, Speaker C: These are people that are, like, ordained by the utility commission of Texas to sell you power. You know, they're like, hand over hard. I know what I'm doing. I have manage risk.
00:34:54.152 - 00:34:58.048, Speaker A: They have a power generation facility. Whether it's coal, they can.
00:34:58.096 - 00:35:11.326, Speaker C: Well, that's it. So, yeah, we're going to get into it. There's some of those that own both those are called gen tailors. Instead of retailer, they're gen tailor. They have a certain interesting kind of like market power dynamic in Ercot, but it doesn't.
00:35:11.430 - 00:35:12.350, Speaker A: Back to the retailer, though.
00:35:12.382 - 00:35:12.950, Speaker C: You don't have to, necessarily.
00:35:12.982 - 00:35:15.554, Speaker A: So they sell it to you, but they don't produce it necessarily.
00:35:16.894 - 00:35:41.738, Speaker C: Here's how it happens. They can sell you power short, they can sell you fixed power, and they just wear the floating risk. It's a fixed for floating swap. If they sell you fixed power, what they can also do is just pass you through the floating rate. So they wear your risk on a floating rate and then they charge you for it after the fact. Kind of like receivables. Cause ERCot bills them every day.
00:35:41.786 - 00:35:42.122, Speaker A: I see.
00:35:42.178 - 00:36:02.638, Speaker C: Right. So then once you have this kind of floating rate, then you can layer on hedges on top of it. So then it's like, okay, my mining is producing about $100 a megawatt hour the current forwards for power. Where I'm at. Over the next year, I could lock in a rate of like, you know, $70 or $60. Do I want to do that? Do I want to do that?
00:36:02.726 - 00:36:06.830, Speaker A: But purely through derivatives, not through a fixed agreement with the provider.
00:36:07.022 - 00:36:08.974, Speaker C: Yeah, purely, purely, yeah.
00:36:09.014 - 00:36:15.830, Speaker A: So you take the floating exposure to the. Just the. Whatever the spot price of electricity is, but you can obviously lock in a certain price based on how you hedge.
00:36:15.862 - 00:36:48.470, Speaker C: Yeah. The best way to understand is that's the base agreement. The base agreement is you're exposed to the floating exposure, then you can layer on a hedge or a swap. It really depends because the retail electricity provider, they sell you power, but they turn around and they can lock in a swap of the exact same size and shape and price, and then sleeve it to you. That's basically how you do it. Then you take title to the electricity. It's not like a normal utility bill where they just bill you the fixed price as you consume it.
00:36:48.470 - 00:36:53.142, Speaker C: Right. You are now buying title to the electricity at that price.
00:36:53.238 - 00:36:53.734, Speaker A: I see.
00:36:53.814 - 00:37:04.710, Speaker C: So you're either consuming it or you're selling it into the spot market. That's kind of the best way to think about it. So when power is. When the spot price of power is $10, so you have it.
00:37:04.782 - 00:37:07.054, Speaker A: You have it to either use or sell back.
00:37:07.214 - 00:37:08.074, Speaker C: That's right.
00:37:08.534 - 00:37:16.564, Speaker A: So then curtailing, which means not consuming. But we still have these power units, so we can give them back to the grid. That's right. That's the idea.
00:37:16.604 - 00:37:19.444, Speaker C: It's like a firm. Yeah, it's a. It's a firm. Take or pay.
00:37:19.524 - 00:37:23.092, Speaker A: What is the is that what a. What is this term? The fixed PPA?
00:37:23.148 - 00:37:25.964, Speaker C: What is that term? It's a terrible term.
00:37:26.004 - 00:37:26.156, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:26.180 - 00:37:40.628, Speaker C: The fixed. The fixed price. Yeah. There's so many different terms and so much different jargon. You kind of have to code switch wherever you're talking. Like a PPA. So in my world, yeah, a PPA is a long term agreement with a generator directly.
00:37:40.676 - 00:37:41.064, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:41.164 - 00:37:43.232, Speaker C: Like generators sell ppas.
00:37:43.288 - 00:38:04.096, Speaker A: We're a natural gas electricity generator or whatever. We are nuclear, even. We might go out of business. There is not enough people buying our stuff. Oh, great. Someone is going to agree to either build a factory or a car factory, or some manufacturing, or a bitcoin miner or a wholesaler. Right.
00:38:04.096 - 00:38:05.656, Speaker A: Or somebody else has some other use for it.
00:38:05.680 - 00:38:06.072, Speaker C: That's right.
00:38:06.128 - 00:38:18.466, Speaker A: And they'll say, you know what we will buy? We'll guarantee we'll agree to buy this much electricity from you over a period of time. If you lock in a specific rate and then you negotiate that rate. That's the PPA directly with.
00:38:18.650 - 00:38:55.166, Speaker C: Yes. And then those are semi liquid. Those are liquid as well. So it's not necessarily like I'm going to buy power 15 years out. That's the case for renewables, because a lot of time for the renewables to even get developed, they have to sell their power forward first. That's the only way the banks will finance them. But if you're a generator, like, when all this competition came out, basically, power trading shops would kind of take over control of the generating asset, like the natural gas or the coal plant, and they would basically enter into these swaps and do daily balancing of their risk.
00:38:55.166 - 00:39:13.154, Speaker C: How much are we selling forward? How much spot exposure are we taking? Do we take some risk off the table? And again, this is kind of the direction where you're going with the bitcoin miners. Right? How are the forwards trading for off peaks on peak? Like, okay, let's take some risk off here. Let's sell the hedge that we bought for November or December or whatever.
00:39:13.234 - 00:39:19.570, Speaker A: You literally trade them, like, financial contracts, and you also use them to hedge your actual thing. But you could speculate on them.
00:39:19.602 - 00:39:34.598, Speaker C: Well, that's what helps, right? It helps that I've got a mining asset that can cover the cost of my hedge, so it makes longing, the market less risky. You're no longer like a power trader where you're just going long or short, you've actually got an asset that can handle that.
00:39:34.686 - 00:39:55.398, Speaker A: Most of the big mining operations in ERCOT, then they're not. These PPA agreements with producers, they're more like what you're talking about buying from a retailer and then using the financialized, deregulated market, the financial markets to hedge and lock in your prices and trade those.
00:39:55.446 - 00:40:18.398, Speaker C: That's right. Because you're taking the risk, right. If you're a bitcoin miner and you're only making $100 to $150 a megawatt hour, but if you curtail, you can theoretically sell this power for 4000 or 5000. Why would you not do that? Right? Like there's no reason. Like it would take a really strong financial incentive for you. Like maybe your host contract has an uptime SLA or something.
00:40:18.446 - 00:40:19.222, Speaker A: You have to stay on.
00:40:19.278 - 00:40:48.690, Speaker C: You have to stay on. And theoretically this is what the market wants to incentivize, right? Like there's no reason for this bitcoin miner to be online if they don't want to. This is the price signal that you want. And this is where I kind of get frustrated when these people are like, oh, you can make more money not mining bitcoin. And it's like, well, yeah, that's what you want. Like you don't want these miners to stay online during scarcity events. And the miner is also the one taking the risk, right? Like they didn't force someone to sell them power.
00:40:48.690 - 00:40:51.834, Speaker C: Like someone was trying to sell them power and they did it.
00:40:51.874 - 00:41:21.756, Speaker A: And it makes sense too, because it's obviously, I mean, a lot of these miners are publicly traded or even if they're not, they have shareholders. Why would they like, screw shareholders? Yeah. And by mining unprofitably that no business would operate if they were unprofitable. And then also that's the interesting thing about this ERCOT market is that like you said, the market is telling you, it's naturally incentivizing what it wants. And when others need the electricity a lot worse than you, you should shut off.
00:41:21.780 - 00:41:33.428, Speaker C: You should shut off. It's a functioning market. And that's why I think it's like a marketing problem of how people are like, oh, we made this much money curtailing. Matt Levine had a blog, remember a.
00:41:33.436 - 00:41:41.116, Speaker A: Couple weeks ago that was like, they're making more money not mining than mining. Like, ha ha, isn't that stupid? And it's like you're saying that's normal. That's how it should be.
00:41:41.180 - 00:41:42.628, Speaker C: That's how it should be. Yeah.
00:41:42.756 - 00:41:51.524, Speaker A: And that's for any consumer of electricity. Yeah, electricity. But theoretically, even my house, if it gets electricity, gets super expensive. Like what should I do? I should turn off my lights, right?
00:41:52.504 - 00:42:16.008, Speaker C: This is a whole conversation in like really niche power system economics of, like, oh, we should expose more people to the real time price. And they actually had this in Ercot. It was a company called gritty. I don't know if you've ever heard of this, but gritty, back before winter storm, Yuri actually passed, like, retail, residential customers, the spot price of electricity, rather than.
00:42:16.096 - 00:42:16.632, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:42:16.768 - 00:42:20.768, Speaker C: Rather than a fixed rate contract, which is usually what they get sold, because.
00:42:20.936 - 00:42:25.632, Speaker A: Regular people on their face don't want to be like, oh, my God, it's too volatile. My. Can't run.
00:42:25.688 - 00:42:26.024, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:42:26.064 - 00:42:34.640, Speaker A: But is the idea that it would be a more efficient market, it would also make people pay the actual cost of it, and thus, it would incentivize not running 85 lights at night.
00:42:34.672 - 00:42:37.352, Speaker C: It would incentivize not running your dishwasher at 07:00 p.m. At night.
00:42:37.368 - 00:42:48.956, Speaker A: It would be buying. Yeah. Run it overnight instead of during the peak hour, or buy more efficient light bulbs. It could actually help for, you know, the environmental lobby, theoretically, could be for it, because.
00:42:49.020 - 00:43:10.588, Speaker C: Well, here's the tagline. Gritty went bankrupt. Yeah. Gritty went bankrupt in winter storm Yuri because they were unhedged. And in the winter storm, when ERCOT experienced those blackouts, ERCOt actually pegged, and I think it was the PUC, they pegged the price of the market at the cap. So Ercot has an artificial price cap. Just like saying, just can't go over this.
00:43:10.588 - 00:43:11.220, Speaker C: Stop the bleeding.
00:43:11.252 - 00:43:11.372, Speaker A: Right?
00:43:11.388 - 00:43:12.668, Speaker C: Like, stop the bleeding. This is the cap.
00:43:12.716 - 00:43:14.202, Speaker A: It's like a circuit breaker.
00:43:14.268 - 00:43:37.902, Speaker C: They have a way to calculate this, right? It's like the value of lost load multiplied by the probability of losing the load. Anyways. They set it to the cap, and so the price of power was like $9,000 for just days. Incredibly expensive days. Yeah. So, gritty, who has to pay these invoices every day, right? Was like, oh, man, I can't. These receivable risks on my customers at $9,000, they're turning off.
00:43:37.958 - 00:43:39.718, Speaker A: I'm not getting any money from them. Right?
00:43:39.806 - 00:43:46.452, Speaker C: Yeah. Or the customers are turning off, but they still have some. Like, they have something. I mean, it's cold, right? They're running their heaters, so they've got.
00:43:46.468 - 00:43:47.572, Speaker A: To deliver the power.
00:43:47.668 - 00:44:04.144, Speaker C: Yeah. And this is how most retailers, retail. Electricity providers in ERCOT, do go bankrupt, is they're short. Right? They haven't bought enough long for whenever these high price spikes happen, and so they go bankrupt. And that's a tale as old as time.
00:44:05.524 - 00:44:13.140, Speaker A: It's such a fascinating market. It's so different than other markets in the US. Are there any other markets that are like this at all? Where are they?
00:44:13.212 - 00:44:14.924, Speaker C: TJM, New York, ISO.
00:44:15.044 - 00:44:19.076, Speaker A: So this is so the. So the Pacific Northwest, is that PJM?
00:44:19.180 - 00:44:22.884, Speaker C: No, PJM is Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Mass.
00:44:23.004 - 00:44:25.332, Speaker A: But then north. Northern New York. Right? Is that what you're saying?
00:44:25.348 - 00:44:33.148, Speaker C: New York, ISO? Yep. So I don't have the footprints memorized. You'll have to forgive me. And then there's Myso, which is mid interconnect. Like they all kind of markets.
00:44:33.196 - 00:44:35.004, Speaker A: Markets where you can do stuff. It's not all.
00:44:35.084 - 00:44:42.054, Speaker C: They're all extremely different. Like, you know, like, I'm an Ercot guy. You know, like, it's very hard to find someone that's an Ercot guy and a PJM.
00:44:42.124 - 00:44:43.490, Speaker A: Wow. They're that different.
00:44:43.682 - 00:44:50.410, Speaker C: It's incredible. It's so nuanced. And usually people spend their entire careers spanning, like, one or two of these markets.
00:44:50.442 - 00:45:07.794, Speaker A: So, like. Well, every bitcoin miner that's obviously in a place like this, and it's different if you could be anywhere. I was talking about the kingdom of Bhutan, is mining bitcoin. They have a ton of hydro. I think they control the. I don't know if the electricity generation on that hydro is nationalized there or whatever, but, like, they are probably. It's behind the meter there.
00:45:07.794 - 00:45:17.906, Speaker A: Right. It's not this type of mining. But if you're in any one of these markets, what percentage of your staff is straight up, like, energy traders at this point, electric? It can't be much, but everyone's got to have some.
00:45:18.010 - 00:45:45.516, Speaker C: Yeah. Everyone has to have a certain people that know about the power strategy and kind of mesh it with the business model. Right. So you mentioned the Hydro, right? There is an opportunity cost to unused hydro. Like, what is that opportunity cost? Would they want to sign a long term agreement for a dollar? Or is it tied to some sort of simple payback expectation of the hydro? Right. Okay, well, now you have bitcoin price risk. What happens if the bitcoin price tanks.
00:45:45.516 - 00:45:48.468, Speaker C: And now you can no longer afford that contract, the long term contract.
00:45:48.556 - 00:45:48.900, Speaker A: Right.
00:45:48.972 - 00:46:11.856, Speaker C: Yeah. So there's all sorts of business models, and I really don't think this has shaken out. I think we're still at a point where the bitcoin mining revenue can support many different business models. You've got people still mining in vertical utilities with fixed rate tariffs. It's my hypothesis that those are going to be the first to go. There's just not really going to be a vertical utility that can offer you a fixed rate tariff.
00:46:11.920 - 00:46:16.712, Speaker A: They can offer long term, you may not be able to guarantee you can buy long term. There's no good way to hedge.
00:46:16.768 - 00:46:26.704, Speaker C: Yeah. So how long do you build an asset? Do you underwrite a substation for something that you don't know what the whim of the public utility tariff is going to be in three years or five years?
00:46:26.824 - 00:46:31.802, Speaker A: This is why that Texas, with the floating rate that you then hedge, you.
00:46:31.818 - 00:46:37.946, Speaker C: Can always just take spot rate exposure. And then, like I said, there's 30% of the time that west Texas, the power is negative.
00:46:38.010 - 00:46:42.946, Speaker A: Buy it, trade it, speculate on it. Use it. Sell it back. Or use it.
00:46:43.050 - 00:46:43.626, Speaker C: Or use it.
00:46:43.650 - 00:46:44.706, Speaker A: Or mine bitcoin with it. Yeah.
00:46:44.730 - 00:46:45.242, Speaker C: Or use it.
00:46:45.298 - 00:46:47.762, Speaker A: The economics makes sense. Yeah. Much more flexible.
00:46:47.818 - 00:46:48.654, Speaker C: That's exactly.
00:46:49.714 - 00:47:08.982, Speaker A: Do you think, like, what about nuclear? Nuclear is an incredibly dense. So uranium is an incredibly, I forget the exact terminal, incredibly, like dense electrical source. Source of electricity. The tiniest little amount of uranium can produce orders of magnitude more electricity than the same amount of wood, which is an incredibly not dense.
00:47:09.078 - 00:47:19.606, Speaker C: And the waste as well? It's extremely dense. That's always the first thing that people say, oh, the nuclear waste. Then you actually find how much nuclear waste is generated. It's really small. Also.
00:47:19.630 - 00:47:43.254, Speaker A: They figured this out too, where there's a lot of nimbyism about. They wanted to build the nuclear waste facility under the mountain in Utah or whatever, and then people were like, oh, we don't want the nuke waste there. Isn't it radioactive? And it's like, that's actually been solved. To be clear, there's a great uranium influencer. ISO dope. WHOOP, she's gone and hugged them. They're totally not dangerous.
00:47:43.254 - 00:48:00.512, Speaker A: But do you think, doesn't nuclear seem like it's green, its only emission is like water vapor. Right. It produces enormous amounts of electricity. But we have neglected our nuclear regulatory infrastructure and we don't have any new nuclear plants.
00:48:00.648 - 00:48:06.336, Speaker C: Do you think that's the volte plant? I think Volte just came online. That's the only one. Right? There's the only one.
00:48:06.440 - 00:48:12.760, Speaker A: Bitcoin miners. Are they going to mine behind the meter on nuclear? Is that going to incentivize a nuclear energy generation revolution? What do you think?
00:48:12.832 - 00:48:39.594, Speaker C: Oh, goodness. That's a tall order. I will say my stance on nuclear is probably pretty common in the bitcoin industry, which is that nuclear as a base generator makes a lot of sense. It wants high uptime. It can't really ramp up or down that well. So it needs to be on all the time, which is good for the grid, which is great for the grid. So it's got all the normal good attributes of a base generator that I would see.
00:48:39.594 - 00:49:56.824, Speaker C: Now, my issues with it are kind of practical, which I've heard talked about on your podcast, which is that the red tape associated with developing a nuclear plant is crazy. I think it's practically untenable, insanely expensive as well, part of it. So whenever people ask me, is there going to be a revolution? My quick answer is, not in the next. Not with a major regulatory change, not without some sort of huge change, especially with all the solar and wind that's coming online. There's so much solar and wind that's already being incentivized to come online that causes those weird price floor scenarios. So it's going to come to a point where it's like, would you rather do a front of meter on grid site where you're just soaking up that negatively priced energy, or sign a ten year PPA with a nuke facility for 25, $30? It comes down to that scenario, like, what is bitcoin's place? Is it just soaking up all the mispriced energy? Or being this co located buyer of last resort, which the nukes are now also getting production tax credits as well? That was kind of part of the IRA, was nukes are now going to be incentivized as well on the same kind of floor. It's not.
00:49:56.824 - 00:49:59.784, Speaker C: I can't remember the sticker price off the top of my head.
00:49:59.824 - 00:50:00.576, Speaker A: That's positive, though.
00:50:00.640 - 00:50:01.192, Speaker C: They're coming.
00:50:01.288 - 00:50:07.552, Speaker A: Yeah. It just seems to me, like, even with wind and solar, there's significant e waste in particular.
00:50:07.648 - 00:50:08.224, Speaker C: Oh, yeah.
00:50:08.344 - 00:50:37.886, Speaker A: And I've even heard stories, maybe you know about this from your time in solar, too. But there was a. There was a story, like, recently in, like a, like online, like a headline a couple weeks ago or something. They called them streakers or streamers, I can't remember, but it was that birds will fly over the solar farms and just basically vaporize because it's reflecting so much heat. Like, the air above the solar farm gets so hot. But also, it's like, is all the grass under the panels is dead, right, right. And the wind, I don't know if you've seen the piles of the old turbines.
00:50:37.886 - 00:50:48.402, Speaker A: Like, I mean, it's as bad as, like, the piles of old cars and all the other waste that we have, whereas a nuclear plant has none of that. Like, is that. Anyway, it's a little bit of a.
00:50:48.418 - 00:51:17.238, Speaker C: Tangent here, but no, it's certainly an externality and one that gets kind of brushed over whenever people. I think so it is. I agree with you. I don't really have that too strong of a stance on renewables, you know, when it comes to climate change and things like that. I think I hold two things that are seemingly kind of true at the same time. One, I don't see how humanity can not have an impact on the climate, like, with the amount of gas that we're pouring into the atmosphere. It just seems intuitive to me that we would have some impact.
00:51:17.238 - 00:51:35.622, Speaker C: Right. Like, I don't know what that is. Right. But something. And then on the other side, I see these reports of, like, very precise measurements of, like, you know, the globe is like, 0.1 degree hotter. And I just think that, like, there's no way that we can get that accurate of a measurement of such a complex ecosystem.
00:51:35.622 - 00:51:36.622, Speaker C: And I hold those two things.
00:51:36.678 - 00:51:36.918, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:51:36.966 - 00:51:50.450, Speaker C: Those kind of battle in my head. And I've, I've gone back and forth on Twitter with some people about this, where they've tried, they've tried to get me over the edge with, like, precise reports that describe how they did the methodology. And I'm like, I'm sorry, I don't know. I just can't. I just can't get there.
00:51:50.522 - 00:51:56.258, Speaker A: F. Scott Fitzgerald said the test of a true first rate intelligence is the ability to simultaneously hold two contradicting ideas.
00:51:56.306 - 00:51:56.802, Speaker C: Is that right?
00:51:56.858 - 00:52:26.704, Speaker A: So that doesn't surprise me that I think I feel similarly. I mean, I think there's plenty of anecdotal evidence, but anyway. And also, then there's stuff like about, you know, 10,000 year solar cycles and stuff like that that can affect temperature, too. But, yeah, I do think that e waste question is overlooked for renewables and for solar and wind, it can be pretty bad, but they also create energy in a totally renewable way. Right. Which is very positive.
00:52:26.784 - 00:52:56.978, Speaker C: No marginal emissions. Yeah. And the impact on the electricity system is astonishing, too. People don't really understand, but there's a full throttle reworking of how power markets work with all this solar and wind. If you go back even a few years, the riskiest moment on the grid was the time of peak demand, which was 05:00 p.m. There's so much load on the system, there's just not enough generation to meet that. That's the risk.
00:52:56.978 - 00:53:08.206, Speaker C: Whereas now the riskiest interval on the system is really like, when the solar is ramping down and the wind hasn't ramped up yet, or it's all bespoke, though.
00:53:08.230 - 00:53:08.390, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:53:08.422 - 00:53:25.006, Speaker C: It's really based on the forecast of wind and the sun and the load, because now you've got all these forecasts, and it's like, yeah, we can handle the peak of the day no problem, because we got all this solar pumping through, and, you know, this. This has tons of impact on how the operator, like, how the people that operate the grid actually do it, you know?
00:53:25.030 - 00:53:25.254, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:53:25.294 - 00:53:29.134, Speaker C: How much capacity do they need to procure in order to. Right, right.
00:53:30.034 - 00:53:34.554, Speaker A: Yeah. It's wild. Because the grid is alternating current power. It has to stay on all the time. Right.
00:53:34.674 - 00:53:36.234, Speaker C: There's constant matching.
00:53:36.314 - 00:53:41.202, Speaker A: Constant. Right. And whereas wind and solar are intermittent.
00:53:41.378 - 00:54:04.552, Speaker C: That's right. So it's all forecasting. Right. Like, there's a. There's folks, you know, at ERCot or PJM or whomever. Like, there's entire teams of people dedicated to tomorrow's forecast, tomorrow's load forecast, tomorrow's solar forecast, tomorrow's wind forecast, tomorrow's, because you got to imagine there's a thousand different generating units, right? They're each submitting different plans. We're going to be online.
00:54:04.552 - 00:54:13.704, Speaker C: We're going to be offline. We've got maintenance. We've got forced maintenance. We've got an outage. And then there's transmission. And so there's a whole team of people working on tomorrow. There's a whole team of people working on next week.
00:54:13.704 - 00:54:20.568, Speaker C: And then you've got in the control room, there's people working on the next hour, and it's just. It all comes down to managing frequency.
00:54:20.656 - 00:54:21.080, Speaker A: Incredible.
00:54:21.152 - 00:54:28.540, Speaker C: In that moment, we got to keep frequency between 60.0 or whatever and 59. It's amazing. It is an amazing how far bitcoin.
00:54:28.572 - 00:54:36.540, Speaker A: Has come from Satoshi mining on his cpu to really being an integral and major part of the world's biggest electrical grids.
00:54:36.612 - 00:54:54.236, Speaker C: Yeah, it is. It is incredible. My only hope is that the conversation can get a little more nuanced. Like, I know it's tough to just, like, bitcoin fans in general want to say things like, you know, incentivizes renewable energy or it balance the battery or things like this. And it's like, oh, man, that's. You really alienate a lot of people that.
00:54:54.300 - 00:54:55.180, Speaker A: In the power world.
00:54:55.212 - 00:55:05.866, Speaker C: In the power world, exactly. Like, they look at that and they say, balances the grid. You know? Like, what are you. What are you saying? Like, yes, you turn off, but that. That almost causes more issues. You know, like, you're not killing either. Exactly.
00:55:05.866 - 00:55:11.298, Speaker C: And it just feels like the. The conversation is lost. And we kind of alienated a couple people, like, with, look, I mean, you.
00:55:11.306 - 00:55:21.658, Speaker A: Got to communicate big ideas with, you know, digestible and digestible ways. It can be very. And this is, this is complicated to your point, even if you know about it somewhere. Excuse me. You don't know about it there?
00:55:21.786 - 00:55:22.602, Speaker C: Yeah, right.
00:55:22.618 - 00:55:31.914, Speaker A: If I know about it in Texas, I don't know about it in North Carolina. Like, they're very different. So. Or I mentioned one. Bitcoin is a battery. You say this. What do you think about that one?
00:55:31.954 - 00:55:40.826, Speaker C: Oh, and that has got to be. I have done so much work, I can't remember what it's called on the Internet where if you say one wrong thing and it takes, like, yeah, there's.
00:55:40.890 - 00:55:41.794, Speaker A: Somebody'S law or whatever.
00:55:41.834 - 00:55:43.386, Speaker C: Yeah, I can't remember what it is.
00:55:43.450 - 00:55:52.490, Speaker A: You mean when you say something wrong on the Internet and then you get corrected or it's the level. It takes a lot more effort to counter b's than it does to create b's.
00:55:52.602 - 00:56:13.666, Speaker C: But I get it, you know, I mean, even Saylor comes out, says like, it's digital energy, you know, and stuff like that. And it's like, oh, man, it's really not though. Like, bitcoin is more of an industrial. Like, it's better to think about it as just a widget maker. You know, that's it. It can just make widgets so much better than anything else in the past, right? Like, it can make widgets and it doesn't even have to sell them.
00:56:13.690 - 00:56:13.802, Speaker A: Right?
00:56:13.818 - 00:56:24.734, Speaker C: Like, the bitcoin network is. Is the off table bitcoin. Yeah. And that in and of itself is amazing. But the whole, the whole bitcoin is a battery thing. I mean, I don't know.
00:56:24.774 - 00:56:25.918, Speaker A: It's not literally a battery.
00:56:25.966 - 00:56:27.862, Speaker C: It's not literally a battery, by the way.
00:56:27.878 - 00:56:57.218, Speaker A: It is. I was right. It's called Brandolini's law. And yes, it's something. I'm going to say this, the principle of bullshit asymmetry, that it takes a lot more effort to refute B's than it does to create it. I think the battery idea, theoretically, is that because you can use electricity that you have now and that you may not have later or you may not want to use later to create transportable money value. Transportable value.
00:56:57.218 - 00:57:02.210, Speaker A: And so you're storing the electrical spend in the bitcoin.
00:57:02.402 - 00:57:03.218, Speaker C: But that's the same.
00:57:03.266 - 00:57:04.210, Speaker A: But it's very simple.
00:57:04.282 - 00:57:08.154, Speaker C: That's the same as gold, right? Like, it's the same as you're expending to your coal.
00:57:08.194 - 00:57:10.282, Speaker A: Any widget you create that could have value later.
00:57:10.378 - 00:57:20.866, Speaker C: That's exactly right. The thing is that battery has a very specific meaning in the power. The whole thing about batteries is that they can inject right? In like electricity.
00:57:20.890 - 00:57:24.282, Speaker A: Right. You can't take the electricity back out of the bitcoin and put it back into the grid.
00:57:24.338 - 00:57:25.298, Speaker C: That's always the first.
00:57:25.346 - 00:57:27.094, Speaker A: That's literally what a battery does.
00:57:27.674 - 00:58:24.938, Speaker C: But I, but I get it. Like, there's something tangible in what bitcoin can do for the grid. And just saying that bitcoin allows people to long power is just not as fancy as it's a battery or things like that, you know, I mean, there's, the great way to understand is that bitcoin is just buying electricity. And as soon as that electricity becomes more useful for someone else, bitcoin can just relinquish that capacity. A generator that could have been curtailed or could have not chosen to be online was online because they had a customer in the bitcoin miner. And that miner can then relinquish that capacity if it wants to. My thesis, and a lot of people's thesis is that hash price is going to continue to trend down because you've got tons of miners that are now set up to where the spot price or they're hooked up to curtailing generators, that hash price is just going to continue to get pushed down and down.
00:58:24.938 - 00:59:00.990, Speaker C: And what you're going to see is the bitcoin mining revenue dollar is going to continue to get lower and lower until the point where the area under the curve where miners are consuming is cheaper and cheaper. So you're no longer going to see bitcoin mining as a competitor to residential customers. It's just going to seem absurd on its face. It's like this. Bitcoin miners curtailing at $40. They're not really a competitor. And that's going to make the conversation a little bit easier that we're having with these traditional grid people because we tried these arguments on them like, oh, bitcoin miner, it's a consumer of first resort or last resort.
00:59:00.990 - 00:59:18.896, Speaker C: And they say, well, not really. If you're consuming at dollar 150, you're actually competing and you're driving the price of everyone up because it's a marginal market. So any consumption raises the price. But if you're curtailing earlier, I think that's where we're trending, and that's going to be a much easier conversation.
00:59:19.000 - 00:59:24.736, Speaker A: So some of the things that we've said as bitcoin advocates are becoming more true over time.
00:59:24.800 - 00:59:26.496, Speaker C: Yes, that's right.
00:59:26.680 - 00:59:27.560, Speaker A: Is that the positive?
00:59:27.632 - 00:59:31.440, Speaker C: That's the positive. That's the positive spend. Yeah, I agree.
00:59:31.512 - 00:59:49.052, Speaker A: Yeah. It's just such a complicated story. It really is. Would you say that bitcoin is bitcoin electricity coin? You know, wasn't, like, there's that Henry Ford headline from an idea from the 1920s or something, that money should be based on energy, because universal value.
00:59:49.148 - 01:00:11.410, Speaker C: No. And it's the mining side and also the transmission side. I mean, to transmit it for anywhere in the world within one block, if you want. I mean, that's incredible. It's incredible. And to be able to mine it and not need an off taker. When I was working at the solar company, I would model the bitcoin mining side by side with hydrogen or concrete or something like this.
01:00:11.410 - 01:00:32.024, Speaker C: And it's just like, oh, the story is so much more simple. I'm literally feeding the machines with electricity, and bitcoin is effectively coming out of them. I don't have to store the hydrogen. I don't have to transport the hydrogen. It's amazing. Amazing thing to be a part of and experience and build.
01:00:32.884 - 01:00:41.292, Speaker A: So you mentioned earlier, Blake, about the winter storm, Yuri. Right. What was that, like, December 2021, maybe? Is it 2020?
01:00:41.308 - 01:00:41.764, Speaker C: I think it's right.
01:00:41.804 - 01:00:42.524, Speaker A: 22, actually.
01:00:42.604 - 01:00:43.012, Speaker C: February.
01:00:43.108 - 01:00:44.844, Speaker A: Was it last year? I can't remember two years ago either.
01:00:44.884 - 01:00:45.780, Speaker C: February of 21.
01:00:45.812 - 01:01:09.932, Speaker A: Time is a flat circle and an illusion. But we've talked a lot about the Texas grid. It's very interesting and unique. It's at the forefront of this deregulated way of running a grid. But it gets a lot of hate in the national media for, like, the blackouts during Hurricane Yuri or people saying it's fragile. Is that true? Is it fragile? Cause to me, it seems very competitive and therefore dynamic.
01:01:10.068 - 01:01:27.172, Speaker C: Yeah, I would agree with you that it's not as fragile as it seems. I think it's a victim of the transparency in kind of a weird way. Like, the prices are so transparent and it gets so much press that whenever these things happen, it becomes a bigger story than it otherwise would with data.
01:01:27.228 - 01:01:29.060, Speaker A: And all this reporting.
01:01:29.132 - 01:01:43.852, Speaker C: Yeah, that's right. And it's also, like we said, the whole wind revolution. Right? So it's kind of like the poster child for whenever people want to say over investment in renewables, lack of investment. ErCOT is kind of like the perfect poster child to put that up as a bad thing.
01:01:43.908 - 01:02:11.372, Speaker A: But, like. So in other energy market, electricity grid again. I grew up in New England. It's actually getting. Finally getting to be well known that the grid is in deep trouble in New England. They're literally shipping, buying giant tankers of natural gas from abroad because of the Logan act and weird regulatory reasons why they. And then people have blocked a lot of pipelines in the area for environmental concerns, but that's not stopping us from consuming up there.
01:02:11.372 - 01:02:41.014, Speaker A: And there have been fears in many. Cause New England can have really bad winters that there could be devastating blackout. A lot of that region also uses heating oil for heating, which can be very expensive. And of course, they don't produce up there anyway. It's very opaque and people didn't really realize this. Or if we talk about, in general, a more opaque, totally regulated, monopolistic grid where there's one producer and you don't really know what's going on, those could be fragile, and we just don't even know. Right.
01:02:41.014 - 01:02:43.222, Speaker A: I mean, there's no transparency at all.
01:02:43.278 - 01:03:22.024, Speaker C: Yeah. It's basically, how does the risk present? The risk presents as low. And then all at once with ERCoT in winter storm Uri, people always cite the renewables. But what really tipped the scales, and you can go back and you can look at the reports here. It was correlated natural gas, correlated natural gas outages where pipes froze. And because there's so much just in time natural gas fed generation, that that was really a huge problem that wasn't addressed in the planning. There had been some four gigawatts of coal retirements in 2018.
01:03:22.024 - 01:03:54.618, Speaker C: So when everything is good and there's no winter storm, people look at the coal plants and say, well, this is an expensive, dirty, 50 year old coal plant. Let's just retire this. And they run the study and it looks good and they retire it. But then there's some correlated natural gas outage. And then ERCOT also had a nuclear unit trip, which is just to say, like, you know, any thermal plant can trip for a myriad of reasons. It's not like, just because you're a thermal generator that you're going to be up 100% of the time. There's forced outages, there's maintenance, there's all sorts of things that happen.
01:03:54.618 - 01:04:23.356, Speaker C: And it was really this convolution of, like, all of these different things happened that caused winter storm Yuri. There was wind de rates, of course, there was the nuclear unit tripping, which you never want to happen during, like, the peak winter storm, eventually. And then there was all these natural gas outages. And then, you know, because of this, ERCoT has, you know, publicly addressed, you know, we're doing weatherization, we're creating a new product for firm fuel, right? So now there's a new product where you have fuel on site?
01:04:23.420 - 01:04:23.708, Speaker A: Yep.
01:04:23.756 - 01:04:46.500, Speaker C: Not just in time natural gas pipelines, you know, because coal is really easy. You got pyramids of coal on site. You don't have to worry about just in time pipelines. And that's the same for New England and things like this. This is really what this. This incentive to get off of fossil fuel is kind of doing is when times are good. And it's easy to study the retirement of these different thermal assets that have been online for decades.
01:04:46.500 - 01:05:14.322, Speaker C: You go ahead and retire them, and then all of a sudden, you get left with this Rube Goldberg machine, where it's like, yes, we don't have that much fossil, but we're also importing a lot of fuel from our neighbor or a lot of power from our neighbor. And what does their fuel mix look like? Oh, all of a sudden, you've just kind of shifted. Shifted your liability onto someone else and reduced your own independence. And so it's kind of an interesting thing that we're going into now, where everyone's just kind of changing the shape of the problem of.
01:05:14.418 - 01:05:31.138, Speaker A: It's really interesting the amount of different strategies that grid operators are doing. And I was asking you before, like, worldwide, like, is Texas an anomaly? Is it out on the fringe of the deregulated idea? Like, where does it stand and what do other people do? Yeah, just in general, in the world.
01:05:31.186 - 01:05:45.226, Speaker C: Like, this is a really deep topic. You are just scratching the surface of power market structures. People spend their whole careers thinking about this. Texas is on the forefront of deregulated electricity market design.
01:05:45.290 - 01:05:46.054, Speaker A: Granular.
01:05:47.074 - 01:06:13.556, Speaker C: Yeah. So Texas has a nodal market. So, basically, every substation in ERCOT gets its own price in intervals where there's no congestion. Like 15 minutes intervals where there's no congestion. Each one of those prices on each substation is the same. But then, like we were talking about earlier, if you have a transmission constraint, then maybe those specific substations over there have lower pricing. Right.
01:06:13.556 - 01:07:18.042, Speaker C: And so there's this very kind of granular market that you can get extremely efficient. And the whole purpose here is there was people like me on the solar development or wind developer natural gas development side, that have all these different substations to pick, and they can pick that one substation, and they can run a model and say, okay, what does the pricing look like? How often does this substation congest? You can get really into the nitty gritty efficiencies of the market. And there's other markets, like you mentioned. There's Duke and other vertical integrated utilities where there isn't an army of different people trying different strategies. There's the planning department at Duke, and they're trying to optimize for how can I best, most efficiently run this market? And it is an ongoing debate on what the best outcome is going to be. Does this market produce the reliability that we want? And in ERCOD and other free markets like this, it's a constant stakeholder, informed debate. ERCOD has meetings monthly, weekly of, well, we need the reserve margin to be higher.
01:07:18.042 - 01:07:22.704, Speaker C: How do we incentivize that? How do we change the pricing structure? But it's really interesting.
01:07:23.084 - 01:07:29.036, Speaker A: This is great, Blake. Thanks so much for coming on. Galaxy brains Blake King from Galaxy's bitcoin mining team.
01:07:29.100 - 01:07:30.224, Speaker C: Thanks for having me, Alex.
01:07:31.124 - 01:07:51.978, Speaker A: That's it for this week's episode of Galaxy Brains. Thank you to our guest, Blake King from Galaxy's bitcoin mining team. What an interesting conversation. So much going on there in Texas and power markets and bitcoin. I can't believe how different all of the electrical grids are too. That's just a giant patch of wires and energy generators feeding this world with electricity. That is just different everywhere.
01:07:51.978 - 01:08:23.358, Speaker A: So interesting the role bitcoin mining plays in that. And of course, friend. Thank you to a friend, Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading.
