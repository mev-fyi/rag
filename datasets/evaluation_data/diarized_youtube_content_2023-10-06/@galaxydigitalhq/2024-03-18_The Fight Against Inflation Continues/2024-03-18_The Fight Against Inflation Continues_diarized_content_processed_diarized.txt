00:00:07.600 - 00:00:12.598, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, BiMnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:12.686 - 00:00:13.750, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:13.902 - 00:00:31.438, Speaker A: What a time. It continues to be in markets, but let's jump past the bitcoin, new bitcoin all time high today, blah, blah, blah. Assuming we're in a longer bitcoin bull market, that will happen a lot. So we're not going to, we're doing well. Things are going up. It's an exciting time. But let's talk about the data this week because the big data topic was CPI.
00:00:31.438 - 00:00:33.914, Speaker A: I guess it came in slightly hot. What happened?
00:00:34.294 - 00:01:04.272, Speaker B: It was reasonably hot. Core CPI came in at 0.4 month on month. I believe it was 36 unrounded. So just got the nudge higher. Key areas where we wanted to see some slowdown in the rate of inflation, like measures like super core inflation were still high on four two handles. We didn't see goods deflation that we wanted to see.
00:01:04.272 - 00:01:55.804, Speaker B: Things like car prices were a little bit more elevated. And overall, it just shows you an economy that hasn't fully tackled inflation and that the Fed really, given the risk of reinflation, can't be too aggressive with rate cutting. But again, it's one of those data series. You can slice and dice and find bits and pieces that look good. For example, owner's equivalent rent, which had shown a surprising pop in January due to seasonal stuff, did come off a bit as most market participants had expected. And then if you look at the reaction in fixed income and bond markets, you've repriced higher by, let's say seven basis points at this .8 basis points.
00:01:55.804 - 00:02:28.416, Speaker B: And so it was an important reading. And it's going to color March FOMC, and that's going to really be kind of setting the tone for markets on a go forward basis. And so it was an important data series. It showed that the economy still is dealing with high inflation and the market is digesting it in a way that is saying that the data is meaningful, but it's not earth shatteringly high number.
00:02:28.480 - 00:02:34.204, Speaker A: Right. So it felt like a slight creep higher, but not a jump. Correct.
00:02:34.624 - 00:03:27.132, Speaker B: But at the same time, it really depends because you have to contextualize it with so many different things. Like right now I'm looking at crude oil that's moving up through $80 a barrel, like West Texas intermediate. We're looking at, if you just look at the charts of month over month inflation, it looks like it bottomed, not like it's going lower. It looks like you've had a lot of the disinflation you're going to have, it becomes that much easier to surprise higher. Once you get all these high numbers roll off and you just have low numbers. And so, and then you have to contextualize it with the response function of the Fed. The Fed said they wanted to see further evidence of inflation decline, to start engaging in rate cuts.
00:03:27.188 - 00:03:27.980, Speaker A: And this isn't that.
00:03:28.052 - 00:03:30.516, Speaker B: This is not that, exactly.
00:03:30.540 - 00:03:33.064, Speaker A: It's not that. It's not further evidence of decline.
00:03:34.284 - 00:03:47.330, Speaker B: It's well off of the seven 8% prints that we were getting, you know, a year ago. Yeah, but at the same time, like, if you're telling me your, you know, core PCE target's 2%, you're still a ways off.
00:03:47.402 - 00:03:48.954, Speaker A: Where do we at 3.6, as he said?
00:03:49.034 - 00:04:45.932, Speaker B: Well, that's the core CPI. We'll see where PCE comes in. But you're still, like, on a three handle on core pc. And so it's like, do you want to, you know, start cutting ahead of your goal? And then the question is, should you even be targeting 2%? Are you comfortable with a higher than 2% neutral rate? And so it's getting very tricky. And then the most important dynamic, which is tough for the fed to even acknowledge properly, is this idea of a fiscal constraint that's put on them because the treasury is issuing tons and tons of debt, and they've got to finance their entire book of debt that's rolling off every year. And so as you have treasuries maturing, you've got to. They have to be refinanced at front end interest rates that are around like 5%.
00:04:45.932 - 00:04:52.980, Speaker B: Right, right. So imagine like a 2.7 average duration or something like that, you know, rolling off, and it's got to go to five.
00:04:53.052 - 00:04:54.540, Speaker A: It gets a lot more expensive, gets.
00:04:54.572 - 00:04:57.948, Speaker B: A lot more expensive. And the government is just printing so.
00:04:57.996 - 00:05:18.366, Speaker A: Much, I forget there's a variety of ways to cut it, but if you. It's a trillion dollars to the national debt every hundred days at this point or something, which is just insane. I saw Balaji Srinivasan had posted a linear and exponential regression, and it's like, dude, we're at 100 trillion in, like, 20 years less.
00:05:18.470 - 00:05:18.958, Speaker B: It's insane.
00:05:19.006 - 00:05:20.158, Speaker A: It's getting very scary.
00:05:20.206 - 00:05:33.590, Speaker B: Well, you know, my favorite thing that I saw yesterday was Elon Musk, and I think it was an Elon Musk tweet, and I think it was totally under appreciated by the market. Basically, he retweeted a guy that said, oh, I've been getting shield, this awful.
00:05:33.702 - 00:05:34.638, Speaker A: This new scam coin.
00:05:34.686 - 00:05:42.910, Speaker B: This new scam coin. And he's like, there's 27 million outstanding. There's one node operator, pretty centralized, infinite supply.
00:05:43.022 - 00:05:43.390, Speaker A: Right.
00:05:43.462 - 00:05:47.870, Speaker B: And the supply is increasing at this rate, at this absurd rate.
00:05:47.942 - 00:05:48.318, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:48.406 - 00:06:16.392, Speaker B: And then the butt of the joke is that that's actually the US dollar. And by all intents and purposes, I mean, that's exactly what's happening. And the symptomatic of all the things we've seen in emerging market economies. When you go into crazy periods of inflation and people, this is what happens. And the math, you can't argue with the math. Tell me the government's going to cut deficits, balance the budget, especially now we're.
00:06:16.408 - 00:06:17.384, Speaker A: In an election year.
00:06:17.464 - 00:06:18.176, Speaker B: Election year.
00:06:18.280 - 00:06:45.536, Speaker A: We saw the proposed budget from the White House, although I should say, by the way, there was something just for the news, for the audience. Yes, they have a 30% proposed excise tax on bitcoin miners on the electricity cost, not on their revenues, by the way, regardless of which it was, that would be prohibitive. But fear not on this or the Biden, the top line number. You know, the congress hasn't passed a budget in time since 1996. Did you know that?
00:06:45.680 - 00:06:49.844, Speaker B: Well, makes sense. That's almost 30 years ago getting downgraded, right?
00:06:49.924 - 00:06:52.036, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, but it really is scary.
00:06:52.180 - 00:06:52.780, Speaker B: It's so scary.
00:06:52.812 - 00:06:54.484, Speaker A: The idea that like we just print.
00:06:54.524 - 00:07:29.004, Speaker B: Forever and people take comfort in the idea of MMT basically at this point. They're like, well, the fed balance sheet will just absorb it. But there are so many moral hazards to that people don't understand. The treasury releases a report every year that present value calculates all future liabilities of the government. That includes Medicaid, Social Security, all of the social safety nets, defense budget stuff, et cetera. That figure is north of $100 trillion. $100 trillion in today's dollars.
00:07:29.004 - 00:07:32.764, Speaker B: It's like north of 120, but there's no way to pay for it.
00:07:32.844 - 00:07:33.380, Speaker A: None.
00:07:33.492 - 00:08:02.094, Speaker B: And you're telling me the central bank is just going to print trillions and trillions more dollars to absorb all this stuff and it's not going to have any real world consequences? It's absurd. And the average person that is sophisticated in markets that sees this issue and thinks you can get through it, they're just like, well, we'll become Japan. We'll just absorb that. But we've never seen this happen.
00:08:03.754 - 00:08:10.760, Speaker A: And by the way, I like your point about the average smart investor who thinks it can be absorbed. There is.
00:08:10.872 - 00:08:12.208, Speaker B: There are people, tons of people like that.
00:08:12.256 - 00:08:24.832, Speaker A: There are also a lot of very smart people who are very, very worried. Very worried. I mean, even people we don't let Larry Fink, Jamie Dimon. Right. Like Stan Druckenmiller, Paul Tudor Jones, they talk. These are among the best investors in american history.
00:08:24.968 - 00:08:28.136, Speaker B: Absolutely. Everybody's looking for a way to hedge that risk.
00:08:28.200 - 00:08:28.536, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:28.600 - 00:08:34.248, Speaker B: And bitcoin is absolutely part of that narrative now. And you can't ignore it. And that's why it's going higher.
00:08:34.336 - 00:08:38.454, Speaker A: Yep. Bibnetta BB, my friend from Galaxy trading. As always, thank you for coming on. Galaxy brains.
