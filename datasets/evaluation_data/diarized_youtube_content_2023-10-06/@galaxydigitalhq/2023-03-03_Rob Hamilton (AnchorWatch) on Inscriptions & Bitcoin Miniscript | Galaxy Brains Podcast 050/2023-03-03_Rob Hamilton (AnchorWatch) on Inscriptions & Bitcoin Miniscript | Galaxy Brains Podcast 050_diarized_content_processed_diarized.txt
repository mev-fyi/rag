00:01:03.572 - 00:01:35.010, Speaker A: Rob Hamilton, CEO and founder of Anchor Watch, a bitcoin insurance company. He's our guest, and he's going to talk a lot about inscriptions and ordinals. He's an expert and also miniscript, a fascinating new development on bitcoin, a new programming language that enables a lot of new features that he's one of the only people on earth building on. He'll teach us about that. We're also going to check in with our good friend, of course, Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, we have a great, slightly longer than usual conversation with Bimnet about markets and the economy that I think you'll find really interesting. So look forward to that.

00:01:58.522 - 00:01:58.754, Speaker B: Good.
00:01:58.794 - 00:02:00.442, Speaker C: Thanks for having me on, as always.
00:02:00.538 - 00:02:16.970, Speaker A: And I'm excited to talk because it's been a pretty exciting week. I remember last week we talked about higher for longer, a little bit of a repricing of the interest rate curve, but then there was some data that came out last week too that really caused equities to not do great. What happened?
00:02:17.162 - 00:02:20.214, Speaker C: So you had a pretty strong PCE print.
00:02:20.954 - 00:02:22.402, Speaker A: That's not CPI. What is that?
00:02:22.458 - 00:02:32.896, Speaker C: Personal consumption expenditure is the Fed's preferred inflation measure and a printed 0.5 month on month, which is a really strong.
00:02:32.960 - 00:02:35.816, Speaker A: Reading .5 month over month inflation.
00:02:35.920 - 00:02:36.224, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:02:36.264 - 00:02:36.632, Speaker A: Wow.
00:02:36.728 - 00:02:37.592, Speaker C: 0.5%.
00:02:37.688 - 00:02:40.376, Speaker A: That's what I mean. Yeah. Wow, though. That's notable.
00:02:40.520 - 00:02:43.064, Speaker C: Oh, no, that's definitely annualized.
00:02:43.104 - 00:02:45.376, Speaker A: That to get to like the annualized. Yes. Yeah.
00:02:45.480 - 00:02:52.768, Speaker C: But you don't annualize. It's the past eleven months of data combined with the current data to get your annualized.
00:02:52.856 - 00:02:54.224, Speaker A: But that was a bad reading.
00:02:54.304 - 00:03:12.816, Speaker C: Yeah, it basically confirmed what you had in the CPI reading, which is also 0.5 month on month. And so generally speaking, prices are rising at 0.5% month a month, around 6% a year, which is not good, especially given that you've had somewhat tight monetary policy for the past nine months.
00:03:12.880 - 00:03:14.684, Speaker A: You'd think it would be having more of an effect.
00:03:15.184 - 00:03:52.508, Speaker C: You would hope it would be right now, today you got ism prices paid. That came in a lot stronger than expected. You had a 51 handle print when I think expectations were for 47. That's showing resilience and prices again. And what you've had is a further repricing of rates. And so now you're looking at terminal rates that are around 547, 550 area, which is higher than what any Fed person has really been talking about. So this is really one of the first few times where the market's like aggressively getting ahead of the Fed.
00:03:52.508 - 00:04:14.744, Speaker C: And that's kind of what's caused equities to come off a bit. And I'd also reiterate that cash is again a formidable alternative to owning any risk asset right now. When you can earn four, five, 6% on low duration stuff at no risk, why take the risk of going into a risk asset?
00:04:15.844 - 00:04:24.516, Speaker A: The risk is, just to be clear with, you're talking about a Treasury government defaults. The risk is that the US government defaults. That's the risk that exists, right? Unlikely.
00:04:24.620 - 00:04:36.624, Speaker C: If you talk to an economist, they tell you that's the risk free rate, right? So, yeah, honestly, if the government, us government defaulted, it'd be probably the best thing to happen to bitcoin in a really long time.
00:04:37.764 - 00:04:39.092, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it's one of these things.
00:04:39.148 - 00:05:10.614, Speaker C: I'm dead ass. I'm lifting bitcoin hand over fist. If the US government is defaulting, there are some scenarios where it's causing a big risk asset sell off. But I think if people are going to start doubting money and the viability of money, bitcoin seems like a pretty natural. Gold is probably the better, I mean, probably the better risk adjusted trade in that instance. But bitcoin has a role there, I think, with respect to the US government defaulting. We don't have to spend that much time.
00:05:10.654 - 00:05:12.598, Speaker A: Right, right. Yeah, just throw that out there as the.
00:05:12.726 - 00:05:20.518, Speaker C: But yeah, it's really an event that is going to start impacting the market. Now what will lead to is this thing called extraordinary measures that the treasury.
00:05:20.566 - 00:05:25.438, Speaker A: Adopts where they already been adopting. Right. We're already at the debt ceiling.
00:05:25.526 - 00:05:26.154, Speaker C: Correct.
00:05:26.654 - 00:05:32.750, Speaker A: I think Secretary Yellen had said they can do those through like July or something. Yeah. So technically the politicians can.
00:05:32.862 - 00:05:37.958, Speaker C: Yeah, you can get through July, probably like September, et cetera.
00:05:38.006 - 00:05:41.118, Speaker A: But at some point, obviously, the Congress has to figure this thing out.
00:05:41.166 - 00:05:41.374, Speaker B: Correct.
00:05:41.414 - 00:05:42.982, Speaker A: Talking about the debt, they have to raise the debt.
00:05:43.038 - 00:06:21.092, Speaker C: But what happens is normally, like, the treasury likes to keep money on the chance that they have outflows. I think the minimum they keep, or it fluctuates, but it's like they need to keep like five days worth of outflows, potentially, like in their account. Right. And then a buffer, et cetera. And it moved around with COVID and stuff because the government had more things they could possibly spend money on. So what happens is the treasury is like, we don't have a huge debt limit, so we're gonna keep a minimum cash amount on hand. And what that does is that takes treasury supply out of the market.
00:06:21.092 - 00:06:42.534, Speaker C: And it's. Anyway, it's a weird technical thing, but long story short, it shouldn't really impact the market that much. It's well telegraphed every year that I've had, I've been in markets, it's like, oh, shit, the debt cell. Oh shit, the debt ceiling. Notice that one t bill just spiked in yield by a couple of basis points.
00:06:43.234 - 00:06:44.618, Speaker A: But they figure it out.
00:06:44.706 - 00:06:47.066, Speaker C: Yeah, they figure it out. Let's get back to.
00:06:47.130 - 00:06:51.414, Speaker A: You're talking about risk assets owning them over high level.
00:06:51.454 - 00:07:12.526, Speaker C: We have data that's really strong, prices that are still continuing to rise. But the prices that we're most concerned about are like the service sector related stuff, not the goods and the service things are still going to be tied pretty closely to employment. And employment's still at record lows. So people feel inflation's sticky.
00:07:12.590 - 00:07:30.198, Speaker A: Yeah, because people are willing to pay higher prices still. Right. And that's because people feel they don't feel poor, they don't no, no. And that's because they have, what? Good jobs and credit cards and their mortgages. If you have a lot, you're locked in at a low rate and home prices have been appreciating in a lot.
00:07:30.206 - 00:07:31.974, Speaker C: Of places or not depreciating that much.
00:07:32.014 - 00:07:40.694, Speaker A: Or holding pretty good. Yeah, we were just talking before we started recording about this data that people are looking at, which is the new mortgage applications.
00:07:40.774 - 00:07:43.734, Speaker C: Yeah, I think they're down about like 40% year on year.
00:07:43.774 - 00:07:45.614, Speaker A: And it's at their lowest for decades.
00:07:45.694 - 00:07:46.454, Speaker C: Yes, correct.
00:07:46.534 - 00:07:52.390, Speaker A: So no one's buying a new, taking out a new mortgage. Not no one, but very few people are taking out a new mortgage because the rates are so high.
00:07:52.542 - 00:07:58.166, Speaker C: Well, correct. But it's also, there's just. Yeah, but the wealth effect.
00:07:58.230 - 00:08:08.398, Speaker A: Right. Because if you have a home already and you can afford the mortgage. Cause it's locked in at a lower rate and the home is appreciating or holding its value and you have a good job. Right.
00:08:08.446 - 00:08:09.014, Speaker C: You're fine.
00:08:09.094 - 00:08:20.274, Speaker A: Like you feel like you can spend money and so you do because you're disposable income now, even if you're losing money in real terms because of inflation, which many people are. Right. Cause real wages aren't actually keeping up with inflation.
00:08:21.254 - 00:08:22.814, Speaker C: They are not. But the other thing.
00:08:22.854 - 00:08:28.774, Speaker A: But like still though, it's the. You feel like you're doing well. Right. And that's so much of this is like, do you feel like you can spend money?
00:08:28.814 - 00:08:39.774, Speaker C: Here's the other big problem that, you know, I don't think the average american or the average person has really kind of gotten their heads. But like all the money people keep in their checking accounts and savings is earning nothing.
00:08:39.854 - 00:08:40.254, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:40.334 - 00:08:40.550, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:40.582 - 00:08:45.918, Speaker C: So you're getting, you're getting depreciated on your fiat if you're not in these bills that.
00:08:45.966 - 00:08:53.458, Speaker A: So you either spend it now or invest in instruments. Right? Like in treasuries or. Theoretically.
00:08:53.506 - 00:08:56.802, Speaker C: But keeping it in a bank account is probably the worst thing you can do right now.
00:08:56.858 - 00:09:10.730, Speaker A: I will say I saw there are some of the brokerage firms, obviously. Cause they run like money market funds. There are sort of cash like instruments like that that feel a little bit like a savings account. But again, you're actually investing in like an institutional money market fund or.
00:09:10.762 - 00:09:12.394, Speaker C: Yeah, like markets offers bond fund.
00:09:12.474 - 00:09:31.370, Speaker A: Yeah. So like. But yeah, the banks weren't they asked, they were when they had the bank CEO's. Like when was it? Maybe in December or something before Congress. They asked, some congressman or senator asked them like, why are, why is my bank account paying 0.1% interest? And they're just like, oh, yeah, you know, like we're competitive. Yeah, like blah, blah, blah.
00:09:31.370 - 00:09:32.882, Speaker A: And then it's like we're taking all that money.
00:09:32.978 - 00:09:35.002, Speaker C: Yeah, the bank is what it is.
00:09:35.058 - 00:09:35.654, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:36.314 - 00:10:19.042, Speaker C: But anyway, so services inflation's hot, home prices, they haven't, and like rents, they haven't been coming off aggressively. And in fact, like the last CPI print, we had a 0.8 print month on month on the ownership equivalent rent. And we know that's backward looking. And Nick Timorous, who's like the Fed reporter at the journal, like all the Fed people, like, he recently published a piece earlier this week about apartments. And generally speaking, apartment rents have been coming down and you should start to see that in the data a little bit. And then the other thing to keep in mind is, well, today commodities are a lot higher, but commodities have been getting hosed for the past couple of months.
00:10:19.098 - 00:10:21.178, Speaker A: Energy in particular, that gas.
00:10:21.266 - 00:10:26.554, Speaker C: Oh my gosh, thank God for the warm weather. Feels like spring in February.
00:10:26.634 - 00:10:32.426, Speaker A: It literally does. Even today in New York where it's like a little chilly, it's still like 40. Yeah, it's not like 20, but yeah.
00:10:32.450 - 00:10:37.578, Speaker C: I mean, the whole commodity complex has come up. So the good side of things has really.
00:10:37.746 - 00:10:41.730, Speaker A: Lumber was like, oh yeah, FTX launched lumber futures.
00:10:41.802 - 00:10:46.562, Speaker C: Oh, that's awesome. Back then when that was, what didn't they launch? It's crazy.
00:10:46.658 - 00:10:48.974, Speaker A: We should have known how degenerate they were separately.
00:10:49.414 - 00:10:50.902, Speaker C: But let's go hindsight.
00:10:50.998 - 00:10:56.342, Speaker A: Yeah. But yes, the commodities are off and the mortgages are sticky.
00:10:56.478 - 00:11:11.622, Speaker C: People are mortgages, but apartment rents are going to come down. The services stuff might stay sticky. I mean, I personally, I think that the US inflation stuff is just a little overblown right now. Like prices will come down. Like having interest rates this high.
00:11:11.758 - 00:11:13.214, Speaker A: Like it has to have an effect.
00:11:13.294 - 00:11:42.904, Speaker C: It has to have an effect. And it's also ongoing quantitative tightening, which is draining 95 billion of liquidity every month. It's also, it's not just the US doing it, it's like globally, everyone's trying to slow shit down. What throws wrinkles into all of this is the chinese reopening. And so basically today it was pretty big news. You had chinese data that was really robust. So expansionary pmis was the headlines overnight.
00:11:42.904 - 00:12:00.934, Speaker C: And long story short, you've got a nation of 1.3 billion people that's been saving money for three years, and now they can go out and do stuff and spend money and not wear masks, et cetera. There's some interesting terms that people like revenge spending.
00:12:02.074 - 00:12:17.658, Speaker A: Actually, I like that one. Cause I feel like I did that when our lockdowns really lifted here. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Okay, so just. And then I'm looking at the block clock over my shoulder. We're at 23, seven here today on Wednesday. You know, bitcoin and crypto has been pretty resilient.
00:12:17.658 - 00:12:26.890, Speaker A: And actually, bitcoin's still been leading the way. I think we just updated our year to date numbers. Year to date bitcoin, on a risk adjusted basis. Still the best performer, I would guess.
00:12:27.002 - 00:12:29.170, Speaker C: And better than 40% on the year.
00:12:29.282 - 00:12:32.250, Speaker A: And still better than ethereum, which has also been performing well, risk adjusted.
00:12:32.282 - 00:12:37.130, Speaker C: That sharpe is probably like, what? Something stupid. Yeah.
00:12:37.282 - 00:12:52.326, Speaker A: Like so, so. But like, even last week. Right. You know, I think it was the worst week in equities of this short year so far. But yet bitcoin, what came down from 24 eight. Pretty resilient here.
00:12:52.510 - 00:13:22.072, Speaker C: One. I think folks in the US tend to get very us centric about how they think about markets and forget that bitcoin is a global asset. I think part of the resilience in crypto has been related to the influence in Asia or the crypto scene in Asia. With Hong Kong officially allowing Hong Kong unrestricted trading.
00:13:22.168 - 00:13:52.364, Speaker A: Yeah. They put out a big regulatory framework that lays the groundwork for how companies can operate. And very granularly, this is the thing we've talked about, is what the US has neglected to do. UK has now done, Europe has now done. Now Hong Kong has done, again, comprehensive framework that makes it possible, and I dare say even easy for crypto firms to comply and offer services. Right. Rather than a bunch of gray area stuff or, God forbid, prohibition, outright bullish.
00:13:52.524 - 00:14:13.434, Speaker C: I think that's been super constructive, whether it's in Asia or UK, as you mentioned. Also, you've had a bunch of asian tokens that have done really well, the asian polygon and the AI stuff. And so. And, you know, Korea also has a pretty active, you know, crypto community. I mean, they're the people that pumped aptos.
00:14:13.854 - 00:14:19.566, Speaker A: Yeah, aptos was. That's where they did their big conference. Yeah, they had their conference there in Seoul.
00:14:19.750 - 00:14:20.438, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:14:20.486 - 00:14:24.354, Speaker A: So a range of global factors also being global factors.
00:14:24.654 - 00:14:34.158, Speaker C: That's. And then I also just think you kind of just have to see who's left. Right. It's an industry that came apart in last year.
00:14:34.206 - 00:14:34.834, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:35.374 - 00:14:41.822, Speaker C: And so I think you're left with a bunch of strong hands. Right, right. Like all the people that, to be.
00:14:41.838 - 00:14:51.630, Speaker A: Clear, like the coins didn't get destroyed. They got moved from like forced sellers into buyers. And who's buying at those low levels? Well, strong people, long term convicted.
00:14:51.742 - 00:14:57.918, Speaker C: Absolutely right. Like, if you're scooping up bitcoin at like 16, 17,000, you're not spooked by like 24.
00:14:57.966 - 00:15:00.254, Speaker A: Five. Going down to 23. Hate at all.
00:15:00.334 - 00:15:18.846, Speaker C: Oh, no. Like you're thinking like 510 years down the line. And I mean, I love looking at the weekly and the monthly bitcoin charts. Like, if you're taking a step back and taking a real big picture of you, like the chart says higher, not lower.
00:15:18.910 - 00:15:19.554, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:19.854 - 00:15:25.246, Speaker C: And, you know, 18. What was the bitcoin low?
00:15:25.350 - 00:15:25.686, Speaker B: 16.
00:15:25.750 - 00:15:26.534, Speaker C: Five, even lower.
00:15:26.574 - 00:15:29.022, Speaker A: 15. Eight maybe. It printed at 1.15. Five.
00:15:29.118 - 00:15:29.654, Speaker C: Flash.
00:15:29.774 - 00:15:36.518, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, like during that, but, yeah, called 16. Yeah, we were at 16, six for like weeks. It felt like at one point, but.
00:15:36.526 - 00:15:37.074, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:38.774 - 00:15:41.958, Speaker C: But it feels like a bottom now.
00:15:42.006 - 00:15:42.646, Speaker A: Yeah, it does.
00:15:42.670 - 00:15:56.222, Speaker C: A structural bottom in bitcoin. And I think there's a lot of investors that did not pay attention when it was at the bottom. And now you have a product that trades like, there's a ton of dip buyers in it.
00:15:56.278 - 00:15:56.914, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:57.424 - 00:16:28.674, Speaker C: To give you an idea, there's been 110 percent dip this year in bitcoin. It was very brief and then you've had a couple of like 5% dips. But this thing for being a 60, 70 volume asset class has given people very little amount of time to actually load up on good levels. If it's an asset that, I mean, 20k has got to be huge support. Huge support at this point.
00:16:28.714 - 00:16:41.734, Speaker A: I mean, right now we're ranging between like twenty k and the two hundred week moving average, which has historically been huge support, which we're below, which is in like 25 range slowly coming down over time. So like that, that feels to me like the range at the moment.
00:16:42.194 - 00:16:43.738, Speaker C: Yeah, 25k is just a 25.
00:16:43.786 - 00:16:45.066, Speaker A: Just also as a mental.
00:16:45.170 - 00:17:17.218, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I mean, I think conceptual number, I think if you take out 25, you're going to 28, but seems like there's some strong resistance at 25. I just think that it's one of those things that you need to own right tails in, you know, necessarily have to own bitcoin. But, like, I think you're supposed to own the right tail of bitcoin, which is winging options, stuff like that. Because I do think that the fomo is gonna be pretty real when this thing moves.
00:17:17.346 - 00:17:18.674, Speaker A: Yeah, it's gonna move.
00:17:18.754 - 00:17:19.514, Speaker C: It's gonna gap.
00:17:19.594 - 00:17:23.778, Speaker A: Yeah, that's how it always has been. To be clear, bitcoin historically in trading.
00:17:23.826 - 00:17:55.450, Speaker C: Terms the way you're supposed to think about it, it's always been spot up volume. When spot goes up, normally volatility goes up with it because you get these really gappy illiquid moves and fomo, and people are short gamma and they got to cover. I definitely think that there's room for that kind of move to happen, but it's going to be really tough for that to happen absent risk assets doing well, which is going to be, again.
00:17:55.522 - 00:17:57.626, Speaker A: Really tough, because a big long story on that.
00:17:57.730 - 00:18:13.690, Speaker C: You're in a 5.5% interest rate environment now. It's tricky. Bitcoin, I think if we were in a two and a half percent environment would be easier. It would be a lot higher. But you can say that with anything.
00:18:13.762 - 00:18:16.538, Speaker A: We got the macro thing to worry about. That's all we can do.
00:18:16.586 - 00:18:17.350, Speaker C: Macro is a big.
00:18:17.442 - 00:18:32.774, Speaker A: Oh, it is for sure. This is a great conversation, bim, as always, great to have you, and we'll catch you next week, my friend. Thank you. Welcome Rob Hamilton, CEO and co founder of Anchor Watch Bitcoiner and developer. Welcome to the show. Welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:18:32.854 - 00:18:35.110, Speaker B: Longtime fan, happy to be on the show.
00:18:35.222 - 00:18:43.406, Speaker A: I think fans of the show will be excited to know that. I think at the end of this interview, Rob's going to try his hand at the lyrical profession. He's got a rapid.
00:18:43.406 - 00:18:53.238, Speaker B: Yeah. I encourage you all to not rush to the end. You should savor the journey that will be this podcast, and then you can clip that and listen to it on a loop as you make it your ringtone.
00:18:53.366 - 00:19:23.160, Speaker A: So we're going to talk about a couple interesting things. One of the. I think it's so interesting. One of the first things I wanted to talk to you about was miniscript, which is a new bitcoin programming language that can compile down into bitcoin script, which is what bitcoin uses. You're one of the few people on earth that's actually building something with it. So we're gonna talk about that in a second, and then we're also gonna talk about one of the hot topics in bitcoin, which is inscriptions and ordinals. These, you know, for lack of a better shorthand, bitcoin, nfts, digital artifacts.
00:19:23.160 - 00:19:23.432, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:19:23.448 - 00:19:24.976, Speaker B: Digital artifact, in case you would correct you on that.
00:19:25.040 - 00:19:34.464, Speaker A: I appreciate that. You know, just like NFT is also such a terrible term, by the way, like the fact that this is what the Ethereum community, it's a technical term for the type of token it is.
00:19:34.504 - 00:19:42.580, Speaker B: Yeah, it speaks to, just in general, developers are not good at marketing. Yeah. They kind of catch fire with their own terms, and then everyone kind of gets dragged along for the ride.
00:19:42.652 - 00:19:53.228, Speaker A: Yeah. And so. And then we're going to talk about anchor watch, your venture that you guys are building an insurance company for crypto. Crypto people for bitcoin and ETH specifically. Right?
00:19:53.276 - 00:19:58.412, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So there's. Yeah, those are. We have a full agenda. That's the agenda. We have a lot to dive into. So let's get into that.
00:19:58.412 - 00:19:58.556, Speaker B: Let's.
00:19:58.580 - 00:20:12.388, Speaker A: Let's talk about miniscript. So, first of all, you know, I remember Andrew Polstra actually had come to Boston. Bit devs. I know. Hey, I think he was doing the rounds because you sent me the one of him in London. This was now maybe like three years ago. And so we were hosting.
00:20:12.388 - 00:20:39.460, Speaker A: We used to give up at Fidelity, one of our big auditoriums all the time for Bitdevs, like many good companies do. I know in New York, I won't name the companies for privacy reasons, but nice big companies often give space. And I went to this one, and I remember being like, what the hell is this? And it seems super interesting, but then that's the last I heard of it. But it's in bitcoin core some. It's actually available for use.
00:20:39.572 - 00:20:40.004, Speaker B: Yes.
00:20:40.084 - 00:20:42.244, Speaker A: You're using it. Tell us what it is.
00:20:42.364 - 00:21:30.912, Speaker B: Yeah. So when Satoshi Nakamoto invented bitcoin, he not only wrote the whole protocol on those different pieces, he also invented his own programming language. That programming language is called bitcoin script. And think of this as the instructions that you use to prove that you own a given unspent transaction output, Utxo, as we call it, and you reveal the information associated with that script and allows you to spend. And when you broadcast a transaction to the network, all of the nodes in the network run the bitcoin script to validate. Is this a good transaction or not? So, bitcoin script is a reverse forth, like, reverse stack, fourth like language. I would put it in the category of a series of instructions.
00:21:30.912 - 00:21:45.504, Speaker B: Very simple. And a lot of the use cases that we use bitcoin for today use these instructions are called op codes. Operational codes. And these opcodes are very basic in what we use today. Mostly op checksig.
00:21:45.664 - 00:21:45.976, Speaker A: True.
00:21:46.000 - 00:21:55.520, Speaker B: False. Is this a valid signature or not? Op check. Multisig. Is this multisignature valid or not? In truth, there's 256 opcodes in bitcoin. They already exist in.
00:21:55.552 - 00:21:55.696, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:21:55.720 - 00:21:56.920, Speaker B: So a base two number.
00:21:56.992 - 00:21:58.056, Speaker A: Yeah. What a great number, too.
00:21:58.120 - 00:21:58.440, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:21:58.472 - 00:21:59.512, Speaker A: I love 256. Yeah.
00:21:59.528 - 00:22:25.376, Speaker B: So there's 256 opcodes, if you look at them, about 150 of them are not usable because bitcoin, in its consensus, you can't change the rules once they're in motion. So there's a bunch of opcodes which are just total graveyards. If you execute them in a script, the script will fail. If they are even present in a script, they sometimes will fail depending on out of these 256, they all have different kind of condition, which one it is.
00:22:25.400 - 00:22:26.282, Speaker A: Some of them will, though.
00:22:26.408 - 00:23:15.356, Speaker B: There's 55 00:50 of them, which could have utility on a day to day basis. And what Andrew Polstra, director of research at Blockstream, and Peter will, one of the prolific lead maintainers of bitcoin core, came together and understanding, saying, if we could take a subset of these opcodes, can we make them interoperable in a way that we can unlock more complex bitcoin. Smart contract language, truly on bitcoin, became the project mini script. It started in 2018. I think there was live code for people to mess around with in 2020 when Andrew Polster was making the rounds. And the biggest things I would want to call out is this enables things like in a legacy multisig today, a two of three. Let's say you have one key, you leave one key with your lawyer, you leave one key with a custodian.
00:23:15.356 - 00:23:39.628, Speaker B: Your biggest concern is, well, wait a second, what if the custodian and the lawyer run off with my money? All keys are equal. There is a flat, there is no hierarchy. With mini script, you actually could add governance layers using and and or statements. So. And is really critical for you could say my key signs and one of these other two. Right. Another example would be an or statement which allows you to have kind of hierarchies of different security outcomes.
00:23:39.628 - 00:24:25.732, Speaker B: The most straightforward one people think of as what's called a degrading multisig. Degrading Multisig saying, let's say I have a five of five, but maybe after six months I haven't signed, it becomes a four or five and then a three, a five and a two five and so on. And this leverages something which in bitcoin is already natively supported today called a time lock. A time lock being you're going to have a certain constraint based on time passing on when you can actually unlock a certain spend condition. And when you take all of these Lego bricks, it actually uses 20 op codes. You get really advanced nuance smart contracts on bitcoin that allow you to have much more power in being able to program your money and how you're custodying it. And I think this is going to be a major step function going from single Sig to Multisig, which happened around 2017.
00:24:25.732 - 00:24:35.704, Speaker B: We're now entering this era now where the development tools are there and live, where you can go from Legacy multisig to miniscript. And this is how large institutional sums of money are going to be governed going forward.
00:24:36.484 - 00:25:10.132, Speaker A: I love to hear that Multisig was a step change, and that's basically how all bitcoin custodians do custody. Some are probably using some kind of multi party computation tricks as well. But this, I mean, yeah, I mean, you take a large custodian, at its core, they have a multisig set up for the assets, but then they're applying those governance features in their process. Right. They're saying, well, the chief of compliance has to sign. Right. One of them has to be him or her, and then two of the others have to be from the bunkers we have out in the world.
00:25:10.132 - 00:25:10.860, Speaker A: Right, or whatever.
00:25:10.932 - 00:25:11.268, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:25:11.316 - 00:25:18.324, Speaker A: But they can't actually program that logic directly into the. The actual multisig. They have to apply it as a layer on top as part of their process.
00:25:18.944 - 00:25:58.358, Speaker B: 1000% true. And as a quick nod to Anchorwatch, the insurance company that I am building, we are building our own wallet, called Trident Wallet, which is going to be powered and enabled by miniscript. And our core thesis here is that we can actually take the smart contracting on chain governance and have a hybrid approach of off chain compliance and monitoring to make sure that they're synergistically working together. So you don't have to. You can actually have, like, this is the chief compliance officer's key, and they can sit in the hierarchy, and as opposed to being something that operates in meat space, it could operate in code, and it allows us to further de risk things and have really powerful use cases.
00:25:58.486 - 00:26:11.720, Speaker A: Let's talk a little bit about that de risking. I guess technically the agenda we laid out. I'm skipping ahead a little bit, but from an insurance standpoint, if you can de risk custody further and provably, so what's the benefit there?
00:26:11.832 - 00:26:53.444, Speaker B: Yeah, so the insurance infrastructure as it exists today in the larger cryptocurrency industry is very under capitalized, and I would call a bit legacy modeling of insurance. You leave all of your keys at a single custodian, and because of that, it doesn't matter how fancy your cryptography is, you have a centralizing risk of all of the eggs being in one place. Right. And that centralizing of risk is toxic to insurance and people that are paying for risk. So our thesis and our model is a multi institutional custody model where you can have a distribution of keys. We have digital programmable money. With bitcoin, we should be treating this like the unique asset it is, instead of something like gold bars and a safe, which is really how it's being applied to right now.
00:26:53.444 - 00:27:32.164, Speaker B: And that's why there's very limited insurance solutions that are out there. And we believe that this is part of core bitcoin financial infrastructure to be able to increase institutional adoption and have additional comfort as well. If you have a small percent allocation for alternative assets as a portfolio manager or running a family office, you're already taking the risk of the price volatility and the fact that you could get hacked and stolen and lose your money. We believe insurance is part of that risk. Financing is a very critical part of just ecosystem infrastructure that needs to happen. And if you look over the past six months, you can just tell that this is the equivalent of. No underwriter ever would have touched these kind of risks.
00:27:32.164 - 00:27:49.814, Speaker B: If you looked at FTX, they didn't have a cold wallet. Right. You're paying for the risk even if you're not paying an insurance premium, you're just paying it as a hidden cost. And we believe that making those costs transparent and putting out there on the table is the way to really move this industry to the next steps of being able to be integrated into the larger financial system.
00:27:49.894 - 00:28:13.014, Speaker A: That's great. I think when I haven't looked at crypto custody insurance in a little while, but when I did a couple of years ago, really, all that was there, and you hear this, there's insurance, and they got insurance on their hot wallet. Some exchange may or may not. Typically, it's really cyber insurance that they're buying. Right. Because that's how the insurance companies are thinking about it. And they're not very big policies.
00:28:13.014 - 00:28:23.070, Speaker A: They certainly do not cover today, all of the assets that are held at these custodians. That's why it's usually like our hot wallet, is because they're only able to get like 50 or $100 million of coverage at most.
00:28:23.262 - 00:28:37.408, Speaker B: Yeah. And they're managing billions, if not 10 billion plus in assets. I call it fractional insurance. So if you have a mass total loss event, you're getting paid one to two pennies on the dollar. It's not really insurance. And it's just really. It's really unfortunate.
00:28:37.408 - 00:28:59.440, Speaker B: I think that our approach as well, is thinking about wrapping this more and more of a traditional property and casualty wrapper. As opposed to insurance. Cyber insurance is a very new and developing industry and it has very hard to price that risk. Whereas with our leverage and ability of using hardware wallets, geographic distribution, air gaps, this is something that's a physical problem.
00:28:59.512 - 00:29:05.504, Speaker A: And you think you can quantify that and underwrite that risk, especially if they use some of the schema that you're developing.
00:29:05.584 - 00:29:06.320, Speaker B: That's exactly right.
00:29:06.352 - 00:29:06.584, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:06.624 - 00:29:57.392, Speaker B: So further distribution of just not. This is our security setup, but if you start introducing questions of, you need to not only compromise one institution, you need to compromise many. Additionally, us at anchor watch, being a signer, we are extremely economically motivated to make sure your keys are safe. Right. So you're also able to, in that distribution of risk, work with us and other institutions to spread this risk out to where it's not just can I get social engineered and lose all the money at the company like we've had with very many historic hacks in the past. Or maybe you have an exploit in a hot wallet, like if you remember back with the Bitfinex hacks and with bitcoin you have someone that is able to kind of like through the back door pull out a bunch of money where you have keys that were able to manage policy permission, API keys that could manage policy permissions and withdrawals. And all of a sudden your safe wallet has a massive Barnyard that's going to run through.
00:29:57.448 - 00:30:07.914, Speaker A: Yeah, that's always been one of the interesting questions I've had for custodians, the NPC folks as well. Right? It's like, okay, I get that the thing is very secure, but what about the mechanism that directs the thing to act?
00:30:08.034 - 00:30:08.586, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:30:08.650 - 00:30:40.064, Speaker A: And that's when you have those API breaches that like, you know, so I think it's very interesting. I'm also interested, I mean, just on miniscript specifically. Like, are there any other types of like wacky things that this actually enables? Like for example, we talk about covenants as something that, you know, you got 119, you got op vault, you can get some with any prev out some other proposals that get us towards a vaulted custody model or other covenants uses recursive covenants. Do you get any progress just through mini script on any of those ideas?
00:30:40.144 - 00:30:51.416, Speaker B: I would say what's interesting about miniscript is no fork is required today. So we get to really fully explore what's possible now without a fork. Right. So very simple things. A relative time lock, which we mentioned earlier. So that very quickly.
00:30:51.480 - 00:30:53.696, Speaker A: I love that degrading custody idea, degrading custody.
00:30:53.800 - 00:30:55.776, Speaker B: But it also acts as like a dead man switch.
00:30:55.880 - 00:30:56.512, Speaker A: That's what I mean.
00:30:56.608 - 00:31:27.240, Speaker B: So very specifically, you have two kinds of time locks in bitcoin. You have op check lock, time verify, which is an absolute time locks, meaning at block height 1 million, you can use this spend path or op check sequence verify, which is a relative time lock. And very specifically, when you're thinking about the object sequence verify, a relative time lock. You could start having your degrading custody. It's based on when the funds entered the UtxO. And then you can start doing very interesting features of doing self sends and kind of like doing proof of life checks.
00:31:27.312 - 00:31:41.976, Speaker A: Yes, I like that a lot. And I like if I have, you know, a multi sig set up for my personal bitcoin. Right. Teach my loved one or loved ones to be able to access it in the event that I die, it'd be nice that it's like, well, let's say they screw it up or lose the key.
00:31:42.040 - 00:31:42.352, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:42.408 - 00:31:52.250, Speaker A: When. Well, and look at you might be out now, but in ten years it'll degrade and you'll be able to get it just by going to the. The collaborative custody provider or someone like that.
00:31:52.282 - 00:32:24.466, Speaker B: That's exactly right. And I think one of the other interesting pieces that's very under explored, but it is in the tooling of mini script or hash locks. And this is where you can get really interesting ideas of. It does not solve the oracle problem, but if you want to be able to have some sort of interaction with the outside world, a hashlock, it's used in the lightning network today for your justice transactions. But just to take a step back, I could have a message and I hash it and I push that hash into the bitcoin script, meaning if I ever reveal the pre image that what created that hash, you can maybe unlock additional spend conditions.
00:32:24.530 - 00:32:25.186, Speaker A: It's interesting.
00:32:25.250 - 00:32:26.098, Speaker B: It's really interesting.
00:32:26.186 - 00:32:28.962, Speaker A: Secret spend conditions. Yeah, you can at a later time.
00:32:29.058 - 00:32:33.890, Speaker B: Yeah. So you can have a secret password where if that gets revealed, you now can unlock a certain branch.
00:32:33.962 - 00:32:34.330, Speaker A: That's cool.
00:32:34.362 - 00:33:14.162, Speaker B: Right. So this is incredibly underdeveloped space that I believe is going to be a bit of a renaissance when it comes to what does it mean to build products and services in bitcoin, whether they are decentralized ones, whether they're formal companies like us. This is really allowing it so that you don't have to be Andrew Polster, Peter will wizard. You can actually have the accessibility of this dev tools very quickly. Miniscript also compiles and optimizes for script size, so it will go through your entire script spending paths will allow you to make sure that you're using the smallest possible script. And additionally the visualization of the mini script policies. You're able to look at a quick visual glance and verify your participation in a quorum.
00:33:14.162 - 00:33:41.668, Speaker B: And one last thing is that mini script policies are composable. So you could have your own internal company's crazy schedule of like, how does the money get spent? And you can plug that in as a single node into a larger manuscript policy so you can have it be. This one condition is met at this one company with its own crazy elaborate policy as a two of three. And what I love is just very simple things like, I could have a two of three, me as the user, a two of three at the custodian, and a two of three of other parties as well.
00:33:41.866 - 00:33:44.032, Speaker A: You can stack them on top of each other and stuff.
00:33:44.128 - 00:33:47.764, Speaker B: Yeah, this really just changes the entire model, what it means to have custody of everything.
00:33:49.304 - 00:33:53.440, Speaker A: I love it. Let's talk about inscriptions a little bit.
00:33:53.472 - 00:33:54.048, Speaker B: Would love to.
00:33:54.136 - 00:34:24.440, Speaker A: We had Casey Rodemore, creator of inscriptions, or the concept of doing it, the ord father, the ord father, on our podcast a few weeks ago to talk about it. It's a great podcast. You should check that one out. It's been a few weeks since then, though, and I think we here at galaxy, me, myself, but also on our research team, and the market has learned a lot about it since then and really come to some conclusion. So I want to talk about that. And I know you've been very involved and certainly very interested.
00:34:24.512 - 00:34:24.768, Speaker B: Yes.
00:34:24.816 - 00:34:36.190, Speaker A: First of all, what has been your involvement here? Because I think you hear Rob talking about miniscript. And in general, if you don't know him, our audience, he's a talented bitcoin coder. So this is interesting. What has been your involvement?
00:34:36.262 - 00:35:13.954, Speaker B: I find it fascinating from a design space of changing what it is to use bitcoin and interact with it from there. My interests actually started really taking off when I went to Bitcoin park last Wednesday. There was an open house night when Bitcoin park has a very quick shout out. It's based out of Nashville. You and I were there in January for the mining summit. Every month they do an open house event, and this month was open source software and using open source software. And I was on a panel specifically talking about building businesses that use open source software, because miniscript is not my invention, it is open source software.
00:35:13.954 - 00:35:50.906, Speaker B: And how do you build on that? So I was in town for that. And also the bitcoin development kit team the BDK team was also in town, and it was an amazing opportunity to work closely with them because a lot of our back end infrastructure is built using that. And having more time to directly talk to the engineers who are using that gives us a lot of great insight and kind of exchanging of product roadmaps and different pieces like that. So that's my original intention of why I was in town. It just so happened that Casey was in town as well, doing an inscriptions workshop. Now, I was trapped. This is the week of February 7, end of January, was actually syncing up my ordinal node wallet to start playing around with it, and it was fully live and ready to go.
00:35:50.906 - 00:36:08.108, Speaker B: So I had a main net node ready to go and start doing the actual live inscriptions. And because of that, I showed up to Bitcoin park as the one person who was able to do inscriptions live on site. And then I started becoming a dj with taking. Instead of taking song requests, taking inscription requests, and people were giving me sats.
00:36:08.156 - 00:36:10.716, Speaker A: Cards, and I was like, OTC inscribing.
00:36:10.780 - 00:36:19.436, Speaker B: You know, I'm a horrible business person, I guess, because I was just doing it for friends and doing it at cost. I wasn't trying to do anything. I actually haven't mentioned an inscription for myself yet. Funny enough, I got my.
00:36:19.500 - 00:36:23.340, Speaker A: My avatars on there. 10,888.
00:36:23.412 - 00:36:24.220, Speaker B: Well, there you go.
00:36:24.292 - 00:36:25.564, Speaker A: Pretty low number, guys.
00:36:25.684 - 00:36:27.756, Speaker B: Ten, eight. Eight. No, it's a great number of.
00:36:27.780 - 00:36:29.472, Speaker A: Alex Thorne is worth any money, I.
00:36:29.488 - 00:36:37.320, Speaker B: Think you could talk to your wife and maybe she'll buy. Exactly. Very fascinating. And playing around with all of it.
00:36:37.432 - 00:36:42.040, Speaker A: And then it's a new design space, if nothing else. That's interesting, and that's what I find really interesting.
00:36:42.072 - 00:37:01.992, Speaker B: It also, from a narrative perspective, changes what it is to use bitcoin, because Casey did it the bitcoin way he did it, within the rules of bitcoin. He didn't ask for a fork, he didn't ask for any new changes. He looked at it and he ran with it. And at a very quick technical level, the big unlock here was for the taproot upgrade. BiP 342 removed the script size limit to be able to do more advanced taproot transactions.
00:37:02.008 - 00:37:16.408, Speaker A: The idea behind this at the time, I guess, and educate me here is Taproot unlocks a lot of more advanced scripting, and we didn't want to. The bitcoin developers didn't want to limit that they want. And that could be like, I don't. Making this up. Huge multisigs or other weird stuff.
00:37:16.496 - 00:37:16.720, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:16.752 - 00:37:45.906, Speaker A: Someone this was not raised. I think this was one of the weird things about inscriptions. The idea that that would also allow arbitrary data, a larger amount of arbitrary data to be posted, that was not raised during the discussions about, in the online debates about Taproot. And to me, that was. That's actually pretty troubling that it wasn't raised and wasn't flagged, because I think the bitcoin, even I put myself in this camp. I think if you told me that taproot would allow arbitrary data storage on bitcoin, I think most of us would have opposed it.
00:37:46.090 - 00:37:46.674, Speaker B: Yeah, it's.
00:37:46.714 - 00:37:50.858, Speaker A: Now that it's here, to be clear, I think it's very cool, and I certainly don't want to unwind Taproot.
00:37:50.946 - 00:38:31.838, Speaker B: Right. It is a really interesting point because this is one of the cultural hot touch points of bitcoin throughout time. Originally, like the opera term was a lot larger. People started using bear Multisig to be able to just push arbitrary data on chain. This is something that's been around for near the length of bitcoin's existence. And it's really interesting that people forgot our history and culture a little bit to realize that once we opened up the floodgates, so to speak, people were going to use it for their own means and ends up the opportunity. I think just now, looking at how everyone's playing around with this is, I think the NFT phase is kind of like the first, just like very obvious synergistic use case.
00:38:31.838 - 00:38:58.778, Speaker B: But there's a lot of interesting use cases, I think permanently. It changes the security threat, modeling and structure of what it is to run bitcoin. And I think that's something that we haven't fully integrated with an understanding. The mempool may never clear again because at once, after Vbyte, it's too cheap to push permanent data as a decentralized hard drive. Decentralized hard drives, incredibly valuable. So I think it's going to take years for us to fully wrap our hand around what it means to have this now as part of the protocol.
00:38:58.826 - 00:39:07.890, Speaker A: Right. It's normal that silly jpegs are the first that get put there, especially given the broader crypto market.
00:39:07.962 - 00:39:08.626, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:39:08.770 - 00:39:43.726, Speaker A: But I agree. I'm hunting for and thinking about what the other real use cases can be. And I personally am pretty bullish on bitcoin jpegs. I am bullish on that. I mean, look, nfts are a large market in crypto, but I'm interested what else can be done? I know Casey has talked about, for example, you can put a JavaScript library in there and then you can have another inscription refer to that library. I don't know what that means exactly, but it seems like you can start building software that connects to the chain and other interesting stuff.
00:39:43.790 - 00:39:44.166, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:39:44.190 - 00:39:44.366, Speaker A: Yes.
00:39:44.390 - 00:40:17.482, Speaker B: Someone already made an inscription parser in Python as an inscription. Actually can invoke an inscription to look at other inscriptions. And I think as a very quick call and touch point, the ideological perspective of what it is to be an inscription means it has to be endogenous to bitcoin. Bitcoin as a system works because it doesn't make any external reference to anything else. The only thing that is an external reference is the miners make a loose association based on what time it is and how much time has passed in between blocks. But that is all still enforced by proof of work. The mean time pass, the MTP.
00:40:17.482 - 00:40:25.530, Speaker B: There's a bunch of technical ways on how all of the miners in the nodes check each other to make sure no one's lying about the time. All to be said, bitcoin is this internal system that only references itself.
00:40:25.602 - 00:40:26.214, Speaker A: Right.
00:40:26.794 - 00:41:02.506, Speaker B: Inscriptions have to be endogenous to bitcoin because people have already started talking about, oh, I'm just going to make a pointer and push it off to this other. And okay, that does technically work and you can do that, but it is somewhat antithetical to the idea of what it is to have an inscription because one of Casey's big touch points here, and he's very sensitive to, and I agree with this, is that consumer protection, understanding. People were buying jpegs on Ethereum, not realizing it was just pointing to an s three bucket somewhere. And that one day that server could get shut offline. And what you thought what you bought is now gone permanently. And what's interesting is that bitcoin is now this place where people are using it for data storage. That has to be one of the pieces here.
00:41:02.506 - 00:41:33.762, Speaker B: I think the idea of also being able to push code and being able to have interactions of these interactions of inscriptions, talking to other inscriptions, it's so early in understanding what that means for the impact of bitcoin, not just from a fee market and the block space is never being empty again. But what does it mean to have this decentralized hard drive that everyone's going to be able to use for putting their data and how it's all going to interact with each other and then the actual tagging of the individual ordinal sats, I think that's actually going to be one of the larger plays, is actually finding rare sats and stuff.
00:41:33.818 - 00:42:13.672, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the ordinals are the satoshis and the inscriptions are the data. And part of what Casey did with ordinal theory and his ord wallet is not only make it a tool for uploading inscriptions, but also cataloging the sats and making it possible to sort of bind the sat to the inscription. But here's one thing that we've been thinking a lot about, and to me, this is actually, when it comes to NFT use cases in particular, a little bit of a. I don't want to say a negative. It's not really there. Okay, so, like, you're right. So, like, you have nfts on Ethereum, right?
00:42:13.728 - 00:42:13.992, Speaker B: Sure.
00:42:14.048 - 00:42:25.496, Speaker A: They're actual tokens now. You're right. The data might not actually be there. So you got maybe no data, but you haven't, I'm gonna say a physical token, but a token that actually is recognized as existing by the consensus protocol.
00:42:25.560 - 00:42:26.152, Speaker B: That's right.
00:42:26.248 - 00:43:06.168, Speaker A: On bitcoin, you have the data is there, but not really a token. In fact, the token, the binding only exists if you run a separate layer on top. And you say, we're gonna look at sats this way. Right. And so I think it's a little deficient from a tooling standpoint for tokenization to Ethereum's setup, which is purpose built for this. But you have this digital stone tablet in the bitcoin ledger, where you can actually have data availability there in a much more permanent way. So it's kind of like, to me, I've been trying to figure out, again, sticking just to the sort of NFT market use case as we know it today, which types of NFT artwork might be better for one and not the other.
00:43:06.216 - 00:43:06.616, Speaker B: Right.
00:43:06.720 - 00:43:13.826, Speaker A: And I think there are some, to be clear. But that ordinal theory isn't. It's not really a real thing, right. Or is it? How do you think about it?
00:43:13.850 - 00:43:27.282, Speaker B: Yeah, so that's interesting, thinking through that. I think if you're thinking about the token and wrapping a token as an asset, wrapping it through more complicated smart contracts, those are all things that more beneficial itself to Ethereum because of the open ended nature of solidity and being able to write the more complicated.
00:43:27.378 - 00:43:28.858, Speaker A: Right. And it's purpose built for this.
00:43:28.946 - 00:43:36.974, Speaker B: Yeah. I do believe, though, that there's going to be more wallet support over time and understanding the ordinal stuff, because at the end of the day, you're just, it's a shared hallucination.
00:43:37.094 - 00:43:37.374, Speaker A: Right.
00:43:37.414 - 00:43:42.030, Speaker B: And if everyone can opt into it and understand that, it can work. I've, you know, I agree it can work.
00:43:42.102 - 00:43:58.854, Speaker A: I agree. But I do think, like, it isn't a shared hallucination on Ethereum. Again, the token architecture, that's real. There's plenty of shared hallucination going on in Ethereum and elsewhere, but not that specifically. But I agree. I think you're right. I think the tool is widely adopted.
00:43:58.854 - 00:44:20.278, Speaker A: The ordinal theory, like, it'll, then it will work. I agree. But I think that's one of the interesting things we've been thinking through, is if you need token existence more granular and defined, or if you need data availability more granular and defined, that may determine and sort of shape, again, thinking just about the JPEG market, right?
00:44:20.326 - 00:44:20.582, Speaker B: Sure.
00:44:20.638 - 00:44:35.746, Speaker A: What types of artwork might be more or less appropriate for bitcoin versus ETH. There wasn't that ability to even have that question until recently. I think it's very exciting and interesting that there is that question, but I don't think it's going to look exactly like ETH's NFT market.
00:44:35.810 - 00:44:59.706, Speaker B: No. This is what's really interesting. And for me, I've been getting a lot of inbound questions and like, how does this all work? And I jokingly say, you're now in my playground. We're talking about bitcoin, right. And the fact that all of this stuff is natively operated on bitcoin's Utxo set and it uses bitcoin security. I think there's a lot of new ways to understanding what it is to manage share transfer doing marketplaces. I've been putting thought into like, structure.
00:44:59.770 - 00:45:00.746, Speaker A: You might do that.
00:45:00.850 - 00:45:10.634, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think ultimately the only tool that supports ordinals right now is the original command line reference implementation.
00:45:10.714 - 00:45:11.170, Speaker A: Ord.
00:45:11.242 - 00:45:55.326, Speaker B: Ord, O R D. And I think what's going to happen, you will have interoperability, though, because you can have shared consensus on these things, and as long as you can have that shared consensus and everyone agrees to certain value, like the token may literally exist on ethereum. And I guess maybe if you're thinking about like distributions of airdrops and other assets and doing that programmatically as opposed to manually, that could be maybe where that stuff comes in. I actually, this is a bit of a contrarian thing. I threw this out there and people started really hard pushing back on me. There's no reason why you couldn't take an ordinal sat and wrap it into a token and put it on like liquid or some other smart contracting platform and have all of that functionality of the token itself operating on a higher smart contracting layer. And then you bring the abstraction back down to the base chain.
00:45:55.326 - 00:46:04.830, Speaker B: I think there's no reason why you couldn't do that. And it allows you to have your cake and eat it, too. With the data availability in combination with the token representative and asset you could wrap into other use cases.
00:46:05.022 - 00:46:30.358, Speaker A: It's very, very interesting. So we talked about bitcoin and ETH and NFTs. One of the things I saw that you guys, I guess you were doing it in Nashville, was that Jason Williams, formerly, I think, formally of Morgan Creek Digital, but also a well known crypto investor in general. What did he do? He did something to one of his bored apes. He had a bored ape. Nft. Yuga Labs issued NFT.
00:46:30.358 - 00:46:32.806, Speaker A: These are high value things, first of all.
00:46:32.870 - 00:46:53.550, Speaker B: Yeah, what did he do? So Casey dropped a tweet saying, the first person to permanently burn their ethereum, bored ape yacht club or crypto punk as a one way push over to an inscription will be an absolute legend. And then Jason tweeted as a reply, help me. He wanted to do that. And I saw that, I was like, and I tapped.
00:46:53.662 - 00:47:01.678, Speaker A: Perfect kind of guy for it. He's a well known guy. He's been in crypto a long time. He's probably. He can have, you know, if it somehow failed, like, whatever, he would. He'd be okay.
00:47:01.726 - 00:47:17.494, Speaker B: He did an interview talking about this, and he said, it's kind of like throwing a Lamborghini into a trash compactor. It's really fun. That's how he described the whole interaction. So I told Casey, I was like, hey, I have someone. He wants to burn a monkey. And Casey was like, are you serious? I was like, yeah, no, I know him. Like, he wants to burn the monkey.
00:47:17.494 - 00:47:21.074, Speaker B: And I was like, what do we do? He's like, we write code right now.
00:47:21.694 - 00:47:22.654, Speaker A: We make it possible.
00:47:22.734 - 00:47:24.758, Speaker B: And we friend to the corner.
00:47:24.846 - 00:47:27.262, Speaker A: And we were, this is itcoin park, by the way.
00:47:27.278 - 00:47:28.134, Speaker B: Bitcoin park in Nashville.
00:47:28.174 - 00:47:42.526, Speaker A: Again, shout out, bitcoin park. If you're in Nashville, you've got to check it out. Rod and Matt have done an awesome job with that thing. Love that. It's kind of like a bitcoin wework, but it's super nice also. I was actually. I thought it was going to be more like a frat house, but this is like top tier space.
00:47:42.590 - 00:47:53.746, Speaker B: It's exceptionally clean. Nice space. I am a national member, so it's kind of like if you come into town, I get to use that as my co working space for myself. My company, they put on a really great show, but Casey, Casey, you're there.
00:47:53.770 - 00:47:55.386, Speaker A: You guys are. So now you're. Now you're coding?
00:47:55.450 - 00:48:00.882, Speaker B: Yeah, so now we're coding. So we start talking about, okay, how do we make this reference pointer? And we're.
00:48:00.938 - 00:48:11.978, Speaker A: You don't want to just send. This was why a lot of the sort of like, you know, they didn't know. A lot of the ethereum criticism of Jason was, oh, you didn't send it to the burn address, but like, explain what you guys built.
00:48:12.066 - 00:48:38.404, Speaker B: You're in our house now. You're playing by bitcoin rules. So we're not playing by your Ethereum rules. So very specifically, you want to have a one to one relationship between an inscription with the ordinal client on bitcoin in an Ethereum address. So Casey and I were discussing about what's the proper way to do this. And we came to the conclusion that each inscription id is unique. And what you can do is you can hash that and truncate it and map it to specifically an Ethereum address.
00:48:38.404 - 00:49:02.824, Speaker B: And the way this works is you take your inscription, you make it on an ordinal client, you hash it, encode it using what's called Teleburn, Casey's term. Teleburn, teleport burn. And we sat there and he ran it through the, he wrote the code of the function. It was pretty straightforward. Don't want to get too much in the details. You take a hash of the inscription id and you truncate it so it fits to an Ethereum address.
00:49:03.604 - 00:49:05.108, Speaker A: Create an Ethereum address, you create an.
00:49:05.116 - 00:49:11.428, Speaker B: Ethereum address, determine, derive from the inscription id to prove for a fact that you didn't like. Jason's not holding the key anywhere.
00:49:11.476 - 00:49:17.060, Speaker A: Right. Because you're only deriving a public address. You don't know the key that underlies it.
00:49:17.132 - 00:49:27.724, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. And it's very straightforward to do is the code because the original Ethereum client did not encode a checksum. If it's all uppercase or all lowercase. There is no checksum in Ethereum.
00:49:27.804 - 00:49:28.620, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:49:28.772 - 00:49:48.346, Speaker B: Very bold design strategy to let someone typo yeet off their entire net worth. But that's what Vitalik decided is the best course of action. So we use that to write less lines of code. So we went through this entire process and the first thing Casey did was he took his rotomore ETH and he ripped it to the Genesis inscription because he wrote, he's only made one inscription which was a genesis.
00:49:48.370 - 00:49:52.922, Speaker A: That was the only one he's done that's the only cool, like, sort of aztec looking scar.
00:49:52.978 - 00:50:01.226, Speaker B: Yeah, like Day of the dead. Yeah, like, it's very cool. I love that one. Yeah. So that was. Yeah, so that's the genesis inscription that Casey made and he made.
00:50:01.290 - 00:50:13.286, Speaker A: And he burned his ETH address to that inscription. Yeah. So now he. Theoretically. So, okay, let's go back to Jason, though, like. So Jason burns this punk and reissues it to himself or inscribes the image.
00:50:13.310 - 00:50:14.670, Speaker B: Of it for ape yacht club. It's a monkey.
00:50:14.702 - 00:50:15.126, Speaker A: Sorry, sorry.
00:50:15.150 - 00:50:17.726, Speaker B: The monkey. Not the respect for the blonde dawn.
00:50:17.790 - 00:50:18.238, Speaker A: My fault.
00:50:18.286 - 00:50:19.874, Speaker B: That's the nickname he has for it.
00:50:20.774 - 00:50:30.142, Speaker A: So his board, ape, is now sitting visible on Ethereum in this address that he provably. No one he provably doesn't control.
00:50:30.238 - 00:50:30.942, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:50:31.118 - 00:50:36.326, Speaker A: Could you dice roll and somebody could just generate a new address and theoretically come up with the private key for.
00:50:36.350 - 00:50:42.042, Speaker B: That address on ETH is deterministically possible. If you've ever seen those addresses on bitcoin, though, like the one.
00:50:42.218 - 00:50:43.098, Speaker A: Vanity addresses.
00:50:43.146 - 00:50:49.922, Speaker B: Vanity addresses that are so long and arbitrary, you just know for a fact it's like hiding a needle in a haystack the size of the universe.
00:50:49.978 - 00:50:51.394, Speaker A: So it's possible, but it's very hard.
00:50:51.474 - 00:50:53.250, Speaker B: It's computationally possible, but. Right.
00:50:53.362 - 00:51:00.034, Speaker A: That was one of the things that. It's not specifically a dead address, it's just one that we provably don't have the key for.
00:51:00.154 - 00:51:03.474, Speaker B: It's one of two to the 160 possible addresses in Ethereum.
00:51:03.514 - 00:51:03.930, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:51:04.042 - 00:51:18.930, Speaker B: So at that point, you're equally likely just to find Vitalik's address or Coinbase address. Right. You're hiding in such a large stack like that. Security assumption is like, at that point, you're rolling a dice so many times, you're equally likely to find any other Ethereum address before you even find that one.
00:51:18.962 - 00:51:24.538, Speaker A: That actually has he destroyed. Effectively now it still lives on. He teleported.
00:51:24.666 - 00:51:26.874, Speaker B: It's ascended to the big one way.
00:51:26.914 - 00:51:28.610, Speaker A: Bridge, basically what has been created.
00:51:28.642 - 00:51:33.754, Speaker B: It's a one way bridge, and it's not been destroyed because it's living now as an ordinal. It's an inscription in an ordinal side.
00:51:33.794 - 00:51:34.042, Speaker C: You're right.
00:51:34.058 - 00:51:38.354, Speaker A: It's actually now on a digital stone tablet. One that is the most secure on earth.
00:51:38.434 - 00:51:39.114, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:51:39.234 - 00:51:39.626, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:51:39.690 - 00:51:40.842, Speaker B: And it's kind of ascended.
00:51:40.898 - 00:51:41.698, Speaker A: Pretty funny.
00:51:41.826 - 00:51:43.498, Speaker B: It's very interesting.
00:51:43.546 - 00:51:46.010, Speaker A: It's a troll, right? I mean, Jason is trolling here.
00:51:46.082 - 00:52:17.354, Speaker B: I think it's a very legitimate statement. And we're already talking about this idea of, like, art and like, where does it live. All of, like, the ordinal client is a shared hallucination, right? Like, there is nothing in bitcoin code that says, this is ordinal number. This. This is all art and aesthetics, and these are all things that are cultural movements. So I would push back and say that it's a silly troll, because I've had at least five to six, seven different people messaging me asking, can you make me a teleburn address for my asset? People are starting to run off with this. And understanding that you want to have permanence of your asset, this is the way to do it.
00:52:17.394 - 00:52:33.130, Speaker A: Yeah. So there's a lot of issues at play. We're going to. We've talked to some of them at Casey, with Casey. We've got a report we're preparing on inscriptions and ordinals, that sort of documents for those who haven't been in the weeds, you know, say, on bitcoin, Twitter and elsewhere on the debates around, like, is this good or bad?
00:52:33.202 - 00:52:33.674, Speaker B: Right.
00:52:33.794 - 00:53:09.774, Speaker A: I'm not going to preview too much of that, except to say that I think on a net basis, this were very, very positive on inscriptions, both for the network, for the various use cases, for the security of bitcoin, for a whole bunch of reasons. So let's not hash those out. But it really is, I think it's very, very positive and interesting that now bitcoin and bitcoiners are playing in this large market. I mean, nfts did, like, 19 or $20 billion in trade volume in 2021 alone, which is about half of what the art Basel says that the world's art market was.
00:53:10.154 - 00:53:24.098, Speaker B: We're not playing it. We're going to own it. Bitcoin's going to own this. This is where and how early this is. I think we now have, I would say, also a larger capital base of people that are playing around in bitcoin. The tooling and the developer workspace.
00:53:24.226 - 00:53:25.506, Speaker A: It's early, but it's coming.
00:53:25.610 - 00:53:51.584, Speaker B: It's early and it's coming. And this is going to be the cultural marks. And you get to this stuff, the cat's out of the back. You're not gonna be able to put this back in the box. And I think you have the synergy now. I've never seen simultaneously, people in bitcoin. I've had a lot of bitcoin people who do, longtime community members, people that are very involved in the space, that are begging me to work with them, to send inscriptions.
00:53:51.584 - 00:53:54.116, Speaker B: This is culturally out of the gate.
00:53:54.180 - 00:54:03.136, Speaker A: It's really interesting, though. There is. There is still pushback. So we're going to. This is creating a very healthy and interesting robust discussion around what bitcoin is supposed to be used for.
00:54:03.200 - 00:54:18.968, Speaker B: Well, this is the thing. Bitcoin is. Bitcoin exists. And it's very ironic to me that people talking about this decentralized governess movement, bitcoin, taking pride that code actually is law. That was always the jab at ethereum, like, well, code's not law because you guys, you undid the rollback.
00:54:19.016 - 00:54:25.212, Speaker A: Yeah. You did the Dow hack, right? Yeah. So technically, I believe they refer to that as an irregular state transition.
00:54:25.268 - 00:54:27.996, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. Right. That's what the marketing team came up.
00:54:28.020 - 00:54:32.652, Speaker A: Because they didn't actually, in their defense. Yes, they did. And it wasn't a literal rollback.
00:54:32.788 - 00:54:33.276, Speaker B: Undo.
00:54:33.340 - 00:54:37.404, Speaker A: Yeah, they didn't actually roll back the blocks. They actually just dipped into them and reversed specific things.
00:54:37.444 - 00:54:38.548, Speaker B: It's also not a rollback if you.
00:54:38.556 - 00:54:40.508, Speaker A: Just stole funds from addresses.
00:54:40.556 - 00:54:44.484, Speaker B: Well, that's what I mean. If you just give me all Satoshi's coins and not roll back the chain, I'm totally fine with that, too.
00:54:44.524 - 00:54:44.700, Speaker A: Right.
00:54:44.732 - 00:54:45.756, Speaker B: It has the same economic output.
00:54:45.780 - 00:54:46.252, Speaker A: I like that.
00:54:46.308 - 00:54:58.012, Speaker B: But the point being is that this was all done within the design space of bitcoin. And bitcoin is for enemies and has to be an adversarial workspace. And I think genuinely, the only option less is if you don't like it, you can ignore it or you can fork it.
00:54:58.068 - 00:54:59.116, Speaker A: And you can ignore it.
00:54:59.180 - 00:55:00.188, Speaker B: You absolutely can ignore it.
00:55:00.196 - 00:55:11.004, Speaker A: You can discard witness data. You can only validate, you know, up through assume valid. You can use the checkpoint you cannot run or you cannot recognize ordinal theory. There's plenty of ways, I think, to ignore it.
00:55:11.044 - 00:55:47.920, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think the responsible thing to do if you're an Ord disrespector is to give it. Give it a couple months. Maybe you're to understand, is this, is this going to die? Because a lot of critics would say this is just a fad and everyone six months is going to be crying over spilled grapes. Totally possible, I don't think, likely or probabilistic, but it could happen because you don't want to hastily have a fork. But I think genuinely, if you're trying to change this, you want a fork and maybe decrease the block size because you don't want to actually fork out ordinals because then you're just going to have other ways of embedding the data. And actually, the way that Casey's done this with witness data is actually much more healthy for the blockchain as opposed to storing it in different.
00:55:47.992 - 00:55:49.400, Speaker A: Right. It's extremely elegant.
00:55:49.432 - 00:55:56.600, Speaker B: The solution, your node doesn't have to validate it. It's wrapped in an op, false op if statement, meaning that your node never has to validate the JPEG. It does skip it.
00:55:56.632 - 00:55:56.824, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:55:56.864 - 00:56:03.664, Speaker B: It literally does skip it. It's not signature validation that needs to take into consideration. Forking is the way to do this. With a decreased block size.
00:56:03.704 - 00:56:03.944, Speaker A: Yep.
00:56:03.984 - 00:56:36.928, Speaker B: I think that's the only way that if you're going to maintain consensus and try and build a coalition, it then does have a Pete Rizzo, I believe, calls the degens paradox, in that the moment you try to, like, change this behavior and move it out of bitcoin, it makes the ones that predate that more valuable. So this is a real structural problem that you need to start thinking about of, like, it's an evolving market, it's an anarchic, leaderless movement, and you have to understand that if you want to do a change, you can do it, but you have to start building a coalition. That takes time. You don't unilaterally just come down from on high and say, this is no longer allowed, because that's not how bitcoin works. The miners love this, too. So you have a large percentage of.
00:56:36.936 - 00:56:38.256, Speaker A: These large coalition that likes it.
00:56:38.280 - 00:56:44.176, Speaker B: There's a large coalition that likes it. And the only thing I think that could possibly be done is a block size decrease. You're not going to be able to remove this, though.
00:56:44.240 - 00:56:50.848, Speaker A: Yeah, not without rolling back essential features like Segwit and Taproot that people want for other reasons. Right. Yeah, it's basically impossible.
00:56:50.896 - 00:57:01.324, Speaker B: And you could try to do very specific edits of, like, removing ordinals, but then they're just gonna find new ways to encode it, and then. So it's a cat and mouse game that you're never gonna win. You're better off. I think the easiest way is the block size decrease.
00:57:01.824 - 00:57:08.832, Speaker A: Rob Hamilton, co founder, CEO of Anchor Watch before we wrap, you're gonna rap.
00:57:08.928 - 00:57:09.368, Speaker B: That's right.
00:57:09.416 - 00:57:12.544, Speaker A: Rob's written a rap. He's challenging intangible coins here.
00:57:12.584 - 00:57:16.086, Speaker B: Oh, no challenge. Just an ode of not respect for the medium.
00:57:16.160 - 00:57:18.042, Speaker A: He's gonna do it a spoken word. Let's hear it, baby.
00:57:18.138 - 00:57:28.474, Speaker B: Check it. I got something new that'll keep your bitcoin safe. You better not snooze. Trident wallet powered by miniscript. We'll make sure your bitcoin is secure. Do not trip. Miniscript is the key.
00:57:28.474 - 00:57:53.138, Speaker B: Let me tell you why. If you sink on a boat, I'll keep your coins dry. We'll set up a contract, a smart one at that.
