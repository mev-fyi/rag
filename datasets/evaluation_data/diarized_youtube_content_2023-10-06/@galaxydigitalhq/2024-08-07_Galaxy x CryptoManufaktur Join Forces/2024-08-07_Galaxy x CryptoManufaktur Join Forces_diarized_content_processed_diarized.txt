00:00:10.240 - 00:00:58.700, Speaker A: Welcome to the infinite Jungle. On today's show, I have with me back again, Nixxo and Yorick, my two favorite ethereum staking gurus. We are very excited to talk about two pretty major topics, I guess. The first is Galaxy's acquisition of crypto manufacturer, and the second is orbit SSF, which is extremely technical and mathematical, but we'll get into it maybe. Before we get started with the show, though, here is a quick show disclaimer. I need to remind you to please refer to the disclaimer linked in the podcast show notes, and note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice, an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Hi, Nixo and Yoricke.
00:00:58.700 - 00:01:03.078, Speaker A: It's been a long time. You guys have not come back on.
00:01:03.094 - 00:01:21.530, Speaker B: The show for a while, I think both. Yeah, both York and I, our life is constantly in flux. Well, York, just for right now, with moving regions and everything, but I'm always. I'm constantly moving around.
00:01:21.830 - 00:01:46.960, Speaker A: Well, I very much appreciate you guys coming back because it was always so fun to talk, and I would like to reintroduce Yorick as a fellow Galaxy comrade, a fellow galaxy colleague. Now. So much has changed, but also so much hasn't. Yorick, do you want to go over kind of like, what has happened and how you're feeling about it? Are you happy to be part of the Galaxy family?
00:01:48.420 - 00:01:52.920, Speaker C: Of course I am. And it says so in my contract that I am.
00:01:53.700 - 00:01:56.172, Speaker A: This is. Yeah, maybe I should set it up.
00:01:56.236 - 00:01:57.320, Speaker C: Kidding aside.
00:01:59.820 - 00:02:14.600, Speaker B: I kind of appreciate this that you're gonna be. Do you ever watch John Oliver? He does the whole, like, h. He does the whole, like, hbo daddy or whatever it is. Like, I'm not gonna bow down to. I'm gonna say whatever I think, even though this is my parent company.
00:02:15.700 - 00:02:16.268, Speaker A: Nice.
00:02:16.364 - 00:02:19.876, Speaker B: I love it. Yorick can be the John Oliver of the crypto space.
00:02:20.068 - 00:02:21.804, Speaker A: John Oliver of Galaxy.
00:02:21.972 - 00:02:24.708, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm already the John Oliver of Lido.
00:02:24.764 - 00:02:37.344, Speaker A: So the John Oliver. How. How has the reception been from your staking circles and stuff of the announcement that we are now won?
00:02:37.512 - 00:03:05.850, Speaker C: Yeah, really positive. People have been very happy for me personally and overall think this is a good thing. Obviously, there's some due diligence to be done, which is being done right now. So if you're curious, you can go to the Lido governance forums, for example, and you'll see a thread there on, you know, crypto wonder. Furture was acquired by Galaxy does not change anything at all. My position is it doesn't really. It was a full asset acquisition.
00:03:05.850 - 00:03:32.250, Speaker C: So the team remains the same. Everything we're running remains exactly the same. We just have more resources now with Galaxy, which we hope to bring to bear. Crypto manufacturer is tiny, like, or was tiny. Three engineers. That's it. So we managed to run all this with three sres, me being one of them, mostly because extremely heavy reliance on automation.
00:03:32.250 - 00:03:42.610, Speaker C: And hopefully with the Galaxy team, we can have a little bit more followers on and better on call rotation.
00:03:43.590 - 00:03:48.526, Speaker B: Is it also a conversation with rocket pool because you run an Oda node, right?
00:03:48.718 - 00:04:08.930, Speaker C: Yeah. So that's ongoing. Not super fast. I believe the best thing there to do is to. Because the name is attached is to put in a leave proposal for the crypto manufacturer or and then a joint proposal for galaxy. So we'll be on your note.
00:04:09.830 - 00:04:16.230, Speaker A: Gotcha. Nice. The governance processes for this is totally new. It's not something that it is.
00:04:16.310 - 00:04:27.026, Speaker C: It doesn't happen often. And, you know, lido in particular, I think rocket pool as well, they're kind of like, hmm, we should have governance processes for this. Why don't we do this now?
00:04:27.218 - 00:04:51.120, Speaker B: I think also, not only does it not happen very often, but I think that people are. Tend to be less transparent than Yorick in all his dealings. And so, like, I think this is probably the first time that they've had someone come through and go, like, putting it out, all out on the table. This is what's going on. We need a process for this, rather than somebody being like, maybe this just won't get talked about.
00:04:51.580 - 00:05:09.780, Speaker A: And I think it happens more often than people think with prism. And there was a couple others that Izzy had mentioned in his Lida post talking about this acquisition. And it sounded to me like Izzy was very supportive, knowing that all of the operations would stay the same. And the main change is really that there's more reason.
00:05:09.820 - 00:05:29.132, Speaker C: Yeah, so Prism is a prime example. They were, of course, very open about it. They were acquired by off chain labs, so they're now part of the L2 ecosystem. And I think at the time it was just a non event. They just continued. Right. There was no discussion, no forum post, as far as I know.
00:05:29.132 - 00:05:37.684, Speaker C: And what's being done now is to say, well, maybe we should have some form of process around this when it happens.
00:05:37.812 - 00:05:53.020, Speaker B: I also kind of like that this is a success story of a solo staker because Yorick started out solo staking and started a business running validators and has found a lot of success doing this.
00:05:53.400 - 00:05:54.200, Speaker C: Yep.
00:05:54.360 - 00:06:09.488, Speaker A: And I am so, so excited to be working more closely with you, Yorick. It's wonderful. It's kind of crazy to see you on the slacks sometimes I'm like, wow, this is a guy I used to dm on Twitter. I used to have to, you know, telegram him, you know, all on the more like none.
00:06:09.504 - 00:06:12.808, Speaker C: You can just do it and you can just slide into my slacks, right?
00:06:12.864 - 00:06:45.940, Speaker A: Yeah, slide into your slack. Yes, exactly. Yes. Well, I'm so excited for you. The cool things that projects and stuff that I'm sure crypto manufacturer will be able to do now with galaxy resources, different ways in which services will be able to expand. Looking forward to all of that. And when we have both of you back on, which we definitely will, because I love talking to you guys, we can talk about those exciting announcements too, on the show.
00:06:45.940 - 00:07:20.760, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, let's get right onto the next topic of discussion, which is orbit single slot finality. This is a topic that Nyxo, you brought to my attention, and I am still trying to wrap my head around. It is very dense. But I get the point that the two main things that we're trying to do is cap the validator size and increase solo staking viability. So do you mind just giving a rundown of how this proposal caps validators and improves solo staking viability?
00:07:21.380 - 00:07:44.134, Speaker B: Yes. So I think we're all trying to figure it out. It is a very dense thing. And Yorick and I were talking about it, we were going through it. It solves some issues that he is concerned about and generally, like, when I see solo stakers in the title of a proposal, I want to know what it is. So we were talking about it. We were like, this would actually be a really good topic to talk about on the infinite jungle.
00:07:44.134 - 00:08:58.521, Speaker B: So, disclaimer, I don't think that I have the best handle on this, but I will go with what I've understood so far. So the idea is that you have, this was first proposed by actually Vitalik, and it was kind of expanded upon by this blog post. So the idea is you have like a solid core of large validators who are in this active validator set instead of every validator who has stake being part of the active validator set. And the goal of this is to shrink the number of validators, shrink the number of signatures that are being aggregated so that they can do all, it can enable all the stuff that they want with single slot finality. And this sort of is in tandem with Max EB because a problem. So Max EB is supposed to encourage people to consolidate a bunch of validators that they run, if they run it on single hardware or on single setups. But there's not really any incentive right now for people to adopt Max EB.
00:08:58.521 - 00:10:25.162, Speaker B: There is an incentive for solo stakers to adopt Max EB because then we'll get compounded rewards because then we can earn on 30, 32 or 33, 34, 35 eth. But for larger validators, one of the concerns Yorick will bring up, I'll graze over it real quick and then he can actually tell you what it is, is that if you run 1000 validators on one setup and you see a slashing event, you can actually catch that slashing event before all of your validators are slashed. But under this regime, if you have all of them in one validator or all of your stake in one validator, that slashing event gets all of it at the same time. And even if you reduce the valid, the slashing penalty, so they are going to move the slashing penalty down from one eTH per validator to 0.0078 ETH, which is a drastic reduction. Even if you reduce that, it's still bad for professional operator because all of a sudden you have put a lot more stake in a slash state, which is bad as a professional operator because that's your job and you don't want to all of a sudden have a bunch of validators in slash state. So I think that this sort of incentivizes orbit SSF sort of incentivizes people to take advantage of Max EB a little bit more.
00:10:25.162 - 00:10:59.980, Speaker B: Um, and the stated, the stated purpose of this is that it does it in a way that solo stakers should be, um, still relevant to this. But the more I read it, the more I kind of feel like they're shoehorning solo stakers into this and that it isn't maybe actually beneficial for solo stakers. But that's also like first pass understanding of it. And I actually, I hope that, um, Francesco listens to this, so maybe he can get like an understanding of what people understand when they read this paper, because maybe he has some stuff to correct.
00:11:00.320 - 00:11:04.180, Speaker C: That would be lovely. Yes, I'll take all the corrections we can get.
00:11:04.600 - 00:11:14.340, Speaker A: Why, why do you get the sense, Nick, so that it's not actually helping solo stakers? Like where does the skepticism lie?
00:11:14.640 - 00:11:52.472, Speaker B: Okay, so the idea is that you have the stable core of larger validators and that the smaller validators are sort of like orbiting, so they're sometimes active, sometimes not, whereas the larger validators are pretty much almost always active. And so the the more the, okay, so say the active validator set is 8192. They want. That's what they're targeting. That's, they want 8192 numbers. Okay, it's a, it's a power of two.
00:11:52.496 - 00:11:53.480, Speaker C: Two to the power off.
00:11:53.560 - 00:11:54.220, Speaker A: Oh.
00:11:56.480 - 00:12:35.400, Speaker B: So say they're targeting that number and we actually only have that many validators. That that means that rewards are highest for everybody. Whereas if you have a large number of validators who are inactive at any point, that's it. Actually, it's the consolidated rewards go down for everybody. So it encourages validators to consolidate because the rewards for everybody go up over the entire validator set. If there are fewer validators on the network. Is that your understanding too, Yorick?
00:12:35.900 - 00:12:50.864, Speaker C: More or less. So if I can, do you want me to kind of lay out? Sure. So you have one disclaimer here. I'll add a second disclaimer. Remind me what your first disclaimer was. Oh, yes. We don't fully understand it.
00:12:50.912 - 00:12:51.816, Speaker B: That's right.
00:12:52.008 - 00:13:17.960, Speaker C: That is my disclaimer as well. The second disclaimer I'd like to make is this is heavy research. Like this is discussion level stuff. Research level stuff. None of this is set in stone. None of it is even close to an Ethereum improvement proposal, an EIP meaning implementation in clients and inclusion in our hard fork. Right.
00:13:17.960 - 00:13:51.454, Speaker C: So let me step back a little. You said this came from one of Vitalik's ideas. So Vitalik really wants something called single slot finality. Ssf. The idea behind single slot finality is that Ethereum, instead of finalizing in roughly 15 minutes or so, right now, two epochs, thereabouts, right. It can finalize every slot. And there's nuances to that, like how high is the economic security? When you read the paper, you'll see like that they have a step function.
00:13:51.454 - 00:14:47.860, Speaker C: Right? Right. Now it is no economic security until 64 slots have passed and then full economic security, that's final. And they're looking at in the first slot a little bit, second slot more, third slot more, fourth slot even more, I think after four or five slots where the 100% in economic security. Right. So that's definitely a good, when you think about use cases that currently not, don't have any theory, but that might be interesting things like let's say I'm in a country where banking is just not stable, right? And I'd like to be able to pay with Ethereum. Okay? So since we now have extremely low fees on L2 since the last hard fork, you could use a L2 for that. But it takes 15 minutes to finalize, no matter what you're doing.
00:14:47.860 - 00:15:20.532, Speaker C: There are some L2s, so we can work around that and have our own finality. But still, the base layer finality is 15 minutes. So making that single slot and being able to say this stuff is final right away, within 12 seconds, to my mind, enables use cases like payment processes. Right. 12 seconds is close enough to visa that it doesn't matter. I can wait 12 seconds for my latte to go through, but not 15 minutes. Thank you.
00:15:20.532 - 00:16:01.392, Speaker C: At that point, I'm back in my car and probably finished drinking it, you know, so that's what single slot finality is. Now, from a technical perspective, we right now have 1 million plus final letters in the set. This is not feasible for single slot finality. It's technically, at this point in time, not possible. Also including the. And I'm sorry, I'm bringing this into the kind of the wider ecosystem idea, including the ethereum ethos of this short run on the home PCs. This should run on mini PCs, right.
00:16:01.392 - 00:16:44.214, Speaker C: Everybody should be able to participate like solo stickers. We don't want huge machines in order to handle consensus. Of course, you could say, what do we care? You know, just reduce this to a few extremely beefy machines and data centers, and we can do whatever we want, compute wise. But that's not the design of the design is to keep solo stickers viable. So we need a smaller validator set, not just for single slot finality. By the way, we've seen that at around 2 million validators, the whole consensus algorithm fails to finalize, stays live, but it can no longer finalize. It's too much.
00:16:44.214 - 00:17:01.594, Speaker C: It can't aggregate signatures fast enough. We know that 1.6 million still works. That's where Horoshki is at right now. So another reason to reduce this. Right? So now we get to orbit sff. So we talked about single slot finality.
00:17:01.594 - 00:17:29.960, Speaker C: Nixon talked a little bit about what orbit is. This idea of a stable core with rotating validators in the set around the exact number is being discussed. The orbit paper right now talks about roughly 32,000. Wieselik wanted roughly 8000 for SSF. Those numbers will be bike shed until the cows come home. Right. They'll figure out what the exact number should be once they know what the mechanism should be.
00:17:29.960 - 00:18:16.330, Speaker C: So one thing that I think is really interesting that was discussed at a recent researcher retreat, week long retreat that Vitaly tweeted about, is that orbit SSF can be split, it can be orbit and then SSF. So we could do orbit before we do SSF. And what that enables would be validators with three to four ETH. So. And the reason it does that is because the reason we don't have three to four ETH validators right now, it would explode the validator set to a point where Ethereum consensus would just fail immediately. Right.
00:18:16.710 - 00:18:31.118, Speaker A: Just to clarify about the functionality of this orbit SSF, if there is a core set of validators, do their responsibilities differ from the orbiting validators? The validators that are smaller?
00:18:31.174 - 00:19:02.652, Speaker C: No. And this is where the paper gets into more detail. There are, there are a corner case failure states if you just randomly sample the validators, where you don't have enough economic security in a given slot because you have just a couple 32 ETH validators. Right. And you end up with, you're actually making yourself attackable, which you don't want. Right. And so the researchers actually use very strong language.
00:19:02.652 - 00:19:30.464, Speaker C: They said that all designs so far that try to do something similar have failed. That's their wording. And what they mean by failed is you're attackable. Your economic security is not what you think it is. And we're not going to get into. If you really want to, you can watch the discussion between Justin and whoever it was from Solana about economic securities and Anatoly. Anatoly, right.
00:19:30.464 - 00:19:48.432, Speaker C: Who says economic security is a meme? Well, we're in Ethereum, and we believe economic security is real and not a meme. So while we believe that we're gonna, we, meaning community researchers, et cetera, the whole thing is designed for economic security, meaning it costs this much to attack.
00:19:48.616 - 00:20:05.772, Speaker A: So there's a core set of validators that produce blocks that are frequently chosen to produce plots based on their stake weight. But the protocol randomly selects from this pool of, like, smaller, say, solo stakers, to occasionally produce a block just to keep them alive.
00:20:05.836 - 00:20:09.680, Speaker C: It's not just production, it's mandatory.
00:20:11.100 - 00:20:15.940, Speaker A: But they're chosen less frequently, is that right? And they are rewarded less frequently, and.
00:20:16.020 - 00:20:45.294, Speaker C: They are relative to the stake weight. So if, let's look at that. Let's say today I have 64 validators with 32 ETH each, and in IxO, you have one. I'm going to get 64 times the block production on average. Right. That's just how it's going to work out. That is still the case in this system just now.
00:20:45.294 - 00:21:53.376, Speaker C: My 64 validators are one with 2048 ETH, and it's completely proportional. If somebody has 1024 ETH, you know that that is then the proportional likelihood to get chosen versus a validator with 32 ETH, or a validator with 2048 ETH. So that there is a paper that looked into this to see, is it really true that nothing changes? And indeed it is truly true. As far as the likelihood to get a block, nothing changes with Max Eb. This is independent of orbit, by the way. This is just the maximum Ethereum balance change that is currently slated for the next hard fork in 2025 called Pektra. And the idea there is to voluntarily reduce the validator set by large operators, such as galaxy, voluntarily combining 64 of the validators into one and doing that through all of the ones they have.
00:21:53.376 - 00:21:58.260, Speaker C: Maybe keep a couple 32, right. But for the most part, make these really large validators.
00:21:59.080 - 00:22:08.600, Speaker A: So how does this then help solo validators? Again, if it's the same, if it's, you know, nothing really, Maxab does absolutely.
00:22:08.640 - 00:22:50.122, Speaker C: Nothing for solar validators. Orbit could, if it is combined with another thing. So one thing orbit does is reduce the number of validators in the validator set, and so reduce the number of signatures that need to be produced, and so make it possible for the Ethereum consensus to always run without issue. That means there is now room in the design space. And they were discussing this active to reduce the minimum balance of validator to three or four eth. Something along those lines. One of the hardest things for solar validator is to actually come up with 32 ETH.
00:22:50.122 - 00:23:18.488, Speaker C: That is challenging, right? Running the hardware, running the software, etcetera, is challenging as well. That kind of climb can be eased through work like Nixon does with estaker and their education. But the 32 ETH, or the 32 ETH, you got to have that if you want to truly solo validate and not go into some other staking protocol. Nick Scott, you look like you want to say something.
00:23:18.624 - 00:24:06.030, Speaker B: Yeah. So here's my problem with it, is that what it enables and the behavior that it incentivizes can be two very different things. And so if it enables three ETH validators, great. But are we going to see three ETH validators is really the question. So if the proposal is trying to incentivize people to consolidate, and it gives everyone across the network in general a higher yield, if more validators are consolidating, and keep in mind, it doesn't know if validators are correlated and should be consolidating. All it knows is we want some number of validators on the network. So it's just going to keep wanting more validators to consolidate until it reaches that threshold that it has set.
00:24:06.030 - 00:24:47.802, Speaker B: So what is what is what stops a liquid staking protocol from essentially vampire attacking solo stakers. By looking forward and saying, if we get all solo stakers off of the network, we're going to get a higher APR that we can then bundle and say, like, this is going to be the future rewards. If we can vampire attack solo stakers to come to bring their capital to a liquid staking protocol, and we can essentially give them that forward rewards by saying, if you dump your solo validator and bring your capital to us, we will give you all of those forward rewards right now. We will like, bring the incentives forward. So, like, the incentive is to get solo stakers off the network in that.
00:24:47.826 - 00:25:14.490, Speaker A: Case, but also to confirm, I don't think any of this is different from what we have now. Once Max EB is enabled through Electro, which it will be, the more validators consolidate, the higher the rewards that will be. For individual validators, there is an incentive. Yes, that's the dynamics. Risk and reward. The dynamic issuance policy for ethereum.
00:25:14.530 - 00:25:17.210, Speaker B: No, yield is based on the number.
00:25:17.290 - 00:25:28.978, Speaker C: Wait, no, no, they're going to change that. That's a good point. That's getting changed. So instead of saying the yield is by number of validators, it will be just. Bye is staked.
00:25:29.154 - 00:25:38.802, Speaker A: Right. So if you have less validators. Oh, I see. I guess the number of the stake seems the same. I see, right, so they were thinking about that.
00:25:38.826 - 00:25:43.950, Speaker C: They're 100% right. The intent is not to say yield is now 5% again.
00:25:44.730 - 00:25:51.482, Speaker A: I see. So the consolidated. Yeah, that was a little dumb of me, but yes. Okay, I see, I see. Yes, it's gonna be the same.
00:25:51.666 - 00:26:58.146, Speaker C: There are actually proposals to increase the socialized APY as more validators consolidate and early on increase the increase the individual apy of a consultant validator decreasing as we reach a threshold. So, Nixxio, that might answer your concern. That threshold also hasn't been defined. Again, research is being discussed. Right. One idea was to say, what if we say we want 80% of our data consolidated and the rest, the rest we want to keep open for solo stickers. So that curve that gives you a higher APY could end at point a and say, at that point, you know, we're no longer increasing, we're not giving an individual reward anymore, and the socialized reward is now capped.
00:26:58.146 - 00:26:59.910, Speaker C: Something along those lines.
00:27:00.330 - 00:27:16.460, Speaker B: Okay, and so what stops a solo or from a liquid staking protocol from then griefing by bringing on their own 32 ETH validators, or like three ETH validators, a bunch of three ETH validators. And then convincing solo stickers to then get off the network.
00:27:17.720 - 00:27:43.208, Speaker C: I don't think anything does. I think at some point you are getting to the social layer. If you are an LST and you start griefing hard, it'll be obvious, right. It will not be subtle. You're gonna spins up. You really think that's gonna be subtle? I think you're gonna spin up tens of thousands of little validators and it will be obvious. Right.
00:27:43.208 - 00:28:04.740, Speaker C: And then we'll have to see how people react to that. We have seen that with all the noise, around one third of stake in Lido, their stake has been reduced through nothing more than market forces to now 29%. Right. So people are looking at that risk and they're saying, I don't like the risk. I don't want them to get too big for leverages.
00:28:05.320 - 00:28:30.800, Speaker B: I also think, I also think like that that coincided with restaking coming online and people shifting their capital around. So I don't think we can attribute all of that to the social layer, especially when they've been focusing on a different product, which is a restaking product. We have no idea how that's going to pan out. And that could drive steth adoption way up, depending on what they do with their liquidity.
00:28:31.260 - 00:29:18.490, Speaker C: Vitalik outlined the design space for how to get to a smaller validator set so we can actually do single slot finality. Assume that we will get to single slot finality. We can't increase stake forever in Ethereum, and I am extremely skeptical that an issuance curve adjustment will cap it. Right, those discussions at ECC. So the three things he outlined from memory, and the first one was, we all go into DVT. The DVT guys got incredibly excited. I didn't think that was the real kind of path that they were looking at.
00:29:18.490 - 00:29:21.486, Speaker C: Do you remember what the second one was?
00:29:21.678 - 00:29:22.930, Speaker B: Two tiered staking.
00:29:23.510 - 00:30:07.436, Speaker C: Two tiered staking, yeah, I think that's right. So you have the big guys doing consensus and the little guys, the solo stakers, no longer involved in consensus. They can do side things, get a little bit of stake. That mix, I think, would have killed solo staking in its current form for sure. Now you're looking at run your machine and get a tiny bit of reward for something that has nothing to do with consensus. And if you want the real consensus API, just stick it in an LST. And the third one, the third option here that he was thinking about is this, some form of rotating validator set.
00:30:07.436 - 00:30:49.370, Speaker C: It wasn't orbit at the time. It was just, we rotate the validator set in some way and therefore cap its size at any given time so we can do single slot finality, which preserves solo staking in some meaningful way. I am not on board necessarily with two tiered staking. I'm feeling ambiguous about that. I see the argument, but I'm feeling ambiguous. I think saying DVT is now protocol enshrined is going too far. DVT has its place, but I think it should remain outside of the protocol.
00:30:49.370 - 00:30:53.034, Speaker C: So that leaves option three.
00:30:53.202 - 00:31:13.130, Speaker A: We'll definitely have to dive a little bit deeper into orbit SSF then. Because I agree with you, I feel like the three pathways forward that you just described, it does seem like orbit SSF, some kind of validator rotation to enable the same kind of responsibilities between small and large validators is the way to go next.
00:31:13.170 - 00:31:32.040, Speaker B: So I think my criticisms of it are all about, are all fixable by design. Like if I'm understanding correctly, if my criticisms are valid, then I think that those things can be addressed in adjusting math, adjusting percentages.
00:31:32.460 - 00:31:33.280, Speaker C: Okay.
00:31:34.020 - 00:31:59.260, Speaker A: And as a final question, you had mentioned, Yorick, that this is all very preliminary research, not something that's going into a hard fork anytime soon. But I guess like, final question for both of you. Is there like an EIP or something that's a little bit farther along that will help solo stakers? In the meantime, we could get to a point where solo stakers have already gone out of business and developers are ten years later, you know, retroactively trying to get them back.
00:32:00.200 - 00:32:17.670, Speaker B: I mean, there's now an EIP for correlation, anti correlation incentives. And I think that would honestly be a temporary boost to more decentralized forms of staking. But I think that it could be a pretty good one and a pretty good candidate for the next work.
00:32:18.930 - 00:33:06.094, Speaker C: Yeah, interesting one. I'm not sure how much that's going to do. I think at best what it does is force more node operators to work the way that we already have been, which is where, for example, for Lido, we're keeping 1000 keys per cluster of machines. Some of the people do like 40 00, 50 00, 60 00, just. And this is so what Nixo is talking about is if your stuff goes down, the more validators are down at the same time, the harsher the penalties. So what you do as an operator is you constrain your blast radius more. This is good for the network, but I don't know that it stops large operators.
00:33:06.094 - 00:33:09.230, Speaker C: It just makes them diversify their stuff more.
00:33:09.530 - 00:33:41.140, Speaker B: Two things we already know that it takes professional operators forever to do stuff especially the larger the operator, the longer it takes for them to implement anything. I do think there will be a temporary boost in decentralized forms or the APR of decentralized forms of staking relative to more professional operators, but also in the worst case scenario where professional operators get their shit together as soon as possible. We've only made the network more resilient, and it sounds like this is a win win, right?
00:33:41.260 - 00:33:43.844, Speaker C: Agreed. Absolutely. 100%.
00:33:44.012 - 00:34:20.095, Speaker A: No, that's fair. Well, thank you guys for raising this on the episode today on Orbit SSF. I'll definitely link to the paper in our show notes. So for people that are listening, please do dive in a little bit more, help us figure this out, and we'll definitely revisit, I guess, this ongoing topic of the path forward for single slot finality, which you gave a great overview view of, and the solar staker's role in that future. In the future of Ethereum. Yeah, feels quite precipitous, you know, like precarious. That's the word I was looking for, precarious.
00:34:20.287 - 00:34:38.170, Speaker C: Yeah, it does. For those who actually want to read the paper, I highly encourage you to just. If you don't speak math fluently, just skip over the math portions. You know, basically the paper says, we believe that this is true. And then there's a. A paragraph of math which tries to prove it. Just.
00:34:38.750 - 00:34:39.830, Speaker A: And shout out to.
00:34:39.910 - 00:34:41.694, Speaker C: Goes, you know, good enough.
00:34:41.862 - 00:34:49.570, Speaker A: And shout out to Mike Nooter, who please, maybe if you could also put up a secondary post explaining this.
00:34:51.950 - 00:34:55.970, Speaker B: Help us, Mike Neuter. You're our only hope for non mathematicians.
00:34:56.790 - 00:35:12.080, Speaker A: All right, well, thank you again, Nyxo and Yorick, and thank you everyone who is listening to this, this show. We hope that you learned something new about Ethereum. Until the next time in your explorations of the infinite jungle that is Ethereum, stay safe out there.
