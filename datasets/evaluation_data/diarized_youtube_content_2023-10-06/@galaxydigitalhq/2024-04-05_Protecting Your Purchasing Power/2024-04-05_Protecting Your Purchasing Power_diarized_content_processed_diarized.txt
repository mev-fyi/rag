00:00:07.320 - 00:00:11.694, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bim Netabeebeebi from Galaxy trading. As always, bim net. Welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:11.774 - 00:00:12.750, Speaker B: Thanks for having me on.
00:00:12.822 - 00:00:38.926, Speaker A: I love having you on. And it's been kind of an exciting, like, I mean, bitcoin's mostly like ranging still, but in Macro we had a lot of data this week. We had ISM and ADP, and it looked like there was even bitcoin was recovering a bit in the beginning of the week. But then on the back of some of the numbers, it, as well as stocks and other things, came down a decent amount, not like a ton. But what's happening?
00:00:38.990 - 00:01:44.894, Speaker B: Why? After quarter end, you had a pretty dramatic repricing of the rate complex in the front end with respect to how many cuts were priced in, and the back end with respect to how much term premium is priced in. What drove that was a series of hot numbers that you got earlier this week and things like isem manufacturing that showed strength and in other pieces of economic data. And so basically you started the quarter with a pretty insane move in backend treasuries. And part of it was a function of positioning quarter end flows that were geared toward, towards buying. And generally there's just a lot of noise around quarter end and stuff. And so you got a ton of hawkish fed speak, a bunch of hot data, and that caused the rate market to reprice and that in turn caused other markets to reprice. More specifically, us equities.
00:01:44.894 - 00:02:24.014, Speaker B: They had some of their biggest trading ranges they've had all year. Nasdaq yesterday at the lows was down one and a half percent. I don't remember the last 1% day in Nasdaq. That's how long it's been downside at least. And so I think what's happened today is you had a little bit of soft data, so you've had a retracement in some of those trades. Basically, ISM services prices paid came in soft today, and services is obviously 60 70% of the US economy. So when service prices go down, that's generally a constructive sign for prices.
00:02:24.014 - 00:03:06.834, Speaker B: However, I think the most notable thing in markets this week has been really the strength in the commodity complex. You can start with gold, that's trading at all time highs where every dip is continuing to get bought. And that's in the face of risk markets that were trading poorly, in the face of a dollar that's relatively well bid, and in the face of real rates, which have historically been the largest driver from a mathematical perspective, of gold that are elevated real rates elevated, moving higher, like gold should be moving down, but it's been the opposite. And other precious metals, like silver, are trading really well on the back of that.
00:03:07.254 - 00:03:09.726, Speaker A: So it's not just cocoa, which is mooning.
00:03:09.750 - 00:04:08.946, Speaker B: No, cocoa is mooning too. And then copper is trading really well. And that is a function of a lack of supply and more demand as a function of the stimulus efforts in China. And so you've had real world assets, pardon the actual pun, actual physical, actual physical things, trade really well. And when you see that happening in the context of a rate curve that is steepening and putting in higher term premium, it kind of makes you think about the terminal state of monetary policy and the terminal state of fiscal, because part of the reason why the back end is steepening so much, relatively, is because the government is still printing $2 trillion deficits. We're adding $100 billion, or, sorry, you're adding a trillion dollars every 100 days to the national deficit. And so there's a ton of bonds that have to get absorbed by the market.
00:04:08.946 - 00:05:15.652, Speaker B: In addition, with all this stimulus, et cetera, the fiscal impulse inflation is probably going to stay high. And that's what we've kind of seen, and especially with the commodity complex doing what it's doing. And so you need to be compensated for a higher rate of inflation in those back end markets in the future, then. In addition, there's a lot of commentary around what neutral rate is. What is the baseline for the Fed going forward? Is neutral 2.5%, or is it closer to three? Maybe even higher? The idea of long run interest rates being higher, on average, tons of supply in the back end, that needs to get absorbed by the market as well, is really pushing yields higher. And so when you see that in the context of gold, that is trading really well, I think the way I would interpret that is the market's really worried that at the end of all of this, it just means more fed printing, more inflation, a ton more debt and monetary debasement, really the fundamentals of why we like bitcoin presenting manifesting themselves in the real market.
00:05:15.708 - 00:05:25.184, Speaker A: So you think the realization is really starting to hit home now. It's not just the, it's not just us, it's not the gold bugs any longer. It's becoming widespread.
00:05:25.304 - 00:05:53.316, Speaker B: And I think part of that is a function of some more prominent folks in the financial community highlighting this. It's not just Stan drunken Miller giving the same speech from 2018 anymore. It's Ken Ray Dalio. It's Ray Dalio. It's Jamie Dimon and fundamentally. Not fundamentally, but technically. I think it's really hard for folks to ignore like really scalable assets that are performing this way.
00:05:53.316 - 00:06:11.372, Speaker B: When a macro guy, macro manager sees gold ripping and he can put billions of dollars into it, the question is why haven't you put billions of dollars into it? Is the move justified? And obviously it is because all macro folks see the debasement argument, et cetera.
00:06:11.468 - 00:06:16.184, Speaker A: It's sort of like if you don't do it, you're actively taking the counter view.
00:06:16.484 - 00:06:17.264, Speaker B: Correct.
00:06:17.834 - 00:06:21.386, Speaker A: Based on everything we're seeing, that'd be kind of crazy at this point to.
00:06:21.410 - 00:06:24.610, Speaker B: Take the counter view because the math doesn't add up. Yeah.
00:06:24.642 - 00:06:28.770, Speaker A: It's become conventional wisdom now that the math doesn't add up as your point. It's not a niche.
00:06:28.842 - 00:06:30.138, Speaker B: It's not niche. Yeah.
00:06:30.226 - 00:06:58.528, Speaker A: And if you look at the long term bonds versus gold, like historically trade similarly over long periods of time, they've traded both as hedges. Right. And since 2020 they've diverged dramatically. Gold continuing up. And crypt's just absolutely. Which is, I mean, I hit Max on the terminal on the chart and like it was the same in all of history basically, except for now. It's pretty glaring.
00:06:58.696 - 00:07:51.084, Speaker B: It's insane. And the more that everyday people wake up to it, and not just financial markets folks, the higher this stuff goes. And I've always been of the theory that the best way to hedge yourself and protect your purchasing power in the future is with real world assets and monetary basement hedges, homes, gold, bitcoin and tech stocks. But that's really the ultimate protect your purchasing power over the long run. And that's what we're here to do with bitcoin and crypto is really enhance that store of value. I think this is a story that you just have to let play out over time. And folks are just going to be looking at gold at 3000 at some point in the near or medium term.
00:07:51.084 - 00:07:55.384, Speaker B: And hopefully that means bitcoin will trade higher in conjunction.
00:07:55.464 - 00:08:01.724, Speaker A: It's like, do we think either of the presidential candidates are likely to change this in the next? No, right? Probably not.
00:08:04.064 - 00:08:12.608, Speaker B: So you're spot on. Neither of the presidents presidential candidates are really going to make any difference in the fiscal situation.
00:08:12.656 - 00:08:21.336, Speaker A: There's that great scene in arrested development when he's like, people always think that they can change, but they're always wrong. Except maybe we could change it. And it's like they're not gonna, right?
00:08:21.360 - 00:08:24.040, Speaker B: I mean, no, I mean, there was that Peter Fitzgerald piece today.
00:08:24.112 - 00:08:36.832, Speaker A: I said I saw it. It said the political a tough fix. The fiscal and monetary situation will be a tough fix politically was what the headline said. Yeah, well that's the understatement of a lifetime.
00:08:36.968 - 00:08:47.289, Speaker B: Exactly right. And the economy that we need to live in is the political economy as well. And so there is no appetite to cut Medicare, Social Security.
00:08:47.321 - 00:08:52.633, Speaker A: You have to cut no defense and raise taxes. There is no appetite neither side wants to do.
00:08:52.673 - 00:08:55.489, Speaker B: I mean, you don't get elected by telling people they're getting less money and.
00:08:55.521 - 00:09:00.017, Speaker A: Paying more, you're paying more and getting less services. Theoretically.
00:09:00.145 - 00:09:03.961, Speaker B: And just generally like, you know, I.
00:09:03.977 - 00:09:11.085, Speaker A: Think, can we grow our way out of it? Isn't that one of those towns? We're too deep in the hole, you think, for one of those arguments?
00:09:11.249 - 00:09:12.198, Speaker B: Point of no return.
00:09:12.286 - 00:09:19.326, Speaker A: You know, what about like an AI revolution that like productivity gains. Yes, but like massive ones. Right. But it would have to be massive at this point.
00:09:19.350 - 00:09:42.706, Speaker B: It would have to be insane. And traditionally the arguments around why the US can continue to spend this much is because, you know, they are the bellwether of innovation, right. California itself is like the fifth or 6th largest economy in the world. Right, right. And so, you know, historically we have been able to do that. And the folks respect the US government. So it has taxing power.
00:09:42.706 - 00:10:34.764, Speaker B: It's not like Greece where nobody pays taxes. People pay their taxes here. And so it's always been like the US has the ability to tax its way into a much healthier situation. But does that really exist in the political economy that we live in now? And once the issue is that world was in a world where interest rates were low and now the servicing of the debt has grown so huge that it's become really untenable and unsustainable. And so that's what's different now is you have this inflation problem. So you're paying 5% and change on t bills and that's 20% of the treasury supply. And so when you have to pay that interest in addition to the services that you need to pay for, the math just continually gets worse and worse.
00:10:34.764 - 00:11:05.350, Speaker B: And you don't have to trust me on the math. Just look at the CBO's projections of where the deficit's gonna be and their assumptions, et cetera. And it's really bad. You're talking about 200 plus trillion dollars of unfunded liabilities that the government currently has. We don't have the money. You can't print that much money without severe unintended consequences. And when you put that understanding into markets, it should mean that gold's higher, it should mean that silver's higher.
00:11:05.350 - 00:11:07.646, Speaker B: It should mean that bitcoin's at fresh all time highs.
00:11:07.710 - 00:11:22.582, Speaker A: Yep. Tricky situation, getting trickier. But I guess you got to protect your purchasing power some way or another. And that's why you see the commodity complex. That's why Tex, I mean, stocks are still basically at all time highs.
00:11:22.678 - 00:11:39.478, Speaker B: Oh, absolutely. And what you have to think about is just the price level of things. Right. Like if we're talking about COVID the price level was 100. Right. Since then, the price level is probably up 20% and change. And that's official measurements.
00:11:39.478 - 00:12:20.874, Speaker B: And other people are like, it's 30% or whatever. And so what the Fed's focused on is getting that price level to go from 120 to 122. Right. Versus what everyday Americans are focused on are, is the fact that their $1 item that they used to buy or $100 item they used to buy two years ago is worth, cost them 120 or 125. And their incomes haven't necessarily kept up to that huge, huge price level gain. And so there's a real mismatch of what the ivory tower fed officials are looking at versus what everyday Americans are feeling. Yep.
00:12:20.874 - 00:12:23.446, Speaker B: And I don't know how that's going to get resolved.
00:12:23.510 - 00:12:34.854, Speaker A: I don't either. It doesn't. We've talked about this before. Solving inflation almost guaranteed does not mean prices go down. It means the rate of growth in prices slows.
00:12:34.974 - 00:12:35.502, Speaker B: Correct.
00:12:35.598 - 00:12:39.934, Speaker A: The rate of growth. It's a lot different. It's a lot different people.
00:12:40.014 - 00:12:40.270, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:12:40.302 - 00:12:41.878, Speaker A: We're never going back. Probably. Right.
00:12:41.966 - 00:12:42.926, Speaker B: Never going back. Yeah.
00:12:42.950 - 00:12:46.206, Speaker A: Because that's deflation and deflation. The Fed tells us that's even worse.
00:12:46.310 - 00:13:00.754, Speaker B: And the idea that the Fed's talking about doing three cuts this year, I'm like, on what planet? Like, you're really doing that? The data is insanely hot. What are people? People are just going to buy mortgages and stuff, buy houses.
00:13:00.834 - 00:13:01.762, Speaker A: It's going to push inflation.
00:13:01.858 - 00:13:02.978, Speaker B: It's going to push inflation.
00:13:03.106 - 00:13:07.814, Speaker A: Any easing in those rates there is going to send people right to the market to buy. Right.
00:13:08.714 - 00:13:16.584, Speaker B: And so that's the issue you currently have and that's why it's hard to be bearish any of these things that are doing well right now.
00:13:16.744 - 00:13:20.928, Speaker A: Bibna Dabibi, my friend from Galaxy trading, as always, thanks for coming on. Galaxy brands.
00:13:21.016 - 00:13:21.984, Speaker B: Pleasure. Thanks for having me.
