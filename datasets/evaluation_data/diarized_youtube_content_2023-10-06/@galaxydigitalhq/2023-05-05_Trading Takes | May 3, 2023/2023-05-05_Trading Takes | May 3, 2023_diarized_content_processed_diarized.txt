00:00:06.840 - 00:00:10.814, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, how are you doing?
00:00:10.854 - 00:00:12.086, Speaker B: Well, thanks for having me.
00:00:12.150 - 00:00:14.806, Speaker A: Great to have you, as always. Big day today. Fed day.
00:00:14.870 - 00:00:15.374, Speaker B: Super bowl.
00:00:15.414 - 00:00:16.302, Speaker A: It's your Super bowl.
00:00:16.358 - 00:00:17.070, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:00:17.142 - 00:00:18.114, Speaker A: What happened?
00:00:18.454 - 00:00:57.472, Speaker B: So the Fed raised rates today by 25 basis points, taking the ban for the Fed funds rate from 475 to five to five and five and a quarter. That was pretty much expected. We had 22 basis points of 25 priced in. So this really came, as you know, it came as no surprise to anyone. In addition, we had the release of the FOMC statement, and we also had the press conference. I would say that the message from Powell and the statement was broadly neutral. It did not shock the market in any way.
00:00:57.472 - 00:01:49.884, Speaker B: And you can see that by the lack of sort of major moves in fixed income and in traditional markets. I think the most notable sort of parts of it were his comments surrounding the banks and the regional banks in particular. He had a statement in there that said that he thinks that the bank situation has actually eased from February to March recently, even though we've just had the first Republic. The one thing I'd like to note for our audience is that the Fed actually has the most advanced banking data available to it, and that is ahead of the market. They actually have the loan survey data already. In addition, what we've been told is that their staffers have been communicating with a bunch of bank executives over the past couple of weeks. So they are getting real time sort of assessment of the banking situation amongst regionals.
00:01:49.884 - 00:02:21.756, Speaker B: And so while I think that there's been a lot of sensationalism amongst the media and hype, I do agree with him that largely the bulk of the banking issues are from First Republic, Silicon Valley, Signature, et cetera, and that the rest of the banking system or the banking issues are going to be more drawn out as you sort of have the competition for deposits, et cetera, and they're not going to be like, a bank is going to get run in like a day. And so the more acute threats to.
00:02:21.780 - 00:02:25.924, Speaker A: Those regional banks, we think, have passed lingering issues.
00:02:26.084 - 00:02:41.732, Speaker B: But what he had to acknowledge simultaneously was that the data is still really robust. Right. Just today alone, we had ADP. It's a payroll survey. Add 300,000 jobs in the United States. That's not non farm payrolls. That's on Friday.
00:02:41.732 - 00:03:30.446, Speaker B: But ADP good enough is telling you that you're not only adding jobs, but you're adding jobs at a really robust rate, as if you hadn't hiked by 500 basis points already, which is wild. Then you look at the service sector of the economy, which is really important because the Fed's focused on services inflation ism services came out today surprised a little bit higher. Prices paid for services surprised. Higher. New orders for services surprised higher. You had the PMI for services come in expansionary territory once again, also have global pmis that are starting to shift higher. And so the data with respect to prices and service prices is telling you that you could probably still continue to hike and the unemployment market.
00:03:30.446 - 00:04:23.034, Speaker B: He said so in the speech today. Unemployment is at a 50 year low, 50 year low. And so, yes, we do have these banking issues and we've had three large banks fail under his watch. And any reasonable person can get to the conclusion that there wasn't sufficient supervision and that hiking rates too quickly and too high was probably a mistake or not doing it sooner or making it more gradual, et cetera. There were mistakes made, but it does not change the data backdrop. And I think the moment you get through this banking crisis stuff, people will settle and realize, what are we in? We're in a world where the US economy is still adding hundreds of thousands of jobs per month. And without that labor unemployment starting to tick up, it's going to be very tough for inflation to come down.
00:04:23.034 - 00:04:57.138, Speaker B: And I think certain folks draw comfort from the idea that inflation break evens in twos, fives and tens. They're basically at 2% right now. What I'd like to remind people, and what I constantly say is that every single smart person is basically awful at predicting inflation. They have been for decades. They're every central banker, every trader, et cetera. For the most part, like, I don't know anyone that has been consistently right on inflation. And so when you see the market telling you you're going to get to 2% inflation, I'll be like, no, no way.
00:04:57.186 - 00:05:00.746, Speaker A: Like, that could be completely wrong. That could be completely wrong.
00:05:00.850 - 00:05:34.154, Speaker B: And it's just a function of like, just habits and like, things that have changed over time. Like you're telling me that, you know, when you start going to the doctor and you're paying $100 a month and they're raising it $10 every year, they're going to stop raising it at some point, like that momentum has already started, right? And I think, again, it goes back to like the difference between western folks and Em folks, right? Em folks have seen the fight against inflation. It just doesn't go away. It becomes entrenched. Especially when you're talking about a labor.
00:05:34.194 - 00:05:52.556, Speaker A: Market that's at a 50 year old good jobs. So, I mean, even today. So again, it's Wednesday, what, May 3. Correct. Which is why I was fed day. And no, I mean, even today, I'm watching people buying it cost $16 here, where we work, not in our building, but, like, at the place nearby, for three slices of pizza.
00:05:52.660 - 00:05:53.236, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:05:53.300 - 00:05:58.852, Speaker A: $16. It's more than $5 per slice of pizza. And the line was out the door.
00:05:58.988 - 00:05:59.588, Speaker B: Out the door.
00:05:59.636 - 00:06:12.312, Speaker A: People are willing to pay that. And so, like, it's, now this is, you know, lower Manhattan. It's a business area. Right. There's plenty of cheaper pizza in New York than that. But I mean, like, that line is. No one's being like, oh, my God, I can't eat this today.
00:06:12.368 - 00:06:15.920, Speaker B: I'm gonna go to the airport. I mean, restaurants, et cetera.
00:06:15.952 - 00:06:16.960, Speaker A: They're all pretty expensive.
00:06:17.072 - 00:06:17.936, Speaker B: Everything's expensive.
00:06:18.000 - 00:06:31.160, Speaker A: And here's like, if we want inflation to come down, everyone needs to collectively throw their hands up and say, this is too expensive. But more of them are employed than ever. Right. Like, there's, people don't feel they have to collectively.
00:06:31.352 - 00:06:52.370, Speaker B: Well, here's the thing. Unemployment's low, but there's also huge social safety net programs. Right? The student loan payments that were paused, the foreclosures that were paused as well. And then you just have this excess savings build from the stimulus checks, the PPP loans, et cetera. Like, you're still talking about like, over a trillion dollars in excess savings in the.
00:06:52.402 - 00:06:59.922, Speaker A: I saw that. I saw that chart. Still, even still. Hold on. Let's talk about the debt of the United States of America.
00:06:59.978 - 00:07:00.962, Speaker B: Don't even get me started.
00:07:01.018 - 00:07:03.770, Speaker A: So we have a lot of it. What do we have? Over $31 trillion.
00:07:03.802 - 00:07:08.098, Speaker B: Of 32 plus trillion, I'd guess 33. I lift the over on 33.
00:07:08.226 - 00:07:09.266, Speaker A: It's a lot of debt.
00:07:09.330 - 00:07:10.050, Speaker B: Ongoing. Darn.
00:07:10.082 - 00:07:11.814, Speaker A: That's a lot of debt. You got a credit card?
00:07:12.224 - 00:07:15.112, Speaker B: Just try counting to a billion. But we're counting to a trillion.
00:07:15.168 - 00:07:35.484, Speaker A: We've basically hit our credit limit. Amex is saying, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Yeah, but we have this ace in our sleeve. We can actually, it turns out we're on the board of the credit card company and we can say, you know what? Raise our limit. And that's what we've been doing now for decades. Yes. And we have to do it now because we have exceeded the limit or hit the limit.
00:07:35.484 - 00:07:52.996, Speaker A: We've talked about this. The treasury is currently using extraordinary measures to fund the government. These are payments that we've already committed to. So it's not new spending and we had thought that for a while. It had been said that we could last to July, maybe even to August.
00:07:53.100 - 00:07:53.596, Speaker B: Correct.
00:07:53.700 - 00:08:08.944, Speaker A: Before a limit, the debt ceiling limit had to be raised. Now there's negotiations. The House managed to pass something. Speaker McCarthy rallied. It has other stuff, I think the Democrats were calling it. Oh, gosh. A right wing ransom note, I think is what one of the Senate democratic leaders said.
00:08:08.944 - 00:08:20.952, Speaker A: They're jostling now the secretary of the treasury, who is all, you know, Janet Yellen, who is the administration's chief economic spokesperson. She has now said it may hit the debt ceiling by June 1. That's less than a month away.
00:08:21.048 - 00:08:21.584, Speaker B: Correct.
00:08:21.704 - 00:08:26.504, Speaker A: There's some posturing there. But what are we, like, how important? It's very important that this gets.
00:08:26.544 - 00:08:35.168, Speaker B: Insanely important that the US government does not default on its debt. It is. The backbone of global finance is the US debt market.
00:08:35.256 - 00:08:35.624, Speaker A: Right.
00:08:35.704 - 00:08:43.808, Speaker B: So it'd be a pretty big deal. Most people have no idea what the actual implications are in terms of, like, how wild things could possibly get.
00:08:43.896 - 00:08:46.416, Speaker A: You mean the average person or smart people. Or smart people.
00:08:46.480 - 00:08:46.800, Speaker B: Everyone.
00:08:46.872 - 00:08:50.976, Speaker A: Yeah. No one knows. It could be economic apocalypse or it.
00:08:51.000 - 00:08:55.320, Speaker B: Could be like people have rushed to buy the bonds. Cause it's a flight to quality. Like, I don't know.
00:08:55.352 - 00:08:56.848, Speaker A: Cause we bought off.
00:08:56.896 - 00:08:57.744, Speaker B: Does it go bid?
00:08:57.824 - 00:08:58.216, Speaker A: No one knows.
00:08:58.240 - 00:08:59.944, Speaker B: Right. Like, who knows?
00:09:00.024 - 00:09:01.824, Speaker A: Volatility is the only thing we can be certain of.
00:09:01.864 - 00:09:02.472, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:09:02.528 - 00:09:03.124, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:03.494 - 00:09:29.950, Speaker B: Which will bring me to a different point later on. But I think what you have is a setup that is really constructive for Republicans. I think. I think if you're an incumbent president that is running for reelection, you've got a lot more to lose than the congressional Republicans and Senate Republicans, et cetera. Because in the election, who ultimately is going to get the blame for not.
00:09:29.982 - 00:09:31.238, Speaker A: Raising the debt that goes wrong, if.
00:09:31.246 - 00:09:42.102, Speaker B: They'Re going wrong, the president, and you blame the president. And I think he's got a lot more to lose. And so I do genuinely think that Republicans will come out with something tangible.
00:09:42.158 - 00:09:44.262, Speaker A: Some kind of like a moratorium cap.
00:09:44.318 - 00:10:01.230, Speaker B: On future spending, et cetera, whatever it may be. And the other thing I know that I think for sure is that it will go down to the wire. Right. You will get more bang for your buck in terms of negotiating. When it's imagining, it's like you're doing that two car thing.
00:10:01.382 - 00:10:02.078, Speaker A: Game of chicken.
00:10:02.126 - 00:10:10.918, Speaker B: Game of chicken. And it's going to be the first person who flinches will lose. Ultimately, I think it's gonna come down to the wire just cause I think that's how the game theory works.
00:10:10.966 - 00:10:11.554, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:13.134 - 00:10:34.486, Speaker B: And I do think that Republicans will kind of win. But on the off chance that the US government does default, this is literally one of my favorite reasons to own bitcoin ever is the US government potentially defaulting because of a government that does not work. Again, friendly reminder, this is the same congress that took 16 attempts to elect McCarthy for House.
00:10:34.510 - 00:10:35.914, Speaker A: For a speaker. For a speaker.
00:10:36.094 - 00:10:50.050, Speaker B: And so this is a divided Congress and let alone within their own parties, but amongst each other as well. And the idea that the most important institution government in the world is about.
00:10:50.082 - 00:10:53.386, Speaker A: The default and mostly over political bickering too.
00:10:53.490 - 00:10:54.058, Speaker B: Political bickering.
00:10:54.106 - 00:10:57.138, Speaker A: They're not making a determination that we shouldn't raise the debt limit.
00:10:57.186 - 00:11:54.004, Speaker B: They just are fighting about it. People will fundamentally start doubting the idea of money and us treasuries and what that means. And I think that's going to be so incredibly constructive for bitcoin. I think the number one trade to have as a hedge, as a hedge for government default is owning bitcoin calls. I think bitcoin could trade north of this year's highs, probably closer to 40k on the chance of a genuine government default. Given how cheap those wings are, especially short dated stuff, I think owning bitcoin wingy upside is probably one of the best diversification government default hedges you can possibly have in a portfolio. And I think it's almost like if you were managing hundreds of billions in a cross asset portfolio, you're a big insurance company, you're a big real money account, and you're in crazy amount of treasuries.
00:11:54.004 - 00:12:23.666, Speaker B: The CDs market for us barely exists. You got to trade with a non us bank and it's weird. You might not get your payoffs. The best hedge for that. And I think the best convexity in the market is bitcoin wings. And there are some other products as well, Vix and other sort of structures that could do well. But from my standpoint, I would feel like I was going against my duty to my firm, fiduciaries, etcetera.
00:12:23.690 - 00:12:34.974, Speaker A: You got to bring this up is what you're saying. This is a real. I mean, it makes sense, right? It's a non government issued FX. That's how I think about it. You know, a lot of people, including our boss, think about it as digital gold. Absolutely. Which plays the same kind of role.
00:12:34.974 - 00:12:48.064, Speaker A: Presumably gold will very well in that scenario. Let's hope it doesn't happen. You know, Mike Novogratz always says that he goes to bed every night praying for sound financial stewardship of the economy. Absolutely. But this question. Of course. And this.
00:12:48.064 - 00:13:06.716, Speaker A: But this question, it's. I mean, we don't want, you know, political operatives playing chicken with the US debt, right? So, I don't know. We're gonna have to wait and see. We will follow up on that debt as we get closer. We've got about a month, it seems, to watch this play out either way. But that's all for now. Bimnet Abibi from galaxy trading.
00:13:06.716 - 00:13:08.052, Speaker A: As always, my friend. Great to see you.
00:13:08.148 - 00:13:09.204, Speaker B: Pleasure. Thanks for having me.
