00:00:00.360 - 00:00:53.755, Speaker A: One of the things that I want to highlight before really getting into what was said during the call and sharing my insights on it is throughout the call, it was pretty clear the decision to split the upgrade was already made. And on the call it wasn't really up for debate whether or not Petris should be split. There was conversation that developers were having throughout the week since last week's All Core Developer call, developers that were sharing that this kind of split was bound to happen eventually, that the upgrade was just far too big for developers to really feasibly put into one upgrade. So I want to make clear that when we're talking about this discussion and when I'm setting up the context for this call, splitting the upgrade was technically not up for debate. It was really more about the content of these two upgrades.
