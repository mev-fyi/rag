00:00:06.720 - 00:00:11.126, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, my friend, great to have you on the show.
00:00:11.190 - 00:00:12.870, Speaker B: Thanks for having me. How we doing?
00:00:12.942 - 00:00:25.526, Speaker A: We're good, man. And it's been a little bit of an interesting time, mostly because of the regulatory stuff that's been coming down in these news events for traders. But before we get to that, let's talk about data this week.
00:00:25.710 - 00:00:26.318, Speaker B: Oh, my God.
00:00:26.366 - 00:00:27.918, Speaker A: Economic data that we've seen. What do we have?
00:00:27.966 - 00:00:33.398, Speaker B: It was spectacular. So we started this week on Tuesday with inflation data.
00:00:33.486 - 00:00:34.214, Speaker A: CPI.
00:00:34.334 - 00:00:43.638, Speaker B: Yes, CPI. It came in at 0.5% month on month for headline CPI, which is a super robust reading.
00:00:43.686 - 00:00:46.790, Speaker A: So that's 0.5% increase month on month.
00:00:46.862 - 00:01:02.812, Speaker B: Yeah. So if you multiply that by 20 January over December. Correct. Wow. So that's really robust. And a lot of it, or a good amount of it was driven by housing or owner's equivalent rent, which printed a 0.8 month on month.
00:01:02.868 - 00:01:03.556, Speaker A: Still going up.
00:01:03.620 - 00:01:24.474, Speaker B: Still going up. But we know that is sort of a lagged indicator. And in theory, given some of the higher frequency data points we look at, we do expect that to come down over time. But nonetheless, with the US an incredibly restrictive monetary policy, we're still having inflation that's very robust.
00:01:24.554 - 00:01:24.914, Speaker A: Wow.
00:01:24.994 - 00:02:01.256, Speaker B: Right. You did have pockets of weaknesses in some medical services like airline fares and things of that nature. So I think the narrative of inflation still big picture, come on the way down. That narrative is still in place in the market. However, you did see a meaningful repricing of the interest rate curve after the CPI number. So right now you have terminal rates pricing in about 525 basis points. And you priced out a lot of the cuts that were baked into the market for the back half of this year.
00:02:01.256 - 00:02:39.864, Speaker B: And early next year, you've had, basically you went from pricing in at the dead lows, about 170 basis points of cuts around there, to like 110 now. So like 60, 70 basis points of cuts that got priced out of the market as a function of how strong this inflation data was. In addition to that, you had retail sales this morning. Surprise, higher. We had a 3% growth month on month in retail sales and it was a very strong report. And that just added further momentum behind the sell off you've had in fixed income. And now you're looking at bond yields that are sitting super close to the highs.
00:02:39.864 - 00:03:25.504, Speaker B: Dollar has rallied a lot as well. Things like dollar yen through 134 euro dollar looks like it's going a lot lower, breaking like 107 potentially. So you've had us yields move higher, that's caused a rally in the dollar as well as the rate differential starts to go in favor of the US. And I think these are things that trends that can potentially continue. But it does seem like you've moved a lot very quickly just to think about it. You had the insane 500,000 jobs print like two Fridays ago, right? We know that employment's really strong, and now we know that inflation's really strong. And now we know the consumer is spending a lot as well.
00:03:25.504 - 00:04:04.094, Speaker B: And the Fed speak's been hawkish. So there's a lot of hawkish stuff priced into the fixed income world and the FX world. And it's really interesting to think about in the context of equity markets and crypto markets. Because if you asked me six months ago if we had a, a huge sell off and fixed income and a huge rally in the dollar, I'd tell you stocks are probably down five to 10%. But really, stocks are barely off the highs. The S and P as of this recording is, I would guess 41.40. And the high has been like 4190 or 4200 in this period here.
00:04:04.094 - 00:04:35.628, Speaker B: So you're still sitting at the dead highs in stocks. The earnings weren't that bad. The January consumption figures that you've seen in the high frequency stuff tells you that us consumers totally fine. And so it looks like you're in a period where inflation's kind of cooling a little bit. The labor market's just fine. Basically, the way to think about it is you went from soft landing in the market to no landing. It's just everything's fine.
00:04:35.628 - 00:04:59.032, Speaker B: And so I'm still constructive on risk assets. And if you look at crypto, you basically had a ton of regulations, headlines and speculation thrown at it. And bitcoin went from a high of 24,000 to 21,000. Sorry, 21, 521 thousand, 510%.
00:04:59.088 - 00:04:59.376, Speaker A: Correction.
00:04:59.400 - 00:05:00.168, Speaker B: From the high.
00:05:00.336 - 00:05:04.504, Speaker A: You can see the block clock over my shoulder. We're practically at 23,000. Again, very resilient.
00:05:04.584 - 00:05:11.432, Speaker B: It's as if one of the most powerful regulators didn't just come down on crypto. You couldn't even tell by the price.
00:05:11.488 - 00:05:13.808, Speaker A: Action, including, including the alts.
00:05:13.856 - 00:05:15.696, Speaker B: I mean, they've just, it's crazy gone on.
00:05:15.720 - 00:05:24.960, Speaker A: Well, so, but, okay, let's take a step back here for a second, because when I hear, what I hear is that inflation, it's maybe meekly cooling. It's barely cooling.
00:05:24.992 - 00:05:25.648, Speaker B: It's cooling.
00:05:25.736 - 00:05:30.168, Speaker A: Yeah, but like, it's still strong. They're not winning the fight against inflation right now.
00:05:30.216 - 00:05:30.656, Speaker B: They're not.
00:05:30.720 - 00:05:41.446, Speaker A: They're they're not losing it, but they're sort of in a stalemate with it. And that's the whole thing. The dual, the dual mandate from the fed is to maintain employment and keep inflation down.
00:05:41.550 - 00:05:42.302, Speaker B: Keep price stability.
00:05:42.358 - 00:05:43.286, Speaker A: Keep price stability. Okay.
00:05:43.310 - 00:05:43.494, Speaker B: Yes.
00:05:43.534 - 00:05:45.486, Speaker A: Which inflation is not. Stability of prices.
00:05:45.550 - 00:05:46.350, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, but. Yes.
00:05:46.382 - 00:06:05.382, Speaker A: Okay. Appreciate that. And so they're not currently keeping price stability, really. But employment looks good. But the whole thing was, a lot of people thought to get inflation down, you have to damage the employment market and that isn't happening. Yeah, but inflation's not really cool. It doesn't appear to be accelerating.
00:06:05.518 - 00:06:05.830, Speaker B: Correct.
00:06:05.862 - 00:06:08.294, Speaker A: But it's not really declining much.
00:06:08.714 - 00:06:11.974, Speaker B: Yes. I think those are sort of like all fair problems.
00:06:13.034 - 00:06:14.490, Speaker A: They haven't solved it.
00:06:14.562 - 00:06:47.440, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, here's what it looks like right now. Basically, it looks like the US economy can handle significantly high interest rates just fine. People used to think that if you took interest rates to like 5% plus, that means recession, like slowdown in growth, consumptions and all of these things. But realistically, like, we've been talking about this all year because of the structural setup in the US, the economy's a lot more resilient than it's ever been.
00:06:47.472 - 00:06:49.880, Speaker A: So we're talking about what technological innovation?
00:06:50.032 - 00:06:55.288, Speaker B: Well, just talk about mortgages, for example. Right? Everybody took them, fixed mortgages, 3%.
00:06:55.416 - 00:06:57.608, Speaker A: So they can handle the higher rates. Cause they're not even paying them.
00:06:57.656 - 00:07:17.648, Speaker B: They're not even paying them. Correct. Right. Relative to the rest of the developed world, the US has much higher percentage of fixed rate, fixed rate mortgages relative to floating rate. So that's a huge structural thing you have going. Two, what did we just go through because of COVID we literally de globalized. We took our manufacturing from offshore and brought it onshore.
00:07:17.648 - 00:07:22.760, Speaker B: What did that do? That brought a ton of new jobs over into the US economy.
00:07:22.832 - 00:07:29.240, Speaker A: Makes sense why you have some inflation. You gotta pay more for those domestically produced goods. And we didn't bring everything over. But a lot of it.
00:07:29.272 - 00:07:31.176, Speaker B: A lot of it. A lot did. A lot of it happened, right.
00:07:31.200 - 00:07:31.456, Speaker A: A lot of people.
00:07:31.480 - 00:08:01.832, Speaker B: And you already had a structurally tight labor market and so you added more jobs to a tight labor market. And asset prices have come off, but they haven't come off that much. You also had a huge savings base that was built up from stimulus check after stimulus check, PPP loan after PPP loan, and forgiveness, student loan forgiveness. The world just threw money at people for years. That just doesn't go away. Cause you took interest rates up to 5% and have held them for so.
00:08:01.848 - 00:08:07.284, Speaker A: The bottom line though, we can sustain higher rates, but can we sustain this higher inflation, you think? Because I see some of the data.
00:08:07.704 - 00:08:11.376, Speaker B: Credit, credit card debt, yes, it's back to trend.
00:08:11.440 - 00:08:14.728, Speaker A: Yeah, okay, back. But it's very high. The trend is.
00:08:14.896 - 00:08:18.336, Speaker B: But just because credit cards are high doesn't mean that they can't go higher.
00:08:18.400 - 00:08:27.438, Speaker A: Is the consumer as safe and strong as data suggests? Because aren't there a lot of people in debt and stuff like that? There are people at some point you think?
00:08:27.536 - 00:09:01.480, Speaker B: At some point, sure, but not now. It will break when people start losing jobs. As long as people still have jobs, the credit cycle can cause they keep making money. They keep making money or just keep down paying down some of it. But what you're really supposed to pay attention to from a high frequency data point or just a health of the credit market standpoint is these credit card companies have to hold reserves versus potential losses. Right. And you can look at like default rates on these credit card loans, right.
00:09:01.480 - 00:09:13.072, Speaker B: Or like how many credit cards have been delinquent. So one of the things that people look for, you know, at the start of like a downturn is for these default rates to start going up and they really have it.
00:09:13.128 - 00:09:15.232, Speaker A: I see. So the total balances are high, but.
00:09:15.328 - 00:09:18.192, Speaker B: People, the delinquency rates are super low.
00:09:18.288 - 00:09:19.248, Speaker A: Wow, interesting.
00:09:19.376 - 00:09:33.672, Speaker B: So yeah, the US economy is just fine. The US consumer is just fine. And there's a lot of people that are positioned for shit not to be fined. And so there's plenty of folks that are way too defensively positioned.
00:09:33.768 - 00:09:47.360, Speaker A: Assuming that we don't hit this mythic recession that all of the doomers on Twitter and the perennial macro doomers have been calling for. Right. And right now, from your standpoint, it doesn't look like that's imminent.
00:09:47.512 - 00:10:07.722, Speaker B: Correct. And then I just think about like, for asset prices to go down, you need people to sell them. Right. Like fundamentally, how does stuff go down in value? It goes down in value because people sell it in stocks. What's happening? You have corporate buybacks. Us corporates are still on the bid. These big tuck companies still have huge share repurchases.
00:10:07.722 - 00:10:31.624, Speaker B: The energy companies are doing really great. They're not giving out dividends, they're buying back their shares. Then you have the US retail community. US retail. If everyone has a job and you're at historically low unemployment, they got money to spend. They got money to spend. And point being, I don't think us retail is really selling stocks and everyone I know is still contributing to their 401 ks, etcetera.
00:10:31.624 - 00:11:21.944, Speaker B: There's just still tons of buy pressure on stocks. And then all the shorts in the hedge fund world, in the tactical world, they got wiped out after, in January, and everybody got squeezed. And that's why you saw all the garbage names in the S and P rip higher the shorter. There's not enough incentive to short because these short squeezes can be pretty dramatic. Sorry, I'm a little under the weather. The question is then, who's there to sell stocks? And there isn't crazy IPO supply coming down the pipeline either. So you're left in the market that has marginal buy pressure from corporates that are on the bid for share repurchases, et cetera, constant 401K buying, although that's not really that much.
00:11:21.944 - 00:11:52.414, Speaker B: And retail's not really a seller of stocks either. They're probably relatively underweight as well. So I just see risk drifting higher. And in my head, there's no reason why the S and P can't trade at a 21 multiple instead of a 19 multiple. What does that mean at dollar 225 a vps? It means the S and P could be at 4500 before you fucking know it. Yeah, I think there's that risk. I also, just, given the slew of earnings we just had, stuff's fine.
00:11:52.414 - 00:12:25.450, Speaker B: So if you were to go down, where are you going down to? Just doesn't seem that attractive in my head. The only way we get a material sell off in equities is if you just have a huge rotation from equities into bonds, which can happen if bond yields go a lot higher. It's possible. And if they stay high for an insanely long period of time, those risks grow as well. So I think right here, right now, I think it's co pathetic.
00:12:25.482 - 00:12:26.178, Speaker A: It's constructed.
00:12:26.226 - 00:12:26.994, Speaker B: Things are fine.
00:12:27.074 - 00:12:28.818, Speaker A: Things are fine, and America looks strong.
00:12:28.906 - 00:12:33.074, Speaker B: Looks strong. And crypto doesn't seem to care about.
00:12:33.234 - 00:12:41.854, Speaker A: Regulatory attacks that have been happening. Right. We'll get into those with our guests today. Great conversation as always, my friend. Vinnet abhivee from galaxy trading. Thanks so much. Pleasure.
