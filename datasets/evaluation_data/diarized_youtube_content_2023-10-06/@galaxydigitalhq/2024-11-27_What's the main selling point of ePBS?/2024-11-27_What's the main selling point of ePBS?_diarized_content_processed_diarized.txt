00:00:00.320 - 00:00:10.104, Speaker A: Is EPBS really all that necessary in comparison to all these other kind of improvements that we expect are going to be coming anyways? For nodes.
00:00:10.232 - 00:00:45.200, Speaker B: Definitely we're talking about orders of magnitude. It's not like a palliative solution like reducing the number of aggregations, which is true. That definitely helps us, and that actually helps us in the hot path, which is a attestations is on the hot path. What EPBS gives us is orders of magnitude more time to propagate the data and to propagate the actual transactions, instead of just the tiny bit which is the consensus block. So I think we're talking about completely different orders of magnitude in the timing that you get on bandwidth from EPBs versus all the other solutions.
