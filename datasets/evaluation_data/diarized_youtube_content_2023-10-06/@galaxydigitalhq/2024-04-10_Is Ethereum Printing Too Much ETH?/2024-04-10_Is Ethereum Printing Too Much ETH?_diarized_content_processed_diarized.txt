00:00:10.040 - 00:00:34.914, Speaker A: Welcome back to the infinite Jungle. We are back with another episode. And on this episode I have with me Nixo, executive director of East Staker. By now, I hope everyone is very familiar with Nixxo. My dear, dear friend and someone I love having on the show. I love having her on all the time. How's it going, Nixiev?
00:00:35.334 - 00:00:38.434, Speaker B: It's going great. I just moved into a brand new apartment this morning.
00:00:39.134 - 00:00:44.990, Speaker A: Wow, it looks great. It looks like you have all the infinite jungle swag. All the plants.
00:00:45.142 - 00:00:47.154, Speaker B: I tried to move all the plants to the background.
00:00:47.614 - 00:00:53.034, Speaker A: Yeah. For the very bright. I like it. Yeah. Is it all natural light?
00:00:54.294 - 00:01:06.132, Speaker B: Yeah, it's all natural light. I'm sitting right in front of the window and I've got a beautiful but french looking building view. And it's just the sun is shining right in. It's great.
00:01:06.308 - 00:01:15.564, Speaker A: I love that. Also, I love the colors. It's like geometrically, like, you've got the turquoise, the yellow, the gray. It's unique. Isn't it great?
00:01:15.724 - 00:01:29.834, Speaker B: Yeah, I love it. I'll be here for at least five months, which is awesome because I'm not. I'm like slow matting right now, so I'm not used to being in the same bed for a very long time. So I'm excited to be here for a while.
00:01:30.334 - 00:01:44.254, Speaker A: Five months. Five months sounds like the shortest time ever. If I'm doing the halfway moving, I'm gonna stay there for literally ten years. But I understand that the nomad life is very different. It's just like, that's a lot.
00:01:44.374 - 00:01:51.274, Speaker B: Moving is. I don't think I've been in the same place for more than 30 days in like, two and a half years.
00:01:52.014 - 00:02:41.266, Speaker A: Oh, dang, it's tiring. Honestly, that sounds exhausting. I'm glad you're staying in one place, young lady. Anyways. Okay, well, I suppose we should get started and talk about some updates to the ethereum staking ecosystem. I wanted to start off our conversation with probably one of the biggest things that people have been talking about over the last couple weeks on the twitterverse, on the crypto Twitter, and that's issuance changes to validator issuance. We've talked about this before, and my takeaway is that probably nothing's gonna happen for electra related to issuance, and it just seems overblown because it just doesn't seem that important to me in that I don't think it's gonna impact validators immediately.
00:02:41.266 - 00:03:13.994, Speaker A: So I can understand why we're talking about it now, but I'd love to hear your thoughts, too, on how you think the conversation has changed or, like, progressed over the last couple weeks? Sounds like more people are against it. Like more people have spoken up, I guess way more people have spoken up about how they don't want this to happen, about how they don't want staking rewards to go down. But I don't know. I mean, have you, have you thought that the tone of the conversation has changed? And maybe if you think it's more important than I do.
00:03:15.604 - 00:04:13.384, Speaker B: So here's my first of all, I'm going to say I'm strongly in support of something going into Elektra. Oh, I know that people, I think, in my position, who support it haven't been as loud as the people who are against it. And I think that's normal because crypto Twitter is sort of dominated by these loud voices that people trust, that people follow on Twitter because they're usually a very good sense of, of what's going on without having to delve too deep. And I think a lot of these voices are strongly against it for reasons that are their own, the reasons that are legitimate. But I really liked a take that I saw from a core dev, which was when I see an argument. And on one side, it's a bunch of people who have been doing research into this area for years and don't really have a financial incentive for it to go either way. And on the other side, I see people who are going to be affected.
00:04:13.384 - 00:05:22.100, Speaker B: It kind of goes to show that, like, what are the motivations for each person's argument? Because everybody who I've seen has been speaking out against it is either direct, directly financially affected. So this hits their bags in some way. In some way that is like a very legitimate reason, unpredictable. It could either lower their issuance if they're a staker, which for obvious reasons, people want to push against if they're staking, it could impact the way that other people, regulators, blackrock, like, people getting into staking Coinbase see staking, which impacts their bag in a very different way than if you're a staker. But, yeah, on the other side, you have these researchers doing a lot of who have been looking into this for years and are now saying that this is something we need to look at urgently, something that is important. And I think their timing is actually pretty good. So in January, Anders, who is a researcher, put out a post on targeting.
00:05:22.100 - 00:06:07.900, Speaker B: And the thing is, there are a couple of EF researchers who, when they post something, I feel like I have to set aside like three or four days to really read what they're saying. And even then, I might not get a solid grasp on it. And it's because some of these people have been diving in for so long that, like, their, their posts get highly technical really quickly and it pushes a lot of people out. So when Anders posted this targeting post in January, it honestly did not get that much traction. It was exactly the topic that we're talking about now. Like about what? Whether or not we should lower issuance or target some number. But it was just so technical that it didn't get a lot of community engagement at all.
00:06:07.900 - 00:06:46.502, Speaker B: And then Kaspar and Ansgar came in with a super accessible post and it got a lot more traction. It got a lot more community engagement. And then the absolute king of communication and EF research, Mike Neuter, came in and published his own thing, which was extremely accessible. And then all of a sudden, people were able to read this thing. And one of the problems with that is that they read Mike Neuter's post and then don't read any of the things that he has linked or any of the data or research. So, like, one of the things that I've seen are people saying, like, there's not enough data behind this. There's not enough research behind this.
00:06:46.502 - 00:07:21.798, Speaker B: And I'm like, well, you haven't, you haven't actually, like, if you look at Anders posts, especially the one he posted, uh, four days ago, um, there is a lot of data in there. There's a lot of data. There's a lot of research. There are charts, there are graphs, there are numbers, there are math equations. Um, but, uh, a lot of what I'm seeing is, is a little bit of a knee jerk reaction to something that's like, yes, it's scary. You're going to change the monetary policy of Ethereum, you better have a damn good reason to do that because this is going to affect everything that we've been fighting for. It's going to affect the narrative.
00:07:21.798 - 00:07:46.798, Speaker B: It's going to affect everything that, like, people trust about Ethereum, and you better have a damn good reason. And right now, what they're being told on crypto Twitter is that, like, there's no reason, there's no reason for, for anybody to do this. This, there's no math behind this, there's no data behind this. And that's, I don't, I don't think that, I don't think that's true. That's not true. Whether or not it's sufficient, sufficient data.
00:07:46.846 - 00:08:34.680, Speaker A: And research is arguable, but that's what I thought. I thought there wasn't data in research for this and that, like if we want something to go into Electra, there has to be a concrete threshold. There has to be like a number that developers are targeting. And in Ansgar and Casper's post, I think that they had said, you know, at current level stake, why don't we reduce it by 30%? Like a really easy change doesn't require a ton of complexity, but let's just reduce it by 30% and see what happens. That is just awful to me. Like you have no idea how clearly people are saying it's going to impact people. And who knows if it's going to actually help the solo staker.
00:08:34.680 - 00:09:01.544, Speaker A: And we don't even know, we know for sure that 30% is not the end game. So we know that there's going to have to be another change to issuance that is a little bit more dynamic perhaps. But like if we want a change to go into Elektra, there has to be a specific number. And so far the number that I've been given and the rationale behind it is kind of weak. So like what is the number and what exactly are people trying to push into electra? And like why? Like where is the data behind that one?
00:09:01.924 - 00:09:27.552, Speaker B: So that is where this becomes arguable. So there, Kaspar and Ansgar posted two different things. One was a better explainer of Anders targeting research. One was a proposal for Electra. The electra one just reduced issuance and that's all it does. It's actually really, really mild in, in the context of targeting. It's very mild.
00:09:27.552 - 00:10:15.314, Speaker B: All it does is reduce issuance as we get further along the stake supply timeline and there, so that the number that they're targeting, 25% or whatever that is where it's sort of like, I don't know. We need to buy some time. So I don't know what this number should be, but I know it should be lower. But it doesn't actually target, so the elector proposal doesn't actually target anything. Their proposal in the first or their explainer of targeting sort of through 25% out there. But the reduction is also just, yeah, you're right. It's throwing a dart out there and saying like we think we should reduce it.
00:10:15.314 - 00:11:17.044, Speaker B: We know that we need to do something about the fact that we are on track to get to 100% staked and there is no reason that that should change. And that's also something, it's difficult to get data on the future. And so people are arguing like, well, how do you know it's going to get to 100% staked? I think Eric on Twitter randomly threw out a number that said, I think we're going to level out at 31%. And I don't know where that 31% came from, because what we've shown is that the number, the amount staked has just been up only since the launch of the beacon chain. The lowest economic security that we've ever had in proof of stake was at the merge. And that was only because that's when the beacon chain started being our consensus mechanism. And so since then, it has just been up and up and up, and the slope of that line hasn't significantly changed.
00:11:17.044 - 00:11:44.424, Speaker B: It's not like as time has gone on, there's been less and less demand. We have seen events where it is higher. Like when Chappella happened, and there was just less. There was less risk to staking. There was a little bit more of an incline in that slope, but there were also withdrawals. And so there's no reason to think that the staking supply that's being staked or the e supply that's being staked levels off anytime soon.
00:11:44.924 - 00:12:22.452, Speaker A: Yeah, I 100% agree with that. I think logically it also makes sense, like, if you are not staking your ETH, you're essentially being diluted out of what you're holding. And it's so damn easy to stake, there's no reason why you shouldn't stake your ETH. I mean, the only thing that might have prevented people from staking their ETH is, oh, well, if I have to stake my ETH and I lock it up and I can't use it to go buy nfts or do all this stuff, but now you don't even have that issue because you can just liquid stake it, and then you get a liquid staking token, and then you can still play around with it, do whatever you want. So the barrier to entry is really low. So I agree. I think that staking will most likely continue to rise.
00:12:22.452 - 00:13:07.482, Speaker A: And I understand that developers are very worried that if that happens, then all of it goes to a liquid staking provider like Lido. But again, it seems like throwing out a random number for Elektra is a knee jerk reaction of like, oh, this is getting too much. Let's just see if this works. And it does. I don't think that that's the best way to go about it. And even the long term proposal that Casper and Anzgar had presented is primarily a proposal saying, we need to do more research on this. We need to figure out what the target staking ratio is, how we actually implement an issuance schedule that can achieve the target staking rate that we want.
00:13:07.482 - 00:13:27.990, Speaker A: If it is 25% of total lease, then how do we achieve that? And then we'll need some other proposals to change stake distribution. So I know Vitalik had put out a post saying why don't we increase the penalties for correlated slashing events? So if you're a large provider, not even correlated slashing.
00:13:28.142 - 00:13:31.634, Speaker B: So we already have correlated slashing. It's correlated offline penalties.
00:13:31.974 - 00:14:12.366, Speaker A: Oh, okay. So like you're offline at the same time. Yeah. You get penalized at a higher rate if you're a larger validator. Yeah, I think that would definitely very targeted policies that impact large stakers as opposed to smaller stakers. But I don't see the rational, I don't see how it should, I don't think it should be easy to change the issuance. And if there is an issuance change that goes into electra purely for the rationale of it just needs to be smaller, like lower in some amount that I think would look very poor, poorly on Ethereum as a decentralized blockchain.
00:14:12.366 - 00:14:16.314, Speaker A: Like first, I don't get it.
00:14:16.774 - 00:15:40.174, Speaker B: Why does decreasing the issuance seem like such a negative? So basically one of the things that I've heard is people saying like the SEC is going to look at us changing the staking issuance and be like, wow, these people are just like willy nilly changing things. And so like why would we approve some sort of blockchain that can change things so rapidly and on a whim? But the thing is like what the SEC is supposed to do is like meant to do, arguably, is supposed to protect investors. And what we're seeing right now is this sort of like system that's being built in Ethereum staking, where things are being, and excuse my use of this word, because people get really controversial. People treat it like it's really controversial, but people are leveraging risk on top of risk on top of risk. And you can argue whether or not it's technically leverage in the financial system, but like the fact is you are taking a staking yield and then on top of that staking yield, you're taking some sort of restaking yield. You've got MeV in there. And like the way that the traditional financial system has layered all of this risk on top of each other is what creates risk for investors, especially when these, when these companies, l two s protocols, whatever are marketing it as risk free, which some of them are.
00:15:40.174 - 00:16:11.504, Speaker B: You've got these investors who are going in blind, and they're like, and all they hear is, oh, well, I'm being, issuance is happening. Issuance is happening at an increasing rate. And so I've heard this narrative a lot more recently, which is, well, ETH is meant to be staked. You're supposed to stake ETH. That's what you're supposed to do with it. And that's not at all how ETH was intended. Like, when it was built, we're seeing all of these, we're seeing all of these second order effects come in and having to deal with them as they come in.
00:16:11.504 - 00:16:42.394, Speaker B: And so to say that, like, we're not, that ethereum should not react to things, to how the market is treating it because we're afraid that change will make us look capricious is, it's, it's just kind of hilarious to me because it's like saying, like, oh, we can't progress because we need to look like we were doing, we need to look like we knew what we were doing in the first place. And it's like, that is the antithesis of progress. That is the antithesis of making a technology better.
00:16:42.814 - 00:17:58.424, Speaker A: Well, no, I don't think that's really the crux of the argument, because it's not that, at least for me. It's not that we're against change or we really even care what the, okay, I'm not gonna say that we don't care about what the SEC thinks, but I have publicly written that a change in issuance is not going to materially impact the SEC's thoughts on whether or not Ethereum is a security because, agreed, Ethereum has literally changed issuance, what, like multiple times? The merge, EIP 1559 reducing block reports from five to three to two. I mean, trust me, just talking about changes to issuance is not going to raise any alarm bells more than what has actually happened on the Ethereum and Ethereum's track record. So I really, I mean, I don't think that's, I agree with you that it's not something that should really worry people or if you think about it really logically, makes sense. But I will say it's the fact that a change to issuance is not going to change how easy it is to stake. Changing your staking rewards from 5% to 4%, 4% to 3% probably isn't going to reduce that line of the staking rate going up.
00:18:01.444 - 00:18:23.954, Speaker B: But you do agree if we offer it a 20% yield. You do agree that right now, ETH staked is a $400 billion market, 75% of that is unclaimed. If it's a 20% yield that we're offering, that's going to fill up faster than a 4% yield. Right.
00:18:25.974 - 00:19:09.604, Speaker A: How much faster, though? Like how? As in, like, if the line is going to keep going up and we know that, you know, there's not a lot of yield anymore. Do we know if people are going to actually stop staking, if they're going to. If they're actually going to be able to get increased yield from restaking, which hasn't launched yet but. But will launch soon? It seems like a number again, that is a little bit poorly thought out. It's not that there shouldn't be a change, but that the change that's being proposed, the logic behind it is we think this might help, and it's very clear that it probably will not change materially any of the staking dynamics that are currently on Ethereum.
00:19:09.904 - 00:19:47.684, Speaker B: Right. It will not change material of the staking dynamics. I do believe that it will slow stake down because it does matter, especially for, like, institutional investors or traditional finance. It does matter. Tiny little percentages between, like, three, four, five do matter because it matters whether or not it's beating other financial instruments in yield. And so whether, whether or not, like, disinterested, sort of disinterested in crypto money is going to flow in, is going to matter on that. On those very small percentages, for sure.
00:19:47.684 - 00:20:07.000, Speaker B: And a lot of this, this targeting talk is predicated on MEV burn being there. And so that's already going to drop the yield a couple percent from what we're seeing today. But I understand the hesitation to, like, the 30%. Like, why drop at 30%?
00:20:07.152 - 00:20:07.616, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:20:07.640 - 00:20:12.284, Speaker B: Because we're trying to slow it down and we're trying to stem the bleed or trying to stem the influx.
00:20:13.076 - 00:20:50.100, Speaker A: I hear you. I hear of you. It's like a time in the meanwhile, as we try and figure this out, maybe this gives us more breathing room, kind of like before Max Eb, there was the limit to the churn of like, okay, let's just do this really easy change, which was also really controversial. Oh, was it? I feel like that was an easier change because it didn't specifically impact the income of stakers. It just impacted the influx of, like, how quickly new stakers could be added. And when that went into Deneb at the last minute, I was like, oh, I mean, I think that makes sense. But I hear you.
00:20:50.100 - 00:20:58.664, Speaker A: That, you know, this change to issue and this one time change could be a way to create more Runway, I guess, to figure things out.
00:20:59.564 - 00:21:36.484, Speaker B: I'm actually surprised that you supported that one, but not this one, because if you think about it like, that cap limit was, a lot of the arguments that I was seeing against that were very similar to what I'm seeing right now, which is why eight? Why did you choose eight? Like, where does this number come from? You're just throwing it on. And, like, the thing, the eips that we're going to see in the future are going to solve this issue, and you're just adding tech debt for absolutely no reason. And it was something put forth by a few core devs, really quickly, implemented really quickly, and there was this backlash of like, whoa, whoa, whoa. There's not even been any community discussion about this.
00:21:36.644 - 00:22:07.840, Speaker A: Okay, well, two things to that. Number one, the max ev, the validator growth set size, that was a real issue. That was a real problem, and that the network was already, there was too many, there's too many messages flying around. This is critical to the health of Ethereum. Whereas this topic of, like, oh, my gosh, what if 100% of total e supply gets stick? It goes to Lido. What is that? That's not a real problem. That is literally a theoretical problem that developers need to figure out.
00:22:07.840 - 00:22:12.544, Speaker A: Like, need to think a little bit harder about, like maybe the solution. Yeah.
00:22:12.624 - 00:22:24.416, Speaker B: What do you, what do you think is the difference between those two problems? Like the churn limit and the, what you said that too many messages flying around, like, there is the validator set getting too large?
00:22:24.560 - 00:22:32.842, Speaker A: Yes, that's a problem. This is a real problem because the network, protocol wise, cannot handle that many validators. It's.
00:22:32.938 - 00:22:35.234, Speaker B: But this is the same thing that this addresses.
00:22:35.354 - 00:22:46.042, Speaker A: Is the validator set is getting too large. Well, this is not the validator set size getting too large. This is too much ETH being staked and too much of that stake going to Lido.
00:22:46.218 - 00:22:49.690, Speaker B: But more ETH being staked means the validator set is increasing.
00:22:49.882 - 00:23:25.316, Speaker A: Not necessarily, because if the Max EB increases to 2048, then, you know, you could just have larger validators. And so the network's still healthy. Like, the entire network still functions. There's still a small number of validators, but the total amount of e staked is very large. And developers hate the fact that all of this total e staked is going into smart contracts, that it's not like it's in their purview. They're smart contract risk. And if that's what you're worried about, then maybe you have to enshrine a liquid staking solution, or maybe you have to do something else to penalize larger validators versus smaller bound allegations.
00:23:25.316 - 00:23:38.436, Speaker A: And so it just, it's like, is the issuance, like, I don't, I don't really think that the change to the issuance is really all as urgent as the other one was. But, I mean, I understand the slight correlation. I do see the connection a little bit.
00:23:38.540 - 00:24:36.566, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think, honestly, we're agreeing on most of the issues here on, like, what needs to be done, what needs to be implemented, and, like, how these changes need to be seen. Like, there needs to be some sort of, not just, it doesn't need to be just one change. Like, targeting seems like a very good idea to me, but I also want to see more incentives, like, correlated offline penalties that would be implemented into that so that we're not just changing how much stake is going in, we're also changing what the composition of that. The composition and the value of that stake that is in there is, because right now, we're not seeing a huge influx of new solo stakers, and that is going to be mostly liquid staking protocols. But I think what we disagree on is the timeline on which that is important. And so if we don't get into electra, it doesn't happen this year or beginning of next year.
00:24:36.566 - 00:25:28.996, Speaker B: Whenever electra happens, Osaka is the next one. Osaka is when it happens. And say, we're at, like, I think, like, the estimate was, like, 60 or 70% staked at that point. People think of, one of the things that I'm seeing is people are like, okay, well, say, like, Lido, Etherfi, rocket pool, they have, like, some vast majority of that stake that's okay, because we'll fight them. And we have, like, this, the power to socially slash them or if they, like, fight the network, wanting to lower the stake or target or whatever. But people neglect to understand, like, to, to take into account that when the network is at that high stake, you've probably, you're probably part of that system. Like, it's not just you against us, against Lido.
00:25:28.996 - 00:26:25.460, Speaker B: If Lido is integrated into everything, rocket pool, Etherfi, whatever the liquid staking protocols are, at that point, they're integrated into everything you have interest in, in them, surviving in them, and their financial success. And so at that point, like, the conversation becomes a lot more complicated, and it becomes confusing for people because they don't know who the good guy is they don't know who the bad guy is. And honestly, at that point, we are rugging people like if a liquid staking protocol or an ETF bases its entire business model on the idea that we are going to have a 2.8% yield no matter what, or a 1.8% yield no matter what, like even if we get to 100% stake, we're going to have 1.8% plus any mev that happens. And then at that point we tell them we're changing the issuance.
00:26:25.460 - 00:26:33.024, Speaker B: Then not only are we changing the issuance, but we're fucking up a whole lot of people's businesses and like, that rugs them.
00:26:36.144 - 00:27:25.008, Speaker A: I don't agree because, well, any people are building upon major business. I mean, there's billions of dollars worth of value on top of Ethereum. And Ethereum is a very experimental technology that is constantly changing. And I would kind of argue that all of the changes to issuance, all of the changes to consensus, all of the changes to Ethereum scalability roadmap that has happened so far, those are all rugs, because everyone built on Ethereum thinking that Ethereum was going to be the platform to build on, and now all the developers are like, get off our network, go to l two s. And they didn't foresee the mev stuff. So now everyone's like, oh, like, come be a validator or be a miner on Ethereum. And then you have all the mev geth, you have mev boost.
00:27:25.008 - 00:28:07.224, Speaker A: There's so much of Ethereum that is dependent on innovation that happens outside of the purview of Ethereum core developers. And so much value depends on mev boost, depends on lido, depends on l two s. And I just feel like fixating on the fact that Lido is one of those dependencies. It's like, it's all dependencies. And to some extent, I think Ethereum developers need to wake up to the reality that they do need to work more closely with all of these stakeholders. And now their bags are inextricably, like tied, meshed together with the bags of these major players.
00:28:07.764 - 00:28:55.024, Speaker B: Yeah. One thing I'll push back on is, like, you gave two examples, we changed from proof of work to proof of stake. We saw a huge pushback on that. There was a whole minor coalition that said that they weren't going to do this, they weren't going to support the upgrade. And part of the problem is they weren't really ETH holders. And that helped because they got their ETH and then they sold it and like, miners didn't really have a stake in the network, but the other one, businesses grow building on L1 and then being told to move to l two, that was a huge quality of life upgrade for them. Like, the businesses, business as usual got a lot cheaper for them to operate, and they were able to offer cheaper transactions, cheaper.
00:28:55.024 - 00:29:58.734, Speaker B: Whatever they were doing, they were able to offer that cheaper to their customers. And I think that that was a huge boost to those, to those people. But like most, most tech upgrades that we have seen so far, if they have someone on the other side, we see a lot of pushback, and I think that we will see that pushback if we do this at Osaka at a much later day. And like, granted, I honestly think that if that needs to happen, if we don't get this into Electra, there's going to be a way to deal with that. There's going to be a way to deal with it to where? If we implement something in Osaka, there can be like a ramp down procedure that says, we know this is going to disrupt a lot of people's plans, a lot of people's businesses that were built on the staking yield. But what we can do is make all of these compromises to help you off board, or there will be a plan. Either way, if we don't, if it doesn't get into Electra, if it just has to go into Osaka, I think it will be fine.
00:29:58.734 - 00:30:06.694, Speaker B: I honestly think this is a real urgent problem to be dealing with, but either way, we're going to find a way to deal with it.
00:30:07.194 - 00:30:58.142, Speaker A: Either way, we're going to be okay. No, but I like it because it's true. And I think there's also a high chance that if it doesn't go into Elektra, what would have gone into Elektra, or the reduction in issuance, it's gonna look different in Osaka. If it was a 30% reduction, then I feel like if we don't do it, then, then it knowsaka. It might be a little bit more of a proposal that maybe is a little bit closer to the end game vision that does implement not just a one time reduction, but offers some kind of more long term mechanism to figure things out or adds things like the slashing or, sorry, not the slashing, but the correlated offline penalty. I don't know. It might give Ethereum developers more pressure to figure out a more robust solution, too, but I don't know.
00:30:58.142 - 00:30:58.954, Speaker A: Who knows?
00:30:59.694 - 00:31:08.206, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think that was. I haven't finished. So the paper that Anders published on the first is we'll link to that.
00:31:08.230 - 00:31:10.554, Speaker A: In the show notes for people to read.
00:31:11.174 - 00:31:15.634, Speaker B: I hope people do read it. Probably like eight people have read it so far.
00:31:16.934 - 00:31:19.114, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm definitely not one of those people.
00:31:20.134 - 00:31:41.774, Speaker B: I have been trying. I put it on my Kindle and I have been slowly trudging through it, and he, like, lists out three different options for curves in the future and then, like, does all the math on them. But I think one of them is like a graduated change that goes towards the end game. But I'm not an expert on the paper. I haven't read the whole thing, so.
00:31:42.074 - 00:32:06.334, Speaker A: Yeah, no, that's fair. What a great conversation. I wanted to talk about Max, EV and pps, but look at that. We are already out of time. We've spent the entire time debating issuance, but I think it was useful. I mean, I feel like I understand a little bit more about the other side of the argument.
00:32:07.354 - 00:32:14.250, Speaker B: I kind of like that every time we go through these discussions, we get so hung up on our first bullet point that we don't make it fast any other way.
00:32:14.442 - 00:32:29.174, Speaker A: Yes, but this is why I love it, because it's like, I feel like our conversations are just so, like, they're just so honest. And I feel like I always understand what you're picking up and putting down, whereas I feel like sometimes the more technical conversations, it can be really hard to follow along.
00:32:30.394 - 00:32:48.672, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, that's. It's really unfortunate. I'm glad that we have people in the EF who are like, this sort of stepwise, easy to understand. To like, hard to understand. And they, like, all try to help each other out in, like, trying to get their ideas out to the community. Because if it's too hard to understand, you just. You literally don't get any buy in.
00:32:48.672 - 00:32:53.512, Speaker B: No engagement, no buy in, no, like, discussion about it at all.
00:32:53.688 - 00:33:24.926, Speaker A: 100%. It's handshake emoji all the way. Yeah, through all the steps. Anyways, well, thank you so much, Nixo, for joining again on the infinite jungle.
