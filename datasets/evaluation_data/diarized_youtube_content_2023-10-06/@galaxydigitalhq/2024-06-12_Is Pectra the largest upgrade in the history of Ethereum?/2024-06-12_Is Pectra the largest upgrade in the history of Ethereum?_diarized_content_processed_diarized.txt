There's many different eips that have now been included into Pectra. And the way that developers are going to move forward with this extremely large EIP set is they're going to test them gradually. They're going to test them in a layered way. You have your core set of Pectra eips that have already been tested on Devnet Zero and over, over the course of the following Devnets. For Devnet one, developers are planning and hopefully going to add EIP 7702, which was included in the latest call, and maybe in Devnet three or Devnet four, they add in EOF. And alongside this, of course, on the consensus layer side, developers, once they're ready, will activate peer Das, an upgrade to implement data availability sampling on Ethereum.
