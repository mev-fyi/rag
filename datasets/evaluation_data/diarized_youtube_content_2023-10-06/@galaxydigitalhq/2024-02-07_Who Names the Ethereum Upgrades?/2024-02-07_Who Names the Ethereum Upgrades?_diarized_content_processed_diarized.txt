00:00:00.120 - 00:00:40.420, Speaker A: The naming convention. I will say it's kind of a fun fact is for the consensus layer upgrades, developers try and name the upgrades after major stars. So Elektra, I believe is the name of a constellation or a star. And then for the execution layer upgrades, they name it after major cities. So Prague is a city. The upgrade after Prague is supposedly going to be called Osaka. I've been trying to get developers to try and upgrade the next upgrade after Osaka to be Seoul, but there's quite a lot of, quite a lot of what you call it support for potentially naming it after a major african city after Osaka.
