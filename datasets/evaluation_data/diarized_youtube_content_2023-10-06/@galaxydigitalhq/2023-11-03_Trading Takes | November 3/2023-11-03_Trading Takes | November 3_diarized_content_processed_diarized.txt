00:00:08.320 - 00:00:12.438, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, BiMnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:12.526 - 00:00:13.550, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:13.662 - 00:00:22.630, Speaker A: It's always great to have you on, and we have a great time because you're on every week. But this is a special week, like every couple are. Today is Fed day.
00:00:22.702 - 00:00:23.310, Speaker B: Yes.
00:00:23.462 - 00:00:25.708, Speaker A: The Fed has announced what?
00:00:25.886 - 00:00:32.416, Speaker B: That they are keeping rates on hold. Rates are set in the band of 525 to 550.
00:00:32.560 - 00:00:36.724, Speaker A: So fair to say they announced nothing. But they said things. But they said things.
00:00:37.384 - 00:01:21.554, Speaker B: They released their statement as per usual. They kind of gave their rationale as to their decision and kind of gave an overview of what they're concerned about, what they're watching. High level. They are seeing how financial conditions react to the tightening that we've had, particularly in the back end of the US interest rate curve. They're looking into how that's going to impact things like credit conditions and how that's going to impact households. And so largely, they're saying we're going to wait and see as to how things develop. And so you're seeing pretty muted price reaction to the statement.
00:01:21.554 - 00:02:11.296, Speaker B: However, we are still waiting on the press conference that's going to happen in the next 15 minutes or so, and then we should get a little bit more additional context as to the rationale. However, there's very little in terms of pricing, in terms of additional rate hikes for this year. A lot of participants are focused on cuts. And, yeah, it's an interesting day for the statement to come out because you did have a lot of data this morning in addition to the specifics around refunding came out. And so it looks like there's gonna be a little less coupon paper. And the data this morning, particularly isms, or ism in particular, was really soft.
00:02:11.360 - 00:02:12.440, Speaker A: That's the manufacturing data.
00:02:12.512 - 00:02:27.306, Speaker B: That's the manufacturing data. Paid was soft, and so were new orders. So much so that the Atlanta GDP now tracker went from, like mid twos in, like, forecasting GDP to, like, low ones.
00:02:27.370 - 00:02:27.762, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
00:02:27.818 - 00:02:54.984, Speaker B: And so. Cause new orders are like a big part of it, I believe. And so there was soft data, and we had less, like, back end supply than the market was expecting today. All before a relatively benign FOMC statement had a pretty significant rally in us yields today. We've seen the two year yield take out 5%. We've seen tens go from $4.93, 494 at the highs to 480 right now.
00:02:54.984 - 00:03:10.428, Speaker B: The dollar has been a little bit more bid than I would expect, given we've had a little bit of a risk on move in. Stocks and bonds are rallying. However, that may just be, you know, more eurocentric.
00:03:10.516 - 00:03:11.164, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:11.324 - 00:03:15.436, Speaker B: And then the other thing to keep in mind is we had Boj, like earlier this week.
00:03:15.460 - 00:03:24.744, Speaker A: Yeah. What do they do? I saw. Is it yield control? It looked like there was. Because JPY USD was like getting above 150 or dollar USD.
00:03:26.004 - 00:04:30.614, Speaker B: Yeah. No, so basically they're stuck in between a rock and a hard place. That's a function of having easy monetary policy for better part of half a century, and you just can't get out of that instantaneously. And so what they did this week was say that the 1% band was really, in terms of the ten year was really more of a reference area, even though their official target for the tenure is still technically 0%. And so they're stuck between rock and hard place in the sense that if they don't materially address the bond market dynamics, their currency is going to devalue like crazy. And unless they're willing to defend it super aggressively, they either have to hike up rates and do a little bit more enhancement of the yield curve control, or it's just more status quo and they own all the paper in the economy, all the. The risk assets, and the currency continues to devalue.
00:04:30.614 - 00:05:08.958, Speaker B: But high level, it speaks to kind of just the entire how disingenuous monetary policy is right now, whether it's domestic or abroad. These guys in the BOJ have literally transformed their economy in the sense that it's just built on zero interest rates and the BOJ endlessly expanding their balance sheet. If they started jacking up rates and bond prices started selling up, their banking system would be in trouble, similar to the US. And then in the US, it's like, wait, they have a fiscal situation that has just come totally unhinged.
00:05:09.006 - 00:05:11.902, Speaker A: You don't think Powell's gonna address the fiscal situation in the.
00:05:11.958 - 00:05:13.158, Speaker B: No, not in effect.
00:05:13.246 - 00:05:13.790, Speaker A: He hasn't.
00:05:13.862 - 00:05:18.942, Speaker B: He hasn't. But like, what is he supposed to do? Like, he actually can't do anything about it.
00:05:18.998 - 00:05:20.342, Speaker A: It's literally outside his remit.
00:05:20.398 - 00:05:25.390, Speaker B: It is, but. And then if he's like, well, you know, the fed's gonna have to monetize it at some point, then it's like.
00:05:25.422 - 00:05:34.756, Speaker A: Wait, like, I mean, he could also get called an activist or get politically targeted if he were to do this type of stuff. So it's tricky.
00:05:34.820 - 00:06:27.160, Speaker B: It's super tricky, but high level, it's like, there will be a moment of reckoning there, I think, eventually, but for me, it's just more like, I hate being lied to or deceived by my central bankers telling me, oh, everything's okay, we got it all managed. Right. Like, that didn't work out last time with telling me that inflation is transitory, right. And I think generally there's just a lot of angst in the investor community and just people in general. And, like, that's why, like, an asset like bitcoin resonates with a lot of folks, whether it's the traditional macro types or whether it's the guy that can't afford a home because, you know, the fed jacked rates to zero and everybody bought all this property and all the wealth effects, all that jazz. It's like, there's a lot of disenfranchised folks out there. And so I think it's.
00:06:27.160 - 00:06:29.992, Speaker B: I continue to remain constructive on bitcoin.
00:06:30.048 - 00:06:35.800, Speaker A: And bitcoin's over our shoulder. Right. We're around 34 five. It's basically exactly where we were when we recorded last week.
00:06:35.952 - 00:07:04.514, Speaker B: It is, for all intents and purposes, at the tradable high in real size liquidity. I mean, 34,500, it is the best performing or one of the best performing assets of the year. And it's not by coincidence you are having real size, real institutions, folks coming in and recognizing the value that's there. And it's highly differentiated. It's been uncorrelated to other risk assets as well. It's deeply liquid. There are drivs.
00:07:04.514 - 00:07:19.262, Speaker B: I mean, it's really having its moment. And obviously, the upcoming catalyst with the ETF, the bull case really writes itself. But to be honest, the bull case is made every day by these stupid central bankers. Every single day.
00:07:19.458 - 00:07:31.614, Speaker A: I mean, at least to your point. Right? And you've been more defensive of the central bankers in the past, but it seems like you're sort of. You're reaching a tip breaking point here.
00:07:31.734 - 00:07:43.286, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I've just generally just grown frustrated over time because it's just, it's like, wait, oh, we got to get involved in another conflict. What does that other conflict involve?
00:07:43.350 - 00:07:43.910, Speaker A: Cost money.
00:07:43.982 - 00:08:04.478, Speaker B: Costs money. Money you don't have money. You just print. And, like, if the dollar wasn't the reserve currency of the world, like, this wouldn't be happening. And there's no one in Congress. Well, there's very few folks in Congress that are like, hey, guys, we gotta spend a lot less. And I'm willing to take the political consequences of not spending it.
00:08:04.486 - 00:08:05.870, Speaker A: Is that a very difficult political.
00:08:05.902 - 00:08:16.568, Speaker B: It's a political impossibility at this point. And so I think there's a handful of senators that talk about it. But really, in terms of, you know, rubber meets the road actions, you can't.
00:08:16.616 - 00:08:18.440, Speaker A: And what President Trump is on a message like that.
00:08:18.472 - 00:08:22.144, Speaker B: Exactly what president's going to get elected being like, I'm going to raise your taxes and I'm going to cut spending.
00:08:22.184 - 00:08:53.464, Speaker A: This is what I like about why could the Fed not, I mean, we talked about how they're in their own political conundrum because they only have this very clear mandate by law, by the way. Right. So if they were to start speaking out about fiscal, they could be accused of meddling in politics and that could hurt the fed overall. But they're not elected representatives in the same way that congressional members and senators are. So theoretically, like, they are in a position to be the, like, you know, the big kid in the room and offer a longer term view here.
00:08:53.504 - 00:09:17.920, Speaker B: But they haven't, I mean, let's just be honest. Like, boring economists on television doesn't sell. Like, people aren't gonna turn on the tv to hear about, like, we gotta get our house in order, monetary and fiscal. Like, that's just not like a popular thing. What do people want? They want checks in the mail. They want Social Security, they want their potholes fixed and stuff. Right.
00:09:17.920 - 00:09:22.184, Speaker B: And they don't want to worry about walking down the street and getting attacked or whatever.
00:09:22.224 - 00:09:22.616, Speaker A: Right, right.
00:09:22.680 - 00:09:31.096, Speaker B: National security. Right. And so, yeah, this is a bit wonky, but it's just like, you can't have everything you want, but, like, you can't have your cake and eat it.
00:09:31.120 - 00:09:40.664, Speaker A: We've never really learned that as a nation, certainly not in generations. There are many other nations where the general populace is very familiar with the, the ills that can befall you.
00:09:40.704 - 00:09:44.260, Speaker B: I mean, there are countries that run, like, surpluses.
00:09:44.372 - 00:09:56.420, Speaker A: Yeah, well, and there are countries that have dealt with crippling inflation that actually blows up their entire economy and social order in their countries. And so those people are well aware of these types of issues, but Americans really just aren't.
00:09:56.492 - 00:10:00.020, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, Americans are. And we're not to inflation.
00:10:00.092 - 00:10:00.852, Speaker A: We're not there.
00:10:00.988 - 00:10:08.540, Speaker B: We didn't even understand inflation properly till, like, maybe even we still don't. I know, like, and so it's a very tricky dynamic.
00:10:08.572 - 00:10:28.584, Speaker A: We're not there at the, you know, the societal or economic blow up with inflation yet. But I think what we're talking about is the very long term national debt that's going to tie this country's hands in terms of what it can do fiscally because of the interest on that debt and you've got the central bank really not speaking about that part of the equation.
00:10:29.004 - 00:10:36.044, Speaker B: And it's frustrating, but because it's like, it's not just about now. It's like five years from now, what does the profile look? Ten years from now, what does the profile look?
00:10:36.084 - 00:10:36.868, Speaker A: I've seen some estimates.
00:10:36.916 - 00:10:42.944, Speaker B: It looks awful. And the estimates, you know, are bad. Projections are not good.
00:10:43.404 - 00:10:56.436, Speaker A: Well, maybe, maybe, maybe if bitcoin becomes more popular, people will learn more about a scarce, fixed commodity type money, and that, that will change some attitudes about and education about money and spending. Maybe. That's asking a lot.
00:10:56.460 - 00:11:01.780, Speaker B: But, you know, I think asking the bare minimum, because money isn't what it used to be.
00:11:01.852 - 00:11:04.884, Speaker A: Yeah. Bibnet abibi, galaxy trading. Thank you so much. Thank you.
