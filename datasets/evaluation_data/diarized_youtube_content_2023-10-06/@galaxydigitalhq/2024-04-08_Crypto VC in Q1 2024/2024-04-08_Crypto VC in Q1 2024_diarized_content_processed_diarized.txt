00:00:00.440 - 00:00:52.292, Speaker A: The first quarter of the year has been basically a busier time than almost any in my career at Galaxy as working on and leading the venture team here. I think when the market, when the broader liquid market comes back, it gives investors this feeling of a margin of safety on their investments that they kind of lean into. You see it in the data. Historically, every time bitcoin rips, there's a lag that follows in venture funding. Obviously, venture deals, they'll get done at one time, and then they'll get announced something like three to six months later. There's some variation there, and so there's a natural lag in the data. But historically, it's that venture funding number has always, especially on the downside, as prices come down, venture funding stays high until investors kind of get the message.
00:00:52.292 - 00:00:56.004, Speaker A: I think it tracks a little bit closer than that. Real deep lag because of the announcement.
