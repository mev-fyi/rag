00:00:10.800 - 00:00:31.566, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. I'm back with another rap. This year was berserk. It's our last pod, but have no fear, the whole team is here. Thank you for listening. We'll see you next year. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital.
00:00:31.566 - 00:01:15.894, Speaker A: And like, like I said, we this is our last podcast of the year. We have a crazy roundtable. We have six guests, all of whom you've met before on Galaxy Brains. We're going to talk with Tyler Williams, Bimnet Abibi, Christine Kim, Saul Kadir, Walt Smith, and Charles Yu about policy, bitcoin, Ethereum, nfts, defi, stable coins, roll ups, a lot more. And so it's gonna be a fun one. But, you know, I do have to tell you to look at the link to the disclaimer on the podcast notes, and note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. We got that disclaimer out of the way, so let's get right into it.
00:01:15.894 - 00:02:02.800, Speaker A: All right. Before we get into it with some of our guests, I'm going to talk a little bit about bitcoin and the year that we've had. I think there's a couple big stories, stories in bitcoin specifically. First, I would say the biggest story is the mining industry absolutely ballooned and came onshore to the US in 2021 following the growing access to us public markets. But also the banning of bitcoin mining in China led to a lot of capital raising and debt raising by publicly listed us miners, many of whom have found themselves struggling in 2022. I think that's one of the biggest stories we haven't seen. Hash rate really come down a lot.
00:02:02.800 - 00:02:37.956, Speaker A: In fact, difficulty is still up near all time highs. But I think we have to expect that we will see some reduction and we'll certainly see more consolidation in the mining space. We'll talk more about that, of course, with our friends from Galaxy digital mining. And as always, by the way, I should tell you, there'll be sort of an end of year mining report from that awesome team. Put one out about, I think, every six months or so for several years now, and they're excellent. So you'll get more details on that. I think another big story for bitcoin is just the sort of separation and differentiation from the other cryptos.
00:02:37.956 - 00:03:19.114, Speaker A: I think that's, I think, been true in general. You know, bitcoin's always sort of stood alone. It's the oldest, it's the first, it's the most valuable, it's all of that remains true. But, for example, with ethereum moving from proof of work to proof of stake with the merge, I think that leaves bitcoin as the only major crypto asset or cryptocurrency that uses proof of work, which is a major differentiator, I think. I'm personally a big supporter of proof of work, but also in other ways. Bitcoin, it never built. It doesn't have the robust on chain programmability that say, something like ethereum does, which is, I think, a positive for bitcoin.
00:03:19.114 - 00:04:42.816, Speaker A: And it also means, though, that the hacks that we see on chain, the rise and fall of these various on chain markets like bitcoin is pretty insulated from that. When you look at the failure of many centralized intermediaries in this ecosystem over the last year, bitcoin unaffected by that, except for the extent that those intermediaries own bitcoin or used it. So I think the story for bitcoin is that it keeps working. I will say there's another story, is that in the face of inflation, literally consumer price increases, bitcoin did not act as an inflation hedge. But I've argued in the past, and I believe this, and I think if you went back and checked my record, you wouldn't find me calling it a hedge on price inflation. I think the idea is that it's a hedge on the monopoly of money creation by central banks and perhaps even a vote on the credibility of central banking. The reality is, with central banks tightening dramatically and increasing the cost of money, which is a big pivot from where we were in 2020, when banks were dramatically increasing the supply of money, you could say central banks have become more credible.
00:04:42.816 - 00:05:40.324, Speaker A: And thus it makes sense that bitcoin isn't that hedge against central banks is playing out against bitcoin's price, obviously. I think, though, the bigger story for bitcoin price is the story for all risk assets, which came off one of the largest bubbles and risk assets in history, which began to crack and pop at the end of 2021. And of course, bitcoin has not been spared from a drawdown across all risks. But there's also great developments happening in lightning. We haven't really seen a large adoption of taproot yet, but that's a powerful upgrade that could see interesting new things built. There were discussions this year in the development community around covenants and privacy, and now talking about replaced by fee, and bitcoin just keeps working. I'm pretty bullish on the long term prospects for bitcoin, as I don't think that will surprise anyone.
00:05:40.324 - 00:06:17.696, Speaker A: But it's going to be an interesting year, I think, with bitcoin now as the only proof of work cryptocurrency that matters, and also not sort of playing this development game that really all the other chains are sort of forced to do, which is sort of one upping each other or adding new tech development on a regular basis, lest they be obsoleted by some new entrant. Bitcoin really remains quite different than the rest of the crypto ecosystem, which I think is a big positive for bitcoin. So that's all I'll say on bitcoin for now. Let's get into it with our first guest, bim net ab, our friend from Galaxy Digital trading. Great to have you as, as always. How are you doing?
00:06:17.800 - 00:06:19.296, Speaker B: Doing great. How are you doing?
00:06:19.360 - 00:06:20.584, Speaker A: I'm great, too. I'm excited.
00:06:20.624 - 00:06:21.208, Speaker C: Beautiful.
00:06:21.336 - 00:06:23.152, Speaker A: This is our year end episode.
00:06:23.248 - 00:06:24.364, Speaker B: I'm so pumped.
00:06:24.824 - 00:06:50.894, Speaker A: You got a lot of fans out there in podcast land, and normally we sort of keep it a bit tight. We say, what happened last week? What did Jay Powell say today? Et cetera. But I'm thinking more I'd love when you look back at this crazy year, 2022, in markets, not just crypto, of course, but in macro and everywhere else. I don't know, what's your big takeaway? I don't know how to ask this question, but 2022? Speak.
00:06:51.314 - 00:07:41.154, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I mean, this year, I would say the biggest thing that happened was the cracking of the bond market. Basically the massive shift that you've had from super easy monetary policy to the complete opposite. Before this year, you were in a 30, 40 year bull market in bonds, and the whole world is long bonds like crazy. And all of a sudden, the Fed jacked up rates to four, 5%. And that had a huge impact on basically everything. The dollar went crazy. You had things like the pound crashing dollar yen, forcing a bank of Japan intervention in their currency market, not just once, but twice.
00:07:41.154 - 00:08:56.242, Speaker B: And so it's been a year that I would say where everybody had to reconsider basically every investment on the planet because the opportunity cost of money went sky high. Every investment has to be pegged to interest rates. And when interest rates are four or 5%, that means those projects need to be earning a lot more. And so what higher interest rates have caused is just a recalibration of every investment to account for the opportunity cost of money and that's been pretty transformational. The other big thing was just the idea of hard assets and commodities. When you're at war you really care about getting food and oil and minor disruptions in this causes huge delays in semiconductors. And so I think given the Russia crimea stuff and the huge moves you had in commodities, I think a lot of investors have a newfound appreciation for commodities and real world assets.
00:08:56.242 - 00:09:40.428, Speaker B: I mean just think about it. All of the guys that were about ESG investing this year got wrecked. If you weren't in energy because you were like, it's bad for the environment, well that meant your returns were lower, but moving on. So you had that sort of us jacking up rates, they lead the way, the US central bank always leads others. And that basically caused everyone from the Canadians, New Zealands, EM countries, they all started jacking up their rates and if they didn't, their currency was going to collapse. And you finally the last thing to drop was the bank of Japan. And they just did it yesterday, literally just to beat the year end mark.
00:09:40.428 - 00:10:20.036, Speaker B: They adjusted their yield curve control policy from 25 basis point cap on tens to 50. It was the first sort of hawkish shift you had in the BOJ. And they're the last remaining. They're still on negative interest rates in the front end. In a world where their inflation is not only continually going up but it's actually accelerating in the data, that's crazy. Yeah, it's crazy to me because when you juxtapose that with where we were during COVID which was just like here's bond buying programs, we're buying 120 billion per month. You had negative interest rate policy priced in the US briefly, that was 2020.
00:10:20.036 - 00:11:08.294, Speaker B: But yeah, but still, you went from all this easy money, crazy amount of like everything's going up forever, venture investments, trading at ridiculous valuations to guys, no, we can't do that. There are issues with just printing money like crazy. And obviously this deleveraging has impacted crypto as well. And that's why largely speaking, the move in interest rates is what's caused the role in equities and other risk assets, venture investments, et cetera. But yeah, that's the main story. And now in terms of where we're going from here, it really depends on what inflation does domestically and abroad. There's a path towards a soft landing in the US.
00:11:08.294 - 00:11:59.284, Speaker B: I think it's very feasible and that's what the market is pricing in and what the sort of forecasts that the Fed are providing price. They're basically saying unemployment is going to get to 4.7 and you're going to see some slowdown in growth, but it's not going to be a collapse. And stocks are trading at fine multiples here. Breakeven inflations are telling you you're going to get to within spitting distance of the Fed's inflation target. And so the market's like, yeah, soft landing seems feasible and is the likely outcome that's being priced. And if you, you know, not to get too granular, but in terms of a hard landing scenario, I think that in my head and in the market's head, which I kind of agree with right now, that's probably like a 20% probability.
00:12:00.784 - 00:12:01.568, Speaker A: Wow.
00:12:01.736 - 00:12:04.368, Speaker B: You know, maybe 25, 2020, 5% of.
00:12:04.376 - 00:12:07.560, Speaker A: A hard landing and the 75% of a soft landing is how the market.
00:12:07.592 - 00:12:38.984, Speaker B: Is currently viewing it, depending on how you look at it. The way, you know, I think about it is like, like what are the low delta? Or what's the implied probability that the S and P goes to 3300 or the implied probability that the Fed cuts by 150 basis points or more? So if you look at those markets and look at those option curves and try to bake in or try to extract out a probability, that's kind of where I'm getting to like 20% ish.
00:12:39.024 - 00:12:46.214, Speaker A: Wow, that's extremely bullish. Or on the market's view, right. I don't know if it is bullish. I mean, it's optimistic. Let me put it that way.
00:12:46.674 - 00:12:54.770, Speaker B: It is optimistic. There's a lot of people, you get a lot more headlines being like, doomsday, this thing's going, oh, man.
00:12:54.842 - 00:13:00.386, Speaker A: How many people? First of all, there's been the long term ones that were. The broken clock has been right twice a day.
00:13:00.450 - 00:13:00.890, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:13:00.962 - 00:13:12.454, Speaker A: They've been bearish for, they missed the entire run up from the last recession until 2021. The, all those guys came back and, and then you get a whole new class of these.
00:13:12.994 - 00:13:13.762, Speaker B: No, absolutely.
00:13:13.818 - 00:13:21.322, Speaker A: I mean, you also get the crypt, crypto fudsters, these guys that come out of the woodwork. You know, they're on Twitter, they use the, the alarm and the asterisks as.
00:13:21.338 - 00:13:24.490, Speaker B: If they're like a Bloomberg squawker, I gotta tell you.
00:13:24.522 - 00:13:26.854, Speaker A: I mean, it's a bull market for bearishness.
00:13:29.994 - 00:13:31.458, Speaker B: It's a bull market for Fud.
00:13:31.546 - 00:13:32.058, Speaker A: Yeah, it is.
00:13:32.106 - 00:13:32.578, Speaker B: You know.
00:13:32.666 - 00:13:33.050, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:33.122 - 00:13:34.522, Speaker B: And Fud sells.
00:13:34.578 - 00:13:39.164, Speaker A: And you're saying the data doesn't really support that level of negativity.
00:13:39.204 - 00:14:04.660, Speaker B: I mean, like the guy that's saying stuff's gonna be fine is not gonna be the guy that you're listening to or like clicking the article. Guys, things are gonna be okay. Chill out. That's not a headline you wanna click, but it's kind of shape it up that way. Here abroad, the story is rest of world. Oh my God, it's so complicated. You have like some places in the eurozone with like high teens, like low twenties, I think inflation.
00:14:04.660 - 00:14:49.664, Speaker B: And they have like all these weird risks. It's like, who really wants to buy italian bonds? I'll tell you, nobody but the ECB. And so it's like, wait, the gilt market exploded when we took a step back in Japan. It's like, well, they own 50% of basically a ton of their asset markets owned by the BOJ. And it's like, well, if we start shifting, what does that do? And the problem is you have just such entrenched behavior that still isn't out of the market. When you were programmed to think bonds only rally and interest rates stay low forever. And you do all of your financial planning in that current world, you're not set up yet.
00:14:49.664 - 00:15:07.000, Speaker B: If you're an insurance company that's managing 2030 year liabilities and you've been doing it for 2030 years, and you're just like, oh, it's easy, just buy long dated bonds. Well, no, those things are about to sell off like crazy and they're not set up for it.
00:15:07.032 - 00:15:11.904, Speaker A: Entire economies and national economic strategies were based around those assumptions.
00:15:11.944 - 00:15:37.584, Speaker B: Absolutely. I mean, just take the simple bank model. Take your deposits, pay you next to nothing and buy super long dated bonds. Or like much further out the curve. Now the liability costs you more than what you're generating on the assets. And that's like how you get to be insolvent. Yeah, that's awful, right? We have to, there's still parts of the world that have to go through that correction.
00:15:37.584 - 00:16:01.280, Speaker B: And then you throw in sort of the commodity super cycle that might not super cycle. That's, I don't want to use like lots of guys use paradigm shift like crazy. Like you read about paradigm shifts. That's like, that's a big statement. That's a big, big statement. But the commodities, the commodities can, I think there's a risk that you get like further sort of upside and a lot of commodities.
00:16:01.392 - 00:16:07.144, Speaker A: I think this smart people like you have said this, right? Even like Zoltan, right, has been talking.
00:16:07.144 - 00:16:17.656, Speaker B: About the big one. The big headline is Jeffrey Curry at Goldman, he's their commodities analyst. He was really good early in the year, last year, super bullish oil.
00:16:17.720 - 00:16:22.896, Speaker A: And he was pulling what, 43% appreciation in commodities in 2023 is his prediction.
00:16:22.960 - 00:16:45.504, Speaker B: That's his prediction. You know what, there's a healthy two way risk to that prediction, but I am inclined to think that that number sounds feasible to me. Think about this. A quarter or a fifth of humanity is about to reopen. There's like literally 1.3 billion people that have been trapped at home in China. In China, yeah.
00:16:45.504 - 00:16:48.704, Speaker B: Not doing anything and saving money and working.
00:16:48.864 - 00:16:51.056, Speaker A: Are they really gonna reopen though? Haven't we heard this?
00:16:51.120 - 00:16:59.848, Speaker B: Everything points that way. Now it's like, now it is. I mean it's happening. And like once you let the genie out the bottle, like why?
00:16:59.976 - 00:17:00.784, Speaker A: I agree. Right.
00:17:00.824 - 00:17:02.696, Speaker B: And you remember in the US when.
00:17:02.720 - 00:17:07.696, Speaker A: We reopen, it was gangbusters, masks off, and now it's like, no, there's nothing they could do.
00:17:07.760 - 00:17:09.744, Speaker B: Yeah. They would have partying in the streets.
00:17:09.784 - 00:17:13.720, Speaker A: Yeah. They would have to really, really go hard to actually put us back.
00:17:13.832 - 00:17:14.704, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:17:14.744 - 00:17:15.664, Speaker A: I mean it would take a lot.
00:17:15.704 - 00:17:35.461, Speaker B: I mean think about it would literally take like imagine like chinese people were protesting like crazy. They were, and it was hitting the media. And that's the big risk if you're Communist Party, et cetera. And so when you have a fifth of humanity about to go crazy after saving a bunch of money.
00:17:35.517 - 00:17:36.741, Speaker A: Buy stuff, buy stuff.
00:17:36.837 - 00:17:39.645, Speaker B: Travel, ride cars, goods.
00:17:39.749 - 00:17:40.149, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:40.221 - 00:17:53.842, Speaker B: I mean that's going to put some upward pressure on commodities most likely. And then the question is, okay, well if oil starts to go crazy again, does inflation in the US come back? And then it's like, holy shit, part.
00:17:53.858 - 00:17:54.714, Speaker A: Of the CPI, right?
00:17:54.754 - 00:18:02.306, Speaker B: Yeah, well, yeah, if you're looking at headline, I mean, I don't even know why they strip out energy. People spend money on gas, I care about how much money I spend on gas.
00:18:02.330 - 00:18:03.274, Speaker A: Me too. Right.
00:18:03.314 - 00:18:11.498, Speaker B: And it feeds into all the other goods and stuff and it's like, you know, core CPI nonsense. So it's like a legacy number.
00:18:11.546 - 00:18:36.704, Speaker A: This is sort of a big, I don't know what the word is, but like sort of question mark, then how the China reopening actually affects, I mean thrown out one, right, the commodity, upward pressure on commodities prices is one, but also the ripple effects, it could affect the supply chain again if all of a sudden they need to get a ton of stuff in by boat or out by boat, the whole big question mark for how that impacts 23. Absolutely. Yeah.
00:18:37.524 - 00:18:43.784, Speaker B: But all I know for sure is that interest rates are high and.
00:18:45.484 - 00:18:45.772, Speaker A: If.
00:18:45.788 - 00:18:56.540, Speaker B: You think about it, you're not really taking risk. If you go buy a six month t bill and earn four and a half percent. That's four and a half percent that you're making without taking any risk.
00:18:56.612 - 00:19:05.844, Speaker A: So the risk to treasury specifically, right, is a us default. So when we say, like, you know, when you and everyone else says that treasuries are risk free, it's because what has that ever happened?
00:19:05.884 - 00:19:08.584, Speaker B: It's really because the Fed can just buy them.
00:19:09.244 - 00:19:13.204, Speaker A: Well, because the risk is so low. Because there we have our own money printer.
00:19:13.284 - 00:19:43.910, Speaker B: Yes, basically. Well, it's because us is the dominant sort of monetary system in the world. But it's also if you're worried you don't even have to go that far out in duration, you can buy a short dated one and you're not taking any term risk, you'll get the money back in six months. And we're just talking about the US credit. If you go up the credit stack of like corporate or you know, and you get more yields or like mortgage like aaa, cos it just makes it.
00:19:43.942 - 00:19:53.134, Speaker A: Really hard for getting your returns out of like asset risk. Asset appreciation. Yeah. When you can put stuff in very low risk stuff that just pays you money. Yeah, that's the bullet.
00:19:53.174 - 00:20:02.542, Speaker B: The risk adjusted returns don't make like investing in like a crazy tech company like that worth it right now. Like, I just, I don't see it.
00:20:02.638 - 00:20:07.834, Speaker A: So how long does this last though? Is it until rates come down or is it until they stabilize at a level?
00:20:08.374 - 00:20:54.094, Speaker B: I mean here's the thing, here's the risk to the risk assets. Essentially the Fed's telling you they're going to go higher for longer and they want to keep rates high. And let's just say the fed realizes they could keep rates high and shit's fine. People don't go crazy. Unemployment doesn't go crazy if that happens. And they realize if that happens, right? And what you're sacrificing is really like a little bit of growth upfront. The question is, are you sacrificing like big picture, like long term huge productivity gains by having front end rates so high and the cost of money so high for a really long period of time? Right?
00:20:54.994 - 00:21:02.084, Speaker A: So you're saying like we lose out on like the investment in new technologies that will yield huge benefit years in the future? Is that the idea?
00:21:02.124 - 00:21:45.684, Speaker B: I mean that's a pretty big thing. That's a risk. The reason fundamentally, I was having a debate on the desk about us dominance and why us dominance is going to continue. People can point to we got nukes, we got aircraft carriers, we have the Federal Reserve, like the Swift system, et cetera. But really, for me, you know what? It comes down to Silicon Valley. We got the best tech, the best brains, and you pull tons of talent together and you build cool stuff that everyone on the planet uses that ability to innovate your way into growth and revenues. Apple is basically a giant country.
00:21:45.684 - 00:21:59.020, Speaker B: How did that come about? That comes from a capital market and capital formation aided by low interest rates and deeply hindered by high ones.
00:21:59.092 - 00:22:01.948, Speaker A: I see. That's very interesting.
00:22:02.036 - 00:22:08.932, Speaker B: Right? And so that's not necessarily how the Fed thinks about it, but that's how I think about it.
00:22:08.948 - 00:22:09.604, Speaker A: That's a risk.
00:22:09.724 - 00:22:11.356, Speaker B: That's a risk. It's like, who wants to?
00:22:11.420 - 00:22:17.836, Speaker A: And it's not that it goes away, but it's sort of like, how much do we lose a period of time, right? While we're not, like, if I'm a.
00:22:17.860 - 00:22:22.628, Speaker B: Big money manager, it's like, am I gonna throw money into venture? Especially in the year, the kind of.
00:22:22.636 - 00:22:24.898, Speaker A: Year that venture is venture this year.
00:22:25.036 - 00:22:26.622, Speaker B: Nah, dude, stick it in bonds.
00:22:26.678 - 00:22:27.230, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:27.382 - 00:22:28.054, Speaker B: Take no risk.
00:22:28.094 - 00:22:31.958, Speaker A: And that means fewer companies getting founded, fewer entrepreneurs. Right?
00:22:32.006 - 00:22:39.914, Speaker B: Like, think about a regular company, Microsoft. They always have an investment trick. Do I invest in research and development.
00:22:40.254 - 00:22:43.862, Speaker A: Or do I do a core thing?
00:22:43.958 - 00:22:48.054, Speaker B: Like, do I just return money to my shareholders, or do I buy back my own debt?
00:22:48.094 - 00:23:09.368, Speaker A: Like, there's so many, and it's hard. If you are looking at that question and you've got, let's say I forget. Harvard business school calls it the golden ratio. I forget what it is. Maybe it's 15%. They suggest that, like, every mature company should be investing in R and D, right, and, like, disrupting themselves. But it's like, you know, if you've got to cut a bunch of money, right, or cut back on your opex, like, it looks like something you might not need.
00:23:09.368 - 00:23:23.254, Speaker A: A nice to have, perhaps not a need to have, but that has a long term effect, perhaps, on discoveries not being made, new science not being developed, et cetera. So that's a really interesting side effect. I hadn't thought about of high front end rates.
00:23:23.834 - 00:23:29.974, Speaker B: Absolutely. And it's also, I mean, I don't know. I feel like I don't need to learn to code right now. Have you seen this?
00:23:31.994 - 00:23:41.898, Speaker A: I haven't seen. Is this a meme now that you, like, you don't need to, because it used to be like, you know, from 2010 to 2020, every kid. Yeah. Who says, well, what should I major in? You were like, engineering.
00:23:41.986 - 00:23:45.882, Speaker B: Yeah. And now I'm like, development. Learn how to, like, use this. Yeah.
00:23:45.978 - 00:23:48.378, Speaker A: I mean, can chat GPT code for us? It's a good question.
00:23:48.426 - 00:23:50.098, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
00:23:50.146 - 00:23:50.774, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:51.114 - 00:23:52.858, Speaker B: I mean, I just. Yes.
00:23:52.946 - 00:24:06.802, Speaker A: All right, well, this has been a fun conversation, a little go for hours, honestly, this is. I know, but we got a bunch of other people to get to, so thank you. Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Digital trading. As always, my friend, and have a great holiday and new year.
00:24:06.858 - 00:24:07.574, Speaker B: You too.
00:24:08.114 - 00:24:13.574, Speaker A: Christine Kim from Galaxy Research. My friend. Welcome to the show, as always. How are you?
00:24:14.114 - 00:24:21.344, Speaker D: I'm doing well. I'm currently in Canada with my parents and it's been really nice to see them. How are you, Alex?
00:24:21.424 - 00:25:05.144, Speaker A: I am excellent. Today is my last day in New York for several weeks, so I'm excited to get out into the real world where it's not the hustle and bustle for the holidays. I'm sure you are too. So as I've said to everyone on the show today, this is our year end episode. And so you're among many things, an Ethereum researcher, and you've been covering Ethereum doggedly all year and you've been, you know, so when I tell you, Christine, this is the year end 2022 show, like, what is the big story for Ethereum in 2022 this past year or several stories? You know, what's the big takeaway in your mind?
00:25:06.044 - 00:26:31.014, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I think that people won't be surprised when I say that the big Ethereum story of 2022 was undoubtedly the success of the merge. It's hard to understate the significance of Ethereum's transition to proof of stake, both in terms of the network's value and history and in terms of the sheer complexity of what the merge did to Ethereum. It overhauled an entire blockchain consensus mechanism while that blockchain was still running and supporting billions of dollars worth of assets on chain. It's an incredible feat that now, almost 100 days later, is still proving itself as one of Ethereum's most radical and successful upgrades ever. A few major impacts of the merge on Ethereum that's been playing out include, of course, the electricity consumption of the network declining by over 99%, daily issuance of ETH, dropping from roughly 15,000 ETH to just under 2000 block times on Ethereum, becoming way more predictable and frequent. And so these were all expected impacts of the merge that now we're seeing indeed as like a reality on the network. So I think very different from what is perhaps like the big story of the broader crypto industry, which is the degradation of trust, the big story of the year for Ethereum, I think is one of success and is one of for cause for celebration.
00:26:31.554 - 00:27:07.646, Speaker A: You've done a great job covering the merge. We have a ton of content out there on the merge and Ethereum from Christine. Everyone should check out. You can obviously just go to galaxy.com research and click the Ethereum button and see plenty of research there. When we think about where we're headed now, I feel like the Ethereum story is always a development story because they have been altering and upgrading this thing every six months for years. What do we have to look forward to in 2023? From a development standpoint, I'm really glad.
00:27:07.670 - 00:28:40.384, Speaker D: That you asked that question, because there is so much to look forward to. And if the merge, which had never been done before, this is an indication of just like the, what do you call it? Like the brink of the iceberg. I don't know if that's the right word, but the tip of the iceberg of what is possible. We've got so much upcoming on Ethereum's development roadmap, and it includes things like Zkevms, further development of optimistic roll ups in the L2 ecosystem on Ethereum, scalability through dank sharding efforts to continue to reduce the size of Ethereum state through state expiry and statelessness. We've got enshrined PBS as a solution to ongoing issues around MeV and so much more. So really, I think there's a lot to get excited about in terms of the progress being made in the crypto space, to cryptography, to mathematics, to decentralized governance, blockchain scalability, and so forth, that even though there's been a lot of embarrassing and frankly very damning and criminal activity in the crypto space, there's a ton of potential and work being done on the technology. And so, yeah, I would probably encourage a lot of our listeners to think of the merge and think of what's upcoming as reason for why this, why blockchain technology still has a lot of promising potential and is still worth watching in 2023.
00:28:40.844 - 00:29:16.446, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we're going to see a lot more interesting stuff from the Ethereum crowd. They've definitely pushed the limits on a lot of things people didn't think were possible. I mean, I think about ZK. Let's stick on there for a second. Cause you've also done a lot of research on zero knowledge, everything but the ZKVM being, I think the part where it really ties right into Ethereum specifically. This is something that basically didn't exist or was even thought perhaps impossible just a few years ago. Sort of like generalized computation inside a zero knowledge system.
00:29:16.446 - 00:30:01.544, Speaker A: And I think when I remember at Fidelity, when I was doing blockchain research, we were looking at things, it's a little different, but similar concepts was homomorphic encryption. You could only do addition and subtraction inside this thing. And now, now you're talking about running the entire EVM inside a zero knowledge system. And that's really, I mean, we have to give credit, like that drive to scale. Ethereum is what really produced this incredible science now of zero knowledge, all these innovations that we see in the zero knowledge space. What's the story with ZK and Ethereum? What do you think? Or maybe offer some predictions of where ZK and Ethereum go in 2023?
00:30:03.444 - 00:30:57.984, Speaker D: Honestly, I think that in 2023 we're going to start to see early implementations of Zkevms through pre alpha test sets. Very limited functionality like centralized networks that use validity proofs, that generate these general computations, that verify these general computations using ZK. But a lot of it will still be early stages in 2023. I don't imagine that any of these ZKE evms will be really production ready. I actually expect many of them to break like once they are open for more users. And initially, like the prover sets, the sequencer sets will all be very permissioned and it'll be baby steps, I think, in 2023. But it'll be cool for a greater number of the Ethereum community to start interacting with the technology, getting familiar with it.
00:30:57.984 - 00:31:43.348, Speaker D: I actually think that in the meanwhile, there will probably be a lot more development and things to be watching around just the general L2 landscape as ZkevM tech is being developed, there will probably be a lot more trust and adoption for the more mature and seasoned layer, two roll ups that have already launched, like arbitrum and optimism. And I'm really excited to see more decentralization from optimism and arbitrum just because they've been around longer and their tech is a lot more ossified. I think it's time in 2023 to start raising the bar higher and holding them accountable to higher decentralization standards.
00:31:43.516 - 00:32:09.864, Speaker A: And another big topic that you've covered, Christine, is MEV and this decentralization or centralization of block production on ethereum. So where does MeV boost go in 2023? And what does the block play? Production censorship? Where does this whole issue land with censoring relays and stuff like that? What are your predictions there for the next year?
00:32:11.484 - 00:33:27.954, Speaker D: I think that the trend we're seeing now of more relay competition and more builder competition will continue. I think so long as we are in a bear market in 2023 and on chain activity is. Is still dampened, I think we will see a further reduction in the dominance of flashbots. However, I think that no matter how many relays get built, no matter how many new builders enter into the fray, as soon as defi activity picks up, as soon as rewards from priority fees, MeV start to increase because of on chain activity increasing, I think we are going to see a reversion back to what is most trusted, which is the flashbots relay, and the use of exclusive order flow to boost the dominance of certain builders over others. I think what we'll see is we'll see decentralization, diversification, and then, as on chain activity picks up, markets get better. You know, we start to move off of a bear market into like a bull. I think we're going to start to see the effects of centralization.
00:33:27.954 - 00:34:31.938, Speaker D: And so, you know, on that timeline, who knows where the markets are going to go. Developers are currently working on a bunch of different solutions to tackle this issue of builder centralization. None of them, I think, will be particularly ready for 2023. But there'll be things to be watching in 2023. And that is, of course, like the efforts to build enshrine PBS, the efforts around suave, which is flashbots solution to decentralized block building. And one last notable one that I think will launch in 2023 is Eigen layer, which is a protocol to impose additional slashing conditions on validators and thereby allow them to restake their staked ETH. So I think that protocol and suave and these, the efforts by theme core developers to move forward and try and be pbs, I think those solutions will make progress in 2023.
00:34:32.106 - 00:34:40.634, Speaker A: Christine Kim from Galaxy Research. As always, my friend, thank you so much. Walt Smith, welcome from the Galaxy research and trading teams. Nice to see you.
00:34:40.754 - 00:34:41.522, Speaker E: Good to see you, too.
00:34:41.578 - 00:34:56.920, Speaker A: So, Walt, you were one of the primary authors of Galaxy research's ready layer one report, which we released, actually, about a year ago. And it was called ready layer one ethereum and its competitors. Right. And it's smart contract competitors.
00:34:56.992 - 00:34:57.884, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah.
00:34:58.184 - 00:35:06.432, Speaker A: And we looked at, what, ten l one competitors to ETH? Primarily. Primarily a report about all layer one blockchain networks.
00:35:06.488 - 00:35:07.024, Speaker E: Yep.
00:35:07.144 - 00:35:15.544, Speaker A: A lot's changed since then, in your mind, sort of, what is the layer one story, you know, ex bitcoin of 2022.
00:35:15.664 - 00:35:43.294, Speaker E: Yeah, I think that's a great place to start. I mean, I remember we talked about twelve months ago, probably a little bit before that, too, just how everything was kind of like a fork of geth. Everything is based off of the EVM. If you want general computation, if you want smart contracts, you kind of have to use the existing development tooling. You want to be able to test your code. You want to be able to have some securities and have it be audited. So you're going to write it in solidity.
00:35:43.294 - 00:36:32.824, Speaker E: It's going to be the EVM. But that's broken down. I think early on, the EVM was really commoditizable, and you could copy and paste it and make it faster, and the market demanded that. But the micro structure on all these chains has broken down. So now it's like, okay, what's the most durable asset? What has the most durable network? And I think going forward, we're going to see this even more. How you differentiate your chain technologically is going to matter more in a bear market. And for ETH, especially, like, a few upgrades that are supposed to come out in 2023 are going to make the EVM incompatible to be like, the new fork is going to be incompatible with the evms or the geth that's on a couple other all l one s.
00:36:32.824 - 00:36:47.222, Speaker E: It's not going to really be like, you could substitute this EVM for this EVM anymore. So block space is going to kind of become, having a new premium, I think. And that's kind of something we've seen play out. We've seen that play out with a few other chains.
00:36:47.318 - 00:36:48.950, Speaker A: Yeah. What other chains?
00:36:49.142 - 00:36:54.314, Speaker E: Well, we've talked about, like, Solana Avax and Luna.
00:36:54.694 - 00:36:55.790, Speaker A: Sol. Luna Avax.
00:36:55.862 - 00:36:56.230, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:36:56.302 - 00:36:59.270, Speaker A: This was the all l one trade of last fall.
00:36:59.422 - 00:37:35.064, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah, totally. And I think Solana's vm is very different. Sea level is really performative, and it takes a much stronger node to run, but the tooling around it has gotten a lot better. Developers struggled early on riding on there, but people are now forking sea level, putting it on rollup. So I think you're starting to see chains that are really distinct. Every layer start to have their own ecosystems and maybe their own network effect and be able to pull away from just the EVM. But again, the existing chains that just forked Geth in just right, we're faster.
00:37:35.064 - 00:38:19.576, Speaker E: It's kind of like, where do you go from here? Like you were just copying the developers. You can't copy them anymore. The new upgrade's going to be incompatible. So as far as, like, Solana goes, I think it has kind of a branding issue right now with some of the fallout from the last month's events, but I think it still has jump building, like great clients diversifying, like what the software, the validators are running, making it faster. Luna is actually kind of rebranded and has the best documentation and it's the only open source permissionless Cosmos chain. So basically that means you can, if you want to launch adapt, you can just launch it instantly. On a lot of other cosmos chains, it's kind of like whitelisting.
00:38:19.576 - 00:38:22.152, Speaker E: You have to get permission from the chain to launch an application.
00:38:22.248 - 00:38:22.776, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:38:22.840 - 00:38:38.638, Speaker E: So because Terra had all this documentation, because it has, because it's open, like a lot of developers are still there. So I think that economy is pretty much dead and branding wise, I don't think it'll ever come back. That's hard to get a narrative around decentralized money.
00:38:38.806 - 00:38:41.374, Speaker A: Right. But I hear you.
00:38:41.494 - 00:38:43.118, Speaker E: As far as other ones go, I don't know.
00:38:43.166 - 00:39:15.380, Speaker A: Well, no, I mean, I guess what I'm hearing is interesting. We were in this phase where like it was sort of, any EVM chain could launch, you could sidechain, it could be just like you said, tweak. And everyone said, oh my gosh, there's all this evm block space you could build anywhere and it was sort of interchangeable and there were bridges. And in addition to that fork capability being reduced by future Ethereum upgrades, if not totally bricked. You're saying people are going to start really gravitating instead towards the durable chain itself.
00:39:15.532 - 00:39:16.220, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:39:16.372 - 00:39:30.416, Speaker A: And so like on Ethereum, we're going to have all these roll ups or whatever and we're going to get the ips that make roll ups even better and easier and cheaper. And you think that's where that goes going forward? Instead of like all the block space being across chain, like if more block space is needed, it happens at layers.
00:39:30.560 - 00:40:22.618, Speaker E: Yeah, I think that's a good way of kind of looking at it. I think in a bull market it's kind of easy to swallow, like downtime or really high inflation rates. In a bear market, you're kind of like, what's going to save my cash for the next run? So at least from like a holder's perspective, I think that's the right way of looking at it. As far as roll ups go, I mean, TVL and optimism and arbitrum is higher than a lot of the l one s that had billion dollar valuations that were just geth forks a little bit faster. Some optimizations don't want to disparage all the developers working at every protocol. But ultimately, you probably had four, maybe five chains that were worth billions and billions of dollars that were really just forks of gath. Now, that geth is not necessarily reforkable, I guess, is how you could put it.
00:40:22.618 - 00:40:40.338, Speaker E: You are going to see this distinction between Solana has this moat around sea level. Cosmos arguably has a moat with its tech stack, which is very, very different than all the other ones. Now, you could see something like a new chain come in that optimizes in a different way, possibly.
00:40:40.466 - 00:40:42.058, Speaker A: We talked about Aptos and Swe.
00:40:42.146 - 00:40:42.530, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:40:42.562 - 00:41:08.546, Speaker A: People think those are different language, sort of different design, and that maybe there's a space in the tech differentiation landscape for them. Yeah, but I. But I'm not saying there is. I think that's when you look at the space. Right. You think of these. I like the way, I hope other people are thinking about it, like the way we are, which is that you've got, you know, you've got the EVM and Ethereum's is going to be reassert its primacy there.
00:41:08.610 - 00:41:09.370, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah.
00:41:09.482 - 00:41:23.374, Speaker A: That's a good way of putting it. And then you've got, like Solana with its. With sea level. And you're saying you've got cosmos with cosmosm and everything else that tendermint gives. And you're saying there could be room for something else, but it's really going to have to be differentiated, not just a clone.
00:41:23.534 - 00:41:57.754, Speaker E: Yeah, I think so. I think the market especially, just like what's going on in traditional markets, which you guys talk about on the pod all the time, I think it's kind of hard to get something to have momentum right now. So it really needs to stand out from a tech perspective. And I think, again, Solana really fast did that in certain ways. And maybe it's not Solana, maybe it's just the VM C level. Maybe someone figures out a way to put proof of history and make ETH's consensus a lot faster. But right now, it's really about the developers.
00:41:57.754 - 00:42:09.980, Speaker E: It's really about what's going on in that market, less so than the price action of all l one s because there's not this huge ball of money just kind of like flying around, chasing narratives, chasing totally the latest fork.
00:42:10.172 - 00:42:17.464, Speaker A: Walt Smith, Galaxy Research. Great to have you. Charles Yu from Galaxy Research. Welcome back to the show, my friend.
00:42:18.084 - 00:42:20.116, Speaker F: Hey at good to be back.
00:42:20.220 - 00:42:52.054, Speaker A: Let's go. So, Chuck, you follow a lot of stuff and produce a lot of great research for Galaxy. But two things I want to talk with you about today. As we sort of look back at 22 and go into 23 are stable coins, and then layered scaling, really primarily roll ups. But let's start with stables. It's been an interesting one this year for stables, obviously, given the algo stables that failed, but also shifts in the stablecoin landscape. From your perspective, what are the big stories in stablecoins in 22?
00:42:52.994 - 00:43:55.284, Speaker F: Yeah, I think, of course, at the top of everyone's mind is a certain algorithmic stable coin that had a spectacular rise and collapse. But after that, they were making this big pitch for the decentralized economy. It needs decentralized money, to be honest. I still think that mo still stands. But in the meantime, what we've seen in the wake of terrorist collapse is a rush towards sort of perceived to be safer stable coins. And these are names like USDC, which benefited at the expense of Tether USDT. We've seen tether FUD trending back and forth like every other month, really, just every time the market collapses, you see this renowned interest in bringing up more tether criticisms back to the forefront.
00:43:56.804 - 00:44:07.024, Speaker A: And then we also saw BUSD, which is issued by Paxos, the binance stablecoin. A pretty big rise for BUSD also this year.
00:44:08.244 - 00:44:49.112, Speaker F: Yeah, 100%. BUSD is one of the few stablecoins issued by an entity that's regulated by the NYDFs, Paxos. I think a lot of people typically mistake the two. They assume that because it's marketed as binance USD, that it's inherently riskier than certain other stable coins. But to be honest, because it's issued by Paxos, it's regulated by one of the most strict and stringent regulators out there. So, yeah, I definitely do think it's valid that they've become a lot more prominent this year.
00:44:49.208 - 00:45:04.004, Speaker A: So do you think there'll be a further flight to us regulated stablecoins, the USDCs, and I guess the bus in 23, or do you think tether maintains it's pretty important and big place in the space?
00:45:05.584 - 00:45:38.620, Speaker F: Yeah, well, I think it really depends on where all the trading volumes are for crypto in general. If you expect them to be on centralized exchanges, then 100%, I expect them to be decentralized stable coins, like USDC, like BUSD. But as you move further out into defi, into the decentralized economy, then we're going to be a lot more reliant on more, I guess, decentralized forms of money, I guess more crypto native stable coins out there.
00:45:38.772 - 00:45:57.074, Speaker A: Which ones are out there now? Obviously, Makerdao is still in existence. I kind of think of it a little bit as an on chain hedge fund now because they do all these random weird trades, many of them off chain. But what else is out there in terms of the decentralized stable coins now that terra is not there? Yeah.
00:45:57.114 - 00:46:27.434, Speaker F: So you got coins like Dai Frax, Mim, you have other algorithmic stable coins, or so called algorithmic names like USDD issued on TrON. And then there's a bunch of other platform native or platform preferred stable coins like issued by Team Kujira on Polkadot, USDN on waves or USN on near.
00:46:27.934 - 00:47:05.704, Speaker A: So that's an interesting, that's an interesting development, I guess. This platform native stablecoins, it's going to be a really interesting thing. I think the stablecoins currently are about 17% of the total crypto market cap. If we use the coinmarketcap or coingecko, just summing all of these ones, which obviously isn't the best way to do it, but even on a volume weighted basis, these are pretty important in crypto. I guess it'll be really interesting to see if they become very important outside crypto one day. I think a lot of people expect them to. And whether these are those, if they do and it's tether or circle, I think people will.
00:47:05.704 - 00:47:15.004, Speaker A: People might be kind of surprised if that's the case and not, say some crypto, some, sorry, traditional finance issued or government, even CBDC.
00:47:16.184 - 00:47:17.604, Speaker F: Yeah, 100%.
00:47:18.184 - 00:47:24.564, Speaker A: Can these cross the rubicon from crypto to traditional if, if that happens?
00:47:25.464 - 00:48:37.014, Speaker F: I mean, absolutely. Like, stable coins, like, to begin with, like, even before all the stable coin dynamics that we've seen today, stable coins were the tool that bridged the traditional and the crypto world together. And to be honest, I've kind of gone back and forth on maker and dai with their whole positioning within the crypto space, namely that this was the premier decentralized stablecoin out there. When I think about their real world initiative, real world asset initiatives basically lock in real world financial assets like real estate, corporate or government bonds to help balance the duration of assets against liabilities. This comes at the expense of decentralization and trust minimization. But as I think about it, like you've been saying, real world assets kind of have this important task of expanding crypto to the mainstream and can really strengthen the ties between the normal traditional world with crypto or web3. And so, yeah, I think one of the most important developments that we've seen come out of this is the reignation of the DaI savings rate.
00:48:37.014 - 00:49:12.856, Speaker F: Crypto is really missing a savings tool that pays a non zero yield on stablecoin holdings. And throughout this whole time, crypto has been pitched as a tool that provides competitive rates against traditional savings accounts. We can see that starting to take hold as dai delivers on this dai savings rate. So, yeah, but in my opinion, what maker really should do is commit to going down this route and to let an alternative stable coin go for the fully decentralized money title.
00:49:12.920 - 00:49:29.374, Speaker A: Whereas right now they've got the endgame plan, which is sort of back on the decentralization spectrum. But on the other hand, they've got this real world assets team and they've got the deals with Coinbase and others to invest their money. They're sort of trying still to live in both worlds, but they've got to commit to one.
00:49:30.114 - 00:49:31.346, Speaker F: Yeah, 100%.
00:49:31.450 - 00:50:05.594, Speaker A: Okay, let's transition. Chuck, you've talked a lot and done a lot of research on rollups, which I think most people believe, particularly of the ZK variety, but for now, of the optimistic variety, believe is sort of the future of layered scaling, no longer say payment channels or other attempts, but that people are, and there are two in particular that have a lot of TVL, right, optimism and arbitrum on and a lot of activity. What's your take on rollup so far this year? Or maybe those two specifically, am I right? Are those the two that matter right now?
00:50:06.694 - 00:50:08.234, Speaker F: Yeah, absolutely.
00:50:08.774 - 00:50:09.798, Speaker A: And they do matter.
00:50:09.886 - 00:50:55.508, Speaker F: Yeah. Yeah, 100%, in my opinion. Roll ups are kind of like stable coins because they make ethereum usable, like, just like stable coins make trading defi payments on blockchains more usable. Roll ups are the solution that kind of bring crypto to the masses in a usable and digestible manner. And I would say that they've been one of the few bright spots in crypto, especially over the second half of this year. And this really kicked off with optimism. Launching their airdrop towards the end of May, we saw about 250,000 eligible addresses, I guess, qualify for this airdrop.
00:50:55.508 - 00:51:42.264, Speaker F: And the average size of the airdrop came in at 800 op tokens, which was trading around like a dollar to $1.50. So a pretty sizable airdrop that got a lot of people hyped about using roll ups and blockchains in general. And this hype obviously translated to arbitrum, especially as they kicked off their own project Galaxy incentive campaign in June. And we saw that all this hype had kind of translated into a congestion on the blockchain that made things sort of unusable. So they took a pause in that whole campaign until the launch of a more usable blockchain.
00:51:43.684 - 00:51:59.754, Speaker A: And we're supposed to get some upgrades on Ethereum, supposedly that will make rollups even easier and cheaper. Right. Do you think that, do you think we'll see just a lot more growth in the use of rollups over the l one chain in 2023?
00:52:01.174 - 00:52:18.612, Speaker F: Yeah, I think that's where all the new growth is going to happen, especially as they form all these new integrations with different centralized exchanges, like direct withdrawals from Coinbase to arbitrum to optimism. Like, that's going to be huge.
00:52:18.788 - 00:52:24.788, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes it a lot easier for regular folks not having to bridge or anything like that. Yeah, right.
00:52:24.876 - 00:53:26.974, Speaker F: So avoiding bridging all together, getting all that potentially through your wallet, through your metamask. And, you know, one of the big criticisms that I've had about, well, ZK roll ups in general is just that they tend to sort of like, forward sell themselves. Like, you know, I've been hearing the same pitch from them, like, for the past three years, and at this point I'm really no longer holding my breath. But, you know, one of my main criticisms of ZK rollups was just that, like, they need to scale up tremendously. They need to see a ton of usage before they actually become more economical to use, especially against, like, optimistic roll ups. And so the longer that they take to really roll out to develop over time, although we are seeing a ton of promising potential uses through ZK EVM chains, I think it's going to be quite some time before we see ZK rollups really take over.
00:53:27.274 - 00:53:43.572, Speaker A: In the meantime, we've got the optimistic variety and they are being used. They're growing. So very interesting stuff. Still wondering if we can ever see roll ups on bitcoin. We've talked about that before on the podcast. Some changes would need to be made. I'm not holding my breath for that either.
00:53:43.572 - 00:53:55.504, Speaker A: But in the meantime, lots of interesting scaling work happening across the whole ecosystem. That's it. Charles Yu, Galaxy Research. Thank you, my friend. Saul Kadir from Galaxy Research. Welcome.
00:53:56.164 - 00:53:57.340, Speaker C: How's it going, Alex?
00:53:57.452 - 00:54:20.584, Speaker A: It's good, my friend. So again, we're doing this a little bit of a retrospective, and I think one of the things that you cover quite closely are nfTs. Course, NFTs had a huge 18 months, but when you step back and think about the last year, what are the big stories? Or where are we now in NFT world?
00:54:21.364 - 00:54:57.398, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a great question. I think maybe the best way to go about this is we can kind of just walk through the big stories, the big things that happened this year. And so if we rewind the clock, let's start with the. Earlier in this year, the big story was we were still kind of riding this high from the bull market and looks rare comes out. And it's kind of like the first marketplace to at scale test this idea of incentivizing people to trade with the token, with the looks token, and they kind of set the world on fire. They were probably the first real challenger to Opensea. Tons of people were using it.
00:54:57.398 - 00:55:45.362, Speaker C: Certainly a lot of wash trading was happening there, but they proved the concept. And then fast forward a couple months, you know, the big consolidation piece happened. Yuga labs picked up crypto punks and mebits. They seemed unstoppable at that point, and they rode that momentum into the other side mint, which in my view for this past year was the absolute peak of NFT mania. This is when volumes were the highest. This is when Yuga Labs, they raised half a billion dollars, $550 million from that one mint, from selling 55,000 plots of land at an average cost of $5,000. People were spending so much ETH to jump the queue for the mempool that in some cases they were actually spending more in gas than the actual cost of the plot.
00:55:45.498 - 00:55:46.002, Speaker A: Wow.
00:55:46.098 - 00:56:00.056, Speaker C: Just, just insane. And board apes themselves. The floor price was half a million dollars at that point. That was like the all time high for, for bored apes. So that was crazy. Absolutely.
00:56:00.200 - 00:56:01.364, Speaker A: You said that was April.
00:56:01.824 - 00:56:28.516, Speaker C: So this is like the very end of April, the very beginning of May. It was like that last weekend. And then even on the Solana side of NFTs, you know, d gods were pumping pretty hard. Everybody was pretty happy. Now we get into kind of like the beginning of the bear market, so to speak. And certainly nfts were no exception. Volumes started to go down as the token prices went down.
00:56:28.516 - 00:57:03.584, Speaker C: Axie and stepn those kind of hit the perfect storm of having really high issuance of the nfts and hitting the bear market. So both of those collapsed and we start skating into this kind of like cooler market bear cycle for nfts. But still, like in the summer, a lot of innovation happening. We see the birth of the first real amm for NFT trading, pseudo swap. And that model then got copied by some players on Solana. And JPeg came out in the summer. That was a lending protocol that had a stable coin associated with it.
00:57:03.584 - 00:57:41.658, Speaker C: We're seeing some financialization use cases heat up. Then as we skate into the fall, the big story then becomes, oh, there's these protocols like Sudaswap, which don't pay any royalties and which are way cheaper. It's only half a percent versus 2.5% for the platform fee. So folks started to realize, maybe we don't need to pay royalties at all. And that became the big question and huge pendulum swinging magic Eden originally had this concept of an enforceable royalty standard that they then pulled back. Then they went zero royalty in order to protect market share.
00:57:41.658 - 00:58:31.880, Speaker C: That's kind of what this question really boiled down to, is, do I care more about market share? Do we care more about the ethos of giving creators royalties on recurring sales? And that is still an issue that's being debated and being tested today. You know, OpenSea has reacted with their own standard, which is kind of a multi sig with other big players that doesn't force royalties. But even still, blur, for instance, has kind of a flexible approach to royalties. And if you look at the data, most of the trades on blur are not necessarily paying royalties. But again, the data that I'm citing, it's in contention. It's his influencer, NFT stats ETH. And they've come out in retaliation to what he was saying about how blur doesn't enforce royalties and said the data.
00:58:31.912 - 00:58:33.376, Speaker A: Is wrong or something. They've contested it.
00:58:33.400 - 00:59:38.534, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's still kind of like a, it's a hot issue, and that kind of actually segues into, like, the last two, I think, big stores of the year, which are marketplaces are innovating a blur, kind of came out of nowhere, when in fact, they've been building this trading oriented marketplace for a year now. Very hyper optimized UI for just trading use cases. That borrows a lot of principles from aggregators, one of which are both of which, the big ones, Gem and Genie, got acquired earlier this year by Uniswap and OpenSea. And then finally, I think the last kind of big story is we're seeing a ton of activity happening on Polygon. It started with Reddit when that kind of set the world on Fire with those PFP Reddit avatars, and some of them were hitting $20,000 USD floor. Starbucks started their odyssey pilot, and then most recently, we saw the former president Donald Trump issue a 45,000 collection on Polygon.
00:59:38.534 - 00:59:52.576, Speaker C: So now, if you look at the data, Polygon, NFTs are oftentimes breaking to the top ten in terms of volume and really competing with the top two, which are Ethan Solana. So it's been very interesting to watch.
00:59:52.600 - 01:00:08.824, Speaker A: All that, yeah, the Trump collectible cards, I think, was a very funny moment, which is just last week, the whole thing minted out 45,001 of the bigger collections, I would say. Right. Most are 10,000 or less.
01:00:08.984 - 01:00:09.576, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:00:09.680 - 01:00:14.604, Speaker A: And the floor, the current floor price is at least three x. The initial sale price.
01:00:14.904 - 01:00:16.056, Speaker C: That's right, that's right.
01:00:16.120 - 01:00:40.268, Speaker A: And it's the former president. So. So they made, um. Now whether or not he's making this money or, you know, they, on the website it says he licensed his likeness to another company, but that other company no one's ever heard of, um, so easily, you know, NFT int LLC or something. So, you know, whether or not he's getting the, the money directly or whether he was paid upfront for his likeness. And this other company now gets the money. Regardless of that, they made 4.4
01:00:40.268 - 01:00:49.504, Speaker A: million in the first 24 hours in primary sales and at least 150k in the first 24 hours on secondaries. Yeah, pretty, pretty amazing, to be honest.
01:00:50.284 - 01:01:00.020, Speaker C: Yeah. I'm surprised it did so much. I don't know. I'm surprised it sold out so quickly. I mean, it only took hours and it's a big collection to sell out.
01:01:00.212 - 01:01:20.444, Speaker A: So just real quick then. I mean, you know, where do we go? You know, NFTs are at like, I mean, basically volumes we haven't seen since before the bull market. There's the trade volumes on these Ethereum marketplaces, Ethereum based marketplaces. Do they come back? What's your 2023 outlook? Just generally?
01:01:21.744 - 01:02:02.644, Speaker C: Yeah, there's, I think, a few trends that I'm paying attention to. And so one you already brought up is marketplaces. They're still pretty healthy in terms of just protocol revenue. There's one of the few dapps that actually consistently generates revenue even in a bear market. And so I think they'll weather the storm and I think we'll see more innovation happening. The kind of ideas like the unbundling of opensea in some ways might see specific marketplaces start to gain traction over time. And also just paying attention to what Uniswap is doing and almost marrying the defi side with the NFT side in one place, I think that'll be really interesting to watch.
01:02:02.644 - 01:02:46.562, Speaker C: And then some other trends I'm paying attention to are, let's not sleep on Yuga labs. I mean, they just hired very senior executive at Blizzard to run point at Yuga Labs specifically because they're kind of doubling down on the other side. Vision, which is the tech demos, have been very impressive. I think it'll get released in 2023. And it might move the needle for that whole ecosystem, but it's important to remember I think it's compatible with any NFT collection. It might just bring a lot of people into the fold, so to speak, regardless of whether you need a UGO labs, NFT or apecoin or anything like that. I just think that product will be interesting just to watch as bringing a lot of people together.
01:02:46.618 - 01:02:49.210, Speaker A: And it's basically a game, right? I mean, that's.
01:02:49.402 - 01:02:51.930, Speaker C: That's the idea, yeah. It's like an open world game.
01:02:52.002 - 01:02:55.014, Speaker A: Everyone loves. Everyone loves open world video games.
01:02:55.874 - 01:03:17.960, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah. And it has proximity chat. It can support thousands of concurrent players. This is pretty cutting edge technology. I don't think a blizzard exec would go there without really understanding the long term vision. And then finally, kind of the last theme I'm paying attention to is the idea of dynamic nfts.
01:03:17.960 - 01:03:51.876, Speaker C: We saw earlier experiments in this with the likes of Backpack and X NFT standards. I think wallets will play like such a central role here, but you can have entire applications housed inside the NFT itself, have everything happen on chain and the wallet being that ultimate destination where most of the activity is happening. That seems to be like a trend that will continue to pick up steam in 2023. Maybe not necessarily has gone mainstream then, but I think a lot of builders are focusing on that and it seems to be very promising avenue.
01:03:51.940 - 01:04:05.818, Speaker A: Interesting. I have basically no idea what that means. So we will have you back, of course, and you will explain it to us in the new year. Sal Khadir from Galaxy Research. Thank you so much. Tyler Williams, Galaxy's head of public policy regulatory affairs. Welcome.
01:04:05.818 - 01:04:06.994, Speaker A: Welcome back to the show.
01:04:07.074 - 01:04:08.730, Speaker G: Thanks for having me, Alex, always a pleasure.
01:04:08.842 - 01:04:27.266, Speaker A: So a lot has happened in crypto, obviously, but a lot has happened in Washington as it relates to crypto in 2022. Either take a step back or as you think about this year, which is coming to a close, like what is the big story in Washington when it comes to policy and digital assets?
01:04:27.370 - 01:05:03.550, Speaker G: Yeah, I would say if I were doing a retrospective, which nicely coincides with when I joined Galaxy. So I started Galaxy in February of this year. So a lot has happened. It's been a busy eleven months. It's been eleven months when I think about where we were last year and sort of moving into the early start of this year. Last year we were coming on sort of the heels of the infrastructure debate in Washington and the broker fix, and that was when the crypto community really got engaged in Washington. They were very upset about the rules and the definitions that were being debated.
01:05:03.550 - 01:05:49.502, Speaker G: And there was an onslaught from the community calling on their elected officials trying to change things in Washington. And I think that's when people really got engaged and said, if we want to be a part of this debate, we have to hire people in DC. We have to spend money trying to affect the communications and educating people. And that's when this sort of education cycle began. So if you think that that started in early parts of 2022, then I think we've come quite a long way in terms of advancing thoughtful pieces of legislation. We've seen major packages come forth in a bipartisan way between Senators Lummis and Gillibrand. We've seen the Digital Commodity Consumer Protection act, the DCCPA.
01:05:49.502 - 01:06:59.998, Speaker G: We've seen a number of other pieces of legislation, whether it's ranking member McHenry and chair woman waters working on their stablecoin legislation. So we've seen a lot that's happened in a positive, progressive manner for the industry. But if you table all that and then you add in the blow ups and the things that have happened in space, whether it's celsius, three arrows, whether it's Luna, whatever it might be, FTX, yeah, we're going to get to that in a minute. So if you layer that in, it's affected the industry in their ability to project credibility to policymakers. And so it's a necessity to do some rehabilitation. And then when you layer on the FTX saga, because of how deep it penetrated and permeated Washington in the policy circles, in the political circles, people are still trying to wrap their heads around how to proceed moving forward and whether or not they need to re underwrite their belief system relative to the space. So we're seeing that quite a bit right now, and I think we'll see it in a little bit more in the early part of this year.
01:06:59.998 - 01:07:54.144, Speaker G: But I'm hopeful that policymakers are recognizing the necessity to solve big picture issues like how to regulate a dollar back stablecoin, how to solve the market structure issues, because we need to know and have, we need to have better rules of the road for what assets are, are not securities. People know that these are issues. And I think that they're becoming more cognizant that if they don't do something, it's going to continue to proliferate in other markets, which is exactly what ties back into what we've seen in some of the blowups. So that's where I think we are. That's where I think we're going. And I'm hopeful that this next year is going to be a more serious attempt to actually just solve a problem and work towards a point of execution, meaning getting something done from a regulatory or legislative path in a narrow way.
01:07:54.604 - 01:08:05.240, Speaker A: What do you think is the most likely, if you had to bet the first bill that comes out and is introduced, is it positive or negative, first of all, in the new Congress?
01:08:05.392 - 01:08:15.296, Speaker G: Well, I mean, I think you're going to see whenever a new Congress rolls over, all of the bills from the previous cycles sort of go into file number nine and they have to get reintroduced.
01:08:15.400 - 01:08:16.096, Speaker A: So I think we'll see.
01:08:16.120 - 01:08:26.360, Speaker G: The playbook is to reintroduce a lot of the things that have previously been done, whether it's the stablecoin legislation, whether or not it's the lummis drill brand package. So I think we'll see a bunch.
01:08:26.392 - 01:08:28.759, Speaker A: Of those reintroduced to get them back into the.
01:08:28.871 - 01:08:34.607, Speaker G: I think they'll all be. A lot of them will be reinduced. There's gonna be tweaks and things that happen around the.
01:08:34.655 - 01:08:49.283, Speaker A: Primarily the House bills, probably right. Because if the House flips to the House has flipped to republican control, then some of that stuff might be reintroduced with slightly different stuff. But, I mean, if the Senate is unchanged, you think there'll be major changes to DCCPA or.
01:08:50.263 - 01:09:10.808, Speaker G: I would imagine that there'll be substantive changes to all these big picture bills just because policymakers. It's an evolving process and you learn more as days go on. So there's always gonna be tweaks, and I would imagine that they would reintroduce those things and there would be substantive changes and they would try to advance those in some capacity.
01:09:10.856 - 01:09:46.178, Speaker A: And do you think we have, for example, seen a bipartisan bill that was negative from Senators Warren and Marshall? I say negative, but I would say restrictive. It actually has things that are totally impossible to enforce, let alone bad right in it. But do you think we're going to see more movement on industry? We'll call it progressive regulation for industry or regressive regulation for industry. Are the scales going to tip positive or negative for the crypto industry, do you think, if we get to a point, the wrong way to think about it?
01:09:46.186 - 01:10:20.492, Speaker G: I think that's the wrong way to think about it. If we get to a point of execution, meaning that a bill is going to the president's desk for signature or the market regulators are doing some specific thing, or hypothetically, like the OCC is going to release a way for fiat backed stable coins to be regulated under our existing banking laws. If we're in that point, it's going to be some mix of good and bad. But I think that's the best that we can hope for is that in a moment where we have something that's positive, we have to accept some of the negative.
01:10:20.588 - 01:10:23.572, Speaker A: Right? It's the art of the possible. Yeah. It's like not the art of don't.
01:10:23.588 - 01:10:25.388, Speaker G: Let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
