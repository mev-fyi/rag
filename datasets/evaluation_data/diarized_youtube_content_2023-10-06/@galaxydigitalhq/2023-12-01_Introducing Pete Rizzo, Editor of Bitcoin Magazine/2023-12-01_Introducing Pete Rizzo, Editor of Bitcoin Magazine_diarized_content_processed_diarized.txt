00:00:00.160 - 00:00:39.558, Speaker A: I can jump in there. So I think, one, bitcoin is a technology, but two, it's very obvious that bitcoin has a culture, and I think there hasn't really been enough research or analytical work on how that culture functions. So this was essentially an attempt at that. Essentially, I was trying to look at bitcoin as a sociological movement. You can class certain people as having certain attitudes towards things. Why is that a framework that's helpful? Well, bitcoin is a technology, and it's improving, but I don't think that it has essentially reached its goal. You can say that most of the participants within the bitcoin ecosystem are trying to improve it in some way, or think that it needs to grow or extend in other ways.
00:00:39.558 - 00:00:43.094, Speaker A: That's where you get into what is the bitcoin culture? Why do we have it, and how does it function?
