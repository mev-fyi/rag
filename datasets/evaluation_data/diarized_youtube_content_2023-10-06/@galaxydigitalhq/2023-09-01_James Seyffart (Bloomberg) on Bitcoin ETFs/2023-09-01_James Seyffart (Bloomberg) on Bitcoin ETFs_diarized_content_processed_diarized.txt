00:00:09.760 - 00:00:16.262, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. Yo, we're starting to see some bad.
00:00:16.318 - 00:00:18.454, Speaker B: Decisions get reversed and vacated.
00:00:18.534 - 00:01:00.154, Speaker A: Decimated. Preparing for rebirth. And now everyone is running in a race to be first. Do the timelines accelerate? Is that the way works? We'll talk with the expert, Bloomberg's James Seyffert, about the bitcoin ETF. How many they be left? Is it possible the commission is still ready to reject? Yo, it's 2023. I'm heady on the beat breaking levees with my flow see my enemies retreat yo, I'm deadly on the street like I'm speeding in my whip but no chance of roll cost in my spot when I dip, though I'm striking, igniting with my potent writing some call me Alex Thorne. Others say the bitcoin Viking although I'm institutional, I'm heady in my veins yo, we're talking revolution every day on galaxy brains.
00:01:00.154 - 00:01:27.294, Speaker A: As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of Mr. Wide research at Galaxy Digital. Thank you for listening to galaxy brains. We have a great show for you today. As I said, James Safer, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, is our guest.

00:01:54.478 - 00:01:55.838, Speaker C: Thanks for having me on, Alex.
00:01:55.966 - 00:01:56.302, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:01:56.358 - 00:02:35.526, Speaker B: Big news this week, something everyone's been waiting for. For several weeks, people like me have been auto refreshing. Uh, Pacer, the, the online, uh, docket search tool, waiting for a ruling in grayscale versus SEC. On Tuesday, August 29, the District, the DC core Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously in favor, three o ruling in favor of Grayscale. Um, we're going to talk with Bloomberg ETF intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffert after this, so we won't get into the procedural stuff around ETF's and the meaning of the ruling necessarily. But Bimnet, what was the reaction in bitcoin markets yesterday?
00:02:35.670 - 00:03:22.664, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I think the market started to price in a greater probability of an eventual approval of an ETF by the SEC. The price action supported that conclusion, with bitcoin going from 26,200 to a high of 28,200, a move of about seven to eight to 8%. Since then, we have retraced that move. And I think that's just a function of just expectations for this. ETF can only get so high. The odds were already pretty high in folks heads after Blackrock made that filing. But now that the SEC is definitively lost in court, I think that probably just nudged it a bit higher.
00:03:22.664 - 00:04:01.812, Speaker C: But it's really sort of at that critical point where everybody that's in this market is expecting an eventual approval. And so your risks were that that was the initial move. In addition, there's a lot of delta neutral trades that folks run. That when you had this bitcoin move happen, actually leads to kind of increased sell pressure. We can touch upon that later. But all in all, I think you had a move that was flushed out shorts. You had a tremendous amount of liquidations to the upside, but you haven't really seen follow through.
00:04:01.812 - 00:04:47.930, Speaker C: And I'd also like to highlight, normally it's spot up volume up in the crypto market, where if you get a five to 10% move in bitcoin, you typically see upside calls being more bit off from a vault perspective. But the long data stuff really didn't move that much in crypto. And so it just kind of shows that the market isn't really buying the fact that there's going to be follow through to this move. And I think it's important to highlight that this is happening in the context of equity markets that are trading incredibly well. This week, we did have a little bit of change to kind of our macro outlook, and that's kind of what's been causing broader risk to rally. But let me just pause there.
00:04:48.002 - 00:04:48.330, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:04:48.402 - 00:04:57.570, Speaker B: What was the change in macro? I have seen equities. I mean, they're near all time highs. Again, what is driving that move?
00:04:57.722 - 00:05:27.074, Speaker C: Yesterday you had a significant drop in job openings from around 9.4 million job openings to 8.8 million. Normally, job openings tend to lead other labor market metrics. People aren't going to get, people are going to stop hiring new people before they lay off existing people. It's the intuitive logic to it. But high level, you had a pretty big miss in labor market data.
00:05:27.074 - 00:06:22.054, Speaker C: For the first time in a really long time, that's been sort of the most anchored part of the economy. And what we know just from our own historical analysis is that labor market data tends to lag when you're going through a recession or a contraction in economic activity or that part of the business cycle. And so everybody's kind of been waiting for hints in the labor market, and you finally got it yesterday. And you've seen a little bit of follow through today with ADP coming in slightly, slightly softer at around 177,000 jobs added. So in the context of the Fed's response function, which Powell laid out pretty eloquently on Jackson Hole last week, on Friday, which is they're data dependent. If data stays hot, they'll probably hike a little bit more. If not, they're going to be less inclined to hike again.
00:06:22.054 - 00:07:08.936, Speaker C: And so the market's just taking its cues from the data, and you're seeing a little bit of a turn. And now we have PCE inflation data out tomorrow. In addition, you do have non farm payrolls on Friday as well. And so those are two big points that if you were to see a little bit more softening in that data, that'll cause a further rally in duration. In the US, a lot of the rally has been front end led. And so you have had that curve steepening still. But I would expect if you get soft data tomorrow with respect to PCE on a month end date like tomorrow, you could see a pretty significant bid in duration and now have a spillover into equity markets, and they'll probably continue to take us higher.
00:07:08.936 - 00:07:35.402, Speaker C: But again, do I think equity should be sitting at close to all time highs with valuations pretty elevated as well? Probably not. But ultimately, if the Fed is going to start being dovish, that's the biggest sign to be long risk assets. The way to trade markets in general is just to follow the central banks. I think that's what you have to do, and that should bode well for things like bitcoin and gold.
00:07:35.538 - 00:07:35.786, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:07:35.810 - 00:07:58.984, Speaker B: So the idea is that if the job openings lead unemployment, basically, that we see softening in the economy, which means the Fed's work is working and means inflation, they may be able to, you know, ease their hiking schedule sooner. Right. That's sort of the broad. The bad news is good news, quote unquote, for equities and risk assets.
00:07:59.104 - 00:08:47.184, Speaker C: Now, what makes things tricky, though, is there's already a significant level of cuts priced into the market. So what I like to look at is like the one year, one year interest rate forward and the two year, one year interest rate forward. And so basically, in a year from now, the one year ois or the one year average interest rate is expected to be around 4.17 basis points. And so to give you context, right now Fed funds sets at 533. And so you already have over 100 basis points of cuts there. And then when you get to kind of where your neutral rate assumptions are like the three year, one year, two year, one year points being around 360, that's implying over 200 basis points of cuts already.
00:08:47.184 - 00:09:51.750, Speaker C: And so what's really tough for me to think about and for the market in general is let's say we do start easing. How much can we actually ease before the risk of reigniting inflation becomes too great? If I told you if interest rates dropped by 200 basis points tomorrow, folks would start buying houses like crazy, folks would buy Nasdaq like crazy, and all of a sudden you would then be reigniting the exact same things that were causing the inflation to begin with. I just struggle. Even if you do think data is going to turn hard for the next six months, is that really sustainable given the structural elements that we have in our labor market and mortgage market? I'll give you an idea. Let's say we start to see some labor market metrics soften. The stuff structurally that's going on is just going to be so tough to overcome. Construction's one of the best examples.
00:09:51.750 - 00:10:59.340, Speaker C: I think for every ten retiring construction workers, there's only three or four filling in their place. And the metrics get worse as you get into further specializations, whether it's electricians, plumbers, but these specific trade type things, there's really a structure labor market shortage. And that's the reason why we've literally still had almost like two jobs per job applicant or per job seeker for the better part of the last year. And so there's still so many structural things in the labor market. In addition, everybody still has a mortgage sub 4% or sub five. And so it's going to be tough to overcome those things. And I think the rate market gets a little ahead of itself because it's so worried about, you know, the situation where the Fed's emergency cutting or something is blowing up and everybody's panicking because we did have something similar to that happen, you know, basically six months ago with the regional banking crisis and the market getting way ahead of itself in pricing and emergency cuts within the next meeting.
00:10:59.340 - 00:11:37.428, Speaker C: And so people are still scarred by what happened earlier this year in terms of when folks panic about markets they think the Fed's got to cut by like 100, 200 basis points at a time. And so I think that you just see a lot of cuts baked in because of that fear. But ultimately, I think this economy is super resilient. And so I think we're still going to be in this period of hire for longer, and we haven't been in that kind of period in a pretty long time. And so the consequences of it are still kind of a little unknown.
00:11:37.566 - 00:11:57.144, Speaker B: Yeah, it's fascinating. I fear the 1973 to 1985 inflation resurgence. And we know the Fed does as well. That was the Volcker era. And I think that really underpins a lot of Jay Powell's language. On hire for longer. That's a risk, right? That's where this comes from.
00:11:57.264 - 00:13:16.448, Speaker C: Absolutely. And now to throw in an interesting caveat to this is where this equation differs from the seventies and the Volk era is the magnitude of fiscal in the US as a percentage of GDP and just the outright levels, the amount of treasury supply that has to get absorbed over the next couple of years is outrageous. And it's not only that supply from the government, but from the banks, private markets. It's a lot. And the math behind the fiscal spending is not improving the portion of the fiscal budget that goes towards interest. And then you just keep running the math. You get to a point where it's like, is this really sustainable? Does the Fed have to cut to make sure that the government can properly finance itself? Or does the Fed have to start absorbing all of the issuance or the extra issuance of the government? And then you get into this weird MMT logic and if inflation becomes an issue, it's like, what does the Fed want to do? Do they want to help tackle the inflation issue or are we going to have a sound and resilient government that can fund itself?
00:13:16.496 - 00:13:16.680, Speaker D: Well.
00:13:16.712 - 00:13:24.512, Speaker C: And so it sets up some very intriguing setups that are very unique to what we've had in the past.
00:13:24.608 - 00:13:32.120, Speaker B: Yep, yep. Very interesting. Big questions ahead for markets as always, Bim net, my friend from Galaxy trading. Thank you so much.
00:13:32.232 - 00:13:33.004, Speaker D: Pleasure.
00:13:34.264 - 00:13:40.630, Speaker B: Let's go now to our guest, James Safer, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. James, thank you so much for coming on. Galaxy brains.
00:13:40.752 - 00:13:42.162, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm happy to be here.
00:13:42.298 - 00:14:27.678, Speaker B: James is probably well known to many people in the bitcoin and markets world because if not for the only reason that he has been covering the bitcoin ETF race for years at this point. And his tables, his Bloomberg tables that show the expected deadlines for various SEC decision points have become widely shared and relied upon by the industry. So given the news this week of Grayscale's loss at the DC Circuit Court of Appeal. Sorry, Grayscale's win at the DC Circuit Court, Court of Appeals against the SEC over the SEC's review of GBDC's conversion application, I thought it would be great to talk to James about this never ending, almost ten year long saga of the bitcoin ETF. James, I mean, just what are your initial impressions from the grayscale ruling?
00:14:27.806 - 00:15:14.710, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, as you mentioned, this has been something I've been covering for a very long time. And honestly, initially it felt like I was one of the very few people that really cared about it. There were a lot of ironically unique terminal clients, Bloomberg terminal clients, who cared about these grayscale trusts because of the premiums and discounts. And there was a lot of people that were not necessarily interested in bitcoin or ethereum or crypto, but like, in these arbitrage and unique special situations. So I was talking with a lot of clients on that, but for the most part, it was just me toiling away with how many people caring too much. But my initial thoughts are like, this was a complete repudiation of all of the SEC's arguments, right? This is, this was not just some, like, hand slap and this, you didn't do this. Right, or this some procedure was wrong.
00:15:14.710 - 00:15:35.882, Speaker D: This was a complete and utter repudiation with very strong language, saying basically that what the SEC was writing in their denial letters makes absolutely no sense, which is something I've been saying in my notes for the last couple years, because anyone trying to argue that the spot markets and futures markets aren't completely and utterly intertwined, just, it doesn't make sense to anyone who understands financial markets.
00:15:36.018 - 00:16:10.964, Speaker B: Yeah, the language was very harsh, and let's get into, like, some of those points, because the distinguishing between spot and futures was at the core of the fact that they continued to deny 2021 spot applications. But didn't, you know, prove those futures based applications which are trading today. Right. Which you see me futures, and they roll futures basically to gain exposure to bitcoin. A lot of people have talked about how those products are incredibly inefficient due to roll cost. Right. They constantly have to hold futures through expiry, buy new futures.
00:16:10.964 - 00:16:49.508, Speaker B: And I think if you look at some of those, I won't mention them by name, but if you look at them, they have actually significantly underperformed bitcoin this year, not egregiously, so you might say. And that's because they're inefficient products, which is why so many people have called for a spot based ETF, among other reasons. What did they say in the, you know, Judge Rao, Circuit court judge, I think a Trump appointee joined in this unanimous, unanimous decision of this three judge panel by a Carter and Obama appointee to sort of slap down the SEC's arguments. What did they say as far as that distinguishment, the intertwining between these, these markets, the futures in spot?
00:16:49.636 - 00:17:25.024, Speaker D: Yeah, so this all comes back to, essentially, the SEC had been denying any bitcoin ETF applications, and then Gensler basically prodded them to apply under the 1940 act, but before those 40 act applications were applied for, which is some of those ones you were talking about. And one thing I do want to point out is I've seen people quoting like 25 30% underperformance year to date. These things pay out dividends. So on a total return basis, it's more like seven or 8%. So, like you said, it's not egregious, it's not good, but it's an additional cost. But it's not the 25 30% that I've seen people in the crypto world try to try to spout. That's just a price return and doesn't include the dividend.
00:17:25.024 - 00:17:56.086, Speaker D: So that's one thing I would say to any of the listeners out there. And then, yeah, it comes back to that. So, basically, once there was application before that go under the same process, it's called a 19 B four process. It's the process that the spot bitcoin ETF's are applying under. It's the process that Grayscale tried to convert GBTC under. And it has all these deadlines for the SEC to issue approvals or denials, which is different from those 40 act products I was talking about. But there was two firms, Valkyrie and Tucrium, who had applied for this before those.
00:17:56.086 - 00:18:46.708, Speaker D: Before Gary gave that speech. And the SEC basically came up to a deadline in 2021 where they had to decide, or 2022 where they had to decide whether they were going to say the 1940 act and 33 act are sufficiently different, which, again, I think they would have lost in a court case if they made that argument, or they had to figure out a way to approve the 33 act futures ETF's under the same process. That spot is trying to be approved. And that's what they did. Basically, this whole thing came back to grayscale attacking the SEC under the Administrative Procedures act, saying that they did not treat like situations alike. And basically their argument was futures ETF's are alike to spot bitcoin ETF's. And basically, the court completely agreed with pretty much 100% of the things that Grayscale and Grayscale's lawyers were arguing in court and in their briefings.
00:18:46.836 - 00:19:21.132, Speaker B: Yeah, you guys said when you had issued a prediction of 70% likelihood that Grayscale would prevail in the suit following the oral arguments in March. And to your point, I mean, I'm reading from the opinion here now, the commission failed to adequately explain why it approved the listing of two bitcoin futures etps, but not Grayscale's proposed bitcoin ATP, in the absence of a coherent explanation, unlike regulatory treatment of like products, is unlawful. No coherent explanation given by the SEC. Right. On that point, they never actually put forth any justification for one and not the other.
00:19:21.228 - 00:19:43.492, Speaker D: So their justification kind of somewhat made sense. But like, they. My opinion, what I've been saying for years is that the SEC kind of lost the forest for the trees here. They were focused on minute details, but when you take a step back and you look at it, you're like, this doesn't hold up. It really just doesn't make sense. And yet, so during those rulings, we were obviously covering it live and trying to figure out what's happening. And I even said, we went into it.
00:19:43.492 - 00:20:13.100, Speaker D: We thought that with the Rao was going to cyber grayscale. Who wrote this opinion? Sri Srinivasan, who is the chief judge in the case, we thought was a possible take. And then going in, we didn't think Edwards would really side with Grayscale. But after listening to the arguments and the questions that the judges were asking, we were like, oh, my God, this could go 30. So that was my case. Like, I think they win two, one at the very least, and that they could go 30 in favor of Grayscale. So that's what happened basically that day.
00:20:13.100 - 00:20:39.916, Speaker D: We went to 70%. But before that, there were a lot of people out there telling, saying that this grayscale was filing a frivolous lawsuit, despite, like, the names that were filing this lawsuit that the lawyers that were on there. And one of the big things we had to keep pushing back on was like, this isn't frivolous. Like, that they have legit standing here, and now all those people, like, I'm tempted to go back and try to find the. Any comments or people saying things to me, talking about how this is a frivolous lawsuit has no chance, but I won't do that. I won't get that.
00:20:39.980 - 00:21:12.732, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I get it. I mean, and I recall when they. When Grayscale filed this suit last summer that there was a lot of people who said it was frivolous. And, you know, I. I try, in general, it's not my job specifically to do this, although sometimes people ask me to. I try not to prognosticate the outcomes of legal cases, because, as you know, they can be very tricky. And it's one thing I've said about the SEC's approach here, which is, you know, with all these litigation matters and enforcements kind of rolling the dice in court all over the place, where, sure, they could win, but they could also lose and see their power significantly curtailed.
00:21:12.732 - 00:21:46.900, Speaker B: It's a risky regulatory strategy for them. Let's talk about the surveillance agreements, because this has been a huge sticking point for various bitcoin deny ETF denials over the years. I think the standard the SEC is seeking is what? A regulated market of sufficient size with surveillance sharing agreements. And I guess was the argument in appro, was one of the arguments in approving the futures based ETF's that CME futures were a regulated market of sufficient size and they could surveil that and that therefore those get through. Was that what the SEC was saying?
00:21:47.082 - 00:22:20.744, Speaker D: Yeah. So it's funny, I said that the SEC kind of had to decide if they were going to prove, based on the difference between the 1933 act or 1940 act, or approve them. Right. And the way that they got around those rulings where they said they wanted us regulated market of significant size, which, to be clear, neither of those terms are fully, like, defined. Like, there's no, like, test to say what that fits regulated markets a little more clear. But significant size really isn't. And the SEC, like, took advantage of that and approving that two gram application, which is now hash decks as DeFi ETF, which, ironically enough, they are now in the spot, bitcoin ETF racing away.
00:22:20.744 - 00:22:51.140, Speaker D: But we'll go back to that. The reason, the way that they approved those under that 19 b four process I talked about was they basically said the CME market is regulated market. Yes, because it's regulated by the CFTC. But I don't think you would be able to find anyone in the crypto world that would be like, yeah, the CME market is a market of significant size for crypto derivatives or crypto trading or anything. And so the way the SEC got around that was saying that it's a regular. It's a market of significant size with respect to CME bitcoin futures market. So, basically, it was a market of significant size with respect to itself.
00:22:51.140 - 00:23:34.136, Speaker D: So, like, if that doesn't dictate, like the SEC, basically, what usually happens, and what we understand happens, is they make a decision, and then they go to the staff, and the staff has to back into that decision legally with whatever legal reasoning they could come up with. And that was the best defense they could come up with for why they were approving futures and not spot. So in that approval letter, which was cited multiple times in Raoul's ruling, basically, the SEC spent a ton of time saying, we're approving this because of x, y, and z, but not approving spot because of ABC, and spent an insane amount of time saying, what differentiates futures from spot and all of those things. Basically, Rao and the judge is completely shot down for lacking substance and cohesion. And what was the word? Reasoned decision making.
00:23:34.240 - 00:24:04.192, Speaker B: Yeah, reasoned decision making. Yeah, I'll read that quote real quick, because it's a great one. It says, the commission's unexplained discount counting of the obvious financial and mathematical relationship between spot and futures markets fall short of the standard for reasoned decision making, which is. I mean, that's a, you know, polite legalese way of saying, like, dude, like, there's nothing about this is reasonable that you. That you argued. Let's talk about what happens now to grayscale specifically, I think. Why don't you tell us? I mean, there was a.
00:24:04.192 - 00:24:22.092, Speaker B: You know, I think there was a lot of smart people yesterday, so we're recording on Wednesday, August 30. This all happened on Tuesday, August 29, and a lot of smart people, including yourself, were out on media saying, guys, this doesn't mean that GBC converts to an ETF, but what does it mean for GBTC?
00:24:22.268 - 00:24:49.730, Speaker D: So, really, all this is doing is it completely vacates the SEC's order for denying GBTC's conversion for the reasons the SEC gave. So, basically, that letter that they sent denying GBC's conversion, gone meaningless. Can't use those reasons again, or they need to add more substances. Proof or coherent reasoning, I guess you could say. So, essentially, all it does is it basically says, that doesn't work. So that's thrown out. What the next steps are, we're not really sure.
00:24:49.730 - 00:25:35.338, Speaker D: A lot of these court cases I've read in preparation for this, trying to figure out what's going to happen, the opinion kind of says, in this timeframe, XYz needs to happen, or whatever, there was none of that in this case, really. It's back in the SEC's hands. So I'm waiting to see what's going to happen. Now, as far as timeline goes, like I said, we don't know exactly what's going to happen, but within 45 days, we'll either have an answer or have a timeline, because the SEC has 45 days, which I believe puts them at October 13 from the decision to appeal for an en banc hearing, which is kind of like they're going to request to do an en banc hearing. The way this court works is it's a panel of judges. So three judges dictate what happened. Like I said, this was a unanimous decision, 30 for grayscale.
00:25:35.338 - 00:26:20.934, Speaker D: But if the SEC really wants, they could request this type of hearing, which basically says, we want all the judges on the court in this case, I think there's 17. To look at this and see if this three judge panels adjudicated it correctly. The odds of that happening, we think, are very slim. But that said, within 45 days, because that's the deadline for that, for filing for that, or asking for that, we'll know what happens next. But we really don't know what happens next. But we can talk into potential outcomes of what the SEC could do. One is obviously approve this conversion and all these other filings potentially, and the other is basically find a different way to deny these things if they're really going to be steadfast in their stances here against crypto and bitcoin specifically.
00:26:20.934 - 00:26:21.414, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:26:21.454 - 00:26:26.930, Speaker B: Can they go back and retroactively deny the futures ETF's that they already approved?
00:26:27.102 - 00:26:27.970, Speaker D: So, theoretically.
00:26:28.082 - 00:26:28.930, Speaker B: Contradiction?
00:26:29.042 - 00:26:58.106, Speaker D: Yeah. So as we talked about, like, a lot of the, most of this case basically was state like on the fact that you can't treat bitcoin futures ETF's and say their spot is subject to fraud and manipulation, and then say bitcoin futures aren't like that. Doesn't make any sense. So one way could be that the SEC basically revokes the approval of futures ETF's. We think that's rather unlikely. I mean, we just had a two x bitcoin futures ETF launch in June. We have a bunch of ETF's that have been around for years.
00:26:58.106 - 00:27:31.316, Speaker D: There's billions of dollars in them. Well, about a billion, I guess, I should say. And then also they're looking. They've accepted, basically, we're 90% confident that Ethereum futures ETF's are going to launch in October, based on things we've heard and seen from the SEC. So for that reason, we're skeptical of that path. But depending on how staunch Gensler and his political bosses want to be, that is certainly a possibility. But again, I would think that opens them up to another court case and potential loss, because I don't, I don't know how they would defend that.
00:27:31.316 - 00:27:35.236, Speaker D: And there's some other ways, too, that they could deny this. I think so.
00:27:35.300 - 00:28:09.580, Speaker B: And then you're saying 45 days, we're likely to figure out what the process is from the SEC because that's their timeline to request an in Bach hearing at the circuit court of Appeals in DC. So they either do that or they don't. And if they don't, they'll probably say, why is, is one of the ideas here that the SEC might, is one reason the SEC might not appeal? Because if they have in their mind that they're already sort of snowballing into likelihood of appealing other spot, bt, bit, bitcoin, ETF's, that just throwing GBDC into the queue is like, doesn't require them to do anything new. Is that how you're thinking about it?
00:28:09.652 - 00:28:42.062, Speaker D: So that's part of it. Also, this has become a political decision. If that's not evident to everyone, this has mostly become political. It's not really based on the facts before anyone. So part of it is like, we think that it will be politically advantageous for Gensler to spin this as a win for the crypto industry because of the things like the surveillance sharing agreement, like these other. Going after these other exchanges, including binance. Basically, they'll say, we're cleaning up the crypto industry.
00:28:42.062 - 00:29:13.668, Speaker D: We got Coinbase to come in and share their markets, and we put them with the big boys over at Nasdaq and Blackrock and these other huge firms in Vesco. They'll say, we've institutionalized. We brought the, the adults in the room. He can spin this as a win. Right? And also, if he does that and he approves these other applications, including grayscale, ultimately he could say, like, look, we may have lost on our reason, but, like, we just wanted a surveillance sharing agreement. Blackrock was the first one to do this. Now all these other filings have done it, and it satisfies what we were concerned about.
00:29:13.668 - 00:29:27.468, Speaker D: So, like, almost kind of, like, puts away some of the arguments that it, like, diminute it. Like, takes away from some of the sting of this, this grayscale victory. So, yeah, I'll stop there. I don't want to ramble on too much.
00:29:27.516 - 00:29:56.358, Speaker B: No, yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. And what is the. Just going back real quick to the spot versus futures, you point out the total return looks a lot better for the futures ETF's than just the price of the ETF's. Why then how monumental is the spot ETF then? If people can already access these future ones, futures based ones in their brokerage accounts and wherever on wealth platforms, why the spot ETF? Why is it such a big deal?
00:29:56.446 - 00:30:15.394, Speaker D: Yeah, we refer to it as the holy grail. You talked about futures, you have to roll them. So there's those costs that are adding up to seven to 8% a year. If you had to buy a fund and the cost was eight, 9% for you to hold it. Every single year, people are flipping out about GBTC's 2% fee. Rightfully so. It's rather high.
00:30:15.394 - 00:30:42.352, Speaker D: But thats just an additional cost that youre incurring because the futures market is in Contango. So youre selling the current month and buying the next month. And if that current month is a lower price than the next month, youre selling low and buying high. And thats just eating at your return. And the bigger that Contango is that steepness of the Contango, the more your costs are going to be. So that is the downside. The positive side is that these things track very closely, particularly over shorter time periods, days, weeks, even a month or two.
00:30:42.352 - 00:31:01.304, Speaker D: Um, they coat, they're going to track very closely. So they're very good for people doing tactical trades, um, day trading, things like that. But if you really want to trade, these things are extremely good. There is no problem with them. Honestly, a spot bitcoin probably wouldn't improve on that factor. The problem is these are rather expensive. Uh, they're like 80, 90 bps.
00:31:01.304 - 00:31:33.484, Speaker D: Right. Um, and then also the, the roll costs, those add up over the time, over the long term, and spot, we think is going to come in and really, uh, bring prices down. So for anyone who's an advisor, if you're an advisor, that's where they have like $30 trillion in the US. They manage people's money. If you're an advisor who have clients that want to hold crypto or do hold crypto on something like coinbase or gemini, what have you, there's a few factors here. One is if you want to give them exposure under your umbrella. So the advisors usually make a fee on the assets that they control.
00:31:33.484 - 00:32:06.984, Speaker D: So they'll make a fee, say you have a million dollars, their fee might be 1%. If somebody has like 100 grand in crypto, they would much rather have it an ETF under their umbrella with ease that they control and charge the fees for maintaining that. Also, an advisor just wants to know what's going on with their clients money, right. So they'll get the whole picture. So people, advisors like that aren't going to buy a futures ETF for the long term, right? That's just not going to happen. So some people argue like, well, why don't the advisors just put it into spot bitcoin? These guys, they don't want to deal with that. To be quite frank.
00:32:06.984 - 00:32:24.688, Speaker D: This is going to make it so easy for them. All the financial plumbing and the traditional financial markets will make it easier for them to click buy because they're used to ETF's. They prefer ETF's, they love ETF's and it's a proven structure that they know that their assets will be safe. There are stuff out there for people that can buy directly.
00:32:24.856 - 00:33:00.166, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it makes a lot of sense if we think about the caliber of, how would you characterize the maturity and caliber of both the newer issuing applicants and their applications in general? I mean, we've seen, obviously, you know, you started with the Winklevoss ETF in what, 2014 or something, and you've got 2013 Fidelity and Invesco, etcetera. But the filings have also evolved. Just, is that an imagination of the market? Is that a sign of institutional confidence in bitcoin overall? What is that a sign of, Preston?
00:33:00.190 - 00:33:27.714, Speaker D: I would say yes, but it's also a sign of basically the SEC had good reason for denying Gemini's application. Let's be frank there. For the first seven issue years of them denying these things, it made sense. There was a lot of issues with figuring out how pricing would work. The exchanges weren't really up to snuff with what regulators are used to dealing with in traditional financial worlds. But that changed after 2017. I'd say in the 2020 ish time range, 2018 time range, a lot of things got cleaned up.
00:33:27.714 - 00:34:02.818, Speaker D: Issuers who have been applying since 2017, some of these big issuers, like Banach, I think is the first real ETF issuer to try to do this. They've kind of chipped away at all of the SEC's concerns, like one by one. So in these applications, they're getting denied. But, like, they got denied for 20 reasons initially, and then it was, they got rid of, they solved three of them really well. So the SEC stopped worrying about it and they just kept chipping away at those things. And part of that is the SEC got very, got more comfortable in understanding these markets and also these applications, applicants. So Invesco, who's partnered with Galaxy, they're a big, huge financial firm.
00:34:02.818 - 00:34:32.960, Speaker D: You mentioned fidelity, you mentioned BlackRock. Then you have a bunch of other people like Bitwise and Valkyrie and Ark. 21 shares is partnered with Ark is partnered with 21 shares, who's a huge crypto ETF firm in Europe. So they'll all have their different strengths and weaknesses. Some of them are going to be like, we really know the crypto markets. We have a lot of experience there, will handle unique circumstances really well, like forks and what have you. Whereas these other big, huge firms were like, we're confident we can do this as well.
00:34:32.960 - 00:34:44.960, Speaker D: So there's two different angles coming at it from here. But what it really shows is that everyone is kind of focused in on this. I mean, we have eleven different firms who are really focused on trying to get spot bitcoin into an ETF clay.
00:34:44.992 - 00:35:08.716, Speaker B: Do you think it would cause like significant inflows or is there a bunch of latent demand? I think about GLD and when it launched and what it did for gold. How do you think about this? As a bullish narrative, but actual event too. It's not just a headline. Were an ETF to be approved. It comes with structural market changes. What do you think it would do for bitcoin?
00:35:08.900 - 00:35:40.286, Speaker D: Theres three things on here. Hopefully I can remember all of them while im talking. But the first is, I dont think itll be as big as GLD. GLD was the first real democratization to spot gold from your computer or your broker. It was the first way to really do that. Bitcoin, crypto, you can already do that on Coinbase or Gemini or strike or whatever platform you can think of people, if they really wanted exposure, they already have it. What I do think is that this signifies more, not that, oh my God, the herd is coming.
00:35:40.286 - 00:36:01.734, Speaker D: Institutions are going to pour tons of money here. Maybe a little bit. Maybe some institutions will get more comfortable and pour money in. But really it's more about the signal it sends from the SEC, the regulatory bodies. Like, it's kind of like things are getting more accepted. You get some of that regulatory clarity you hear everywhere. We got a little bit of that from the courts yesterday, basically saying the SEC is overstepping their bounds.
00:36:01.734 - 00:36:26.834, Speaker D: So it's more about the signal that it sends. The other part of this, the third point, which I'm glad I remembered all three, is you have grayscale, which is a unique situation here right now. It's trading at about a 19% discount last I checked. Like 20 minutes ago changing it was at 25 before the grayscale rolling went down to as low as 16% discount. Now it's back around 20. Who knows whats going to happen. So right now you cant touch that underlying bitcoin.
00:36:26.834 - 00:37:09.612, Speaker D: They have over 600,000 bitcoin in there. Once they convert to an ETF, one of the benefits is that discount will be gone. But part of the reason that discount will be gone is because you can access the underlying bitcoin. So what does that do for bitcoin on the market? One that could be forced selling because people want out now that they can get out at Nav. The other part of it is that are those people that want out, are they short? So if theyre short bitcoin and long grayscale, once this unlocking happens, then its actually a net buying opportunity or buying for bitcoin. So going back to 2020 or even 2018, most people were hedged when they held GBTC. There was a lot of institutions that I mentioned earlier on playing this as a special situation thing.
00:37:09.612 - 00:37:45.444, Speaker D: They were long the trust and short the underlying asset. That didnt work out so well for a lot of different people, including some names like 3 hours Capital and Blockfi, and even DCG, who's been a big holder. There's a lot of names that got burned pretty badly doing things like that with GBTC. So there's no way to know how many people are actually short bitcoin and long grayscale. So like Grayscale's massive size really could dictate what actually happens. It's not, I hear a lot of people talking about how this is nothing but bullish is going to create billions of dollars of inflows. And I think it's more complex than that.
00:37:45.444 - 00:37:49.564, Speaker D: And I think most people who've looked at this know that it's more complex than, than that. Yeah.
00:37:49.604 - 00:38:25.154, Speaker B: Fascinating. Let's talk some key dates, James, because I said, one of the things I think that has helped you become very well known in the bitcoin world is your incredibly useful and constantly updating charts and table of the deadlines. So let's talk deadlines. We've got one. This podcast comes out on Friday, September 1. I think that's the first set of deadlines for those June filings and refilings. And then maybe throw in a little bit more color about your expectations for likelihood of approval by the end of the year.
00:38:25.154 - 00:38:26.422, Speaker B: What's coming up.
00:38:26.518 - 00:39:00.134, Speaker D: Yeah, so we just put a note out this morning and said we're pegging the odds at 75% that we see approval this year. That's up from 65% before this decision dropped. And part of the reason we upped those is one obviously, decision happened. We were pretty confident that grayscale was going to win, but the unanimity. Unanimity, the unanimous nature of that, of that filing and the decisive language, the harsh language that they used to the SEC kind of made us jump even further. So that's why we went to 75%. We also went to about 95% by the end of 2024.
00:39:00.134 - 00:39:20.804, Speaker D: So we think it's going to happen. It's only a matter of time. And as you mentioned, those deadlines, the ones coming up, we have. The first one that comes up is deadline is bit wise. Their actual deadline is September 1. But then you also have Blackrock, Vaneck, wisdom tree, Invesco, and Galaxy fidelity. All are due on the second, which is a Saturday.
00:39:20.804 - 00:39:44.588, Speaker D: So the SEC will issue their orders on Friday. Almost certainly could come. It's a deadline, so it could come earlier. So theoretically, it's today's Wednesday, it could come tomorrow, but it's likely to come on Friday. And we're expecting delays on that front just because this happened. So this just happened. I don't think the SEC is going to turn around and approve these things immediately, but at the same time, I wouldn't put that completely out of the question.
00:39:44.588 - 00:40:24.064, Speaker D: I mean, if the SEC turns around and approves a bunch of these things while we're in this kind of gray zone with grayscale, it's kind of like a bit of a middle finger to grayscale as a way, like they're clapping back at them and be approving somebody else before they approve GBTC's conversion. But I still think that's rather unlikely. But so the way I'd mentioned before, that goes 45 days, 45 days, bunch of all these different deadlines, the ultimate final deadlines. Each of those deadlines, the first three, the SEC can delay, approve, or deny, and almost always they choose to delay. And then at the final deadline, they've always denied the final deadline. So the first one coming up is Ark and 21 shares. That's January 10 of 2024.
00:40:24.064 - 00:40:55.126, Speaker D: So that's part of the reason why we're confident that 2024 is going to happen. And then the rest are all in March of 2024, and then Global X actually filed there in April of 2024, and then hash decks is in May of 2024, and hash decks, his application was very unique, and I think the SEC is going to find it hard to actually deny that. But hashtags, his application would hold futures and spot. That said, for all those reasons, we're pretty confident it's going to happen in 24. And those are the dates we're watching.
00:40:55.230 - 00:41:09.272, Speaker B: So it sounds like you're 95% by the end of 2024. You're really talking about mid March is when the sort of, they all sort of conglomerate as a final deadline. And is that sort of your expectation that.
00:41:09.368 - 00:41:39.656, Speaker D: Yeah, so there's two real deadlines that I've been watching and I've said the last few months, it's. Right. Some sort of time period after the grayscale decision which just happened, the SEC is going to have to do something. We're not certain if they're going to make Grayscale fully reapply the 19 before. Is it basically going to set it right back to another deadline prior and say, like, all right, now we're going to take 60 days or 90 days or 45 days to come up with another order to on the grayscale ruling. So it's possible that this happens in Q four. Right.
00:41:39.656 - 00:42:27.240, Speaker D: And I think once they approve, if they approve Grayscale in Q four, they're going to approve everyone. Right. So then all of a sudden that goes into our 75% odds. The problem is, if we go into January 10 of 2024, the SEC, I can't imagine they're going to deny Arkin 21 shares, who has like, mostly the same things that BlackRock has in January of 2024. And then things will sufficiently change to approve all these other filings in March of 2024. If Ark and 21 shares get denied in January, those odds of 95 will get cut in half, maybe, probably more, just because that would be an insane move. That said, I mentioned hash decks, hash decks as application, basically, rather than going so ETF's, you can create a redeem with cash or usually with in kind creations.
00:42:27.240 - 00:42:52.964, Speaker D: So in this case, you could hand over bitcoin and get back shares of the ETF or vice versa. We think the SEC, and the SEC has hinted that they might have a problem with that based on worrying about manipulation and settlement of bitcoin, which, whatever. That's their argument. Right. But basically what hash decks has done is saying they're not going to get involved in that. All of our creations and redemptions of the ETF are going to be cash settled. So you're going to hand cash over and you'll get shares back and vice versa.
00:42:52.964 - 00:43:27.492, Speaker D: The way that they're going to get spot bitcoin exposure is they're going to do exchange for physical EFP trades, which basically means they're going to trade the futures for equivalent exposure of spots. So there's no really underlying going touching. An exchange that the SEC is worried about is subject to manipulation. There's no settlement risk. So basically it's like letting the futures, like instead of rolling them, it's just letting them convert into bitcoin. Bitcoin spot bitcoin, if you think about it. So even if they do deny these other projects, these other applications, I think the SEC will have a really hard time denying hashtags.
00:43:27.492 - 00:44:04.986, Speaker D: One way they could do it, potentially is, and I've been saying this also for months, is, and we didn't go back, I said there was another way that the SEC could deny grayscale. Still, besides revoking futures, focusing on something that doesn't have to do with futures, and one of those things is custody. So if they go after some of these custody rules, we've seen what the SEC will do with SAB 121, not allowing banks to hold any crypto, all these different things. So we know that the SEC is watching custody and might go after it on those realms. So if they really go after custody and some of these denial letters, then things will go downhill very quick on our odds. Yeah.
00:44:05.010 - 00:44:33.232, Speaker B: And they have, in addition to sab 121. Right. There's, there's movement on the custody rule itself. Right. There's a comment period or proposed rule, so. But you do still have, you know, non bank traditionals, like a fidelity, for example, that custody. And so I agree with you that there's, there's some, there's stuff there that most of the things the SEC has been focused on in crypto aren't really bitcoin specific, but yes, on custody, that's something that makes a lot of sense.
00:44:33.232 - 00:45:13.710, Speaker B: James, before we wrap, I mean, I think, what has it been like at Bloomberg covering this? I just a little bit get a little not too personal, but, you know, Bloomberg's, obviously, I'm a terminal user. I'm a big fan of Bloomberg overall. And, but it's, you know, it's, it's a widely used traditional financial tool, like, and, and Bloomberg's gotten really great at incorporating more cryptocurrency data and news and coverage. But have you been, have people looked at you with a strange eye while you covered this fascinating saga? What's it been like being inside the belly of traditional markets covering the bitcoin story?
00:45:13.822 - 00:45:41.808, Speaker D: Yeah. I'll give you a bit of a background. My first experience with this was my sophomore year in college. In 2011 or freshman year of college in 2011, I pushed bitcoin to the back of my mind, and I actually saw Kathie Wood giving a speech on her white paper for why bitcoin mattered in the fall of 2016. And thats when I first started diving in crypto for personal reasons. I was very interested in it. So basically, I went down the rabbit hole before I did it professionally.
00:45:41.808 - 00:46:08.944, Speaker D: And then I worked for Bloomberg Intelligence, and I reported two people. One of them was Mike McGlone, whos a commodity strategist. And he wanted to start covering crypto in 2017 in the heydays, because he wanted to call it a bull market. And we got, he was like, do you know anything? And I was like, I actually do. So basically, I worked with Mike McGlone on the commodity side and Eric Batunos on the ETF side. ETF's were mainly my background. And so that's why I sit in this perfect little overlap between crypto funds, crypto, ETF's, if you will.
00:46:08.944 - 00:46:36.694, Speaker D: So that's my background in covering. But when we first started doing this in 2017, we were just trying to get pricing data. We were trying to get any sort of data whatsoever. And the higher ups were just like, what are you doing? We're like shooting us down left and right. And it was funny, the news was covering it a little bit more. They were more accepting of it because all they cared about is really reads and getting things right and talking to people. But, like, from an actual product standpoint, Bloomberg hadn't bought in really at all.
00:46:36.694 - 00:47:02.714, Speaker D: That kind of changed in 2020 and 2021, which is funny. Like, the people that were shooting us down left and right, we were trying to get more data on the terminal so we could write to. It came back to us and we're like, oh, now we're interested. And blah, blah. We literally sent emails back like, you weren't interested a year ago. Like, what happened? Basically, something from the top came down. Bloomberg invested in a lot of crypto reporters who actually knew a decent amount about the markets.
00:47:02.714 - 00:47:37.622, Speaker D: So there's been a huge shift. We actually have now an analyst, he's based in Australia. His name is Jamie Coots, and he covers things from an on chain perspective and looks at all those metrics that you guys are very familiar with. So we actually have somebody in my department of Bloomberg Intelligence doing research on base chains and second layers and all these different things from a Bloomberg intelligence standpoint. So things have basically done a complete 180 from when we first started coming covering them in 2017. And now there's a whole group of us. I work closely with Elliot Stein, who's our litigation analyst.
00:47:37.622 - 00:48:12.528, Speaker D: So he's helped me a lot with this grayscale case. We have a guy, Nathan Dean, who's our regulatory guy and is very on top of what's happening with the crypto legislate varying levels of crypto legislation, whether it's stablecoin or anything like that. So there's like a whole group of us that are constantly, and then we have a bankruptcy lawyer who's covering a lot of these bankruptcies, whether it's FTX and blockfi, Voyager, all these different things. So it's become, as you've seen most people, you've been in space a long time. It's like the modern traditional media has kind of absorbed a lot of this. So has Bloomberg has done the same thing?
00:48:12.656 - 00:48:28.320, Speaker B: Yeah, it's been great. You guys have great coverage. You know, I follow Mike McGlone and Eric Baltunos and you and Elliot Stein. So.
