00:01:42.122 - 00:01:44.178, Speaker C: Galaxy Brains. First time I'm on the damn podcast.
00:01:44.226 - 00:01:44.466, Speaker D: It is.
00:01:44.490 - 00:01:44.986, Speaker B: It's the first time.
00:01:45.010 - 00:01:46.010, Speaker C: What took so long?
00:01:46.162 - 00:01:49.354, Speaker B: Well, we were waiting for you to ask us to come on. We were trying to get so famous.
00:01:49.394 - 00:01:50.178, Speaker E: You couldn't stay away.
00:01:50.226 - 00:01:51.626, Speaker B: But we're working on that still.
00:01:51.690 - 00:01:51.842, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:01:51.858 - 00:01:56.014, Speaker C: When I had a podcast, it was like, hoveled in my office. You got your own little studio.
00:01:56.474 - 00:02:09.004, Speaker B: Well, I didn't pay for it. I know Galaxy did. So thank you, Mike. The Fed raised rates 25 bps today and signaled further rate hikes. It seemed a little hawkish to me. What was your takeaway?
00:02:09.084 - 00:02:38.888, Speaker C: Listen, I think he was right up the middle. What was expected? He was very clear. We probably will have a credit contraction based on regional banks being under stress, and that is rate tightening. He broadly was saying. I was pretty hawkish three weeks ago at Humphrey Hawkins testify that we might have to go a lot more than we thought. That's off the table. They went 25, they might or might not go next meeting, and then they're going to pause.
00:02:38.888 - 00:03:00.384, Speaker C: And that's what the market is pricing. That's what their dots say now, the market's pricing, they're going to cut rates sooner than they're saying they are. But he gave a pretty clear indication that this banking crises will have a negative impact on the economy, and that is a tightening the market broadly has read it dovish.
00:03:00.504 - 00:03:00.760, Speaker D: Right.
00:03:00.792 - 00:03:21.912, Speaker C: Fixed income is a lot higher. Crypto traded really well beforehand, and it was a little by the rumor sell the fact. Remember, we've gone from 17,000 to 28, nine to high today. And so we've rolled over pretty hard. I think this is just a position washout like of us crypto guys. Everyone had kind of gone all in a little.
00:03:22.088 - 00:03:23.952, Speaker B: People went a little too far over their skis.
00:03:24.048 - 00:03:25.816, Speaker C: So this is a natural pullback.
00:03:25.960 - 00:03:30.932, Speaker B: I mean, right now I think we're trading at like 27 five. It's not like a massive retrace.
00:03:30.988 - 00:03:41.020, Speaker C: Yeah, but if you look at fixed income, it's traded 25 basis points higher. And so you would have thought, okay, there's ease is being priced in. Crypto would have normally done better with that other than had it front run it.
00:03:41.092 - 00:03:41.884, Speaker D: Yeah. Yeah.
00:03:41.924 - 00:03:49.820, Speaker B: So do you think so? It's not, the dot plot isn't much changed from the last time it saw. So they're sort of hanging in there. Is that what they're trying to signal?
00:03:49.892 - 00:04:19.812, Speaker C: I think they're basically saying 5% this year and then goes down to 3%. They see the economy and inflation slowing. We have a slow economy already, and they see it slowing more. The labor market's stubborn, and so the Fed is not ready to say they're going to cut rates this year. The market is, and we'll see who's true. Powell was very straightforward, though. He said, listen, we're just guessing.
00:04:19.812 - 00:04:56.608, Speaker C: We'll react to the data. And so if the data rolls and we'll see it's complicated and how fast the transmission is. Regional banks grow lending at around 16 17%. Money center banks grow lending at 1%. They don't lend Chase Manhattan, Citibank, they're not in the business of lending. They have consumer lending through credit cards, but not to businesses, personal real estate businesses. Regional banks stop lending because how do you build up your bank capital? The best way to build up bank capital is to stop lending.
00:04:56.736 - 00:04:57.336, Speaker D: Right. Right.
00:04:57.360 - 00:05:03.112, Speaker B: They've got the duration stuff. They can't just easily unload. That's the problem. The other stuff they have are loans. They can loan less.
00:05:03.208 - 00:05:04.604, Speaker C: Yeah, they loan less.
00:05:05.224 - 00:05:34.352, Speaker B: So would you say, like, broadly speaking, that part of the thing that gave the Fed the power, the comfort to continue? Cause a lot on the street, we're saying maybe a pause right now. I had talked to some smart people who said that anything other than a pause could be a massive policy blunder, was a quote. Somebody said to me, is it because they're out here saying, we're backstopping the banking system anyway? So, like, what's interesting is, so why.
00:05:34.368 - 00:06:15.826, Speaker C: Did the market roll over and even crypto roll over? During Powell's press conference, Yellen was quoted at her own press conference on something else saying, well, we're not going to actually raise the deposit insurance level at this point. And that was seen as really negative. I have no idea what the context of that was. I think there was a big school of thought among central bankers that if they paused, people would see it as, God, things are much worse than they are interesting. And you saw five or six central bankers on the tape, ex central bankers, saying that. And so I thought they should pause and say, hey, we got new information. We'll see what happens.
00:06:15.826 - 00:06:19.774, Speaker C: We got another meeting in six weeks. What's the big deal?
00:06:20.834 - 00:06:21.242, Speaker D: Right?
00:06:21.298 - 00:06:26.138, Speaker B: And they sort of step it down. They're still not, they didn't do 50, he did 25.
00:06:26.226 - 00:06:49.776, Speaker C: And they'll see what happens next month. My guess is this was the dovish pause that people were thinking about, and that's why fixed income reacted the way it did. I think stocks rolled over a little bit because Yellen spooked them. And again, stocks have bounced. Crypto hasn't. So stocks rolled over and then bounced. Crypto rolled over and has rolled over.
00:06:49.776 - 00:07:10.420, Speaker C: I just think that markets are always, prices are set on the margin. It's more buyers versus sellers. A lot of crypto people had bought and got very bulled up. We have to remember we still have a big headwind in government regulation. They are out to get us right now. It is fricking driving me crazy. It feels un american.
00:07:10.420 - 00:07:27.252, Speaker C: I've spent a lot of time in the last three days on phones with politicians, both Dems and Republicans, but, you know, they've got a banking crisis to worry about. They've got a debt ceiling showdown that I know clock is ticking.
00:07:27.308 - 00:07:33.024, Speaker B: We're in emergency measures or whatever they call right now, where they're moving money around in their pockets to pay for the government.
00:07:35.474 - 00:07:42.774, Speaker C: Not high on the priority of most congressmen or senators. There's some that really care about our industry, which is great.
00:07:45.154 - 00:07:45.722, Speaker D: But they got.
00:07:45.738 - 00:07:46.794, Speaker C: Bigger fish to fry right now.
00:07:46.834 - 00:08:02.054, Speaker B: Yeah, I've been banging the drum the last week and a half or so, ten days on bitcoin as a really interesting alternative to the banking system just because it was forged during the last financial crisis. The last banking crisis. What are your thoughts on this overall?
00:08:04.004 - 00:08:40.424, Speaker C: I don't think it's an alternative to moving money around in payments at this point. The reality is just the system isn't big enough for the amount of stuff that happens that says, I think it's a great report card on financial stewardship. One of the reasons bitcoin is rallying and crypto is rallying is because the Fed is going to get easier. We just took a balance sheet, was in the middle of QT, and did some QE. But if you look, we took back half of quantitative tightening in three days.
00:08:40.464 - 00:08:41.208, Speaker B: I saw that.
00:08:41.336 - 00:09:28.424, Speaker C: And bitcoin has always been a response to populism. Governments can't stop spending money, and they did the right thing bailing out the depositors. It cost money. And so as the market perceives, there's no way they're getting out of this giant 130% of debt to GDP without monetizing it. It just helps the narrative of bitcoin. Also, instant settlement. All the other parts of crypto, stable coins literally should be smiling right now, because how you move money around on the weekends and being able to move money offshore and all of that stuff, the crypto rails get highlighted at a time like this.
00:09:28.424 - 00:09:46.124, Speaker C: I think it's a fundamental right. People should be able to buy any asset they want to store their hard earned wealth. And so it's crazy. The government has tried to impede us from owning bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, but they are.
00:09:46.204 - 00:09:46.652, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:09:46.748 - 00:10:03.626, Speaker B: What gets you excited about the opportunity? I mean, obviously, 2022 was, I'm going to use a euphemism, it was a rocky year in markets. It was rocky in the crypto infrastructure space. Obviously, galaxy, we're still here building. What gets you excited about Galaxy and the opportunity for crypto?
00:10:03.690 - 00:10:58.326, Speaker C: Listen, the one thing I am positive at is that our firm, our people, and the whole industry is resilient as hell. I spent my life as a wrestler, and so we pride ourselves on being tough and resilient. But, man, crypto guys are maybe not as tough as wrestlers, but they're pretty damn tough, and they're creative and resilient. And so bitcoin has rallied from 17 to 28, despite Elizabeth Warren and Gary Gensler and regulators around the world trying to smash us, despite fraudsters like Sam Bankman Freed and Kyle Davies and zoo, whatever his name is, you know, defrauding people, despite Blockfi and Celsius and Genesis being poorly managed. Right. And so we had all kinds of crap. And despite all that, were higher in price.
00:10:58.326 - 00:11:22.342, Speaker C: Higher in price. Not because giant institutions are buying tons, because crypto is a community based project. Bitcoin, Ethereum have giant communities that believe in it and care about it. Retail is driving us back. There are institutional buyers. We've had hedge funds buying. Our job is to get institutions, our job at Galaxy, into the space.
00:11:22.342 - 00:11:26.942, Speaker C: But I want to give a shout out to the crypto degens.
00:11:27.038 - 00:11:28.702, Speaker B: Yeah, the stackers. The SAT stackers.
00:11:28.758 - 00:11:40.308, Speaker C: SAT stackers. The ogs. They are actually providing the floor and support. And I tell it to politicians all the time. I was like, what are you guys talking about? This is a populist movement.
00:11:40.446 - 00:11:40.672, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:11:40.688 - 00:11:41.736, Speaker B: These are your constituents.
00:11:41.800 - 00:11:42.264, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:11:42.384 - 00:11:50.872, Speaker B: Mike, thank you so much for joining Galaxy brains. Great to have you, and we'll talk to you again soon. Let's go to our guest, Thomas Pacquiao, good friend of mine. How are you doing, Thomas?
00:11:50.928 - 00:11:54.320, Speaker E: I'm doing fantastic. Thank you for having me. Great to be here. Yeah, great to see you.
00:11:54.352 - 00:11:54.587, Speaker D: Great to see you.
00:11:54.587 - 00:11:55.400, Speaker E: You look great in the orange.
00:11:55.472 - 00:12:05.760, Speaker B: I appreciate that. I love this sweatshirt. So, Thomas, among other things, which we'll get into. Owner proprietor of pub Key. Pub key, the best bar in New York and the only bitcoin bar.
00:12:05.912 - 00:12:10.494, Speaker E: It's a bitcoin cultural center embedded within a New York dive bar, which is.
00:12:10.534 - 00:12:12.254, Speaker B: And has excellent food, by the way.
00:12:12.294 - 00:12:12.558, Speaker D: Yes.
00:12:12.606 - 00:12:16.902, Speaker B: I think that's what really sets it apart in my mind. Even if you don't go there to eat, just knowing that it stands out.
00:12:16.958 - 00:12:17.742, Speaker D: Yeah, you should eat.
00:12:17.758 - 00:12:19.274, Speaker B: By the way, get the dirty dog.
00:12:19.614 - 00:12:25.006, Speaker E: Recently, we've been told that we have one of the best burgers in New York City and one of the worst cocktails in the city.
00:12:25.110 - 00:12:25.806, Speaker B: Which one is that?
00:12:25.870 - 00:12:26.470, Speaker E: It's the orange pill.
00:12:26.502 - 00:12:26.950, Speaker B: The orange pill?
00:12:26.982 - 00:12:35.630, Speaker E: The orange pill. Pleb. We're retooling. Or we're gonna lean into it being objectively the worst cocktail, because that'll be a novelty. It's kind of better. It's like, let me try out. What is it?
00:12:35.662 - 00:12:38.118, Speaker B: It's a high life with, like, grenadine or something. Or Campari.
00:12:38.206 - 00:12:45.154, Speaker E: It's a high life with a shot of Campari and, like, sweet vermouth. Why the fur move? I don't like it.
00:12:45.894 - 00:12:51.366, Speaker B: But if you order the orange pill, you get a free dirty dog. They got great hot dogs there. Or at least that's what my sweatshirt.
00:12:51.390 - 00:13:00.674, Speaker E: Says on the back. Yeah, we haven't actualized that promotion yet, but it does say that in the bathroom. Nobody's come out and said, like, you owe me a dirty dog.
00:13:02.014 - 00:13:13.076, Speaker B: Great place near Washington Square park. Encourage everyone to check it out. And I think people who watch our YouTube version of this show will see that. I've actually worn the pub key paraphernalia sweatshirts it before, and I'm wearing one now.
00:13:13.100 - 00:13:14.876, Speaker E: So we appreciate you very much.
00:13:14.980 - 00:13:24.460, Speaker B: I recommend it highly. But let's talk about. We'll talk about pub key and what your plans are for pubkey, what you've done so far beyond simply just a dive bar. Cultural congregation center.
00:13:24.532 - 00:13:25.144, Speaker E: Sure.
00:13:25.604 - 00:13:26.860, Speaker B: And it is a good bar.
00:13:26.972 - 00:13:27.476, Speaker E: Thank you.
00:13:27.540 - 00:13:35.748, Speaker B: But let's get into some other stuff. You can give me your history in bitcoin and I'll just set the stage here with. I met Thomas. Thomas was. You're a lawyer?
00:13:35.836 - 00:13:38.744, Speaker E: Actually, technically, recovering. Recovering, yeah. Thomas.
00:13:40.684 - 00:13:51.824, Speaker B: Worked at Fidelity's bitcoin and blockchain incubator even before. Well, I was at Fidelity, but before I actually worked in that group. That's how I met you. What brought you there?
00:13:52.244 - 00:14:08.708, Speaker E: So, yeah, in a previous life, I actually used to work down here at a law firm called Cadwallader. They're a couple buildings away. Swap and derivative capital markets. Stuff off tick agreements, long term, like sales contracts. Real sexy stuff. Isdas. Yeah, Isdas.
00:14:08.708 - 00:14:09.724, Speaker E: Isdis, to be precise.
00:14:09.764 - 00:14:10.744, Speaker B: Love the IsDa.
00:14:11.124 - 00:14:51.200, Speaker E: So I was part of that class of bitcoin late 2012 or early 2013 that were sort of like rescue dogs. Like, not really in it for the libertarian stuff or the Silk Road, but, like, that's a lot more exciting than what I do on a daily basis. So fell down the rabbit hole, like, from there on out, bounced around the space a little bit, went back to NYU, got a master's in finance, wrote a bitcoin thesis on merchant adoption. Whether or not that was a viable use case, it wasn't. Joined a startup called Digital Asset holdings, which in ancient, ancient history was a bitcoin company. Then it became sort of distributed ledger technology. Wasn't really in it for that.
00:14:51.200 - 00:14:54.884, Speaker E: And that's when I joined fidelity. So. Late 2015.
00:14:55.264 - 00:14:55.616, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:14:55.640 - 00:15:01.152, Speaker B: So that was early days in Fidelity's formal exploration of bitcoin and blockchain technology.
00:15:01.288 - 00:15:02.672, Speaker E: It was the bitcoin incubator at the.
00:15:02.688 - 00:15:04.992, Speaker B: Time, and then it was rebranded to the blockchain incubator.
00:15:05.008 - 00:15:08.632, Speaker E: The blockchain, yeah. That was something that followed me for a little while, so I felt cursed.
00:15:08.808 - 00:15:22.450, Speaker B: So later I worked as director of blockchain research, actually technically adjacent to the blockchain incubator, but in the same department. So you were, what did you do at the blockchain incubator? The bitcoin incubator.
00:15:22.522 - 00:16:07.374, Speaker E: So I was in like a flex role between, like, legal risk and compliance, leveraging sort of the prior background in the law, but also, I think, like Kanitsky, like David Kanitsky and I were two of the first, I guess, people with a background in bitcoin. So we were hired as like, subject matter experts. Got it. I think on a daily basis I worked on a range of products, like the mining project, Fidelity charitable, the early iterations of what eventually became Fidelity digital asset services. So the early architecture of the custody and exchange platform. But on a daily basis, it was really sort of neutralizing legal risk and compliance threats to the existential nature of the bitcoin incubator.
00:16:07.454 - 00:16:07.896, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:16:07.990 - 00:16:32.564, Speaker E: So for a while there, I would go in with a paper wallet, $5 worth of bitcoin on a paper wallet, and build a transaction. Just start from the beginning. And I had a pretty good success. Conversion. Yeah, I love that. I wrote a blog, like the first, I guess, internal bitcoin blog called the Bitstillery with someone, Brittany Hamtl at the time. It was fun.
00:16:32.644 - 00:16:44.088, Speaker B: I think I remember reading that. And I later, I don't think if any fidelity people are reading nuked, that internal social media platform, it was called Ribbit at the time. But if it is nuked, go find it.
00:16:44.136 - 00:16:47.336, Speaker E: The bitstillery, it was extraordinarily difficult to publish on.
00:16:47.480 - 00:16:48.552, Speaker B: It was not a good platform.
00:16:48.608 - 00:16:55.684, Speaker E: It was not easy. It was fun, though. I was quoting like Mirchelle Papashu at the time, like trilemma rip.
00:16:56.104 - 00:17:02.084, Speaker B: So after fidelity, what have you been doing in bitcoin in general?
00:17:02.504 - 00:17:39.736, Speaker E: Started a private fund called Hodl Capital, mostly a bitcoin fund. We were looking at, I would say, altcoin opportunities, really. So things that had either economic or technical vulnerabilities that we could structure trades against. Short lived, not easy to short, I would say shitcoins. In 2018 or so, we started to focus on the flared methane gas utilization for bitcoin mining operations. So we basically pivoted completely to mining and hashrate market infrastructure developments. That's what we've been focused on ever since sunset.
00:17:39.736 - 00:18:03.712, Speaker E: Hodl Capital started a new company called Hash Function and hash function is building out risk management products for mining operations, helping accelerate the development of hashrate market infrastructure. And I've come full circle because it's back to the swap and derivatives, which is good because I think they're really useful and impactful. They have a lot of potential for miners. But I'm conflicted about it. About the IsDas again.
00:18:03.808 - 00:18:04.016, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:18:04.040 - 00:18:12.312, Speaker B: So let's talk about. Let's go first on the hashrate derivatives and market infrastructure. Then I want to talk about flare gas tube, because that's a really interesting topic.
00:18:12.368 - 00:18:12.964, Speaker E: Sure.
00:18:14.344 - 00:18:23.080, Speaker B: What is the idea here that miners are inherently long bitcoin? That there's some hedging they can do? Or is it their. What are they, long asics? They're long hash, yeah.
00:18:23.112 - 00:18:25.520, Speaker E: Their short hash rate. Short hash rate, short hash rate.
00:18:25.552 - 00:18:26.288, Speaker B: Explain it to me.
00:18:26.376 - 00:18:53.190, Speaker E: So everything on the cost side is denominated in dollars or the local currency. Like that's the real world. You know, paying for electricity, building a data center, paying overhead, sourcing the equipment, keeping the equipment happy and functional. Everything on the revenue side, once you're up and hashing, is denominated in bitcoin. Really. And there's really no way to hedge out. There are some rudimentary ways to hedge out some of the volatility risks embedded within AShrae, but it's got a long way to go.
00:18:53.190 - 00:19:27.212, Speaker E: And optimizing the revenue side of the equation, I think, is going to become increasingly important for miners of all shapes and sizes, public, private, on grid, off grid. And it's been, I would say, underdeveloped over the last however many years for a number of reasons. The main one being the main catalyst here that actually accelerated this was the China ban, because when you have a lot of the equipment and collateral sitting in China, very difficult to post that against a forward contract or a swap or something like that.
00:19:27.228 - 00:19:27.836, Speaker B: That's collateral.
00:19:27.900 - 00:19:28.620, Speaker E: Yeah, exactly.
00:19:28.692 - 00:19:39.106, Speaker B: Yeah. So what does the two sided market look like for these instruments that need to exist? I mean, which side are the miners taking and who's taking the other side?
00:19:39.210 - 00:20:17.902, Speaker E: Miners want to be able to lock in. So, look, let's take difficulty. Difficulty is one of the volatility components embedded within hashrate. Miners want to be able to protect their pro rata share of expected rewards going forward. So one way they do that is they use a mining pool that deals with variance risk. If a mining operation is not growing at the rate of growth of the cumulative hashrate of the total network, they become diluted over there. They're getting diluted on their expected rewards, on a per block basis to lock that in the funding mechanisms for that debt facilities.
00:20:17.902 - 00:21:06.448, Speaker E: Based on what's happened over the last year and a half or so, most debt facilities to most miners are closed off until we sort out a lot of the, I would say, bad debt that's in the system. Block five, rest in peace, Celsius recipes. But as that gets sorted out, I think some debt facilities will continue to open up a little bit. Selling equity, not terribly attractive to miners. They want the bitcoin rewards, ultimately. So you're really sort of stuck, or you're left with selling production forward, which is how a lot of oil and gas exploration projects, precious metal projects, that's how they finance streaming, you know, royalty contracts, things like that. But embedded within these contracts are some insufficient, like metrics, so to speak.
00:21:06.448 - 00:21:46.764, Speaker E: So, you know, pricing hash rate forward, very difficult. One difficulty adjustment, let alone, let's say like a year's worth of cumulative adjustments next to impossible to price. So you're not going to find a buyer for that. But the miners want to be able to lock that in so that they can protect. So there's a long winded way of saying there's a lot of work to be done on the infrastructure side to build these products out. We've seen some rudimentary derivative products take shape, but we don't have a liquid and robust spot market for a hash rate yet. That would be bedrock for a lot of other really interesting and impactful risk management products and services.
00:21:46.924 - 00:22:15.058, Speaker B: And we're getting closer to getting there. Yeah, you guys and others are making progress on this because I've been hearing about various types of hashrate derivatives now for years. The, I guess I was going to say the supply side, the miners, right. The people that create the hash rate want this. That makes total sense to me. And the question was always, well, who's taking the other side of that bet so that there can be a market? And I guess we haven't come up with great answers, great products, I guess that can make sense for it.
00:22:15.106 - 00:22:56.074, Speaker E: Hodlers. I think the ability to look at streaming hashrate as a DCA acquisition strategy, where you get alongside miners and you get to enjoy some of the economics of the profit margin of a mining operation. There are really interesting projects out there. Full disclosure, I'm an investor and an advisor to Luxor technologies mining pool out of Seattle, Washington. That does a lot of really fantastic work across the entire hashrate stack. They've been building out non deliverable forwards and futures and some physically settled products. We're also seeing great work out of the brains team.
00:22:56.074 - 00:23:18.990, Speaker E: I know we have a New York broker dealer, Bituda, that's been working with some of these products for a long time. Galaxy Nidig. There's a lot of interest here, but there are, I think, a lot of different stakeholders that need to come together to look at these things. So hash function would be more of a buy side operator. Cause we wanna build that bitcoin treasury, and these products are a good way to do that.
00:23:19.062 - 00:23:23.982, Speaker B: Super interesting. And then let's talk about pub key a bit. Cause it's not just a bar.
00:23:24.038 - 00:23:24.702, Speaker E: It's more fun.
00:23:24.798 - 00:23:25.054, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:23:25.094 - 00:23:28.314, Speaker B: And you had financial derivatives. Now let's talk about the bar.
00:23:29.134 - 00:23:30.790, Speaker E: Let's show some range here.
00:23:30.982 - 00:23:55.302, Speaker B: But two things, I think, that stand out beyond the fact that it's a really cool establishment and a great place to grab a drink with. The bitcoin community in New York are the events that you guys have been hosting and also any expansion plans, because we are seeing, by the way, across the country and even perhaps the world, but certainly across the country, some. Some really interesting physical locations pop up.
00:23:55.318 - 00:23:55.446, Speaker D: Right.
00:23:55.470 - 00:23:58.902, Speaker B: You've got. In Nashville, you've got. What's it called?
00:23:58.958 - 00:23:59.542, Speaker E: Bitcoin Park.
00:23:59.598 - 00:24:00.294, Speaker B: Bitcoin Park.
00:24:00.374 - 00:24:02.366, Speaker E: Rod and Matt have done a fantastic job.
00:24:02.390 - 00:24:08.326, Speaker B: It was awesome. You and I were both there for their mining conference a couple, like, maybe several weeks ago at this .2 months ago.
00:24:08.390 - 00:24:08.966, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:24:09.110 - 00:24:11.974, Speaker B: And then you've got. The guys in Austin also have the bitcoin commons.
00:24:12.054 - 00:24:28.394, Speaker E: Yeah, also pleb lab. Where's that? Pleb labs in Austin. I haven't been there yet, but, yeah, Parker Unchained capital have done a fantastic job with the Commons. You know, they host, you know, bit devs. Actually just got back from there last week. They did the bitcoin takeover during south by Southwest.
00:24:28.434 - 00:24:28.986, Speaker B: Is awesome.
00:24:29.050 - 00:24:33.274, Speaker E: Yeah, it's great. You get to bop between, you know, some music and some bitcoin. What's not to like? I know.
00:24:33.314 - 00:24:33.490, Speaker D: So.
00:24:33.522 - 00:24:44.410, Speaker B: And then you've got key now in New York, which I think, you know, it. You know, it's not. I guess the right setting hasn't been maybe for bit devs yet, but the bit devs crew all rolls up there now.
00:24:44.562 - 00:25:05.444, Speaker E: Yeah, we have to have to party. We're a little bit small. So capacity. The bars, like, it's a sizable bar, especially for the West Village. Our capacity is like 120. But Jay, every single time I talk about pub key, I have to thank Jay for all of the work that he's done with bitdevs over the years. And Galaxy has been a huge supporter of bitdevs and cultivating that community.
00:25:05.444 - 00:25:18.246, Speaker E: And then from my perspective, Pubkey really is setting out to support that and build that back because COVID was pretty destructive, I think, towards the bitcoin community here in New York.
00:25:18.320 - 00:25:18.570, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:25:18.602 - 00:25:41.210, Speaker B: And you've done. You've got an event space, though, behind through the bar, really literally. It can be tables or chairs. You've done a comedy show that I was there for. You were on Peter McCormack's podcast, which you recorded there, right? And others when Peter was in New York, recently recorded there. You've done bitcoin mining meetups there. You did an ordinals meetup.
00:25:41.402 - 00:26:15.704, Speaker E: So it's every Monday we have something. So on a monthly basis, we'll have a mining meetup. On a monthly basis, we'll have a lightning meetup. And we have something called the mystery Bag, which is a quarterly basis, we'll do regulatory arts and culture in bitcoin and macroeconomics, that's been going well. And then a friend of mine and I host something that used to be called shitcoin chicanery. And now it's called, I guess we're talking about. And that's where we get to take a slightly more technical view and point out sort of the differentiation between bitcoin and other projects.
00:26:15.704 - 00:26:20.008, Speaker E: So, like, maybe we'll dive into, like, aptos or like, God knows what.
00:26:20.056 - 00:26:29.120, Speaker B: Yeah, I love that. And so, like, in New York or generally, though, you know, what's the sort of the future hold, you think, for the pubke brand and experience?
00:26:29.312 - 00:26:48.386, Speaker E: So we're gonna need a little bit more time. We took the floor above pub key as well. And that's going to be kind of like a coworking space, but more of like a clubhouse for bitcoiners that don't necessarily have a base of operations here in New York. Maybe they're coming through for fundraising or marketing purposes. They're able to leverage that location and.
00:26:48.450 - 00:26:55.234, Speaker B: Have that base of operations work there. So a little bit in the vein of like bitcoin park or bitcoin commons in that sense.
00:26:55.314 - 00:26:56.218, Speaker E: Yeah, for sure.
00:26:56.266 - 00:26:56.682, Speaker B: Love that.
00:26:56.738 - 00:27:08.786, Speaker E: For sure. And then once we, you know, once we have the foundation, the plan is to open up to other cities. We have a short list. We have, I think, five cities. Are you ready to finalist?
00:27:08.850 - 00:27:11.378, Speaker B: Name any of your finalists? Or maybe we have to have you back.
00:27:11.466 - 00:27:23.814, Speaker E: It's very much. Definitely have me back. I don't want to get, like, too committed. I'm pretty sure I have a good sense of where we're going to go next. The team has a good sense, not just me, at pub key. There's a really fantastic.
00:27:24.274 - 00:27:24.914, Speaker D: There is.
00:27:24.994 - 00:27:33.634, Speaker E: We have about, like, 2025 people now. Wow. Yeah. It's intense hospitality. I have no background whatsoever in hospitality and. Oh, my God.
00:27:33.714 - 00:27:42.542, Speaker B: Well, I tell you, I mean, I have a strong background in going to places that are hospitable to me, and I can tell you that pub key is very hospitable. So you're doing something right.
00:27:42.598 - 00:27:52.390, Speaker E: Thank you. I appreciate it. But no, the idea is. So we're going to have a number of different content touch points. So there's going to be microphones up at the bar in the back. You can think of it like microphones.
00:27:52.422 - 00:27:52.958, Speaker B: At the bar?
00:27:53.046 - 00:28:03.198, Speaker E: At the bar. Like, for, like, quick hits, TikToks. Like, if there's an conversation, somebody has a question about bitcoin, somebody behind the bar can also showcase the things that we're doing at pub key.
00:28:03.246 - 00:28:03.710, Speaker B: Cool.
00:28:03.822 - 00:28:24.918, Speaker E: In the back, that's going to be like a comedy club that's already, like the comedy club. Small, like, jazz venue. Like, people are able to come see, like, a presentation or that mining meetup, and then upstairs will be more like, you know, a studio setting. And we want that to be a touch point for each one of the locations. And the connectivity for pub keys is going to be that global layer. Right. That's like.
00:28:24.918 - 00:28:58.366, Speaker E: That's the bitcoin conversation that's happening. And then at a more granular level, each pub key should be representative of that location. So this is a classic west village, New York dive bar. If it were to be in London, it should be a classic english pub and do what is done well there. Do the best you can. Everything should be better than it ought to be at the bar, I guess. But that connective tissue is really bitcoin and the media side of things.
00:28:58.430 - 00:29:13.606, Speaker B: What does it say to you about the state of the bitcoin adoption cycle that, like, this is even an idea that's possible or that you see it in Nashville and Austin and, like, it seems to be happening, like, especially in a bear market. I mean, is that honey badgers? Pretty incredible.
00:29:13.710 - 00:29:27.022, Speaker E: The honey badgers, completely unfazed. I mean, when FTX fell apart, we had a lot of folks just gather there because, like, you know, there are a lot of, like, crypto folks that were, you know, impacted by that, and they came in for, you know, a beer.
00:29:27.078 - 00:29:30.398, Speaker B: It's literally the flight to safety commiserate, by the way. Can I get a flight?
00:29:30.446 - 00:29:33.782, Speaker E: You know? Yeah, yeah. The flight to safety would be actually.
00:29:33.958 - 00:29:37.274, Speaker B: Maybe you should make one, dude, if you guys start doing flights.
00:29:38.854 - 00:29:49.086, Speaker E: But, yeah, I mean, we've seen that through the bear market, and we're also starting to see people come in and throw some high fives. Now that we've rebounded a little bit, vibes are strong, and getting that, in.
00:29:49.110 - 00:29:55.910, Speaker B: Good times, it's a place to celebrate. In bad times, it's a place to commiserate. But either way, the community feels very strong.
00:29:56.022 - 00:29:56.558, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:29:56.686 - 00:30:07.124, Speaker E: Historically speaking, alcohol, pubs, taverns have played a very significant role in all sorts of paradigm shifts. You know, technological revolutions. Revolution revolutions.
00:30:07.904 - 00:30:08.768, Speaker B: Think about Hamilton.
00:30:08.816 - 00:30:08.976, Speaker D: Right?
00:30:09.000 - 00:30:14.640, Speaker B: I mean, the second song, my shot, right. It's about taking shots with his buddies at the bar and plotting the revolution.
00:30:14.712 - 00:30:16.928, Speaker E: What's the one in Boston for the revere?
00:30:17.016 - 00:30:17.336, Speaker D: Oh.
00:30:17.400 - 00:30:21.720, Speaker B: Bell in hand is a famous revolutionary bar, the Green Dragon.
00:30:21.792 - 00:30:27.844, Speaker E: The green dragon was where, I think that was where he started or something. But anyway, there's a ton of those in Boston.
00:30:30.024 - 00:30:30.496, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:30:30.560 - 00:30:31.680, Speaker B: So it makes sense, sort of, like.
00:30:31.752 - 00:30:34.472, Speaker E: Providing this, like, you know, platform, basically.
00:30:34.528 - 00:30:36.040, Speaker B: It's very cool stuff.
00:30:36.232 - 00:30:36.832, Speaker E: Thank you.
00:30:36.888 - 00:30:39.792, Speaker B: Let's talk about. Let's talk about bitcoin in general.
00:30:39.888 - 00:30:40.152, Speaker D: Okay.
00:30:40.168 - 00:30:41.576, Speaker E: I like talking about bitcoin.
00:30:41.640 - 00:30:41.816, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:30:41.840 - 00:30:54.870, Speaker B: You're a guy, though, who's. I mean, you've researched bitcoin. You've worked on. You've done investment related stuff. In the bitcoin world, you're building in bitcoin culture. You've been a bitcoin subject matter expert, like at fidelity.
00:30:54.942 - 00:30:55.438, Speaker E: SME.
00:30:55.526 - 00:30:57.054, Speaker B: A SME an SME, as they say.
00:30:57.094 - 00:31:00.502, Speaker E: I hate that term. I even used it, and every time.
00:31:00.518 - 00:31:06.526, Speaker B: I do it, because a lot has changed. I mean, I want to ask you. Maybe we used inscriptions and ordinals as a jumping off point, but then we'll go backwards.
00:31:06.590 - 00:31:07.630, Speaker E: Overwhelmingly positive.
00:31:07.702 - 00:31:08.462, Speaker B: You like it a lot?
00:31:08.518 - 00:31:09.206, Speaker E: Very much so.
00:31:09.270 - 00:31:10.070, Speaker B: What do you like about it?
00:31:10.102 - 00:31:49.806, Speaker E: It's great for miners. If you have block space that is not being utilized in each block, it means that there's, you know, diminished value for that. If block space is valuable because you're able to have settlement, finality and immutability, that's something that's valuable. And I think ordinals, in some ways, accidentally opened up this massive opportunity to prove that block space is valuable, that inscriptions and inscribing something in the bitcoin blockchain forever is a really powerful tool. It's going to cause transaction fees that we've already seen it. Not massive strides, but it's trending in the right direction.
00:31:49.870 - 00:31:55.150, Speaker B: We're not really seeing one SAP per v byte. Anymore, really. We haven't really. It's gotten back down to two.
00:31:55.262 - 00:32:21.312, Speaker E: And I thought like, I think that the twelve fold, the Yugalabs ordinal launch is underappreciated. Watching that mechanism, it was a 24 hours auction, and in that last 30 minutes, the leaderboard, right. You had to have, you had to place a bid that was in the top 288, whatever. That leaderboard was changing quite a bit in that last hour or so. Are you going to get another block before the cutoff? Like, is my bid high enough? Like a game of wasn't.
00:32:21.328 - 00:32:22.728, Speaker B: It was quite an interesting mechanism.
00:32:22.776 - 00:32:41.456, Speaker E: It was really, really cool. So anyway, transaction fees go up, blocks are full. That's good for miners, allows Myers. You know, it's giving some like, you know, badly needed, you know, revenue boost. It's good for mining pools. We're seeing mining pools playing a really interesting role. Luxor specifically is really on top of the ordinal stuff.
00:32:41.456 - 00:33:21.426, Speaker E: I'm excited to see some developments coming out of them. It's also good for L2. It's pushing a lot of the activity up to L2. Before ordinals and before we saw more demand for block space. I think that we were building a tenuous overcapacity situation. Lightning network is developing quite nicely, but that doesn't matter if the miners are starving and dying because there's no transaction fees as we go cycle after having transaction fees must become more robust and sustainable. So I think ordinals are overwhelmingly positive.
00:33:21.570 - 00:33:31.562, Speaker B: What do you think it says about the BIP process? Because one of the interesting things to me was that this really did seem to surprise a lot of bitcoiners. It certainly surprised me.
00:33:31.698 - 00:33:33.546, Speaker E: I wrote about taproot. It could be little accident.
00:33:33.610 - 00:34:06.646, Speaker B: I kind of didn't realize that taproot and then obviously segwit, but combined during the speedy trial, activation of taproot, that it could result in lifting completely the arbitrary, the limit on arbitrary data, that it could actually result in this giant new blob space, or call data space, as we say. Isn't that weird and problematic? I mean, bitcoiners literally didn't expect this. Don't you think that if during the taproot debates online and whatnot, if people had really known that ordinals could be possible back then, they might have opposed taproot?
00:34:06.710 - 00:34:50.582, Speaker E: Yes, I think absolutely. Look, you know, speedy trial is a bit of a misnomer, I think, because the core development community is decentralized and there are a lot of core developers and they've done fantastic work. But there's a difference between bitcoin Core capital c, that's a development project, and bitcoin core development lowercase c, where you're actually developing on the protocol. I'd like to see more diversity of development teams. I've done a lot of work with Eric Vosko on the bitcoin project that was founded by Amir Taki. Amir actually created the bit process way back when he was the first one to take sort of the proposal system from Linux and apply it to bitcoin, formalize it for bitcoin, which was tremendously important.
00:34:50.638 - 00:34:53.998, Speaker B: Basically all the other altcoins have also copied that process for the most part.
00:34:54.086 - 00:34:54.798, Speaker E: Pretty much.
00:34:54.926 - 00:34:55.998, Speaker B: They call them VIP's.
00:34:56.046 - 00:35:27.562, Speaker E: VIP's CIPs and noster too. They're like Nips. But I think we have a situation where we want to see more diversity of development teams. You know, with a speedy trial. Like it's only natural if you work with a group of people on a daily basis, you become friends, you lower your degree of scrutiny or peer review. Not saying that that is problematic, but that is where some of the happy little accidents have come from.
00:35:27.618 - 00:35:40.214, Speaker B: And this was a happy accident. I agree. I think both of us are very positive on inscriptions and ordinals here. So in that sense it's happy. But it makes me concerned that what if it wasn't a happy accident, it was some other accident.
00:35:41.744 - 00:36:04.592, Speaker E: I mean, there have been inflation bugs before. Thankfully, everybody is like, we have just unbelievable talent in the development and engineering components of bitcoin core to be able to catch this stuff. But look, the concept of moving fast and breaking things does not really apply to bitcoin. You got to be really slow and deliberate.
00:36:04.728 - 00:36:30.356, Speaker B: That's what worries me a little bit about, and it doesn't. I think this has worked out great, but it makes me a bit bearish on like big bips in the future, right, that I think they'll be more narrow and fewer and far between. And I'm someone who in general, although I'm open to, I'm not necessarily advocating for any in particular, but I would like to continue updating bitcoin. Just generally. I don't believe that we should ossify the protocol now.
00:36:30.460 - 00:37:01.966, Speaker E: That's up to the users, right? So. And what? So every single upgrade to bitcoin core capital c is technically an alternative implementation. It's adding new features and it's up to the users whether or not they want to upgrade their node and implement those changes. So it's important to have really educated users and people who are running their own nodes actually are able to dive into the technical differentiation from upgrade to upgrade.
00:37:02.070 - 00:37:12.108, Speaker B: I would say the bitcoin users, the node runners, are more technical than probably any of the other networks. But are they technical enough for that?
00:37:12.196 - 00:37:21.972, Speaker E: It's the best, I think it's the best one that we have. It's the best. What's the worst option or. Yeah, exactly. There's always room for.
00:37:21.988 - 00:37:23.556, Speaker B: It's the worst option, except for all the others.
00:37:23.620 - 00:37:39.224, Speaker E: Yeah, exactly, exactly. There's always room for improvement. And look, we have great services that are popping up, that are setting up instances of running your own node. You're effectively trusting those ones. Some give the optionality to upgrade new features, turn features on and off.
00:37:39.304 - 00:37:42.936, Speaker B: This is also, you're talking about the physical nodes, like the umbrella.
00:37:43.040 - 00:37:44.264, Speaker E: Yeah, umbrella voltage.
00:37:44.344 - 00:37:46.464, Speaker B: Like voltage.
00:37:46.584 - 00:38:04.218, Speaker E: Yeah. And these are fantastic services. And we're seeing the same thing, I would say, in the lightning space as well. Like a. Zeus offers a tremendous. Zeus, by the way, also beloved friend and family of pub key. They implemented our bitcoin, you know, and lightning payments at the pub.
00:38:04.266 - 00:38:04.402, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:38:04.418 - 00:38:07.334, Speaker B: The Bloomberg story about pub key, which was a pretty good story.
00:38:07.794 - 00:38:08.082, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:38:08.098 - 00:38:16.930, Speaker B: But they, they did, they tried to dunk on you. They said the bitcoin bar that doesn't accept bitcoin, which has been a dunk that people have done on bitcoin companies or there was a bitcoin conference one.
00:38:16.962 - 00:38:19.170, Speaker E: Time they dunked on, I'm just out here larping.
00:38:19.242 - 00:38:23.290, Speaker B: But you also could have turned it on quickly with some kind of fully custodial service.
00:38:23.402 - 00:38:24.738, Speaker D: Yeah. Instead, what did you do?
00:38:24.826 - 00:38:59.674, Speaker E: Well, we wanted, we wanted something that was more functional. We wanted to be cognizant of, I would say, the regulatory landscape here in New York City. We wanted to do things in the right way. I mean, look, this is smashing together the two most heavily regulated businesses on the planet between a liquor license and bitcoin. So we want to be pretty deliberate and stay on the safe side of things, but we want to do bitcoin stuff and going about it in the right way is really important. I think we got it up pretty fast. And Zeus is a major non custodial setup.
00:38:59.794 - 00:39:03.454, Speaker B: You guys hold your own keys or whatever for this thing.
00:39:05.714 - 00:39:08.154, Speaker E: And we are, we are holding the bitcoin that we receive.
00:39:08.274 - 00:39:10.354, Speaker B: Oh, so you're stacking, you're using it to stack.
00:39:10.434 - 00:39:10.786, Speaker D: Yes.
00:39:10.850 - 00:39:11.882, Speaker E: Oh, wow. All of it.
00:39:11.938 - 00:39:12.394, Speaker B: Love that.
00:39:12.434 - 00:39:20.834, Speaker E: All less than 1% of total revenue until it becomes an operational, you know, God willing, it'll become an operational headache where we'll have to.
00:39:20.914 - 00:39:22.226, Speaker B: So many people are paying with bitcoin.
00:39:22.290 - 00:39:22.442, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:39:22.458 - 00:39:23.874, Speaker B: Because you do accept dollars.
00:39:23.954 - 00:39:27.690, Speaker E: Yeah, well, we got to pay rent and, you know, con ed is not going to accept bitcoin.
00:39:27.842 - 00:39:37.470, Speaker B: Let's be real, you know, on the payment side. I mean, I love, I've, I spend bitcoin in some cases and I, you know, and have for years. But, you know, something that I'm literally going to drink.
00:39:37.662 - 00:39:38.038, Speaker E: Right.
00:39:38.086 - 00:39:42.846, Speaker B: I'd rather, if I'm going to buy something with bitcoin, if I can, I'd rather be like, you know, made out of stone.
00:39:42.910 - 00:39:43.150, Speaker D: Yes.
00:39:43.182 - 00:39:44.374, Speaker B: Or something really valuable.
00:39:44.454 - 00:39:47.286, Speaker E: Please replenish the bitcoin. You spend that pub key.
00:39:47.430 - 00:39:48.190, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:39:48.302 - 00:39:51.790, Speaker B: You're literally throwing bitcoin down your throat.
00:39:51.942 - 00:39:59.834, Speaker E: You don't want that. You don't want that. Like, you know, two or three beers to be worth a private jet one day. That would be unfortunate. We all have those stories. If it's.
00:40:00.894 - 00:40:04.910, Speaker B: Oh, man, this has been great. Thomas, thanks for coming so much, my friend.
