00:00:00.720 - 00:00:02.193, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:02.289 - 00:00:03.805, Speaker B: An infinite amount of cash.
00:00:04.385 - 00:00:19.365, Speaker A: I'm your host, Alex Thorne. The US banking system is sound and resilient. Bitcoin meeting new, all time high. If you're not long. If you're not long, you're short. Satoshi's gonna come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet. All bitcoin's gonna be erased.
00:00:19.665 - 00:00:24.845, Speaker B: Bitcoin. Bitcoin's the best crypto out there. Bitcoin is going to zero.
00:00:25.875 - 00:00:52.623, Speaker A: Welcome back to Galaxy Brains. As always, I'm your host Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy. And we have a great edition of the Hong Kong tapes interviews that I recorded from Galaxy HQ in Hong Kong in September. This episode we have a great guest, Xiao Bing from Avenir Crypto. I'm going to talk with Xiao about what they're doing building a crypto conglomerate from scratch. Avenir is a spin out from the family office from one of Huobi's founders. It's a fascinating conversation.
00:00:52.623 - 00:01:21.461, Speaker A: We'll talk with Zhao Bing about what they are building, including a big fund of funds. They're going to invest a lot of money in crypto funds. Before we get to that, I need to remind you to please refer to a link disclaimer in the podcast notes. And note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer recommendation or solicitation by Galaxy or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Let's hop right into the conversation with Xiao Bing. Let's go now to our guest, Zhang Bing, CIO of Avenir Crypto. Bing, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:01:21.623 - 00:01:22.513, Speaker B: Thanks Alex.
00:01:22.649 - 00:01:39.125, Speaker A: I'm excited to talk with you. We were talking before and you know, we're recording this here in our in Galaxy's Hong Kong office and I just learned about Avenir, but it's. You're making a big splash already in markets. What is Avenir Crypto? Maybe at a high level you can, you can share with the audience.
00:01:39.425 - 00:02:09.705, Speaker B: Sure, of course. Avenir Crypto belongs to the Avenir Group. Avenue Group was found is essentially a family office founded by the ex Huobi founder, Mr. Li Lin himself. The company the group started last year and currently we have four business lines. Avenue Crypto is the biggest with controlling 95% of the assets that Mr. Li Ling has.
00:02:09.705 - 00:02:40.057, Speaker B: And the second business line is the Avenir Capital which is a Hong Kong based family office. And the third one is Avenue Innovation which invests in new technologies that includes AI, new energy, renewable energy and biotechs. But currently what's hot definitely will be AI. The last one is Ibane foundation which is a charity group.
00:02:40.211 - 00:02:51.185, Speaker A: So let's dig into Avenir crypto because that's where you work. And also you said it was 95% of the assets are in that business unit. What are you guys doing in crypto or plan to do?
00:02:51.845 - 00:03:41.289, Speaker B: Yeah, we are actually quite busy. I think after the family office was set up we started actively managing the founders assets. Basically the holdings pretty much in majority of them are still in the cryptos and on back of the BTC holding and ETH holding. What kept us busy is that we're applying the correcting strategies to generate and enhance yields on back of the assets. You know, the strikes and maturity we choose are carefully chosen so that even if the price goes above the strikes, we're okay by selling at those levels.
00:03:41.337 - 00:03:50.177, Speaker A: Yep. So income generation strategies with options for now. But you have other plans to deploy some of that capital.
00:03:50.361 - 00:04:37.217, Speaker B: That is correct. So we don't want a very concentrated strategy. So what we did is that we carved out about $500 million recently to give to external fund managers. It's more like a fund business. And we did two events, one in Hong Kong the week before last week and the one in Singapore along with the 2049 token events and to officially launch the Avenir fund of fund partnership program. I actually like to call it I have near cubs because you just mimic just like tiger cubs concept. So yeah, so we carefully of course for this program we welcome.
00:04:37.217 - 00:04:55.583, Speaker B: Of course we have a strict set of criteria. We choose the managers but everything else equal. We prefer to have ticker strategies that will generate healthy ticker flows which serves some other purposes of our initiatives.
00:04:55.679 - 00:05:12.487, Speaker A: Interesting. So other managers and do you have a. Is there a specific sets of strategies? For example, you know, are we talking about managers pursuing long short strategies or market neutral strategies or quant strategies or all of the above?
00:05:12.671 - 00:06:04.817, Speaker B: Yeah, we. We look at all strategies across the board. But among all of them I think on the top, top of the list will be CTA because we like that kind of risk profile. If you make, you make a lot but you control the downside. And also market neutral strategies are also welcomed things like cross sectional coins, long short option, delta neutral strategies, you know, the bottom of the list. I will say that currently given the capacity we have, we you know, bottom list will be like this arbitrage strategies to be honest, because that's something that theoretically is very easy to understand. We ourselves have.
00:06:04.817 - 00:06:10.609, Speaker B: Have actually quite a big allocation to our own traders. We're doing that ourselves.
00:06:10.657 - 00:06:26.995, Speaker A: I see. So you for diversification, you don't necessarily need ARBs. What was your impression you said through these events in Hong Kong and Singapore? I was at the token conference in Singapore. There were a lot of people there. I think the organizers said 25,000 attendees.
00:06:27.415 - 00:06:27.919, Speaker B: Right.
00:06:28.007 - 00:06:37.275, Speaker A: That's huge. That was probably the biggest conference of the year. In crypto, did it feel like a bull market to you or what was your impression?
00:06:37.615 - 00:07:07.765, Speaker B: It feels definitely like a bull market. Just for example, the event that we had in Singapore, we had like 485% of them eventually made it the one in Hong Kong because it's more closed door. But there's still more than 100 people showed up. And overall in Singapore I met so many people. My calendar is like a blockchain.
00:07:09.265 - 00:07:29.355, Speaker A: Yeah, mine looked like that too. I thought it really was too. That was my first time in Singapore. I was blown away at how, how many people traveled there for the conference. I mean it's, I mean unless you're, if you're in Asia, it's not that far. But there were tons of people from Europe and North America. Like, I mean that's far trip.
00:07:29.815 - 00:08:02.507, Speaker B: Yeah, I think crypto is known to have Asia as its early centers. Yeah, I mean if you think about these, you know, top tier exchanges, you know, Binance, OKEx, Bybit, but the Huobi, you know, are all Huobi. In the past, they, they, they took off, you know, I think crypto, you know, CEFI exchange took off from Asia. Yeah, you have a lot of Thailand's veterans in this region. So that's probably. You guys are still in an opportunity.
00:08:02.641 - 00:08:26.095, Speaker A: Bitcoin mining, obviously all the manufacturers of the ASICs, the, you know, the biggest ones. Yeah, it's, and, and other big exchanges too. Even, even ones that like Bitfinex even moved out to Asia for a while. I recall it's a lot of interest here. Is there? Why, why do you think that is? Is there, Is there something cultural? Is it, is it? You know.
00:08:26.135 - 00:08:41.085, Speaker B: Yeah, I think culturally, Culturally, I think Asian people likes to bet, they like to take a risk. I mean, look at the casinos in Macau. I mean they look at the casinos in MBS in Singapore, it's a full lot of people. Even I go to Vegas, there's lots of Asians.
00:08:43.545 - 00:08:45.085, Speaker A: I've only been there once, but yes.
00:08:47.105 - 00:09:19.681, Speaker B: Even the people like my grandma's page or grandpa's page, they're still doing the machines. Yeah, I think that's the culture. And also I think the early success of, you know, Asia operated exchanges, they stress on profits Even these days, I think the tradition, that culture, the profitability driven culture is still in binance, is very deep rooted in binance and same for us as well.
00:09:19.873 - 00:09:30.245, Speaker A: Here's another question too. So you've got some in house trading strategies you're going to allocate to other managers perhaps with other strategies to diversify. What about venture are you going to do venture investing?
00:09:31.535 - 00:10:29.517, Speaker B: We have in house like a VC or pe, like venture investing department right now that's in charge of a young lady over there. But the majority of these holdings are actually coming from the old Huobi days. You know they are investing a lot of early stage projects and we just inherited them from them. But for a while I think the founder himself wasn't quite keen on doing more such investing because especially this year, it wasn't a great year for the, for the venture investing but we started opening up that investment avenue again primarily because you know the vision the founder has. Also not only we invest in ventures, that department actually is called strategic investments. We invest any startups that has something related to crypto or crypto business, but.
00:10:29.541 - 00:11:10.863, Speaker A: Not a broad based venture strategy at the moment not saying what do you in terms of segments in crypto. Like for example, I was talking with somebody yesterday about what the big trends are in the crypto market this year in terms of thematic trends. And there are some infrastructure is a big one. Things like restaking and modularity and but. And defi is strong but it's not growing huge. Do you. Is there any like what we say like the application layer, something that intrigues you in particular or intrigues Avenir? You know, is it defi for you know I was talked with Arthur Chiang from Defiance Capital.
00:11:10.863 - 00:11:20.617, Speaker A: He's a big defi guy. Is there or is it just like do you have any particular interests in one over the other or one areas or is it a little bit of everything?
00:11:20.801 - 00:12:17.523, Speaker B: It's funny you ask this question because myself, I myself actually was a very very heavy defi user. I won't call myself Degen but I use a lot. Previously before I joined Avenir I basically tried every major defi launches, the apps myself. But at ivanir level we haven't seriously identified any investable opportunities in the defi space but we have a lot of VC connections. I was talking to some heavyweights people in Singapore about VC investing in crypto native projects and they are from a risk reward perspective. You think that investing in layer one or L2, these kind of products makes sense Sense from risk reward perspective. Other things they come and Go.
00:12:17.523 - 00:12:25.995, Speaker B: You know, there's always this narrative about you gone in six months time. So that, that, that's, that instability doesn't make these opportunities look that attractive.
00:12:26.075 - 00:12:59.507, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's right. The, the applications, whether it's defi applications or NFTs or games or whatever, they, they're not. It's been a bit stagnant this year I think in terms of growth in those areas. But new blockchains as always. But to me I'm a little bit cynical about these because they, they are, they have been good investments. But, but it's kind of like do we really need more blockchains at some point? Shouldn't crypto deliver some killer applications to people or have we already?
00:12:59.611 - 00:13:18.567, Speaker B: Well, interesting, right? Because, because I always, when I come to this subject, I always, you know, I like to borrow the example of, of the invention of refrigerators because when the refrigerator, refrigerators came live, people think wow, these companies like GE are gonna make a massive amount of money.
00:13:18.631 - 00:13:18.879, Speaker A: Right.
00:13:18.927 - 00:13:57.203, Speaker B: But in the end it is not the refrigerators producers that made that much money. It is the Coca Cola that made massive amount of money. That lesson told me that the platform probably is not going to make you rich, but cherry pick the right application will. So by holding that notion, that's my way of investing. So basically I look at the uniswap, I look at lead lido. All these things are technology wise is revolutionary. I mean they're definitely top notch applications.
00:13:57.203 - 00:14:23.385, Speaker B: But the problem with that is the tokenomics. Given the US regulation, all the other things, the token holders cannot capture the value. So that's the dilemma. I don't know how long, I'm not a regulation expert. I think one day somebody is going to come say this is a way to unlock the value of these fantastic apps. We need that day to come.
00:14:23.685 - 00:15:03.555, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's right. I think if you can have tokens look a little bit more like equity. But there is a difference in regulatory framework between the US and Well, there's a lot of different ones I guess all over the world. Do you think that there will be? For example, even in Hong Kong they have taken a much more direct and progressive approach to regulation than they did in the past. And I would say also than many other places. Do you think it will flourish more here than elsewhere? Is there? Because there does feel like there's something very positive happening in Asia in crypto.
00:15:03.895 - 00:15:47.215, Speaker B: Yeah, I think Hong Kong is in many ways are ahead of the US in terms of regulation. But the problem with Hong Kong is that this Market itself or the market that can reach is still relatively small. Without China getting, getting really involved. I think the advancement in Hong Kong is going to have, is going to be. Has a limited effect. US on the other hand is the largest homogeneous market in the world. I think anything coming a slight change in regulation or slight softening in the regulation in the US will make a much bigger impact anywhere else.
00:15:47.295 - 00:16:22.277, Speaker A: That's interesting. Yeah. I think, you know, I wonder about, I do wonder about it. I think both. I think there's a lot of blind spot in the US to what's happening here. And I think from a regulatory standpoint certainly the US is kind of fumbling dropping the ball a little bit by not recognizing how big of an opportunity is. It feels like some other jurisdictions outside the US like here recognize a real opportunity to differentiate and capture on sort of America's delay in figuring out how they want to handle this.
00:16:22.421 - 00:16:50.083, Speaker B: Yeah. And also regarding the US regulation I think another the roadblock is that just have too many regulatory bodies over there. I mean it's really hard to coordinate each other. Everybody sometimes want to push out the responsibilities. Some of them want to over you know, with feeling that you know, they should rule like you know, you have, you know, icc, you know, cftc, some.
00:16:50.139 - 00:16:56.651, Speaker A: Consumer bunch of them, the trade, ftc, the cfpb. There's every acronym you can think of.
00:16:56.763 - 00:17:06.923, Speaker B: Exactly. So that make the regulation very hard to make in the US and that basically the consequence of that is that you are pushing out the risk taking offshore.
00:17:07.019 - 00:17:07.251, Speaker A: Right.
00:17:07.283 - 00:17:10.145, Speaker B: Which created all these problems that we had.
00:17:10.185 - 00:17:12.233, Speaker A: Yeah. Ftx. Yeah.
00:17:12.329 - 00:17:13.569, Speaker B: Luna, et cetera, et cetera.
00:17:13.617 - 00:17:13.825, Speaker A: Right.
00:17:13.865 - 00:17:17.049, Speaker B: So you know, I think, I think there's something that has to be.
00:17:17.097 - 00:17:17.369, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:17.417 - 00:17:18.233, Speaker B: Has to be done there.
00:17:18.289 - 00:17:38.971, Speaker A: That's I hope it will be. We have a little bit of optimism just because of the presidential election. And you know, one side I think is very obviously good for crypto. The other side is still might be better than the current. Right. That's sort of, maybe that's optimistic in my mind. But in either case there's a catalyst on the horizon of that election that might change it.
00:17:38.971 - 00:18:13.085, Speaker A: I think also the US is maybe the only major economy that has two primary market regulators where commodities and securities are regulated by two different agencies. Which makes it adds an interesting political battle between the agencies like bureaucratic battle on top of the other stuff that makes it difficult. I think most right. In Hong Kong regulator is also the central bank or the money issuer too. It's all combined into one. Right. So maybe it will flourish here.
00:18:14.185 - 00:18:27.569, Speaker B: One interesting observation is that last year, this year Hong Kong is actually the first one that made the ETH spot ETF available for the us.
00:18:27.657 - 00:18:28.169, Speaker A: That's right.
00:18:28.257 - 00:19:05.017, Speaker B: So if you think that's a leading indicator, what's interesting is I was telling people that there might be a little catalyst for ETH price is that now just maybe a week ago, Hong Kong, there's the news that Hong Kong started studying that for the ETF inflows, the ETH under the ETF can be staked. So you can have a little bit risk free yield on top of that. If you think that's a leading indicator, the US may follow right now that's, that's still not available.
00:19:05.161 - 00:19:05.649, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:05.737 - 00:19:07.353, Speaker B: In the US I said that would.
00:19:07.369 - 00:19:39.557, Speaker A: Be huge because I think for a lot of financial advisors, if you like, the fees matter. Right. ETFs are very low fee products and by not having staking in an Ethereum ETF it's effectively like adding 300 or 400 basis points of fee. And so yeah, you'd be so much better off just buying and staking it yourself. Actual spot ether. Well, I think it's really interesting. I can't wait to find out more about what Avenir is doing.
00:19:39.557 - 00:19:43.225, Speaker A: It sounds you only just really started a few months ago, right?
00:19:43.685 - 00:20:16.643, Speaker B: Yeah, so we started, I think the firm was set up last year but this year is the year that we really started running building up the business. So the first line of business is to manage the farms, his own wealth. Now we're thinking now we carved out 500 million to give to the external managers to diversify the risk taking. The next step is that we're building a proper asset management platform so that we can start extracting the external assets.
00:20:16.739 - 00:20:26.795, Speaker A: Right. So you start raising some outside capital. And then would that be deploying it into the fund of funds primarily as the first one or like other Strat or other strategies maybe as well.
00:20:26.875 - 00:20:40.691, Speaker B: Yeah. We will decide once we have a more diversified trading. Trading trading teams inside in house. Yeah. Then we can choose and pick. Most likely will favor our own strategies.
00:20:40.843 - 00:20:48.403, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense I guess because then you're stuck doing. If you do others then you're sort of doing cap capital introduction business which is kind of tricky. Right?
00:20:48.499 - 00:21:07.963, Speaker B: Yeah. And also from a system system perspective, if you start, you know, attracting external money then you have to, you know, build a very, you know, robust fall platform where you have external trading teams as well as external. The capital capitalists.
00:21:08.059 - 00:21:08.379, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:21:08.427 - 00:21:14.417, Speaker B: So that you are, you're sitting in middle and manage both sides. That does Require decent support.
00:21:14.481 - 00:21:35.497, Speaker A: Yeah, it does. And then there's like your brokering and there's a different. There's probably other regulatory things too that make it tricky. Yeah. Whereas if you're just purely offering fund vehicles, then you're a classic asset manager. It's very interesting too to think about. The founder has wealth generated from building one of the world's largest exchanges.
00:21:35.497 - 00:21:51.055, Speaker A: But you're mostly still in crypto. You say diversifying, it's mostly within crypto. Right. He's not. Because I saw for example Tether has just bought a farm, some kind of agricultural business. I read $100 million. I'm like, now that is diversification.
00:21:52.875 - 00:22:32.909, Speaker B: We start seeing some diversifications slowly. The Avenir Innovation is the new technology investment arm for us. We just set up an office in Silicon Valley, so we started building a team over there as well. So it's interesting, the other day actually we had a group dinner together and the founder was standing there, he talked more about AI than crypto. So that once he sat down, I was sitting next to him and I asked him particularly that if you have only one choice, you choose between BTC or Nvidia. So what is your choice?
00:22:32.957 - 00:22:33.595, Speaker A: Oh, no.
00:22:33.725 - 00:22:36.383, Speaker B: Then he, you know, fumbled for five minutes.
00:22:36.479 - 00:22:38.855, Speaker A: Okay, that's good. I'm happy. It was hard for him at least.
00:22:38.935 - 00:22:39.463, Speaker B: It's hard.
00:22:39.519 - 00:22:40.927, Speaker A: Yeah, that's hard.
00:22:41.031 - 00:23:11.785, Speaker B: He carefully said that he probably will still choose crypto. A reason is that, you know, given, you know, Nvidia now had 1,5 trillion market cap. Right. But for that to crip to quadruple in 5 years time you need you, you need a perfect, you know, like need like a few things to be. To be. To be. To be perfect to be met in order for that includes no competitors.
00:23:11.785 - 00:23:21.757, Speaker B: The current AI studios, the transformer, the LM kind of technologies going forward, et cetera, et cetera. China won't come in big, et cetera, et cetera.
00:23:21.781 - 00:23:26.625, Speaker A: Right. There's management risk as well. What if it's just not done properly? Exactly.
00:23:26.935 - 00:23:37.063, Speaker B: And, but for bitcoin to quotable to go to 200,000. You only need a trump to say that I'm making this reserve.
00:23:37.119 - 00:23:38.639, Speaker A: I know, yeah. So that's positive.
00:23:38.687 - 00:23:39.223, Speaker B: One condition.
00:23:39.279 - 00:23:39.519, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:39.567 - 00:23:41.887, Speaker B: Boom. The thing will go 200,000.
00:23:41.991 - 00:24:23.855, Speaker A: What is your view being on like the, like how. What's the end bullish case for bitcoin or for crypto in your mind? For example, some friends of mine, they think the bitcoin wants is only successful if it becomes the unit of currency for the world. Others say no, it could simply be a digital gold like asset and that would be, that would be victory. Like in your mind like you know, or you know, John was on, John Cahill from Galaxy was saying on this, on this podcast that if it just crypto replaces the plumbing of all of the financial apparatus then that, that was his, his vision of victory. Do you have some, some view of what the future, what a very happy future looks like?
00:24:24.355 - 00:25:05.715, Speaker B: I think given the nature of bitcoin and also given the existence of all these large sovereigns like us, China, they won't give up, right? They won't give up decentralized management. So I think bitcoin will not take over. But it could be 10% of, could support 10% of today's GDP in 10 years time. I have no problem with that. If that does happen. Let's say the, you know, currently the global GDP is at $100 trillion in 10 years time grow to 120 maybe trillion, then BTC supports 10% of that. That give you a valuation of $400,000.
00:25:05.755 - 00:25:10.619, Speaker A: That's like a 6,6xish from here, right? Because we're about 2 trillion. Yeah, yeah.
00:25:10.707 - 00:25:12.371, Speaker B: So I can easily see that happening.
00:25:12.443 - 00:25:14.251, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, that's not in Singapore.
00:25:14.323 - 00:25:25.003, Speaker B: If you notice, in Singapore use the app called Grab to call cars. Yeah, yeah, Grab just starting yesterday or today they started accepting BTC a few cryptocurrencies as deposits.
00:25:25.059 - 00:25:25.619, Speaker A: Did they really?
00:25:25.667 - 00:25:26.411, Speaker B: They can use that now.
00:25:26.443 - 00:25:26.771, Speaker A: Wow.
00:25:26.843 - 00:25:31.875, Speaker B: In Singapore maybe they made it to a few some users but at least that's a good start.
