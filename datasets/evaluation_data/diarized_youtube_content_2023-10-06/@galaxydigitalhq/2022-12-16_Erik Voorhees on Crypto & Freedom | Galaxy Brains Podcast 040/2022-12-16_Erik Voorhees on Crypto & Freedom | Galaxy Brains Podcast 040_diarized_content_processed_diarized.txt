00:00:08.240 - 00:00:36.194, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains for weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. I'm back with another rap, but a shorter verse, non custodial. Not your keys, not your cheese. We're talking today with bitcoin Og Eric Voorhees. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firm wide research at Galaxy Digital. We have an awesome show today. We're talking with Shapeshift founder and former CEO, now Dow member of Shapeshift, Eric Voorhees.
00:00:36.194 - 00:01:22.388, Speaker A: He's been in bitcoin since 2011. We're going to talk with him about bitcoin culture, bitcoin history, shapeshift, dows, defi, FTX and Alameda and a lot more. So you definitely want to hear that Saul Kadir from the research team and I will interview Eric momentarily. But before we get to Eric, we will check in with our good friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Digital trading to talk markets. The Fed today raised rates by 50 bps, so we'll get into it with him. And before we begin, I must remind you to please look at the disclaimer in the link on the podcast notes and note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes an offer, solicitation, or recommendation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. That's it.
00:01:22.388 - 00:01:28.588, Speaker A: We're ready to go. Let's get right into it. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet, a BB from Galaxy Digital trading. How you doing today, Bim. Net?
00:01:28.676 - 00:01:31.628, Speaker B: It's like my Super bowl. I'm having a great day.
00:01:31.716 - 00:01:34.476, Speaker A: CPI yesterday, that day today.
00:01:34.580 - 00:01:41.532, Speaker B: Yeah, we got ECB and Bank of England also later this week. So this is like, it's, and there's the World cup and there's the World.
00:01:41.548 - 00:01:49.812, Speaker A: Cup, it's the Super bowl, and there's been some good NFL games. Let's get past that. Tell me what the data said this week on CPI. This was on Tuesday, today's Wednesday.
00:01:49.868 - 00:02:19.964, Speaker B: That was, yeah. So basically all of the components that we wanted to see showing a deceleration in prices, we saw, and the big ones were things like core inflation, like the food prices. Shelter was a little high. It was like 0.6 month on month. But used autos dropped a lot. Yeah, broadly speaking, like a 0.1
00:02:19.964 - 00:02:27.968, Speaker B: month on month increase will get you there if you just keep printing 0.1. So a lot of things were good in inflation.
00:02:28.096 - 00:02:29.792, Speaker A: It's still an increase, right? It is.
00:02:29.848 - 00:02:42.336, Speaker B: But you want, like the Fed is targeting 2% inflation, right? They want prices to only go up by 2% a year, basically. Right. So it's all about the rate of change of prices, not the absolute level.
00:02:42.440 - 00:02:47.758, Speaker A: That's interesting because we're not going to get out of this process. We're not going to get back to the prices.
00:02:47.806 - 00:02:54.182, Speaker B: No, never, never. That's never been the out of the bag. Yeah. Well, that's the key thing about like inflation targeting.
00:02:54.238 - 00:03:04.326, Speaker A: Probably not our audience and a lot of finance people know this, but like, I think the general public thinks that like, inflation going down will mean that we like, come back to where we were.
00:03:04.390 - 00:03:04.950, Speaker B: No, it's.
00:03:05.022 - 00:03:05.934, Speaker A: That never happens, doesn't it?
00:03:05.974 - 00:03:07.054, Speaker B: Never happens.
00:03:07.214 - 00:03:14.744, Speaker A: So we're going to. So the ideal then is a big, is what happened, a big jump up and then we hope, like a flattening of inflation.
00:03:14.864 - 00:03:20.968, Speaker B: Correct. So like your apartment rent went from 2000 a month to 3000 super quickly.
00:03:21.016 - 00:03:21.344, Speaker A: Right.
00:03:21.424 - 00:03:28.368, Speaker B: But we want the balance of the increases to go to like 3000 to 3100, 3200 slowly.
00:03:28.416 - 00:03:28.624, Speaker A: Right.
00:03:28.664 - 00:03:30.712, Speaker B: And that's really what the Fed's trying to do.
00:03:30.768 - 00:03:37.560, Speaker A: And .1 would get us there is what you're saying. If you consistently print that's a 1.2% annual inflation.
00:03:37.632 - 00:03:38.126, Speaker B: Yes.
00:03:38.240 - 00:03:39.850, Speaker A: So zero point one's actually great.
00:03:40.002 - 00:03:41.258, Speaker B: Yes, correct.
00:03:41.346 - 00:03:41.690, Speaker A: Got it.
00:03:41.722 - 00:03:44.042, Speaker B: But the math is not linear like that. But yes.
00:03:44.098 - 00:03:44.370, Speaker A: Right, right.
00:03:44.402 - 00:03:57.738, Speaker B: It's not, but. Exactly. And so the things that we know, like, are going to work with a lag or things like CPI. Sorry. Things like shelter. Right. Like we know that monetary policy works with a lag.
00:03:57.786 - 00:03:59.210, Speaker A: Cause that's on what, like rents are.
00:03:59.242 - 00:04:05.320, Speaker B: Like longer duration and the measure is a little bit more backward looking. Yeah. And so.
00:04:05.392 - 00:04:06.144, Speaker A: Got it.
00:04:06.304 - 00:04:12.192, Speaker B: That's why it gets tricky. So imagine like, your lease is up, like, and you haven't renewed in like a year. Your rent's gonna jump.
00:04:12.208 - 00:04:18.984, Speaker A: Right. You're not seeing the increase yet. Yeah, yeah. So then, so how do, I mean, markets were up yesterday.
00:04:19.064 - 00:04:44.174, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it was a crazy, crazy market reaction. Nasdaq ripped about 4%. Front end rates rallied by 30 basis points, which is huge. I was like wing scenarios, like really hawkish number, really dovish. I was anticipating 25 basis points. Maybe you get 27, but you moved 30 plus basis points. I think at some point it was like 33 basis points in certain contracts.
00:04:44.174 - 00:05:48.644, Speaker B: So it was a welcome surprise to the market. However, I would say that the price action you saw after the number came out tells you that there was a lot baked in. One of the sort of high frequency data points that we like to look at is this thing called the Adobe index. Basically it measures trillions of data points across online retail, basically anything you can scrape, data wise, and get yourself a feed of what's going on in prices it looks at, and it hit a low that hadn't been seen since 2020 for the month of November. And it typically leads CPI pretty well. So there's a lot of chatter amongst rate watchers and fed watchers that the CPI number would be flat because you had all these sales during cyber Monday. All of these good consumer good companies had huge inventories, so they wanted to offload that in the holiday season.
00:05:48.644 - 00:06:38.970, Speaker B: So you had, I generally think that the whisper or the actual expectation for the number was lower than the stated Bloomberg estimates. So once you had that initial reaction, which was just buy all risk and buy bonds, it kind of came down because that was already kind of baked into the number. In addition, you know that when rates go down and stock markets rise, that is effectively a loosening of financial conditions. And the whole objective of the Fed right now is to keep financial conditions sufficiently tight for a prolonged period of time. So you know that if the Fed came out dovish today, it would have been like game over for risk assets, right? Bonds would have gone crazy. And so they basically couldn't have followed up a soft CPI print by sounding like dovish.
00:06:39.042 - 00:06:46.866, Speaker A: So they raised today the FOMC by 50 bps, which a decline in the raise in the rise.
00:06:46.890 - 00:06:51.810, Speaker B: So pricing had gone to like 52, 53 going into the meeting, you're saying.
00:06:51.842 - 00:06:55.330, Speaker A: They came out hawkish in fed. Jay Powell came out hawkish in his statements.
00:06:55.402 - 00:07:31.468, Speaker B: In his statement. And in the dot plot, mainly his dot plot, that was increased by 50 basis points in terms of where we're gonna get to in terminal rates. So from 4.6% to 5.1%. Right. And he stressed that it's about how long rates stay high, not really about how high rates get, which is a very important nuance. It's like the difference between 475 is not that big, but 475 or 5% for six months versus a year, that's a much more material sort of impact.
00:07:31.556 - 00:07:33.012, Speaker A: And that's what they're signaling and saying.
00:07:33.108 - 00:07:51.948, Speaker B: That's what they're signaling and saying. But the market is sniffing it out already. They see the price declines coming. You can go out on the street and see the sale signs and, you know, I don't know if people have pumped gas recently, but gas has been coming off.
00:07:51.996 - 00:08:10.724, Speaker A: I actually saw it come down meaningfully, I think, in North Carolina or, yeah, where I buy gas, it was really at like $349.90.09 or 0.99 for weeks and weeks and weeks. And now I think I saw last weekend was $3.10. I mean, that's a material decline.
00:08:10.804 - 00:08:11.812, Speaker B: That's 10%.
00:08:11.908 - 00:08:13.956, Speaker A: Yeah. And it looked.
00:08:13.980 - 00:08:14.348, Speaker C: It felt.
00:08:14.396 - 00:08:20.930, Speaker A: Actually felt like it was still dropping because it wasn't like I had seen, like, $3.20. That was, like, 315.
00:08:20.932 - 00:08:31.180, Speaker B: And couple that with the idea that prices are quick to adjust to the upside. Right. But slow to react to the downside.
00:08:31.252 - 00:08:31.460, Speaker A: Right.
00:08:31.492 - 00:09:07.050, Speaker B: Nobody wants to decrease their prices, but they're very happy to increase their prices, and so there's a lead lag sort of effect there. But while we're on the subject of gas, one of the hardest hit sort of price subjects was used cars. I think used car prices were down over 10% in the month of November. I might be wrong on that, but point is, it's down. It's down. And why is that? Because it's a rate sensitive part of the market. When somebody buys a car, they typically finance a portion of it.
00:09:07.050 - 00:09:18.070, Speaker B: I saw yesterday, somebody tweeted that a person with an 820 credit score, which is basically close to perfect, got quoted eight and 10% for their auto loan, which is absurd.
00:09:18.102 - 00:09:19.358, Speaker A: It's insane, right.
00:09:19.406 - 00:09:23.878, Speaker B: Versus, like, a year and a half ago. It's crazy. Zero rates. Like, you know, I remember.
00:09:23.926 - 00:09:35.238, Speaker A: Remember they were. I mean, that's what they were all the time. I don't remember if it was a year and a half ago, but definitely during the sort of, you know, 2010 to 2020 period. I mean, there was all these advertisements for just, like, 0% loans, zero interest.
00:09:35.286 - 00:09:38.378, Speaker B: Rate free, and now money costs.
00:09:38.466 - 00:09:46.454, Speaker A: Money is expensive. Yeah, that's what they meant. Money was cheap. Okay, so before. One last angle here. Crypto.
00:09:47.314 - 00:09:47.746, Speaker D: Well, we got.
00:09:47.770 - 00:10:16.374, Speaker B: We should talk about the Fed today. Like. All right. But. So the key thing that he stressed in the press conference today in the Q and a section was about employment. The labor market that we've been talking about is still incredibly tight. And basically, in the summary of economic projections, the Fed said unemployment is going to get up to 4.7%.
00:10:16.374 - 00:10:27.794, Speaker B: 4.7% is like, if you asked Janet Yellen a decade ago where she wanted unemployment to be and where she'd be happy about it.
00:10:27.834 - 00:10:28.058, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:10:28.106 - 00:10:28.642, Speaker A: 4%.
00:10:28.698 - 00:10:42.764, Speaker B: 4.5%. That's a really good level in their projections. They're telling you that, like, the. Like, we're gonna keep rates really tight for longer. We're gonna get inflation down. It's gonna come down. All that, and unemployment is barely gonna move higher.
00:10:42.844 - 00:10:45.652, Speaker A: It's gonna go to where they actually, theoretically wanted it.
00:10:45.788 - 00:10:46.268, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:46.356 - 00:10:47.348, Speaker A: It's not gonna go high.
00:10:47.436 - 00:10:48.412, Speaker B: It's not gonna go high.
00:10:48.468 - 00:10:49.700, Speaker A: Exactly. To what their prior target.
00:10:49.732 - 00:11:09.362, Speaker B: So this soft landing is, is so in reach for the fed. Right. You've had two inflation numbers in a row, you know, sort of tell you that you're headed in the right direction and people aren't losing their jobs like crazy and price pressures are coming off. And so it's like, holy shit, this stuff is working.
00:11:09.458 - 00:11:09.858, Speaker A: Wow.
00:11:09.946 - 00:11:17.774, Speaker B: So I think there's secretly a lot of optimism, you know, if you're a fed member and you're seeing, you know, the data.
00:11:18.794 - 00:11:19.298, Speaker A: Fascinating.
00:11:19.346 - 00:11:21.586, Speaker B: Not saying this is like a huge inflection point paradigm.
00:11:21.610 - 00:11:36.614, Speaker A: No, totally. But it's like the soft landing pop probability is saying it's increasing. It's increasing. Correct. And it had at some points been, I think, panned by all commentators is like virtually impossible. So it's no longer impossible in your mind.
00:11:36.734 - 00:11:37.078, Speaker C: Correct.
00:11:37.126 - 00:11:37.790, Speaker A: It is possible.
00:11:37.902 - 00:11:38.598, Speaker B: It is possible.
00:11:38.686 - 00:12:08.554, Speaker A: Interesting. And then, okay, so crypto prices, bitcoin traded up over 18k for the first time. And frankly, it might even be months, I can't recall, but certainly many weeks. ETH was over 1300. I think the audience can see the block clock next to me showing 17 eight is the current bitcoin price. But that was a risk on reaction to this news and frankly, mostly unmoved, I would say, today by the Fed, but buoyed yesterday by the CPI. Maybe just down ever so slightly with the Fed.
00:12:08.594 - 00:12:47.294, Speaker B: But yeah, no, I mean, it's a market that really moves at the margin. Now the landscape of liquid crypto investors is there's the long only structural. I'm here for ten years, 20 years, forever. I'm a hodler. There are those types and then there are the speculators that come into the market. I would say in terms of the speculators that are left and remaining in the market, there's just very few sellers. People's positions have been right sized by the fact that the market has moved a lot lower.
00:12:47.294 - 00:13:14.922, Speaker B: There was a lot of forced selling that's gone through in the market. And so that just leaves you with a setup where there's room for a lot of folks to add to risk and they're already at very low risk numbers. So it just leads to marginal buy pressure when you have good news, like inflation coming down or good news, a less hawkish fed. Right. And so, yeah, you know, is that.
00:13:14.978 - 00:13:17.642, Speaker A: Yeah, it just updated 17 698.
00:13:17.698 - 00:13:18.850, Speaker B: This is the wrong direction.
00:13:18.922 - 00:13:20.354, Speaker C: I know. It's going down.
00:13:20.474 - 00:13:41.060, Speaker A: The block clock updates every time a bitcoin block is mined, so it can be a little bit variable, but on about average every ten minutes. Yeah. So it sounds like we're still sort of in that spot we've been in. We moved a bit higher than we were, say, a couple of weeks ago, certainly. But still you see a lack of upside catalyst and also a lack of remaining four sellers. Sort of keeping us in this range.
00:13:41.132 - 00:13:51.452, Speaker B: Yeah, range bound is like. We did hear some news that there's going to be a ETF launched in Hong Kong that's futures based.
00:13:51.548 - 00:13:52.384, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:13:52.804 - 00:14:00.684, Speaker B: I think that can be a reasonable catalyst in the context of it's a product.
00:14:00.764 - 00:14:03.324, Speaker A: This is the first they would have out there on traditional markets.
00:14:03.404 - 00:14:04.024, Speaker C: Yes.
00:14:06.794 - 00:14:10.618, Speaker B: This is obviously a very different market than when the bitcoin ETF launched here in the US.
00:14:10.666 - 00:14:10.778, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:10.786 - 00:14:33.788, Speaker B: The proshares futures based on the bito ETF. It's a very different market. At the same time, though, it's very dangerous to short crypto and it's a new product. I would think there's going to be much more buyers than sellers of said product. But again, yeah, it is something.
00:14:33.836 - 00:14:49.028, Speaker A: The market continues to mature. Absolutely. Bimnet, abibi, Galaxy Digital trading, my friend, as always, thank you so much. Welcome to our guest, Eric Voorhees, founder and CEO of Shapeshift. I don't know if we can call it. Are you still a CEO now? Shapeshift's a dow. Eric, welcome.
00:14:49.196 - 00:14:57.428, Speaker C: No, I'm just an unemployed bum. I don't work anywhere anymore. So founder of Shapeshift is still accurate, but not CEO.
00:14:57.516 - 00:15:25.824, Speaker A: Interesting. So, Eric, before we dive in, we got a bunch of fun stuff we want to talk about. And just for our audience, that includes regulation, political philosophy, the future of crypto, bitcoin culture. But before we get into some of that stuff, let's talk about shapeshift. Tell us. I guess I don't want to say what it is because it's gone through so many iterations. So we'll get to what it is today, but maybe tell us how you started shapeshift and what it was originally.
00:15:27.124 - 00:16:24.164, Speaker C: Okay, so Shapeshift started in 2014. The idea came to me in the wake of Mount Gox, which collapsed and lost $400 million and almost destroyed the whole industry. It was like where 90% of all bitcoin trading happened back then, and it was abysmal. It was like a catastrophe. And I thought, why can't we make an exchange where we're not holding any customer money, or can that be done at all? This was obviously pre smart contracts, pre ethereum, so I ruminated on that a lot and tried to figure out a way to do it and realized it could be done. As long as you didn't worry about Fiat, as long as you weren't trying to do fiat to bitcoin, you could actually do crypto to crypto without custody. And that's the genesis of shapeshift.
00:16:24.164 - 00:17:09.864, Speaker C: It was essentially an exchange where you could trade one digital asset for another. You would send your asset to us, and we send you a different asset back. So we were an intermediary in the sense that we were part of the trade with you, but we weren't holding a balance of your coins ever. So if shapeshift ever got hacked, we can't lose more than a couple seconds worth of trade volume, which would be easily covered. So we called it, like, consumer protection by design, where it didn't matter how trustworthy we were, it didn't matter if our systems were breached. People didn't have to trust us because of the architecture of the application. So, yeah, that's where shapeshift got its start.
00:17:10.604 - 00:17:40.840, Speaker A: And I remember using shapeshift and it becoming pretty big in the sort of 20 1617 bull run. It was super convenient because, like you said, you would input a receiving address on one chain, and then you would send coins from to shapeshift's deposit address, and it was just sort of instant. How did, like, liquidity management work, though, on your side? You still had to have a bunch of assets sitting around ready to be sent at any moment, right?
00:17:40.912 - 00:18:14.482, Speaker C: Yeah, that was one of the largest challenges was that we were always the counterparty to the trade, so we had to hold an inventory of every asset. You can think of it like a vending machine. When a customer comes up to the vending machine and they want to buy their Snickers bar, you better have enough snickers bar in the machine to handle it. They put their money in, and the Snickers bar needs to come out. So, yeah, we did that with every coin, and it started simply enough. Bitcoin and litecoin were the two that we started with. But then as you get more and more, you start realizing that the system has to get pretty crazy.
00:18:14.482 - 00:19:06.684, Speaker C: And then, like, the. The pricing at which we're offering the assets has to be updating in real time based on the markets, or else people will screw us. And so there was a lot of inventory management and balancing during the really crazy volume periods. You would have issues of just inventory running out before confirmations would happen. So, like, if a bunch of bitcoins being bought, even if you still have the assets there, if they haven't confirmed on chain, then you got to wait. Things would get really backed up sometimes, and it was a really wild and crazy machine. There were people at the company that were having to wake up in the middle of the night multiple times just to move funds around, because we didn't have automated methods for these assets to move.
00:19:06.684 - 00:19:44.088, Speaker C: And as we built the automated methods, those introduced their own security concerns. Like, if you have a wallet that automatically sends money to another wallet whenever that one has run out, you can imagine an exploit that doesn't get figured out for 30 minutes even, and the entire wallet has gotten drained and some customer got tons of money that they shouldn't have gotten. One error that happened once was that an exchange rate got inverted. Instead of getting like ten assets for one that you input, you'd get one instead of ten. But it was in the user's favor. And so we had our entire wallet drained because someone realized it and took it all. Yeah.
00:19:44.088 - 00:19:45.320, Speaker C: And then just that kind of thing.
00:19:45.352 - 00:20:16.840, Speaker A: Happened all the time, transaction after transaction, until there was no more to send them. Yeah, it seems like a really, it's an interesting problem. I mean, obviously this is true for any principal dealer, basically, right, maintaining the appropriate inventory. But in the case of shapeshift, which is really an application, or at least looked like and felt like an application to the user. It's different if you're chatting with me and doing an OTC trade and we're like, hey, sorry, we got to replenish our inventory. We'll be back to you in 30 minutes. When the user is sitting there just seeing the thing spin, waiting for it, proposes unique challenges.
00:20:16.872 - 00:20:40.438, Speaker C: Yeah. And two thirds of the volume was just algorithmic coming over the API. When a machine makes a request, you need to deliver, and there's no weekends, there's no holidays, it was like, yeah, years and years of constant service, any disruption being a catastrophe. Yeah, it was stressful.
00:20:40.486 - 00:20:51.398, Speaker A: What kind of customers were using the API? Were there any other exchanges that were relying on shapeshift liquidity, or are we talking trade?
00:20:51.446 - 00:21:28.804, Speaker C: Not really exchanges. Not exchanges. We were customers of the exchanges. When a customer would trade with us, we'd be doing a inverse trade for the same trade at one of the exchanges based on their rates. But a lot of wallets plugged into us, non custodial wallets that wanted to let their users trade between these assets, they would plug into our API. Often their customers didn't even know how the trade was happening. It just worked magically in the background, and if our system went down that reflected poorly on the wallet partner, that relationship management was really important.
00:21:29.314 - 00:21:33.890, Speaker A: That's super interesting. All right, let's fast forward just a little bit, unless all you want. Oh, yeah.
00:21:33.922 - 00:21:52.858, Speaker E: I mean, actually, that's kind of a perfect segue, because what you've learned from having wallets integrate shapeshift is that, hey, maybe making a wallet is a good idea, and that's kind of what shapeshift evolved into over time. Yeah. So kind of, maybe we can go into the evolution of shapeshift's product just before we.
00:21:52.946 - 00:22:27.284, Speaker A: We're going to go into that. But real quick, I just want to raise this one. I remember this happened in 2017. The Wall Street Journal was doing some investigation of crypto in general, and I think they only, they claim they identified, like, 80 plus million dollars of illicit money laundering total, like, in crypto, of which a small percentage they blamed shapeshift for. What did you learn from that? What was your reaction to that? But also, how did that influence further, perhaps how you've decided to build shapeshift going forward from there?
00:22:30.024 - 00:23:15.964, Speaker C: Yeah, that was a painful story. So that was in late 2018, which I would say was our worst year ever in all manners. Like that imposed KYC and every customer left. The year when I felt like I had to compromise my very ethics just to move forward. The year when volumes declined by 99% and everything just sucked. And then these two journalists from the Wall Street Journal tricked me into meeting with them because they were doing an article about crypto and they wanted to learn about it. So I met with them for like, 2 hours downtown Denver.
00:23:15.964 - 00:23:55.904, Speaker C: And what they were actually after was just getting little tidbits about shapeshift. And they wrote a hit piece about us, basically alleging that we were, like, this dirty center for money laundering. And it was in the Wall Street Journal. It got huge, it was picked up very widely and caused immense suffering for our company. Like bank accounts getting closed down, like other businesses not working with us. Because there's this headline in the Wall Street Journal, and none of them are going to vet whether it's true or not. Like, you see the Wall Street Journal publish something and you kind of assume it's true because they have a reputation.
00:23:55.904 - 00:24:49.796, Speaker C: And the reason it was so awful is because it was wrong. Like, if you actually did any blockchain forensic work, you could tell that they were exaggerating risky flows of funds by two orders of magnitude. And so when they said there was, like, many millions of dollars of illicit flows going through shapeshift, when you actually look at the blockchain transactions and remove preposterous assumptions from that. It was like 1% of that. And the rate of suspicious flows in dollar value relative to our total volumes in actuality was less than what normal banks have. But none of that kind of context was provided in this article. It was just this hit piece that talked about how we worked out of this sketchy eighties era office building.
00:24:49.796 - 00:24:58.148, Speaker C: Yeah, they did say that downtown Denver, they said eighties era surrounded by pot dispensaries. Yeah, eighties era. Like every, every office building in Denver is eighties era.
00:24:58.236 - 00:24:58.604, Speaker E: Right.
00:24:58.684 - 00:25:00.412, Speaker C: It went through like an oil boom in the eighties.
00:25:00.468 - 00:25:03.104, Speaker A: And there's pot dispensaries everywhere in Denver as well.
00:25:03.804 - 00:25:22.016, Speaker C: Yeah. You can't work at an office in Denver without it being an eighties era office building surrounded by dispensaries. And we actually had a really nice office. Like, it was a beautiful place. And Sal here knows for the audience. Sal was an employee of shapeshift for a long time on the finance team and did great work. So Sal knows very well.
00:25:22.016 - 00:25:29.616, Speaker C: And I think we ended up calling our Wi Fi network, like eighties era. Oh, yeah, I remember that. Like, we just.
00:25:29.720 - 00:25:30.192, Speaker A: That's great.
00:25:30.248 - 00:25:46.838, Speaker C: Yeah. So it became a, it became a meme and kind of funny, but it was devastating to the company. It caused all sorts of legal trouble for us. And it was just flat out fraudulent reporting by the Wall Street Journal. I will never forgive them for it. We called them out. We had actual forensic work done that proved that they were wrong.
00:25:46.838 - 00:26:09.414, Speaker C: We told them this. We requested a retraction, and they never did. It was the first time I really realized how poisonous and fraudulent major media can be. Like, people always talk about that kind of thing, but this was a real experience with it where I knew the truth. And so, yeah, it hurt. So.
00:26:11.194 - 00:26:29.802, Speaker A: Then you move forward, though. I mean, you talked about how you added KYC to shapeshift. And I remember this was like, obviously everyone in crypto. I remember at the time on crypto, Twitter was like, they were aghast. And it's like, well, I mean, I don't know. There was no path forward without that. But then shapeshift shifted shape.
00:26:29.802 - 00:26:39.554, Speaker A: And I recall you became sort of a wallet and non custodial exchange a little bit different. What did you do next? What was the next iteration after?
00:26:39.594 - 00:26:40.210, Speaker C: Merely just.
00:26:40.282 - 00:26:40.894, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:41.434 - 00:27:18.158, Speaker C: So once we implemented KYC, it completely gutted the business. Like, for example, a machine can't KYC with you. So a wallet partner that has 100,000 users that are using you over the API, those users can't KYC through you. Like, you can't even get them through that flow in that mechanism. So those wallet partners just cut us off and went with other competitors that were using our same model but were not as worried about us regulation. So it just gutted everything. And as that happened, we're like, okay, like, our.
00:27:18.158 - 00:28:03.334, Speaker C: Our beautiful model that was. That people loved, that was protecting people because it didn't take their personal information, and it didn't hold. Their crypto had been gutted. What do we do? And so we reformed the product to be more of, like, a wallet interface itself, where people could interact with their hardware wallet or with the software wallet in the web platform. And it was a self custody wallet, like, via the web, and people could still trade through it as long as they had done KYC. So that was a big pivot. It took a lot of work and time in the company and most of 2018 just kind of rolling that out and into 2019, and that product never really caught on.
00:28:03.334 - 00:28:31.206, Speaker C: We struggled a lot and tried lots of different things, and it never really got the product market fit that shapeshift originally had. So it was really two or three years of just struggling through that. And, yeah, meanwhile, everyone in the world hating me because I had implemented Kyc and calling me a sellout, which didn't make any sense because I lost money by doing it. And it was like, the. Like, I didn't get anything by adding Kyc.
00:28:31.270 - 00:28:39.314, Speaker A: And, like, calling, like, I mean, calling Eric Voorhees like a statist is, like, maybe one of the most humorous oxymorons that you could come up with.
00:28:39.854 - 00:29:02.144, Speaker C: Yes, statist cuck became my. My nom de guerre on Twitter. So, yeah, it sucked. And, like, I don't. I'm not opposed to KYC just for convenience or business reasons. I'm opposed to it on ethical grounds. So to implement it, like, I was already feeling like I had compromised my principles deeply.
00:29:02.144 - 00:29:12.860, Speaker C: And then for the entire community, you know, my people, my tribe, to hate on me for it, uh, really, that was. That was hard, just from a personal perspective.
00:29:12.972 - 00:29:46.658, Speaker A: Yeah, I can imagine. And I remember the, um. The sort of wallet, non custodial. I'm gonna call it a non custodial Dex like, or non custodial exchange, sort of in the vein of actually a little bit like, what? IDex, I'm sure, you know, Alex and the team there over the years, it was similar, I recall, at least from my perspective. But this predated on chain amms and such and Defi as we know it. Right? I'm thinking of sort of like, ether Delta and Idec and shapeshift were sort of this, like, 20. I guess.
00:29:46.658 - 00:30:03.556, Speaker A: In the case of ether delta, it was even older than that. But we'll call it, like, the 2016 to 2020 non custodial options, and then that's changed a lot. So where are you now? Or what is the next evolution? The third shifting of the shape of shape shift?
00:30:03.620 - 00:30:34.824, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah. So after trudging around a while, not finding any success and feeling like I'd compromised my principles, there was something I can't talk about on this podcast. But it was, you know, yet another demand from a certain regulator. And this was a demand which reached even further into what I considered morally acceptable. I'm actually legally not even allowed to talk about it. Sal doesn't even know what this is.
00:30:34.824 - 00:31:15.272, Speaker C: But when it happened, I just fucking flipped. And I sort of had, like, a. I don't know, maybe like a John Galt moment of just realizing, like, I'm living in a world of looters here. I'm not going to play by their game, and I need to figure out how to get out of this box that they have put me in, because it's driving me crazy, and it's making everyone miserable, and it's horribly unethical. This was during the time when Uniswap had come out. This was maybe like, nine months, twelve months after uniswap. And when I learned about Uniswap and tried it, it was magic.
00:31:15.272 - 00:31:42.946, Speaker C: It was like all the magic that shapeshift had done years earlier, but done in a. In a truly decentralized way. And the shapeshift was not decentralized. It was an intermediary. So when you sent your litecoin in, it went to us, to our wallets, and we sent bitcoin back to you. Uniswap was a smart contract where not only was it non custodial, but it was not an intermediary. And I was like, how are they able to do this without KYC and just be.
00:31:42.946 - 00:32:17.312, Speaker C: I was. I was jealous. I was impressed and inspired and jealous by what they had built. So I really looked into that and learned a lot more about smart contracts, about Dexs, about Amms generally, and realized, like, okay, the way we get out of this is that we stopped trying to be an exchange altogether. We stopped being an intermediary to trades, because that is the regulated activity that has caught us up in all this KYC nonsense. But that also meant, like, our business model was gone, because that's how we made money is taking us a spread on those trades. But at this point, I was like, whatever.
00:32:17.312 - 00:33:02.472, Speaker C: What's more important to me is building something that people enjoy, that is beautiful, that is functional, that is ethical, and that I can be proud of. We'll figure out a business model somehow, but I'm not going to let that keep me in this prison. And so we realized we would stop being an exchange. We would plug into Dexs when someone wanted to do a trade through our interface or go through a Dex. And at first, the problem with that was that Dexs were only ethereum based, so you could only do ERC, 20 assets. Uniswap, cant trade bitcoin or any other chain thats not on Ethereum. So what do we do? We didnt want to just be an ethereum only company, but we knew that this was the direction.
00:33:02.472 - 00:33:45.514, Speaker C: And then a while after, we learned about Thor chain, which I have been a huge proponent of for a while, and Thor chain was essentially a Dex in the model of Uniswap, but worked across chains. And still, today is the only way you can actually trade in and out of bitcoin, for example, without wrapped assets, without any kind of proxy asset. With a combination of Uniswap and Thor chain, we realized we could do it and integrated both of those into the shapeshift interface. And once we did that, we then woke up even further, and we're like, how about we just decentralize the entire company? And like, I don't want to play this game at all. I don't want to. I don't want a corporation. I don't want formal employees.
00:33:45.514 - 00:34:14.612, Speaker C: I don't want to have to pay lawyers to tell me, like, which jurisdictions I need to be registering licenses for every day. All this stuff that is completely crushing my soul, I want none of it. And so we decided to decentralize the entire company into a DAO, an idea that I was skeptical of at first, but came to love. And that's what we spent 2021 doing. And as of 2022, Shapeshift has been a DaO. So it is run by a DaO. It's decentralized.
00:34:14.612 - 00:34:28.673, Speaker C: I am not the CEO of it anymore. It's not a company. It doesn't have employees. And it is getting progressively more decentralized, including front end being provided by ipfs and that kind of thing. And that's what we've been working on.
00:34:29.013 - 00:34:30.033, Speaker A: Very cool.
00:34:31.253 - 00:34:32.085, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:34:32.269 - 00:34:54.250, Speaker E: I had a few questions as we had this conversation about shapeshift and its evolution. And then one of them, kind of broadly, so obviously, shapeshift has transitioned into a dow. So much has happened in the market over the past year since shapeshift made that decision. Treasuries and dows are pretty flat or down just based on price movement.
00:34:54.322 - 00:34:55.130, Speaker C: Flats, generous.
00:34:55.202 - 00:35:28.184, Speaker E: Yeah, I guess I'm looking at top line number, which is, yeah, somewhat flat, but certainly dow by Dow, a lot of them are down a lot. So what are your thoughts currently on the state of Daos? I mean, a year ago, there was a lot of excitement around Dao tooling and a lot of funding going to them. I think a lot of that narrative has shifted, but certainly there are really long term novel use cases for daos. They are powerful, but we're in this, like, kind of trough of disillusionment. So what are your thoughts on what's happening with Daos right now?
00:35:29.724 - 00:35:53.058, Speaker C: Yeah, I think Daos being like a native crypto phenomenon follows the market patterns of the market generally. Like bitcoin and ETH are way down. Everything related to Daos is way down. Everything related to NFT is way down. Funding for crypto companies is down. The market cap of companies is down, like miners are down. The entire industry is just lawyers.
00:35:53.106 - 00:35:54.094, Speaker A: Lawyers are up.
00:35:55.114 - 00:36:18.374, Speaker C: Lawyers are up. They're always up. Lawyers always get bigger and more funding, that's for sure. But, yeah, dows are down because crypto and decentralized technology down. So I've been through enough of these cycles for that to not worry me. Interest in daos will flow from when bitcoin rises again in price. That correlation is.
00:36:18.374 - 00:36:19.754, Speaker C: Is close to one.
00:36:20.534 - 00:36:57.914, Speaker E: Right, right. I guess one of the issues that's perhaps exacerbated by having a native token and a Dao treasury is the exposure to the market cycles, as you're alluding to. I noticed some proposals recently in shapeshifts, governance forms incorporating, or maybe they're actually in production now, protocols like arbor finance, hourglass, that kind of make the financial side of running an organization as a Dao a bit easier. Obviously, they can't have a bank account. They can't maybe get a loan from a bank. Right. What are your views on treasury management and access to things like credit for DAO organizations?
00:36:59.094 - 00:37:55.740, Speaker C: Yeah, this is where some really exciting innovation is happening. So, yeah, the shapeshift DAO has no bank account and never will, thank goodness. I don't care how many articles the Wall Street Journal writes, a smart contract that holds the treasury's assets is not going to shut us down in that statement alone is like a very powerful truth. And so, yeah, the assets are held in a multisig arrangement that are controlled by the DAO members. And there are other, let's call them DaO, service providers that try to come up with interesting tooling and financial products that daos can use. So one of the ones that was bigger earlier in the year, late last year, was Tokamak, which basically allowed us to post a bunch of shapeshifts, fox tokens, and earn yield on it. And there's another one called Rari, where we were able to borrow against our assets natively.
00:37:55.740 - 00:38:45.264, Speaker C: So these things are all super experimental, but what's cool is just the collaboration between these daos. There's no contracts between them, there's no longer business development process, there's no lawyers involved. It's like these communities, which are transparent, can offer their services to each other, and can use them openly and permissionlessly. It's like a totally different way of collaborating between organizations. It's really cool. It's very dynamic. There are no gatekeepers at shapeshift when it was a corporation, if there's a good idea or some partnership that someone thought was wise, the number of gatekeepers it would have to pass through to get approved was many.
00:38:45.264 - 00:39:07.144, Speaker C: These include lawyers who don't at all care about what the customers want. These include all different kinds of interests. And in a DAO, any part of the DAO can just make something happen, and if they need funds, they can ask for approval, and there's no single gatekeeper. And it just creates this very different dynamic of human organization that I think we're just starting to scratch. Absolutely.
00:39:07.224 - 00:39:59.504, Speaker E: I actually wrote about Daos a year ago, and that's one of the points I tried to make, is like, hey, an individual DaO certainly can't do everything, but when you start to compose daos with other daos that each focus on a specific business model or use case, then you could start to replace entire pieces of infrastructure over the long term. And that's kind of what I see this space looking like in the next five to ten years. Maybe shapeshift does the wallet, maybe entire Dao just understands how to underwrite loans for wallet providers and can handle that entire use case and work with smart contracts and without. To your point, the human layer, that often makes this type of collaboration just way more difficult. In introducing jurisdictions where there's different laws that need to be recognized. That's kind of like, I think, where daos have gained a lot of traction over the past year, and it's certainly an exciting vector.
00:40:01.164 - 00:40:35.872, Speaker C: Yeah. One clear example of this is like anyone who's worked or run a company knows how horrible like, HR is generally for a number of reasons. But in a civil world, if a person wants to work with someone else, they talk and one of them makes an offer under some terms and the other person can accept it or leave it. And if they accept it, then the two people work together. That's like mutual voluntary interaction. That's not actually how it works. In the corporate world.
00:40:35.872 - 00:41:29.452, Speaker C: You have to follow dozens and dozens and dozens of rules. It depends on which jurisdiction you're in. The hiring process is full of pitfalls. The firing process can be impossible, like it's nearly impossible to fire people in certain jurisdictions in the world. For example, shapeshift decided years ago never to hire another person in the entire country of France, because to fire someone in France is so expensive and takes so long that it's never even worth it to hire someone there in the first place. So imagine there's like, you know, that there must be many millions of very talented people in the entire country of France, and we're just going to ignore all of that talent because of some stupid law that the government made over there that's meant to protect people and actually only hurts them. And all of that nonsense is completely washed away in Dow world.
00:41:29.452 - 00:41:57.200, Speaker C: If the Dow wants to work with someone in France, they put out a proposal and someone says, yeah, I'll do it. And the payments are all happening just from the treasury. And it's just so civil and clean and efficient and beautiful, and it's such a difference from the corporate HR world. It really inspired me and it, like brought hope back to my heart that society is actually going to work out.
00:41:57.352 - 00:42:39.214, Speaker A: Quick break for our listeners. We'll get back to Eric in a second. And we will talk about bitcoin culture, Sam Bankman, Creed and FTO, and Eric's debate with them and much more. But before we do that, we've got a poll pinned to our profile on Twitter GLXY research. And the poll reads, Sam Bagman Freed is charged with crimes by the southern district of New York. The US attorney there that could, if he's found guilty on all crimes, carry a maximum sentence of 165 years. The question for you, our audience, is how many, how many years will Sam Bankman freed end up spending in jail? Hit us up on Twitter glxyresearch and make your voice heard.
00:42:39.214 - 00:43:30.404, Speaker A: Now back to the interview with Eric. Welcome back. We're still here with Eric Voorhees, founder and Dow member of Shapeshift. We talked a lot about shapeshift and stuff, but let's talk about something that was really, really interesting. Sam Bankman Freed, obviously, the now handcuffed founder and former CEO of FTX.com comma, he put out in October a sort of blog on the principles that regulatory principles that FTX and he believed in. It was sort of on the back of the introduction of the DCCPA in the Senate, which is a bill that Sam worked a lot on, which was a comprehensive framework for the regulation of digital assets in the United States, which gave up a lot of the sort of leaned CFTC and the sort of commodity versus securities battle.
00:43:30.404 - 00:44:05.324, Speaker A: And we were actually extremely critical, we galaxy digital research of Sam's proposals in our newsletter. But by far the most comprehensive and thoughtful rebuttal came from you, Eric. You wrote a great blog about it, which we'll drop the link in the show notes to recommend. Everyone ready? Even more interesting was that you debated Sam about these topics on a bankless podcast exactly 14 days before Sam filed for bankruptcy and left FTX. What was that like, just in general, that experience? A lot of this went viral, and we'll play a clip or two from it in a minute.
00:44:06.984 - 00:44:28.310, Speaker C: Yeah, so when I wrote the blog, it was like a day after he put out his thing. And I feel very protective of the industry and particularly like, the principles that I think are important. So many people get caught up in the lambos and the dogecoin memes, which are fun, but that's not really why we're here.
00:44:28.382 - 00:44:28.998, Speaker A: Right.
00:44:29.166 - 00:44:56.570, Speaker C: And I wanted to use that opportunity to just like, remind everyone why we're here. We're not trying to build the same financial system that already exists. And so I responded to Sam with that blog. It was quite well received. And the bankless guys thought, well, let's put together a debate between Eric and Sam. And that was, I guess, a week later or something. Yeah, it's really surreal.
00:44:56.570 - 00:45:57.364, Speaker C: I listened to the debate again a few days ago, the first time I've heard it since all this went down, and it had a different air to it. I mean, essentially the issue is that, well, at that time, the issue was that Sam has been in Washington lobbying, and I'll use the accurate term, bribing politicians on how to regulate crypto. And in particular, he was willing to accept the licensure of front ends for DeFi so long as the areas of other regulations were done in a way that he liked. And this was like a complete non starter to me, that everything that is good about Defi dies if it falls under a licensing regime. And we can get into why that's true, but that's really the crux of the debate. And, yeah, it was, like, two and a half hours. I was a little disappointed in Sam's performance on that debate.
00:45:57.364 - 00:46:29.244, Speaker C: I mean, he, at the time, he was, like, one of the most successful CEO's founders in crypto history. He had built an incredible company at the time. This is, like, what everyone thought. And so I was expecting him to be, I don't know, impressive in some way, and he wasn't. He kind of just crumpled under an onslaught of. Of a dedication principle.
00:46:29.324 - 00:46:29.988, Speaker A: He really did.
00:46:30.036 - 00:46:31.180, Speaker C: Yeah. Which felt good.
00:46:31.292 - 00:46:39.404, Speaker A: Let's, let's, let's pause for a second. Let me play one of the clips that went viral where Sam is talking about the regulation of Defi, front ends, and you push back.
00:46:39.524 - 00:46:50.668, Speaker D: If that did mean that, like, essentially front ends by american targeting, american retail had to be licensed, I think that could be reasonable, which is that if.
00:46:50.796 - 00:46:57.180, Speaker C: The question was, let's. Let's acknowledge that the email protocol will be permissionless as a protocol.
00:46:57.252 - 00:46:57.660, Speaker D: Yep.
00:46:57.732 - 00:47:03.828, Speaker C: But it was the law of the land in America that every email front end provider required KYC from its users.
00:47:03.876 - 00:47:04.292, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:47:04.388 - 00:47:11.756, Speaker C: Because under the justification that we do not want people sending information back and forth with terrorists. Where would you stand on that position?
00:47:11.860 - 00:47:14.540, Speaker D: Oh, I'd be strongly against that position, I think.
00:47:14.612 - 00:47:14.940, Speaker C: Why?
00:47:15.012 - 00:47:33.408, Speaker D: Why would I be against it? Because I think that. I think it'd be, like, against freedom of speech. I think it'd be disenfranchising a lot of people. I think I would not trust in practice that it would do a good job. So I agree with you on all of that. I'm making a distinction here between, for instance, payments versus, like, derivatives contracts.
00:47:33.536 - 00:47:36.564, Speaker C: Why is aave somehow different than email?
00:47:36.904 - 00:47:40.684, Speaker D: So why is it different than email?
00:47:41.344 - 00:47:54.094, Speaker C: You argued so well and so passionately to not block email with licensing in KYC. I loved hearing that. That filled my soul with joy. Such good arguments. Why does that not apply to financial transactions?
00:47:54.594 - 00:48:00.014, Speaker D: So why does it not apply to financial transactions?
00:48:01.514 - 00:48:17.574, Speaker A: Okay, so, I mean, it's pretty clear to your point before Eric, and obviously, the sort of point that you made clear in that debate, that Sam really had no understanding of the underlying ethos behind decentralization and crypto general.
00:48:18.954 - 00:48:22.738, Speaker C: No, I think he revealed himself as a tourist.
00:48:22.866 - 00:48:23.410, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:48:23.522 - 00:48:24.250, Speaker C: Debate.
00:48:24.402 - 00:48:27.614, Speaker A: He's a traditional finance trader guy.
00:48:27.994 - 00:48:42.138, Speaker C: Yep. Yeah. And. And there's many of those types in the industry, and there's nothing necessarily wrong with that. What's wrong with it is if those types go to Washington and start inviting down regulations on the rest of us, then I have a big problem with it.
00:48:42.186 - 00:49:08.774, Speaker A: I hear you. I think. But that was so strange, too, actually, I think, in him being so unimpressive on it. It's one thing if he believes that, that there's a difference between speech and finance. You know, you can have a. But he couldn't even really articulate it, which is just shocking. Like, you're out here spending millions of dollars and tons of time on political lobbying for financial regulation, and you can't make the case for it.
00:49:10.494 - 00:49:59.326, Speaker C: Well, I didn't want to be cynical on the debate with him, but he is advocating for laws that benefit running a centralized exchange. So his principles are what is helpful to FTX, which is to get thorough, comprehensive crypto regulation that doesn't infringe on how FTX operates to too much. That's his principle. That is very different than a moral or ethical principle of how people should be able to interact with money and finance. And everyone who cares about crypto for the right reasons knows those principles. Like, this is why we're building these things to be permissionless and stateless and borderless and immutable. It's because of a set of moral foundational principles.
00:49:59.326 - 00:50:10.406, Speaker C: And Sam just had no conception of that, hadn't thought about it. And I think that's why he just kind of collapsed in front of being confronted with a consistent moral philosophy.
00:50:10.470 - 00:50:56.820, Speaker A: Well, and it doesn't surprise knowing what we know now, which is that in that video, he's sitting there completely insolvent, actually had already traveled to the Middle east, supposedly to try to raise money. And also, I mean, a lack of moral foundation for crypto. Well, he also appears to have stolen billions of dollars from people, including us, which we have said. So I guess not totally surprising. Just as a follow up here, Eric, obviously, that was terrible FTX. And when I look at the DC CPA, which he proposed, I don't really see anything in there that would have actually prevented Sam's theft. Now, perhaps regular examinations by a regulator would have made it less likely, et cetera.
00:50:56.820 - 00:51:09.700, Speaker A: But what is the view, what do we do as an industry to prevent that from happening again at a centralized place like FTX, regulatory or otherwise?
00:51:09.732 - 00:51:21.812, Speaker C: Yeah. So it's worth backing up and reasserting what the actual crime here was, which is stealing a bunch of customer money that is already illegal.
00:51:21.948 - 00:51:22.460, Speaker A: Right.
00:51:22.572 - 00:51:33.614, Speaker C: Right. We don't need another law to tell us that stealing customer money is illegal. So it's not like there was some loophole in the law, and we just need to close that loophole and fix a bunch of.
00:51:33.734 - 00:51:34.526, Speaker A: I mean, we know that, right?
00:51:34.550 - 00:51:35.846, Speaker C: Because they did is already illegal.
00:51:35.870 - 00:51:38.794, Speaker A: They've charged him now with crimes. So. Yeah.
00:51:39.374 - 00:51:59.830, Speaker C: Right. Yeah. And of course, it didn't prevent the crime. It just will now drag. It just make a bunch of lawyers super wealthy over the next three or five years. So we have these laws and so many of them. Like, if anyone doesn't believe me, go try to find all the financial laws that exist just in the US.
00:51:59.830 - 00:52:47.246, Speaker C: There's like 20 different agencies. Well, actually more than that, because every state has its own agencies as well. So dozens of agencies, hundreds of thousands of pages of regulation, thousands of laws, thousands of bureaucrats enforcing these things. We do not have, like, a dearth of regulation in this industry, and still a $10 billion fraud occurs. If you care about helping people, you should look at that and realize maybe the entire model of how we try to create order in finance is flawed. Right? We have these squishy rules written down by politicians and regulators. They are subjectively enforced, sometimes in certain ways, and sometimes they catch some portion of the bad guys.
00:52:47.246 - 00:53:26.448, Speaker C: This has been status quo. And I don't think anyone looks back at the history of finance in the US and feels like it is this pristine example of highly regulated markets that don't have substantial crime. Like, it happens all the time. The entire global financial crisis occurred in part because of some of this stuff. So let's acknowledge that, like, the status quo system ain't great. And let's realize then that there's actually an alternative started by bitcoin, which is that you build decentralized, immutable code to run how finance works. And it is not enforced subjectively.
00:53:26.448 - 00:53:46.242, Speaker C: It's actually enforced equally across the entire world. It doesn't require any politicians at all. It doesn't require any tax money. It doesn't try to capture some of the bad guys after they've committed bad acts. It prevents bad acts from happening entirely. It operates as the code is written. And this is extremely powerful.
00:53:46.242 - 00:54:28.024, Speaker C: The entire reason bitcoin is cool is because no one can change the rules of bitcoin. It's this equal, open, objective, transparent system for base money for the world. And you can extend that principle into smart contracts and defi. This is an incredible alternative, not just for the crypto anarchists like myself, who want people to be more free, but actually for people who want law and order. If you want transparent markets that operate according to set rules, this is the technology to do it. They should be celebrating this stuff. That's the message I've been trying to convey in the wake of Sam's nonsense.
00:54:28.804 - 00:54:41.810, Speaker A: Excellent and extremely well said, Eric. Let's talk about bitcoin a little bit. I recall. I mean, look, you've been in bitcoin a long time. I'm going to ask you about some og things.
00:54:41.842 - 00:54:43.534, Speaker C: You worked at bitcoin 200 years?
00:54:44.794 - 00:54:57.282, Speaker A: 200 bitcoin years, at least, probably. What are we at in the 700,000? I'm just going to make this up, but you've probably been into bitcoin since block 100,000. Interesting.
00:54:57.378 - 00:54:59.710, Speaker C: Not sure. Yeah. May of 2011.
00:54:59.882 - 00:55:12.674, Speaker A: May 2011. Well, how did you find out about bitcoin, then, in May of 2011? What? Like, I mean, I know you were predisposed to this because, like you said, you call yourself a crypto anarchist. You're. You've long been a libertarian, but how'd you find out about it?
00:55:13.734 - 00:55:18.834, Speaker C: Yeah, and I'm not quite an anarchist. I would just say I'm anarcho sympathetic.
00:55:19.974 - 00:55:20.806, Speaker E: Nice.
00:55:20.990 - 00:55:26.382, Speaker C: I just like the government to get smaller, like 1% smaller. We try that. I don't think that's ever got a little smaller.
00:55:26.438 - 00:55:26.862, Speaker A: That's never.
00:55:26.918 - 00:56:07.684, Speaker C: I don't think so. So, yeah, I saw a Facebook post from a friend. It was when I was in New Hampshire for the free state project, and a friend of mine who then ended up becoming a state representative in New Hampshire, he posted about bitcoin, this article. And when I saw it, I went through this cycle of dismissal and like, oh, that looks dumb, and how would that work? And then within a couple hours and a couple more articles, I was like, oh, my God, this is the most incredible invention I've ever seen. A form of money beyond state control that no one can turn off. This has a number of reasons it could fail, but if it doesn't fail, it's taken over the world. So that was my entry into the rabbit hole.
00:56:07.764 - 00:56:39.324, Speaker A: Very cool. But I want to play one thing I remember just recently, it was the first conference, I think, basically globally, after the COVID lockdowns. This is bitcoin 2021, and it was in. I can't remember. I think it was in early June in Miami. And you moderated a panel that followed, a panel that was all about toxic bitcoin maximalism and why it was good. And I want to play a clip just of how you started your panel.
00:56:39.864 - 00:56:54.104, Speaker C: So, before we begin, did I hear someone in that prior panel say, if you're against toxic maximalism, you are against bitcoin and you're against freedom? Yeah, that's some bullshit.
00:57:03.244 - 00:57:30.594, Speaker A: So, Eric, you said it was bullshit what the prior person had said. And you were booed by the bitcoin crowd at Miami, bitcoin 2021. Not egregiously, but audibly. What do you make of that? What is this current bitcoin only culture that exists as sort of a subset of bitcoin culture overall? How do you view that today?
00:57:31.814 - 00:58:27.914, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, what was bullshit was that they were saying that if you didn't express like, a toxic degree of maximalism, then you were anti bitcoin a and b anti freedom, which was like just the most propagandistic nonsense I've heard. And so I had to call it out when I came up on stage to do the subsequent panel. And it was sad, because I heard, before I got up on the panel, I heard the crowd cheering for that statement. And this is not like, this is not the bitcoin that I learned about. This is not a principles first bitcoin, shall we say. The principles of bitcoin are what matter far more than bitcoin. The principles are decentralization, immutability, borderlessness, stateless money, and the ability of any person in the world to interact openly with a neutral financial system.
00:58:27.914 - 00:58:55.334, Speaker C: That's what matters. And I love bitcoin because it expresses those principles. There are other crypto based systems which also express those principles. Not in the same way, not always, as well as bitcoin in some ways, but sometimes better. Like, for example, I care about financial privacy. Og bitcoiners cared about financial privacy. One of the cool things about bitcoin is that it's far more private than banks in certain ways.
00:58:55.334 - 00:59:38.604, Speaker C: And now we have other blockchains like Monero or Zcash, that are actually anonymous. That's super cool. So, of course, if I like bitcoin based on its principles, I'm going to like those things too. And this whole cohort of maximalists, most of whom got involved, like in 2017 or later, I think they joined because they have like an insecurity about themselves and they want a tribe to fit in with. And so they repeat these slogans about bitcoin without actually believing or understanding the principles. Like, a lot of these people were probably the ones that dismissed and made fun of bitcoin, if they even heard about it back in 2012 or 2013, and then they joined the bandwagon, when it's a bandwagon and when it's cool to do so. And I just, I hate seeing the culture get poisoned by such people.
00:59:38.604 - 00:59:52.004, Speaker C: So that's why I called that out. And a lot of bitcoiners aren't maximalists. You know, I think it's a minority position within that group, but it's a very loud one and it's one that I don't support and I don't want to see.
00:59:52.164 - 01:00:36.246, Speaker A: Eric, let's go back a bit, because I really value your perspective on that because like we said, you've been in bitcoin a long time. You were the head of marketing at Bit Instant, which was the, called a bitcoin brokerage founded by Charlie Schremm, which the Winklevosses, I think, eventually let a financing round in at one point, bit instant, I think Charlie shut down. And I think Charlie was arrested for some basically Kyc AML, like lack of controls or something like that. I don't think he served time. I think he maybe served probation. Did he go in to jail?
01:00:36.430 - 01:00:38.926, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, he was in jail for close to two years.
01:00:38.950 - 01:00:39.294, Speaker A: Oh, geez.
01:00:39.334 - 01:00:39.846, Speaker C: A year and a half.
01:00:39.870 - 01:00:40.510, Speaker A: I forgot that.
01:00:40.542 - 01:00:41.994, Speaker C: And I thought he was.
01:00:42.844 - 01:01:11.494, Speaker A: So he really bore the cross for this KYC, for the bank Secrecy act. But what was it like back then? Selling bitcoin versus selling it, say, today? And by selling it, I mean, you know, promoting it, but also operating a business that, you know, is involved in the exchange of assets for bitcoin. Like, I mean, just. That's a long time. That's eleven years ago. Like, were there more were big either on bitcoiners or the market or. Just tell us what it was like back then.
01:01:12.674 - 01:01:42.764, Speaker C: It was exciting. So few people knew about bitcoin. Like, if you get in a random car back then, I remember taking taxis or ubers, which was also new back then, around New York City with Charlie, and theyd ask us what we did and wed say we help people buy bitcoin. And that word wasnt even common enough for people to know what we meant. And theyd, like, they'd say what? Like they didn't understand the word. No one. No one knew what bitcoin was on the street.
01:01:42.764 - 01:02:18.874, Speaker C: And even people in finance who had learned about it, you know, mostly dismissed it. There were very few professionals of any kind that cared about it. The professionals who had heard about it, dismissed it, or told us why it wouldn't work. And it just felt like we were helping to grow this little seed of something that could completely change the world before anyone acknowledged it was even a thing. So there's a lot of excitement to it. It was very fulfilling and fun, and I treasure that time immensely. What happened to Charlie was horrible.
01:02:18.874 - 01:02:51.274, Speaker C: He didn't do anything wrong. What he did was he sold bitcoin to a guy who told Charlie that he was then selling it on to other people using Silk Road. So Charlie got in trouble because he made a voluntary economic transaction with an individual, and that individual made other transactions with people who were voluntarily deciding to take drugs. Nothing that Charlie did was immoral or unethical, and it was unethical for him to be imprisoned for a year and a half.
01:02:51.424 - 01:03:15.274, Speaker A: Based on that, you also, I guess, a little bit later, created Satoshi dice, which, at the time, a lot of interesting stuff about Satoshi dice. First of all, a dice game that used randomness from the bitcoin blockchain as an input into its functioning. What was Satoshi dice?
01:03:17.894 - 01:03:58.583, Speaker C: So, Satoshi dice was a simple gambling game where there were several bitcoin addresses, and anyone could send bitcoin to one of those addresses with specific odds for winning. The expected value or return of all of the odds was the same, but it would have different odds of winning or losing. So one might be 50 50 odds that you win. And if you win, you get, like, you know, just a little bit more or just a little bit less than double your money back. Another one would be, like, you know, one in a thousand chance that you'll win. Another one was, like, 99% chance that you win, but you only win a little tiny bit when you do. And bit.
01:03:58.583 - 01:04:35.742, Speaker C: It was super cool because it was a demonstration of the power of bitcoin in two ways. One was anyone in the world could send transactions to this thing, and there was no jurisdictional component at all. Bitcoin from any country could go to Satoshi dice, and winnings would be paid back to the person. This was, like, a couple years after the whole takedown of the online poker world. And that was all taken down based not on poker being illegal, but based on laws against using the banking system for gambling. And this completely surpassed the entire banking system. So that was super cool.
01:04:35.742 - 01:05:25.934, Speaker C: But also, it proved like, it was called provable fairness. And basically, after you did your bets, you could mathematically prove that the role was correct and that the odds were what we said they were. This was important as a business because people from all over the world didn't really know me or trust me, nor should they have to. They could simply trust the math, which was published, and people could check it and know that the bets were fair. So if you think about this, you take the entire, like, city of Las Vegas with all this gambling. Nearly none of it tells you what the odds are of any specific game. And even if they did, you wouldn't know that that was true, right? Even if there's a sticker that says the odds of this are x, you can't verify that.
01:05:25.934 - 01:05:33.026, Speaker C: And it's all licensed, right? It's all under the Nevada gaming commission. And all sorts of regulations are followed to protect people.
01:05:33.050 - 01:05:43.382, Speaker A: And there's a whole history, by the way, of, like, you know, even, like, think about the godfather, right? Of, like, corruption involved in that process as well. In Nevada.
01:05:43.478 - 01:06:05.438, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. And people still appeal to the government to protect the gaming industry, and it's a bunch of nonsense. And me, you know, this. This guy that really doesn't know much about. And it was mathematically provable that it was fair. I didn't need a license to do it. I didn't need some government bureaucrat, like, attesting to anything.
01:06:05.438 - 01:06:27.584, Speaker C: I could prove it with math. And this was, like, a profound, a profound advancement. And it was emblematic of just the trust that you can build using these decentralized systems. And so, yeah, I was very proud of that. And it became. It got totally carried away. Like, it was half of all the bitcoin transactions for the first few years.
01:06:27.624 - 01:06:44.124, Speaker A: That's actually what I want to ask. That's where I want to take this conversation, because at the time, there were some people who said that it was sort of an. I don't know if the right characterization is it was an illegitimate use of the bitcoin blockchain or that these Satoshi dice transactions could even be considered scam. Sorry. Spam.
01:06:45.384 - 01:06:46.256, Speaker C: Yep.
01:06:46.440 - 01:06:47.216, Speaker A: First of all, I doubt.
01:06:47.240 - 01:06:48.408, Speaker C: Yeah, I got a lot of flack for that.
01:06:48.456 - 01:06:50.376, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. What was that like?
01:06:50.400 - 01:06:53.688, Speaker C: Yeah, well, it was weird because, like.
01:06:53.776 - 01:06:55.144, Speaker A: You'Re paying transaction fees.
01:06:55.224 - 01:07:17.580, Speaker C: Point of. Yeah. Like, put it a different way. Satoshi dice was the primary funding of all bitcoin mining. It was more than half of all the bitcoin mining revenue for the first several years of bitcoins existence. I was using the chain for this game and paying to use it. Of course, anyone on bitcoin should be allowed to use the chain if they're paying the fees to use it.
01:07:17.580 - 01:07:27.432, Speaker C: That shouldn't even be controversial. It doesn't matter what you're doing or how you're doing it. If you're paying for the resource, you're playing by the rules that everyone. But there were some people that were very pissed off about.
01:07:27.508 - 01:08:03.194, Speaker A: Yeah. And it's been historically controversial. Subsequently on other times, there was, you know, of course, tether when it was running on the omni layer, but then there was something like, I think it was called Vera block. Somebody had made an application that would peg or checkpoint into bitcoin by publishing its own block headers onto bitcoin. And that created a huge spike in transactions, like in 17 and 18 and 19, which you can witness, like Oprah turn transactions. And people were mad about that. But of course, these also pay transaction fees.
01:08:03.194 - 01:08:48.994, Speaker A: But I want to use this as a segue to ask you about developing bitcoin itself. Shapeshift was a signatory of the DCG New York agreement, quote unquote, letter in 2017, which argued for a block size increase. Of course, for those who don't know, we actually got an effective block size increase through segwit by itself anyway. But why was that? But also taking into account, say, the block space used by Satoshi Dice, do you still think a block size increase will happen over time, or needs to happen? Or what else would you like to see bitcoin do going forward itself, from a development standpoint?
01:08:51.974 - 01:09:21.116, Speaker C: Yeah, that was a difficult time, too. Today, I don't think bitcoin will increase its block size at all anymore. I think that argument is done and over. Bitcoin has ossified in that way. It has its attributes. Other chains optimize on that question of throughput at the chain layer, and I'm okay with that. Bitcoin is working.
01:09:21.116 - 01:10:10.256, Speaker C: It's successful. It's growing. I think it's okay. Back when that whole debate was happening, what was driving me crazy was for years, the community was just tearing itself apart, arguing over this question of should the blocks ever get bigger or not, in my opinion, causing serious distraction. And it was preventing us from moving forward onto other important things. And there were periods of time when, like, the fees were getting so outrageous that, like, users were just literally leaving. And I remember once shapeshift, as it received transactions and sent transactions, it would have to, like, move its wallets around and recombine wallets.
01:10:10.256 - 01:10:58.794, Speaker C: And at the peak, in, like, late 2017, we had to do what was called a wallet migration. And we paid, and we were having to do this every few days, mind you. We had to pay six or $700,000 of fees to migrate our bitcoin wallets. And the next few days was another couple hundred thousand dollars. And that spike dropped off quickly, but it was getting really bad. And so anyway, the New York agreement was essentially an attempt at compromise. It was people that were cool with Segwit, which I was, and I wanted Segwit to be activated, and it was people that were cool with a modest not an infinite, but a modest base block size increase other than Segwit.
01:10:58.794 - 01:12:04.814, Speaker C: So it ended up becoming called Segwit two x, meaning a combination of Segwit being activated and a doubling of the block size. And before it could activate, some group of people who, I still don't know, forked bitcoin to create bitcoin cash. And what that did was take everyone who was, like, wanting to get the larger base block size suddenly moved over to bitcoin cash and completely gutted the whole point of Segwit two x compromise, which was to prevent a chain split. So bitcoin cash caused the chain split, and then the whole point of it kind of fell apart. And at the time, I was really sad because the community of bitcoiners was so at odds with each other and there was so much vitriol, and I was hoping that it could be resolved and that, like, one chain would continue with that entire community together. But that's not what ended up happening. We got a split, we got bitcoin cash, and then, you know, the rest is history.
01:12:04.814 - 01:12:27.694, Speaker C: So I'm at peace with it at this point. I think the worst part about it was just, like, how shitty a lot of the bitcoiners were to each other. Not being willing to, like, just discuss the points as reasonable people that cared about this important technology, but just the vilification of it was really disheartening and horrible. And there's still scars from that, you know, today, for sure.
01:12:30.304 - 01:13:04.980, Speaker A: Yeah, it was definitely a contentious time period, and we know now, too, that bitcoin cash, I'm pretty confident in just declaring it mostly a failure, but we didn't really know. Even after, in August 2017, when Segwit enacted and BCH split off, there was a few weeks and even a couple months where actually wasn't totally obvious that BTC would remain bitcoin and bitcoin cash would be relegated to this minority fork.
01:13:05.132 - 01:13:51.604, Speaker C: Yeah. And I think also one thing that wasn't appreciated by, really, anyone back then is that the thing which ended up leaving the congestion issue in large part, as the industry grew, was other chains. If you think about the sum total of crypto payments, the number of USDC or tether payments that happen today, I'm sure, dwarfs the number of bitcoin transactions that was happening back then. Those all happen on the ethereum chain. So the bitcoin chain is doing its own thing, and many transactions that people need to do just end up on other chains. This is something I was trying to avoid. Because I wanted bitcoin to be the center of everything where, where everything was happening, but it didn't work out that way.
01:13:51.604 - 01:14:01.380, Speaker C: And it's okay. Other chains have satisfied demand in the market, and I see these things as great compliments, and it's worked out all right.
01:14:01.572 - 01:14:25.514, Speaker E: One quick follow up on that, because I've been involved in bitcoin for a while too, and I at the time thought it would be the center of everything. And now we're kind of on this inevitable path where perhaps Ethereum would flip it and is powering all the payments use cases as well as the Dapps. So what are your guys view on the exact role? How would you articulate bitcoin's role in the long term given this path we're on?
01:14:27.094 - 01:15:16.764, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, bitcoin's role is like a stateless base money that isn't trying to do a lot of complicated stuff. It's very conservative, it's very stable. It's been around longer than anything, and it works for that. And so that's great. Will it continue to be used as base money in a world where Ethereum or a similar smart contract platform ends up being much larger in terms of transaction volume? Maybe, I don't know. But for now it works. And I like the juxtaposition of the conservative bitcoin chain that does little with the crazy Ethereum chain that does a lot and is more reckless.
01:15:16.764 - 01:15:33.084, Speaker C: I see virtue in both of those paths. I'm glad that we have both things. I wouldn't want a world where there was just bitcoin moving slowly, and I wouldn't want a world where bitcoin had been abandoned and everyone was on ETH that was moving somewhat recklessly. I think both are good, and I see the virtue on both sides.
01:15:33.484 - 01:15:57.652, Speaker A: Yeah, that's, I think, really well said. I think that's also the path that we are on. I will say there's a couple caveats that I have, which is one is that there is lightning, which I think for fast payments could be good. But again, right now that's just wallet to wallet, essentially, person to person bitcoin payments. It's not application to application payments.
01:15:57.748 - 01:15:58.004, Speaker C: Right.
01:15:58.044 - 01:16:03.054, Speaker A: Yet, because there's not applications there chain. So there's limitations.
01:16:04.634 - 01:16:21.146, Speaker C: And it's interesting, like my issue with lightning, as much as I like it in principle, is that the apps which have become well known and used with a reasonable frequency are like actually financial intermediaries with KYC.
01:16:21.210 - 01:16:21.866, Speaker A: Right.
01:16:22.050 - 01:16:23.694, Speaker C: Actually, this is where the.
01:16:24.034 - 01:16:24.770, Speaker A: No, just. You're right.
01:16:24.802 - 01:16:55.904, Speaker C: This is where the bitcoin community has. Yeah, most of them, the bitcoin community has completely ignored this, which is, again, because they've forgotten principle. The bitcoin maximalist community is more, far more likely to celebrate and applaud a KYC intermediary lightning app than it is to celebrate and applaud Monero. There's something so deeply wrong with that. Yeah. And yet I'm called the shitcoiner because I hold that opinion on these maxis.
01:16:57.724 - 01:18:00.664, Speaker E: I agree with a lot of the points you guys made, and as a guy who loves bitcoin and still thinks it's a very safe bet, my only fear with this, and I see it mostly with newer entrants into crypto, even like all these new NFT users that never touched defi before, is that you really only need Ethereum at the base level. You can kind of do all your dgen stuff, whether it's buying other ERC, 20s nfts and you kind of sweep it back into USDC or ETH. And like, in many ways, bitcoin is definitely not required to power that entire lifecycle of user experience in decentralized crypto finance applications, what have you. It almost feels like bitcoin is like this really loud, opinionated, separate group that has very little interoperability other than you can cross chain with Thor swap or a centralized exchange. That's really the only ways I know of to bridge bitcoin into ETH and back and forth or other chains. I mean, is there any fear that you guys have were kind of on this path and maybe bitcoin's role gets diminished over time?
01:18:02.764 - 01:18:57.486, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm a little worried about it, but the Zen part of me remembers that what actually matters is the principles here, not the specific coins. What I care about is that stateless money takes over the world, and I don't care if that's bitcoin or Ethereum or something still uninvented. At the same time, because bitcoin has remained so conservative, it just does not have many of the risks that Ethereum does. And that's very valuable. And that's not something that Ethereum can change. Ethereum can't design into itself the conservative history that bitcoin has, especially post proof of stake Ethereum. These things have fundamentally different characteristics, and I don't know what is better or wins out over the long term or if both are great, but I'm glad we have both.
01:18:57.486 - 01:19:25.120, Speaker C: And I don't want bitcoin to change to proof of stake. And I thought it was cool that ethereum did, and we have both. And in my opinion, that makes it all more likely to actually, for crypto to actually defeat the real enemy, which is the fiat banking system. Like, that's the enemy, not, not the next blockchain that comes out. So I see this as a Hydra approach, and I'm just generally positive on the innovation that's happening, and I want to see more of it.
01:19:25.312 - 01:19:36.484, Speaker A: Eric, before we wrap, this has been a great interview. Really appreciate you coming on. What gets you most excited? Or what are the parting words that you'd leave our audience in general?
01:19:39.304 - 01:20:43.706, Speaker C: I mean, what gets me most excited is the same thing that's gotten me excited since 2011, which is that society has a financial foundation which no government can control, and it's growing, and it's not stoppable. You can't turn it off. And it's working, and it's already achieved a great deal of network effect. If my entire life and career involved in this stuff only exists to see the resting of control of money out of the hands of the state and into the hands of the market, that is immensely fulfilling and exciting to me. And so every day that I get to participate in this stuff and see that happening is very fulfilling. So that's what excites me, is moving money out of the government and into the hands of people. I think future generations will look back at it as one of the most fundamental changes in how society operates that has ever occurred, and we get to live in it right now and see it unfold.
01:20:43.706 - 01:20:56.374, Speaker C: So, yeah, I love it. I'm super inspired every day and really grateful for all the people and the talent that have dedicated their lives to building this stuff.
01:20:57.314 - 01:21:03.294, Speaker A: Eric Voorhees, founder, Dow, member of Shapeshift. Thank you so much for joining us, Eric.
01:21:04.154 - 01:21:05.374, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks, guys.
01:21:06.014 - 01:21:47.656, Speaker A: That's it for our show today. Thank you so much to our guest, Eric Voorhees. Honestly, he has such an interesting history and principled history of pushing for the crypto ethos. Every product he's built has been designed to minimize the amount of information he collects on users and maximize the non custodial nature of that user engagement. And when he has encountered roadblocks, he's iterated further to further remove him and his team from the process, which I think is extremely admirable and interesting. So thank you so much, Eric Voorhees, for joining us. Also, thank you to Sal Kadir from the research team for joining from that interview.
01:21:47.656 - 01:22:26.344, Speaker A: As Eric mentioned in the interview, Saul previously worked at Shapeshift, so always appreciate his insights on this and other topics. And of course, thank you to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Digital trading for his insights on markets. That's all we've got. We're getting close to the holidays, but we will be back next week with a roundtable with members of the Galaxy research team. Until then, have a great weekend.
