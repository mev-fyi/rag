00:00:07.800 - 00:00:45.876, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. I'm back with another rap and I never be smirched see, I gotta keep it real cause you know that's the best we got a guest from CMS named Dan Maciszewski. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital. And as I said, we have Dan Maciszewski from CMS holdings as a guest on Today's podcast. And, gosh, it's great conversation. He's one of the longest market participants in crypto. We'll talk with Dan about FTX, Alameda tether bankruptcy, market cycles, and some of his favorite and cringiest moments in crypto history.
00:00:45.876 - 00:01:22.894, Speaker A: We'll also check in with Bimnet Abibi. Even though he's not in studio today, he's going to be calling in. We never miss a market update from BIM. Net, and Christine Kim and I will talk about a range of other crypto news happening this week, including Fidelity launching crypto for retail, Blockfi's bankruptcy, Casa adding Ethereum support to its multisig wallet, and more. But before we begin, please refer to the disclaimers on the podcast notes, and note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or recommendation, solicitation or offer by Galaxy Digital or its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Got that disclaimer out of the way. So let's get right into it.
00:01:22.894 - 00:01:41.254, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bim net, a BB from Galaxy Digital Trading. Bam. I mean, I guess the only, I don't know if this is the only news, but one news item I saw today, Wednesday, November 30, was that Jay Powell seemed to confirm declining rate hikes for next month. So I'm assuming that means 50 bps from the Fed and not 75.
00:01:42.074 - 00:02:22.010, Speaker B: Correct. So right now, the market's thinking baseline for the market is that you're going to get a 50 bike in December. FOMC, which is in, I think, on December 14. I don't think it's a material change versus what you had from the Fed speakers you've had over the past couple of weeks. From what Powell said during last, FOMC basically repeated himself. He said their expectation for where terminal rates are going to be are going to be slightly higher than where they said they're going to be, according to their summary of economic projections that were released in September. So basically, he was like, ok, the market's pricing in 5%.
00:02:22.010 - 00:03:33.960, Speaker B: That's reasonable. And then he also discussed what he's trying to balance right now, which is if he starts easing too early or if he doesn't hike high enough. Basically, if he doesn't perfectly get financial conditions sufficiently tight for a long time, he won't successfully have brought inflation down to the Fed's target. He's got a lot of things that he's trying to do and he obviously has other policy tools, including the balance sheet. And right now we're engaging in a pretty material runoff of the balance sheet and that's likely to continue. So the big questions that the market has is how high are you taking rates and how long are high rates going to be in effect? And right now POwELL and the Fed are basically telling you that the risks of not keeping rates high for longer are too high. And so they're trying to be as hawkish as possible because you've got headline CPI still on a crazy seven handle in a labor market that hasn't cracked yet.
00:03:34.032 - 00:03:45.224, Speaker A: Right. Anything else? Obviously, the reaction I saw, the markets were up. It looked like across the board risk was trading up, I guess. But to your point, just a confirmation of really what the market already thought was going to happen in this?
00:03:45.264 - 00:04:43.852, Speaker B: No, absolutely. The market reaction I think is a bit more a function of what he didn't really address, which is you've had the stock market do incredibly well over the past couple of weeks, s and P is at 4000. You've had the dollar also sell off. If you look at things like pounds or euros, they've had material moves off the lows. And you also had a pretty material rally in the back end of the US curve with tens of having gone from four handle to high 360s, low three hundred seventy s. And so the fact that he didn't really push back against that in a very aggressive way versus like, you know, juxtapose that with how Powell reacted during the press conference during last FOMC when somebody told him stocks were rallying, he proceeded to list like a bunch of super hawkish talking points.
00:04:43.908 - 00:04:44.420, Speaker A: I remember that.
00:04:44.452 - 00:05:43.088, Speaker B: And so the fact that he's not pushing back as aggressively on kind of what the market has done recently I think is what caused the market to move higher. In addition, I think people were expecting him to be slightly more hawkish than what he was. And so markets viewing this favorably. And I think that the big thing in terms of how you have to think about it is that I think downside going into this meeting was very limited. Even if Powell was super hawkish, I don't think the market would have sold off that much because one, you have lots of data coming up before next FOMC, the jobs report, which will be out on Friday. You've got another inflation number and other data points as well. But without getting a clear sense of prices and jobs, the market's not going to price in a super hawkish outcome.
00:05:43.088 - 00:06:46.716, Speaker B: Knowing that the risks, there's two way risk on the economic data numbers and recent data has been turning soft. Today we had the Chicago PMI survey come in, I believe at 37.2. These are levels not seen since the depth of COVID So there are pockets of material weakness in the US economy. And so what you have to ask yourself is more bad data and bad data that's accelerating going to cause the Fed to slow down, or is the Fed going to stick to its sort of message, which has been fairly consistent, is that they're going to keep rates high for longer. So big thing for me is how on earth, how is the Fed going to react to data if it slows down much more aggressively and more quickly? And I think you're going to get more dovish rhetoric and that'll be good for markets and stuff, so should be good.
00:06:46.900 - 00:07:07.908, Speaker A: Yep. Awesome. BImnet Abb, we'll check in with you again next week. We've got more data coming and you'll be back in the studio with us. And so good luck, everyone, and thank you, BIMnet, as always. Let's go now to our guest, Dan Maciszewski from CMS holdings. Great to have you here, Dan.
00:07:07.908 - 00:07:09.304, Speaker A: Thanks for coming, man.
00:07:10.204 - 00:07:12.184, Speaker C: Good to be here. Good to be alive.
00:07:12.644 - 00:07:17.390, Speaker A: Yeah, it is in this market. I mean, how are you guys doing in general? How are you feeling?
00:07:17.542 - 00:07:41.462, Speaker C: That's, I mean, like, I'll say this, like, it's getting rapidly harder to, like, operate. Um, like, we're losing venues quite quickly. Like lenders in particular. Um, but we're here, like, we have, like, we're, like, we're definitely not in the shape we were to start the year, but, like, we're able to, like, operate. Like, we're able to keep, like, taking risk on. So it's like, good from that, like, side of you, but like, really, like, structurally it's becoming harder. Yeah.
00:07:41.462 - 00:07:49.192, Speaker C: Like, there's, like, there's like, not a lot of venues left or there's rapidly declining options. So that's just made it a little bit harder.
00:07:49.328 - 00:08:06.352, Speaker A: Yeah, true. I mean, the market infrastructure is going to look a lot different in a few years. It already looks different now. I mean, actually, that's a good question. I mean, I don't want to jump way too far ahead here. But since you mentioned that and the venues, and we look at the market infrastructure, you've been around in the markets a long time. It looks a lot different.
00:08:06.352 - 00:08:20.624, Speaker A: Or it looked a lot different this last bull run than it did in 2017. Right. It wasn't just like, the Poloniex troll box, like, anymore. As, like, your. As your main chat. Right. Like, how do you think it's going to look different, like, in, you know, three more years, three years from now?
00:08:22.164 - 00:08:34.188, Speaker C: Oh, that's a good question. Three years is hard. I think, like, just thinking the short term, like, there's a void here, right? Like, there in particular. Like, in, like, derivatives venues, right? Like, it's really just finance lab.
00:08:34.276 - 00:08:34.524, Speaker A: Right.
00:08:34.564 - 00:08:53.079, Speaker C: That's kind of it. Like, there's. Okay, like, Colby's going through Tron's transition, so I don't even know how that's gonna play out. But, like. And then you have cme, but, like, that doesn't really give you, like, a breadth of options. So I don't know. I do think if there was ever a window for one of the mid tier exchanges to, like, step up and become, like, bigger and, like, fill the void of that, like, that'd be good.
00:08:53.079 - 00:09:18.594, Speaker C: Like, the weird underbelly of this whole thing is, like, it's, like, just very hard as, like, a person with, like, us ubos to, like, operate on any of these things. FTX, like, was very much filling that niche for a lot of people. So maybe somebody takes on a little bit of, like, more regulatory sort of, like, risk and, like, fills that. But, like, right now, it's, like, not clear, like, where that, like, order flow is necessarily gonna go. Like, finance is a clear winner, but, like, I'm not sure that that, like, actually, like, holds. Yeah, it's a lot of concentration risk.
00:09:18.634 - 00:09:18.786, Speaker A: Right?
00:09:18.810 - 00:09:31.298, Speaker C: Like, binance is like a material. Like it was before. It's even more so now. I guess, like a. We have, like, a problem if something happens to that. There's no, like, real, like, redundancy. I think you still have coinbase and stuff, but it's different.
00:09:31.298 - 00:09:35.614, Speaker C: Like, the real, like, liquidity in the market is, like, very much concentrating.
00:09:35.914 - 00:09:45.094, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, you're seeing, I mean, 60 plus percent of spot volumes, it looks like, on finance, let alone you're talking about Deriv's. And so perps. Right. I mean, is that the only game in town for perps right now?
00:09:46.514 - 00:09:49.634, Speaker C: It's not the only game, but, I mean, you still buy it. You still have. Ok.
00:09:49.714 - 00:09:49.954, Speaker A: Right?
00:09:49.994 - 00:10:00.274, Speaker C: Like, there's. There's like, other venues. Derbit. Still, it's just they're not. They have. None of them has, like, stepped up to, like, sort of be that, like, second sort of spot yet. Maybe it's by bit.
00:10:00.274 - 00:10:20.678, Speaker C: Like, maybe they, like, take the action on and also, like, the spot volumes are a little, like, wonky, right? Because, like, finance is, like, doing zero fee trading that, like, sort of, like, messes with, like, stuff a little bit. But either way, like, it's definitely the most liquid. I don't think you can argue that. And they're, like, fighting now to take over stable coin, like, volume, rather, and, like, actual, like, issuance. It's like, that's, like, another concentration risk.
00:10:20.766 - 00:10:40.824, Speaker A: Absolutely. All right, let's. Let's go back a minute for our listeners who may not know. Dan. First of all, definitely follow Dan on Twitter at CMS Holdings. I think one of the most entertaining and insightful accounts on crypto Twitter. But, Dan, CMS, you're a proprietary fund, right? You take no outside capital.
00:10:40.824 - 00:11:00.354, Speaker A: Tell us the story of CMS and for our listeners. Dan, you used to run circle trade at Circle, which was back, I don't know exactly. Maybe correct me on these timeframes. We'll say 2017. And before, I think, was the largest OTC dealer in crypto. Um, how did you go from there to CMS?
00:11:01.454 - 00:11:04.206, Speaker C: Yeah, so I actually started cracking, believe it or not.
00:11:04.350 - 00:11:04.838, Speaker A: I didn't know.
00:11:04.886 - 00:11:23.542, Speaker C: Long time ago. So then I got. Yeah, that was, like, 2013, and then I joined Circle 2014. And then that death didn't become a thing until, like, 2017. That was, like, when it was big, right? Like, that first. That was a real cycle where there was, like, liquidity needs. So ran that through with Josh Lima, I think worked for the U Galaxy, though.
00:11:23.542 - 00:11:58.638, Speaker C: I don't remember if you guys overlapped and then did that for a while. Did that basically up until mid 2019. And then teamed up with a guy named Bobby Cho at Cumberland formerly and a guy named Julian Sagan, who had actually worked with me at Circle, pulled our capital and decided to trade our own. There was a conflict of things going on. One was circle was in a really rough spot before USDC had really caught a bid and become a thing. That business was struggling massively. So the OTC and trading desk was, like, unclear if, like, had a future, mostly because, like, the capital, like, sort of needs of it.
00:11:58.638 - 00:12:10.902, Speaker C: And then Bobby was just, like, making a. Make a move from Cumberland anyway. And we'd, like, known each other from trading forever. I traded with Bobby when he's at second market, which was way way back, like 2013, 2017.
00:12:10.958 - 00:12:15.274, Speaker A: And that was a DCG. That was Barry Silbert's company, right?
00:12:15.814 - 00:12:39.854, Speaker C: DCG didn't even exist. It was all second market. So before DCG even got, like, created, they were all trading other stuff. The auction rate securities business was big for them then because they got started selling secondary of Facebook. That was Gary's bread and butter. And then on the back of that company started putting in language to basically restrict the ability to sell shares. So they were like, all right, we need a new business.
00:12:39.854 - 00:13:00.546, Speaker C: And then they looked at a bunch of random shit, but crypto sort of stock in there, which is bitcoin. Like, there was no other thing that they were trading. And then they were doing these auction rate securities and crypto business, and then eventually they just carved out crypto. And we're like, all right, this is, like, clearly, like a real business, and, like, we're going to grow that. But that's when DCG got started. But DCG wasn't a thing forever.
00:13:00.690 - 00:13:13.014, Speaker A: So you and Bobby got together and Julian and created CMS. And what do you guys do? I mean, we know that you guys trade cryptos. What is, in general, the fund's overall strategy?
00:13:14.384 - 00:13:37.448, Speaker C: Yeah, well, right now it's like, make sure you don't die. But, like, in general, like, in, like, the good times, it's like, there's a couple of different things. Like, the first one is, like, we look at, like, shorter duration, sort of like trading, right? Like, why do we think inflows are going wherever? Like what? Like, that's like, a lot of, like, short term directional. Like, taking. Like, we do take on a good amount of risk. And then the other part of it is, like, the venture sort of stuff that's like, more like Bobby's wheelhouse. I sit more on, like, the liquid sort of side.
00:13:37.448 - 00:14:14.460, Speaker C: And then we have a handful of people here who, like, try to run automated type strategies. A lot of, like, electronic, more like typical, sort of, like neutral, like delta neutral, like, trading sort of opportunities like that we don't do a ton of yet. We're doing more of it as time goes on. Like, we did, like, a lot of, like, random stuff. Like, we did some of the GBTC, like, rolling, like, basically, like, creation and selling. We did some, like, we do a lot of, like, the basis trading, right? Just like, rolling down futures. So, I don't know, kind of anything that we think that there's edge in the market we try to participate in, and that's sort of been the background of it, and it evolves.
00:14:14.460 - 00:14:17.784, Speaker C: Right? Like, what you're doing in any given period changes every six months.
00:14:18.164 - 00:14:18.692, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:18.788 - 00:14:54.904, Speaker D: One of the things that I know you guys from, which is kind of hilarious that you had mentioned Dan or the CMS. Dan's Twitter. I know CMS first and foremost through the CMS intern Twitter account, because that account has, like, some of the dankest memes. It's always really active in all of the crypto discussions. So thank you for that background on that. But I'm also really curious. I mean, what was kind of, like, the backstory around the CMS intern Twitter account? And, like, tell me a little bit about your experience, like, starting up those internships at CMS.
00:14:56.004 - 00:15:14.284, Speaker C: Yeah, so Kevin worked for us. So Kevin's a full time employee now, but he got. So it's like. I think it was. Must have been middle of, like, COVID, right? So, like, that first winter, he was at school, and they basically kicked everybody out, and they were like, all right, like, oh, yeah, you have to leave. Because COVID. Right.
00:15:14.284 - 00:15:45.260, Speaker C: So he's like, well, I got a ton of time, and I can't. Nothing to do, and I'm stuck at home, locked in my house. And he had reached out through, like, a mutual friend who was like, hey, this guy's sharp. He, like, needs something to do. Like, are you interested? He called me, and we just, like, basically talked for, like, ten minutes, and I was like, all right. Like, everything had gotten really busy, too, right? Like, this is when, like, the markets were starting to, like, really take off, and I was like, if you could just, like, start, like, we'll give you, like, random, like, projects basically to, like, research. Like, we just had, like, we were really understaffed at the time, and, like, we really needed head count anyway.
00:15:45.260 - 00:16:00.666, Speaker C: So, like, we just, like, all right, like, we'll throw you in the fire. Like, there'll be stuff to do. Did a great job over that period. He ended up going back to school, graduating, and then, like, we brought him on. But it was kind of his creation. He just, like, did it, and then, like, kind of told us about it, and we're like, all right, like, I don't care. Like, run with it.
00:16:00.666 - 00:16:07.254, Speaker C: And then it became, like, a thing on its own. But that was really, like, all his, like, brainchild. Like, we didn't tell him or direct him in any capacity.
00:16:07.294 - 00:16:15.462, Speaker A: He decided he takes, like, full scenes from movies and, like, overlays, like, people's faces and stuff. It's amazing.
00:16:15.598 - 00:16:30.384, Speaker C: Yeah, he's gotten good at it. Yeah. Like, people. People try to, like, pay him to, like, make them for that. Effectively, like, well, they'll be like, hey, could you make one of this and put this in it? So, yeah, he gets pitched a lot. I don't think he's taking anybody up on it.
00:16:30.504 - 00:16:41.248, Speaker A: Well, glad that he's got a full time job now is no longer just an intern. Congrats to Kevin, who I did actually get to meet a couple weeks ago for the first time. So. An awesome guy. So that, that has.
00:16:41.296 - 00:16:42.112, Speaker C: Yeah, he's a good dude.
00:16:42.168 - 00:17:16.354, Speaker A: Yeah. It's been a great part of your, of your, of the CMS story, but here's another one, Dan, some, before we get into some meteor topics, you know, it's on your Twitter bio, you're pretty well known for saying, do you want to be right or do you want to make, do you want to make money or do you want to be right? Which I've always, I thought that's something that a trader, I think, would say. And it's a right way of thinking about if you're not being dogmatic about your investing, which you can be, by the way, there's many ways to invest. Question for you, though, in this market, how often have you found yourself making money and being right, if ever?
00:17:18.214 - 00:17:36.523, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, sometimes you have a core thesis and it plays out and it works. Yeah. I mean, it's not. That's what we're taking. I think the idea of it is not, like, to be taken literally. It's more just like, don't get too caught up in the weeds of why something should be doing it, especially if it's operating differently.
00:17:36.523 - 00:17:57.440, Speaker C: If the market's telling you something, you should probably pay attention to it. Versus, I'll say one where we were really wrong is clearly there was mounting trouble in FTX faster than we were willing to accept it, and that was just poor decision. Right. Like, that's like a counterexample of it. It's like, well, you should probably, like, pay attention to what's happening versus, like, what you think.
00:17:57.512 - 00:18:08.784, Speaker A: I hear ya. I guess when I, when I hear the phrase, I usually think, I think of it sort of, like, in the context of, like, maximalism, for example. Right. Do you want to. Are you putting being right?
00:18:08.904 - 00:18:10.008, Speaker C: No, that's a great example.
00:18:10.056 - 00:18:10.720, Speaker A: Right.
00:18:10.912 - 00:18:39.524, Speaker C: Yeah. That's taking it to an extreme where it's like you're letting some thesis or some thought that you have, like, override, like, what the market's saying. Yeah, it's a great day. There's, even if you don't think things have value like somebody else does, and they're willing to put money into it or trade it or this idea. Everything else is worthless. Clearly, you're wrong. Clearly the market tells you maybe you're right in 50 years, but it doesn't matter now.
00:18:40.224 - 00:19:06.064, Speaker D: I think a lot of people, like you said, dan, have been proven wrong in this market. And I'm curious to know. We've seen a lot of players, a lot of lenders in particular, going down because of the contagion from FTX's fall. Who else is going down? How far do you think this contagion still has to spread? How many more bankruptcies should we all expect to see?
00:19:07.084 - 00:19:38.074, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I guess the one thing is, there's not a lot of lenders left. There's just the reality of it. I mean, there's like, three, maybe, like, two that, like, actually do any real size. I'm not gonna, like, name names because I don't want to, like, speculate, but, like, I think we're, like, we're just, like, running out of, like, mid tier venues too, right? Like, we. It's not that there's nothing left, but, like, we've almost, like, mathematically just, like, whittled through so much of it. It's like, there can only physically be so many, like, entities left on the other side of it. So I think that's, like, the reality of it.
00:19:38.074 - 00:19:41.694, Speaker C: Um, fed messages come out, everything just, like, ripped.
00:19:41.774 - 00:19:42.150, Speaker A: Um.
00:19:42.222 - 00:20:12.282, Speaker C: Anyway, like, that's, like, I think the big thing. I think, like, the smaller and mid tier venues that, like, probably, like, have been, like, running, like, small fractional, like, issues for a while. Like, we'll probably just, like, resort to either, like, freezing certain, like, pieces of, like, business to, like, survive, or, like, we'll just haircut people and, like, move on. I think that's, like, kind of, like, the reality of it. I don't think there's any, like, big, looming giant bankruptcy that's, like, waiting in the shadows currently.
00:20:12.458 - 00:20:13.214, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:20:14.034 - 00:20:18.722, Speaker C: Who's left? Like, who? It's not Coinbase because everything's public. Like, I just, like, don't think so. I mean, I don't.
00:20:18.818 - 00:20:27.386, Speaker A: It has to be, like, the big scaries are. You mentioned finance before, and tether, I would say, are the sort of the main ones people are. Yeah.
00:20:27.570 - 00:20:31.626, Speaker C: Ted. Ted has always been, like, subject to these concerns.
00:20:31.650 - 00:20:31.762, Speaker A: Right?
00:20:31.778 - 00:20:36.692, Speaker C: They got something new, right. Finance would be like, finance would be the Armageddon. Like, that's like.
00:20:36.788 - 00:20:38.292, Speaker A: Yeah, that would really.
00:20:38.348 - 00:20:48.252, Speaker C: That would really be a problem. That being said, like, they should be making a ton of money. But then I also thought that way better. TX, but also to a much bigger degree. Right. Like, they're much bigger.
00:20:48.348 - 00:21:01.136, Speaker A: Yeah, they're much bigger. Right. I mean, I think. No, and to be clear, I mean, I have no. We have no real reason to have any suspicions about finance. We're just purely talking about its size. It's so massive that, you know, we don't have any.
00:21:01.240 - 00:21:10.136, Speaker C: No suspicions of it. Like, I mean, that business, like, on a run rate, I don't know, like, what is it making a year? I would wager $4 billion.
00:21:10.200 - 00:21:13.520, Speaker A: More like, it's insane that papers over.
00:21:13.552 - 00:21:15.488, Speaker C: A lot of mistakes, if you had any even.
00:21:15.576 - 00:21:30.202, Speaker A: Right, right. Speaking of which, let's. Let's. You know, we've said that we have funds stuck on FTX. I don't know if you guys have come out and said, but do. Do you or do. Are you on that list somewhere that we've yet to see?
00:21:30.258 - 00:21:40.322, Speaker C: Yeah, we are. We lost about 15% of, like, assets. Like, there. The problem I like, is, like, I don't know what stuff, like mark to, like, I don't.
00:21:40.338 - 00:21:52.154, Speaker A: Yeah. Though, like, that was no idea. That's what I was wondering. Calculated, especially knowing that they had, like, no accounting department at FTX, according to John Ray. No, I agree. They put out that list, 50. And.
00:21:52.154 - 00:22:03.814, Speaker A: And I was like, I don't know. You know, I was like, we don't know who's. Who's who on this list. We know what we said we have, and we see one that looks kind of, like our amount, but we don't know when they marked this or what assets these are.
00:22:04.754 - 00:22:17.538, Speaker C: Well, you know, it was also funny is, like, we ended up with, like, a weird hodgepodge of things because did you guys do this, too? Like, where, like, there was a period where it shut off and then they hadn't, like, act like you knew you weren't getting out.
00:22:17.626 - 00:22:17.874, Speaker A: Right.
00:22:17.914 - 00:22:34.422, Speaker C: But you knew, like, they were going to file. And it was like, I don't know, you had, like, 48 hours to, like, try to lose as much money as possible as you could on FTX, right? Like, it was. You were putting on these, like, really weird trades where you're like, like, the one everybody did was they were, like, long Solana on FTX, like, shorted on binance.
00:22:34.478 - 00:22:34.718, Speaker A: Right.
00:22:34.766 - 00:22:54.054, Speaker C: And you were just, like, hoping that when that big unstake happened that it would, like, crash lower. So your liability on. But, like, we were doing all kinds of, like, weird stuff to, like, try to, like, trade out. So, like, we have a basket of, like, odd assets that, like, we were left with at the end, we're like, I don't know, like, I guess the dollar value of these, like, so we don't know. I don't know what, like, our actual dollar liability, right?
00:22:54.134 - 00:23:13.434, Speaker A: I don't think anyone does. And, you know, when thinking about, you had, like, the Mount Gox claims, right, which are still haven't fully played out. And I think everyone's assuming there will be, like, FTX claims, maybe even blockfi claims now that they filed. But the problem particularly with the FTX claims is nobody has any idea what they are. Right. I mean, we don't even know what it is.
00:23:14.534 - 00:23:34.096, Speaker C: Well, also, like, we were, we were, like, trying to see if, like, because withdrawals were kind of random, right? Like, towards the end. And it seemed to be like anything that just came in the door would then get, like, withdrawn. So, like, we were buying any spot asset that was on there and trying to withdraw it with, like, the hopes that, like, I don't know, maybe somebody like, accidentally, like, deposits a bunch of Algorand and then you can, like, withdraw.
00:23:34.120 - 00:23:37.544, Speaker A: And they, like, left algo withdrawals on by mistake or in general or something.
00:23:37.624 - 00:23:46.432, Speaker C: Well, it felt like withdrawals were just, like, on, but, like, there were just no assets. So, like, stuff would, like, land and then it would go out the door. Well, it was weird at the end.
00:23:46.568 - 00:23:47.664, Speaker A: It felt like that at the very.
00:23:47.704 - 00:23:49.104, Speaker C: End, it was, like, strange.
00:23:49.224 - 00:23:55.952, Speaker A: And any deposits you feel like were immediately turned around as withdrawals. And they literally had nothing. Basically, yeah.
00:23:56.008 - 00:24:11.080, Speaker C: For a while it seemed like anything would come in and then, like, that would get batch sent out. And then they were prioritizing smaller stuff for a period. It seemed. It was also here the problem is, like, really bad information. Right? Like, everybody was just, like, speculating. Like, there wasn't, like, official correspondence. Like, they weren't, like, saying stuff.
00:24:11.080 - 00:24:15.764, Speaker C: And then, like, the Bahamas crap happened and everybody was trying to, like, yeah, money through those accounts. Yeah.
00:24:15.804 - 00:24:25.024, Speaker A: There was the al God trading or whatever, like, on Twitter was claiming that, like, he was getting out through, like, a Bahami Bahamanian, like, residence and stuff.
00:24:26.124 - 00:24:40.184, Speaker C: So I don't know about that one in perspective, but, like, do know that, like, people were withdrawing. Like, you could. So the inner. Here's what happened. Like, not because we're obviously following this a lot is, like, you could. The internal transfer mechanism was still working, right. Even though, like, there was nothing being withdrawn.
00:24:40.184 - 00:24:49.482, Speaker C: So, like, I could send to your FTX. Can you send them on? Right. Because they didn't post it on chain. It was just, like, in it. I don't know if you'd ever used it. But, like, on FTX, like, there. Yeah, it was just like an internal ledger.
00:24:49.482 - 00:25:01.378, Speaker C: A lot of the exchanges do the same thing. So you could find somebody with a Bahamas account, and you could be like, hey, I'll just, like, send you all my shit. You take 10% and just, like, withdraw it because it. Withdrawals were coming out of the Bahamas account.
00:25:01.466 - 00:25:04.658, Speaker A: They were allowed for a while. Yeah, yeah.
00:25:04.706 - 00:25:22.096, Speaker C: So the Bahamas accounts were, like, getting to the front of the line. And, like, Sam admitted this yesterday. Like, he, like, that actually happened. Like, they turned that on because the Bahamas, like, government said that they didn't ask for it. But, like, Sam was like, well, I gotta be in the Bahamas. So I did it. So anyway, so that lake was coming out, but then, like.
00:25:22.096 - 00:25:24.672, Speaker C: But then they shut the internal transfer mechanism off.
00:25:24.728 - 00:25:25.008, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:25.056 - 00:25:35.348, Speaker C: So what people were doing is they were like. They were trading the NFTs, launder the money from, like, the accounts to the Bahamas accounts. It was like, it was a mess. It was such a mess.
00:25:35.436 - 00:25:38.508, Speaker A: What a disaster. So anyway, why isn't Sam.
00:25:38.636 - 00:25:44.524, Speaker C: We did not partake in that. But, Dan, nobody. Nobody cares about crypto people getting robbed.
00:25:44.644 - 00:25:46.988, Speaker A: You think that's why? Because only, you know.
00:25:47.116 - 00:25:48.500, Speaker C: I think that's a lot of it.
00:25:48.612 - 00:26:19.762, Speaker A: Yeah. So the fraud, you know, we're pretty sure, I'm gonna say alleged fraud, particularly in what we think happened. Our guest last week, Lucas Nutsy, who's head of R and D at coin metrics, ran through a bunch of data that they have showing what they believe is the clear misappropriation of funds from the exchange to Alameda accounts. So I'm comfortable, I think, saying that, you know, this bad behavior, you're saying because it only happened to crypto people, you think that's why? There's not why this guy's appearing on dealbook in a couple hours at New York Times and not in jail.
00:26:19.858 - 00:26:40.744, Speaker D: And also, Dan, do you think that that really is the reason? Like, what Lucas had told us last week was that a lot of these funds, like, the $15 billion amount, was because they were, like, gambling it away in very bad, like, e five trade and, like, losing it in bridges. But, like, is that your perception of why FTX fell as well?
00:26:42.004 - 00:26:57.380, Speaker C: So I look, I don't know. I'm speculating, and I'm sure, like, he's done a lot more in the on chain thing. I think the hole is so big, though, that it's not any one of these things in particular. Right. It's like, it's too many different things that would have to, like, make this up. Like, it's very hard to lose $10 billion trading. Like, it just is.
00:26:57.380 - 00:27:01.588, Speaker C: And, like, that's a lot. Like, there's a lot of. Heck, no. Like, structurally, that's, like, a hard thing to do.
00:27:01.636 - 00:27:01.820, Speaker A: Right.
00:27:01.852 - 00:27:10.412, Speaker C: Like, I think it was like, I think was a confluence of, like, a number of things that they had go, like, they sent a lot of money at the door in venture. Right. Like, how much money did they allocate?
00:27:10.468 - 00:27:13.004, Speaker A: Like 2 billion or something. I think they pay.
00:27:13.084 - 00:27:14.228, Speaker C: I think it's more than that.
00:27:14.316 - 00:27:15.556, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a lot.
00:27:15.660 - 00:27:27.280, Speaker C: So anyway, like. Right, like, so a lot of that goes out. That's a lot of your liquidity. Like, bought a bunch of. Yeah, they spent a ton of money on the marketing. They bought a bunch of, like, property down there. They, like, lose some in, like, bridge hacks.
00:27:27.280 - 00:27:38.024, Speaker C: They, like, lose some in, like, bad bets. Like, they lose some, like, doubling that. Like, it's going to end up being everything. Like, it's the only way you can get to the number being that large. I think. Because you got to remember they raised close to 2 billion, too. Right.
00:27:38.024 - 00:27:39.264, Speaker C: Like, there's, like, a lot of money that.
00:27:39.304 - 00:27:39.960, Speaker A: Right.
00:27:40.152 - 00:27:49.448, Speaker C: Came in the door, so you got to, like, account for that getting lost, too. And, like, they also, like, in reality, should have made a ton of money on a lot of their bets. Right. Like, they bought.
00:27:49.496 - 00:27:49.792, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:49.848 - 00:27:57.108, Speaker C: The crap out of Solana in the single digits. Like, you had a year of that. Like, sitting above $100.
00:27:57.236 - 00:27:57.820, Speaker A: I know.
00:27:57.932 - 00:28:00.388, Speaker C: It should have been, like, a material p and l then.
00:28:00.516 - 00:28:00.756, Speaker A: So.
00:28:00.780 - 00:28:07.260, Speaker C: Yeah, like, I guess, like, I'm not just, like, convinced. It was, like, it's gonna be, like, easily explained is one thing. Like, I. Of the opinion. It's gonna be a lot of things.
00:28:07.332 - 00:28:18.924, Speaker A: Yeah. In fair, the coin. No, no, that's right. I think that makes a lot of sense. In the coin metrics, analysis does not account for the total size of the hole. It's not like, oh, we found all 10 billion. That supposedly is the hole, and they all were in defi.
00:28:18.924 - 00:28:34.064, Speaker A: It was, um, a lot of money, but not. Not necessarily all of it. So, um, that's. You're right. I mean, this is maybe a good thought experiment. If you had to lose $10 billion in, like, 12 hours, like, what would you do? Like, what's the trade?
00:28:35.204 - 00:28:39.204, Speaker C: No, you realistically can't. Like, the answer is, like, there's just not, like, you can't do it.
00:28:39.284 - 00:28:40.844, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, I guess you could, like.
00:28:40.884 - 00:28:41.844, Speaker C: Not in, like, trading.
00:28:41.924 - 00:28:44.264, Speaker A: Yeah, not in trading, I mean. Yeah.
00:28:45.404 - 00:28:48.876, Speaker C: Think about how far you'd move any market, just trying to even, like, execute that.
00:28:48.940 - 00:28:49.156, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:49.180 - 00:28:57.498, Speaker C: Like, let alone, like, I don't know. I just, like, I I hear you. I don't think that's, like, that easily loseable. I mean, all. You can lose a lot.
00:28:57.546 - 00:29:05.066, Speaker A: And again, totally, like, I don't know. Yeah, that's a lot. I agree. I mean, something has to basically go to zero in short order, and you have to be a huge size there.
00:29:05.210 - 00:29:06.162, Speaker D: But on that tab.
00:29:06.218 - 00:29:22.502, Speaker C: Yeah. And, like, people. People used to say that people were like, that's the Luna thing, and, like, they just ate it all, and it was, like, the. Right. Like, that was, like, the going theory for a bit, but the. The open interest on Luna itself wasn't ever that big on FTX. Even if they had eaten the entire thing down to zero, it wouldn't get you there.
00:29:22.558 - 00:29:23.154, Speaker A: Right.
00:29:23.854 - 00:29:31.142, Speaker D: In your history, though, Dan, I mean, in terms of your very large history of trading, what has been your worst trade?
00:29:31.198 - 00:29:35.382, Speaker A: Was it Luna, yours, or even better, what's the worst you've seen?
00:29:35.518 - 00:29:36.238, Speaker C: What's the worst?
00:29:36.366 - 00:29:37.034, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:37.694 - 00:29:43.060, Speaker C: I mean, I got a couple this year. I mean, like, we did the Luna treasury deal. That cleared that.
00:29:43.172 - 00:29:44.464, Speaker A: Oh, you guys did?
00:29:45.164 - 00:29:49.884, Speaker C: Yeah. And it was worth nothing in June. So, like, rough. I mean, rough time. That's pretty quick.
00:29:49.964 - 00:29:50.316, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:50.380 - 00:30:01.620, Speaker C: Yeah. So that was, like, that was a. That was a very fairly fast loss on that one. I mean, we were an equity investor in Blockfi. We were an equity investor in FCX. Like, those are quick successions of zeros.
00:30:01.772 - 00:30:19.984, Speaker A: Let me ask it a different way, Dan. Like, what's the cringiest? Or. Hold on. How do I ask this? The. There's a lot of trades that have been consensus trades in crypto in the past. Like, historically speaking, just one quick example is, like, you know, the ETH classic or ETH pal trading people were trying to do around the merge. There's been many others.
00:30:19.984 - 00:30:36.836, Speaker A: You know, I'm thinking about, like, even, you know, trading around BCH and, like, various, you know, trading forks. Like, I don't know, what can you think of, like, a consensus trade that everybody was interested in or even did that, like, was really bad that you saw in the past in crypto?
00:30:37.020 - 00:30:47.532, Speaker C: Well, I mean, there's some that you, like, knowingly knew were going to explode. I mean, like, people make that argument about Luna, too. So, like, I mean, like, right. I'm not, like, trying to defend, but, like, the whole ohm thing was wild.
00:30:47.588 - 00:30:48.652, Speaker A: Oh, the ohm forks? Yeah.
00:30:48.708 - 00:31:05.544, Speaker C: Like, yeah. Well, no, just an ohm itself, right when that was like. And I was like, this whole thing is just, like, predicated on the fact that nobody will sell it. I was like, it doesn't. Like, really. They're like, this is, like, a crazy, like, concept to, like, be building something off of. So I like, at the time when that whole thing was, like, going on, I was like, this is, like, outrageous.
00:31:05.544 - 00:31:13.438, Speaker C: Like that one, like, stuck out as, like. I mean, like, remember when people were minting empty blocks of ETH and then selling them as nfts?
00:31:13.556 - 00:31:15.226, Speaker A: Oh, my God, I forgot about that.
00:31:15.250 - 00:31:19.346, Speaker C: There was a lot of nft moments where I was like, this is just outrageous.
00:31:19.490 - 00:31:35.610, Speaker D: I think I remember when someone pitched me the idea of Ethereum as a diary, like the world's diary. Everyone would just put in an entry. Like, anyone could put in an entry into the blockchain and say, on this day, I did this thing.
00:31:35.802 - 00:31:38.494, Speaker A: You can do that already, though. That's the crazy thing.
00:31:39.594 - 00:31:46.174, Speaker D: It was like, yeah, you get to own a day. A day on Ethereum, ever.
00:31:47.874 - 00:31:51.346, Speaker C: I like, I mean, step in was pretty good. That was a pretty good time.
00:31:51.530 - 00:31:52.042, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:52.138 - 00:31:55.090, Speaker C: When you walk there and I thought that was pretty great.
00:31:55.202 - 00:31:57.370, Speaker A: Were you walking to earn?
00:31:57.442 - 00:32:11.388, Speaker C: I know, I didn't even walk there. And I should have picked up some pennies. No, I didn't even get into it. Just, I don't know, some of the. I mean, some of the stuff. Hilarious in retrospect. What about, like, a lot of money? Like, there's a lot of money flying around on this stuff.
00:32:11.506 - 00:32:39.224, Speaker A: Yeah, but even, like, you know, I'm thinking about thinking back, like, okay, so here's a related question. Like, so you were at circle, you guys were blowing up. I remember you were really big in 2017. Summer 2017 was the BCH fork on bitcoin. Right? That was when the block size wars sort of culminate culminated. What do you remember from that time? I don't know. What was your view on that back then? Like, what was it? Like, I'm trying to deal with forked coins at circle.
00:32:39.224 - 00:32:49.284, Speaker A: You remember? That was the whole thing, too. Like, Coinbase, like, didn't give them and then was going to get and then gave them in December. Like, how did. What was your view on that, though? That was a pretty fun saga at the time.
00:32:50.024 - 00:33:25.320, Speaker C: That was fun. And just to clear what you said earlier, we were definitely not the largest desk, but, like, we were up there, I would say, looking back on it, I think Cumberland was probably the biggest at the time. But anyway, like, sort of doesn't really matter. Yeah, so BCH, like, we actually had pretty good color that, like, it was going to be valuable. We tried to buy a lot of it before it actually happened. So we were going out to, like, larger holders of, like, bitcoin trying to, like, buy the BCH, but, like, people just, like, didn't want to do it and they, like, they either didn't care or they were like, this is weird, and, like, I don't want to get involved. So, like, we didn't need anybody to take us up on it.
00:33:25.320 - 00:33:51.266, Speaker C: Yeah, mostly because, like, we had a lot of people in Asia in particular who were really excited about it and also were trying to buy it from us ahead of time. Right. So they were trying to be like, hey, I want to buy this, yada, yada. So, like, we were like, I think a little less dismissive. This was a very much, like an east and west market thing, right? Like, in China in particular. Like, very much, like, going to be a thing. Like, we knew, like, the miners out of there were, like, for it.
00:33:51.266 - 00:34:45.021, Speaker C: Like, obviously, like, gian was, like, all over it, like, pretty public. Like, so we pretty much knew that, like, there was going to be some tangible value to this. But in the west, like, everybody was like, this is stupid. Like, why would this thing ever be, like, a thing? So, like, really, like, what? We ended up doing pretty well on this whole thing because, like, we were buyers of it for, like, some fairly good stuff when the market opened and sort of came out and we were able to leg out of that and we're basically bridging it, we're buying it us hours and then selling it back in Asia hours. The problem was all the exchanges had inconsistent dealings with it. So the first BS goal is we had to close everything going into it. But one thing we did also is this was a time when OKX's futures were really big and what they would do is the quarterly futures would settle into the index, but you wouldn't be on the hook for the fork.
00:34:45.021 - 00:35:17.366, Speaker C: So we had also gone like, this is the thing Kevin and Galway was talking about, the east proof of fork thing, right? The same trade. Like, we were massively short the OKX quarterlies against spot and, like, got a ton of BCH just like that, right? Like, you naturally got the roll down and you got the fork for free on it. Like, that was like another good, like, angle on it. Yeah, that one was great because you could collateralize the bitcoin short on okay actually had no liquidation because it's like a bitcoin collateralized future and OKX credit due to the fork for your balance that you were holding to collateralize it. So it was like, it was all, like, packaged inside.
00:35:17.430 - 00:35:17.878, Speaker A: That's nice.
00:35:17.926 - 00:35:36.760, Speaker C: It was good. The problem was, I mean, you had like, OKX exposure, but, like, other than that, like, it was like a very good trade. So, like, we had had that on. Like, we got a bunch, but yeah, like, everybody had to get everything off Coinbase, I think coinbase, like, draw. Like, they brought their beat. Like, bitcoin balances down, like almost a zero. I remember, like, the ticker of, like, showing it all.
00:35:36.792 - 00:35:41.264, Speaker A: People pulled out that at that much. I didn't remember that. But it doesn't surprise because if people.
00:35:41.344 - 00:35:42.968, Speaker C: Took a ton out.
00:35:43.056 - 00:35:43.724, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:45.544 - 00:35:52.080, Speaker C: But it was like, good, because it was like a good stress test that Coinbase was, like, solid. Like, it, like, came up.
00:35:52.112 - 00:35:53.472, Speaker A: Like, that's always good because it was.
00:35:53.488 - 00:35:59.408, Speaker C: Like the knock on. They were like, oh, like, coinbase is able to, like, eat this. So they all handle it differently, though.
00:35:59.496 - 00:36:21.340, Speaker A: I remember looking into this a lot. I actually did, you know, when we were working on bitcoin at Fidelity, at one point, I published an internal report on how all the exchanges and venues handled this fork. Really just showing that, like, there was no standardization at all. Like, a couple of them I'm not going to name, and I've also forgotten which, but some people, some exchanges sold the BCH and credited you bitcoin or cash in your account.
00:36:21.492 - 00:36:22.676, Speaker C: Zappo did that, right?
00:36:22.740 - 00:36:23.404, Speaker A: Yeah, I think so.
00:36:23.444 - 00:36:26.092, Speaker C: Zappo gave you a button. There's like a button to sell it.
00:36:26.108 - 00:36:36.056, Speaker A: But that was you and coinbase, obviously, they said they wouldn't do it. Then they changed their mind and then finally, like, I think in December, they gave you your bitcoin cash and then.
00:36:36.120 - 00:36:38.136, Speaker C: And it was like the most front run thing ever.
00:36:38.200 - 00:36:46.152, Speaker A: It was. I'm not gonna accuse them of it, but I agree. I mean, you've looked at the trading. There was a lawsuit. No. And people even sued them over it, I believe.
00:36:46.208 - 00:36:58.360, Speaker C: Yeah, but, like, I don't think it was nefarious. It just, like, this is the problem, and, like, this is the issue that these, like, exchanges always run into it. It's like, really hard to, like, do the integration work on a chain and, like, not have anyone find out.
00:36:58.392 - 00:36:58.560, Speaker A: Right.
00:36:58.592 - 00:37:08.128, Speaker C: Like, it's just like, it's really hard. So, like, it always ends up leak. What they should have done in advance was just like, when they decided they were going to do it and before they did any work, they should have said they were going to do it.
00:37:08.176 - 00:37:08.432, Speaker A: Right.
00:37:08.488 - 00:37:10.368, Speaker C: And then like, all right, then you can like do.
00:37:10.456 - 00:37:11.768, Speaker A: And I think they do this now.
00:37:11.816 - 00:37:12.024, Speaker C: Right.
00:37:12.064 - 00:37:18.960, Speaker A: They're much more upfront now about like, yeah, hey, these assets are in our queue to be reviewed for inclusion. And then there's other stuff.
00:37:18.992 - 00:37:25.798, Speaker C: It's like everything. It's like 95 assets and it's like, we may list any of these things.
00:37:25.926 - 00:37:26.470, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:26.582 - 00:37:57.634, Speaker D: What do you think, Dan, about the recent conversation around proof of reserves and exchanges using these cryptographic merkle tree proofs to help increase the amount of trust that users have in centralized exchanges in the aftermath of FDX, do you think that this conversation, which is not a new conversation, is, is going to be like materially helpful and impactful to making centralized exchange, to increasing the trust around centralized exchanges?
00:37:58.694 - 00:38:15.154, Speaker C: No, this came up after Mount Gox. Right. It was like, this happens every time there's a major hack. It happened after Bitfinex got popped. It happened after Mount Gox. The people who are largely trading just are willing to eat. The risk is, I think, the reality of it.
00:38:15.154 - 00:38:33.088, Speaker C: And like, retail users don't ask for it and don't demand it. So, like, it's not, like, it's not a, it's not a make or break for an exchange doing it. So they just like, don't. And like, I don't think that's the answer people want to hear. But like, I bet you in six months, like, we've forgotten about this and like, we're just interesting and like, no exchange is doing it.
00:38:33.256 - 00:38:36.792, Speaker D: So scrap that report that I'm supposed to write, proof of reserves.
00:38:36.848 - 00:38:38.484, Speaker A: No one's gonna care about it.
00:38:39.344 - 00:38:41.400, Speaker C: People been yelling about this for ten years.
00:38:41.432 - 00:38:51.124, Speaker A: And like, I know, I mean, OKX did it after Gox, I recall. And the CTO of OKX at the time was Changpeng Zhao, also known as Cz.
00:38:51.784 - 00:38:55.136, Speaker C: I remember. So previously a blockchain.com.
00:38:55.320 - 00:39:12.256, Speaker A: Yeah, that's interesting. I mean, you know, I'm not sure I agree though. You're right. The natural fit. I think the only way it gets forced on most exchanges if, is if you do get a critical mass of exchanges doing it, and now you're the one exchange that, like, doesn't do it and you just like, look bad, you know, like, okay, I'll say this, like.
00:39:12.280 - 00:39:19.800, Speaker C: Hurt and mentality, every other change except binance is doing it. Does that stop people from trading at finance? It doesn't. No.
00:39:19.832 - 00:39:20.960, Speaker A: Binance has to be on board.
00:39:20.992 - 00:39:21.552, Speaker D: That's a good point.
00:39:21.608 - 00:39:23.164, Speaker A: They have to be on board. I agree.
00:39:24.384 - 00:39:39.418, Speaker C: I mean, it helps. Like, no, it's great if you're binance and you do it, and then you, like, bury ten of your, like, smaller chain that, you know, are all, like, not doing it right. But, yeah, I don't know. I'm skeptical. Like, and I do think. I think it happens if a regulator demands it.
00:39:39.496 - 00:39:54.834, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's, like, how it gets interesting. Okay, couple other fun questions. Here's a weird one. Who's the most, I don't know, underrated or even just the best trader in crypto? And also, as a caveat, why is it Justin Sun.
00:39:56.014 - 00:40:09.412, Speaker C: Justin sun might honestly be the best trader in crypto? Like, the man just, like, he just absolutely top takes it, and he, like, absolutely bottom takes it constantly. I mean, he, like, also creates the bottoms and tops.
00:40:09.518 - 00:40:11.644, Speaker D: That's a pretty.
00:40:13.224 - 00:40:23.248, Speaker C: I don't know. I would wager, like, four to $5 billion if I had to, like, guess, and I'd say, like, half that's trading proceeds, and, like, half of that is, like, just tron related stuff.
00:40:23.336 - 00:40:30.288, Speaker A: Goodness gracious. What was the thing that they were doing with FTX? They announced there was some way for people to get money off FTX if it was trauma.
00:40:30.456 - 00:40:30.992, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:40:31.088 - 00:40:34.894, Speaker A: What was that? This is part of the shenanigans during the whole, like, thing.
00:40:34.984 - 00:40:44.298, Speaker C: Yeah, this was, like, shenanigan time. He was, like, letting you withdraw Tron effectively. So, like, if you had Tron on FTX, he would just, like, give you Tron elsewhere.
00:40:44.426 - 00:40:44.938, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:40:44.986 - 00:40:54.866, Speaker C: I think that's, like, how it would work, right? I think it was on Hulby. He'd be like, right. You get Tron here, like, credited for, like, your Tron. But there's, like, rules, and it's, like, only a certain amount, and, like, only if you had the Tron from, like, certain periods.
00:40:54.890 - 00:40:59.194, Speaker A: Oh, so you couldn't, like, just go buy Tron in the defunct FTX exchange and then get out?
00:40:59.234 - 00:41:09.482, Speaker C: You might have been able to do that, but, like, I don't think it, like, worked for size. It wasn't, like, a real thing, I guess. But he's done this before. He did this, like, with. When member. Okay. Froze everything for three months.
00:41:09.538 - 00:41:16.434, Speaker A: I remember that was when. When the guy was in jail or missing. Right. Or not even jail. Yeah. Yes. It's a star.
00:41:16.434 - 00:41:17.306, Speaker A: Yeah, he was missing.
00:41:17.410 - 00:41:25.386, Speaker C: Yeah. I don't know if he ever. But this is, like. This is, like, the issue with some of these other exchanges. You're like. Like, everyone. Like, you forget real quick.
00:41:25.386 - 00:41:25.794, Speaker C: Right.
00:41:25.874 - 00:41:26.250, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:26.322 - 00:41:30.962, Speaker C: Like, we're talking about how. Okay, like, a venue is now. It's like, well, like, people get their money frozen for three months.
00:41:31.018 - 00:41:36.664, Speaker A: Yeah. Because, like, he. What? He had a. He was a multi sig key signer, I guess, and was missing.
00:41:37.404 - 00:41:38.812, Speaker C: I don't think we ever got the real answer.
00:41:38.868 - 00:41:40.540, Speaker A: I think that was the answer, more likely than not.
00:41:40.572 - 00:41:50.884, Speaker C: Like, I think law enforcement told them to stop and, like, was either shaking them down or was, like, asking to, like, look into something. And, like, until they were done, you were, like, not getting any money off the platform.
00:41:50.964 - 00:41:51.436, Speaker A: Crazy.
00:41:51.500 - 00:41:56.060, Speaker C: I think, like, they never officially gave an answer, though. There was, like, never, like, a known reason why.
00:41:56.212 - 00:42:11.186, Speaker A: Yeah. And now we have Poloniex, like, in some kind of strategic partnership, is, I think, what Huobi called it will be said they're entering a strategic partnership. Everybody had said that, that Justin's son was buying Huobi. That's what they had said. Because Justin apparently. Right. Owns Poloniacs.
00:42:11.186 - 00:42:40.722, Speaker A: I believe he bought it from circle. And then there were. I guess. I guess Huobi, I don't know if it was acquired or, like, some group out of Hong Kong technically bought it, and everyone was suggesting the rumor was that that was actually Justin's son, and then both denied it. And then I saw, like, yesterday, Huobi said, actually, we're entering into a strategic partnership with Poloniex. What do you think's happening there is that. You think that's a consolidation by Justin and his growing empire? Yeah.
00:42:40.738 - 00:42:44.426, Speaker C: He bought it, right? I mean, they. Not officially. Yeah.
00:42:44.490 - 00:42:47.494, Speaker A: They haven't. No, they kind of denied it. I don't know why.
00:42:47.994 - 00:42:51.882, Speaker C: I mean, it is like. I don't know. I think. I think that one's, like, you can take it.
00:42:51.898 - 00:42:52.614, Speaker A: Its face.
00:42:53.114 - 00:43:00.178, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, like, you just, like, buying things that, like, turns around and uses them for the. No, he's good. He's very good at what he does. Right?
00:43:00.226 - 00:43:00.726, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:00.850 - 00:43:04.598, Speaker C: I mean, yeah, Dan, he's playing. Playing chess.
00:43:04.686 - 00:43:11.074, Speaker D: How do you think Justin's son got the tether behemoth to print so much tether on Tron?
00:43:12.174 - 00:43:12.934, Speaker A: The best.
00:43:13.014 - 00:43:31.132, Speaker C: This one's actually really easy for a stable. So there's a ten bits creation fee. It may be a little different now, but there used to be, like, we used to make a lot of tether back in the day at circle, and it was, like, ten bits deposit withdrawal fee, which isn't, like, crazy. Like, that's just, like, how they made money on it. Like, before. Like, interest rates became real. Like, now they make it that way.
00:43:31.132 - 00:43:36.844, Speaker C: But so there was, like, a fee to create it. Justin would pay the fee if you issued it on Tron.
00:43:37.664 - 00:43:41.564, Speaker A: That was, like, issuing it for. Basically, you could issue it there for free.
00:43:42.264 - 00:43:42.736, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:43:42.800 - 00:43:46.048, Speaker A: Yeah. So you could create it and then it worked. I mean, I've also heard the exchanges.
00:43:46.096 - 00:43:52.760, Speaker C: To, like, put it on. Right. Like, it's also not bad. Like, it's not like a. Not like a bad blockchain. Right? Like, it works for, like, moving tether around.
00:43:52.832 - 00:44:01.898, Speaker A: Well, and also, like, if you're. If you're. I always figured too, like, I mean, let's say it is even a bad blockchain, which it. I agree. It functions. It's not bad. It's basically an ethereum fork, to be honest.
00:44:01.898 - 00:44:21.734, Speaker A: Also. Right. So it's easy for exchanges to integrate, but also for an off chain asset, like dollars or treasuries or whatever the stable coin is backed by the tokens themselves are really just sort of, like, liability tokens. Right. So, like, tether can just, like, if something goes wrong on Tron, tether can just, like, cancel and reissue them. Right. I mean, it's not.
00:44:21.734 - 00:44:26.694, Speaker A: You don't need, like, bitcoin level security for an off chain tokenized asset.
00:44:27.504 - 00:44:29.008, Speaker C: Yeah. No, you don't.
00:44:29.136 - 00:44:31.528, Speaker A: And it's fast. Right. People like it on exchange because it's fast.
00:44:31.576 - 00:44:35.120, Speaker C: Yeah. It's quick. It works. Yeah. It serves the purpose.
00:44:35.232 - 00:45:00.564, Speaker D: Dan, are your views on tether relatively unchanged for the past couple years? I feel like you've told during interviews or Twitter before that tether is reliable. You've been able to withdraw. What are your thoughts around tether now? And do you foresee the position of USDT in the crypto market infrastructure structure changing anytime soon?
00:45:01.504 - 00:45:29.340, Speaker C: Yeah. So, like, my opinions on it haven't changed, mostly because, like, no information has led me to, like, feel differently about it. Like, I guess, like, the one thing you gotta, like, always handicap with this is, like, we were in the business of, like, creating redeeming tether, like, up until mid 2019. Right. Like, that's kind of, like, where it ends. And, like, I don't know how it works now, but, like, there was a big, deep pegging right when that first big crash happened on the back of three arrows, went down to, like, $0.95.
00:45:29.372 - 00:45:29.772, Speaker A: Yep.
00:45:29.868 - 00:45:32.340, Speaker C: And then they. They redeemed. I don't know what it was.
00:45:32.372 - 00:45:38.636, Speaker A: It was, like, ten or 12 billion. It was, like, ten plus billion over only a few days. And they did redeem, like, two, 3.
00:45:38.660 - 00:45:40.916, Speaker C: Billion, like, bang, bang, bang, like, every day.
00:45:40.980 - 00:45:41.292, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:45:41.348 - 00:45:53.664, Speaker C: And they did it. So, like, I don't know. Like, I mean, that means a lot. That's a pretty good stress test. Like, so as far as I know, like, redemption sort of, like, still work. Like, I mean, like, tethers big. Like, I.
00:45:53.664 - 00:46:12.428, Speaker C: Tether fills a market niche and, like, will continue to. I think it's just much smaller than, like, the larger stable coin market, which, like, USDC busd now and, like, particular have, like, sort of, like, filled it. Like, if you look at, like, their percentage ownership, like, on stable coins, like, it's basically been down. Yeah, yeah. It's like a function of the whole thing.
00:46:12.476 - 00:46:12.828, Speaker A: Totally.
00:46:12.876 - 00:46:22.632, Speaker C: I don't know. Like, I kind of. I kind of think it'll always be, like a big, valuable asset. It'll just be, like, smaller in terms of, like, proportion of, like, the total. That's like, how I continue to see it playing out.
00:46:22.688 - 00:46:31.524, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. So you view the stablecoin market also just generally growing and tether not maintaining its market dominance of it, but still existing?
00:46:32.064 - 00:46:33.520, Speaker C: Yeah, I think so.
00:46:33.672 - 00:46:42.864, Speaker D: Any chance that tether, in order to compete moves, like, onshore, like, becomes an onshore entity, like, regulated?
00:46:42.944 - 00:46:45.404, Speaker A: Oh, you mean they come into the fold in the US?
00:46:45.744 - 00:46:57.854, Speaker D: I mean, given that the growth of USDC and, like, other stable coins could. Could, you know, really take off if regulators get on board too? Like, any chance of that happening?
00:46:58.794 - 00:47:05.482, Speaker C: I don't think so. I think. I think the people that run that and befriends are, like, a lot more, like, philosophically driven than meets the eye.
00:47:05.578 - 00:47:22.980, Speaker A: Yeah. Hey, I did see you mentioned earlier that there must have been some news, and I'm sure you've been seeing it, too, on your terminals, Dan, while we talk. But Powell, Jay Powell said that a downshift is likely next month, but more hikes to come. I guess that means that we're going to see 50 bps instead of 75 at the Fed next month.
00:47:23.132 - 00:47:24.264, Speaker C: Maybe he'll cut.
00:47:25.044 - 00:47:26.500, Speaker A: You think? No way.
00:47:26.612 - 00:47:27.264, Speaker C: No.
00:47:28.204 - 00:47:29.304, Speaker A: Can you imagine?
00:47:29.764 - 00:47:30.636, Speaker C: Man can dream.
00:47:30.700 - 00:47:38.116, Speaker A: I know, right? But. So that's why the market has been. Looks like reacting very positively. Bitcoin's almost up at 17k again and ETH is over.
00:47:38.180 - 00:47:42.540, Speaker C: Well, yeah, blockfi and Alameda stopped selling our coins.
00:47:42.652 - 00:48:03.604, Speaker A: Well, yeah, they don't have any. They can't sell anymore. So, Dan, thank you so much for joining us. Any last things, any market insight or wisdom for what you're thinking about? Congrats, and I'm very happy to hear that. You said you guys were a little beaten and bloodied, but certainly not broken. Keep surviving. Any final words to tell our listeners?
00:48:04.264 - 00:48:09.808, Speaker C: I think that's it. I think you're just kind of like. You're just waiting and making it out the other side at this point.
00:48:09.896 - 00:48:10.152, Speaker A: How long?
00:48:10.168 - 00:48:16.044, Speaker D: I think that's really it. How long is this bear market bearish market cycle going to last?
00:48:16.704 - 00:48:28.440, Speaker C: Oh, I don't know. I mean, like, I, man, I've been really wrong on this, but I don't know. I want to assume like back end of Q one next year. Like life comes back and it's like the problem is I have a lot of overhang.
00:48:28.472 - 00:48:28.616, Speaker A: Right.
00:48:28.640 - 00:48:41.448, Speaker C: It's going to be like a lot of legal bullshit for like a couple years. So that's going to like drag. I don't think you're going to see like material, like venture type, like traditional investment for a while.
00:48:41.536 - 00:48:41.848, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:48:41.896 - 00:48:48.168, Speaker C: Like you did. Everybody just kind of has to lick their wounds on that side. So I think they probably look in a year.
00:48:48.296 - 00:48:49.364, Speaker A: Yep. Okay.
00:48:49.664 - 00:48:55.964, Speaker C: Like, I don't know. I mean, like picking a bottom is hard, but I don't know. I hear you that much worse.
00:48:56.304 - 00:49:31.654, Speaker A: We'll, we'll check in with you then, Dan, at least in a year, but until then, thank you so much. Great to see you. Dan matches Kruszewski from CMS holdings. Quick break for our listeners. Our poll from last week currently pinned to our profile on Twitter lxyresearch. It read, the judge in the FTX bankruptcy case ruled that the names of unsecured creditors to the exchange will not be released for now. When will we learn the names of users or entities with assets stuck or lost at FTX? The vast majority, 56% of respondents, said never or later than Q 220 23.
00:49:31.654 - 00:50:03.230, Speaker A: You know, only a small number of people think we're going to. 32% think we might get it before the end of Q 120 23. No poll this week, but instead a call to action. Again, if you would like us to talk about specific topics, or if you have ideas for guests, or if you yourself want to be featured on Galaxy brains, send us a voice recording or an email researchalaxy.com, or hit us up on Twitter GL xyresearch. And that's all. Get back to us and we'll consider including you or your ideas on the show.
00:50:03.230 - 00:50:13.910, Speaker A: Now back to the show. I'm here with Christine Kim again. What a fun interview with Dan. Yeah, enjoyed that. The guy has so much experience in crypto and just a unique view on the market.
00:50:14.022 - 00:50:17.446, Speaker D: I like how to the point Dan is clear, concise.
00:50:17.550 - 00:50:31.168, Speaker A: That's what you find from a lot of traders in general. Really hard to be a trader and not be like pretty honest with yourself at least. And then usually you find, you know, they're pretty honest folks because you got to live in reality if you're going to make money trading.
00:50:31.256 - 00:50:35.576, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. And also take your losses like a cool person.
00:50:35.640 - 00:50:57.720, Speaker A: I hear you again, you can't make money if you're lying to yourself in trading. So that was an awesome conversation with Dan from CMS. So really happy he joined us. Thank you, Dan. Let's talk about just a couple items from the, from the news week. It's actually been a pretty busy time in crypto news. Even outside of FTX and other contagion followers out type stuff.
00:50:57.720 - 00:51:28.994, Speaker A: I think the biggest story is Fidelity is finally launching their retail crypto product. So this was said in September that by November it would be launched. And I think today is, what, November 30? And two days ago on November 28, on Monday, they said they were launching it and that the waitlist was now people were getting off the waitlist and it was coming in. I saw our friend Matt Walsh from Castle Island Ventures tweeted that he had bought bitcoin in his Fidelity account.
00:51:29.294 - 00:51:43.286, Speaker D: I guess all these market events for the last couple months did not deter Fidelity's resolve to get this retail service to its consumers. Is it just for bitcoin and Ethereum? Correct.
00:51:43.350 - 00:52:16.868, Speaker A: I think even right now it's probably just for bitcoin, but it will be bitcoin and ETH, I believe, because they've also said that at Fidelity digital assets, they'll be adding support for ETH. And fidelity digital assets is the backend provider here. So assume it will definitely be both. I don't know if any else. And transfers aren't actually apparently enabled yet, so it's kind of like robinhood before they enabled withdrawals, where it's like you can buy and sell, but you can't actually send bitcoin in or out to your own wallet. Yeah. But I assume they, of course, will add that at some point.
00:52:16.868 - 00:52:42.828, Speaker A: There's a lot of, it's a big company and they got a lot of AML Kyc stuff. They gotta figure out exactly how to do it at a retail scale. Fidelity Digital assets obviously supports wallet services in and out. So they have the technical capabilities. But big congrats to fidelity. It's been literally years in the making. So very, very happy and proud of the teams there, both at Fidelity brokerage services, the retail business, and also fidelity digital assets.
00:52:42.828 - 00:52:48.864, Speaker A: So big, big congrats to those guys. Cannot wait to see what happens there. And I agree. Undeterred.
00:52:49.914 - 00:53:01.538, Speaker D: Yeah. A rare, rare good news and the sea of bad news. I feel like at any other time, we would have been like, oh, this is going to be great for adoption, but frankly, right now it is going to be great.
00:53:01.586 - 00:53:22.194, Speaker A: I think so. But yes, I know we're in a tough period, but things get built and launched in bear markets. Most of the stuff that ripped this year and last year was all post 2017 bull market stuff. But I agree, you know, we're, look, we're like Dan said, you just gotta survive in this market.
00:53:22.494 - 00:53:24.870, Speaker D: All right, Alex, hit me with the bad news now.
00:53:25.022 - 00:53:46.090, Speaker A: So Blockfi, the lender, right, they filed, they did file for bankruptcy, and in their first hearing, I think they're called, they had a court hearing about the bankruptcy and they said that they're owed a billion from FTX and Alameda. That's a big number. That would be a huge portion of what we think.
00:53:46.162 - 00:53:47.658, Speaker D: Well, what did you expect it to be?
00:53:47.706 - 00:54:22.220, Speaker A: No, I don't know. I just am saying that's just a big number. Look, it's obviously not good news, but I guess we're getting more clarity. We kind of knew this was happening because Blockfi had halted withdrawals and such a couple of weeks ago in the wake of FTX. And FTX is the one that had come to their rescue post Ruera's capital in June ish, I think. So. If your rescuer itself goes bankrupt, it's not really a good sign.
00:54:22.220 - 00:54:50.448, Speaker A: So here's one you might like, though. Casa, my personal favorite of several good ones. Bitcoin, collaborative custody, multisig provider. So it allows you to store your bitcoin in a multisig setup in which Kasa can hold a key, which is nice. It gives you some redundancy. That means they can't move the funds unilaterally. But if you were to lose one of your keys, you could collaborate with them to sign and retrieve your funds.
00:54:50.448 - 00:55:10.234, Speaker A: They're adding, they had been bitcoin only, but they have just announced today that they're adding support for Ethereum. I think it's really good. Where can you multisig your ETH easily? Do you know? Anywhere? I mean, obviously you can go on chain and build your own gnosis vault or whatever, but that's beyond, I think, the technical capabilities for most people.
00:55:10.614 - 00:55:23.230, Speaker D: Well, I think most people use metamask and it's like a browser, in browser wallet. I don't know of many Ethereum activities or like Ethereum transactions and people who use Ethereum regularly that rely on like a cold storage wallet.
00:55:23.302 - 00:55:47.218, Speaker A: It's true. Cold storage should be more widely. Well, that's the thing. Metamask I mean, again, I think you can set these up, probably. I'm not sure if you can in Metamask, but multisig is extremely powerful for security and for a lot of reasons, gives you redundancy. And I don't know of many people that are. If you're on chain doing a lot of on chain stuff, then you can't really have a bunch of that stuff can't be in cold storage.
00:55:47.218 - 00:55:49.042, Speaker A: Right. Which is why, other than.
00:55:49.098 - 00:55:56.790, Speaker D: Remember that Defi protocol that got hacked? And it was because, like, four out of the five multisig holders, their keys were compromised.
00:55:56.862 - 00:56:03.558, Speaker A: Yeah, that can happen. So. But I think for individual custody, multisig is really a powerful tool.
00:56:03.646 - 00:56:03.982, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:56:04.038 - 00:56:28.342, Speaker A: And I use Casa for my bitcoin, for some bitcoin, and it's great. The UX is awesome. I love the team there, and I'm just. I'm happy and proud, proud of them, because, I mean, look, some of the bitcoin maxis were, like, very upset, right? And they're like, oh, my God. Like, it's not a bitcoin only company anymore. It's like, guys, this is a custodian. Ideally, they're going to store anything I ask, let alone another crypto asset.
00:56:28.342 - 00:56:42.314, Speaker A: I mean, in the long run, banks have literal safe deposit boxes. They'll literally store basically anything. I want my custodians to store anything and do it. Well, theoretically. But also, look, they said it was for client demand.
00:56:43.174 - 00:56:45.958, Speaker D: Has the lash back been that bad on Twitter from.
00:56:46.006 - 00:56:47.782, Speaker A: I mean, it's like, you know, is.
00:56:47.798 - 00:56:52.798, Speaker D: That why you think Casa didn't include ETH for a long time? Like, that kind of sentiment?
00:56:52.886 - 00:57:17.134, Speaker A: Oh, no. I mean, they love bitcoin. There's no doubt about that, right? Jamison Lopp is the CTO. He's probably one of the top three bitcoin content creators and educators in the world, and separately, as an awesome person. But so, I mean, I think they just start with bitcoin because they love bitcoin and it needs it. But I think the market, their clients want other products. You know, I don't know how you can be upset about that.
00:57:17.134 - 00:57:27.578, Speaker A: So congrats to the Casa team. And actually, we're planning to have Nick Newman, the CEO from Casa, on this podcast, hopefully in the next month or two. So we'll ask him about that and we can ask him your question.
00:57:27.706 - 00:57:56.606, Speaker D: Speaking of Ethereum news, I also have a nice little Ethereum tidbit, so we'll have to dedicate maybe a longer discussion for this, but I'll just say right now that more information around Ethereum's encrypted mempool to protect user and user transactions and make MEV more equitable for the ecosystem and less damaging to the ecosystem, more information about that mempool has been released by the flashbots.
00:57:56.710 - 00:58:08.902, Speaker A: So this would be a private, encrypted, secret mempool so that you could avoid, as a user, being the victim of an MEV attack, or whatever you want to call it. Is that the idea?
00:58:09.038 - 00:58:13.674, Speaker D: Well, so there's not actually very much about this.
00:58:14.294 - 00:58:16.206, Speaker A: You mean very much information we don't know?
00:58:16.310 - 00:58:41.598, Speaker D: Yeah, well, like, there's not. Honestly, like, I think that was my main takeaway from reading the newest blog post about suave. So this is the name of the mempool suave, and it's being built by flashbots. Even though flashbots says repeatedly that this is a product that they want the community, like everyone, to build together. It was my biggest disappointment. There really wasn't that much information around the technical design. So we don't really know, other than the fact that this is going to be an EVM compatible blockchain.
00:58:41.598 - 00:59:35.072, Speaker D: So an entirely separate network that sits on top of other blockchains. So not just Ethereum, but many different chains, and that the participants, the market participants of the suave chain, will be able to execute cross chain transactions to extract MEV, and some of those proceeds will be given back to users. So I think this multi chain concept was a really big, was very emphasized in this blog post versus when the idea of suave was first introduced back at Devcon in October. Then the concept was that when users submit a transaction, the contents of that transactions will not be known and will not be revealed. Which is why I was like, oh, you know, this is an encrypted mempool kind of thing, which I still think it is. But again, I mean, it's probably too premature to even have this discussion on suave now, but it was announced it's.
00:59:35.088 - 00:59:39.568, Speaker A: Going to be important, right? I mean, anything that flashbots puts out is important for the Ethereum ecosystem.
00:59:39.616 - 00:59:40.664, Speaker D: Totally. Yeah.
00:59:40.784 - 00:59:56.526, Speaker A: Interesting. All right, one last thing. Wallet. I saw they've delisted or removed support for bitcoin, cash, ETH, classic ripple and stellar. And they said it was a. It will be effective December 5. They cited low usage for dropping those coins.
00:59:56.526 - 01:00:00.054, Speaker A: So rip to ripple and stellar holders.
01:00:00.134 - 01:00:03.462, Speaker D: It's about time. Good riddance.
01:00:03.518 - 01:00:26.020, Speaker A: Look, that's all we've got. Thanks again to our friend Bibnet Abibi for his market color, and to Dan Matryzewski. From CMS holdings, an awesome guest.
