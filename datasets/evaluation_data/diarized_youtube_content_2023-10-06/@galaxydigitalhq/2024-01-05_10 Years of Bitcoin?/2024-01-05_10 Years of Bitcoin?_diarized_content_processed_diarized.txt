00:00:00.240 - 00:00:05.246, Speaker B: Lets go now to our guest, Pete Rizzo, editor of Bitcoin magazine. Pete, thank you so much for coming on. Galaxy brains love.
00:00:05.270 - 00:00:06.382, Speaker A: To be here. Peter.
00:00:06.438 - 00:00:18.166, Speaker B: Ive wanted to have Pete on for a while. Hes been covering bitcoin for a long time. He was previously the editor at Coindesk. How long have you been actually covering bitcoin?
00:00:18.270 - 00:00:52.894, Speaker A: Yeah, great question. I had my ten year anniversary earlier this summer of my first bitcoin article I think went out in July of 2013. Im probably just following the space for a few months before that. But yeah, ive been a bitcoin journalist officially now for ten years. I'm not sure if that's an accolade, but I've certainly been doing it for a long time and the space has evolved tremendously. But I think my initial take, I'll stand by it, was an optimistic look about people using this new crazy Internet currency to do different things.
