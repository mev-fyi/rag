00:00:07.880 - 00:00:11.662, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bim net Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bim net. Great to see you.
00:00:11.718 - 00:00:12.702, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:12.798 - 00:00:28.314, Speaker A: What's been happening in markets? I guess the big news since, I guess it happened after we recorded last week was this ruling in the ripple case. I think that's probably the big news still in the cryptocurrency markets. What's been the, you know, fallout from that that you've seen?
00:00:28.394 - 00:00:31.974, Speaker B: Well, the biggest fallout was ripple.
00:00:32.434 - 00:00:33.778, Speaker A: XRP went up a lot.
00:00:33.826 - 00:00:46.906, Speaker B: It has rallied tremendously up to, you know, around $0.75 right now. And, I mean, shorts got hosed, you know, like tons of like, losses, you know, are implied.
00:00:46.930 - 00:00:52.414, Speaker A: It's like primarily like offshore trading. Right. At this point. Because all the US entities delisted it, correct? Yeah.
00:00:52.754 - 00:00:57.498, Speaker B: In addition to ripple, obviously stellar Lumens also had a.
00:00:57.546 - 00:00:59.186, Speaker A: Why does it have an x in it? XlM.
00:00:59.250 - 00:01:01.394, Speaker B: No, it's the same guy. Right?
00:01:01.514 - 00:01:06.290, Speaker A: Yes. That's like, when you look at these markets, you're like, that's funny. Yes.
00:01:06.442 - 00:01:10.858, Speaker B: But lumens are like $0.14 now and looking like they can go higher.
00:01:10.906 - 00:01:11.814, Speaker A: That's crazy.
00:01:12.594 - 00:01:31.726, Speaker B: It's a function of just liquidity. And there are forced buyers in a market, not that many sellers. And the other thing to think about is there has been a ton of interest in the US in ripple. And us based investors really haven't had the opportunity to buy it for years now.
00:01:31.790 - 00:01:36.334, Speaker A: Right. Coinbase immediately relisted it. Immediately relisted it, like a couple hours after that ruling came out.
00:01:36.414 - 00:01:46.748, Speaker B: And let's be honest, it's a top ten token if you're benchmarked to performance or you're trying to get exposure to the crypto space. Almost.
00:01:46.836 - 00:01:49.740, Speaker A: Some folks are like, so indexes maybe had to buy.
00:01:49.812 - 00:01:50.284, Speaker B: People had.
00:01:50.324 - 00:01:53.980, Speaker A: Yeah. Second, it was realistic. Maybe had to buy. Wow, that's interesting.
00:01:54.172 - 00:02:08.108, Speaker B: And it's been like, you know, I won't take credit for this since I heard it from, from somebody else. But that was, you know, one of the main reasons to be bullish ripple before this decision was nobody in the US has had an opportunity to buy.
00:02:08.116 - 00:02:11.672, Speaker A: A second if it were to become available, then bam.
00:02:11.788 - 00:02:12.712, Speaker B: Yeah, bam.
00:02:12.848 - 00:02:15.600, Speaker A: So was it like liquid, like. And I mean, these liquid.
00:02:15.632 - 00:02:17.384, Speaker B: It's one of the most liquid tokens on the planet.
00:02:17.424 - 00:02:20.204, Speaker A: A bunch of liquidity just like, flowed back to the states as soon as.
00:02:20.584 - 00:02:23.848, Speaker B: On the day ripple traded over $10 billion.
00:02:23.936 - 00:02:27.872, Speaker A: Wow. What was that, like last Thursday? Yeah, yeah. Wow.
00:02:27.968 - 00:02:31.888, Speaker B: That is. That's like bitcoin on a bad day, like.
00:02:32.056 - 00:02:32.792, Speaker A: That's crazy.
00:02:32.848 - 00:02:36.632, Speaker B: That's a crazy all token. Most people don't even know what it does.
00:02:36.728 - 00:02:39.104, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think it does much. That's just my opinion.
00:02:39.224 - 00:02:41.360, Speaker B: But, yeah, that's not the point.
00:02:41.432 - 00:02:45.520, Speaker A: No, but so, and then there was a broad rally that Thursday.
00:02:45.592 - 00:02:45.952, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:02:46.008 - 00:02:49.240, Speaker A: Bitcoin made really highs. ETH was up even more.
00:02:49.352 - 00:02:49.648, Speaker B: Right.
00:02:49.696 - 00:02:57.648, Speaker A: ETH BTC started all the other tokens named in various SEC filings and lawsuits as possibly securities. They all rallied.
00:02:57.736 - 00:02:58.604, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:02:59.144 - 00:03:06.896, Speaker A: But are we still. Ripple is showing some strength, like, still holding there, but most of the rest of the stuff has come back down, right?
00:03:06.960 - 00:03:38.640, Speaker B: For the most part, I would say so. With the exception of a couple of things like Solana has. Yeah, I guess pre that announcement. Yeah, most of the stuff has come off. I think that's just indicative of just positioning going into that ripple event, which was already crowded, but high level. I do think this is a constructive development for the broader argument of what is a security and what isn't and what can exchanges listen, they can't.
00:03:38.712 - 00:03:41.856, Speaker A: Yeah, it's tricky ruling. Like I was telling you, don't know.
00:03:41.880 - 00:03:47.048, Speaker B: What'S gonna happen on appeal. There's tons of variables gonna be case by case defense, but by the SEC.
00:03:47.176 - 00:03:47.608, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:03:47.656 - 00:03:50.328, Speaker B: Lots and lots of, like, ways to think about it.
00:03:50.376 - 00:04:04.940, Speaker A: I think clearly the SEC was a loser in the decision and ripple the exchanges, even just the cryptocurrency complex, was, I would say, at least a decent winner. I mean, I think Ripple a pretty big winner.
00:04:05.032 - 00:04:06.788, Speaker B: I mean, I think.
00:04:06.876 - 00:04:08.180, Speaker A: But there's still a lot of nuance there.
00:04:08.252 - 00:04:23.316, Speaker B: Still a lot of nuance. Absolutely. I think the way you're gonna keep score of who's winning one ripple price, two things, like Brian Armstrong getting invited.
00:04:23.380 - 00:04:25.468, Speaker A: To speak to a bunch of Democrats.
00:04:25.516 - 00:05:15.104, Speaker B: A bunch of democratic congressmen. It's gonna be whether or not an ETF gets approved, how quickly, et cetera, and how the narrative changes around the SEC's approach to crypto, et cetera. The soft points seem like they're going to be pretty huge right now, and we live in a very political and sort of image oriented world. And as you get closer to the election, if it becomes more apparent that the better story, better narrative is not the one the SEC is pursuing, but probe something else, I think that will bring better outcomes, better legislation, and it'll be good for crypto.
00:05:15.184 - 00:05:23.072, Speaker A: That is interesting. And when I think about the election, too, today there was just news. Robert F. Kennedy Junior had a pretty interesting plan.
00:05:23.128 - 00:05:24.760, Speaker B: He announced, oh, bitcoin, back dollar.
00:05:24.832 - 00:05:52.820, Speaker A: It's not just bitcoin, but it's gold, silver, platinum, hard asset. Yeah. He has a plan should he become elected to basically for the. Starting with new treasury issuance to back those issuances with hard assets. Some of them, I think starting at a smaller percentage and then growing as part of, I don't know, a sound money plan. That was kind of interesting. There's going to be a lot of.
00:05:52.820 - 00:06:03.124, Speaker A: I think he clearly thinks that there is voters there and there are. We know there's what, at least 20 million, you know, owners of bitcoin in the US. That's what the White House said.
00:06:04.024 - 00:06:07.424, Speaker B: Yeah. That's not the angle I would pursue if I was him personally.
00:06:07.464 - 00:06:08.804, Speaker A: I don't know if I would or wouldn't.
00:06:09.624 - 00:06:34.752, Speaker B: There's reasons why we were not on the gold standard. The arguments are pretty clear as to why you wouldn't. You know, same things with silver, platinum, other things of that nature. Bitcoin. Well, not gonna throughout the bitcoin one right just now. But I think what you're supposed to push for is just democratization of this asset.
00:06:34.888 - 00:06:35.656, Speaker A: Of access.
00:06:35.760 - 00:06:45.816, Speaker B: Yeah, of access. I shouldn't have to pay ridiculous bid offer every time that I want to pa by like $200 worth of bitcoin to be able to do it out of my retirement account, my tax advantaged.
00:06:45.880 - 00:06:58.488, Speaker A: Accounts wherever, maybe in most, like, retail platforms that I've used. If I buy $100 of bitcoin, I'm getting like $97 worth of it. 3% fee. It's insane. That's like, that's pretty common. Like that. That fee is pretty common.
00:06:58.536 - 00:07:08.832, Speaker B: Yeah. And, like, all we're asking for is just, you know, a product offering that's consistent with the technology and with the efficiency of scale that's available for every other product.
00:07:08.888 - 00:07:12.576, Speaker A: And this is kind of what Larry Fink said on Fox business, and he's dead.
00:07:12.640 - 00:07:12.960, Speaker B: Right.
00:07:13.032 - 00:07:13.376, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:13.440 - 00:07:41.644, Speaker B: Like, if there are 20 million crypto holders in the US, like, the government, by, like, not allowing them, it's just charging them money unfairly. Like, you're forcing people into an awful product. Like, the bito futures that have, like, poor tracking error. I know what the role moving double levered ETF's so that retail can get hosed. Like, trading this stuff. Like, it's just so antithetical to the ethos of what the SEC is supposed to be.
00:07:41.684 - 00:07:45.924, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think this is what Blackrock must be seeing. It feels like the narrative is shifting on that.
00:07:46.084 - 00:07:46.812, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:46.988 - 00:08:20.036, Speaker A: You even look and like they were saying things like, you know, oh, all the prior filings had a surveillance sharing agreement that looked at the futures markets and they were like oh no, no, it needs to look at the spot market and it's like, but the spider gold ETF, like gold trust or whatever the GLD, it surveills super. It is a commodity backed spot ETF that surveils the futures market. So like there's plenty of precedent. And you know why? Because there is no centralized spot market for bitcoin. There is no centralized spot market for gold. You can, like bitcoin's totally global. What are you going to, you can't monitor the spot market.
00:08:20.036 - 00:08:43.660, Speaker A: It's not a nice, it's not like an equity that trades in one stock exchange. Right. So that's why you, so even that like starts to seem wild. Like they're like they should. The commodity following, doing surveillance sharing agreement monitoring the futures market is sufficient for other assets, other commodities. Why not bitcoin? Right? Anyway, they've all gone around this by naming Coinbase as their spot market. But I just, I agree.
00:08:43.660 - 00:08:53.104, Speaker A: It feels like there's a dam has to break on that. Let's, let's, let's go back though. Let's, let's talk about some of the other macro stuff that's happening. Anything interesting since we last talked? I mean not a big data week, right?
00:08:53.184 - 00:09:13.480, Speaker B: Well, so last night, not in the US at least. The US data has been, you know, besides folks had the inflation reading, you know, last week and that's kind of the big one. Yeah, but we have, we had UK inflation come out last night, came in slightly softer than expected. You came in at 6.9 versus seven point.
00:09:13.512 - 00:09:16.368, Speaker A: Theirs has been worse than, but generally.
00:09:16.416 - 00:10:00.570, Speaker B: It kind of, what it seems like is that headline inflation has peaked and stuff is slowly trending lower. But there remain upside risks. And those upside risks, some of them are structural, like in the US with people locked into mortgages and so housing supply staying tight. And some of the other constraints are a little different and technical, like financial conditions, like all this other stuff. But the one thing I definitely need to mention though is oil. Oil has picked up a lot recently. So we've gone from the depths like 65 a barrel to almost 76, 77 in WTI crude and breadth's a bit higher.
00:10:00.570 - 00:10:05.618, Speaker B: But a big reason why headline inflation came down everywhere is because oil prices came down everywhere.
00:10:05.706 - 00:10:06.674, Speaker A: Oh, I see.
00:10:06.834 - 00:10:36.518, Speaker B: If you're going to start to see oil prices tick up, there's a risk that inflation accelerates a little bit, at least the stuff that's sensitive to energy prices. So that's one risk that's constantly on my mind, and I'm looking at those crude charts pretty closely. But outside of that, it does seem like you're having a little bit of synchronized global inflation cooldown. Knock on wood. Cause I know that's what central bankers.
00:10:36.566 - 00:10:38.234, Speaker A: Would want to do right now.
00:10:38.894 - 00:10:50.704, Speaker B: But realistically, this stuck between a rock and a hard place. And if I'm the fed, I am going to stay as hawkish as possible. I see the Nasdaq up 40%. I see home prices still ticking high. I see.
00:10:50.744 - 00:10:57.856, Speaker A: Was that 40% year to date, the Nasdaq? Yeah. That's unbelievable. I know that we've been having, I mean, one of the best years.
00:10:57.920 - 00:10:59.384, Speaker B: It's going to make your jaw drop.
00:10:59.504 - 00:11:04.136, Speaker A: It is. I mean, that's absolutely wild. That can't be something the Fed wants to see theoretically, right?
00:11:04.160 - 00:11:04.792, Speaker B: Absolutely not.
00:11:04.848 - 00:11:07.288, Speaker A: It's like people don't feel, who's going.
00:11:07.296 - 00:11:09.560, Speaker B: To feel poor when their entire retirement.
00:11:09.592 - 00:11:12.592, Speaker A: Account is up 40%? Year to date. My God.
00:11:12.648 - 00:11:13.428, Speaker B: Year to date.
00:11:13.576 - 00:11:24.500, Speaker A: Oh, my God. I didn't realize it was so big. The other ones that have, and then tech, big tech stocks have been doing great. Everything's unstoppable. It's bizarre.
00:11:24.532 - 00:11:27.948, Speaker B: I mean, we're at new all time highs and a bunch of the big tech names.
00:11:28.036 - 00:11:28.380, Speaker A: Crazy.
00:11:28.412 - 00:11:29.068, Speaker B: All time highs.
00:11:29.116 - 00:11:33.628, Speaker A: That's crazy. Cycle not year to date. Yeah. Wow.
00:11:33.716 - 00:11:41.664, Speaker B: Ever. And so it's, and then people, home prices haven't come off. Right. So where is people wealthy? Equity market. Housing market.
00:11:41.744 - 00:11:42.404, Speaker A: Yep.
00:11:42.744 - 00:11:45.128, Speaker B: People are going to feel poor when this stuff is rallying.
00:11:45.216 - 00:11:51.336, Speaker A: If their biggest assets are valuable, then they go out and spend their cash, then that's, yeah, that's part of.
00:11:51.440 - 00:12:02.320, Speaker B: But, you know, again, a lot of people don't have as much wealth. And so what you're focused on is, you know, everyone, and there are some things like, you know, student loan repayments that are going to happen starting.
00:12:02.352 - 00:12:02.680, Speaker A: That's true.
00:12:02.712 - 00:12:28.488, Speaker B: We've talked about. Yeah, and, yeah. So it's going to be a tale of two cities of sorts. But at the end of the day, if you want to tackle inflation, you can't have asset markets ripping. It's not supportive. And I think what the fed is thinking is like, well, monetary policy works with a lag. We're slowly draining liquidity from the market via Qt.
00:12:28.488 - 00:12:42.564, Speaker B: There's also more deficit spending happening, etcetera. You know, I think they're probably taking the more measured approach, which is, you know, in six months from now, we'll have drained $600 billion of liquidity where a stock's gonna be then, and where's the housing market gonna be then?
00:12:42.604 - 00:12:45.892, Speaker A: We'll reevaluate over that period. Right. We'll watch it closely, but in the.
00:12:45.908 - 00:12:49.084, Speaker B: Meantime, people are fomoing into stocks.
00:12:49.124 - 00:12:49.944, Speaker A: That's great.
00:12:50.284 - 00:12:52.076, Speaker B: I mean, meme names are popping off.
00:12:52.140 - 00:12:53.260, Speaker A: Really? For real? Yeah.
00:12:53.292 - 00:12:55.228, Speaker B: There was one that was up 40% today.
00:12:55.316 - 00:12:56.420, Speaker A: Oh, my. No.
00:12:56.532 - 00:12:59.144, Speaker B: And the guys were like, why is it up even?
00:12:59.684 - 00:13:01.436, Speaker A: Yeah. Was it up at all?
00:13:01.620 - 00:13:03.292, Speaker B: Yeah, literally. Exactly.
00:13:03.348 - 00:13:04.326, Speaker A: Goodness gracious.
00:13:04.500 - 00:13:11.274, Speaker B: So, you know, it's not, like, bad as it was in doge to dollar era. Right, right.
00:13:11.354 - 00:13:13.914, Speaker A: You know, when that was the good dog money time.
00:13:13.954 - 00:13:14.586, Speaker B: Good dog money.
00:13:14.690 - 00:13:15.738, Speaker A: That was fun. Dog money.
00:13:15.786 - 00:13:19.970, Speaker B: I mean, Elon pumped Doge today by 4% with a dog photo.
00:13:20.082 - 00:13:22.274, Speaker A: He posted his dog. Was it his dog or just.
00:13:22.314 - 00:13:27.914, Speaker B: I forgot what it was, but I saw that headline, doge up 4% on Elon tweet. I'm like, not again.
00:13:27.994 - 00:13:29.134, Speaker A: You're like, this world.
00:13:29.474 - 00:13:31.226, Speaker B: What do you even talk about? Doge?
00:13:31.330 - 00:13:33.076, Speaker A: He's just a picture of a dog.
00:13:33.210 - 00:13:34.720, Speaker B: Yeah, that's the world we're in.
00:13:34.752 - 00:13:38.488, Speaker A: Oh, my God. What a funny. What a weird market. An interesting market to follow.
00:13:38.576 - 00:13:40.432, Speaker B: No, it's super fun.
00:13:40.568 - 00:13:44.656, Speaker A: All right, well, Bimnet, our friend Bimnettabibi from Galaxy trading, as always, thank you so much.
00:13:44.760 - 00:13:45.664, Speaker B: Awesome. Have a good one.
