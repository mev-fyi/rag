00:00:00.440 - 00:00:44.900, Speaker A: It's an emerging market. When there's a gold boom in the west coast of the US, when there's a boom in China and a boom in India, and capital floods in and there's such high demand for funding, interest rates rise. That eventually causes the demise because capital gets too costly and it hampers innovation. I see it as an emerging market, and you have bitcoin, which is kind of like your store value, or gold. These are more like tech innovations. And it's really a lot of the tokens are like early stage venture, where one day it looks like it's the life saving thing, and the next day the future value could be a trillion or zero. So the volume between is just like, yeah, it's what makes the markets what they are.
00:00:44.900 - 00:00:49.324, Speaker A: And there's no fun. No more other place you'd rather be.
