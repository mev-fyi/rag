00:00:00.240 - 00:00:50.988, Speaker A: In the last couple minutes of the call, I wanted to do a fun little exercise with you. I went back to when the very first ACD call was had on Ethereum. This is the way that key critical governance decisions about Ethereum are made. And in the 200 mark, I think it's important that we all look back on how far Ethereum governance has come in these past 200 calls. So here are a couple of quick, fun facts about the history of these Ethereum ACD calls. So the very first ACD meeting that was recorded, there were notes from that meeting. There was no video, no live streaming links or anything that have survived.
00:00:50.988 - 00:00:57.140, Speaker A: Apparently the very first meeting of ethereum developers happened June 1, 2015.
