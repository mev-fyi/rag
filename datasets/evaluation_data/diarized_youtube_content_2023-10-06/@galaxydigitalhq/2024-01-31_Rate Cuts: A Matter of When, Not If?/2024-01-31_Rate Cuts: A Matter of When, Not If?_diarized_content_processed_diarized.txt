00:00:00.160 - 00:00:20.478, Speaker A: You know, while there's been fed pushback from a lot of speakers including Waller, most notably, you know, I think you had, you know, Jim Bullard who retired from the Fed and is now working at Purdue University. You know, he came out and was like I could see the Fed like starting cutting as early as March.
00:00:20.566 - 00:00:20.910, Speaker UNK: Yeah.
00:00:20.982 - 00:00:47.378, Speaker A: And he was one of the biggest like rate hike guys during the hiking cycle he was calling for 575% to 6%. At some point he's like when unemployment rate is giving you the gift of not going up a lot, you should be very aggressive. But now he's just like wait, where's inflation going to be in twelve months time and where do you want your rates to be when inflation is there?
00:00:47.426 - 00:00:55.874, Speaker B: This is the soft landing attempt. Maybe if they look forward to where they think the data is going to be they want to start cutting now so that the crash isn't hard. So it's not a hard landing.
