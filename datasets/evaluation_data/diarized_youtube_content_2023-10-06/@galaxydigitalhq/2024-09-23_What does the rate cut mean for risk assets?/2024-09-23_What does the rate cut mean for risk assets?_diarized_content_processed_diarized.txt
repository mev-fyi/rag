00:00:00.280 - 00:00:25.045, Speaker A: And so I just think that there's a little bit of a disconnect between the Fed cutting rates because stuff softening and kind of where forward earnings growth is expected to be. And so that's what I'm cognizant of right now. Particularly because you had the S and P at an all time high yesterday. Right. Right. And so your risk reward for holding these risk assets isn't. It didn't seem that attractive.
00:00:25.045 - 00:00:49.155, Speaker A: But I will caveat that with saying that generally, when you ease monetary policy and you ease financial conditions, that's broadly supportive of risk from the simple standpoint that cash ultimately has lesser value. But right now, the cash rates are still juicy. It's still very compelling.
