00:00:00.320 - 00:00:58.090, Speaker A: So much of the focus, I think, of what's going on in the ecosystem is on what can be built now based on what the Ethereum protocol is like now. And sure, there will be changes coming up in the future that will expedite or help certain initiatives on Ethereum, such as the roll up centric roadmap, to scale on Ethereum. Of course, peer Das will help with that. The types of announcements that are being made as even without these changes today, and regardless of when Petra is going to go live, because it's clear very slim chances Petra is going to be going live this year, regardless of when Petra goes live, the kind of innovation that's going to be happening on roll ups, the kind of innovation that's going to be happening to the MEV supply chain, kind of innovations that are going to be happening for staking, that's all chugging along with or without the protocol.
