00:00:00.240 - 00:00:04.342, Speaker A: Let's go to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:04.438 - 00:00:05.382, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:05.478 - 00:00:26.514, Speaker A: It's been a wild week. We were 38k bitcoin over the weekend and we ran to then we didn't stop running and we ran to $44,000 currently effectively there. 4309 six five as we talk. But good gosh, what have you seen?
00:00:26.674 - 00:00:59.464, Speaker B: Genuinely, I'm amazed at the price action, but I think it speaks to convexity of thought and the positive feedback loop that positive price action has. And so, put differently, people start to fomo the higher the price goes and the rationale associated or attributed to why the price is going starts to make more and more sense, or gets more and more validated as price continues to increase.
