00:00:08.560 - 00:00:55.750, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. Yo, we're back, ready to attack bitcoin's on the map yo, I'm building up my stack while I'm killing with the rap I'm bruising you in fact cause the beat will always slap yo, I'm slippin up a hill if there ain't no way to fall I'm winging with the calls Tellin Bim to give the ball when we begin going higher taco, fall. This is Nakamoto ball. Hit the block and drop em all. People always ask me, dog, you rhyme, why? That's like asking Christian why he's the bitcoin sign guy. It is obvious, yo, the future is anomalous but a present isn't. Obelisk cause down is the opposite I'm droppin it hot and spit rippin on the beat I'm obnoxious with stop it, kid.
00:00:55.750 - 00:01:41.396, Speaker A: There's no way to defeat cause I'm deadly with the medley and with every single casualty my ledger be expanding to the edges of the galaxy as always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmware research at Galaxy Digital. Thank you for listening to Galaxy brains. We have a great show for you today. Christian Langelis, CEO, founder of Terrell Corporation, longtime bitcoiner, urban advocate, and well known bitcoin sign guy, is our guest. We're going to get deep into it with him about bitcoin history, what he's building at Terrell Corporation for the Lightning Network and urbit, a new decentralized type of Internet you may have heard of but don't know much about. It's complicated, but we're going to get right into it. And of course, we're going to check in with our good friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading, as always, to talk markets.
00:01:41.396 - 00:02:17.348, Speaker A: Big, big bitcoin moves have been happening over the last week. We'll get into it with him. Before we get to that, I need to remind you to please refer to a link to disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Phineas, it's been a wild week, my friend. Bitcoin was trading at think the last time our, our show aired last week. It's now 44k fun to look back on the price. In previous episodes, we were talking about it, of doing some sort of montage of bitcoin price and the block clock behind you on your shoulder.
00:02:17.348 - 00:02:27.508, Speaker A: Above your shoulder. Yeah, it's a. I know. It's been quite a run. We know. We did the first episode of the year. I did a, the price was 1686.
00:02:27.508 - 00:02:36.514, Speaker A: Eight over my shoulder. And I said, I'm going to make 2023 the year of bitcoin in that rap.
00:02:36.554 - 00:02:37.250, Speaker B: That's right.
00:02:37.402 - 00:03:08.752, Speaker A: Hey, one odd news piece I saw, this one's pretty funny. Random news with Alex. It's our new segment in New Jersey. The headline said New Jersey police chased down pig named Albert Einswine. It says, police in New Jersey engaged in a brief foot chase with an unusual fugitive, a pig. The Deptford Township Police Department said in a Facebook post that officers responded to report a loose pig. The video shared by the department shows an officer chasing the pig into a road while trying to get a rope around its neck.
00:03:08.752 - 00:03:34.600, Speaker A: Quote, we're all friends here. The officer tells the pig, according to the department themselves, the pig was caught, he was fine, he got sent back to his home. And they admitted sometimes the jokes just write themselves. Right? So I don't know. I want you to defend part of the segment should be you defending the. Of this piece of news specifically. I thought, well, I think in this case, look, I'm not saying it.
00:03:34.600 - 00:03:43.072, Speaker A: They're saying it. The joke writes itself. They're all friends here. Right. You know, just imagine your local foot cop running after a wild hog down the street. It's just. It's funny.
00:03:43.072 - 00:03:57.556, Speaker A: I'm imagining it. Although I will say both of these last two have been animal related. Right? That's true. I'm just saying, you know, I guess we have a theme. I'll have to switch it up next time. Let's get right into the show. Let's go to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading.
00:03:57.556 - 00:03:59.708, Speaker A: As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:03:59.796 - 00:04:00.732, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:04:00.828 - 00:04:21.884, Speaker A: It's been a wild week. We were 38k bitcoin over the weekend and we ran to then we didn't stop running and we ran to $44,000 currently, effectively there, 4395 as we talk. But good gosh, what have you seen?
00:04:22.044 - 00:05:28.436, Speaker B: Genuinely, I'm amazed at the price action, but I think it speaks to convexity of thought and the positive feedback loop that positive price action has. And so, put differently, people start to fomo the higher the price goes and the rationale associated or attributed to why the price is going starts to make more and more sense or gets more and more validated as price continues to increase. I think what you're seeing is basically all of the merits of bitcoin and the positive catalysts that are coming, becoming more and more evident to more and more people. And it's coming at a time when broader risk markets are trading really well. It's coming at a time when the Fed is likely to be cutting and not putting a drag on financial markets markets. And it comes at a time that's before the ETF and the happening. And so there's just a lot of pieces that are coming together.
00:05:28.436 - 00:06:14.574, Speaker B: And I think folks are probably still dramatically underestimating the amount of flows that are just going to come into this product. Once an ETF is there. Basically for 14 years of bitcoin's existence, it's been one of the hardest products to own, ever or to trade. You go on your coinbase or whatever app you're on, the spreads are ridiculous. Custodying it, not being sure whether the place you're custodying it really has your tokens, not being sure the exchange is real, not being able to get financing or borrowing. There's so many things that get solved. You enter into the ecosystem that is all of these retirement funds that just accumulate assets, all these passive flows.
00:06:14.574 - 00:06:34.394, Speaker B: And then lastly, and most importantly, the biggest people in the world are telling you that this is a real asset and it belongs in your portfolio. I don't care who the hell you are. When Larry Fink gets on fucking tv and tells you it's a safe haven and is about to launch a huge.
00:06:34.434 - 00:06:35.618, Speaker A: Product and you're about to need it.
00:06:35.626 - 00:06:59.436, Speaker B: I don't care who you are, how smart you are. That man has $10 trillion in assets under management. He speaks, you listen. And so I think there's just been a complete paradigm shift in the thinking around crypto, and rightfully so. And now people are like, oh, shit, bitcoin's at. I'll tell you how hard it is in this market. I'm a bitcoin bull.
00:06:59.436 - 00:07:03.572, Speaker B: I've been one. And everybody can listen to the podcast, go back a year.
00:07:03.628 - 00:07:04.252, Speaker A: They know.
00:07:04.388 - 00:07:34.604, Speaker B: They know Alex Thorne is an Og. Bitcoiner goes way, way back. And we're still shocked at this price action a little bit. But in theory, it's so crazy. It's like, why are we so scared of our thesis being right? This is the manifestation of all that we have been talking about for years, just manifesting itself on price, and it's gonna continue. Why couldn't you be at 60k in two weeks?
00:07:34.684 - 00:07:35.460, Speaker A: No, you could.
00:07:35.532 - 00:07:38.364, Speaker B: I personally don't like assets that rush up in value that.
00:07:38.404 - 00:07:46.300, Speaker A: No, I agree. You wanna settle a bit. It was nice in the thirties, right. We sort of like, gained steam ground up, but built a better base down there. Yeah.
00:07:46.412 - 00:07:53.036, Speaker B: But now it's just. It's getting a little uncomfortable. But I don't think that's gonna deter people.
00:07:53.140 - 00:07:53.564, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:53.644 - 00:08:08.172, Speaker B: It might encourage more and more of them, to be honest with you. But you know what? The last thing I wanna touch on, or not the last, but one of the things I wanna touch on is just the supply side dynamics. Right. Like, you've talked about how much supply hasn't moved in over a year.
00:08:08.228 - 00:08:13.076, Speaker A: It's like 80%. Yeah. That doesn't happen in financial assets. Yeah.
00:08:13.100 - 00:08:15.316, Speaker B: The float of this thing is really small.
00:08:15.420 - 00:08:15.964, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:16.084 - 00:08:23.508, Speaker B: And like, I just don't know. Like, there's going to be an inflection point in the flow that takes you.
00:08:23.516 - 00:08:24.476, Speaker A: To tips it all the way over.
00:08:24.500 - 00:08:32.780, Speaker B: Just tips it all the way over where there's just no offside liquidity. Could that come at like 3 billion of incremental flow? Could that come at six? I'm not sure.
00:08:32.852 - 00:08:33.372, Speaker A: Right.
00:08:33.508 - 00:08:41.440, Speaker B: But if we're talking about an ETF product that's likely going to draw at least 10 billion in assets, like, you're gonna. It's gonna happen.
00:08:41.512 - 00:09:10.704, Speaker A: So one thing I looked at along these lines was the, you know, if you look on the glass node or other tools, you can see the long term holder supply versus the short term holder supply. You can bucket that any way you want. You can call it, I think for that specific metric, they say 155 days held or longer. That's long term, 155 days or shorter. And they have a methodology for why they picked that. But you could look at any timeframe, you could say a year versus, you know, within moved last three months. Whatever it is, the long term holders are still accumulating.
00:09:10.704 - 00:09:29.144, Speaker A: They're going up at every of the last two, like December 2017 and fall 2021. Bull market tops. Those long term holders eventually sell to short term holders and they dip. Right. Which makes sense. Right. Because the market is searching.
00:09:29.144 - 00:09:34.852, Speaker A: It has demand from new entrants and it's searching for a price at which the long term holders will give it to them.
00:09:34.928 - 00:09:35.356, Speaker B: Correct.
00:09:35.460 - 00:09:53.732, Speaker A: You haven't seen any decline. You see a continued increase in long term holder supply, which to me tells me that, well, it absolutely says, well, we're definitely not at the top. Like, because long term holders did not hold. Imagine if you even bought higher than this or even bought lower than this. You didn't hold. Hold through everything. We just went through the last two years.
00:09:53.732 - 00:10:00.316, Speaker A: And then you're like, you know what? 43k, that's my number. Who's selling at these levels? Right? Like, doesn't make sense.
00:10:00.380 - 00:10:01.384, Speaker B: Doesn't make any sense.
00:10:01.524 - 00:10:18.216, Speaker A: And you can see it also in exchange balances in a variety of other metrics. We're just not there yet. And to your point, there are plenty of reasons for it to go higher. There's narrative events, there's market access vehicles, actual supply chains, actual supply things happening. So it's an exciting thing historically.
00:10:18.280 - 00:10:35.688, Speaker B: I mean, I think a lot of assets, especially ones with as much frenzy as crypto and bitcoin, you typically top with a blow off top candle. Like with a blow off, it moves 10,000 points in a day and it's like, oh my God, going to infinity. You really haven't had that moment yet.
00:10:35.736 - 00:10:36.088, Speaker A: No.
00:10:36.176 - 00:10:37.768, Speaker B: And you're not even at all time highs.
00:10:37.816 - 00:11:05.474, Speaker A: I mean, the price action from 28 to 35 and then the grind that we did for like two and a half weeks where we just sort of grind it up to 40, that was one of the most bullish charts I've ever seen. It was like, it was mo. It was flat. It was a tight, relatively tight range, but not actually flat, just slightly higher and higher and higher. But like clear trend, high lows, higher true channel. It shows significant ongoing bid. Right.
00:11:05.474 - 00:11:33.842, Speaker A: And we know where some of it's coming from. We've seen Saylor in the market, we've seen retail aggregators. And the other thing that I like about this is that we know this anecdotally from our business. There's not a lot of institutions in yet. You can see that there's some institutional money. If you look like CME shows us, we think those are consistently high base, but we know, I know a lot of institutional traders that like this asset class may even have traded it in the past, and they're not. And the pain traded for them is higher.
00:11:33.938 - 00:11:40.522, Speaker B: Yeah. I was speaking to a shop today that managed over ten yards or $10 billion in money and they still can't touch it.
00:11:40.578 - 00:11:44.986, Speaker A: Right. But I even mean, of the ones I know can touch it, many of.
00:11:45.010 - 00:11:56.786, Speaker B: Them are just not back yet and they're not in real size. And you know what's the crazy part is all of those folks had, they had a small allocation to bitcoin this year. I mean, they'd be crushing their peers.
00:11:56.850 - 00:12:00.422, Speaker A: I mean, if you bought at the beginning of the year, you're up 150%.
00:12:00.438 - 00:12:07.422, Speaker B: Or this year with a small portion of your portfolio, it would have been risk reducing.
00:12:07.478 - 00:12:09.398, Speaker A: We've done the math on that. It is.
00:12:09.486 - 00:12:13.342, Speaker B: And again, it's so crazy. I mean, in this meeting today, it's just like.
00:12:13.358 - 00:12:13.766, Speaker A: It's just.
00:12:13.830 - 00:12:17.670, Speaker B: The guy was like, it's so hard to ignore this thing. It's up 150%.
00:12:17.742 - 00:12:40.250, Speaker A: Wait until it happens again. That's what I'm saying. Let's say you have the mandate to do it. You're one of the funds that actually can already gain access, and you haven't this cycle. Let's say we hit 50. Just for simple math, you're telling me that in just the last three months, you missed a 65% move in an asset? You're bullish on that. You have a mandate to invest in.
00:12:40.250 - 00:12:42.794, Speaker A: Wake up, portfolio managers. This thing is not.
00:12:42.834 - 00:12:43.114, Speaker B: I know.
00:12:43.154 - 00:12:49.002, Speaker A: And by the way, I say this, it might feel like you're late, but, like, we're saying they're not. People aren't here yet.
00:12:49.138 - 00:12:49.602, Speaker B: I agree.
00:12:49.658 - 00:12:50.770, Speaker A: Look at the Google searches.
00:12:50.802 - 00:12:51.114, Speaker B: No, no.
00:12:51.154 - 00:12:52.322, Speaker A: Yeah, there's nothing.
00:12:52.378 - 00:12:53.202, Speaker B: Got room to go.
00:12:53.258 - 00:12:54.574, Speaker A: Yeah, that's what I mean.
00:12:55.424 - 00:13:20.724, Speaker B: So I think you're hitting on an interesting point where you've kind of flipped in the sense that, let's say, at the start of this year, if you're a risk manager trying to get crypto into a portfolio, when you go up to your board or whoever makes the final decisions, it used to be that it was more risk than it was worth.
00:13:21.248 - 00:13:21.400, Speaker A: Right?
00:13:21.400 - 00:13:30.640, Speaker B: Like, if it. You're a treasury manager or, like, somebody managing a large pool of money, like, why are you gonna stake your reputation on this thing? And now it's like, why didn't you.
00:13:30.712 - 00:13:31.160, Speaker A: Right?
00:13:31.272 - 00:13:33.264, Speaker B: And so the tables have so turned.
00:13:33.304 - 00:13:41.384, Speaker A: Oh, they have. Yeah. That was great. They really have. I mean, again, like. And it will be more true.
00:13:41.424 - 00:13:45.408, Speaker B: I wasn't even talking about bitcoin. Like, there's so much else going on in crypto right now. So many.
00:13:45.456 - 00:13:46.384, Speaker A: There really is. But.
00:13:46.464 - 00:13:49.320, Speaker B: But it's like, it's not even relevant. I mean, like, in the context of.
00:13:49.392 - 00:13:52.344, Speaker A: There is interesting stuff. Well, let's save it for another day, because.
00:13:52.424 - 00:13:52.848, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:13:52.896 - 00:14:06.200, Speaker A: The bitcoin move, it really did. I mean, even last week, I think you rightly said, and I've said, too, that, like, you know, it'd be reasonable for us to have a healthy little dip here. It's been. We've been grinding higher. We're up huge. Like, I still think that, by the way, I don't think.
00:14:06.232 - 00:14:08.328, Speaker B: Yeah, I know. Happen in bull trends all the time.
00:14:08.376 - 00:14:12.632, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. And that's. That's good. I think that helps solidify a base and stuff.
00:14:12.688 - 00:14:17.528, Speaker B: So, I mean, you're not wrong all the time. I mean, you literally, like, you had.
00:14:17.656 - 00:14:22.352, Speaker A: 20% correction a couple of days ago. Yeah. Went down like 1%. Yeah.
00:14:22.368 - 00:14:29.564, Speaker B: I mean, like, the bitcoin defi tokens. I've had a big correction last year. I'm like, oh, my God. And now they're back up.
00:14:31.704 - 00:14:39.192, Speaker A: I mean, they're, like, levered. I mean, almost everything in this space is effectively levered. Bitcoin. Right. Like, everything from a beta standpoint. Yeah.
00:14:39.208 - 00:14:39.928, Speaker B: Except stable coins.
00:14:39.976 - 00:14:46.216, Speaker A: Yeah. Except salesperson. That went to three exits. Oh, yeah. He said, yeah. I don't know what it was.
00:14:46.280 - 00:14:48.164, Speaker B: It was like the new euro stable.
00:14:48.504 - 00:14:58.844, Speaker A: Stable that, like, was trading at $3 instead of $1 or €3. Whatever. Yeah. Things can get wacky out there. Look, let's wrap it here. It's. I still feels like a bitcoin story.
00:14:59.144 - 00:15:00.216, Speaker B: Long live the corn.
00:15:00.280 - 00:15:03.440, Speaker A: Yeah. Bim netabeebeebeebee from Galaxy trading, my friend. Thank you, as always.
00:15:03.592 - 00:15:04.404, Speaker C: Pleasure.
00:15:06.384 - 00:15:18.720, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guests, Christian Langelis, bitcoiner, known as Bitcoin Sign guy, and also founder of Terrell Corporation, which is building a lot of stuff, including a new implementation for the lightning network. Christian, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:15:18.792 - 00:15:19.784, Speaker C: Thank you for having me.
00:15:19.864 - 00:15:55.476, Speaker A: I've wanted to have Christian on for a while. I've known Christian for a while. At this point, we're also going to talk a bit about urbit, which we'll get into even what that is. I don't even want to preface it, but, Christian, you've been involved and interested in bitcoin for a long time, and as I mentioned, you did a publicity stunt, and I apologize. You must have to start every podcast you do with this discussion. But you did a publicity stunt where you held up a famous buy bitcoin sign that you had scrawled, it looked like, in average millennial young males handwriting. It was scrawled by bitcoin.
00:15:55.540 - 00:15:56.620, Speaker C: It was for sure with a sharpie.
00:15:56.652 - 00:16:07.988, Speaker A: And you held it up behind at the time. Then, I believe, Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen during congressional testimony. And that is a. That's a pretty potent long term bitcoin meme.
00:16:08.116 - 00:16:09.812, Speaker C: Thank you. Well, thank you.
00:16:09.868 - 00:16:11.412, Speaker A: What made you decide to do that?
00:16:11.548 - 00:16:25.286, Speaker C: Well, I. The summer prior, I was working at a global macro hedge fund, and they're always glued to the tube when the Fed chair is speaking. So it was really just my, hello. Look at me. I'm on tv.
00:16:25.350 - 00:16:32.638, Speaker A: That's funny, because you must have been at the fund and been like, the bitcoin, the young bitcoin guy that was telling them about bitcoin. Okay, whatever.
00:16:32.686 - 00:16:34.470, Speaker C: They didn't take me too seriously, but.
00:16:34.622 - 00:16:36.234, Speaker A: They must have thought that was funny.
00:16:36.814 - 00:17:12.002, Speaker C: I guess so. I mean, I had that fund was actually the reason why I, that was the final straw for going all in on bitcoin was that I thought I grew up thinking that markets were real. And then you work at enough places like that and you realize, in fact, they are fake, and it's just all reflexivity over the dot plot, and there's, there's no true free market element to it.
00:17:12.058 - 00:17:15.894, Speaker A: Are you telling me that the Federal Reserve manipulates the price of money?
00:17:17.634 - 00:17:19.226, Speaker C: Neither confirm nor defined, but I thought.
00:17:19.250 - 00:17:21.054, Speaker A: It was the business cycle.
00:17:22.714 - 00:17:24.450, Speaker C: Controversial ideas there.
00:17:24.522 - 00:17:31.974, Speaker A: So, Christian, tell me about Urbit. Let's do a bit of a discussion on urbit, because you introduced me to urbit.
00:17:32.354 - 00:17:32.914, Speaker C: That's right.
00:17:32.954 - 00:17:35.670, Speaker A: You gave me my first planet way.
00:17:35.702 - 00:17:36.374, Speaker C: Back in the day.
00:17:36.454 - 00:17:43.934, Speaker A: Yeah. So let me try to set this up, and then you're going to correct me, which I will sorely need.
00:17:44.014 - 00:17:44.534, Speaker C: Let's do it.
00:17:44.574 - 00:17:49.726, Speaker A: It's an alternative implementation of sort of basic Internet architecture. Is that right?
00:17:49.910 - 00:17:54.478, Speaker C: Yes. It's a refounding of personal computing.
00:17:54.646 - 00:18:18.388, Speaker A: So let's break that down a little bit. You have, I don't know, today I've got a computer, physical computer. I maybe send requests over TCP, or I query a DNS server to find a website, and then the website serves it from some centralized server down TCIP to my IP address. And how is it different than that?
00:18:18.556 - 00:18:25.924, Speaker C: Well, right now your devices are mostly, or I should say entirely clients to external servers.
00:18:26.044 - 00:18:27.912, Speaker A: So just call data elsewhere.
00:18:28.108 - 00:18:55.574, Speaker C: That's right, yeah. So the real thing is that the Internet as we know it is, yes. TCP IP, but also Unix. And the Internet as the general suite of products that we think of when we think of using our computers in a networked way was built up over the course of at least 30 years.
00:18:55.654 - 00:18:56.110, Speaker A: Right.
00:18:56.222 - 00:19:45.346, Speaker C: And frankly, there was of course, some sort of chaotic order to it in that the Internet lets us accomplish unimaginable things these days. We definitely like the Internet that urban. That being said, given that it was built at, built across time, the way that the system fits together is, I wouldn't say maybe disharmonious is too strong of a word, but certainly it is not easily cognizable in the mind of a single engineer, much less user.
00:19:45.450 - 00:19:51.214, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's a little bit of a Frankenstein's monster with like layers and pieces all sort of built on top of itself.
00:19:51.294 - 00:20:02.206, Speaker C: The complexity is so vast that basically nobody, no single person can understand how they relate to their network.
00:20:02.310 - 00:20:10.814, Speaker A: It's so interesting. So then the idea of urbit is to say, okay, we know what we like as an end state. Was there a better way to get there?
00:20:10.934 - 00:20:21.738, Speaker C: Correct. It's truly just a distillation of what has been revealed as the core purposes of the Internet.
00:20:21.786 - 00:20:23.754, Speaker A: Right. Which we didn't really know when they started. Right.
00:20:23.794 - 00:20:24.394, Speaker C: We did not know.
00:20:24.434 - 00:20:33.066, Speaker A: ARPANet was like, an emergency email service for, like, Stanford and, like, I don't know, wherever else. Like some government and research locations, right?
00:20:33.130 - 00:20:34.194, Speaker C: Yes, indeed.
00:20:34.274 - 00:20:38.778, Speaker A: And now it's, you know, now we got dog money and, like, you know, TikTok videos.
00:20:38.906 - 00:20:39.426, Speaker C: Correct.
00:20:39.530 - 00:20:43.482, Speaker A: Now we know that that's the core use for the Internet. Dog money and TikTok videos, that's what.
00:20:43.498 - 00:21:23.704, Speaker C: The Internet is for. And so urbit takes a whole inventory of what we'd like to do with computers and tries to boil it down into just a diamond perfect system that ultimately will never need to be updated again. So it's actually Kelvin versioned, which means the versions go down rather than up, which means that sort of like bitcoin, it has this tendency toward ossification, and obviously that's a benefit to simplicity, tractability, legibility, etcetera.
00:21:23.784 - 00:21:34.644, Speaker A: So just from the pure network architecture, maybe we'll just start with the lingo, the terminology. You have planets and what, galaxies?
00:21:35.864 - 00:22:17.814, Speaker C: Galaxy. Did someone say galaxy? Urbit is two, or maybe you could say three primary components. There is an os, we call it arvo, that is a kernel, an interpreter. Kernel modules for doing all of your computational tasks. Timers, file system, build system, et cetera. And then you have a network which is stringing those oses together. And then you also have the third we call the network.
00:22:17.814 - 00:22:39.296, Speaker C: Well, actually, there's two network protocols now we'll just call it aims. And then there's a third component, which is called azimuth, which is basically the. The namespace of erbit. And that's where you get those names. I don't know if you saw that viral tweet yesterday. Gloop glorp.
00:22:39.360 - 00:22:40.144, Speaker A: Gloop glorp.
00:22:40.224 - 00:22:40.536, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:22:40.600 - 00:22:42.768, Speaker A: Mine's Dastit Witcham.
00:22:42.856 - 00:22:44.912, Speaker C: Yeah. Pindet Timut. That's me.
00:22:44.968 - 00:22:47.712, Speaker A: That's my, like, DNS name, basically, on urbit.
00:22:47.768 - 00:22:55.368, Speaker C: The point of those names is that they're human legible, but they're. But they're not human signifying. And they're. And yes, they are also unique.
00:22:55.416 - 00:22:55.840, Speaker A: Right?
00:22:55.952 - 00:22:59.284, Speaker C: So they're not. They're not largely rivalrous.
00:22:59.444 - 00:23:03.812, Speaker A: I see. It's not like, oh, mine's better than yours. I'm not gonna get like Google.com.
00:23:03.948 - 00:23:08.716, Speaker C: There happen to be a few names that are, that do actually turn into English.
00:23:08.740 - 00:23:11.596, Speaker A: Cause they like came out like kind of legit. And now people like those ones.
00:23:11.660 - 00:23:15.716, Speaker C: Yeah, there's a bunch of masters and so people go after those.
00:23:15.780 - 00:23:16.292, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:23:16.348 - 00:23:20.652, Speaker C: There's a lot of blank, blank pilled pill ed.
00:23:20.828 - 00:23:23.276, Speaker A: So orange pill.
00:23:23.340 - 00:23:27.734, Speaker C: Do I know what it I've been after? Been red pilled.
00:23:29.714 - 00:23:30.714, Speaker A: I like that.
00:23:30.874 - 00:23:33.654, Speaker C: I don't know. So Osama bin red pill.
00:23:34.314 - 00:23:48.130, Speaker A: It is literally a new topography computing and network topography. Right. And it does it use, so it doesn't use. It has to go through the same series of tubes that is the Internet. Right.
00:23:48.162 - 00:24:23.818, Speaker C: Great question. So right now we call it an overlay OS. So you install Arvo as a virtual machine running on your Unix device. Whether that's most likely just something running in the cloud, it could be AWS, GCP or it could be a physical device. So there's a node in a box company for urbit called Native Planet. They probably have the nicest looking personal node on the market, metal enclosure. Very nice.
00:24:23.866 - 00:24:24.354, Speaker A: Love it.
00:24:24.434 - 00:24:25.186, Speaker C: Shout out to them.
00:24:25.250 - 00:24:32.954, Speaker A: That sounds awesome. I do actually love, even when it comes to bitcoin, some of the standalone node products I've had many over the years. Yeah, they're just easy.
00:24:32.994 - 00:24:34.882, Speaker C: I had the Casa node back in the day.
00:24:34.938 - 00:24:35.654, Speaker A: Me too.
00:24:36.394 - 00:24:59.814, Speaker C: It's a troubled category because it's a category so far ahead of its time. I personally think that the personal node for that to really take off, well, it will start as a luxury product. When people have some luxury need and it's like, oh, you're just using the cloud or you're using the public Internet.
00:24:59.854 - 00:25:00.950, Speaker A: That's like, oh, you don't have your.
00:25:00.982 - 00:25:07.790, Speaker C: Own urbit planet box riding a crowded subway car. Not that I didn't ride the subway here.
00:25:07.862 - 00:25:08.686, Speaker A: Right, of course.
00:25:08.790 - 00:25:20.526, Speaker C: But once it becomes a luxury product, I think that it'll work better long term. Whoever makes modems. Motorola, I don't know who makes those things.
00:25:20.550 - 00:25:21.566, Speaker A: I don't know. Like Netgear.
00:25:21.670 - 00:25:29.158, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that that's where Netgear is, a hyperstitional orbit company.
00:25:29.286 - 00:25:49.786, Speaker A: I think that's right. I also thought that was true for even bitcoin standalone nodes that the router like, right. You don't want to always keep plugging in more devices, but it makes a lot of sense for your network router or your cable modem sometimes with the same device to have these computing things in them. Whether it's a bitcoin full node or an orbit node. By the way, you can run bitcoin on orbit, right?
00:25:49.810 - 00:25:54.930, Speaker C: Yeah. You can also run, you can run orbit on an umbrella.
00:25:55.002 - 00:25:58.554, Speaker A: Yeah. Oh, can you? Because I have that umbrella. That's the one I use now, the umbrella home.
00:25:58.594 - 00:25:59.174, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:25:59.634 - 00:26:04.770, Speaker A: That's a very high quality device with very high quality with like lots of compute and. Yeah, yeah.
00:26:04.802 - 00:26:22.798, Speaker C: Shout out to the umbral team. So look, I don't want to be bombastic and say something like personal server revolution. That would be the most meme ified, I think, that version of it. But I think we're maybe at the prehistory to a personal server.
00:26:22.966 - 00:26:50.414, Speaker A: Let's go a little bit there with the vision of it, because what I hear when I learn about and am told about urbit is a more user centric, decentralized Internet, one where you can run your own personal server, right, and you can connect more organically with the rest of the web rather than basically just sending a line into Comcast and saying, please send me my website data.
00:26:50.494 - 00:27:21.198, Speaker C: Well, yes, it's that you're connecting more organically or dare I say rhizomatically in a more distributed fashion. However, I think that perhaps to put a more political word on it, you could say you engage with the Internet as a first class citizen and not really as a cuck or a surf on someone else's surf, not as a digital surf on someone else's data silo.
00:27:21.246 - 00:27:26.502, Speaker A: Because I don't think people realize the Internet broadly is a big giant word.
00:27:26.598 - 00:27:27.902, Speaker C: It's about five computers.
00:27:27.958 - 00:27:29.822, Speaker A: Yeah, yes, exactly.
00:27:29.878 - 00:27:33.250, Speaker C: I mean, you've got the Amazon, Facebook.
00:27:33.442 - 00:28:03.668, Speaker A: And then you have a category of the DNS. Occasionally you get a DDoS attack on a major DNS server. There's one in New Hampshire, I forget, it's a huge, it does domain name service and resolution for most of the east coast Internet clients. So you can just take that down. And then when you type Google.com, comma, it doesn't go anywhere because there's no server saying, because that's not how the Internet works. It doesn't use domain names, it uses IP addresses.
00:28:03.668 - 00:28:24.436, Speaker A: And it needs to ask the DNS server what IP address goes to google.com right now for this person. And that does make you unbelievably beholden to these. That's not even, that's like basic architecture. That's not even, you don't need that. Like, you don't need the DNS server. I could just theoretically go to like any IP address that is serving a web front end.
00:28:24.436 - 00:28:25.804, Speaker A: Like an HTTP front end.
00:28:25.884 - 00:28:26.348, Speaker C: That's right.
00:28:26.396 - 00:28:35.276, Speaker A: It's just that that's not human readable. So we rely on these intermediaries. So, yeah, it's more self sovereign version of the Internet.
00:28:35.380 - 00:28:36.644, Speaker C: That's a popular word for it.
00:28:36.684 - 00:28:45.532, Speaker A: I like that. So how does that interact with bitcoin? Or how did you get interested? First of all, I mentioned that there is a bitcoin client on urbit, right?
00:28:45.588 - 00:28:49.268, Speaker C: Yes. I am perhaps directly responsible for that.
00:28:49.316 - 00:28:50.624, Speaker A: Yeah, urbit coin.
00:28:51.204 - 00:30:12.276, Speaker C: I call it the Urbit coin project. I ultimately, where I first came to urbit via bitcoin, I was living out in SF and working at a bitcoin fund, and my social circle actually became the urbit crowd because urbit actually, and this is a digression, actually has a broader cultural surface than any other crypto project, mainly because it is general purpose computing. There's space for people who aren't, excuse me, crypto bros or crypto nerds to get into it. So very strong non financialized interest in urbit. This became my social scene in San Francisco. And then you realize the completely the depth of this, call it cypherpunk, roots of urbit. And I quickly recognized, it's obvious that it is the most complementary system to bitcoin and other public blockchains.
00:30:12.380 - 00:30:23.364, Speaker A: So would you say that it is the, the true decentralized world computer? It has no. There isn't to be, there's no blockchain. Well, there is no, and there's no token.
00:30:23.444 - 00:30:37.188, Speaker C: But the compute is decentralized. So obviously it's the. I bristle at the word democratization of compute, but it is what people mean if they would say that.
00:30:37.236 - 00:30:58.448, Speaker A: This sounds to me like, this sounds like, I hate to say this, but I'm going to say it sounds like web3. It sounds like another version, a whole nother instantiation of what people think web3 could be. Right. It's a whole different way for the web to work. Is it web four? It can't be web five. I think square has web five locked down.
00:30:58.576 - 00:31:14.908, Speaker C: Oddly enough, we actually. The true irony, and this goes back to the architecture of the Internet, Curtis started working on orbit in 2002. Yeah, so that was before the web two revolution.
00:31:14.996 - 00:31:15.452, Speaker A: True.
00:31:15.548 - 00:32:08.154, Speaker C: And the reason why he started working on it then was basically you could, if you have, it's like looking at the framing of a house, and you can tell if it's gonna be a good house or a bad house just based on how it's framed. There's a certain teleology to Internet architecture, and you could tell in 2002 that, okay, AOL1 eternal September cascaded upon, I can't say us because I wasn't really using the computer back then, but there was a certain transparency to the way that the Internet would resolve to be these large megacorps.
00:32:08.194 - 00:32:09.074, Speaker A: You could see it even then.
00:32:09.114 - 00:32:12.574, Speaker C: You could see it even then. And that's pre Facebook, right?
00:32:13.274 - 00:32:24.814, Speaker A: That is pre Facebook. I think Facebook's about 2003 four. But that was, and that was really pre Amazon as anything other than a bookseller, right?
00:32:25.394 - 00:32:27.594, Speaker C: I mean, from that early point you could tell.
00:32:27.634 - 00:32:29.322, Speaker A: Okay, so there was a need.
00:32:29.378 - 00:32:40.866, Speaker C: This is beyond dealing with networked applications, is beyond the comprehension of the average user, even perhaps the average developer.
00:32:41.010 - 00:33:14.100, Speaker A: So in some ways it's, you have this highly decentralized but limited original ARPANet Internet, right? I mean, it's messaging basically. And it theoretically was like in the case of a nuclear war, right? It was like supposed to be highly resilient, but it had no features. And then that just expand first, then you get bulletin boards and eventually email, and then you get the AOL 1.0 in the nineties. That kind of like actually makes it consumer friendly to do something. But it's totally centralized. Right.
00:33:14.100 - 00:33:37.840, Speaker A: But then they add im and then you end up getting into the web. Two, revolution where that once highly distributed and decentralized experience, which did have pork user experience, of course, just like scientists only. Yes, well, but you end up with this extremely centralized but good user experience. And now you wonder, is there a way to, dare I say, return?
00:33:38.032 - 00:33:41.672, Speaker C: Re tavern. Re taverning to tradition, right?
00:33:41.768 - 00:33:51.884, Speaker A: But now we have better technology and we know what the end state we want. We know that we do want social media. We do want distributed applications. We know what a lot of them are.
00:33:52.294 - 00:34:33.874, Speaker C: Most people only realize that because of the abuses of the last decade, because of loss of privacy, lapse of just user sovereignty, everyone online attempting to start any type of organic, social or business operation is quickly confronted by the fact that you can't really start an intentional community online without being completely at the mercy of your host. So I think it's been said by some urban person, you can't, you wouldn't try to start an intentional community at the Marriott.
00:34:34.034 - 00:34:59.734, Speaker A: Interesting, interesting. Yeah, because you have to use Facebook or Twitter or discord or telegram or, I mean, right. There is no, but what about. Okay, so just as an aside, it's not directly related, but it's similar like mastodon or like blue skies. Is that like, do those blue sky attempts additional? They're indicative of the same demand, right?
00:35:00.034 - 00:35:02.434, Speaker C: I would say all of those recent.
00:35:02.554 - 00:35:06.930, Speaker A: Or Noster, Farcaster Noster.
00:35:07.042 - 00:36:10.170, Speaker C: I would say all of those projects indicate the interest in sovereign compute. However, unfortunately for those projects, and not entirely unfortunately, they'll get some adoption, but they don't resolve the question of general purpose computer. Those applications are single applications. And so far, they're mainly just single applications. And in the ICO craze, you saw certain people try to replicate some of those applications entirely on blockchains. And the obvious flaw with that is that it's too much to put everyone's compute into a single thread. Yeah, you can't feasibly do that.
00:36:10.170 - 00:36:40.166, Speaker C: You wouldn't want to do that for privacy reasons. But that's a non starter scaling wise. Even with the far extent of, say, zero knowledge or take the best scaling tricks you have up your sleeve, it's still unworkable. Why would you want to clear the dog photo you're sending to your mom on a global ledger?
00:36:40.230 - 00:37:06.364, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's right. I think about that sometimes with payments. So maybe this may be a good transition, but sometimes people say, dude, why didn't you. Oh, you love bitcoin. Why don't you buy that thing in bitcoin? I'm like, well, there's a couple answers to that, but one of them is like that coffee with layer one bitcoin. I don't need my coffee. Purchase preserved in all perpetuity on the digital stone tablet that is the bitcoin blockchain.
00:37:06.364 - 00:37:10.080, Speaker A: It just doesn't rise to that level of fidelity required.
00:37:10.192 - 00:37:10.884, Speaker C: Correct.
00:37:11.504 - 00:37:17.840, Speaker A: But people do like to spend bitcoin using something that is off chain or more ephemeral. Like the lightning network.
00:37:17.952 - 00:37:18.568, Speaker C: That's right.
00:37:18.656 - 00:37:28.254, Speaker A: Maybe this is a good transition. What is Terrell Corporation? And maybe, before we go, actually, how did you decide to found it and what is it?
00:37:28.634 - 00:37:32.574, Speaker C: So I was working at Talon Corp.
00:37:32.914 - 00:37:34.474, Speaker A: As an urbit company.
00:37:34.634 - 00:37:44.354, Speaker C: If you're starting an urbit company, there's sort of a meme where we all, in maybe a post ironic fashion, we all call our companies just blank corporations.
00:37:44.434 - 00:37:54.632, Speaker A: I know, it's kind of funny. It reminds me of the hacker show that they had for a while on FX. Phineas, you know what I'm talking about. That hacker show was like Evil Corp.
00:37:54.768 - 00:37:55.752, Speaker C: Evil Corp.
00:37:55.888 - 00:37:59.880, Speaker A: I can't remember either way, it's embarrassing that I remember.
00:37:59.992 - 00:38:06.136, Speaker C: There's another Irvit company, recent, more recent startup called Death to the corporation.
00:38:06.240 - 00:38:07.204, Speaker A: That's pretty good.
00:38:08.504 - 00:38:22.740, Speaker C: So I was working at Talon. They were the first. They are the first corporate champion of the Urbit project. Curtis founded Mister Robot.
00:38:22.772 - 00:38:23.148, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks.
00:38:23.196 - 00:39:22.620, Speaker C: Oh, yes. Curtis founded Talon, sort of as a corporate sponsor of the urbit project. And then working there, I wanted to go full time on just payment technology for Urbit, make urbit more commercially capable. And so I created Terrell Corp, which our original, I made the bitcoin wallet in house at Talon for Urbit. And then we at Terrell created credit card payments for urbit. So last year we released a substack for Urbit that's self hosted, but it had credit card payments. And so now whether the writing is on the wall for those centralized fiat payment systems, that's another question.
00:39:22.620 - 00:39:41.192, Speaker C: But we have created the next one of very few full lightning implementations on urbit. So you have LNd, C, Lightning, Async, and now we have Volt, which is the hoon implementation of the lightning network.
00:39:41.248 - 00:39:41.600, Speaker A: Cool.
00:39:41.672 - 00:39:58.136, Speaker C: So urbit has a very much, we're a little chauvinistic in that we demand, we try to create all of our, we try to refound all of the code that we use on scratch. Basically it is from scratch computing. Yes.
00:39:58.200 - 00:40:01.724, Speaker A: So Terrell is primarily doing payments.
00:40:02.464 - 00:40:10.808, Speaker C: Yeah. We are releasing our lightning network spec in I think the next week.
00:40:10.936 - 00:40:23.096, Speaker A: So now I can, instead of doing in c or in rust, I can use a hoon based lightning implementation on my orbit planet through the orbit Internet.
00:40:23.200 - 00:41:05.014, Speaker C: Yes. Yep. And so we replicate a handful of the bolts. So one caveat I should mention is that we are, we still use lnd to bridge to the external lightning network. And that is because urbit networking is far more efficient than l and d or c lightning we don't have, because urbit networking is more sound and atomic, there is less need for things like say sending heartbeat messages or stuff like that. So we don't replicate every single aspect of lightning network networking.
00:41:05.054 - 00:41:12.278, Speaker A: I see to connect to the broader existing lightning network, you have to basically like downgrade to go back through like another implementation.
00:41:12.366 - 00:41:14.374, Speaker C: Right. But you can still bridge it.
00:41:14.454 - 00:41:23.222, Speaker A: Right, but my, it is basically a bridge though. Right. Cause like I'm assuming that if you and I are both on orbit though, and we have a channel with each other, we don't have to go through anything.
00:41:23.278 - 00:41:24.766, Speaker C: Yeah. That doesn't touch.
00:41:24.830 - 00:41:26.230, Speaker A: It's just trying to make the urbit.
00:41:26.262 - 00:41:28.326, Speaker C: Network, lightning network as you call it.
00:41:28.350 - 00:41:28.830, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:41:28.862 - 00:42:08.944, Speaker C: You stay on Mars. So. And my attitude on that is I personally foresee, because adding a lightning node to your orbit is basically one command. It will be preferred by people long term as their default lightning node and by node count, you know, will personal forecast is that urbit will be the majority of lightning nodes by count, not perhaps by volume, in a couple of years.
00:42:09.024 - 00:42:13.864, Speaker A: Interesting. So it's like, would you say, is it just better and easier for an individual?
00:42:13.984 - 00:42:22.148, Speaker C: Do you think it's running on a computer that is meant for, that is a personal server, right.
00:42:22.196 - 00:42:30.036, Speaker A: It's meant for this type of stuff. It's not an app you're running on a general Windows based laptop or something like that.
00:42:30.100 - 00:42:43.584, Speaker C: Right. Which the trouble there is that just operating a personal server in the Unix paradigm is generally something that is a specialist's task.
00:42:44.364 - 00:42:54.234, Speaker A: I mean, even this is, I think, one of the reasons why we've seen those personal nodes, right? Because they're just simpler. They let you do it more simply. There's a trust trade off theoretically there, right? But it's simpler.
00:42:54.354 - 00:43:25.966, Speaker C: And so this doesn't just apply to lightning, I should hasten to point out. So we've been working on lightning because I'm a bitcoin, dare I say maximalist, at least descriptively, if not prescriptively. And there are other projects to create different front ends for different blockchain protocols. Like someone made uniswap and what's it called? Gnosis. Safe.
00:43:26.070 - 00:43:26.486, Speaker A: Yep.
00:43:26.550 - 00:43:27.142, Speaker C: Et cetera.
00:43:27.238 - 00:43:32.114, Speaker A: Safe. Yep. Safe. So things like multisig, things like that. So it is general. Right.
00:43:32.934 - 00:43:57.882, Speaker C: That becomes quite important. Regulatory matters are not my strongest reason for adopting bitcoin, but that's certainly a popular, that will become a popular reason why people will adopt a personal server approach to interfacing with blockchain networks is because you will just run your front end on your own machine.
00:43:58.018 - 00:44:01.506, Speaker A: I see. I see your point about like defi front ends and stuff. Yeah. So it makes a lot of sense.
00:44:01.570 - 00:44:03.162, Speaker C: So front ends in general.
00:44:03.218 - 00:44:17.206, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. For anything, I guess, to your point, I mean, even like, it is bringing the Internet back home to you. And try not to rely on this single pipe through the ISP to the DNS to the big corp. And that's.
00:44:17.230 - 00:44:37.086, Speaker C: Not to say that in the meantime, you can't have second order relationships on orbit. You can still get useful services from other urbits, but the system is laid out in a more conducive manner.
00:44:37.110 - 00:44:43.954, Speaker A: It's not like you're gonna do everything yourself. It is a network. So you can interact with any other planet or whatever.
00:44:44.294 - 00:44:44.654, Speaker C: Yes.
00:44:44.694 - 00:44:47.574, Speaker A: And that planet, could that planet be a Google, right? I mean, it could, sure.
00:44:47.614 - 00:45:03.974, Speaker C: Why not? I mean, if any Megacorp executives are out there listening, I will help you transition your organization to the post hyper urbanized world. Yes.
00:45:04.794 - 00:45:12.874, Speaker A: I love that. A clarion call. Okay, before we wrap, I did want to point out, wait, do you mean.
00:45:12.914 - 00:45:15.602, Speaker C: Wrap up, or do you mean, are you about to wrap?
00:45:15.658 - 00:46:36.540, Speaker A: No, I'm not about to rap. I'll do that on a different take. All right. Before we wrap, I do want to ask you, Christian, where you see maybe the future of bitcoin in particular, not urbit necessarily. I don't mean that it won't be on orbit. Even more broadly, what is your bitcoin worldview long term? Are you in the camp that it replaces fiat currencies? Does it replace a gold like asset? What is your bowl case for bitcoin?
00:46:36.692 - 00:47:17.820, Speaker C: Wow. Well, it's funny, ever since I got into urbit, people ask me that question less and less. So I would say I think we're due for a. A lengthy monetary interregnum, because in the meantime, bitcoin in many ways strengthens the dollar as its fiat counterpoint through stablecoins. So I'm probably not that savvy of a person to answer that question, but that's my view. Before. Before I was at Terrell Corp.
00:47:17.820 - 00:47:35.956, Speaker C: I studied with George Selgin and Larry White, who are the proponents of free banking. So I would love to see a more, I guess, laissez faire banking system result from blockchain technology.
00:47:36.020 - 00:47:41.052, Speaker A: It would be great. We have an extremely centralized banking system. System. And I don't just mean so.
00:47:41.148 - 00:47:45.100, Speaker C: I think internationally it could decentralize.
00:47:45.252 - 00:47:47.020, Speaker A: Yeah. Outside the US, you mean?
00:47:47.212 - 00:48:16.406, Speaker C: Yeah, to some degree, probably via stable coins. But that's just turning things more in a more crypto native direction. So I sort of see things turning crypto native as sort of the. The preprocessing to then them ultimately migrating to a self hosted computational architecture.
00:48:16.510 - 00:48:25.194, Speaker A: Oh, interesting. So you think that perhaps part of the path to urbit adoption is through financial decentralization first.
00:48:26.294 - 00:49:18.426, Speaker C: So caring about how sacrosanct your data is is certainly, dare I say, a form of grooming for urbit. Terrible word. But I think it applies. It conditions the mind of the marginal adopter to think critically about who's running their applications, what their recourse is to adverse events, et cetera. Also to maybe this is leaping ahead, but I don't think crypto is actually the biggest, certainly not the biggest story of 2023. The advent of AI is upon us. Suddenly.
00:49:18.426 - 00:49:36.352, Speaker C: Again, it's big. And having inference on a machine that is entirely your own is going to become, I think, a true luxury. To go back to my point earlier.
00:49:36.448 - 00:49:39.776, Speaker A: Can urbit save us from Skynet? Is that what you're suggesting.
00:49:39.840 - 00:50:23.674, Speaker C: Urbit could certainly run a personal AI and store all your data, whether you're using a centralized model or whether you're training your own model on your own tastes and preferences and all your information. I would say that there's no other place that you could really ideally run such a thing, especially if you want to deputize your computer with computational tasks of any significant financial import. So I would like to be able to verbally tell my computer to make a bitcoin transaction and to trust that it gets executed.
00:50:23.714 - 00:50:31.714, Speaker A: I would love that. Hey, Siri, you know, open a channel with Christian. We do you guys have a name for orbit?
00:50:31.754 - 00:50:33.650, Speaker C: Siri, I won't tell you what we're naming it.
00:50:33.682 - 00:50:51.980, Speaker A: Oh, but you do. You've thought of this. I love that. This has been great. I think there's so much to learn about urbit. It truly is a fascinating rabbit hole if you're interested in the future of the Internet and also, of course, issues of self sovereignty, decentralization, privacy, security. It is an old project.
00:50:51.980 - 00:50:55.236, Speaker A: It's been around now. It said it was founded in 2002.
00:50:55.340 - 00:51:00.092, Speaker C: That's right. I mean, it took a long time to bring it to a minimum viable.
00:51:00.228 - 00:51:02.060, Speaker A: State, but it is there now.
00:51:02.252 - 00:51:58.544, Speaker C: It's definitely there now. The UX on orbit certainly will be able to meet, say, the expectations of crypto people who already are accustomed to jumping through hoops. So certainly the early adopters will have a more spartan attitude. But undoubtedly, the UX required for mass adoption is in the works. And at that point, because it's a completely distributed network, it scales linearly. You just spin up more orbits, one orbit per person, or you can have multiple, but it is ready to scale whenever people are ready to adopt it at the rate of adoption.
00:51:59.164 - 00:52:05.526, Speaker A: Christian Langelis, founder of Tyrell Corporation, my friend from Connecticut, thank you so much for joining us.
00:52:05.580 - 00:52:06.774, Speaker C: Thank you for having me.
00:52:08.314 - 00:52:29.930, Speaker A: That's it for this week's episode of Galaxy Brains. Thanks to our guests Christian Langelis and Bimnet Abibi. As always. Hey, if you're interested in urbit and trying it out, reach out to me on Twitter intangiblecoins or email me researchalaxy.com. Christian has kindly agreed to help anyone get set up with their own urbit planet. That is the home server you can run. Very cool.
