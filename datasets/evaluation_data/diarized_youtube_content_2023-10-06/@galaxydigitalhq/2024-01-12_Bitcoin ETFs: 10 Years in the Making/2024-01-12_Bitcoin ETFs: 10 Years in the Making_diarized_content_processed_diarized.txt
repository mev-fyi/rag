00:00:09.774 - 00:00:23.726, Speaker A: If you're listening to this, on Thursday, January 11, they launch today at 09:30 a.m. For trading. Was it a sell the news event? I didn't. Over my shoulder. I mean, we're recording. What's Wednesday night? It's flat. It's flat.
00:00:23.726 - 00:00:58.504, Speaker A: Yeah. I would just say there's a lot of uncertainty surrounding day one flows with respect to will inflows, outpace outflows of things like grayscale.
