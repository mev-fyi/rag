00:00:00.120 - 00:00:48.440, Speaker A: I think that really the biggest takeaway from Acde 190 is that developers seem finally confident enough to move away from the scoping discussion for Pectra and is now just focusing on the implementation work, which is quite a bit because of all the code changes that are going into Pectra and for next week's AC DC call, I think it'll be important to watch out and really pay attention to kind of the implementation updates that are happening more for the consensus layer side of upgrades, really focusing on again updates for peer das, but also potentially updates on the inclusion of, say, SSE changes, which are changes to data serialization on the consensus layer side that developers are still kind of considering.
