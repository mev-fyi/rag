00:00:00.080 - 00:00:38.508, Speaker A: I guess at the very core level, it has been that our culture and our ethos from the beginning was always, we're making a stable coin. We're building stability. We don't want something that's fast and loose. It has to be. Actually, I guess you could say it's the saying that slow is fast, that we have just been building core resilience and then just rolling it out and just keep scaling and growing. But then, specifically, why is it so stable now in terms of, like, the peg, that's definitely because of real world assets. Right? So we really pioneered that in maker.
00:00:38.508 - 00:00:50.524, Speaker A: We were, I mean, grinding through that challenge for many, many years, not really figuring out how to do it. And then eventually, we had the breakthrough. We were able to scale up treasuries, do things like real estate allocation.
