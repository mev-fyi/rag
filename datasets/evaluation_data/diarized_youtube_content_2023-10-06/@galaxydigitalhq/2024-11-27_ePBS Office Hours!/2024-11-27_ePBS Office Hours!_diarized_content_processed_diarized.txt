00:00:00.320 - 00:00:53.330, Speaker A: Are all these other out of protocol solutions in your review sufficient to delay the implementation of enshrined pbs? I don't think Commit Boost helps in any way with regards to what the benefit the EPBs bring. I think Commit Boost has more of a centralizing factor, because now you need to have the relayer that runs the Commit Boost software, you need to have the builder that runs Commit Boost software, you need to have the builder or the proposal that run the community software. So you need all three parties to opt in. And then as a builder or proposer, it becomes more confusing because which layer should I use? Oh, I have to use this layer now or I have to only opt into this proposal. And that to me, like, to me, it's become more messy, right.
