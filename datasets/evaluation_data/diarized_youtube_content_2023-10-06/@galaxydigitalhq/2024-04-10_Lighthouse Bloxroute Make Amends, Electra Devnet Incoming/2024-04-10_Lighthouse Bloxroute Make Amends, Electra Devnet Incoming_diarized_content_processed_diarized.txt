00:00:01.174 - 00:00:53.804, Speaker A: Pieces of information that came out since our last episode is a postmortem by the Bloxrat team. And the Bloxrat team had explained, you know, we investigated this and the reason why this happened was due to our BDN. Our block distribution network blocks Route's BDN is this private networking layer where people connecting to that layer can submit their blocks faster, can propagate their blocks through the Ethereum network faster than if they use the regular public gossip sub. Gossip sub is the name of Ethereum's public block distribution network, their peer to peer networking layer. And so Bloxroute had said their BDN is what's causing the issue.
