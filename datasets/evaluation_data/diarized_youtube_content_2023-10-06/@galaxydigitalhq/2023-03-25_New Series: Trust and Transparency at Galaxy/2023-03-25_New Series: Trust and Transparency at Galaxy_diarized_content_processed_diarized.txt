00:00:01.440 - 00:00:18.366, Speaker A: Blockchain is progress. Crypto is progress. That may take a little bit longer than everyone thought, but that is going to happen. The risks that we face today are really macro related. What is the Fed going to do? What's the global economy going to do? What is that going to do to crypto?
00:00:18.430 - 00:00:39.848, Speaker B: The slope of the adoption curve was super steep. It's just flattened out. So you're still having the same conversations with the big institutional players, those mutual funds that want to come in, those big hedge fund platforms that are engaging in hiring teams and pods. But the adoption curve is just going to be a little bit slower. They are demanding more from us and we are stepping into that void.
00:00:39.936 - 00:00:48.416, Speaker A: Crypto this past year has been a rollercoaster ride where as soon as you think you've finally caught a break, something else has happened.
00:00:48.480 - 00:01:17.968, Speaker B: It reminds me a lot of a front row seat on Wall street during the great financial crisis. And, you know, while at the time we all felt some existential questions for the industry, it also was invigorating. And, you know, it was incredible to see people come together with solutions with a focus on risk management, with a focus on problem solving. And that teamwork which really came, that is what I feel like we experienced at galaxy and in the industry at large.
00:01:18.056 - 00:01:29.254, Speaker C: We're going to see a real bifurcation between crypto native decentralized systems, protocols, projects and those central operators like Galaxy, that are trusted operators in the space.
00:01:29.374 - 00:02:02.924, Speaker A: Galaxy has cemented itself as the trusted player inside of crypto. If you are a tradfi institution and want to understand how to navigate, we are a place to stop. If you are a crypto native institution and want to understand the right way to do things, we are the place to go. And so at the end of the day, we are at the crossroads of so many parts of this ecosystem, and that is why galaxy is special. That is why we will win, and that is what we're all here doing. That's the dream we're building towards.
