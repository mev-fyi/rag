00:00:00.720 - 00:00:02.193, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:02.289 - 00:00:04.281, Speaker B: An infinite amount of cash. Cash.
00:00:04.433 - 00:00:10.985, Speaker A: I'm your host, Alex Thorne. The US banking system is sound and resilient. Bitcoin made a new all time high.
00:00:11.145 - 00:00:13.697, Speaker B: If you're not long. If you're not long, you're short.
00:00:13.881 - 00:00:19.365, Speaker C: Satoshi's gonna come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet. All bitcoin's gonna be erased.
00:00:19.665 - 00:00:20.393, Speaker B: Bitcoin.
00:00:20.489 - 00:00:54.563, Speaker A: Bitcoin's the best crypto out there. Bitcoin is going to zero. Welcome back to Galaxy Brains. As always, I'm your host Alex Thorne, head of Firmwide Research at Galaxy, and we have a great episode for you this week. Yat Su, co founder and chairman of Animoca Brands, is our guest and it was a fascinating conversation I had with Yat at Animoca HQ in Hong Kong about digital property rights, digital identity, a whole bunch of stuff. Is the Metaverse actually coming back? I don't know, but if it does, I think Animoca will be a big reason why. We'll also check with our good friend Bibnet, a BB from Galaxy Trading, as always, to talk about markets.
00:00:54.563 - 00:01:16.443, Speaker A: And before we get to that, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to the disclaimer in the podcast notes. And note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer recommendation or solicitation by Galaxy or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Let's hop right into the episode. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:01:16.499 - 00:01:17.575, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:01:18.595 - 00:01:53.279, Speaker A: It's always great to have you on. And it's been kind of an exciting week. I mean, significant moves in the crypto markets, frankly, in the equity markets also, you know, just at a high level. Bitcoin down from about 66k to 615 as we talk. Now, before we get specifically to that, let's talk a little bit of the macro. I saw there was a slightly better than expected ADP jobs number, but still some dovish Fed speak. I don't know, what's your take on the sort of jobs inflation Fed stuff at the moment?
00:01:53.407 - 00:02:44.073, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think high level. My framework for monetary policy for the next six months is that the Fed wants to get to neutral. Neutral is around, let's say three to three and a half percent. And so the question is, how quickly do they get to neutral? And in terms of what are the data points that are really going to drive the decision making? Between 25 and 50 over, over the next handful of meetings. And so in terms of the data that we've recently gotten, you know, it's a little bit stronger than one than what would I think justify a 50 BP sort of cut at the next meeting. ADP today came in at 143,000 jobs. The wage figures there were good.
00:02:44.073 - 00:03:38.313, Speaker C: The sector breakdowns were constructive. You had revisions higher for the past month as well. For August you also had pretty strong job openings data in terms of jolts that surprised to the upside and were also revised higher. Initial jobless claims have been stronger or smaller, so stronger than expected. And so in terms of concerns about the labor market data, they haven't really materialized too much as of yet. There is stuff in the anecdotal data in terms of the consumer confidence stuff in terms of quit sleeves and hard to hire things of that nature. And there are Fed members that have spoken about relying more on anecdotal data as well.
00:03:38.313 - 00:04:18.735, Speaker C: So it's a little bit of a mixed bag on the job side. But you know, I'm kind of in the camp of, you know, 25 basis points for the next meeting. And I think that's kind of what Powell was trying to indicate, you know, on Monday. And so, you know, the rate market had a little bit of a reaction to hawkish Powell comments on Monday. And I think that's entirely appropriate, I think for the next meeting. You've got about 33, 34 basis points priced for that meeting. So still kind of like close to that midway point between, you know, 50 and 25.
00:04:18.735 - 00:05:00.525, Speaker C: You know, I think the jobs data on Friday is going to be super important. Non farm payrolls, you know, the unemployment rate, average hourly earnings. That's going to be kind of the last set of clean data you're going to get before, you know, the next set of data is kind of a little bit skewed by the hurricane impacts. So high level, I think the market's most concerned about labor market dynamics, less concerned about inflation stuff because we've moved closer to target and forward expectations of inflation have come down. So you really got to pay attention to non farm payrolls on Friday and that's going to kind of set the tone for the rest of the world. Got it.
00:05:01.065 - 00:05:46.611, Speaker A: Let's talk about the hurricane a little bit, actually. Terrible devastation and parts of Georgia, South Carolina, the North Carolina mountains, Tennessee. You know, obviously these things have a big impact on, on, you know, local and regional economies and then that can spill into the broader economy. But one, one item I wanted to just highlight which is the, the Quartz production in Spruce Pine, North Carolina. This is one of the a lot of AI and semi, you know, followers hobby horses. Apparently an enormous percentage of the chip grade quartz is prod area that was severely impacted. You know, we don't know exactly how bad the impact on Quartz Corporation or Sibelco, which are those two companies are.
00:05:46.611 - 00:06:02.547, Speaker A: I don't think they've said much but that whole region devastated, let's say that it is bad. Is there a longer term supply chain ripple effect or just broadly, how will the hurricane affect the macro situation in.
00:06:02.571 - 00:07:03.131, Speaker C: Terms of the broad kind of implications? I think JP Morgan put out some stuff earlier this week that indicated that, you know, there's about a $5 billion per day impact as a function of the hurricane. And so that that's pretty material, right? 10 days, $50 billion worth of economic output that just doesn't happen. And so that's kind of, you know, the ballpark we're in right now. It's not meaningful enough to really drive kind of Fed policy or the broader market. But in terms of, you know, specific to semis, it's, you know, again, highlights how fragile the supply chain is with this stuff. And so, you know, I think that's just going to lead to delays in chip deliveries and that's going to impact folks that are like actively in the race to, you know, get the best output out of, out of AI. Right.
00:07:03.131 - 00:08:17.377, Speaker C: And so, you know, I think it just delays things a little bit and it makes folks kind of, you know, really hone in on their supply chains and try to figure out, you know, where their vulnerabilities are and you know, how they can address them. And high level, you know, it speaks to kind of what's been happening over the past couple of years since COVID since kind of the trade war with China, which is, you know, there's been an active, ongoing effort to reshore supply chains or to bring them, you know, closer instead of, you know, in the Far east to, you know, make them more, you know, North America based. And that's been continuing for the past couple of years and really accelerated after Covid. And you know, I think that brings to light, you know, another topic, you know, we should kind of talk about, which is the election, which is getting closer and closer and as you can clearly see as a function, you know, from, from the debate last night, there is a big focus on from the Trump administration about reshoring jobs and kind of, you know, slapping tariffs on, you know, foreign imports and stuff. And so I do think that it's Going to be a theme that continues to play out over the next couple of months and, you know, potentially after, after the election.
00:08:17.441 - 00:08:59.879, Speaker A: Let's continue that discussion a little bit about onshoring in China, because for the first time since 1977, the longshoremen are striking. The International Longshoremen's Association. So this is the union that represents longshoremen. Those are the people that load and unload cargo on and off of ships at ports, apparently from Texas all the way to Maine. So about half the countries, the entire east coast, sort of eastern part of the east coast, the whole eastern half of the American main mainland continent, are on strike. They asked President Biden, some journalists, whether he would do some kind of intervention. He said he doesn't believe in Taft.
00:08:59.879 - 00:09:18.999, Speaker A: Hartley. That's the federal law that limits the power of unions to strike and grants the federal government some power to stop them and if it comes to national security. So it doesn't seem like there'll be some sort of overarching intervention here that has to be inflationary. Right. I mean, we're talking about potentially a major disruption.
00:09:19.127 - 00:09:50.003, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I think you're spot on. But what I'd like to highlight specifically is that even if the labor market starts to soften, there are patches of the labor market that are uniquely positioned to the extent that they still have tremendous pricing power. Right. I'll give you an example. Boeing, last week they announced 30% increases for their union workers. Right. That's a big, big increase.
00:09:50.003 - 00:10:36.875, Speaker C: And realistically, why did Boeing do it? Because they had no better alternatives. And so to the extent that union labor can stay organized, and it's sort of in the area that, in an area that's highly specialized in terms of the things that they're actually doing, I think labor can take the upper hand. But you're totally spot on. That will lead to pockets of wage growth. And looking at some of the figures from the ADP report alone, I think they're talking about for the month of September, you had year on year labor growth of 4 and a half, 4.6%. Ish. And so that's above inflation.
00:10:36.875 - 00:11:03.985, Speaker C: And it shows that there's still pockets of the labor market that are really tight. And you're talking about an unemployment rate that's around 4, 3. That's still a very structurally tight labor market. You're talking about a labor market that has 8 million job openings. Right. And so it's, you know, even though, you know, you're starting to see like, you know, information technology jobs, like on the decline, like the labor market still at a reasonable place. Right.
00:11:03.985 - 00:11:32.147, Speaker C: If I told you in 2016 that your unemployment rate was 4.3%, you'd be like, oh, that's great, you're at full employment. And so, you know, I think you're spot on that the labor market's not as bad as people think. And there are pockets that have material pricing pressure and that is only going to exacerbate, you know, kind of the price dynamics that the Fed's concerned, but.
00:11:32.171 - 00:12:06.911, Speaker A: Not just on the wage side. If we think that longshoremen are not going to the ports to unload cargo, if this strike lasts any amount of like material time, like if this isn't resolved in the next week, we're going to see significant disruptions for consumers across the eastern seaboarder of the whole country. Right. No, I mean anything that gets produced overseas basically is going to be sitting at ports. You're going to have, you know, perishables perishing in their containers. It's a, it's a, it could become a dire situation leading right into the election. Let, let's, let's, let's continue on though.
00:12:06.911 - 00:12:41.969, Speaker A: There's a lot actually that's been happening in sort of macro and geopolitics. Just last night the Iranians struck Israel with, with ballistic missiles, I should say it looked like some of them hit Israel at the time that we're speaking has vowed to retaliate. And I don't think at the, you know, we're recording on around noon on, on Wednesday, October 2nd. We haven't seen, I don't think what that retaliation has been. But what's the risk here to either commodity markets or also just general, like, you know, if this spirals and escalates further, you know, what's the risk to markets?
00:12:42.097 - 00:13:38.703, Speaker C: Yeah, it's pretty material anytime you have missiles flying. Yeah, but yeah, I mean, initially folks, you know, start to be very concerned about, you know, energy markets, oil markets, because it's a conflict in the Middle east, largest oil producing region in the world. However, I do think that the biggest oil producers have indicated that they're more open to having some supply in the market, particularly Saudi Arabia. And so even with this conflict, you're talking about WTI crude trading at $72 a barrel, it's barely moved higher. And so even though the market has started to price in some of, some of these tail outcomes, it hasn't led to material repricing of oil higher. But that is kind of the main concern as you know, supply chains disrupting routes where oil is shipped, etc. So that's a big concern.
00:13:38.703 - 00:14:35.525, Speaker C: And then the question is if Iran and Israel are going head to head, what other nations get involved, what are the kind of, you know, other externalities that come from that, who else joins them, etc. And that's really tough to predict. And so high level, you know, I think what the market needs to do is kind of price in a wider distribution of outcomes, particularly in the tail sort of scenarios. And so that's kind of what the market's being forced to do right now. And you know, when you talk about increased uncertainty and war, you know, naturally folks, you know, kind of think about gold, right? And gold has been trading really well. It was up a ton yesterday, you know, basically essentially at all time, highs still. And so that's been a popular trade that's only likely going to continue to do better if you know, these, these tail outcomes become more realistic.
00:14:35.525 - 00:15:41.245, Speaker C: And you know, super interesting. I literally, I was this weekend, I was just reading a Fortune article about, you know, the gold buying that's still happening at Costco. You know, you're talking about 100, $200 million a month. And I think they're running into supply issues at Costco in terms of being sold out of some of the gold in certain stores. And so like it's really a big structural theme that's happening that's being supported by, you know, kind of the macro environment with all of these central banks that are cutting right now, you know, you've got RBNZ cutting 50, you've got, you know, RBA that's going to cut 50, you've got Europe in a recession, you got Canada that's cutting, you've got the US cutting. And so, you know, there's this whole coalescing of macro that is generally supportive of things like gold. But yeah, the other kind of, you know, important implication is if you do go down the path of war and more nations getting involved, which I don't think is likely, but that tends to be inflationary and not deflationary.
00:15:41.245 - 00:16:15.241, Speaker C: And so that's something that the mark central bankers are going to have to weigh. But also it's like, wait, risk sentiment is going to be bad. And so do you really want to be maintaining more hawkish policy than necessary, more restrictive policy than necessary when folks are kind of panicked a little bit. And so that's kind of the weird dynamic that these central bankers are in where you know, they want to cut but boars tends to be inflationary and inflation is really what you're trying to combat. And so, yeah, it's a really tough landscape right now.
00:16:15.273 - 00:16:30.814, Speaker A: All right, last thing, I guess it's apropos with gold being up. Bitcoin has been down this week. We opened the week at like 65, 66k, as I said at the top we're trading around 61, 5. That decline started 62.
00:16:30.902 - 00:16:31.625, Speaker C: 62. Don't.
00:16:31.705 - 00:16:50.995, Speaker A: I had to close Bloomberg so that I could record this. My computer needed the memory back. Great. So we're down around 62. But that decline happened before the Iran strike, before the vice presidential debate. I don't know in your mind what drove that and what's your outlook on bitcoin in the near term?
00:16:51.935 - 00:17:53.235, Speaker C: Yeah, no, so I think what drove it is just that bitcoin's been very range bound basically over the past three, four, five months and you got to the top end of the range and a bunch of sellers came in. And so the folks that added leverage, let's say in the low 60s, et cetera, were taking profit. And that's kind of what you saw in terms of bitcoin open interest reduction. I think OI's come off about 2 billion from the highs. If you look at kind of some of the alts, they've come down a tremendous amount as well. And so I do think that, you know, the market might have just gotten a little ahead of itself in terms of pricing in, you know, the macro backdrop, the, you know, election coming up, etc. In the face of a ton of supply in the alt market, in the face of, you know, geopolitical uncertainty and kind of the macro uncertainty a little bit.
00:17:53.235 - 00:18:21.003, Speaker C: And so, you know, I think it's just folks got a little over their skis, myself included. And you know, you just, you just had a correction back to the kind of bottom end of the range. But it's still a healthy market. You know, the S and P and the NASDAQ are still very close to all time highs. And you know, generally like the macro backdrop is pretty good. And so like I don't see the decline extending too much. It's kind of my opinion.
00:18:21.003 - 00:18:56.435, Speaker C: And then in terms of like what you kind of have to price for the next like six weeks, like you have to price in a presidential election with a candidate that's very pro bitcoin. Right. And so if you're pricing a 50, 50 outcome going into that, Right. What's your bitcoin price during a Trump administration? Like where, where do you, where do you put that expected value? If you're putting it north of all time highs. Right. And you know, a common administration isn't going to be that bad for crypto either. Like I think as you get closer to the election basically that you just are going to start to see that this grind higher.
00:18:56.435 - 00:19:57.825, Speaker C: And what I'd also like to highlight is that you've just had so much selling happen over the past handful of months. You had, you know, the German government, you had the GOX claims, you had, you know, sort of natural, you know, profit takers, et cetera. And so there's been a ton of supply that's been absorbed by the market. And then when you think about it in terms of what are the next potential catalysts on a go forward, it's the election, it's FTX distributions, these are all not supply events. I think just from a simple supply demand dynamic, it does look pretty favorable right now for crypto, for bitcoin at least. But I'm still very concerned with, you know, kind of the alt market, you know, particularly some of the bigger VC coins. You know, I just don't know where the interest to buy some of this stuff is going to come from, you know, particularly given the supply schedule of a lot of tokens.
00:19:57.905 - 00:20:01.641, Speaker A: All right, my friend, Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Trading, as always, thank you so much.
00:20:01.793 - 00:20:02.965, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:20:04.755 - 00:20:11.163, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest Yat from Animoca, co founder and chairman of Animoca Yat. Thank you so much for coming on Galaxy Brands.
00:20:11.219 - 00:20:14.147, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you so much. It's not called Galaxy Brands, is it?
00:20:14.171 - 00:20:15.027, Speaker A: It is Galaxy Brands, yeah.
00:20:15.051 - 00:20:15.643, Speaker B: Oh, wow.
00:20:15.779 - 00:20:16.371, Speaker A: I'll go ahead.
00:20:16.443 - 00:20:17.171, Speaker B: Okay. Wow.
00:20:17.243 - 00:20:19.923, Speaker A: Actually we can just keep going. I mean I think that it is called Galaxy.
00:20:19.979 - 00:20:21.883, Speaker B: Wonderful. Awesome. Well, thank you for having me.
00:20:21.939 - 00:20:25.147, Speaker A: Well, it's like a pun, you know, we're like adopting the pejorative, you know.
00:20:25.171 - 00:20:27.027, Speaker B: Yes, of course. We call Galaxy and Animal and it's.
00:20:27.051 - 00:20:39.289, Speaker A: We'Re head of the, it's a research team's podcast where the brains. Galaxy. Very excited to talk to you. Before we get into it, just briefly, what is Animoca in your mind in general, what is it?
00:20:39.337 - 00:21:29.175, Speaker B: Yeah, so Animoca Brands, our mission is to deliver digital property rights and really we think of a space of, you know, the way we sort of started Animoca as a business, we're actually a video gaming company and the really the history of it was we didn't really get into the crypto space until CryptoKitties, which our studio in Vancouver helped build and that's. We got a front row seat on the launch of Cryptokitties and we saw what happened when it broke Ethereum. We were like, oh, that's interesting. But what really attracted us wasn't the fact that, you know, they were basically digital cats that you could trade and sell. I mean, you know, the Internet was always obsessed with cats earlier and just look at memes today. It was really just the fact that actually you could really own this. And there was this principle of ownership that actually was very liberating because really as a gamer already from the early generations, I always wanted to sort of own the items and sort of maybe not necessarily sell them.
00:21:29.175 - 00:21:48.435, Speaker B: For me they were status goods. And right now my reputation that I basically generated as a gamer from 20 years ago, I don't have that anymore. I lost that completely. And I'm not going to be able to compete with gamers today. But I would get kudos for having been in the space 20, 30 years ago, for instance. That was sort of one of the attraction points. And really it started from the lens of culture.
00:21:48.435 - 00:22:26.231, Speaker B: And the other thing that was became also attractive over time as we started to understand this is that actually the whole space about what we can own is these network effects. We think of tokens as representations of network effects. And so when Animoca says that we want to proliferate digital property rights, we actually think of this as a way in which you can help a new equitable, much more equitable future where everyone is a stakeholder. Because look at sort of the equity structure today. Companies today I think companies like Apple and Facebook have like maybe 80 to 85,000 shareholders and that's not a pretty good number. But they can't have a million shareholders, they can't have 10 million shareholders. That structure doesn't work as a public company.
00:22:26.231 - 00:22:48.075, Speaker B: The administration in our own experience would be impossible. But you can have 10 million token holders. And to me, how do you create a world where everyone has a stake in something valuable or interesting in particular stakes in the networks that they are invested in or building. That basically is Web three. So when you think about how do we build a property rights owning democracy truly. And I think Web3 is the only way.
00:22:48.235 - 00:23:16.567, Speaker A: And I also love your, your the way you think about Web3 as the evolution because right, we started with Arpanet, like a nuclear war hardened decentralized messaging system. You had bulletin boards and early file sharing and like Usenet groups and all these things and. But then we wanted more, we wanted E commerce, right? And there was no like, there wasn't a decentralized way and so then you have this giant rise of, of the same thing with social networking. Right. It's proven to be a killer app for the Internet. Absolutely.
00:23:16.591 - 00:23:18.807, Speaker B: But I think email was probably the first really big killer app.
00:23:18.831 - 00:23:35.953, Speaker A: Well, and that's a good example too because email is totally broken as a decentralized protocol at this point. Right. Like everyone has to use the giant like Gmails and. Yeah, like I run my own web server and I have my own email. Alexthorne.com it is deluge of spam. Like I cannot control the spam.
00:23:35.953 - 00:23:38.317, Speaker A: So everybody's organized around the central providers.
00:23:38.381 - 00:24:08.249, Speaker B: They can manage the spam. In fact, one of the interesting things around one of the businesses that we ended up building in the more later 90s 98 called outplays, which was eventually sold to Lotus Notes to become part of essentially the cloud business. We had one of the biggest anti spam operations in the world. We had something like over 70 million users essentially on our email services. Which we actually was really an outsourced email service provider. And you know, you know, the whole principle SMTP was decentralized and we could send communication with each other. But there was this issue of trust.
00:24:08.249 - 00:24:32.821, Speaker B: And I think to me this is what blockchain, I think solves quite elegantly. And by the way, that's also one of the reasons why I'm not a big proponent of zero gas because I think the problem of zero gas is you have things like spam and abuse because the cost of spamming the network makes it makes whatever fraud you try still worth it. Whereas, you know, civil resistance comes with a cost related to that. And I actually think precisely the element of gas, reasonable gas, shall we say.
00:24:32.853 - 00:24:33.213, Speaker A: Sure.
00:24:33.309 - 00:24:37.253, Speaker B: Creates essentially the friction that's necessary to ensure that you are an honest player.
00:24:37.389 - 00:24:51.541, Speaker A: This is one of the things that Satoshi actually cites in the bitcoin white paper is Adam Back's hash cash, which was a proof of work way to attach a cost to sending email and preventing spam. You have to compute a little proof before you would be able to email me basically.
00:24:51.613 - 00:25:07.885, Speaker B: And so the proof right now with like, you know, basically antivirus and anti spam sort of service providers, which we were one of them in the day, was essentially our cost of compute that essentially we then pay to someone else to get paid for from someone else to provide that security. The end user never knows that they have this cost.
00:25:07.965 - 00:25:28.651, Speaker A: But I think if everybody was running a home email server at their house, it really wouldn't work very well. It's one of these horrible failures that Email is so essential, such a beautiful design and so widely used. But yet if you actually start looking under the, like, most of us are just like, it's just like Gmail and Yahoo, like passing messages back and forth. Right. Like it's only a couple big giants.
00:25:28.683 - 00:25:29.739, Speaker B: And it wasn't meant to be this way.
00:25:29.787 - 00:25:30.375, Speaker A: No.
00:25:30.675 - 00:25:33.131, Speaker B: But I think again, Web3 can help solve this.
00:25:33.203 - 00:25:58.645, Speaker A: So I want to, we're going to, we're going to get into this a lot more. I mean, this goes. I mean, I can't even believe we want to talk about. I'm going to tell the audience we want to talk about the digital identity as part of this, which is the obvious next thing to talk about. But I want to get a thing that we collaborated with out of the way a little bit, which and is obviously related, but Galaxy and Animoca tokenized a rare Stradivarius violin of yours. Why? What was that?
00:25:59.425 - 00:26:00.737, Speaker B: So, I mean, yeah, what was the.
00:26:00.801 - 00:26:01.873, Speaker A: What was the purpose of this project?
00:26:01.929 - 00:26:48.837, Speaker B: There were many purposes, but the first one was really, you know, the Stradivarius in question, the Empress Catarina is a very precious sort of violin. And what some people don't realize is that owning a Strad actually appreciates on average between 12 to 15% a year. So really it's something that as an investment class is actually quite, quite, quite powerful. But also it's owning a piece of history and it has value. And you know, one of the things that I was ultimately originally inspired by was how do we bring musicians because of, you know, my background and particularly my mom's background, sort of into the fold, into understanding the value of things. And one of the things that I find is that we're not really reaching out to these audiences. Because when you think about owning something, I don't mean necessarily as an investment, but when you own something, you need to understand it.
00:26:48.837 - 00:26:51.717, Speaker B: Right. I mean, it's a classic thing of don't invest anything you don't get.
00:26:51.781 - 00:26:52.197, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:52.301 - 00:27:21.755, Speaker B: So then why are we surprised that most of the world is investing? Because they don't get half the stuff that's out there. Do I understand AI? Do I understand investing? Do I understand real estate? I mean, some do, but most don't. Right. So actually tapping into areas of interest that you understand better might be the way in which we can open up basically sort of people into the world of investing. I actually think we have a broad problem in the world, which is that we live in a capitalist society. But the number of people who are capitalists are in single digit percentage the majority of the world are actually in the labor economy. They don't really invest.
00:27:21.755 - 00:27:43.745, Speaker B: The reason why Robinhood and these things can work is because most of the world is financially illiterate. I don't mean to say that they don't have access to a bank account and they couldn't invest in the stock market. They just don't know what they're doing. Right, because, you know, we don't teach them anything about money, you know, all the way until they get to college and when they get to college, get student debt. That's your first experience with money. And then you're surprised when they come out of it saying, that sucks. Right.
00:27:43.745 - 00:28:17.779, Speaker B: And I think this is one of the reasons why America, which is really was the center of capitalism, sort of is in this sort of state where most. I think there was a recent study by Pew that showed that youth under the age of 30 in America was veering more socialist than capitalist. I mean, just think about that. This is not the America I know. And this is also not what made America sort of grow and be entrepreneurial and successful. It was because it embraced capitalist values. But I think this is the problem when you have a concentration of people who are true capitalists and therefore accruing all the values and benefits of a capitalist society.
00:28:17.779 - 00:28:48.897, Speaker B: Anyway, Long way to say that. If I actually tokenize in the future something that accesses an audience, that could be musicians who don't normally have access to this but know it, maybe they would say, oh, wow, I could own an asset that I know is valuable and will appreciate and I have an emotional connection to. Because, you know, as humans, we learn much better when we have an attachment, emotional feeling towards it. You know, it's the same thing when you go to class and you're emotionally attached to this, you learn fast. And if you're like, I don't give a shit about this, then basically you just tune out. And I say struggle and you can't, you can't learn. Right.
00:28:48.897 - 00:29:15.269, Speaker B: It's the same thing. And. And so that's kind of how it started. And I originally wanted to instill in the cards to sort of make a dial out of it. So essentially that musicians can decide who gets to play the violin. And there's different violins that I acquired that I actually want to sort of maybe put into that. But then the other thing, of course, remember when we decided to tokenize and had a conversation? This was in 23, and 23 was a pretty bad market for crypto, and the world was still reeling from the scandals and FTX and so on.
00:29:15.269 - 00:29:54.447, Speaker B: So how do we sort of show the world that there's narratives around sort of web3 that are actually useful and helpful and understanding and so tokenizing something valuable that a lot of people in a certain circle who are mostly not in crypto actually appeals to. It was a huge headline, right? Oh, I could do this with my assets. Or this is something you could, you know, you can prove sort of provenance and get financial value for something that is normally locked. I mean, think about all of the assets in the world that are locked in museums in your basement. You know, things that are. Whether it's artwork could be musical, it doesn't really matter. That are essentially doing nothing that could now actually be opened up and opened up to communities who might be interested in them.
00:29:54.447 - 00:30:07.311, Speaker B: Right. So that's kind of the genesis of that. And, you know, started talking to Galaxy about how we could sort of launch this. And I, you know, I was actually surprised that it even became headline news in Bloomberg as well. Right, right. In terms of. And clearly that's the point, right.
00:30:07.311 - 00:30:26.723, Speaker B: We need more of these type of. And this was actually even before RWAs became sort of the thematic. And again, I think this is where people start saying, okay, everyone talks about real estate as an rwa, but how about expensive violence? It's both sort of quirky, unusual, fascinating, and something you can sort of talk about in a way where it piques people's interest. Right.
00:30:26.859 - 00:30:28.371, Speaker A: It's cultural, historical.
00:30:28.483 - 00:30:30.963, Speaker B: And, you know, as people, we live on stories.
00:30:31.019 - 00:30:50.281, Speaker A: Are we going to make classical music great again with this thing? I mean, I feel like it was inspiring. People are. I don't know how I know what a Stradivarius is, but I've certainly heard of it. A long friend of mine was a great violinist growing up, and I think her mother had one or something. I don't know how, but many had no idea what this was. Probably younger people.
00:30:50.353 - 00:31:29.121, Speaker B: So we're opening the education. People understand its value and they see its potential. And I do agree these type of stories are actually what's going to bring classical music back. One of the big sort of problems classical music had, this environment I grew up in and, you know, lots of the music that we're listening to is actually inspired by classical stuff. But of course, most people don't. Don't know that is really Spotify, I think, is greatly responsible for this because Spotify hasn't set it up in such a way where finding classical music is easy, because the way that classical music is indexed isn't the way that popular music is indexed. And at the same time, the algorithm also wants to promote things that it knows gives it more revenue or gives it basically something that.
00:31:29.121 - 00:32:01.257, Speaker B: If most people like this, then let me push that instead of trying to give you something more diverse or interesting. And so try to find classical music on Spotify. Unless you know what you're looking for, it's extremely difficult to do that. And again, I think this is where these narratives around sort of other stories and other explorations around web 3, what you can do essentially with something like a Strad or other musical instruments sort of brings up the narrative and lets people go, oh, I didn't know you could do that. And what is a Strat? And, you know, and what is this thing that you play on a Strat and how does it sound like? And all that kind of stuff.
00:32:01.321 - 00:32:11.441, Speaker A: I think it was really interesting. I. I play the piano and our audience knows. Well, I. The first 75 episodes of the show, I wrapped the introduction over beats that I made.
00:32:11.513 - 00:32:11.865, Speaker B: Amazing.
00:32:11.905 - 00:32:18.265, Speaker A: I've now run out of. I'll send you. I'll send them to you. I've now run out of beats that I like that I made. So we've. We've changed the format a little bit.
00:32:18.305 - 00:32:19.213, Speaker B: Too violent background music.
00:32:19.289 - 00:32:30.037, Speaker A: But that's one thing I loved about playing the piano was that especially with digital audio production now, I can play almost any instrument. I mean, at least proficiently, you know, because it's. The piano is a composer's tool.
00:32:30.101 - 00:32:30.677, Speaker B: That's right.
00:32:30.781 - 00:32:48.695, Speaker A: I never did learn violin, though. But okay, so. And before we go into the digital id, which is really fascinating, I'm now really hyping it for the audience. What about it more broadly? I mean, do we think. You mentioned real estate? I mean, tokenization. RWAs is sort of this latest incarnation of this. This old story about tokenization.
00:32:48.695 - 00:33:11.359, Speaker A: I remember when I did venture at Fidelity, I looked at 35 tokenization platforms, token issuance platforms, or 40, or in a two or like 1819. And we used to joke there were more of the platforms than there were issuances. Like, and now we've got some momentum. I think stables are now being seen as a tokenized asset. And you've got Treasuries on chain and.
00:33:11.367 - 00:33:12.567, Speaker B: All this stuff coming as well.
00:33:12.591 - 00:33:24.707, Speaker A: We've got Strats now. Yeah. Does this. I mean, are you borrowing. You can use the Strata's collateral, or do we see more types of rare app people borrow off their artwork? Right. In the traditional market?
00:33:24.771 - 00:33:25.091, Speaker B: That's right.
00:33:25.123 - 00:33:25.379, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:33:25.427 - 00:34:15.419, Speaker B: So, I mean, I think the true superpower of web3 in those areas for RWA is it opens up new markets that couldn't exist before. It also has a way to prove provenance of items that you can essentially transact in a global manner that you couldn't before. I mean, you think about, for instance, if you want to sort of sell your artwork or even your violin, you have to work through specific agents who then talk to specific buyers. And maybe you go to an auction, but it's kind of a closed loop network. But if you actually open it up simply by proof of provenance to say, hey, maybe I don't want to say, in my case, people know that I own this violin. But most violin owners of that class of violin actually prefer to stay anonymous for good reason. So what they would do is they might want to show that they have an expensive violin that's worth something, and maybe they want to sell that, but they don't necessarily want to say who they are and reveal their background and all that kind of stuff.
00:34:15.419 - 00:34:53.997, Speaker B: And so I think, again, that's another way in which then you're more willing to open up the market opportunity without actually going out sort of, and exposing yourself, per se. Right. It's a classic thing. And I think most people care about privacy amongst a certain level. Right. They want to preserve access to, you know, their private life in terms of, oh, well, if you own this kind of island, then what else are you doing? Maybe they don't want that, but maybe they do want this opportunity to maybe sell it or to loan it or do that kind of stuff. But I think the other thing that I find is really powerful about blockchain is it opens up ways in which you can create markets for things that have intellectual property value or some kind of property value that couldn't actually be a capital asset before.
00:34:53.997 - 00:35:38.519, Speaker B: And so I'm less excited about real estate, not because it hasn't got good potential and you can trade it more and velocity and all that kind of stuff, but because we already have pretty good frameworks for real estate. So it doesn't. So to me, it's an incremental innovation. But what's an innovative innovation that's something that you can do with blockchain that you couldn't do in any other way. For instance, it's like, for instance, with a project that we're backing called Open Campus, basically, Edu is we're capitalizing content created by teachers, where the teaching content becomes intellectual property that you can then actually sell it as an asset because it's now as an NFT. And these teachers might only make $1,000 a year on this content that they're essentially earning as a kind of rental yield. It's basically someone's subscribing to it, but it belongs to the teacher.
00:35:38.519 - 00:36:48.233, Speaker B: That teacher can't sell it as a capital asset right now because the cost of a lawyer and the conveyancing and everything around it, to actually make it something protectable in the classic sense would cost way more than it's worth. But now as an nft, I can prove the provenance, I can prove creation, ownership and where the money flows for less than a dollar, which means that now a thousand dollar asset, or even $100 sort of, let's call it yield generating asset could actually now be worth essentially 3, 5 or 10x of that based on whatever yield ratio you're happy to give. And so if I'm basically looking at something that gives me 20% yield, I'm willing to pay 500 or $5,000, depending on what it is. I've now opened up a whole new sector of intellectual property management and capital asset that didn't exist before. So the way I like to explain it to people is imagine what the music industry would be like today if we actually didn't have IP rights protection. No Taylor Swift, no Michael Jackson, no Beatles catalog, none of that would exist because essentially you wouldn't be protected and there would be no further development in creation and innovation in the space. But because we had a way in which we could protect intellectual property rights up to certain restrictions, obviously we allowed essentially the creation and the formation of these cultural businesses.
00:36:48.233 - 00:37:20.333, Speaker B: And that's why we have Hollywood and that's why we have authors and writers and all the creative industry, only because we have an IP protection rights. So I see that as an extension of that. And in a way, you know, I also see that as a problem of solving things in AI, because to me, I think of AI essentially as the greatest thief of intellectual property rights because it takes materials from all over the world, but it doesn't give any citations. You know, you go to school and they say, oh, you know, when you use someone else's work to basically create a thesis or an idea, you know, it's your idea, but at least cite the sources. AI does none of that.
00:37:20.429 - 00:37:21.145, Speaker A: That's right.
00:37:21.525 - 00:37:37.127, Speaker B: And the thing, the point about citation isn't necessarily that it has to be something you pay for, but then when you have the provenance, what system exists where you can actually share value on a thousand sources, really only blockchain in web 3. So to me, you know, I think that of that as a longer tail behind the potential and what really excites.
00:37:37.151 - 00:37:54.447, Speaker A: Us is that, well, it's a great transition now because I asked you earlier what the big thing you're excited about is, and you said digital identity, which is sort of the. Is it the human version of digital property rights? How would you. What's the segue between here and there? Because they're related.
00:37:54.551 - 00:38:44.351, Speaker B: Well, going slightly philosophical first to start off with the mission of digital property rights, or property rights, generally speaking, I think starts with the ultimate property, right, which is your identity. Most people who maybe haven't studied history might not even. Or haven't tried to search the provenance of their last name, for instance, probably don't realize that most of the world didn't even have a last name. And they didn't have it because they didn't have an identity because you were someone's property, whether you were a serf working in a feudal, sort of some feudal environment, or whether you were a slave, actually you were someone else's property. And so you didn't have a last name. And then later on, when we had emancipation and we basically had enlightenment and people started to realize. People started making these last names and suddenly their last names were based on either the city they were born or, you know, maybe because they were a butcher.
00:38:44.351 - 00:38:45.191, Speaker B: They're professionally.
00:38:45.223 - 00:38:45.607, Speaker A: The job.
00:38:45.671 - 00:38:46.455, Speaker B: Yeah, the job they were doing.
00:38:46.495 - 00:38:48.655, Speaker A: Such banker, like farmer.
00:38:48.775 - 00:39:21.971, Speaker B: Exactly. So actually the translations actually were the identities were based on what they were doing and that's how they formed the identity. But the point on this is that once you own your identity, you own your property to yourself. And you basically go back to this very sort of, I guess, principled Lockean idea that basically we're all entitled to a form of property rights. And in that sense, actually, we begin the development of our own self because we own our own selves. Right? Like, at the end of the day, I might not own a house, but I own myself. I own my thought, and at least I'm myself, right? I mean, that's kind of how it starts off.
00:39:21.971 - 00:40:17.887, Speaker B: And of course, what is it that you own as a property of yourself that is maybe perhaps even more valuable than the physical things we claim to own? And that's your reputation, Right. When you build reputation, actually, those are the things that we strive to strive for. So we look at, you know, when we look at, for instance, sort of Bourdieu's forms of capital, which is an inspiration for us, you know, most of the world. And this, I think, is the issue where we have in web3 is focused on economic capital. Basically, how do I make money from this space? But actually, as you advance in society and how you build stable societies, you care more about symbolic, social and cultural capital. These are the things that actually can capsule things like reputation, for instance, symbolic capital would be like a university degree, because even though economic capital helped you go through college, what you really own is four years of college in some institution that gives you pride that can't be taken away. That's symbolic capitalism is worth more than someone coming in saying, well, I have more money than you.
00:40:17.887 - 00:41:01.997, Speaker B: Okay, But I went to this college and I studied this. That's something you have, and that's that representation of symbolic capital that, you know, pure economic capital can compete with. And as humans, that's what we strive for at the end. Is it for the love of money, or is it for really the love of other things? We care for respect and we care for, you know, love and friendship. And these come from basically cultural, social, and symbolic capital. And that's where, just to close on the thought, this is basically why we think it's so important to build a reputation layer that encapsulates this, which is what we're doing with Mochaverse, because many problems we have in web 3 is the fact that I don't have a reputation I need to protect. So it's kind of like, imagine doing business with a person and then that person becomes someone else, even though he's the same person.
00:41:01.997 - 00:41:24.981, Speaker B: So I'm basically doing business every time with someone that I know for the first time. Always. Well, that's actually a breakdown of society if you can't have trust. And, you know, the other thing is we want to build powerful networks. I mean, the whole space About Web3 is ownership of these network effects. But if network effects are weak, then the bonds and ties are weak. How do you make the bonds and ties strong in any network? Trust.
00:41:24.981 - 00:41:27.145, Speaker B: How do we trust reputation?
00:41:27.565 - 00:41:46.165, Speaker A: It's such a fascinating way of thinking about it, and there's so many places to go. The way I. The way I have thought about, there have been. People have worked on this, There have been projects. There was what? Sovereign and Benny Lingam had a project. I can't remember what it was called. There was a company called Provenance that was doing Swiss voting or something.
00:41:46.165 - 00:41:52.401, Speaker A: I've always liked the idea, though, that of the ability to have multiple identities. Like, is that how you think about it?
00:41:52.433 - 00:41:52.809, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:41:52.857 - 00:41:54.177, Speaker A: Which just based on reputation.
00:41:54.281 - 00:41:54.673, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:41:54.729 - 00:42:01.943, Speaker A: So on the Ground. What would it feel like if I'm in the Mochaverse or I'm at the DMV getting a new driver with people having multiple identities?
00:42:01.999 - 00:42:29.647, Speaker B: Because they always do that anyway. I mean, you're different at work than you're with your friends and, you know, maybe even in a different country. Right. But there is an element that we think is important in where your reputation is portable. So even though in your friend network you are not interacting the same way as you do with your work, the fact that you're working for Galaxy or for some institution is known to the network. That's a transfer of reputation that took place place. So they don't know everything else about it.
00:42:29.647 - 00:42:37.031, Speaker B: But you already have kudos for the things you do or don't do. Right. So these are elements of the reputation that translates and affects your life.
00:42:37.103 - 00:42:40.879, Speaker A: I see. So you could keep them totally separate. You could move elements of them between them.
00:42:40.927 - 00:43:30.633, Speaker B: And I think blockchain is perfect for that. Because now, with zero knowledge, I can attest to certain areas of my reputation without actually having to say what it is. So if you want to say, for instance, I'm a senior manager at some company and I'm doing really well, but I won't tell you where I'm working because I think that would be a little bit rude, or maybe you might feel insecure or maybe makes people feel uncomfortable, but at least I know you're someone. Now think about social networks as well, right? If you have, you know, millions of followers on Instagram, for instance, and if you can actually attest to whoever you're talking to that you actually have millions of followers on Instagram, but you don't want to reveal your Instagram profile because you want to be anonymous a little bit. You don't want people stalking what you're doing, or maybe you don't want to talk about the things that, you know, you would normally talk about on that channel, because in, you know, with that circle of friends, you want to stay away. It's not that different, for instance, where some people choose to not talk about aspects of their private life because that circle, it would feel too alien, too remote.
00:43:30.689 - 00:43:39.265, Speaker A: It's like for some reason in the conversation or the interaction, I want you to know something about me, but I don't necessarily want to tell you all about it. I just want to establish it as a person.
00:43:39.345 - 00:44:31.473, Speaker B: That's the right to privacy we have for everything. Except that right now, because of social media, it feels like you have to reveal everything about yourself and you have no privacy which actually doesn't work anyway. With zero knowledge proof, you can actually transfer the benefits of that social reputation and that cultural reputation without actually having to reveal everything around that. But actually, I think the more powerful thing, of course is that when you have a reputation that you've built up, then you will protect it. And this to me is how we make the space better. Because when you have a reputation worth protecting, the temptations of doing something, and I think many problems we have in all industries, by the way, this is not just in web3, just all over the world. When the consequences aren't there, meaning there's no reputation being lost for whatever, let's say nefarious activity you might be considering even that moment in time, then actually what happens is that you weaken the network and you weaken the trust.
00:44:31.473 - 00:44:57.457, Speaker B: And so the only way to normally deal with this in society is more control. Right, Okay, I don't trust you. More police or more laws or more things to restrict you. But actually we can self police that in an environment where we trust each other. For instance, when we were hunter gatherers, we were a society of only about 100, 150 people, right? Dunbar's number, roughly that number. As a result, I knew everyone. And so if someone did something, at least five other people knew what you were doing.
00:44:57.457 - 00:45:12.027, Speaker B: In the same way that, you know, if I was going to steal your cow, someone's like, wait, hold a second, I knew that was your cow. We didn't need a ledger or some, you know, tyrant to say, actually I decide who has a cow because, you know, I knew this. Or you signed it up in some kind of written form.
00:45:12.091 - 00:45:25.003, Speaker A: There was even, you know, the rhinestones on the Isle of Yap, right? And it was. Sometimes they would actually be lost at sea, but then the community would be like, well, we knew he had a big giant rhinestone. Anyway, so the reputation would carry forth anyway.
00:45:25.059 - 00:45:37.591, Speaker B: Exactly. Now the problem is we couldn't scale that beyond 150 because the whole network of proof was. But actually I don't know who you are because, right. It's like, it's like, you know, you live in New York, right? And it's like, I own this house. You do? How supposed to know that?
00:45:37.623 - 00:45:44.407, Speaker A: I mean, let's say I come knocking on the door here at Animoca and I'm like, oh, hey, I'm this important blockchain researcher. And you're like, I mean, where did this guy come from Exactly?
00:45:44.431 - 00:45:44.855, Speaker B: I have no idea.
00:45:44.895 - 00:45:47.007, Speaker A: But I came in with the Galaxy team to send.
00:45:47.151 - 00:45:47.623, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:45:47.679 - 00:45:48.591, Speaker A: I was credentialized by.
00:45:48.623 - 00:46:07.039, Speaker B: That's right. But were you working in that kind of stuff? And that actually is something you can now move along basically on chain and, you know, you can scale the trust mechanisms that worked for Forth Humanity when we were Hunter Gatherers without essentially a central control element, but at scale to literally, basically billions of people.
00:46:07.127 - 00:46:15.135, Speaker A: Yeah. And so with the Mochaverse, which is Animoca's metaverse, and by the way, and also your. I mean, you said hundreds of investments that you guys have made.
00:46:15.175 - 00:46:15.911, Speaker B: 540 right now.
00:46:15.943 - 00:46:50.535, Speaker A: That's really amazing. How do we sort of get from point A to point B? Like, I can, I think, and I think you've done a really good job explaining how the world could be improved by having an identity like this. But right now it's like I go to a website and it's like, sign in with Google, sign in with Facebook, sign in with Apple, which is out of the cool private email relay thing. Sign in with my own email, sign in with my phone. It's like, now we have these identities, but. And they're all separate. And how do we go from that very fragmented world to this? In some ways private, but also more secure.
00:46:50.535 - 00:46:51.033, Speaker A: Trans.
00:46:51.159 - 00:47:18.895, Speaker B: So, first of all, the main reason why people use these is for convenience. And so what you're really sort of paying for, as it were, is essentially convenience. You're not getting value for it. So I think first, the reason why people are going to switch over, and again, I think only web3 can do this properly. The reason you would switch over to a digital identity solution, the way that we're building in Mochaverse is because this is where value can accrue back to you. Because essentially your reputation becomes your currency. In the world of web3.
00:47:18.895 - 00:47:35.743, Speaker B: This comes in the form, at least initially, for users in the form of airdrops. For the uninitiated, airdrops seems just like free money. What is all of that? It seems strange, right? But what airdrops really is, is a mechanism to gain attention. What is attention? It's marketing. And how much money do we spend in marketing? There are trillions of dollars.
00:47:35.799 - 00:47:36.263, Speaker A: A lot.
00:47:36.359 - 00:48:34.323, Speaker B: We spend a lot of money in marketing. And where does that money go? It goes to central actors who basically decide you have this billboard or this advertising, and maybe to some degree you feel like you have some control because you think, hey, this advertising on this billboard in F1 or whatever might be very valuable, but actually the hit rate is who the hell knows, right? I mean, it's basically sort of okay, yeah, I think we'll get X number of clicks and we have X number of users that use a product. It's really difficult to do that and it's also super expensive. But what if I could tell you, you know what, every person who owns a Piaget or Rolex watch, which is the audience maybe for your product that you want, I can target them directly and I could do that not by paying a platform but by giving incentives directly to the user. This is actually where the powerful element comes on, reputation, because that's actually what you're doing. Because I own an expensive asset, someone else wants to leverage that aspect and do business with you and he's willing to pay you more money or benefits directly. And they do this indirectly.
00:48:34.323 - 00:49:27.683, Speaker B: Oh, I've got a show, you want to come here, I've got a festival, I've got this famous musician. And because I know that you have this background or you're this kind of sort of private wealth client, you can go over there, but we can't do that at scale. But now with a digital identity you could have this reputation. So the airdrop is the marketing that gains attention directly to you for having a built, having built a better reputation, more people will come to you to give you more. In Web three, just quickly, I think this is a problem we have with people who are airdrop farming and basically botting their way around, right? I mean, people say kyc aml it doesn't solve it because you know, we had the same problem. We KYC'ed wallets and then actually they were sold to someone else because the wallet is essentially something you can just create sort of on the fly, right? And you have these trust issues. But if I have a reputation that accrues over time, actually what happens is that I'm much happier to give someone a bigger airdrop or more value because you've done this a good job for a year or two.
00:49:27.683 - 00:49:59.339, Speaker B: Don't you want to know what people do with your token? You don't have to, by the way, you don't have to reveal whether you were or not a dumper. But through zero knowledge proof, you can now prove that you know without revealing essentially your identity that hey, you've been a good actor and you've been actually doing good things and therefore you can give me more rewards. And that's actually what we want. We want the better customers in every ecosystem. Doesn't have to be just as Web3 in every area. And again, I think this is why people will switch to a digital identity solution like Mochaverse because value accrues to you as opposed to someone else.
00:49:59.467 - 00:50:19.779, Speaker A: It's so interesting too because when you say you want to target, say anyone that owns a Rolex watch or was a good actor in your ecosystem or on your layer one blockchain, even you don't need to know who they are. You're relying only on the accrued value or lack of value of their reputation. And someone could have multiple reputations.
00:50:19.907 - 00:50:20.219, Speaker B: Yes.
00:50:20.267 - 00:50:53.737, Speaker A: You don't know that. You may not know that these ones are connected at all. You just say, wow, this address right here, they are a good user of my blockchain, they've been around for two years or they're a good customer of F1, they're a long term fan. It's simultaneously a very data rich environment, but also can be quite private. And to me, this is the hardest part about digital id. Sounds scary to some people, right? You think of the social credit scores and these types of things, but it's like you really control your own destiny with it, right? As an individual.
00:50:53.801 - 00:50:58.697, Speaker B: Yeah. I think the reason why social credit score is scary is because a central actor would control.
00:50:58.761 - 00:51:00.673, Speaker A: That's right. It's just the one government is doing.
00:51:00.729 - 00:51:38.277, Speaker B: And if you have a social credit score where a central actor determines your fate thereafter, I think that's a problem. Right? Because then people go, wait, why do you get to decide? You know, we had our own story of this. You know, we were one of the biggest mobile game developers in 2011 and 2012 on the Apple App Store and then one morning all of our apps were removed in 2012 and nobody told us why. At Apple we just basically lost basically access to all of our apps. And that's because some central actors, central players said we don't like you for whatever reason without due process. Right. And I think this is what's scary.
00:51:38.277 - 00:51:47.169, Speaker B: However, it's decentralized and it's actually owned by you. It's you who decides who gets access to it. That's different. And I think this is again what digital identity solutions and web3 can solve.
00:51:47.217 - 00:52:36.327, Speaker A: Yeah, it's very powerful because again, it is the only way that I can sort of see a pathway forward. You know, an individual with a wallet or a digital keychain with many possible id. This is the one that I use when I go to the government and pay my taxes and sure, there's some other stuff on there, right? Maybe you got a speeding ticket, it's not perfect, but this is the one I use on the Internet. Or this is my, this is the one that has my Twitter and my, my, you know, my Bitcoin address and my Coinbase account and my Animoca. Yeah, it's all one. And now, you know, you sort of pick and choose what you reveal and yes, even a step further if you can, zero knowledge each of the attributes themselves too. It just seems like a very positive, progressive, even like pro privacy way forward actually for something that hasn't been done but everyone seems to want.
00:52:36.431 - 00:53:09.569, Speaker B: Well, I think the reason why, I think at Animoca we have an ability to execute this is because we happen to have over 540 portfolio companies of which, you know, most of them are going to adopt MOCA id, which means that they become ways in which you can attribute essentially these sort of reputation scores into them. One of the challenges that most identity solutions have is that they're building their own network and then it's natural for them to want to accrue value on the network. I get that. But then of course another network goes, well, why do I want to attribute value to your network? Because I want to attribute value to my network.
00:53:09.617 - 00:53:09.969, Speaker A: Right.
00:53:10.057 - 00:53:40.035, Speaker B: And It's a classic Web2 problem that we have, which is why you know, Facebook and Google and all those sign ins, all these signups are like, wait a second, this is my data and I'm not going to give it to you. Right? But this changes when the data belongs to the end user. But of course you need a little bit of an incentive to kick it off. And the incentive in our case is our portfolios and our investments on our group companies. We can essentially use them essentially as a bootstrap to those network effects that most other digital entities have. Great technology, that's not actually what needs solving in many ways. It's actually why do I use it.
00:53:40.035 - 00:54:32.867, Speaker B: And in this case gaming, which is what we do of course is I think a natural flywheel to this. And of course just think about what happens when you build stronger on chain sort of reputation through your gaming activities or how you manage your tokens to whatever. Actually this opens up a whole new market of essentially unsecured credit, right? I mean think about how this sort of, this works in real life. How much money do you have in bank account or you know what, how much money do you make in your job? These are ways in which people start and you know, have you been paying your debts on time? These are all things that allow you to get unsecured credit in certain areas. Which by the way doesn't just extend, extend into things like you know, getting cash, but maybe buying something on credit or you know, I want to loan you this object for a month, right? If you have a good credit score, basically maybe you don't have to pay that much or maybe insurance. Like all these markets start to open up when you basically have a reputation system that you can rely on.
00:54:32.891 - 00:54:34.931, Speaker A: And these are not markets that we have in defi.
00:54:35.003 - 00:54:37.875, Speaker B: They don't exist. Possible they don't exist. It opens up whole new markets.
00:54:37.915 - 00:55:03.947, Speaker A: It's also just playing this point too. You were talking about you could be unsophisticated in investing and not necessarily underbanked but one of the, or unbanked. One of the hardest problems in defi and making it something that's inclusive that can actually help the unbanked is this thing. There's, there is no defi. Everything is over collateralized. You have to already have money to use defi. There's no but you could have no money but have reputation and perhaps secure credit on chain.
00:55:04.051 - 00:55:05.451, Speaker B: I actually think good reputation.
00:55:05.483 - 00:55:06.877, Speaker A: But you don't have you. We don't have collateral.
00:55:06.941 - 00:55:57.547, Speaker B: I mean if you were to quantify, I mean not that we've done this, but if you were to quantify the value of reputation in our economies, I would say it's actually potentially as large, if not larger than our fixed assets. Because think about just when you start a job that's basically just banking on your reputation as a freshman, it's what school do you go to as a next job? Where did you work and what did you do? Right? And that's not based on anything. I mean just think about, and just think about the hit rates that people have when they hire people. It's not exactly 100% right. So I'm taking a bet on what your reputation, right. And how much value in this employment sector is entirely based on your potential, only based on really no, no, no actual hard backed assets. So like you join a job and say okay, I'll give this job to you but you got to put a million dollars of collateral first before me before I can hire you.
00:55:57.547 - 00:56:06.919, Speaker B: Right? I mean that's the point why the world is where it is today because we have this incredible asset that you can't make portable until web3.
00:56:07.007 - 00:56:17.623, Speaker A: It's a very, very compelling case. We have to leave it there. Yat see Chairman and co Founder of Animoca thank you so much for coming to Galaxy Brains. Really fascinating conversation.
