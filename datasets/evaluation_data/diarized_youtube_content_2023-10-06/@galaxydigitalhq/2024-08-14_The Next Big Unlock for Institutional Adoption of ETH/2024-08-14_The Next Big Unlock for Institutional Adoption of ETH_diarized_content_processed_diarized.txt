00:00:00.200 - 00:00:28.072, Speaker A: Maybe I'll add, I'm an old naval officer and I almost think of it like containerized shipping, right? For years, people would bespokely. I'm sorry, would bespokely pack ships. And then all of a sudden they're like, wait a second. If we standardize the box, we can ship a heck of a lot more. And you can't unlock a lot of institutional products like derivatives if you don't have social consensus around a standardized observation. And so, like, yeah, anyone can do it. I think the methodology that we put, like, there's no secrets here, right? No, we publish it all.
00:00:28.072 - 00:00:54.200, Speaker A: We're all very public in the methodology. We've received feedback on the methodology, but I think the methodology that we've tried to adhere to is one of a baseline rate. Right? When you start throwing in additional MEV factors or whatever, there's maybe some discretion. Again, we're trying to solve for something that's very simple, very basic, and that can unlock product development and next generation things like derivatives or benchmark total return products.
