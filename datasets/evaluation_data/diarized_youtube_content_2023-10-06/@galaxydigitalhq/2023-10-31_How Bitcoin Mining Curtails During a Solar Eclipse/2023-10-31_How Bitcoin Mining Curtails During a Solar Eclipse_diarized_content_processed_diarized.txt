00:00:08.730 - 00:00:26.358, Speaker A: I'm about 15 minutes away from our bitcoin mine, helios, and look at all the wind generation, tons of electricity provided to the Texas electrical grid. I think the extent to which we see curtailment today when the solar eclipse happens and solar comes off, a lot of it depends on how windy it is. And there's still a lot of wind.
00:00:26.524 - 00:00:34.482, Speaker B: It's about mid morning, about midday here. And this is not a huge time, midday on a weekend for electricity demand.
00:00:34.546 - 00:00:50.060, Speaker A: Right. Typically morning and evening when people wake up and then when they come back from work. So we may not see any curtailment, especially if it stays windy. But it's going to be exciting, anyway to see the total eclipse happen right over our site, Helios, which, of course, means sun.
00:00:54.270 - 00:01:12.450, Speaker B: You can see the south station over there, a little bit of it. And it's interesting. Someone, they're building a new solar farm right about over here. And then down across the street from us, they're building a big battery farm. So a lot of power market stuff happening right in this little spot of west Texas.
00:01:15.750 - 00:01:31.640, Speaker C: So we're headed to the back of the property to go look at the project substation in the back of the building. We're probably about 20% into this eclipse, going to check it out from the backside of the site. All right.
00:01:32.330 - 00:01:41.870, Speaker B: The sun is still on, but supposed to turn off completely in a couple of minutes. We're here at the substation at Helios.
00:01:54.530 - 00:01:57.042, Speaker C: You can see here is total site.
00:01:57.096 - 00:02:11.350, Speaker D: Load at the telemetry of the substation. And as power prices start to go up with the sun shutting off from the solar eclipse, we respond to the real time wholesale price and we curtail the facility down to roughly the mechanical load, which is four to 5 MW.
00:02:19.530 - 00:02:21.530, Speaker A: All right, that was the eclipse.
00:02:21.870 - 00:02:59.220, Speaker B: We were a little bit far north here at our site to actually see the total eclipse, but I think we had about 80 85% coverage of the sun by the moon. But that 15% was still enough to keep it visibly light outside during the event. But you did see electricity prices spike in Ercot load zone west, and our facility automatically curtailed during that period. And it was quite interesting to watch. So, hey, there's another eclipse apparently in April, right before the bitcoin having. So we'll see if it looks the him, then close.
