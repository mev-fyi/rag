00:00:11.880 - 00:01:09.362, Speaker A: Last rap of the year. Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast for Galaxy Research. We always outlast but we're running to be first we thirst for the future burst through the fray and I'm cursing the haters every verse that I say? Yo, this is for the party. Going down at my house, flipping out, sending bitcoin to the sky? Now we're feeling good here and we've had a good run? But we've just begun and our job is never done? Now we're living Yolo? Hanging out with Novo? Always rolling deep? You will never see me solo signal in the sky? Putting out a bolo, bouncing around the room like a yo yo, yo yo? Flow so hard like a river when I'm raging? Someone call the doctor cause I'm sicker than a patient? Just one thing I gotta say before we jet the best is yet to come. Don't you ever forget on galaxy brains. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firm wide research at Galaxy. Thank you for listening to galaxy brains.
00:01:09.362 - 00:01:24.490, Speaker A: This is our last show of the year, and we have a great one for you. Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of Galaxy, is our guest. We're going to go deep with it into a whole bunch of stuff with Mike. It's a really fun interview I hope you'll enjoy. Bimnet is off this week, and before.
00:01:24.522 - 00:01:25.098, Speaker B: We get to all of that, I.
00:01:25.106 - 00:01:29.554, Speaker A: Need to remind you to please refer to the link to the sclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes.
00:01:29.594 - 00:01:31.002, Speaker B: Investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or.
00:01:31.018 - 00:01:44.722, Speaker A: Solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Man, this is the last episode of 2023. It has been a wild year. Thank you so much to our listeners for coming on this journey with us.
00:01:44.858 - 00:02:00.322, Speaker B: And don't worry, we'll be back next year for another huge year. Let's get right into it with Mike Novogratz. Let's go now to our guest, Mike Novogratz, CEO and founder of Galaxy Digital. Mike, thanks for coming back to Galaxy Brains.
00:02:00.378 - 00:02:01.098, Speaker C: I'm all excited.
00:02:01.186 - 00:02:09.854, Speaker B: It's been a big year. We started at 16 five on bitcoin. I think we're over 44,000 at the time we're recording this. I mean, how's that feel?
00:02:12.914 - 00:02:15.414, Speaker C: It feels a lot better than it did a year ago.
00:02:17.194 - 00:02:21.050, Speaker D: I got a text from a mentor.
00:02:21.122 - 00:02:36.134, Speaker C: And kind of a legend in the investing space, and he said, novo, you do a real good job on tv, but I like to see you more when bitcoin's on the lows than doing victory laps on the highs. He was referencing my interview at CNBC yesterday.
00:02:36.554 - 00:02:40.498, Speaker B: Yeah, you were very positive. Rightly so, though. And people thought we were dead.
00:02:40.586 - 00:02:43.922, Speaker D: You know, people thought crypto had a.
00:02:43.938 - 00:02:54.450, Speaker C: Shot of an existential death last year for maybe good reason. Right? There was Sam Bankman freed and all the fraud. And if you think at the core.
00:02:54.482 - 00:02:59.202, Speaker D: Of what the decentralized crypto bitcoin revolution.
00:02:59.258 - 00:03:05.534, Speaker C: All was about was taking trust away from institutions and sharing it in communities.
00:03:07.924 - 00:03:11.412, Speaker D: Like the blockchain, which is supposed to be a trust machine, all of a.
00:03:11.428 - 00:04:16.294, Speaker C: Sudden looked to the outsider like, we can't trust this at all. It's a fraud machine. And it took explaining and patience and a really, really, really, and shout out to the crypto community, resilient community, to say, no, no, no, no. Those were examples of centralized businesses operating in the cryptosphere that were either horrifically managed, fraudulently managed, stupidly managed, not managed, but it brought a lot of shame and bad will to our industry. And the broom comes out, and that broom is the DOJ and CFDC and SEC and the market, and has pushed most of those players either off the field or into jail. And what's emerged is a healthier industry still not where we need it to be, but much healthier. Prices are reflecting that.
00:04:16.294 - 00:04:31.378, Speaker C: The spirit of employees at our firm and other firms is reflecting that. The amount of accounts that are interested, institutional accounts, retail accounts, is reflecting that. I don't want to say we're back, baby, but we've come a long way, baby.
00:04:31.466 - 00:04:31.834, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:04:31.914 - 00:04:41.786, Speaker B: It's been really a ride this year. While we talk about this, what were some of the, the big moments in your mind in the sort of crypto market this year? So, like, just this year, I would.
00:04:41.810 - 00:04:43.974, Speaker C: Say Larry Fink being orange pilled.
00:04:44.754 - 00:04:45.066, Speaker D: Right.
00:04:45.090 - 00:05:09.770, Speaker C: You see old videos of him from five, six years ago where he was a bitcoin skeptic, and he's now saying it's going to be part of everyone's portfolio. And Blackrock's the largest asset manager, Invesco Galaxy. We're going to try to knock them off the ETF pedestal or at least be a good battler competitor in that space. And I think that's important because you're going to have 910 maybe firms trying.
00:05:09.842 - 00:05:12.754, Speaker D: To build ETF products.
00:05:12.874 - 00:06:00.454, Speaker C: That's 910 sales forces going out and telling the bitcoin story. And after that, they'll tell the Ethereum story and probably the Solana story. And so we're going to bring institutional capital into a space which has been dominated by retail. So that's exciting. I would say that was one. I would say CZ settling was a big, big deal, right? There was all this fud around binance and are they another FDX and is he a crook? And are they stealing your money, do they have the money? And while he admitted to crimes, and he will both pay a giant fee and maybe serve some time for his sake, I hope not. What they got him on was Kycaml violations.
00:06:00.454 - 00:06:03.198, Speaker C: And I would say, listen, I don't know all the details and so I.
00:06:03.206 - 00:06:06.982, Speaker D: Don'T want to look on that case in particularly.
00:06:07.158 - 00:06:40.484, Speaker C: But I would say when Crypto started in the first surge in the 2016 1718, there was a real belief amongst the participants that everyone had a right to access these ecosystems. That was one of the ethos. And so guys like Arthur Hayes who also paid a penalty and went through the DOJ process, but most of the firms didn't have KYC.
00:06:41.304 - 00:06:44.416, Speaker D: And then they realized, oh, I've created.
00:06:44.480 - 00:07:29.564, Speaker C: Money printing machines, I don't want to lose my capacity to make a living. I don't want to lose my capacity to be part of this community. And so they quickly hired lawyers, hired regulators, hired people to try to build in protections to their firms. Some did it better than others. But a lot of what people have been criticized and prosecuted for happened five, six, seven years ago when the industry was a lot more nascent. And today I'm sure some still goes on. But more and more of the players have really robust systems because they don't want to go to jail.
00:07:29.644 - 00:07:46.860, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I didn't see any allegations in any of the binance documents that anything like that has happened recently. I think it's mostly from like 1819 are the allegations. And so I would say it's probably pretty likely the vast majority of liquidity today is KYC at this point. Certainly in the US. We know that.
00:07:46.932 - 00:08:05.946, Speaker C: Certainly in the US piece is, and this is a good lesson in business building is some of these businesses got built so quickly and you're hiring so many people that it takes a long time to inculcate a culture of don't do stupid. And so I was actually talking to.
00:08:05.970 - 00:08:09.534, Speaker D: CZ, I don't know, four weeks before.
00:08:09.914 - 00:08:44.501, Speaker C: He pled in Dubai and we were laughing. I mean, he had, I don't know at that .8 thousand had gone down to 6000 employees and we're 450. And I was like, we got 450 people. There's a knucklehead out there that's going to send some stupid tweet to his friend, and you just got to keep hammering on your company culture. A, that you're your brother's keepers, to look to the guy to your left and right and just remind him that you're working for a company and there's an ethos of the company and don't do stupid. And, you know, a lot of the stuff that came out in there, the findings.
00:08:44.501 - 00:08:46.989, Speaker C: Right. You know, was just really stupid. Tweets.
00:08:47.061 - 00:08:47.357, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:47.405 - 00:09:05.073, Speaker C: Or not tweets, but chats. Chats. And so, you know, we live in a world where everything gets recorded somehow, and so you really got to inculcate that. A culture of take a beat before you tweet, take a beat before you send a chat, before you send an email.
00:09:06.053 - 00:09:17.994, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. And, and one other event. What about the banking sort of crisis in March? How did that feel, looking at it, bitcoin had a pretty strong rally as those banks were having issues.
00:09:18.734 - 00:09:47.592, Speaker C: The banking crises, I think, is an underrated reason why the equity markets on the highs, why everything recovered so fast. Because the Fed does what they do. They flooded the market with liquidity. They were like, we will. And they wrote the put, we will not let anyone go bust. And I think that was a psychological win for the crypto community. A, there was liquidity, but b, it.
00:09:47.608 - 00:09:53.284, Speaker D: Was like you started in this business.
00:09:53.664 - 00:09:57.524, Speaker C: Because you were skeptical of centralized institutions.
00:09:57.864 - 00:10:00.376, Speaker D: And we now, just, with all the.
00:10:00.400 - 00:10:28.716, Speaker C: Arrogance of the Fed and our regulators, we had a regulated bank go boom overnight. We have a system that these banks are really highly levered, non mark to market hedge funds that have a quasi guarantee, a maybe or maybe not guarantee from the government. So would I rather have my money in a Silicon Valley bank? Would I like it in a stable.
00:10:28.780 - 00:10:33.440, Speaker D: Coin backed by treasury bills, especially if they paid interest?
00:10:33.632 - 00:10:41.204, Speaker C: And so, like the great product, which the Fed won't allow at this point, because all of a sudden it would.
00:10:43.264 - 00:10:45.456, Speaker D: Really cut the banks at the knees.
00:10:45.520 - 00:11:05.612, Speaker C: Would be an interest bearing stablecoin. I know a lot of people are trying to work on it. What you forget is there's about, God, I think this number's right, $2 trillion of cash out there. That's $2 trillion that the Fed doesn't pay interest on. It's almost like they've got a $2 trillion version of circle.
00:11:05.708 - 00:11:09.396, Speaker B: It's crazy. Or tether just circulating with no eyes on it.
00:11:09.420 - 00:11:14.464, Speaker C: And no, I got $1,000 cash sitting on my desk. I'm not getting my 5% on that.
00:11:15.684 - 00:11:16.812, Speaker B: You could be. Yeah, right.
00:11:16.868 - 00:11:23.060, Speaker C: You might have your money in JP Morgan, Orchard or Bank of America.
00:11:23.092 - 00:11:24.188, Speaker B: Hopefully not Jpmorgan.
00:11:24.276 - 00:11:51.054, Speaker C: Yeah, hopefully not JP Morgan, but JP Morgan or Bank of America or any bank in America. And checking, you're getting one basis point interest, and in savings, you're getting one basis point interest. And so all this free flow, which subsidizes our banks, which subsidizes the federal government to some degree in a world of efficiency, where you would have every citizen with a wallet and the stablecoin.
00:11:51.174 - 00:11:55.804, Speaker D: Would collect interest, that float goes away.
00:11:56.304 - 00:12:28.984, Speaker C: One of the reasons I got into crypto was I think this is the most progressive industry. It's like progressive plus libertarian, some weird, funny baby of left and right, but it has the capacity to really bring money and resource to the masses in a much more fair way. Right? And so it hasn't yet. It's made small inroads, but really it hasn't lived up to its potential yet. But that's the reason I got into the thing.
00:12:29.324 - 00:13:03.098, Speaker B: Since you bring this up, I was going to ask this later, but let's go into this. You're talking about progressives and libertarians. I think most people are well aware of the libertarian ethos behind chancellor on the brink of bailout for second bailout for banks, which is what Satoshi wrote in the first block of bitcoin. But let's talk about the progressive argument I think you're alluding to. You know, actually, historically, if I thought of, if you asked me what political party people on Wall street would be, be uniformly republican as a child, like, that's what I would have thought. Said. It doesn't seem true now, particularly with what we're seeing, you know, in Congress, which we'll get into.
00:13:03.098 - 00:13:07.834, Speaker B: But you're a Democrat. You're one of the most well known Democrats on Wall street, right?
00:13:07.874 - 00:13:08.734, Speaker D: You have been.
00:13:09.434 - 00:13:11.746, Speaker C: Is that a fair statement? I would think most of the people.
00:13:11.810 - 00:13:19.114, Speaker D: I've met are either center left or center right, and they're not that far apart, right.
00:13:19.414 - 00:13:22.646, Speaker C: Most rational people tend to be center.
00:13:22.830 - 00:13:24.022, Speaker D: Left or center right.
00:13:24.118 - 00:13:57.868, Speaker C: I shifted from center left towards progressive for a while because I was like, whoa. In 30 years, the rich poor gap has just gotten immense. From the time I graduated from college in the last twelve years, the cost of a house in America has gone from 190,000 to 390,000. It's harder and harder for people in the bottom 70% to actually fulfill their dreams. And I thought, we need to do some more radical things. I don't think we should do them inefficiently. I don't think we should do them where markets don't play a part.
00:13:57.868 - 00:14:12.224, Speaker C: And so you can call me progression, you can call me center left. I think crypto had that capacity to help. I think it still does. What has been fricking infuriating is it's the progressive wing that doesn't want to see it that way.
00:14:12.564 - 00:14:15.012, Speaker D: And I tell you, I've been in.
00:14:15.028 - 00:14:22.468, Speaker C: DC a lot recently. There's bipartisan agreement, quite frankly, on the two different bills that are already there on the stablecoin bill and on the.
00:14:22.556 - 00:14:26.524, Speaker B: Right, there'll be some push and pull, but people would put something forth if they could, 100%.
00:14:26.604 - 00:14:34.116, Speaker C: And it is this small cabal that's stopping it. Most people you meet with, they don't see this as partisan.
00:14:34.180 - 00:14:39.768, Speaker B: That's good to hear, because I was going to ask what this wing of the democratic party's problem, what is their problem with crypto? It doesn't.
00:14:39.816 - 00:14:51.080, Speaker C: I don't understand. I have not gotten it explained to me, and I've asked. I've asked a ton of people. It's only used for bad stuff. It's only rich guys made money. The poor guys lost all their money. I was like, that's actually not the case.
00:14:51.112 - 00:14:51.560, Speaker B: This is the case.
00:14:51.592 - 00:15:02.240, Speaker C: This is the first revolution where it started with the little guy. Matter of fact, I was like one of the only institutional. Dan Moore. There were a few players that got in early. Most of the people got in early. You never heard their names.
00:15:02.312 - 00:15:18.376, Speaker B: I mean, right now, if you do the math, if you had dollar cost, averaged bitcoin every day for, like the last three years, even bought the top in 21, you're still in profit, like, right? So, like, the average guy could put $5 a day into bitcoin. You'd have made money. And none of us, over any timeframe.
00:15:18.400 - 00:15:27.088, Speaker C: And none of us have ever, ever tried to argue that there was no fraud, that there were no bad actors, that there were no rug pulls, or.
00:15:27.096 - 00:15:31.004, Speaker B: That it's a panacea for everything no one has again.
00:15:31.384 - 00:15:35.072, Speaker C: And there was a mania. There's manias in law, there was a mania in Beanie babies, there was a.
00:15:35.088 - 00:15:38.124, Speaker B: Mania in nfts, a mania in certain meme stocks.
00:15:38.624 - 00:15:42.752, Speaker C: You know, that's human nature. And I do think it comes to an end.
00:15:42.888 - 00:15:43.160, Speaker D: Right?
00:15:43.192 - 00:15:54.832, Speaker C: We've got an election. Either the Republicans will win or the Democrats win. I think there's a change in leadership in treasury and in Sec, and either way. And so we probably have another 15.
00:15:54.928 - 00:15:58.072, Speaker D: Months to, you know, or even eleven.
00:15:58.128 - 00:16:11.442, Speaker C: Months to anchor down and just grind it out. But what is promising is the broad Congress wants to get something done.
00:16:11.498 - 00:16:31.746, Speaker B: Yeah, I hope that we get something. And it's just wild to see the creator of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Senator Warren, which is born out of the Occupy Wall street movement and the great financial crisis, is now working directly with the Bank Policy Institute and the American Bank association to write bills that they want.
00:16:31.850 - 00:17:04.290, Speaker C: Isn't that strange? I tweeted something yesterday which got a lot of traction. I was like, it's almost heartbreaking to see someone who came to Washington with good intent get corrupted by power. And that's all I can. I mean, I've literally watched Elizabeth Warren's career from the time she got here, and she came with good intention. Right. She was gonna protect the little guy, and now it's all about her all the time, every soundbite to be in the news. She's not passed one bill, and so has not been an effective legislator.
00:17:04.290 - 00:17:25.690, Speaker C: She's been allowed legislator. But, and I see that across the board in DC, it is so frustrating that the narcissism of politics. I mean, I'm in an industry with a lot of narcissists, right? Line up 13 billionaires, and it's a degree of narcissism we all like. When you have power, you have some narcissism.
00:17:25.722 - 00:17:29.778, Speaker B: I get it. Anyone with a Twitter account or an X account has got some narcissism.
00:17:29.826 - 00:17:30.154, Speaker D: Right?
00:17:30.234 - 00:17:32.746, Speaker C: But it pales in compared to the politicians.
00:17:32.810 - 00:17:32.986, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:33.010 - 00:17:33.574, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:17:33.914 - 00:17:45.578, Speaker B: All right, let's shift gears a little bit. I wanted to ask you, Mike, about. You had mentioned this on criminal justice. You're well known for being a big patron of the bail project, right? What is that? What other criminal justice issues are you into? I know this is a bit of an aside.
00:17:45.626 - 00:18:30.242, Speaker C: Let me tell you what. At one point, crypto and bail were two of the most unpopular subjects in America. I was like, how did I pick those two? Listen, stepping back, we have a criminal justice system that is not just, that is not fair, that's not economic, that's not moral. And as I stumbled into it, just literally because my daughter was working for the Bronx defenders in the summer and started talking about what she was seeing, and I got more involved, and I made a bunch of money in Ethereum in 2017 and decided to put some of it to philanthropic use, I just got more angry. And so I am the chairman of the board of the bail project. We're the largest bail organization in America. Both our direct service.
00:18:30.242 - 00:18:32.334, Speaker C: We've bailed out over 30,000 people.
00:18:34.034 - 00:18:34.370, Speaker D: And.
00:18:34.402 - 00:18:57.554, Speaker C: We'Ve been working to change the laws. The reality is tonight, 450,000 people will go to bed in a jail cell, having been arrested but not convicted. And if they had any money, they would not be sitting in that jail cell. And they sit there until they plea out. And the longer they stay in jail, the larger the chance of them being criminalized.
00:18:58.334 - 00:18:59.078, Speaker D: Right.
00:18:59.246 - 00:19:06.462, Speaker C: Both jail suicides, jail rapes all happen, quite frankly, in the first 45, 50 days, someone's in jail.
00:19:06.638 - 00:19:07.190, Speaker D: Right.
00:19:07.302 - 00:19:18.894, Speaker C: Jail for people don't know is one year and under. Prison is one year and over. And I'm not saying everyone deserves to not spend time in jail or not have their freedom reprimanded. Right.
00:19:19.054 - 00:19:19.806, Speaker D: Sure.
00:19:19.990 - 00:19:31.772, Speaker C: It's not bail out anybody, but we've got the majority of people sitting in jail, can't afford $2,500. That's the average bail the bail project pays. So it's not like we're paying $800.
00:19:31.788 - 00:19:34.580, Speaker B: Yeah, you're not getting like, accused serial killers or murderers out. Right.
00:19:34.692 - 00:19:39.036, Speaker D: And listen, we have a whole system.
00:19:39.180 - 00:20:08.904, Speaker C: If you go visit prisons, you're like, you cannot believe the conditions people live in. There's nothing about rehabilitation in our space. And so I'm also on the board of the Reform alliance with Jay Z and Michael Rubin and Bob Kraft, working on probation. And we just passed a huge law in Pennsylvania. Shout out to the Reform alliance. I've got our own group of fellows. They're called galaxy leaders, where we have now 50 50, 60 people that work in the field that we've given fellowship, two year fellowships to.
00:20:08.904 - 00:20:18.460, Speaker C: And so literally, I spent a huge amount of my time and resource trying to change both the narrative and the actual laws. We've got a long way to go there.
00:20:18.572 - 00:20:30.146, Speaker B: Yeah, it sounds like a good cause, Mike. Let's shift gears again. I want to go back to macro and crypto, talk about the fed, too. It's been a big year in rates and in Fed policy.
00:20:30.330 - 00:20:32.002, Speaker C: Yeah, listen, the Fed right now, have.
00:20:32.018 - 00:20:36.554, Speaker B: They regained their credibility? Do they have credibility? How would you rate the Fed this year?
00:20:36.634 - 00:20:44.762, Speaker D: So the hardest part about when people talk about central banks is it's a two person partnership.
00:20:44.818 - 00:21:07.674, Speaker C: It's the central bank and the government and the treasury. It's really not the treasury. It's the central bank and the Congress that together create economic policy or whoever are the stewards of your economy. Powell can be criticized for waiting to raise rates too long. I think that's now consensus. He waited. The bubble got a little hotter than it needed to get.
00:21:07.674 - 00:21:27.124, Speaker C: Probably good for you guys who rode the last few months of crypto 2021, but allowed inflation to take off. He then came out with a golden hammer and it literally bashed us on the head with five and a quarter percent rate hikes, 25 basis points at a time. That's a lot of rate hikes.
00:21:27.984 - 00:21:35.244, Speaker D: And I think right now he's looking pretty good.
00:21:35.584 - 00:21:52.086, Speaker C: Inflation is coming down really quick. That's one of the big surprises there. It's coming down faster than we all thought it would. So inflation has come down, growth has stayed pretty good. We keep, the mistake a lot of macro guys made this year is keep thinking growth is going to fall off a cliff. It's going to roll over. And it hasn't.
00:21:52.086 - 00:22:00.206, Speaker C: It hasn't for a couple of reasons. Right? You get real recessions when you have unemployment and employment is still tight.
00:22:00.350 - 00:22:03.046, Speaker D: There's a secular reason.
00:22:03.150 - 00:22:23.716, Speaker C: Right? Baby boomers are finally getting old enough to stop working. And my generation, well, I'm actually a baby boomer by 31 days, which just is like the bane. Oh, my God, that is a crime. It really is painful. I identify as Gen Z, but Gen X. Right. That in between is the lowest population group we've ever had in America.
00:22:23.716 - 00:22:29.772, Speaker C: The baby busters. And so you're aging people out of the workforce.
00:22:29.828 - 00:22:34.060, Speaker D: One, construction after zero.
00:22:34.092 - 00:22:43.326, Speaker C: Eight, we stopped building houses. We have this huge deficit of housing in America, tens of millions of houses that we need to build. And so the construction industry, which is.
00:22:43.350 - 00:22:46.238, Speaker D: By far the most cyclical, usually lays.
00:22:46.286 - 00:22:52.934, Speaker C: Off the most people, isn't laying people off because they got too many houses to build. And so the construction industry is holding.
00:22:52.974 - 00:22:57.054, Speaker D: In autos, often cyclical.
00:22:57.214 - 00:23:12.534, Speaker C: Right. We went through a period where used car prices skyrocketed because you couldn't get a new car, so you bought a used car. You just saw the auto unions, just went on strike and got a wonderful new deal.
00:23:13.634 - 00:23:15.934, Speaker D: You don't do that unless there's a lot of demand.
00:23:16.554 - 00:23:18.658, Speaker C: You don't strike when they're going to fire you.
00:23:18.746 - 00:23:19.694, Speaker B: That's a good point.
00:23:20.074 - 00:23:29.714, Speaker C: People aren't getting fired in the auto industry. And so the two big industries that usually create unemployment aren't create unemployment. The biggest thing that I think people.
00:23:29.794 - 00:23:33.146, Speaker D: Missed was, and one of the reasons.
00:23:33.170 - 00:23:36.810, Speaker C: I love bitcoin is our government, starting.
00:23:36.842 - 00:23:41.858, Speaker D: With Trump before COVID accelerating during COVID.
00:23:41.986 - 00:24:05.866, Speaker C: Handing off the baton of irresponsible spending to Biden. Biden put that right in his teeth and started running. It's like the jamaican relay of bad spending. We now spend 25% of GDP federally. That number is supposed to be 20. I worked at the White House in 1984. To give you an idea how old I am, it was my first real job.
00:24:05.866 - 00:24:21.534, Speaker C: I'm a GS four working office and management and budget. And I learned really clearly 20% spending. And we try to tax 20, and when we do them together, we balance the budget. It happened in 1999. Shout out to Bill Clinton. Only time in my life we had the balance budget.
00:24:21.954 - 00:24:22.650, Speaker D: Kind of crazy.
00:24:22.682 - 00:24:23.454, Speaker B: That's wild.
00:24:23.794 - 00:24:26.114, Speaker D: But it's 20% now.
00:24:26.154 - 00:24:35.014, Speaker C: We're normalized 25% spending. I was in DC, I was talking to some Congress. They didn't even know what it was supposed to be. I was like, you got to be kidding. Now the smart guys know exactly.
00:24:35.354 - 00:24:37.682, Speaker D: We've normalized 25% spending.
00:24:37.778 - 00:24:41.162, Speaker C: We are planning on a 6% budget deficit next year.
00:24:41.338 - 00:24:42.410, Speaker D: We're at full employment.
00:24:42.482 - 00:24:43.698, Speaker C: And this is insanity.
00:24:43.746 - 00:24:45.786, Speaker B: This would be the time you should not have any at all.
00:24:45.890 - 00:24:58.224, Speaker C: This is insanity. And it's going to get harder and harder to get up. We're going to have a trillion dollars of interest payments next year. That's 4% of GDP. And so we're at that point where.
00:24:58.724 - 00:25:00.836, Speaker D: The only way out of this is.
00:25:00.860 - 00:25:16.548, Speaker C: To debase your currency. Some what central bank's got to try to do. And I think pal is doing this. You want to talk top or 2%? 2% and allow three and a half 4%. That's how you slowly inflate away your debt that year at 10% inflation. That inflated away a bunch of debt.
00:25:16.636 - 00:25:17.028, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:25:17.076 - 00:25:19.744, Speaker C: But what does that also do? It erodes your purse in power.
00:25:19.824 - 00:25:20.376, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:25:20.440 - 00:25:32.240, Speaker C: In 2012, you could buy a house in this country for $190,000. In 2023, the average house is 390. It has doubled in twelve years.
00:25:32.272 - 00:25:32.872, Speaker B: It's unbelievable.
00:25:32.928 - 00:25:34.960, Speaker C: That's insanity. So if you're a young kid coming.
00:25:34.992 - 00:25:37.160, Speaker D: Out of school, you're screwed.
00:25:37.232 - 00:25:40.472, Speaker B: Yeah, it stinks if you happen to graduate, right, in 2009.
00:25:40.568 - 00:25:46.044, Speaker C: But let me tell you, if you bought bitcoin in 2010 or 2012, yeah.
00:25:47.244 - 00:25:48.292, Speaker D: You'Re doing pretty good.
00:25:48.388 - 00:26:27.894, Speaker C: You've protected your purchasing power against inflation. I mean, that's the simple argument for bitcoin. And yeah, I'm cherry picking the low, but actually, if you look pretty much do it any time. And so the question just will be, what's the cost of the house going to be in 2030? And is your dollar plus its 5% interest going to keep up? Are you going to need to have some other assets? It's not just bitcoin like it's bitcoin. I think silver and gold will go. It's other cryptos, it's equities so equities go when database currency, because everything is worth less, so the price goes higher.
00:26:28.394 - 00:26:28.682, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:26:28.698 - 00:26:47.744, Speaker B: It's like the base asset loses value. So anything you price in, it should be worth more. Let's talk a little bit more about bitcoin and macro. You talk to a lot of macro traders. You are a well known macro trader. You mentioned you and Dan Moorhead did this trade years ago. Almost nobody else did, or you guys were probably, probably a relatively small group chat back then.
00:26:47.744 - 00:26:50.080, Speaker B: The group chat has expanded now, has it not?
00:26:50.152 - 00:26:50.336, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:26:50.360 - 00:26:51.416, Speaker B: Listen, you're not alone anymore.
00:26:51.480 - 00:27:07.166, Speaker C: What's wonderful about certainly bitcoin is, it's now just on the macro dashboard. I'm sure when I walk into any macro trader, they've got crude and ten year and gold and silver and probably the corn price and ten years and jgbs and bitcoin.
00:27:07.240 - 00:27:07.850, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:27:08.002 - 00:27:14.134, Speaker C: And so it's a macro asset. Most of those funds play it through CME futures.
00:27:15.114 - 00:27:15.666, Speaker D: Some.
00:27:15.770 - 00:27:20.626, Speaker C: We had a big account recently, buy a whole bunch of bitcoin cash with us. That makes me really happy.
00:27:20.650 - 00:27:21.642, Speaker B: You mean spot bitcoin.
00:27:21.698 - 00:27:22.218, Speaker C: Spot bitcoin, yeah.
00:27:22.226 - 00:27:22.322, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:27:22.338 - 00:27:23.694, Speaker B: Not bitcoin cash.
00:27:24.914 - 00:27:25.346, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:27:25.410 - 00:27:26.010, Speaker B: Spot bitcoin.
00:27:26.042 - 00:27:26.306, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:27:26.370 - 00:27:43.570, Speaker C: Spot bitcoin with us. I think when the ETF shows up, that will be the weapon of choice. Why? Because it's easy. It'll have liquidity. It's the same broker, same brokerage account. They'll get margin on it. And so I think you'll see a lot more.
00:27:43.570 - 00:27:48.650, Speaker C: Both long short equity funds, macro funds, institutional funds participate because it's easy.
00:27:48.802 - 00:28:06.370, Speaker B: So the room is big. What about some, do you know some peers of yours, whether in like, trading or investing or just not, that should, like bitcoin and crypto or, or explicitly don't like, how are you talking to these? What are you hearing from them? Like, are any of them rolling over recently?
00:28:06.442 - 00:28:09.642, Speaker C: And listen, I think most people now recognize it.
00:28:09.658 - 00:28:12.238, Speaker D: So I remember I used to have.
00:28:12.286 - 00:28:17.302, Speaker C: Conversations with some of the biggest fund managers in the world. Right? Ray Dalio is a perfect example.
00:28:17.358 - 00:28:19.582, Speaker D: I remember trying to orange pill that.
00:28:19.598 - 00:28:37.494, Speaker C: Guy over and over. It made zero sense for a $160 billion hedge fund to have a position in an asset that was yo big. And so only at a half a trillion, a trillion dollars and real liquidity.
00:28:37.914 - 00:28:42.114, Speaker D: Does any asset make sense for big.
00:28:42.154 - 00:28:49.450, Speaker C: Portfolios, for the real big ones we have grown into. We're now big enough for anyone. We weren't.
00:28:49.522 - 00:28:53.054, Speaker D: When we were a $200 billion asset, we just weren't.
00:28:55.314 - 00:28:57.506, Speaker C: Or $100 billion asset, but as a.
00:28:57.530 - 00:29:01.578, Speaker D: Trillion dollar asset it's now big enough for almost anyone.
00:29:01.626 - 00:29:42.844, Speaker C: And so I think you're going to see, I always say, what's the difference between bitcoin and gold if they got the same macro story? And so I can talk about macro. The gold adoption story happened over 3000 years. It ain't going anywhere. The bitcoin adoption story is in its first, it's the second decade and it's picking up steam. And so what I mean by adoption is that people see it as a viable asset. What drives me fricking crazy is when Elizabeth Warren or Jamie Dimon or times Janney Yellen said, well, I don't really see value in it. I was like the gall, the arrogance that since you don't see value, there's no value.
00:29:42.844 - 00:30:01.180, Speaker C: But Abby Johnson, well, she must be stupid, right? Stan druckler, stupid. Ray Dalio, dumb. Jeff Yost, dumb. Pete Brigger, dumb. The arrogance. You're looking at some of the best investors that have walked this earth that say, hey, there's some value in it. Bitcoin's value is the social construction.
00:30:01.180 - 00:30:12.444, Speaker C: I say it has value. You say it has, therefore it has value. I don't care what Elizabeth Warren says. Quite frankly, I don't care what Jamie Dimon says. And they have been proven wrong. And the group of people that care about it have been proven right.
00:30:12.524 - 00:30:15.556, Speaker B: Don't think you're smarter than the market value.
00:30:15.620 - 00:30:30.070, Speaker C: Listen, you can decide. I don't want to buy it. Warren Buffet decided like it. Charlie Munger, God rest his soul, passed away hating bitcoin. They were wrong in the time frame to operate on. It doesn't matter. Charlie Munger made so much money.
00:30:30.070 - 00:30:40.714, Speaker C: He went to. I'm sure he passed away with the biggest smile on his face. He was a great mentor to people. You don't have to be in every. You don't have to be in every asset, right? I wish. I bought Apple stock 20 years ago.
00:30:41.134 - 00:30:42.694, Speaker D: I remember buying a bunch of it.
00:30:42.814 - 00:30:51.562, Speaker C: I sat with Peter Thiel one day and he convinced this group of people that Apple, Microsoft, Google, these weren't text talks, they were monopolies.
00:30:51.758 - 00:30:53.050, Speaker D: And I was like, it just clicked.
00:30:53.082 - 00:31:02.450, Speaker C: Every once in a while an idea clicks. And so I went out and bought a bunch of it, all of it. And it had a great year. They were probably all up 30% that year. And I sold them all. That was 2014.
00:31:02.562 - 00:31:03.090, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:31:03.202 - 00:31:04.458, Speaker B: How has it done since then?
00:31:04.546 - 00:31:08.378, Speaker C: It's shocking. Once you realize something is a monopoly, you never sell it.
00:31:08.426 - 00:31:09.054, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:31:09.514 - 00:31:26.638, Speaker B: Okay, just a couple more quick questions, Mike. One just looking forward to the next year for Galaxy. And you founded Galaxy in 2018? Well, I guess technically in 2017, but really, you guys really started 2018. It's been through a lot. I joined you three years ago. What are you looking forward for in the future with Galaxy?
00:31:26.686 - 00:32:10.504, Speaker C: I hire more guys like this guy. Listen, we started to be an institutional player in this space, and we were early and listen, I'm proud that we have survived and we've grown our balance sheet tremendously. We started with a $500 million, well, $300 million balance sheet with only raising a tiny amount of capital. We're now close to $1.9 billion in balance sheet. We'd been hired before the sell off, but we've done a great job of preserving because you remember, that's paying salaries, that's paying expenses, that's paying tax. A lot has come out.
00:32:10.504 - 00:32:31.876, Speaker C: Employees have gotten wealthier, and all that's been funded by our investment prowess. At the same time, we are building four to five really key businesses. Our mining business is humming, which I'm really proud of down in Texas. The Helios operation. Doing a great job.
00:32:31.940 - 00:32:32.684, Speaker B: Shout out Helios.
00:32:32.724 - 00:32:47.226, Speaker C: Shout out Helios. I think staking as a service market, making as a service 2025. Four should be big years for those businesses. Our derivative business is wonderful. Had a great year.
00:32:47.290 - 00:32:49.562, Speaker B: I think we're the biggest in derivatives at this point.
00:32:49.698 - 00:32:52.506, Speaker C: You know, I always. I'm careful about superlatives.
00:32:52.570 - 00:32:53.174, Speaker B: Fair.
00:32:53.514 - 00:32:54.666, Speaker C: We're certainly in.
00:32:54.730 - 00:32:57.442, Speaker B: Yeah, we can't actually know, too. It's over the counter stuff is pride.
00:32:57.498 - 00:33:17.224, Speaker C: But we are a go to player in the derivative market and in spot, too. We're a go to maker in spot. Our credit business has been very well run. We want to expand that. We have an investment banking business no one else does. 2023 was an okay year. A lot of people wanted to get done deals.
00:33:17.224 - 00:33:53.020, Speaker C: Not a lot of deals getting done, not a lot of capital coming into the space. A lot more optimistic for 2024, our asset management business went from 1,000,000,007 to 5 billion in assets. Winning the FTX mandates. That was a big deal for us emotionally, because the group looked at everybody and they said, these guys know what they're doing. I always wanted us to be the smart guys in the room. We've hired a lot of smart guys, and I think now is our time as institutions move in. We need to be their player.
00:33:53.020 - 00:33:59.544, Speaker C: And listen, we're not a bitcoin only shop, as much as sometimes this guy loves to be. He's at his core of Maxi.
00:34:00.724 - 00:34:01.868, Speaker B: You got to stay grounded, you know?
00:34:01.916 - 00:34:23.676, Speaker C: Yeah, well, if it was a bitcoin only shop, we'd have 50 people, not 465 people. For galaxy to succeed, the crypto ecosystem has to succeed. Multiple tokens have to be important. Tokenization of other assets has to happen. Stable coins has to become more important. Like, that's what we're building. Don't buy our stock if you don't think that's going to happen.
00:34:23.676 - 00:34:27.784, Speaker C: Buy our stock if you think it's going to happen. I'm still a believer.
00:34:28.173 - 00:34:30.925, Speaker D: I want to see some of the.
00:34:30.949 - 00:34:43.933, Speaker C: Web three stuff get traction. If there's been one frustration, it's been we don't have blockchain ticketing yet. We don't have a lot of these decentralized systems that I was hoping we'd have by now. But I haven't lost faith.
00:34:44.013 - 00:35:07.342, Speaker B: We do have more progress on tokenization, I think, than ever before. I've been looking at that since 2017 myself. And I used to joke there were more at one point, there were more token issuance platforms than there were token issuances. But now we have treasuries on chain from major real world asset managers. You've got stable coins are, frankly, globally important. They're widely used around the globe. So a lot of progress has been made on some of these.
00:35:07.358 - 00:35:08.950, Speaker C: We're getting there. And I kind of think this might.
00:35:08.982 - 00:35:11.310, Speaker D: Be one of those things that it.
00:35:11.342 - 00:35:14.594, Speaker C: Doesn'T happen, it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen. And then it happens all at once.
00:35:14.974 - 00:35:18.206, Speaker B: And then suddenly sort of, yes, I'm.
00:35:18.310 - 00:35:28.646, Speaker C: Not as smart as you. I knew that was out there somewhere. And so, listen, 2024 is going to be, I think, an important year. I really think 2025 is the year.
00:35:28.670 - 00:35:30.534, Speaker B: For crypto goes, oh, interesting.
00:35:30.694 - 00:35:54.734, Speaker C: Maybe not in price, but I think it takes that long. Right? We won't have regulation. I don't think in 2024 we might 510 percent chance we'll get it in 2025. And we need regulation. We just do. And listen, the election is in eleven months, and so then it takes four or five months. So you're really mid 25.
00:35:54.734 - 00:36:23.114, Speaker C: I think that's probably when you see these tokenization things start getting to critical mass. And so in some ways, 2024 is going to look a little bit like 2023, with the exception of this giant fire hose called ETF, bringing new capital into the space. And what that capital does is, is allows people the time to keep investing in the projects that actually change the way people live. Bitcoin can change the way people save and protect their wealth.
00:36:23.614 - 00:36:28.594, Speaker D: But it's not going to change the way the financial system operates.
00:36:29.894 - 00:37:07.814, Speaker C: That's the plumbing of all this decentralized defi stuff and quasi defi stuff and stablecoins and tokenized apple shares and tokenized Stradivarius violins and tokenized whatever. The bitcoin and other money coming into the space allows me to hire people. It allows my peers to hire people. It gives us breathing space to actually build out this revolution. And so, thanks to Larry Finkin, and actually, to be fair, I got to give it a shout to the grayscale team for fighting that. And that lawsuit really was like, I don't think the SEC is doing this. Cause they want to.
00:37:07.894 - 00:37:23.474, Speaker B: Yeah, their hand was kind of forced by that ruling. Okay, just a couple few more questions. Mike, I'm gonna segue into this. Cause I've got to ask you about your outfit. It's a magnificent sweatsuit. Here you're wearing. It says, iowa wrestling.
00:37:23.474 - 00:37:26.214, Speaker B: It's signed. Are you wearing.
00:37:26.374 - 00:37:28.214, Speaker C: First of all, I was a wrestler.
00:37:28.334 - 00:37:29.950, Speaker B: You were the captain of the Princeton wrestler.
00:37:29.982 - 00:37:42.974, Speaker C: And once a wrestler, always wrestler. I still identify myself as a wrestler before a Wall street guy. Like, what? Do you have a wrestler? Oh, I actually work on Wall street, too. It's a sport that defines who you are when you're in it.
00:37:43.874 - 00:37:46.034, Speaker D: It's a sport of toughness.
00:37:46.074 - 00:38:11.794, Speaker C: It's a sport of leadership. Two of my favorite characters in the sport, Tom and Terry brands, are the coaches at Iowa. Tom was a gold medalist in the Olympics. Terry was a bronze medalist in the Olympics, was the best in the world. It's a long and painful story of him not being an olympic medalist. They both were national champions at Iowa. They're the two guys I've met in my life that I think were born with the most testosterone.
00:38:11.794 - 00:38:31.334, Speaker C: They are maniacs. I can only imagine them as kids. Anyways, they were the guys that gave me the mission to bring energy to wrestling. They're like, no, no, you got to bring energy to wrestling. And so I had an event. Next thing you know, I'm throwing it in the middle of Times Square and Grand Central Station. This organization, I sort of beat the streets.
00:38:31.334 - 00:38:39.232, Speaker C: I didn't start being a group of people started, really blew up. And so they sent me this for Christmas.
00:38:39.288 - 00:38:40.168, Speaker B: I love that.
00:38:40.336 - 00:39:02.064, Speaker C: Actually, they didn't send it. They would never. They're not the kind of guys that would put their names on something. They're a woman that works for their organization, wanted to do something nice for me since I bought some theater tickets for some of their kids. And she had them sign these things and send it to me. So shout out, Iowa wrestling. Toughest, toughest state in America.
00:39:02.184 - 00:39:03.048, Speaker B: Is that the best?
00:39:03.136 - 00:39:03.648, Speaker D: Are they the best?
00:39:03.696 - 00:39:08.744, Speaker C: They're not the best. They're traditionally one of the two or three best programs in the country. They used to dominate.
00:39:08.784 - 00:39:13.568, Speaker D: Now Penn State dominates, but they have the toughest culture.
00:39:13.696 - 00:39:21.524, Speaker B: Do you like, I mean, you love, you're a trader and an investor. Does wrestling come into that? Are you wrestling the markets?
00:39:22.144 - 00:39:25.284, Speaker C: Wrestling teaches you how to lose and get back up.
00:39:25.584 - 00:39:27.000, Speaker D: You can't be a trader and think.
00:39:27.032 - 00:39:28.574, Speaker C: You'Re going to be 99 and one.
00:39:28.664 - 00:39:34.778, Speaker D: Yeah, right. If you're 60 40, you're a zillionaire.
00:39:34.906 - 00:39:49.394, Speaker C: If you're 55 45, you're a billionaire, right? Right. If you're 51 49 and you do it well enough, you're a billionaire. Like, it's, it's a business. You need to learn to lose and get tough and be resilient and come back to work. And you learn that in wrestling every single day.
00:39:49.474 - 00:39:50.994, Speaker B: Sounds like something we learn in crypto, too.
00:39:51.034 - 00:40:00.530, Speaker C: Yeah, no, it's, there's a great, you know, my theme song was from Shumbawamba. I get knocked down but I get up again ain't nobody gonna hold me down. That's a wrestling ethos.
00:40:00.642 - 00:40:08.218, Speaker B: I think it should be our ethos, too, Mike. Jumbo Wumba, Galaxy theme song Mike Novogratz, CEO chairman of Galaxy Digital. Thank you so much, Mike.
