00:00:00.480 - 00:00:34.010, Speaker A: We will get through this as a country. We will get through this if you're a Democrat, as a party. But right now, Trump is, you know, he's a great politician, like him or not, and he sees this, and it's almost becoming a purity test. I said this on our earnings call, like Sab 121, this boat's gonna be really big if the Democrats vote to repeal it. And just so your audience knows what Saab 121 is, it's an accounting rule that says if you custody bitcoin or crypto digital assets in your custody, you've got to put them on your balance sheet.

00:00:37.322 - 00:00:38.722, Speaker B: But then, because they're bank of New.
00:00:38.738 - 00:00:43.002, Speaker A: York and you want to be a custodian, it blows your balance sheet up. You know, it doesn't really.

00:00:48.250 - 00:00:48.682, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:48.778 - 00:00:55.274, Speaker A: And it does. It shouldn't have been there. It's stopping. It's actually worse for the banks than it is for the crypto companies. Totally.
