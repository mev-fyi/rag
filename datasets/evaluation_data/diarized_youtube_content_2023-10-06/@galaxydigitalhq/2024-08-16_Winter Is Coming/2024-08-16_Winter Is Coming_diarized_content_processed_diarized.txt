00:00:08.039 - 00:00:12.838, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to galaxy brains.
00:00:12.934 - 00:00:14.090, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:14.830 - 00:00:24.446, Speaker A: So we had CPI numbers. Yes, we did this morning. It's Wednesday, August 14. They looked mostly flat. I don't know. Unpack what you saw.
00:00:24.558 - 00:01:00.468, Speaker B: Yeah. So the headline month over month figure for core CPI came in at 0.17% month on month, and that was verse expectations of around a 0.2. So really right in line. The components that saw strength were a little bit concerning because you had the shelter component print in the 0.4s, but that was mitigated by slightly softer auto prices and used car prices. Sorry.
00:01:00.468 - 00:01:42.240, Speaker B: And slightly softer, like airline fares than expected. And so there's a little bit for kind of everyone but high level. If you think about the trend that inflation has been on, I think the three month rate of inflation is like sub 2%. Like the six month rate of inflation is, you know, right around to. So the stuff is printing at levels that are consistent with the Fed's mandate. And that should kind of reinforce the fact that we are going to start to see some easing starting in September. I think in terms of front end pricing, you've got a lot baked in already.
00:01:42.240 - 00:02:18.700, Speaker B: And so I think the bar for more aggressive or quicker cuts is kind of quite high at the moment. You know, just to provide some context for the audience, you have about eight cuts priced in over the next year, which is a lot. Right. That's 200 basis points. And so, you know, I think that that's a lot. You know, so if inflation came in soft, it was gonna be really tough to price in that much more. And so now the market's kind of moving on and kind of looking at retail sales and employment figures.
00:02:18.700 - 00:02:39.844, Speaker B: Retail sales are out tomorrow. You also have initial jobless claims and other employment data coming out over the next couple of weeks. And so I think the focus of the market is going to start moving more towards the employment side of the mandate because the price stuff kind of seems like it's settling down and. Yeah, and I think market reactions were pretty benign.
00:02:39.932 - 00:02:52.266, Speaker A: And all of that is supportive of cuts, right. I mean, if employment is, unemployment is rising, prices are flattening, cooling, then it looks like green light for easing, right?
00:02:52.338 - 00:02:53.706, Speaker B: Yes, absolutely.
00:02:53.898 - 00:03:11.892, Speaker A: Is that the main macro story? Are we still concerned about the carry trade in Japan? Or I guess there's global, there's geopolitical questions, but it feels like now we're in a. Cuts are coming, winter is coming, the cuts are coming. That's the main sort of focus now, especially cause it's August.
00:03:12.026 - 00:03:18.300, Speaker B: No, absolutely. And yeah, there's just not much else to kind of think about outside of the election.
00:03:18.760 - 00:03:20.152, Speaker A: Let's talk about that in a second, too.
00:03:20.216 - 00:03:39.736, Speaker B: We can, I think in terms of the japanese carry trade, you know, the BOJ and the officials have kind of indicated that, you know, they're cognizant of financial conditions and that, you know, their next action is likely to happen after year end. And so those kind of concerns around Japan have abated.
00:03:39.808 - 00:03:45.110, Speaker A: So when they say that, it's code for like, we're probably not gonna surprise hike again and cause more turmoil.
00:03:45.150 - 00:03:45.730, Speaker B: Right.
00:03:46.030 - 00:03:47.110, Speaker A: That's what they're saying basically.
00:03:47.190 - 00:03:54.806, Speaker B: They're basically gonna try to do it in as methodical and as measured of a way as possible because markets have a tendency to overreact.
00:03:54.878 - 00:03:55.134, Speaker A: Right.
00:03:55.182 - 00:03:58.190, Speaker B: Right. And so they're not trying to cause financial debt stability.
00:03:58.230 - 00:03:59.926, Speaker A: It's assuring to the market.
00:04:00.118 - 00:04:22.970, Speaker B: Got it. And so, you know, that's kind of out the way. And I think the iranian response to Israel is a little on the back burner because there were some headlines out yesterday saying that the Gaza peace deal is kind of close and that Iran would not strike if it seemed like.
00:04:23.010 - 00:04:24.970, Speaker A: There was a negotiation or whatever.
00:04:25.050 - 00:04:56.524, Speaker B: Correct. And so some of those risks have abated. Oil started to calm down. Gold has started to sell off a little bit. And so you're in this kind of period where there was a lot of forced selling, unwind of positioning, and conditions have gotten better. And so risk assets are tending to trade a little bit better at the moment. Now the question is, will they continue? And I think so absent any big risk shocks, you're probably in kind of like long and chill mode.
00:04:56.572 - 00:05:03.814, Speaker A: The fundamentals are not bad. Right. Inflation is cooling, employment, unemployment is going up, but it's not like terrible. Right.
00:05:03.942 - 00:05:18.998, Speaker B: I just think the market moves as a function of, like, catalysts and positioning and like, yeah, the fundamentals might be not that good, but it's like, you know, how many people really understand what price to earnings is on Microsoft stock?
00:05:19.054 - 00:05:19.454, Speaker A: That's true.
00:05:19.502 - 00:05:37.082, Speaker B: Or apple or nobody. Not many people don't. That's not really what drives markets. It's kind of these panic and greed moments and these positioning dynamics and options markets. And so you're kind of at that, like, you know, like the drift market and the drift who tend to drift higher.
00:05:37.226 - 00:05:39.514, Speaker A: Yeah. Because of people working, contributing to 401 ks.
00:05:39.562 - 00:05:40.578, Speaker B: 401 ks.
00:05:40.714 - 00:06:06.366, Speaker A: Let's talk about bitcoin and also the election a little bit. I think we've been of the view. I know you and I, I've said that out again, outside of risk shocks or. Yeah, you had some. There were a couple catalysts, positive and negative. You certainly had the supply overhangs, whether it's the. The us government in their bitcoin or the ethereum, ETF outflows from the grayscale complex or other movements like that.
00:06:06.366 - 00:06:10.766, Speaker A: Most of that has settled. Right? Gox is fully distributed, as far as we can tell.
00:06:10.838 - 00:06:11.650, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:06:12.070 - 00:06:49.400, Speaker A: There's always us governments of the world hold a lot of crypto, so that can always surprise. On the positive side, though, or sort of mix, you also have this presidential election, and we've sort of said that to me, literally. I'm not really creating or changing a thesis when it comes to from now until that, especially if the waltz, Harris campaign, Harris Waltz campaign were to come out extremely against crypto, whereas you have the Trump Vance campaign being extremely pro crypto. What do you think? Do we trade range bound for the next couple of months? To me, that's the biggest catalyst.
00:06:49.870 - 00:06:52.814, Speaker B: You know, I mean, I think, and.
00:06:52.822 - 00:06:57.526, Speaker A: We don't yet really know, by the way, on the Paris waltz campaign, what their position is on crypto.
00:06:57.678 - 00:07:15.406, Speaker B: Yeah, not really, no. But I would have thought that if you were worried about a tight election, that on an issue where you could pick up votes by not moving that much, you would have already done it. I think you're a little pessimistic on walts. I'm very pessimistic about that.
00:07:15.438 - 00:07:16.462, Speaker A: On crypto. Yeah.
00:07:16.526 - 00:08:04.350, Speaker B: Taking a more nuanced stance about it, because, I mean, you'll get into this with the guest upcoming, but I genuinely don't understand where the antagonism for crypto comes from. It is democratic, being able to send money back home anywhere, anyone banking the unbanked. And some would say that there's been a lot of good created by crypto, a lot of employment, jobs. Right. And so, like, I don't necessarily know where the straight up, like, antagonism, like, this is so bad for people. Like, I gotta be so anti it. And just the lack of, like, you know, let's meet at the table and kind of discuss things comes from.
00:08:04.350 - 00:08:33.502, Speaker B: And so I'm not, like, optimistic because, like, I haven't seen that side, like, really engage in a way that is constructive. And all we're asking for is engagement. It's not even like you need to be pro crypto, like, aggressively, like, engage. Right. And put people around you that have been engaging. And so it is concerning the stuff you highlighted in your suite. But the way I would think about it is I'm a traitor.
00:08:33.502 - 00:09:36.240, Speaker B: And I think that you went from a Trump polling in a kind of an extreme level where he's really favored to win 65% odds, to now where he's extremely unfavored in the standpoint of, I think the predicted odds are around, like, 44, 45%. And so I think that's probably a local extreme for his odds, particularly given that you have debates coming up, and a debate can single handedly flip the perception of a candidate. And right now, what it seems like is that Kamala hasn't really been forced to tackle anything up, you know, real policy nuance and stuff. And so I do think that the debates give Trump an opening to change perception. And what we have to keep in mind is that the election comes down to a handful of counties and a handful of states. It is not a nationwide election. It's probably, like 25 counties in the US.
00:09:36.360 - 00:09:39.060, Speaker A: Yeah, 200,000 voters maybe will decide, right?
00:09:39.630 - 00:10:23.198, Speaker B: Like, you can't. It is a coin toss, and it will naturally move towards a coin toss. And so I think the relative probabilities are extreme. That's not a political position or a political view. That's just the nature of the electoral college and the nature of battleground states. And so with that in mind, I think that as you get closer to the election, I think you'll probably start to see crypto trade better, because part of the reason why crypto has come off is because of that Trump probability coming off. And so I do think that as you kind of approach the debates and the elections, kind of that upside risk to crypto has to be part of the distribution curve for folks.
00:10:23.198 - 00:11:06.280, Speaker B: And so if you're thinking about a Trump presidency as being BTC over 100k as time approaches the election, and if we start to see Trump's probability going back to more of a coin toss, that should be positive for bitcoin. In addition, I do think that being in a benign environment for risk assets, if you're not going to get these crazy four or 5% down days in the Nasdaq, and it's going to be that slow churn of earnings and buybacks and just folks dcaing into the market, then that should generally be good for crypto. And so, yeah, I'm watching the politics. It's going to be super important, and I think it's a lot closer than people think.
00:11:06.440 - 00:11:09.328, Speaker A: Bimna Dibi, my friend from Galaxy trading, thank you so much.
00:11:09.424 - 00:11:10.120, Speaker B: Pleasure for having me.
