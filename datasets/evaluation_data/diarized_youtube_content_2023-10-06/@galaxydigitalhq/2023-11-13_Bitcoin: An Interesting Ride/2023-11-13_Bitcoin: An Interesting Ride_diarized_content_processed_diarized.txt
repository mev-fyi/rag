00:00:00.240 - 00:00:31.762, Speaker A: It's been an interesting ride with bitcoin. We've basically been in the range since the actually we've straight up mostly bled higher. We're pretty firmly now in the high 34s or even the mid 35s since the gamma squeeze we talked about now two or even three weeks ago. I'm forgetting, I think maybe two weeks ago. It's just been higher lows the whole time but still struggling to break above 36. Do we have another leg higher in us before ETF announcement?
00:00:31.858 - 00:00:59.834, Speaker B: This kind of price action tells you that there are dip buyers. This kind of price action tells you that the pain trade is higher. I don't think there's been participation from the hedge fund community in a meaningful way and most folks are under allocated. Even the crypto native folks that you talk to that are crazy bullish. All the people that I'm in chats with and communicating with, nobody has had this on like oh I'm gung ho crazy bullish bitcoin. I'm going to max allocate to it.
