00:00:00.120 - 00:00:36.212, Speaker A: Start off the show, we're going to be talking about a pretty major decision that was made on the most recent Ethereum developer call. Developers agreed to include Max EB into the next Ethereum upgrade. Electra. So hats off to everybody who vied for this upgrade to get into the next ethereum to get into the next upgrade. Who vied for Max Ev to get into the next Ethereum upgrade. You know, we've talked about Maxie B. On the show before, and my listeners will know how supportive I am of this, quote, change.
00:00:36.212 - 00:00:52.164, Speaker A: So we'll talk a little bit about that decision. We'll talk a little bit, give a little bit of a summary for people who are new to the show just joining. We'll give a precursor on what Max EB is and talk a little bit more about what else is going, what else may or may not go into Elektra.
