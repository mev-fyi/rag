00:00:00.280 - 00:00:44.546, Speaker A: Only at a half a trillion, a trillion dollars and real liquidity, does any asset make sense for big portfolios, for the real big ones we have grown into? We're now big enough for anyone. We weren't when we were a $200 billion asset, we just weren't. Or $100 billion asset. But as a trillion dollar asset, it's now big enough for almost anyone. And so I think you're going to see, I would say, what's the difference between bitcoin and gold? They got the same macro story. And so I can talk about macro.
