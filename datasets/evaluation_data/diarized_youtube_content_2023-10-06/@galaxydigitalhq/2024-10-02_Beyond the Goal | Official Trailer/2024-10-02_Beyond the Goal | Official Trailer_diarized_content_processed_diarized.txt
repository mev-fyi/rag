00:00:05.400 - 00:00:32.005, Speaker A: To win the league, given where the team was last season, would be phenomenal. I don't think anyone expected us to be in this position. We wanted to compete this year, of course we did. But given that the club only avoided relegation last year due to other teams folding, to go and be pushing for promotion is incredible.

00:00:48.805 - 00:00:52.265, Speaker C: Yeah, you got to go, you got to go. Go.

00:00:55.245 - 00:01:13.645, Speaker A: Christ. Haringey. Oh, our first. Come on, hurry up and sit down, please. Bottom line it that ain't good enough. That's the bottom line. That is not good enough.
00:01:13.645 - 00:01:32.065, Speaker A: Said to you before the game, you have to work harder than them. You have to want it more than them. If any of you claim you've done that, you're watching a very different game to what we're watching. They want it more and they've worked harder than you. It's not us.
