00:00:08.280 - 00:00:12.769, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome back to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:12.857 - 00:00:13.873, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:14.009 - 00:00:32.945, Speaker A: So we had the. It's kind of a big week, although not a lot is really. I'm not seeing a lot of movement in markets necessarily, but we had the presidential debate last night, which I guess we could talk about briefly. And then obviously the big economic news is we have the CPI numbers for last month published today. What did they show?
00:00:33.285 - 00:01:44.857, Speaker B: Yeah, they showed a relatively strong rebound in owner's equivalent rent and in shelter, which drove the core CPI reading to come in at 0.28 versus expectations of 0.2%. The market really latched onto that in terms of deciding whether or not 25 basis point cut is more likely than a 50 basis point cut. So we saw that meeting reprice much closer to 25 basis points today as a function of this beat in core CPI and high level. I think what folks have been concerned with on the inflation side has been the past strength in services CPI which we had seen cooling. And so the fact that you had this rebound in shelter today kind of made folks pause a little bit. But in terms of what's driving the overall response function of the Fed, I would say that inflation data is probably the least important part of their mandate at the moment.
00:01:44.857 - 00:01:48.361, Speaker B: They're most focused on the employment side of things.
00:01:48.433 - 00:01:55.321, Speaker A: Yeah, and where do we stand on that at the moment? Whatever the latest data is. I mean was it ADP like 2 weeks ago or something like that?
00:01:55.353 - 00:02:42.555, Speaker B: Or we got non farm payrolls last week and that showed a modest decline in the pace of job growth, which was super important. And you're starting to see basically below neutral rate payroll growth. And so it's starting to get concerning. And you've also seen a meaningful uptick in the unemployment rate as well. And so you know, and then you had the revisions, you know, the 850,000 revisions from the prior month. And then in addition the last on from payrolls you revised lower the prior months, you know, by like 20, 30,000 jobs. And also if you look a little bit deeper, you know, job openings saw a huge decline.
00:02:42.555 - 00:03:12.645, Speaker B: You know, the other week they had, the past job opening numbers were also revised lower. And then digging a bit deeper in terms of where you're seeing strength and weakness in the labor market, the strength has been in things like government sector jobs and the weakness has been in private sector jobs. Not great, not great. In addition, you've had, if you look at the job opening data it's like job openings for white collar stuff and coding jobs.
00:03:13.835 - 00:03:16.655, Speaker A: I saw tech jobs falling off. Yeah.
00:03:17.315 - 00:03:55.491, Speaker B: And then if you really kind of want to analyze some of the initial jobless claim figures, I think folks are coming around to kind of a more nuanced appreciation of these figures from the sense that now when you lose your job, you've got a lot more options in the gig economy in terms of what you can do. So you get unemployed and all of a sudden you can probably pick up 20 hours at like 15 to 20 bucks an hour, doordash or Uber, whatever it may be. And so you see less people filing for unemployment benefits, but they're not real.
00:03:55.563 - 00:03:57.291, Speaker A: Strong longer term jobs.
00:03:57.363 - 00:04:44.273, Speaker B: And so if you look at other metrics like the underemployment rate, the U6 employment rate, those things are. I think that's almost at like 8% now. And so ultimately in terms of what the market's going to be looking for on go forward basis, they're going to want to know what the Fed is thinking on a go forward with respect to the job stuff and they're going to find out in the summary of economic projections that are going to be released during the September fomc. And so in theory, what you should see is their forecast for unemployment for the balance of 2024 and 2025 and 2026 to start creeping higher. And also you will get insight into where they think the rate path is going to be on go forward in terms of neutral rate and docs.
00:04:44.329 - 00:05:08.775, Speaker A: So it's the dual mandate we've now, the inflation is still present, it's still above target, but it's cooled pretty substantially over the year. But now unemployment is the question. The other part of their mandate to seek what full maximum employment, whatever the term is. And that's we're going to get a rate cut next week though from the FOMC though, is that. That's right. That's what everyone.
00:05:09.075 - 00:05:21.819, Speaker B: It's not like necessarily a good thing which like a lot of folks in crypto and in broader markets, they're like the Fed's cut and we can buy risk assets again. But you really have to focus on why they're cutting.
00:05:21.867 - 00:05:22.955, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.
00:05:22.995 - 00:05:25.907, Speaker B: They're cutting because the economy is losing momentum.
00:05:25.971 - 00:05:29.595, Speaker A: Right. Which is a bigger negative sign for assets, asset values.
00:05:29.635 - 00:05:49.597, Speaker B: Absolutely. Right. Right. You're talking about like S and P earnings growth that's expected to be, let's say 9% next year and for the big tech companies expect it to be like closer to 14. Right. And in 2025, you're also expecting a decent amount of growth in earnings. Right.
00:05:49.597 - 00:06:24.681, Speaker B: And so there's a lot of optimism baked into the equity markets. Right. And then on top of that, typically when you see unemployment rise, you typically get a bigger rise, known as the SOM rule. I don't know how to say it properly, but all of the things that we look at in terms of being good indicators of what's going to happen on a go forward with respect to employment are flashing warning signs. And so again, you walk through the example, guy goes from high paying job to a lower paying job or no job, he eats out less. There's a multiplier effect.
00:06:24.753 - 00:06:26.177, Speaker A: Spends less, buys fewer things.
00:06:26.241 - 00:06:32.125, Speaker B: Fewer things also becomes more indebted because credit card balances are through the roof.
00:06:32.205 - 00:06:32.413, Speaker A: They are.
00:06:32.429 - 00:06:58.015, Speaker B: Right now interest rates are really high. And so it becomes a lot more difficult to service that. And you fall into this debt trap. If asset prices start declining, they'll lead to further asset price depreciation. And so there's a lot of bad things that can be precipitated by downturn. And so when folks are like, oh, it's great that the Fed's cutting, that should be good for risk. Yeah, but not really.
00:06:58.095 - 00:06:58.455, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:58.535 - 00:07:52.333, Speaker B: And then the other thing to think about is that the historical kind of analogy with respect to rate cuts is a little bit different now from the sense that the Magnificent Seven companies and a ton of companies in the US used to hold or currently hold tons of cash balances. Right. Versus historically, companies used to not have that much cash on their balance sheets because they had more productive uses of it, et cetera, and they hadn't gotten so big. But now a lot of the Magnificent Seven tech companies, et cetera, they carry huge cash balances. When interest rates were rising, their net interest income was actually going up a lot. In theory, on the way down, their net interest income should also be going down. And so the classic rate cuts are coming.
00:07:52.333 - 00:08:25.297, Speaker B: So equity should do well. It doesn't necessarily hold. It's a lot more nuanced than that, especially when you've got so much baked in. Look at a five year chart of the NASDAQ or the S and p or a 10 year chart. Risk markets are at the dead highs. And so I think we're at the point in the cycle where one should be cautious about risk assets and should really look into why we're engaging in a cutting path and why the bond market is telling you that the Fed is going to be very aggressive over the next nine months.
00:08:25.401 - 00:09:02.873, Speaker A: Interesting. Well, we do have a monetary instrument that does not have a team of people meeting every month to adjust its inflation rate. You have to wonder is the sort of. I guess what I'm pivoting here to obviously is the Bitcoin. Is it when, if ever, is it now? It probably isn't yet. Now does Bitcoin transition to being something that is more of a fundamental asset and not a risk asset? I mean, that's sort of the question, right, for long term bitcoin investors, presumably it's not always a risk asset, right? I mean, risk assets have management execution risk. They have things like interest rate risk.
00:09:02.873 - 00:09:04.953, Speaker A: They have all these risks. That's what makes them risky.
00:09:05.009 - 00:09:10.055, Speaker B: I don't know if you'll ever get to a point where bitcoin. Bitcoin isn't a risk asset.
00:09:10.795 - 00:09:12.715, Speaker A: I mean, gold's not a risk asset, right?
00:09:12.835 - 00:09:38.693, Speaker B: It has some elements of that to it in terms of just looking at its performance, right? At the end of the day, it's an asset people own and people get impacted by how they feel. And in terms of how you run a portfolio, even in the depths of the financial crisis, gold is a great owner, but it still went down in 2008 because everything goes to correlation one and risk off events.
00:09:38.749 - 00:09:39.253, Speaker A: That's right.
00:09:39.349 - 00:10:18.849, Speaker B: And so you're never going to really avoid that. But I do think that it just will set higher and higher floors with respect to when risk sells off, et cetera. I do think that in theory folks aren't going to sell their bitcoin at certain levels. Right. And so ultimately I do think you're in the path of setting higher and higher floors in the price and ultimately you should start to go higher. And truly when I do think the bitcoin will have its moment again from a macro standpoint is when the money printing actually starts, when it really starts.
00:10:18.897 - 00:10:20.297, Speaker A: Not just some rate cuts, but not.
00:10:20.321 - 00:10:47.189, Speaker B: Some rate cuts, but it's like we're going back to balance sheet expansion. We're going to buy a ton of the debt that the US government issues by printing money. And so that's when you really are going to get that. Like what is money? If we could just print it out of thin air and buy stuff. And so when the market gets that sense that you're close to that kind of event is kind of when I think bitcoin will have it.
00:10:47.237 - 00:10:55.635, Speaker A: That's the macro bitcoin moment. Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Trading. As always my friend, thank you SA.
