00:00:07.280 - 00:00:12.334, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, BImnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:12.454 - 00:00:13.710, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:13.902 - 00:00:27.758, Speaker A: Always great to have you on galaxy brains. And it kind of an exciting week in macro. I guess I'm sounding like a broken record. It has. It continues to be exciting in the world of macroeconomics, I guess. You tell me. And I've been traveling, so I haven't been as close to it.
00:00:27.758 - 00:00:30.640, Speaker A: But the big news was what? A hot CPI print.
00:00:30.822 - 00:01:14.044, Speaker B: Yes, we got a very strong CPI number today. It printed 0.4 month on month. And there's lots of details in the report that suggests that inflation is likely creeping higher and that the data that we saw in January and February weren't aberrations. But they are part of a broad theme of inflation being higher than what folks expected. The areas where we saw a reasonable amount of strength that I thought were notable were things like car insurance and healthcare costs. Those things are moving up higher pretty quickly.
00:01:14.044 - 00:01:23.056, Speaker B: And all of a sudden, it used to be that people would make the argument that the three month run rate for inflation or the six month run rate for inflation is below target.
00:01:23.200 - 00:01:23.456, Speaker A: Now.
00:01:23.480 - 00:02:20.754, Speaker B: It's well above. And when you look at things like services, inflation, ex housing, those figures are well above 4% and now are in areas where the Fed should feel uncomfortable about cutting. And so given the big beat and the details of the beat, the market has started to price out a lot of cuts for this year. Two years, treasuries were off by 22, 23 basis points. So almost a full cut getting baked out of that two year point. And, yeah, the bright spots to it, I would say, are the components that showed the most strength aren't necessarily going to show up in PCE. I think the healthcare stuff, for example, doesn't get included in PCE.
00:02:20.754 - 00:03:02.732, Speaker B: There's an argument to be made that depending on how PPI comes out, this might not impact PCE as much. But it's really hard to ignore these CPI figures. They're well above the Fed's target. It does not indicate that inflation is slowing. It looks like it's reaccelerating. The job market is still hot and fits the narrative of just, you know, a hot economy that we've had over the past couple of months. And so I think there's a lot of, you know, cold water being thrown onto Powell's arguments for why he wanted to cut three times and why the Fed officials had three cuts in their, you know, dot projections.
00:03:02.868 - 00:03:27.360, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw, even I saw Mike Novogratz had tweeted he didn't see any good reason to cut rates at this point. No, no. No reason at all. You, I gotta hand it to you, Bimnett. You've been saying this at this point for months, basically that, that there's no real reason to cut, that you don't feel the need to cut here, that the economy is doing well without the cuts. We don't need the cuts. And that inflation looked pretty sticky.
00:03:27.360 - 00:03:39.984, Speaker A: Markets weren't very pleased with that number, though, right? Probably. I mean, it makes sense if you're repricing now, fewer cuts. What do we have now? What's the expectation now for end of the year number of cuts? Two?
00:03:40.104 - 00:03:42.632, Speaker B: A little. No, it's actually under two now.
00:03:42.728 - 00:03:43.404, Speaker A: Wow.
00:03:43.804 - 00:03:46.388, Speaker B: Closer to like, you know, one and a half. One.
00:03:46.476 - 00:03:50.068, Speaker A: You know, so basically it's like, it's like maybe one is kind of what?
00:03:50.196 - 00:04:34.820, Speaker B: Maybe there's a one to two. One to two is kind of the established, you know, range now. And you've seen a bunch of, you know, sell side banks reduce their forecast from three cuts to two already on the year. You know, there are certain things that, you know, like, I'll give you an idea about, like, how hard it is to kind of, you know, really get a grasp on the data. So we had the small business survey that came out yesterday, and the employment component was super soft. And typically, you know, small business employment leads the broader unemployment rate for the economy because, you know, small businesses can move faster than big institutions, et cetera, et cetera. So the labor market for small business is looking awful.
00:04:34.820 - 00:05:12.194, Speaker B: However, then you start looking at their expectations with respect to raising prices. And the price increase component was really strong. And so we're seeing a situation where even if the hiring and stuff is slowing a little bit or it might slow, like, the price pressures are still there. And then on top of that, you have a commodity complex that's trading incredibly well. Part of it is a function of oil going bid on some of these Mideast headlines. Some of it's a function of the stimulus efforts in China. And so you're seeing things like copper trade.
00:05:12.194 - 00:06:10.644, Speaker B: Well, but at the end of the day, if gas prices are higher, that is bad for inflation. Now, the flip side to all of this stuff is that inflation, at least for a large portion of the population, is actually a tax, right? So if you're telling me that your car insurance premium is up 25% this year, right, and you're paying $100 a month now, it's 125, like that $25 is essentially a tax on you. And we know that incomes aren't keeping up with a 25% increase. And so more and more, given where savings are in the economy, people aren't. The savings rate isn't like COVID levels, 20, 30% anymore. People are net spending, not net saving anymore. And so you've seen excess savings come down and you're now seeing price for a lot of everyday goods go up.
00:06:10.644 - 00:06:54.418, Speaker B: And so that's going to eat into the consumer a lot. And I would say that folks have already adjusted a lot of their behaviors because of these price increases. I'll give you an example. If you were going out to eat with your family three to four times a week when prices were reasonable, let's say you've already cut that down to two to three or once a week or once a month. But now you're grocery shopping more. But now your grocery prices are starting to increase more and it's like, well, then there's the people that went from shopping at high end grocers to mid tier grocers. And so that behavioral shift in the economy has already happened.
00:06:54.418 - 00:07:55.414, Speaker B: And so when you start to see inflation tick higher again with this low savings base, it makes you think that the consumer is really going to slow down. And that's precisely, precisely what you are getting out of us companies that are consumer oriented and how those consumer discretionary companies are trading and the guidance that they're giving is that the US consumer is slowing down and this inflation is likely not going to help. I feel like Powell is stuck between a rock and a hard place where there's so many conflicting pieces of evidence and there's not really like, you should do this with like a high level of confidence. And so I'm sitting here being like, Powell has a hard job. Now, at the same time, what are the best things to hedge Powell's jobs? It's still gold, it's still silver, it's still bitcoin. It's, you know, real world assets that protect purchasing power.
00:07:55.534 - 00:08:24.340, Speaker A: And let's talk about bitcoin real quick. Just the near term outlook. You know, we had run as low as what, like 62 ish a couple of weeks ago. Then we, we made it up to the 72k range earlier this week, actually, I think was that not yesterday but the day before? So Monday and then on this, on this news, along with other stuff. Right. Bitcoin down, you know, back in the 67, 68 range. Do we care? Is this just kind of noise at this point? Like bitcoin is still in that range.
00:08:24.412 - 00:09:14.414, Speaker B: Already rallied from that, that morning sell off. I mean, we're back like 69, like 200 right now, which tells you that it's a dangerous thing to short. And you've seen a little bit of a short covering rally today in the afternoon. And broadly speaking, this is a healthy bullish consolidation. Prices need to calm down and it gives people more confidence that the market is mature and it flushes out the weak hands. The guys that are just in there for a couple percent here and there, and they can't hold bags, they get chopped out of the market. And then you're left with a situation where market starts going up and the people holding it are not really sellers until much higher levels.
00:09:14.414 - 00:10:04.944, Speaker B: And so the way I'm looking at it from a chart perspective and just from a general sentiment perspective is that this is just choppy. This is consolidation. The fundamentals are still there. I think anybody in bitcoin, I don't really know many people that are real believers in bitcoin that are selling it and the equity folks that are picking it up and retirement accounts, these are buy and hold types, people that have been conditioned to buy and hold every asset in their accounts for a really long time. You know, I think the setup still there and then you've got the catalysts in terms of the havening coming up as well. Who knows how crypto will trade around that. But I'll say high level, I'm very comfortable holding bitcoin right now.
00:10:04.944 - 00:10:15.032, Speaker B: And the best thing to do with holding an asset like bitcoin is just not traded around too much because you never know when you're going to get those seven 8910 percent days.
00:10:15.128 - 00:10:22.668, Speaker A: Yeah, we've done those who've done that work and shown that it's like, you know, 80% of the gains were on like five days in one year, ten days.
00:10:22.716 - 00:10:38.420, Speaker B: Right. So, yeah, and if you miss those days, it's, it's almost impossible to match the performance of the bitcoin. And so, you know, I would just generally say that, you know, stay long and strong, stick with the trend and protect your purchasing power.
00:10:38.492 - 00:10:45.904, Speaker A: Ppp push and Pm, I love it. My friend Bimnet from galaxy trading, thanks so much. Pleasure.
