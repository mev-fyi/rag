00:00:08.440 - 00:00:13.753, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:13.809 - 00:00:14.885, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:15.905 - 00:00:50.575, Speaker A: It's always great to have you on and it's been kind of an exciting week. I mean significant moves in the crypto markets, frankly in the equity markets also just at a high level. Bitcoin down from about 66k to 615 as we talk. Now, before we get specifically to that, let's talk a little bit of the macro. I saw there was a slightly better than expected ADP jobs number, but still some dovish Fed speak. I don't know what's your take on the sort of jobs inflation Fed stuff at the moment?
00:00:50.695 - 00:01:41.373, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think high level. My framework for, for monetary policy for the next six months is that the Fed wants to get to neutral. Neutral is around, let's say three to three and a half percent. And so the question is how quickly do they get to neutral? And in terms of what are the data points that are really going to drive the decision making between 25 and 50 over, over the next handful of meetings. And so in terms of the data that we've recently gotten, you know, it's a little bit stronger than one, than what would I think justify a 50bp sort of cut at the next meeting. ADP today came in at 143,000 jobs. The wage figures there were good.
00:01:41.373 - 00:02:35.613, Speaker B: The sector breakdowns were constructive. You had revisions higher for the the past month as well. For August you also had pretty strong job openings data in terms of jolts that surprised to the upside and were also revised higher. Initial jobless claims have been stronger or smaller, so stronger than expected. And so in terms of concerns about the labor market data, they haven't really materialized too much as of yet. There is stuff in the anecdotal data in terms of the consumer confidence stuff in terms of quit sleeves and hard to hire things of that nature. And there are Fed members that have spoken about relying more on anecdotal data as well.
00:02:35.613 - 00:03:16.085, Speaker B: So it's a little bit of a mixed bag on the job side. But I'm kind of in the camp of, you know, 25 basis points for the next meeting. And I think that's kind of what Powell was trying to indicate, you know, on Monday. And so, you know, the rate market had a little bit of a reaction to hawkish Powell comments on Monday. And I think that's entirely appropriate, I think for the next meeting. You've got about 33, 34 basis points priced for that meeting. So still kind of like close to that midway point between you know, 50 and 25.
00:03:16.085 - 00:03:57.895, Speaker B: You know, I think the jobs data on Friday is going to be super important. Non farm payrolls, you know, the unemployment rate, average hourly earnings. That's going to be kind of the last set of clean data you're going to get before you know, the next set of data is kind of a little bit skewed by the hurricane impacts. So high level I think the market's most concerned about labor market dynamics, less concerned about inflation stuff because we've moved closer to target and forward expectations of inflation have come down. So you really got to pay attention to non farm payrolls on Friday and that's going to kind of set the tone for the rest of. Got it.
00:03:58.395 - 00:04:43.921, Speaker A: Let's talk about the hurricane a little bit actually. Terrible devastation and parts of Georgia, South Carolina, the North Carolina mountains, Tennessee. You know, obviously these things have a big impact on, you know, local and regional economies and then that can spill into the broader economy. But one, one item I wanted to just highlight which is the quartz production in Spruce Pine, North Carolina. This is one of the a lot of AI and semi, you know, followers, hobby horses. Apparently an enormous percentage of the chip grade quarantine quartz is produced from one area that was severely impacted. You know, we don't know exactly how bad the impact on Quartz Corporation or Sibelco, which are those two companies are.
00:04:43.921 - 00:04:59.907, Speaker A: I don't think they've said much but that whole region devastated. Let's say that it is bad. Do you. Is there a longer term supply chain ripple effect or just broadly how will the hurricane affect the macro situation in.
00:04:59.931 - 00:06:00.061, Speaker B: Terms of the broad implications? I think JP Morgan put out some stuff earlier this week that indicated that there's about a $5 billion per day impact as a function of the hurricane. That's pretty material. 10 days, $50 billion worth of economic output that just doesn't happen. That's the ballpark we're in right now. It's not meaningful enough to really drive kind of Fed policy or the broader market. But in terms of specific to semis, it's again highlights how fragile the supply chain is with this stuff. And so I think that's just going to lead to delays in chip deliveries and that's going to impact folks that are actively in the race to get the best output out of AI.
00:06:00.133 - 00:06:00.437, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:00.501 - 00:07:13.315, Speaker B: And so I think it just delays things a little bit and it makes folks kind of really hone in on their supply chains and try to figure out where their vulnerabilities are and how they can address them. And high level, it speaks to kind of what's been happening over the past couple of years since COVID since kind of the trade war with China, which is, you know, there's been an active, ongoing effort to reshore supply chains or to bring them, you know, closer instead of, you know, in the Far east to, you know, make them more, you know, North America based. And, and that's been continuing for, for the past, you know, couple of years and really accelerated after Covid. And, you know, I think that brings to light, you know, another topic, you know, we should kind of talk about, which is the election, which is getting closer and closer. And as you can clearly see as a function, you know, from, from the debate last night, there is a big focus on, from the Trump administration about reshoring jobs and kind of, you know, slapping tariffs on, you know, foreign imports and stuff. And so I do think that it's going to be a theme that continues to play out over the next couple of months and you know, potentially, potentially.
00:07:13.355 - 00:08:06.011, Speaker A: After, after the election, let's continue that discussion a little bit about onshoring and China because for the first time since 1977, the longshoremen are striking the International Longshoremen's Association. So this is the union that represents longshoremen. Those are the people that load and unload cargo on and off of ships at ports, apparently from Texas all the way to Maine. So about half the countries, the entire east coast, sort of eastern part, not even east coast, the whole eastern half of the American main mainland continent are on strike. They asked President Biden, some journalists, whether he would do some kind of intervention. He said he doesn't believe in Taft Hartley. That's the federal law that limits the power of unions to strike and grants the federal government some power to stop them and if it comes to national security.
00:08:06.011 - 00:08:16.299, Speaker A: So it doesn't seem like there'll be some sort of overarching intervention here that has to be inflationary. Right. I mean, we're talking about potentially a major disruption.
00:08:16.427 - 00:08:35.395, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I think you're spot on. But what I'd like to highlight specifically is that even if the labor market starts to soften, there are patches of the labor market that are uniquely positioned to the extent that they still have tremendous pricing power.
00:08:35.555 - 00:08:36.211, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:36.363 - 00:08:44.095, Speaker B: I'll give you an example. Boeing, last week they announced 30% increases for their union workers.
00:08:44.255 - 00:08:44.815, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:44.935 - 00:09:31.165, Speaker B: That's a big, big increase. And realistically, why did Boeing do it? Because they had no better alternatives. And so to the extent that union labor can stay organized and it's sort of in an area that's highly specialized in terms of things that they're actually doing. I think labor can take the upper hand, but you're totally spot on. That will lead to pockets of wage growth. And looking at some of the figures from the ADP report alone, I think they're talking about for the month of September, you had year on year labor growth of 4 and a half, 4.6% ish.
00:09:31.165 - 00:10:00.981, Speaker B: And so that's above inflation. And it shows that there's still pockets of the labor market that are really tight. And you're talking about an unemployment rate that's around 4, 3. That's still a very structurally tight labor market. You're talking about a labor market that has 8 million job openings. Right. And so it's, you know, even though, you know, you're starting to see like, you know, information technology jobs, like, on the decline, like the labor market's still at a reasonable place.
00:10:00.981 - 00:10:29.839, Speaker B: Right. If I told you in 2016 that your unemployment rate was 4.3%, you'd be like, oh, that's great, you're at full employment. And so, you know, I think you're spot on that the labor market's not as bad as people think. And there are pockets that have material pricing pressure. And that is only going to exacerbate, you know, kind of the price dynamics that the Fed's concerned, but not just.
00:10:29.887 - 00:11:04.251, Speaker A: On the wage side. If we think that longshoremen are not going to the ports to unload cargo, if this strike lasts any amount of, like, material time, like if this isn't resolved in the next week, we're going to see significant disruptions for consumers across the Eastern seaboarder of the whole country. Right. No, I mean anything that gets produced overseas basically is going to be sitting at ports. You're going to have, you know, perishables perishing in their containers. It's a, it's a, it could become a dire situation leading right into the election. Let, let's, let's, let's continue on though.
00:11:04.251 - 00:11:39.309, Speaker A: There's a lot actually that's been happening in sort of macro and geopolitics. Just last night, the Iranians struck Israel with, with ballistic missiles, I should say it looked like some of them hit. Israel at the time that we're speaking, has vowed to retaliate. And I don't think at the, you know, we're recording on around noon on, on Wednesday, October 2nd. We haven't seen, I don't think what that retaliation has been, but what's the risk here to either commodity markets or also just general like, you know, if this spirals and escalates further, you know, what's the risk to markets?
00:11:39.437 - 00:12:36.009, Speaker B: Yeah, it's pretty material anytime you have missiles flying. Yeah, but yeah, I mean, initially folks, you know, start to be very concerned about, you know, energy markets, oil markets, because it's a conflict in the Middle east, largest oil producing region in the world. However, I do think that the biggest oil producers have indicated that they're more open to having some supply in the market, particularly Saudi Arabia. And so even with this conflict, you're talking about WTI crude trading at $72 a barrel, it's barely moved higher. And so even though the market has started to price in some of some of these tail outcomes, it hasn't led to material repricing of oil higher. But that is kind of the main concern as supply chains disrupting routes where oil is shipped, et cetera. So that's a big concern.
00:12:36.009 - 00:13:23.295, Speaker B: And then the question is if Iran and Israel are going head to head, what other nations get involved, what are the kind of, you know, other externalities that come from that, who else joins them, etc. And that's really tough to predict. And so high level, you know, I think what the market needs to do is kind of price in a wider distribution of outcomes, particularly in the tail sort of scenarios. And so that's kind of what the market's being forced to do right now. And you know, when you talk about increased uncertainty and war, naturally folks think about gold. And gold has been trading really well. It was up a ton yesterday basically essentially at all time highs still.
00:13:23.295 - 00:14:21.985, Speaker B: And so that's been a popular trade that's only likely going to continue to do better if these tail outcomes become more realistic and super interesting. This weekend I was just reading a Fortune article about, you know, the gold buying that's still happening at Costco. You know, you're talking about 100, $200 million a month. And I think they're running into supply issues at Costco in terms of being sold out of some of the gold in certain stores. And so like it's really a big structural theme that's happening that's being supported by, you know, kind of the macro environment with all of these central banks that are cutting right now. You know, you've got RBNZ cutting 50, you've got, you know, RBA that's going to cut 50, you've got Europe in a recession, you got Canada that's cutting, you've got the US Cutting. And so, you know, there's this whole coalescing of macro that is generally supportive of things like gold.
00:14:21.985 - 00:15:12.539, Speaker B: But yeah, the other kind of, you know, important implication is if you do go down the path of war and more nations getting involved, which I don't think is likely, but that tends to be inflationary and not deflationary. And so that's something that the mark central bankers are going to have to weigh. But also it's like, wait, risk sentiment is going to be bad. And so do you really want to be maintaining more hawkish policy than necessary, more restrictive policy than necessary when folks are kind of panicked a little bit? And so that's kind of the weird dynamic that these central bankers are in where, you know, they want to cut. But Boars tends to be inflationary and inflation is really what you're trying to combat. And so, yeah, it's a really tough landscape. Right.
00:15:12.587 - 00:15:27.940, Speaker A: All right, last thing, I guess it's apropos with gold being up. Bitcoin has been down this week. We opened the week at like 65, 66K. As I said at the top, we're trading around 61, 5. That decline started 62.
00:15:28.065 - 00:15:28.955, Speaker B: 62. Don't.
00:15:29.035 - 00:15:48.295, Speaker A: I had to close Bloomberg so that I could record this. My computer needed the memory back. Great. So we're down around 62. But that decline happened before the Iran strike, before the vice presidential debate. I don't know in your mind what drove that and what's your outlook on bitcoin in the near term?
00:15:49.235 - 00:16:56.155, Speaker B: Yeah, no, so I think what drove it is just that bitcoin's been very range bound basically over the past three, four, five months and you got to the top end of the range and a bunch of sellers came in. And so the folks that added leverage, let's say in the low 60s, et cetera, were taking profit. And that's kind of what you saw in terms of bitcoin open interest reduction. I think oise come off about 2 billion from the highs. If you look at kind of some of the alts, they've come down a tremendous amount as well. And so I do think that, you know, the market might have just gotten a little ahead of itself in terms of pricing in, you know, the macro backdrop, the, you know, election coming up, et cetera, in the face of a ton of supply, in the alt market, in the face of, you know, geopolitical uncertainty and kind of the macro uncertainty a little bit. And so, you know, I think it's just folks got a little over their skis, myself included.
00:16:56.155 - 00:17:28.336, Speaker B: And you know, you just, you just had a correction back to the kind of bottom end of the range. But it's still a healthy market. You know, the S and P and the Nasdaq are still very close to all time highs. And you know, generally like the macro backdrop is pretty good. And so like I don't see the decline extending too much. It's kind of my opinion. And then in terms of like what you kind of have to price for the next like six weeks, like you have to price in a presidential election with a candidate that's very pro bitcoin, Right.
00:17:28.336 - 00:17:40.484, Speaker B: And so if you're pricing a 50, 50 outcome going into that, right, what's your bitcoin price during a Trump administration? Like where, where do you, where do you put that expected value if you're putting it north of all time highs.
00:17:40.904 - 00:17:41.624, Speaker C: Right.
00:17:41.784 - 00:18:24.585, Speaker B: And you know, a common administration isn't going to be that bad for crypto either. Like I think as you get closer to the election basically that you just are going to start to see that this grind higher. And what I'd also like to highlight is that you've just had so much selling happen over the past handful of months. You had the German government, you had the GOX claims, you had sort of natural profit takers, et cetera. And so like there's been a ton of supply that's been absorbed by the market. And then when you think about it in terms of like what are the next potential catalysts on a go forward, right, it's the election, it's FTX distributions, these are all not supply events.
00:18:24.705 - 00:18:25.177, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:25.281 - 00:18:55.139, Speaker B: And so I think just from a simple supply demand dynamic, it does look pretty favorable right now for crypto, for bitcoin at least. But I'm still very concerned with kind of the alt market, particularly some of the bigger VC coins. I just don't know where the interest to buy some of this stuff is going to come from, particularly given the supply schedule of a lot of tokens.
00:18:55.227 - 00:18:58.971, Speaker A: All right, my friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Trading, as always, thank you so much.
00:18:59.123 - 00:18:59.755, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
