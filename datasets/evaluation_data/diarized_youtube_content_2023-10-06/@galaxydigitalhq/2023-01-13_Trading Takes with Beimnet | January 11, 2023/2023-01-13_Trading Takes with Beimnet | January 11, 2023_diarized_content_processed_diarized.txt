00:00:06.880 - 00:00:11.334, Speaker A: Let's go to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Digital trading. Bimnet, good to see you, man.
00:00:11.414 - 00:00:13.354, Speaker B: Thanks for having me on, as always.
00:00:14.134 - 00:00:31.684, Speaker A: I guess markets have been, I mean, in crypto markets where I, you know, where I start my day, usually we've seen a sort of a grind higher, a slow grind higher over the last couple days that has been, you know, I think, welcomed by the market, although I wouldn't say it's been super dramatic. Why?
00:00:32.184 - 00:00:41.684, Speaker B: Yeah, honestly, it comes back down to memes. There was this meme project on Solana that launched about a couple weeks ago called Bonk Bonk.
00:00:42.424 - 00:00:43.720, Speaker A: I have to say, I love the name.
00:00:43.792 - 00:01:02.824, Speaker B: Oh, it's great. And there's a dog on the graphic. Yeah. So people liked it. Created enthusiasm amongst the soul community. The reason why there was so much enthusiasm is because it started to rally a lot, and it rallied because it's a meme project, and there's a lot of zeros before. After the decimal point.
00:01:02.904 - 00:01:08.544, Speaker A: Yeah. You've told me about the, like from such a low basis, right. That this. What's the term that you like to use?
00:01:08.584 - 00:01:09.120, Speaker B: Base effect.
00:01:09.192 - 00:01:15.456, Speaker A: Base effect. The base effect really at play here, too. I mean, a lot of it was down dramatically after FTX.
00:01:15.600 - 00:01:24.680, Speaker B: Exactly. I mean, just the easiest example, let's say something goes from, you know, one hundred dollars to one dollar. That's a 99% move. But if it goes from one dollar.
00:01:24.712 - 00:01:26.816, Speaker A: To two dollars afterwards, that's 100% up.
00:01:26.840 - 00:01:56.724, Speaker B: That's 100% up. Yeah. And so with a lot of crypto, there's a tremendous amount of base effects at play. And so when you had a retail phenomenon like Bonk come out and you had a heavy, short basin in a name like Solana, where funding was really negative, it tends to cause squeezes, because it's like, okay, I have a $20 million short on. It goes from eight dollars to twelve dollars. I've just lost $10 million out of thin air.
00:01:57.664 - 00:02:00.536, Speaker A: So it feels like a small move in sole, historically.
00:02:00.600 - 00:02:04.208, Speaker B: I mean, the thing was at 200 a year ago. If it goes from eight to twelve.
00:02:04.296 - 00:02:05.672, Speaker A: That'S not a big deal, but it's.
00:02:05.688 - 00:02:26.728, Speaker B: A 50% move, 50% move. And so there's a lot of base effects at play here, particularly in the alts. And so what you've had happen over the past week is anything where people are short, especially stuff where base effects are very relevant, that stuff got squeezed and led to forced liquidations during periods of low liquidity, and that broadly caused.
00:02:26.816 - 00:02:32.484, Speaker A: The market to go back and buy back their shit. And if they're physically short, a classic short squeeze.
00:02:33.944 - 00:02:35.288, Speaker B: So it doesn't feel fundamental.
00:02:35.376 - 00:02:53.624, Speaker A: But fair enough. Fair enough. The bon. But you know the fundamental. Well, hold on. First on bonk, actually kind of an interesting project in this way, that I'll say, which is, this is a meme coin, but it was airdropped to NFT holders on Solana. The team, I guess, had an allocation for themselves, but they burned it.
00:02:53.624 - 00:03:14.314, Speaker A: Provably, yes. So it becomes a fair launch dog meme coin. That rallied some excitement, at least to use the chain. Right. You'd go out on chain and get it or whatever, and you could see this in on chain data on Solana. There was a lot of activity around this at a time when they desperately needed some hopium. Yeah, some hopium.
00:03:14.314 - 00:03:39.948, Speaker A: But really, some will say, what can you do with Bonk? Nothing. It's useless. And this has been the argument from some web3 investors that I know, where they say, but the token itself can create, even if it's only a token. Think about the word token literally means, like, a placeholder. Right. Even if that's all it is, it can be used to incentivize and energize a community, which is interesting. It appears to have been what had happened here.
00:03:40.126 - 00:03:48.384, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I mean, it's not gonna energize smart money. It's not gonna energize, like, large pools of capital to move into the space.
00:03:48.424 - 00:04:00.048, Speaker A: And when the knockoffs come out, like bink, bonk, bonk, bonk, they're not gonna do anything. But it's not a bullet. You can fire that often as a community to. But there was a lot of activity there. I think that's.
00:04:00.096 - 00:04:01.520, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, that was the catalyst.
00:04:01.552 - 00:04:08.604, Speaker A: And then the fundamentals, with the lack of. For sellers in other assets, like bitcoin and stuff, I mean, it's.
00:04:09.314 - 00:04:10.010, Speaker B: Yeah, where is.
00:04:10.042 - 00:04:11.214, Speaker A: Where is the pain trade?
00:04:11.794 - 00:04:12.450, Speaker B: It's higher.
00:04:12.522 - 00:04:13.034, Speaker A: It's higher.
00:04:13.114 - 00:04:45.324, Speaker B: It's higher, for sure. I think there's been a lot of de risking that's happened. People have gotten positions down to their bare bones, essentially. Most crypto native folks that I talk to that deploy capital in this space have been very cautious and defensively positioned. That's the same for basically all risk assets, for the most part. And so the pain trade's definitely higher. I mean, if you just think about it, like, if ETH in the first ten days of the year is up 10%, right.
00:04:45.324 - 00:05:28.936, Speaker B: There's probably a lot of guys that don't have it on in size and their investors are going to be like, okay, eats up 12% in ten days of the year. You're only up two. Like, what's going on? And so there's some of that at play. But broadly speaking, I think the macro backdrop has been fairly constructive to start the year. Last week we had the soft ISM figures that caused the market to rally. The soft average hourly earnings figures. The macro backdrop has been, okay, then if you think about what crypto was doing to start the year, there was so much bad news that came out to start the year.
00:05:28.936 - 00:05:36.066, Speaker B: There's the OCC stuff, the Voyager binance investigation. I mean, it was literally like endless.
00:05:36.170 - 00:05:38.322, Speaker A: The drip, drip on FTX and stuff.
00:05:38.378 - 00:05:53.338, Speaker B: Et cetera, and the market couldn't go down. Right, right. It tells you seller exhaustion. Right. And so the moment you had any bit of good in the. In the space that caused, you know, short liquidations and prices to rally, et cetera. Yeah.
00:05:53.386 - 00:06:08.834, Speaker A: I mean, I've been saying this, that if you're not. When you talk about how it couldn't go down. Right. These things have a large and dedicated group of people that believe in them, own them, want to build on them, use them, and at some point they're.
00:06:08.954 - 00:06:09.834, Speaker B: There is a floor.
00:06:09.914 - 00:06:17.930, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a floor. And I've said for a long time that there's a cult of decentralization. That's part of what is driving this is a social movement.
00:06:18.042 - 00:06:18.778, Speaker B: No, absolutely.
00:06:18.826 - 00:06:28.574, Speaker A: And there are some movements inside it, obviously, with different goals and roadmaps, but this is broadly more than simply a technology or an asset.
00:06:29.034 - 00:07:00.374, Speaker B: I mean, I think every single investor or person that thinks about this space in a critical way is definitely focused on that. I mean, you just think about the events of the year. The dollar was basically used as a weapon this year, right. They shut off all the oligarchs, the financials for all the russian banks, and the Chinese are looking at that and being like, okay, well, we have to diversify, et cetera, basically everybody. Right, right.
00:07:00.534 - 00:07:05.670, Speaker A: And they've all been, by the way, all the global central banks have been buying gold, stacking gold, a couple.
00:07:05.742 - 00:07:23.914, Speaker B: Yes, they have been. And I think that's totally reasonable. But I tell you that if they already had bitcoin on their balance sheet, they'd be stacking bitcoin. It's just. Cause, like, they have gold, they have gold. And it's also, the Chinese are a big driver of it, and they're obviously not, you know, pro decentralization. Right.
00:07:23.914 - 00:08:01.200, Speaker B: And so, you know, like, there's a lot of folks thinking very critically about money, the decentralization of it. And ultimately, I do think that puts a floor on bitcoin, right? If you're some saudi billionaire or some rich guy, you're constantly afraid of governments taking your money, you not having paid your taxes, et cetera. If you're a sovereign state, you're worried about sanctions and sanctions, geopolitics, all of that. There is a real place for decentralized money.
00:08:01.272 - 00:08:04.808, Speaker A: Yeah, non sovereign, sound money is a use case.
00:08:04.976 - 00:08:52.116, Speaker B: And the bigger it is and the more liquid, the more credibility it has, it becomes self fulfilling, et cetera. And I also think that one of the reasons when bitcoin was taking off and one of the properties of money that you like a lot is stable value, right? The longer that bitcoin can hover around 17,000, 18,000, whatever, and hold its value, the more constructive the argument is. And that's what you want in money anyway. It's something that stores value. Well, I think in prior periods in the market, it's traded like a very speculative asset, and that's totally fine. I mean, just even think about the dollar. There were points where dollar yen had moved 30% in a year and bitcoin moving down 65%.
00:08:52.116 - 00:09:48.300, Speaker B: Isn't that crazy in the context of things? Taking a step back, the one lesson that I would give folks about regular currencies and g ten fx in general, which are ten of the most prominent currencies out there, and throw in dollar China and a couple other ems. But currencies are historically one of the biggest mean reverting assets on the planet. They will swing up and down in value. But you take a look at the 30 year chart of some of these currencies, they're right back to where they were 15 years ago. The ranges for currencies have already been established, except em, that just dollar em, some stuff goes crazy, goes up a lot, et cetera. But in the current world, I think it's fairly reasonable to expect currencies to be mean, reverting for a while. And once you have critical mass in bitcoin, it's gonna behave that way, is what I'm thinking.
00:09:48.300 - 00:10:15.566, Speaker B: In the long run, 510 years down the line. So bitcoin back to 30k in two years. So easy. If you establish a range of 30 to 60, that wouldn't be that crazy either. And so in a year where you've moved 65%, and in a year where inflation is going the other way, now, most likely we can get into that a little bit later, but we're probably going to see a negative month on month print this month.
00:10:15.630 - 00:10:22.288, Speaker A: So that's tomorrow recording on Wednesday. Tomorrow CPI is published and then this comes out Friday. So hello, Friday.
00:10:22.486 - 00:10:48.300, Speaker B: But yeah, so you're having dollar weaken this to start the year. Yields move lower, stocks move higher. There's been an unwind of what was happening last year. And so I think it's totally fair to make a prediction that you'll see a little bit of reversal in bitcoin as well. In that kind of context, if the dollar sells off by ten to 15%, you should see some feedback into bitcoin.
00:10:48.372 - 00:10:51.904, Speaker A: So CPI tomorrow, what are we expecting here?
00:10:52.634 - 00:11:15.194, Speaker B: It's very interesting. CPI, there are a couple of things that matter about CPI. There's a lot of things. But in terms of what I'm focused on as a trader is a couple of things. One, where expectations are not just the number, if it comes in above expectations versus lower than expectations, that's going to.
00:11:15.234 - 00:11:16.410, Speaker A: That'S most of the ballgame, right?
00:11:16.442 - 00:11:18.458, Speaker B: That's the ballgame for the move on the day.
00:11:18.506 - 00:11:19.596, Speaker A: Yeah, for the on the day movie.
00:11:19.690 - 00:11:38.124, Speaker B: And so what's been happening is that a bunch of sell side institutions have been forecasting a lower number than what the economists were forecasting officially on Bloomberg. And so you've seen the Bloomberg month on month headline number go from zero to neg one.
00:11:39.304 - 00:11:45.024, Speaker A: I see. So now the Bloomberg, the expectation is softer, softer.
00:11:45.184 - 00:11:59.400, Speaker B: So expectations have been moving lower over the past week. And I think that's totally reasonable given the data set we have. One of the things is just gas prices again. They've been moving down November and December. That's a huge one.
00:11:59.472 - 00:12:03.680, Speaker A: You can see on the chevron or whatever sign as you drive by.
00:12:03.752 - 00:12:04.552, Speaker B: Yep, absolutely.
00:12:04.648 - 00:12:19.776, Speaker A: And you drive by every day and you notice that it goes lower. I mean, that's something everyone, that makes everyone, that's actually one. It's like, that is one of the really interesting. Inflation is so driven by personal behavior, right? Like if people think things are expensive, they might buy less.
00:12:19.840 - 00:12:23.592, Speaker B: I mean, expectations for inflation are just as important as inflation.
00:12:23.688 - 00:12:34.160, Speaker A: And this is a billboard that people all around the country see every day. That is their own personal check mark or where they can follow inflation, quote unquote, as gas gets cheaper.
00:12:34.352 - 00:13:15.104, Speaker B: That is a feedback loop into tons of other things and also expectations of where people think inflation is going to be. But in my head, the way I think about inflation is it comes down to a handful of things, right? Rents, owners, equivalent rent. The Fed has recently published a paper about how CPI right now is sort of lagged in terms of how it looks at rents and they have a new index. I forgot what it's called, but essentially it's already suggesting a slowdown in rents. And home prices have obviously sort of topped out and are moving in the right direction. So I think housing and rent, you're probably safe in that it's headed in the right direction.
00:13:15.144 - 00:13:18.124, Speaker A: And that isn't something that causes CPI to go higher.
00:13:18.624 - 00:14:03.434, Speaker B: It could, but it won't be as relevant because you know that it's backward looking and forward looking and more high frequency sort of data points suggest that it's constructive. Right. And then you have sort of the consumer goods, right. And the consumer goods have been trending in the right direction and having gas prices move lower are going to help them. And so one of the areas that we've been most concerned with that have been sticky has been in services pricing, like things like medical goods and leisure and hospitality services and things of that nature. Those prices have been relatively sticky. But what we had last Friday was ISM services that printed below 50 and showed contraction.
00:14:03.434 - 00:14:11.254, Speaker B: We also had average hourly earnings that moved lower. And so taking a step back.
00:14:13.094 - 00:14:13.430, Speaker A: The.
00:14:13.462 - 00:14:26.950, Speaker B: Growth in wages is also a key sort of component of our understanding of inflation. And that's also been moving lower in terms of not moving lower. But the month on month increases have been coming down to reasonable levels.
00:14:26.982 - 00:14:29.462, Speaker A: The growth has been succeeding. Correct.
00:14:29.638 - 00:15:01.834, Speaker B: So it's one thing to have a really tight labor market in terms of jobs outstanding and unemployed people, but it'd be another to have like everybody's getting 510 percent raises. Right. And so the fact that you're seeing the wage side of the inflation pressure is also moving down. That's good. And then with this CPI print, you have used autos and things of that nature. So you want to see broad weakness. And I think the market is set up for that right now.
00:15:01.834 - 00:15:08.434, Speaker B: But I worry that there are, the risk is that it comes in flat or a bit higher than expected.
00:15:08.554 - 00:15:11.914, Speaker A: Expectations are now very low. I see your point exactly. This is the good setup for that.
00:15:11.954 - 00:15:55.140, Speaker B: So I think expectations have been anchored to the downside also if it misses by a little bit to the downside, which is good because expectations have already started to move and the trend, it might not impact markets that much. But taking a step back, we're at the point now where basically housing inflation, core goods, inflation, consumer goods, some of the services stuff is probably going to start to turn. The labor side of the equation is starting to move in your favor. And this is going to be the third straight decline in CPI, and it looks like we've topped out. Right. So you hit a peak. It's been moving lower and lower in a gradual way.
00:15:55.140 - 00:16:25.602, Speaker B: And so the inflation picture in the US is getting a lot better. And that's kind of what you're seeing in the market in terms of pricing. And it's led to a bit of a discrepancy between what the market is pricing and versus what the Fed is pricing. 1520 basis point discrepancy in terminal rate expectations. And then there's a bigger discrepancy in terms of when the feds expect it to start cutting versus what the Fed's telling you, which is they're not cutting at all in terms of this.
00:16:25.618 - 00:16:27.094, Speaker A: Isn't that great debate? Right.
00:16:27.474 - 00:16:29.098, Speaker B: It's the great debate right now, market.
00:16:29.146 - 00:16:56.750, Speaker A: Versus the Fed on rates. And yeah, it's going to be really interesting. It does. Feels like the second half of this year for risk investing is when a lot of people are feeling like rates will have paused. And you said markets, even pricing perhaps cuts in q four, but that we still have both, perhaps generally in markets but also in crypto. The first bit of this year feels like a continuation of a bit of the slog that we've been in.
00:16:56.862 - 00:17:11.846, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you're totally right. But my one worry about it is it's just so consensus, right. It's like everybody's like, oh, inflation is going to fall, then Fed's going to change its tune back half of the year. Risk assets are going to rally.
00:17:11.870 - 00:17:12.878, Speaker A: It seems like too good a story.
00:17:12.926 - 00:17:19.206, Speaker B: You know, so good, guys, I just worry about that because this inflation, it's.
00:17:19.270 - 00:17:21.182, Speaker A: Like, it's sticky and it's scary.
00:17:21.238 - 00:17:54.878, Speaker B: Inflation, it's the one thing that I would say is different than other prior periods. There have been a lot of folks doing, like, historical studies about like, you know, how is this seventies style? Is this great depression, like, been a lot of historical analysis. Right, right. And I think the biggest things that people are missing are, one, the excess reserve environment. What I mean by that is the amount of money that's just floating in the system that's just been printed over the past decade. Right. You're talking about abundant levels of excess reserves.
00:17:54.878 - 00:18:12.758, Speaker B: There is no scarcity of dollars. Right. There's two and a half, $2.3 trillion in the reverse repo facility. That is money that has to literally get drained out of the system because it doesn't want to buy any assets. Right. It's excess reserves that are in the banking system.
00:18:12.758 - 00:18:37.606, Speaker B: And so there's a lot of money in the system that's just idly waiting there to get deployed once they get the signal from the Fed to deploy. And then you have this crazy investor fervor in the US where the moment it's risk on, it's piling meme stocks like crazy. I mean, the meme stocks today are ripping.
00:18:37.670 - 00:18:39.022, Speaker A: Are they really? I didn't see that.
00:18:39.078 - 00:18:58.862, Speaker B: Right. And you'll see the same stuff. You'll start a speculative frenzy the moment the fed turns around. And then it's like, okay, interest rates move lower and it's like demographically, people still want to buy houses, right? If home mortgage rates go from seven to five, people are going to buy, people are going to start buying again, right?
00:18:58.918 - 00:19:00.694, Speaker A: Man, it's hard to unwind this stuff.
00:19:00.774 - 00:19:37.462, Speaker B: And then the other most important part of this that people are really missing is the labor market. You're talking about 3.5% unemployment rate. If you want a job, you basically have it, right? And you're getting a good job because you're getting raises, et cetera. But it's not like you have that much room to go lower. If people have jobs, if they're stuck in 30 year mortgages that they got on two handles or low threes, people are going to spend money, they're going to feel fine. And the moment stuff goes back the other direction, it could go hard.
00:19:37.462 - 00:20:01.554, Speaker B: It could go, the inflation cycle could just resume. And so I think people are dramatically underestimating how quickly inflation can pick back up once the fed starts to turn. Because right now I look at the data set, et cetera, and everybody's like, oh, stuff slowing down, et cetera. And then I'm like, well, did you look at consumer spending in q four?
00:20:02.814 - 00:20:03.438, Speaker A: It's up.
00:20:03.486 - 00:20:11.518, Speaker B: Like nominal growth is expected to be high. Home prices haven't fallen off that much. Yeah, you have like used auto.
00:20:11.566 - 00:20:38.346, Speaker A: That point you make, though, really scares me. And it's totally right because the second everybody says, oh, my gosh, it's time to redeploy and do more stuff, oh, the rates are going to come down, then that counteracts the whole mission of the Fed and could cause it. And this is the thing, you're talking about the historicals, right? In the seventies, like they tried to get inflation under control and failed multiple times before Volcker had to like, drop the hammer, right? Absolutely. That is a fear, and that's what.
00:20:38.370 - 00:20:52.898, Speaker B: The fed's afraid of. And that's why they're so aggressive about hammering home the point that they're not cutting this year. And that's what they have to do because it's always politically convenient to make markets rip.
00:20:52.946 - 00:21:13.458, Speaker A: And it's also about expectations. So they're trying to control expectations. We're going to keep this story going, man. It's going to be an interesting year. So I'll look forward to it. So that's it for now.
