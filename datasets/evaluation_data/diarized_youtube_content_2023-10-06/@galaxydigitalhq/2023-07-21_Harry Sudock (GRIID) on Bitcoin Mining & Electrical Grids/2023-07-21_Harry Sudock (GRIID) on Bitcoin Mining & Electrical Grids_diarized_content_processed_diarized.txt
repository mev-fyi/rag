00:01:44.322 - 00:01:45.850, Speaker B: And the rest of this episode is great.
00:01:45.882 - 00:01:52.402, Speaker A: You're going to love it. So let's get started. Let's go now to our friend bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, BImnet, great to see you.
00:01:52.458 - 00:01:53.466, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:01:53.570 - 00:02:09.044, Speaker A: What's been happening in markets? I guess the big news since, I guess it happened after we recorded last week, was this ruling in the ripple case. I think that's probably the big news still in the cryptocurrency markets. What's been the fallout from that that you've seen?
00:02:09.124 - 00:02:12.704, Speaker C: Well, the biggest fallout was ripple.
00:02:13.164 - 00:02:14.524, Speaker A: XRP went up a lot.
00:02:14.564 - 00:02:27.626, Speaker C: It has rallied tremendously, up to around $0.75 right now. And, I mean, shorts got hosed, you know, like, tons of losses are implied.
00:02:27.650 - 00:02:29.434, Speaker A: It's like primarily like offshore trading.
00:02:29.474 - 00:02:29.626, Speaker D: Right.
00:02:29.650 - 00:02:32.122, Speaker A: At this point. Because all the US entities delisted it.
00:02:32.178 - 00:02:32.814, Speaker E: Correct.
00:02:33.474 - 00:02:38.234, Speaker C: In addition to ripple, obviously stellar Lumens also had a.
00:02:38.274 - 00:02:39.946, Speaker A: Why does it has an x in it? Xlm.
00:02:40.010 - 00:02:41.890, Speaker C: No, it's the same guy. Right.
00:02:41.922 - 00:02:46.378, Speaker A: Oh, that's. That's like, when you look at these markets, you're like, that's funny.
00:02:46.426 - 00:02:51.618, Speaker C: Yes, but lumens are like, at $0.14 now and looking like they can go higher.
00:02:51.666 - 00:02:52.574, Speaker A: That's crazy.
00:02:53.334 - 00:03:12.470, Speaker C: It's a function of just liquidity and there are forced buyers in a market and not that many sellers. And the other thing to think about is there has been a ton of interest in the US in ripple. And us based investors really haven't had the opportunity to buy it for years now.
00:03:12.542 - 00:03:12.726, Speaker D: Right.
00:03:12.750 - 00:03:17.054, Speaker A: Coinbase immediately relisted it. Immediately relisted, like a couple hours after that ruling came out.
00:03:17.134 - 00:03:19.970, Speaker C: And let's be honest, it's a top ten token.
00:03:20.062 - 00:03:20.642, Speaker D: Right, right.
00:03:20.698 - 00:03:25.450, Speaker C: If you're benchmarked to performance or you're trying to get exposure to the crypto space.
00:03:25.642 - 00:03:26.018, Speaker D: Right.
00:03:26.066 - 00:03:28.490, Speaker C: Like, you're almost. Some folks are like.
00:03:28.562 - 00:03:30.490, Speaker A: So indexes maybe had to buy.
00:03:30.562 - 00:03:31.010, Speaker C: People had.
00:03:31.042 - 00:03:31.282, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:03:31.338 - 00:03:34.730, Speaker A: Second was relisted, maybe had to buy. Wow, that's interesting.
00:03:34.922 - 00:03:50.170, Speaker C: And it's been like, you know, I won't take credit for this since I heard it from somebody else, but that was one of the main reasons to be bullish ripple before this decision was nobody in the US has had an opportunity to buy a major token.
00:03:50.202 - 00:03:52.378, Speaker A: If it were to become available, then. Bam.
00:03:52.466 - 00:03:53.442, Speaker C: Yeah, bam.
00:03:53.578 - 00:03:54.946, Speaker A: So was it like liquid?
00:03:55.010 - 00:03:55.234, Speaker D: Like.
00:03:55.274 - 00:03:56.346, Speaker A: And I mean, this is liquid.
00:03:56.370 - 00:03:58.130, Speaker C: It's one of the most liquid tokens on the planet.
00:03:58.162 - 00:04:02.146, Speaker A: A bunch of liquidity just, like, flowed back to the states on the day.
00:04:02.210 - 00:04:04.578, Speaker C: Ripple traded over $10 billion.
00:04:04.666 - 00:04:05.402, Speaker D: Wow.
00:04:05.578 - 00:04:08.162, Speaker A: Was that like last Thursday? Yeah, yeah.
00:04:08.218 - 00:04:08.410, Speaker D: Wow.
00:04:08.442 - 00:04:11.914, Speaker C: Like that is, you know, that's like bitcoin on a bad day.
00:04:11.994 - 00:04:13.522, Speaker A: Like, that's crazy.
00:04:13.578 - 00:04:14.574, Speaker C: That's a crazy.
00:04:15.914 - 00:04:17.362, Speaker D: People don't even know what it does.
00:04:17.458 - 00:04:19.642, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think it does much. That's just my opinion.
00:04:19.698 - 00:04:22.094, Speaker C: But, but, yeah, that's not the point.
00:04:22.174 - 00:04:26.254, Speaker A: No, but, so. And then there was a broad rally that Thursday.
00:04:26.334 - 00:04:26.662, Speaker D: Absolutely.
00:04:26.718 - 00:04:38.398, Speaker A: Bitcoin made really highs ETH was up even more. Right. ETHC started all the other tokens named in various SEC filings and lawsuits as possibly securities. They all rallied.
00:04:38.486 - 00:04:39.314, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:04:39.894 - 00:04:40.726, Speaker D: But are we still.
00:04:40.790 - 00:04:47.606, Speaker A: Ripple is showing some strength, like, still holding there. But most of the rest of the stuff has come back down, right?
00:04:47.670 - 00:05:19.374, Speaker C: For the most part, I would say so. With the exception of a couple of things like Solana has. Yeah, I guess pre that announcement. Yeah, most of the stuff has come off. I think that's just indicative of just positioning going into that ripple event, which was already crowded but high level. I do think this is a constructive development for the broader argument of what is a security and what isn't and what can exchanges listen, they can't.
00:05:19.454 - 00:05:22.430, Speaker A: Yeah, it's tricky ruling. Like I always tell people, you don't.
00:05:22.462 - 00:05:27.798, Speaker C: Know what's gonna happen on appeal. There's tons of variables gonna be case by case defense, but by the SEC.
00:05:27.926 - 00:05:28.358, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:05:28.406 - 00:05:31.078, Speaker C: Lots and lots of, like, ways to think about it.
00:05:31.126 - 00:05:45.638, Speaker A: I think clearly the SEC was a loser in the decision and ripple the exchanges, even just the cryptocurrency complex, was, I would say, at least a decent winner. I mean, I think ripple a pretty big winner.
00:05:45.726 - 00:05:47.542, Speaker C: I mean, I think.
00:05:47.638 - 00:05:48.934, Speaker A: But there's still a lot of nuance there.
00:05:49.014 - 00:06:55.868, Speaker C: Still a lot of nuance. Absolutely. I think the way you're gonna keep score of who's winning in one ripple price to things like Brian Armstrong getting invited to speak to a bunch of Democrats, a bunch of democratic congressmen, it's gonna be whether or not an ETF gets approved, how quickly, et cetera, and how the narrative changes around the SEC's approach to crypto, et cetera. The soft points seem like they're going to be pretty huge right now, and we live in a very political and sort of image oriented world. And as you get closer to the election, it becomes more apparent that the better story, better narrative, is not the one the SEC is pursuing, but probe something else. You know, I think that will bring, you know, better outcomes, better legislation, and it'll be good for crypto.
00:06:55.956 - 00:07:03.812, Speaker A: That is interesting. And when I think about the election to today, there was just news. Robert F. Kennedy junior had a pretty interesting plan.
00:07:03.868 - 00:07:05.500, Speaker C: He announced, oh, bitcoin back dollar.
00:07:05.572 - 00:07:42.532, Speaker A: It's not just bitcoin, but it's gold, silver, platinum, hard asset. Yeah, he is a, he has a plan. Should he become elected to, basically for the, starting with new treasury issuance to back those issuances with hard assets, some of them, I think, starting at a smaller percentage and then growing as part of, I don't know, a sound money plan. That was kind of interesting. There's gonna be a lot of. I think he clearly thinks that there is voters there and there are. We know there's, what, at least 20 million, you know, owners of bitcoin in the US.
00:07:42.532 - 00:07:43.864, Speaker A: That's what the White House said.
00:07:44.804 - 00:07:45.140, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:07:45.172 - 00:07:48.164, Speaker C: That's not the angle I would pursue if I was him personally.
00:07:48.204 - 00:07:49.544, Speaker A: I don't know if I would or wouldn't.
00:07:50.364 - 00:08:15.252, Speaker C: There's reasons why we were not on the gold standard. The arguments are pretty clear as to why you wouldn't, you know, same things with silver, platinum, other things of that nature. Bitcoin. Well, I'm not gonna throughout the bitcoin one right just now. But it, you know, I think what you're supposed to push for is just, you know, democratization of this asset.
00:08:15.308 - 00:08:16.372, Speaker A: Of access.
00:08:16.468 - 00:08:16.652, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:08:16.668 - 00:08:17.188, Speaker C: Of access.
00:08:17.276 - 00:08:17.660, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:08:17.732 - 00:08:23.204, Speaker C: I shouldn't have to pay ridiculous bid offer every time that I want to pa by, like $200 worth of bitcoin.
00:08:23.284 - 00:08:24.212, Speaker A: I mean, to be able to do.
00:08:24.228 - 00:08:27.516, Speaker C: It out of my retirement account, my tax advantaged accounts, wherever.
00:08:27.580 - 00:08:39.228, Speaker A: Maybe in most, most like, retail platforms that I've used. If I buy $100 of bitcoin, I'm getting like $97 worth of it. 3% fee. It's insane. That's like, that's pretty common. Like that. That fee is pretty common.
00:08:39.276 - 00:08:49.572, Speaker C: Yeah. And, like, all we're asking for is just, you know, a product offering that's consistent with the technology and with the efficiency of scale that's available for every other product.
00:08:49.628 - 00:08:53.332, Speaker A: And this is kind of what Larry Fink said on Fox Business, and he's dead.
00:08:53.388 - 00:08:54.116, Speaker D: Right? Yeah.
00:08:54.180 - 00:09:22.398, Speaker C: Like, if there are 20 million crypto holders in the US, like, the government, by, like, not allowing them, it's just charging them money unfairly. Like, you're forcing people into an awful product. Like, the bito futures that have, like, poor tracking error. You're approving double levered ETF's so that retail can get hosed. Like, trading this stuff. Like, it's just so antithetical to the ethos of what the SEC is supposed to be.
00:09:22.446 - 00:09:22.558, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:09:22.566 - 00:09:26.006, Speaker A: And I think this is what Blackrock must be seeing. It feels like the narrative is shifting.
00:09:26.030 - 00:09:27.542, Speaker C: On that ETF a little bit. Yeah.
00:09:27.718 - 00:09:53.740, Speaker A: You even look, and like, they were saying things like, you know, oh, all the prior filings had a surveillance sharing agreement that looked at the futures markets and they were like, oh, no, no. It needs to look at the spot market. And it's like, but the spider gold ETF, like, or cold trust or whatever, the GLD it surveills. Super. It is a commodity backed spot ETF that surveils the futures market. So like there's plenty of precedent. And you know why? Because there is no centralized spot market for bitcoin.
00:09:53.740 - 00:10:04.632, Speaker A: There is no centralized spot market for gold. You can, like bitcoin is totally global. You can't monitor the spot market. It's not a nice, it's not like an equity that trades in one stock exchange.
00:10:04.768 - 00:10:05.016, Speaker D: Right.
00:10:05.040 - 00:10:19.400, Speaker A: So that's why you, so even that like starts to seem wild. Like they're, like they should. The commodity following, doing surveillance, sharing agreement, monitoring the futures market is sufficient for other assets, other commodities. Why not bitcoin?
00:10:19.512 - 00:10:19.904, Speaker D: Right?
00:10:19.984 - 00:10:33.824, Speaker A: Anyway, they've all gone around this by naming Coinbase as their spot market. But I just, I agree. It feels like there's a dam has to break on that. Let's, let's, let's go back though. Let's, let's talk about some of the other macro stuff that's happening. Anything interesting? We last talked, I mean not a big data week. Right.
00:10:33.904 - 00:10:54.152, Speaker C: Well, so last night, not in the US at least. The US data has been, you know, besides folks had the inflation reading, you know, last week and that's kind of the big one. Yeah, but we have, we had UK inflation come out last night, came in slightly softer than expected. You came in at 6.9 versus seven.
00:10:54.208 - 00:10:55.644, Speaker A: Theirs has been worse than.
00:10:56.344 - 00:11:46.354, Speaker C: But generally it kind of, what it seems like is that headline inflation has peaked and stuff is slowly trending lower. But there remain upside risks. And those upside risks, some of them are structural, like in the US with people locked into mortgages and so housing supply staying tight and some of the other constraints are a little different and technical, like financial conditions, all this other stuff. But the one thing I definitely need to mention though is oil. Oil has picked up a lot recently. So we've gone from at the depths like 65 a barrel to almost 76, 77 in WTI crude and breadth's a bit higher. But a big reason why headline inflation came down everywhere is because oil prices came down everywhere.
00:11:46.434 - 00:11:47.082, Speaker A: Oh, I see.
00:11:47.138 - 00:12:22.228, Speaker C: Right. And so if you're going to start to see oil prices tick up, there's a risk that inflation like accelerates a little bit, at least the stuff that's sensitive to energy prices. So that's one risk that's constantly on my mind and I'm looking at those crude charts pretty closely. But outside of that, it does seem like you're having a little bit of synchronized global inflation cooldown. Knock on wood. Because I know that's what central bankers would want to do right now. But realistically, this stuck between a rock and a hard place.
00:12:22.228 - 00:12:30.364, Speaker C: And if I'm the fed, I am going to stay as hawkish as possible. I see the Nasdaq up 40%. I see home prices still ticking high.
00:12:31.304 - 00:12:33.176, Speaker A: Was that 40% year to date, the Nasdaq?
00:12:33.240 - 00:12:33.512, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:12:33.568 - 00:12:38.712, Speaker A: That's unbelievable. I know that we've been having, I mean, one of the best years in economics.
00:12:38.728 - 00:12:40.144, Speaker C: It's going to make your jaw drop.
00:12:40.264 - 00:12:40.640, Speaker D: It is.
00:12:40.672 - 00:12:44.896, Speaker A: I mean, that's absolutely wild. That can't be something the Fed wants to see theoretically, right?
00:12:44.920 - 00:12:45.512, Speaker C: Absolutely not.
00:12:45.568 - 00:12:48.032, Speaker A: It's like people don't feel, who's going.
00:12:48.048 - 00:12:50.840, Speaker C: To feel poor when their entire retirement account is up?
00:12:50.872 - 00:12:53.312, Speaker A: It's mooning 40%. Year to date. My God.
00:12:53.368 - 00:12:54.172, Speaker C: Year to date.
00:12:54.328 - 00:13:03.308, Speaker A: Oh, my God. I didn't realize it was so big. The other ones that have, and then tech, big tech stocks have been doing great. Everything.
00:13:03.396 - 00:13:04.484, Speaker C: They're unstoppable.
00:13:04.604 - 00:13:05.220, Speaker A: It's bizarre.
00:13:05.252 - 00:13:08.724, Speaker C: I mean, we're at new all time highs and a bunch of the big tech names.
00:13:08.804 - 00:13:09.100, Speaker D: Crazy.
00:13:09.132 - 00:13:09.828, Speaker C: All time highs.
00:13:09.876 - 00:13:14.364, Speaker A: That's crazy. Cycle not year to date. Yeah. Wow.
00:13:14.444 - 00:13:18.956, Speaker C: Ever. And then people, home prices haven't come off.
00:13:19.060 - 00:13:19.300, Speaker D: Right.
00:13:19.332 - 00:13:22.424, Speaker C: So where is people wealthy? Equity market. Housing market.
00:13:22.504 - 00:13:23.164, Speaker E: Yep.
00:13:23.504 - 00:13:25.888, Speaker C: People are going to feel poor when this stuff is rallying.
00:13:25.976 - 00:13:32.152, Speaker A: If their biggest assets are valuable, then they go out and spend their cash then that's, yeah, that's part of the.
00:13:32.208 - 00:13:43.416, Speaker C: But you know, again, a lot of people don't have as much wealth. And so what you're focused on is, you know, everyone, and there are some things like, you know, student loan repayments that are going to happen starting. That's true.
00:13:43.440 - 00:13:44.440, Speaker A: We've talked about this.
00:13:44.472 - 00:14:09.208, Speaker C: Yeah. And, yeah. So it's going to be a tale of two cities of sorts. But at the end of the day, if you want to tackle inflation, you can't have asset markets ripping. It's not supportive. And I think what the Fed is thinking is like, well, monetary policy works with a lag. We're slowly draining liquidity from the market via QT.
00:14:09.208 - 00:14:23.324, Speaker C: There's also more deficit spending happening, etcetera. You know, I think they're probably taking the more measured approach, which is, you know, in six months from now, we'll have drained $600 billion of liquidity where stock's gonna be then, and where's the housing market going to be then?
00:14:23.364 - 00:14:24.900, Speaker A: We'll reevaluate over that period.
00:14:25.012 - 00:14:25.260, Speaker D: Right.
00:14:25.292 - 00:14:26.196, Speaker A: We'll watch it closely.
00:14:26.260 - 00:14:32.820, Speaker C: But in the meantime, people are fomoing into stocks that's great. I mean, meme names are popping off.
00:14:32.892 - 00:14:33.124, Speaker D: Really?
00:14:33.164 - 00:14:33.668, Speaker A: For real?
00:14:33.756 - 00:14:33.980, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:14:34.012 - 00:14:35.948, Speaker C: There was one that was up 40% today.
00:14:36.036 - 00:14:36.572, Speaker D: Oh, my.
00:14:36.668 - 00:14:37.164, Speaker A: No.
00:14:37.284 - 00:14:44.028, Speaker C: And the guys were like, why is it up even? Why is it up at all? Exactly.
00:14:44.076 - 00:14:45.068, Speaker A: Goodness gracious.
00:14:45.236 - 00:14:51.116, Speaker C: So, you know, it's not like, you know, bad as it was in doge to dollar era.
00:14:51.220 - 00:14:52.028, Speaker E: Right, right.
00:14:52.116 - 00:14:53.852, Speaker C: You know, when that was the.
00:14:53.868 - 00:14:56.492, Speaker D: Good dog money time. Good dog. That was fun. Dog money.
00:14:56.548 - 00:15:00.676, Speaker C: I mean, Elon pumped doge today by 4% with a dog photo.
00:15:00.780 - 00:15:01.964, Speaker A: He posted his dog.
00:15:02.044 - 00:15:03.004, Speaker E: Was it his dog or just.
00:15:03.044 - 00:15:04.076, Speaker D: I forgot what it was.
00:15:04.220 - 00:15:08.644, Speaker C: I saw that headline, doge up 4% on Elon tweet. I'm like, not again.
00:15:08.724 - 00:15:09.904, Speaker A: You're like, this world.
00:15:10.204 - 00:15:12.004, Speaker C: What do you even talk about, doge?
00:15:12.124 - 00:15:13.944, Speaker A: Just a picture of a dog.
00:15:14.414 - 00:15:15.470, Speaker C: That's the world we're in.
00:15:15.502 - 00:15:16.022, Speaker D: Oh, my God.
00:15:16.078 - 00:15:19.238, Speaker A: What a funny. What a weird market. An interesting market to follow.
00:15:19.326 - 00:15:21.182, Speaker C: No, it's super fun.
00:15:21.318 - 00:15:25.430, Speaker A: All right, well, Bimnet, our friend Bimnadabibi from Galaxy Trading, as always, thank you so much.
00:15:25.542 - 00:15:25.942, Speaker D: Awesome.
00:15:25.998 - 00:15:26.914, Speaker C: Have a good one.
00:15:27.654 - 00:15:35.710, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guests, Harry Sudok, chief strategy officer and first employee at grid, a bitcoin mining company. Harry, great to have you on.
00:15:35.782 - 00:15:37.366, Speaker E: Alex, it's always good to see you, my brother.
00:15:37.430 - 00:15:37.662, Speaker D: I know.
00:15:37.678 - 00:15:44.584, Speaker A: I'm so happy to have you. We've been friends for a while now. I think we first met on Clubhouse, and I say this a lot. I think we did.
00:15:44.774 - 00:15:49.652, Speaker E: We met once before that, which was at the fidelity mining summit.
00:15:49.708 - 00:15:50.732, Speaker D: Yes. Yes.
00:15:50.868 - 00:15:52.044, Speaker E: And it was chaos.
00:15:52.084 - 00:16:00.612, Speaker A: Was that, like, 2018 or 1919? Well, man, that seems like a long. That was five years ago. Oh, my God.
00:16:00.628 - 00:16:01.844, Speaker E: It was actually a long time ago.
00:16:01.884 - 00:16:06.860, Speaker A: Wow. Well, I'm super happy to have Harry here now. Harry's also a partner at Bitcoin park.
00:16:06.972 - 00:16:07.492, Speaker E: Yes, sir.
00:16:07.548 - 00:16:18.768, Speaker A: Which is. We're gonna get into that. One of my favorite places was just there last week in Nashville, and we'll talk about what that is, too. So we're going to get into Bitcoin park, but let's start it off. Tell us what grid does and what you do.
00:16:18.896 - 00:16:58.324, Speaker E: Sure. So, grid is a vertically integrated, industrial scale bitcoin mining company. We've got four sites, three in Tennessee, one in New York. We're in the midst of a SPAC transaction, so I am in our quiet period, so I've got to be pubco diligent in my comments. But basically, we do self mining, kind of execution, first heads down type of operation. We got into mining in company, founded the company in 2018 when believe it or not, bitcoin mining was unbelievably not sexy. It's gotten significantly sexier since then.
00:16:58.324 - 00:17:34.233, Speaker E: But we've always kind of just had the perspective that there's only a few great businesses in our industry. And so we picked a vertical and went super deep. Our CEO, Trey Kelly, says this all the time, but he said the worst thing you can be is an entrepreneur looking for an idea. And so we spent a long time just thinking about what made sense in a world of insane business ideas, what was a sane one. And he'd spent time in the cybersecurity space at OpenDNs, which was then acquired by Cisco. I'd spent time at a fintech that was then acquired by the CME. So we'd both been down this.
00:17:34.233 - 00:18:06.638, Speaker E: I don't know. I don't want to say VC Hamster wheel, but VC hamster wheel of raise money, build product, hope it doesn't run out, raise more money, hope it doesn't run out, find someone to buy you. And so rather than kind of go that way again, which, look, there's a lot of incredible companies that came out of that process, so it's not a knock, but we wanted to kind of return to the fundamental laws of business physics of generate revenue, have less costs than your revenue, net profit at the end.
00:18:06.766 - 00:18:07.766, Speaker A: Oh, you can do that?
00:18:07.870 - 00:18:40.138, Speaker E: Yeah, allegedly. And so what's awesome is that we get to do that style of business, but generating bitcoin denominated revenues, and therefore bitcoin denominated cash flows, which is an opportunity to have a sane business model, but with this huge tailwind of an emerging asset and an emerging ecosystem around this new thing. And so you get these huge outsized returns, but you're able to do so on the back of a fundamentally sound business.
00:18:40.226 - 00:18:54.778, Speaker A: Fascinating. And we were talking about this before we started recording, and you mentioned it. You sort of alluded to it, but the business models in bitcoin have historically. What did you say before the three sort of business models that have been viable at scale?
00:18:54.866 - 00:19:31.188, Speaker E: Yeah. So I think there's a lot that's sort of still in the earliest stage that may reveal tons of new stuff that we haven't seen yet. So caveat with that, really. There's exchange businesses that have thrived at scale. There are mining businesses which thrive at scale. And then I think there's this third category that's emerging, which is something thin tech adjacent. But folks like unchained folks like strike folks like what I think Fetty could be we see these or at least I see these as a third category that's emerging at scale.
00:19:31.188 - 00:19:57.152, Speaker E: And it's going to be this financial services layer that is not trading currency a for currency b. It's really sort of the service layer or the payment rail, and then that can kind of flow into what Fedi is doing, which is really more of this, almost like you get sort of the attributes of bitcoin and the privacy of e cash, but within a software layer.
00:19:57.208 - 00:20:04.512, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like bespoke. Like bespoke custody forms and like team building. Like team management.
00:20:04.608 - 00:20:05.032, Speaker D: You could do.
00:20:05.048 - 00:20:09.408, Speaker A: You could imagine, like, frankly, you could imagine like a dao that's built on something like what Fedi's building.
00:20:09.456 - 00:20:09.616, Speaker D: Right.
00:20:09.640 - 00:20:17.840, Speaker A: Like a whole. It's essentially like complicated. Sorry, not complicated. Complex multisig arrangements that allow you to issue private monies or pay people or.
00:20:17.872 - 00:20:18.240, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:20:18.312 - 00:20:47.002, Speaker E: We see this also with, like, the folks, you know, Rob Hamilton and Becca at Anchorwatch. Like, they're building something that I think could be a huge business, which is like the insure tech built on top of bitcoin native wallet software. So these, like these financial service, kind of third road, non exchange, non mining businesses. I think there's a couple of them that are hitting scale, and there are a couple of them that are kind of prescale, but there's this third leg that's emerged more recently, which is really cool to see.
00:20:47.058 - 00:20:47.290, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:20:47.322 - 00:21:21.906, Speaker A: So, on bitcoin mining, I was reading earlier, maybe yesterday, today's what, Wednesday, July 18. I was reading yesterday that there's this new academic paper out of MIT with some very famous, apparently I'm not in famous climate scientists, and in this paper, they are quite constructive. On bitcoin mining. I think it's very fair to say that in the abstract alone, which is all I've read so far, they said that this painting. Well, you know, it just came out yesterday, but I want to get there. By the time you hear this, I'll have read the entire thing. And actually, I'm planning on writing about it in our newsletter this week.
00:21:21.906 - 00:21:54.510, Speaker A: So by the time this podcast is live, you should be able to read my much more comprehensive thoughts on this. But in the abstract, what they say is that the paper does validate some concerns that environmentalists have, but it also validates that bitcoin mining can be extremely positive for the environment. When we used to talk a lot, you were sort of, I think, one of the most coherent and cogent voices on explaining how energy grids work, electrical grids work, what value bitcoin can add to them, what are your thoughts? You can't be surprised that some smart people have finally figured this out.
00:21:54.662 - 00:22:49.524, Speaker E: Yeah, I think that the misconception around bitcoin mining and energy and electricity and what does all this mean comes down to just like, we don't have a super sophisticated population that knows how their light switch works, and that's a problem. So in any sort of theoretical electric system, there's three role players. There's the generation, which is a turbine that spins, right? Whether you burn gas or coal or oil to do that, or you use the steam that comes off the heating from a nuclear environment with zero emissions, doesn't matter, right? It's a big magnet that spins, then there's transmission. So the way that you move energy is different. You have to jump it up to this incredibly high voltage to be able to move it over a long distance. That distance decays after about 500 miles. And so you need to be reasonably in proximity, but not next to.
00:22:49.524 - 00:23:47.914, Speaker E: And then the third layer, or the third role player is delivery. So then you've got to drop it down from that extremely high speed rail voltage to maybe a small vehicle voltage, where you get it into your house and then consume it. I just think people don't really understand the engineering constraints that are associated with that system and the need for a dynamic consumer like a bitcoin miner, who is able to ramp up and ramp down. When you think about what are the fundamental innovations that bitcoin and its adjacent sort of emergent properties bring to markets, everybody, I think, is on the same page. That proof of work, plus the difficulty adjustment, is the core innovation of bitcoin that allows it to be a truly foundationally scarce Internet money or digital money. That's why we have a hard cap. That's why the system functions, is those two attributes getting combined.
00:23:47.914 - 00:24:45.012, Speaker E: But when you look at that proof of work piece, the way that a bitcoin miner generates revenue is they've got a ton of servers that basically guess the next block. They spit out the guess and then the pool and the network validates if that block is acceptable or not. Those are happening at the sub second frequency. Let's just use an aluminum smelter as an alternative, because there's a great quote that I can't attribute accurately, but it's that Iceland's greatest export is electricity. They just do it with aluminum. This idea of taking electricity, using a mechanical process to turn it into a commodity good, and then exporting that commodity good, that's a well worn path. Bitcoin miners just do it way better, better.
00:24:45.012 - 00:25:30.498, Speaker E: Because if I go melt a bunch of aluminum and I'm smelting and the pot line is full of a chemical process, I can't turn off the electricity because that's going to harden. And now I got to build a new pot line. A bitcoin miner is fundamentally different because it's all digital. And so I can stop the mining process at any time with no impact to the business, no impact to the hardware or minimal impact to the hardware. And I'm able to give that electricity back. And so the role that a bitcoin manufacturer, which is really what a miner is, we're manufacturing bitcoin all day. We're able to stop our manufacturing process on an instant and meet the needs of the electricity environment that we're in, which we don't do altruistically.
00:25:30.498 - 00:26:13.158, Speaker E: And that's what's so great, is that now there's a market incentive and an emerging market of incentives in order to create this dynamic flexibility. So we can enter into a contract as a bitcoin miner that has a bunch of curtailment requirements within it, that unlocks the bottom of the barrel, lower price that we're all looking for. And we're able to actually deliver on those contractual obligations. Within the electric system. There's a few categories of why that matters. One of them is that there's a big lag in between building the supply of electricity and mapping it to the demand. The demand can move pretty dynamically.
00:26:13.158 - 00:26:55.634, Speaker E: Building more supply is very, very slow. There's a bunch of pockets all over the US. Marty Bent has a great thread about this. Where there's a bunch of places that used to have a lot of manufacturing and therefore have a lot of grid infrastructure that just isn't utilized anymore. Because those manufacturing businesses either went somewhere else or failed. And so being able to bring a net new consumer that's not a net new burden into those systems, generates a ton of revenue for places that would never have those revenues available to them. Oh, and by the way, a public utility has a bunch of households in it that prices go up if you don't have customers who are like a bitcoin miner.
00:26:55.634 - 00:27:21.812, Speaker E: So we had a great interaction with one of the CEO's of a utility that we have a mine at. And it was right when inflation was peaking. And he said, I basically have a couple of options. Option one is I can raise prices on everyone. Option two is I can degrade service. I can fix things more slowly or with lower quality. I can issue debt and basically burden the entire community.
00:27:21.812 - 00:27:25.392, Speaker E: Or I can find a customer, like a bitcoin miner, who will pay me.
00:27:25.408 - 00:27:26.912, Speaker A: For a bunch of extra electricity.
00:27:26.968 - 00:27:37.056, Speaker E: Exactly. Those are the only tools in the public utility playbook. And so when you think about the role that a bitcoin miner has to play, category four is really attractive for a lot of these folks.
00:27:37.120 - 00:27:37.464, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:27:37.544 - 00:28:04.420, Speaker A: And you can't. We were talking about the idea that bitcoin is a battery that has been promoted by a lot of people. And I think what they intend to mean is kind of like what you were saying about. They intend to say, we're turning electricity into something portable where value can be stored. And in that sense, it's battery like. But let's talk about briefly how, although, and I think both of us don't really like that construction. Cause it's confusing also, it makes people think it's something.
00:28:04.420 - 00:28:15.484, Speaker A: It's not. Correct, but electricity has to be generated continuously. There is not a battery that can store the excess for when New York City needs it.
00:28:15.564 - 00:28:15.804, Speaker D: Right.
00:28:15.844 - 00:28:25.116, Speaker A: Like, they have to make it right now. Like the lights that are on us right now, I don't know how fast electricity literally moves through those giant transmission lines, but pretty fast.
00:28:25.220 - 00:28:25.780, Speaker E: Pretty fast.
00:28:25.852 - 00:28:36.252, Speaker A: This was probably generated within the last five minutes, right? Like, relatively, yeah, like 30 minutes. I mean, at most, as long as it takes for electrical current to move across wires, basically.
00:28:36.388 - 00:28:36.972, Speaker E: Speed of light.
00:28:37.028 - 00:28:46.650, Speaker A: Yeah, basically. So this is, like, happening right now. And so that. That reality causes. Every grid has to overproduce at all times.
00:28:46.722 - 00:28:51.674, Speaker E: In the US, we overproduce by about 14% at all times. Like, on average over the year.
00:28:51.714 - 00:28:51.986, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah.
00:28:52.010 - 00:28:54.642, Speaker E: Like, so annual annual overproduction is about 14%.
00:28:54.658 - 00:28:56.626, Speaker A: That's actually better than I expected, to be honest.
00:28:56.650 - 00:28:58.114, Speaker E: The US is really, really, really big.
00:28:58.194 - 00:28:58.618, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:28:58.706 - 00:29:02.002, Speaker E: 14 percent's a ton of electricity. It's many, many bitcoin networks over.
00:29:02.098 - 00:29:02.538, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:29:02.626 - 00:29:10.172, Speaker A: So. And you have to, because if you produce exactly like you said, the demand can change a lot. Literally. The simplest examples are bad weather.
00:29:10.228 - 00:29:10.540, Speaker D: Right.
00:29:10.612 - 00:29:19.956, Speaker A: Really hot weather. Everyone in New York turns on their air conditioner. All of a sudden, the demand on the grid is significantly higher than it was just the day before when it was 70 degrees. Now it's 95 degrees.
00:29:20.140 - 00:29:21.852, Speaker E: Tons more electricity, tons more.
00:29:21.948 - 00:29:26.180, Speaker A: So they have to be prepared for that. They have to be already producing it on the cool day.
00:29:26.252 - 00:29:26.684, Speaker E: Exactly.
00:29:26.724 - 00:29:31.332, Speaker A: So when the hot day happens, how does the bitcoin miner help in that scenario?
00:29:31.468 - 00:30:13.674, Speaker E: Yeah, so, I mean, that's, to me, that is the absolute clearest natural experiment that we have. The whole electric system is designed around this concept of peaks. So you have to design your production capabilities for that peak demand level. The reality is that we're not at peak demand the vast majority of the year. Some of the ways that you can try to design around that are, if you've ever heard of this concept of a peaker plant or combined cycle gas plant, that plant spins up when we see the peak coming. And thankfully, we live in a world with financialized derivatives for energy and electricity and commodities. And so you get signals early when that's happening.
00:30:13.674 - 00:30:44.162, Speaker E: But the much more efficient and lower emission profile is we should just have a ton of nuclear out there with bitcoin miners oscillating up and down. Yeah, that's a far, far less harmful environment to be in. Wind and solar are a little bit of a confusing option because everybody can look outside and see that it's cloudy and knows that the solar panels are not generating as they would when it's sunny.
00:30:44.218 - 00:30:56.838, Speaker A: It's sort of a nice to have, because sure, if it's sunny a lot, you can supplement your grid totally. But if you're designing for peaks, you really can't rely on it. And there aren't sufficient batteries.
00:30:57.026 - 00:30:57.374, Speaker D: Right?
00:30:57.414 - 00:31:17.390, Speaker A: So in an individual batteries or a shitcoin, I thought about getting like, solar on my house, right. I think at a small level it can make a lot of sense because there actually are batteries big enough to store some, like, of a house's amount of electricity. Well, let's go back to work. Tesla battery, like a car battery can, but there isn't at like grid size batteries.
00:31:17.462 - 00:31:19.254, Speaker E: And think, and just think about batteries.
00:31:19.294 - 00:31:25.902, Speaker A: Also, you have to, like, mine for cobalt. Cobalt. There's all these rare earths, like, strip mine the earth to bank them.
00:31:25.918 - 00:31:26.142, Speaker D: So.
00:31:26.198 - 00:31:51.324, Speaker E: Yeah, but let's go back. The other piece of all of this is. Let's go back to the example of the three players. If, let's say you replace the generation with a solar farm or a wind farm. Now you have to interconnect that. How do you move the electricity from the new build into the system? That's really easy. When you swap a coal plant for a nuke, infrastructure is already there.
00:31:51.324 - 00:32:33.764, Speaker E: It's just a cutover. But if I go build a new wind turbine or a new solar farm at that scale, I need to now build new integration. There's a lot of engineering that has to go into that. If you look at the emission profile of an interconnection, it's very, very burdensome. So having to build and rebuild and add all of these transmission capabilities has this hidden cost within the system design that is poorly accounted for today as well. So there's a lot of trade offs in the system that only kind of emerge once you get into the weeds of it. The paper that you're referencing does a really good job of covering some of this, but I think that the important distinction is also just that.
00:32:33.764 - 00:32:50.236, Speaker E: Yes, bitcoin is a large purchaser of electricity. The externalities of that electricity are not unique to bitcoin. If we believe that we need to overhaul pieces of our electric system, let's overhaul them.
00:32:50.260 - 00:32:51.028, Speaker D: Yeah, we should.
00:32:51.196 - 00:33:16.850, Speaker E: That's great. And we can do so around cost, around reliability, and around environmental impact. That's not a bitcoin story. That's an electric system story. Bitcoin miners are customers like everybody else, except they're special. Except you can design these incredibly low impact contracts around a customer like this, where you couldn't with an auto plant or you couldn't with a hospital or some of these other types of off breakers.
00:33:16.882 - 00:33:21.986, Speaker A: The hospital can't just turn off or it's too hot. We need the electricity back. Shut off the man's breathing machine.
00:33:22.090 - 00:33:26.738, Speaker E: Grandma's going in for dialysis. We can't today. We don't have enough electrons. That's not a thing.
00:33:26.786 - 00:33:30.626, Speaker A: But bitcoin machines, an entire giant site can just turn off at a moment's notice.
00:33:30.650 - 00:33:30.834, Speaker D: Right?
00:33:30.874 - 00:33:32.802, Speaker E: Moment's notice. Sub five minutes.
00:33:32.858 - 00:33:47.186, Speaker A: And now there was on this story, too, with the curtailment becoming so popular, especially in markets like Texas. There's software, right? Is it Foreman software? The foreman guys make one I think others are making, too.
00:33:47.370 - 00:33:50.354, Speaker E: There's a lot of them. A lot of folks have built them internally, custom software.
00:33:50.394 - 00:34:06.894, Speaker A: So they can watch, and they watch derivatives markets, or they see the data feed from the grid itself, like from Ercot, and they can have it automated to turn on and off. So much more efficient. Such an efficient use of energy, of electricity, correct? Yeah.
00:34:07.274 - 00:34:33.240, Speaker E: And this is what's so poorly understood. So there is truly a differentiated buyer in the form of bitcoin miners that are going to make our electric system more reliable. Lower costs for individuals and the incentives for net new generation and stable generation. Huge incentive. We say internally, a lot grid is building the business at the intersection of energy and money.
00:34:33.322 - 00:34:34.748, Speaker A: Yeah, it's fascinating.
00:34:34.836 - 00:34:35.700, Speaker E: That's the whole playbook.
00:34:35.772 - 00:34:43.308, Speaker A: It's fascinating, dude. The bitcoin mining industry has gotten so big in the US in particular. Is that just.
00:34:43.356 - 00:34:43.796, Speaker D: Why is that?
00:34:43.820 - 00:34:56.744, Speaker A: Is that because of our electricity generation and some things like Ercot's interesting power markets, is it because capital formation, our capital markets, is it because of our property rights? What would you say?
00:34:57.164 - 00:35:20.330, Speaker E: You hit the three? So those are the three. The reason I think the bitcoin mining industry is thriving here is, number one, capital formation, heavy, capital intensive business. You got to spend a lot of money up front in order to be able to spin up these, you know, these kind of mega. Mega farms and mega sites. Number two, property rights are incredibly clear. We've got the balkanization across states. Some states are incredibly accommodating and proactive.
00:35:20.330 - 00:35:48.424, Speaker E: Some states are not as accommodating and proactive. And so you've got this really healthy balkanization to attract businesses to the places where they're wanted to. And then number three is that we have an incredible natural resource profile in the US, and we take it for granted. But we've got it on the defense side, which is we've got two huge oceans. We like those oceans. We've got two great neighbors in Canada and Mexico, and we have an incredibly fertile country that's able to generate electricity at massive scale.
00:35:48.504 - 00:36:16.344, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a match made in heaven. And I was happy to see that digital ass asset mining tax the dame. I forget what it actually stood for, but was struck from the negotiations over the debt ceiling increase. It also didn't actually make it into the budget proposal. The budget. Because that would just be like a top down. It would ruin the federalism that has created such a vibrant pool of jurisdictions across this country.
00:36:16.424 - 00:36:18.248, Speaker E: And think about the precedent that it would set.
00:36:18.296 - 00:36:18.884, Speaker D: Right.
00:36:20.304 - 00:36:23.992, Speaker E: We're sitting in a podcast studio. We don't like video producers.
00:36:24.048 - 00:36:24.520, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:36:24.632 - 00:36:27.128, Speaker E: We're gonna tax all video producer profits.
00:36:27.176 - 00:36:30.764, Speaker A: Oh, look out, Phineas. Gonna eat your bottom line, dog.
00:36:32.104 - 00:36:37.928, Speaker E: In no other environment would you target one group of producers or customer bases.
00:36:38.096 - 00:36:41.328, Speaker A: Politicizing electricity is really scary thought. It's wrong.
00:36:41.376 - 00:36:41.728, Speaker E: It's wrong.
00:36:41.776 - 00:36:50.188, Speaker A: It is wrong. I'm not gonna say electricity is a human right, but it's damn well sure a its requirement to live in a civilized society.
00:36:50.276 - 00:37:06.460, Speaker E: There's a great graph, which I'm sure you've seen and should post in some of your analysis down the road, which is that there's, along one axis, I believe, there is gdp per capita, and along the other axis, I've seen this, there is electricity consumption or generation.
00:37:06.532 - 00:37:07.476, Speaker D: Exactly. One of them. Yeah.
00:37:07.580 - 00:37:09.452, Speaker E: It's electric generation per capita, literally.
00:37:09.508 - 00:37:09.908, Speaker D: Yes.
00:37:09.996 - 00:37:27.664, Speaker A: And the history of civilization is a history of increasing electrical generation or energy generation. And we were mentioning nuclear. I mean, there was another great chart I saw was like the. I think they call it. The energy density. And so it's like, wood is like the worst one. It's also the dirtiest.
00:37:27.664 - 00:37:49.464, Speaker A: Also because of their reliance on russian natural gas and then attempts to get off of it. Like I saw probably like six months or so ago, the UK was reduced to generating like 15 or 20% of all their electricity by burning wood, which, by the way, was being cut down in North Carolina and shipped there. And so it's like these guys are.
00:37:49.504 - 00:37:51.248, Speaker E: Notoriously low emission oil tankers.
00:37:51.296 - 00:37:51.552, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:37:51.608 - 00:38:17.920, Speaker A: Literally terrible environmental profile. All because they basically reject in a lot of Europe nuclear energy and also have reliance on, say, countries they eventually turn into enemies with. But this chart was like, it's like wood. I forget the actual. But let's call it like ten. There's a number, there's a methodology for actually determining this energy density profile. And then it's like, gas is better or oil's a little better than.
00:38:17.920 - 00:38:40.496, Speaker A: Gas is better than that. And then it's like, if you put nuclear on the chart, you can't see. You have to use log, you can't see the others at all. Like, if wood's like ten and like gas is 100, nuclear is like 32,000. The density of uranium is in terms of the mass to electrical output is so dramatic. And of course, to your point, you don't burn the uranium, right?
00:38:40.560 - 00:38:41.184, Speaker E: It just sits there.
00:38:41.224 - 00:38:54.494, Speaker A: It just sits there hot, basically. And you keep the water and it keeps the steam and so there's no emissions at all. I mean, I just can't believe it. I guess it's like. I can't believe this is one thing we'll talk about Robert F. Kennedy Junior for a minute. Cause he's a famous anti nuclear activist.
00:38:54.494 - 00:38:57.058, Speaker A: One of the main policies of his that I don't like.
00:38:57.106 - 00:38:57.734, Speaker D: Yes.
00:38:58.394 - 00:39:21.314, Speaker A: I don't know where it came from. Were they afraid of the near meltdown at Three Mile island? It's weird because the environmental lobby, specifically for the last 50 years, has been very anti nuclear. It's not just people that. And I think they preyed on. Maybe you can tell me why that is. But also they preyed on the fears I think people have of nuclear weapons and meltdowns, which are incredibly rare.
00:39:21.734 - 00:39:49.814, Speaker E: So I will tell you. This is a story direct from my mother, who is becoming one of the most based bitcoiners I've ever met. In a strange, later in life turn of events. Cause she grew up a hippie. But I had to nukepill her along the way. And she said, you don't understand, Harry. We grew up with duck and cover under our desks because of nuclear bombs.
00:39:49.814 - 00:39:51.322, Speaker E: You just don't get it.
00:39:51.378 - 00:39:53.570, Speaker A: You just don't like the word nuclear. Literally.
00:39:53.602 - 00:39:53.746, Speaker D: Terrible.
00:39:53.770 - 00:40:14.708, Speaker E: Terrible. If you just called it isotope power instead of nuclear power, we'd be fine. So there's a huge marketing problem and a huge brand problem for nuclear that I think is changing pretty actively. Then the second piece is, if you've ever read Nick Szabo's essay called Pascal's scam.
00:40:14.876 - 00:40:16.092, Speaker A: I actually haven't read that one.
00:40:16.148 - 00:40:18.524, Speaker E: Okay, so are you aware of Pascal's wager?
00:40:18.604 - 00:40:19.564, Speaker D: Yes. Right.
00:40:19.644 - 00:40:29.916, Speaker E: And for your audience, it's basically the idea of the reason to be religious is that even if there's a 1% chance heaven and hell exists, it's still worth it.
00:40:29.940 - 00:40:30.524, Speaker A: Should hedge.
00:40:30.604 - 00:41:03.152, Speaker E: Just hedge it out and be of the faith that gets you into heaven. So that's Pascal's wager. Pascal's scam is Nick Zabo's building on that story. And his point is, basically, you can create a culture of fear around almost any issue, so long as you make the catastrophic negative as big as you can. So, asteroids hitting the earth. Great example. How much of our budget should we attribute to fighting asteroids in space?
00:41:03.208 - 00:41:03.432, Speaker D: I see.
00:41:03.448 - 00:41:05.284, Speaker A: Like a pascal's wagers amount.
00:41:05.744 - 00:41:05.792, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:41:05.824 - 00:41:15.280, Speaker E: So he's, like, of great. So, you know, if you now attribute that to everything that has a catastrophic risk profile and take no account of the benefit side.
00:41:15.352 - 00:41:15.616, Speaker D: I see.
00:41:15.640 - 00:41:21.144, Speaker A: So any slight risk at all, if it's big enough risk, just don't do it at all.
00:41:21.304 - 00:41:24.680, Speaker E: And so his point is that that's actually just a huge trap.
00:41:24.752 - 00:41:25.224, Speaker D: Right.
00:41:25.344 - 00:42:16.994, Speaker E: And that ends up becoming a cage for us, where if you're constantly attending to these hugely far left tail risks with asymmetrically terrible outcomes, you actually end up in a terrible society. And so I think nuclear has basically been a huge victim of a pascal's scam, not a pascal's wager, which is that the risk profile was overestimated. The size of the catastrophe was overestimated. And so we've ended up in this wrongly conservative viewpoint around the development of nuclear power. So we've introduced layer after layer after layer bureaucracy, bureaucratic detritus, basically. And then it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy, which is, oh, it's too expensive to develop nuclear. It's not actually too expensive to develop the physical infrastructure around it.
00:42:16.994 - 00:42:28.622, Speaker E: It's too expensive and too uncertain to try to go through the NRC review process. And so if we're able to cut down on that, standardize, normalize, kind of get a better handle.
00:42:28.678 - 00:42:33.542, Speaker A: It's not deregulation, it's making it actually a workable process.
00:42:33.678 - 00:42:33.878, Speaker D: Right.
00:42:33.886 - 00:42:41.990, Speaker E: We just need to right size it. So the same way that if you had the same level of regulation to lay the earliest fiber for the Internet, we just would never have an Internet.
00:42:42.142 - 00:42:43.110, Speaker D: Right. Right.
00:42:43.222 - 00:42:53.660, Speaker E: So it's the same level of human impact. If we don't solve this regulation piece for the nuclear industry, we're just going to end up without an electric system.
00:42:53.692 - 00:43:10.276, Speaker A: That functions and then we're going to end up with eventually we're going to have to burn some wood and coal. I mean, it's the simplest. I see it so clearly. There's also countries like France which get almost all of their electricity from nuclear. So it obviously can be done. Shout out France. And then you throw in.
00:43:10.276 - 00:43:13.468, Speaker A: I love your point. You throw in the bitcoin miners to then balance that load.
00:43:13.516 - 00:43:13.772, Speaker D: Right.
00:43:13.828 - 00:43:20.324, Speaker A: Be that buyer of last resort or curtailment party if needed.
00:43:20.364 - 00:43:20.540, Speaker D: Right.
00:43:20.572 - 00:43:26.084, Speaker A: You've now got a perfectly clean mass of electricity generation with a grid that can support it.
00:43:26.124 - 00:43:26.324, Speaker D: Right.
00:43:26.364 - 00:43:28.260, Speaker A: And a grid that can. So it's really interesting.
00:43:28.332 - 00:43:38.020, Speaker E: Exactly. We believe in tools of human flourishing. Nuclear power is one of those. Bitcoin is one of those. And human ingenuity and startups are the third.
00:43:38.092 - 00:43:52.116, Speaker A: Love that. All right, Harry, let's transition a little bit. Let's talk about bitcoin park. That was a great conversation. I think we're going to be replaying this for a while. I think for, for people to understand how bitcoin and energy markets combine. But let's talk about the park down in Nashville.
00:43:52.140 - 00:43:52.588, Speaker E: I love the park.
00:43:52.636 - 00:43:59.612, Speaker A: I do too. I get goosebumps when I think about it. For our audience, tell us what the park is. What is bitcoin park?
00:43:59.708 - 00:44:27.310, Speaker E: So Bitcoin park is, at its most basic level, just a member's club. And the goal of the project is to create grassroots education across the bitcoin ecosystem. So what does that mean? It means we host Nashville bit devs every month. Shout out to Steve Myers, who's the BDK maintainer. It means that we host an open house meetup. Just join our meetup page, bitcoinpark.com meetup and come and check it out.
00:44:27.342 - 00:44:27.486, Speaker D: Right.
00:44:27.510 - 00:44:28.654, Speaker E: It's free. Come.
00:44:28.774 - 00:44:29.954, Speaker A: We'll have hang out.
00:44:30.494 - 00:44:40.414, Speaker E: Every vendor who serves food at Bitcoin park has to onboard to a lightning payment system. You can only spend, well, you can spend cash with the vendors or credit, but.
00:44:40.454 - 00:44:41.526, Speaker A: But they have to offer.
00:44:41.630 - 00:44:43.358, Speaker E: They have to offer a bitcoin payment option.
00:44:43.406 - 00:44:43.678, Speaker D: Yep.
00:44:43.726 - 00:44:56.720, Speaker E: That's a requirement. And then what we also do is some more kind of specialized summits and private events. So we just hosted the Lightning summit, the power of lightning.
00:44:56.792 - 00:45:01.124, Speaker A: Power of lightning. So about every month or so, you guys also have, like a conference.
00:45:01.464 - 00:45:18.402, Speaker E: So we've got Bitdevs open event, closed event every month, and we call it Bitcoin week. It's the second week of each month mostly, you know, and that. And that's the way to go for, you know, for us. So in September, we've got grassroots bitcoin, where we're going to have all meetup organizers from all over the country.
00:45:18.498 - 00:45:20.666, Speaker A: I saw that one. That's fascinating.
00:45:20.730 - 00:45:34.082, Speaker E: So if you are a bitcoin meetup organizer, reach out, and we'd love to have you at that. And it's really just an opportunity to share best practices for running a meetup in your city. Yeah, so we've got. We actually have a great employee who started the Knoxville bitcoin meetup.
00:45:34.138 - 00:45:54.354, Speaker A: I don't know if people realize this or our audience, but there are bitcoin meetups, regular ones, in almost every city in the country. It's incredible, some of them. And whether they're organized around bit devs, which is a Socratic seminar, technology focused. Bitcoin technology focused, which, by the way, is not like a thing. That's like an open source thing. It's not like. Oh, it's not like Bitdev's TM.
00:45:54.434 - 00:45:54.674, Speaker E: No.
00:45:54.714 - 00:46:01.482, Speaker A: So there's in some cases, like, in San Francisco and New York, bit devs is. Bitdevs have been running for years.
00:46:01.538 - 00:46:02.418, Speaker E: That's how I got into bitcoin.
00:46:02.466 - 00:46:02.866, Speaker A: They're great.
00:46:02.930 - 00:46:03.106, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:46:03.130 - 00:46:15.884, Speaker A: And fidelity. When I was there, we used to host, like, give space up. We had this great auditorium that we would allow and help put on Boston. Bit devs. That's just a thing people can do. Right. But there's also even more generic.
00:46:15.884 - 00:46:28.084, Speaker A: Yeah, that's the format. It's like, sort of the. But it does require, like, some very technical person, at least one technical person to lead it. But there are also just generic meetups, and these things are pretty well attended.
00:46:28.124 - 00:46:33.156, Speaker E: The Houston one's awesome. Is awesome. The Austin one's awesome. And I'm gonna leave off.
00:46:33.220 - 00:46:34.148, Speaker A: These are ones you've been to, so.
00:46:34.156 - 00:46:34.812, Speaker D: I'm sure there's others.
00:46:34.868 - 00:46:41.936, Speaker E: Kansas City is awesome. Minnesota at the Twin Cities is incredible. Shout out to Brandon Quiddham, who runs that.
00:46:42.000 - 00:46:47.696, Speaker A: I've never been able to go to the one where I live in North Carolina, but I've heard it's quite good.
00:46:47.760 - 00:46:48.640, Speaker E: Really, really good as well.
00:46:48.672 - 00:47:06.968, Speaker A: Cause I'm always here when they do it on Tuesday or Wednesday, and I'm usually in New York. So, anyway, I just wanted to interject with that. That's a real thing. You can literally go to meetup.com and search bitcoin and see hundreds of recurring meetups. So that's something. Anyone that's on their bitcoin journey, if you have questions and you don't, can't all.
00:47:06.968 - 00:47:11.648, Speaker A: I mean, obviously, there's tons of media resources now and whatnot, like podcasts like this one and many of them.
00:47:11.656 - 00:47:13.560, Speaker E: There's nothing like shaking hands. There's nothing.
00:47:13.672 - 00:47:24.464, Speaker A: And becoming friends. I mean, it's actually a really big network, and then we're just talking about the states, let alone abroad. But let's go back to the park. You kind of told me what you guys do, but what is it?
00:47:24.624 - 00:47:36.614, Speaker E: And so the park is this incredible unicorn of a property in Nashville that we are beyond fortunate to be able to make available to bitcoiners globally. It's two buildings.
00:47:36.734 - 00:47:39.830, Speaker A: One of them is a coworking space, connected, like, basically.
00:47:39.982 - 00:48:14.160, Speaker E: Exactly. There's a small pathway in between them. So one is a co working space, and then the other is an event space and podcast studio and kind of private offices. And so the goal, and we're a little crazy, is we looked at what Silicon Valley did for technology, and we said, all right, well, let's read all the stories from the earliest days of Silicon Valley. Right? It was the traitorous eight who left. I think they left sun microsystems or founded Sun Microsystems.
00:48:14.232 - 00:48:14.416, Speaker D: Right.
00:48:14.440 - 00:48:51.882, Speaker E: So it's just these really small groups of people who just have a will to turn a place into a hub. And so we looked at Silicon Valley, and we said, all right, well, we're gonna build sovereign valley. And so we think Nashville is the beginning, and the greater Tennessee area and elsewhere regionally is going to become Sovereign Valley, which is a focus on individual freedom, freedom tech, bitcoin, and just these new types of businesses that are emerging to be totally prosperous. So what does it mean at the park? It means maybe you want to buy beef directly from your rancher.
00:48:52.018 - 00:48:54.114, Speaker A: You're going to do it at the park, find someone there at the park.
00:48:54.154 - 00:49:04.102, Speaker E: We've got members there who are really tapped into those types of opportunities. You want to use the park as a privacy tool. We've got a member who had Starlink delivered.
00:49:04.158 - 00:49:11.334, Speaker A: I saw this. You guys were saying that you can have, like, your bitcoin technology or whatever Starlink delivered there. It's a Po box come pick it up.
00:49:11.374 - 00:49:11.782, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:49:11.878 - 00:49:13.206, Speaker E: So you don't have to give your home address.
00:49:13.310 - 00:49:13.830, Speaker A: That's amazing.
00:49:13.862 - 00:49:15.462, Speaker E: You can pay with gift card or pay with bitcoin.
00:49:15.478 - 00:49:18.354, Speaker A: Maybe I'll start doing that. So I'm a proud member of the park.
00:49:18.694 - 00:49:19.398, Speaker E: Thank you.
00:49:19.486 - 00:49:27.334, Speaker A: And I was there last week for that lightning summit or the power of lightning conference. It was great. I was also there a couple months ago for the mining bitcoin mining conference.
00:49:27.374 - 00:49:29.028, Speaker E: Which we'll be doing again January.
00:49:29.116 - 00:49:37.708, Speaker A: Very excited. And also, I should mention, so it is a magnificent property. And by the way, it's operated by great people. Harry being one of them.
00:49:37.796 - 00:49:38.620, Speaker E: Rod and Odell.
00:49:38.692 - 00:49:39.412, Speaker D: Matt. Yeah. Matt.
00:49:39.428 - 00:49:42.596, Speaker A: Odell. Rod. Rod. BTC. I don't want to.
00:49:42.660 - 00:49:42.876, Speaker D: Rod.
00:49:42.900 - 00:49:45.484, Speaker E: Bitkite. Bitkite.
00:49:45.644 - 00:49:46.276, Speaker A: And Josh.
00:49:46.340 - 00:49:47.876, Speaker E: And Josh, dude.
00:49:47.940 - 00:49:58.916, Speaker A: So it's just. It's just a phenomenal location. It's actually. It actually stuns the senses in mind when you first get there. Cause when I heard originally that, like, some bitcoin friends of mine were, like, buying a house in Nashville, man.
00:49:58.940 - 00:49:59.076, Speaker D: Right.
00:49:59.100 - 00:50:06.580, Speaker A: I went to college in Nashville. I know the area pretty. I'm like, I don't know, man. That, like, is going to be like a frat house. I mean, I lived in a frat house in Nashville at one point, and it wasn't nice.
00:50:06.652 - 00:50:07.220, Speaker D: Right?
00:50:07.372 - 00:50:28.668, Speaker A: But it's magnificent. It is a magnificent space. And you guys are doing so many interesting events there. And then you start to realize that there's. So we talked about the meetups, generic sort of meetups, but these hubs are now really emerging. So you've got, like, pleb lab and the bitcoin commons. And Austin, you've got bitcoin park in Nashville.
00:50:28.668 - 00:50:40.924, Speaker A: You've obviously just got, like, New York. There's a lot in New York, but, of course, pub key as sort of the destination. You've got what Pete McCormack is building in Bedford, which is really amazing, by the way. If you start to.
00:50:40.964 - 00:50:41.852, Speaker E: I'm going next year.
00:50:41.908 - 00:50:42.660, Speaker A: I'm going to go, too.
00:50:42.732 - 00:50:43.540, Speaker E: Let's coordinate.
00:50:43.572 - 00:50:43.916, Speaker D: Let's do it.
00:50:43.940 - 00:50:58.038, Speaker A: Okay. Because I mentioned this, too. Galaxy is a proud sponsor of the real Bedford women's team, which they just started. And then you've got. There's a bitcoin commons thing in port, in Lisbon. I was told you've got, like, El Salvador.
00:50:58.086 - 00:51:00.470, Speaker E: There's one in Miami, I think, bitcoin Grove.
00:51:00.582 - 00:51:01.230, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:51:01.382 - 00:51:03.182, Speaker A: And you've got El Salvador.
00:51:03.318 - 00:51:04.006, Speaker E: What country?
00:51:04.110 - 00:51:20.246, Speaker A: Right? And it's really starting to, like. There's starting to be, like, a worldwide tour you can do of only going to like. And again, we're not talking about, like, some dude's house. Like, these are actual places now, which makes a lot of sense because bitcoin really is global and it is growing.
00:51:20.430 - 00:51:41.898, Speaker E: So I got this thesis from the founder of Starbucks originally, which is. Starbucks was designed to be your third space. You've got your home, you got your office, and you've got Starbucks. And so I'm incredibly bullish on this idea that all over the world, there will be bitcoin focused third space.
00:51:41.986 - 00:51:56.420, Speaker A: And it's not crazy. I don't want to make this direct comparison, but you've got the Lions Club, the Rotary Club. That's what those were. Exactly. For older generations, for prior generations. It's not crazy that some people with like minded interests would find a space to meet up.
00:51:56.452 - 00:51:56.620, Speaker D: Right?
00:51:56.652 - 00:51:58.116, Speaker A: That's completely normal.
00:51:58.180 - 00:51:59.028, Speaker E: That's what's.
00:51:59.196 - 00:52:15.664, Speaker A: And I think it is true. It is. You have. I've heard a similar joke about New York, that the city is everyone's living room. Cause most people have really small apartments, and so they just go outside. So it's normal to see people. And New York actually is blessed with great public spaces.
00:52:15.664 - 00:52:35.966, Speaker A: And so you want public spaces, but you can have private ones, too, and there are a lot of them. It's really amazing, dude. I'm super excited about the park, and it's given me a good reason to go to Nashville, by the way, which is. I also prefer it. I love Nashville's amazing city. By the way, I did mention this, too. So you got the park now fully up and running.
00:52:35.966 - 00:52:54.972, Speaker A: I mean, really good. The lightning fully packed. It's dope. And I'm going to go to some more events of the specific events, but also, I want to just hop over there. I mean, like I said, I went to college in Nashville, but bitcoin conference is in Nashville next summer. No longer in Miami. They announced at the end of the conference this year in Miami.
00:52:54.972 - 00:53:03.372, Speaker A: They did three years in a row in Miami, and now it's in Nashville. So you've got, like, a real. You guys are, like, hitting the wave on this really, really well.
00:53:03.508 - 00:53:05.092, Speaker E: Nothing wrong with a good tailwind.
00:53:05.228 - 00:53:13.640, Speaker A: Yeah, we're okay with that. What's going on with you? What are you thinking about? Anything else? Where can we follow you? Tell us. Give us some closing thoughts here, Harry.
00:53:13.772 - 00:53:24.936, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, my general perspective. I've been in the industry for longer than I ever thought I would be. I guess is just like, this is the best.
00:53:25.000 - 00:53:25.256, Speaker D: I don't.
00:53:25.280 - 00:53:33.072, Speaker E: You know, other people don't you know, like, I think of the counterfactual sometimes of, like, you know, I could have been selling software this whole time. I guess software is big business.
00:53:33.168 - 00:53:34.696, Speaker D: Big business. I'm just like, it's just not.
00:53:34.720 - 00:53:35.264, Speaker E: It's empty.
00:53:35.344 - 00:53:35.800, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:53:35.912 - 00:54:04.112, Speaker E: For me. So I, you know, bitcoin has been, um, more of a gift to me than I ever could have imagined. And I feel, you know, beyond fortunate. And so, you know, part of my thesis around wanting to work on the park is just, like, I want to deliver a plus content to bitcoiners, especially earlier in their journey, and provide a space. You know, most people are relatively insufferable on Twitter, but you're awesome in person.
00:54:04.168 - 00:54:05.224, Speaker A: That's true. It's true.
00:54:05.264 - 00:54:08.576, Speaker E: So creating an opportunity to have, like, the serendipity that comes.
00:54:08.640 - 00:54:09.536, Speaker A: It's amazing, honestly.
00:54:09.560 - 00:54:10.088, Speaker D: It's. I.
00:54:10.176 - 00:54:38.832, Speaker A: The people I met at the park, too, like, and I was going to say, like, I think Austin can be really great. There's great stuff in Austin in the bitcoin world, but it's far for, if you're not in the middle of the country, it's even. It's far from the west coast also. Nashville's quite close to the east coast, so it's a great sort of quick destination. But I have met so many people in general, by the way, another reason to go to meetups or go to the bitcoin conference or go to Bitcoin park. I've met so many people I only knew online. I mean, I just met people last week that I've never met in person.
00:54:38.832 - 00:54:39.670, Speaker A: And it was amazing.
00:54:39.752 - 00:54:41.314, Speaker E: It's amazing. It just is different.
00:54:41.354 - 00:55:18.960, Speaker A: The community, like, there is a. That's what I tell sometimes. Like, institutional investors. I was like, look, some, like, equities have, like, cults around them, no doubt, right? But, like, not many. Most investments do not have a large, committed, intelligent, and growing population of die hard builders. It's like when you own bitcoin, like, you have to understand, like, even if, like, the speculators that come in periodically or whatever, that, like, if you cut that right off the top of the price. Price, as an example here, dude, you hit a hard cap wall that is only growing of ownership and long term vision.
00:55:18.960 - 00:55:22.424, Speaker A: And I see it, dude. It's growing and growing and growing. Like, it's crazy.
00:55:22.464 - 00:55:23.352, Speaker D: It's crazy.
00:55:23.488 - 00:55:30.032, Speaker A: Worldwide grassroots movement. It's not just a. Certainly not just a commodity. It's certainly not just a technology. It is actually a movement.
00:55:30.128 - 00:55:32.044, Speaker E: We're going to win so hard.
00:55:32.494 - 00:55:38.782, Speaker A: Harry Sudock, chief strategy officer at Grid partner at Bitcoin park, my friend.
00:55:38.838 - 00:55:41.394, Speaker E: I needed to another job like I needed the plague.
