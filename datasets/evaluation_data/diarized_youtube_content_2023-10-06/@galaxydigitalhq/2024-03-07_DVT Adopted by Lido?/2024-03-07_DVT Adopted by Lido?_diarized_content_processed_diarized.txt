00:00:00.240 - 00:00:46.904, Speaker A: I've been told that distributed validator technology being adopted by Lido, the largest liquid staking protocol, is a major win for at home stakers because now they can validate, they can run validators for Lido. Like, instead of being this professional node operator that is like vetted by the Lido foundation or Lido Dao or whatnot, you have DVT. That's what we talked about in the last episode, this simple DVT module going live, and it's going to allow at home stakers to be exposed and to be able to be a node operator for Lido. I mean, is this a big win, do you think? DVT and the technology there is kind of like the saving, like the major kind of way in which at home stakers stay in the game?
