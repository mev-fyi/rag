00:00:05.280 - 00:00:57.078, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. Yo, we're back and we're ready to attack. We thirst for the track throw dirt on the mat when I scrap like neo with a mic in my hand never lying like Leo but I'm august shine like stardust every time that I bust haters all duck awe shucks, no trust when you're sovereign with the buck when Fiat gets deleted see me backing up the truck tip the scales when I rip telling tales from the crip keep the whales at my hip when I sail on my ship flip a couple coins when I chop like Harvey Dent or chillin with my boy talking shop with Marty bent every argument bring the heat to debate save the seat with the grapes bring the heat to the tape in the street with the cape cause I'm here for the win the rappers TSA and we're cleared to begin. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital. Thank you for listening to galaxy brains. We have a great show for you today. Marty bent from tales from the crip, rabbit hole recap.
00:00:57.078 - 00:01:14.372, Speaker A: And 1031 is our guest. I talked with Marty on set at pub key about bitcoin, bitcoin mining and a bunch of other interesting issues. It's a great conversation you won't want to miss. And we'll check in with our good friend Bimnet, a BB from Galaxy trading, as always, to talk markets. But before we get to all that, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to the disclaimer.
00:01:14.388 - 00:01:15.212, Speaker B: In the podcast notes.
00:01:15.268 - 00:01:32.462, Speaker A: And note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. I'm excited for this one. As I said, the interview with Marty we did at pub Key NYC. So you'll see a different set there.
00:01:32.638 - 00:01:33.510, Speaker B: When we roll that.
00:01:33.542 - 00:01:37.510, Speaker A: But let's get right into the show. Let's go now to our friend Bim.
00:01:37.542 - 00:01:39.718, Speaker C: Net Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bim net.
00:01:39.806 - 00:01:40.926, Speaker D: Thanks for having me.
00:01:41.070 - 00:01:51.622, Speaker C: So we've had a little bit of a recovery. You can see over my shoulder here on the block clock from, I guess, a little bit in doldrums, but again, still in the channel. Bitcoin volatility has been like, almost at.
00:01:51.678 - 00:01:53.034, Speaker B: Historic lows.
00:01:54.894 - 00:01:59.234, Speaker C: It seems like. I mean, I haven't seen a lot of data, what's going on in the markets these days.
00:02:00.374 - 00:02:08.462, Speaker D: I think in crypto, it's just been sort of like a malaise just as a function of an absence of catalysts.
00:02:08.558 - 00:02:08.958, Speaker E: Right.
00:02:09.046 - 00:02:12.954, Speaker D: We had the ripple stuff a couple weeks ago. Those court cases.
00:02:15.014 - 00:02:18.006, Speaker C: ETF stuff was now at this point, like almost two months ago.
00:02:18.110 - 00:02:18.486, Speaker E: Correct.
00:02:18.550 - 00:02:51.894, Speaker D: And so it just kind of feels like a waiting game in crypto. And then risk markets more broadly haven't fared too poorly or too great, to be honest with you. S and P is down almost a percent today, and we've had a couple large tech names that have really underperformed. But it doesn't seem like we're on the precipice of a big sell off or anything like that. The real story that at least attracted my interest a lot is on the fixed income side.
00:02:51.934 - 00:02:56.350, Speaker C: That's what you said last week. You gave us some of the stuff about the long end of.
00:02:56.542 - 00:03:07.190, Speaker D: So the long end of the curve. We've sustained above 4% on the 30 year for a little bit now. I think 30 year yields are hovering around like 418 right now.
00:03:07.222 - 00:03:11.646, Speaker C: So can you break down just for our audience, what that really tells you?
00:03:11.670 - 00:03:11.782, Speaker E: Right.
00:03:11.798 - 00:03:15.638, Speaker C: I mean, we're talking about long dated issuance, right? So long term bond, 30 year bonds.
00:03:15.726 - 00:03:16.374, Speaker D: 30 year bonds.
00:03:16.414 - 00:03:16.878, Speaker F: Right.
00:03:17.006 - 00:03:20.150, Speaker C: That's buying us debt that doesn't mature for 30 years.
00:03:20.182 - 00:03:20.398, Speaker E: Right.
00:03:20.446 - 00:03:28.558, Speaker C: So theoretically, if you're very bullish on like long term us debt, having debt, paying its debt, being a good economy in 30 years, et cetera.
00:03:28.606 - 00:03:28.814, Speaker E: Right.
00:03:28.854 - 00:03:44.118, Speaker C: You would, you could hold that for a long time. You would feel that. Well, but, so people, when the rates go up, it means there's less demand for it. What exactly is, what is this telling you? Is there any, is it purely structural or combination or a lot of comment on, you know, the United States is 30 year prospects?
00:03:44.166 - 00:03:48.292, Speaker D: I mean, well, I would just treat it as a market like anything else.
00:03:48.388 - 00:03:48.692, Speaker E: Right.
00:03:48.748 - 00:04:08.332, Speaker D: It's just another asset. And so what moves an asset? It's like buyers and sellers. And I tell you that there is an absence of buyers right now, and it's pretty meaningful. And there's an absence of buyers, one, because central banks are pulling back and actually tightening their balance sheets rather than expanding them.
00:04:08.388 - 00:04:10.044, Speaker C: So they're buying less of it.
00:04:10.204 - 00:04:11.140, Speaker E: Yes. Correct.
00:04:11.212 - 00:04:32.128, Speaker D: And they're big buyers. And I think foreign appetite has waned a little bit as well just because foreign central banks are doing the same thing. In addition, just functionally, the front end has gotten more attractive on a relative basis because we've jacked up.
00:04:32.176 - 00:04:34.008, Speaker B: Front end rates are high and you.
00:04:34.016 - 00:05:21.714, Speaker D: Don'T have to take duration risk there. And then I think another element of it is also just uncertainty around inflation going out 30 years. There's a high degree of variability to fixed income and inflation expectations and where inflation realizes over that time. And so you require a higher term premium in theory. And so I think the market is just repricing that part of the curve in the context of inflation, which could really start going back up again. So the big story this week is you've got CPI on Thursday. Headline CPI is expected to come in in the low threes and core CPI is expected to come in mid to high fours.
00:05:21.714 - 00:05:47.478, Speaker D: But when you look at things like energy markets, crude just topped $84 a barrel. Nat gas has started to pop off in Europe as one example. And so there are clearly upside risks in inflation still, particularly in the context of a labor market that's just so tight at three and a half percent unemployment.
00:05:47.606 - 00:06:04.476, Speaker C: I was showing this, I said this to somebody. I was explaining what I think is a pretty wide consensus that you've articulated plenty, which is that unemployment is good. CPI's come down, of course, can go back up. But like, you know, the idea that the soft landing is possible.
00:06:04.660 - 00:06:04.980, Speaker B: Right.
00:06:05.012 - 00:06:10.404, Speaker C: And even probably the more likely of the scenario when you look at everything right now, and they were like, yeah, but like, you can't use unemployment.
00:06:10.444 - 00:06:12.036, Speaker B: Cause like if you look at actual.
00:06:12.100 - 00:06:15.944, Speaker C: Numbers of people searching for jobs, it's worse. And I'm like, so I did that. It's not worse.
00:06:16.724 - 00:06:17.148, Speaker E: Yes.
00:06:17.196 - 00:06:24.500, Speaker C: The labor force participation rate on balance is lower than it has been in long term pre COVID. But if you take out those, the elderly.
00:06:24.612 - 00:06:24.908, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:06:24.956 - 00:06:26.308, Speaker A: If you look at 25 to 54.
00:06:26.356 - 00:06:27.268, Speaker C: It'S near all time highs.
00:06:27.316 - 00:06:27.476, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:06:27.500 - 00:06:28.108, Speaker D: That participation.
00:06:28.156 - 00:06:28.972, Speaker C: So people are working.
00:06:29.028 - 00:06:34.436, Speaker D: I mean, people are working and the problem is they're actually, the wages are keeping up or that, you know, there's.
00:06:34.460 - 00:06:36.636, Speaker C: Wages, so they're working and they're making more money.
00:06:36.700 - 00:06:37.092, Speaker F: Correct.
00:06:37.188 - 00:06:38.156, Speaker C: Wages are going up too.
00:06:38.220 - 00:06:38.940, Speaker E: Yeah. Yeah.
00:06:38.972 - 00:06:41.068, Speaker C: It's just, it is interesting.
00:06:41.196 - 00:06:41.484, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:06:41.524 - 00:06:46.020, Speaker D: Unless you have that come off in some way, like, it's going to be tough to tackle inflation.
00:06:46.092 - 00:06:46.372, Speaker E: Right.
00:06:46.428 - 00:06:54.236, Speaker D: And my other point to that is like, you know, stocks have come off a little bit, but who's really going to lay off like 10% of their workforce if their stock price is like.
00:06:54.260 - 00:06:56.508, Speaker C: Close down a couple percent or like.
00:06:56.596 - 00:06:57.932, Speaker D: Super close to all time highs, right.
00:06:57.948 - 00:06:59.452, Speaker C: I mean, yeah, like even, you know.
00:06:59.548 - 00:07:00.572, Speaker B: We were talking about the, there were.
00:07:00.588 - 00:07:08.372, Speaker C: Some big tech names and equities. Like last Friday was a pretty big sell off, right? Yeah, but you know, like, you know, it sell off from like all time high.
00:07:08.428 - 00:07:09.064, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:07:09.404 - 00:07:11.868, Speaker C: Down a couple percent from all time high.
00:07:11.956 - 00:07:12.204, Speaker E: Right.
00:07:12.244 - 00:07:15.516, Speaker C: And so you need more sustained reductions there, too.
00:07:15.580 - 00:07:15.972, Speaker E: Right.
00:07:16.068 - 00:07:21.636, Speaker C: And the fear is that if you ever looked at the interest rate chart or the inflation from like the seventies.
00:07:21.660 - 00:07:22.892, Speaker B: And eighties when Paul Volcker was at.
00:07:22.908 - 00:07:28.956, Speaker C: The Fed, like, they raised them and it came down a little bit and then they thought they were done and then it like, spiked back.
00:07:28.980 - 00:07:29.324, Speaker E: They did.
00:07:29.364 - 00:07:38.928, Speaker C: They went through multiple attempts at curbing inflation back then. And that's obviously what the Fed is very weary of and doesn't want to have to do. It's why they're remaining hawkish. Right, correct.
00:07:38.976 - 00:07:58.576, Speaker D: Higher for longer is how they're putting it. And functionally, there are things that mean that the inflation number is going to continue to have upside risks because you're losing really low numbers from a year ago now. So you're getting the opposite of base effect. Yeah, some base effects.
00:07:58.600 - 00:07:59.204, Speaker E: Basically.
00:08:01.264 - 00:08:17.992, Speaker D: It makes things very traditional, tricky. But I think ultimately what the feds left in terms of decisions is they basically have to stay higher for longer. And the question is how high do they hike rates one more time or.
00:08:18.008 - 00:08:23.440, Speaker C: Do they feel like they do? I think they should. Maybe they pause again.
00:08:23.632 - 00:08:26.484, Speaker D: The way I think about it is, what are you really risking?
00:08:27.024 - 00:08:28.724, Speaker C: You can always swoop in and cut.
00:08:29.274 - 00:08:36.882, Speaker D: Like, why wouldn't you if you're genuinely still worried? And I personally, I'm like, some of these valuations and equities are just still absurd.
00:08:36.938 - 00:08:38.522, Speaker C: They still seem high, still absurd.
00:08:38.578 - 00:08:52.258, Speaker D: And like, some of the valuations in like, privates still still crazy. Nobody's really selling their homes. Like, home prices have been fine. Where you're seeing weaknesses in things like, you know, used autos, which. It's okay.
00:08:52.426 - 00:08:54.618, Speaker C: It's not like the core of the economy. It matters.
00:08:54.706 - 00:08:59.704, Speaker D: It matters, but it's not, you know, it's not the end all. It's like, cars get cheaper.
00:09:00.404 - 00:09:01.452, Speaker F: Right, right.
00:09:01.628 - 00:09:52.096, Speaker D: And so I think it's a really weird spot. And the way I think about things is like, really? Okay, so let's say we're in this kind of economy for the next couple of years. Are terminal rates properly priced? And so the way I think about terminal rates is like the end state of what neutral is for the Fed funds rate. And right now, market based expectations have that around 3.3%. So that's a 200 basis point cut from peak terminal rates. And so I still struggle with that idea because the US economy looks like it is functioning just fine with 5% interest rates. And I know we've got these student loan things coming, et cetera, but I think this is a very feasible scenario where it's like 5% interest rates are just normal.
00:09:52.096 - 00:09:54.144, Speaker D: They don't cause anything to, like, blow.
00:09:54.184 - 00:09:57.072, Speaker C: Up at all, which makes sense. You hear, you know, it's like you.
00:09:57.088 - 00:09:59.376, Speaker B: Had to walk uphill both ways to.
00:09:59.400 - 00:10:10.480, Speaker C: School when I was a kid. But I hear the same, like, oh, we had to pay like 1213 percent depending on when your parents or grant or whoever's saying this hypothetical thing to you. They've been high. They've been high in the past, and the economy has functioned.
00:10:10.552 - 00:10:10.944, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:10:11.024 - 00:10:12.088, Speaker C: We just became very used to.
00:10:12.096 - 00:10:27.046, Speaker D: Very low, I think, particularly in the US, where folks are just so sheltered from high interest rates with respect to, you know, having locked in a lot of fixed rate financing. The US in particular can, can really handle higher for longer.
00:10:27.230 - 00:10:27.998, Speaker F: Super well.
00:10:28.086 - 00:10:28.758, Speaker B: Yep.
00:10:28.926 - 00:10:30.670, Speaker C: All right, well, we're going to have to see what happens.
00:10:30.702 - 00:10:31.422, Speaker B: It is a little bit of the.
00:10:31.438 - 00:10:38.870, Speaker C: Doldrums of summer, August for sure, but I know it's going to be an exciting fall, too. But in crypto, in markets.
00:10:38.942 - 00:10:39.990, Speaker F: Just give me an ETF.
00:10:40.062 - 00:10:41.634, Speaker D: I'm not asking for much.
00:10:42.414 - 00:10:45.806, Speaker C: Our friend Bim Netabee from Galaxy trading. As always, thanks for joining galaxy brains.
00:10:45.870 - 00:10:46.594, Speaker D: Pleasure.
00:10:48.214 - 00:10:53.806, Speaker B: Welcome to Marty Bent, our guest on Galaxy brains on location here in pub key, New York. How you doing, Marty?
00:10:53.870 - 00:10:56.566, Speaker F: Doing well, actually, listen to your last episode on the drive up here.
00:10:56.590 - 00:10:58.638, Speaker B: Oh, did you really? Was that with Harry Sudok?
00:10:58.726 - 00:10:59.406, Speaker E: No, not Harry.
00:10:59.470 - 00:11:06.630, Speaker B: Adam. Adam, the chain analysis guy? Yeah, he does some weird stuff, dude. They're different than like a normal chain analysis company.
00:11:06.782 - 00:11:08.334, Speaker F: Pig butchering seems pretty scary.
00:11:08.414 - 00:11:12.286, Speaker B: That is wild, dude. They literally. What a mean way to saying it, too.
00:11:12.390 - 00:11:13.574, Speaker A: Cause they fatten up the pig.
00:11:13.614 - 00:11:20.694, Speaker B: That's the idea, dude. That guy, I always make fun of him and like, say he's a spook. I mean, he works in, like, surveillance. Good dude, though.
00:11:20.734 - 00:11:21.262, Speaker E: I think you did good.
00:11:21.278 - 00:11:27.366, Speaker F: You approached the spook question very, very appropriately. Like, there's a cyberpunk tinge of bitcoiners that worry about the chain analysis.
00:11:27.470 - 00:11:49.806, Speaker B: Have to ask the question. Did you see the thing he said, too, about there are fishing boats off the coast of South America illegally fishing, like, rare. The example he used, he said, was like, near extinct seahorses. And they also, like, when they come from China to do that fishing, they also bring illegal cargo, which they then use the digital yuan to sell. I was like, what?
00:11:49.870 - 00:11:49.998, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:11:50.006 - 00:11:54.134, Speaker F: I didn't realize. Because you mentioned that they're using the digital yuan off the coast of Ecuador, right?
00:11:54.174 - 00:11:54.726, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:11:54.870 - 00:11:55.910, Speaker B: I didn't realize that.
00:11:55.942 - 00:11:56.726, Speaker E: Big. I know.
00:11:56.750 - 00:12:07.952, Speaker B: Me neither. He said people like regular, I was like a regular people. Then like circular economy trading with it. And he's like, I don't know, but they're definitely buying and selling with the chinese fishing boats with it. And I'm like, what is, what is.
00:12:07.968 - 00:12:09.724, Speaker F: The digital yuan running on?
00:12:10.064 - 00:12:22.404, Speaker B: I don't really know. No, no. I think, I don't know. It's not like on ethereum. I don't know what it's on, but I don't if that's true. And I believe him. And he also does work for like the US government.
00:12:22.404 - 00:12:37.114, Speaker B: Like that dude, the yuan is like making it into our hemisphere. Like that's like the urgency of solving that situation. If not with bitcoin, then at least with the, the dollar. Like, get the dollar. I don't want to, I definitely don't want to end up with digital. You want, I'll keep the dollar over that.
00:12:37.154 - 00:12:48.466, Speaker F: When he was describing that, I was having like visions of, it's like reverse Triffin's or Triffin's dilemma just playing out in a different era where they're like flooding other markets with yuan in attempt to make it the reserve currency.
00:12:48.570 - 00:12:54.314, Speaker B: I mean, do you flood it enough and put your goods there, start paying for stuff with it? Like build a bunch of, that can work.
00:12:54.474 - 00:12:55.074, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:12:55.194 - 00:12:57.514, Speaker B: That's what they did in Africa, too, with all their money in general.
00:12:57.554 - 00:12:57.706, Speaker E: Right.
00:12:57.730 - 00:13:08.788, Speaker B: They created all this chinese debt there by building out all that infrastructure, denominating it and then having them default. So it's funny, either you owe us money in yuan or we own the infrastructure. Either way is good for China.
00:13:08.836 - 00:13:10.636, Speaker F: It's the IMF playbook all over again.
00:13:10.780 - 00:13:23.372, Speaker B: So let's talk about you, Marty. I'm a big fan of Marty's podcast, Tales from the Crypt and Rabbit hole recap and a lot of the other stuff. Marty's band, I've been reading the band, I think for like, can you see when people signed up?
00:13:23.388 - 00:13:24.084, Speaker E: Probably. You can.
00:13:24.124 - 00:13:25.732, Speaker F: I could probably go back. Yeah, I bet you.
00:13:25.748 - 00:13:30.806, Speaker B: I've been reading since at least 2018, and I think that it was, you started before then, when you start that.
00:13:30.830 - 00:13:33.662, Speaker F: Newsletter, June of 2017. So it just turned six.
00:13:33.718 - 00:13:33.862, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:13:33.878 - 00:13:50.670, Speaker B: So I was probably maybe like maybe a year into it. I had started reading it. I've been reading Marty's podcast for, I mean, I'm newsletter for a long time. Anyway, I say this for our audience who may not know Marty. Marty is a bitcoin educator. You're, I know you're involved in bitcoin mining. You're a bitcoin analyst you've got something new too, I saw.
00:13:50.670 - 00:13:53.822, Speaker B: Is it you involved with creatures on this, what's called on ramp?
00:13:53.878 - 00:13:55.486, Speaker F: Yeah, I'm advising on ramp.
00:13:55.550 - 00:13:57.042, Speaker B: On ramp. Onramp. Bitcoin.
00:13:57.198 - 00:13:57.554, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:13:57.594 - 00:13:58.490, Speaker B: What is that, by the way?
00:13:58.522 - 00:13:58.714, Speaker E: Just.
00:13:58.754 - 00:14:03.426, Speaker B: I don't even know. But I see that you guys have pretty cool podcast content. I've watched one of them. It was great.
00:14:03.490 - 00:14:03.642, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:14:03.658 - 00:14:40.576, Speaker F: So onramp is a trust product that allows you to get exposure to bitcoin. But the custody of the bitcoin is set up in a multi institution, multisig with Onramp, Bitgo and kingdom trust, any of the ability to take bitcoin in kind. So the idea is that you can get exposure via a vehicle that people are familiar with and then have an on chain sort of audit of bitcoins actually sitting where users think it is, lines up with the shares, and then when you're ready to take custody of bitcoin, you can take it in kind and not have a taxable.
00:14:40.640 - 00:15:05.092, Speaker B: So I really like that because I was thinking about like the, you know, fidelity has the 401K thing and like, I'm like, I would love to buy bitcoin and hold it long term and a tax it managed way, but I'm like, not clear yet if when I retire, like, dude, I want the bitcoin. I don't want. I don't want you to make me sell it, you know what I mean? And I'm not actually sure if that's possible. And certainly they haven't encountered that yet either, but they definitely want that.
00:15:05.148 - 00:15:20.294, Speaker F: Thomas and I were talking about that when we just recorded a TFTC episode before this, and we were talking about in the context of the Blackrock ETF. And I think this bitcoin educator is trying to teach people to get exposure to the space, which is something we did during COVID on Clubhouse.
00:15:20.374 - 00:15:27.166, Speaker B: That was just like, that was. It was part education, part support group, part social club. I mean, that was a good time.
00:15:27.190 - 00:16:01.416, Speaker F: Yeah, it was a lot of fun. But like, in the context of the Blackrock, you have a bunch of people going to ape into this. And if you read the docs, like, only approved partners can take it in kind, which is going to be very select group of broker dealers. And then you have to get it from the broker dealer, right. Ensure that they're actually going to send you the bitcoin at the end of the day, which I wouldn't put a high probability on. And so with the suite of products out there, that's why I think onramps pretty well positioned because they've set up the custody in a very unique way where there's no unilateral control over the bitcoin. And then they've ran into the docs that individuals can take the bitcoin in kind.
00:16:01.416 - 00:16:06.680, Speaker F: And with Blackrock, most people are just going to have to sell their shares, take the taxable event and then buy back.
00:16:06.752 - 00:16:06.960, Speaker E: Right.
00:16:06.992 - 00:16:26.872, Speaker B: You have to hope that either fidelity, with its ETF, or maybe the others like blackrocks, that fidelity could be one of those authorized participants that actually receive the bitcoin for you. I just mentioned that because they obviously they have the capability to send and receive and hold bitcoin. That's one of their things that you have to hope because again. Yeah, you don't want to do that. You just want to buy bitcoin and then have bitcoin.
00:16:26.928 - 00:16:27.352, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:16:27.448 - 00:16:36.312, Speaker F: There's other products out there like unchained Ira. They have an IRA where you can hold your bitcoin in a multisig and you hold the keys. And so you do have control over that bitcoin.
00:16:36.488 - 00:16:36.816, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:16:36.840 - 00:17:02.736, Speaker F: That's one thing I'm very passionate about. And I think moving forward we should really be beating the drum, is creating this new standard that leverages bitcoin's native multisig properties to offer financial services that people are comfortable with in the incumbent financial world. But say, hey, there's a new model here with bitcoin. You can give end users better assurances over custody and control of the bitcoin.
00:17:02.760 - 00:17:03.116, Speaker E: At the end of the.
00:17:03.130 - 00:17:22.912, Speaker B: Yeah, it's not possible with other financial assets. Right. So it is a step function, improvement, love stuff, basically. I've loved everyone that, I mean, Bitco is an early major multisig. All these great people came out of there also that do it like Jameson and others. And then you have Casa and unchained and on ramp and anchor watch.
00:17:22.968 - 00:17:23.304, Speaker E: Right.
00:17:23.384 - 00:17:47.222, Speaker B: And it's just a great concept and it's extremely safe. I actually, when I use some multisig products for some of my bitcoin custody and I just don't keep the backup phrases for those wallets, like because, because there's other redundancies. Right. I prefer that actually, rather than keeping the. I don't like having to write down the seed phrase and know that that's literally, that's a vulnerability now sitting there.
00:17:47.358 - 00:18:03.766, Speaker F: Well, that's what I think is great about the options that have come to market over the last five years. Particularly there's like optionality. Like some people are comfortable securing see phrases, some aren't. And that's what's really exciting right now, is like, these options are becoming, yeah. Available to the market.
00:18:03.830 - 00:18:54.698, Speaker B: This is one thing, you know, and I have to look at the entirety of the cryptocurrency markets for the research that I conduct. And one area that's super interesting, that where bitcoin, one area, not, certainly not the only one, but where bitcoin's way advanced is on security, storage, hardware, right? Because all the other, like, innovation happening, say, in the ethereum world, is software, basically, right? It's all coding. There's plenty of software development, innovation happening on bitcoin, too. But that's why all the people that get rugged on Metamask, right, like, the entire concept of the way you do nfts, if you want to use them in any way, like, even as a Twitter profile picture, you basically have to keep it in a hot wallet. And they're just not nearly as advanced with, like, whether it's multisig or collaborative custody or literal block clocks. Like, there's just nothing like that out there anywhere but in bitcoin. So much innovation on this side, and.
00:18:54.706 - 00:19:42.452, Speaker F: I think it highlights the, what I would argue is the correct approach from the bitcoin development community and the industry around it, which I believe wholeheartedly that there's an order of operations that will lead to the inevitable success of these networks. I think I'm pretty confident that bitcoin is going to win out in the long run. It's because it's focused on this order of operations. You need a distribution of full nodes, a geographic distribution of hash rate. You need these custody products, you need these primitives at the protocol layer that enables sort of robust security. And then on top of that, like, recognizing, like, okay, you're not going to be able to do everything on chain, let's build layers on top of it to make everything possible. And I think what's happening with lightning, lightning gets shit on a lot.
00:19:42.452 - 00:19:58.232, Speaker F: Part of my language and has for the five years since it launched. But I think if you're actually paying attention, the state that it's currently in is a mature state where I think things are going to get really interesting with people being able to integrate lightning into their stacks.
00:19:58.288 - 00:20:17.496, Speaker B: Yeah, I actually just saw, let's talk about lightning, because I know you're pretty heavy lightning. We talked about this a couple of weeks ago, but as an aside too, I just got the demo on Fetty for the first time. Our friend Harry Sudok is in the beta or something and showed me, and I was like, dude, I need to get in this beta. Absolutely phenomenal.
00:20:17.560 - 00:20:18.088, Speaker C: Fascinating.
00:20:18.136 - 00:20:42.854, Speaker B: It's actually, it's basically daos, what they call daos in crypto. It's a decentralized autonomous organization built on multisig and shared lightning channels. And it's incredibly interesting and powerful. Totally beyond, I think, what the, certainly the normies, the non, the total normies, but then even beyond what the crypto world actually thinks is possible on bitcoin, it's going to really blow a lot of people away.
00:20:42.934 - 00:21:06.866, Speaker F: Yeah, I mean, the, the scaling potential that fed events bring to bitcoin and then combining that with lightning is extremely powerful. I've had access to the Fetty alpha for some time and down. When we were in Nashville a few weeks ago, Cody Lowe from their team, from the Fetty team gave a demo I tested on Mainnet for the first time. And it is like magic.
00:21:06.930 - 00:21:18.622, Speaker B: Yeah, it's so good. It has encrypted chat too, and a bunch of other crazy features. You know, when you say people shit on lightning, why? What have they been saying? And then what do you think?
00:21:18.638 - 00:21:59.414, Speaker F: The reality is, I think the criticism is being driven by either pure disingenuous, like argumentation or impatience. And so, like, similar to bitcoin. What bitcoin gets shit on a lot for is like, oh, it's not a sort of value. Look at how volatile it is. Look at the concentration of mining pools, whatever it may be. And I think that's just completely asinine. Like, to expect bitcoin to launch and to become a fully monetized store of value and perfect value transfer network is just like the wrong way to look at this thing.
00:21:59.414 - 00:23:01.086, Speaker F: Similarly with Lightning, it launched in March of 2018 and everybody expected it to be this robust, usable payments network out of the gate, which is similarly just insane to think that's going to happen. So the quote, unquote, lack of lightning adoption since it launched five years ago has been used as like a point of criticism from people saying this is not working. But if you actually, again, have been paying attention, the development that's gone on with the different implementations, the different development kits, the wallet software, it's finally, I think, reached a point of maturation where we're beginning to see it integrated into very important sectors of the economy. I think what Snenode is doing to help miners pay utility companies and really reduce the final settlement risk and the chargeback risk that utilities companies have is exciting. I mean, for the podcast, like podcasting 2.0, I've been using that for two years now.
00:23:01.150 - 00:23:05.222, Speaker B: Yeah, tell us what that is. You use fountain app, right? And what is this fountain is?
00:23:05.318 - 00:23:41.794, Speaker F: So fountain is one way to use. I use that as my wallet for rabbit hole recap TFTC. I run it through my own full node. But essentially the idea is, and this is where I think the Web 3.0 crowd is completely missing the ball, where they're like, we're just going to remake everything in a distributed fashion on these blockchains with tokens and tokenomics, where I think really the signal is combining open source money, bitcoin and the layered stack above it with other open source protocols. Podcasting 2.0, that open source protocol combination is lightning bitcoin over the lightning network and RSS, which is how podcasts are distributed.
00:23:41.794 - 00:24:25.104, Speaker F: So in my RSS feed, what you can do now via podcasting 2.0, which is created by Adam Curry, who originally created podcasting back in the day with Steve Jobs and many others. RSS is essentially just HTML code and you can put information in their files. What he did with podcasting 2.0 is allow you to put what's called a value block in your RSS feed, and that is a lightning network public address. So when I send all my podcasts out via RSS feed, I have my Lightning network public addresses included in each individual theme. And as people listen to the podcast, they can download apps like Fountain, which double as a podcast player, but also has a lightning wallet embedded in it.
00:24:25.104 - 00:24:45.288, Speaker F: And as they listen, they can send me sats either stream per minute listened, or send me a tip in bulk, like right over the lightning network. It's truly peer to peer like for TFTC, I run my own lightning node and that's the public address in that RSS feed. And people from around the world are listening to the podcast and just sending me bitcoin straight to my node.
00:24:45.336 - 00:24:49.760, Speaker B: It's crazy. You showed me your. Maybe it was your fan, I can't remember. Actually, no, I think it wasn't found.
00:24:49.792 - 00:24:52.224, Speaker F: You were going to.
00:24:52.384 - 00:25:36.398, Speaker B: Yeah, and it's just like stream and stream and stream. Tons of inbound payments. So, I mean, the other thing here I was thinking, I was telling somebody about that, that you showed me this and how interesting this is, and seeing whether we can get in our feed, I don't see why we couldn't is whether I was like, so he's using it every day. And someone was like, well, is he using it? And I was like, well, look, he's receiving it at a minimum, but that's indicative of many, many other people using it every day. There's clearly a lot more usage, I think, on lightning than people, people think. They also say they look at like the glass node chart of like, you know, total channels and total capacity of those channels on public channels and say like, oh, it's only like what? Like 9000 VTC, like that's nothing. You know, it's not like 40 billion TVL and like a DeFi protocol.
00:25:36.446 - 00:25:36.702, Speaker E: Right.
00:25:36.758 - 00:25:42.062, Speaker B: But the thing is, is like that DeFi TVL is pretty much inert, whereas this is working capital.
00:25:42.158 - 00:25:42.414, Speaker E: Right.
00:25:42.454 - 00:25:56.282, Speaker B: And I remember I asked Jack Mallors once a while years ago at this point, and I think he said at the time that they were turning over like their entire capital stack like a couple more than once a day. So like the true capacity is significantly more.
00:25:56.338 - 00:25:56.482, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:25:56.498 - 00:26:07.426, Speaker F: And that's, I think that's something that lightning has a deal. Two things you just mentioned there. One, like lack of activity people point to. Well, it's really driven by the fact that you really don't know how much activity is going on unless you.
00:26:07.450 - 00:26:11.378, Speaker B: But there's no blockchain. It isn't public in that sense. It's a private, which is like a.
00:26:11.386 - 00:26:15.572, Speaker F: Double edged web of nodes. It's hard to know the tractivity, but you also get like increased privacy.
00:26:15.668 - 00:26:16.384, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:26:16.804 - 00:26:25.236, Speaker F: Which is I think is a massive benefit. And then on top of that, yeah, you could do like, people typically compare lightning network channel capacity with bitcoin locked in.
00:26:25.260 - 00:26:26.068, Speaker E: Defi. Yeah.
00:26:26.116 - 00:26:29.316, Speaker F: Like on lightning you can do less. You can do more with less.
00:26:29.380 - 00:26:29.812, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:26:29.908 - 00:26:47.176, Speaker F: I think river just did some channel management and they took a bunch of bitcoin off the lightning network and people were freaking out like, oh, people are using it last. Somebody, somebody decided to give up on give up. And like Alex Leishman had to come out and be like, no, we're just doing channel management. We actually don't need this much bitcoin to do everything we need to do.
00:26:47.240 - 00:26:47.884, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:26:48.264 - 00:26:55.672, Speaker B: It is an extremely efficient thing, but it is, I think, one of the other criticisms. And I think this is improving a lot. It's just that it's hard to operate.
00:26:55.728 - 00:26:56.136, Speaker E: Right.
00:26:56.240 - 00:27:27.552, Speaker B: And it isn't, I mean, I run a lightning node also. I use umbrell and like for a whole note of mine. And it's not that hard. But it isn't like, you know, mom can, you know, grandma can set it up easy, but, and then you combine the channel management issues and liquidity management, which because they're bidirectional payment channels. It's not like, it's not like always on money, right? You got to do some management. But with like, Voltage and David Marcus's company. The name is this gaming lightspark, right? Like there's a, let alone like open node.
00:27:27.552 - 00:27:32.400, Speaker B: Like there's a lot more like b two b infrastructure that's coming out that makes it a lot easier.
00:27:32.472 - 00:27:32.696, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:27:32.720 - 00:28:06.892, Speaker F: DZ as well. They are basically setting up software that will do automatic channel management for you. And that's what actually, I think. Agree. Grandmas aren't going to run lightning nodes, but I do think I have this thesis that at scale, individual companies are going to want to run their own nodes. They'll do that by a combination of hosting particular stuff in house and allocating some functions to companies like voltage, DZ, Lightspark, strike, whatever it may be, river. But you'll have dedicated system admins in your company to manage the node.
00:28:06.892 - 00:28:11.594, Speaker F: I think that'll be a specialized job in the future.
00:28:11.714 - 00:28:53.334, Speaker B: Yeah, I think. Do you think that there will be? To me, I think people think worry about the centralization risk of the complexity and that a lot of companies will run it and then, let's say a lot of banks will run it. And then basically it's just essentially custodial. And isn't that terrible? And of course, I don't think that's ideal if that's the majority, but I really think of this also for bitcoin itself. Like, to me, it's about the optionality, right? Like, you don't have the option to self custody large amounts of dollars today, right? Like you will owe as long as you always have that option to run your own lightning channel, run your own node, run, hold your store, your own keys. Just like RFK went down the bullet points at bitcoin 23. Right.
00:28:53.334 - 00:29:04.310, Speaker B: To me, that's. That's enough. I want to go and educate people to do that. But, like, I don't think it hurts bitcoin if a lot of people decide to use custody. As long as the rest of us don't have to. If we don't want to.
00:29:04.342 - 00:29:08.950, Speaker F: Yeah, as long as the option's there. And with lightning, you always have the option to create like a sub network of private channels.
00:29:09.022 - 00:29:09.302, Speaker E: Right?
00:29:09.358 - 00:29:11.246, Speaker F: And that's always going to exist.
00:29:11.310 - 00:29:28.954, Speaker B: All right, let's go back. I want to go back a little bit, Marty. Cause you worked at Barstool. I remember you've told a story. I must have heard it on your podcast at some point. I know you've assuming that's where I heard the story about you having given bitcoin to Dave port. No, it was back in the day he lost the hardware wallet or something at the time.
00:29:28.954 - 00:29:37.806, Speaker B: How did you. First of all, how did you get to Barstool and how did you go from Barstool to bitcoin stuff? I've never actually asked you this question, but I'd love to know.
00:29:37.870 - 00:30:12.104, Speaker F: So it's funny, the bitcoin stuff, the newsletter led me to Barstool. So I'm from Philadelphia and I graduated high school in 2009, and that was when Barstool Philly started. And so in high school, I was obsessed with Barstool Philly, through college, as they grew, became more obsessed with Barstool, and then Dave is sort of an innovator in the digital media landscape. Fast forward to 2017. Bull market was rearing up. My friends and family group knew me as the bitcoin guy. I was getting text, emails, calls, like, what the hell is going on? I was like, you know what? I'm going to start this newsletter.
00:30:12.104 - 00:30:35.780, Speaker F: If you want to learn about bitcoin, just sign up to this mailing list. I'll teach you a little bit every day. That's how it started. It was a friends and family newsletter that I was just trying to educate them, and then I would share the post on Twitter and the list grew. In that summer, I believe it was like June. It was only like a month after the newsletter launched. I saw Lewis Roberts, who was working at Barcelona at the time.
00:30:35.780 - 00:31:17.898, Speaker F: He was one of the early employees tweeting about bitcoin and crypto, and he was actually telling people to ape in to ethereum near like, the all time highs in the ETH BTC trade pair. And I dmed him, I was like, hey, big barstool fan, I don't think you should be telling stories to ape into this at this particular time in the market. Here's proof that I know what I'm talking about. Here's my newsletter. So that led to him reaching out to me to meet up. We actually met in Flatiron at the Smith like a week later, and he was like, all right, what's going on here? And I sort of gave him my thesis on bitcoin and what I was seeing in the space after that conversation. He was like, you need to start a podcast.
00:31:17.898 - 00:31:21.746, Speaker F: And I was like, literally was like, I don't know how to do that. Can you help me?
00:31:21.770 - 00:31:22.362, Speaker E: He was like, yeah.
00:31:22.418 - 00:32:01.582, Speaker F: And so, like, Lou was pivotal in my journey to where I am today. And so I didn't actually officially work at Barstool until November of that year. But in that summer leading up to the launch of the podcast in August, I would go to the barstool office and just sit in the corner with Lou and talk about bitcoin and start thinking about how we were going to launch the podcast. And so we launched a podcast in August of 2017, and I would essentially just sneak into the barstool offices late at night, record, pull in bitcoin developers. Then we posted. And at that time, I was unemployed. I was between jobs, and I was like, just married, desperate.
00:32:01.582 - 00:32:30.792, Speaker F: I was like, hey, can I actually get a job here to make some money on top of what I'm doing on the media side of things? So I joined on their podcast ad sales team in November and did that. I was only there, Dave would say, like, a cup of coffee was there for like six months. And then I joined Great America mining. But, yeah, it was really weird coalescence of events. And luckily me, it's really fascinating the balls to DM Lou and be like, hey, you shouldn't be giving this advice. Led to the podcast.
00:32:30.888 - 00:32:42.204, Speaker B: I talk about this a lot. Like, just shooting your shot, like, is an important part in life. People get. They think, oh, no, the person's too busy or too famous or whatever. I'm too nervous. Like, you just really got to shoot your shot. We got a guy.
00:32:42.204 - 00:33:14.244, Speaker B: We got a guy in the room right now who shot his shot sitting behind secretary Janet yellen, one time bitcoin sign guy over here with us in the studio. Anyway, dude, I wanted to ask you two about mining. That's a good transition, because I know you've been working in mining for a long time. Halving is what, eight, nine months away? Mining industry today is significantly different than the mining industry at the last avenue. There's a lot of public companies. There's a ton of money. There's hash rate.
00:33:14.244 - 00:33:19.244, Speaker B: I don't know. We could look at the charts since 2020, it's probably tripled at least, maybe more.
00:33:19.404 - 00:33:20.780, Speaker F: 375 exahash right now.
00:33:20.812 - 00:33:21.140, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:33:21.212 - 00:33:45.348, Speaker B: And brandon Bailey and amanda and the mining team sim at galaxy are predicting possibly 500 x a hash by the end of the year. They think base maybe 450, though that's still a significant amount of increase. How is the mining, what does mining look like to you today as an industry? And are miners preparing for the having? Are they concerned? What is the issue? How are they thinking about it?
00:33:45.396 - 00:34:30.052, Speaker F: Yeah, so I think we learned a lot of lessons during the last cycle, particularly around ASIC, collateralized debt and treasury management near when things are ripping. Thomas and I were talking about it. I think there was some poor treasury management in the depths of the bear market last year where people could have scalped some bitcoin off the top to bolster their balance sheets. But fast forward to today. I think coming off the back end of this bear market, a lot of miners are learning about debt management, capital allocation. I think that's really been driven home in the last two years. When you deploy capital, whether it be to build out infrastructure or acquire asics, is extremely important.
00:34:30.052 - 00:35:31.868, Speaker F: So trying to time the markets and the prices of those particular assets is front of mind for everybody now, as opposed to fall winter 2021, where everybody was aping into futures orders for XP's at extremely elevated prices. Of course, when those xps were delivered, there was a recalibration of price and some credits offered, but a lot of people overpaid. And so right now, nine months before the halving, I think different miners are obviously in different positions. The ones that have older generation models with relatively elevated electricity costs, let's say six, seven, $0.08 are really thinking hard about, all right, what are we going to do? Because when the halving comes and that subsidy gets cut in half, we're not going to be profitable. I think there's a mixture of things going on in the industry now. You have that archetype of a miner trying to figure out how they're going to prepare.
00:35:31.868 - 00:35:42.582, Speaker F: Are they going to dump their asics, try to time the market and get a good ASIC price locked in, build some cash and redeploy? At some point in the future, there's probably going to be a lot of m and a going on here.
00:35:42.668 - 00:35:44.362, Speaker B: Think consolidation between some miners?
00:35:44.418 - 00:36:13.810, Speaker F: Oh, yeah, definitely. I think between now, in the end of the year, we'll begin to see the m and a headlines become more prominent. And then you have another archetype of miner like people who learn their lessons and have been deploying capital, buying asics over the last six months when they're extremely depressed. We've had energy prices coming down to locking in longer term ppas at more favorable energy prices. I think there is a certain subsect of the industry that is setting themselves up pretty well to benefit.
00:36:13.882 - 00:36:14.586, Speaker B: Nice.
00:36:14.770 - 00:36:28.410, Speaker F: They right now for miners like, if your electricity cost is above $0.05, let's say, I would say only by top of the line Asics. Plug them in, especially if you're hosting, do you think.
00:36:28.522 - 00:36:37.460, Speaker B: Let me ask a couple bitcoin questions. I'd love to hear just your stance on what about the security budget? Is this a concern long term?
00:36:37.562 - 00:36:38.592, Speaker F: I don't think so.
00:36:38.728 - 00:36:41.484, Speaker B: How does it get solved or is there something to solve?
00:36:41.824 - 00:37:30.946, Speaker F: I don't think there's anything to solve. I think we're just. People like to larp about it and point at activity on the chain and say, this is a problem, we got to fix it. When you're really applying bitcoins, historical usage to the future, which I think is going to look completely different, and I have a thesis that you can apply Jevons paradox to a bitcoin UtxO, which is Jevons paradox typically applied to oil and gas, is the paradox is the more efficient you become with a resource, the more you use of it. And it's a paradox because you'd assume if you become more efficient with a resource, you'd use less of it. But as oil and gas industry has proven, as we figured out how to do things with different blends of oil, we use more of it. And this is a good thing.
00:37:30.946 - 00:38:06.562, Speaker F: It's made society much more productive and increase our quality of life. I think the same paradox can be applied to a UtxO. So as you enable things like Taproot, Segwit, the lightning Network, fedements like these add utility to what you can do with a UtxO, and they make them more efficient, the optionality that you have with particular Utxos. So as these things mature and as the macro tailwinds sort of push people into bitcoin, like, I think, I'm not worried about the quote unquote security budget at all. I think Utxo is going to be useful in many different ways, and that demand is just going to be pretty evident.
00:38:06.698 - 00:38:36.350, Speaker B: What about the ordinals and inscriptions? I know a lot of miners, if they don't really like it, they're at least benignly supportive because it has increased fees significantly. There is even today. I was just looking, I mean, look, it looks like this is just one wallet estimation, but I'm looking at 13 sats per v byte for the next block. I mean, that's. We were at one sat per vbyte for like over a year, you recall. That's better fees. So we know why miners would be fine with it.
00:38:36.350 - 00:38:41.286, Speaker B: They're fine with anybody paying fees. But what do you think, in general about inscriptions and ordinals?
00:38:41.390 - 00:39:15.550, Speaker F: Yeah, I mean, I was reading a report earlier, like, first six months of the year fee revenue was like 8700 bitcoin, where same period last year was like 2200. So significant increase in revenue as a miner, I don't mind it when it comes to ordinals and inscriptions. I think it's an ephemeral phase that'll get priced out by true economic activity. I. Thomas and I just talked about this, but it's attempting to monetize memes totally, which is against, like, the whole concept of a meme is something that's public, you can point out, and everybody intuitively understands.
00:39:15.582 - 00:39:23.110, Speaker B: You're not actually supposed to know who even created or owned it. Actually, the best memes are just like. I don't know. It's a picture that's somebody sent me. Yeah, that's an interesting point. I thought of it like that.
00:39:23.142 - 00:39:26.038, Speaker F: I think it's a big clout chasing. Yeah, well.
00:39:26.086 - 00:39:26.654, Speaker B: And it just.
00:39:26.694 - 00:39:26.910, Speaker E: It's.
00:39:26.942 - 00:39:40.686, Speaker B: It's in such interesting conflict with what has been, certainly, and I still think what is the core ethos for bitcoin, which is that, you know, and the project's goal, which is to build global, decentralized, non sovereign money.
00:39:40.750 - 00:39:41.022, Speaker E: Right.
00:39:41.078 - 00:39:53.454, Speaker B: And then it's like, we're going to do other stuff on it. I mean, I personally think it's. I think it's fine. I don't think it's a threat. I think you're right. I think the market, if it's. Look, if the bitcoiners don't want it, then it'll eventually not be profitable to do anything with it.
00:39:53.454 - 00:40:25.156, Speaker B: I will say I do like that there's a little bit more weird experimentation that's happening from it. I like that type of weird stuff. I own one inscription, and it's my own avatar that I inscribed at 10,888 after I talked with Casey Rodemar back in February. But I'm not really interested in trading digital collectibles personally. But it's a big market, though, outside of bitcoin. Even though it's pretty down significantly right now, it's actually still quite big.
00:40:25.300 - 00:40:33.620, Speaker F: No, I agree. Again, I was telling Thomas, maybe I'm just like the curmudgeon in the room. It's completely uninteresting to me.
00:40:33.732 - 00:40:44.094, Speaker B: It's totally fine. Okay. We should wrap in a minute, I think, too. You got to get uptown, and I think we've been going. How long have we been going for? 30 minutes, maybe. I got 15, feels like. Okay, cool.
00:40:44.094 - 00:40:52.454, Speaker B: So what are you most excited for about bitcoin right now? I mean, maybe it's something we've already talked about, but if not, I mean, what do you like?
00:40:52.754 - 00:40:53.322, Speaker E: Actually, you know what?
00:40:53.338 - 00:40:57.986, Speaker B: Let me ask you about this, because this is one of the things I'm most excited about is the park, the commons, the pub key.
00:40:58.050 - 00:40:58.226, Speaker E: Right.
00:40:58.250 - 00:41:12.742, Speaker B: We're in pub key. We're upstairs in pub Key, by the way. So our audience, I think many may have been to pub key or seen downstairs the actual bar and restaurant. But I love these new physical community spaces that people are setting up, and they're not. It's not charity.
00:41:12.798 - 00:41:13.038, Speaker E: Right?
00:41:13.086 - 00:41:15.774, Speaker B: These are functioning businesses that bring a.
00:41:15.774 - 00:42:04.440, Speaker F: Lot of people together, as Thomas likes to call them, bitcoin, third places. I think they're incredibly useful. I mean, we were down at the park three weeks ago, two weeks ago, whatever it was. And, you know, like, the energy when you're in a room and focused with people who are on the front lines with you, like, how are we going to solve this massive problem of making sure bitcoin succeeds and that as many people as possible can use it? And I think the quality of conversation that happens at these third places is significantly better than what you'll see in mediums like Twitter or Reddit, whatever it may be. And each has its own little twist to how they do it. Pub key is very distinct from the park, and the park's distinct from the commons. There's different ways that we're attacking the same problems.
00:42:04.440 - 00:42:30.564, Speaker F: Like, all right, how do we get bitcoiners in a room to have quality conversations about what we're doing? And I also think it's just great to have these physical spaces for people who are coming through town, like New York, Nashville, Austin. Miami's got the grove now. And it's great to have these places for people who may not be confident enough to inject themselves in a conversation on Twitter or send a DM to. To basically ask these questions in person.
00:42:30.984 - 00:42:56.648, Speaker B: It's just like a global rallying point. And I agree. The physical community is an important part of any movement. And I always tell people, particularly institutional investors, when I'm trying to actually get them to really understand bitcoin, aside from how it works and what its properties are and its value propositions, is, like, you have to understand, like, this is a global movement. Like, you can own it as a financial asset if you choose, certainly.
00:42:56.696 - 00:42:56.904, Speaker E: Right?
00:42:56.944 - 00:43:14.944, Speaker B: And I think there's. There's upside there, but, like, we're out here, like, there's a group number of people is growing, and it's grown so big now that multiple of these are being supported in multiple cities. Yeah, it's not just meetup.com anymore. It's literal, nice physical spaces with conferences.
00:43:15.024 - 00:43:17.524, Speaker F: Nashville has a whole goddamn campus. It's huge.
00:43:18.024 - 00:43:25.154, Speaker B: I love that place. Hey, are you excited for. What are your thoughts on bitcoin 24 moving from Miami to Nashville.
00:43:25.194 - 00:43:32.930, Speaker F: Well, we were just down there and. Yeah, at the end of July, it's very hot. Yeah. Excited that, like, I think, yeah, Miami had its run.
00:43:33.042 - 00:43:34.402, Speaker B: It was good. It was.
00:43:34.498 - 00:43:37.538, Speaker F: But, like, hopping from South beach to Brickell, like, all over, I think.
00:43:37.626 - 00:43:38.058, Speaker E: Well, I.
00:43:38.106 - 00:43:43.866, Speaker B: That I agree with. I finally, this last time, made the point to really just stay in South beach pretty much the whole time.
00:43:43.930 - 00:43:44.554, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:43:44.714 - 00:43:50.338, Speaker B: Previously, like, remember when it was in. When it was in. What's it called? The art that.
00:43:50.426 - 00:43:50.650, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:43:50.682 - 00:43:52.682, Speaker F: Is in Brickell. I forget what it was.
00:43:52.738 - 00:43:54.194, Speaker B: Yeah, I forget. What's that?
00:43:54.274 - 00:43:54.666, Speaker A: Winwood.
00:43:54.690 - 00:44:08.978, Speaker B: It was in Wynwood. It was manna contemporary in Wynwood, which is like this, like, warehouse district in 2021. I think it was the first conference, like, globally that was, like, remotely of that size. Remember they were writing all those stories.
00:44:09.026 - 00:44:11.378, Speaker F: About people 8 hours in line.
00:44:11.506 - 00:44:11.762, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:44:11.778 - 00:44:35.364, Speaker B: And it was so hot and also kind of. And then you're like, oh, let's go out to South beach. And you're like, that's a 45 minutes drive from here. Nashville, very different vibe. Not, you know, you go down Collins Ave in South beach, and it's just like, hotel, hotel, hotel, hotel, hotel. Every single one with a pool and a back bar. Nashville, I mean, we're gonna take over that Broadway scene down Broadway.
00:44:35.404 - 00:44:37.064, Speaker F: I'm excited to go to Santa's pub.
00:44:37.524 - 00:44:40.212, Speaker B: Is that gonna be pub key Nashville, Santa's pub?
00:44:40.268 - 00:44:41.944, Speaker F: No, he nixed me on that.
00:44:42.524 - 00:44:43.380, Speaker B: No announcements.
00:44:43.452 - 00:44:44.230, Speaker F: All right.
00:44:44.412 - 00:45:03.498, Speaker B: We had a good time at Max Club Deuce as, like, pub key South beach. It was good pub key pop up. Do you think that this is going to drive? Are these spaces going to be able to bring in net new people? Or is it going to be more of like our sort of our community club for bitcoiners that already exist?
00:45:03.546 - 00:45:34.694, Speaker F: I think it'll be a combination of both. Thomas and I were talking about this earlier. As pub key expands. I think one thing about having pubkey here, right off of Washington Square park, is that it's right near NYU. And then similarly at the park, it's right between Belmont and Vanderbilt. And then in Austin, obviously, we're by Ut. And each place, I think the net new entrants to bitcoin are the university students that are coming, like, what the hell's going on here? Come to event to get free food and maybe sneak a beer in.
00:45:34.694 - 00:45:40.080, Speaker F: I think it's predominantly, if we're being honest with ourselves, like bitcoiners, like aggregate.
00:45:40.112 - 00:45:48.048, Speaker B: Well, you know, you learn about bitcoin, maybe elsewhere, and then you got a place to go. I mean, I see people, people come to pub key that I, that aren't even. It's like the bar, the food's really good.
00:45:48.136 - 00:45:48.336, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:45:48.360 - 00:45:52.136, Speaker F: I mean, that's part of pub key strategy too, is like have bitcoin.
00:45:52.240 - 00:46:18.630, Speaker B: What does it say down on your delt delta? Unplayable hand. Try your luck. Here is one of the slogans because the seven two is the. The logo. So what about. I want to ask you about some of the bitcoin dev stuff, specifically these various proposals for like a future soft fork or upgrade regardless of whether. So you got OPC tv, you got Opvault, you got Apo, I guess you got drive chains, right? You got all of which have bips, right.
00:46:18.630 - 00:46:38.034, Speaker B: I think all of those have pretty fleshed out proposals. Maybe. I know there's others that have proposals too, but those are the ones I feel like people are talking about a lot. Do you have any, I mean, I guess on APo vaults, CTV and Opvault, which all do similar types of things. Do you have a preference or do you have between them?
00:46:39.174 - 00:47:16.466, Speaker F: I like opvault in the sense that it's very hyper focused. Takes what Ops CTV. So check template verify is trying to do and really narrowing it down to one particular use case, which is vaulting functionality, spending conditions over time. I don't know. I think we learned a lot of lessons around Taproot. Like ordinals and inscriptions were something that many people didn't foresee coming to market. Once that got activated and that was driven by a combination of Segwit and taproot, ApO seems like it's going to be very important to scale the lightning network.
00:47:16.466 - 00:47:58.446, Speaker F: So just off the bat, that seems very intriguing to me. I think the more important conversation is do we batch a bunch of these upgrades at once and just try to have a long discussion and talk about the trade offs and test the trade offs and then get a lot in at once. So we want to do it multiple times and then what is the actual activation method? Because that's another thing with tap that really, there's really ruffled feathers is speedy trial. Speedy trial and how it was activated. Yeah, I think there's a lot of discussion going on. Like, all right, there probably will be another soft fork upgrade at some point in the future. Do we batch a bunch of them together? Do we do them separately and then on top of that, like, how do we actually activate them?
00:47:58.510 - 00:47:59.870, Speaker B: Right, so.
00:47:59.902 - 00:48:01.150, Speaker C: But you, but you like the idea.
00:48:01.182 - 00:48:04.594, Speaker B: Of like vaulted spending, adding vulpix and all that? Yeah, I do, too.
00:48:04.934 - 00:48:12.434, Speaker F: But now, like, the emergence of mini script, right. It's like, you don't need it as much as good enough.
00:48:12.774 - 00:48:48.342, Speaker B: Right. There's obviously more that you can do with a new opcode, but miniscript is sick. And, I mean, when Rob Hamilton. We had Rob on this show. You've talked to rob, rob on your stuff, and we know Rob and the team there, Becca and everybody else are great. But when he showed me, he showed me the mock up version. Now he's got a live alpha, but he showed me just the mock up of the flow of how simple it is and shows the output, the actual script output of it's unbelievably powerful.
00:48:48.342 - 00:48:58.118, Speaker B: We've talked about this so our audience can go and listen to our episode with Rob Hamilton. It was, I think, back in February or March, so I won't go deep into it, but it does bring a lot of what you thought you needed.
00:48:58.246 - 00:49:35.144, Speaker F: Yeah. And that's, like, the big question we have, like, bitcoin is this very important project. What is the trade off of activating something else, some unknown unknowns that could introduce something that was unforeseen, that maybe does not allow bitcoin to be as successful or scalable or usable as we thought it would be, versus, like, all right, what do we have now? And that's what I think Rob does a really good job of doing in terms of bringing to the conversation was like, let's work with everything we have right now and see how far we can get. And then down the line, if that's not enough, maybe we start having discussions.
00:49:35.224 - 00:49:35.368, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:49:35.376 - 00:49:41.460, Speaker B: It's very prudent the way he thinks about it. All right, we're running late on time, but let's talk about the presidential election a little bit.
00:49:41.532 - 00:49:43.044, Speaker E: Yeah, well, that's. That's what I was going to say.
00:49:43.084 - 00:49:44.748, Speaker F: Like, in terms of, like, bitcoin 2024.
00:49:44.796 - 00:49:45.028, Speaker E: Right.
00:49:45.076 - 00:49:53.708, Speaker F: That's one of the interesting themes. Like, two months before the election, obviously, they had a bunch of candidates at 2023. Like, do we have a presidential debate at the.
00:49:53.796 - 00:50:24.354, Speaker B: I mean, it'd be fascinating, actually. They should. It's in between the two nominating conventions, and I don't recall which order is which, but I would hope that the republican one is after it, because then you could. You could conceivably have, like, Vivek and Ron DeSantis, and you could have them there. You really could. And, I mean, do you prefer, like, RFK's bitcoinerism over Vivex? Or, you know, how do you think about bitcoin? In this presidential election.
00:50:24.654 - 00:51:11.386, Speaker F: I'm agnostic because I'm a strong believer that bitcoin's not like the avenue to bitcoin success isn't through the federal government political process. However, I do think it's massively beneficial that it is a campaign talking point and has shifted the Overton window, where these politicians are forced to talk about bitcoin and have thoughts and ideas around it and really think about it and then spread those ideas to others just by talking about it. To me, not going to back any particular bitcoin stance by one individual presidential candidate, but I think in aggregate, them just being forced to talk about it and shifting the Overton window is massively beneficial.
00:51:11.410 - 00:51:11.570, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:51:11.602 - 00:51:17.570, Speaker B: Do you think the federal government or the Federal Reserve ever ends up huddling bitcoin?
00:51:17.642 - 00:51:18.674, Speaker F: I mean, they already do.
00:51:18.794 - 00:51:19.090, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:51:19.122 - 00:51:20.866, Speaker B: Well, they have the. Like what, the seized bitcoin?
00:51:20.930 - 00:51:21.106, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:51:21.130 - 00:51:23.402, Speaker B: They have the silk roads and the Silk road.
00:51:23.458 - 00:51:26.134, Speaker F: And I believe they have btce and bitfinex.
00:51:26.474 - 00:51:29.730, Speaker B: I think they have the Bitfinex coins from Russell Khan.
00:51:29.802 - 00:51:30.734, Speaker F: You should give them back.
00:51:30.834 - 00:51:39.754, Speaker B: They should give them back. I'm actually kind of surprised they haven't already. I don't know enough about it, but I believe they do have Razzlekahn's coins.
00:51:41.694 - 00:51:44.366, Speaker F: The best rapper of our channel, crocodile of Wall Street.
