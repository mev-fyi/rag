00:00:00.880 - 00:00:11.105, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains. An infinite amount of cash. I'm your host, Alex Thorne. The US banking system is sound and resilient. Bitcoin made a new all time high.
00:00:11.265 - 00:00:12.121, Speaker B: If you're not long.
00:00:12.193 - 00:00:17.737, Speaker A: If you're not long, you're short. Satoshi's gonna come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet.
00:00:17.841 - 00:00:22.045, Speaker B: All bitcoin's gonna be erased. Bitcoin. Bitcoin's the best crypto.
00:00:22.985 - 00:00:40.755, Speaker A: Bitcoin is going to zero. Welcome back to Galaxy Brains. I'm your host Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Bitcoin. Not zero. And we have another great episode for you. Luca Prospery, CEO and co founder of M0 is our guest. We're going to talk about new innovative stablecoin designs and Lucas history in the industry.
00:00:40.755 - 00:01:16.561, Speaker A: We'll also check with our good friend Bimnet, a BB from Galaxy Trading, as always to discuss markets and macro. Very significant and interesting downward employment number adjustment by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that has markets intrigued. And of course before we get to that, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to disclaimer in the podcast notes and note that none of the information this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer recommendation or solicitation by Galaxy or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. We have a great episode for you, so let's get right into it. Let's go now to our guest, Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Trading. As always, Bimnet. Welcome back to Galaxy Brains.
00:01:16.753 - 00:01:18.001, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:01:18.153 - 00:01:44.875, Speaker A: It's, it's, it is summer doldrums. But there have been a couple exciting things. Let's start with this Bureau of Labor Statistics downward revision. It's the largest downward revision in employment numbers since the Great financial crisis 2009. This just hit this morning. We're recording on Wednesday, August 21st. What's your take on this? Was this expected? You've called out skepticism about the employment numbers in the past on this show.
00:01:44.995 - 00:02:17.279, Speaker C: Yeah, you know, it's, it's very interesting to see the market reaction to the number. So the number came out at I think 812,000 jobs that were in the reporting that shouldn't have been. And so that's, that's a big number. And to give you guys some context, I think last on farm payrolls we might have missed by like 100,000 jobs and markets went crazy. And so this is a pretty material number. Comes out to about 70,000 jobs per month.
00:02:17.407 - 00:02:21.473, Speaker A: And this is March 2023 to March 2024. Right.
00:02:21.639 - 00:03:06.265, Speaker C: I think it covers March, April. Right, because the 12 months. But yeah, no. So it's a big deal. And I think if I told you today that or like a week ago that we actually have 800,000 fewer jobs, you'd be like, that's a good amount because we're normally adding like 200,000 jobs per month now. So that's literally like four months of healthy employment numbers just gone. And I think given the focus of the Fed in terms of their dual mandate and now being more focused on the labor market, it's very material from the standpoint that it's a number that the Fed can't ignore and in fact they're focusing on it.
00:03:06.265 - 00:04:11.687, Speaker C: And so I genuinely think that the market reaction we've seen so far probably speaks to how expected this number was in terms of there's a lot of forecasters on the street anticipating a number around this ballpark. In addition, it speaks to the magnitude of rate cuts that are also already baked in. Going into this Release, you had four cuts in 2024, that's 100 basis points that was expected going through year end. And then over the next six to 10 months you had another 100 basis points. So there's a lot of cutting baked into the market. And so it's tough for the market to be like, oh, we need to price in more. So now it's really about how aggressively they cut in terms of 25 or 50 and in what sequence and are they going to ever do more than that? And so it's really about the cadence of the cuts.
00:04:11.687 - 00:04:47.555, Speaker C: I would say less so about the magnitude. But yeah, it's high level, it's a big deal. But it was very expected. I would tell you that from an outside observer, what typically leads to broader economic weakness is weakness in the labor market. When people can't afford their mortgage payments because they've lost their job, they sell their homes. They sell their homes, home prices go down, they sell stocks, asset prices go down. And so it leads to a cycle of bad stuff happening, to put it plainly.
00:04:47.555 - 00:05:24.975, Speaker C: And so that's why the labor market is super important to pay attention to. In addition, typically what happens is when you see these spikes in the unemployment rate, you're more likely than not to get a much bigger spike ultimately. Let's just take walk through like an example, like if I lost my job, I'm going to go out to eat less, I'm going to use less services. Those companies are going to see the fact that I'm using less services and then they're Going to hire less. Right. Or they're going to lay off staff. And so typically, you know, when you have unemployment starting to tick higher, there's a very strong feedback loop into the real economy.
00:05:25.435 - 00:05:44.719, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. It is one of the most important parts of the economy. What else are you looking at? We talked about the yen carry trade last week on the show. You know, I've seen some bank coverage that sort of at a high level. A lot of it may have unwinded already. But you've been saying in general like there'll be plenty left to unwind.
00:05:44.767 - 00:06:18.291, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I mean Mex yen was the most popular yen carry trade as we've discussed and that thing was moving a lot lower over the past couple of sessions. And that's just, you know, from, from continued unwinds and you've started to see a little bit more, more two way price action in dollar yen as well. So you're starting to see a little bit more unwind. But in the face of that you also have people adding to the trade or fresh longs coming in because it is still, you know, relatively attractive from, from a right.
00:06:18.323 - 00:06:20.459, Speaker A: Japanese rates are still quite low, right?
00:06:20.507 - 00:06:57.847, Speaker C: Yes, exactly. And so folks are just, you know, they might be putting on the trades and using other kind of risk management tools to kind of mitigate some of the tail scenarios. But some folks are reengaging, other folks are still unwinding. But you know, I still don't think we're through it all per se, but there's a chance we could be. Outside of that. I'm paying super close attention to the price action in gold were at all time highs. It's not accelerating higher but the fact that it just continues to grind higher.
00:06:57.847 - 00:07:38.089, Speaker C: It's supported by a dollar that's been weakening lately. If you've seen euro go from 107 to almost 111 now, dollar yen had the big move. So you've had a pretty decent dollar sell off and that's helping. Gold risk sentiment has been okay. S and P has rallied back pretty, pretty close to the highs once again. And so you know, and given kind of the lack of allocation to gold in terms of just, you know, looking at, you know, large asset managers, you know, family offices, etc. Like that, that commodity exposure is still super low in a lot of portfolios and this thing is at fresh all time highs.
00:07:38.089 - 00:08:25.055, Speaker C: And so you know, it's, it looks super compelling to continue particularly if you are going to have a very dovish Fed. And then the last thing I'm paying Attention to is just this kind of real yield dynamic where you have forward interest rates or where folks expect the US to land in terms of a terminal interest rate is around 3%. That's where the one year forward is. Two year, one year forward is. And then when you look at inflation breakevens they're expected to be around 2% now. And so you've got a dynamic where the real yield in the economy not spot but on a forward basis is pretty close to this 1% area. And so that's pretty low.
00:08:25.055 - 00:09:18.213, Speaker C: And I just, I struggle to see kind of a dynamic where it doesn't. We don't start to price out some of these cuts and we don't start to see that real yield kind of move a little bit more. So it's a tough place. But yeah, some would argue that if you are genuinely concerned about an economic downturn or hard landing rates should be neutral or real yield should be close to zero and that's more accommodative. Other folks would argue that there's enough two way risk to the inflation dynamic where you're meant to keep real yields a little bit positive. And so that's another thing I'm paying attention to other than that, you know, geopolitical risk is always, you know, at the forefront. And you know, I do think there's some peace talks happening that could go well.
00:09:18.213 - 00:09:22.693, Speaker C: So you know, you might actually have a positive catalyst on, on the geopolitical risk side for.
00:09:22.749 - 00:09:53.181, Speaker A: Well that would be nice given all the turmoil that we've seen in a variety of regions. Bim, you were talking about S P and stocks, you know, back near all time highs, gold at all time highs, but yet bitcoin still well below its prior all time high. I mean not, you know, as we Talk now around 60k. We've seen one of the downward pressures on bitcoin has been a significant amount of overhang unloading. Right. Obviously Mt. Gox distributing from June and July and even, even yesterday a small amount.
00:09:53.181 - 00:10:09.885, Speaker A: But you also had the Gemini earn repayments. You had US government movements like. Is that in your mind? Once we get through an overhang, does bitcoin sort of fall back into its sort of more normal long term trajectory or how are you thinking about bitcoin this summer?
00:10:10.425 - 00:11:17.635, Speaker C: Yeah, so one I would say that, you know, you're in a period of illiquidity. It is the middle of the summer and so I think moves in either direction, you know, tended to be exacerbated. I think the market is still digesting a ton of this stock supply, you know, although it seems like there's a lot of folks that aren't selling and if they are selling, they're very methodical and it's just not like a, you know, hit the market like the German government. And so, you know, the supply dynamics haven't been that favorable from the bitcoin side. In addition, the demand side of things from the ETF buyers as well hasn't been there. And I think that speaks to just like a lack of a good narrative at the moment, right. Bitcoin, when you had the strong narrative of Trump being a pro bitcoin candidate, speaking at the conference, et cetera, when his polling was really good, that was a strong catalyst that got people back into bitcoin, believing in the story and really putting risk on.
00:11:17.635 - 00:12:21.623, Speaker C: But ever since then, because his numbers have waned a little bit and you've gotten more negative supply headlines, you've kind of seen bitcoin take a backseat and there's nothing really for market participants to be like, oh, I'm going to buy it because this event is happening or because of this story. And so it's a little less clear as to what storyline people are buying into to buy bitcoin right now. Obviously they're the big long term structural theses that, that are around every day. But in terms of what gets priced back to that 70k area or at least reasonably off of 60k, I do think you need a positive catalyst. That catalyst could come in the form of risk assets just ripping and NASDAQ making fresh highs, S and P making fresh highs, gold making fresh highs. And then folks will be like, oh, okay, I really need to own risk assets because those are really performing. And they'll look at bitcoin as one of the ultimate risk assets in the market.
00:12:21.623 - 00:13:08.829, Speaker C: And so I do think you can have like a drift from the broader macro. But again, in terms of something specific to bitcoin, it's really tough. You know, like one of the things we've had recently is, you know, Saylor has been buying bitcoin, so that's some positive flow. We've seen one of the publicly listed miners in the US announce a quarter billion dollar purchase as well. So there are still positive demand dynamics out there, but it's tricky. And then you've got the government moving around bitcoin and they own $13 billion worth of Bitcoin, so it just doesn't make you feel great about owning it. And then on top of that, you still see consistent overriding flow.
00:13:08.829 - 00:13:19.877, Speaker C: And so it's going to be tough for us to really kind of escape because there's just always so much supply of spot and volume, you know, when you get those spot up followup moves.
00:13:19.941 - 00:13:42.025, Speaker A: Yep, yep, that makes sense. We're, we're in a range. We feel like we're in the range. They're bitcoiners who are called the 58k gang from all the way back in 2021. It's almost been pinned to 58k for a week or two now that look, we're going to, we're going to be here, we're going to be covering it and we will, we'll reconnect next week. Bnet, my friend BB from Galaxy Trading, thank you so much.
00:13:42.475 - 00:13:44.095, Speaker C: Awesome. Thank you for having me.
00:13:46.235 - 00:13:51.667, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, Luca Prospery, CEO co founder of mZero. Luca, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:13:51.811 - 00:13:53.091, Speaker B: Thanks. Thanks for having me.
00:13:53.203 - 00:14:17.793, Speaker A: I'm very excited because we are very interested in stablecoins on this show. We've had a bunch of people on that do stablecoin stuff. Stablecoins are a big deal in American policy. It's one of the main issues that's likely to have legislation. And there's been a lot of innovation in the stablecoin space. It's not just tether anymore, certainly it's not even just tether and circle. You have delta neutral stablecoins.
00:14:17.793 - 00:14:36.655, Speaker A: It's not even just, even in just two years we've had a lot of innovation. I can't wait for you to explain what M0 is and how it works and how it fits into that, because I know it does. But first, before we get into that, what's your story in crypto? How do you go from getting involved and interested in blockchains to founding M0?
00:14:37.195 - 00:15:13.595, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think mine is an interesting story. I mean, I guess everyone thinks their own story is interesting, but I'm a mathematician by background. I spent the first 15 years of my career in traditional finance. I used to be a consultant for banks, an investment banker for banks, a hedge fund manager investing in banks, and a private equity professional buying and selling banks. So that's the, the not so interesting part of my life. I think that at the beginning of the I was playing with bitcoin out of curiosity, but never got too close to crypto. Like at the beginning of the defi summer, things changed and I think for a couple of reasons.
00:15:13.595 - 00:15:38.681, Speaker B: The first one is for the first time in my life I saw that there was an attempt to actually change the back end of Finance, not just the front end, you know, I used to be in financial institutions group in investment bank. And it's the largest team, but nobody knows what. What we do, right, because nobody knows actually how banks work. Most probably not really. So it was for the first time that I saw like an attempt to change it. And it was like these were the Maker days, the compound days.
00:15:38.873 - 00:15:40.841, Speaker A: It was also the yam finance days.
00:15:40.953 - 00:16:12.685, Speaker B: Yeah, it was. It was a very fascinating time. And, and I had free time because during, during COVID I. The first week of COVID I got diagnosed with blood cancer. And I had to step out from business and lock myself in a room for a year to do chemotherapy and try to save my life. So I decided, you know, I didn't like to stay idle and wait for destiny. So I was doing research, playing with protocols, starting writing my own research out of a substack that became quite famous in crypto called Dirt Roads and collaborating with some projects.
00:16:12.685 - 00:16:34.889, Speaker B: Then I went on there, I. I came to the other side alive. And you can imagine I'm making a very long story short, but these things really change you. And I said, you know what, I'm done doing the old stuff over and over again. I actually want to participate to this revolutionary movement that is changing finance forever. And I started to participate to a few protocols. Maker was the most famous one.
00:16:34.889 - 00:17:10.077, Speaker B: I was trying to connect Maker with the real world of lenders. I saw the potential there I was running activist campaigns in defi governance, advising some investors, investing some of my money. And then at the end of 2020, at the beginning of 2023, me and two other co founders, Greg and Oliver, we decided that these protocols were good proofs of concept, but not really scalable in massive, massive, real size. And we decided to found M0. We raised a couple of rounds of funding and scaled the company since the beginning of 2023. And here we are.
00:17:10.141 - 00:17:29.447, Speaker A: And disclosure, Galaxy Ventures as an investor in M0. So what is M0 now? I love this route, by the way. I used to do venture investing when I was at Fidelity. And you know, this tech, you know, the defi landscape, right. And you guys must have. You made this judgment that there was a gap in the market. But what is it in your mind?
00:17:29.551 - 00:18:16.103, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think. So the funny thing of stablecoins like you mentioned before, like there are so many stablecoins because ultimately stablecoins are liability structure of some institution. Like you go to a bank, you have a bank account that's you're pretty much funding a bank to do some Stuff. The difference is that in the current landscape in bank traditional banking, there is some sort of regulation to make uniform the banking practices around the globe. Pretty much in stablecoin is not the case. So there are so many different stable coins, so many different business models behind the stablecoins and some of them are not really interesting to me. For example the circle business where you have, you have a bank account that is storing cash and then you have a digital token that allows you to do stuff within an ecosystem.
00:18:16.103 - 00:19:10.307, Speaker B: What maker at the time was trying to do was more interesting. They were actually innovating monetary creation. So you could actually pledge an asset in a repo type of facility and mint a subset of that asset in stablecoin form that you could use around the globe. On the one hand, hold holders of ETH and Bitcoin could actually lever up their assets. On the other hand, users of stablecoin had a fully fungible, over collateralized, transparent, decentralized, stable to use around the ecosystem. That was very, very powerful intuition, but we thought during our maker days that in order to scale it you need to connect this protocol to the real assets of the large issuers outside of crypto treasuries for example and others. But it was not really possible at the time because of tech, the governance, the characteristics of those protocols.
00:19:10.307 - 00:19:53.065, Speaker B: And that's why we decided to launch M0. So M0 is a few things. Mzero is a protocol that allows permission parties to come, provide a proof of a reserve eligible existing somewhere and mint a stable coin that is over collateralized and is the same across the network. It is a governance module that allows governance token holders to govern and control and oversee this ecosystem. It is an institutional governance module. So it's not a governance for retail, it's a governance that resembles more an on chain consortium than a community. And then it's a tech company that creates tech products to allow people to come and connect.
00:19:53.065 - 00:20:31.881, Speaker B: So in our mind that's why we call it as a middleware. So in our mind we are completely reinventing the way money is created. We are create, we are creating an infrastructure mainly on chain hyper transparent that allows eligible parties to come and connect Mint the same asset, smells the same, has the same type of underlying, is hyper transparent daily or real time attestation. There is a very sophisticated way of distribute yield across the stack and we think this is going to be the infrastructure for stablecoin issuance and design of the future.
00:20:31.953 - 00:20:39.329, Speaker A: So there's multiple institutional, I'm going to say issuers. Would you take issue with that question. Issuers I guess.
00:20:39.377 - 00:20:40.569, Speaker B: No, we call them minters.
00:20:40.617 - 00:20:58.793, Speaker A: Minters. Okay, that makes sense. So you have 1M dollar. Yeah, we call it M. We don't like the dollar, just M. 1M asset type that's fungible to your point. And then let's say big bank comes and they're an eligible participant, they're an eligible mentor.
00:20:58.793 - 00:21:01.617, Speaker A: What kind of collateral can they mint em with?
00:21:01.761 - 00:21:25.057, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think that first of all yes a bank could come but I think it's more interesting for non banks that actually have connectivity to market. Market makers, exchanges, fintechs, the eligible collateral types will evolve with time. Most probably we have a think tank that is going to analyze it. Today is US short term treasury bills.
00:21:25.121 - 00:21:25.529, Speaker A: Makes sense.
00:21:25.577 - 00:21:26.605, Speaker B: Below three months.
00:21:28.705 - 00:21:33.929, Speaker A: No bank deposits and only one type at the moment. Short dated T bills is what you're saying.
00:21:33.977 - 00:21:34.257, Speaker B: Correct.
00:21:34.321 - 00:21:55.713, Speaker A: Got it. That makes sense by the way inherently to me because like maker with its different collateral types, there's different risk weightings and the LTV requirement. I mean if you put treasuries in there and also bitcoin. Bitcoin has a much different volatility profile. Right, but you could, you could. Yeah. With different requirements.
00:21:55.713 - 00:22:02.313, Speaker A: Right. And different. Now do those mentors, what do they gain from participating in this platform?
00:22:02.489 - 00:22:20.115, Speaker B: I think a few things. There are a few reasons. So first of all everyone would love to issue stablecoins, Right. Because stablecoin is a very profitable business. I think you take Tether for example. Tether is an incredibly profitable business. Obviously it's not sustainable, but it's 100% margin business.
00:22:20.115 - 00:22:37.255, Speaker B: So they are funding their operations with a stable coin where they are paying zero and they are investing those assets. It's a bit like imagine you run a hedge fund that has zero hundred percent fee structure. You don't pay management fees but performance fees are 100%.
00:22:37.335 - 00:22:39.315, Speaker A: Yeah, it's pretty good. Yeah.
00:22:39.615 - 00:23:06.755, Speaker B: So everybody wants to actually issue stable coins. Everybody wants to issue digital dollars because they're actually useful. The problem is no one, I mean money in general is a scope economy product. So you need to be big and there are scope economies around. That's why big players tend to be very big. So that there is a huge advantage in having the possibility for everyone to mint the same asset. So like there is a.
00:23:06.755 - 00:23:34.211, Speaker B: Let's say I am an exchange, I don't know, I need stable coins to run my operations, to provide settlement facilities for my clients, et cetera. Now I don't want to do my own stablecoin because it's very Difficult Only if I am Binance, maybe I can do it. And even in the case of Binance, their stablecoin hasn't gone too far. Now imagine if I could mint the same stable like everyone has. Mis minting hyper transparent, superior quality tether as a service.
00:23:34.283 - 00:23:47.669, Speaker A: I see. This is very interesting. So everyone gets the benefit of the technology of the stablecoin. Yes, the fluidity, the blockchain speed and settlement. But also like the same one. And the combined liquidity of it, I guess right. As well.
00:23:47.669 - 00:23:53.005, Speaker A: But also they all get the benefit of as if they had issued their own. And from a treasury and collateral standpoint.
00:23:53.085 - 00:24:18.343, Speaker B: Yes. And they also so that the margin, the interest margin that you can have between what you pay down to the stablecoin issuers and distributors and what actually you retain as asset yield, it's with the issuer. And actually there is also an interesting dynamic you have seen. I can get very nerdy here, so I'll try not to. But you have seen a long list of so called yield bearing stable coins.
00:24:18.399 - 00:24:18.895, Speaker A: That's right.
00:24:18.975 - 00:24:44.295, Speaker B: The market says okay, there is tether, it doesn't give any yield. Circle doesn't give any yield. I'm going to create a product that actually gives 100% of the yield to the users. It's not really a good product if you think about it. Because the ultimate users doesn't really care about the yield. Who cares is the distributor like the large holders. So that you have this phenomenon where everyone is trying to pay back the distributors with the yield and is a race to the bottom.
00:24:44.295 - 00:25:09.311, Speaker B: What we are doing with M0, what they're trying to do with M0 is just flip this completely. So imagine that you start with an issuer and you need to live part of your margin because you need to mint this stable coin. So you have to pay implicitly the protocol for it. But the more liquid the stablecoin becomes, the more utility the stablecoin gets, the more you can widen the spread between the asset and the liability.
00:25:09.423 - 00:25:09.935, Speaker A: Right.
00:25:10.055 - 00:25:15.647, Speaker B: So there is an incentive, growing incentive for people to come on the network and mint the same asset.
00:25:15.751 - 00:25:41.005, Speaker A: That's very interesting. It is flipping it on its head. And you know, I would say there's also with that passing yield back. I think most projects fear American regulation in particular most of the mountain Athena, they're all offshore basically right. For this reason. Whereas this seems like if you don't pass the yield, as far as we can tell, stablecoins are illegal. They are currently legal in the United States.
00:25:41.005 - 00:26:08.573, Speaker A: Maybe some regulations will come that Provide further rules around how to do them. But at the moment Circle offers Tether and I mean Coinbase offers tether and usdc. So that's the biggest American exchange. I think another question I have for you is now, okay, so we have this. It is a different type of setup for a stable, but it sounds like, I mean it's going to be collateralized by the same types of stuff that say Circle is collateralized with, at least in the beginning.
00:26:08.669 - 00:26:09.189, Speaker B: Better.
00:26:09.317 - 00:26:14.357, Speaker A: Yeah, better, yes. Because more diverse minters, first of all.
00:26:14.381 - 00:26:19.997, Speaker B: There is less centralized risk. There is no counterparty risk of bank deposits in.
00:26:20.101 - 00:26:22.245, Speaker A: I see. So in it purely short term treasuries.
00:26:22.285 - 00:26:45.525, Speaker B: Purely short term treasuries completely bankruptcy remote. Actually we are splitting the role of the minter and the collateral storage. So in the case of mZero, m0 is live now. Right? There is one minter. The one minter is a BVI entity and the first collateral storage that has been approved is actually very different. Business is a Luxembourg company, completely orphaned like in securitization. So better.
00:26:45.525 - 00:27:23.085, Speaker B: Funny story. And Circle is a great business so I'm not going to say bad things about it. But you know I, I wrote an article about the risk of the, the huge counterparty risk of, of Circle before svb. A few, through my research, a few crypto builders, they didn't even know it. They, they contacted me, they started changing their depot, the on chain deposits from USDC into diversified pool of stable coins. And two weeks later SVB went under. And if the US government wouldn't have bailed out svb, Circle would have been dead.
00:27:23.465 - 00:27:32.657, Speaker A: Yeah, it was a big hole, right? $3 billion hole. And at the time I think it was in the 30 billion range of total supply. So that's 10%.
00:27:32.761 - 00:27:39.577, Speaker B: Yes. Where peg stability is crucial. So we can do better. We can do better.
00:27:39.601 - 00:27:48.315, Speaker A: So diversified minters, diversified collateral storage and then eventually perhaps diversified collateral types as well. Correct.
00:27:48.655 - 00:28:00.583, Speaker B: And you know, anecdotally the architect and the head of product of USDC at Circle for all Circle's life. Joo actually left Circle and is now running strategy for M0.
00:28:00.679 - 00:28:06.215, Speaker A: Very interesting. So okay, now we have the stablecoin, the Ms. It is dollar pegged, right?
00:28:06.335 - 00:28:07.727, Speaker B: Currently, yeah, could be.
00:28:07.791 - 00:28:19.177, Speaker A: I mean anything I suppose. But whatever it is, they'll all be that same value, right? The unit value, it could be space dollars or God forbid, you know, Chinese ren maybe for all we know, could be anything.
00:28:19.241 - 00:28:23.645, Speaker B: We think dollar I think with dollar is going to be. We are convinced dollar is going to be the reserve.
00:28:24.265 - 00:28:56.529, Speaker A: Yeah, let's ask that question actually because. Well, and it is now. And one of the things I say too is, I mean what in terms of circulating stablecoins apply? It's like 99 + percent of all stablecoins are dollar denominated. The dollar dominates in cyberspace, actually dominates, you know, aside from, I guess, you know, bitcoin is bigger and ether is bigger. But I think digital dollars are third if I'm doing the math correctly in my head. And you think for the foreseeable future. Do you think this is a case? One of the things that some politicians have started to I think recognize.
00:28:56.529 - 00:29:09.165, Speaker A: I think it is true that these types of stablecoins that use US debt as collateral and by the way also track the dollar are additive to the dollar. They're enhancing of the dollar.
00:29:09.785 - 00:29:33.159, Speaker B: I think absolutely. I mean the dollar dollar domination in the so called offshore euro dollar market is a real phenomenon. And the euro dollar market is so complicated, it's so opaque, there is no really good research about it. Estimates say that euro dollar market is around $20 trillion. So imagine if you can have like offshore dollar issuance in a way more systematic and transparent way how big that could be.
00:29:33.207 - 00:29:34.071, Speaker A: Yeah, it could be.
00:29:34.143 - 00:29:40.229, Speaker B: So I think we are the best friends of the US Treasuries. I don't think we are the best friends of commercial banks because we are reinventing.
00:29:40.277 - 00:29:41.389, Speaker A: You are creating money.
00:29:41.517 - 00:30:03.493, Speaker B: We are reinventing monetary intermediation. Yeah, but we, I think we are truly good friends of Treasuries that have. Because I think in the same way bitcoin is so widely spread because it's trusted in the same like US Treasuries are commonly used as collateral across the world because people trust the solvency of the US government.
00:30:03.589 - 00:30:19.493, Speaker A: Yep. Do you think in the. Let's think about the market now for stablecoins today versus perhaps the future or a more forward looking view of digital dollars as the end state or future state. But today we mentioned this. We've alluded to this too. You probably have. I don't have the numbers in front of me.
00:30:19.493 - 00:31:16.525, Speaker A: It's called 70% market dominance by tether, maybe 20% by USDC and then 10% is all these other ones. Most of that my understanding is used for a few use cases. Defi collateral in defi to borrow dollars against a different asset in defi trading settlement. Trading settlement on exchange or in defi. Then you've got a bunch of defi and payments happening with tether primarily on Tron and perhaps you do are starting to have some actual sort of real world remittance activity that merely makes use of one of these stables but a lot of it is crypto native activity. Is that where you think M0 competes in the near term or does this create a step change in functionality unlock that say brings I don't know, big mainstream payment providers, fintech. How do you think about it in the near term? In the near term, yeah.
00:31:16.565 - 00:32:06.655, Speaker B: So I think we should speak near term, long term. I think in the near term M0 competes in DeFi because our the M asset is a pristine asset from an on chain engineering perspective is way smarter in doing yield distribution and composability. So protocols love what we're doing. But in the, in the medium term M0 competes heavily with anything because allows anyone. I mean think about it like today tether is making most of the money and distributors and app layers are doing most of the work. They are providing liquidity, market makers are providing liquidity exchanges are providing distribution capabilities, et cetera, et cetera. We should again flip this upside down.
00:32:06.655 - 00:32:47.581, Speaker B: We should love I mean the mentor in a future in our mind the role of the mentor comes with its own distribution. You're an exchange, you Want to mint M0 and you have your own use case. You're a fintech application, you come you want to mint because you have your own use case. You could buy it in the secondary market but why, why renounce into the margin? So I think that we really have created something that we think can be competitive across the stack. Now we need to. It's the cold start problem, right. You know tether is hyper liquid is everywhere and it's a huge competitive advantage especially when the main use case is retail trading and settlement.
00:32:47.581 - 00:33:31.163, Speaker B: So people don't really care about counterparty risk. But in my mind I mean I think so. I'm a, I'm a mathematician, I like very simple like very high level reasoning and you know there is redux absurdum type of analysis that nothing. There is no sector where a leader is capturing 70% of the market. So even if you think that tether is going to go down to 2030% of the market and most probably the stablecoin space is going to 10x over the next 10 years. There is space for 30 tethers in this market and tether is making more profits than Goldman Sachs. So there is space for 30 Goldman Sachs to be built from a profitability perspective in the next 10 years.
00:33:31.219 - 00:34:10.067, Speaker A: And you think would that likely be a diversity of stablecoin designs? Will we have or are some destined to just on A super long timeframe. And let's talk other aspects of the long term as well. But on this question, for example, Tether's business model where they do very little keep all the yield to themselves. Does that work in the long term or does it get displaced by yield bearing ones like Delta neutral ones or other types or collaborative ones like you know what I mean? Like what does the composition of those 30 look like in an end state in your mind?
00:34:10.131 - 00:34:22.339, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean yeah, I don't think we will have one design. I don't think we will have 30 designs. I think the main use cases, probably the cohorts of use cases are probably three, four and probably we'll have three, four designs.
00:34:22.387 - 00:34:23.003, Speaker A: Got it.
00:34:23.139 - 00:34:53.219, Speaker B: Like I don't know. Circle will still be the best onshore digital dollar alternative for businesses and folks who want to transact in and out the US maybe will stay like this. Tether will continue to dominate certain pockets of the space and others. So in my OTC wholesale use cases are going to be different. I think there will be three, four, between three and five, if I had to guess a number between three and five type of designs.
00:34:53.267 - 00:35:09.677, Speaker A: Interesting dominant designs. Yeah. What do you think about the Delta neutral like the basis trade based stables? Just as an aside, I mean it's quite different than M0. It's also quite different than Tether and Circle. What do you think about. I just love your take on this is a long time observing.
00:35:09.701 - 00:35:09.813, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:35:09.829 - 00:35:33.183, Speaker B: I think it's. I go back to think that stable coins are liability structure on the other side of a balance sheet of some sort of asset strategy. That's what it is. Now the reason why people are trying to market these liabilities as stable coins is because they are inherently giving utility to this product so that they can actually pay less the liability holders at what the market would ask for.
00:35:33.279 - 00:35:34.079, Speaker A: I see.
00:35:34.247 - 00:35:46.661, Speaker B: So it's a good, it's a good way. It's a good marketing tool to market your liabilities. And I think the Athena guys and Guy and the team have done a phenomenal work in structuring it. Now I don't think that trade scales, I think scale its enemy.
00:35:46.733 - 00:35:47.381, Speaker A: I see.
00:35:47.533 - 00:36:04.325, Speaker B: And I think to be dominant in the stablecoin space, you need to scale. So I think the basis trade, even in the case of Athena, I believe that the basis trade, if they continue to be successful will be one of the many strategies of their own asset side of the balance sheet.
00:36:04.405 - 00:36:19.793, Speaker A: I see. That makes sense. And the more they pile in theoretically like the weaker or the more I should say the more dominant they become inside that trade as a percentage of everyone performing that trade should inherently collapse. Right.
00:36:19.929 - 00:36:21.553, Speaker B: Size is your enemy in the basis trade.
00:36:21.609 - 00:36:28.521, Speaker A: Right. So if they do become big, then they kind of undermine the whole certainly the yield that they could gain from it.
00:36:28.553 - 00:36:57.781, Speaker B: The yield, not only the yield, because the basis trade is. You accumulate positive yield and then there are corrections at the times when the market flips. So if the trade becomes very crowded, that positive spread narrows and the correction actually becomes more severe. And this is not the first time basis trade has been in finance forever. Basis trade in emerging markets has been like. There are books written about it.
00:36:57.813 - 00:37:35.039, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think Athena does both Bitcoin and eth basis now if I recall correctly. And funding has been positive basically almost always for those two assets. So the trade again, except for some extremely risk off volatile like right around the FTX collapse, for example, like funding goes negative there, so it can work. But again, yeah, it's an interesting point about scale. In fact, that's how we've thought about stablecoins even before this newer round of the last year or so of innovative stablecoin designs. Algo stables, very scalable because there's nothing there really.
00:37:35.039 - 00:37:58.333, Speaker A: Right. But volatile, risky, et cetera, collateralized with treasury stables. Scalable if it's treasuries. Technologically simple but cost ineffective. Huge capital requirement to scale it. The whole list of trade offs here. Let's talk about the use cases for stables.
00:37:58.333 - 00:38:17.439, Speaker A: You said Defi and Mzero will be a competitive player in the current market and uses of stables, but I'm assuming you're not. You guys didn't build this to play for a piece of a what, $150 billion market? What is the future of stablecoins in your mind? Who's going to be using them and why?
00:38:17.567 - 00:38:20.783, Speaker B: Yeah. So Defi is very small as you said. Right.
00:38:20.839 - 00:38:25.119, Speaker A: Like even I think it's about 150 billion in circulating supply of stables total.
00:38:25.207 - 00:38:34.139, Speaker B: Yeah. So which is probably 1/7 of JP Morgan's balance sheet. So it's very small. Yeah. I don't know the right numbers. I think it's something like that.
00:38:34.307 - 00:38:35.923, Speaker A: It is small. That is small though.
00:38:36.019 - 00:39:44.365, Speaker B: Now I love Defi personally, so I really hope that Defi is going to get bigger and bigger because it's a phenomenal platform shift for finance. And anyone who has worked in large financial institutions knows for a fact that there are so many ways we could improve financial intermediation. So I love Defi. I hope Defi will grow and I think that we more And I hope that more and more what will be important is solvency, composability and certain characteristics instead of off and on ramp. In my dream the crypto economy gets larger and larger and people become less and less worried about going from free to crypto back and forth all the time. But obviously this isn't, I mean its dream in the next 10 years but we are building for that future now we also think that the stablecoin market, I'm convinced the stable coin float will go beyond $1 trillion. You see it like, you know we talk a lot like you mentioned remittances and payments.
00:39:44.365 - 00:40:19.151, Speaker B: I think 30, 40% of funding from venture investors is done in stablecoin form. Because if you are a crypto company it's very difficult to get to be banked not only for the good reasons, also for bad reasons. Like it's difficult. You're international, you're everywhere. It's complicated. Try to explain a bank, it's payments is the same and I think for remittances like people are super interested in using stablecoins builders now every business that builds on stablecoin now has different requirements compared to stablecoin users. In the past when you mentioned tether, people love tether because tether has very narrow spreads when you trade.
00:40:19.243 - 00:40:19.591, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:40:19.663 - 00:41:00.913, Speaker B: Now if you need to have. If you're creating a fintech wallet application in Brazil, I don't know that provides dollar denominated financial services to your clients and remittances and payments. You have a lot of float on your, on your app and you don't really want to run counterparty risk because you're exposed to the counterparty risk for a long time. So the needs are different. So I think that, I mean you've seen the previous generation of fintech it was like a very nice. I remember like when I used to live in London and I actually went to the pitch at Google Ventures, Google incubation of Revolut back in the day, you know Revolut was a very sleek front end behind it. It was Lloyd's tsb.
00:41:00.913 - 00:41:11.025, Speaker B: Right. Every fintech front end had a traditional bank behind it that was just getting the deposits. And I think all those front ends now can connect with through some sort of middleware to the chain.
00:41:11.105 - 00:41:11.649, Speaker A: That's interesting.
00:41:11.697 - 00:41:44.273, Speaker B: So we can just redesign all the financial institutions stacked that we know in web2 type of feel powered by crypto somehow. So I think the use case are going to be many what is going to grow more than others. I think anything that is international in nature it's more prone to innovation. But I think that this sector is going to get bigger and bigger and way beyond retail trading. I hope so because if this is going to remain a retail trading casino obviously we have all failed in our mission.
00:41:44.289 - 00:41:47.147, Speaker A: It doesn't like the life world changing.
00:41:47.251 - 00:42:34.253, Speaker B: Invention and I think we have designed the protocol for this. As I mentioned we were discussing before like in the M0 Federation of Stablecoin Minting Any application that needs to use stablecoins has the ability to come and interact directly with a protocol without giving away the margin to an issuer. There's a third party that is going to aggregate a lot of risk and with the ability of doing yield distribution fully on chain which is no contracts, no KYC kybs on paper like you could do it, you could do it fully on chain. So that's attractive for anyone, right? Any business that wants to connect with the stablecoin infrastructure should be attracted by it. Now we are trying to productize the experience but it's not easy.
00:42:34.349 - 00:43:19.753, Speaker A: It is very interesting. I think your point about operating let's say a prominent fintech app and I mean sending dollars or sending money over, you know, an ERC20 token or an SLC SLP token, whichever the standard is is like orders of magnitude easier to do internationally. I can't even really. I personally don't even really know how to send money abroad. Not really outside of crypto partly because I never had a real need before I got into crypto and in which case I mean I've sent bitcoin, I've sent ether, I've sent stablecoins. I would never even consider trying to wire money to a foreign bank. Some businesses have to but they really should get on board here and try.
00:43:19.769 - 00:43:24.769, Speaker B: To also because you don't even know what's in the middle. Right. There is a bank correspondent bank behind.
00:43:24.817 - 00:43:33.339, Speaker A: It And I think we also don't tell you really. And if one gets lost I'm told like or takes long, can take a long time. You don't even know how long necessarily.
00:43:33.387 - 00:43:33.875, Speaker B: You don't even know.
00:43:33.915 - 00:43:55.811, Speaker A: And they can't really tell you why. Yeah, they don't really. They don't know where it is. I've seen swift payments go missing and then just appear and no one really knows where. And there's cost to that too, right? There's time, opportunity, cost. But there's also. They take float, they take the interest income, the overnight float, they take like there's the intermediaries don't want to give this up.
00:43:55.811 - 00:43:59.975, Speaker A: But I also like your point about the counterparty risk, why not be the mentor yourself?
00:44:00.375 - 00:44:42.753, Speaker B: And I think that there is always the argument that those who use stablecoins are trying to avoid compliance and antimoney laundry and I think this is disingenuous because there is nothing more transparent than blockchain. And I think that we just should do compliance differently with different tools. Like you know I used to work in a large bank, there were very large compliance departments. Now I'm not sure that their compliance tests were the most effective. Actually I know for a fact because all those banks get fined because of that. And I think we could do way better in terms of tracking, in terms of transparency of payments, et cetera. We could do it.
00:44:42.753 - 00:45:23.551, Speaker B: We just need to rethink the way we do it. And I give an example in the M0 so M0 went live on Mainnet on Ethereum Mainnet a few months ago like three months ago. We have like 30, 40 million dollars of TVL. We're not even advertising it because we actually building for a way more ambitious future. But currently the M0 stablecoins have on chain daily attestation of the underlying reserves at the QC level available every day. Minters need to get externals independent validation every day of the underlying collateral that exists with on chain signatures.
00:45:23.623 - 00:45:35.639, Speaker A: This is real so not I mean circles I think at the forefront of the biggest ones in that they include Q sips in their whatever monthly or quarterly letter that they produce in M0.
00:45:35.727 - 00:45:49.375, Speaker B: If you want to have, if you want to be a minter and you don't want to get penalized on chain with penalty fees, you need an external validator who's also approved by governance to provide daily attestation on chain with on chain signatures of the underlying reserve.
00:45:49.415 - 00:46:14.263, Speaker A: Okay, so theoretically I'm business X and I want to be a mentor and I say okay, read the docs, I talk to the or go into the governance of Mzero and I say okay, wow, okay if I deliver 90 day treasuries or less they'll let me mint and if I'm approved and but then they'll say well okay, but where are you going to store those? And I say okay, Walmart store Met Fidelity Investments. So they say yes, Fidelity would have to sign.
00:46:14.359 - 00:46:36.963, Speaker B: No, we are actually more sophisticated than that. So we have actually for example already already published a document that is called Adopted guidance where we provide very detailed guidance on how a minter should be structured, what should be the relationship with the collateral storage, what type of contracts there should be between a Minter and SPV operator. We wrote those contracts with lawyers and we were completely open source.
00:46:37.019 - 00:46:39.299, Speaker A: You have the template contracts and everything.
00:46:39.427 - 00:46:39.883, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:46:39.939 - 00:46:45.611, Speaker A: Oh, so we would say, oh, this is how to become a mentor, legally speaking how we would structure the entity.
00:46:45.643 - 00:46:47.099, Speaker B: That does the get approved by governance.
00:46:47.147 - 00:46:58.339, Speaker A: Get approved by governance. And also now we need to find a custodian for the collateral assets. And this is what it should look like. And here's what the relationship between correct, here's the contract we should sign with.
00:46:58.347 - 00:47:08.523, Speaker B: The custodian and you need to find any. You need to get validated with an external with an independent set of validators which is different from the custodian and different from the minter.
00:47:08.659 - 00:47:09.043, Speaker A: Very interesting.
00:47:09.059 - 00:47:38.521, Speaker B: So he's a third control check the validators today the validation logic can be arbitrarily complex. Today the validator is a company that has the rights to look through APIs that we have designed into the securities accounts and see the events and sign it. But that validation quorum can become arbitrarily complex. It might be two out of three. It can be like a complex chain link type of proof of reserve and everything.
00:47:38.603 - 00:47:43.541, Speaker A: And it could probably look at other not just securities custodians if you had other assets as well.
00:47:43.573 - 00:47:43.717, Speaker C: Right.
00:47:43.741 - 00:48:10.171, Speaker A: So you could have bitcoin custodians that say well you know this minter actually a third of it is bitcoin. So their mint capability is lower because it's more volatile than if it were just cash like cash equivalents. But also, you know, oh, and because it's bitcoin I store it at three different custodians. So and they're all approved but they all have to go through your validator has to have access to all of them to query them for the proof of bitcoin reserves.
00:48:10.323 - 00:49:14.965, Speaker B: And like two interesting additional phenomenon. So the validator in order to be chosen because they provide trust, they have the incentive to improve their tools. Like you know, Chronicle Labs who has been historically the validate the main Oracle provider in the maker ecosystem has asked for approval to become a validator in the M0 ecosystem. I won't be surprised if they were start doing their own dashboards to query independently the reserves of the M0 ecosystem or specific minters in pure crypto open source composable mindset. And also there is the incentive for the minter to get the validations because if the minter today already if the minter doesn't get daily signatures, the minter starts accruing penalty fees which are more expensive than traditional fees. So it's going to be more expensive for them to close the trade and just get access again to their reserve assets.
00:49:15.045 - 00:49:15.837, Speaker A: Got it.
00:49:16.021 - 00:49:18.957, Speaker B: And this is already existing. That is we have already built, is already live.
00:49:19.021 - 00:49:31.471, Speaker A: It's very interesting. It is a very interesting setup. It sounds very safe. It sounds frankly kind of difficult to become a mentor or a custody storage provider. Which I suppose is by design. Right? I mean it's not.
00:49:31.503 - 00:49:50.671, Speaker B: Yeah. In our mind, I mean we don't think the M0 ecosystem, I mean, who knows. But the M0 ecosystem will have, given the current tech will have a thousand minters. I think in the next two years there will be 10 minutes, 10 minters. Right. But it's difficult to do and it's expensive. That's why, I mean the M0 project we have raised through our two rounds.
00:49:50.671 - 00:50:39.941, Speaker B: The first one was led by Pantera and Paul from Pantera sits on the M0 board. And the second round we just closed was raised by Bain Capital, phenomenal crypto and fintech investor, diversified investor, with Stefan joining the board as well, participated. But some of the very best market participants, including Galaxy, Winter, Mute, GSR and Caladan and a few others. You need money to build this. Like we raised around $60 million of funding pre product to build this, which is not little money. It's probably five times the closest competitor in the stablecoin startup scene because we have ambitious projects because frankly I'm convinced that money is a scope economy. So if you want to make a difference, you need to go big.
00:50:40.013 - 00:50:41.717, Speaker A: Yeah, well, it sounds like you are.
00:50:41.861 - 00:50:42.785, Speaker B: We're trying.
00:50:43.085 - 00:51:16.277, Speaker A: I think it's very interesting. I think stablecoins are absolutely one of the purest use cases for blockchains that actually has adoption today and has a pretty bright future. I mean the second you start digging into how dollars move even domestically, even over just. I sent myself money from a Canadian account and accidentally put in a domestic ACH instructions instead of an international wire instructions. It was missing for four months. It did eventually kick back. Just missing though.
00:51:16.277 - 00:51:25.157, Speaker A: They didn't know. And then eventually the Canadian firm just said oh, oh, it's back. Give us the correct ones. Anyone who's looked into that stack knows how broken it is. Yeah.
00:51:25.181 - 00:51:45.005, Speaker B: And also because like we, when we most people, they, they have a current account, they think that the money there or like you get asked for a mortgage and you think that the money they give you is someone else's money. Yeah, it is just a balance. And it's a bank that is right. Writing a number, a balance number somewhere. And there is some sort of internal control. So, like, the guys were not missing your money. They just did.
00:51:45.005 - 00:51:46.345, Speaker B: They couldn't reconcile the bal.
00:51:46.445 - 00:51:46.921, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:51:47.033 - 00:51:54.081, Speaker B: And blockchain happens to be a phenomenal balance reconciler.
00:51:54.153 - 00:52:10.645, Speaker A: Yes, it is. Yes, it does. It's great at that. It's going to be big again no matter what it's tracking. I think your point was well taken there too. Whether it's and I don't suggest it would be not dollar, but it could be a cbdc, it could be a different type of dollar, it could be bitcoin.
00:52:11.665 - 00:52:13.113, Speaker B: It's probably a combination of all those.
00:52:13.169 - 00:52:20.383, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, I think it's very interesting. Luca Prospery, CEO, co founder of M0 thanks for coming on Galaxy Brands.
