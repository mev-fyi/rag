00:00:00.360 - 00:01:01.714, Speaker A: This idea of NFt Ip on a blockchain. So an NFT is a piece of art or intellectual property that lives on a blockchain, and that living on a blockchain makes it, you know, one of one or one of ten makes it scarce. You can prove that it's the only one, right? When we think about Picasso or Rembrandt or Monet, they're valuable because there's so few of them. People can authenticate them because there's experts that have studied this over and over that says, this is the paintbrush stroke of a monet. And so it's hard to. To forge that never existed in the digital world because you could just copy paste, copy paste. The blockchain gives us the ability to make sure things can't be copied and paste.
00:01:01.714 - 00:01:49.144, Speaker A: And that's why we're going to see this explosion of digital art, of multimedia art, of art that is created by the best brains in the world that now feel comfortable and confident that they can build in this new medium. We're going to experience art in lots of ways, like it's always been experienced with friends diving into what it means, why we care about it. NFTs will appreciate in value if they can evoke those emotions, if they can evoke those discussions where we're going to experience it. You know, the jury's still out. I had a fascinating conversation with 225 year old boy geniuses who were trying to get into this space. One was from art world, the other was more of a tech guy. And we were arguing about the metaverse.
00:01:49.144 - 00:02:17.334, Speaker A: In 510 years, will we visit the metaverse like we visit amusement parks? That's how a baby boomer thinks about it. Those Gen Z dudes were like, dude, you're so wrong. You're gonna just live in the metaverse. And I was like, maybe. Who knows? The future's gonna play that out. And so what's important to know about NFTs is we're in, like, the first out of the first inning of the World Series. You know, like, we're just starting.
00:02:17.334 - 00:02:58.844, Speaker A: What scares me a little bit is the value of the architecture is a lot bigger than the value of the NFTs right now. And so that probably tells me nfts can keep going up before they crash. It also tells me the market's not irrational. People believe this will be a way that artists, creatives, musicians, try to monetize their iPad, where brands do, and that's not going away. This is not a fad. And so they're more willing to invest in the architecture, because the art is so new. And so the bet is in three years, in four years, in five years, there'll be a lot more differentiation over what people care about.
00:02:58.844 - 00:03:26.152, Speaker A: So this is a golden LeBron James. It's my first big purchase in cards. It cost me over a million dollars. And my mother looked at me, she says, are you crazy? Well, you know what? She said I was crazy when I bought bitcoin. She said I was crazy when I invested in mushrooms. My mom likes to think I'm crazy. And I was like, well, maybe I'm crazy, but maybe I'm not.
00:03:26.152 - 00:03:42.104, Speaker A: Like, this isn't buying a basketball. LeBron James isn't just, this isn't a golden LeBron James basketball card. LeBron James is a golden human being. Like he's the Muhammad Ali of this next generation. He's a leader. He makes hard decisions. He's a supporter of just causes.
00:03:42.104 - 00:04:19.544, Speaker A: One day, LeBron James could be the goddamn president of the United States, and I got his rookie card. This thing is going to be worth more money. Plus, we've got fractionalization coming. We're going to make the distribution of a peaceless LeBron James card much easier for everyone to participate in. Collectibles are going up because of the debasement of fiat money, because we're printing so much money. Gen Z, millennials, everybody these days is finding new ways to store their value, and unique collectibles are going up. There are not very many of these golden LeBron James cars.
00:04:19.544 - 00:04:46.914, Speaker A: There are not many LeBron James in the world who deserves a car that people all want to cherish. He is the best athlete of his generation. So for me, this is an easy buy. Very few people that transcend the moment. LeBron James transcends the moment. But you're seeing collectibles, all kinds of collectibles, from bobbleheads to digital collectibles to now nfts. It's all part of the same movement of people realizing I can store value in other ways.
00:04:46.914 - 00:05:11.846, Speaker A: Bitcoin literally is. I'm the bitcoin guy. Partly because I believed early that this was a unique way for people to store value. And I think that spectrum is pretty wide. There's already enough consumers to make this a huge business. Guys my age are excited about it for different reasons. They're excited about its investment.
00:05:11.846 - 00:06:05.724, Speaker A: They're excited about it because it makes them feel younger and, okay, let's understand where our kids are going, where the world's going, because they have brands that might market there, right? Every brand is going to figure out how to market in the, in this digital way, in this metaverse. With NFTs, a brand that doesn't jump on board is going to miss out on a giant consumer base. This is only going to grow. And so again, if I was, I don't think anyone's smart enough to know exactly how this is going to play out, what the chessboard will look like. But we know there's huge energy, there's huge creative energy, there's finance coming in, there's huge technical energy, there's use creative. And so something wonderful is going to happen in the space. Do your homework on what platform you're buying on, right? So you can get wonky and technical.
00:06:05.724 - 00:07:05.800, Speaker A: One of the issues with NFTs is you have a key that lives on a blockchain. Well, what blockchain does it live on? Some live on the flow blockchain, some live on the Ethereum blockchain, some live on, you know, independent blockchains with the ability to go to the Ethereum blockchain. If, for instance, the flow blockchain ceased to exist, your NFT would cease to exist. Are all the pixels on that digital piece of performance art in that key? No. In most cases, the key gives you the right to a database where those things live. Well, Jesus, if that database gets hacked, how safe is my NFT? Before you put huge money on these things, you should do some homework. On what product? Where's the data stored? Is the data being safely stored? Is it actually written into the chain? Is it on chain? Or is the key a link to something that's off chain? Again, NFTs is such a broad subject.
00:07:05.800 - 00:07:35.624, Speaker A: There will be nft art, nft beautiful art. Put people in there, right, where someone collects it because they think it's awesome. Art that evokes something that's very analogous to the physical art world. There'll also be game parts that are NFTs. I'm in dungeons and dragons, and I've decided I want to buy this sword to help me in the next game. And I use that sword to kill some dragon. To be fair, I've never played dungeons of dragon, so I'm making this MNF war up, but all of a sudden it becomes more valuable.
00:07:35.624 - 00:08:04.784, Speaker A: I might want to keep that sword in my virtual, you know, man cave alongside my baseball memorabilia. Some games will let you take goods, you know, game parts out of their ecosystems. Right now, most don't. Right? And so if you. If you play on, what's the big one, Fortnite? All that money that gets spent every year on Fortnite, it stays in the Fortnite ecosystem. So Fortnite shuts down. All that shit I bought is worthless.
00:08:04.784 - 00:08:34.638, Speaker A: Consumers are going to demand that that becomes transportable in time. And so if you spent $80 or 800 or 8000 on a sword, you'll be able to keep that sword. So that's a different mindset than collecting art. NFTs in the collectible area are probably going to get overvalued and price is going to come down. Same thing in the fine art area. But I think investing in NFT infrastructure is probably still a good investment. We're not sure which ones are going to win.
00:08:34.638 - 00:09:08.776, Speaker A: Right. There's Opensea, there's nifty gateway. There are 15 other projects coming down the pipe. There's dapper Labs that's raising a ton of money. There's mythical games, which is a game studio that's pivoted to doing nfTs. There are new projects that haven't been announced yet that I know of, like five of. And so we're so early on, it's like saying which crypto company was going to do well in 2014, there will continue to be money pouring into the system and infrastructure, and as long as the crypto prices hold up, which I think they will, people are gonna take some of that money and do fun things with it.
00:09:08.776 - 00:09:36.612, Speaker A: Nfts are fun things with it. Right? And so just like in the real world, if you get a big bonus, you might buy a piece of art for your house or at least a new tv or, you know, take your girlfriend on a great dinner. Listen, Mark Cuban's out there. He's pro crypto. He's pro nfts. Ashton Kutcher has been one of the actors who's done the best job of getting into venture. He was a wrestler.
00:09:36.612 - 00:09:53.280, Speaker A: So I've got a lot Aston Kutcher group in Iowa. So a little shout out to all the wrestlers. Snoop Dogg. Snoop Dogg, I already told you, is one of my favorite guys. And so it's good energy coming into the space. Like it tells you that people care about the space right now. Some guys will.
00:09:53.280 - 00:10:13.164, Speaker A: Oh, that's what a top is. No, it's not what a top is. Like. We're so early on again, we might have a tempest in a teapot. Prices get ahead of themselves and come back down. This is, we're going to lay architecture for an entire multi generational shift on how people use digital formats to protect their ip. And that's going to be really cool.
00:10:13.164 - 00:10:24.334, Speaker A: Channel.
