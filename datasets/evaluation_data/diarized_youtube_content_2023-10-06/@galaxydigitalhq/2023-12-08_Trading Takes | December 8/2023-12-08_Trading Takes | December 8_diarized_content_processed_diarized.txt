00:00:08.240 - 00:00:12.358, Speaker A: Let's go to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:12.446 - 00:00:13.422, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:13.518 - 00:00:34.564, Speaker A: It's been a wild week. We were 38k bitcoin over the weekend, and we ran to then we didn't stop running and we ran to $44,000 currently, effectively there, 43,965 as we talk. But good gosh, what have you seen?
00:00:34.724 - 00:01:49.356, Speaker B: Genuinely, I'm amazed at the price action, but I think it speaks to convexity of thought, right, and the positive feedback loop that positive price action has. And so, put differently, people start to fomo, the higher the price goes and the rationale associated or attributed to why the price is going starts to make more and more sense or gets more and more validated as price continues to increase. And so I think what you're seeing is basically all of the merits of bitcoin and the positive catalysts that are coming, becoming more and more evident to more and more people. And it's coming at a time when broader risk markets are trading really well. It's coming at a time when the Fed is likely to be cutting and not putting a drag on financial markets. And it comes at a time that's before the ETF and the happening. And so there's just a lot of pieces that are coming together, and I think folks are probably still dramatically underestimating the amount of flows that are just going to come into this product.
00:01:49.356 - 00:02:39.160, Speaker B: Once an ETF is there. Basically for 14 years of bitcoin's existence, it's been one of the hardest products to own, ever or to trade. You go on your coinbase or whatever app you're on, the spreads are ridiculous. Custodying it, not being sure whether the place you're custodying it really has your tokens, not being sure the exchange is real, not being able to get financing or borrowing. There's so many things that get solved, right? You enter into the ecosystem that is all of these retirement funds that just accumulate assets, all these passive flows. And then lastly, and most importantly, the biggest people in the world are telling you that this is a real asset and it belongs in your portfolio. I don't care who the hell you are.
00:02:39.160 - 00:02:47.068, Speaker B: When Larry Fink gets on fucking tv and tells you it's a safe haven and is about to launch a huge.
00:02:47.116 - 00:02:48.268, Speaker A: Product and you're about to need it.
00:02:48.276 - 00:02:55.156, Speaker B: I don't care who you are, how smart you are. That man has $10 trillion in assets under management. Yeah, he speaks, you listen.
00:02:55.220 - 00:02:55.844, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:02:56.004 - 00:03:19.008, Speaker B: And so I think there's just been a complete paradigm shift in the thinking around crypto, and rightfully so. And now people are like, oh, shit, bitcoin is at. I'll tell you how hard it is in this market. I'm a bitcoin bull. I've been one. And everybody can listen to the podcast, go back a year. They know, they know Alex Thorne is an OG.
00:03:19.008 - 00:03:47.284, Speaker B: Bitcoiner goes way, way back. And we're still shocked at this price action. A little bit. But in theory, it's so crazy. It's like, why are we so scared of our thesis being, right, right. This is the manifestation of all that we have been talking about for years, just manifesting itself on price, and it's gonna continue. Why couldn't you be at 60k in two weeks?
00:03:47.364 - 00:03:48.140, Speaker A: No, you could.
00:03:48.212 - 00:03:51.028, Speaker B: I personally don't like assets that rush up in value that.
00:03:51.076 - 00:03:58.974, Speaker A: No, I agree. You wanna settle a bit. That's what was nice in the thirties. We sort of like gained steam ground up, but built a better base down there. Yeah.
00:03:59.084 - 00:04:05.706, Speaker B: But now it's just. It's getting a little uncomfortable. But I don't think that's gonna deter people.
00:04:05.810 - 00:04:06.234, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:06.314 - 00:04:20.858, Speaker B: It might encourage more and more of them, to be honest with you. But you know what, the last thing I wanna touch on, or not the last, but one of the things I wanna touch on is just the supply side dynamics. Right? Like you've talked about how much supply hasn't moved in over a year.
00:04:20.906 - 00:04:21.970, Speaker A: It's like 80%.
00:04:22.122 - 00:04:23.354, Speaker B: 80%, yeah.
00:04:23.434 - 00:04:25.746, Speaker A: That doesn't happen in financial assets. Yeah.
00:04:25.770 - 00:04:28.022, Speaker B: The float of this thing is really small.
00:04:28.138 - 00:04:28.670, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:28.782 - 00:04:36.398, Speaker B: And like, I just don't know. Like there's gonna be an inflection point in the flow that takes you to.
00:04:36.446 - 00:04:37.142, Speaker A: Tips it all the way over.
00:04:37.158 - 00:04:45.430, Speaker B: Just tips it all the way over where there's just no offer side liquidity. Could that come at like 3 billion of incremental flow? Could that come at six? I'm not sure.
00:04:45.502 - 00:04:46.046, Speaker A: Right.
00:04:46.190 - 00:04:54.126, Speaker B: But if we're talking about an ETF product, that's likely gonna draw at least 10 billion in assets, like, you're gonna. It's gonna happen.
00:04:54.190 - 00:05:23.374, Speaker A: So one thing I looked at along these lines was the, you know, if you look on like glass node or other tools, you can see the long term holder supply versus the short term holder supply. You can bucket that any way you want. I think for that specific metric, they say 155 days held or longer. That's long term, 155 days or shorter. And they have a methodology for why they picked that. But you could look at any timeframe, you could say a year versus within moved last three months. Whatever it is, the long term holders are still accumulating.
00:05:23.374 - 00:05:41.804, Speaker A: They're going up. Of the last two, like December 2017 and fall 2021, bull market tops. Those long term holders eventually sell to short term holders and they dip. Right. Which makes sense. Right. Because the market is searching.
00:05:41.804 - 00:05:47.500, Speaker A: It has demand from new entrants and it's searching for a price at which the long term holders will give it to them.
00:05:47.572 - 00:05:48.020, Speaker B: Correct.
00:05:48.132 - 00:06:12.996, Speaker A: You haven't seen any decline. You see a continued increase in long term holder supply, which to me tells me that, well, it absolutely says, well, we're definitely not at the top. Like, because long term holders did not hold. Imagine if you even bought higher than this or even bought lower than this. Hold. Hold through everything we just went through the last two years, and then you're like, you know, 43k, that's my number. Who's selling at these levels? Right? Like, doesn't make sense.
00:06:13.060 - 00:06:14.092, Speaker B: Doesn't make any sense.
00:06:14.228 - 00:06:30.898, Speaker A: And you can see it also in exchange balances in a variety of other metrics. We're just not there yet. And to your point, there are plenty of reasons for it to go higher. There's narrative events, there's market access, vehicles, actual supply. Actual supply things happening. So it's an exciting thing. Exactly.
00:06:30.946 - 00:06:48.354, Speaker B: I mean, I think a lot of assets, especially ones with as much frenzy as crypto and bitcoin. Like you typically top with a blow off top candle, right? Like with a blow off. Like, it moves 10,000 points in a day and it's like, oh, my God, this go into infinity. You really haven't had that moment yet.
00:06:48.394 - 00:06:48.738, Speaker A: No.
00:06:48.826 - 00:06:50.434, Speaker B: And you're not even at all time highs.
00:06:50.474 - 00:07:17.808, Speaker A: I mean, the price action from 28 to 35, and then the grind that we did for like two and a half weeks, where we just sort of grind it up to 40. That was one of the most bullish charts I've ever seen. It was like. It was flat. It was a relatively tight range, but not actually flat, just slightly higher and higher and higher. But like, clear trend, high lows, higher true channel. It shows significant ongoing bid.
00:07:17.808 - 00:07:34.180, Speaker A: Right. And we know where some of it's coming from. We've seen sailor in the market. We've seen retail aggregators. And the other thing that I like about this is that we know this anecdotally from our business. Like, there's not a lot of institutions in yet. You can see that there's some institutional money.
00:07:34.180 - 00:07:35.996, Speaker A: If you look like CME shows us.
00:07:36.060 - 00:07:37.732, Speaker B: We think those are consistently high baseball.
00:07:37.748 - 00:07:46.532, Speaker A: But we know, I know a lot of institutional traders that, like, this asset class, may even have traded it in the past, and they're not in yet. And the pain traded for them is higher.
00:07:46.628 - 00:07:53.202, Speaker B: Yeah. I was speaking to a shop today that managed over ten yards or $10 billion in money, and they still can't touch it.
00:07:53.258 - 00:07:53.854, Speaker A: Right.
00:07:54.554 - 00:07:55.146, Speaker B: And so.
00:07:55.210 - 00:07:59.242, Speaker A: But I even mean, of the ones I know can touch it, many of them are just not back yet, and.
00:07:59.258 - 00:08:09.442, Speaker B: They'Re not in real size. And you know what's the crazy part is all of those folks have. They had a small allocation to bitcoin this year. I mean, they'd be crushing their peers.
00:08:09.498 - 00:08:13.450, Speaker A: I mean, if you bought at the beginning of the year, you're up this.
00:08:13.482 - 00:08:20.078, Speaker B: Year, really, with a small portion of your portfolio, it would have been risk reducing.
00:08:20.126 - 00:08:22.078, Speaker A: We've done the math on that. It is.
00:08:22.166 - 00:08:30.350, Speaker B: And again, it's so crazy. I mean, in this meeting today, it's just like. It's just. The guy was like, it's so hard to ignore this thing. It's up 150%.
00:08:30.422 - 00:08:54.694, Speaker A: Wait until it happens again. That's what I'm saying. Let's say you have the mandate to do it. You're one of the funds that actually can already gain access, and you haven't this cycle. Yeah, we hit. Let's say we hit 50. Just for simple math, you're telling me that in just the last three months, you missed a 65% move in an asset? You're bullish on that you have a mandate to invest in? Wake up, portfolio managers.
00:08:54.694 - 00:09:01.702, Speaker A: This thing is not. And by the way, I say this, it might feel like you're late, but like we're saying they're not. People aren't here yet.
00:09:01.838 - 00:09:02.278, Speaker B: I agree.
00:09:02.326 - 00:09:03.430, Speaker A: Look at the Google searches.
00:09:03.462 - 00:09:43.290, Speaker B: No, no. Yeah, there's nothing. Got room to go. Yeah. So I think you're hitting on an interesting point. Point where you've kind of flipped in the sense that, let's say, at the start of this year, if you're a risk manager trying to get crypto into a portfolio, when you go up to your board or whoever makes the final decisions, it used to be that it was more risk than it was worth. If you're a treasury manager or somebody managing a large pool of money, like, why are you gonna stake your reputation on this thing? And now it's like, why didn't you?
00:09:43.362 - 00:09:43.834, Speaker A: Right?
00:09:43.954 - 00:09:45.938, Speaker B: And so the tables have so turned.
00:09:45.986 - 00:09:46.814, Speaker A: Oh, they have.
00:09:49.674 - 00:09:50.074, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:09:50.114 - 00:09:55.394, Speaker A: That was great. They really have. I mean, again, like. And it will be more true than talking about bitcoin.
00:09:55.434 - 00:09:58.098, Speaker B: Like, there's so much else going on in crypto right now. So many.
00:09:58.146 - 00:09:59.058, Speaker A: There really is. But.
00:09:59.146 - 00:10:02.010, Speaker B: But it's like, it's not even relevant. I mean, in the context of.
00:10:02.082 - 00:10:18.890, Speaker A: There is interesting stuff. Well, let's save it for another day, because the bitcoin move, it really did. I mean, even last week, I think you rightly said, and I've said, too, that, like, you know, it'd be reasonable for us to have a healthy little dip here. It's been. We've been grinding higher. We're up huge. Like, I still think that, by the way, I don't think.
00:10:18.922 - 00:10:21.330, Speaker B: Yeah, I know. Happen in bull trends all the time. Yeah.
00:10:21.402 - 00:10:25.322, Speaker A: Yeah. And that's. That's good. I think that helps solidify a base and stuff.
00:10:25.378 - 00:10:28.106, Speaker B: So you're not wrong in alts all the time.
00:10:28.170 - 00:10:32.050, Speaker A: I mean, like, you had 20% correction a couple days ago.
00:10:32.122 - 00:10:33.202, Speaker B: Yeah, pretty much everything.
00:10:33.298 - 00:10:35.026, Speaker A: Bitcoin went down, like, 1%. Yeah.
00:10:35.050 - 00:10:42.254, Speaker B: I mean, like, the. The bitcoin Defi tokens. I've had a big correction last year. I'm like, oh, my God. And now they're back up.
00:10:44.434 - 00:10:51.674, Speaker A: I mean, they're, like, levered. I mean, almost everything in this space is effectively levered. Bitcoin. Right. Like, everything from a beta standpoint.
00:10:51.714 - 00:10:52.594, Speaker B: Yeah. Except stable coins.
00:10:52.634 - 00:10:58.906, Speaker A: Yeah. Except salesperson. That went to three exits. Yeah. I don't know what it was.
00:10:58.970 - 00:11:00.506, Speaker B: It was, like, the new euro stable.
00:11:00.570 - 00:11:05.570, Speaker A: There's a euro stable that, like, was trading at $3 instead of $1 or €3 instead of whatever.
00:11:05.642 - 00:11:06.058, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:06.146 - 00:11:11.610, Speaker A: Things can get wacky out there. Look, let's wrap it here, because it still feels like a bitcoin story.
00:11:11.802 - 00:11:12.866, Speaker B: Long love bitcoin.
00:11:12.930 - 00:11:15.634, Speaker A: Yeah. Bim Netabeebee from galaxy trading, my friend. Thank you, as always.
