00:00:11.412 - 00:00:13.210, Speaker A: Closer to 800, but who's counting?
00:00:13.290 - 00:00:21.150, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's, and we had a material, I mean, huge move earlier in the week. Absolutely. What do you make of this apparent renewed optimism?
00:00:21.650 - 00:00:52.490, Speaker A: I think it's entirely warranted heading into a cattle list that is highly probable. It was driven by a number of things, but one of the main things was a short squeeze, particularly in the option side of things. The street was generally positioned pretty short gamma into this break. In addition, you had a ton of folks shorting bitcoin at the yearly highs, and a ton of I ended up getting wiped out right on the perps.
