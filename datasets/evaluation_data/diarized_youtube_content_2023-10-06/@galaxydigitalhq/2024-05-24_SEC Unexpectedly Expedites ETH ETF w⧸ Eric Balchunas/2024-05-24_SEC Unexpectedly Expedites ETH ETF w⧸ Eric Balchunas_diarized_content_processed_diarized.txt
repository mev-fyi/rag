00:00:00.760 - 00:00:11.078, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, an infinite amount of cash. Cash. I'm your host, Alex Thornton. The us banking system is sound and resilient. Bitcoin made a new all time high.
00:00:11.246 - 00:00:13.714, Speaker B: If you're not long, if you're not long, you're short.
00:00:14.014 - 00:00:17.702, Speaker C: Satoshi's gonna come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet.
00:00:17.798 - 00:00:19.550, Speaker B: All bitcoin's gonna be erased.
00:00:19.742 - 00:00:20.462, Speaker D: Bitcoin.
00:00:20.558 - 00:00:22.234, Speaker A: Bitcoin's the best crypto else.
00:00:22.894 - 00:00:24.914, Speaker B: Bitcoin is going to zero.
00:00:25.334 - 00:00:55.964, Speaker A: Welcome back to Galaxy Brains. I'm your host, Alex Thorne. Thank you for listening. We have a great show for you today. Senior ETF analyst from Bloomberg Intelligence, Eric Balchunis, is our guest. We'll get into it with Eric about the apparent about face the SEC seems to be making on the approval process for the Ethereum spot. Ethereum ETPs, if you're listening, the day this comes out, Thursday, May 23, we think that we will get 19 before ETH ETF approvals today, which is the exchanges being approved to list the products.
00:00:55.964 - 00:01:17.308, Speaker A: There will be more time to come before the products themselves go live. And we'll get into those specifics with Eric. Of course, we'll check in with our good friend Bimnadabibi from Galaxy trading is always about markets. It's kind of a classic Alex and Bimnet rant about the state of the american fiscal and monetary situation. If you listen and like this show, I think you'll like that discussion. Before we get to any of that, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to the disclaimer in the podcast. Notes.
00:01:17.308 - 00:01:49.316, Speaker A: Note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Wow, the winds are blowing. The times are changing. Crypto is on the national political scene. A lot has happened in the last few weeks. Former President Donald Trump said that if you like crypto, you should vote Trump. His campaign now raising money, saying that they're raising a crypto army, which is directly positioning the campaign against a pretty iconic and infamous Elizabeth Warren ad that said she was raising an anti crypto army.
00:01:49.316 - 00:02:42.190, Speaker A: And then the House voted on SAP 121 to overturn this arcane SEC accounting rule that was prohibiting banks from custodying crypto, with 21 Democrats voting in support and then twelve democratic caucusing members in the Senate, eleven Democrats and one independent cinema from Arizona voted also to overturn all of that, despite an explicit veto threat from the White House. Now that was last week, and the White House hasn't vetoed that bill yet. If they don't veto it in ten days, it will become law. But also then on Monday, we have this apparent shift in position in the approval process for the Ethereum ETPs that had issuers scrambling issuers in exchanges, scrambling to get these edited 19 b four s back into the SEC for what looks like immediate approval on those. So maybe we have ethereum spot. ETF's coming soon. You have to wonder about the timing of that shift.
00:02:42.190 - 00:03:36.534, Speaker A: And then today, actually moments ago, as we record this, on Wednesday, May 22, the US House of Representatives voted to pass, passed the Fit 21 act, which is the financial innovation and technology for the 21st Century act. This is comprehensive crypto market structure reform. This bill, which passed with 71 Democrats voting yes, would create a comprehensive regulatory structure for crypto in the US. It would draw clear lines between when the CFTC has jurisdiction and when the SEC has it. It would create rules about token issuers and developers, about how they have to disclose technology risks, ownership. Investors that own certain thresholds, 5% or so, would have to disclose their ownership in those tokens, and a variety of other generally great things. Although it is a comprehensive bill.
00:03:36.534 - 00:04:11.460, Speaker A: You know, 71 Democrats voted for this, including former speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. That's more than triple the 21 who voted last week in the face of that White House veto threat. Interestingly, earlier this morning, the White House did not threaten explicitly to veto fit 21. And you have to wonder, because of the two bills, if you were intent and you were anti crypto, of the two bills, fit 21 is significantly more consequential, in my opinion, than SAB 121. So if you only vetoed one, you would veto fit 21. Think. But very interesting.
00:04:11.460 - 00:04:51.690, Speaker A: It signals, I think, a change in the White House's political strategy that they didn't threaten to veto fit 21 anyway. It passed with a fairly large contingent of democratic support. And you have to wonder now, we were somewhat bearish on the idea that the Senate might even take up this bill. There's really not a lot of time left in the legislative's calendar. I mean, they're gonna go on vacation for the summer, and then by the time you get back, it's basically the campaign season. But with this level of democratic support, I think the odds are significantly increased that the Senate will feel obligated to act. It's not clear if they'll take this up or if they'll take their own approach or merge something or do anything at all.
00:04:51.690 - 00:05:30.074, Speaker A: But I would say this is the most bipartisan vote in crypto legislative history. SAB 121 last week was the first time Congress ever passed a crypto specific bill, and this is a significant milestone. And there's a lot in this thing. It probably won't become law this year, but nonetheless, from a political standpoint, I think it's again fair to say that crypto is quite bipartisan and it looks to be trending more. So. I don't know, but it's a big part of it. And I actually think the Ethereum ETF story, it's possible that that's actually just a piece of this bigger story of the shifting political winds in crypto.
00:05:30.074 - 00:05:37.962, Speaker A: Let's hop right into the show. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading Bimnett. Welcome back to Galaxy Brains.
00:05:38.018 - 00:05:39.642, Speaker D: Thanks for having me. Love your sneakers.
00:05:39.698 - 00:05:44.398, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you. I took off the, you didn't like the, the low, the Nike dunks I was wearing. I don't want to eat.
00:05:44.446 - 00:05:45.302, Speaker D: He's wearing pandas.
00:05:45.358 - 00:06:08.286, Speaker A: Apparently they're just kind of playing not okay. Yeah, well, look, I mean, the big news in our market this week is this apparent 180 shift in the ETH ETF approval process with the SEC. We don't have to go in depth on this because we also have Eric Balchunis coming up next on the show to talk about that specifically. But either that or what else is on your mind in markets this week when you're watching the lines and numbers?
00:06:08.390 - 00:06:40.850, Speaker D: Yeah, ETH, definitely. Very notable, most notable thing in crypto. I think it represents a big shift in the sort of political and regulatory landscape for crypto. I think the ramifications will be felt for years to come. As far as the actual product that the ETF is providing, I think there are some obvious deficiencies in terms of staking fees and the ability to do stuff on chain and stuff, but I'm assuming Dalcunis will go through that stuff.
00:06:40.922 - 00:07:09.244, Speaker A: I agree with that, by the way. Like, we were talking about this earlier, like, I feel like the delta and functionality between the spot and the ETF for bitcoin is much narrower than the delta between the spot and ETF for ETH in that you can't buy, you can't send or receive on chain your bitcoin if it's in an ETF and you don't, and you lack self custody so you don't have the same level of censorship resistance. But if you're a hodler, yeah, those are really modeling.
00:07:09.584 - 00:07:13.544, Speaker D: If you're a Hodler, the ETTF is not a great product.
00:07:13.624 - 00:07:15.784, Speaker A: Right. Because you would stake, you might even restake.
00:07:15.864 - 00:07:16.144, Speaker D: Correct.
00:07:16.184 - 00:07:23.008, Speaker A: You certainly can't. And Ethereum has, I think been successful because it has such a robust on chain financial market.
00:07:23.136 - 00:07:23.472, Speaker D: Correct.
00:07:23.528 - 00:07:24.440, Speaker A: Which you can't access.
00:07:24.552 - 00:07:24.864, Speaker D: Correct.
00:07:24.904 - 00:07:33.536, Speaker A: So like there's many more features of Ethereum that you can't use if you do the ETF. But, you know, nonetheless, it's also highly convenient to hold an ETF. We talked about how it's no.
00:07:33.560 - 00:07:56.054, Speaker D: And you can get, you know, margin financing for it. And so there are some benefits. But fundamentally for folks looking to buy and hold for the future, you're in a product that is not ideal. Like the ideal form of owning ETH is you own eth, you stake it, maybe you restake it and you self custody it.
00:07:56.754 - 00:08:14.096, Speaker A: Yeah, I hear you. Still a sea change, though. And probably a similar class of investor that we've highlighted, the, primarily the advisors on the wealth platforms, the bank and broker dealer platforms, they really can't put their clients into some stake product. I'm not aware of one for them. So still, I think a big deal. But anyway. Yeah.
00:08:14.160 - 00:08:17.280, Speaker D: And then the grayscale product also charges you a 2% management fee.
00:08:17.312 - 00:08:27.816, Speaker A: Yeah, we're not sure what they're going to do with that. Right. I mean, they were two at GVDC and then they lowered it to 1.5%, which is still what's five times higher than the average other competitor.
00:08:27.960 - 00:08:34.416, Speaker D: But there's $11 billion of supply that is now available to be redeemed.
00:08:34.480 - 00:08:50.918, Speaker A: Well, will be in cash at some point, I should say, too. We don't, we get more into this with Belcher, but we don't know exactly when these would go live yet. What we're talking about is the 19 B four process. Let's move on because we got a whole conversation with Eric after this about that. What else are you looking at? I mean, it doesn't feel like a huge macro week, really.
00:08:51.046 - 00:08:51.590, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:08:51.702 - 00:09:23.064, Speaker D: I think what's notable in macro has been the strength in the commodity complex recently. Gold is hovering around high 2300s. It broke through 2400 all time high areas. Silver had a breakout through 30 multi year highs. Like it wants to trend higher. We've seen things like platinum trade. Well, today, nat gas was on a tear because of some concerns in Europe around a shortage.
00:09:23.064 - 00:10:23.456, Speaker D: And so there's a lot of commodities that have become very topical and kind of uncorrelated to broader markets. And those things are very notable. And a lot of the change you're seeing in those markets is very structural in nature in terms of foreign central banks and foreign sovereign wealth funds, and really thinking through the de dollarization, the focus on kind of hard assets. And so you've seen basically the Chinese buy a ton of gold, like places like India buy silver, and that's, again, to kind of get away from the us dollar in a way. And then ultimately, I think what matters for markets on the next six months is really the election. You've got two very different outcomes for markets based on who wins. We've talked about trumponomics in two episodes ago.
00:10:23.480 - 00:10:26.152, Speaker A: That's a great conversation, by the way. You should go back and listen if you didn't hear that one.
00:10:26.248 - 00:11:07.860, Speaker D: But high level Trump means tariffs, which is inflationary. It means folks getting deported like crazy. So labor shortages also probably means permanent tax cuts and increases in defense spending. So it's very inflationary and also, for the geopolitics, presents some more risks. And so that's kind of the inflationary backdrop. I think either president is probably going to be good for stocks, and then on the other side, you might have some tax increases. You might have, I would say both parties.
00:11:07.860 - 00:11:10.348, Speaker D: Whoever wins is gonna be bad for the fiscal situation.
00:11:10.516 - 00:11:16.532, Speaker A: Yeah, I was gonna say it doesn't feel like Trump didn't cut when he was in office. He spent a lot. They're both populists, really.
00:11:16.708 - 00:11:58.400, Speaker D: Exactly. And so I would say in the Biden administration as well, you're probably gonna see a more honest reaction to inflation from fed officials in terms of their willingness to potentially even hike rates or hold rates higher for longer versus under Trump, he's going to appoint officials that are going to be more inclined to cut sooner rather than later. And treasury policy, that's a little bit more lenient. And so it's a tale of two presidents, and that I think as you start to see the Trump odds increase or decrease, you'll see the market move in one direction or the other. But those are really, I mean, the election is really the next big thing.
00:11:58.462 - 00:12:01.172, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a big deal for crypto, too. We're starting to find out.
00:12:01.348 - 00:12:03.580, Speaker D: Like I was saying, crypto might win either way.
00:12:03.652 - 00:12:22.748, Speaker A: It's like, yeah, I mean, it does. I think it almost can't have gotten worse than the prior couple years. So I think it probably does get better even if the current administration stays. Here's the thing. You were talking about crypto, too. 2012, Obama's reelection to 2016. Was crypto higher or lower? Actually.
00:12:22.748 - 00:12:33.014, Speaker A: Actually, in that one, I think it was higher. Well, it was actually. It was higher. It actually did get high at the beginning. And then was low. Try this one again. 2016, Trump starts his election, he gets elected.
00:12:33.014 - 00:12:38.702, Speaker A: He comes out in 2020. Was, did bitcoin end up higher or lower during that administration? A lot higher.
00:12:38.758 - 00:12:39.726, Speaker D: A lot higher. Sure.
00:12:39.830 - 00:12:49.314, Speaker A: Okay. 2020, Biden comes in and it's about to be 24. You think at the end of 20, the start of 2020, was bitcoin higher or lower in his administration?
00:12:50.814 - 00:12:51.286, Speaker D: It was higher.
00:12:51.310 - 00:12:52.254, Speaker A: Like tonight? A lot higher.
00:12:52.294 - 00:12:52.590, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:12:52.662 - 00:12:58.078, Speaker A: So Trump or anyone wins in November, 4 years from now, 2028, where do you think? Bitcoin higher or lower?
00:12:58.126 - 00:13:03.548, Speaker C: Well, you sure are higher. That about any risk asset, basically that's true.
00:13:03.636 - 00:13:04.676, Speaker A: Is that inflation?
00:13:04.860 - 00:13:05.908, Speaker D: It's the stock market.
00:13:05.956 - 00:13:06.572, Speaker C: It's the inflation.
00:13:06.628 - 00:13:07.124, Speaker A: That's good point.
00:13:07.164 - 00:13:08.104, Speaker C: It's insane.
00:13:09.684 - 00:13:29.268, Speaker A: That original Obama one is pretty bad because actually there was that big peak in 20, 12, 13 where it hit like $1,300. And then actually in 20, 1516, it was down in the two to $500 range. So actually that one was lower. But I'm just saying, yeah, I think we're higher no matter what. I think we're probably. And part of that might also be fiscal too. I mean, like you said, it's fiscal.
00:13:29.316 - 00:13:31.772, Speaker C: But it's also just so many structural.
00:13:31.868 - 00:14:17.764, Speaker D: Things that are happening all at once. You take the AI stuff in terms of you've got to re engineer power grids to take into account that the AI processing data centers are going to be super energy. It's the infrastructure stuff that has to get done. It's the onshoring. It's all of these things that are structural in nature that are going to get done over the next couple of years. And on top of that, you're talking about a government that spends over 5% of GDP in deficit spending. And so when you throw in the fiscal impulse on top of the huge structural changes that the economy is about to go through, it's really hard to see how growth does not remain elevated in the US.
00:14:17.844 - 00:14:20.372, Speaker C: And that should be good for risk assets.
00:14:20.468 - 00:14:21.424, Speaker A: Yeah, it should.
00:14:22.444 - 00:14:26.230, Speaker D: And yeah, I mean, we're in, I mean, the inflation shit is so bad.
00:14:26.332 - 00:14:27.218, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I.
00:14:27.266 - 00:14:27.954, Speaker A: So sticky.
00:14:28.034 - 00:14:28.890, Speaker C: It's so sticky.
00:14:28.922 - 00:14:31.994, Speaker A: And when you actually walk around your daily life, it's like, feels high.
00:14:32.074 - 00:14:32.694, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:14:33.194 - 00:14:42.734, Speaker D: And really what it is is like I just constantly feel like these central bankers are just misrepresenting and basically lying to everyday people.
00:14:43.474 - 00:14:44.858, Speaker A: It's like gaslighting.
00:14:45.026 - 00:14:46.002, Speaker C: It's so insane.
00:14:46.098 - 00:14:58.700, Speaker A: No, no, no. Inflation's like getting lower. It's pretty lower. It's up slightly over a couple months, but it's like still and it's like, I was trying to order. I looked to a deli that I used to like to order from in New York. Like, not an expensive place. $18.95
00:14:58.700 - 00:15:06.860, Speaker A: for a chicken quesadilla. 18. Granted, this is lower Manhattan, but I'm just saying, like, some guy. Dude, it's a tortilla with cheese and some chicken.
00:15:06.972 - 00:15:07.556, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:15:07.700 - 00:15:08.276, Speaker A: $20.
00:15:08.340 - 00:15:16.064, Speaker D: I was in a chat with somebody the other day. This guy ordered, like, a burrito and nachos in Chicago for pickup on an app. It was $36.
00:15:17.324 - 00:15:18.508, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:15:18.636 - 00:15:48.498, Speaker C: But it's not about that. It's about the genuine, honest conversation that people need to have out loud. Right? It's not like Powell can't go up on tv and be like, I can't control for fiscal. Somebody needs to go on tv and tell me this shit is bad. Do the math for the next ten years, somebody needs to tell the american people that this is what our liabilities look like on a go forward basis. Right. We have to keep the dollar as.
00:15:48.586 - 00:16:12.578, Speaker A: It does feel like in a more classic, iconic american age, somebody like a Powell would stand up and tell the truth. Cause it matters for the country. Don't give me this, like, oh, well, the politics and bureaucracy of the Fed versus the treasury. I'm not supposed to, like, get to. And no, dude, the country could. Who cares about that divide if the country collapses because you guys screw this whole thing up? Please, somebody stand up and be an adult about it.
00:16:12.626 - 00:16:39.712, Speaker C: But also, the issue is, it's just like, if there was a 30 year old that was the Fed chairman, right? Like, we would be enacting different policies and very afraid Congress was, like, 35 year olds, right? Like, it's just so different. We're so nearsighted, and the long term impacts are insane. Think about running five to 6% deficits ad infinitum. What portion of the budget is gonna be paying interest in 15 years?
00:16:39.768 - 00:16:40.352, Speaker A: What? All of it.
00:16:40.368 - 00:16:44.552, Speaker C: Like, how are people not freaking out about this and, like, ringing the bell?
00:16:44.608 - 00:16:48.976, Speaker A: You won't have money for anything, republican or democratic stuff that you want.
00:16:49.120 - 00:16:56.264, Speaker C: And I'm like, come on, people. Like, it is math. Like, cut. Like, you need to cut spending and raise taxes. Like, immediately.
00:16:56.304 - 00:16:57.864, Speaker A: Everyone knows this. This is the pure math.
00:16:57.944 - 00:17:00.496, Speaker C: But you can't do it because it's an election cycle.
00:17:00.560 - 00:17:02.896, Speaker A: It's so messy, and it's always an election cycle.
00:17:02.960 - 00:17:22.664, Speaker C: Like, whoa. Well, that's a structural issue. You're telling me Congress guy has got to get elected every two years, senators every six. Like, he's running to, like, get raise money three months into the job, he's like, oh, I'm on the phone. Fundraising. Instead of being like, how do I fix stuff for my constituents? But it's absolutely asinine.
00:17:22.744 - 00:17:30.072, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't know. Well, hey, look, we're building an alternative that you could maybe opt out with. At least bitcoin is that story.
00:17:30.128 - 00:17:38.304, Speaker C: But it's. I mean, I love it, but it's like, you know, it doesn't solve the main issue. Not everybody has bitcoin.
00:17:38.344 - 00:17:38.924, Speaker A: No.
00:17:39.294 - 00:17:50.510, Speaker C: And yes. That's a great way for people that already have money to store their wealth, because it will. But for the folks that don't it, putting them in worse and worse situations.
00:17:50.542 - 00:18:07.290, Speaker A: 100% and separately, bitcoin or not, we have a country that we care about and love, and the math is pretty straightforward. And they won't tell us this. They keep us focused on the next month, the next FOMC meeting, the next earnings call. Like, it's. No, dude. Like, someone's got to take a long view on this thing.
00:18:07.322 - 00:18:09.914, Speaker C: Somebody's got to take a. But my part of the issue, though.
00:18:09.954 - 00:18:11.370, Speaker D: Is like, I don't know how many.
00:18:11.402 - 00:18:14.290, Speaker C: Of these politicians in Congress genuinely understand the issue.
00:18:14.362 - 00:18:24.338, Speaker A: I don't think they do. And like that, I saw a guy stand up now during the fit 21 debate. The guy has no idea what he's talking about. He's clearly been given this. He was proposing amendment. I don't think he's ever spoken before in Congress.
00:18:24.426 - 00:18:24.626, Speaker C: Right?
00:18:24.650 - 00:18:25.362, Speaker A: You're probably like, here you go.
00:18:25.378 - 00:18:28.554, Speaker C: Young way is Biden administration economic official the other day.
00:18:28.594 - 00:18:29.026, Speaker A: No. Which one?
00:18:29.050 - 00:18:31.134, Speaker C: Being asked about, oh, how does money work?
00:18:31.634 - 00:18:35.022, Speaker A: You're talking about the one in the documentary, Stephanie Kelton's documentary.
00:18:35.178 - 00:18:43.550, Speaker C: You got guys that went on the house floor being like, global warming doesn't exist. Cause I got snow in my hand. Like, it is absolutely asinine.
00:18:43.742 - 00:18:54.814, Speaker A: Oh, man. Well, you're not asinine, my friend. Thanks for coming on, galaxy brains. We'll check in with you next week. Maybe there'll be more. We'll have more numbers of data or something to talk about. My friend bimnadabibi from Galaxy training.
00:18:54.814 - 00:18:55.510, Speaker A: Thank you so much.
00:18:55.582 - 00:18:56.634, Speaker D: Thanks for having me.
00:18:58.494 - 00:19:05.332, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, Eric Balchunis, ETF senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Eric, thanks for coming back to Galaxy brainstorm.
00:19:05.458 - 00:19:06.504, Speaker B: Yeah, great to be here.
00:19:06.584 - 00:19:33.404, Speaker A: We have another ETF whirlwind happening. The last time you were on the show in January was the day before the bitcoin ETF launched. I think it was January 10. This one has felt a lot different. You guys had you and James safe art and had the odds pegged at very low. 25% likelihood that this week 19 B, four is for an Ethereum spot ETF would be approved. But that all changed on Monday.
00:19:33.404 - 00:19:40.364, Speaker A: I guess let's. Why did it change or set us up? Why were you down on it? And then why is the tide shifted?
00:19:40.784 - 00:20:07.384, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, we were down on it because everybody in the process was down on it. They had heard nothing. And when you have something like a 19 b, four for something, that's asking for exemption for something, typically there's a lot of communication between the SEC and the issuer. We saw that with spot bitcoin ETF's. There was 90 days of back and forths. There was all these meetings. Blackrock had five or six meetings with them.
00:20:07.384 - 00:20:34.638, Speaker B: Other issuers had four or three. All of this was just like building and building and building, and every pit of news was incremental. So because we heard none of that, it reminded me of when the spot bitcoin ETF's got denied in cycles passed. It was radio silence delay. Radio silence delay, radio silence denial. And this is the same exact thing, right? So we can only go on the intel and the patterns. And it all pointed to no.
00:20:34.638 - 00:21:25.254, Speaker B: So we kept at 25%, which was pretty bleak. And then, boom, on Monday, there was chatter building that the SEC has reached out, namely to the exchanges, to like, get the twelve v one s in shape. And that as you start to talk to people, and again, when you connect this to the outer world and you see what's happening, there was clearly a shift, a pendulum shift. Politically moderates like Mark Cuban were telling the Democrats, you've got to. You can't let this issue slip away. There was the Sab vote and many other things that were all part of the same story, which was that the Dems did not want to be seen as anti crypto. So my guess is they did the calculus and they thought, if we deny this, the rejection will be picked apart.
00:21:25.254 - 00:22:02.124, Speaker B: Then there'll be like lawsuits, potentially, which all of this just continues to feed into this anti crypto narrative. So if your goal is to not be anti crypto, it was smart of them to do a 180. So I get it. But for us, we were like, oh my God, this was like, holy shit for everybody involved. So we changed our odds to 75% just like that. Unlike bitcoin, where all of the information we got and shared was incremental and all moving towards approval in one straight upward line. This was just like we were coming down in a straightward line, and then we.
00:22:02.124 - 00:22:25.654, Speaker B: Boom, we went straight up. So the whole thing was both had been roller coaster rides. This was a different type of roller coaster. And it all kind of, boom, exploded on one day, which was Monday. And then now everything's been in a scramble. People probably haven't slept much, at least if you're a lawyer working on this. And it looks like we'll see approval tomorrow, which is Thursday.
00:22:25.654 - 00:22:39.402, Speaker B: And it looks like from there we'll go into the s one s, which is a different part of the approval. How long that takes, I don't know, but I'd reckon if I have over under, I could say the launch dates in two weeks, three weeks, something like that.
00:22:39.498 - 00:22:41.398, Speaker A: Wow. Interesting.
00:22:41.546 - 00:22:46.318, Speaker B: James thinks it could be months. I don't think so, but. And it could be days.
00:22:46.486 - 00:23:21.662, Speaker A: Yeah, I was thinking that it could be weeks to months. I was saying maybe July, but, yeah, I mean, it doesn't have to be. I mean, we just don't know. And so we had. Had you heard that? Because these are two different processes, the 19 B four s are the exchanges asking for permission to list, and those are the ones that come with these deadlines. And I think Vanek and Ark have their final approved, denied deadlines Thursday and Friday of this week. And with the bitcoin ETF's, it was ark that had their final, earliest final approval denial date was, I think, January 11, if I recall, and.
00:23:21.662 - 00:23:47.968, Speaker A: Or maybe January 10. And so the SEC and the issuers had worked on simultaneously the 19 B four s and the s one s so that they could launch them all or approve the 19 V four s and let the s one s go effective at the same time. Correct. It doesn't look like that's going to happen, though, right? There's got to be some distance between the. If they do come in and approve all the 19 before is this week. They're not. Is any of you hearing whether any of the issues are actually ready to actually launch this week?
00:23:48.016 - 00:24:23.212, Speaker B: Not this week, I don't think so, because the corporate finance team that does the s one s, I think, was just told of this on Monday or over the weekend. So they were caught flat footed. They don't really have any. But the good news is, unlike bitcoin, that process created the template, so the prospectuses and the documents are probably in need of only fine tuning, not course tuning. So it shouldn't be that hard to fix up a couple things. And so that's a big variable here, is that it shouldn't take that long. It's less work.
00:24:23.212 - 00:24:34.000, Speaker B: So I don't know, I would see it all happening fairly quickly. But I remember in the bitcoin day, they give comments and the files came back. It felt like about two weeks that played out.
00:24:34.072 - 00:24:34.328, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:34.376 - 00:24:48.704, Speaker B: Then there were another comments, another two weeks. So it's like two weeks per comment. So that's why I said two to three weeks, because I can't imagine you need more than one comment period, because this is all based on the bitcoin perspectives, is largely that we're already approved.
00:24:48.744 - 00:25:11.090, Speaker A: So I think the argument for longer. I agree with you. I think especially with the actual process, like things like cash create, redeem. How's that going to work? Like the actual sort of real meat ETF stuff that they have figured that out. But here's what I would suggest as a reason why it could take a couple rounds or more than one, is things like proof of stake. It's just a lot different. Right.
00:25:11.090 - 00:25:56.894, Speaker A: So they can't just think about all the disclosures in the bitcoin ones about, I mean, there's so many, right? It's like fork risk and illicit usage of bitcoin risk and mining risk and whatever else. All these disclose pages and pages and pages, right? A lot of those transpose to ETH, but some notably very much do not. Specifically the differences between proof of work and proof of stakeholder. I'm not saying they're insurmountable, I'm just saying they're different. And then also if you think about the regulatory attack area or attack surface on Ethereum's ecosystem, they have things like DeFi, which is widely under regulatory scrutiny that I think will require a whole host of additional disclosures. Most of the hacks that happen on chain have all been sort of ethereum related bridges. So I think there's more different disclosures.
00:25:56.894 - 00:26:14.354, Speaker A: And so maybe it's two or three rounds, but again, they're not really, it's really just disclosing. It's not material to the function of the thing. So I think a lot was, you're right, like sort of patterned out the last time. That would be my case for like a month or a month and a half instead of two weeks.
00:26:14.654 - 00:26:20.294, Speaker B: Yeah. And remember, there are e futures ETF's. So some of that's probably in those documents.
00:26:20.374 - 00:26:21.134, Speaker A: That's true.
00:26:21.294 - 00:26:30.764, Speaker B: And I feel there could be some level of exhaustion from the corporate fund. They may not want to go crazy here.
00:26:31.384 - 00:26:33.044, Speaker A: There could be some cynicism.
00:26:33.624 - 00:26:59.516, Speaker B: You know what, I'm so over this. We just did this. You're going to hand this to me before Memorial Day weekend of my summer. Thank you very much. So I could see a little bit like, I'm over it. And they obviously, there's spot ETF's in Hong Kong and in Canada, you know, so all the things you said, I agree, they're probably going to have to get that out there. But it's not like it's a completely unchartered territory.
00:26:59.516 - 00:27:40.382, Speaker B: There's been some products in variety of forms that have done this, so I don't really see anyway, but we'll see. There also could be some idea just to get it out, to get the story out of the news, just get it out of the cycle. Or it could even look like a win. Like, hey, let's get these things up and launch so that we get this pro crypto win in our check mark to offset the anti crypto stuff. So the politics of it is a huge variable and does seem to have a huge effect. And we don't totally know if the politics are going to tell it to do it faster or slower. I don't have a read on that yet.
00:27:40.382 - 00:27:55.298, Speaker B: But all I do know for a fact is that the staff was not totally ready at all for this, the s one staff, anyway. And so that, that means that it probably will be some degree of time after Thursday.
00:27:55.466 - 00:28:07.842, Speaker A: Yeah. So, yeah, not this week. Likely. And you're right. I remember this. We were redlining. I think I even said in the rap intro on this podcast when you were on last time, I'm thumbing through the filings like my name was Bal Chunus because we were.
00:28:07.842 - 00:28:35.030, Speaker A: It was a great time. I used to, every time fidelity or invesco or Blackrock updated their s one, I would run like a red line to like, see what they changed. Right. And like, I would try to read the tea leaves of like, okay, did they add something like, how serious is what they added? Does that give me insight into whether the SEC is like, less or more likely? It feels like some of that has to happen, but I agree with you, too. I think it is plausible that it's. It's one round here. It's one, or it's a one and a half rounds.
00:28:35.030 - 00:28:47.784, Speaker A: Right. So it's like one clear amendment with like a bunch of stuff. But as far as I haven't seen any reporting that the corporate corporation finance group has actually even sent back amendments yet or edits yet on the s one. So we have to wait for that first, I think.
00:28:47.824 - 00:28:48.440, Speaker D: Probably.
00:28:48.592 - 00:29:17.828, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. I mean, I heard that the only 19 before requests they really made were no staking and no airdrops. It wasn't that extensive. And, you know, again, they're run by ultimately the same people at the top, so maybe it won't be bad. I feel as though the. The other interesting part here is the issuers. They had months to line up friends and family and get some assets lined up in less time.
00:29:17.828 - 00:30:03.988, Speaker B: This time, the issuers maybe even would prefer a little extra time to get their act together, not just because the ecosystem and the logistics, but trying to get some flows lined up, because flows is marketing. They're all trying to jockey, especially if they get launched in the same day. So, anyway, I almost feel like right now we're kind of back where we were. Like, when we had the bitcoin approval, and when it was literally approved, it was like, like I said, I tweeted out that picture from 1944, headline, war is over. You know, after World War Two ended, that was the line. It was like the half the page was the headline because it was that. It felt that, like, ah, that's how this felt.
00:30:03.988 - 00:30:27.392, Speaker B: This was, like, so weird. It was like a shock. And so the good news is already out. Like, they're gonna, you know, they're gonna approve. This stuff is all technical, whether it launches in, you know, late this next month or, you know, in July. The big part of this, the 180, is the real, like, 90% of this thing in the news.
00:30:27.548 - 00:30:28.336, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's.
00:30:28.400 - 00:30:31.304, Speaker B: The rest is just logistics and legalese and.
00:30:31.384 - 00:30:46.400, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think if they want it, they could. I mean, you could be cynical, and if it is political, you could say, like, okay, let's avoid the denial headline by doing the 19 B four s. But we could drag our feet on the s one s. But it just. That doesn't really happen. Right. You don't really get.
00:30:46.400 - 00:31:01.366, Speaker A: I mean, I remember back with the bitcoin ones, I was telling our team, based on talking to people like you and others and ETF people and, you know, people that are partners, that, like, if the 19 B four s are approved, like, we can assume the vehicles will eventually launch. They would never approve them and then not allow.
00:31:01.430 - 00:31:11.030, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't buy it. I don't buy that. James and I. James in particular likes to leave a little wiggle room, but to his credit, he was. He kept this at 25%. I was going to go lower.
00:31:11.142 - 00:31:14.390, Speaker A: I would have been lower, too. In his defense. In your defense, I guess.
00:31:14.462 - 00:31:35.506, Speaker B: Yeah, but he's like, you never know. And so I do agree you got to leave a little wiggle room for the unforeseeable things, but I can't imagine them approving 19 before. And then other issue, what I was, what I heard is the corporate finance team was told, okay, go get them in shape now. And so they already been told to do get them in shape process. Yeah.
00:31:35.570 - 00:31:42.426, Speaker A: Right. Right. If they're not, if they know they're going to deny, they don't bother. No one bothers to work on it. They don't want to work on it. They don't ask the issuers to stay up late working on it. Right.
00:31:42.426 - 00:31:53.178, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, in the end, they have relationships with the invesco, fidelity, blackrocks, even the bitwises. Right. Even the arcs like the SEC does have to work with these folks. They don't want to be jerks and say, do a bunch of work at.
00:31:53.186 - 00:31:55.016, Speaker B: One of their companies down the road.
00:31:55.130 - 00:32:05.340, Speaker A: Right. That's true. That's true. All right, let me, let me ask you about. I don't know if you've thought. We've just started really thinking again. We really, at Galaxy and at Galaxy Research, we also agreed with this.
00:32:05.340 - 00:32:58.214, Speaker A: Like, we, you know, it's radio silence. So we, we put out reports leading into the bitcoin ETF launch last year, estimating how many flows there might be, what the impact might be on bitcoin price. Um, and those, basically, we, we were actually pretty spot on. We said 14 billion in year one, leading to $75,000 bitcoin. We were right about the numbers, but we said that all of that would have to come from the Morgan Stanleys and the Edward Jones or whatever, the RA platforms, the bank and broker deal platforms. Really, all of it mostly came from retail for the most part, or at least the retail brokerage platforms, because those banks haven't really turned on yet. Do you have any thoughts on, either, just in general, the likelihood of success or comparing what we might expect versus the crazy flows we saw in bitcoin ETF so far? Have you started talking to people about their excitement for these actual products?
00:32:58.514 - 00:33:20.694, Speaker B: Yeah, I would get ready for the feeling of a little bit of a dud. Not completely, but the problem with the bitcoin launch is it was the biggest of all time by far, and it's sort of like any golfer now that wins is interesting, but after watching Tiger woods for 15 years, it all just feels so. Man. Yeah.
00:33:21.034 - 00:33:25.546, Speaker A: Especially when he came back and won the Masters again. You know, I would throw that in.
00:33:25.570 - 00:33:44.818, Speaker B: His whole legacy, but especially when he started out, it was like, holy shit. This guy's beating everybody by twelve strokes. It was spectacular. And then, you know, just golf has had a hard time kind of coming back from that. Electricity and like meat matching it. And this is ethers, like I said. And ether.
00:33:44.818 - 00:34:05.506, Speaker B: People hate this. This is like being an opening band, having to follow the headliner. It's really hard. And so I would just lower the bar big time. And a, there's been less time to prepare friends and family assets. B, I just don't think normal people, 60 fortiers need much more than bitcoin. I think, you know, let's look at gold and silver.
00:34:05.506 - 00:34:34.246, Speaker B: Gold has what, 80, 90% of all the precious metal assets. I just see them having a similar relationship. And the e futures were a real dud. I mean, they saw almost no action. They've gotten a little bit of flow since, but I don't think any of them are really over like maybe 100 million tops. And that's 100 million after a year or two on the market isn't bad, as you know. So the bitcoin ETF has set a standard that is impossible to live up to.
00:34:34.246 - 00:34:35.236, Speaker B: So I would just.
00:34:35.390 - 00:34:38.204, Speaker A: Yeah, I bet with like eight bill, 18 billion.
00:34:39.424 - 00:34:57.136, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's. It's knocking on the door. How about this? This stat is freaking insane. If you look at ETF's and the speed at which they got to 10 billion, the record before I bit was 647 days, I bet did it in 49 days.
00:34:57.280 - 00:34:58.816, Speaker A: That's insane. That's just crazy.
00:34:58.840 - 00:34:59.728, Speaker B: Isn't that insane?
00:34:59.816 - 00:35:00.632, Speaker A: That's truly wild.
00:35:00.688 - 00:35:03.676, Speaker B: Like that's three years to like a couple months.
00:35:03.800 - 00:35:42.046, Speaker A: Yeah. And we looked, you know, we looked and it was. I don't have it right in front of me, but I was looking through the 13 f's and calculating quite simply like the percentage of shares owned that reported 13 f's versus the outstanding shares. So, like, which one? Right, because those are investment managers with 100 million or more in total. Aum have to file those filings to say what they own. And it's, I bet in FBTC. I mean, and all of them really were like, you know, at most like 20% of shares had to report, which means the vast majority of ownership is like non reporting entities, which is mostly like retail or fidelity brokerage services on behalf of a bunch of people.
00:35:42.046 - 00:35:44.838, Speaker A: Right. This was pretty organic is what I mean.
00:35:44.886 - 00:35:51.006, Speaker B: I agree. And that's good if you're bullish here, because you weren't even counting on that. Totally.
00:35:51.110 - 00:35:55.014, Speaker A: We weren't. We actually discount. We didn't we? Our entire estimate when we reported on.
00:35:55.094 - 00:35:56.582, Speaker B: I wasn't either, I'll be honest.
00:35:56.638 - 00:36:01.966, Speaker A: We basically said, look, every day, every. The Ericsson Alex is we can just buy on Coinbase, cash out. Like, we don't need it.
00:36:01.990 - 00:36:35.964, Speaker B: I was trying to tell people that it's like fishing in a lake. The 2021 October, when bitcoin was at that fever pitch, when Beto launched, it was like minnows were just chomping at it. And I had said, the minnows are gone, but the bigger fish are what these are going for, which is the advisors and the institutions. The minnows were still there. I just. I kind of misread that. So that's good, because I, you know, at 20% ownership in 13 f's and some are even a little less than that, but ultimately they'll probably get to 40.
00:36:35.964 - 00:36:58.876, Speaker B: So you're looking at those bigger areas, probably beto is 40, 44%. I would see the other ones getting there, so that's a good sign. And some of the liquidity, I mean, even if there's. I think there's ten of them, all of them are pretty liquid. Even, like, wisdom tree might be the smallest one, but it still trades more than way above average for a new launch.
00:36:58.980 - 00:37:08.544, Speaker A: That's crazy. Even the smallest one is because there are a lot of ETF's out there, and you can have specialty ETF's. They don't all have to be gangbusters to be successful.
00:37:09.404 - 00:37:19.264, Speaker B: Yeah, I looked, actually, if you look at the launches, I think it was the last twelve months. The wisdom tree is still in the top 15%.
00:37:19.844 - 00:37:20.492, Speaker A: It's amazing.
00:37:20.548 - 00:37:45.812, Speaker B: Of new launches over the past, there was like 500 new launches. I think it's. Even with it being last, it's still in top 15% of ETF's. That's how hard, you know, and I've been. I always have compassion for new issuers, especially indies, because it is so hard. That's why every now and then, some crypto person, like, they'll look at the daily flows and they'll bitch about like, oh, ibit took in zero. What the hell's going on?
00:37:45.908 - 00:37:46.476, Speaker A: I saw this.
00:37:46.500 - 00:38:20.172, Speaker B: A failure. I'm like, oh, my God, you got to take a walk. You got to get outside. That's why I'm saying, like, you don't understand how hard ETF flows are and how hard this business is. They've been really spoiled. And so I try to help manage those expectations for them just as a courtesy, because it is something that you have to kind of readjust what your reference points are. And for ether, I would say anything over a couple billion in the first year is wildly successful.
00:38:20.308 - 00:38:50.544, Speaker A: Yeah. I think the biggest private vehicle is the grayscale eth, which is attempting to convert here. And I think, I haven't checked in a little while, but it's maybe 9 billion under management there. Whereas GBDC was like 30 plus. And again, it's 9 billion at these prices, and that was GBDC at those prices. So it's not an order of magnitude, but it's almost, you know, it's quite larger. The bitcoin investment.
00:38:50.544 - 00:39:13.708, Speaker A: The other thing that I think is an interesting thing to note as to why really they shouldn't be as big, is that Ethereum is an on chain application platform. Right. You're not necessarily missing out on as. You're not missing out on as much functionality when you put. When you buy bitcoin exposure through an ETF as you are when you buy eth exposure through an ETF.
00:39:13.796 - 00:39:15.820, Speaker B: Not yet. Not to mention the lack of staking.
00:39:15.972 - 00:39:24.516, Speaker A: That's what I mean. And I ran that analysis yesterday. If you had started, if you bought $10,000, you know those on all the fun charts, like mutual fund website. Sure.
00:39:24.540 - 00:39:25.500, Speaker B: Growth of 10,000.
00:39:25.612 - 00:39:51.438, Speaker A: Yeah. I said if you bought $10,000 of ETh on the day of the merge in September 2022, when it went to proof of stake, and you didn't stake, you just bought it. You underperformed two yesterday by 8% than if you had bought and staked. And eight's not. I actually thought it would be higher, the amount of underperformance, but that grows every year. That's a material to me.
00:39:51.606 - 00:40:11.518, Speaker B: That to be a fee, that's a huge expense ratio. This is the problem with bitto. Bitto, I believe, last time I checked, had roll. The roll costs in the futures were costing you, I want to say four to 8% a year somewhere in that ballpark. Not terrible. I mean, you're up. It's like you're up 50 instead of 60.
00:40:11.686 - 00:40:19.430, Speaker A: Yeah, people say that to me. Why should I care about 8% over 18 months if the asset doubles? And I'm like, well, I mean, a fiduciary does care, though.
00:40:19.542 - 00:40:48.100, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. I think also just people just want the real thing. They want to have as close to frictionless exposure to that thing as possible. This is why ETF's so popular. They do the best job just getting rid of all the shit in the middle. And people love that. And in this case, you're right there's this, like, footnote now that you got to have with this one, which only adds to my opening band metaphor, which they don't like.
00:40:48.100 - 00:40:51.836, Speaker B: I. I once referred them as small potatoes, and I apologize.
00:40:51.900 - 00:40:52.884, Speaker A: I saw you took that back.
00:40:52.924 - 00:41:14.108, Speaker B: But, yeah, that's too dismissive. You know, eth. I was the ETH people. I used. I live in Philly, and I say that we're the Jan Brady of northeastern cities. We're stuck in the middle of New York and DC, which are like power centers. And that's why our sports fans are so pissed off all the time and so wildly, creatively, mentally insane.
00:41:14.276 - 00:41:15.564, Speaker A: And I feel like ETH is that.
00:41:15.604 - 00:41:40.060, Speaker B: It'S like the Jan Brady, and it's like always, Marsha, Marsha, Marsha, the bitcoin gets all the attention. So if I don't include EtH in a tweet, that's supposed to be. If I just put bitcoin, they're like, oh, look at him. He won't even include us. I just feel like they have this middle child syndrome, and so they get pissed off pretty easily more than the bitcoin people. But I kind of understand. I'm Gen X.
00:41:40.060 - 00:42:01.648, Speaker B: Like, we're left out of a lot of stuff, too. It's like boomers and millennials. Like, we didn't even exist. So being a Philly Gen xer, I can relate to the ETH angst, and I appreciate it. And so I wanted to. I think I upset them. I upset them with this take, but on the flip side, and upset them when our odds were low.
00:42:01.648 - 00:42:19.480, Speaker B: So some of them have come out real nasty towards me. And the odds, I don't really. I don't care. I don't feel much, but I understand what they're saying. I would feel more, and be more embarrassed if our rationale for being low had something to do with bias. But we were not biased. We simply were trying to get it right.
00:42:19.480 - 00:42:26.942, Speaker B: Our reputation's in the line. That's how we saw it. So our goal always is to be right. It's not like we're playing favorites at all.
00:42:27.038 - 00:42:34.542, Speaker A: Yeah, you were. I saw that you were being accused by some Ethereum community. I mean, you know, like, on Twitter. Not like it wasn't like, you know, Vitalik.
00:42:34.598 - 00:42:36.102, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Online.
00:42:36.198 - 00:42:57.218, Speaker A: Yeah, it's just online. And they were accusing you guys of being, like, bitcoin maximalists because they thought that your lack of. But I also want to state for the record that every single person I know at any of these issuers, and I do know I work, I work at a partner of one. Now. I used to work at Fidelity for twelve years there one. I have friends across this industry. Nobody saw this coming.
00:42:57.218 - 00:43:25.418, Speaker A: No one. I wrote, nobody. In fact, I did a webinar with my team in January, just about trends in crypto that was open to the public. And I was the, I had the over on my whole team of seven researchers. I said 50 50, basically like, I don't know, this is in January. And then come like sort of march when you guys started lowering your odds. And then the SEC also was reported to be investigating the Ethereum foundation and now they've sent a wells notice to consensus and uniswap.
00:43:25.418 - 00:43:42.702, Speaker A: All this stuff is ethereum related. I basically, I wrote in a research report that like this just looks like they're definitely not going to approve ETh. ETF's at a minimum. And by the way, other stuff. So I just want to state equivalently that everyone I know that is smart on this industry was totally in the same camp as you and James.
00:43:42.858 - 00:44:17.408, Speaker B: There's one detail in all that that is really interesting and important. There was a letter sent by a couple congresspeople, maybe the senators, I can't remember. They sent it to Gary. This was like two months after the bitcoin launch when this is right around the time the second wave was hitting and they were doing 800 to a billion a day in net flows. People were like, holy shit. And I feel like the democratic side at the time, remember they were still anti, this is before it became election issue. And they sent a letter saying, gary, what the hell did you do this for? Don't do this again.
00:44:17.408 - 00:44:53.680, Speaker B: And they included in there the fact that eth futures were less correlated to spot than bitcoin was. And I'm like, there's no way these, there's no way these congresspeople from these random states are that acutely aware of correlation studies. So we thought they were actually working with the SEC to write a letter to itself. That's a little tinfoil hattish. But the point is, I think everybody on the democratic side got buyer's remorse because they were successful. If the bitcoin ETF's flopped, nobody cares. Who cares? But when they saw them succeed, I think they thought, oh my God, did we just let the genie out of the bottle here? We hate this.
00:44:53.680 - 00:45:18.062, Speaker B: It's going to spread. And I think they got really nervous. And that to me was huge because I thought they're definitely going to close the barn door now. Nothing else is getting out. That is also fed into my thesis that has some intel that this was political. Because it was political the other way, to be honest with you, for up until two weeks ago.
00:45:18.198 - 00:45:33.566, Speaker A: Right. Yeah. It felt like. You're right. I think it's pretty straightforward to assume that politics are involved, because a market regulator would not normally act like this is not. If you're just going to go about your business, you don't say nothing for months and then call everyone and say, stay up all night. That's not a normal course of business thing.
00:45:33.566 - 00:45:45.460, Speaker A: The abruptness doesn't make sense otherwise. And that's pretty straightforward. Right. I mean, that's. This isn't. I mean, I guess, for the record, you watch the SEC and issues with, like, launching new funds. It doesn't normally happen this way.
00:45:45.460 - 00:45:46.116, Speaker A: Right.
00:45:46.300 - 00:46:02.372, Speaker B: Well, yeah, Nate Drac, who's a great friend of mine, he. Yeah, he is kind of trying to hang on to this thesis that they just didn't want to circus and that they purposely. But this would have to require Gary to telling nobody inside his own organization until the 11th hour.
00:46:02.428 - 00:46:06.412, Speaker A: Oh, so rather than create the, like, constant drum beat like we had all fall. Yeah.
00:46:06.468 - 00:46:18.380, Speaker B: And frankly, a lot of people start to take off on Thursday. This is a big holiday summer kickoff weekend. He's gonna send them into this weekend, like, all, like, drained of sleep and stuff. Like, it's. Like. It's. That's really sadistic.
00:46:18.492 - 00:46:22.516, Speaker A: Yeah. And it doesn't seem right, but it's possible. Again, we don't really know.
00:46:22.620 - 00:46:39.712, Speaker B: Yeah, I. But we have been. We've been fed numerous pieces of intel and stories that this is purely something that was. Was a 180 for political reasons. But again, it. I will call it all circumstantial evidence. It's very strong.
00:46:39.712 - 00:46:41.904, Speaker B: But it's not like I have, like, hard.
00:46:42.024 - 00:46:43.680, Speaker A: We don't have the documents or anything.
00:46:43.792 - 00:46:44.464, Speaker B: I don't have it.
00:46:44.504 - 00:47:02.674, Speaker A: But I think before we started recording, you mentioned that you think it's even possible that, like, the corporation finance or maybe trading and markets already had denials written for this, like, they had been, which would make sense if you plan to deny, because why they're not going to wait until the 11th hour. It's like, why would you procrastinate?
00:47:03.254 - 00:47:50.788, Speaker B: Yeah. We will not be surprised if we hear that they had already written up at least portion of the rejection letter, if not all of it. And there was a meeting that was interesting. There was no meetings with, like, the issuers, except for one, like, three months ago, where Grayscale and Coinbase met with the SEC. And we had heard that was to ask Coinbase about their correlation study. That would definitely, because the coin based correlation study showed that they were as correlated, basically. And if the SEC was going to write a denial and include correlation, which is crucial, because otherwise they could be open for lawsuits, that would be something where they'd want to know why were you so tight? Because maybe they were running a study that had more far and they had to be able to defend that and that.
00:47:50.836 - 00:47:57.676, Speaker A: So you're saying that the only meeting they really took was something that they would, was research to embolden perhaps their rejection? Basically, yes. Yeah.
00:47:57.740 - 00:48:12.556, Speaker B: Yeah, that's, that's it. So again, we. And Gary. No, Charles Gasparino just reported this morning. He basically reiterated what we said to it two days ago. I will say he calls it all breaking. But I mean, come on, give us a.
00:48:12.556 - 00:48:37.646, Speaker B: Throw us a bone here. We, you know, we were way ahead on this. But he says breaking and it's all stuff, you know, except what was a nugget in there, which was that the, that Gary was about to, part of this was good. He was going to declare it as security. Like that was baked into the rejection. And again, this is his reporting. But that would, that would be in tune with how he feels, I think.
00:48:37.830 - 00:49:21.804, Speaker A: Yeah, I think he's. They, I think the SEC has released, made this pretty clear, but I was arguing that they have actually left a little bit of wiggle room on that question. So the criticism from, say, Pat McHenry on the House Financial Services Committee and others has been that Chair Gensler has refused to say whether or not they believe Ethereum is a security. And then more recently in this consensus lawsuit. So consensys, I think, announced they've received a wells notice from the SEC. I think it's related to Metamask, their metamask wallet, they said, and in response, have proactively sued the SEC in tech, in Texas federal court. And in that suit, they say that the SEC has already determined that it is a security.
00:49:21.804 - 00:49:35.024, Speaker A: Right. So like, that's the closest I think we actually have on the record. But of course, there's all these other things. They don't like staking. They're saying Coinbase is staking is a security. They're all sort of this Ethereum foundation. Like, we all kind of know that that's where they were headed.
00:49:35.024 - 00:49:41.010, Speaker A: But I feel like they still have a little wiggle room now to say, okay, ETH isn't a security, but maybe staked ETH is. Right.
00:49:41.082 - 00:49:54.074, Speaker B: Yeah. It's running the needle kind of situation, which they might do. I'm curious, like, do you think it's a security? And do Eth people, does it even matter to them if it weren't for the ETF?
00:49:54.234 - 00:50:33.322, Speaker A: I don't think it is a security. I think it could. I really actually believe in the Bill Hinman like analysis that, like, sure. When it launched, was it a security? But if you look, for example, I mean, one of the big things they always talk about is decentralization, right? What is, without going through all of Howie and the Howey test or the Reeves test, these various, like, legal precedents to determine that answer, Eric, I would say it's pretty widely decentralized. I don't believe it's as decentralized as bitcoin in its development or its ownership or. I think proof of stake is inherently more centralizing than mining, but I don't literally think that there is a group of a cabal that is driving the ETH price up on benefit for the benefit of shareholders. And I don't think anybody buying it thinks that's the case.
00:50:33.322 - 00:51:00.546, Speaker A: In general, I don't believe it is one, but I do think that it is meaningfully different than bitcoin. Truly. I think the proof of work mining versus proof of stake consensus is significantly different. If you think about it, computation powers the chain in proof of work, which is egalitarian. You don't have to be there waiting to be called upon. You can literally show up to the network with solution to a problem and then never be seen again. Right? Like it's.
00:51:00.546 - 00:51:17.216, Speaker A: It's. It's pure in and out with no. Like, there is no association. One miner has no knowledge of or association with any other miner, and proof of stake valid. And you have to sit there with your capital at risk, wait and be called upon by a group. Now, the group is a decentralized protocol. It's not like a centralized actor.
00:51:17.216 - 00:51:38.122, Speaker A: To me, that's a big difference. And then also think about it in proof of stake, where if computation powers consensus in bitcoin and proof of work, then capital powers consensus and proof of stake. So it's inherently more central. So I think they're different. But, you know, I don't think it should be a security under the us securities laws. There are others that should be, but. Or even maybe.
00:51:38.122 - 00:52:14.866, Speaker A: I mean, I don't know. That's not. This is what, we have this big vote. You know, this is probably coming out Thursday, but when we're recording on Wednesday, May 22, there's a big vote about to happen in the House on this new fit 21 act which very clearly delineates when the SEC would regulate cryptos as securities versus when the CFTC would regulate cryptos as commodities. And it does shift the balance much more to the CFTC as commodities than the current SEC believes is the case. So, I mean, honestly, the question is up in the air and I think it is reasonable for crypto firms to not know. I mean, because they are, I think they really are different.
00:52:14.866 - 00:52:19.854, Speaker A: They're not equities, almost any of them. Almost none of them look like stocks or equities to me.
00:52:20.874 - 00:52:26.774, Speaker B: Is there any other coin that you would say has mostly the commodity futures?
00:52:27.964 - 00:52:45.748, Speaker A: Yeah, here's some that I'm safe to say that I think we are very certain. Any fork of bitcoin that had a fair launch. Here are the things I would say. Fair launch meaning no pre mine tokens, no sale to anyone. That's what bitcoin had. Right. So there's no insider money.
00:52:45.748 - 00:53:10.588, Speaker A: Right. And there are a few, you know, a fun one. Dogecoin fork of bitcoin, totally fair launch, no promises, no centralized foundation. Right. I mean, it's actually, Doge is probably, I would say, closer to likelihood of being, of getting an ETF one day than almost any other, which is just funny because it is funny. Yeah, it is funny. I mean, so I don't know, there's, there's more to.
00:53:10.588 - 00:53:28.084, Speaker A: But you can, you can obviously launch coins with features that look like the, the very permission permissible, non security like features that bitcoin has. That is possible. Um, and I just, you know, I don't have a whole bunch in front. We think there's plenty that aren't, that don't meet the how we threshold to be securities, but.
00:53:28.164 - 00:53:28.468, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:53:28.516 - 00:53:37.988, Speaker A: Including ether, by the way. Um, but anyway. Yeah, it's. Are you, were you ready for this? I saw James calling this the ethnic stakes. It's like the coin tucky Derby was the last one.
00:53:38.076 - 00:53:50.284, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, yeah, it's perfect, actually. And I didn't realize the double meaning. There obviously stakes. The predestakes is for everybody listening who's not into horse riding. It's a second crown in the Triple Crown.
00:53:50.444 - 00:53:55.540, Speaker A: It's brilliant. The fact that you have the Kentucky Derby is the biggest and then the Prius is the second. Yeah.
00:53:55.572 - 00:53:57.780, Speaker B: So maybe there'll be a. What's the other one called?
00:53:57.812 - 00:53:59.884, Speaker A: The Belmont Saratoga? No, Belmont.
00:54:00.004 - 00:54:02.452, Speaker B: Belmont is, I think, isn't Belmont the third one?
00:54:02.508 - 00:54:03.020, Speaker A: Probably.
00:54:03.132 - 00:54:04.384, Speaker B: We'll figure that out.
00:54:05.604 - 00:54:14.220, Speaker A: The Dogemont. So you're ready for it. Could you think it, I mean, it sounds like James thinks a couple months at most, or more likely. You think?
00:54:14.252 - 00:54:14.904, Speaker B: I think.
00:54:15.754 - 00:54:19.574, Speaker A: So. You're gearing up for round two here? Yeah.
00:54:19.994 - 00:54:37.770, Speaker B: Somebody soon is going to have intel and a sign from corporate finance that's going to answer this question for us. So I would just stay tuned for the next like day or two. We're probably going to have our answer soon. And then, or at least we'll have a, like I said, we'll be close. But right now it is really, truly a guessing game on the phones.
00:54:37.922 - 00:54:46.388, Speaker A: Well, my friend Eric Baucunis, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, thank you again and good luck. Get some rest. It's going to be an exciting one.
