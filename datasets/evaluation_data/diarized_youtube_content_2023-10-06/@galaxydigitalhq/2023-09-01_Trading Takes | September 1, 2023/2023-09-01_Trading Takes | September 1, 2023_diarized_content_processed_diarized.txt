00:00:08.160 - 00:00:12.998, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, great to have you on. Galaxy brains.
00:00:13.086 - 00:00:14.454, Speaker B: Thanks for having me on, Alex.
00:00:14.574 - 00:00:54.146, Speaker A: Yeah, big news this week, something everyone's been waiting for. For several weeks, people like me have been auto refreshing. Pacer, the online docket search tool, waiting for a ruling in grayscale versus sec. On Tuesday, August 29, the district, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously in favor 30 ruling in favor of Grayscale. We're going to talk with Bloomberg intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffert after this, so we won't get into the procedural stuff around ETF's and the meaning of the ruling necessarily, but BIMnet, what was the reaction in bitcoin markets yesterday?
00:00:54.290 - 00:01:48.578, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I think the market started to price in a greater probability of an eventual approval of an ETF by, by the SEC. The price action supported that conclusion, with bitcoin going from 26,200 to a high of 28,200, a move about of about seven to eight to 8%. Since then, we have retraced that move and I think that's just a function of just expectations for this. ETF can only get so high. The odds were already pretty high and folks heads after Blackrock made that filing. But now that the SEC is definitively lost in court, I think that probably just nudged it a bit higher. But it's really at that critical point where everybody that's in this market is expecting an eventual approval.
00:01:48.578 - 00:02:41.244, Speaker B: And so your risks were that that was the initial move. In addition, there's a lot of delta neutral trades that folks run that when you had this bitcoin move happen, actually leads to increased sell pressure. We can touch upon that later. But all in all, I think you had a move that was flushed out shorts. You had a tremendous amount of liquidations to the upside, but you haven't really seen follow through. And I'd also like to highlight, normally it's spot up volume up in the crypto market, where if you get a five to 10% move in bitcoin, you typically see upside calls sort of being more bid off from a vault perspective. But the long dated stuff really didn't move that much in crypto.
00:02:41.244 - 00:03:06.956, Speaker B: And so it just shows that the market isn't really buying the fact that there's going to be follow through to this move. And I think it's important to highlight that this is happening in the context of equity markets that are trading incredibly well. This week we did have a little bit of change to our macro outlook, and that's what's been causing broader risk to rally. But let me just pause there. Yeah.
00:03:07.020 - 00:03:16.060, Speaker A: What was the change in macro? I have seen equities. They're near all time highs again, what is driving that move?
00:03:16.172 - 00:03:48.132, Speaker B: So yesterday you had a significant drop in job openings from around 9.4 million job openings to like 8.8 million. And normally job openings tend to lead other sort of labor market metrics. People aren't gonna get, people are gonna stop hiring new people before they lay off existing people. It's kind of the intuitive logic to it. But high level, you had a pretty big miss in labor market data for the first time in a really long time.
00:03:48.132 - 00:04:40.664, Speaker B: That's been sort of the most anchored part of the economy. What we know just from our own historical analysis is that labor market data tends to lag when you're going through a recession or a contraction in economic activity or that part of the business cycle. And so everybody's kind of been waiting for hints in the labor market, and you finally got it yesterday. And you've seen a little bit of follow through today with ADP coming in slightly softer at around 177,000 jobs added. So in the context of the Fed's response function, which Powell laid out pretty eloquently on Jackson Hole last week, on Friday, which is they're data dependent. If data stays hot, they'll probably hike a little bit more. If not, they're going to be less inclined to hike again.
00:04:40.664 - 00:05:27.542, Speaker B: And so the market's just taking its cues from the data, and you're seeing a little bit of a turn. And now we have PCE inflation data out tomorrow. In addition, you do have non farm payrolls on Friday as well. And so those are two big points that if you were to see a little bit more softening in that data, that will cause a further rally in duration. In the US, a lot of the rally has been front end led. And so you have had that curve steepening still. But I would expect if you get soft data tomorrow with respect to PCE on a month end date like tomorrow, you could see a pretty significant bid in duration and now have a spillover into equity markets, and they'll probably continue to take us higher.
00:05:27.542 - 00:05:54.420, Speaker B: But again, do I think equity should be sitting at close to all time highs with valuations pretty elevated as well? Probably not. But ultimately, if the Fed is going to start being dovish, that's the biggest sign to be long risk assets. The way to trade markets in general is just to follow the central banks. And so I think that's what you have to do. And that should bode well for things like bitcoin and gold. Yeah.
00:05:54.452 - 00:06:17.750, Speaker A: So the idea is that if the job openings lead unemployment, basically that we see softening in the economy, which means the Fed's work is working and means inflation, they may be able to ease their hiking schedule sooner. Right. That's sort of the broader. The bad news is good news for equities and risk assets, Mike.
00:06:17.782 - 00:07:05.774, Speaker B: Now what makes things tricky though, is there's already a significant level of cuts priced into the market. So what I like to look at is the one year, one year interest rate forward and the two year, one year interest rate forward. And so basically in a year from now, the one year ois or the one year average interest rate is expected to be around 4.17 basis points. And so to give you context, right now Fed funds sets at 533. And so you already have over 100 basis points of cuts there. And then when you get to kind of where your neutral rate assumptions are like the three year, one year, two year, one year points being around 360, that's implying over 200 basis points of cuts already.
00:07:05.774 - 00:08:17.874, Speaker B: And so what's really tough for me to think about and for the market in general is let's say we do start easing. How much can we actually ease before the risk of reigniting inflation becomes too great? If I told you if interest rates dropped by 200 basis points tomorrow, folks would start buying houses like crazy, folks would buy Nasdaq like crazy, and all of a sudden you would then be reigniting the exact same things that were causing the inflation to begin with. I just struggle. Even if you do think data is going to turn hard for the next six months, is that really sustainable given the structural elements that we have in our labor market and mortgage market? I'll give you an idea. Let's say we start to see some labor market metrics soften the stuff structurally that's going on is just going to be so tough to overcome. Construction's one of the best examples. I think for every ten retiring construction workers, there's only three or four filling in their place.
00:08:17.874 - 00:09:25.200, Speaker B: And the metrics get worse as you get into further specializations, whether it's electricians, plumbers, but these specific trade type things, there's really a structural labor market shortage. And that's the reason why we've literally still had almost two jobs per job applicant or per job seeker for the better part of the last year. And so there's still so many structural things in the labor market. In addition, everybody still has a mortgage sub 4% or sub five. And so it's going to be tough to overcome those things. And I think the rate market gets a little ahead of itself because it's so worried about the situation where the Fed's emergency cutting or something is blowing up and everybody's panicking because we did have something similar to that happen basically six months ago with the regional banking crisis and the market getting way ahead of itself in pricing and emergency cuts within the next meeting. And so people are still scarred by what happened earlier this year in terms of when folks panic about markets.
00:09:25.200 - 00:09:56.308, Speaker B: They think the Fed's got a cut by 100, 200 basis points at a time. I think you just see a lot of cuts baked in because of that fear. But ultimately, I think this economy is super resilient. And so I think we're still going to be in this period of hire for longer, and we haven't been in that kind of period in a pretty long time. The consequences of it are still kind of a little unknown. Speaker one.
00:09:56.316 - 00:10:15.764, Speaker A: Yeah, it's fascinating. I fear the 1973 to 1985 inflation resurgence. And we know the Fed does as well. That was the Volcker era, and I think that really underpins a lot of Jay Powell's language on hire for longer. That's a risk, right? That's where this comes from.
00:10:15.884 - 00:11:43.148, Speaker B: Absolutely. To throw in an interesting caveat to this is where this equation differs from the seventies and the Volcker era is the magnitude of fiscal in the US as a percentage of GDP and just the outright levels, the amount of treasury supply that has to get absorbed over the next couple of years is outrageous. Not only that supply from the government, but from the banks, private markets. It's a lot. And the math behind the fiscal spending is not improving the portion of the fiscal budget that goes towards interest. And then you just keep running the math. You get to a point where it's like, is this really sustainable? Does the Fed have to cut to make sure that the government can properly finance itself? Or does the Fed have to start absorbing all of the issuance or the extra issuance of the government? And then you get into this weird MMT logic, and if inflation becomes an issue, it's like, what does the Fed want to do? Do they want to help tackle the inflation issue? Or are we going to have a sound and resilient government that can fund itself well, and so it sets up some very intriguing setups that are very unique to what we've had in, in the past.
00:11:43.236 - 00:11:51.124, Speaker A: Yep. Yep. Very interesting. Big questions ahead for markets, as always, bimnet my friend from Galaxy trading. Thank you so much. Pleasure.
