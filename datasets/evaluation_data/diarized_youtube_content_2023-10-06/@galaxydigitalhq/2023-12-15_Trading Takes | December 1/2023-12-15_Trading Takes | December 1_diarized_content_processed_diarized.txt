00:00:08.160 - 00:00:12.382, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:12.478 - 00:00:13.622, Speaker B: Thank you for having me.
00:00:13.758 - 00:00:30.360, Speaker A: What's been going on in markets? I mean, I saw Bitcoin after we did our last episode. It went down a little bit, but it's mostly right back in the high 37s. It was at 38 yesterday. And then equity markets I saw, are also performing well. What's going on?
00:00:30.472 - 00:01:20.552, Speaker B: So you've had a continuation of the theme over the past couple of weeks with data deteriorating and dovish Fed speak yesterday really marked a new kind of stage to it when you had a relatively hawkish member of the Fed, Waller kind of come out more dovish than a lot of market participants were expecting. Basically acknowledging that the fact that a lot of the data has turned and some of the forward looking indicators are suggesting that we're going to head to a softer patch of inflation and employment and things of that nature. And so you saw twos rally 15 basis points yesterday. The dollar aggressively sell off. We're talking euro broke through 110 cable and $27 yen. I think overnight 46 handle. So dollars sold off aggressively.
00:01:20.552 - 00:01:55.964, Speaker B: Us fixed income went aggressively bid and that's generally risk on. And so equities have been reacting pretty well to that news. S and P is flirting with 4600, which is basically close to all time highs. Not even year to date highs. Guys, we're talking about all time highs are within sight for the S and P and the Nasdaq. You've seen a lot of highly shorted names and stuff that's more closer to junk or low quality stuff do really well. Some of it's a function of a short squeeze.
00:01:55.964 - 00:02:41.130, Speaker B: Long story short, when the Fed is pivoting like this, the market's going to take it as a signal to buy risk assets and that's what it's doing. What's the risk asset? Every currency that isn't the dollar, Russell stocks, meme stocks, things of that nature. Folks feel like the Fed gave them a green light to buy risk. I think that's spilled over into crypto as well. That's why again, we're still flirting with new trend highs in bitcoin, you know, alter trading pretty healthily as well. And so I think you're just in December and the Fed's telling you that they see a soft landing ahead.
00:02:41.242 - 00:02:44.442, Speaker A: Yeah, it's crazy. So the pivot is on.
00:02:44.578 - 00:02:47.618, Speaker B: It's on. However, the risks to that, that's what.
00:02:47.626 - 00:02:48.642, Speaker A: I was going to get to are.
00:02:48.698 - 00:03:35.954, Speaker B: That you've got a lot baked in. Right. So by the January FOMC meeting of 2025, so it was just like a year and like two months, call it, you've got 130 basis points of cuts. By May of next year, you've got the first 25 basis points priced in. So there's a lot of easing that's priced into the rate curve. What makes it so challenging is you don't know the extent to which they'll cut when they do start cutting. Because if you're motivated enough to cut, the question's like, do you cut 50? Do you cut 100? You cut 150? What do you do with the QT program that you have? And so it becomes a very hard thing to solve, and you just kind of have to think about the distribution of outcomes.
00:03:35.954 - 00:03:48.894, Speaker B: But the risk is that the Fed sees the economy slowing, but doesn't necessarily feel the need to cut rates. And that's where the market could get caught offsides a little bit.
00:03:48.934 - 00:04:41.210, Speaker A: I see. And part of the thing, too, with hire for longer as an idea, which doesn't mean raise more, but it may mean stay high for a longer period of time. If people start buying stocks and equities are at all time highs or nearing it, and things further out on the risk curve, like crypto or meme stocks, whatever else, are doing well, people feel wealthier and then they spend more, theoretically, and then inflation is stickier. It's this push and pull we've talked about that's going to be so. It's such an interesting position because they're acknowledging some softening and they're signaling that that could lead to easing. Yes, but at the same time, they don't want to signal that too hard. They want to be hawkish also, so that people, they're kind of like a mean parent who's like, don't go out and spend anything, though.
00:04:41.210 - 00:04:58.246, Speaker A: Right? They got to beat us down with language, but we know you're. Yeah, it's just such a tricky situation because we've talked about that Volcker situation where they raised a bunch and then they cut a bunch, but then inflation roared back and they had to raise to like 20%. They don't want that to happen. Correct.
00:04:58.310 - 00:05:29.440, Speaker B: And so it's a fine balance that the fed needs to strike. And there are other considerations are their credibility. Many eyes, they're not that credible. But for them, it's still an important thing to focus on. And so, yeah, it's tough. However, I would say that their concerns are not necessarily about the part of the economy that has a huge stock portfolio, not necessarily the people that are going to feel richer.
00:05:29.512 - 00:05:32.284, Speaker A: Those people are doing fine. That's a fair point. Exactly.
00:05:32.704 - 00:06:15.590, Speaker B: Those people already have a huge glut of savings. Their consumption habits aren't really going to change that much. Are they really going to buy a new house right now? And so what you're mainly concerned about is the folks in the bottom quartile of the income distributions, the folks that are having to pay student debt, again, the credit card delinquencies that are picking up the auto delinquencies that are picking up the folks at risk with automation moving in at the fringe parts of the labor market. And so that's kind of where I think the Fed's concern is mainly coming from. In addition, like, there's structural things that have changed that are now helping the Fed. Right. So oil's come off a lot.
00:06:15.590 - 00:06:19.870, Speaker B: For example, I think you're going on like ten weeks in a row of.
00:06:19.902 - 00:06:31.822, Speaker A: Gas price declines and that trickles out throughout the economy. Like not all, just the stuff that uses gasoline to power it, but also all the products that are made from petroleum. Right? Like everything. Tons of stuff gets cheaper if oil's cheaper.
00:06:31.918 - 00:06:32.198, Speaker B: Correct.
00:06:32.246 - 00:06:32.834, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:33.734 - 00:07:00.152, Speaker B: And so, you know, and also the supply chain stuff is eased super meaningfully. And I do think there's a certain element of the US consumer is always so strong. They just want to consume, consume, consume. But there is a limit to that. Everybody that bought furniture during the COVID pandemic, they already bought it. They already bought it and stuff like that.
00:07:00.248 - 00:07:06.360, Speaker A: That was a big trend during COVID buying stuff to upgrade your house because you were all stuck in it. What?
00:07:06.392 - 00:07:17.192, Speaker B: Ordering the shit. 16 months to arrive, 16 months later. You have the catch. Do you need a new one? No. Yeah, right. And so, you know, same thing with like durable goods. You bought a new fridge, I forget.
00:07:17.248 - 00:07:30.040, Speaker A: But we're like the, you know, like I don't want to name any specific companies, but like the mail furniture companies that, like, whether it's like self assembly. Where did they rip during COVID They must have, right? I'm forgetting now, honestly, they must have.
00:07:30.072 - 00:07:34.360, Speaker B: Because if you're like, we engaged, you're like money printing. It just didn't matter what you.
00:07:34.392 - 00:07:38.382, Speaker A: And you can't go out. So it's like you're only ordering stuff on online, basically. Yeah.
00:07:38.398 - 00:07:39.038, Speaker B: I mean, just.
00:07:39.166 - 00:07:43.198, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I bought a new bed during COVID I did.
00:07:43.246 - 00:07:45.394, Speaker B: And those fancy sheets that I do.
00:07:46.374 - 00:08:05.740, Speaker A: I'm telling you, if you're gonna spend money on something, things that carry. This is just a clear aside, but in my view, it's things that, like, your body is in. Right. Your bed, your furniture, your shoes should be comfortable. A t shirt, I like to say merely drapes upon your body, but your sneakers carry the full weight of your body. Right. So they should be comfortable.
00:08:05.902 - 00:08:07.888, Speaker B: Got it. No, no, absolutely.
00:08:08.016 - 00:08:09.056, Speaker A: It's a little bit of a surprise.
00:08:09.200 - 00:08:22.244, Speaker B: Looking forward. We do get a bunch of data shortly. So you get PCE, you get non farm payroll soon. You've got Powell speaking, I believe, on Friday.
00:08:25.624 - 00:08:27.088, Speaker A: And we have another FOMC before the.
00:08:27.096 - 00:08:28.256, Speaker B: End of the year, December 15.
00:08:28.320 - 00:08:29.016, Speaker A: Okay. Big.
00:08:29.120 - 00:08:38.950, Speaker B: Another ECB meeting as well. Big bank of England meeting as well. And so there's a lot of, like, central bank and data in the next couple of weeks that might change.
00:08:38.982 - 00:08:43.654, Speaker A: Do we get any data on, like, Thanksgiving and Black Friday and Cyber Monday yet? Have you seen anything?
00:08:43.694 - 00:09:04.446, Speaker B: I know, I mean, was it strong? It was really strong, but it's really tough to say because, like, you don't get the online sales look really good, but they grow every year. So it's like, did they grow because they grow every year or was there a meaningful pop? Yeah, right. But, yes, people spent money a lot more. Seems like more than they did last.
00:09:04.510 - 00:09:06.694, Speaker A: Year, which is always the trend, theoretically. Right.
00:09:06.734 - 00:09:30.534, Speaker B: Yeah. But the nature of the spending, I think, is what's most important, because there's so many buy now, pay later programs happening and people buying stuff on credit in general. And so that's really where the focus is. I mean, I'll tell you, even when I order food, they have a pay later section.
00:09:30.574 - 00:09:45.558, Speaker A: Somebody said, I saw a joke. Somebody was like, I just ordered, like, a domino's pizza. And for fun, I decided to pay $1 a month for 24 months or something. They're even offering that now, like, retail everything. I even noticed this on apple.
00:09:45.606 - 00:09:46.590, Speaker B: Pay. Yes, exactly.
00:09:46.622 - 00:09:50.958, Speaker A: It literally says, pay later if you want. You can pretty much do anything. Apple will loan you money, apparently.
00:09:51.086 - 00:09:53.910, Speaker B: It's really crazy, but at these high interest rates.
00:09:53.942 - 00:09:55.694, Speaker A: We love credit in this country, don't we? Yeah.
00:09:55.734 - 00:09:57.794, Speaker B: It's gonna be an issue at some point.
00:09:58.094 - 00:10:00.502, Speaker A: It's in our DNA. Debt is in american DNA.
00:10:00.558 - 00:10:17.878, Speaker B: Here's really what's happening. I mean, partially, it's like the Fed has binding constraints. If we just kept jacking rates up, shit would definitely break. I mean, when tens were approaching 5% and everybody was like, oh, my God, the fiscal path is on. I mean, it still is.
00:10:18.046 - 00:10:21.190, Speaker A: I know, but that really made people really sort of freak out about the fiscal.
00:10:21.302 - 00:10:28.474, Speaker B: Exactly. And so what did the treasury do. The treasury was like, oh, we're not coordinated or anything. We're going to cut coupon issuance, though.
00:10:29.534 - 00:10:31.806, Speaker A: Freaking out about whether or not we can spend this money. Yeah, yeah.
00:10:31.830 - 00:10:33.598, Speaker B: It caused a rally in the back.
00:10:33.646 - 00:10:39.274, Speaker A: It is funny. Cause the Treasury's job is to spend money. That's their job. Primarily for the US government.
00:10:39.814 - 00:10:42.246, Speaker B: It's also to manage the debt profile.
00:10:42.310 - 00:10:49.470, Speaker A: Well, for sure they have to get the money, which is the debt, but I mean, they're the ones that. They're the bank account for the US government.
00:10:49.582 - 00:10:50.014, Speaker B: Correct.
00:10:50.094 - 00:11:04.372, Speaker A: And so, of course, if they start seeing, wait a sec. Our issuance policy is resulting in strong pushback or calls for fiscal conservatism, or then maybe we should change that. Cause we'd prefer if they didn't come in and cut our money.
00:11:04.428 - 00:11:16.116, Speaker B: I mean, basically, though, here's the issue with all this stuff, is you got a bunch of people that basically only think a couple years forward, right. And there's no incentive. Like senators are on six year election cycles.
00:11:16.260 - 00:11:19.144, Speaker A: That's the best we've got in terms of longer term incentives.
00:11:19.444 - 00:11:28.872, Speaker B: They get elected and like two years in, they start fundraising again. Their voters aren't really asking them to come up with solutions for where the economy is.
00:11:28.888 - 00:11:35.024, Speaker A: And you talked about this for years too. You've said this. There's no. And you don't get elected saying you're gonna cut, basically.
00:11:35.144 - 00:11:54.604, Speaker B: And it's also like, okay, there's a ton of people under the age of 30, 35, right. They're not the most vocal people about politics, but trust me, in 20 years from now, when it's like, wait, the federal, we spent $2 trillion to just pay interest a year, that's gonna be a problem.
00:11:55.904 - 00:12:29.286, Speaker A: It is a problem, though. Your point about if you take two year House of Representative terms, you basically have to spend. I forget there's simple math on this. It changes all the time. But it's like Congressman person has to raise five grand a week to have a chance at reelection, and they have to start right away. I don't know if it's five grand the number, but literally you can pursue two primary strategies as a member of the house, like a home office strategy, which is where you're at home in your home state a lot, meeting with lots of constituents and typically raising money from them, or more policy focused strategy. Where you are in Washington more of the time.
00:12:29.286 - 00:12:43.294, Speaker A: Maybe you're building your profile by working on high profile issues, and maybe that's how you raise money, but that you neglect your home state and basically you have to decide and you have to be raising. Always be raising. It's like, always be selling. You gotta always be closing, you gotta always be raising.
00:12:43.334 - 00:13:06.166, Speaker B: The only senator, not to give any endorsements, but the only senator that's made like a lot of sense to me recently about this fiscal issue and acknowledging this mismatch of incentives was Mitt Romney. He gave a speech about it. Guys, we gotta address this stuff. But there's no capacity to. And then like Stanley Druckenmiller.
00:13:06.270 - 00:13:06.758, Speaker A: Sure, sure.
00:13:06.806 - 00:13:55.140, Speaker B: And the investor community, the investor community has acknowledged it. But yeah, it's tricky. And then the last thing I want to leave people with for sure is the rational me, the mid curve me tells me that this is a market in bitcoin, at least that has a lot baked in in terms of expectations of an approval. Right. But in terms of the pricing of the actual flows, the subsequent flows, it's nearly impossible to price that in full. The pathways that an ETF opens, in terms of just flows, until you get those flows, it's going to be insanely difficult for this market to price in that kind of stuff. And so, to borrow a phrase from another, you know, client of ours, actually, it's buy the room or buy the news.
00:13:55.252 - 00:13:59.284, Speaker A: Yep. Bim Nadabibi from Galaxy trading. My friend, as always, thanks for coming on, galaxy brains.
