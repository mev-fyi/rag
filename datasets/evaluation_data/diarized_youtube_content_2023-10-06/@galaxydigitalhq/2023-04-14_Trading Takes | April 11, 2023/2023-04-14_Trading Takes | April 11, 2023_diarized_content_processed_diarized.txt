00:00:07.000 - 00:00:11.934, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, my friend, great to see you.
00:00:12.014 - 00:00:13.118, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:13.246 - 00:00:16.422, Speaker A: It's a. It's a fun week, I would say. I mean, you have.
00:00:16.438 - 00:00:23.934, Speaker B: It's been a fun year. I mean, what a year. We started at 16k. We're at 30,450 right now. Let's go.
00:00:24.014 - 00:00:48.046, Speaker A: Yeah, I think Mike was on CNBC earlier this week and Joe Kearnan was like, look, Mike, you said last year that 30k you thought would be the strongest support. And Mike was like, I was wrong, but actually like, you know, from 30k down to 16 five, it was really inorganic for selling due to all of those blowups. Right. So I feel like back at 30, I'm not saying it should, you know, that it feels right. Like it doesn't.
00:00:48.110 - 00:00:49.174, Speaker B: I mean, it feels low.
00:00:49.214 - 00:00:55.806, Speaker A: We're more than 50% off all time high. Still. It's clearly a bear market, but this feels like a fairer price for bitcoin right now.
00:00:55.830 - 00:01:21.138, Speaker B: It is a fair price and it's a price that gotten achieved without that much leverage. This is an ecosystem and an asset class that's been completely delevered. There's much less OTC lending. There's no crazy FTX perp market. And so credit has really tightened. And so this is really organic, spot driven. And the other thing to think about, it's bitcoin led as well.
00:01:21.138 - 00:01:45.044, Speaker B: Obviously this year. This year ETH is having a little bit of a moment. Now, we can get into that a little bit later. Bitcoin outperforming because it's got a story. And going back to that interview, the theme is pretty clear. Dollar is selling off because the Fed is going to be eventually cutting or the hikes are stopping. You're getting a negative dollar story in the market.
00:01:45.044 - 00:02:14.662, Speaker B: Euro dollar is taking out 110 new highs, gold through two k and is sustaining it. Now. We're at new trend highs this morning. The story is there, the chart is there, it's organic, you're getting technical breakouts. And then on top of that, you've got a wonderful community in ETH that's continuing to push development. And you had an awesome upgrade go through last night and now ETH is through two k. And so lots of things pointing up.
00:02:14.662 - 00:02:33.810, Speaker B: I would say the risk to all of this was highlighted yesterday in the CPI report. We did see reasonable strength in core CPI, even though we had a little miss in headline, but there's still remarkable strength in services, pricing and inflation. Basically correct.
00:02:33.842 - 00:02:34.690, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:02:34.762 - 00:02:44.562, Speaker B: But we see the writing on the wall. But it's just tough to be like, we're gonna eventually cut rates, but your core CPI is still above 5% and you're targeting two.
00:02:44.658 - 00:03:20.384, Speaker A: Yeah. Like I saw that some people are saying, some economists and Wall street folks are saying, and I think you've said this before, too, that they'll have to cut before they get to their 2% target, that they won't get to 2%. What does that mean? Will they? And also is that if that's true, if that happens, that's a game changer for the way people think about central banks managing inflation. If they, if basically we have to accept longer term inflation, even if it eventually gets back down there, they'll have ended their, their policy maneuvers before reaching their target.
00:03:21.444 - 00:03:22.292, Speaker B: I mean, do you think we'll be.
00:03:22.308 - 00:03:27.084, Speaker A: Down to 2% by the time that the street thinks they might cut at the end of the year?
00:03:27.244 - 00:04:07.574, Speaker B: No, no, probably not. Yeah, but they look favorably upon data that suggests that we're not accelerating again and that we're clearly moving lower. But I think what you're really hitting on is, what is this 2% inflation target, and is it really something that we should just be sticking to as, like, that's the rule of thumb. That's the target. That's how the market's going to operate. And if you talk to economists, they'll be like, well, that 2% inflation targeting has generally worked pretty well, and there's a whole ton of data that supports it. But again, times are different now.
00:04:07.574 - 00:04:47.602, Speaker B: And so it's a very interesting debate. The other issue is that you can't just communicate for decades that your inflation, trying to target 2% inflation and then suddenly switch. You have a huge credibility issue if you're going to change your stance. My understanding of where things stand right now in terms of fed and folks that think about inflation targeting, et cetera, is that because of that credibility issue, it's going to be basically impossible for them to outwardly communicate that they are okay with. So they'll always just be targeting a higher level than 2%.
00:04:47.658 - 00:04:51.202, Speaker A: They'll just be calling for 2% the whole time, even if they can't raise rates.
00:04:51.218 - 00:05:39.746, Speaker B: So they'll phrase it differently. Like when we were on the way up and Yellen was, you know, fed secretary, like they, like inflation averaging was how they talked about it. They want inflation to average around 2%, so, you know, it can go above and below. And so it's a moving goalpost. And realistically, like, what the Fed's trying to do is trying to have a set of, like, financial conditions that doesn't harm the economy too much, but doesn't help the economy too much either. Like, not too hot, not too cold with people having jobs and without, like, financial stress in the system where people are like, oh, do I trust my banks? Right, right. Do I trust, you know, like, the FDIC to ensure my balances? And so they have a handful of jobs, and I think they're doing okay now.
00:05:39.746 - 00:06:13.450, Speaker B: But in theory, if you take a step back, where are we? Inflation is not skyrocketing right now. It's high. It's definitely hurting people because on average, the inflation impacts lower income people a lot more, shelters a higher portion of their expenses, all that stuff. So it's definitely still impacting people. But those people still have jobs. Right. And the federal government is still spending trillions of dollars a year, food stamps, federal assistance, hope, freezing, student loans, et cetera.
00:06:13.450 - 00:06:34.468, Speaker B: So there's support for lots of people via the employment market, via social transfers, et cetera. And then there's generally financial stability, like stocks are, Nasdaq's up like 15% on the year. Home prices haven't really collapsed that much. So generally speaking, things look okay.
00:06:34.596 - 00:06:35.236, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:35.380 - 00:06:37.612, Speaker B: And like, and like, wait.
00:06:37.788 - 00:07:01.634, Speaker A: Yeah, it's pretty wild. Let's talk about ETH a little bit and ETH BTC. So you referenced that the, so we're recording on Thursday, April 13, last night, on Wednesday, April 12, around 06:30 p.m. At 06:30 p.m., eastern, Ethereum upgraded to both Shanghai and Capella. But basically it's referred to as Shanghai. It's because now they have consensus layer and an execution layer.
00:07:01.634 - 00:07:25.794, Speaker A: But basically this one upgrade, which was primarily to enable unstaking of staked ETH. Right. The completion of the merge. Right. Because, and it was a success, it appears. And there's been a lot of talk about, and there was a lot of speculation by folks leading into the event that how would this create a supply shock? Sell side selling. Right.
00:07:25.794 - 00:07:43.742, Speaker A: All these people have been locked up for three years. Like maybe they're going to unstake and then sell. We aren't really seeing that. Certainly on a net basis. It looks actually like more people are even depositing now into the staking contract than withdrawing. ETH went through two k on the news. ETH BTC is up.
00:07:43.742 - 00:07:51.438, Speaker A: Bitcoin's up, too. But the last couple, last 24 hours or I guess 12 hours or so has been an ETH led move.
00:07:51.526 - 00:07:52.354, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:07:52.734 - 00:07:55.194, Speaker A: Where do we see this going? What are your thoughts on that?
00:07:57.624 - 00:08:29.112, Speaker B: In the camp of one, you have to respect the trend. Clearly bitcoin and Ethereum are trending. They're trending higher. It's organic, and it's one of those self fulfilling things where Mike said it best yesterday. Basically, when stuff's going up, the adoption cycle actually accelerates. You have two assets that are trending higher, right. Then you have technical things, right? Thirty k.
00:08:29.112 - 00:08:56.076, Speaker B: Two k. These are huge psychological levels. Typically when you seen these kind of big levels go, there's normally meaningful follow through. So I'm still generally in the camp that these assets are trending. You're meant to buy dips, and if you see breaks through resistance, you're likely going to get follow through. Third, I mean, technically speaking, you just have to follow, like, are people depositing more ETH?
00:08:56.140 - 00:08:56.652, Speaker A: Right.
00:08:56.788 - 00:09:25.714, Speaker B: It is now proof of stake network. And I think there's going to be a lot more ETH deposited over time. And clearly the value accrual and how people think about value accrual, like in crypto and in defi, et cetera, is changing. Like, ETH is outperforming most of the alts. Right. Bitcoin's been outperforming like most of the alts. And so it's clearly becoming very ETH and BTC centric in crypto and less so about random defi tokens.
00:09:25.714 - 00:09:32.546, Speaker B: Other l one s, ETH has clearly established itself as the preeminent smart contract platform.
00:09:32.610 - 00:09:45.198, Speaker A: Right? Yeah. Especially throughout all these l two s and the development happening there. It's sort of like, why do we need Alt l one block space if you can go to l two? I'm not saying that's the only way of thinking about it, but I think the market is really sort of looking at it that way right now.
00:09:45.306 - 00:10:19.910, Speaker B: Absolutely. And so I'm constructive on both, but personally I'm still in the bitcoin camp. And I think the fiat debasement narrative has a lot more room to run. And the most important thing happening in markets is the sea shift in monetary policy that the market is starting to sniff out. It's a big deal to go from we're worried about six 7% interest rates to when is the Fed cutting. You've just had a huge transition. And then you have all of these, these other sort of factors which are super interesting.
00:10:19.910 - 00:11:17.674, Speaker B: They're always around, but the geopolitical stuff, right? Like Russia and Saudi Arabia cooperating on oil, macron being like, hey, if China and Taiwan happen, I'm gonna pick my own lane. There's so many interesting other narratives that aren't really dollar supportive happening. That's kind of like the sea change that I'm paying most attention to. And it has the best sort of follow through into bitcoin in my eyes. But at some point, there is an inflection point with respect to the adoption cycle in bitcoin, where the institutions that are going to come in and the size precipitates bigger institutions and more size. And it gets to a point where it's nonlinear and gets convex totally. And I think you kind of had that well, you need regulation to eventually get there, at least in the US.
00:11:17.674 - 00:12:23.760, Speaker B: But ultimately, I think the world of asset managers, risk takers, pensioners, anybody that manages money, if bitcoin gets through 40k or 50k again, the FOMo that will take place amongst institutions, I think is going to be pretty intense. You know, what crypto is really after, or at least why I like crypto, is it still hasn't captured nearly a fraction of like the wealth in the world and of the global assets, even the attention span, et cetera. And once you really start like getting like 0.10.2 basis points of huge, huge multi billion dollar, trillion dollar portfolios, that's when this asset class takes off. And so where does it take off? It's gonna take off in the large cap, the biggest size thing. And so bitcoin is going to be the first thing to go and like higher beta stuff like ETH might follow and you might outperform. But really, to get that, like, insane, like, inflection as an asset class, you have to draw in like huge, huge pools of money.
00:12:23.760 - 00:12:58.112, Speaker B: And the best way to do that is to get big. Yeah, right. Like it's a size thing. Like, if you're a big company, a lot more companies can look to invest in you, right? If you're talking equity world, much more liquidity, much more. And that was the whole idea about one of these things, like the FTX perp market. One of the reasons why Alts got so big was because of the liquidity. The idea that I'm a hedge fund somewhere, a risk manager, or some offshore guy, and I've got capital, and I want to invest in alts.
00:12:58.112 - 00:13:39.784, Speaker B: If I can get in and out quickly, if I can hedge that risk, if I can earn the forward interest rates or hedge my staking yield, somehow the ability to do those things makes people more comfortable in that asset class and drives adoption, buying, so on and so forth. And so being big liquid only helps you get bigger and more liquid, which then becomes self fulfilling. And then you think about it other ways. It's like, okay, when things get bigger, what happens? Volume down because they're dip. Buyers and institutions dip buy and volume down. That means you can hold more of the position. And so it's like as you get bigger volume down, more people enter and then it gets self filling.
00:13:39.784 - 00:14:13.080, Speaker B: So there is an inflection point somewhere. Do I know where that is? No. Am I getting a sense on when that timing is. Yes, that timing. In my head I'm thinking you're looking at the having, having the end of the fed cycle, really. Europe not worrying about inflation. There's a lot of variables, but I take my readings from the market and right now it's the world's best performing asset class, risk adjusted outright and tough not to be looking at it.
