00:00:07.560 - 00:00:11.390, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, great to have you.
00:00:11.462 - 00:00:12.446, Speaker B: Thanks for having me on.
00:00:12.510 - 00:00:13.918, Speaker A: Hey, big day. Fed day.
00:00:14.006 - 00:00:14.606, Speaker B: Fed day.
00:00:14.670 - 00:00:17.518, Speaker A: Fed day. Was it a Super bowl day?
00:00:17.606 - 00:00:54.814, Speaker B: No, it was like a wild card playoff round at best. At best. I mean, this was like the most lackluster, uninspiring FOMC I've seen in a while. And I think it just goes to show you we're near the end and that there's going to be a lot less volatility. That's going to be a function of Fed policy. And I think the future drivers of markets or the next sort of big things for markets are going to be less oriented around Fed policy. So, yeah, I mean, it was an exciting day.
00:00:54.814 - 00:01:07.050, Speaker B: Powell basically said that they hiked rates right now because the data suggested that they should, and that going forward they're gonna be data dependent as they always have been.
00:01:07.162 - 00:01:07.802, Speaker A: Same story.
00:01:07.898 - 00:01:11.250, Speaker B: Same story as last time. There's very minimal changes in the statement.
00:01:11.322 - 00:01:11.946, Speaker A: Yeah, it was very minimal.
00:01:11.970 - 00:01:23.136, Speaker B: We did acknowledge the constructive elements of the last CPI print and that if they were to see follow on that, that would be a welcome sort of.
00:01:23.160 - 00:01:25.888, Speaker A: Sight, which we all know. Right? Yes, correct. So it's like he's just saying, he's.
00:01:25.936 - 00:01:43.924, Speaker B: Just reiterating stuff and then he still thinks that the balance of risk is skewed towards not doing enough to combat inflation rather than going too hard on land. Too hard and hard landing. Cause that stuff's reversible.
00:01:44.424 - 00:01:54.776, Speaker A: And we've been talking about this now for months, maybe even a year. Yeah, the hard landing, we're just not seeing it yet. It could still come, but it's.
00:01:54.840 - 00:01:55.584, Speaker B: Oh, it's definitely.
00:01:55.624 - 00:01:59.704, Speaker A: Unemployment's still low, the housing market's still high, wages are still going up. Yeah.
00:01:59.744 - 00:02:39.064, Speaker B: I mean, we've forecasted away the recession that we had forecast. There's definitely been stronger elements of growth. But what's important about this stuff is that this growth hasn't come at the expense of high inflation or it's come at the expense of inflation as inflation has been coming down. Interesting statistic that I just got from Jeffrey Gundlach, famous bond investor at double Hunt Capital, is that if you replace the owner's equivalent rent component of headline CPI with more live, accurate housing metrics, you'd be talking about headline inflation. Headline that was at zero or close to it.
00:02:39.184 - 00:02:39.768, Speaker A: Wow.
00:02:39.896 - 00:03:42.184, Speaker B: And so there are ways like, there are certain elements of the inflation story that tell you, oh, the Fed should be done right now. That monetary policy works on a lag, and it's clearly working, and we're getting even more restrictive now when we're seeing it working. And so it really depends on what your perspective is. But there are just so many strange structural elements to the current macro landscape that it makes it very difficult to have confidence in. Your assessment, is housing tight because everybody has a mortgage and supply tight? Are rents gonna come down? Are there structural things in the supply chain that have fundamentally altered where inflation can get to and where it can't, et cetera? And so there are all these new strange post COVID dynamics that market participants and central bankers have to take into account. So it's really tough to say with any confidence this is what you should do. In addition, I think it's worth noting that you've only just had one soft inflation number.
00:03:42.184 - 00:03:53.118, Speaker B: There are elements of weakness. You still have the tightest labor market in history, and prices are still going up. They're going up at a relatively slower.
00:03:53.206 - 00:03:56.014, Speaker A: Rate, but still higher than you'd like. Correct.
00:03:56.134 - 00:04:08.478, Speaker B: And then the other thing that's really important to note that I didn't think Powell did a great job of addressing was the easing and monetary conditions. By that, I mean, stocks are at the dead heights. Nasdaq's up 38% on the year.
00:04:08.606 - 00:04:13.118, Speaker A: That's crazy, right? I think you said that to me last week or the week before. There was, at the time it was up like 40%.
00:04:13.246 - 00:04:14.846, Speaker B: I'm like, yeah, it moved down.
00:04:14.950 - 00:04:17.634, Speaker A: It's like, what, one of the best stock years ever.
00:04:18.134 - 00:04:19.502, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely.
00:04:19.558 - 00:04:22.334, Speaker A: Meanwhile, everyone has been out. It's been a wall of worry the entire time.
00:04:22.374 - 00:04:26.686, Speaker B: Wall of worry, yeah. And that the pain trade was, was, was higher. Everybody was worried.
00:04:26.750 - 00:04:27.294, Speaker A: It's crazy.
00:04:27.334 - 00:04:39.406, Speaker B: And, like, now it's like, wait, like, if stocks rip another 10%, I mean, everybody's gonna feel rich again. And, you know, like, what does that do to inflation? Should push it up.
00:04:39.430 - 00:04:41.022, Speaker A: Yeah, people spend more. I mean, yeah.
00:04:41.078 - 00:04:43.118, Speaker B: Spend more, feel richer, take more debt out.
00:04:43.166 - 00:04:54.726, Speaker A: Think that they can remember what people were doing at the, at the, like the 21 manias. They were mortgaging. They were mortgaging their homes, or they were borrowing. They're buying, like, dogecoin, using their stock portfolio as collateral.
00:04:54.910 - 00:04:57.966, Speaker B: Three quarters interest rates. I borrow as much money as possible.
00:04:58.110 - 00:05:05.910, Speaker A: That's what people were doing. I saw crate, there's this terrible, like, Reddit, subreddit where, like, there'll be, like, people that have, they ask for, like, financial advice, and, like, you, sometimes you see screenshots, like, they're really bad.
00:05:05.942 - 00:05:06.614, Speaker B: They're really bad.
00:05:06.694 - 00:05:19.154, Speaker A: And the guy's like, you know, I put up my stock portfolio at the highs, like to use it as collateral to borrow money to purchase a home. And now the stocks are all down a lot. Like can I like get out of it or anything?
00:05:19.234 - 00:05:20.498, Speaker B: And those are bad.
00:05:20.546 - 00:05:29.026, Speaker A: Like you're in trouble. That attitude could return and that would cause a lot more inflation too. I mean, that's an extreme example. But like in general, I mean, meme.
00:05:29.050 - 00:05:35.122, Speaker B: Stocks are the best performing stocks this year. The G's custom basket that I look at I think is up 100%.
00:05:35.218 - 00:05:38.170, Speaker A: The G's has a meme stock basket. Oh, absolutely. Love that.
00:05:38.242 - 00:05:39.330, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:05:39.522 - 00:05:40.298, Speaker A: Wow.
00:05:40.466 - 00:06:27.764, Speaker B: But anyway, I think you bring up an important point which is, right, monetary policy is meant to address like the needs of the everyday person. Right. The reason why Powell feels so compelled to hike rates by 550 basis points in such short order is because the average person, their ability to consume has been constantly getting eroded. Now the question is, is that level of erosion getting to acceptable levels? Right, right. And when you look at headline numbers, they actually look okay. But there's just still perpetuate the risk of reacceleration. Now I think it brings us to just another point which I think is worth noting, is that households are actually still okay.
00:06:27.764 - 00:07:05.184, Speaker B: If you look at credit card delinquency data, it hasn't shot up that much. Household savings, you know, they've come down a lot and are expected to decline. Like you still see a lot of spending. Right. And so some of it might be on credit, et cetera, but there's still momentum behind a lot of the consumer and the average person. And so like I'm still in the camp that like you haven't really addressed inflation. Cause those people still have jobs and wages are still going up at four plus percent and asset prices are still going up.
00:07:05.184 - 00:07:11.176, Speaker B: And while there are signs that they're weakening things here and there, like, so.
00:07:11.200 - 00:07:25.112, Speaker A: Now they feels like they just like lower the magnitude that they're increasing each time. But to your point and the frequency, that's the other. What have they been doing now? Every other one. So they raised, what's the last couple been? So this was 25 bps they raised, they raised and then the last one.
00:07:25.128 - 00:07:26.408, Speaker B: They didn't, they didn't raise and then.
00:07:26.416 - 00:07:30.866, Speaker A: They raised 25 before that. Correct. Not raised before that or no, they.
00:07:30.890 - 00:07:33.010, Speaker B: Were raised 50, 25.
00:07:33.162 - 00:07:38.706, Speaker A: None then 25, yeah. Correct. And now what do we think? Now they're going to race through the rest of the year? I mean essentially most likely.
00:07:38.810 - 00:07:47.442, Speaker B: So I think the most likely scenario is another hike in November. And there's about, let's say ten basis points. Priceton and.
00:07:47.458 - 00:07:52.226, Speaker A: Right. They take a break here. Right. They don't do one in August or they don't do one in September. So none in August.
00:07:52.330 - 00:07:55.386, Speaker B: September, October, November, and then November.
00:07:55.450 - 00:08:04.028, Speaker A: September, November. Yeah. So you think a pause and then another one in November. Correct. Got it. So another 25 bps on top through the end of the year. Basically.
00:08:04.116 - 00:08:07.452, Speaker B: I think the market thinks there's another ten basis points left.
00:08:07.588 - 00:08:07.956, Speaker A: I see.
00:08:07.980 - 00:08:09.316, Speaker B: So they think less than half.
00:08:09.420 - 00:08:12.564, Speaker A: They think less than a 25 bps likelihood, quote unquote.
00:08:12.724 - 00:08:17.060, Speaker B: You think the full 25%, 40% probability of a hike.
00:08:17.132 - 00:08:17.784, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:18.364 - 00:08:26.240, Speaker B: But then what's really interesting, what's really interesting is also just the pricing around cuts. Right. And you know, when the.
00:08:26.312 - 00:08:31.664, Speaker A: So basically I saw this on the panel. Right. Like they people, the market is pricing cuts, like next year.
00:08:31.784 - 00:08:32.872, Speaker B: Next year, absolutely.
00:08:33.008 - 00:08:42.056, Speaker A: And it's like we're going to see that. We're not going to see cuts unless there's like economic. Massive economic issue. Right. Like if the recession appears, there's no reason to cut.
00:08:42.240 - 00:08:43.760, Speaker B: Right. That's what I think.
00:08:43.832 - 00:08:44.552, Speaker A: Yeah, that's my.
00:08:44.648 - 00:09:07.668, Speaker B: There has to be a structural, like premium or structural discount, however you want to think about it, because the risk is that when they do cut, they cut like 100. You don't know the magnitude of the cut. Right. Cause, you know, if we are in a recession, it's a hard landing and there's some shit happening. They could go 200 basis points in a day. That takes you back to neutral.
00:09:07.756 - 00:09:10.844, Speaker A: That's why they brought it all the way up here. So they have all that flexibility now. Yeah, correct.
00:09:10.924 - 00:09:36.772, Speaker B: And so it makes it really tricky. I see, to think about. Yeah. And so, like, you could look at the curve and be like, wait, terminal rates around, you know, 3350, whatever that band is, you know, might be too high. Because if we are going to hit that hard landing and all that, like, we're going to be cutting rates. Oh, the corn is going higher.
00:09:36.828 - 00:09:38.260, Speaker A: Let's go. 29.
00:09:38.292 - 00:09:38.652, Speaker B: Four.
00:09:38.748 - 00:09:38.980, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:39.012 - 00:09:39.452, Speaker B: 450.
00:09:39.508 - 00:09:44.264, Speaker A: Let's talk about the corn real quick before we break. I mean, you know, because we had a pretty big. I mean, we.
00:09:44.304 - 00:09:46.256, Speaker B: Oh, it's time for the corn to go now. Yeah.
00:09:46.280 - 00:10:07.728, Speaker A: And we pulled to the top of the range, like, or a yearly high briefly after what? After Blackrock's announcement about the ETF, like about over the last month. And then we were really just in that tight 30 to 31 range for like, weeks. Then we had a little bit of a dump over the weekend, last weekend and got down to what, 29 two ish. 29. 29 the figure or even 28 something.
00:10:07.776 - 00:10:10.934, Speaker B: Actually, briefly, yeah, basically 29,000 even so.
00:10:12.434 - 00:10:17.554, Speaker A: But still, we're super low volume. I mean, it's been in this thing for a while. What do we think?
00:10:17.594 - 00:11:19.710, Speaker B: What brings us out of this, fundamentally, if the market is perceiving the fed as ending their hiking cycle, or this is kind of it, and EU just had some really weak data, looks like budget is not going to go on curve control. This meeting, PBoC is easing, et cetera. And I'm looking at price action in things like silver and gold, and those things are trading really well. And just broader risk assets, stocks being close to the dead highs of the year. If you think about crypto as a function of risk assets and debasement hedges, both of those components would suggest that bitcoin should be doing well here. And then the other thing you think about are just more technical things like what is positioning and funding and derivatives positioning look like in bitcoin. And I think positioning is a lot cleaner than where it was a couple of weeks ago in terms of levered longs at the highs.
00:11:19.710 - 00:11:49.226, Speaker B: I do think that there's been a healthy sort of washout of weaker hands, let's put it that way, and that the path is set for a move higher, make no mistake. I think, you know, if you do believe that an ETF is coming, this asset is not priced for the kind of liquidity that is coming in. No, it is dramatically mispriced. And if you're telling me that the macro currents are going to be supportive of it, in addition to the fact that you're going to get a large ETF by, and don't forget you have.
00:11:49.250 - 00:11:52.826, Speaker A: The halving is going to happen about nine months from now, correct?
00:11:53.010 - 00:11:59.670, Speaker B: Ten months. I think dips are there to be bought and upsides there to be owned. It's that easy.
00:11:59.762 - 00:12:10.238, Speaker A: Love it. Hey, this is a great one. Absolutely. I love the. It does feel like easier to do Super bowl fed day now. It's not that everything.
00:12:10.286 - 00:12:13.554, Speaker B: It's not just pain. I know, right? We know where we're at.
00:12:15.654 - 00:12:19.654, Speaker A: Bim Netabee, our friend from galaxy trading. As always, my friend, thank you so much. Pleasure.
