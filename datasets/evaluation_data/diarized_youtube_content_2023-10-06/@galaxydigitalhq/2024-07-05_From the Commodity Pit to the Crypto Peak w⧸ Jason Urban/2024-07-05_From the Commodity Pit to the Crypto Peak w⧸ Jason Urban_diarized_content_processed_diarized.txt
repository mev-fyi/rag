00:00:00.680 - 00:00:03.622, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, an infinite amount of cash.
00:00:03.726 - 00:00:04.350, Speaker B: Cash.
00:00:04.510 - 00:00:05.702, Speaker A: I'm your host, Alex Thornton.
00:00:05.726 - 00:00:08.290, Speaker B: The us banking system is sound and resilient.
00:00:08.630 - 00:00:13.650, Speaker A: Bitcoin made a new all time high. If you're not long. If you're not long, you're short.
00:00:13.950 - 00:00:19.410, Speaker B: Satoshi's gonna come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet. All bitcoin's gonna be erased.
00:00:19.710 - 00:00:22.170, Speaker A: Bitcoin. Bitcoin's the best crypto else.
00:00:22.830 - 00:00:24.918, Speaker B: Bitcoin is going to zero.
00:00:25.094 - 00:00:40.738, Speaker A: Welcome back to Galaxy Brains. I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy. Bitcoin, not zero. And we have a great episode for you today. Jason Urban, head of Galaxy Trading, is our guest. He's back. He hasn't been on this show since January of 2023, and a lot has changed since then.
00:00:40.738 - 00:01:14.730, Speaker A: We're going to talk with Jason about what's going on at GDT and what the maturation and institutionalization of bitcoin and crypto markets looks like. We'll also check with our good friend Bimnet, a BB from Galaxy trading, as always, to talk markets. Before we get to all of that, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. We have a great one. Let's hop right into the show. Let's go now to our guest, Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, BIMnet, welcome to galaxy Brains.
00:01:15.230 - 00:01:16.390, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:01:16.510 - 00:01:27.930, Speaker A: So we got some data and there's some disruption also happening in the presidential election, which could impact markets. But let's start with the data. What are you watching? Has anything changed?
00:01:28.230 - 00:02:13.540, Speaker C: Yeah, ISM services came in dramatically weaker I than expected today. It was in contraction territory. I think it printed on a 47 handle, which is really, really low. And services make up a very large portion of the us economy. We are a services economy. To see that enter the contraction territory is ringing some alarm bells. You've had a very dramatic reaction in fixed income and in the dollar, where bond yields have rallied and the dollar has weakened pretty significantly for a holiday trading day.
00:02:13.540 - 00:03:12.294, Speaker C: Just for context, the index, ISM services index has been around for 27 years. Only in three instances has it or three periods has it actually printed in contraction territory. The first one was in 2001, around the tech bubble. The second one was 2008 2009, great financial crisis. And the third time was in 2020 during COVID This is a very meaningful indicator that the economy is slowing. And it supports some of the other data points that we've gotten over the past two weeks, particularly with respect to manufacturing activity and broader business conditions and inflation. So we've seen, we've had the CPI prints that were in line, the PC prints that, sorry, they were soft.
00:03:12.294 - 00:04:11.442, Speaker C: PC was soft ish. And so the inflation stuff is starting to cool and now the growth stuff is looking like it's starting to cool as well. And then in terms of the labor market, the labor market stats we got today were okay. Initial jobless claims in line ADP inline the ISM services employment component, still an expansionary expansion territory on a 56 handle. And so labor market is proving tricky to, to crack. But again, I think the focus is still on price measures and that's kind of what I'm still paying most attention to. But I do think if you do see a crack in the labor market in a meaningful way, the language you've heard out of Powell and other FOMC officials is that they will respond pretty aggressively, I think, to any dramatic weakening in the labor market.
00:04:11.442 - 00:04:24.674, Speaker C: So all in all we're seeing softening in the data and that's helping risk assets. Stocks are at fresh all time highs and that's helping bond markets kind of rally.
00:04:24.762 - 00:04:42.466, Speaker A: Yeah. What's happening with crypto in that? Because we're down pretty much across the board in crypto now for several weeks. Risk rally there. How do you view the divergence between equities and tech equities and cryptos at the moment?
00:04:42.578 - 00:06:03.382, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I think it's just a supply and demand function at galaxy we've seen a pretty healthy amount of selling flow. We've seen german government sell, we've seen a ton of overriding activity on dare bit and there's a ton of alt token supply that's regularly hitting the market. And then you've got the GoC supply, you've got a potential supply unlock in the ETF conversion potentially as well. And so it's just a story of lots of sellers and not that many buyers. And you've also, I think over the past two weeks you probably averaged net outflows out of the ETF products as well. And so really it's just an asset that is seeing a lot more supply than fresh demand versus when you think about tech stocks, they're constantly buying back their own shares, especially the big ones. And companies, especially in AI, have delivered consistent beats on earnings and growth expectations, et cetera.
00:06:03.382 - 00:06:32.238, Speaker C: And so there's real genuine organic revenue that's driving a lot and expected revenue. That's driving some of the price action in equities versus in crypto. We're still in the land of magic Internet money in certain instances. I really do think that until you get through a lot of this crypto supply, it's going to be hard to sustain a rally.
00:06:32.334 - 00:07:11.110, Speaker A: Yep. Understood. And then, okay, let's turn to this other market that people have been watching, the prediction markets on the presidential election. Yeah, I mean, one of the main things since President Biden's appearance a couple weeks ago at the presidential debate has been speculation about whether he will ultimately win the democratic presidential nomination. The idea whether or not he would drop out. Just today, as we record this on July 3, Kamala Harris is now trading at basically 50%, 49% likelihood versus Joe Biden's 31% likelihood. It's been dropping significantly.
00:07:11.110 - 00:07:35.970, Speaker A: Not so much questioning whether you follow that market as a trader and investor, but instead, you know, let's talk again. I've seen talk about the Trump trade. There have been some polls that have come out that show that president, former President Trump, is leading across many battleground states. What is the Trump trade as the street thinks about it as it relates to fixed income securities and or inflation and stuff?
00:07:36.830 - 00:08:42.700, Speaker C: Yeah, no, it's getting a little bit more complicated. You know, I would say the initial kind of gut trade for a Trump presidency, at least in my head, was a curve steepener that is a function of Trump wanting lower rates in addition to spending that's likely not going to get cut that much, in addition to tariff wars and labor supply, that's going to get deported, really. And so initially, my gut instinct is telling me that the curve should steepen as a function of the two year yield going down and kind of the long term viability of government debt and spending being an issue, and kind of trade wars and geopolitical risks. I think that was kind of the trait I had in my head. But it's. I'll give you the comparison to equities, though. Historically, it does not matter who's president.
00:08:42.700 - 00:09:45.640, Speaker C: Stocks just go up. And as long as there's still dysfunction in Congress and in the Senate, typically the US economy just continues chugging along. And so with respect to the equity market, I do think that Trump pays attention to it, more so than most presidents, I would say. But it's not necessarily clear that a Trump victory versus a Biden victory is going to send the market relatively higher or lower. I think that there's some trades to do between sectors and stuff, but that's, again, still a little bit unclear. Bitcoin and crypto seems like the most clear trade for an election trade to me, because, you know, he's definitely come out as supportive as possible for crypto. And so I think a change of the guard in the SEC would be viewed constructively as well.
00:09:45.640 - 00:10:31.120, Speaker C: And so I do think that being long crypto makes a lot of sense. I actually like a handful of crypto equity names in particular, because they also have kind of the energy and AI power theme going for them as well. When you throw in crypto regulation, that's a little bit more friendly. In addition to continued AI and power narrative spreading in the market, I tend to think that some of these crypto equities still have a lot of Runway to run. I think one of the clearest trades for the election is probably long crypto. And there you go.
00:10:31.780 - 00:10:36.468, Speaker A: Appreciate it. Bimnet Abibi, my friend from Galaxy trading. As always, thanks for coming on. Galaxy brains.
00:10:36.604 - 00:10:37.440, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:10:38.500 - 00:10:43.308, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, Jason Urban, head of Galaxy trading. Jason, welcome back to Galaxy Brains.
00:10:43.444 - 00:10:48.148, Speaker B: Thanks, Alex. This is great. I feel like it's. You only bring me in here once in a blue moon.
00:10:48.284 - 00:11:10.646, Speaker A: It's been over a year, and I think your first appearance was in January of 2023. I'm looking over my shoulder. Well, crap. Actually, the wifi went out, so I don't know the price of bitcoin, but it was like 16 to think when you were here today, as we record, we're in the sixties. Wow.
00:11:10.798 - 00:11:14.406, Speaker B: Yeah, it's been a run.
00:11:14.518 - 00:11:29.036, Speaker A: We had the banking crisis, the collapse of Silicon Valley bank, the takeover of signature bank. Bitcoin rallied on that. This was again over a year ago. March of 23. Bitcoin went up a fair amount on the banking collapse.
00:11:29.068 - 00:11:37.220, Speaker B: Well, I mean, a lot of that, though, was people trying to pull their money out. And where do you feel comfortable putting it? Well, I feel I'm going to buy something. I'm going to buy bitcoin.
00:11:37.260 - 00:11:38.020, Speaker A: Yeah, bitcoin.
00:11:38.140 - 00:11:44.404, Speaker B: It was actually the first time that you really saw it as a flight to quality or a flight to safety, which was really interesting.
00:11:44.452 - 00:11:53.160, Speaker A: I agree. That was my take, too. I think that bitcoin can't have a maturity duration mismatch of its underlying bond portfolio.
00:11:53.950 - 00:11:58.926, Speaker B: Exactly. I mean, the ALM mismatch doesn't really exist in some of these things.
00:11:58.998 - 00:12:23.848, Speaker A: No, not really. And then a bunch of other stuff has happened. And, in fact, for example, this is a different part of our company. We had Chris Ryan on previously, to mention this. He is the one who does the advisory with the FTX estate. But just as the FTX estate is preparing, I read in news stories, to actually deliver money back finally, like, what a saga that's been.
00:12:23.904 - 00:12:25.192, Speaker B: I mean, that is because you came.
00:12:25.216 - 00:12:27.312, Speaker A: On only a couple months after FTX collapsed.
00:12:27.376 - 00:12:46.776, Speaker B: Yeah. And that we were still in the throes of what's going to happen and how bad is it going to be. And, you know, here we are. Here we are. The market has rebounded significantly. You know, the creditors are going to get paid. And so, yes, it's not necessarily getting paid in crypto, but it's getting value back.
00:12:46.776 - 00:13:30.588, Speaker B: And so I think that's a huge win. And it also, we're trying to, we're trying to move past the bad actors. There have been a lot of news stories around that, and it's easy to vilify that. But you and I both know that the vast majority of the ecosystem are actually highly ethical, highly motivated, very thoughtful people. And so I think that returning the funds is gonna go a long way to people starting to realize, like, this innovation, this technological change is gonna be so valuable for finance, for, for everything. It's going to change the way the world works. So I think the first step is to, sometimes you got to choke through, get that through the snake before you can.
00:13:30.724 - 00:13:45.868, Speaker A: And Sam's behind bars, too, so it is wrapping up. And that, man, that was a huge part of this story. You've been in the space a long time. Was that the most dramatic thing that you saw since you've been working in it?
00:13:46.004 - 00:14:04.070, Speaker B: It was because it was so. It was. FTX had become so ingrained in the ethos of the ecosystem. People used it to trade people Super bowl commercials. Like, that was kind of like every umpire, there's stadiums. Like, it was everywhere. And so now that that's, you know, like, listen, we're so much more than that.
00:14:04.070 - 00:14:34.182, Speaker B: Let's go and let's move forth and get past this bad moment. I mean, listen, Tradfi had the Enron moments, and there were so many. Yeah, this has happened. And that didn't, the 2008 financial crisis didn't sink finance. It didn't destroy the banking system globally. It was a hiccup. I think when we look back now at the time, living through zero eight, you're like, oh, my God, guns and water, and that's what I need.
00:14:34.182 - 00:14:46.398, Speaker B: And now you look back and you're like, yeah, that kind of stunk. But it wasn't the end of the world. Some things that came out of it were good. Some things were still kind of working through, which, you know, is what it is.
00:14:46.454 - 00:15:00.290, Speaker A: But it does feel like a maturation of the space. And, you know, you gotta even write so many of the rules and good consumer safety regulations in traditional finance are born out of these things, 100%.
00:15:01.110 - 00:15:30.180, Speaker B: There's two ways to look at it. I think that we take the glass half full approach that this is. We got a lot of the less mature players out of the ecosystem. We've always done things what we believe is the right way. Regulation hand in hand with regulators, intelligent financial soundness and risk controls. And that's what's allowed us to survive and now thrive. And so this is a good thing, right? This kind of burns down the forest to let the real trees grow back.
00:15:31.000 - 00:16:09.680, Speaker A: I'm gonna get a good Jason urban colloquialism out of every one of these answers. That's a great one. So with that maturation, though, and bitcoin, I don't know what tripling basically more than tripling off that low since the FTX collapse. What does the interest look like at GDT now? I mean, it's like, I remember even last summer when we were kind of back after Blackrock filed for their bitcoin ETF in June of 23. Last summer was slow, man. People were sort of just waiting for this ruling with the grayscale, and I was like, I know I've seen a lot more activity. How would you describe the level of institutional and mature interest?
00:16:09.800 - 00:16:30.280, Speaker B: So I think that the level of interest everywhere has gone up substantially. Like the first quarter for us was booming. You really couldn't. People were strapped to their chairs because they couldn't get up. It was that busy. Obviously, we're hitting the summer months here, and you get a natural slowdown. We're moving into the election cycle.
00:16:30.280 - 00:17:08.730, Speaker B: So that's going to, going to play a big role, especially with where crypto is now becoming a political issue. It shouldn't be. I mean, progress shouldn't be something that we fall on one side of the aisle or the other, but it has. And the hope, I think, broadly, is that it becomes less if both sides embrace it. And now we can say, all right, let's talk about how to. Let's talk about keeping America as that shining city on the hill that embraces innovation, embraces thought leaders, and doesn't force them offshore. Because, as you and I both know, we spend a lot of time not in the United States for a reason.
00:17:08.730 - 00:17:14.318, Speaker B: And hopefully we can bring some of that home, some of that ip home some of that talent home, quite frankly.
00:17:14.374 - 00:17:25.014, Speaker A: So you think, I mean, normally summer months are in traditional markets, too, or lower volume, right? Yeah. But you think the election in particular might be a reason probably in traditional markets too, right?
00:17:25.102 - 00:17:51.382, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it's definitely like we've seen it every election cycle. You get that lull before the storm. People spend this time doing their homework, putting their bets on whatever those bets are, and then it's kind of wait and see. And then as you get closer, people will either roll because they were wrong or they'll double down because they were right or whatever. However that kind of works. And so we're seeing a lot of activity, and we're also seeing activity just broadly. You've got the ETF'S.
00:17:51.382 - 00:18:14.076, Speaker B: People are talking about ETH and Ethereum ETF's. Yeah. So the Eth ETF comes and what does that mean? And how do you think about bitcoin versus eth? And then you throw in Solana, you know, and other things that are coming along, and so all of a sudden you have people that are interested. But right now it's kind of like, what is your short term catalyst? You know, there's a few political ones, I think. I don't think that there's.
00:18:14.228 - 00:18:14.964, Speaker A: I agree with that.
00:18:15.012 - 00:18:17.836, Speaker B: You know, I don't think there's anything that's screaming that you're looking at.
00:18:17.948 - 00:18:33.280, Speaker A: You know, it's like macro or geopolitical conditions, but those are mostly unknown. Yeah, and I agree. I think the election is the biggest catalyst probably in all markets, frankly. There may be others in other markets that I'm not aware of. I don't know everything about every market.
00:18:33.400 - 00:19:09.182, Speaker B: Yeah. Broadly speaking, the election, it plays such an important role, and inflation is obviously front and center with everybody. And you draw a linkage between elections, although with two populist candidates, I think broadly for our ecosystem, it matters. It's going to be either way, it's going to be good. I think that see some changes in some of the regulators, just the natural four year roll off, and that could very well be a positive, you know, at least a different way to look at things. And we're starting to see some legislation come through that, you know, has the ability to really be, you know, positive.
00:19:09.246 - 00:19:20.408, Speaker A: Yeah. Clarifying. I mean, the biggest question is what is a digital security or a commodity, basically, or neither of those. Right. The definitions of, like, who actually, you.
00:19:20.424 - 00:19:37.392, Speaker B: Know, we've always maintained here, you know, I mean, we care what the rules are, but more important than what the rule is is that there's actually a rule, because it really, you know, where there's clarity. You can at least say, all right, this is what we can offer you, because this is what can, you know, what works inside of that.
00:19:37.496 - 00:19:47.762, Speaker A: And if you're an investor, you can make a longer term investment. If you're operating a business, we can invest in our business long term with that, and just knowing and having certainty about what the rules are and will.
00:19:47.786 - 00:19:56.906, Speaker B: Be 100%, just tell us where the guardrails are and then let us drive in the middle.
00:19:56.978 - 00:20:12.234, Speaker A: So you mentioned Solana. I know. It was reported by several outlets that Galaxy Digital trading had led a syndicate to acquire locked Solana from the FTX estate. Not only galaxy, eight, others, too.
00:20:12.362 - 00:20:47.284, Speaker B: It was open to everyone, and we, we entered into the process no different than any other arm's length transaction as it had to be. We were fortunate to be able to use our network to get to quite a number of people, and that unlocked a lot of value for those clients. And so I think that we have a client base that's pretty pleased with things. It's obviously good for our business, it's good for things that we do, and there's positive externalities for us in the sense that, okay, we're one of the largest validators in the Solana ecosystem. Right?
00:20:47.332 - 00:20:49.700, Speaker A: I think, as far as I saw, you are the largest.
00:20:49.820 - 00:20:58.204, Speaker B: Listen, who knows when this is going to air? I don't want to toot my own horn and then all of a sudden find out that it's right.
00:20:58.292 - 00:21:01.044, Speaker A: But galaxy is staking now.
00:21:01.092 - 00:21:29.990, Speaker B: Well, a very important part of our business, and part of the people often say, well, tell me what galaxy does. The canned answer is, we do everything. Some things we do very well, some things not so well. But our strength and our weakness is that we touch the entire ecosystem. The advisory team took a GDT client and just tokenized the Stradivarius, which was out. That's kind of neat. That's old world, new world coming together.
00:21:29.990 - 00:21:59.518, Speaker B: We have to have 1ft firmly planted in Tradfi. And the way things are comfortable for people that have been doing this for hundreds of years, like the banking system, but we also have to have 1ft in progress and innovation, and that's an example. The Solana validating business is a big example. Same thing with what we're doing with ETH, with some of the other protocols. And that's one of the things that we do, is we work with these protocols. We work with the protocols to. There we go.
00:21:59.534 - 00:22:01.310, Speaker A: It's back. The black clock's back, baby.
00:22:01.390 - 00:22:28.826, Speaker B: Listen, get a little higher, will you? But we work with the protocols to one, bring proper financial management tools to them, whether it's hedging or loans or the way to think about treasury and their capital formation. And it's also great for our investors because we're able to match pools of capital with people who need it and then offer financial products on top of that that enhance the experience for both of them.
00:22:28.898 - 00:22:29.106, Speaker A: Right.
00:22:29.138 - 00:22:32.994, Speaker B: And quite honestly, and we make money along the way because we're not. We're not communists.
00:22:33.042 - 00:22:36.226, Speaker A: Well, we're a service business in that sense, financial services. Right.
00:22:36.298 - 00:22:42.538, Speaker B: 100%. So that's what we do. And in order to do that, you have to be in every part of the ecosystem.
00:22:42.674 - 00:23:03.350, Speaker A: It is kind of amazing to think about when you step back, if you look at galaxy, obviously, we have a venture business which was used to be on balance sheet, but we've announced that we're taking it into an LPGP structure with outside capital. So you got venture, you got mining. We mine bitcoin. A lot of large bitcoin.
00:23:03.730 - 00:23:04.450, Speaker B: Huge, huge.
00:23:04.490 - 00:23:11.830, Speaker A: I love visiting helios. That place is amazing. It's huge. Great people work there, too, also in spurtainous. Awesome place. But we're mining now. We're validating.
00:23:11.830 - 00:23:22.674, Speaker A: We're obviously trading and doing everything that a traditional trading desk does. Lending, derivatives, electronic and on chain stuff.
00:23:22.682 - 00:23:27.170, Speaker B: We're a monster on chain player because we're interacting in that as well.
00:23:27.250 - 00:23:43.506, Speaker A: You have mergers advisory, so, like, transactional advisory, whether it's m and a or capital formation or whatever, you've got an entire. I haven't even mentioned the asset manager, which is, I think, behind Grayscale. My understanding, just by the numbers, is the second largest crypto asset manager in the world. And that's just.
00:23:43.538 - 00:23:46.170, Speaker B: Cause, you know, and that's everything that's active, that's passive.
00:23:46.210 - 00:23:51.510, Speaker A: That's crazy, though. Like, to think about it. A lot of stuff going on at this mecca.
00:23:52.170 - 00:24:21.892, Speaker B: There's a ton of stuff going on. Obviously, inside of trading broadly, we're rolling out prime, we're rolling out these tools. So we touch everything globally in every way you can do it. And that's really the power of this place, obviously. You know, it's hard to do that. Like, I always joke that it's like the movie the 300. And Lanity shows up and he's got his 300 soldiers, and he meets somebody coming down and they're like, how many? You only brought 300 soldiers? And he says, you're a potter, you're a painter.
00:24:21.892 - 00:24:37.698, Speaker B: He goes, what are you I'm a soldier. See, I brought more soldiers than you. Like, our 500 people do the work of 5000. And every day they're killing themselves to be the best. And that's what keeps us, you know, at the front in a lot of these different verticals.
00:24:37.794 - 00:24:57.426, Speaker A: So I want to ask you about the difference. You're an old commodities trading guy, right? That's your background in Chicago? I've got a couple funny things to ask you about this, but I can only wait. How does that. I mean, commodities are global. There's no central exchange for commodities. There's the options. The futures and options places.
00:24:57.426 - 00:25:03.368, Speaker A: But for spot, right? Like, I mean, spot gold, where does that trade? Everywhere, right? I mean, it trades in pawn shops.
00:25:03.424 - 00:25:05.152, Speaker B: All over the country. Costco now.
00:25:05.256 - 00:25:29.440, Speaker A: Exactly. So is there, like, was there a thing where, like, bitcoin and other cryptos, like, made sense to you partially because of coming? I know a lot of people that come from, like, gold and, like, materials and commodities in crypto. Like, how would you compare, like, moving from one to the other? And also, is it a global trading business you run now, is that also similar, or.
00:25:29.740 - 00:26:04.884, Speaker B: Yeah, so broadly, if you step back and say, okay, the commodity nature of what we do, and to use gold as an example, I often say that this is one of the first times that I've tried. I've racked my brain to figure this out. It's one of the first times where you have, since gold, where you have a commodity that's also a currency. Right. That's really interesting. And it's not only it's a currency, it's also a technology that's a currency. So, like, gold is the last time I really thought of, okay, that was a technological advancement that people, 20,000 years.
00:26:04.892 - 00:26:06.284, Speaker A: Ago it was, though, for sure.
00:26:06.372 - 00:26:46.296, Speaker B: And then it became, okay, well, I can go anywhere and do that same thing. You look at what crypto is, and in a lot of ways, there's a utility to it. A smart contract is a technological thing, but it's also got a manifestation in a coin. And so it's really interesting in terms of the commodity trading. Yeah, there's supply and demand, and there's that psychological element of trading where we were just talking today about how some of the volume surfaces are moving based on what we're seeing in the markets and the elections and things coming out. Part of how those surfaces move that is there's a psychological component, there's a mathematical component. You got to be able to.
00:26:46.296 - 00:26:56.734, Speaker B: Some of these guys can divide by zero, but you have to be able to do the math, but you also have to understand, well, this is being reflected this way because there's a, like, I think it's going higher.
00:26:56.782 - 00:26:58.126, Speaker A: I think it's gonna be better.
00:26:58.318 - 00:27:03.110, Speaker B: And so therefore the curves behave a certain way. And that's an interesting element.
00:27:03.190 - 00:27:03.406, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:27:03.438 - 00:27:28.112, Speaker A: And like, for example, like just specifically on the options markets right now, like I saw, there's still some pretty, you know, I would say there's not a lot of, there were a lot of like, downside protection happening in bitcoin over the last, you know, since we came down from the 70k area, but still a lot of bullish prints for the end of the year. People still think, what's your read on these markets? What are they telling us right now?
00:27:28.256 - 00:27:46.286, Speaker B: I think there's still a lot of people that expect a real run into the end of the year. You're seeing people position for that. I think some of that is election based depending on. Okay. You'll have a sense of. You'll definitely have a sense in November. We hope that there's a finite answer.
00:27:46.286 - 00:27:54.850, Speaker B: I certainly hope it's not a repeat of the bush gore days. And, oh, it's a hanging chad. That's a pregnant chad. What's the difference?
00:27:56.430 - 00:28:00.534, Speaker A: Yeah. Debating whether a whole punch was really sufficient. Was the paper punched?
00:28:00.582 - 00:28:05.566, Speaker B: Yeah. But did it break? I don't want to have to live. I don't think any, the country wants to do that.
00:28:05.638 - 00:28:06.726, Speaker A: We probably won't have to.
00:28:06.758 - 00:29:03.308, Speaker B: But you'll have clarity through the end of the year and you'll have people who are positioning and saying, okay, you know, regardless of who gets elected, does that change the regulatory landscape? What happens with the things that are in Congress right now being debated? So people are positioning positively for that. I think that you're also, it's an interesting thing and this is a market structure component, but a lot of the, what I'll call the back office providers or the clearing providers inside of the traditional markets haven't been able or willing to touch the ETF yet. So you have all these rias who want to sell it to their clients but can't yet. And those back office providers, those clearing providers, they're going to adopt this. They've already said we're going to do it. We just need to work through our systems. So as that happens, you're going to all of a sudden get a lot of demand that we haven't really looked at coming online.
00:29:03.308 - 00:29:39.556, Speaker B: And I think that that could be really, really powerful. So you've got a positive, you know, a potentially positive outcome via the election, regardless of which way it goes. You have it becoming more institutionalized through the ETF's and that coming online. And so the combination of those things as well as, as long as there isn't a major negative catalyst, I mean, we'll see what happens with Gox, we'll see what happens with some of these wallets where we see governments moving things. But I think that broadly, there's a good narrative around this that says, hey, things could be really strong until the end of the. And I think people are positioning accordingly.
00:29:39.628 - 00:30:13.328, Speaker A: It still feels like retail. And there isn't actually crypto mania. It doesn't really feel like that. There is the meme coins, maybe our counterpoint to this, but I still think that's mostly like existing, like crypto. Like, you know, DJN's quote unquote. It's not like, although I hear, you know, you get anecdotes of like, oh, such and such came out of the woodwork tasking about crypto again from my high school days or whatever, that does happen. But, like, it actually still feels like that bitcoin rally from the start of the year until now and through now and even from last fall was a hated rally.
00:30:13.328 - 00:30:15.200, Speaker A: People were not in it, really.
00:30:15.280 - 00:30:59.548, Speaker B: No. I think that there's, what you had is you had bits and pieces of people feeling the fomo, and then you'd see, like, we'd see a lot of our tradfi clients pop in, right? And then they would, then they pop out, and then it's, you know, so you saw it, but it hasn't been what I would call a mania. But again, the parallel that I'll draw to 21 is the people that we are seeing coming in and having conversations with, they're doing it meaningfully, and they take a long time to get the engine going. But once that engine goes, I mean, we saw it with ETF's and some of the names that were big holders of the ETF's that came out. I mean, there were some powerhouses of tradfi in there.
00:30:59.724 - 00:31:00.644, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:31:00.812 - 00:31:16.092, Speaker B: And the ETF is easy for them because they have the mechanism. They'll get the mechanism, and they're working with us to get the mechanism for the spot side of the trade. And then I think you start to really see that become that reflexive positive feedback loop.
00:31:16.156 - 00:31:37.812, Speaker A: So you mentioned the tokenized strata various that galaxy did, which I think is pretty obviously it's real, but it's obviously a first step. It's sort of a proof of concept tokenization. Is. I mean, how long have you been hearing that word? I've been hearing it. I used to joke there were more of these platforms that would do it than there were tokens, issued tokens. You're getting more. You got real world assets coming on.
00:31:37.812 - 00:31:38.708, Speaker A: Chain and stuff now.
00:31:38.764 - 00:31:44.188, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean here. So it's funny, you talk about my commodity background and my rail stuff.
00:31:44.244 - 00:31:52.300, Speaker A: Yes, we talked about that last time you were here. But Jason's a longtime fan of railroad, owner of rail cars.
00:31:52.340 - 00:32:33.210, Speaker B: I'm a fan of money, but rail cars are just one way to do it. But what's interesting is I had a conversation just recently with somebody who wanted to tokenize a fleet of rail cars. And the rationale was it would help with maintenance and things. Because tokenizing an asset, tokenizing a building, there has to be a reason, there has to be a utility that comes from that. It can't just be like, people outside of our world don't just tokenize things because, oh, it's a fun hobby, all right. They do it because there has to be a utility. Now, in this particular case, there's a maintenance history and things that can be very valuable and preventative and save people a lot of money.
00:32:33.210 - 00:33:22.006, Speaker B: And then that extends to the airline industry, the automotive industry. Real world use cases are great. I think we're seeing that. Sometimes I think it's a solution in search of a problem, and sometimes I think that there's a problem that it solves. And so when you're thinking about tokenization projects or you're thinking about those type of things, like, ask yourself, like, what does this solve? Is it just a neat, like the Stradivarius was neat because it's something that you can see, a world where a dao can now take something and you want to play it at a family wedding and you're part of the dao that can then vote and say, you know, hey, I'd like to play this. And this is what I've done. And now there's a utility to it, and it's a way to get what is a captive or dead asset, dormant asset back into.
00:33:22.006 - 00:33:42.720, Speaker B: Unlock it a little bit, unlock giving people. And you can do that with art, you can do that with vacation properties. There's so many places that this goes. It's easy when it's a single piece of wooden leather that you're doing, but at some point there's a places to go. But again, it has to be a solution to a problem, not a solution looking for a problem. Totally.
00:33:43.820 - 00:34:01.360, Speaker A: And it has been a solution. Looking for a problem for a long time, even to be honest, we have more now. But bitcoin is a store of value that has product market fit. I think bitcoin is a medium of exchange. Not really. You can use it, but I wouldn't call it product market.
00:34:02.420 - 00:34:07.790, Speaker B: We've seen whether it's lightning or other things. But you need to.
00:34:07.910 - 00:34:36.866, Speaker A: People do and you can pay with it, but it's not like every, I mean, look, in some places it's different. But I'm Apple pay everywhere in New York, I don't need anything else. Right. But also, then you go down the stack, you say, okay, what about Defi? And you're like, well, I would say it's probably more. It's more product market fit than bitcoin as a medium of exchange. But it's still really. I don't see anyone in traditional finance saying, gosh darn it, I wish I could trade this stock on an Amm instead of through my broker.
00:34:36.866 - 00:34:43.050, Speaker A: Right. Like finance, actual big finance, centralized finance. It works pretty well for the people.
00:34:43.090 - 00:34:56.938, Speaker B: That have money now where that could become interesting, and this is where, you know, it's a progression, is how many people work in the middle office at JP Morgan and does blockchain. Does blockchain fix.
00:34:56.994 - 00:34:58.210, Speaker A: This is where I wanted to go with this.
00:34:58.250 - 00:34:59.010, Speaker B: Fix that problem.
00:34:59.090 - 00:35:27.086, Speaker A: This is where I want to go. Because the most interesting thing, thing to me to tokenize is equities equity securities. Right? And the DTCC wrote this in 2016, one of the best papers about blockchain very early, saying, oh, gosh, like, we should probably be completely disintermediated by this thing. It would be great. Where are they? Or what do you think? Or when will that future, if ever happen where things like the New York Stock Exchange or the DTCC are somehow disintermediate or they incorporate it, or disinfect.
00:35:27.278 - 00:35:58.718, Speaker B: I think they incorporate it. I think you see a world where, and this is again the future predictions. Taking your Apple stock. See the Apple logo on this computer? You take your Apple stock and you tokenize it. You've got a dividend yield that you're getting there and potentially using it as a collateral object that gets pledged somewhere and you get some income from that. Inside of defi, there's so many ways that this can go where this becomes a powerful thing. I think we have to, one, get clarity on what's a security and what's not.
00:35:58.718 - 00:36:02.062, Speaker B: Like, there's a lot of things that have to happen before we get to.
00:36:02.086 - 00:36:16.022, Speaker A: That point where, and all these touch points that work with securities, whether it's broker dealers or custodians or exchanges that are highly regulated, don't really have any ability currently to do anything with a blockchain, period.
00:36:16.126 - 00:36:33.488, Speaker B: Yeah. And what you're seeing there, it's not because there's not a willingness, but there's a fear, right? And if you think about markets to talk trading, it's fear and greed, right. And fear is always greater than greed in the sense of, like, what wins the day. Right?
00:36:33.544 - 00:36:34.320, Speaker A: Like, if there's both.
00:36:34.360 - 00:37:43.578, Speaker B: And if you're super greedy and optimistic, and I'm terrified if something bad's gonna happen. Like, I'm gonna be more motivated by, I think, my fear than you are by your greed at the extremes, at the far end of the belt distribution. So the people at some of these organizations, they want to do it, but they're like, if I touch this and the regulator comes in and comes after me for whatever reason, whatever regulator, and it's not just, you know, it's not just the SEC or the CFTC, but you've got, you know, FDIC and FINRA, you start to get that Alphabet soup and all it takes is one. And if you're not a believer or you don't understand it or you see it like, shit, I don't want to touch this. Yeah, give me, give me a, you know, give me a reason to. And it's entrepreneurs and forward thinkers that are the ones, and usually, like, most of us who have come from, you know, you, Fido, me, DRW, and Goldman, like, you leave those institutions when you finally get orange pilled and you're like, hey, this is awesome. Like, this is the future.
00:37:43.578 - 00:37:46.962, Speaker B: You're like, well, I can't get anything done here. Let me go somewhere else.
00:37:47.026 - 00:38:11.266, Speaker A: Yeah, it's actually kind of crazy that at the probably, and there are others collectibles gaming, who knows what we'll see comes from blockchains, ultimately. But pretty much the primary market that bitcoin and ether and cryptos are trying to disrupt is the most highly regulated market in the history of the world. And that's usually not possible. Like, that's regulatory regulations create moats as well, right?
00:38:11.298 - 00:38:11.586, Speaker B: Yeah, sure.
00:38:11.618 - 00:38:15.160, Speaker A: They protect the regulated entities as much as they require from them.
00:38:15.240 - 00:38:21.520, Speaker B: And that's part of the reason why we as an organization embrace regulation. I mean, how much time do you spend in DC and talking to.
00:38:21.560 - 00:38:28.860, Speaker A: Fairly large amount. Yeah, I would say probably about like a third of the research we've written in the last two years publicly has all has been regulatory.
00:38:30.000 - 00:39:10.140, Speaker B: But you need to embrace it, because like, you know, I remember this was early, this was 2018, and I was on a panel with one of the founders of Anchorage and we were arguing back and forth about decentralization. And I said, do you want to be right or do you. And bitcoin was about $6,000 at the time. And I said, do you want to be right or do you want to be happy? And I said, if you want to be right, go tell the regulators that they can pound sand if you want to be happy. Let's find a way to work with the regulators. Because at the time, bitcoin said it's either going to be 6000 or 60,000. If it's 6000, we can all go home because nobody cares.
00:39:10.140 - 00:39:20.772, Speaker B: It's just a hobby. If it's 60,000, it starts to become a real financial asset that people want to have in their portfolios. That leads to other adoption, that leads to innovation, and that leads to more.
00:39:20.796 - 00:39:30.260, Speaker A: Valuable than all the world's silver. I don't think people realize this. It's $1.2 trillion asset by itself, just bitcoin. So I agree. Yes, that starts to matter.
00:39:30.340 - 00:39:39.214, Speaker B: Yeah, it starts to show up, but in order for that to be real, you have to. You have to want to work within the system a little bit. Like, yes, we could still, you don't.
00:39:39.262 - 00:40:03.400, Speaker A: Change it, but you can't. Yeah, I mean, this is the most structured and regulated part of it. You know what I mean? It's like, do you think we would have gotten, and this is a comparison I do sometimes. But do you think if newspapers were highly regulated, would the Internet have even worked? I mean. I mean, you know what I mean? It's too bad for the newspapers. They didn't have all these rules that were hard to break in on. I mean, it's a big ask, and I don't think you're gonna.
00:40:03.400 - 00:40:09.840, Speaker A: It's not like, oh, man, we invented some technology. The last 250 years of financial regulation is just gone forever.
00:40:09.960 - 00:40:10.648, Speaker B: Don't worry about it.
00:40:10.664 - 00:40:11.656, Speaker A: It's not gonna work like that.
00:40:11.688 - 00:40:39.350, Speaker B: But it's interesting when you think about the history of banking and you go back to the Medici and then it moved to the Dutch, and then the Dutch ultimately lost it to the English. Now part of that is geopolitical, but part of it was adoption of innovation. That's true, because the United States was willing to do things that, that the British Commonwealth wasn't. And so the banking system moved from London to New York. Now the concern is, my concern broadly is like, if we don't embrace this innovation, it's gonna go somewhere else.
00:40:39.390 - 00:40:42.830, Speaker A: What if it goes from New York to Hong Kong or New York to Abu Dhabi instead?
00:40:42.910 - 00:41:29.160, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, there's definitely, we definitely see a movement of wealth broadly from west to east. Right now you're seeing it, and you're seeing Dubai, Abu Dhabi, be the beneficiary of that on its way. But it's everything. It's also like you can't think of it as a location as much as this is a global currency. Maybe this is the pivot from society's perspective. And I don't want to make this too philosophical, but where we've moved from a nation state geopolitical center of banking to this universe, or metaverse of banking, and it becomes decentralized, we give it from a location of rent seekers to actually all the people that are using it. And that is the decentralization.
00:41:29.160 - 00:41:39.272, Speaker B: That is what the ethos is now. That takes time. That doesn't happen overnight. This is a gradual thing. And so that could be interesting, could be one version of the world.
00:41:39.416 - 00:41:56.470, Speaker A: So before we wrap, I wanted to ask you, you were telling me about the, I always like to ask Jason about this, working in the pits in Chicago, the trading pits guys used a lot of hand signals and stuff, right? Why don't we have those here on. We should just have, I know we don't really need them. Everything's digital, but let's get them going on our trading floor.
00:41:57.330 - 00:41:59.070, Speaker B: I bought two. I bought two.
00:42:00.130 - 00:42:10.178, Speaker A: Right? Because all the different, the banks and the brokers are down there on the floor. You guys are putting in orders and trading with each other on behalf of others. That's what a broker does.
00:42:10.314 - 00:42:17.146, Speaker B: Well, we were trading, we were trading our own account from a proprietary perspective, but you had to know what other.
00:42:17.178 - 00:42:22.230, Speaker A: People were doing signals for. Like who bank.
00:42:22.810 - 00:42:24.330, Speaker B: Goldman's doing it. So gold ring.
00:42:24.370 - 00:42:25.058, Speaker A: Gold ring. Yes.
00:42:25.114 - 00:42:38.362, Speaker B: Goldman. Goldman's doing it. You know, you know, Goldman's buying or whatever, you know, Lehman brothers, Shearsen, Lehman. So Shearson, you know, so it was a scissors, like everybody, you know, everybody. Merrill lynch, back before we had the horns. Yeah, the horn. Merrill's buying.
00:42:38.546 - 00:42:40.634, Speaker A: What would Galaxy's hand signal be, you think?
00:42:40.722 - 00:42:41.830, Speaker B: Oh, I don't know.
00:42:43.610 - 00:42:45.230, Speaker A: The galaxy brain or whatever.
00:42:45.610 - 00:42:52.362, Speaker B: Something. I'll actually, I'll come, I'll do something for the next, when we have you.
00:42:52.386 - 00:42:57.070, Speaker A: Back, you gotta tell us. We're gonna start. We'll do the first half of the pot and, like, good code.
00:42:57.970 - 00:43:04.710, Speaker B: We're across a football field and trying to do you know, hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions. Yeah. So it was.
00:43:05.130 - 00:43:09.138, Speaker A: Well, Jason, thank you so much, as always, for coming on galaxy brains. And we'll see you next time.
00:43:09.194 - 00:43:11.270, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. Thanks, Alex. This is great.
