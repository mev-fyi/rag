00:00:07.760 - 00:00:12.518, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, BiMnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:12.646 - 00:00:13.702, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:13.838 - 00:00:29.824, Speaker A: It's been an exciting week. When we recorded last week, we recorded right after the bitcoin ETF's were approved. Yep. But now we're recording on Wednesday and they've traded for three full trading days. Thursday, Friday, Tuesday. Monday was a holiday in the United States. The markets were closed.
00:00:29.824 - 00:00:34.824, Speaker A: Let's get right to it. What are your takes so far on the ETF complex?
00:00:35.164 - 00:01:30.926, Speaker B: I think the total flows into the product are anemic at this point. I think the figures are, as of yesterday, there was $800 million of net inflows into the ETF's, of which grayscale had 1.8 yards that were outflows. And I think a lot of the inflows of the net inflows were a function of people just exchanging bitcoin or some other exposure or some other bitcoin related exposure into the ETF. And so high level, I think the net amount of new money that entered the space because of the ETF is a lot smaller than people think. And I worry from the standpoint that there aren't too many near term catalysts for bitcoin. The havening is a long ways away.
00:01:31.030 - 00:01:31.830, Speaker A: Three months or so.
00:01:31.862 - 00:02:12.534, Speaker B: Yeah. The ETH ETF is probably way, way longer away. And macro conditions were about as good as they could have possibly been for the ETF launch. Bond yields were at their dead lows, stocks were at the dead highs, and that's starting to turn a little bit now. And so I see a market that has spent the last year, mainly the last six months, bidding up bitcoin and bitcoin related exposure in anticipation of this ETF bringing in new inflows. And we aren't really getting those inflows. And I see an asset right now that's basically unchanged on the year we started the year basically at this exact same level.
00:02:12.534 - 00:02:48.216, Speaker B: And I think there are going to be a lot of folks that have bought in the run, like higher than here, basically, that are going to be underwater, and a lot of folks that are probably going to be less enthusiastic about bitcoin because it's not going to have the same volume profile right now. You've taken out a lot of the speculative positioning. There's no near term catalyst. I don't see a scenario where I'm Fomo chasing bitcoin at the dead highs, whereas you got paid to do that for the last six months. You bought the highs at any point in the last six months.
00:02:48.240 - 00:02:48.896, Speaker A: And then it went higher.
00:02:48.960 - 00:03:24.282, Speaker B: And then it went higher. Eventually, you might have been in some short term pain, but that is not the case anymore. And the way I think about grayscale is at the start of this, they were sitting around $29 billion in assets, and the ETF approval basically unlocked $29 billion of supply. Now, a lot of that is hedged, et cetera. But at its core, this was the largest supply event of Q one. It wasn't a demand event, not if you're thinking about it from a near term perspective. But there's a ton of supply that just got unlocked.
00:03:24.282 - 00:04:06.904, Speaker B: And so from a demand supply perspective, it looks imbalanced to me. Still here with grayscale having 25 plus billion dollars in Aum at current levels, think this is a market that has a relatively short attention span. And while bitcoin was a hot narrative around the ETF launch, that's not to say that it's going to be on people's minds or the forefront of their trading next week. You still have these huge other macro things going on. Gilt moved 20 basis points today. Stocks are off. There's a lot of exciting stuff happening, and so it's going to be tough for bitcoin to hold attention.
00:04:06.904 - 00:04:45.710, Speaker B: But to those of us that are in crypto native world, I think it might mean you see a little bit more focus on alts or other parts of the crypto ecosystem and other ways to engage and make money. But in terms of bitcoin itself, I'm not that constructive here. There are a lot of mixed views out there, but I've been basically bullish since last year, the start of last year, let alone. And right now I'm cautious at best. It's not outright bearish.
00:04:45.782 - 00:05:08.700, Speaker A: I think that's fair in the near term, but big picture. Yeah, for sure. I mean, you remain a long term bitcoin bull. Just to clarify for anyone who. I don't think anyone who listens to this show would question that. Yeah, but I mean, I agree. And I've been saying too, that I think, you know, months three to six, three to twelve matter a lot more for the ETF complex than months one to three.
00:05:08.700 - 00:05:18.356, Speaker A: Um, because as we've repeatedly hammered home, um, the primary net new market for these products is the advisors and wealth management channel.
00:05:18.420 - 00:05:18.708, Speaker B: Correct.
00:05:18.756 - 00:06:04.434, Speaker A: And as far as I can tell, none of them are turning it on yet. Many of them need to wait for a month or more just for track record, to add one to their platform. Um, so I want to also be cautious to people reading too much into early aum and volume numbers because again, pretty much the only people that can trade this right now is retail investors. And they, I mean, some have disagreed with me on this, Fred Krueger disagrees with me on the statement, but that retails had access to this for years, whether through Coinbase and River and cash app or through the trust before they converted or through equities that are linked to bitcoin. Right. They've had plenty of ways. And the real platforms that don't are the bank and broker dealer affiliated advisors, and they're not here yet.
00:06:04.434 - 00:06:18.778, Speaker A: So. Yeah, so in the absence of that net new demand, which I still view as net new, we've just got sort of like retail out here so far. Right. And a lot of inorganic flow from these issuers as well.
00:06:18.906 - 00:06:33.300, Speaker B: No, I completely agree with that. And I think the other thing to note is that this is a marginal security now, and you can get leverage on bitcoin a lot easier if you're.
00:06:33.332 - 00:06:34.516, Speaker A: Retail through the ETF.
00:06:34.580 - 00:06:52.100, Speaker B: Through the ETF. Same way you could buy other stocks on leverage and margin. It's going to really allow people to lever up if they want to in a relatively cheap way. So for plus.
00:06:52.212 - 00:06:53.740, Speaker A: So that can be constructive.
00:06:53.892 - 00:07:08.628, Speaker B: That is going to be constructive, you know, over the long run. But just right here, right now, it's tough to think that you're going to just break out to new highs in the next two months. Totally localized.
00:07:08.676 - 00:07:17.852, Speaker A: All right. You mentioned macro environment has shifted a little bit. I saw some fed speak previously. Dovish, was it Waller? Waller in particular.
00:07:17.988 - 00:08:25.314, Speaker B: Waller in particular yesterday was expected to be a little bit more dovish than usual on the dovish side of things. However, he came out with a message that basically said that rate cuts need to be more gradual and there's no need to be as aggressive as they have been in the past because of the balance dynamics in terms of growth and the employment picture. If employment was collapsing and falling off a cliff while inflation was coming down this aggressively, then you would need to cut. But this is a historically tight labor market and growth is still okay and you've got a fiscal impulse that's still fairly robust. We're talking about more tax cuts now and stuff. And so I think what he reiterated was that the cut pricing in the market was a little too aggressive and that you didn't quite go into this, but we've had a pretty dramatic easing in financial conditions over the past two, three months with stocks ripping to fresh highs and bond yields collapse, mortgage rates coming down. And so there is some kind of inflationary effect to that at some point.
00:08:25.314 - 00:08:54.074, Speaker B: And overall, the economy is still in a super healthy spot. And so I think the Fed is trying to take a bit more of a measured approach to the rate cut path and policy. And it's not only been domestic, but you had like six or seven different Fed speakers come out, ECB speakers come out last night that also reiterated similar messaging. And you had a surprise in UK data as well to the upside and God forbid bid like oil goes higher.
00:08:55.174 - 00:08:58.006, Speaker A: With the various straits and channels and canals.
00:08:58.150 - 00:09:48.440, Speaker B: We live in a post pandemic world with tons of geopolitical risk everywhere. And so to go back to zero interest rates or negative interest rates in the case of Europe is a very tough thing to swallow. And honestly, I don't think it's feasible in the world we live in right now. And so I think what basically happened is people's expectations of where terminal rates are going to be domestically and abroad have started to come up. And we've seen us fixed income sell off to about 20 basis points depending on what part of the curve you look at. You've had similar moves in Europe, in the ECB curve and in the UK curve as well. And so, yeah, I just think that the world was priced to perfection and now it's starting to acknowledge the two sided risks to inflation.
00:09:48.552 - 00:09:51.216, Speaker A: Markets are still pricing some cuts this year.
00:09:51.280 - 00:09:52.404, Speaker B: A tremendous amount.
00:09:52.864 - 00:09:58.336, Speaker A: Was that wrong? May have looked at the panel wrong, but I mean, like 160 basis points.
00:09:58.480 - 00:10:00.912, Speaker B: Yeah, 150, give or take, whatever.
00:10:00.968 - 00:10:02.920, Speaker A: Yeah, that still seems a lot. So did they.
00:10:02.952 - 00:10:10.952, Speaker B: Especially depending on the pace, though, they're going 50 at a time. That's three. Right. But if they're going 25 and 50, like that's what.
00:10:11.008 - 00:10:27.420, Speaker A: Right, so those. I don't know how to say this as a rates person, they repriced higher or the cuts reduced, came in a little bit reduced from where they. So they had been really aggressive even more than that. Now we're back a little, but still forecasting further easing this year. The market.
00:10:27.532 - 00:10:40.460, Speaker B: Correct. And that's just largely based on the fact that inflation has moved much closer to target. It's not at target, but if your mandate is full employment and inflation, because.
00:10:40.492 - 00:10:57.036, Speaker A: Just like they don't want to miss, like have inflation missed or beat to the upside, they don't want to miss to the downside and end up with deflation. So this is part of the soft landing, like trying to accelerate the rates or reduce them slowly right into their 2% narrative.
00:10:57.140 - 00:11:06.284, Speaker B: If they can, but if they can. But at the same time, it's like, we've had this discussion before. It's like absolute prices are up like 20 plus percent.
00:11:06.444 - 00:11:07.548, Speaker A: Yeah, those aren't coming back.
00:11:07.636 - 00:11:38.802, Speaker B: That's just not coming back. And they're still focused on this rate of growth or rate of change of prices. And so that's kind of a debate. But overall, the kind of things I'm monitoring are like, savings balances are starting to come off. Like the excess balances from the pandemic have started to get eaten into. You've seen a pickup in credit card default rates and stuff and a lot of the soft data indicators.
00:11:38.898 - 00:11:56.462, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw somebody saying that online. I don't want to say the platforms, but the big online ad sellers, so the big tech companies, the search engine giants that do this are laying off huge swaths of their ad teams and that this has also historically been a leading indicator of a downturn in the economy. Ad spending.
00:11:56.598 - 00:12:14.622, Speaker B: No, no ads. Lots of things like that that are saying you're headed towards a slowdown. And so basically the Fed's being like, rates are probably too restrictive in the context of what we're seeing in the future. Like, on a forward indicator basis, slow down.
00:12:14.678 - 00:12:15.622, Speaker A: Yes, yes.
00:12:15.758 - 00:12:24.622, Speaker B: And it's like, I agree with them. Like, the rates are probably too high by like 100, 150 basis points. But at the same time, like, well.
00:12:24.638 - 00:12:30.390, Speaker A: There'S no sense in overcutting too soon. You can always cut more. That's what's great about having brought it up this high. Exactly.
00:12:30.422 - 00:12:33.150, Speaker B: You could cut these points tomorrow if they need to. If they need to.
00:12:33.182 - 00:12:35.630, Speaker A: So start a little lower and slower.
00:12:35.702 - 00:12:56.592, Speaker B: It's like you have, you don't have like, the world blowing up. Right. Yeah. And, you know, it's also, I mean, the big thing, though, is like, they're gonna, the fiscal issues, you're gonna hit them at some point. The math is just going to catch up with it. And I'm, I mean, that, that's, and then that's really when I think, you know, bitcoin gets one of the most.
00:12:56.648 - 00:13:32.864, Speaker A: Positive things to come out of the high rate environment in my mind is the, finally some awareness, some true awareness renewed, much more serious discussion, not just from, like, gold, you know, gold bugs and long term, you know, everyday people about the cost of the national debt and the fiscal spending on, on this and high rates, of course, increased service costs of the debt. And so it's raised, it's made people really realize, like, wait a second, we're gonna be spending 15, 2030 50% under some future of our entire budget, just servicing the debt. Right. It's like you pay your mortgage every month and you don't even take anything off the principal. Yeah.
00:13:32.904 - 00:14:09.312, Speaker B: I mean, if our only voters were, like, between the ages of, like, 15 and like, 30, the world would look totally different. And, like, the care about the fiscal stuff, like, you couldn't kick the can down the road. Cause you're kicking it to these two to yourself. And that's like, why? I mean, I'm just like, like, as a, you know, I'm not young anymore. I'm almost 30, but, like, I'm, like, thinking about, like, 15 years from now, 30 years from now. The fiscal picture is just abhorrent. And I think at some point, like, the market is going to force the government's hand with this stuff.
00:14:09.312 - 00:14:51.040, Speaker B: And bitcoin is kind of one of those barometers on the barometers, because ultimately it comes down to, like, is the dollar, the reserve currency? Is there another alternative to it? Like, will markets really push on that? If people are like, I'm not buying 30 year debt anymore. The central bank is going to have to buy it all. I'm not touching it because they're not going to pay it, then that'd be a moment of reckoning, and that's when you'd expect bitcoin to go up. And also they're going to start expanding the balance sheet pretty soon with the end of QT and then eventual resumption of QE. And that's going to be a pretty huge upside catalyst for bitcoin, but it's just going to take time.
00:14:51.072 - 00:14:56.284, Speaker A: Yeah. Change in that still looks bad. The long term fiscal and debt servicing picture.
00:14:56.624 - 00:14:57.056, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:57.120 - 00:14:59.784, Speaker A: Still constructive there. That's part of bitcoin long term value proposition.
00:14:59.824 - 00:15:05.040, Speaker B: If the market was only focused on trading, that bitcoin would be at the moon.
00:15:05.112 - 00:15:05.344, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:05.384 - 00:15:07.752, Speaker B: Like, I don't even know what value it would have.
00:15:07.808 - 00:15:13.324, Speaker A: Yep. Like any Bim netabeebee from Galaxy trading, my friend. As always, thank you for coming on, Galaxy brains.
