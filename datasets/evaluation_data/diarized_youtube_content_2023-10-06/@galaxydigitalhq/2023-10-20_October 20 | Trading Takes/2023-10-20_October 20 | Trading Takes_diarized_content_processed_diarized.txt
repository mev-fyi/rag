00:00:08.240 - 00:00:13.150, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, my friend Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:13.262 - 00:00:14.382, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:14.518 - 00:00:29.154, Speaker A: Yeah, what an exciting week it's been so far. It feels like ETF speculation and consideration is really picking up after that headline that turned out to be inaccurate was published on Monday morning. What did you see on Monday?
00:00:29.534 - 00:01:39.038, Speaker B: We saw a tremendous amount of short covering in spot and in options form. We saw renewed interest, renewed attention to the bitcoin ETF and the timeline around that. Since then, we've seen healthy follow through in the price action of bitcoin. So far, you've turned the 200 day moving average, which was resistance, into support. Now, and generally speaking, bitcoin has been trading much better than the rest of the crypto complex. So it's led to a bitcoin relative outperformance and just an outright sort of continuation of the uptrend that you've had since hitting a low of. So, broadly speaking, I think folks that were short any convexity panicked and they quickly covered that convexity via spot and via options, and it really kind of showed how under positioned the market was for an actual ETF announcement.
00:01:39.038 - 00:02:02.646, Speaker B: And so I think, broadly speaking, these developments were constructive. The price action that you've seen after has been healthy, and it's now going to be at the forefront of people's minds that we might have an ETF that gets approved before year end or in and around year end. And so you don't want to be caught with your pants down in an asset that can literally moon.
00:02:02.750 - 00:02:37.166, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. It was an exciting and obviously strange thing that happened just for our listeners. If you didn't see, although I'm sure almost everyone did, Cointelegraph had apparently erroneously, certainly erroneously, we know now, but didn't right away posted that BlackRock's bitcoin ETF spot application had been approved by the SEC. That was false. It has not. None have been approved. I think prudent for market observers to rely on official communications from the SEC and others, maybe issuers or something to find out when that happens.
00:02:37.166 - 00:03:07.574, Speaker A: But what are we watching? I know you and I have been following the amended s one filings. We've seen fidelity, Invesco, Galaxy, and Ark have all refiled their s one applications with amendments. And those, I would say the updates have been relatively benign. Right. Sort of expanding disclosure sections and stuff. What are we watching for? Obviously, we're watching for others to refile. But what does that tell you? The sort of character of those amendments.
00:03:07.574 - 00:03:09.730, Speaker A: When you think about what I think.
00:03:09.802 - 00:04:00.884, Speaker B: You'Re totally spot on that the character of those amendments is completely benign. Right. They're not like huge fundamental changes to the filing. It's more like there's some risks around this stuff and it's like the proper disclosures. And so I think what we're getting at and what we're looking for is just language that's becoming more consistent amongst the filers. As this process develops, the closer you are to just consistent language across all of the filers, the closer you're going to be to actually getting an ETF approval. And then most importantly, I'm watching the Jan ten date for the Arc ETF, which I don't think that there's right now a feasible path for the SEC denying that filing.
00:04:00.884 - 00:05:04.094, Speaker B: And so I'm kind of viewing that as kind of the last, uh, kind of stick in the sand or whatever proverb you want to use. Uh, and so, you know, that's, that's kind of, you know, what, what I'm watching for, um, in addition, it's just, you know, the one thing I, you know, folks need to keep in mind is that the last time, you know, bitcoin traded at new all time highs, it was around hype for an ETF. Because folks did believe that an ETF product would make, you know, that this asset class really go off to the next level. And I've said this before, the two things you have to keep in mind with ETF is that the US capital market is the largest and best capital market on the planet. ETF has proven to be one of the best financial innovations ever in history for wealth creation. You are combining those two things with a bitcoin ETF product. And as the price action recently suggested, it's going to be unequivocally bullish.
00:05:04.094 - 00:06:13.256, Speaker B: The amount of supply that's available in the market in terms of just liquidity for buyers versus the liquidity that's going to be brought on by an ETF. I think there's a complete mismatch. I think as time goes on, the market will continue to price in that probability of an ETF approval much, much, much higher. And therefore, I do think you're going to be in one of those situations where not necessarily buy the rumors, sell the news, but you are going to have a rally in crypto prices going into the ETF. Now, are there some potential negative catalysts between now and then? Government selling, potential finance action? Yes, but I do think those are going to be dips that get bought and ultimately, I don't see a world where you're in mid November and we haven't gotten, we have a bunch of new s one filings and it's getting closer and you're not approaching trend highs for the year. So I'm constructive on bitcoin just specifically because of this catalyst, but also because of the macro backdrop as well.
00:06:13.400 - 00:06:48.276, Speaker A: Let's talk about that real quick because in sort of response to the fake news for Monday, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink characterized on Fox Business crypto, which he later said he's not allowed to say bitcoin because of their filing. I don't know what advice he's getting, but that crypto, he said, could be part of a flight to safety along with things like gold and the dollar, given the macro geopolitical and macro environment. Like let's think about that and how that fits in, in your mind.
00:06:48.400 - 00:08:33.292, Speaker B: So I mean, this is a, you know, a brutal take, but let's just say that, you know, bitcoin's magic Internet money or just some random asset, right? And it's not, you know, something that has a long history, but it's some, it's just a random asset that the BlackRock CEO is talking about, right. If he characterizes it as something that's going to be a flight to quality, and he's one of the more influential macros folks on the planet because he runs a $10 trillion asset management firm, I'm going to be interested in buying that for the reasons he specifically said, whether it's in crypto, in bonds, et cetera, particularly in just allocating towards assets or narratives. When he puts a narrative that this is now a flight to quality asset, a gold asset, a safe haven asset, I am going to take him at his word because that is the messaging that the world's largest asset managers is going to go out with. I think it's incredibly bullish in the sense that it will help shape the narrative and the conversation around bitcoin in a way that's much more direct as in he's the guy that goes into investment committees that can go turn a board that's one or two people away from investing in an asset. He can go to these sovereign wealth funds and be like, why haven't you allocated yet? If he can do that and the price is appreciating, folks are literally going to look like not idiots, but they're going to look unprepared and, or just not having done the proper work if.
00:08:33.308 - 00:08:34.546, Speaker A: They don't consider it.
00:08:34.700 - 00:09:28.578, Speaker B: If you don't consider it, at the very least, you're not doing your fiduciary duty. Maybe that's a little bit strong. But fundamentally, technically speaking, if you just think about bitcoin as a series of price returns, we know that over time in a portfolio with a small allocation, it has added to performance, it has delivered outsized market returns. In addition, it has diversified returns. A case, it's improved the risk and the reward profile of your investment portfolio. And so for somebody that's just looking at their portfolio in the context of portfolio construction, you have to seriously consider this because it helps your returns and it reduces your risk. How on earth are you not thinking about that, especially when the CEO of the world's largest asset manager is giving you a product, that this is the narrative around it.
00:09:28.626 - 00:09:58.314, Speaker A: Yeah, we just put out a report about two weeks ago called bitcoin in a portfolio that goes into some of that historical impact on portfolios that bitcoin has had. Let's shift gears briefly, bim net, and talk about the broader macro environment. I saw that two year yields were making new highs, trend highs earlier this week. So yeah, today. So people still don't, they're still selling those bonds. What does that tell you?
00:09:58.394 - 00:10:28.846, Speaker B: Well, it tells you that the data has been hotter than most, most market participants had expected. And so what you recently had is a string of really hot, hard data going back to a couple weeks ago. You had over 300,000 jobs printed in non farm payrolls. So strong labor market CPI was really strong. It surprised higher, 0.4 month on month. And the components that you cared about most also came in the hottest ownership equivalent, rent and supercore, which is a gauge of services inflation, all surprised higher.
00:10:28.846 - 00:11:03.858, Speaker B: And then you had retail sales, which is a good indicator of the US consumer consumption is like 70% of the US economy. Also surprised higher, meaningfully. So you're talking about like a 0.7 month on month increase in retail sales and August numbers were revised higher. So the critical parts of the economy and the critical points of hard data that the market looks at have all surprised higher. And therefore you have seen a repricing of interest rates to go along with that. And you're now seeing, as we speak, thirties are sitting at over 5%.
00:11:03.858 - 00:11:32.866, Speaker B: Now. Two year yields are at five and a quarter. Tens look like they want to go to 5%. And this is in a world where we have a potential geopolitical conflict that involves billions of people potentially. And so I think it's quite telling. In addition, none of the supply stuff has improved Biden's trying to do another $100 billion aid package. What does that mean? That's debt that has to get financed, that's more interest payments, et cetera.
00:11:32.866 - 00:12:25.078, Speaker B: That just puts things out of whack. And so there's nothing really tackling the supply issue in the market. And the Fed, even though they've recently tried to talk down expectations of a hike, again in the front end, they can't ignore hard data like this. I understand that monetary policy works with a lag and we're seeing cracks. But when the main thing you're targeting is not going your way and it's still surprising higher, you kind of have to question, am I right in my policy? And so that's kind of the juncture we find ourselves in, which is a lot of hot data and a fed that doesn't necessarily want to move the front end for it and a market that is taking that as a sign that it can sell the back end, particularly in the context of supply and dollars have gone, are now super bid as a function of us rates backing up again.
00:12:25.166 - 00:12:31.574, Speaker A: Wild. Well, it continues to be a tricky and interesting market. My friend Bim at Abibi from Galaxy trading, thank you so much.
