00:00:00.250 - 00:00:30.002, Speaker A: I think the world is becoming much more normal, and therefore, monetary policy needs to be much more normal. And we're about 300 basis points away from normal right now. Yeah. And I think reinflation risk is a little overhyped. And I think some people lean on commodities and stuff. But like you look at China, they're having a GFC type of event in their markets right now. And oil, oil, even with all this stuff in the Red Sea, is barely reacting.
00:00:30.002 - 00:00:52.460, Speaker A: Right. And so I think you're at a point where the commodity complex is healthy, I think, in terms of not that much upside risks, and the global economy is slowing. That's why other central banks are cutting. You had surprises in UK CPI. You've had ecbs expected to cut in April. It's all going that way. And the Fed, I think, is a little behind the curve at this point.
