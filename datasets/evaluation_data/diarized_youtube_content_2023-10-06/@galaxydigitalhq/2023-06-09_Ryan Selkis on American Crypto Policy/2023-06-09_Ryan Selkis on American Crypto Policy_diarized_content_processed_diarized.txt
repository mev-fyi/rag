Catch me down on Wall street and Ferragamo kicks hit and drop shots haters better run quick, y'all don't run ish, yo, the future is distributed and if you talk slick, yo, you get the dropkick, see me clap back cop coin on cash app and a bitcoin snapback ain't nothing to laugh at so line up, yo, we're steppin on the court and your time's up we ain't playin for sport here on Galaxy brains. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital. Thank you for listening to Galaxy Brains. We have a great show. Ryan Selkus, CEO, founder of Massari, and now chairman and founder of the Digital Freedom alliance. He is our guest.
00:01:08.718 - 00:01:43.994, Speaker A: Great conversation with Ryan about the current and future state of crypto policy and regulation in the United States. We have a lot that we cover in that conversation. I know you'll like it. And of course, we'll check in with our good friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading, as always, to talk markets and macro. But before we get to all of that, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to the disclaimer in the podcast notes. And note that none of the information contained in this podcast represents an offer, recommendation, solicitation, or investment advice from Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Man, this is a big week, and this is a big episode, so let's hop right into it.
00:01:43.994 - 00:01:49.134, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, welcome to the show, Bim.
00:01:49.214 - 00:01:50.430, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:01:50.582 - 00:02:02.964, Speaker A: So, obviously, the big stories of this week has been the regulatory actions, the civil suits brought by the SEC against Coinbase and Binance. So let's just start right there. Any impact on markets?
00:02:03.624 - 00:02:23.168, Speaker B: Bitcoin is currently trading at 26,610. It was trading basically 27,000 before the announcement came out. While I think there are very meaningful implications for the broader industry, of course, for bitcoin in particular. I don't think there was any implications.
00:02:23.256 - 00:02:24.336, Speaker A: Yeah, down a tiny bit.
00:02:24.360 - 00:02:44.846, Speaker B: Right, down a tiny bit. You know, these cases ultimately don't really impact, you know, things that are commodities, specifically commodities. And so bitcoin trades well, anecdotally. Most of the, you know, folks we talk to, you know, they were really impressed by the fact that bitcoin held up so well.
00:02:44.910 - 00:02:45.246, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:02:45.310 - 00:03:29.204, Speaker B: And like the macro types we talk through, there's generally like a sort of an apathetic sort of kind of view about it. Most folks have a bag. They've properly sized it in their portfolio, given, you know, the volatility, and then nobody's scrambling to add more, but nobody's trying to sell either. And so that's why bitcoin has just hovered where it's been hovering for the past several months. And so I think it's quite healthy to see a very resilient asset like this. It's still up more than 50% on the year, still one of the best performing asset classes. It's liquid, it's legal.
00:03:29.204 - 00:04:15.798, Speaker B: And so there's a lot of positive cross currents for bitcoin. In addition, you've definitely seen some selling of alts, particularly those named in the suits. And generally speaking, when you have a risk off move in crypto, folks sell alts and rotate into bitcoin when folks are worried about balances on exchange or et cetera. Again, it's bitcoin into cold storage. And so bitcoin definitely benefits from a flight to quality phenomenon in crypto on a relative basis. And so I think that partially explains some of the resilience behind it. In addition, it's really a market that trades at Max Payne right now.
00:04:15.798 - 00:04:58.524, Speaker B: And so folks that short at bad levels, nine times out of ten will get squeezed. And that might have to do with how the market makers operate or whatever, but it is a market that does trade to Max Payne. In addition, you just think about this asset over Memorial Day weekend. You basically went up to 28,500 from similar levels to now for no real reason. It was just a short squeeze. And so I think this is an asset class that's probably likely going to remain relatively range bound. Basically, everything has been thrown at bitcoin, collapses of three arrows, FTX.
00:04:58.524 - 00:05:51.974, Speaker B: Now you got the regulatory stuff, the regulatory stuff, the cases, 500 plus basis points of hiking domestically, and all tight financial conditions everywhere around the globe, et cetera. And this thing is still holding up really well. And I think, taking a step back, I think that bodes well for the long run. Future of this asset and the asset class in general, the fact that it's holding up so well in the context of the world's most important government and regulatory agency kind of clamping down on things. And so I'm optimistic. In addition, I do think that the macro will eventually start to be supportive of things like bitcoin and precious metals and hedges against monetary debasement. To be honest, I thought the biggest news over the past month was the fact that we raised the debt ceiling indefinitely.
00:05:51.974 - 00:06:28.042, Speaker B: Well, to a specific time, but no cap in theory. And we are going to spend money recklessly without abandon for the next couple of years. And so is every other g ten economy. And, yeah, I mean, the monetary argument becomes apparent every day. It's like one of those things where it's like, wait, our debt goes up every day, and it's like, we got to pay interest on it. And your ability to pay back, that reduces every single day. Every day, bitcoin's around more credible, more participants, more adoption.
00:06:28.042 - 00:06:55.554, Speaker B: And so it's one of those things that you just, you know, just need to give it time. And, yeah, I mean, I wish I could fast forward four years and, you know, tell you where bitcoin's gonna be, but I feel pretty confident in saying that, you know, it'll be around. There'll be tons of folks transacting in it in novel ways, potentially, you know, ordinals, whatever it may be. But the monetary argument is only gonna have gotten much, much stronger in four years time. I can tell you that for sure.
00:06:56.414 - 00:07:23.326, Speaker A: That was great. Love the overview, Bim. And I totally agree. Let me. Let me just shift gears one little question here, though. It's not a little question, but before we wrap, because sort of in our long line of periodic things that I've asked Bim net Abibi about, as I'm learning macro myself, one was that I saw Balaji Srinivasan, who is the former CTO at Coinbase separately, and an entrepreneur. And he's also the guy.
00:07:23.326 - 00:07:27.662, Speaker A: Right? He had the $1 million call price call, which, of course, didn't happen for.
00:07:27.678 - 00:07:29.854, Speaker B: Bitcoin, or he doesn't know how to price options.
00:07:29.934 - 00:08:10.484, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. But he tweeted a chart that I believe that what the chart said was, was that it has been 14 consecutive months in a row where non farm payrolls have come in, have beaten expectations, or not beaten to have beaten expectations. And that's, like, by far the longest streak ever, and essentially was suggesting that the BLS data is raw, fake, or manipulated. People have said that in the past. I found a tweet from 2011 where Jack Welch, the former CEO of General Motors or GE, whichever, the owner of GM or whatever, Jack Welch, famous corporate guy, he said the same thing about the BLS data back then. Is that possible?
00:08:12.624 - 00:08:39.522, Speaker B: I will say one more and more serious folks that have looked at this data for decades are highlighting that there's some abnormalities. For sure. There are some things that stick out. And 14 months of consecutive upward beats is very surprising. However, it's not in the context of what we know about the labor market. It is really hot.
00:08:39.578 - 00:08:43.042, Speaker A: Right? So the broad trend is like, you disagree with that?
00:08:43.058 - 00:09:36.122, Speaker B: It's accurate. And so one, I'd like to stress that non farm payrolls is one piece of data, right? There are tons of other data pieces to properly contextualize the US labor market. The ADP payroll data, that is a private data series produced by one of the largest payroll processing companies, still supports these massive job gains. They're saying they're adding hundreds of thousands of jobs as well. And sort of like the employment components of pmis and all of these surveys, you know, NFIB data, et cetera. And you can see it in high frequency data, too, like MTA travel and like, you know, in Memorial Day, you had more planes in the sky than ever. Yeah, right.
00:09:36.122 - 00:09:44.626, Speaker B: And so there are ways to properly contextualize the data. With that being said, this data smells funky for sure.
00:09:44.690 - 00:09:50.314, Speaker A: Something wrong with that PlS data and what it's directionally telling you the same thing all the other trustworthy data is saying to your.
00:09:50.354 - 00:10:41.638, Speaker B: Yeah, fair enough. The other, the weird part about this, though, is like, for the past two months, had a very high adjustment in this thing known as like, death birth component, which is like, I believe estimates like, how many net new jobs were created as a function of a business starting versus a business going out of business. And so there are weird things like that in the data that have thrown it off for the past couple of months. And so, yeah, like, I'm like looking at it with a grain of salt. And I think a lot of serious people are looking at it with a grain of salt. However, it's just important to stress that it's not our only measure and realistically, it's not even. It's not the main priority for the central bank right now.
00:10:41.686 - 00:10:42.134, Speaker A: Right.
00:10:42.254 - 00:11:13.504, Speaker B: The central priority is inflation, getting inflation down. And on Tuesday, you've got core CPI that's expected to print at 0.4 month on month. You've had the Royal bank, the RBA, the Bank of Canada surprise hike over the past week. Right. Because inflation's been too high and data's been too strong in general. And so you're dealing with a Fed that has really no choice but to keep going until prices come down.
00:11:13.504 - 00:12:04.324, Speaker B: However, I do think that the committee is as split as they've ever been in this hiking cycle. There are more divergent opinions. In addition, I do think that there are pockets of weak data that are now starting to sort of materialize. In addition, I think the supply outlook for Treasuries is going to be a much more important factor, especially over the next three to four months as the Treasury's general account builds. But high level, we're going to need to fund a lot of us debt, and that money has to come from somewhere. It's either RRP or bank reserves, and most likely going to, a lot of it's going to come from bank reserves. A decent amount will come from RRP, but that's going to be a liquidity drain on the market.
00:12:04.324 - 00:12:50.484, Speaker B: There's going to have to be a lot of treasury supply that gets absorbed by the market, and you're going to take reserves down in the broader market to very tight levels, and eventually that's going to catch up to the Fed. And I think they're thinking about it now as to when they might have to ultimately stop doing QT and not necessarily do QE, but at least stop the tightening, stop the tightening, et cetera, when they'll have a serious issue with banks and they'll have to try to re steepen the yield curve, et cetera. And so the Fed's got visibility into that. However, the data, especially the price data, has just been so strong recently that it's just, it's tough to even want. People are going to go out and.
00:12:50.524 - 00:12:57.028, Speaker A: Spend money over the summer, too, right? People want to get outside and spend money, go to baseball games and whatnot, buy hot dogs, whatever americans do, right?
00:12:57.076 - 00:13:05.868, Speaker B: You know, I hate hot dogs, and I think baseball is boring. But you prefer to spend some money this summer. Yeah, I'm ready. I'm ready to hit the beach.
00:13:05.956 - 00:13:09.988, Speaker A: Yeah, let's. Hey, Bimnet, a BB from galaxy trading. My friend, as always, always great to see you.
00:13:10.036 - 00:13:10.744, Speaker B: Pleasure.
00:13:11.204 - 00:13:21.364, Speaker A: Let's go to our guest, Ryan Selkus, CEO, founder of Massari, one of the oldest and biggest data and research companies in crypto. Ryan, thank you so much for joining Galaxy brains.
00:13:21.524 - 00:13:24.024, Speaker C: Thank you. And thank you for the wrap intro.
00:13:25.284 - 00:13:56.412, Speaker A: That's a banger. So been wanting to talk to you, Ryan, for a while. I followed, and we've known each other for a fair amount of time, but things have really gotten interesting. You've become very vocal on regulation, sort of as the regulatory screws have been being tightened by various agencies and stuff over the last year or so in particular, we're going to get into all of that. Along those lines, though, you just announced this week the launch of a new nonprofit, the Digital Freedom alliance. You are founder and chairman of this, of the DFA. Tell us what that is.
00:13:56.548 - 00:15:03.764, Speaker C: In short, it's a grassroots advocacy group to basically work on messaging activation and narrative development for the industry. We really lack a pr or marketing apparatus for the space, and one of the reasons is a decentralized community. It's tough to have a single standard bearer of single narrative, but there are some common threads that I think the entire community holds as core values that we really just do a poor job of communicating, particularly to DC. So we're really focused on resetting the narrative in DC, on crypto, what it's used for, what its potential is, combating just bad faith attacks on the industry and its good faith proponents and builders, and taking a data and research driven approach to what it's going to take to pass positive legislation, common sense legislation that allows the industry to thrive with some consumer protections and structure rules in place. But that just gets us out of this regulatory morass where one unelected bureaucrat is able to steamroll an entire movement.
00:15:04.354 - 00:15:21.506, Speaker A: Yeah, it's definitely a morass. I think that's the right word for it, that word. I don't know if this comes from. It really sounds like molasses to me. And there's an onomatopoeia aspect to it where it is, it's a slog, it's a sticky sludge where we're stuck. So I don't know. That's just an aside.
00:15:21.506 - 00:16:05.144, Speaker A: So Ryan, for our audience, may not know. One of the things Ryan's been thinking a lot about market structure and things like exchanges for a long time. One of the things Ryan was known for early was sort of blowing the whisk solar, sounding the alarm on Mount Gox, I guess almost ten years. Was it ten years ago at this point? Probably. Is there a line from there to here? Like, is that how long you've been thinking about these issues? Cause I also know one of Masari's early goals was also around disclosures. And, you know, so tell us, like, your story and how it gets you from even Gox to now. Like, is this all part of the same thing? You've been trying to build in crypto.
00:16:05.644 - 00:17:34.606, Speaker C: I think the through line is that I have a very low tolerance for bullshit, and I've called balls and strikes for a long time and haven't always been popular at the time that I've called them within different communities. But I think one of the reasons I've been around for so long and still have more than a few friends in the space is because people always know where I stand at any given time. And it's almost always on the line of what is good for the long term, of crypto is good for the long term, for society and for the country. In the case of the US and the fight that we're taking on now, I think with Mount Gox, there was a bunch of folks that realized that the exchange was in trouble even months before it actually went under and before there was this infamous bankruptcy document that I got my hands on. But at the time, Malcox was trying to keep things under the radar and kind of, kind of sweep this under the rug, and they had this whole crisis strategy plan for essentially obfuscating the fact that they were insolvent to their end users and slow playing kind of the communications plan for how they were going to restart the exchange. And there's a bunch of early investors, early insiders that didn't really know what to do with this information because they were either under NDA or they were afraid that if they blew the whistle, that they were going to get employer embroiled in some litigation or, you know, have, have something to blow back on them. And I was a couple months into the quote unquote industry at that point.
00:17:34.606 - 00:17:39.142, Speaker C: It was just bitcoin. It was, you know, like hundreds or thousands of us at the time.
00:17:39.238 - 00:17:40.198, Speaker A: There were dozens of us.
00:17:40.286 - 00:18:36.774, Speaker C: Yeah, dozens. Dozens, yeah. And, you know, you'll kind of see this as the through line, but that was kind of the first emperor has no clothes moment where in many cases, I'm the only one dumb enough. Fine line between being dumb and brave, I guess, but dumb enough to basically blow the whistle and say, this exchange, it's a massive part of the market infrastructure, is insolvent to the tune of 700, 800,000 bitcoin, whatever it was at the time. That at the time was catastrophic. And that's happened at numerous times over the years. Whether it's talking about ICOs, whether it's talking about the dynamics of ripple and XRP and how they released that currency over time, whether it was talking about the early ICO movements and some of the excesses there and then in the other direction on the regulatory state.
00:18:36.774 - 00:19:51.154, Speaker C: It's not just a partisan issue. I was very vocal about the Trump administration, in particular what Steve Mnuchin was trying to do at the 11th hour before the, the Trump administration was out of office in January of 2021 in cracking down on private transactions and really having some of these owners potential restrictions on payments. And then, of course, over the summer of 2021, with the infrastructure bill's passage. That's when I think I and a lot of others spoke up to just how badly we were going to get slapped around under this administration. I usually look crazy at the time, talking about a lot of things, but I just, my mind is built different, and I guess I don't have the same wiring for self preservation as many others do. But when I tend to see something that is hiding in plain sight and is just so obvious, but people are afraid to call it what it is or tell the truth, that's traditionally been, you know, the type of controversial situations that I find myself in, where they're called controversial, but it's really just one person seeing a plain truth and saying, this is bullshit. The more people need to start saying that this is so.
00:19:51.154 - 00:20:53.308, Speaker C: And then more often than not, I've been on the right side of that snowball. So I view this as just the latest incarnation, what we're doing with Digital Freedom alliance. I've been banging the drum on the regulatory excesses, the bad faith of this administration in particular, for two years, and only more recently have people, whether you're a hardcore progressive conservative, or anywhere in between, said, we have to be fighting this ruthlessly at this point, because this is about, it's an existential level crisis for the industry in the US. So we'll see if it's too little, too late. But I'm obviously very optimistic because I've just spent a lot of time, more than I wanted to in DC the last couple of years for sure. But I don't feel like we're non participating characters right now. I think that there is a needle that we can thread to get good legislative outcomes to curb the excesses and really marginalize people like Gary Gensler and the other out of control regulators.
00:20:53.308 - 00:22:32.082, Speaker C: And then come 2024 election and 2025, we could find ourselves in a situation as an industry where we have clear guidance on how do stable coins get regulated, how are banking relationships insured and preserved between crypto and non crypto companies, how are crypto exchanges and custodians and these kind of market structure, critical market structure players regulated and how are consumers protected? And how do we kind of abide by the spirit of all these existing financial laws that we have on the books? Then, definitionally, how do we actually think about how to bring decentralized networks and protocols to market and allow creators and some of these upstart use cases to thrive? I've been called a tragic optimist by my friends or a realistic pessimist or whatever framing you want. But I do think there's. There is so much potential for crypto, and if folks are just courageous enough, I think, to just be clear eyed about the good, bad and ugly of where we are right now and just really fucking focus on the task at hand for the next 18 months, I think that we'll come out the other side stronger. But it's success is not foregone conclusion. It's certainly not a straight line. It never has been in crypto, but it's also not a foregone conclusion. I think about the next 18 months as the battle for the US, after which point we're either going to have a really vibrant ecosystem or it's going to be time to move abroad.
00:22:32.218 - 00:22:54.380, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. When you look at the other, it's not just niche countries that are taking progressive frameworks to the next level in crypto. It's the European Union, it's the United Kingdom, it's Brazil, it's Hong Kong, even to an extent now. Right. And then you have China. There was that.
00:22:54.380 - 00:23:34.004, Speaker A: It was like a science and technology wing of some part of the apparatus, put out that web3 paper like last week or whatever, which was I'm told by China watchers much smarter than I, that it is notable that it was allowed. It may not mean that it's their new policy, but that it wouldn't have even been allowed to have been published maybe a year ago. So we are at, and I think it's very clear we can, as a country, say and do whatever we want with crypto. But that isn't going to change the fact that around the world, many, many jurisdictions are treating it like and building for it like it's the future of finance.
00:23:34.504 - 00:24:28.238, Speaker C: I mean, that's right. I mean, I think there is a. There is a contingent within this administration and the financial regulators in particular, that, you know, they're so certain of their position and the US's position that they're scoffing at the idea that some of this innovation could move abroad or that it would even be a negative thing if it did move abroad. Right. I think that the false certainty that some of the financial regulators have that the US is the dominant financial market, has the reserve currency, is the leader in tech, that it will always be so. And I think historically that's been a very dangerous line of thinking for any incumbent when you're talking about transformative technology. And I don't think that crypto is going to be any different.
00:24:28.238 - 00:25:12.120, Speaker C: I don't think AI is going to be any different. So we have to have smarter regulators and more competent regulators than we do, and we have to have more engaged lawmakers than we currently have when it comes to crypto. I think there are positive steps in that direction on the legislative side, but we're in an all out trench war right now against one out of control bureaucrat in particular, arguably two, if you count the FDIC chair as well. But that's just going to be the ground reality for the next 612, 18 months, especially until we see some court rulings in some of these big cases like ripples and grayscales.
00:25:12.192 - 00:25:51.834, Speaker A: Yeah, let's talk about. Let's talk a few specifics. Let's talk about some of these cases. Obviously, this week we had lawsuits filed against finance and Coinbase by the SEC. I would say, just on my first look, very, very different lawsuits. Right? I mean, for example, CZ is a name defendant, and name mentioned by name maybe 190 times in the binance suit, which also, in addition to lack of registration allegations, contains allegations of fraud and misappropriation and commingling. The Coinbase suit, Brian Armstrong is not named, and he's only mentioned once in the entire suit.
00:25:51.834 - 00:26:21.094, Speaker A: Of course, it's just as the CEO of Coinbase and it's solely about lack of registration. So it is a much different tone and vibe. But I think the Coinbase one is much more important, long run for the industry in the US. I don't know, dropping these back to back days, like, I mean, is this. And this is going to have to get resolved in court. I don't really expect either firm to really settle at this point. I don't expect that.
00:26:21.094 - 00:26:33.634, Speaker A: So I don't know, how do you think these play out? That's a big question. But what's your take on both the SEC bringing both of these right at this time? How do you think this ends for those cases?
00:26:34.694 - 00:27:38.440, Speaker C: Well, I think the SEC has basically got us in a chokehold as an industry in the US right now, and we can break out of that chokehold only through the 2024 election, quite frankly, because the chilling effect that these enforcement actions are going to have on the industry and just the legal battles, one after the other, kind of the full weight of the state coming nonstop. Court cases just take time. Right. And so we are unfortunately not going to have much forward momentum unless and until there is a bill that passes both chambers of Congress and is signed by this administration. And we might not love everything that's in it, but that is like, one thing that we can work on proactively and stay engaged with as an industry, or there's a change in leadership in the White House. Right. I mean, I would like to say that there's another way, but I mean, that is the situation that we're in.
00:27:38.440 - 00:29:26.014, Speaker C: And so folks in the industry that are in any position of leadership, whether you're on the investing side, the market structure side, if you're a defi developer, a protocol developer, asset issuer, you really have no option but to engage in the McHenry Thompson bill that dropped last Friday, that draft bill, and see if we can work out common sense language that hits all of the notes that need to be hit from a policy making standpoint. So you have adequate consumer protections, you close certain loopholes that might allow people to skirt around us securities law. You create clear definitions for what does decentralization mean in practice? How are these systems governed? What are the rules for folks in the US or participating in these ecosystems that either gets done well in the drafts, tightens up, and we make some forward progress there, or everybody is just in a trench until 2024. And then at that point, it depends on who wins the White House. But I would say depending on who wins the White House and what that administration looks like, you're talking about crypto existing in the US or crypto not existing in the US outside of maybe bitcoin, unfortunately, I truly think those are the stakes right now, and that's not to deliver an anti biden White House message. I personally don't think that he is actually going to run for reelection at this point. The question is, like, what happens in the chaos of Biden and Trump? Are the front runners right now, but no one thinks that they're going to be the two nominees.
00:29:26.014 - 00:29:40.014, Speaker C: And so I think all the more reason for us to change sentiment and try to educate as many potential allies, as many potential contenders for the presidency on what we're actually doing and why it matters.
00:29:41.064 - 00:30:15.530, Speaker A: Brian, you mentioned bitcoin. You think outside of bitcoin, we think that there's nothing really in these suits, for example, that touches bitcoin. It's the only one that Chair Gensler will publicly say is not a security, despite the fact that the CFTC has listed ether futures as well. But the only one that Chair Gensler will say is not securities, bitcoin. What do you say to bitcoiners online, for example, who say, why should we care about this? Bitcoin is going to be safe? Like, aren't they only coming after the altcoins? What do you say to bitcoiners who think that.
00:30:15.642 - 00:31:12.544, Speaker C: I think the bitcoiners that are celebrating these enforcement actions tend to be later in the adoption curve and lower on the IQ spectrum than folks that actually know what's going on. They're cultists, right? They're coming in and they're thinking about bitcoin in religious terms. Nick Carter had a good mini thread on Twitter yesterday, and I think he was accurate to a t. I've been full time working on general areas of infrastructure in bitcoin and crypto for ten years now. And when I go to a bitcoin conference, I'm treated like a shitcoiner. And when I go to a crypto conference that's more broad than just bitcoin. I'm treated like the resident, like bitcoin maximalist.
00:31:12.544 - 00:31:19.988, Speaker C: And that's how I know I'm doing something right. And the truth is, like, you know, most of my investments are in bitcoin and ethereum.
00:31:20.036 - 00:31:20.724, Speaker A: Right, right.
00:31:20.804 - 00:32:26.338, Speaker C: Well, we, Musari, as a company, does well when the entire asset class does well, because you don't really need a data and research platform if you're talking about one or two assets. It's really when this is an asset class and when you're building infrastructure that is Bloomberg, but built on triple entry accounting rails, these blockchains, and being able to parse them and all the information and new novel governance structures and everything associated with it, I obviously have an incentive to see the asset class do well and to see this not just become a vassal of the SEC and technology that is bastardized and made functionally just non functional, well, it's neutered. But there's also, you would essentially have to make the tech and the protocols worse. You'd have to implement software that makes them all worse from a performance standpoint, from a governance standpoint, to abide by some. That's where we just analogize them.
00:32:26.426 - 00:33:04.730, Speaker A: Yeah. Obviously, you mentioned the midnight room liking at the end of the Trump administration from Secretary Mnuchin. Right? That was the Fincen rule that was gonna, I think it was the slippery slope. It wasn't gonna ban, quote unquote unhosted wallets, but it was gonna add a bunch of privacy destroying KYC type information requirements on exchanges about them. Obviously a slippery slope from that to just straight up banning unhosted wallets. I'm also sort of of the opinion that the chair of the SEC ultimately wants to basically end self custody as well, that he thinks that it should. Like when he talks about disaggregating the functions of the crypto exchanges, right.
00:33:04.730 - 00:33:31.524, Speaker A: Such that custody and settlement and trading are separated. That's something most people like the idea of. Right. We understand why it's like that in traditional finance, and it makes a lot of sense. However, I think what a subtext that I'm starting to pick up on from this is that what he really thinks will and should happen in that world is that the cryptos enter a qualified custodian and never leave. It becomes like the DTCC. And there's a lot of problems with that.
00:33:31.524 - 00:34:07.706, Speaker A: But, you know, one of the main, sort of at the highest level, that's thinking about these purely as assets and not as instruments that actually power networks that need to actually be used. Right. Like they have to be bearer assets because they actually are. They're actual tokens in the generic sense to power the machines, right? Like you have to put them into the machine. You can't just trade a paper iou of them that. And by the way, if you do, then like you said about degrading the blockchain, what made me think of this? You basically have ended the blockchain. You've instead said, okay, let's just use a database for this thing.
00:34:07.706 - 00:34:31.068, Speaker A: And it was really telling because the other day he basically said that, he said, we don't need new money. We've got digital money. He referred to the automobile industry as like something. He had that crazy quote on CNBC. Right? So, like, he, he actually, I think, does believe that you don't need public blockchains and that he actually wants to ring fence them and neuter their assets. Right. And that's sort of what I'm hearing.
00:34:31.068 - 00:34:33.380, Speaker A: That's sort of the subtext I'm getting from him lately.
00:34:33.492 - 00:35:52.554, Speaker C: Well, I think that's because there is a wing of the progressive movement that's all about control and basically, you know, government surveillance and kind of the ability to control and watch every move that you make financially. Now, they'll argue that that's not the case, and you'll hear things like national security and illicit commerce and all that. That always gets parroted and trumpeted from Crypto's critics. We can't have these privacy preserving technologies because they might be used by bad guys, when the reality is the most dystopian future that you can imagine is a us government that has total surveillance and control over your financial holdings. And it's not a huge leap of the imagination to see how this can go sideways. If you look at what happened with the canadian truckers strike not too far north just last year, the beginning of last year, and the way that people were being cut out of their financial system and unable to access their savings for dissenting, that is in a quote unquote democracy. And the authorities looked at crypto as a threat to their ability to basically run roughshod over civil liberties.
00:35:52.554 - 00:37:05.810, Speaker C: And at a moment's notice, just cut people where it hurts the most in terms of cutting them off from their financial rails and their savings. I think we talk a lot about crypto building a parallel financial system. And the criticism on crypto historically has been the financial system works pretty well in the US and in developed economies, and it's the result of decades or even in some cases centuries of innovation. The thing that I think we don't have a great narrative around as an industry is, well, it's a parallel financial system. Just in case everything that you, leadership in western democracies are doing, just in case you completely ruin the economy, which you've been doing a pretty good job of, if you look at deficit spending, no fiscal discipline, just run away entitlement spending, at some point, it seems like everybody knows that things are going to come to a head at some point. I'm not speaking crazy thoughts here. Most of the big macro investors of the world think this right now.
00:37:05.810 - 00:38:14.512, Speaker C: So whether you call it the fourth turning or sovereign debt crisis or a currency crisis, what have you, you don't have to look too far in history to know that that is possible. Not only possible, but probable, and on a long enough timeline, inevitable. So what we're talking about when we think about a parallel financial system is a life raft, right? It's like an opt out mechanism, not to undermine the US dollar or to undermine the existing financial system, but to make sure that if things go sideways or things get really bad, there is an alternative. And right now this alternative is useful globally in markets that are already under significant stress. We've seen how prevalent crypto is in some south american countries, in some southeast asian countries. In any realm where you have high currency volatility, low trust in governments, and high potential for disruption or wealth confiscation, crypto is already useful for certain marginalized classes of people. As a financial technology in those circumstances.
00:38:14.512 - 00:40:12.910, Speaker C: And the question is, can we build robust enough infrastructure so that crypto can sustain hundreds of millions, billions of people that might face something similar in the future? I think the existing powers that be think about that. They're terrified at the thought of, could you imagine the unwashed masses actually controlling their own finances and controlling their own money without the beneficence of the federal government? It's like they're just like the folks in DC have just been rewired to just think of themselves as the ultimate saviors of middle american family. And there's no concept for how far out of touch folks in DC are versus where I think most individuals are in the country when it comes to their ability to hold, let's just say cash, right? Hold cash, hold digital cash, hold gold, hold digital gold, whatever it is. That is really the nuts and bolts of what I think we're fighting for as an industry. And then everything else is downstream of that, right? So all the infrastructure that we're trying to defend, all of the new kind of novel use cases around crypto assets not named bitcoin, that aren't trying to be money. They're just trying to be some combination of governance tokens, financial incentives and ownership tokens for some of these new platforms outside of a corporate structure that's all secondary and emerging and novel tech that with the right guardrails, could be hugely promising for many decades to come. But I come back to the core of do you have the right to own your own money? Do you have the right to own ones and zeros that are just accounting ledgers that aren't under the direct control of the US government or any governments.
00:40:12.910 - 00:41:27.054, Speaker C: And to me, that is a very black and white issue that I think leaders in DC are not comfortable saying that they hate, and many of them do. If you think about how crazy that is, that we've been able to meme into an existence a trillion dollar asset class based on ones and zeros, where the only real value behind it is distrust in the governments to do what's in the long term best interest of the economy, that's insane. You can understand why some of our leaders don't necessarily like it, but this is the area. I know I'm spending a lot of time on this one point, but I think this is the area where we have the strongest leg to stand on when we're talking about defending the industry, because I think most people would agree, you have the right to hold cash. You have the right to hold, hold and own your own assets without fear of seizures or unconstitutional surveillance from the state. And those are actually hard coded in the constitution, in the Bill of Rights. And are some of the laws that we have on our side today.
00:41:27.054 - 00:42:16.738, Speaker C: If we can hold the line there, and if that is kind of our starting point for this conversation, then I think you solve 80, 90% of the public policy problem in the US. And then we're talking about the 1020 percent, which is all the innovative emerging use cases. How can you develop safe harbors? How can you make sure that we just don't have the same fraud, abuse and shenanigans that we saw in the last couple of years on the token side of things, but at least give people the opportunity to also own their own decentralized exchange tokens, their own decentralized, like banking tokens, their own decentralized identity tokens, whatever it is, with their money being the first use case. But then all these other elements kind of following after that, once the infrastructure is a little bit more mature.
00:42:16.866 - 00:42:52.814, Speaker A: I totally agree with your point, Ryan. I think that that is the core, the first issue, right, is the self sovereign, the right to own your own money. And it does feel like the american government. This is really exposing, I think, an authoritarian bent in american governance that I guess we didn't really, it wasn't obvious that it existed until this innovation, till bitcoin was invented and released, that there actually was another way it could be done. Right, I guess, other than cash. You talk about cash as the example, right? But you can't hold your life savings in cash. I mean, that's just.
00:42:52.814 - 00:43:13.904, Speaker A: It's too bulky, it's not practical. It's really exposing, though, the sort of frankly authoritarian nature of how the financial system works in the US, right. How it can be. There are all these pressure points and screws that authorities can use to totally change your entire, the course of one's life, right?
00:43:14.684 - 00:44:08.894, Speaker C: So I think those are the, like the ability to just own your own assets, whether it's financial, your own data, your, you know, whatever I think is ground zero for all the conversations that we're having on the legal and regulatory side. And again, that is not something that we can take for granted as a given. Because if you look at Mika and what's coming out in the EU, there are likely going to be some restrictions on how much you can, self custody and what you're able to do without reporting to the government, what you're transacting around. And I think you're going to have to make that debate in every jurisdiction. But in the US at least, you have the constitution on your side and you have 250 years of history on your side with that debate. So I think when you extend further than that, the issue is different in the sense that you're not necessarily talking about constitutional issues, but you're still talking about the rule of law. Right.
00:44:08.894 - 00:44:15.434, Speaker C: No one in the industry wants to have this level of hostility with the financial regulators.
00:44:15.514 - 00:44:15.874, Speaker A: Right.
00:44:15.954 - 00:45:04.994, Speaker C: No one in crypto in their right mind wants to just pick a fight with the SEC or the CFTC or the OCC or the FDIC. No one wants to be in this position. On the flip side, there are zero Americans that are clamoring for perpetual confrontation between the government and businesses. And this endless litigation environment that we're in between crypto startups, crypto innovators and the regulators, no one is asking for it. But it's crazy to me that, and I think a couple of people have picked up on this, but we need to kind of shout into the megaphone, right? Like Matt Levine at Bloomberg, who's, I think maybe you'd agree, like the most brilliant financial writer, like, in the world.
00:45:05.074 - 00:45:06.202, Speaker A: Money stuff. He writes every day.
00:45:06.218 - 00:45:08.034, Speaker C: It's money stuff. He writes every day.
00:45:08.114 - 00:45:12.614, Speaker A: He's often been quite, quite, I think, quite intelligent on crypto and crypto policy.
00:45:12.774 - 00:45:14.134, Speaker C: He gets it at a very deep.
00:45:14.214 - 00:45:21.114, Speaker A: I've always liked everything he's written, but he, but he's good. He gets it, but he does. He writes every day. It's impressive money stuff.
00:45:21.854 - 00:45:25.582, Speaker C: He wrote an entire business week on crypto last fall that I encourage people should.
00:45:25.638 - 00:45:33.030, Speaker A: Yeah, that was his, like, yeah, it was, it was like a 60 page of everything you need to know, quote unquote. And it was, and it was very good.
00:45:33.102 - 00:45:46.234, Speaker C: It was, it was phenomenal, was plain English. But one of the things that he wrote last year was Gensler says that he wants to regulate all of crypto, and all of crypto should be under the SEC's umbrella, and his strategy for regulating them is to ban them.
00:45:47.294 - 00:45:48.034, Speaker A: So.
00:45:49.774 - 00:46:34.484, Speaker C: Yeah, we're going to have a fight, because if the financial regulators and policymakers are saying, I can't believe that the crypto industry, whatever that means, first of all, but I can't believe that the crypto industry just is so reckless and lawless and operating in this no man's land and they're comfortable with the status quo, and I can't believe that they won't just listen to the guidance that we're giving as regulators and benevolent dictators. And then you say, wait a second, well, what they're really saying is, we would like you to just stop existing. Can you please just stop existing? Can you please just stop doing everything that you're doing and then you'll be in compliance?
00:46:34.524 - 00:46:36.904, Speaker A: Then we'll be okay, then you'll be in compliance.
00:46:37.764 - 00:47:28.406, Speaker C: So that's insane, obviously. And I think we need to be better as an industry about telling that story and explaining, look, we know that these are the parameters of existing financial law, existing consumer protection law. Here's what we as an industry have been doing to try to advance that. And here are the gray areas. And here's where we'd like to work with policymakers. Whether you're talking about the legislative process or rulemaking on the regulatory side, this is where we would really like to clear definitions up, make sure that there's sensible retrofitting of existing rules, existing frameworks and parameters, and let's make sure that that wraps around crypto, understanding what the tech unlocks and some of the new edge cases that are unlocked associated with it. This is something, I truly believe this, Alex, you probably do, too.
00:47:28.406 - 00:49:25.736, Speaker C: Like, this is something where I think that if you took some rational staffers that understood the tech, that understood what we're trying to do technically, in terms of making sure that this ecosystem can exist and thrive in the US, and you took even like the most rabid, like, hardcore libertarians in the industry and some technologists that are working on these solutions at the exchanges, the crypto custodians, or the protocol builders, and you put them in a room, you'd probably be able to come up with a framework that makes sense in a matter of a month. The good news is, I think we have a draft of that now in, like, McHenry Thompson. And now it's, I think, incumbent on actual leaders in the industry to go and praise the parts that are sensible, that are fair, even if we don't love some of the restrictions, go in, encourage the process, and then try to make this as technically feasible as possible so that we are not just bitching about everything that comes our way, but actually understanding that if we want this tech to succeed, if we want crypto to not just be this marginalized community going forward, then we're going to have to actually have some of these tough conversations and figure out what are the rules of the road look like. If you're a centralized entity, if you're actually managing people's money, if you stand to benefit financially from a massive airdrop or a massive token issuance, what are the rules for those folks it's just like every other debate in the country where you'll have the 10% of hardcore progressives and authoritarians are like, no, screw these guys, let's ban it. And then you'll have, like, the 10% of, like, crypto libertarians are like, let's just build this, throw sand in the gears and then wait for the US to implode. And then, you know, and then everything will, like, kind of magic organization will.
00:49:25.760 - 00:49:28.152, Speaker A: Come and, yeah, we won't have to solve any of these problems.
00:49:28.208 - 00:50:04.542, Speaker C: And then, but then you've got 80% of folks in the middle. They're like, we just, like, flesh something out that's sensible and reasonable and, yeah, yeah. Like, we're gonna bitch about the compliance burden, we're gonna bitch about the disclosures burden and argue about whether accredited investor laws are a good thing or just completely antiquated system, which they are. But we're not going to change that rule in the US. If we can just get over that hurdle. I think we can eke out some progress the next 18 months. But the status quo isn't an option.
00:50:04.542 - 00:50:11.426, Speaker C: It's. We're going to lose oxygen soon if we don't start playing ball.
00:50:11.530 - 00:50:23.134, Speaker A: No, I agree. Like you said, we're in the morass of the court. We've got the courts. We've got nothing but the courts happening right now. Right. And that's expensive. It's slow.
00:50:23.134 - 00:50:47.620, Speaker A: It also, I tell people, somebody was asking me about SEC. Greyscale, and I was like, they're like, so if the SEC loses, like, that means grayscale will get approved. I was like, oh, no, it doesn't mean that. In fact, it might not even like, it's like the problem with, with the law, with the legal system. Not the problem. An interesting sort of problem is that the judgments can be extremely narrow or on technicalities or. Right.
00:50:47.620 - 00:51:08.570, Speaker A: Like, there's a way where the SEC loses and. But, like, Grace Gill doesn't really win. You know what I mean? Like, like. And that's very possible, if not even likely in a lot of these cases. So even if we spend all the money and spend all the time and, you know, try these things in court, we still. And even if we get a ruling, it might not even be a ruling that is useful. Right.
00:51:08.570 - 00:51:28.330, Speaker A: So that is not something we can hang our hat on. We've got to act otherwise, which I think is really what you're saying here. We've got to get that sensible middle out here. And I mean, I agree. I think that's very, very clear. I think you could get pretty much the biggest anti crypto consumer. I mean, not the biggest, but the.
00:51:28.330 - 00:51:44.386, Speaker A: Right in there on the 21%. Right? Not the. Not the bottom ten. Sorry. Like, you know, the 11% or not the 10%. That just is a band hammer. You could get that consumer protection advocate in a room with a libertarian anarcho capitalist and, and probably come up with something that makes a lot of sense, I think.
00:51:44.386 - 00:52:14.286, Speaker A: So I'm hoping that what I like about the new McHenry Thompson bill in the house is that it's by committal. Is that a word? Right. It's, it's, it's house ag and financial services getting together, which is rare, actually. I would like it to be bipartisan, but I think they'll get. At some point, this is a discussion draft. At some point, when something's introduced, they'll have bipartisan co sponsors. There are actually plenty of progressive Democrats that are interested in crypto.
00:52:14.286 - 00:52:35.674, Speaker A: Right. I'm not going to name a bunch of politicians right now, but there are some in the House financial services Committee. There are us senators who have spoken positively about crypto. Obviously, there's several that have had their name on bills that are positive for crypto in the Senate. Right. So I like it because it's so in depth. They've really just taken a swing at, like, every question.
00:52:35.674 - 00:52:44.690, Speaker A: Right. And so now there's something. It is the definition of discussion draft, but now we've got it. You're right. It's just so long. It's such a long bill. I had just finished reading it.
00:52:44.690 - 00:53:05.466, Speaker A: Somebody had a great meme, Ryan. It was like. Cause it came out, like, last Friday or something. And it was like, lawyers, like, just finished reading the 162 page bill, and then it was like, then, like, the 140 page binance, like, claim drops on Monday. Like that meme where, like, the face is, like, hollowed out. I think it's our duty now, though, to really get out and speak at this point. I mean, you're right.
00:53:05.466 - 00:53:11.934, Speaker A: The end is we can't just sit back and let this thing play its course. Like, we've got to get on the field now.
00:53:12.514 - 00:53:52.720, Speaker C: So it never really went anywhere. But, you know, I had actually spent a bit of time with, like, the bitcoin policy groups, you know, a year, year and a half ago, trying to come up with, like, a two line pledge similar to the Americans for tax reform pledge, the famous Grover Norquist pledge, essentially, like, no new taxes. And it was very simple. It fits in a tweet. But it's essentially the right to hold and use bitcoin and digital assets won't be infringed upon. And the right to the developments contribution and just general innovation around bitcoin and digital assets will not be unfairly impeded. Two very simple sentences.
00:53:52.752 - 00:53:53.616, Speaker A: Pretty fair statement.
00:53:53.680 - 00:54:30.276, Speaker C: Yeah, fair statement. A lot of things you need to work out around that. But going to the two questions that we just spent a lot of time on, the one where I do think it's like a hard line in the sand, if you're saying we can't own bitcoin, middle finger time, right. We're going to go to war because this is a constitutional protected civil liberty that we have for people to own their own property. And so yeah, we're going to have a problem with that if the government just pretends that the constitution doesn't exist because it's inconvenient. Right. But the second prong of that like unfairly impeded is open to a ton of interpretation.
00:54:30.276 - 00:55:29.562, Speaker C: Right. So that's the second question of like, okay, what should be the market structure regulations? How should we think about like assets that aren't quite decentralized that have been issued, whether you've got a company or you've got a team that kind of starts this, you know, what are the oversight rules there? What are the rules? Like, should we have safe harbors? Should people have to basically register as public companies? Like those are the things that get worked out in the legal process, but they're not necessarily constitutionally protected. It's like a delegated authority to Congress or, you know, the states or however you want to define it, where they're going to create the rules. And we need to be engaged in that process because that's sensible for the, for the state to have some say in how we think about these new assets. Given that we already have commodities laws, we already have currency laws, and we already have securities laws, we're clearly going to have digital assets laws. So what do those look like? Those are two related but very different things. And I think the tolerance threshold that we should have for government oversight needs to be more reasonable in the second bucket than in the first.
00:55:29.618 - 00:55:29.786, Speaker A: Right?
00:55:29.810 - 00:55:38.130, Speaker C: The first is, if you're telling me I can't own numbers in my head, we're going to go to court and we're going to fight to the death on this.
00:55:38.162 - 00:55:38.306, Speaker A: Right?
00:55:38.330 - 00:56:55.952, Speaker C: Because this is like just, it's a constitutionally protected right that people have to property. If it's, I want to be able to trade meme coins and airdrop assets and then have them listed on a secondary exchange and speculate and day trade on them and trade futures on them. Yeah. You have to assume that there's going to have to be a legal conversation and there's going to have to be some oversight of those markets because that's just the way that the world works today. And generally speaking, people are very much against government unfettered surveillance and their right to seize your property. But they're also very much for some light touch oversight of financial markets so that you don't have mass exploitation of people that don't know any better and just either theft or market abuse or whatever. I think we have to just be thoughtful and realistic about what do most Americans, what do most people want to see when it comes to laws in their countries and particularly financial laws? I think it's a pretty clean split along those two issues.
00:56:55.952 - 00:57:42.320, Speaker C: And very often I think they're getting muddied and all of crypto is getting thrown out by the progressives and the hardcore libertarians are saying everything should be legal and let the market decide. And in practice, that's led to a lot of bullshit the last couple of years that has really set us back in terms of trust, in terms of public sentiment. And it's just not good for society. It's not good to have stable coins blow up. It's not good to have rugs for meme coins and then just laugh at people for being idiots. That's, that's not how you win long term, and it's certainly not how you kind of bend society in the right direction. Not to mention how are you like we're worse than Wall street on some of those, on some of those axes.
00:57:42.320 - 00:57:58.064, Speaker C: Like do, do you want to be affiliated with a tech that's worse than Wall Street? I don't. And I think some of that is washing out now, and that's a good thing. But now's our opportunity to stamp it out definitively with, with common sense frameworks.
00:57:58.224 - 00:58:14.792, Speaker A: Love it. Hey, Ryan, before we wrap, tell our audience where they can find you, obviously. By the way, Masari IO I've been using for years, great source of information and data in the cryptocurrency markets. Tell us where to find digital freedom of Alliance DFA.
00:58:14.848 - 00:59:03.380, Speaker C: The new that launched this week is JoindFA, as in digitalfreedomalliance, joindfa.org dot. You can find out a little bit more information there. This is a complimentary advocacy group to the coin centers, the DeFi education funds, the blockchain associations of the world. But we're very much focused on PR, narrative developments, data driven kind of research and messaging campaigns that are going to move sentiment in DC, that are going to move sentiment in key congressional districts and just tell a better story in the aftermath of FTX and all the setbacks that we've had from just a public awareness and public relations standpoint the last six months especially.
