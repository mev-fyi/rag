As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmware research at Galaxy Digital. Thank you for listening to Galaxy Brains. We have a great show for you today. As I mentioned, Victor Boonen, head of protocol specialist at Coinbase, is our guest. We'll get into it about infrastructure, bitcoin lightning integration, crypto's value prop up proposition, and it's a great interview.
00:01:21.566 - 00:01:44.566, Speaker A: And of course, we'll check in with our good friend Bim at a BB from Galaxy trading, as always, to discuss markets. Big day, fed day today. We'll get into it. But before we get to all that, need to remind you to please refer to link to disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Man, I'm breezing, dude. I'm going quick. Feeling this beat, Phineas, we have an awesome episode, truly.
00:01:44.566 - 00:02:03.408, Speaker A: We're going to get into some really great stuff with Victor. He's been working in crypto infrastructure since at least 2019. And you know, Coinbase is a big player in this, so I'm really excited to share our conversation with you. It was a good one, and. But let's get into it with Bim net and start the show. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, BiMnet, thanks for coming on, Galaxy brains.
00:02:03.486 - 00:02:04.404, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:02:04.484 - 00:02:10.704, Speaker A: So, Fed day. But they declined to hike. So it's a flat, it's a skip.
00:02:11.004 - 00:02:11.844, Speaker B: Unchanged.
00:02:11.884 - 00:02:13.784, Speaker A: Yes, but what did they say?
00:02:14.604 - 00:02:27.452, Speaker B: So a couple of things. They kept rates as is, and they increased their forecast for where interest rates are likely to be at the end of 2024.
00:02:27.548 - 00:02:30.356, Speaker A: Even higher, for longer, correct? Yes, even higher.
00:02:30.380 - 00:02:47.844, Speaker B: So they reiterated the message of hire for longer via their tools of forward guidance, which is encapsulated by the dot plot. It went from a median dot of about 4.6 at the end of 24 to about 5.1.
00:02:47.924 - 00:02:48.596, Speaker A: So decent.
00:02:48.700 - 00:03:20.400, Speaker B: Decent. And it surprised the market in a meaningful way. And I think that was by intention. And I think what the Fed is basically trying to assess is the last leg of inflation is really tough to beat. And if market expectations get too ahead of themselves, it would actually be counter cyclical or counterfactual to what they're trying to do. So they're perpetually in the stance of like, we need to make sure that the market's surprised. They believe us.
00:03:20.400 - 00:03:36.740, Speaker B: Our credibility is high. And so you even saw during the press conference, Powell kind of reiterate that kind of messaging. I will, however, caveat that Powell said unknown so many different times during.
00:03:36.892 - 00:03:38.444, Speaker A: You mean the word unknown?
00:03:38.564 - 00:04:24.612, Speaker B: The word unknown. I mean, there are just so many variables with respect to energy prices. Like the world of post COVID is very different than pre COVID supply chains, et cetera. How the labor market is structured, the fiscal stimulus. There's so many unknowns, and it's such a dynamic economy that it's really tough for them to even believe in their forecasts. And that was the other thing that the Fed made a point on today. They increased their expectations for growth in 23 and 24 and 25, while I think their unemployment stuff kind of stayed the same around 4% unemployment for 24, 4.1%
00:04:24.612 - 00:04:31.060, Speaker B: for, you know, 25. But their core PCE estimates, like, moved.
00:04:31.092 - 00:04:32.692, Speaker A: Lower, which is their inflation target, which.
00:04:32.708 - 00:04:47.028, Speaker B: Was their inflation target. And so they're telling you that they're going to get to their inflation target without really harming employment that much in the forecasts, and that they're going to be higher for longer. And so that was like the data that was given to the market, which.
00:04:47.036 - 00:04:48.620, Speaker A: Is a soft landing scenario, right?
00:04:48.652 - 00:05:33.772, Speaker B: Soft landing ish. Yeah, no, absolutely. But again, you just realize that he's just stuck in such a tricky situation. Personally, I have found more confidence in some of the more dovish elements of the data that I've been seeing recently. And just from anecdotal bits of evidence, I do think things are slowing and that this could ultimately kind of be the last sort of big hawkish surprise, or not big, but moderately hawkish surprise from the Fed in a while. And I think that's supported by the price action that you've seen in the market. So if you look at two year yields, they sold off and got to 515.
00:05:33.772 - 00:05:50.012, Speaker B: But if you look at something like the five year yield or the seven year yield or the ten year yield, it was basically unchanged on the day, give or take a couple of basis points. Don't know where we are right now, but s and p, last I checked, we were down 50 basis points on the day and more.
00:05:50.068 - 00:05:53.172, Speaker A: Not too big a deal. Bitcoin is down 1%, right? Or something like that?
00:05:53.228 - 00:05:54.308, Speaker B: Yeah, it's down 1%.
00:05:54.356 - 00:05:57.548, Speaker A: We're in the high 26s, though. It's mostly the same.
00:05:57.676 - 00:06:19.894, Speaker B: Mostly the same. And so, like with the current state of where interest rate expectations are and the amount of money in the system and growth that's projected and what we know now, the Fed didn't really rock the boat per se, and it's really tough for them to rock the boat because we know that they're data dependent and we have high frequency data points.
00:06:21.474 - 00:06:24.774, Speaker A: You're primarily seeing the same data they're seeing. Primarily, yes.
00:06:25.394 - 00:06:32.322, Speaker B: It's a matter of. Is your reaction function that you think of the Fed's reaction function the same as the one that they have for the fed?
00:06:32.338 - 00:06:44.938, Speaker A: So the surprise was the higher dot plot at the end of next year, which. But that's relatively small of a surprise in the scheme of things. It wasn't a surprise hike or a surprise cut or anything like that. It wasn't dramatic or a huge shift in language.
00:06:45.106 - 00:06:46.834, Speaker B: It was a lack of an additional.
00:06:46.874 - 00:06:52.370, Speaker A: Cut or a skip. It's interesting. They are in that rock and a hard place, but.
00:06:52.442 - 00:06:53.154, Speaker B: Rock and hard place.
00:06:53.194 - 00:07:00.506, Speaker A: This isn't the Super bowl. We said big day, fed day, but this is more like a wild card game or something at this point. It's not like the fireworks we were seeing.
00:07:00.530 - 00:07:02.474, Speaker B: I feel like we were insulting wildcard.
00:07:02.594 - 00:07:05.626, Speaker A: I know it's not like the fireworks we were seeing earlier in the year.
00:07:05.690 - 00:07:22.920, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just quite telling. It just shows you where we are in the spot cycle. You're closer to the end rather than the beginning. And there's less surprises from the monetary policy side of things. And there are probably more surprises that are going to come from actual hard data and economic data series.
00:07:22.992 - 00:07:51.816, Speaker A: Other thing to bring up here that could affect all markets is a looming potential government shutdown. I think next week's episode will be right up on when the date actually hits. I think it's basically October 1. So we'll know more next week as to. But it seems increasingly likely that the US government will fail to be funded on time and will close. I think the last time it was closed for 35 days that it did close. So could be an impact, right.
00:07:51.816 - 00:07:53.992, Speaker A: I mean, on the country in the scheme of things.
00:07:54.128 - 00:08:14.002, Speaker B: I mean, totally, totally possible. I think it's just, you know, it's more likely than not to happen, it appears. But in terms of the impact, again, it's tough. Those federal employees, they're still going to get paid. It's just like a moderate one. And the federal contractors, et cetera. Yeah.
00:08:14.002 - 00:08:16.994, Speaker B: You're not going to get paid now, but government will reopen.
00:08:17.034 - 00:08:19.818, Speaker A: What about certain services? Is there not downstream?
00:08:19.906 - 00:08:28.202, Speaker B: No, certain services will def, I mean, the Fed was actually talking about it today in terms of they might not get certain data series for the Department.
00:08:28.258 - 00:08:29.578, Speaker A: Of labor is closed.
00:08:29.746 - 00:08:48.091, Speaker B: Bureau of Labor Statistics, whatever. Yeah. And so they'll just have to, like, make decisions without, you know, that, those bits of data. But again, the high frequency stuff is so good these days that it's like, do we really need, like, the Bureau of Labor Statistics to calculate a number that they've been doing the same way for 40 years?
00:08:48.147 - 00:09:01.350, Speaker A: Anecdotally, you watching it, how often does, like, BLS data have, like, dramatic difference, though, but. Or dramatic difference, though, from the other day, like, when you get official unemployment versus like, the payroll data or whatever, like, it's usually relatively in line. Right.
00:09:01.502 - 00:09:04.198, Speaker B: It tells the same story. Typically.
00:09:04.366 - 00:09:06.990, Speaker A: It'd be pretty rare to see them like, diverge dramatically. Right.
00:09:07.022 - 00:09:26.190, Speaker B: Well, where, where we really had the biggest diversion was, you know, like, you know, I would say a year to 18 months ago when, like, people saw rents going up, like 1215 percent CPI. And the CPI number was like stock at like six or something or seven or eight annualized. And it's like, on what planet was that data?
00:09:26.262 - 00:09:27.664, Speaker A: Like, where did that data come from?
00:09:27.704 - 00:09:28.680, Speaker B: Like, that's just not real.
00:09:28.752 - 00:09:29.360, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:09:29.512 - 00:09:31.632, Speaker B: And, like, you can see it on the street. Easy data.
00:09:31.728 - 00:09:34.648, Speaker A: So there can be some divergence.
00:09:34.736 - 00:09:35.056, Speaker C: Yes.
00:09:35.120 - 00:09:40.872, Speaker A: So not a huge impact even on data, although maybe one. And you're saying, I don't know, just generally not like a giant market event.
00:09:40.928 - 00:09:41.536, Speaker C: If we have a.
00:09:41.600 - 00:09:43.640, Speaker A: It's really just how long it's closed for. Right.
00:09:43.712 - 00:09:46.960, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's kind of the biggest implication.
00:09:46.992 - 00:10:04.794, Speaker A: This would. I would assume. I mean, I think the first time the US was ever downgraded was by S and P during a shutdown, what, in like 2011 or something back then. I forget the exact. I think it was after the. After the great financial crisis, but. And Fitch just downgraded the US over the summer.
00:10:04.794 - 00:10:09.230, Speaker A: And if so, this would only give further credence to that disruption. Yeah.
00:10:09.262 - 00:10:20.400, Speaker B: I mean, essentially, like all Congress. I mean, I don't mean this to be offensive, but essentially they just show up and they spend money we don't have.
00:10:20.582 - 00:10:22.036, Speaker A: That's what they've been doing for a long time.
00:10:22.100 - 00:10:22.924, Speaker B: Really long time.
00:10:22.964 - 00:10:23.236, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:10:23.300 - 00:10:27.828, Speaker B: And it's based on the premise that the US can just print money endlessly.
00:10:27.916 - 00:10:30.588, Speaker A: And our debt is over 30 trillion now, I believe.
00:10:30.636 - 00:10:36.836, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's an issue. Like, it's not an issue. It might not be an issue for five years, it might not be an issue for the debt.
00:10:36.860 - 00:10:38.500, Speaker A: It's almost guaranteed to be an issue.
00:10:38.532 - 00:10:54.048, Speaker B: But it would be such a big issue down the line that it's just irresponsible what we're doing. At the same time, you could have folks counter being like, well, if you think it's that serious, then maybe it's serious enough to shut down the government and force people to the table.
00:10:54.176 - 00:10:54.976, Speaker A: This is what's happening.
00:10:55.040 - 00:11:10.512, Speaker B: And I respect that thought. But given the nature of the discourse that we have and how polarized the two parties are in the nation, it's just tough to get to a pragmatic solution or to even agree on the facts to debate.
00:11:10.608 - 00:11:16.164, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. You're right. No, it's a precarious political situation. I agree, exactly.
00:11:16.324 - 00:11:20.644, Speaker B: Which is why the downgrade, you know, like, there's probably justified.
00:11:20.764 - 00:11:42.492, Speaker A: I mean, I think we're all witnessing how divided the country is and a house divided against itself really cannot stand. So, like, I hope just broadly something gives way in this political dynamic. I think everyone hopes something I personally understand doesn't mean we don't care about each. Groups don't have their own issues they care about and advocate for, but, like, the solution can't be just turn off the government, like. Right.
00:11:42.548 - 00:11:43.404, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:11:43.524 - 00:12:04.892, Speaker A: To your point, I understand how they get to that. Like, that play in the game, but, like, let's hope we can. Look, the first time I think it ever happened was basically, like, only ten years ago. This is not something that's normal in american history, but it's become normalized now. That's a sign of how dysfunctional it is. Well, look, we'll have more info on that next week, I think, as we get closer to the potential shutdown. So we'll talk more about it then.
00:12:04.948 - 00:12:06.344, Speaker B: We're on shutdown watch.
00:12:06.644 - 00:12:09.604, Speaker A: Bimnet abibi from galaxy trading. My friend, thanks for joining galaxy brains.
00:12:09.684 - 00:12:10.424, Speaker C: Pleasure.
00:12:11.924 - 00:12:15.668, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, Victor Boonen from Coinbase. Thank you, Victor, for coming on galaxy brains.
00:12:15.716 - 00:12:17.304, Speaker C: Victor, it's my pleasure to be here.
00:12:18.514 - 00:12:34.618, Speaker A: What do you do at Coinbase? I know we've talked before about the role protocol specialist. Is that what you do? And separately. Let's explain what protocol specialist is as a concept, because I remember you were promoting the concept of this being an important role in crypto.
00:12:34.706 - 00:13:05.048, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Protocol specialist is by far the most fun job in the world, and it's created to be that way. And so maybe I'll share a little bit, because I know you want to ask about bison trials later on as well. So I'll kind of give you the backstory for it. Um, so when I first applied to bicent, Charles, it was like, you know, peak bear Market, uh, 2019. And they had a position open called operations manager. And it just said, if you like crypto and you want crypto to be successful, come work here.
00:13:05.096 - 00:13:05.792, Speaker A: I was like, great.
00:13:05.848 - 00:13:06.360, Speaker C: That's me.
00:13:06.432 - 00:13:07.040, Speaker A: Yep.
00:13:07.192 - 00:13:34.906, Speaker C: Uh, but when I came to talk to them, and I had a good first conversation, and then for the second conversation, I was like, you know what? There's. I'm kind of seeing what they need because of their work on protocols and because of my background working on protocols and incentive models and all that. And so I wrote out basically what I thought my job description should be. So when I came to talk to Joe and Aaron, the two co founders, who are amazing, they were like, okay, we have a couple of things we want you to do. And then I was like, great. I have a list as well. Mine's run down.
00:13:34.906 - 00:13:44.202, Speaker C: So you tell me what you think, and I'll tell you where we align. And so they listed four things. I'm like, yep, got all those four. Here's the fifth thing they said. Yep, you should do that, too. And I said, great. That's my job description.
00:13:44.202 - 00:14:30.636, Speaker C: It was only after I started it that they were like, hey, we need to put a title in the onboarding paperwork. And that's how we came up with protocol specialist. And the TLDR of the role is that our job is to research and understand all the upcoming and live protocols. Oracles bridges anything with an incentive model and then operationalize those insights to drive product strategy, roadmap, legal, content, marketing features, all that kinds of stuff. It's a role that sits within the product, and I currently lead the protocol specialist team within Coinbase. As part of the product, we work on a lot of staking stuff. We help with bridging, we help with oracles and identity and all kinds of stuff.
00:14:30.636 - 00:14:56.640, Speaker C: Governance. And the reason I say it's a really fun role is that about half of the role is really clearly defined in that. Okay, like, Ben, who's on my team, like, okay, you own ethereum, right? And so, you know that you're responsible for, like, understanding all the upgrades and, like, seeing what's coming down the pipe. And, like, you know, right now, people are talking about, you know, increasing the max, effective balance of validators or, like, capping how many validators can enter that. Right.
00:14:56.672 - 00:14:59.472, Speaker A: Christine on our team published a great short report on that last week. So.
00:14:59.528 - 00:15:19.910, Speaker C: Yeah, Christine's wonderful. Yeah. And so, like, you're responsible for knowing and doing, and, like, working with the teams at Coinbase to, like, help them understand what's going on and play plan for it and all that stuff. So that's half the job. The other half the job is open ended. It's very entrepreneurial, and that there's a ton of opportunity out there. So, like, which protocol should we be supporting? Right.
00:15:19.910 - 00:15:57.114, Speaker C: It's your job to go and figure that out and, like, make recommendations for us. Right. Or, for example, there's, like, optimizations that we can do on the infrastructure side, or there's, like, governance things that we can do, or you can find other opportunities, for example, in MeV. Right. So I work super closely with the flashbots team for a couple of years. You know, we run Mavboost, which is a flashbots software at Coinbase Cloud, and then codebase retail and consolidating prime. Everybody uses it, but it was really our responsibility to not only figure that out, but also just make sure that we're super comfortable with the way that things work, that we understand all the edge cases that we communicated well to customers.
00:15:57.114 - 00:16:14.264, Speaker C: If you consider the role, it's actually quite nice, because there's nobody else that's really responsible for a lot of this stuff. Like, product managers, engineering managers. Like, they all have full time jobs that they're already doing. And so having something like a protocol specialist to supplement everybody else's work and take the charge of some of this stuff is really helpful.
00:16:14.304 - 00:16:27.880, Speaker A: It's really interesting. It's like the research and then operational glue, because, like you said, I mean, an engineer, their job is to implement. They're busy. You never have too many engineers. Right. They're always going to be busy. I really like this.
00:16:27.880 - 00:17:10.216, Speaker A: I think we at Galaxy, with Galaxy Research, we play a similar role, I would say, with less replacing the operational implementation part of it with public publishing. But again, it's nice that both of our companies know and recognize, first of all, how novel and complicated the space can be. You actually really do need people whose job it is to follow it, figure it out, make recommendations about how to do it. So you mentioned Bison trails. Let's talk about it, because this is how I knew of you first. Bison Trails is an infrastructure company that was one of the first staking as a service type firms, right? Yeah, but was acquired by Coinbase, which is how you ended up at Coinbase. Right.
00:17:10.216 - 00:17:29.784, Speaker A: Because you were at Bison trails. You said 2019. This was maybe at the very beginning of the concept of public blockchain infrastructure. I think there was really only bitcoin mining then, or ethereum mining. Right. There was. There were some proof of stake networks, but it hadn't been institutionalized in a way that there was infrastructure providers.
00:17:29.784 - 00:17:50.552, Speaker A: What was it like back then? And by the way, I think we said bison trails did do bitcoin mining and was early then in staking, and then that's how the whole staking of a service thing. But what was it like then compared to today? How much more sophisticated is the infrastructure side of the public blockchain world now? Yeah, it's a lot, but give me the bison trails then and now.
00:17:50.688 - 00:18:41.694, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, back then, there were a couple of companies that were around before us, but when bikes and trails came onto a scene, we just totally dominated the way that we ran infrastructure. And even now, the way that we run infrastructure is the best in the entire industry because we're entirely cloud based. We're multi cloud, multi region. We use all the top technologies that you can. I think that one of the interesting things is that right now, there's a ton more infrastructure providers and there's a ton more low cost infrastructure providers. And so I think that there's still kind of, like, this ability to run things in a really institutional, enterprise grade way, and that's something that we specialize in, and we do extremely well.
00:18:41.694 - 00:19:08.696, Speaker C: But it's been really interesting because I kind of thought that there's going to be this great consolidation of infrastructure companies. I thought a lot of them were going to go out of business and there's really going to be a few key players left standing and actually turned out to be the opposite. There's so much opportunity in the space, and staking is growing so rapidly that you have this wide stratum of companies that are starting up in the space that do things in different ways. Some of them have been very successful, and it's been really cool to see.
00:19:08.880 - 00:19:54.110, Speaker A: Yeah. And there are, it is pretty big, and especially in the ethereum ecosystem now with, since the transition, obviously since the merge, you also have these semi decentralized, or even fully decentralized. There's a pretty broad spectrum. But I've been really, Coinbase has been a pioneer here, I would say. Well, certainly on the centralized side, but not just with the staking that you guys offer, but also even with the alluvial. So even pushing the boundaries on institutional staking concepts and innovating, there has been quite. So it's come a long way though, right? Cause it was bison trails and the couple others, right? Like block, Damon, and I forget who else was there that long ago, but not many.
00:19:54.110 - 00:20:11.368, Speaker A: We didn't really exist. Right. I mean, there wasn't even really a lot of proof of stake networks. Now they're almost all proof of stake. Do you see? I don't know. How do you view the infrastructure landscape further evolving? What's the long term future in your mind?
00:20:11.526 - 00:20:40.066, Speaker C: Yeah, and I guess I'll kind of talk about alluvial a little bit, and I'll give a quick disclosure. So alluvial was actually a team that kind of spun out of Coinbase cloud and also combination with figment, so they spun out to do their own thing. And so Coinbase Ventures is a large investor and disclosure. I have my own kind of side fund called credibly neutral, and I'm an investor in Louvre as well. So just giving that disclosure. Appreciate that. I've been working with them for a long time.
00:20:40.066 - 00:21:16.586, Speaker C: I helped them get started back when it was Coinbase. And so I think that the kind of big change that is coming up that people are starting to realize is that if you look at the shift in the crypto market, originally, we started off with 100% self custody. Satoshi mined the first blog, and he had the 50 bitcoin. It's in his wallet, 100% self custody. And over time, we're like, moving more and more in the direction of institutional custody. And so, like me personally, I've held my crypto for a long time. I love using Coinbase for custody.
00:21:16.586 - 00:21:39.870, Speaker C: I love using Coinbase prime, and I think more and more people are going to be moving in that direction. And so I think that JP Morgan is going to enable staking. I think fidelity is going to enable staking. I think all these guys are going to be in the space. And so the question becomes how do you actually service that market? And that's where I think alluvial plays a big role in the liquid sahi market. And, you know, companies are huge fans of them.
00:21:39.942 - 00:21:42.974, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, I. Yeah.
00:21:43.134 - 00:22:09.112, Speaker C: And just to touch on there, it's because like, you know, Lido is an incredible, incredible team and they have a great product and asieth is awesome. Right. I'm a huge fan of, a huge fan of their team. But having said that, alluvial is really focus on, it's like, okay, if you assume that shaping organizations are going to come online, what are the options available to them and how do you enable them to participate in an open standard rather than implementing proprietary solutions.
00:22:09.208 - 00:22:42.784, Speaker A: Right. And a product that, like, to your point, no comment necessarily on like why wouldn't they use lido or coinbase or whatever, but like there's a, it's a new market segment and they may have bespoke needs. Right. And they do. I think we all know that the needs, whether it's for infrastructure or even wallet, technology, custody, whatever, are very different if you're a retail user, family, office or then a giant institution. It's a big ecosystem and I think it makes a lot of sense. There's room for players that service on each level of that ecosystem.
00:22:42.784 - 00:23:25.504, Speaker A: Do you think? That's a good question. By the way, I think Citibank just announced that they made Citicoin basically, which is very similar, the way I understand the announcement, this public announcement, similar to what JPMorgan has and had been doing for years with JPM Coin. Right. Do you think that. How long, put it this way, not with either of them in particular, but how long before we finally get what you said about them participating in the open standard versus, I think both of those examples. As far as I understand it, Citi and JP are still like permission, private DLT type solution. How long until they connect to the open Internet of value or not? How long? What are the barriers in your mind? Are we heading there? Does crypto become financial infrastructure for tradfi?
00:23:25.624 - 00:23:32.848, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe this is a hot take to some, but a very cold take to others.
00:23:32.936 - 00:23:33.564, Speaker A: Sure.
00:23:34.584 - 00:23:37.560, Speaker C: I don't think permission blockchains are a real thing.
00:23:37.712 - 00:23:38.072, Speaker A: Right.
00:23:38.128 - 00:24:25.826, Speaker C: Like, I don't think that they are inherently useful. You know, we've had kind of like shared databases for a long time, right? This isn't a new thing. And so when I kind of look at it, I'm just like, I think it's a good stepping stone, but I think that there is no future where permission blockchains are the thing that wins or even the thing that gets used by, like, institutions sharing things. And we have a lot of data on this. We have ten years of data of people trying to do this, and it just not really going anywhere. And this is one area where I give a lot of credit to eY, where I actually used to work as a consultant back when I, as I was getting into crypto. But Paul Brody and team, they looked at the permission space and there's a lot of work there, and they were like, you know what? Public blockchains are the future.
00:24:25.826 - 00:24:51.140, Speaker C: And they went all in on ethereum. And I think that's what's going to happen with a lot of these institutions. Right? Like, to get your toes wet, you have to be like, hey, we're going to do this safe permission thing that we know and love and da da da da da. But then you do it and you're like, okay, that's not really meeting our objectives. We're not able to get the network effects. We're not able to get all the folks that we'd like to use to actually use it. And so you end up having to switch to public blockchains by default over time.
00:24:51.140 - 00:24:54.588, Speaker C: And so I think it's a good first step, and I think they're on the way.
00:24:54.716 - 00:25:03.204, Speaker A: I love that you said that. I was director of blockchain research at Fidelity, where we also tried a lot of, there were so many enterprise blockchain.
00:25:03.244 - 00:25:06.756, Speaker C: Use cases, and some of these organizations had like hundreds of members.
00:25:06.820 - 00:25:12.772, Speaker A: I remember there was a time, I believe, when State street apparently, I think, was employing like 50 hyperledger engineers or something.
00:25:12.828 - 00:25:13.420, Speaker C: Oh, wow.
00:25:13.532 - 00:25:31.988, Speaker A: I forget. This is years ago. This is like 2018. I love that you said that. I think to me, the value of blockchain is to allow and enable parties that don't know each other, or in some cases can't know each other, or even in additional cases might know each other and be enemies to still achieve final settlement in a disintermediated way.
00:25:32.116 - 00:25:32.404, Speaker C: And.
00:25:32.444 - 00:25:42.438, Speaker A: Right, if we know each other, if we're business partners or you're a vendor to me or whatever, we have a legal contract. We can fall back on that. Why not just use a SQL database or something like that?
00:25:42.516 - 00:26:09.824, Speaker C: Yeah. And I also think that the permissioned aspects of what they're looking for can oftentimes be built out on public chains. Right, good point. Also, you can whitelist things and so you can gain access pretty aggressively. The things that are hard to do is to get things like privacy in terms of your data or who you're transacting with or whatever. Whatever. Even though it's synonymous, there's a bunch of solutions that are being built in that regard.
00:26:09.824 - 00:26:28.720, Speaker C: And so my wife Lisa is CEO at Aztec, which is a privacy layer, too. And so I'm hoping that, like a lot of these things will start kind of like pushing the boundaries of what is possible on chain so that these institutions feel much more comfortable using public blockchains and permissioning some of the components of what they're doing, but also leveraging privacy for some other components of what they're doing.
00:26:28.752 - 00:26:58.694, Speaker A: I think that open technology standard standard being as in widely adopted, agreed upon format that the public blockchain offers, is very powerful. I think the hope for some of those big corps that we mentioned maybe that are doing more permissioned, we'll call it experiments, as far as I understand it today, is that at some point they at least make a bridge. I can see a world where you have the private internal thing. It's still built on the same standard, so it's easily compatible. And then you just can bridge in and out. Right. If you want to move stuff around inside your big bank, sure.
00:26:58.694 - 00:27:10.372, Speaker A: You don't have to use the public chain. Why do it? It's costly. Right. But if I want to withdraw my stocks or treasuries or dollars or whatever it is, or coins. Right. Like, then there's a bridge, basically some kind of bridge. What do you think about that?
00:27:10.508 - 00:27:11.316, Speaker C: I don't believe in that.
00:27:11.380 - 00:27:18.828, Speaker A: Yeah, no, just, just because that would be like an Internet, Internet version of the world. But you don't like a hub and spoke. Yeah. Just, you don't, you don't think that's necessary?
00:27:18.916 - 00:27:44.310, Speaker C: I just don't think it's necessary. Yeah. I think that at the end of the day, I think that all of finance will move on chain just straight up. Right. I think there will be, you know, off chain computation. There will be a lot of this stuff. But when you really think about it, like, is there a good reason for why, you know, equity ownership isn't like, like known, like who, you know, like which addresses have have what or whatever, whatever or which accounts have what.
00:27:44.310 - 00:27:58.122, Speaker C: And it's like you look at the current system of how things are built and you realize it's all kind of an accident, you know, like, you know, the reason you have kind of, like, all equities being, you know, kind of held by. By one company that's tracking everything.
00:27:58.178 - 00:27:59.194, Speaker A: Yeah, the DTCC. Yeah.
00:27:59.234 - 00:28:07.458, Speaker C: Right, right. Is just kind of a fluke. Like, they just had all these papers and they're like, hey, all these paper equities are wild. We should really do something about this.
00:28:07.506 - 00:28:15.010, Speaker A: It really is true. I've told this story before. They call the paperwork crisis, actually. They were literally like dropping certificates in the mud and stuff. They were like, you know what? Let's give them all to one party.
00:28:15.122 - 00:28:15.754, Speaker C: Yeah, that's.
00:28:15.794 - 00:28:19.562, Speaker A: It. Rose out of necessity. It wasn't designed proactively.
00:28:19.658 - 00:28:36.372, Speaker C: Yeah. And so, and so I don't take for granted that, like, things can be a different way, you know, and because of that, when I kind of look at, you know, the design space, I try to learn from what was done before, but I'm also not like, this is the correct answer. You know what I mean?
00:28:36.428 - 00:28:46.524, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a. That makes a lot of sense. I think if we redesign the system from scratch, what would be the optimal way to design it? Right. And you think the public blockchain is a clear, clear use case here?
00:28:46.604 - 00:28:47.894, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely.
00:28:48.474 - 00:29:10.322, Speaker A: That's a big topic and really interesting point of view. Thanks for sharing. Let's move on because I have a couple other questions I want to ask about, one that I want to talk about, and we'll get right into it. Now, I have other stuff, too. Let's talk about the Lightning network. You were on Twitter. You were deputized on Twitter by, I believe, Brian Armstrong at one point saying, we are going to look into it and Victor is going to lead that effort.
00:29:10.322 - 00:29:32.854, Speaker A: And then you documented a little bit. I remember there was a selfie with Elizabeth Stark of Lightning Labs. And later. Anyway, you guys have now announced, Coinbase had announced on Twitter, Twitter that you will be moving forward to integrate the lightning network at Coinbase, which is bitcoin's fast, cheap L2. It's a state channel network. It's bi directional payment channel, not just for our audience. We've talked about it a fair amount on this show.
00:29:32.854 - 00:30:00.642, Speaker A: What was that? I think based on your description of being a protocol specialist, this fits right in that role of both learning about then helping operationalize or theorizing and performing research on whether to operationalize what benefits are. Anyway, you went on this journey. Tell us about this journey and also why did you look into it and what did you find? Let's talk about why Coinbase is integrating bitcoin's lightning network.
00:30:00.738 - 00:30:01.898, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:30:02.066 - 00:30:05.650, Speaker A: It's a big, big, giant lightning network. Pile of questions for you.
00:30:05.802 - 00:30:34.154, Speaker C: A lot of stuff. And so I think one thing that people don't know is that I've actually been involved with lightning Network for a long time. So I worked with Elizabeth Stark and Lightning lab team, some other folks to actually organize the first Lightning summit back in 2019 in Berlin. And so, you know, I haven't stayed as close since then, but, like, you know, I've been around and it's wild to think that was four years ago, soon to be five.
00:30:34.314 - 00:30:35.014, Speaker A: Right.
00:30:36.034 - 00:30:38.978, Speaker C: And so I'll try to answer all the bits that you asked.
00:30:39.026 - 00:30:44.402, Speaker A: Let's just start. Let me help you out here. Why then was coinbase interested in looking into it?
00:30:44.538 - 00:30:55.224, Speaker C: Yeah, I think. I think a couple of reasons. I think the first thing is that, you know, we've been looking at it for. For a long time, you know, and Brian tweeted about it and obviously, you know, there's folks internally that have been looking at it.
00:30:55.264 - 00:30:55.844, Speaker A: Right.
00:30:56.824 - 00:31:06.304, Speaker C: And so this is the bitcoin scaling solution. And so there was never a question of, like, will we ever support, like, it was never, like, we're never gonna support this.
00:31:06.344 - 00:31:06.928, Speaker A: Right, right.
00:31:07.056 - 00:31:47.814, Speaker C: Not that kind of stuff. But, you know, it's really, when you look at something like lightning, you have to consider kind of like the adoption, you have to consider the volume, you have to consider the usage and the requests and the technology itself and all kinds of stuff. And I think that for many years, Lightning has been quite challenging, right. To use to run. The non custodial experience is still severely lacking relative to the custodial experience. And so when you look at that kind of stuff, there's a couple of factors. I think the first factor is just that you want the technology to come along to a place where you feel a lot better about it.
00:31:47.814 - 00:32:41.692, Speaker C: And kudos to Lightning Labs team and all the other clients and core devs for getting it to where it is today. I think there's definitely still a lot of room for improvement, but kudos to where they got it. I think the second bit is around continued adoption, having a lot of the major exchanges add support for it, having binance add support for it, having folks throughout the industry start using it more and more and start kind of like sharing some of the metrics around, growing, continued usage, growing TVL growing volume. Some of these things are not as easy to kind of suss out. But once you start asking questions, you get some good estimates and the last bit is lightning is aligned with Coinbase or other Coinbase is aligned with lightning. Maybe it's a better way to put it. And that Coinbase is unequivocally pro bitcoin.
00:32:41.692 - 00:33:02.524, Speaker C: Coinbase onboarding more bitcoiners than anybody else in the world by far. And we've been pro bitcoin for a long time. And so helping bitcoin get to 1 second one send transactions is something that's really important. And it's aligned with what we want to do. It's aligned with economic freedom and it's aligned with the mission of what we're trying to accomplish.
00:33:02.604 - 00:33:32.860, Speaker A: That makes a lot of sense. And so you went on this journey, I saw you talk about lightning labs, but you had a tweet when a couple, really only about a week ago, probably, where Brian said you guys were going to integrate it. And then you had listed a whole bunch of people that you talked to and just some that I'm recalling, and I have apologies if I'm leaving some people out, but like for example, Alex Leishman at River, they have a big lightning node. And of course, Elizabeth Labs. Elizabeth Stark. Tim Apple Lightning Labs.
00:33:32.892 - 00:33:34.356, Speaker B: Yeah, Tim Apple, exactly.
00:33:34.540 - 00:33:58.174, Speaker A: What did you find about the state of it? Because so many have, there are a lot of it. I mean, binance has it, a bunch of exchange have it. The team cash app has lightning. Right. River, I mentioned, has a good lightning experience. What is the potential use then? Is it similar? I mean, is it deposits and withdrawals for Coinbase users? If I choose to use lightning, is that what you guys are thinking as a first step here?
00:33:58.334 - 00:34:21.171, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's kind of what we shared around the deposit withdrawal flow. I think that when you think about what are the most important things to consider, there's a whole bunch of ways in which you can use lightning, you can use it for remittances, you can use it for payments, you can use it for merchant adoption, yada, yada, yada, there's a whole bunch of stuff.
00:34:21.227 - 00:34:21.803, Speaker A: Yeah, true.
00:34:21.883 - 00:35:09.704, Speaker C: And in the long term, like, if you think that bitcoin is going to be, you know, a money for the world, like, all these use cases are going to be the right use cases. Right, right. And so when we look at, you know, Coinbase and why we decided to go with like, retail support first, it's just, you know, you have to think about how do you prioritize of like, what's the highest value add? Right. And I think being able to deposit and withdraw on the lightning network is something that's gonna be a huge unlock. Because I think onboarding flows generally, people sometimes forget how important it is and how much of an unlock it is. Coinbase has, I don't know what our latest numbers, like 100 million plus users or whatever it is a lot of folks. That's a big number.
00:35:10.764 - 00:35:33.976, Speaker A: And it matters too, like you said, for on ramping off, particularly for things that are like l two s, I always like, sure. I mean, I could buy bitcoin on Coinbase, then I could send it to my node and I could open a lightning channel with it. Right. But that's a lot of steps. It's very hard. Sometimes I just want to go right from like buying with dollars to having on lightning and those, those, the custodial bridge there is very effective.
00:35:34.080 - 00:35:43.432, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And if you, and if you really think about it, right, like in the long term, right. If we're looking at like ten years out, there's a really good chance users will never touch all ones.
00:35:43.488 - 00:35:44.160, Speaker A: I agree. Yeah.
00:35:44.192 - 00:35:44.764, Speaker C: Right.
00:35:45.254 - 00:36:16.544, Speaker A: Let's talk about that too, because I totally, I think that's. A lot of people think that's true for the ethereum ecosystem as well, which is experiencing. Coinbase was calling it on chain summer. I've been calling it l two season. Right. It's like partly because of the advancements in roll up technology, but even lightning, I think, to your point, it's clearly reached a threshold where it's interesting and you're capable of onboarding it from a technology standpoint. So even in the bitcoin, and there's a lot of talk in bitcoin too, about roll ups, and there's a whole debate about drive chains.
00:36:16.544 - 00:36:38.440, Speaker A: It's another type of merge mine thing. But again, the l two. Let's talk about the l two world. How many l one s do we need then for final settlement? If we're really just transacting and computing off chain in some l two environment and then committing on chain and having that be where final settlement occurs, what's your l one l two vision for that future that you started to mention?
00:36:38.552 - 00:37:13.694, Speaker C: Yeah, I think a couple of things. There's a couple things I think will be true in the long run. I think that one thing is we have to remember, why are we here? We're here to create money. Fundamentally, at the end of the day, we are making new and different monies to the things that are in existence today. And that's the innovation behind bitcoin. I ask people, what did Satoshi invent? People say, oh, it's hashing or it's proof of work or it's Nakamoto consensus or all this other stuff. And the reality is what he invented is a token.
00:37:13.694 - 00:37:28.794, Speaker C: Just straight up. He invented the incentive model. And so he's not going to get some comp sci award. He's going to get the economics prize in the Nobel Prize for economics, if it ever comes to that, which I think it will. It should.
00:37:28.834 - 00:37:35.138, Speaker A: I think it should. It's actually incredible. I agree, though. You're saying primarily a creation of new type of money is the real innovation here. Yeah.
00:37:35.186 - 00:37:53.678, Speaker C: Yeah. And so when I look at l one s, the thing that I always think about is, is your token money. And if it's not money, then I don't think you're really playing the right game. Like, that is something you have to be competing on. And there's some people that are of the belief that there will be many, many monies. And I certainly think it's possible. Right.
00:37:53.678 - 00:38:18.262, Speaker C: There will be many tokens, there will be many currencies. But I also think it's going to be an incredible kind of like power law there, where if URL1 is not competing to be a really strong money. And that's a very hard thing to do. And there's a lot of stuff behind that that it's very difficult for me to see, kind of like what that relevance is. And so I think that's. That's the first thing you have to be competing to be money. The second thing is, and maybe there's a question for you.
00:38:18.262 - 00:38:21.918, Speaker C: So let's say crypto reaches full adoption, whatever that means to you.
00:38:21.966 - 00:38:22.262, Speaker A: Yep.
00:38:22.318 - 00:38:27.022, Speaker C: Right. What do you think will be the transactions per second, the TPS of the.
00:38:27.038 - 00:38:28.350, Speaker A: L1 s or crypto?
00:38:28.382 - 00:38:28.694, Speaker C: Crypto.
00:38:28.734 - 00:38:29.390, Speaker A: A lot.
00:38:29.542 - 00:38:30.542, Speaker C: Yes, a lot.
00:38:30.638 - 00:38:39.442, Speaker A: Extremely high number. I don't know. I mean, how many transactions are happening today in all commerce? Probably, you know, a million per second, maybe. I don't. I don't know. Actually. I have no idea.
00:38:39.442 - 00:38:43.746, Speaker A: 500,000 /second in the world. Maybe it's 10 million. Really don't know.
00:38:43.770 - 00:38:44.322, Speaker C: Okay.
00:38:44.458 - 00:38:45.418, Speaker A: Maybe it's a billion.
00:38:45.546 - 00:38:46.170, Speaker C: Right.
00:38:46.322 - 00:38:50.258, Speaker A: I really have no idea. Those are. That's a giant order of magnitude discrepancy I have.
00:38:50.346 - 00:38:50.906, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:38:51.050 - 00:38:53.978, Speaker A: I'll say. I'll say 10 million /second okay.
00:38:54.066 - 00:38:55.386, Speaker C: I think it'll be a billion per second.
00:38:55.450 - 00:39:01.630, Speaker A: Okay, fair. So. And what am I forgetting, too, when I think all the online instant and all the inventor, vendor and company payments and bank.
00:39:01.762 - 00:39:06.414, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think that it'll be, you know, a lot of Iot stuff.
00:39:06.494 - 00:39:11.470, Speaker A: Does that also mean that baked into your number is that you also think the speed of commerce is gonna increase.
00:39:11.582 - 00:39:34.938, Speaker C: Oh, tremendously. But it's also if you make the assumption that, you know, all of finance, all of identity, all of, you know, a whole bunch of other use cases are gonna be on chain. Yeah. If you have a loan, right, you have a mortgage, you're gonna be updating that thing all the time. Right? You're gonna have money be streaming all the time. Right? Like, there's a whole bunch of stuff that you're gonna be able to do, right. Um, you know, once the, the cost of payments and transactions and updating kind of goes down really significantly.
00:39:34.938 - 00:40:17.454, Speaker C: And so when I think about it that way, I also struggle with l one s that are just l one s because I'm kind of like, okay, if you want to get to a billion TPS, I don't care how your blockchain is designed, you're not going to hit a billion TPS on a monolithic blockchain. And so you have to be planning for a modular future. And, you know, and we can do kind of debate on, like, how soon will that modular future arrive. But I also think that even if you think it's not going to happen this year or next year, which is obviously right, these things take a long time to actually build out, and it's very, very hard. And Ethereum has been talking about l two s for a long time. They're just now starting to get there. But even now, the technology is not fully ready.
00:40:17.454 - 00:40:48.636, Speaker C: Bitcoin's lightning has been around for a long time. Again, still not fully ready. These things are very hard to build. And so if you think that that's where the world is going to be heading, if you think it's going to be a billion TPS, then you have to be planning for a modular world. And so when I take these two components of, you want the token to be money, and you also want to do this modular thing that is looking at a billion TPS. I think there will be multiple l ones for sure, but I think those are both very difficult things to kind of go after. And so I think it's going to kind of whittle the field.
00:40:48.636 - 00:41:04.222, Speaker C: And so the other, I think l ones that will exist will be essentially work token models, right? They'll be providing some particular service. So when you look at something like a celestia, they're doing data availability. It's another one, but it's like providing a thing that people consume, right.
00:41:04.278 - 00:41:10.174, Speaker A: You can't actually transact. Right. There's no computation there. Right?
00:41:10.254 - 00:41:13.262, Speaker C: Yes. It's not a general purpose thing. Right.
00:41:13.318 - 00:41:41.078, Speaker A: Right. Do you think there'll be. Because I learning about modularity, what we now call modularity, which is more about disaggregating the features of a blockchain, I think. But I still just put the concept of layered scaling as modularity, modularity, just that this layer, an arbitrum might have all, might have actually relies on ETH for DA, but it does computation, settlement and transactions there. So really, the whole concept of layered scaling is modularity. Right.
00:41:41.166 - 00:41:42.830, Speaker C: Yeah. Some people disagree.
00:41:42.902 - 00:42:02.066, Speaker A: The lazy ledger, though. I think so. And I just think the lazy ledger original paper was just like, wait a sec. We can even be more granular in how we think about layers, right. We can separate the layers inside. Not everything has to be just a clone of the l one that rolls up to it. I think that makes a lot of sense.
00:42:02.066 - 00:42:18.134, Speaker A: Big corners, too, have been talking about layered scaling for forever, and lightning is a decent example. You have off chain computation, but you have data availability. You have no data availability. That uses l one for data. Anyway. We could get into that, but I think it's a powerful concept. I agree.
00:42:18.134 - 00:42:31.038, Speaker A: Maybe the Solana crowd thinks that you can scale all the way, but even they've started looking into sort of layered concepts. I agree. It's a far cry from 50 or 100,000 tps to a billion.
00:42:31.206 - 00:42:40.510, Speaker C: Yeah. Although I will say that if they can do 50,000 tps, and I don't know what the latest numbers are, that's enough for all of crypto right now.
00:42:40.702 - 00:42:41.414, Speaker A: That's a lot.
00:42:41.494 - 00:42:51.852, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a lot. And I give Solana team a lot of credit. They are taking a differentiated approach, and I'm huge fans of, of their team. And I know, like Raj and Tolle and Austin.
00:42:51.908 - 00:42:55.708, Speaker A: Well, I was going to say Austin used to work with you guys at Bison trails, right? Wasn't he a Bison trails guy?
00:42:55.756 - 00:42:57.212, Speaker C: That's right. Yeah. Yeah, he was.
00:42:57.308 - 00:43:16.980, Speaker A: Yeah. No, I agree. This is what I think. To be honest, when we do this layer one future kind of discussion, it's one of the only, one of the reasons why Solana is one of the only ones that I find particularly interesting, because it truly, it's not an EVM clone. Right. It's like, got a whole separate. And I find that technological differentiation to be very notable and interesting.
00:43:16.980 - 00:43:18.684, Speaker A: And it is quite of a different approach.
00:43:18.804 - 00:43:41.588, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah. 100%. That's one of the reasons why I give Aslana ecosystem so much credit. It's that not only did they have a differentiated approach, right. But they really stuck to it and they built a following around that and a belief system around that. And I do disagree with kind of like the monolithic approach.
00:43:41.588 - 00:43:42.740, Speaker C: I mean, as you said.
00:43:42.772 - 00:43:50.994, Speaker A: Yeah, I kind of do also. I mean, as I don't think it's. I think eventually they'll have to fall back into a modular approach as well. But they're pushing the boundaries, though, on.
00:43:51.074 - 00:44:38.570, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And, you know, and I think that. And I've said this, Raj, and totally in the team, I think that the approach they're taking clearly does have legs, you know, and if their scalability is, like, super high and they have fire dancer coming, which will, you know, another client. Yeah, yeah. Hopefully that'll push scalability even higher, and you kind of push out the need for modularity, and that can be an advantage in its own right. Because if you let Ethereum and you let bitcoin and you let all these other folks go and experiment and see what works and what doesn't work, and then you wait it out and then you're like, okay, I'm just going to take the best pieces of what you've done and bring it over, then that can be a really effective strategy as well. So lots there to talk about.
00:44:38.682 - 00:45:03.014, Speaker A: Yeah, we could go on and on about this. Let's step back. Sort of getting close to the end of this interview. I want to step back. And you talked about protocol specialist being the best job in the world in general. How do you feel about working again? As someone who's been in crypto for a while, how do you feel right now as someone who's working, how important is this technology to the world? Do you feel? Give us a sense of your sense of mission when it comes to working on this stuff.
00:45:03.874 - 00:45:25.126, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, back in, so I got a script in 2017, and then in 2018, I was already living with my then girlfriend, now wife Lisa, and the market was doing terrible, and everything was bad and down and sad.
00:45:25.230 - 00:45:26.502, Speaker A: Yeah, it was bleak.
00:45:26.638 - 00:45:48.876, Speaker C: It was very bleak. And she asked me, she's like, why are you so into crypto? And I remember sitting on the couch with her, and I was like, I have no idea. Let me think about it. I just never thought about it. And so I sat there and I recalled a memory that I had completely forgotten about. So this is in college. So we're immigrants.
00:45:48.876 - 00:46:21.994, Speaker C: I went to Baruch, which is a city school, and we got FAFSA, which is financial aid, to go there. And I also got a scholarship. And during the time, I was also working at this really terrible clothing store called Rainbow, where it's like this woman's clothing store, and the most expensive item there was, like, $25. And at the time, I was working evenings. I was working all weekend. And for my mom's birthday, I wanted to go. And I usually gave her money as a gift.
00:46:21.994 - 00:46:39.546, Speaker C: And so I remember after my shift ended at, like, 10:00 I went to the local chase branch. I went to the ATM, and I wanted to withdraw $3,000 to give to my mom. And the ATM was like, no, sorry, I can't do it. I was like, well, that's weird. I know the money is there. So I try again. They're like, no, call this number.
00:46:39.546 - 00:47:03.194, Speaker C: So I call the number, I call chase, and I'm like, hey, I'm here. That's not giving me my money. And she said, your daily withdrawal limit is 2000. I was like, okay, well, I am here. I'm on a call with you to just validate whatever you need to validate and just give my money. And she was like, no, your daily withdrawal limit is 2000. And I remember just getting irrationally angry.
00:47:03.194 - 00:47:20.006, Speaker C: I was so furious. I was like, how dare they not give me my money? It's my money. And I was so pissed. And so I ended up withdrawing the 2000. I came back. Then I did. Took another thousand, and I completely forgot about that memory until she asked me.
00:47:20.006 - 00:47:47.426, Speaker C: And now, because I think that was the moment that my trust and institutions was broken, I was like, oh, they can just refuse to give it to me, and there's nothing that I can do about it. And so I think a lot about the imbalance of power between individuals and the financial institutions, but also governments. And I look at a lot of stuff that's happening right now where I'm like, hey, I think it'd be quite nice. I'm a believer in financial institutions. I'm a believer in government. I immigrated from Russia. I love paying taxes.
00:47:47.426 - 00:48:22.394, Speaker C: Not that I love paying taxes, but I'm happy to pay taxes. I pay a lot of taxes. So something like that. But more like, I would like for the imbalance of power to be more shifted in the direction of individuals. I would like for the institutions that govern us to feel a sense of responsibility for us, rather than kind of like doing whatever they want, printing whatever they want, getting away with whatever they want. And so I think that's really important to me. And I think as we're heading into this coming world of continued advancements in technology, continued advancements and all kinds of crazy stuff in AI and blah, blah, blah.
00:48:22.394 - 00:48:27.374, Speaker C: You need for governments to be responsible to the people that they represent.
00:48:27.534 - 00:48:31.862, Speaker A: And you think crypto and public blockchains can be a force that helps push that forward?
00:48:31.998 - 00:49:04.548, Speaker C: Yeah, I think transparency is a huge, important force. I think the ability for people to self custody, the ability for people to opt out and do their own thing is incredibly important. Um, and I think just the ability to opt out is actually one of the most powerful things because, like, when there's that release valve, there is a, like, response to overreach. There's a response to, you know, undemocratic activity, um, where people can opt out. And that mechanism, which currently doesn't exist because there's no way to opt out of existing systems, um, is the thing that keeps power in check.
