00:00:00.480 - 00:00:12.754, Speaker A: Let me ask you, before we wrap too, about like the bitcoin third places, right? We're in New York, we have pub key. There's Bitcoin park in Nashville, there's bitcoin Commons and Austin. There's one in Lisbon.
00:00:13.414 - 00:00:14.286, Speaker B: LA needs one.
00:00:14.350 - 00:00:32.854, Speaker A: Yeah. There's Bedford in the UK. Yeah, La does need one. Somebody was saying, actually on Twitter, they said, we need a bitcoin, we need a pub key in Austin. I was like, you absolutely do. I said, woke is hosting a bitcoin meetup at a bar. Bespoke is buying the bar and making every day a bitcoin meetup.
00:00:32.854 - 00:00:42.634, Speaker A: There you go. But Bedford is also one of these things now. I don't call it. I like the third place thing. Yeah.
00:00:44.294 - 00:00:48.790, Speaker B: I think of them as pilgrimages. A lot of people made that.
00:00:48.822 - 00:00:52.214, Speaker A: You really can't be a bitcoiner and have not gone to pub key in New York at this point.
