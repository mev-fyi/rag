00:00:06.800 - 00:00:10.814, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Digital trading. How you doing today, BiMnet?
00:00:10.894 - 00:00:13.878, Speaker B: It's like my Super bowl. I'm having a great day.
00:00:13.966 - 00:00:16.686, Speaker A: CPI yesterday, Fed day today.
00:00:16.790 - 00:00:24.942, Speaker B: Yeah, we got ECB and Bank of England also later this week. So this is, and there's the World cup. And there's the World cup, it's the Super bowl.
00:00:24.998 - 00:00:32.022, Speaker A: And there's been some good NFL games. Let's get past that. Tell me what the data said this week on CPI. This was on Tuesday, today's Wednesday.
00:00:32.078 - 00:01:07.888, Speaker B: That was, yeah. So basically all of the components that we wanted to see showing a deceleration in prices we saw and the big ones were things like core inflation, like the food prices, shelter was a little high, it was like 0.6 month on month. But used autos dropped a lot. Yeah. Broadly speaking, like a 0.1 month on month increase will get you there if you just keep printing 0.1.
00:01:07.888 - 00:01:10.208, Speaker B: So a lot of things were good in inflation.
00:01:10.336 - 00:01:12.008, Speaker A: It's still an increase. Right. It is.
00:01:12.056 - 00:01:24.576, Speaker B: But you want, like the Fed is targeting 2% inflation, right. They want prices to only go up by 2% a year basically. Right. So it's all about the rate of change of prices, not the absolute level.
00:01:24.680 - 00:01:30.008, Speaker A: That's interesting because we're not going to get out of this process. We're not going to get back to the prices.
00:01:30.056 - 00:01:36.408, Speaker B: No, never, never. That's never been out of the bag. Yeah. Well, that's the key thing about like inflation targeting.
00:01:36.456 - 00:01:46.536, Speaker A: Probably not our audience and a lot of finance people know this, but like, I think the general public thinks that like inflation going down will mean that we like, come back to where we were.
00:01:46.600 - 00:01:47.176, Speaker B: No, it's.
00:01:47.240 - 00:01:48.168, Speaker A: That never happens, doesn't it?
00:01:48.216 - 00:01:49.264, Speaker B: Never happens.
00:01:49.424 - 00:01:56.954, Speaker A: So we're going to. So the ideal then is a big, is what happened? A big jump up and then we hope like a flattening of inflation.
00:01:57.074 - 00:02:12.922, Speaker B: Correct. So like your apartment rent went from 2000 a month to 3000 super quickly. Right. But we want the balance of the increases to go to like 3000 to 3100, 3200 slowly. Right. And that's really what the Fed's trying to do.
00:02:12.978 - 00:02:19.794, Speaker A: And .1 would get us there is what you're saying they get. If you consistently print that's a 1.2% annual inflation.
00:02:19.874 - 00:02:20.376, Speaker B: Yes.
00:02:20.490 - 00:02:22.076, Speaker A: So zero point one's actually great.
00:02:22.220 - 00:02:25.876, Speaker B: Yes, correct. Got it. But the math is not linear like that.
00:02:25.900 - 00:02:26.036, Speaker A: But.
00:02:26.060 - 00:02:39.964, Speaker B: Yes, right, right. It's not, but. Exactly. And so the things that we know are gonna work with a lag or things like CPI. Sorry, things like shelter. Right. Like, we know that monetary policy works with a lag.
00:02:40.004 - 00:02:42.784, Speaker A: Cause that's on what, like, rents are like, longer duration.
00:02:43.444 - 00:02:47.560, Speaker B: The measure is a little bit more backward looking. Yeah. And so.
00:02:47.632 - 00:02:48.368, Speaker A: Got it.
00:02:48.536 - 00:02:54.416, Speaker B: That's why it gets tricky. So imagine, like, your lease is up, like, and you haven't renewed in like a year. Your rent's gonna jump.
00:02:54.440 - 00:02:56.312, Speaker A: Right. You're not seeing the increase yet.
00:02:56.448 - 00:02:57.192, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:02:57.368 - 00:03:01.224, Speaker A: So then, I mean, markets were up yesterday.
00:03:01.304 - 00:03:22.106, Speaker B: Yeah. No, it was a crazy, crazy market reaction. Nasdaq ripped about 4%. Front end rates rallied by 30 basis points, which is huge. I was like, my wing scenarios, like, really hawkish number, really dovish. I was anticipating 25 basis points. Maybe you get 27, but you moved 30 plus basis points.
00:03:22.106 - 00:04:11.300, Speaker B: I think at some point it was like 33 basis points in certain contracts. So it was a welcome surprise to the market. However, I would say that the price action you saw after the number came out tells you that there was a lot baked in. One of the sort of high frequency data points that we like to look at is this thing called the Adobe index. Basically, it measures trillions of data points across online retail. Basically anything you can scrape, data wise, and get yourself a feed of what's going on in prices, it looks at. And it hit a low that hadn't been seen since 2020 for the month of November, and it typically leads CPI pretty well.
00:04:11.300 - 00:05:15.884, Speaker B: So there's a lot of chatter amongst rate watchers and fed watchers that the CPI number would be flat because you had all these sales during cyber Monday. All of these good consumer good companies had huge inventories, so they wanted to offload that in the holiday season. So you had, I generally think that the whisper or the actual expectation for the number was lower than the stated Bloomberg estimates. So once you had that initial reaction, which was just buy all risk and buy bonds, it kind of came down because that was already kind of baked into the number. In addition, you know that when rates go down and stock markets rise, that is effectively a loosening of financial conditions. And the whole objective of the Fed right now is to keep financial conditions sufficiently tight for a prolonged period of time. So you know that if the Fed came out dovish today, it would have been like, game over for risk assets, right? Bonds would have gone crazy.
00:05:15.884 - 00:05:21.204, Speaker B: And so they basically couldn't have followed up a soft CPI print by sounding like dovish.
00:05:21.284 - 00:05:29.116, Speaker A: So they raised today the FOMC by 50 bps, which is a decline in the raise in the rise.
00:05:29.140 - 00:05:35.124, Speaker B: So pricing had gone to like 52, 53 going into the meeting out hawkish.
00:05:35.204 - 00:05:37.556, Speaker A: In Fed Jay Powell came out hawkish in his statements.
00:05:37.620 - 00:06:13.712, Speaker B: In his statement and in the dot plot. Mainly, it was his dot plot that was increased by 50 basis points in terms of where we're gonna get to in terminal rates. So from 4.6% to 5.1%. Right. And he stressed that it's about how long rates stay high, not really about how high rates get, which is a very important nuance. It's like the difference between 475 is not that big, but 475 or 5% for six months versus a year, that's a much more material sort of impact.
00:06:13.808 - 00:06:15.232, Speaker A: And that's what they're signaling and saying.
00:06:15.328 - 00:06:34.168, Speaker B: That's what they're signaling and saying. But the market is sniffing it out already. They see the price declines coming. You can go out on the street and see the sale signs and, you know, I don't know if people have pumped gas recently, but gas has been coming off.
00:06:34.216 - 00:06:36.272, Speaker A: I actually saw it come down meaningfully.
00:06:36.328 - 00:06:37.952, Speaker B: I think, in North Carolina or. Yeah.
00:06:37.968 - 00:06:52.960, Speaker A: Where I buy gas, it was really at like $349.90.09 or 0.99 for weeks and weeks and weeks. And now I think I saw last weekend was $3.10. I mean, that's a material decline.
00:06:53.032 - 00:06:54.496, Speaker B: That's 10%. Yeah.
00:06:54.560 - 00:07:03.130, Speaker A: And so, and it looked. It felt. Actually felt like it was still dropping because it wasn't like I had seen, like, $3.20 that was, like 315.
00:07:03.132 - 00:07:42.294, Speaker B: And couple that with the idea that prices are quick to adjust to the upside but slow to react to the downside. Right. Nobody wants to decrease their prices, but they're very happy to increase their prices, and so there's a lead lag sort of effect there. But while we're on the subject of gas, one of the hardest hit sort of price subjects was used cars. I think used car prices were down over 10% in the month of November. I might be wrong on that, but point is, it's down. It's down.
00:07:42.294 - 00:08:00.294, Speaker B: Why is that? Because it's a rate sensitive part of the market. When somebody buys a car, they typically finance a portion of it. I saw yesterday, somebody tweeted that a person with an 820 credit score, which is basically close to perfect, got quoted eight and 10% for their auto loan, which is absurd.
00:08:00.334 - 00:08:01.598, Speaker A: It's insane, right?
00:08:01.646 - 00:08:06.094, Speaker B: Versus, like, a year and a half ago. It's crazy. Zero rates. Like, you know, I remember.
00:08:06.134 - 00:08:17.478, Speaker A: Remember they were. I mean, that's what they were. I don't remember if it was a year and a half ago, but definitely during the sort of, you know, 2010 to 2020, period. I mean, there was all these advertisements for just like 0% loans, zero interest.
00:08:17.526 - 00:08:20.594, Speaker B: Rate free, and now money costs.
00:08:20.674 - 00:08:28.694, Speaker A: Money is expensive. Yeah, that's what they meant. Money was cheap. Okay, so before, one last angle here. Crypto.
00:08:29.834 - 00:09:10.288, Speaker B: We should talk about the Fed today. So the key thing that he stressed in the press conference today in the Q and a section was about employment. The labor market that we've been talking about is still incredibly tight. And basically in the summary of economic projections, the Fed said unemployment is going to get up to 4.7%. 4.7% is like, if you asked Janet Yellen a decade ago where she wanted unemployment to be and where she'd be happy about it. Yeah.
00:09:10.288 - 00:09:24.998, Speaker B: 4%. 4.5%. That's a really good level in their projections. They're telling you that, like the, like, we're gonna keep rates really tight for longer, we're gonna get inflation down. It's gonna come down. All that. And unemployment is barely gonna move higher.
00:09:25.086 - 00:09:27.886, Speaker A: It's gonna go to where they actually theoretically wanted it.
00:09:28.030 - 00:09:28.502, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:09:28.598 - 00:09:29.574, Speaker A: It's not gonna go high.
00:09:29.654 - 00:09:31.062, Speaker B: It's not gonna go high, exactly.
00:09:31.118 - 00:09:32.190, Speaker A: To what their prior target.
00:09:32.302 - 00:09:51.562, Speaker B: So soft landing is, is so in reach for the fed. Right. You've had two inflation numbers in a row, you know, sort of tell you that you're headed in the right direction and people aren't losing their jobs like crazy and price pressures are coming off. And so it's like, holy shit, this stuff is working.
00:09:51.658 - 00:09:52.098, Speaker A: Wow.
00:09:52.186 - 00:10:00.014, Speaker B: So I think there's secretly a lot of optimism. You know, if you're a fed member and you're seeing, you know, the data.
00:10:01.034 - 00:10:01.538, Speaker A: Fascinating.
00:10:01.586 - 00:10:03.810, Speaker B: Not saying this is like a huge inflection point paradigm.
00:10:03.842 - 00:10:10.254, Speaker A: No, totally. But it's like the soft landing pop probability is saying it's increasing. It's increasing.
00:10:10.374 - 00:10:10.814, Speaker B: Correct.
00:10:10.894 - 00:10:18.854, Speaker A: And it had at some points been, I think, panned by all commentators is like virtually impossible. So it's no longer impossible in your mind.
00:10:18.974 - 00:10:19.318, Speaker B: Correct.
00:10:19.366 - 00:10:20.030, Speaker A: It is possible.
00:10:20.142 - 00:10:20.838, Speaker B: It is possible.
00:10:20.926 - 00:10:50.778, Speaker A: Interesting. And then, okay, so crypto prices, bitcoin traded up over 18k for the first time. And frankly, it might even be months, I can't recall, but certainly many weeks. ETH was over 1300. I think it's audience can see the block clock next to me showing 17 eight is the current bitcoin price. But that was a risk on reaction to this news and frankly, mostly unmoved, I would say, today by the Fed, but buoyed yesterday by the CPI. Maybe just down ever so slightly with the Fed.
00:10:50.826 - 00:11:24.536, Speaker B: But yeah, no, I mean, it's a market that really moves at the margin now. Right. So you've got the landscape of liquid crypto investors is there's the long, only structural. I'm here for ten years, 20 years forever. I'm a hodler. There are those types and then there are the speculators that come into the market. I would say in terms of the speculators that are left and remaining in the market, there's just very few sellers.
00:11:24.536 - 00:11:57.162, Speaker B: People's positions have been right sized by the fact that the market has moved a lot lower. There was a lot of forced selling that's gone through in the market. And so that just leaves you with a setup where there's room for a lot of folks to add to risk and they're already at very low risk numbers. So it just leads to marginal buy pressure when you have good news, like inflation coming down or good news, a less hawkish fed. Right. And so, yeah, you know, is that.
00:11:57.218 - 00:11:59.866, Speaker A: Yeah, it just updated 17 698.
00:11:59.930 - 00:12:01.426, Speaker B: This is the wrong direction. I know.
00:12:01.450 - 00:12:23.294, Speaker A: It's going down the block. Clock updates every time a bitcoin block is mined. So it can be a little bit variable, but on about average, every ten minutes. Yeah. So it sounds like we're still sort of in that spot we've been in. We moved a bit higher than we were, say, a couple of weeks ago, certainly. But still you see a lack of upside, catalyst and also a lack of remaining four sellers sort of keeping us in this range.
00:12:23.374 - 00:12:33.678, Speaker B: Yeah, range bound is like. We did hear some news that there's going to be a ETF launched in Hong Kong that's futures based.
00:12:33.766 - 00:12:34.634, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:12:35.054 - 00:12:42.934, Speaker B: I think that can be a reasonable catalyst in the context of it's a product.
00:12:43.014 - 00:12:45.550, Speaker A: This is the first they would have out there on traditional markets.
00:12:45.622 - 00:13:11.494, Speaker B: Yes. This is obviously a very different market than when the bitcoin ETF launched here in the US. Yeah. The proshares futures based one, the bito ETF. It's a very different market. At the same time, though, it's very dangerous to short crypto and it's a new product. I would think there's going to be much more buyers than sellers of said product.
00:13:11.494 - 00:13:16.004, Speaker B: But again, yeah, it is something.
00:13:16.044 - 00:13:17.504, Speaker A: The market continues to mature.
00:13:17.804 - 00:13:18.452, Speaker B: Absolutely.
