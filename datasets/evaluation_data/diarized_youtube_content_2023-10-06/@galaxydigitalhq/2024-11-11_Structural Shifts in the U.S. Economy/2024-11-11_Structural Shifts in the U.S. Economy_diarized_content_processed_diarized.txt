00:00:00.280 - 00:00:00.848, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:00.889 - 00:00:16.885, Speaker A: And you just can't underscore, like, the huge structural things that are happening in the US Economy right now. You, you are at the crux of, you know, an AI boom in the US that requires, you know, massive, like, power investment.
00:00:17.305 - 00:00:24.953, Speaker B: Trump said, we're going to build so much electricity, you're going to say, please, sir, no more electricity, please, sir. But I mean, that's, that's. They're going to build electricity. They're going.
00:00:25.009 - 00:00:25.849, Speaker A: They have to.
00:00:25.937 - 00:00:26.233, Speaker B: Right.
00:00:26.289 - 00:00:27.097, Speaker A: And yeah.
00:00:27.121 - 00:00:30.617, Speaker B: It'S not just the AI that does well, it's all the builders and the whatever.
00:00:30.721 - 00:00:45.405, Speaker A: And then it's like, do you get efficiency? Do you become a more productive economy because of the efficiencies that AI has? And so we're going through a big structural change in the US that's very pro growth and pro.
00:00:45.445 - 00:00:46.305, Speaker B: Cyclical.
00:00:46.765 - 00:00:51.309, Speaker A: And so when you couple that with the debt, though.
00:00:51.397 - 00:00:54.285, Speaker B: Yeah, the debt, though. It's like, whoa, man.
00:00:54.365 - 00:00:56.525, Speaker A: I mean, it's really tough to ignore.
