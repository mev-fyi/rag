00:00:02.440 - 00:00:30.782, Speaker A: We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard. Because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills. Because that challenge is one that we're willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win and the others do.
00:00:30.878 - 00:01:36.336, Speaker B: Welcome to Galaxy, galaxy brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. Yo, I'm back on the track with another sick verse occupy Wall street with a thick purse intangible coins in my wallet till it bursts haters always clueless while I be staying buddhist I'm thumbing through the filings like my name was Bow Tunis I'm the truest, never new to this game cause I'm fluent when I do this in the lab I stack facts but y'all truants y'all blew it only chance will fall through it don't look too good cause I'm sick but y'all flewish I blew quick so fast I leave you with the blur and haters getting served by my my homie Steve Kurz. Yo, I roll with DEET nerds and shadowy supercoders it's over, dog, I'm pushing weight like bulldozers all these kittens everywhere while we be the goats and the new kid on the block is called BTCO. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmware research at Galaxy. Thank you for listening to Galaxy Brains. Welcome back 2024, a new year and a great episode. Eric Balchunis, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, is our guest, and he is joined by by Steve Kurz, head of Galaxy Asset Management.
00:01:36.336 - 00:02:16.144, Speaker B: And of course, we'll check in with our good friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading, as always. But before we get to all of that, I need to remind you to please refer to link to disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Ten years in the making and we finally have spot based bitcoin ETF's trading on us exchanges. What a milestone. I promise you, it is about to get weird out here in tradfi and crypto. This is an earth shattering development in my opinion, and things will never, ever look the same. Let's get right into it with Bim Netabeebee from Galaxy trading.
00:02:16.144 - 00:02:23.244, Speaker B: Let's go now to our friend Bim Netabeebe from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnett. Welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:02:23.324 - 00:02:24.396, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:02:24.540 - 00:02:37.920, Speaker B: Wow. Ten years in the making. Bitcoin ETF's approved. If you're listening to this, on Thursday, January 11, they launched today at 09:30 a.m. For trading. Um, was it a sell the news event? I didn't. Over my shoulder.
00:02:37.920 - 00:02:41.440, Speaker B: I mean, we're recording. What's Wednesday night? It's flat.
00:02:41.592 - 00:02:53.368, Speaker C: It's flat. Yeah. I would just say there's a lot of uncertainty surrounding day one flows with respect to will inflows, outpace outflows of, you know, of things like, you know, grayscale.
00:02:53.456 - 00:02:53.776, Speaker B: Right.
00:02:53.840 - 00:03:35.004, Speaker C: Um, there's $28 billion of grayscale, um, that's been in probably on average, at a much lower cost basis than here. The discount is likely to close. I mean, it gapped higher close today on the approval. On the approval. And there's been a lot of folks waiting to take profit on bitcoin, waiting for the CTF News. And so I think it's possible that you go down, but I think it's likely that you go up and this is an asset that's asymmetric to the upside in terms of, you know, it's risk profile and you can go to zero, but you could also go to, like, 200,000. Right.
00:03:35.004 - 00:03:37.460, Speaker C: So, you know, you can at most lose 100%.
00:03:37.572 - 00:03:39.172, Speaker B: Right. But I don't think you could go to zero.
00:03:39.228 - 00:04:17.576, Speaker C: No, you're not. If we didn't go last year, if you're thinking about bitcoin as an asset that's floored at now, let's say 30, you're trading at 46, and you think that there's a positive supply catalyst coming with the happening turn in Fed policy, et cetera, you could be looking at an asset that could easily be worth one hundred k. I think that's well within a year. If you're talking about an asset that's got a downside of 10,000 versus an upside of 54,000, that seems like good five to one risk reward trade right there. And it's now going to come in a form that's incredibly easy to access.
00:04:17.680 - 00:04:18.640, Speaker B: So easy.
00:04:18.832 - 00:05:00.374, Speaker C: And just for what it's worth, you're going to be able to get margin on it, day one for the most part. And so there's going to be a lot of, like, cheap money that's going to flow into crypto as a function of folks getting financing on a lot of these ETF products. And so there's a lot of cash coming in a lot of new institutions that now have access to it, you know, millions and millions, tens of millions of retirement accounts and, you know, other investment vehicles that will now have cheap access to bitcoin. And so I think the potential is not infinite, but to the moon does come to mind, let's put it that way.
00:05:00.414 - 00:05:09.846, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, you heard the intro rap. We had JFK, former president, talking about going to the moon. There was a reason for that choice in that vein.
00:05:09.950 - 00:05:34.536, Speaker C: It is not what bitcoin can do for crypto, but it is what you can do for crypto. I just tried to make something cool there, but I just do want to highlight the fact that alts are ripping higher on the back of this announcement. We've had ETH, you know, trade up to, you know, I guess, 2500 and change. Let's talk about ETH real quick. Outperformed a ton as well.
00:05:34.600 - 00:06:04.802, Speaker B: I've been very critical of the ETH BTC rally we've seen over the last couple days. Our clients and counterparties will know that. I've tweeted about it before as well. I'm of the belief that ETH BTC should go lower before it eventually maybe goes higher. You do have ETH ETF applications that have been filed. I think the earliest final approved deny date on their 19 B four s is in May. The logic being from the perspective issuers, that they also have CME futures.
00:06:04.802 - 00:06:14.002, Speaker B: And so futures like spot, you look at the grayscale rolling, right, that it should be a similar analysis ultimately from the SEC, but that's a long ways away. That's five months from now.
00:06:14.178 - 00:06:20.876, Speaker C: Yeah, I just look at it from the positioning standpoint. Everybody's positioned in bitcoin and not really that position for ETH upside.
00:06:20.940 - 00:06:21.924, Speaker B: So there's a catch up trade.
00:06:21.964 - 00:06:33.396, Speaker C: There's a catch up trade, and it's also just like folks looking to take profit on bitcoin, like, what's the next available trade? You look at a cross that's down over 20% on the year.
00:06:33.500 - 00:07:07.574, Speaker B: And I'm of a view that, that. I agree with that. But I think going forward, where we believe a lot of allocation in bitcoin will be through these ETF vehicles, that inter crypto cyclicality should dampen, particularly before the ETH ETF launches. Right. Because if we believe there's a lot of financial advisor allocation coming, which is the target audience for these ETF's, we've written a report. We believe that. I believe that that's not sitting on polo or a crypto exchange ready to go into the next into ETH and then into alts.
00:07:07.574 - 00:07:29.190, Speaker B: Right. It's stuck in the eTF's. So the rotation trade, I think it can still happen now because the money's not in the ETF's yet. As we record this, certainly like this time, there's still that rotation. You can see it happening. I mean, yesterday when the fake compromise tweet came out from the SEC, there was a rotation into ETH overnight. Like it was a notable one.
00:07:29.190 - 00:07:36.302, Speaker B: But that should dampen over time, in my opinion, because financial advisors are longer term allocators and stuff. I don't know, it's been part of.
00:07:36.318 - 00:07:45.406, Speaker C: My thesis on ETH. You know, ETH is going to be a healthy part of any crypto portfolio. A 5% allocation, a 10% allocation in crypto.
00:07:45.470 - 00:07:47.290, Speaker B: Yeah, or higher. Or higher.
00:07:47.362 - 00:08:01.434, Speaker C: Or higher. As more and more people get exposed to the idea that I need crypto in my portfolio, I need crypto in my portfolio because it's a risk diversifier and a performance enhancer. It's tough to ignore ETH, especially once.
00:08:01.474 - 00:08:05.378, Speaker B: You get an ETF and it's meaningfully different from bitcoin. So it's reasonable.
00:08:05.466 - 00:08:43.928, Speaker C: And so it's just like higher beta, lower market cap. And so I definitely, I see it both ways fundamentally. Like, I agree with the macro thesis behind bitcoin more. And, and so I would obviously like to see bitcoin outperform, but I think it's one of those things. You just got to own both. And in terms of alt exposure as well, I think there's just going to be so many new institutions that are interacting with crypto that are going to understand it better and the education that goes on after. I think this is really a seminal moment for bitcoin, the crossing of the Rubicon, however you want to think about it.
00:08:43.928 - 00:08:47.048, Speaker C: But from this point forward, the world will be different.
00:08:47.176 - 00:08:55.264, Speaker B: Okay, before we break, CPI is tomorrow and Thursday again, January 11. What are you thinking about? What are you expecting for CPI?
00:08:55.344 - 00:09:15.568, Speaker C: Yeah, you know, I want to see. It does matter because there's a lot baked into markets in terms of interest rate cut expectations that are priced out to this year. And so I think the risks to the number are asymmetric in the sense that if it comes in higher than expected that some of this market pricing might fade.
00:09:15.696 - 00:09:19.072, Speaker B: But in terms of goes later, the cuts go later in the year or.
00:09:19.208 - 00:10:10.354, Speaker C: Less magnitude less magnitude, but both, and it's tough to price in more cuts, in my opinion. Therefore, a softer CPI print is not really going to do too much for markets, but high level. What I'm looking at is owner's equivalent rent. We've been expecting it to come down meaningfully over the next handful of months as a function of more supply of apartments hitting the market, as a function of vacancy rates also ticking up. And just as the real time indicators for rents have been ticking down versus the owner's equivalent rent metric has been a little bit stickier because of how they calculate the numbers. So expecting a little bit more catch up there and then in things like used autos, I'm thinking there's going to be some weakness. Airline fares, you know, things alike, should see some declines.
00:10:10.354 - 00:10:27.126, Speaker C: But in terms of what I'm focused on in inflation, in terms of stuff that might alter people's views, is this freight issue right now, with all the conflicts we're having in the Red Sea and how much in terms of freight supplies, not getting ducts, that's among the.
00:10:27.150 - 00:10:31.446, Speaker B: Biggest risks for inflation, right. Is the geopolitical supply chain stuff.
00:10:31.590 - 00:10:58.848, Speaker C: Supply chain stuff is huge. And then oil is trading really well, $73 barrel on WTI crude oil. Gas prices have come off a lot off the highs. And so that's been a positive sort of development. But again, what I'm more worried about is stock market's almost at the dead highs. Crypto is back to the dead highs. Property values with interest rates going down are still relatively firm.
00:10:58.848 - 00:11:35.310, Speaker C: And so I think the market is still underappreciating the risk of reinflation. But all of the indicators we're looking at in terms of manufacturing sentiment surveys, employment data, they're all pointing towards a slowdown in the economy and a slowdown in headline inflation and a slowdown in core PCE, the Fed's preferred measure. And so that's kind of why you're seeing all of these interest rate cuts priced in, in addition to the Fed taking a more dovish stance and a more precautionary stance. And so there are things that can counter that view, and a high CPI print is one of them. And so that's kind of what I'm focused on, is a risk to the.
00:11:35.342 - 00:11:37.750, Speaker B: Market, more risk on a high print than a correct.
00:11:37.822 - 00:11:55.630, Speaker C: And then the other sort of big development this week was the back and forth we've had on the Fed's balance sheet. So right now they're running off the Fed's balance sheet. Right. But you're kind of getting to the point where you might want to consider stopping. In addition, it doesn't make sense to be tightening policy with the balance sheet and easing policy on interest rates.
00:11:55.662 - 00:11:58.358, Speaker B: Kind of negating yourself, right? Unified front.
00:11:58.446 - 00:12:26.238, Speaker C: Correct. And so Lori Logan, who's the head of the Dallas Fed, who used to be a member of the New York Fed, which knows all the plumbing, came out this on Friday, being like, oh, it might be time to stop this quantitative tightening or taper it. And then Williams today was like, you know, it might still be appropriate to engage. And so there's a little bit of a back and forth. And then we just still have to deal with this ongoing fiscal, like, over exuberance. The government spends just so much.
00:12:26.286 - 00:12:33.294, Speaker B: All right, we're going to get to the government. Let's save it for another one. Pimnett, thank you so much. It's an exciting time in this.
00:12:33.334 - 00:12:34.414, Speaker C: I'm so excited, guys.
00:12:34.494 - 00:12:39.822, Speaker B: Truly an amazing. We're excited. Well, that's it. Bem netabeebeebeebe from Galaxy Trading, thank you so much.
00:12:39.878 - 00:12:40.594, Speaker C: Pleasure.
00:12:41.374 - 00:12:47.714, Speaker B: Let's go now to our guest, Eric Balchunis, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Eric, thank you so much for coming on. Galaxy brains.
00:12:48.574 - 00:12:49.862, Speaker A: Great to be with you, Alex.
00:12:49.958 - 00:12:58.794, Speaker B: So I was joking with Eric. Eric's going to get his own rap. But actually, if you're listening to this episode now, you already heard it. I know you play the guitar, right?
00:12:59.974 - 00:13:15.934, Speaker A: I do. I play like a decent rhythm guitar. I suck at singing. My wife, she almost bands it, but I'm allowed to play guitar. I'm pretty good. I played a lot more, like back in the day, but I still pick it up now and then. I have an electric and acoustic and it's fun.
00:13:15.934 - 00:13:19.598, Speaker A: It's just like, I like playing like obscure indie rock songs.
00:13:19.686 - 00:13:20.094, Speaker B: Love it.
00:13:20.134 - 00:13:29.038, Speaker A: So sometimes I'll still hear a song and I'm like, you know what? I gotta play that. And I'll just send a Siri message to myself and I'll download the tablature and just jam it out. And it's a good time.
00:13:29.126 - 00:13:37.274, Speaker B: We're gonna. Next time I'm up at Bloomberg HQ, we'll get James, we'll get, we'll get Chanali Basak in there and Matt and all the. We'll do some kind of collab.
00:13:37.814 - 00:13:38.554, Speaker A: Sure.
00:13:38.854 - 00:13:44.714, Speaker B: Will they let me bring the guitar through security in that building? I don't know. They're going to be surprised. They're going to worry like it's the movie Desperado or something.
00:13:45.174 - 00:13:55.874, Speaker A: Well, back when Charlie Rose was here, I think they were liberal with, there'd be musicians coming in regularly. But I don't know, these days you might have to check that at the door or at least scan it or something.
00:13:56.174 - 00:14:17.824, Speaker B: So obviously for our audience, Eric has been covering the bitcoin ETF race, the coin Tucky derby, you've called it, among other you and other folks. It really has shaped up to be like that. Um, these things are launching. They're launching now. Finally. It's been ten years since the Winklevosses filed their first application for one. Is that a big milestone in your mind?
00:14:18.924 - 00:14:50.740, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean this was a, the first ETF ever spy, which, when I wrote my first book on ETF's, I was writing about how Spy took four and a half years between the concept and the SEC approval. This is literally double that, plus an extra year for good measure. So nothing has been like this. And spy was the first of its kind. This is obviously a traditional 33 act ETF, but the asset class is the issue. And this has been really tough road. I thought they should approve them right from the get go.
00:14:50.740 - 00:15:10.212, Speaker A: I'm a big fan of ETF's. I think they give the investors the fairest shake. They put a lot of great market makers to work on the investor behalf. They've worked in other asset classes, bonds, even junk bonds, they work well. I know this will work fine. They've worked in Canada, they've worked in other countries. They've been around for seven years in other countries.
00:15:10.212 - 00:15:36.108, Speaker A: So this should have happened a long time ago. So I've been pretty rah rah about it. But when it comes to our covering it this year, we just want to be right. And there was a couple milestones along the way where we kept upping our odds and we saw really good signs and it's nice to be vindicated. We put our necks out a little bit earlier on. Now I was like, we were 90% oz before it was cool. It was a little harder.
00:15:36.108 - 00:15:51.652, Speaker A: Yeah. Then it sort of seemed obvious. We got coverage from other mainstream media who got their own sourcing and basically found the same thing. So it's great, it's a relief. It's been a fun ride and looking forward to see the actual derby itself now play out.
00:15:51.828 - 00:16:25.964, Speaker B: Yeah, let's talk about it. I mean, you've got, I think in James safe arts grid, he's got eleven issuers, if I count them correctly. Uh, issuers. Um, and gosh, that's a lot for day one. Before we get into the, the, some differentiation between them, and there certainly has been, we'll talk about the fee war that's occurred even before they launch. Um, you know, how many just without saying who or anything, you know, eleven can't possibly exist with, with, you know, notable aum. Let's fast forward a year, maybe one year from today.
00:16:25.964 - 00:16:31.904, Speaker B: I'm not going to set a threshold, but how many you think have, like, notable aum a year from now?
00:16:32.524 - 00:17:14.104, Speaker A: Okay, so I kind of divide ETF's into three categories, studs, the middle class, and like, borderline liquidation. So I think we'll have one giant stud, then a sizable stud, and then a big, thick middle class. So middle class would be 100 million to a billion. You might have three studs, but only one can be a liquidity stud, though. And that's the holy grail, because if you get that liquidity around, you become the GLD of the bitcoin. ETF's, liquidity begets liquidity, and that is when the big fish bite and use you like the institutional investors. That's what everybody is aiming for.
00:17:14.104 - 00:17:41.429, Speaker A: That said, a lot of people will get theirs, a lot of people will make a profit, but there'll be one or two sad cases that just can't get going and probably have to close. This is just the way the ETF market works. Now. How much room is there? Depends. There's 100 tech ETF's, and tech is just one sector. If this area can get enough assets, certainly there's room for eleven. Depends how quick the asset gathering can get going.
00:17:41.429 - 00:18:15.882, Speaker A: But I find that a lot of these firms have their own audiences, so if they can, like, at least secure their own audience and clients to use their own fund, that should give them life for a while. But I've seen cases where an ETF hangs around for four or five years before it actually starts getting going. So I think these issuers should really just relax, look at the long game. But in the early week or two, it will be crucial to find out where the volume is going, and that will probably form within a couple of weeks. But that doesn't mean everybody else is dead.
00:18:15.998 - 00:18:32.774, Speaker B: Yeah, interesting. There is the fee war. I know, fees, maybe you talked about liquidity. Before we get into the specific war, what are the factors in your mind, if you're buying an ETF that you really care about? You mentioned liquidity, clearly. That's one.
00:18:33.434 - 00:19:00.104, Speaker A: Yeah. It depends what your goal is. If you're trading it like an institution getting quick exposure, or if it's a portfolio completion, if you're doing serious business, you're a serious investor. Liquidity is big, I got to be honest. For advisors who are going long term, they like things like they do like fees, they like brand, they're loyal to brands. They like bigger brands traditionally, but of course, the exposure matters, but these are all sort of the same. So they will look to fee brand.
00:19:00.104 - 00:19:32.546, Speaker A: They'll look at, like, how well it tracks to a degree. They'll look if there's any tax considerations, although, again, a lot of everybody is on the same playing level playing field with that, too. And so that's sort of what it'll come down to. And I think marketing in this case, I think if you. You could probably break through if you're, you know, you can actually market your way, I think, to some assets, if you can capture their imagination, and there's a couple of ways to do that. And some things will work, some things won't. But I would say that's what matters to advisors.
00:19:32.546 - 00:20:06.530, Speaker A: The longer you go in for, the more fee should probably matter, because obviously, that's an annual fee. The shorter you're going in, the more spreads should matter. Hence the liquid ones being used by the more short term, bigger investors. But I imagine the spreads on the biggest, four or five of them should be one or two basis points, which is beautiful, because compare that to the Coinbase commission. Then you get down to the other ones. They'll be a little wider, but if you call the market maker, you could probably get a tighter spread, but they will probably show on the screen a little wider. But the volume ones will show one to two basis points, which, again, is beautiful.
00:20:06.672 - 00:20:27.710, Speaker B: So do you guys have any estimate? I mean, I know we published one. I saw standard Chartered with their extremely bullish estimate. I thought much higher than where we landed. What's your estimate on flows? I don't know. Over whatever time period you've made it on inflows, we'll call it net inflows. You don't have to do, like, total aum. Obviously, for this analysis, grayscale's existing aum kind of, like, complicates the number.
00:20:27.710 - 00:20:34.074, Speaker B: But if we just say, like, net new into the ETF complex, what do you have for an estimate?
00:20:34.794 - 00:21:03.770, Speaker A: Yeah, people mix up flows and assets all the time. Flows are hard. They're actually new dollars. So if we focus on flows, we're looking at maybe 15 billion in the first year. We'll call it by the end of this year, because it's a year anyway. We're at the beginning of a year, so by the end of this year, I could see 15 billion ish inflows, but that puts us at 50 billion ish at assets, 45 billion. Because if you have grayscale converting at 30, maybe they lose a little.
00:21:03.770 - 00:21:44.498, Speaker A: But then Blackrock and seed capital comes in, I could see 40 to 50 by the end of the year in assets. Then if the price of bitcoin goes up, that my number would be revised up. If the price of bitcoin goes down, I'd revise down because the price of the underlying impacts the asset figure. So I really think flows, if we're going to analyze who's winning and losing, who's getting the hard work of getting new clients in there, that's the key number to watch flows in volume. So those are my estimates. If we want to go out to four or five years, I could see that flow number increasing to like 40, 50 to get us to about 100 billion of a category. That's where gold is, and that would be about 1% of ETF assets.
00:21:44.498 - 00:22:12.242, Speaker A: So that while 100 billion, it depends on where you're coming from. From a bitcoiner, that's a ton of money. ETF roll only 1%. But for a new asset class to get into one to get 1% of assets that quickly is really big feed. So it's all relative, of course. But still, at the end of the day, these advisors, who these are aimed at, they really love their 60 40. They're not going to like, sell all that and like go orange pill full.
00:22:12.242 - 00:22:52.896, Speaker A: In my opinion. This will be like a hot sauce bucket application where, you know, oh, I got a little arc, I got a thematic ETF, got this real estate venture. Just some stuff that you speculate with that spices up the otherwise boring low cost 60 40 that they really just are told. And all the evidence is you have to just wait 20 years before the compounding kicks in, where you get the magic of compounding return. So a lot of people love that, but they're a little bored. I think crypto is going to satisfy this sort of excitement factor, roe return entertainment and cure a little fomo. So I see it as a hot sauce bucket allocation, rather, for the advisor.
00:22:52.896 - 00:23:02.936, Speaker A: But again, they have 30 trillion. So if they all did 1%, that's 300 billion. But I don't, again, I'm looking more at maybe a third of those people do. 1%.
00:23:03.080 - 00:23:20.680, Speaker B: Yep. That makes a lot of sense. I love your Roe return on entertainment. I think it makes sense a lot if you manage matters. Yeah. And if you manage a lot of end client advised portfolios and you're mostly in some model portfolio type allocations, to distinguish yourself, say, like, look, you're going to. Yeah, you're going to be.
00:23:20.680 - 00:23:57.052, Speaker B: You're actually going to be 45, 55, instead of 60, 40 or, sorry, 35, 55. And with that other 10%, one of our guys on our advisor team, they got a real estate background, we got a former venture guy. We're going to do a little bit more interesting stuff. And by the way, we're going to stick some bitcoin in there too, because the returns historically have been really beneficial. I think that's actually quite compelling, especially just to distinguish yourself if you're an advisor among the others. What would be like, everyone's asking the short term thing in the first week or so, let's say week. We're not going to say day.
00:23:57.052 - 00:24:25.492, Speaker B: I mean, it's the end of the week already, but let's say in the first week. We're probably not getting tons of advisor flows in the first week. I would assume it's mostly high net worth or retail in general. I'm assuming these ETF's are going to show up on all the major brokerage platforms for traditional, the fidelities and schwabs and e trades and whatever. They'll be there. But to get on the advisor platforms will take probably a little bit longer. Bito had a billion in like the first couple days.
00:24:25.492 - 00:24:41.504, Speaker B: The bito, the cash shuttle future. I mean, is there a number that would either tell you in the first week, I'm gonna give you a little bit of an out here in the first short time period that it's a smash hit or a big failure. Like, is there a threshold there in your mind where you're like, holy crap, in either direction?
00:24:42.204 - 00:25:06.056, Speaker A: Yeah, this where it gets complicated. There's two types of flows. There's organic and BYOA. Byoa flows are bring your own assets. That's when somebody lines up somebody. So Blackrock has done this BYOA move a lot where they'll line up a billion or two. And instead of launching with that seed already in, they actually wait till the first day and have it come in so it registers as flows in volume.
00:25:06.056 - 00:25:25.020, Speaker A: So if you look at the top most successful ETF's of day one, Blackrock's like six out of the top ten, including two of the top three. Lot of their ESG funds they did this with. And I don't count that as organic, so it matters. They still make the list. But then I go down and look what's the most popular organic. So LQD was a big organic hit. That's the first bond.
00:25:25.020 - 00:25:57.254, Speaker A: ETF and Bitto was a big organic hit at I think 500 million inflows the first day and a billion in two days. Which broke GLD's all time record of three days organic. So what I would do on day one is I think that Blackrock will break the all time record. If I'm hearing the rumors correctly, they've lined up about 2 billion. That's what I heard. I will see that would be automatically make them the number one. But the question is how much outside of the Blackrock seed is grassroots interest.
00:25:57.254 - 00:26:16.510, Speaker A: And James and I have done this so long that there's an art to it. We'll be able to suss out what's grassroots versus BYOA, and we'll report those numbers on. I would like to see 500 million in going the first day or two or maybe three days of organic to be like, this is a smash hit.
00:26:16.622 - 00:26:17.078, Speaker B: Got it.
00:26:17.126 - 00:26:22.034, Speaker A: Over 100 million. Respectable. Under 100 million. Grassroots. Little floppish.
00:26:22.414 - 00:26:22.926, Speaker C: Got it.
00:26:22.950 - 00:26:32.658, Speaker B: Yeah. That's good to know. Yeah. I'm not asking for any hard prediction, but I like to know what sort of those ranges under 100 million in your eyebrows are raising and. And the story doesn't look positive to you, basically.
00:26:32.706 - 00:27:02.456, Speaker A: But keep in mind, though, if you launched, I don't know, a thematic ETF today, I would say you'd be a success if you get 100 million a year, and I'd be a success if you got a million dollars in a day. A million. So I'm raising the bar way above normalcy here because of the hype. So that's bitcoin, that said. Yeah. That said, you have to factor the hype in here. So 100 million amongst the group would be solid if it was anything else.
00:27:02.456 - 00:27:31.074, Speaker A: But because of the hype, I'm using a higher standard. But I'm also not going to use Bito because I think Bito launched right into a mania of October 2021 where everybody's friends and families were asking about this. That is kind of over. We're more in, like, a new phase of this, and I don't find there's a frothing at the mouth retail fomo mania going on. So I don't see a lot of bito grassroots. I think Bito will hold its record now. If we take the whole group of them, maybe they'll come close to Bito.
00:27:31.074 - 00:27:32.810, Speaker A: I don't know that. That'll be interesting.
00:27:32.922 - 00:27:40.442, Speaker B: Yeah, there weren't. There weren't. I think Beto launched by itself, or maybe there's one other. Within a couple of days, there were some fast followers by itself. Yeah.
00:27:40.458 - 00:27:42.834, Speaker A: So I think it had a weak head start on Valkyrie.
00:27:42.914 - 00:27:43.186, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:27:43.210 - 00:27:48.602, Speaker A: Which, by the way, to this day still has 95% of all the volume. That's what the SC was trying to not do here.
00:27:48.698 - 00:28:19.544, Speaker B: Yeah. And so right now you're dividing it among eleven or eight or however many launch. And so that's going to spread it out a bit. This has been fast. I got to ask you, Eric, on Tuesday, there was a tweet from the securities and Exchange Commission account that said they had approved all. They'd approved bitcoin ETF's to list on, quote, all national securities exchanges. And they had a graphic with a quote from supposedly, of course, a quote from chair Gary Gensler and his picture.
00:28:19.544 - 00:28:46.360, Speaker B: The market assumed this was approval, but of course, then the chair came and replied, or tweeted that the SEC's account on X had been hacked or I should say had been compromised. This caused wild volatility in bitcoin price. I mean, bitcoin was up in the 48s, then it was down in the low forty five s. I don't know. What was your reaction to that? Has anything ever happened like that at the SEC? I mean, I've never seen anything like that happen at the government.
00:28:46.432 - 00:28:57.688, Speaker A: No, no. I was shocked. I thought. My thought was that they were just like, hey, let's be cool and give everybody, like, it's almost like giving your kids a Christmas present on Christmas Eve.
00:28:57.776 - 00:28:58.804, Speaker B: Do it a little early.
00:28:59.464 - 00:29:37.194, Speaker A: Yeah. I thought that was a nice gesture. Let's all party. And then the formality will be just like, documents, rather than waiting for, like, the official document. I thought that that was cool, but I also thought it's weird they did it because I was expecting everything to be announced for at the exact same time the next day. That's what I'd heard. So that's why I thought when they said it was compromised, that, I don't know, maybe they're just embarrassed and it was a scheduled tweet or in the drafts folder, and the hacker just tweeted it out because the way they wrote about it and the graphics they used was very, very close to SEC speak.
00:29:37.194 - 00:30:08.574, Speaker A: And if you were going to hack it for, like, max impact, like a Bond villain, you would do rejection, right? That would be like Bond villain or Joker level. Like mass chaos. Like, doing an approval is child's play in terms of what's your goal here? To have fun and, like, wreck everything. So there's a lot of questions here. I still think the SEC had the tweet planned or something. Like, I think it might have been written by them somehow, but pushed out early. That's my hunch here.
00:30:08.574 - 00:30:12.554, Speaker A: I guess we'll find out as it plays out. But, yeah, there's going to be some investigations.
00:30:13.134 - 00:30:35.014, Speaker B: They have. The senators, Vance and Tillis, are calling for an investigation. They wrote a pretty direct letter to the securities and Exchange Commission demanding an explanation. The SEC, I think, has said they'll work with law enforcement to figure it out. I'm of the view that it is a pro bitcoin external hacker, because they. Yeah, it was close. It was close to looking like an SEC thing, but it wasn't exactly.
00:30:35.014 - 00:30:49.314, Speaker B: And then when you actually really start to interrogate the language, I think it's a little strange. They wouldn't say an all national registered securities exchanges. It doesn't really. And then they, they had another tweet. Did you see that? They tweeted BTC dollar sign and deleted it. And there were some likes on.
00:30:50.374 - 00:30:57.558, Speaker A: Yes. Yeah, that's where I thought, okay, well, somebody hacked them, but then maybe they found the draft folder.
00:30:57.646 - 00:30:58.070, Speaker B: This is why.
00:30:58.102 - 00:31:00.982, Speaker A: Either way, I think it's like a.
00:31:00.998 - 00:31:10.714, Speaker B: Chaotic bitcoin hacker who's probably. That's why they didn't do the, the rejection, because in the end, I think there's four bitcoins. Crash it. I'm making.
00:31:12.134 - 00:31:22.950, Speaker A: Yeah, no, no, you could be right. I think the, either way, I mean, the Sec. This is a bad, look, this has nothing to do with what's going on.
00:31:22.982 - 00:31:23.310, Speaker B: They've done.
00:31:23.342 - 00:31:44.284, Speaker A: I thought the SEC has done a great job getting these documents in order. The poor staff has done work tirelessly for, like, three weeks through the holidays. And, like, this kind of, like, stains all their work because I look at the amendments. This is boring legal technical crap, man. And, like, painstaking. They've got to print these 150 page documents out. Probably get a highlighter.
00:31:44.284 - 00:31:54.948, Speaker A: This, this, this. I mean, I've edited two books that I myself, that I've written. It's painful. I got through five, six drafts. You got to print it out. It sucks. That's the worst part of writing a book, is.
00:31:54.948 - 00:31:57.310, Speaker A: Is printing it out, editing it, putting edits in.
00:31:57.412 - 00:31:57.674, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:57.714 - 00:32:21.666, Speaker A: So I don't know. I want to give the staff and everybody else credit, and this shouldn't overshadow it. This is something to do with some kind of goof. And it is kind of hypocritical, because if you're the SEC, and especially that they were concerned about fraud and manipulation. Bitcoin. Well, what about your own, your own house is a little bit of a mess there. But, yeah, I sort of just want to, like, just hopefully we can just laugh at it like the cointelegraph intern at some point.
00:32:21.770 - 00:32:48.026, Speaker B: Yeah, hopefully. I think we've gotten through it. And you're right, there's some irony, because the SEC had advanced a cyber rule, they call it on cybersecurity. And Congress is apparently considering using the Congressional Review act to nullify it separate from this. So, hey, it's been an exciting time. I know my audience almost certainly follows Eric already, but check him out on Twitter. He and his colleague James Safart have covered this commendably.
00:32:48.026 - 00:33:01.534, Speaker B: It's not just the SEC that maybe you don't have to edit them, Eric, but you guys are. You're all over that Edgar database for us in the industry and really appreciate your work. And, dude, thank you for coming on Galaxy brains. Next time we got to jam out.
00:33:04.354 - 00:33:11.346, Speaker A: I'll bring my acoustic guitar. You can do the heavy lifting and the singing. But, yeah, it was great to talk to you and, yeah, exciting times.
00:33:11.490 - 00:33:21.714, Speaker B: Awesome. Eric Balchunis, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Thanks for coming on galaxy brains. Let's go now to our guest, Steve Kurtz, head of Galaxy Asset management. Steve, welcome back to Galaxy Brains.
00:33:21.794 - 00:33:23.322, Speaker D: It's awesome to be here. What a day.
00:33:23.378 - 00:33:33.488, Speaker B: It is a day. And holy. I mean, I can't believe it. Been ten years and we finally have bitcoin. Bitcoin ETF's approved and trading in the US today. On Thursday.
00:33:33.656 - 00:33:40.688, Speaker D: It feels like you've run more than a marathon. You've probably done like an Ironman triathlon marathon all put together, and now you're at the starting line.
00:33:40.736 - 00:33:42.480, Speaker B: Yeah. Now we only just get to start.
00:33:42.552 - 00:33:49.464, Speaker D: Now you get to start. Now the battle begins. The privilege to start and compete with all the biggest asset managers in the world has now been afforded to us.
00:33:49.504 - 00:33:55.778, Speaker B: It's really amazing. And, I mean, the Bloomberg guys have been calling it the Cointuckee derby with all the horses at the starting gate. Finally at the starting gate.
00:33:55.826 - 00:33:57.514, Speaker D: Right. It's apt.
00:33:57.674 - 00:34:05.282, Speaker B: It's going to be really exciting. Now, obviously, Steve, you run Galaxy's asset management business. I think. What was the latest number that we published publicly on AUM?
00:34:05.338 - 00:34:09.322, Speaker D: Yes, we're five, 3 billion AUM business as of November 30.
00:34:09.378 - 00:34:16.218, Speaker B: And a lot of that is the huge deal that you guys landed managing the FTX estate. So that was a big win.
00:34:16.346 - 00:34:33.586, Speaker D: Yeah, look, I think last year was about. If 2022 was sort of cataclysmically bad. 2023 was digestion and cleaning up the mess. And so part of our mission at Galaxy, we're institutional. We're supposed to clean up the mess. 2024 is not about cleaning up the mess. 2024 is about the ETF moving forward and maybe others.
00:34:33.650 - 00:34:43.202, Speaker B: I saw that Galaxy, Invesco Galaxy, but also Blackrock. I thought fidelity, although I couldn't find it earlier, Ark have filed for ETH. Spot EtF's the ETH?
00:34:43.258 - 00:34:47.098, Speaker D: Yeah. It's going to be a crypto Twitter meme, if it's not already. For sure.
00:34:47.266 - 00:34:56.853, Speaker B: I was looking to those 19 b. Four final approval dates start to roll out in May. So after now that the bitcoin, now we'll get back to bitcoin, but that's also on the horizon.
00:34:56.893 - 00:35:18.554, Speaker D: No, look, I think there's a roadmap, right. And how do you become an institutional crypto asset? And you start with regulated futures in the US. Then there's the OSC approval of an ETF in Canada, then there's the futures ETF in the US, and then there's a spot ETF. So we can't predict what the SEC is going to do ever, and certainly not in the ETH case. But there's a real parallel. Three of those four have been hit by ethanol. Four of those four are now hit with bitcoin.
00:35:18.554 - 00:35:21.022, Speaker D: Future assets need to look at that roadmap.
00:35:21.078 - 00:35:40.554, Speaker B: It is like you see CME rollout futures on a new crypto asset, and you're like, oh, wow, when's the ETF? Yeah, when's the ETF? It could be years later, but that starts the clock sort of. Let's stick with bitcoin. Steve, Galaxy's partnered with Invesco. We also Galaxy have exchange rated products in other countries, all with partnerships. Is that that's clearly part of your strategy?
00:35:40.974 - 00:36:06.540, Speaker D: I think that you see a lot with eleven issuers. There's no precedent for that in the ETF race. And when you look at the crypto native guys, bless them, I hope they do great. We love our peers and competitors in that space. We took the view many years ago that you need both things. You need the sausage making of the issuers, you need the regulatory and legal prowess, and you need the distribution. And so when we came together with Invesco, we thought there couldn't be a better partnership.
00:36:06.540 - 00:36:21.860, Speaker D: They believe in crypto, they believe in blockchain technology. They've innovated. They created the QQQs that are $200 billion just in that suite of ETF's. And they wanted a partner that could plug in. And so Galaxy Asset management philosophically was aligned. It's a long term thing. It's not just about bitcoin.
00:36:21.860 - 00:36:29.620, Speaker D: And they're the second biggest issuer in this race, I think that gets missed in the overall picture. And you plug that in with what we're doing and I think we have something different.
00:36:29.772 - 00:36:43.604, Speaker B: Yeah. Blackrock is the largest ETF issuer by Aum, but then Invesco is number four. And then wisdom tree van Eck are nine and ten. Fidelity 13 and then Ark 24 and Franklin Templeton 25.
00:36:43.684 - 00:36:44.168, Speaker D: That's right.
00:36:44.236 - 00:36:49.456, Speaker B: So, yeah, I mean, invest go is number four. Worldwide, over 450 billion. It looks like just from some data I pulled.
00:36:49.520 - 00:36:49.864, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:49.944 - 00:36:59.400, Speaker D: If you care about bitcoin, which I do, and which we do, you want to have these sales forces educated about bitcoin and then educating about bitcoin. And so that's the big unlock.
00:36:59.432 - 00:36:59.576, Speaker A: Right.
00:36:59.600 - 00:37:12.832, Speaker D: If you look through all this, you have all of these people that are out there that we've now spent the last year, really three years, we've been on file since 2021 with Invesco. Their team's awesome. We've been teaching their salesforce, getting their marketing teams up to speed. It's been great.
00:37:12.888 - 00:37:19.608, Speaker B: That's what's so interesting. Like, I mean, I've done some of that work with you guys. I've done some videos. You can see those videos on some videos. You're in some videos.
00:37:19.656 - 00:37:20.384, Speaker D: You clean up nicely.
00:37:20.424 - 00:37:43.320, Speaker B: Thank you. Yeah. And the funny thing, what I really sort of realized was how important, like, I mean, I've been educating people about bitcoin for years, but how important this time is because now we're helping educate the people who will do the educating. Yes. Right. So significant scale, right. If we get something, I was telling this to my team as we're working on some of these, these educational materials, like both for Invesco but also for DWS, which we're working with in Europe.
00:37:43.320 - 00:37:49.688, Speaker B: Like, dude, it matters. We need to get this right because it's going to get, we're putting this in 1000 people's hands and then they're going to put it in 100,000 people's hands.
00:37:49.736 - 00:38:18.034, Speaker D: There's a real responsibility to it and it hasn't been done well before and there's been no reason for it to be done at this scale before. So education at scale has never happened in bitcoin. It has happened on a grassroots, bottom up basis and that's been an awesome process. And that's how hundreds of millions of people have come to bitcoin. The next group needs something like this for that to really happen. What I'm excited about is then the second order effect of that, once everyone understands that bitcoin isn't what the headlines say it is. Then what happens? And what does that unlock in terms of the understanding of bitcoin and why bitcoin matters? That's pretty cool.
00:38:18.074 - 00:38:27.762, Speaker B: It's going to be amazing. Okay, so let's get into the ETF a little bit. So they start trading today. It's crazy. It's actually. I'm still having, like. It's not deja.
00:38:27.762 - 00:38:41.394, Speaker B: I don't know what it is. It's like a physical sensation, though. For how long we've been waiting for this. There are eleven, I believe, applicants, I think maybe ten. I think hashtags actually might not be in this round. And theirs is different. They're adding spot to an existing product.
00:38:41.394 - 00:39:02.450, Speaker B: I don't know. I asked this for Eric Balchunis, who is on this episode too. What's like, in your mind? I'm not going to ask you for a prediction in inflows, but. And again, think of the whole complex, not any specific one, but is there a number that's like, holy crap, this was a blowout smash win. And is there a number that's like, oh, crap, it's a flop in your mind?
00:39:02.482 - 00:39:32.990, Speaker D: Like, you know, yeah, maybe I'll work backwards, like, in any context in asset management, but also in ETF's. I think that Aum is an output, not an input. And so what you can control, what you can control, and that's about the process. And so I do think it's a mistake to say all these ETF's are the same. And I'll get to the question of AUm in a second, but I think what you need to generate real AUm, and let's call real Aum tens of billions, not a billion or 2 billion. So the way to get to tens of billions of AUm is you need a liquidity environment. You need great execution that tracks the product well.
00:39:32.990 - 00:40:04.816, Speaker D: You need great service providers, you need low fees, you need marketing, you need sales. And you probably need a little bit of luck, some seed money, that kind of thing. So you need six or seven things to go well over time. So my question to any issuer is, when you look across that, you'll have guys that are good at four of those, or two of those, or one of those. The Invesco Galaxy piece covers that entire swath. I think what's going to set us apart, and I think what's underappreciated now is really how cash create works, what it means as a model. And then how do you source bitcoin? And how do you create an efficient product? Because Aum is going to follow liquidity.
00:40:04.816 - 00:40:30.676, Speaker D: We've seen that in Canada where we have funds. We've seen that in other ETF examples. Historically, no one's talking about liquidity, everyone's thunderdome fees. And I get it. It's the hype and seed and day one money. If there's liquidity and if there's all these other things, that's when it goes from, hey, it's on Morgan Stanley's platform to now it's in the model portfolio. Now the average FAA can say, hey, it's a percent allocation, and every client that talks to that FAA is going to do that because that's what they're paid to do.
00:40:30.700 - 00:40:31.004, Speaker C: Right.
00:40:31.084 - 00:40:57.480, Speaker D: So I think how quickly we get to the end investors on this stuff with a real recommendation for how to put bitcoin in a portfolio. It's probably not the first day, but it's not going to take two years. It's not. Remember, these platforms in 2021, they put private bitcoin funds on. Many of them put private bitcoins on their funds, on their platforms. And all of them learned about bitcoin at the FA level, at the home office level. And then the underlying clients got some.
00:40:57.512 - 00:41:00.800, Speaker B: Degree of information about bitcoin, webinars, documents, research.
00:41:00.912 - 00:41:28.678, Speaker D: It didn't finish the job because there was friction to that private fund, but it started the path. And so when you go to these platforms a year ago or six months ago or three months ago, you're not starting at zero. And once there's the ETF, the chicken and egg of the regulatories, why they can't be on platform. But actually, the unlock for that chicken and egg is the fact that this happened. That'll take a couple months, and then there will click. There'll be a click moment with those guys, and then it'll really be open season. And so I think the real game begins three, six months from now.
00:41:28.678 - 00:41:55.618, Speaker D: What will also happen three, six months from now is you can look at data. We're the best tracking ETF in Canada by far. We've managed really tight tracking error to our private funds. Historically, that's the kind of thing you talk about five bps of fees or ten bits of fees difference. How about percentage differences and the tracking error to bitcoin, to the fund. So how you access bitcoin and how you run the products relative to a pretty volatile asset, that's going to become the real story, I think when you talk to institutional wealth and allocators and.
00:41:55.626 - 00:42:13.322, Speaker B: That kind of thing, so let me ask you then, I will call it end of year since you're looking more on a couple month time frame for the growth to really start to happen. We put out a report, we said 14 billion. This is conservative, by the way, and we only looked at the FA market. Right. 14 billion inflows by year. In year one is a conservative estimate.
00:42:13.418 - 00:42:38.428, Speaker D: I'll take the over on that. I'll take the over for the following reason. I think the TAM analysis you guys did, $48 trillion market in the well side is very. It's right, it's appropriate. The other big markets that haven't really been unlocked for bitcoin are the traditional hedge fund market and then also the allocator market. So asset owners pensions, corporate pensions, endowments, foundations, et cetera. The hedge fund market is going to surprise people.
00:42:38.428 - 00:42:56.762, Speaker D: There are many hedge funds that have done work. We talk to them all the time at Galaxy Digital trading. Maybe the PM wants to buy bitcoin. The COO or the compliance officer is not there yet. This ETF's going to totally change the game. You can post the shares as marginal. The best products are going to have options listed on them.
00:42:56.762 - 00:43:19.186, Speaker D: So there's going to be a whole liquidity ecosystem that develops just around this. You can short other crypto listed products to fund these trades. And so the way that capital finds its way to these ETF's is going to be far greater than people expect because there just is no friction between those products and that ecosystem. So I think that plus the wealth, plus the international pockets are also not talked about.
00:43:19.290 - 00:43:19.530, Speaker B: Right.
00:43:19.562 - 00:43:24.532, Speaker D: Invesco has an Asia team, right? Right. They have a Europe team and they find their way into the US.
00:43:24.548 - 00:43:44.068, Speaker B: That's a thing like the US being like a premier capital market or the premier capital market. Right. Americans can't buy the canadian listed ETF's. And that's partly for regulatory reasons in the US because they're not approved. The SEC doesn't want that because they haven't approved them here. But also, Canada is a weird capital market. They don't actually use like, they use non standard settlement and stuff right there.
00:43:44.068 - 00:43:58.198, Speaker B: So because I can buy. I used to get really annoyed by this. Like I said, well, I can go on my fidelity account. I can literally buy. I have the international stock trading agreement signed there. I can literally buy like azerbaijani listed stocks, but I can't buy canadian ones. But the reverse is mostly not true.
00:43:58.198 - 00:44:01.214, Speaker B: Most of the world can access us capital markets.
00:44:01.374 - 00:44:22.410, Speaker D: That's exactly right. There are european investors, there are south american investors, there are asian investors. There are pipes that exist. The scalability of this is also what's sort of being this. People say it, but they don't really understand under the hood what that actually means. We're activating so much more than just the wealth market in the US. And so that's why I think maybe it's more.
00:44:22.410 - 00:44:25.226, Speaker D: I don't know if it's 20 billion or 30 billion, but it's probably more than 14.
00:44:25.330 - 00:44:30.618, Speaker B: Well, I'm excited. The ticker. Our ticker. This ticker, I should say Mesco's ticker. What is it? You tell us.
00:44:30.666 - 00:44:44.114, Speaker D: I like our ticker. It's BTCO. BTC front and center. There's a lot of things you can play around with. On the marketing side, we think a ticker matters. It doesn't matter as much as the product details, but the ticker matters a lot. You'll find a good way to use that in the rest.
00:44:44.154 - 00:45:02.450, Speaker B: Let me let you get back to it, Steve. It's a big day in the market and for bitcoin and at galaxy, congratulations. I know you've been, I mean, you're almost a day one Galaxy employee. And this is like, for anyone in crypto asset management, this has been the ahab's whale, like the holy grail that we could never find, but it's finally here. Congratulations.
