00:00:07.520 - 00:00:12.782, Speaker A: Let's go to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, my friend. How are you?
00:00:12.838 - 00:00:14.214, Speaker B: I'm doing great. How are you doing?
00:00:14.294 - 00:00:20.510, Speaker A: I'm great. I'm feeling good. We're like, since we last talked last week, it's been a material rally in crypto assets.
00:00:20.582 - 00:00:23.126, Speaker B: Yes, it has. It's been a very fun journey.
00:00:23.190 - 00:00:28.348, Speaker A: And now, month over month, I think as of today, this is Wednesday, what, January 18?
00:00:28.446 - 00:00:29.112, Speaker B: I think.
00:00:29.208 - 00:00:49.680, Speaker A: Is it the 18th? I didn't screw that up, I think so. Today is Wednesday, January 18, month over month. Bitcoin and ETH are basically both up 30%. Pretty material uplift. I mean, you can see the block clock behind me says 20. We're over 20,000 in bitcoin for the first time since pre FTX. So we've, what, retraced the SBF dot?
00:00:49.712 - 00:00:55.512, Speaker B: Yeah, I would argue that it's just catch up to traditional markets.
00:00:55.568 - 00:00:55.880, Speaker A: Right.
00:00:55.952 - 00:01:02.672, Speaker B: You know, traditional markets, basically, since, you know, mid to late October, early November, have just been on a one way tear.
00:01:02.728 - 00:01:07.608, Speaker A: Right. Since that, CPI missed to the downside, which was right around or right after.
00:01:07.656 - 00:01:18.656, Speaker B: FTA, which was the same day. Yeah. Nasdaq was ripping, like, you know, four plus percent. Five, six. It was up like 6% on the day as bitcoin was collapsing.
00:01:18.720 - 00:01:19.324, Speaker A: Right.
00:01:20.174 - 00:01:46.566, Speaker B: And it's only been going higher ever since as well, with the exception of today. And so there's a huge catch up. And you look at things like gold. Right. Gold went from 1650 around the same time to 19,000 or 1920, other sort of dollar proxies. Euro went from about one to 108. So you've had huge moves in traditional markets.
00:01:46.750 - 00:01:48.998, Speaker A: DXY has come down over that time, too.
00:01:49.086 - 00:01:49.654, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:01:49.734 - 00:01:50.366, Speaker A: Making waves.
00:01:50.470 - 00:02:08.838, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And so I do think there's an element of this that is just catch up to traditional markets. Dollar weakness, us equities higher. There's an element that is base effects. There's a lot of cryptos that are just sold off so much.
00:02:08.926 - 00:02:13.090, Speaker A: Down 90%, going up 100% after that. Easy.
00:02:13.162 - 00:02:40.964, Speaker B: It's super easy. Yeah. Especially. And then you had just a sheer amount of liquidations from the short side. From what we saw in exchanges, you're probably looking at at least $500 million of liquidations, if not more. And then I just think when you think about crypto down at such low levels, if you're playing it from the short side, what are you really playing for?
00:02:41.114 - 00:02:45.672, Speaker A: Right. 16 to ten, like. Yeah, that'd be a material.
00:02:45.768 - 00:03:00.768, Speaker B: Yeah. If, you know, if FTX and the slew of things that had happened this year in crypto. Couldn't take us below 15. Five. What on earth is going to take us below there? I mean, it would have to be, like, finance.
00:03:00.816 - 00:03:01.712, Speaker A: That's what I was going to say.
00:03:01.808 - 00:03:03.824, Speaker B: Totally fraudulent just a few minutes ago.
00:03:03.904 - 00:03:15.146, Speaker A: Right. They're not. As far as we know. I mean, I. And we're. I think, you know. But just a few minutes ago, the Department of Justice, this morning, they had said that they were set to take a cryptocurrency action.
00:03:15.146 - 00:03:44.028, Speaker A: They would announce at noon, it's like 1230. So a few minutes ago, and of course, there's been talk, there was some Reuters reporting weeks ago that I think the journals reported on this, too, that there was a dispute among us regulators and law enforcement about what to do with binance. And so there's been this hangover on binance that there could be some kind of action. I think the market assumed that it must be binance, but it turned out. What was it?
00:03:44.196 - 00:03:46.384, Speaker B: It was a russian exchange.
00:03:46.964 - 00:03:47.884, Speaker A: I don't know how to say it.
00:03:47.924 - 00:03:51.556, Speaker B: Bits lato, bits lotto or something along those lines.
00:03:51.580 - 00:03:52.668, Speaker A: So it wasn't finance.
00:03:52.716 - 00:03:55.100, Speaker B: It wasn't finance. It did start with a b, though.
00:03:55.172 - 00:03:58.148, Speaker A: Yeah. And it was like, you know, there was a press conference.
00:03:58.196 - 00:04:24.348, Speaker B: There was a press conference. And I'll say. I mean, obviously there was some shady stuff going on with the exchange, but the cynic in me was like, the government just wanted to do a press conference and say the words Russia, China and crypto and take a victory lap about something. The only way this would have been, like, better was if they planted some trees and got some carbon offsets. Like, I don't know how else.
00:04:24.476 - 00:04:39.696, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a good story for the government, given, like, the war in Ukraine and the geopolitics, and they seized the domain. They did that thing where they put up a graphic on the website. Now, this, to be clear, I don't think. You probably didn't. This is a russian based crypto exchange that I've never heard of.
00:04:39.780 - 00:04:40.328, Speaker B: I've never heard of it.
00:04:40.336 - 00:04:51.544, Speaker A: I mean, that's why we were chuckling a little bit, because, like, the announcement, the pre announcement made it seem like, oh, this is gonna like. And I think crypto markets were a little bit jittery leading into this announcement, but it turned out that, like, no one's ever even heard of this thing.
00:04:51.704 - 00:04:58.792, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I mean, bitcoin went from 21,000, like, 400 to 20,500 pretty quickly.
00:04:58.848 - 00:04:59.328, Speaker A: Right.
00:04:59.456 - 00:05:40.382, Speaker B: You did have an s and P sell off of material magnitude separate from this. Separate from this at the same time. So it didn't help liquidity. And so you did see a bit of retracement. However, we went right back up the moment the market realized it wasn't binance. I do think that the biggest thing I'm focused on this year is to start the year is the January effect. Folks that are benchmarked to crypto and have to invest in crypto, they're probably underweight and are therefore underperforming the broader market.
00:05:40.382 - 00:06:15.942, Speaker B: So in theory, that makes them kind of forced buyers into this market. You can't be a crypto manager and tell your investors that you're not keeping up with crypto performance this year just because they probably stuck with you through last year. I do think that there are going to be continued dip buyers, and you are going to get more and more folks fomoing into to bitcoin, especially the macro types. I think there's a lot of momentum behind the dollar, weaker trade, and part of that is just bitcoin. Yeah.
00:06:15.958 - 00:06:18.014, Speaker A: One way to express it well is bitcoin.
00:06:18.094 - 00:06:18.454, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:06:18.494 - 00:06:40.902, Speaker A: I've also looked at, I was looking at some on chain data for bitcoin, and one of the things I like most is looking at what price coins last moved. It's the simple way of saying it, really. Utxo is less created for our more technical bitcoin. Yeah. Because it sort of gives you an idea of on chain cost basis. Now, I can send you send a coin to myself or to you. That's not a sale.
00:06:40.902 - 00:07:23.216, Speaker A: And that would mess the metric up. But there was a huge pile other than literally zero to $600, meaning like Satoshi's coins, which is still the biggest cohort, because there's a lot of coins that, like, have never moved or haven't moved in ten years. Other than that, 16, like five to 17. Two is the largest percentage of supply. So a strong base basically was created down there. And what I'd like to see, for me to get more and more comfortable, I think there's many ways to think about this, but if we hang around these levels for long enough, you'll start to see that base move there and start to form a nice stronger base around 20. And that's sort of how, I mean, I've got versions of this data that I've pulled at different times throughout the year.
00:07:23.216 - 00:07:37.520, Speaker A: Last year, I mean, this looked a lot different. There's basically very few coins that last moved at prices higher than today. Right. Most of those coins from like the thirties and forties and fifties and sixties essentially were already sold, right?
00:07:37.552 - 00:07:37.768, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:37.816 - 00:07:40.608, Speaker A: Certainly moved technically, but I think it's a decent heuristic.
00:07:40.736 - 00:07:56.096, Speaker B: No, I think that's totally fair. And the other thing to think about is just the pace of the move you had that happened mainly between Friday New York close and Saturday Asia open or like the overnight season.
00:07:56.160 - 00:07:56.680, Speaker A: It was fast.
00:07:56.752 - 00:08:16.280, Speaker B: It was super fast. And it gave very few folks an opportunity to actually buy in. So if you were constructive of the space you wanted to get a little bit of capital on to start the year, basically, you missed 1015 percent of a move on an illiquid post Friday close.
00:08:16.392 - 00:08:16.968, Speaker A: This is why.
00:08:17.056 - 00:08:58.564, Speaker B: So nobody's had an opportunity to really buy this back on any dip. And so I do think bitcoin's gonna be supported, and I think your case about the cost basis makes sense. The other thing to think about is these low cost basis bitcoin or anything that has remotely a good average fill level. You have huge tax implications when you try to sell this stuff. If I'm long, a lot of crypto, and I know that if I want to get less long, I have to take a huge tax bill, I'm just gonna stick.
00:08:58.684 - 00:09:12.156, Speaker A: Especially if you're generally still long, like, you know, in your thesis. It also tells me too, the fact that people feel like they missed this move is like, well, we were down in those levels for several months. Like you had. It was just like bad news after.
00:09:12.300 - 00:09:13.540, Speaker B: Bad news after bad news.
00:09:13.612 - 00:09:14.304, Speaker A: I know.
00:09:15.044 - 00:09:19.428, Speaker B: And really, it's just so tough. I mean, to think it was a.
00:09:19.436 - 00:09:20.116, Speaker A: Lot of bad news.
00:09:20.180 - 00:09:30.884, Speaker B: It was a lot of bad news. But think about it from this standpoint. Who wants to go like 100% risk on to start the year after the year we just had? It's an impossible.
00:09:31.004 - 00:09:31.436, Speaker A: I know.
00:09:31.500 - 00:09:43.772, Speaker B: It's an impossibly decision to make, right? Like you have to either be super irrational or like crazy genius level, like either zero iq or like 200 to kind of make that decision.
00:09:43.828 - 00:09:49.884, Speaker A: Well, that makes sense. It's that left curve, right curve meme. Right. I mean, it's pretty funny, though, to think about it that way.
00:09:50.044 - 00:09:58.268, Speaker B: It's like I'm gonna go gung ho Max risk on crypto chan one. Well, that's right. Thing to do, right?
00:09:58.356 - 00:10:14.076, Speaker A: It turns out. Well, that's what's funny to your point about like the catch up trade and like the benchmarking to BTC, if you're bet most, I think a lot of funds, crypto, like liquid funds benchmark against bitcoin is probably the most common then some, maybe against ETH some newer ones, but also a lot against like indexes. Right.
00:10:14.100 - 00:10:16.620, Speaker B: Like the crypto index or whatever.
00:10:16.692 - 00:10:27.414, Speaker A: And like honestly, if you're benchmarked to, if you are benchmarked to bitcoin ETH or the, in particular, you almost certainly. But you invest in other altcoins, you probably underperformed.
00:10:28.194 - 00:10:28.738, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:28.826 - 00:10:49.218, Speaker A: Or maybe if you're against the index, it's a little bit better because the index is more diversified. Right. But that's really interesting. And okay, just a couple more minutes. So we got fed in like two weeks and beginning of Feb. But what do we got like on the macro side, what's the economic data you're looking at in the next couple of weeks or what are you thinking here, Mac?
00:10:49.266 - 00:10:58.670, Speaker B: Well, we had retail sales come out today. You know, it showed that spending in December was particularly weak from the US consumer.
00:10:58.782 - 00:11:00.334, Speaker A: That's good, right, for inflation, right?
00:11:00.414 - 00:11:14.110, Speaker B: No, that is good for inflation theoretically, in theory. But again, consumption is 60% to 70% of the US economy. So whenever you see consumption slow down, that's generally like, hey, markets like pay.
00:11:14.142 - 00:11:17.318, Speaker A: Attention to this because it's weakness in general economy.
00:11:17.446 - 00:11:28.026, Speaker B: Absolutely. And if you listen to like the credit card companies or the bank types, they tell you the US consumer is right now eating into savings and stuff.
00:11:28.130 - 00:11:30.802, Speaker A: And like credit card level, debt levels are very high.
00:11:30.898 - 00:12:11.412, Speaker B: Credit card levels are rising. Delinquency rates are kind of rising a little bit, but they're still very low. And so basically you play out the current market for the next six months, the US consumer might not be in such great shape. And that's kind of what the retail sales data showed us today a little bit. And you also had the producer price index data series today that showed softness in prices. But I really, the thing I hate about these economic metrics is they're all backward looking. This is Jan.
00:12:11.412 - 00:12:16.332, Speaker B: 18. We're talking about what people did in December, which seems like a long time.
00:12:16.348 - 00:12:16.736, Speaker A: Ago, by the way.
00:12:16.750 - 00:12:36.824, Speaker B: Seems like a long time ago. But at the same time, what do we know about January 1 to January 17 or January 18? Gas prices have started to rise again. Commodities have started to rise. Copper went on a tear to start the year. Things like aluminum have been trading higher. So that producer price index, that was really soft this morning.
00:12:37.164 - 00:12:37.972, Speaker A: From December.
00:12:38.068 - 00:13:35.118, Speaker B: From December, you're already like, hmm, oh shit. Well, this is probably going to be higher, right? And so I'm trying to focus on more of the high frequency data points, like that Adobe price series that comes out a couple of days before CPI, other metrics along those lines. And even the Fed admitted this recently where there was some paper, where they were like, we totally underestimated the usefulness of soft data, which is survey data, instead of hardcore type data. Yeah. And anecdotal survey type of stuff. And so I think that's really important to kind of pay attention to going forward. Now, what I'll say is the Fed has gotten really smart about this stuff and people like to shit on the Fed all the time, but let's not get it twisted.
00:13:35.118 - 00:14:23.830, Speaker B: They're like a bunch of, like Ivy League phds with a bunch of really smart people working underneath them. And they talk to a bunch of industry folks and smart contacts all the time. So, you know, yes, they messed up on inflation, but they're also some of the savviest people on markets. And what Bullard said this morning was, knowing what he knows now, all the forward looking indicators, high frequency points, blah, blah, blah, all that stuff, he's like, we gotta take rates to 525 to 550, which is very aggressive. The current market pricing is only 490. So his four is 35 basis points above what the market's telling you. And he's saying, the reason he's saying it is because God forbid inflation takes back up again at some point later this year.
00:14:23.862 - 00:14:24.574, Speaker A: Stamp it out.
00:14:24.694 - 00:14:40.780, Speaker B: But he wants just the insurance policy because think about it this way, let's say you're at 525 basis points in interest rates in the US. Shit starts to go downhill and we get nervous. Well, there's 500 basis points of cutting. You can have, like, to get right.
00:14:40.812 - 00:14:42.012, Speaker A: Back to where you said you might.
00:14:42.028 - 00:14:46.340, Speaker B: Be able to start printing money again. It's like, what are you really seeing that cushion?
00:14:46.372 - 00:14:47.012, Speaker A: It's the reverse.
00:14:47.068 - 00:14:58.524, Speaker B: Knowing that you could take mortgage rates from 6% and change right now to 3% overnight, and all of a sudden housing activity will start to pick back up.
00:14:58.564 - 00:15:14.436, Speaker A: Basically, if they overshoot to the side, it just gives them more cushion when they need to come down. It's kind of like the opposite. When they were. Rates were already so low, like into COVID and stuff, that it was like they had nowhere to go. Like they could barely do anything. And they were. Remember this? Back when they were talking about.
00:15:14.436 - 00:15:19.604, Speaker A: We were talking about this back when they were talking, not the Fed, but commentators were like, what if they, they would have to go negative.
00:15:19.724 - 00:15:20.076, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:20.140 - 00:15:23.764, Speaker A: Other central banks worldwide were like, maybe we'll go to negative interest rates.
00:15:23.924 - 00:15:25.284, Speaker B: Oh, man. Fun times.
00:15:25.364 - 00:15:26.932, Speaker A: Nerp instead of zurp.
00:15:27.108 - 00:15:28.428, Speaker B: Yes. Yes.
00:15:28.596 - 00:15:33.204, Speaker A: All right. Well, this is great, Bimnet, as always, our friend Bimnet Abibi from galaxy trading. Thank you so much.
