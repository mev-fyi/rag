00:00:00.160 - 00:00:52.090, Speaker A: On today's show, I'm going to be going over the main decisions that were made on Acde 193. There wasn't a ton, but I'll quickly go over the key agenda items from the call, and then I will highlight probably what I thought was the most interesting part of the call, which was the discussion on the Verkle upgrade for Ethereum. Verkle is this major overhaul to Ethereum's data structure that developers have been thinking about for quite some time now. They have prescheduled it as the main feature of the next upgrade after Pektra. But for the first time, I think I heard quite a bit of questions around whether Verkl should be prioritized.
