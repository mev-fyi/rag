00:00:07.280 - 00:00:11.718, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bibnet, a BB from Galaxy trading. As always, Bibnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:11.806 - 00:00:12.954, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:13.494 - 00:00:29.298, Speaker A: So another week in the books since we last talked. I think you well enunciated a near term bearish case for BTC last week. Where does it just stand now in your mind? I mean, we've had a whole another week in the books. We've traded sub 40 finally after.
00:00:29.446 - 00:00:29.802, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:29.858 - 00:00:32.626, Speaker A: As low as, like, maybe what, the low 38? Yeah. 38 five.
00:00:32.690 - 00:00:33.314, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:33.474 - 00:00:36.138, Speaker A: A little bit of stability right now just at 40k.
00:00:36.226 - 00:00:36.610, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:36.682 - 00:00:37.734, Speaker A: What are you thinking now?
00:00:38.154 - 00:01:23.114, Speaker B: I think 40k is kind of a crucial level. I'd like to see us sustainably, like, have closes above 40k for me to start getting constructive about the market. I think right now what you've seen so far is 38,500 and, like, the hundred day moving average, those levels have held us support, whether that's from organic, you know, you know, demand or from short covering or from gamma hedging, you know, it's tough to say. But bitcoin has certainly found support in a region that you would have thought should have been like, first line of support. And now, you know, in order to get more constructive about an upside scenario, you really need to see 40k hold as support.
00:01:23.194 - 00:01:23.850, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:24.002 - 00:02:35.016, Speaker B: Right now we're hovering in and around the level, and it doesn't seem like there's genuine organic, robust demand right now. However, what is notable is that grayscale volumes have started to decrease and eventually that flow will abate. There is a level at which folks are going to stop converting out of grayscale, but that still might be a couple billion or 10 billion, couple weeks. Generally speaking, I think the market is trading pretty healthily or okay. And I think corrections in a market that have moved 160% in a year or even just in the last quarter, like the move that bitcoin had, I think a correction like this is very healthy. You're talking about 20 to 30 ish percent off the highs. I mean, I think that's, you know, as long as we kind of hold here, it tells you you're still probably in an uptrend, but it really depends on what kind of timeframe you're thinking about this stuff.
00:02:35.016 - 00:03:02.470, Speaker B: Right. Like, I'm pretty confident that, you know, as soon as the grayscale overhang kind of abates, that just the passive inflows are really going to take this market higher. And so if you're sitting back and thinking, like, is now a good time to, you know, get into bitcoin I think it's an okay time to start averaging in over time. And, you know, and I think that's what a product like an ETF is for.
00:03:02.542 - 00:03:02.846, Speaker A: Right?
00:03:02.910 - 00:03:10.126, Speaker B: Right. Your dollar cost average and you make it part of your 401k allocation, et cetera. And over time you build a reasonably sized position.
00:03:10.230 - 00:03:37.134, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it makes sense. You know, to your point about the healthy corrections, actually, if you look back at the 2017 bull run in bitcoin, there were like literally like 720 percent plus corrections during that run from eight hundred dollars to twenty thousand dollars. I forget the number of corrections from 2021 and or 20 and 21. But there were a similar large number. I mean, people only remember a number. It went up, but actually it was volatile. So I agree.
00:03:37.134 - 00:04:08.410, Speaker A: Totally, totally healthy. You also have, look, this is a wall bitcoin's got to run through, right? I mean, I think, think about this. People also been talking a lot about the Mount Gox coins, which I'm of the belief doesn't, won't really be distributed for another six to nine months anyway. But that's also, we clear those out, you're not going to go to, I don't know, one hundred k, a million dollars of bitcoin without resolving these things. So it's a core thing we've got to deal with and they will be dealt with.
00:04:08.602 - 00:04:39.145, Speaker B: No, I agree. No. And I think that the broader risk background is also constructive for bitcoin. I mean, Nasdaq today is just, you know, up another percent. We've had a couple tech names report earnings all time high, all time high. Some of the magnificent seven names are trading at fresh all time highs. Household wealth is at the dead highs, and the fiscal picture has not improved at all.
00:04:39.145 - 00:04:48.894, Speaker B: And so I think there is still constant demand for speculation for store of value. And bitcoin is a combo of the two.
00:04:50.434 - 00:05:17.484, Speaker A: Speculation on the future of store of value is one way of thinking about it. So you mentioned macro and the macro backdrop. FOMC is next week. So obviously next week we'll talk about it when it happens. But the market's expectations had been for a nice set of cuts. And then was it last week that, or even the week before we had some very hawkish fed speak come out that slightly altered it. But it's still, what are your expectations for next week?
00:05:17.784 - 00:05:47.882, Speaker B: Yeah, so we've got to get through like a bunch of data, like between now and then. You've got initial jobless claims, you've got the quarterly refunding announcement, you've got PCE data on Friday and so I think the market is going to focus on those data points up until FOMC. But ultimately the data side of me tells me that the Fed shouldn't be cutting and that the data is still super strong.
00:05:47.938 - 00:05:49.018, Speaker A: We don't need them to cut.
00:05:49.066 - 00:06:22.344, Speaker B: We don't need them to cut. I mean, initial jobs claims printed below 200, like pmis this morning were in expansion territory. And surprise to the upside. And so there's a healthy and really good argument to be made that you don't need any cuts. But what I heard from Powell during December FOMC was that he is starting to think about a cutting cycle. And he is very aware that in six months time and in nine months time that inflation will be at or below target. Below, you don't want below.
00:06:22.344 - 00:07:03.020, Speaker B: And so if you're in a world where you know that inflation has come down a lot and is likely coming down further, like, why on earth are you having rates at such restrictive levels? And so this is kind of where I differ from the market a lot, is folks have been pushing back against a march cut, and there's about ten basis points priced into that March meeting right now, which is the first potential meeting where they could cut. And I just think that if you think that you're going to have to be cutting in June and September and May, you might as well just get started with a 25 in march and signal that you are trying to get ahead of it.
00:07:03.132 - 00:07:07.340, Speaker A: Better to cut and then pause and then cut than to surprise the market with no cut. Is that.
00:07:07.372 - 00:07:36.354, Speaker B: Yeah. Or it's also just you want to take a more gradual approach, like 25 x, space it out longer. Right. If you're trying to do at least 100, like let's say you're about 150 basis points too restrictive right now for current market conditions. So that implies that you want to take rates, to call it 360 ish, 300 and 5363, hundred and 70 somewhere around there. And you don't want to mess with the election too much and be perceived going one way or two or get.
00:07:36.394 - 00:07:37.778, Speaker A: Going earlier and have it be going.
00:07:37.826 - 00:08:29.084, Speaker B: Already and go at a predictable pace and you want to go steady. And so while there's been fed pushback from a lot of speakers, including Waller, most notably, I think you had Jim Bullard, who retired from the Fed and is now working at Purdue University. He came out and was like, I could see the Fed starting cutting as early as March. And he was one of the biggest rate hike guys. During the hiking cycle, he was calling for 575% to 6% at some point he's like, when unemployment rate is giving you the gift of not going up a lot, you should be very aggressive. But now he's just like, wait, where's inflation going to be in twelve months time and where do you want your rates to be when inflation is there.
00:08:29.124 - 00:08:37.708, Speaker A: Until the soft landing attempt? They want to, maybe if they look forward to where they think the data is going to be, they want to start cutting now so that the crash isn't hard. So it's not a hard landing.
00:08:37.756 - 00:08:37.964, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:38.004 - 00:08:38.580, Speaker A: Correct.
00:08:38.732 - 00:08:53.960, Speaker B: And so just trying to mitigate that a little bit. The key side to that though is the easing you've had in financial conditions. I mean, like the stock market's just gone up a lot. People don't, you know, people that are invested in the equity market don't feel poor right now.
00:08:54.032 - 00:08:54.644, Speaker A: Right.
00:08:54.944 - 00:09:27.734, Speaker B: And you know, those are the same type of people that are gonna be property buyers if mortgage rates come down. And so, and there's compounded, you know, wealth effects to this, you know, equity dynamic. And so I think, you know, there's some risks to cutting early as well to kind of manage. But given the tone of Powell last December, I just think that he's committed to cutting rates and that's all that matters. It's not really data. It's really what, like what does Powell want and what is the Fed actually going to do?
00:09:27.854 - 00:09:39.294, Speaker A: And we can debate and you've made a case for keeping him higher, longer. But also, I mean, the real question, and I'm asking what everyone is wondering is what will happen? And your point is that he's already sort of locked into this narrative that.
00:09:39.374 - 00:10:06.602, Speaker B: Yeah, he's going to be cutting. It's just a question of when and by how much. And it's like you start cutting in maybe, right. Do you allow five months into the year when, you know, like if I knew for sure, if I was Powell and I was like, rates are too restrictive right now. Right. If I knew for sure and I was really confident in that view, I'd start cutting, right. Like I'd cut maybe in Jan, like maybe in like February start.
00:10:06.698 - 00:10:07.970, Speaker A: You just can always pause.
00:10:08.042 - 00:10:26.982, Speaker B: You can pause, but it's also doing 25 and like the logic is sound, right. Nobody's gonna like disagree with him. That's rates are probably too restrictive given the inflation levels and we kind of see where things are headed. And so I think you want to take a more gradual, smoothed approach.
00:10:27.118 - 00:10:28.774, Speaker A: And it's tinkering.
00:10:28.894 - 00:10:29.594, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:30.534 - 00:10:51.670, Speaker A: I don't know. I mean, it's obviously the way the modern economy and monetary policies work every time we talk about this. I mean, maybe because I'm so interested in bitcoin that the contrast is just so striking. Because now if it happens in March or may or anytime, I mean, right, we have the halving in April.
00:10:51.782 - 00:10:53.390, Speaker B: Yeah. It winds up really well.
00:10:53.462 - 00:10:54.958, Speaker A: Yeah. Just, just like last time.
00:10:55.006 - 00:11:01.118, Speaker B: Yeah. And it also want, you know, potentially the Fed might be tapering its quantitative tightening.
00:11:01.246 - 00:11:09.302, Speaker A: They're easing in rate, perhaps in rates and in balance sheet. At the same time. Bitcoin is credible and automatically tightening, quote, unquote.
00:11:09.398 - 00:11:14.206, Speaker B: And I mean, it's just that narrative writes itself. It does. It does.
00:11:14.310 - 00:11:20.982, Speaker A: So what should ask Chairman Powell when he goes before Congress, like, what his comments are on the bitcoin? Having, I think would be a really great.
00:11:21.038 - 00:11:28.950, Speaker B: I would like to ask him, like, hey, buddy, did you see the CBO's projections of where debt to GDP is going to be in 30 years time?
00:11:29.022 - 00:11:30.630, Speaker A: This is your big hobby horse. And you're right.
00:11:30.742 - 00:11:38.742, Speaker B: It's like 250% from a congressional budget office. That is like. Like not telling you, like, the full truth.
00:11:38.798 - 00:11:42.230, Speaker A: Like, you're an economist, sir. Like, is that sustainable for a nation?
00:11:42.342 - 00:11:42.638, Speaker B: Yes.
00:11:42.686 - 00:11:43.394, Speaker A: Like, like.
00:11:43.494 - 00:11:54.986, Speaker B: Like, basically, I mean, this goes back to the whole idea of, like, fiscal dominance, right. Monetary policy is gonna be dominated or heavily influenced by its need to finance the debt for the.
00:11:55.010 - 00:11:57.898, Speaker A: But then he refuses to talk about it, the main purpose for it.
00:11:57.906 - 00:12:00.698, Speaker B: But he's like, well, Congress sets this policy. I got it.
00:12:00.706 - 00:12:02.658, Speaker A: I know, I get it. And they need to remain independent.
00:12:02.706 - 00:12:11.416, Speaker B: Absurd to me. We're just spending. And, like, it's like, you can't win with either party. They're just gonna both spend more. Right. You said this.
00:12:11.440 - 00:12:13.800, Speaker A: Nobody gets elected saying they're gonna cut spending. Really?
00:12:13.872 - 00:12:14.176, Speaker B: No.
00:12:14.240 - 00:12:15.312, Speaker A: And it's really escalating zero.
00:12:15.368 - 00:12:25.296, Speaker B: It's like, either the dems are gonna increase spending like crazy, or the Republicans are gonna cut taxes like crazy, and your deficit's just gonna end up being, like, absurd. Yeah.
00:12:25.360 - 00:12:39.938, Speaker A: There's a cognitive dissonance. Of course. We know why he doesn't wanna come out. Cause it's political, quote unquote. But in reality, it's not political. It's simple math. And it's also, if you're saying one of the main things driving central bank policy to not talk about it, it's just like.
00:12:39.938 - 00:12:47.094, Speaker A: And pretend that it's only unemployment and inflation. That is what's driving your policy. Like, that. Something can't be true.
00:12:47.474 - 00:12:48.562, Speaker B: I completely agree with that.
00:12:48.578 - 00:12:52.970, Speaker A: And going forward, it definitely won't be true. Then they really will have to be thinking about it every day.
00:12:53.002 - 00:13:20.832, Speaker B: They don't. And then the other part of it is, you know that when you expand the balance sheet, right. That is permanent debt being added to, you know, the economy and the balance sheet. And, like, you know, you can't tell me that it doesn't impact inflation and demand. Like, when you increase your balance sheet by $6 trillion in a short span. Right. Like, that has led to a permanent increase in demand.
00:13:20.928 - 00:13:21.272, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:21.328 - 00:13:26.224, Speaker B: And so the inflation issue is perpetually going to be there.
00:13:26.384 - 00:13:26.680, Speaker A: Right.
00:13:26.712 - 00:13:45.018, Speaker B: If you have to cut rates and manage the balance sheet around, you know, the fiscal spending. Right. Like, and every time we have job cuts and shit, unemployment benefits. Here's some more money. Here's some checks in the mail. Like, it's just, like, it's hard to stomach.
00:13:45.106 - 00:13:45.442, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:45.498 - 00:13:56.912, Speaker B: And the problem is just the time disconnect. Like, that's a trade for, you know, the next 510 years, you know, versus monetary policy right now. And so it's just. It's just tough.
00:13:56.978 - 00:13:58.012, Speaker A: All right. Bim Netabee.
00:13:58.108 - 00:13:58.612, Speaker B: Bim Netta.
00:13:58.628 - 00:14:00.964, Speaker A: Bibi, my friend from Galaxy trading. Thank you so much.
