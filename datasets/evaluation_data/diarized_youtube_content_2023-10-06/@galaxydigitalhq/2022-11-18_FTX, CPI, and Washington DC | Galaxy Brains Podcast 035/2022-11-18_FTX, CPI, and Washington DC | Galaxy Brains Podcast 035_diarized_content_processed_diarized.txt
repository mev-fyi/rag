00:00:07.200 - 00:00:31.422, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital. We have a wild show today. It's been a crazy week. First, we're going to talk markets with BiMnet Abibi, as always. Then I'm going to give some thoughts and some background on this FTX Alameda situation. Really a bad situation, but we don't know everything.
00:00:31.422 - 00:01:09.594, Speaker A: But I'll show you what we can, what we do know and what we can say. And then we're going to get our friend Tyler Williams, the head of public policy at Galaxy, to weigh in on the impact of FTX and in Washington on crypto policy and also the midterm elections. It's going to be a wild one, and I'm happy you're here for it. Before we begin, though, please refer to the disclaimers in the link on the podcast notes. And note that none of the information provided during this podcast constitutes investment advice or recommendation, solicitation or offer by Galaxy Digital or its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Got that disclaimer out of the way. Let's get to it.
00:01:09.594 - 00:01:34.824, Speaker A: Welcome to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Digital trading. Great to see you, man. It's been a wild week. Obviously, you know, the FTX stuff has moved crypto markets dramatically. But also, we just had a CPI print, and I guess inflation is still increasing but at a slower pace than expected.
00:01:34.984 - 00:01:35.724, Speaker B: Correct.
00:01:36.024 - 00:01:37.968, Speaker A: Which is what? That's bullish. It is good.
00:01:38.096 - 00:02:19.904, Speaker B: So what happened today was you got inflation numbers that came in lower than expected. So headline CPI came in at 7.7 versus expectations of 7.9. So you had a pretty significant miss to the downside. That miss was largely driven by softness in things like used auto prices, health insurance, slightly lower rate of positive inflation on rents and owner equivalent rent and housing, and a couple other sort of idiosyncratic factors. But it's the first time in a really long time where inflation surprised to the downside. And so the market has had a very violent reaction afterwards.
00:02:19.904 - 00:02:46.004, Speaker B: And the most immediate reaction was in the rate market, where you basically started to price out more than one full hike. So front end rates sort of moved lower by about 35 basis points today. And so you basically, with the most important part being that December is now looking like a 50, and that caused equities to repair as well.
00:02:46.084 - 00:02:47.420, Speaker A: They were big. I mean, I saw at one point.
00:02:47.452 - 00:03:19.604, Speaker B: Nasdaq's up 6% as of this podcast right now. That's a function of a couple different things. One, positioning, right, folks are really short or underweight equities. Two, base effects. When you've come down so much small moves higher tend to be higher percentage moves. That's just how the math works. And three, the companies are actually reacting to what they think was going to be a slowdown in macro conditions next year.
00:03:19.604 - 00:04:13.504, Speaker B: You had meta yesterday announced 11,000 job cuts. Today you've had Amazon announce a lot of cost cutting measures that are coming. So the market has a sense that these companies are going to be fiscally responsible. They're not just going to let their revenues and profits decline without at least trying to tackle it from the expense side of the equation. The combination of positioning, good fundamental news, that means the Fed has to be less hawkish. And you've had some pretty dovish Fed speak this morning as well. The highlight of that Fed speak is mainly in the context of they think that monetary policy is less laggy from a transmission mechanism perspective than originally thought.
00:04:13.504 - 00:04:58.698, Speaker B: The idea being is mortgage rates going to 7%. They might take six months, not eight months, to fully filter into the economy. So there's a bit of that going on. But high level, I think exactly where Powell told you you were gonna be, which is he told you at the Sep FOMC that they expected rates to go to four and a half percent. The last FOMC told you that given the data, we now expect rates to go beyond what we forecast in Sep FOMC. So where are you now? You're implying 485, which is 475% to 5% banned, which is exactly sort of where I think Powell told you he was at FOMC. Right.
00:04:58.698 - 00:05:26.342, Speaker B: But the risks in my head are still skewed to the upside. So right now you're just having a positioning like driven, like rally and sell off and other things. But fundamentally, this market is a market that's going to be driven by inflation. So we have to think about the factors that drive inflation. And one of the biggest factors is the labor market. And the labor market is still so strong. I mean, people have jobs, I get it.
00:05:26.342 - 00:05:33.646, Speaker B: You're seeing these layoff announcements here and there. But at the end of the day, the unemployment has barely nudged any higher.
00:05:33.710 - 00:05:38.334, Speaker A: Yeah, on a net basis, big number. The open job number went up.
00:05:39.114 - 00:05:43.466, Speaker B: Still way more job like. There's over 10 million job openings.
00:05:43.530 - 00:05:57.450, Speaker A: Right. And that deficit between the large amount of jobs that are open and the small number of people that are looking because they're already hired pushes wages up. Right? Absolutely. And that's a huge source. People feel wealthier when their paychecks are bigger. Rightly so. Absolutely.
00:05:57.450 - 00:06:04.078, Speaker A: And then they're willing to accept higher prices at the pump, at the store, at the, you know, at the bar, wherever, right.
00:06:04.166 - 00:06:05.582, Speaker B: Wherever it may be.
00:06:05.758 - 00:06:13.134, Speaker A: Which is one of these awful realities we've talked about. Right. The dual mandate from the Fed. Like, they're in direct conflict with each other right now.
00:06:13.174 - 00:06:44.982, Speaker B: And there's a third one, apparently, which is not to rock the boat on election day, but we can get into that later. In my head, though, it's really like when this kind of, like, price action happens, it's like, so counterproductive. It's like whenever rates rally like crazy and stocks go higher, that's going to help drive inflation higher. Right. It's like, okay, when Nasdaq's up 6%, and if people are, like, not as panicked about stocks, just like, puking lower, like they're going to spend more money.
00:06:45.038 - 00:06:46.662, Speaker A: There'S a positive wealth effect.
00:06:46.758 - 00:07:28.378, Speaker B: Wealth effect, exactly. To, like, huge holdings of, like, us consumers going up right. When the dollar sells off again, because now us interest rates and interest rate parity, like, they're going lower, that means our imports cost more. Right. That means when oil, in theory, is going to be higher on a dollar denominated basis, it's so counterproductive right now. And markets tend to get way ahead of themselves. I think what Powell spoke about last meeting is really what you have to pay attention to is what is the real risk for the Fed right now? Is it over tightening? Right.
00:07:28.378 - 00:07:46.202, Speaker B: Or is it under tightening? And what are you more comfortable living with? And I still think you should go into the over tightening camp. Right. Because the set of tools available that the Fed has to react to an economic downturn are insane.
00:07:46.338 - 00:07:47.474, Speaker A: Think about it this way.
00:07:47.594 - 00:08:46.624, Speaker B: Right? When we were cutting rates during COVID you cut rates from like 2% and change. So you only had 2% and change to go down in, and you bought $3 trillion of assets and 120 billion per month of securities thereafter. Now you're going to have 500 basis points that you can cut a much higher wealth base, and consumers have a lot more savings and feel a lot more wealthier. You're in a really strong place, and so you have the ability to over tighten without worrying too much about it because you can cut so much, you can go back to doing Qe. We know what happens when the fed turns dovish, and that is all. Asset prices rip. And the other thing to keep in mind is I genuinely don't know if we will get another asset bubble, like the one we just got.
00:08:46.624 - 00:08:55.788, Speaker B: It is literally the exact same as what you saw in 2000. You had meme coins, pet.com ripping to.
00:08:55.836 - 00:09:09.676, Speaker A: Insane, unprofitable meme stocks, homes selling within hours of listing. I heard. Yeah. I mean, selling in cash, property selling in cash, like 200k over ask. I mean, insane stuff, right?
00:09:09.780 - 00:09:20.172, Speaker B: Insane, insane, ludicrous levels of stuff. And so if you want to get back closer to an equilibrium, you're really going to have to, like, tighten material way.
00:09:20.228 - 00:09:43.092, Speaker A: Yeah. Your point here is they, they'd be better off over tightening than under tightening. Absolutely. Because if they screw up, well, if there's a hard landing, which, I mean, you know, if you over tighten, not just tighten, but let's say you tighten too much, then the implication is that the economy goes into a bad recession, then they can, they have tools for that. To your point. Whereas if they let inflation run away, it's very, very dangerous.
00:09:43.228 - 00:09:45.580, Speaker B: Oh, it's so dangerous.
00:09:45.692 - 00:09:46.384, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:47.004 - 00:10:22.260, Speaker B: But the other thing that I did leave out is a very obvious risk and one that everyone should be focused on, particularly in the context of what just happened in crypto, is financial stability. There's pockets of leverage, business models that just don't work. Once you get to super high levels of interest rates, there's a genuine concern for financial stability as you keep tightening and tightening financial conditions. You saw that with the bank of England when their bond market literally blew up. This is England. It's not like Paraguay or like, sometimes.
00:10:22.332 - 00:10:43.692, Speaker A: No offense meant to Paraguay, but a tiny, small country for. Correct. Yeah, no, you're right. Absolutely. Huge issue. Real quick, before we end, just broad thoughts on the crypto markets that now, I mean, obviously their CPI was beneficial. Like, the rise in risk that we saw today on Thursday was beneficial for bitcoin and ethereum and other assets.
00:10:43.692 - 00:10:52.190, Speaker A: But that's not the primary thing that's been moving crypto prices this week. I mean, what have you seen with the fallout in the market from FTX?
00:10:52.382 - 00:11:18.716, Speaker B: I think the key things are trust. That's really the only thing that matters in markets. I come from a trading world where I say done on a trade, that's it. You don't need. It's done, and it's good as gold as bond. But now it's like, who do you trust if you can't trust the guy that was advertising on the Super bowl that had Brady and Giselle and Steph.
00:11:18.740 - 00:11:21.804, Speaker A: Curry testifying before Congress?
00:11:21.884 - 00:11:54.174, Speaker B: Ah. I mean, the Forbes cover, who can you trust? Right, right. And so, you know, I definitely think that there's a huge lack of trust. And it's not just the CFA institutions, but it's defi as well. Right. You've had an insane amount of smart contracts exploits this year. When you throw that, if you think about it, you've lost a lot of trust in CFI institutions because a big one just went away.
00:11:54.174 - 00:12:11.294, Speaker B: Defi, you're not comfortable with the smart contract risk. You're just left with a very trustless investor base. But I think my key takeaway from that is that the future needs to be as decentralized as possible.
00:12:11.794 - 00:12:12.250, Speaker A: Right?
00:12:12.322 - 00:12:25.058, Speaker B: Like, I don't want to take counterparty risk anymore. In my head, at least right here, I might change my mind. But, like, it's like, I just want to know for sure. Like, that it's all rule based.
00:12:25.106 - 00:12:26.066, Speaker A: I mean, the way I think, the.
00:12:26.090 - 00:12:37.180, Speaker B: Margining is all rule based, and I'm guaranteed to get my stuff out, and it's in a blockchain that is likely not going to get exploited unless I do something stupid.
00:12:37.252 - 00:12:51.468, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, the way I think about this is that there's going to be centralized service providers. There's going to be c five in every market to be compliant, but they should be regulated and transparent. I mean, absolutely. This is where. But. And if you're not that, then you need to be fully decentralized. Right.
00:12:51.468 - 00:13:19.514, Speaker A: You know, it's been really surreal watching this happen while we're here at Galaxy one, of the only two publicly traded with publicly audited financial trading firms in crypto. Right. I mean, we. We are significantly more transparent by nature of being a publicly traded company than, you know, a buy side, you know, market maker like Alameda or. Or even basically any exchange on earth, I think, other than Coinbase. Right. So between.
00:13:19.514 - 00:13:27.802, Speaker A: I think you gotta be one or the other. I mean, you have to be transparent and regulated, or you've got to be fully decentralized. I don't think there's a middle ground.
00:13:27.858 - 00:13:30.330, Speaker B: I think you're 100% spot on Bim.
00:13:30.362 - 00:13:33.610, Speaker A: Net AbB galaxy digital trading. Thank you for joining us, as always, my friend.
00:13:33.722 - 00:13:34.934, Speaker B: Happy to be here.
00:13:36.834 - 00:14:28.708, Speaker A: All right, let's talk about the big news this week. FTX Alameda appears to be a huge blow up. It's been widely reported now on today's Thursday that in multiple outlets, the journal and Reuters have reported that client funds specifically were lent by FTX to Alameda, meaning funds belonging to depositors on the exchange, FTX International, Ftx.com dot, were sent to Alameda for some purpose. This is something that I think the crypto community over the last couple of days has come to assume there was a really, truly excellent analysis performed by a friend of ours and someone we respect a lot, Lucas Nuzzi, the head of labs at Coinmetrics. That thread was widely shared on Twitter. He found some on chain data that suggested significant flows from FTX to Alameda over the summer and at the end of the spring.
00:14:28.708 - 00:15:20.584, Speaker A: And the implication being that Alameda had some kind of blowup at the end, during the events of the spring with all the CFI lenders and all that stuff, and was, I guess, replenished in some way by FTX clients, unbeknownst to them. I will disclose, which has been disclosed already, Galaxy was a user of FTX in order to perform our trading business for our counterparties and clients. We have funds on many exchanges, and we manage that actively. We disclosed during our public earnings call on Wednesday that we had about 77 million of exposure on the FTX exchange. Literally, funds on the exchange that are currently not being processed for withdrawal. Right. And there's many others in this industry.
00:15:20.584 - 00:15:59.440, Speaker A: Some have been public, some have been, have said they have exposure. Very few have detailed it. And I will say, I think we're probably the most specific that has detailed it, and that's by virtue of us being a public company and having those responsibilities. I don't want to fully speculate too much what actually happened here, but there's a lot of key takeaways, I think, to talk about. It's, first of all, it's just very obvious that if there's a liquidity crisis at an exchange, that's not supposed to have any leverage itself. That means there's money missing. Right? So that's why people knew.
00:15:59.440 - 00:16:25.116, Speaker A: I mean, when withdrawals halted, in particular, it becomes very clear. This is a thing where you put your money on the exchange or your coins, and you want to swap them between things. Right? In the case of FTX, you could also do futures and other derivatives. The money is supposed to be sitting there, though, if you. Right, when you see a balance in this exchange, it's supposed to. It's supposed to be there. It's not supposed to be lent to some other party.
00:16:25.116 - 00:16:49.184, Speaker A: It's not supposed to be being used for speculation by an affiliated market making firm. Um, it's not supposed to be used for yield farming. It's not supposed to be doing anything. It's not even supposed to be sitting in treasuries. I think one time, uh, during this saga, Sam Bankman freed, when he was still claiming that all the money was there. Um, he said, we, we don't invest client funds, not even in treasuries. He said, well, treasuries would be bullshit.
00:16:49.184 - 00:17:43.908, Speaker A: Also, that money's supposed to sit there, as I deemed it, as a customer. And, you know, it's very, you can tell I'm very angry about this, because, um, of all types of blow ups in finance, this is the one major, the worst thing you can do if, if what we think happened, happened. Misappropriating client funds is the worst financial crime that can be done, as far as I'm concerned. And that's what it appears happened. Um, I mean, there was also, I mean, from a pure story standpoint, if we step back here and I'll talk about what I think the impact is on crypto markets generally, um, and, and the long, medium, and long term prospects for this industry in a minute. But when you step back and think about the saga that this has been, I'll just recount some of the timeline. So, on Wednesday of last week, Coindesk published a story, apparently having viewed a leaked copy of Alameda's balance sheet.
00:17:43.908 - 00:17:56.420, Speaker A: And it took. It's interesting. We all sort of looked at it. People that watch this industry were looking at it with peculiarity. It was kind of weird. It looked like they had no bitcoin. I don't think they had any ETH.
00:17:56.420 - 00:18:35.844, Speaker A: They had a ton of Solana. A lot of it was locked, a ton of FTT, FTX's own coin. And that's really where this, like, sort of all the fears really emanated out of this FTT position. So after about 24 hours, I think the market was digesting this. Everybody started to say, wait a sec, this balance sheet is super illiquid, right? They had something like what Coindesk had published, said something like 14 ish billion in assets against seven point something billion in liabilities, which were loans. Right? They had, they owed money. But the problem was the collateral listed on there was super illiquid, right? FTT is their own token.
00:18:35.844 - 00:19:15.454, Speaker A: It was very centrally owned. I forget the numbers here, and we looked this up a few days ago, but it's already past me. But a huge percentage of the FTT supply was owned by a very small number of entities, and it's primarily FTX Alameda, and then probably some huge users of FTX.com dot that. And it was Binance. Binance owned a lot of it, I guess by virtue of having been an early FTX investor, CZ, which they exited that position, that venture position, I guess, as part of the exit or something. They received something like $2 billion in FTT, which they've been holding.
00:19:15.454 - 00:19:48.594, Speaker A: So on Thursday, people started to really start talking about this balance sheet. And then on Friday, um, something like 23 million units of FTT, worth over $500 million at the time, was seen moving onto the exchange, onto binance. I think at the time, everyone's like, this is a huge. Especially for that coin. That's a huge amount of units, to be right. The assumption in on chain analysis when it comes to trading is that if something moves onto the exchange, it's likely to be sold, because you don't move it there and do nothing. Right.
00:19:48.594 - 00:20:08.650, Speaker A: And if coins come off of an exchange, you assume that they were purchased. Right. It's pretty simple. It's not always true, but it's a heuristic. So this was all over Twitter. The Whalealerts Twitter account had published this, which they do on an automated basis, and people started to speculate that this could be binance. Like, this looks like Binance.
00:20:08.650 - 00:20:46.034, Speaker A: There was actually a fair amount of speculation that it was binance. And then Czech on Saturday confirmed the CEO and founder of binance that it was binance. And the tweets were pretty cryptic. He basically said, it's not like because of anything in particular, but we manage our positions actively. And so we'll be dumping $2 billion of FTT. And he said he would do that over a course of time, such to not move the market. But of course, this caused, it's not clear whether he did do it over a nice period of time, but it started to cause panic about FTX in general.
00:20:46.034 - 00:21:48.314, Speaker A: FTT is this exchange token, which is in and of itself a sort of like a peculiar and nebulous type of toke, type of crypto asset that doesn't really exist in traditional worlds, these exchange tokens. But a lot of people, like, rightly or wrongly, look at exchange tokens as some sort of proxy for the health of the exchange itself. And FTT started trading down on Sunday. SBF and CZ started basically going at each other a little bit on Twitter. And I think part of the, there was an accusation made by CZ that it's not a good look. I forget the exact language, but it's not a good look when you're talking about talking with regulators and lobbying behind our back, binance against us. And I think there's probably, there was another tweet from Sam, actually, several weeks ago, Sam Bankman Freed, where they were saying, gosh, it's great if finance is going to get involved in Washington lobbying.
00:21:48.314 - 00:22:28.186, Speaker A: He can come to DC, right? Is what Sam tweeted. He's since deleted that tweet. The implication being like, I don't know, would CZ be arrested if he came to Washington? I mean, and so there's clearly was like some no love lost between these two guys, at least specifically around Sam's Washington lobbying efforts. That's what CZ said on Twitter. On Sunday, there were several. On Monday, FTX started to experience problems with withdrawals. Alameda was found on chain to have been removing assets from Defi protocols, as in like, withdrawing, gathering all their capital together.
00:22:28.186 - 00:23:01.342, Speaker A: They had, I think, a compound position. They wound down something in gearbox, which is like a generalized derivatives platform, I guess, or maybe lending. And so it looked like they were circling the wagons, right? So again, now, at this point, it's starting to be a little bit of a fever pitch. So on Tuesday, FTX halted withdrawals in the morning, and then no one knew what was going to happen. This is like, maybe it was like, 06:00 a.m. It was seen to halt six or 08:00 a.m. On Tuesday.
00:23:01.342 - 00:23:26.936, Speaker A: By eleven, however, both CZ and SBF tweet that there's a deal that they've signed. They've each signed a non binding loi for FTX.com to be acquired by binance pending due diligence. Now, Ftx.com is the big FTX. It's the international FTX. It's not FTX us, which is, as far as we know, a fully separate entity.
00:23:26.936 - 00:23:51.426, Speaker A: And again, I say that because we. We don't really know. I don't actually know. I think people are, given the ties between Alameda and FTX, you have to start wondering. Sure, it's not crazy to wonder if FTX us is involved in this, but I will say that FTX us, as far as we're aware, didn't never has halted withdrawals. So. And it would make sense for it to be different because that's the whole reason they made it thing, so that they could have a regulated us version of their exchange.
00:23:51.426 - 00:24:21.230, Speaker A: But anyway, that, that was explicitly not included in this supposed deal. It was. They both said specifically, FtX.com. And then we all waited to find out what would happen, and ultimately the next day. What is it now? Wednesday? So Wednesday, CZ backs out of the deal, and he basically says, it's too bad for us, it's too big, the hole is too big. Whatever it is, it's something. I forget the exact language, but we can't fix it, right.
00:24:21.230 - 00:24:56.494, Speaker A: It's beyond our capability to fix at this point. We start to get real reports, right? I mean, now we start to see the media is. First of all, the media was all over this on Tuesday and Wednesday anyway. There's not really much more news after that, except that we've gotten reports now that the whole. Could be 8 billion, I think Wall Street Journal says, which is just insane, because I'm pretty sure FTX had about 16 billion total in client assets. That would mean that they had lent half of their exchanges assets to. If it's Alameda, then it's to themselves, to.
00:24:56.494 - 00:25:52.034, Speaker A: It's to Sam's prop firm, like. But to be clear, they shouldn't be lending it to anyone. That's the, that's the real core point, right? This is custody. Um, it's not custody if you give my assets away, which is. It's just unbelievable behavior if that's true. Um, but we're in a spot now where we have the most prominent crypto advocate in Washington, a seeming wunderkind who built an empire out of nothing in two and a half, three years, who pledged, uh, to give $10 billion of his money away to charity over the next ten years, who had spent lavishly on political campaigns and advocacy, who believes supposedly an effective altruism, says that he wants to get rich so he can help the world, is extremely public, is on Twitter on a regular basis. You have this guy completely blow up his entire business.
00:25:52.034 - 00:26:45.812, Speaker A: And in this case, and unlike some others that have happened this year, but also, like some others, at the expense of his clients. And that type of misappropriation cannot go unpunished in any market. And I, you know, I don't know how this is going to resolve, but I will say that the crypto markets are going to be punished by this. And, of course, they have been on, you know, the liquid crypto bitcoin trade was at almost at 21k, traded all the way down to fifth in the think. Today, as we write, as we, as we record this, it's trading in the 17 six range, which is sort of like June lows when the three arrows capital situation happened. But we went below that already, which is pretty unsettling. But all the FTX linked projects and tokens, the Solana, which is linked because Sam Bankman fried had been a huge proponent of Solana.
00:26:45.812 - 00:27:23.888, Speaker A: I mean, it's not actually linked, as far as I know, in any way, which hopefully that. Which should be good for the Solana community. That there isn't actually, except that Sam owned a lot of it and promoted it a lot. Solana Serum. These other assets that are, which are, as an exchange on. On Solana, all down, crazy bad. I mean, I I don't even know where Solana is now, but after on Wednesday, when I last looked yesterday, Solana was trading down, like, 66% from its high over the weekend, um, which is when the Solana foundation had their, uh, breakpoint conference in Lisbon, which is, I'm told, a great conference.
00:27:23.888 - 00:28:13.436, Speaker A: Um, one of our guys, Sal Kadir, was there, said it was awesome, um, but a big fall. So markets are hurting because of this real breach of trust at what was seen as a core market infrastructure. And I will just add, too, I mean, I don't know exactly, but minor silver lining, I guess, for Americans, and I don't think it will go a long way when it comes to regulators and policymakers, is that this is mostly an offshore international exchange, not a US based, regulatory, regulated one. And so I think, you know, depending. I'm not going to name any other names, because I don't want to cause any issue, but if it were some other one, mom and pop would probably be hurting a lot more. I mean, it looks to me like this is a lot of professional traders and trading firms that primarily used FTX. So I don't know if that is a silver lining.
00:28:13.436 - 00:28:41.130, Speaker A: I mean, we're one of them, so we're pretty upset about it. But, you know, it doesn't seem like this was people dcaing in their. Their weekly paychecks at FTX, for the most part. But I, you know, I don't know if that's totally right, but maybe that's something. But for the crypto narrative, this. This is a huge, huge blow. Probably mostly because he now not the real narrative, certainly bitcoin and ETH unaffected, right? Like they're trading lower.
00:28:41.130 - 00:29:21.578, Speaker A: But for the institutional adoption of crypto assets as an asset class, this is a major setback, because, um, this is key market infrastructure. This is a guy who testified before Congress calling for regulation, saying that what happened, happened in 2008 and 2009, and traditional financial markets can't happen on FTX. He literally said that. Right. Well, honestly, this looks a lot worse than a lot of the stuff we saw happen in 0809. This type of misintentional appear, apparently intentional misappropriation of client money, and that it will be a setback for the crypto narrative in Washington. And it will be a setback, I think, for institutional investors.
00:29:21.578 - 00:30:02.790, Speaker A: A lot of. A lot of institutional investors, big allocators and pensions have, have invested into crypto through venture capital because the peculiarities of crypto assets make it harder for them to go directly into the asset. And this was a blue chip vc investment FTX. I mean, I'm not going to list all the folks who invested, but major pensions and some of the world's biggest investors. Um, and I will say one, because they reported themselves, sequoia was one, and they said they're marking it to zero. Right. And that I'm not, I haven't seen any of the FTX stuff, but, like, that seems prudent based on what we know.
00:30:02.790 - 00:30:23.558, Speaker A: Right. Or what we think and what we know. So that's a huge zero. It was last valued at 32 billion, I think, in their prior, their previous publicly disclosed financing. So that's a 32 billion to zero for those investors, which is rough. Again, these are the investors in FTX.com, the business, not the traders and users who deposit exchange stuff onto the exchange.
00:30:23.558 - 00:30:42.442, Speaker A: As we've already said, we're one of those. And we, people like us have withdrawals frozen. I don't know. We don't know if it's there. We know we can't get it right now. So anyway, I mean, I just want to. I've been in crypto and in bitcoin for a long time, and there's been a lot of stuff like this.
00:30:42.442 - 00:31:02.494, Speaker A: You got Mount Gox in exchange that also kind of did the same thing. Most people think they lost the funds, didn't steal them, because that's technically better than stealing them. There's Mount Gox. There was other exchanges have been hacked. There was the Bitfinex hack, and they found those. Razzle Khan, that's her name. I forget her real name, but that's her rap name.
00:31:02.494 - 00:31:37.742, Speaker A: She lived in an apartment in Wall street, was found to have had the 3 billion of bitcoin that had been stolen from Bitfinex just, just this year, which is just a hilarious turn of events in terms of who that was. But there have been a lot of things like this. But this one, given the prominence of FTX in Washington, I think in particular is the reason that it hurts so much and just how public he was. So look, I mean, that's all. We're going to bring on Tyler Williams from our public policy team to talk more about Washington. Also, we'll talk about the election. I do want to tell everyone there's been bad stuff.
00:31:37.742 - 00:32:00.974, Speaker A: This is bad. But, like, crypto is going to survive bitcoin and like ethereum and anything that's truly decentralized is going to survive. It's just that the narrative of the growth of this industry, like, we have to come out of this somehow. You cannot. You simply cannot let an exchange do this to people. It just can't happen. Right? So something is going to have to give.
00:32:00.974 - 00:32:23.058, Speaker A: And that's what I said with Bimnet a few minutes ago. We want a lot of stuff fully decentralized. We definitely do. Like, we take bitcoin, right? It doesn't work if it's not fully decentralized. It's essential. But if there's going to be service providers that are companies that operate in this space, like, this is. This is an exchange.
00:32:23.058 - 00:33:00.634, Speaker A: It's literally like the heart of finance. Imagine if the New York Stock Exchange stole all of your apple stock and lent it to someone. It's unbelievable, right? It can't happen. So, look, I'm proud at Galaxy that we are, I think, as far as I can tell, at least one of the two most transparent companies by virtue of our structure. And that's just going to be the way this has to go. This can't happen again, but it's going to be hard to bring the institutions back without something like that. This was seen to be one of the most trusted venues in it apparently was not.
00:33:00.634 - 00:33:38.742, Speaker A: So, hey, but again, bitcoin and ETH, they're here to stay. You know me, I'm a bitcoin guy, but I've come around on Ethereum as well, so those things are fine. Functioned as normal. So, you know, if you're stacking sats, you know, tick tock, next block, the blockchains are working, but we need some help here and we need transparency. Quick break for our listeners. The results from last week's poll. We asked, who do you think will win the ZK EVM race? More than half, 51%, said Polycon.
00:33:38.742 - 00:34:06.864, Speaker A: Zk evm. ZK sync came in second. Scroll came in third. This week, though, we're asking a different question related to FTX. And the question is, what portion of funds do you think FTX depositors will eventually get back from the exchange? All of it. More than 50%? Less than 50% or none of it? Hit us up on Twitter glxyresearch and make your voice heard. That poll is pinned to our profile.
00:34:06.864 - 00:34:24.054, Speaker A: Now back to the show. Let's go now to our friend Tyler Williams, head of public policy at Galaxy Digital. Tyler, it's been a crazy week in Washington. How are you doing down there, first of all, and great to have you back.
00:34:24.134 - 00:34:35.302, Speaker C: Thanks for having me back. I'm doing well down here. It's sunny. We're anticipating some rain from the hurricane coming in. So I think the mood is going to become even more dour than it is in Washington right now.
00:34:35.478 - 00:35:06.021, Speaker A: When it rains, it pours. Tyler. So the FTX situation, which we've been talking about throughout this podcast, it has a unique impact on, in Washington and on crypto policy. Given how active Sam Bankman Fried was in supporting legislation and working with policymakers, how public he was. What are you hearing down there? Has everyone been talking about it? Just what's been the reaction from your friends and people that you work with closely in Washington?
00:35:06.117 - 00:35:54.066, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it's totally consumed the airspace, and it's obviously consumed the airspace for me because I work in the digital asset policy making arena. But I think even withstanding the elections, it's been pretty much the constant theme of attention across all of my friends in Washington and across policymakers just because of how much the digital asset policy making community has grown in Washington over the past year and then the sort of traction that the industry has received over the past six months in terms of advancing legislation and building momentum behind ideas. So I think it's really consumed the airspace in addition to the election this week.
00:35:54.170 - 00:36:00.994, Speaker A: And are people angry? Are they bewildered? Like, how would you describe the reaction?
00:36:01.154 - 00:37:07.336, Speaker C: I think it's a little bit of both. And it's both in the sense that when you're a policymaker or when you're a staffer on the hill or a regulator and you're working to understand issue, a lot of times these, the issues and solutions to problems come up from direct advocacy from companies. Sometimes you hear them from their constituents. And, you know, if you're someone on Capitol Hill, like, usually what you try to do is look to identify an issue, create a solution to that problem, and then you want to tie it back to your local, state or congressional district that so you can have a positive message for solving a problem for your constituents. So now you have a problem on both ends of the spectrum here. You have constituents that feel burned. You have policymakers and staffers who feel burned from a perspective of working on an issue, trying to solve a problem, spending all of the dedicated time to get something done on a bipartisan basis, and you sort of have the rug pulled out from underneath you.
00:37:07.336 - 00:37:46.722, Speaker C: And oftentimes these ideas and solutions to problems, they can come about pretty quickly. And it takes a lot of work to build towards a consensus. And you'd seen that in both chambers, really in the authorizing committees from the Financial Services Committee and from the Senate Ag committee, where we've seen a lot of staff work that's happened, and principles from a. From senator level and from a member of Congress level being heavily invested in advancing and creating progressive solutions to problems in the digital asset space. And they feel as if this is another setback.
00:37:46.818 - 00:38:16.092, Speaker A: He was so active, and then so much had so much become the face of crypto policy in Washington. It's clear that people are burned. And I just want to play this video of SBF at a congressional hearing, and let's use that to set this up. There's a lot of videos out there of Sam Pinkman free that, especially knowing what we know now, are extremely cringe. But I'm going to play this one of Sam Hankman free testifying in Congress.
00:38:16.228 - 00:38:55.954, Speaker D: Last thing that I'll say is, if you look at what precipitated some of the 2008 financial crisis, you saw a number of bilateral, Bespoke, non reported transactions happening between financial counterparties, which then got repackaged and releveraged again and again and again such that no one knew how much risk was in that system until it all fell apart. If you compare that to what happens on FTX or other major cryptocurrency venues today, there is complete transparency about the full open interest. There is complete transparency about the positions that are held. There is a robust, consistent risk framework applied, and we're excited to work with the CFTC on our us license and regulated venue.
00:38:56.294 - 00:39:46.584, Speaker A: So, uh, I, you know, look, we don't know everything at all yet about this situation, but, um, we do know that there was not complete transparency. We do know it appears at FTX, and we do know that there was not a robust risk framework if the size of the hole in FTX's balance sheet is, uh, is as reported. So, Tyler, I mean, you're. If you're a staffer or. Or a member or a senator themselves, and you work with a wunderkind and he's a leader in the space of a new space, and your constituents are interested in the space, and you're interested in the space and you want to advance it, and you get a lot of support from this person on policy, and they're saying things like that, but then it turns out that they are perhaps the source of the problem, or one of them. I mean, how upset are you?
00:39:46.744 - 00:41:02.388, Speaker C: I think you're immeasurably upset by this and almost feel as if you were sort of duped, so to speak. And it reminds me of some of the historical crises that we've had. If you remember, prior to the zero eight crisis, it was very pervasive the impact that Fannie and Freddie had in Washington policy. And then you fast forward a couple years later and they're in conservatorship owned by the government. I'm not saying this situation and the facts were going to repeat to be the same, but it makes you feel if you're a policymaker, that the efforts that you were working on to enshrine the space, they are sort of all for naught. And I think you can end up having situations where this spurs legislative action and spurs regulatory action, but it can also set you back in terms of alienating the various supporters that you've worked so hard to build. And I think it's entirely the situation that in Washington, FTX and Sam Bankman freed were very prevalent in terms of Washington policy circles and testifying front of House congressional committees about the efficacy of their legislative proposals and so forth.
00:41:02.388 - 00:41:15.582, Speaker C: I think it's immeasurably how much this impact could have in the short term, and then how much rehabilitation needs to take place to re ingratiate and re ingrain yourself in terms of being credible stewards on behalf of the industry.
00:41:15.748 - 00:41:41.474, Speaker A: Yeah, it's clearly gonna be a big setback there in Washington. I think just broadly is what you're saying. Like our friends in Congress, the crypto industry's friends, I don't even mean that they're friends, but the people that are advocating for responsible regulation and policy, your fear is that they're gonna be not receptive any longer to crypto?
00:41:41.554 - 00:42:17.722, Speaker C: It's not necessarily a fear of them being not receptive. In some ways, I think it can help push policymakers and regulators to a position of really putting some tight guardrails around the space. So for those companies and those trade associations have been advocating for responsible regulation, we could see that almost advance faster. It just makes people who are pushing that agenda more weary and less likely to just take the advice and counsel of people who are in the industry themselves.
00:42:17.898 - 00:42:18.746, Speaker A: I see, yes.
00:42:18.810 - 00:42:44.342, Speaker C: So usually the old adage, and I think it was former chief of staff to President Obama, said, you know, never waste a crisis in a policymaking space like we are in sort of a crisis era. So in some ways, you could see it fast tracking legislation. It's just usually when that happens, the net impact of that law ends up being more punitive than it otherwise would have been.
00:42:44.518 - 00:43:11.498, Speaker A: Right. So let's talk about the election, which was anyone watching the election on Tuesday? I remember I normally am a big political watcher and love election day, and I didn't check the results until about 04:00 a.m. The next morning. So we were so fixated on the drama between, at the time, SPF and CZ from Binance. Um, what happened in the election this week?
00:43:11.626 - 00:43:36.758, Speaker C: Yeah, it was funny you say that. I obviously am in DC. I've worked in politics, policy and finance since 2011, and I went to a good friend's election party. It was just really like a small gathering of dinner, and everyone was talking about the FTX situation, despite it being filled with a group of lawyers, sort of policy people in Washington.
00:43:36.846 - 00:43:38.510, Speaker A: Not, not talking about the election that much.
00:43:38.542 - 00:43:57.126, Speaker C: No. Well, people were talking about the election, obviously. But this was a major theme. I think if you were like, to tick off the one, two, three themes, it was, it was in there, in the top three of, like, what people were asking about. And I think the other interesting thing is I was the only person who's in the digital asset space there. Everyone else was a lawyer or not.
00:43:57.150 - 00:43:58.502, Speaker A: Not related to crypto at all.
00:43:58.558 - 00:44:01.622, Speaker C: Yeah, not related to crypto at all, other than being in DC.
00:44:01.758 - 00:44:10.838, Speaker A: So what did happen on the election, though? It looks to me like it's mostly a wash, which is, I guess, a surprise to many in the media. But what's your take, and where are we?
00:44:10.926 - 00:45:03.774, Speaker C: Yeah, so, I mean, the balance of power is unknown right now, right. In the Senate, we still have a number of undecided races. So the balance of power is still in flux. In the House, there are a number of races that have yet to be called, but it looks like we're trending towards a republican house. So a change in the control of the House chamber. I think the macro themes, and this isn't shocking to anyone, is that it's viewed as Republicans largely underperformed in the environment. And I think that if you were a Republican expecting to take control over both chambers as sort of a repudiation on the president, typically what we've seen in past midterm cycles is that the party that's not in power has fared better.
00:45:03.774 - 00:45:53.822, Speaker C: That seems to be true for Republicans. It's just not as pronounced as people thought it would be. And I suppose I have a few key takeaways from it. And it seems like this midterm election cycle was largely about sort of abnormalities in both parties. On the democratic side, it seemed like the trends from an inflation level and from a consumer confidence level and from sort of the macro environments, from crime to the historic levels of drug overdoses, et cetera. That would be the driving thematic trends that would oppose Democrats. And on the republican side, you had some pretty staunch actions in the Supreme Court and those top line themes there.
00:45:53.918 - 00:45:55.086, Speaker A: Reproductive rights.
00:45:55.190 - 00:45:55.678, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:45:55.726 - 00:45:56.206, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:45:56.310 - 00:46:23.492, Speaker C: And then also just the looming thing that stands out is that the predominant figure of the republican party lost the presidential election, still serves as the key point person for the party. So it was largely about abnormalities. And to me, I can't remember the exact trend, but no. No president has won a reelection facing a major economic crisis since, like the thirties, basically.
00:46:23.588 - 00:46:24.076, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:46:24.180 - 00:46:38.124, Speaker C: And historically, in the midterms, we've seen, like, the off party win more. So it seems like this is a little bit of an anomaly of an election cycle, but anomalies are only relative to current history.
00:46:38.244 - 00:47:01.640, Speaker A: So do you think. So it's going to be tight, right? I mean, we don't know the Senate yet, but it looks like we could be headed for. We could end up right where we are at a 50 50. But even if Republicans can flip it, it'll be like 51 49 probably. Right. It's like barely. But if we assume that the House does go into the control of the Republicans, then we will flip all the committee chairs.
00:47:01.640 - 00:47:29.320, Speaker A: Right. The committees will become. Right. So, for example, if Republicans win the House, then Maxine Waters will become the ranking member on the House Financial Services Committee and Patrick McHenry will become the chair of the financial services committee. And these are the two members that had been working on that stablecoin legislation in House financial services, maybe with that as an example or anything else that makes sense, how would that impact crypto policy in your mind, if at all? Yeah.
00:47:29.352 - 00:48:32.698, Speaker C: So that's probably, like, the most under underscored thing here is that if and when the House does flip to republican, the margins by which it's going to do are much less than what we thought. And what that means is if you're the speaker of the House, presumably that's going to be Kevin McCarthy from California. When and if he comes in to be the speaker, he's going to have to manage a very tight margin. So the House is all governed by. Can you get to 218 votes in the House? And then there's a number of different protocols or ways that you can bring votes to the floor. What incoming presumptive speaker McCarthy has said is that he wanted to give a lot of deference to the committee chairs to work their will and for that to really drive policy. Having worked for a speaker before, that works if you have a large majority and then you can sort of have an incubation process that can lead to the development of policy to bring to the forest.
00:48:32.698 - 00:49:28.060, Speaker C: That is going to be much more difficult if you're managing, getting to 218 on a constant basis. And what I mean by that is if you're managing 218 members and their votes, it all comes down. Like everyone has birthdays, they have graduations, they have things to go to. And if you want people to show up to votes, you're going to have to have it be around pretty pronounced prominent things and, or you're going to have to get to a suspension level vote, which is basically getting to 300 votes for the entire House. So you have to do it on a bipartisan basis. So I think the incoming speaker is going, they really have to manage the committees in a more direct manner, and he's going to have to bring, he or she is going to have to bring bills to the floor that can garner either, like really large support of the entire chamber house, which is basically a bipartisan measure, or it's going to be really difficult to advance things.
00:49:28.172 - 00:49:40.460, Speaker A: So not likely then to have a huge impact, I guess, like whether it's Patrick McHenry or Maxine Waters in that specific example for something that particularly in this case was bipartisan. Right. I mean, do you think?
00:49:40.532 - 00:50:05.176, Speaker C: I would say it could have an impact, but it will be more incumbent on the authorizing committee leadership, such as Patrick McHenry, who's the presumptive incoming chair of the financial services committee. He is going to have to sell crypto policy as a caucus matter to the entire republican conference. And so there are these meetings that take place.
00:50:05.240 - 00:50:06.928, Speaker A: Oh, you mean even to get it on the agenda?
00:50:06.976 - 00:50:30.040, Speaker C: To get it on the agenda, yeah. And, like, he's really going to have to own that mantle. And you can do it from a couple perspectives. You can do it from an oversight perspective, or you can do it from, I know we can get this level of support from both parties, and this is a good way that we can demonstrate that we can work across the aisle and get something done for the american people.
