00:00:00.320 - 00:00:41.760, Speaker A: So developers have been calling Pectra possibly the largest upgrade in Ethereum's history. And that is because on the latest ACde call, developers included two new code changes into EOF and EIP 7702. Let's start with EOF. EOF we've talked about on this show before. It's a bundle of code changes. I believe it's now eleven different Ethereum improvement proposals, eleven different eips that are being implemented to enhance and improve the functionality of the Ethereum virtual machine. The virtual machine on Ethereum is what allows code of arbitrary complexity to be processed.
00:00:41.760 - 00:00:47.064, Speaker A: On Ethereum, it is the virtual machine that executes smart contract code.
