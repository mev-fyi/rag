00:00:00.200 - 00:00:37.826, Speaker A: I don't disagree. I think what you saw in March with the massive hysteria, or interest, rather, in meme coins, it tested Solana in a way that we've probably seen before, but before, it would just go down. This time, it stayed online the entire time, but the fees started to go really, really high. Where there was cases where you could be paying 20, $0.30. There was cases where you'd pay more than an ETH L two to land a transaction, and transactions weren't landing very consistently. And then you also see this massive rise in Mev activity on Solana. And so now validators are making their money on Mev.
00:00:37.826 - 00:00:45.050, Speaker A: They're not making money on commissions anymore. And so, to your point, that is absolutely converging with where ETH has been kind of this entire time.
