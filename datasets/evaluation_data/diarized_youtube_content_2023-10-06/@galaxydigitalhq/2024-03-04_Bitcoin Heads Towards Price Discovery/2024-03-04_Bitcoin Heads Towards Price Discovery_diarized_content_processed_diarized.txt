00:00:07.400 - 00:00:12.230, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:12.342 - 00:00:13.326, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:13.430 - 00:00:26.598, Speaker A: I mean, we are in the midst of a historic move right now, truly. I mean, it's. We're up. Bitcoin's up about 20% in three days alone. You can see over my shoulder, we're in the mid 62,063k, that's called. Apparently the block clock is a little.
00:00:26.606 - 00:00:28.798, Speaker B: Bit delayed at 63k here.
00:00:28.846 - 00:00:46.274, Speaker A: I mean, this is Mike Novogratz, the CEO of Galaxy tweeted this morning that we're effectively in price discovery. Now, I'm assuming he means that's because we weren't really above this level in 21 for more than a day or two or a couple of days. What are your takeaways from what you're seeing in the market?
00:00:47.054 - 00:01:13.394, Speaker B: I think this is a revaluation of the entire space in its entirety. I think folks are seeing the dramatic, um, flow figures from. From the bitcoin ETF's, and they're just extrapolating that forward. And when you start to extrapolate that forward on an asset that has supply that is going to be shrinking and demand that's apparently increasing.
00:01:13.514 - 00:01:13.858, Speaker C: Yes.
00:01:13.906 - 00:01:25.874, Speaker B: Seems the math gets pretty easy, and it's very easy for tons of folks to digest. And basically, now everybody that's ever bought bitcoin is in the money. Like, almost everyone.
00:01:25.994 - 00:01:26.962, Speaker A: Almost everyone, yeah.
00:01:27.058 - 00:02:16.838, Speaker B: And so that leads to this positive feedback loop of, oh, my God, price is up. Why? Because the thesis is really good. So just buy more. Price goes up, and you end up in this spiral of a positive feedback loop, and it just ends up sending the price higher. And now you've got the ETF bids to support this price action. And so I think this is, like Novo said, we are in price discovery mode, and I think you're going to be talking about bitcoin all time highs pretty soon, if not within the week, potentially at this rate. But it has been dramatic, and it is a deeply liquid asset class, and it has now been institutionalized by Blackrock and fidelity and Vesco and all of these places.
00:02:16.838 - 00:02:28.158, Speaker B: And now basically every asset manager on the planet is short upside in this asset because you have no justification for not being somewhat allocated anymore.
00:02:28.206 - 00:02:35.150, Speaker A: Yeah, they used to be able to say, well, we can't go to coinbase or we can't use a crypto exchange for our clients, but I mean, now, I mean, it's just a ticking clock.
00:02:35.262 - 00:02:37.446, Speaker B: When I'm a have fun staying poor.
00:02:37.630 - 00:02:45.750, Speaker A: If I have an advisor. It's so true. If I have an advisor, I'm calling up the phone being like, why aren't we in this? Right. And the reality is a lot of them can't get into it.
00:02:45.822 - 00:03:04.136, Speaker B: Exactly. And so when those floodgates open, you know, where's the price gonna be? So, you know, my price targets for bitcoin and ETH, you know, through year end are pretty high. North of 100k for bitcoin. And I'm thinking ETH can get through all time highs as well. Maybe 7000, 508,000 area.
00:03:04.200 - 00:03:04.804, Speaker A: Wow.
00:03:05.104 - 00:03:18.460, Speaker B: Because the ETTF narrative is gonna pick up now and, you know, you're gonna have lots of hiccups along the road. 1020 percent corrections here and there, but the trend is supremely evident.
00:03:18.532 - 00:03:18.692, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:03:18.708 - 00:03:27.340, Speaker A: I think in, I don't remember the number in 21, but in 2017 I believe there were 720 percent corrections on the way to all time high.
00:03:27.412 - 00:03:27.780, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:03:27.852 - 00:03:29.588, Speaker A: So, I mean, those are, that's a big correction.
00:03:29.636 - 00:03:29.940, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:03:30.012 - 00:03:44.300, Speaker B: And given where funding is and oi and leverage, the leverage profile in the crypto complex, you know, you are very susceptible to corrections. At the same time, like we're running out of sellers. I know there's a lot of buyers of this stuff.
00:03:44.332 - 00:03:54.428, Speaker A: It appears. I mean, I think we continue to be surprised. I mean, at this point now I'm condition to it, but the, the amount of inflows into these ETF's has been truly stunning.
00:03:54.516 - 00:03:54.964, Speaker B: Staggering.
00:03:55.004 - 00:04:10.068, Speaker A: Stunning. It took a little while to get going. At first there was a lot of internal capital. In the beginning it seemed a little lackluster for the first week or two. But I mean, now we've been looking, I think 21 of the last 22 days were inflows. And the one that wasn't was like minus like 30 million or something.
00:04:10.156 - 00:04:10.652, Speaker C: Nothing.
00:04:10.748 - 00:04:17.732, Speaker A: And we're reporting on way Tuesday. Yeah, Tuesday, Blackrock alone had 500 plus. It was their biggest day.
00:04:17.788 - 00:04:18.170, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:18.252 - 00:04:42.234, Speaker A: The complex overall, it was the third largest day. And then Monday, the day before had been the third largest day. So now it's the fourth largest day. So it just, the bid has been quite relentless. I guess the question that I've been asking, and I wrote about this a little bit today was, you know, we've never seen bitcoin perform at this level. At this stage pre having. So we're 52 days out from the expected having date.
00:04:42.234 - 00:04:51.016, Speaker A: The prior having bitcoin was down 60 over 60% from its all time high. At this stage pre having the one before was about 59%.
00:04:51.120 - 00:05:23.158, Speaker B: No model had the ETF flows though. That's the big difference, right? Like when you combine literally the most innovative financial product we've had in generations with the best capital market ever, right? You get the bitcoin ETF. And bitcoin needs no marketing. You don't need no Super bowl ads. Everybody already knows about it. And all people need to see is price going up to want to participate. And I just have, I'm just sitting here, you know, one, it's kind of shocking where we've come from.
00:05:23.158 - 00:05:29.638, Speaker B: I mean, I remember doing these podcasts with that block clock sub twenty k. I remember being very depressed, really, not that long ago.
00:05:29.686 - 00:05:29.990, Speaker A: A year.
00:05:30.022 - 00:05:49.362, Speaker B: It was a year and change. Yeah, maybe. But anyway, the point is, the people that haven't caught this, they feel fomo. The people sitting in lackluster assets like gold, pardon the pun, are probably like, man, am I allocated the wrong fee at the basement hedge right now. Probably.
00:05:49.498 - 00:06:05.914, Speaker A: I saw an analyst from a major Wall street research firm this morning on tv, straight up saying like, yeah, you know, with talking macro, nothing about crypto and just being like, yeah, for macro hedges, we talk about gold dollars and bitcoin.
00:06:05.994 - 00:06:06.378, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:06:06.466 - 00:06:15.130, Speaker A: And they were like, not treasuries, they were like, no, bitcoin's. He said, bitcoin appears to be a much better hedge against fiat debasement, much of that not a bitcoin.
00:06:15.242 - 00:06:25.202, Speaker B: And this is consistent across most of my macro conversations. Bitcoin is part of that macro narrative now, and it is not going away.
00:06:25.258 - 00:06:26.282, Speaker A: You can't put this back in the bottom.
00:06:26.338 - 00:06:27.442, Speaker B: The genie is out.
00:06:27.498 - 00:06:31.554, Speaker A: But it has been just in the last couple of days, it's felt a little bit parabolic.
00:06:31.594 - 00:06:31.746, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:31.770 - 00:06:35.922, Speaker A: It'd be reasonable to see some consolidation or like a near term correction.
00:06:35.978 - 00:06:36.170, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:36.202 - 00:06:41.418, Speaker A: I mean. Cause I mean, it's. I mean, it's been shocking. I think as we were recording, we just hit 64k.
00:06:41.506 - 00:06:41.866, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:06:41.930 - 00:06:48.334, Speaker A: We opened the morning at like, in the 58s. It's up $6,000 in one day right now, basically.
00:06:49.314 - 00:07:15.850, Speaker B: No, I think you'd be correct in saying that some consolidation would be healthy. Healthy, warranted, et cetera. However, I just keep thinking about the pools of money that are out there. And when you're talking about fractions of that, fractions of, fractions of that. It would send this thing well north of 100 even. And so it's just like, I get it when you think about the short term term.
00:07:15.922 - 00:07:16.058, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:07:16.066 - 00:07:18.810, Speaker A: What are we supposed to be like, guys, please stop trading and let us catch our base.
00:07:18.922 - 00:07:47.170, Speaker B: Well, it's like, wait, this is the ultimate fiat debasement hedge, and you don't really have it on for most people, something on, yeah. And so it's like. And people's size. So here's what happens. It becomes convex in terms of the idea and the feedback loop, but also in terms of the assets it gathers as it gets bigger, because bigger pools of capital can now start engaging in it. When something like ibit trades a billion dollars a day, when the CME futures start to pick up tons of volume. Right.
00:07:47.170 - 00:08:06.018, Speaker B: And when there's broader acceptance among macro types, that it's okay. It means that bigger and bigger pools of capital can now actually traffic in it comfortably, from explaining it to their investors, to boards, investment committees, et cetera, to actually genuinely position size.
00:08:06.066 - 00:08:33.786, Speaker A: I think you made the point in the past here that as the market cap grows and liquidity deepens, it can actually trade as an actual direct hedge. Not like I'll put on a million bucks or $10 million, but like, wait a sec, maybe I want to rotate out of like, this government debt position into this bitcoin, and we're talking billion dollar trades and stuff, which it's still a bit too small to, like point and click on a screen at any moment. But as it gets bigger, that bigger allocations become possible. They become, yeah.
00:08:33.890 - 00:08:34.466, Speaker C: So good.
00:08:34.530 - 00:08:39.482, Speaker B: And the more big people come in, the more dip buyers there are. And like, the higher this thing goes.
00:08:39.538 - 00:08:39.762, Speaker C: I know.
00:08:39.778 - 00:09:14.154, Speaker A: What do you think of this? I've been making the point recently that I think that, you know, longtime crypto market observers will know this quite well, that there tends to be this rotational aspect to the crypto market. December 17 bitcoin all time high. January 18 ETH all time high. March, March alt season. And that can happen at the total bull run level, but it also happens, like in little mini cycles as well. We saw it last fall. But part of my thesis about these ETF's is that they will dampen that intra crypto rotation trade because the bitcoin, that a lot of, so much of the bitcoin will be in these ETF's.
00:09:14.154 - 00:09:20.674, Speaker A: Maybe they're even more so if they're in advisor managed accounts. They're not sitting on crypto exchanges adjacent to altcoins.
00:09:20.834 - 00:09:27.082, Speaker B: But, but I'll tell you that you're right on that point, that the wealth of the bitcoin will stay in these margin accounts.
00:09:27.138 - 00:09:27.538, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:09:27.626 - 00:09:47.762, Speaker B: However, there is a broader wealth effect to these things. And so, you know, everybody that has bitcoin, like, if it's doubled, right, you just, like a small amount of cash moves alts around a lot. And so you definitely gonna see the follow on rotations and stuff even now with the ETF's because of just the.
00:09:47.778 - 00:09:49.722, Speaker A: Way, at least in repricing at a minimum.
00:09:49.778 - 00:09:50.106, Speaker C: Yes.
00:09:50.170 - 00:09:52.090, Speaker A: If not actual capital flow.
00:09:52.162 - 00:10:03.002, Speaker B: Correct. And what you have to also realize that prices get set at the margin. Right. And so you don't need like an insane amount of marginal flow to take some of these, like alts. And especially if you own a bunch.
00:10:03.018 - 00:10:05.506, Speaker A: Of alts and you most likely own some bitcoin.
00:10:05.570 - 00:10:05.810, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:10:05.842 - 00:10:09.978, Speaker A: So now you're just like. You're just raising your offer. Yeah, you're just like, I'm not selling it for.
00:10:10.026 - 00:10:10.858, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm not selling.
00:10:10.986 - 00:10:12.314, Speaker B: I don't feel the need to sell.
00:10:12.354 - 00:10:18.842, Speaker A: So even if the book's liquidity doesn't deepen from bitcoin rotation inflows, just the bid ask goes higher.
00:10:18.938 - 00:10:21.650, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. It's a fantastic time.
00:10:21.682 - 00:10:22.154, Speaker C: Being crypto.
00:10:22.194 - 00:10:39.026, Speaker A: This is going to be a very. I mean, this is, I would say the first we've said it, you know, as people who work full time in this industry several times over the last six months, you know, since the grayscale ruling, the DC circuit court appeals. But, you know, like, we're back, you know, and it felt like we were back today, I think, in my opinion, is the first day where I'm like, wait a second, this.
00:10:39.170 - 00:10:41.194, Speaker B: I remember retail feeling coming back.
00:10:41.274 - 00:10:41.442, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:10:41.458 - 00:11:09.858, Speaker A: I remember this feeling from the last bull market. I think it's important everybody stay humble. Yeah, I think it's important that, look, this is on the back of no FTX, no crypto margin futures. Is that like its lowest point ever? A lot. CME is over 25% of the entire bitcoin futures market is now cash collateralized CME. These guys aren't posting endogenous exchange tokens as collateral that are highly.
00:11:09.906 - 00:11:12.218, Speaker B: I'm not putting FTT on there to buy bitcoin.
00:11:12.266 - 00:11:12.618, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:11:12.666 - 00:11:18.712, Speaker B: So it's healthier, but it's just nice to have all these institutions that, the credibility that comes with this.
00:11:18.768 - 00:11:18.912, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:11:18.928 - 00:11:19.792, Speaker A: You're not crazy at all.
00:11:19.808 - 00:11:21.484, Speaker B: I'm not the crazy guy.
00:11:24.624 - 00:11:25.608, Speaker C: In a few minutes, I'm going to.
00:11:25.616 - 00:11:31.064, Speaker A: A big conference to talk about the bitcoin ETF's, and these are major tradfi allocators and investors.
00:11:31.104 - 00:11:31.280, Speaker C: So.
00:11:31.312 - 00:11:34.248, Speaker A: And it's. I'm not an oddity to be invited at this point. No, no.
00:11:34.296 - 00:11:39.472, Speaker B: You might be the most popular guy there today, showing up in your hoodie and the sneakers I'm going to put.
00:11:39.488 - 00:11:41.864, Speaker A: On a button, but that's the most I'm gonna do, though.
00:11:41.944 - 00:11:42.968, Speaker B: Okay, fair enough.
00:11:43.056 - 00:11:43.472, Speaker C: Bibnetta.
00:11:43.488 - 00:11:46.104, Speaker A: BB from galaxy training. As always, my friend. Thanks for coming on, Galaxy brains.
