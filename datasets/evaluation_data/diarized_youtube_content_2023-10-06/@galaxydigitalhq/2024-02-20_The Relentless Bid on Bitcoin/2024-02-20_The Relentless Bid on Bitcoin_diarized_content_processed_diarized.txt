00:00:06.760 - 00:00:11.558, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend bim netabeebeebeebi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains. Thank you for coming.
00:00:11.606 - 00:00:12.550, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:12.662 - 00:00:13.354, Speaker A: Wow.
00:00:13.774 - 00:00:14.342, Speaker B: Yes.
00:00:14.438 - 00:00:27.014, Speaker A: That's all I can really say. Wow. Speechless. Speaker two, I was looking at the. So over the weekend we ran up into 48, 49 territory. Monday we crossed 50. Then a CPI comes out, which we'll talk to on Tuesday morning.
00:00:27.014 - 00:00:52.216, Speaker A: All the risk comes off a bit. Bitcoin comes off, frankly less or finishes the day down less than equities, but you kind of get a Bart pattern. But then we just rock it right back up. And now we're at yearly highs again. I mean, what is it, 51 six over our shoulder, but it's been as high as 52, a little bit above 52. I don't know what that pattern is. The up, Bart down and then like rocket again.
00:00:52.216 - 00:00:55.360, Speaker A: I mean, what's going on with the relentless bid on bitcoin?
00:00:55.512 - 00:01:51.994, Speaker B: Just passive ETF inflows and they have been more than material and well above anyone's expectations. And then what's happening is folks are seeing these figures and then trying to front run or anticipate what future inflows are going to look like. And so folks are buying spot bitcoin, they're buying options, upside structures, fresh, all time high stuff, crazy. Um, and on top of that, you know, like S and P and Nasdaq are still only like a couple of percent off all time highs. The broader risk background, even with rates selling off after CPI, is still constructive and healthy. And so, you know, what you just have, what you're seeing happen is a ton of passive inflows into a product that has limited supply into a product that has a supply catalyst. Coming up in two to three months.
00:01:52.034 - 00:01:57.522, Speaker A: Is what happens when growing or massive demand smashes against immutable scarcity.
00:01:57.658 - 00:03:04.390, Speaker B: Exactly. And to be honest, for me, I look at the short term stuff a lot, but it's really hard not to think about the big picture implications now of just what will years and years of passive inflows, all these asset managers that now have bitcoin on their platforms, what the outcome of that is going to be, let's say 510 years from now in terms of bitcoin prices. And my mind has a hard time grasping that. I think it comes down to this concept, which is human brains are generally bad at understanding tail scenarios like 5% probability or, or less. And so thinking about bitcoin price going up 100, 200% is like, it's hard just functionally for the brain but more and more, I find myself in that area, and it's the first time in a while where I wake up and I'm scared that bitcoin's run away from me before I've gotten a chance to accumulate more.
00:03:04.462 - 00:03:26.618, Speaker A: I know I woke up. This was a common feeling during the 2020 and 21 to bear bull market when it was like, even in 17, I remember this, too, is like, you'd wake, like, wake up during that market and be like, what happened while I was asleep? And first thing you look at your phone and there were days where it's just like, up two, three, five, 8%. When you wake, you're like, what happened?
00:03:26.706 - 00:03:41.210, Speaker B: No, I mean. And you're like, I wasn't bullish enough. Take, for example, sailors flows. You know, when he's buying and he's buying, you know, he's buying like a yard over like a month or two months. And the ETF inflows are like a yard in three days now.
00:03:41.282 - 00:03:42.594, Speaker A: Yeah, that's wild.
00:03:42.634 - 00:03:47.402, Speaker B: And the math is just like, the supply is just getting taken out of the market.
00:03:47.498 - 00:04:13.976, Speaker A: Yeah, I think you said it earlier. Really, a lot of no one. Well, not no one, but a lot of people in this short time period really did not expect this. I think everybody is kind of frankly, blown away by the magnitude of the ETF inflows. We had thought, and we talked about this, that like, you know, after the initial, like, seed in internal capital went in, there was a period where we were, like, struggling to see, like, you know, we didn't think the advisor platforms were going to turn on yet. They still haven't. Right.
00:04:13.976 - 00:04:29.776, Speaker A: We didn't. The having was still three, four months away. Right. Sort of like struggling. And we talked about this. And, I mean, Bitcoin did go down to 38 five. I think we thought, I thought at the time that it would go a little lower and stay there for a little longer.
00:04:29.776 - 00:04:40.712, Speaker A: But then over the last 22 days, it's up 35%. And now it's like these ETF's are mostly being bought on retail brokerage platforms.
00:04:40.768 - 00:04:41.008, Speaker B: Correct.
00:04:41.056 - 00:04:45.464, Speaker A: Not just by small dollar retail investors. Big investors can go there, too.
00:04:45.584 - 00:04:51.568, Speaker B: And you're going to see those which big investors bought because of 13 f filing for the first time.
00:04:51.616 - 00:04:52.484, Speaker A: Yeah, one of those.
00:04:54.504 - 00:04:56.644, Speaker B: March April area.
00:04:56.994 - 00:05:16.618, Speaker A: So it's like we, we had sort of said like, it feels like a crab market until the, like, the platforms really turn on the access to these vehicles. And then, and then obviously it's bullish. So we're sort of like, it's crab to bullish. But now you're looking at these flows and saying, wait a sec, is, is like the baseline a lot more bullish. And then what happens if it gets really bullish?
00:05:16.746 - 00:05:47.410, Speaker B: Exactly. And it's also a function of just that positive price convexity and the positive like price feedback loop where it's like, oh shit, bitcoins. Price is going up. Why? People ask why? And they come to the conclusion it's these ETF inflows. And then they do the math. They're like, holy shit, this could go a lot higher. And then the price keeps going higher and more and more folks buy into the rationale and becomes this spiraling feedback loop real quick.
00:05:47.442 - 00:05:53.536, Speaker A: Just on CPI, it came in, I guess the analysts were saying it came.
00:05:53.560 - 00:06:32.124, Speaker B: In hotter than expected. And the Fed's measures of, the Fed's preferred measures of super core CPI were also really hot. There were some seasonal elements to it. This was a January print. And there's a lot of year end price hikes that get processed in that data. And so it might be a little distorted, but overall, it doesn't seem like the Fed got what it needed to really get more aggressive in terms of easing or the language around easing that has shaken markets a little bit. And the fallout from that is still to be determined because you still have a lot of data between now and the March FOMC meeting.
00:06:32.124 - 00:07:04.054, Speaker B: But long story short, you've seen a dramatic repricing of the interest rate market over the past, since the start of the year, where you've priced out a ton of cuts and you're now much closer to what the fed expects in their dot plot, at least, which is two to three cuts. And so now you're kind of getting to the sweet spot where it might actually make sense that things go back the other way because I don't think we're in a hiking cycle again, but I think it is still appropriate to kind of.
00:07:05.074 - 00:07:11.174, Speaker A: Okay, well, Bim Nadabe, my friend from Galaxy trading, thank you as always. We'll let you get back to the desk. Awesome. Thank you.
