00:00:00.090 - 00:00:02.074, Speaker A: Yeah. Nfts, my favorite new topic.
00:00:02.122 - 00:00:04.926, Speaker B: I'm so obsessed, too. I'm spending a ton of time on.
00:00:04.948 - 00:00:28.962, Speaker A: This in my own brain for people that don't know what nfts are. Right? Non fungible tokens. These are one of the great parts about the whole crypto space, the blockchain space. Satoshi's white paper is that it was the first digital signature that you couldn't counterfeit. So think about what that means. You can make digital art that no one can counterfeit. And so all of a sudden, art gets its value from scarcity.
00:00:28.962 - 00:00:50.762, Speaker A: And so the blockchain allows you to do that. So now we're going to see artists, for the first time ever, create art digitally. Right? The great artists, they never did before. So you're going to sell digital art, you're going to actually take your phone, you're going to buy it, it's going to go down your phone, you're going to walk home and you're going to throw it up on a giant screen and you're like, that's mine. No one else owns that thing. That's mine. And so we're going to have collectibles.
00:00:50.762 - 00:00:54.638, Speaker A: They're going to create new collectibles. There's going to be, instead of baseball cards that are.
00:00:54.644 - 00:00:56.394, Speaker B: Well, there's NBA, Topshop. They're so rare.
00:00:56.442 - 00:01:01.594, Speaker A: Top shop blowing up all of a sudden, looking at it every day. And so then they're going to be fractional things that get sold.
00:01:01.642 - 00:01:14.690, Speaker B: Well, that's what's happening. The fractionalization of physical things is a game changer. The reason Michael Jordan's rookie card is going to a million dollars, because you can sell 100. Cover act. Yes, because Kenny and Stefan actually want it. I know them. They do.
00:01:14.690 - 00:01:18.354, Speaker B: But they're not dropping 350,000 on a single sports card.
00:01:18.392 - 00:01:18.882, Speaker A: Not yet.
00:01:18.936 - 00:01:19.314, Speaker B: Not yet.
00:01:19.352 - 00:01:20.082, Speaker A: Not yet.
00:01:20.216 - 00:01:33.020, Speaker B: And I know them. But would they drop $350 if they knew it was going to a million? That's no different than buying a little Tesla and Apple stock. The fractionalization of sports cards is going to get that market insane on the tippy, tippy top.
00:01:33.550 - 00:01:38.838, Speaker A: And you're going to fractionalize jerseys, you're going to fractionalize cars, you're going to fractionalize all kinds.
00:01:38.854 - 00:01:39.834, Speaker B: Yeah. Memorabilia is going to follow.
00:01:39.872 - 00:01:42.810, Speaker A: But even bigger than that are going to be these nfTs. You're going to have.
00:01:42.960 - 00:01:43.578, Speaker B: I agree.
00:01:43.664 - 00:02:04.274, Speaker A: The Super bowl. We're going to have my homes, and I'm going to have an artist do a painting, a digital painting of him and a rapper, sing a little song behind him, and then he's going to be up there, and you're going to sell that little clip from the Super bowl done by chase hall or whoever the artist is, and people are going to be like, dude, there's only ten of those. And they're going to buy them and they're going to keep.
00:02:04.312 - 00:02:46.370, Speaker B: I think people need to know how to showcase them. The missing piece, just for the record, because I want to clip this one day and say, you know how I like to do my content? In nine years, I'll clip this and be like, see? Told you. You're 100% right. In one other man's humble opinion, why artworks is high net worth. Individuals buy a piece of art, and whether they put it in a moroccan warehouse, or whether they put it in their Upper west side apartment, or whether they have a show that they donated to something, they're able to display it. The reason sports cards are is because you take a selfie and put it on instagram. We love to flex.
00:02:46.370 - 00:02:52.834, Speaker B: I'm waiting to understand the flexivization of the NFT, and as soon as I.
00:02:52.872 - 00:02:55.170, Speaker A: Understand it, it's coming.
00:02:55.240 - 00:03:02.246, Speaker B: Oh, I'm the least confused of all time. I'm curious what it's going to be. I want to invest in it because it's going to be the shovels and picks of that world.
00:03:02.428 - 00:03:07.622, Speaker A: We have a galaxy interactive fund that's invested in 40.
00:03:07.676 - 00:03:08.294, Speaker B: That's the name of it.
00:03:08.332 - 00:03:09.202, Speaker A: Galaxy interactive.
00:03:09.266 - 00:03:11.686, Speaker B: What are you all about?
00:03:11.708 - 00:03:15.338, Speaker A: The galaxy star. We're more Star wars people than Star Trek people, too.
00:03:15.344 - 00:03:19.046, Speaker B: I see the booba fact. Big shout out to that. Rito is underrated.
00:03:19.158 - 00:03:26.894, Speaker A: But we invest in 40 companies in the gaming space, new worlds, probably a third of them. They're already playing with these things.
00:03:27.012 - 00:03:53.270, Speaker B: We are, no question. Because we're now 30, 40, depending on how you want to look at it, years into the modern Internet. Really? 30? In my opinion, it's the biggest technology that has ever happened in the history of life, outside of things like fucking fire. And the printing press is the one that I keep going back to. Television, phone, fine, but this is like printing press 10.0.
00:03:53.340 - 00:03:56.040, Speaker A: Every piece of our life is every change, correct?
