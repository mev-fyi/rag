00:00:00.680 - 00:00:03.638, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, an infinite amount of cash.
00:00:03.734 - 00:00:04.366, Speaker B: Cash.
00:00:04.518 - 00:00:17.662, Speaker A: I'm your host, Alex Thorne. The us banking system is sound and resilient. Bitcoin made a new all time high. If you're not long. If you're not long, you're short. Satoshi's gonna come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet.
00:00:17.766 - 00:00:19.526, Speaker B: All bitcoin's gonna be erased.
00:00:19.718 - 00:00:20.398, Speaker A: Bitcoin.
00:00:20.494 - 00:00:24.850, Speaker B: Bitcoin's the best crypto else. Bitcoin is going to zero.
00:00:25.680 - 00:00:50.888, Speaker A: Welcome back to Galaxy Brains. Bitcoin, not zero. I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firm wide research at Galaxy. Thank you for listening. We have a great show for you today. Leor Lamesh, CEO and co founder of GK eight, is our guest here by popular demand, and we're going to ask Lior to explain what NPC is, what it means to self custody crypto assets if you're an institution. We'll also talk with Lior about GK eight's interesting work in the tokenization space.
00:00:50.888 - 00:01:10.232, Speaker A: But before we get to that reminder, please refer to link to disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Let's get right into the show. Let's go now to our guest, Lior Lamesh, co founder and CEO of GK eight. Lior, welcome to Galaxy Brands.
00:01:10.296 - 00:01:12.784, Speaker B: Thank you so much. It's a pleasure being here.
00:01:12.872 - 00:01:30.800, Speaker A: Yeah, it's great to have you. We've had a lot of requests to have you on. I guess for background, even before we get into what GK eight does, how did you come to be part of the Galaxy Galaxy family? For the audience, GK eight is a Galaxy business unit now, or a subsidiary. I'm not sure the technical language.
00:01:31.780 - 00:02:31.850, Speaker B: Well, so we've been through an interesting journey. I believe, you know, we started back in 2018, I think I shared with you last time when we hacked one of the most popular cold wallet in the market, and we learned that there is no true cold. So we can come up with our unique technology to make a blockchain transactions without being connected to the Internet. But long story short, since then, we build a company, and after three years, we've been acquired for the first time. And then things happen and we've been acquired again. And we're very proud to be part of Galaxy for over 15 months right now. We're very proud and exciting about the opportunity of being part of strong super house where we can leverage our unique technology and product capabilities, along with Galaxy impact on the market that we truly believe that it's like one plus one equals three.
00:02:31.850 - 00:02:45.014, Speaker B: By leveraging these two powers, the technology that we build and the business implication that the galaxy bring to the market to build together something stronger than before.
00:02:45.102 - 00:03:14.200, Speaker A: I think so there's clearly a synergy, I think, well, you're a security company at your core, and I'm gonna set this up, but I'm gonna ask you to explain. You provide technology to help. I'm gonna say entities or persons or businesses. I guess that's what entities are. Custody digital assets. What technology do you offer? And we'll get into the differences between various types of custody technology, but maybe start at a high level.
00:03:14.290 - 00:04:07.750, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So we are partnering with either traditional financial institutions that are not yet to blockchain or with existing crypto companies, institutions. Crypto companies that already in blockchain, we're providing them with our platform. And by using our product, they can offer different types of services, either custody, staking, defi tokenization, NFT custody, or basically any business logic. Because the underlying technology that we do is secure private keys management solution that including different type of management capabilities of wallets and policy engine and the tokenization engine. So basically any business case, and there are so much, the market is so dynamic, can be built on top of our platform. And yeah, we are partnering with large organizations that managing billions of dollars with our solution from both types of families that I just mentioned.
00:04:09.820 - 00:04:15.788, Speaker A: At the core. Should I think of you as a custodian, you're not a trust company, right?
00:04:15.884 - 00:04:16.548, Speaker B: Of course.
00:04:16.684 - 00:04:27.068, Speaker A: What's the difference between, say a normal custodian where they have some tech that they use, but you just give them your assets versus what GK?
00:04:27.244 - 00:04:44.398, Speaker B: It's a great question because there are a lot of confusion in the market over the years. So let's start with standardization. Fiat assets, I would say. Right. When you do custody for traditional assets, you need like a bunker and maybe army around it to protect the assets. Right.
00:04:44.454 - 00:04:48.094, Speaker A: That's the whole thing with the bank. Right. The banks are always these big stone buildings.
00:04:48.222 - 00:04:48.750, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:04:48.830 - 00:04:53.366, Speaker A: I think they probably look more imposing than they actually are nowadays, but. Yeah, exactly. Armored cars.
00:04:53.478 - 00:05:11.534, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. And it's needed because it's, you know, like physical assets. Right. But when it comes to blockchain based digital assets, what you need to protect is the private keys. Right. So you don't necessarily need this physical protection around it. You just need the most secure way to manage and protect these private keys.
00:05:11.534 - 00:06:02.346, Speaker B: So the market of blockchain digital assets. Custody are either based on self custody and managed custody. Self custody means that institutions can license technology, like GKA's technology, and by license our technology, they can do their business by themselves without relying on third parties on holding their private keys, which is their assets. In other words, while there is second option, which is working with third parties, that are the managed custodians, they hold the private keys for you, and they provide you different kind of services based on that. So these are the two options when you work with managed custodians. On the one end, it's easier because you can get up to speed faster. You don't need to operate things on your own, but on the other end, you're exposed to third party risks.
00:06:02.346 - 00:06:55.168, Speaker B: We all seen that, especially in light of the 2022 events, that a lot of crypto companies, that should be their specialty, being a bit reckless, and a lot of people pay the price. And I think that the future is that institutions will control their own destiny, especially thanks to the difference between custody for digital assets compared to traditional assets. So when you do self custody, the assets are accessed to you 24/7 you're not exposed to third party risks. While you own the infrastructure, you're also flexible with the services that you could offer down the road, because it's within your ends and you're not relying on what other parties would let you do or not. So we enable companies to do self custody. We providing them with our technology so they can do what we believe that blockchain meant to be to enable them.
00:06:55.184 - 00:07:13.728, Speaker A: To do it makes a lot of sense. And when I think about an individual doing self custody, typically what we're talking about is a hardware wallet, right? So I could have. I love the cold card from. From coinkite. They make the block clock also. But a ledger, a trezor, a foundation devices, or whatever other ones there are. Right? That's.
00:07:13.728 - 00:07:18.920, Speaker A: You guys aren't sending ledgers to institutions? Like, what is the technology that they're actually getting from you?
00:07:19.040 - 00:07:19.700, Speaker B: Right.
00:07:20.600 - 00:07:26.024, Speaker A: Is it like a hardcore. I mean, we're talking about servers or bare metal? Like, what is it that they're actually getting?
00:07:26.152 - 00:07:44.900, Speaker B: Right. So. Well, I can get it into multiple places. I think it's. You know what? Let me take a few minutes to explain the background, and then I will get into it. So blockchain should be secure, right? It is secure. It's decentralized data structure.
00:07:44.900 - 00:08:17.630, Speaker B: And in order to hack the blockchain, you need to hack too many places, and it should be impossible. But the keyless heel of blockchain is the private keys, because if someone is possessing your private keys, it can make a transaction on your behalf and steal your money. And the difference between blockchain to the traditional banks data structures is that blockchain is irreversible. Right. It's immutable protocol. And that's what makes it more appealing target for hackers to possess these private keys. Now, wallets is the device where you need to hold these private keys.
00:08:17.630 - 00:08:30.002, Speaker B: So, basically, when it comes to institutions, compared to consumers, they need to have the most secure solution to all the private key, the most secure wallets. Let's call it that way to simplify it.
00:08:30.026 - 00:08:32.906, Speaker A: The software, the tool that actually holds or manages the keys.
00:08:32.938 - 00:09:19.370, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. So they can do their business to meet their internal procedures, their control, their regulation requirements, compliance requirements, and still being able to do it in the most secure way possible. Now, hacking is a business, right? How much hacker will invest to compromise into a bank or a crypto exchange? It depends how much you can get. It's about ROI. And hackers will invest millions to steal billions. So when it comes to consumers, they don't necessarily have the tens or hundreds or billions of dollars. So the solutions that you mentioned before might be sufficient, right? But when it comes to institutions that need to manage tens, hundreds, billions of dollars of their own nostalgia assets or their clients assets, they need to have the most secure solution.
00:09:19.370 - 00:10:12.328, Speaker B: Based on our experience, it's safe to assume that around $1 million, the metric that we used to work for the government, as you know, protecting the strategic assets of the country from cybersecurity attacks. So a metric of $1 million of what you have to invest in order to compromise one public Internet connected computer, which is where the blockchain is, is what you need in order to compromise. And so that's why to hack an odd wallet, you don't need that much money. And the solution out there are either hot wallets, like that, or the more advanced hot wallets, such as multi signature or MPC. And in this case, you have, like in multisig, you have multiple keys. Each of them is based in different Internet connected computer. Or in MPC, you have one key that's splitted into multiple parts, each of them located in the different Internet connected computer.
00:10:12.328 - 00:10:47.964, Speaker B: So what you need to do, basically, as a hacker, is to compromise, like, three Internet connected computers. And then you possess all of the keys that you need in multisigor, all of the shards of the key that you need in MPC, and then you can steal money so the ROI for hackers to invest these few millions in order to potentially again steal billions is valid. And that's what they will do with either multi seq solution, MPC solutions, odd solutions, and also with cold solutions that not really called. Right. Started our journey by hacking one of the most popular cold wallets. Because they weren't really cold. At some point they received input from the Internet either.
00:10:47.964 - 00:11:24.728, Speaker B: If you use micro USB cable or thumb drive to get information from Internet connected computer to another computer that's supposed to be offline, or QR code and camera or other HSM connected solutions. So they are all at some point receive input from the Internet. And this is the one thing that makes cold becomes hot. So that's what we realized. And we came up with the first true cold vault that can make the full process of creating, signing and sending blockchain transactions without ever being connected to the Internet. So this is the first part of our solution. The deep cold vault.
00:11:24.728 - 00:11:53.340, Speaker B: The true cold vault. We pair it with MPC, but for the automated day to day transactions. And our clients, by using our product, can manage the risks accordingly. Right. They can make. They can put the majority of their assets in the cold vault for either long term custody or transactions of a large amount of money and smaller percentage of their assets in the NPC for the day to day automated transactions. And that's how we change the equation for hackers.
00:11:53.340 - 00:12:23.456, Speaker B: The ROI will not be valid anymore for them to invest few millionth wide. They will be able to earn less than debt on the assets sits on the NPC, while the assets that sits on the cold cannot be hacked because our cold vault never receive input from the Internet. So not exposed to any cybersecurity attack vectors. So this is the philosophy of hackers. That's what the existing solutions in the market are and how they can be hacked. And that's how we tackle these issues with our approach.
00:12:23.648 - 00:12:43.380, Speaker A: Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. I mean, I did some work in my prior career. I was a forensic investigator. And I recall that, yes, most security cybersecurity is about raising the cost of the attack. Right. It's theoretically like everything could, you know, with enough time and computation access, theoretically anything could be hacked. It's about making it really difficult.
00:12:43.380 - 00:12:49.760, Speaker A: I can see how sharding or doing multisig threshold cryptography increases the cost. Right? You're separating it.
00:12:50.420 - 00:13:42.000, Speaker B: They mitigate the risk, but they're not solving the issue. Right. And if you can not be exposed to cybersecurity attack vector, which is how it's called that you never receive input. So even if you have vulnerability, it doesn't matter how much budget you have to try to find a vulnerability, you will not be able to exploit it because there is no way in. That's exactly the different approach that we're bringing to the table when we see that market continue to grow and large organization transferring their traditional assets to be digitalized and based on blockchain. If they will not use the most secure technology to do that, for example, in tokenization use cases, they will be in a huge risk and it reduces the trust. And I think that's what we all looking to have and trust should be the foundation of what we build here over the blockchain.
00:13:42.000 - 00:13:46.260, Speaker B: So we truly see that as the enabler for the future.
00:13:46.380 - 00:14:26.790, Speaker A: So let me ask you about the cold vault technology, because my understanding you can certainly generate in one way or another keys without ever you have software that generates bitcoin addresses. That's totally possible and they never plug in. So you're in a Faraday cage, you take the Wifi card out of your laptop, right? Like there's no connect bluetooth stomp on it, right, whatever. It's kind of like what the famous story about Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. They generated their keys offline, the ones that they eventually did. A primitive form of sharding, sort of like a shamir secret sharing scheme where they separated them eventually in all those bank deposit boxes. So they did this on a computer and then they famously smashed the computer with a sledgehammer.
00:14:26.790 - 00:14:46.976, Speaker A: But then if I do want to send out of that cold vault. So I've got a billion dollars and client wants. I'm a fund and the client wants to redeem some money or I'm a proprietary person, I want to sell some. How do you transfer the signed transaction to effectuate the movement of the funds on chain from that vault if it's never connected to the Internet, right.
00:14:47.008 - 00:14:57.510, Speaker B: So first the challenge is by creating the transaction. When you create the transaction, that's where you need to go online because there are some mandatory information that you need to put a in the transaction structure.
00:14:57.590 - 00:15:00.654, Speaker A: Before you can sign receiving address and whatever else.
00:15:00.782 - 00:15:24.986, Speaker B: Exactly. And receiving address is something you can do yourself. The problem is with other type of data that you need to take from the blockchain and you cannot do it by yourself. And that's where you need to have input and output with Internet connected computer. And that's what exposed your code to not be called anymore. And that's exactly what we solve with our patent. So we solve that and what we, that's how we started.
00:15:24.986 - 00:15:44.930, Speaker B: And from there we understood that by doing that, we use outbound unidirectional communication only. And we build different cryptography protocols around it to achieve the needed functionality, like you just mentioned, without compromising security. So we have the ability to send assets remotely from the cold vault without even attending the cold vault facility.
00:15:45.010 - 00:15:51.778, Speaker A: So what did you say that you said, you said unidirectional outbound communications. Is that a wire? Like, what is that? What does that mean?
00:15:51.874 - 00:16:18.710, Speaker B: It's like unlike like having like a cable that has input and output. If we avoid the need to receive input and we use only output, we can use like on the physical level, something that, like a cable that sends electricity and data only one way. So the call Volt even can tell that something is connected to him. So there is no even micro potential attack vector. I mean, there is no any kind of input. And that's exactly what the whole story is about.
00:16:18.790 - 00:16:22.520, Speaker A: It is really like a one way wire. It is a one way wire that is super interesting.
00:16:22.590 - 00:16:40.108, Speaker B: Definitely. And it's, you know, one way wire exists in the market as a technology in general, but the innovation here is our cryptography that enabling us to do the process without ever need to receive the. We can leverage this existing, you know, off the shelf physical cable thanks to the cryptographic and software.
00:16:40.164 - 00:17:11.220, Speaker A: I'm assuming you're not about to explain that cryptography in detail. To me that sounds like it might be proprietary. Can we, can we go back a little bit too, because we're talking about NPC and Multisig and I think particularly bitcoiners and also people that use formerly gnosis, but like safe on Ethereum, a lot of daos use multisig bitcoiners. Multisig is gratefully a native bitcoin network feature. It's not really a native Ethereum feature. You have to use smart contracts to create that. So people are very familiar with that.
00:17:11.220 - 00:17:33.705, Speaker A: It's threshold cryptography. I can say these funds can only be moved if two of three of these private keys sign or three of five. Five of seven. Or in fact, taproot, I think now on bitcoin allows you to do maybe not arbitrarily, but maybe a hundred signers, quorums of 100. But anyway, you can create. Very interesting that combined with like policy. You mentioned a policy engine earlier.
00:17:33.705 - 00:18:06.040, Speaker A: I think I know what that is too, but that might be a little bit deeper than we have to go. But like that combined with the policy engine, you can get very safe and secure multisig is pretty good. But then MPC is like a, frankly, like a newer technology. It's not actually that new. It was new, really new when I started looking at it, when I did vc at Fidelity in like 20 1718. Now it's been around a while, but what is the difference between multiparty computation and multisig? You said it was sort of sharding one private key versus a threshold of multiple. But there's more to it than that, right? How does that work?
00:18:06.160 - 00:18:32.280, Speaker B: Right. No, it's a great question. So basically, from security perspective, I know it might sound surprising. It's just the same. Right. Because as I mentioned before, to hack MPC, you need to hack few Internet connected computers, and to hack multisig you need to hack few Internet connected computer. But in this case, in each of the computers you have a full key, and in this case, in each of the computer, you have, for example, one third key.
00:18:32.280 - 00:19:00.726, Speaker B: Right. So from security perspective, it's the same. The idea is that in multisig, the logic of having multiple signer that are mandatory for the process of having valid transaction to the miner are happening on chain. There is like, for example, in bitcoin, like bitcoin script that have this logic, and it's being validated on chain by the miner. It means that the fee that you need to pay for miner to validate it is higher, right?
00:19:00.758 - 00:19:04.582, Speaker A: It is higher, yeah. These are more complex transactions because of all those signatures.
00:19:04.606 - 00:19:24.264, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. It's a larger transaction manner of size. So miners need to spend more processing and electricity, so they charge you for more. Otherwise they wouldn't choose your transaction to put it in the blockchain. So you need to increase the fee accordingly. So when you do multi fee compared to MPC, the fees are higher. That's one thing.
00:19:24.264 - 00:20:13.706, Speaker B: And so that's, I think, the interesting part from the user perspective, but from the vendor's perspective, that providing the technology to support it. If you do MPC, you do the validation process of the logic of the multiple signers off chain. It means that it happens off chain on the cryptography level before it reach to the miner. When the miners see MPC transaction, it sees that as a standard regular transaction. It doesn't even know that it was basically NPC transaction because it's being done off chain using the MPC technology. So the fees are lower and it's seen on the blockchain as a standard transaction and as a vendor. To be honest, it's easier for us to do MPC because once you support it on the signing level.
00:20:13.706 - 00:20:42.562, Speaker B: On the signing algorithm level, you don't need to make support of multisig per chain. Right. If you want to do it with bitcoin, you need to do bitcoin script. If you need to do it. When it comes to Multisig, if you do it on Ethereum, you need to have a smart contract of multisig that you need to develop in order to make it happen. In MPC, you do it on the signing algorithm level and then it can be used for multiple of chains. So once you do that, you can easily invest or support multiple chains.
00:20:42.626 - 00:20:43.138, Speaker A: I see.
00:20:43.234 - 00:21:09.956, Speaker B: It becomes a bottleneck. A lot of institutions, the more chains they can support, the more money they can make and the more business opportunities that they have. If they work with vendors that do MPC, the vendor can faster support more chains since they do it with MPC. So on our end, it's also better to do it that way because we can serve our clients better and meet their requirements faster.
00:21:10.068 - 00:21:27.440, Speaker A: Yeah. Whether you're an exchange or custodian, this is always like, oh, when are you going to support XYZ asset? But MPC, it can work with any of the base address formats or cryptography of any chain, basically, or really anything. We could shard a hash of a book if we wanted.
00:21:27.940 - 00:21:28.372, Speaker B: Right?
00:21:28.436 - 00:21:42.756, Speaker A: Yeah, it's not native to those blockchains. Exactly, exactly. There's a feud in bitcoin. The script gang versus the NPC gang. I hear this. I don't know if you've seen this, and I guess that makes sense. The off chain nature too does have fee implications.
00:21:42.756 - 00:22:16.502, Speaker A: Absolutely. Bitcoin script, whether through taproot or segwit, there are upgrades and new ways of doing bitcoin script that mitigate some of that cost. But it's probably still always higher to have multiple signatures in a transaction than. So it makes sense. I mean, fees become an issue. Is it also faster? Is it easier to coordinate? Have you found, I mean, theoretically we could have me, you and Phineas have each one third of a two of three threshold multisig. And if we're all ready right then it's probably pretty fast.
00:22:16.502 - 00:22:20.686, Speaker A: But is that the reality or is it usually a lot more complicated for Multisig?
00:22:20.758 - 00:23:12.222, Speaker B: It's another interesting question. Theoretically, the multisig can run faster than MPC because there is less complication on the signing level because each of you sign regularly and it's enough in MPC since the algorithm work in a way that there are rounds of communication between the parties. It takes more time and it's another interesting point that we tackle, by the way. The standard NPC algorithms today can make limited number of signatures per second. And now it's fine when the blocks are limited by number of transactions or the time it takes to close block, but in the future, where the latency will be higher and you will be able to make a large number of transactions in certain time, the more fast your MPC algorithm is, the more valid you could be in the market.
00:23:12.286 - 00:23:20.944, Speaker A: It'll be a bottleneck eventually. You're saying it's not? Yeah, like bitcoin blocks are ten minutes. Blocks are what, like 50 seconds or something? Like, it's still fast enough for those.
00:23:21.102 - 00:24:02.200, Speaker B: Exactly. And, you know, we've seen it for a long time already, and we developed a very unique MPC algorithm, which is another granted pattern that we have, by the way, which we're very happy about because we can make large number of signatures per second. It's actually very large, like thousands of signatures per second compared to only a few. And we see it as like a future proof, because we will be able to work with the future blockchains as well. It's also, by the way, helping us from security perspective. Right. Because if you are limited with the efficiency of your algorithm, the more shards you split your key, the more time it takes to make the signature with the standard algorithms.
00:24:02.200 - 00:24:33.786, Speaker B: But in our case, the more shards you split the key, it's going in linear time rather than quantum time. So you can be more secure, because according to the metrics that I mentioned before, we can do MPC with large number of charts. So you don't need to hack only three Internet connected computers, which is what we see as some kind of standard of the MPC solutions in the market, we can do it with way more than that. So even on the smaller percentage of the assets that managed on the MPC, on our client side, they can make it more secure because they can split it into more than only three shards, like 4510 shards.
00:24:33.938 - 00:25:05.544, Speaker A: That's interesting. Let's talk about who needs it. You talk about institutions. I can list off a bunch that makes sense. But one that's been on top of our managed funds, high net worth businesses, corporations that hold crypto exchanges, for example, our big corporations that hold on behalf of people. But one that's been top of mind that we were talking about briefly earlier, both in the US, but also on this show, is banks. Banks in America, trust companies.
00:25:05.544 - 00:25:59.218, Speaker A: And banks are historically the biggest custodians of traditional assets, and yet they can't really, today, by regulation by rule. Custody digital assets on behalf of customers, depositors in the US. That's SAB 121 that we've talked about. I won't go on and on about it, but if it were to be lifted, I think there's about 4800 banks in the United States. And if you think about it, we just even stick to bitcoin, but could be anything stable, coins, other assets, anything on it, but just bitcoin for simplicity. Well, all of a sudden it should be like, well, wait a second, if I have depositors that have fiat cash with me and they have bitcoin too, shouldn't I offer that? Is that a market for GKA or would the banks outsource custody? Do a managed custodian like you said, or does this have to be a self custody? How do you think about that? Or, I mean, theoretically anybody else, but this is this weird giant market that could unlock, we think.
00:25:59.314 - 00:26:54.522, Speaker B: Yeah. So, look, there are some regulation challenges, I think, globally. I think it's also a positive thing because there is a process of eventually get it done in the best way that will contribute to the users eventually. So we don't believe that the right way is to use managed custody because of what I mentioned before, you need to control your own destiny, especially when there are no the challenges of doing custody for fiat assets, but for private keys for digital assets. And I think that the end game is that banks will do self custody and will control their own destiny, will create their flexibility with their business ideas down the road. So we truly believe it's getting there. Now, there are different regulations globally.
00:26:54.522 - 00:27:41.876, Speaker B: There are places that it's more mature even for banks, and there are places that are not in the US. It is pretty challenging right now, but on the other end, they are all getting ready, right? We are in multiple processes with leading banks that are either in POC stages or already building the business cases internally. So they are getting prepared for the green light, I would say, to go into production, but they are all there. They are all there. Even if they just wanted to start at the beginning with managed custodian, just to have some hands on experience and exploration and very small pocs, they're all getting into self custody. That's how we see the market and getting prepared to this point. And by then they do what they can do.
00:27:41.876 - 00:28:21.640, Speaker B: So, for example, getting into tokenization of real world assets, where there are more clarity on the regulation, because they can work with the same regulation that they do with traditional assets, although they are now digitalized over blockchain. So it's easier for them to start over there. That's why we educate, get into the tokenization space. Already two years ago we started working on that, and we have great maturity right now in some extremely interesting projects, such as, I know the one that we have with all unity right now that's running the regulated euro stablecoin using our infrastructure. So there are interesting dynamics there.
00:28:21.680 - 00:29:08.710, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, let's talk about tokenization more. And you're right, I think not just, we'll talk about all unity specifically too, but one of the biggest trends in Defi in the market has been the rise of real world assets. I hate saying RWA, that means a whole different thing in tradfi. And I know some of our tradfi, either colleagues or people that came from traditional finance, hate that term. But okay, off chain assets coming on chain, particularly us treasuries, I would say this is sort of the vanguard of doing this. And some big issuers like Franklin Templeton and some others, have brought a fair amount of us treasuries on, on to Ethereum primarily and into defi. There's reasons why, I think the main one being that real world yields were high while crypto yields were low, and so there was a market to be served there.
00:29:08.710 - 00:29:35.204, Speaker A: But how do you think about what do you guys offer from the token you mentioned at the top? You're saying you could, it's not just wallets and things, but it's staking, it's interacting with Defi. Describe a little bit what the, I think you guys would, the tokenization wizard of. It's your offering in tokenization. Obviously, I can see how it pairs with protecting and utilizing cryptographic key material, but describe the offering a little bit that you have in the tokenization space.
00:29:35.332 - 00:30:40.246, Speaker B: Sure. So first of all, eventually, the way that we see tokenization, it's like digitalize assets on chain for the advantage of making it more secure, more transparent, real time settlement, and also the ability to work with the fractions of the assets, which we see a lot of interest around that. Eventually, when you do tokenization the way that you need to do it, you need to issue a smart contract with certain business logic to run your tokenization business. And when you need to do that, you need to write smart contract code, deploy to the blockchain. Then you have some functions over there that you, as the operator of the business, need to have access to that might be different than the access that others need to have. So there is a full business around it. And we realized that there are a lot of challenges of complexity from technology perspective and obviously from security perspective.
00:30:40.246 - 00:31:49.494, Speaker B: So what we did first, we build a tokenization wizard that enabling you, without writing any code, but just within a few clicks over configuration page, to create your own smart contract for the tokenization business without the need to write any code. So you can literally decide what are the parameters, the functions and the functionality eventually that you want your business logic of the tokenization business that you want to build to have without writing any code. So it's easy, there is no any complexity and it's also very secure. It's very secure because we recognize eventually three attack vectors in this process. The first one is vulnerabilities in the smart contract code itself. The second part is within the issuance process, and the third part is the private key protection of the admin key. The tokenization wizard solve the issue of not having smart contract vulnerabilities in the code itself that someone might exploit down the road for two reasons.
00:31:49.494 - 00:32:41.902, Speaker B: First, you don't write the code itself. It's based on our platform that was audited and validated by very leading penetration testers to make sure that we have no issues with that. The second thing is that we leverage our private keys management technology to do so. You can use the cold vault as the issuer of the smart contracts and the deployment of that to the blockchain. So imagine that at any point there is no code of the smart contract being on Internet connected computer before deployed to the blockchain. So no hacker could include backdoors and malicious code over there and then take advantage down the road in a year or two where it's worth doing it. It's all being created, the smart contract being created in the cold vault, signed in the cold vault and deploy to the blockchain the same as we do with transactions, right? So now we leverage it for the issuance part of the smart contract.
00:32:41.902 - 00:33:15.726, Speaker B: So no backdoor will be in the smart contract at any point. And then the other interesting point is the private keys management, which in my opinion is the most painful one. And again, we anticipate so many events around it, hacking events around it, if people will not keep it into their minds. Right. The admin key is the key that you use to upload the smart contract to the blockchain and then you keep to yourself if you want to have access to the smart contract to upload version or to have the superpowers, the.
00:33:15.758 - 00:33:26.078, Speaker A: Sensitive, which you can build in or not build in. But I think for most tokenization use cases you need some kind of, especially if you're going to issue and mint and burn and revoke and whatever.
00:33:26.214 - 00:33:36.946, Speaker B: Exactly. The minting, the burning, the proxy, which means that you can proxy from the previous smart contract to a new one in order to upgrade version. That's the way to upgrade version on chain smart contracts, right.
00:33:36.978 - 00:33:41.234, Speaker A: Because you can't actually take the old version down, that just, you just have to point to a new version.
00:33:41.282 - 00:34:17.460, Speaker B: Right, exactly. Because blockchain is irreversible, you cannot change anything online. And that's the one thing that can make the decentralized blockchain centralized if you don't do it properly. So if you manage the admin key in a not secure way, it's even more painful than if someone is just hacking your bank or hacking your exchange, right? Because it will not only steal your institution money, which is very painful, it can destroy the all economy in one. So if you control the admin key, you can mint yourself as much money as you want, you can burn everyone's money or you can just destroy anything, everything.
00:34:17.500 - 00:34:26.266, Speaker A: Right. It's not just losing my keys that hold my ownership of the tokenized asset that I bought from the issuer, which is me losing my keys. It's ruining the issue.
00:34:26.418 - 00:35:17.778, Speaker B: Exactly. Exactly. The old business could be in risk. That's why large and ambitious projects such as regulated euro stablecoin with the strong partners under all unity, obviously galaxy and Flowtrader and DWS, they understand how crucially to do it in a secure way. So GK, it's cold storage taking, so the minting and burning could take place from the core storage. You can have sub authorities of like the NPC that can do limited minting and burning capabilities, for example. And also what we built in order to enable all of that, is also policy engine for tokenization, right? When you do policy engine for assets, movement on whitelist and limits of how much money can be sent on a daily, weekly basis, it's one thing.
00:35:17.778 - 00:35:27.118, Speaker B: But now we also had to come up with policy engine on the access to the smart contracts functions of the tokenization. So what kids can have the access.
00:35:27.174 - 00:35:31.374, Speaker A: What can't, who can mint, who can burn exactly how much, how much stages how much?
00:35:31.462 - 00:35:32.230, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:35:32.390 - 00:36:13.438, Speaker A: Yeah. So let's talk about lunity a little bit more specifically because I don't think I've talked about it on this podcast, although some of our listeners may be aware. My understanding, although I'm not really involved in the actual building of this product from galaxy side, is that Mika, the markets and crypto assets regulation in Europe, which is a really interesting one because I've said this before, but you can sort of take two paths as a nation or a regulator. You can do a bunch of work and provide a bunch of guidance to force fit crypto assets into your existing rules and regulations. It's kind of what the UK has done with the FCA and his Majesty's treasury has done all of this. Writing about, okay, well, the existing custody rule says this. Here's how crypto could fit into it.
00:36:13.438 - 00:36:48.758, Speaker A: Or you could kind of start from scratch and build a whole bespoke regime that works with crypto assets, which is kind of what Europe has done. I criticize, for example, the SEC in the United States, because they kind of take the former approach, what the UK has done, but they haven't really done any of the work to actually explain how the existing rules apply to crypto assets. They say that they do, but they haven't. They say that the rules apply, but they haven't. That's a whole separate discussion. One of the interesting things about Mika is it has some protectionism around the use of the euro on chain. And so right now, I think the US dollar denominated stablecoins are probably like 99% of the stablecoin market.
00:36:48.758 - 00:37:16.170, Speaker A: But I think I expect that to grow, if not only because of Mika, but maybe for other reasons as well. What is the. From your perspective, I mean, I think you've already kind of explained how all unity actually uses GKA technology, but how do you see that as the opportunity? And by the way, do you think this is replicatable, maybe for other foreign effects or for, I don't know, gold or commodity tokenized commodities or equities for that matter?
00:37:16.290 - 00:38:12.530, Speaker B: Right. So yeah, I think there is a true opportunity around it all unity, they are utilizing our full end to end solution, the cold vault MPC, the API, and the endpoint applications that we have in order to do it. I think one of the interesting things is that the guys understand that true blockchain is public blockchain. It's really decentralized and that's the goal. So we enable them to do that with the technology of GK eight and in pretty diverse chains. We help them work with a lot of chains to do this business. It will open to them different opportunities because they will be able to do the same euro stablecoin logic over different on chain protocols.
00:38:12.530 - 00:38:55.356, Speaker B: So that's where we can leverage the MPC technology that I mentioned before. So we can work with large number of native chains on the one hand, but on the other end, one of the unique capabilities that GK eight has is general EVM support. So we don't need to develop support per EVM chain, which become also a standard in the market. And a lot of either existing or new chains are the EVM compatibles. So we have the technology that you can work with any EVM, either existing EVM or new EVM down the road without you waiting for us to develop support per chain, which is another bottleneck. A lot of institutions need their providers to spend few months to support new chains. And in our case, you can work with all of the evms right now.
00:38:55.356 - 00:39:16.050, Speaker B: And even after we install the product tomorrow, there is a new EVM. You can work with it right away within like a 20 seconds process that you do with the product. So it's a true enabler and avoiding button. Lack of supporting new chain. And this is also a very strong offering that we enable all unity to do with euro stablecoin.
00:39:16.130 - 00:39:40.144, Speaker A: That makes sense too, because stables dollars are kind of like water on pavement. And you've seen this from tether and USDC as sort of the big ones. Eventually they kind of go on every chain that has any real demand for it. So I can see that particularly for, in this case, euros. But for widely used fiat currency, like, you need that flexibility. I mean, I mean, tether is a great example. It's.
00:39:40.144 - 00:39:58.594, Speaker A: For years it was on, it was on the omni network, which is a bitcoin l two. Then it was on bitcoin and ETH and was mostly on Ethereum. And now it's technically mostly on Tron. Not technically, it's literally mostly on TRon, but it's on probably at least a half dozen chains in size. Same thing with USDC. So that flexibility is important.
00:39:58.722 - 00:39:59.330, Speaker B: Definitely.
00:39:59.410 - 00:40:31.428, Speaker A: You talked about flexibility and the different regulatory jurisdictions. How important is your technological? It sounds like you've built a pretty modular, a secure but pretty adaptable technology. Is that helping you as you go in these various jurisdictions? They're all pretty different. Still, I think we're getting some coalescing finally. I mean, you've got sort of a Middle east nexus with sort of emerging regulatory clarity there. And we talked about Europe and, and the UK, and hopefully the US will get a bit more clarity soon. But how important is that flexibility?
00:40:31.564 - 00:41:08.294, Speaker B: Yeah. So the regulation is a challenge for our clients, right. We are not holding the money off no one. We're providing technology for our clients do. And the way that we design the product is in a way that comply with the requirements. Right. Everything from the policy engine that enabled internal procedures, the disaster recovery plan, everything that related to business continuation, even the access to insurance that we have unique partnership around it, that we provide the ability to access up to $1 billion per cold vault for any of our clients, which is a very meaningful one, or the ability to have a port.
00:41:08.294 - 00:41:52.170, Speaker B: So we design the product accordingly so our clients can meet their requirements by license our technology. That's one thing. In addition, you know, you mentioned also the banks that not necessarily can work with crypto, but might be able to work with tokenization of real world assets. And we had to come up with different ideas, interesting ones. Also by leveraging the connection between Galaxy and GK eight, I have an interesting example. Imagine that you cannot work with crypto as a bank, but still you are working on public chain, for example, over Ethereum. How can you do asset movement of a token while you need to pay gas fee in Ethereum, but you're not allowed Ethereum?
00:41:52.210 - 00:42:13.202, Speaker A: This actually happened, right? I mean, I think this was like you couldn't hold it, or was some banks were able to hold it for the clients. Well, now with this, they actually still can. That rule I mentioned doesn't actually prohibit them sab 121 from holding it. It just makes it cost ineffective. But it was like. But you can't have it on your own balance sheet as a bank.
00:42:13.266 - 00:42:13.522, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:42:13.546 - 00:42:17.320, Speaker A: So it's like, well, how do I pay for my client? How do I send my client their eth?
00:42:17.400 - 00:42:17.848, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:42:17.904 - 00:42:22.180, Speaker A: I got to pay some guy, I got to have some amount, even a couple thousand dollars worth.
00:42:22.720 - 00:42:26.624, Speaker B: You don't need much. But the idea of can't hold anything, it's crazy.
00:42:26.672 - 00:42:28.184, Speaker A: You guys figured out a way to deal with this.
00:42:28.192 - 00:43:15.156, Speaker B: Yeah, there actually, which is amazing. So we leverage the fact that GK eight is under the same umbrella of galaxy, while Galaxy has the validation nodes business as well. And what we do is we hold the fees, which is again, just limited amount of money for the bank. And when the bank want to send assets to someone, we bundle the transaction that the bank wants to send along with the transaction that we fuel the bank and we bundle them together to the validator unit and they put it together in the block. So basically we, we provide crypto to the bank, but you never see that in their balance because it's all settled in the same block. You see what I mean?
00:43:15.188 - 00:43:15.692, Speaker A: Yeah, it's pretty interesting.
00:43:15.716 - 00:43:16.348, Speaker B: Super interesting.
00:43:16.404 - 00:43:18.068, Speaker A: Yeah, that is interesting.
00:43:18.124 - 00:43:24.960, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a very interesting approach that we are taking, and it solves some interesting things.
00:43:25.780 - 00:43:36.118, Speaker A: There could be other reasons why the entity doesn't want to hold it, actually. Right. So it's not just that. Maybe even if the bank thing eases, there could be a. And also the fact that it's in the same block is really quite interesting. Yes.
00:43:36.174 - 00:43:37.210, Speaker B: Yeah, it is.
00:43:38.750 - 00:43:46.358, Speaker A: Not literally, but it's like a flash loan kind of. You're saying like, well, we'll pay for it before it even ever arrives. Right.
00:43:46.454 - 00:44:01.862, Speaker B: Right. It's very interesting. We love it. Yeah. And another interesting thing around the regulation, which is also pretty typical story. You know, two weeks ago, we heard about DMM, one of the largest japanese exchanges. Right.
00:44:01.862 - 00:44:49.118, Speaker B: They were hacked for $305 million. And the interesting thing that we noticed is that there are few. By the way, it's not clear yet what happened, but there are some articles. We found that, to get into more details, talking that they announced that both their odd wallets and isolated wallets that's supposed to be called were hacked and that money leaked due to that. And we noticed that according to the japanese regulation, they require crypto providers, like exchanges, to hold at least 95 of their assets in cold storage, while the rest could be in hot wallet. And that literally wasn't the case, because if it was true cold, it wouldn't hack. Yeah.
00:44:49.134 - 00:44:56.390, Speaker A: And if they had only. If that was only 5% of their assets, right, then they would have had, what, 20 times that 300 million a doubtful.
00:44:56.470 - 00:44:56.710, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:44:56.750 - 00:44:58.302, Speaker A: They're not that big of an exchange.
00:44:58.446 - 00:45:51.628, Speaker B: That's what I heard as well. But what we find interesting is that regulators actually taking meaningful role here of actually defining the guidelines for blockchain and crypto providers as to how they should manage their risks. And I think the next step would be how to define in a clear way what cold wallet is, because there is a very mis, confusion in the market today as to what cold wallet is. As we explained before, you're not cold wallet if you're connected even at the millisecond to the Internet. And that's exactly what the regulator should do as a next step. And we are actively involved with a few regulators helping them right now to define what cold wallet is. And we want to take care of the future of people that are holding blockchain assets.
00:45:51.628 - 00:47:10.110, Speaker B: And we believe that by defining how you should manage the private key in a way that no one will ever be able to steal your assets from, cybersecurity attacks will make things more secure. And they needed peace of mind. And I think this is one of the regulators role to do that, because we're in the business of trust. I think that eventually custody, which is what all of these business providers do, as part of what they do, on top of that, it's the most important thing, and everyone should put trust in the first place. And one of the most meaningful consideration of establishing trust is how you manage the private keys properly in a future proof way. That meeting the existing hackers capabilities, and also the future ones, these banks or other large institutions, even crypto exchanges holding hundreds of millions of dollars, they should protect themselves from even the state level hackers of the world that have the budget to invest these few millions to steal billions. And that's an interesting role for the regulators to get there.
00:47:10.530 - 00:47:48.380, Speaker A: I want to ask one other question about securrency. I saw this is like a tokenization company. They do more of, I think, the legal regulatory part of the tokenization. Like the many, I mean, dozens of these companies used to exist. I looked at as a venture investor in 2019. We used to joke there were more of these companies than there were actual security tokens. But I saw that they were a longtime client of GK eight s, and they were acquired by the American Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, the DTCC, which I'm not an expert, but I think is basically the end custodian of all equities in the US listed equities.
00:47:48.380 - 00:48:00.090, Speaker A: Can you say anything about that? Or does that mean that. I mean, you still work with c currency. And I guess the real question I have is when can I trade a listed equities on a blockchain?
00:48:00.550 - 00:48:07.582, Speaker B: So I'm not sure I can answer the second question as to when they will be ready for that.
00:48:07.606 - 00:48:08.694, Speaker A: Hopefully soon though, right?
00:48:08.742 - 00:48:38.180, Speaker B: Hopefully, hopefully. But yes, security is a longtime client of GK eight. We have strong relationship and warm engagement with them. They're brilliant, by the way, one of their founders then, Don, is amazing. I really appreciate his mind. So, yes, we're still working with them. They've been acquired by DTCC and I think it's open even new opportunities for the relationship between the companies.
00:48:38.180 - 00:49:05.590, Speaker B: They're doing tokenization for equities and commodities. They're not necessarily using our technology to make the issuance side of things, because they already did that back in time, because we're long term partners, but they do use our product for the private keys management side of things. And the access to the tokenization, everything that I mentioned about the superpowers capabilities that should be managed securely and the platform around it.
00:49:07.370 - 00:49:41.788, Speaker A: I thought it was so interesting and almost like a watershed moment for the tokenization of equities, because one of the most high quality and earliest academic papers written about public blockchains was written by the DTCC in, I think, 2015, if I recall. I remember reading this literally, like, I guess nine years ago, and they effectively said, wow, the public blockchain is better for ledgering the ownership of assets than we are. We should basically be disintermediated by this. So I don't know. I was happy to see them doing something.
00:49:41.804 - 00:49:42.880, Speaker B: It's an interesting move.
00:49:43.180 - 00:49:48.460, Speaker A: Leor Lamesh, co founder and CEO of GKA thank you so much for coming on Galaxy Brains.
