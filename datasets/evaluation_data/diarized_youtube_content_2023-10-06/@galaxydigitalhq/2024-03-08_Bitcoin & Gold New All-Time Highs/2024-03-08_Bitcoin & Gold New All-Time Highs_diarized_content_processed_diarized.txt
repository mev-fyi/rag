00:00:07.520 - 00:00:12.038, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bim net Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:12.126 - 00:00:13.830, Speaker B: Thanks for having me, man.
00:00:13.862 - 00:00:39.396, Speaker A: It's been an exciting. Continues to be exciting. We said this, so we're recording on Wednesday, March 6, but on Tuesday, March 5, yesterday, bitcoin made a new all time high. I have to call it out because that's a rare occasion. So 69, 338 is what I have. The new all time high. That was Coinbase's price at a point on Tuesday morning, surpassing the previous all time high again, using Coinbase of 69,000 flat.
00:00:39.396 - 00:00:57.044, Speaker A: A lot of volatility, though. Yesterday, a $10,000 move. We eventually. We shortly thereafter traded as low as 59, 200 before pairing losses and trading right back up to the 63k range. Now it's 67,000, basically. I don't know. What's your reaction?
00:00:57.424 - 00:02:08.644, Speaker B: You know, I think this price action wasn't easy to call, but the writing was definitely on the wall or on the cards. Generally speaking, when you have a market skyrocket just over a certain period, and when these types of assets hit resistance levels, especially ones as significant as a prior all time high, like, you rarely take those out on a first go, it generally requires multiple tests. And so seeing a big sell off into resistance after leverage got insanely overextended with funding rates and Ohio and OI at super elevated levels, like, you know, I think that was just, you know, par for the course. And I think, you know, in terms of what you saw with $60,000, essentially holding is characteristic of an asset that has been institutionalized. What do you typically get when you have an institutional asset class? Is you get a bunch of dip buyers. Institutions aren't the types of folks trying to pay the highs. They buy dips, they wait for corrections.
00:02:08.644 - 00:02:19.698, Speaker B: And so I think seeing a healthy bounce off of 60k, seeing strong ETF inflow numbers really strong, you know, suggests that, you know, there are dip buyers in the space.
00:02:19.786 - 00:02:35.690, Speaker A: Tuesday was the largest net inflows into the ETF's since day one. Yep. So day one was larger by, like 10 million, again on a net basis. Yeah. Huge volume. By far the biggest traded volume day in, over $10 billion worth of volume traded on those ETF's on Tuesday. Truly wild.
00:02:35.762 - 00:03:03.998, Speaker B: I mean, it's insane. And again, like, another sign of institutionalized. Right. The deeper the liquidity, the more liquid. I mean, this obviously liquidity part of it is how much price impact you have for something you trade. And so, clearly, we're having a lot of price impact, but the volumes are such that it's acceptable for folks, a traffic and decent size in it. And so that generally begets more institutions.
00:03:03.998 - 00:03:53.436, Speaker B: And so everything you've seen so far is healthy. And I think that the macro landscape is certainly helping as well. Gold is at an all time high now, right? Broke through 2100 and basically everybody is like, oh my God, do I need more gold in the portfolio? Do I buy gold calls? And I think the reason why gold's up there, it's not because us rates are crazy bid or we've priced out. We started the year around seven cuts priced in. You're at three and a half now or three ish. And you know, like that would have generally been supportive of gold lower, but that's not what's happened. And so what I think is happening is just the world coming to grips with the structural reality of the fiscal situation.
00:03:53.580 - 00:04:03.012, Speaker A: Yeah. Bitcoin and gold both all time highs on Tuesday, March 5, 1st time they've ever hit all time highs together. Makes sense. Bitcoin and S and P Nasdaq are.
00:04:03.028 - 00:04:05.900, Speaker B: At all time highs. So it's a risk asset and a debasement.
00:04:05.972 - 00:04:15.144, Speaker A: Let's go to your point about what is the, you said the fiscal situations are becoming apparent globally. What else is out there that macro is concerned about?
00:04:15.644 - 00:04:48.116, Speaker B: I mean like the general supply of fixed income. Right. I think I read some stat, there's 40% more treasuries that are going to have to be absorbed by the market than mature in this month of March alone. And that's not including corporate debt. Right. And then the fed on top of that is reducing its balance sheet. And then you throw in what's happening with the regional banks and stuff and they don't have strong appetite to buy paper.
00:04:48.116 - 00:05:05.564, Speaker B: Like the BTFP just went away. Dealers have a strong appetite or not. But anyway, it's a lot of paper to absorb for any institution or any reserve level that the Fed can reasonably run.
00:05:05.604 - 00:05:15.756, Speaker A: At the moment they're saying that now that every 100 days the US is adding a trillion to its national debt. At this point, that's the rate. I mean that's shocking.
00:05:15.820 - 00:05:20.340, Speaker B: Shocking. And then you just keep running the math on that. The math gets worse by the day, right?
00:05:20.372 - 00:05:24.308, Speaker A: It gets a shorter time period to add that trillion. I mean we're, yes, but it's also.
00:05:24.356 - 00:05:41.324, Speaker B: Just like then you, it's your debt servicing, like, and with interest rates so high, right. As debt rolls off, right. That was lower yielding. The Fed has to issue all these bills and like you know, other treasuries that are far higher yielding than those that are maturing.
00:05:41.444 - 00:06:00.262, Speaker A: So this creates, though, a fear of what if we play it all the way out of parabolic debt can't be serviced, so then governments have to pay more to service it, so they have to cut back on other stuff. And that leads to recessions and turmoil, raises taxes, and then also it leads to revolution, basically, potentially.
00:06:00.318 - 00:06:06.454, Speaker B: But it's also, like, in theory, like, what's your best way out of, like, a lot of debt. And we've seen the story in em. It's a lot of inflation.
00:06:06.534 - 00:06:06.982, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:07.078 - 00:06:08.494, Speaker B: And devalue your currency.
00:06:08.574 - 00:06:09.054, Speaker A: I see.
00:06:09.134 - 00:06:47.040, Speaker B: Right. Gold and hard assets should do well. And, like, the argument for hard assets is it gets better, better every day. And, like, if bitcoin's part of that hard asset narrative, it's game over. Because I don't know about you, but I would put my life on savings, on politicians continuing to want to spend, especially going into an election cycle. And there's no, like, there's no, in the political reality that we live in, there's no world where, like, getting the fiscal situation right becomes, like, a priority for both parties.
00:06:47.112 - 00:06:58.248, Speaker A: One guy in that south american country, Argentina, Javier Millay. Oh, he's the only one I've ever seen dramatically win on, effectively a massive austerity.
00:06:58.336 - 00:06:58.680, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:06:58.752 - 00:07:03.672, Speaker A: But that's just, you know why? Cause he's fun. Like, he was also fun. He wasn't like, wow, the only way.
00:07:03.848 - 00:07:04.520, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:07:04.592 - 00:07:05.736, Speaker A: He's out there with a chainsaw.
00:07:05.840 - 00:07:14.084, Speaker B: No, you can't do that. But I tell you, if you go to Europe and you show austerity, no appetite, that's just like, no, go away.
00:07:15.504 - 00:07:17.904, Speaker A: But here, too. Here, too. But here's the thing.
00:07:17.944 - 00:07:26.496, Speaker B: And the other problem, though, is just so structural. Right? Like, a congressman's got two years, right? Right. He's got to run for reelection, like, every year.
00:07:26.560 - 00:07:45.976, Speaker A: There's an old thing, and I'm sure this has changed, but when I studied polycyth, this was like, 20 years ago at this point, but it was some stat that was like, an average congressperson, when they get elected, has to basically raise $6,500 a week in order to get reelected. And that actually forces a lot of them to not even be in Washington very often, spend most of their time back at home raising money.
00:07:46.040 - 00:07:46.240, Speaker B: Right?
00:07:46.272 - 00:08:02.624, Speaker A: Yeah. So you got two strategies. You raise a ton of money at home, or you basically make a name for yourself on television in Washington and raise national money that way. Those are race. And so they have to spend all of their time, by the time they get elected, they gotta immediately get elected again. And that really makes it hard to do policy and it makes it harder.
00:08:02.664 - 00:08:17.390, Speaker B: You're gonna solve one of the biggest policy challenges we're gonna have over the next four decades. And then it's also just as a function of like, who's getting elected, who's in power. It's people that have benefited from 30 years of insane fiscal spending and packages and low rates.
00:08:17.422 - 00:08:22.086, Speaker A: That's partly why we got all rates. The average age of a member of Congress and the Senate is.
00:08:22.110 - 00:08:31.614, Speaker B: And they're not thinking about the debt profile they're gonna have when they're debt and what their kids are gonna have at least as well as somebody that was younger.
00:08:31.654 - 00:08:36.606, Speaker A: Well, and at least collectively as a branch of government, they're failing to act on this question.
00:08:36.670 - 00:08:38.694, Speaker B: Young people don't vote as much.
00:08:38.774 - 00:08:41.838, Speaker A: Well, right, no, I get it. The incentives are all misaligned to solve this problem.
00:08:41.926 - 00:08:52.184, Speaker B: It's crazy misalignment. Oh, man. You know, like, I'm going to stick with hard money. I'm going to stick to bitcoin, gold and other hard assets.
00:08:52.264 - 00:08:56.216, Speaker A: Right? I mean, cash generating equities. People love equities for this. Equities are good hedge.
00:08:56.280 - 00:08:58.376, Speaker B: Yeah, they're fantastic fiat debates.
00:08:58.400 - 00:08:59.800, Speaker A: That's what Warren Buffett has always said.
00:08:59.912 - 00:09:17.268, Speaker B: And here's the thing, like, you know, bitcoin is just another version of a fiat hedge and some prefer it over equities and. But the main point is like, I'd rather be in liquid fiat hedges that I can move around in like good size and trade 24/7 it's pretty nice.
00:09:17.316 - 00:09:18.664, Speaker A: You can't, like, if you.
00:09:19.124 - 00:09:22.052, Speaker B: The right to privacy and yeah, it's a whole city.
00:09:22.228 - 00:09:30.084, Speaker A: And if you actually needed to, let's say, you know, you needed to spend in, well, you can just send your bitcoin. I can't pay someone an apple stock if I.
00:09:30.124 - 00:09:30.972, Speaker B: No, no, you can't.
00:09:31.028 - 00:09:34.836, Speaker A: Much more useful with gold, by the way. Yeah, I'm gonna mail you a coin.
00:09:34.900 - 00:10:21.764, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just, it's, it's the future and people are seeing it. That's what's going on. Macro eyes and whatnot. So you never know when this fiscal stuff becomes the main focus of the market. And I think what you'll see happen when the market really wakes up to this is a massive rerating in us interest rates and the curve. Most importantly, I think as more people realize the future of the US is shakier, you should have a higher term premium 30 year bonds. Like, oh, wait, I'm getting paid 4% change for 30 years.
00:10:21.764 - 00:10:26.016, Speaker B: Is that going to compensate me for the rate of inflation we're likely going to have?
00:10:26.080 - 00:10:33.964, Speaker A: You're really need like five, six, 7%? Theoretically, yeah. Does that wreck mortgage rates? Also makes it harder for everyone to buy?
00:10:34.424 - 00:10:50.768, Speaker B: Should, yeah, I mean, think about this. We have now, like, there are now economists calling for no rate cuts this year because the data is still super strong. Yeah, we haven't seen a collapse in housing, even though housing affordability has gone down a lot.
00:10:50.816 - 00:10:51.120, Speaker A: Right.
00:10:51.192 - 00:11:31.680, Speaker B: Because people still want homes like crazy and there's also just tons of like wealth build up and liquidity built up and et cetera. And so, yeah, those rates are going to, it's going to be an issue to bring them down because raising them hasn't really had that much of an impact. But, yeah, over the long run, I would expect rates to stay high and maybe even go higher. The question then what you're really coming to is, is the Fed's inflation target of 2% even reasonable? And then you get close to it in the end, and right now it's looking like you might get close to two, but you're gonna hover above two.
00:11:31.792 - 00:11:32.192, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:32.248 - 00:11:42.724, Speaker B: And so like targeting two, does it make sense? Are you gonna be more comfortable with two and a half, three in the world we live in? Right. That's kind of, you know, you know what other folks are debating as well?
00:11:43.064 - 00:11:47.208, Speaker A: Bimna Abibi from Galaxy trading, my friend. Thank you for coming on, Galaxy brains.
