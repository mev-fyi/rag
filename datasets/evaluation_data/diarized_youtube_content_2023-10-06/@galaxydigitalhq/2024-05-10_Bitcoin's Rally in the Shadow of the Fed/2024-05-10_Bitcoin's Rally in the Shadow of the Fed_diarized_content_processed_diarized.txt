00:00:00.320 - 00:00:32.080, Speaker A: Unemployment was almost at structural lows at that time. And Powell still decided to cut interest rates in 2018. And this was a time when inflation wasn't as much of a concern. Right. And people hadn't really thought that the US could be in a six, seven, 8% inflationary environment ever. So I'll caveat it with that. But I think the key takeaway is that absolutely, the White House can have an influence on central bankers.
00:00:32.080 - 00:00:58.824, Speaker A: And I point to that as kind of the main example, because if you look at the set of facts, which was unemployment around, like, 4.2%. Right. And having achieved solid normalization, the Fed was at that time methodically raising rates, and they were getting back to a place that felt more sustainable. And yet he decided to do an insurance cut at that time. And so that's one.
