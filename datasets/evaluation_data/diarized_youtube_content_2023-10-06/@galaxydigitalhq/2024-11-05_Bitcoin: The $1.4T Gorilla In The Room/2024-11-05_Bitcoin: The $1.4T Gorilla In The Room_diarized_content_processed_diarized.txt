00:00:00.360 - 00:00:17.285, Speaker B: My count of the intraday all time high from March 2024 was 73, 8:35. So we were just about a little bit less than $200 off of the all time high for bitcoin this week, a week before the election. I don't know. What's your take on that?
00:00:17.625 - 00:00:47.367, Speaker A: Yeah, I think bitcoin at this point is the $1.4 trillion gorilla in the room. You can't ignore. Right. It is absolutely massive. It is accelerating higher. It's one of those things that if you're an institutional investor, you're looking at it being like, okay, what are the arguments for why bitcoin can go higher? There's the whole monetary debasement thing, which we can get into.
00:00:47.367 - 00:00:54.215, Speaker A: But you look at trades that benefit from that, and you immediately think about gold, which has gone on a spectacular run this year.
