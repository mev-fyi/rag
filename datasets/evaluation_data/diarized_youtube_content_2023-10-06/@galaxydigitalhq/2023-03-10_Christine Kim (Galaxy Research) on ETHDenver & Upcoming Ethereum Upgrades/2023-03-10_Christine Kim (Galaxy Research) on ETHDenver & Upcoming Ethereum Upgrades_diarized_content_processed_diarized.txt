00:00:07.000 - 00:00:30.950, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. I got a mic first so big that I flow like my pipes burst blind signatures, you don't see how it goes, so disappear forever like Satoshi Nakamoto intrepid. When I rep it every second, y'all are wrecked. If I said it, then, I meant it. Every method is decentralized. Tell the venture guys they need to bench their spies. We keep it open when we're coding.
00:00:30.950 - 00:00:42.326, Speaker A: See the tension, right? Let that sink in. Feed it out like backwash. The world is teetering on the brink. Shout out to Matt walls. Today you can be your own bank. So thank me later. You turn sides against the empire like Darth Vader.
00:00:42.326 - 00:01:00.506, Speaker A: Yo, we're playing for Keith, seeking a pristine wind. Our guest this week is the inimitable Christine Kim. Ain't never been another man with my number. Damn, yo, I'm smothering every wunderkin that thinks they have a plan. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital. Thank you for listening to galaxy brains. We have a great show for you today.
00:01:00.506 - 00:01:36.814, Speaker A: As I said, we're talking with Christine Kim from Galaxy Research. She's back from Denver. And the East Denver conference, the biggest Ethereum conference of the year by far. We'll talk to Christine about what her takeaways from the conference were and what to expect from the upcoming upgrades on Ethereum. We'll also check in with our friend bin at a bb from galaxy trading to talk markets. Jay Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, speaking before both houses of Congress this week, materially impacting markets. But before we get into all of that, I need to please remind you to look at the link to the disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice and offer recommendations or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities.
00:01:36.814 - 00:01:46.530, Speaker A: Yo, this is a good beat. I think we're gonna have a good show, so let's get right into it. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, welcome, my friend.
00:01:46.602 - 00:01:47.458, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:01:47.506 - 00:01:54.546, Speaker A: Yeah, great to have you here. Fun day this week. Fun week this week, I should say. Jay Powell himself, the fiduciary of the.
00:01:54.570 - 00:01:57.362, Speaker B: Fed, the most important man in markets.
00:01:57.418 - 00:02:15.444, Speaker A: The leader of the Federal Reserve, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. He is testifying in his semiannual updates to Congress. He did the Senate. Today's Wednesday. He did the Senate banking committee on Tuesday. Yesterday, I think he might still be, as we record this, speaking now before the House Financial services Committee. What are we hearing from Mister Powell?
00:02:15.864 - 00:02:58.724, Speaker B: Well, it was a pretty big sort of hawkish tilt that we had yesterday from his prepared remarks. Basically he's putting 50 basis point increase for the march FOMC on the table. He's also reiterating higher for longer. And essentially he gave a huge policy update speech when the market wasn't really expecting that much. So it was a pretty big deal. We've had a dramatic repricing of front end interest rates, the dollar and risk markets more broadly. After his comments yesterday, I think they were about as meaningful as an FOMC meeting, a Jackson hole meeting.
00:02:58.724 - 00:03:38.360, Speaker B: It really kind of took me a little bit by surprise. But I think the overall message is entirely consistent with what they've been saying, which is they're going to be data dependent. And what did we have? We just had a string of hot employment, price, you name it. All the data has been really strong. And so what's the Fed's response function? What's the only thing they can do is jack up front end interest rates. And now as we sit here, terminal rates are pricing at around 565 basis points and 75 basis points for the next two meetings. So some combination of 25 and 50 between the next two meetings.
00:03:38.360 - 00:03:57.334, Speaker B: So it's been pretty dramatic. And you've had s and P break 4k, bitcoin's testing 22k. Right now the dollar has broken out. Euro broke $106 through 136. And so it's been a very dramatic move.
00:03:57.374 - 00:04:01.006, Speaker A: Yeah, dollar is highest that it's DXY highest that it's been since November.
00:04:01.110 - 00:04:53.648, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. And it's one of those pain trades where a lot of folks were positioned this year to take advantage of dollar weakening as kind of we might have had hit peak terminal rates and the forces abroad were going to lead to more inflation and ECB might have to hike more, et cetera. So the big theme was short dollars going in and now it's the complete opposite. So folks are offsides, don't really have it. And the last thing I'll say about that is as the dollar is insanely powerful right now, you get paid carry because rates are 55 65. It's a risk off hedge in case the world is like we got to sell all risk assets, it's going to do well in that environment. And so it's a currency that's just got this unique combination of being a hedge but also being a hedge that pays.
00:04:53.648 - 00:05:04.336, Speaker B: And so it's really starting to get very compelling just to sit in dollars and just sit in overnight rates or short dated duration.
00:05:04.440 - 00:05:18.814, Speaker A: Goodness gracious. You've talked about this interesting character, these properties and characteristics of the dollar, how it's trading. But so if they raise 50 at the next meeting. They already raised 25. Right. The last meeting.
00:05:18.894 - 00:05:20.790, Speaker B: It's a big shift in policy that.
00:05:20.822 - 00:05:24.310, Speaker A: Would be very dramatic. Right. And that's what the market is pricing right now.
00:05:24.342 - 00:06:05.904, Speaker B: In theory. Like, the way to describe it is the bar is really high. For the fed to go from like communicating that they need to go from 50 to 25, doing that and then going back to 50, that might throw their credibility into question a little bit. However, at the same time, if they don't react to much hotter than expected data and they're telling you that they're data dependent, and they also, there are tons of fed members that believe in the sort of impact of front loading, which is just doing more of what you're going to do sooner rather than later, then they would also go against their credibility if they don't go 50.
00:06:05.984 - 00:06:06.712, Speaker A: That's crazy.
00:06:06.808 - 00:06:12.446, Speaker B: They're stuck. But Powell yesterday was like, hey, we'll.
00:06:12.470 - 00:06:13.566, Speaker A: Go 50 if we have to.
00:06:13.670 - 00:06:23.494, Speaker B: Basically. Well, it's to the point where the data has to miss really badly between now and March 22 or the next FOMC for us not to go 50.
00:06:23.574 - 00:06:25.110, Speaker A: Interesting. That's how he set it up.
00:06:25.222 - 00:06:25.718, Speaker B: That's how he set up.
00:06:25.726 - 00:06:29.742, Speaker A: Basically set it up like fifties, the likely outcome absent very different data.
00:06:29.798 - 00:06:41.034, Speaker B: And then the way to think about it is if he chooses to go 25 and the market's giving him 40 and he leaves 15 bps on the table, that's almost an easing of monetary policy in a way.
00:06:41.194 - 00:06:41.610, Speaker A: Right.
00:06:41.682 - 00:06:42.298, Speaker B: So.
00:06:42.466 - 00:06:43.690, Speaker A: Which he doesn't want to be doing.
00:06:43.762 - 00:07:00.570, Speaker B: He doesn't want to be doing. The other thing I'd be remiss, not to mention, is the historic levels of curve inversion that we have now just seen. We are talking about a 210s curve that has now broken 100 basis points. I think as we sit now, we're at 107 basis points of inversion.
00:07:00.642 - 00:07:03.772, Speaker A: Explain what this is real quick for our listeners if they don't know the inversion here.
00:07:03.938 - 00:07:19.256, Speaker B: So essentially what these curves measure is the difference between interest rates at different durations. At different durations. So the popular ones to look at are like two year versus ten year, or two year versus five year or two year versus 30.
00:07:19.280 - 00:07:24.496, Speaker A: So when it inverts now, typically you're supposed to get paid more to hold debt for longer. Right? That's the idea.
00:07:24.600 - 00:07:25.056, Speaker B: Correct.
00:07:25.160 - 00:07:27.672, Speaker A: And the opposite is true. Now you're getting paid.
00:07:27.808 - 00:08:18.582, Speaker B: Why is that one? It's a belief in the future path of Fed policy. So the market thinks that if you jack up rates to five, 6%, et cetera, what is that going to do? That's going to slow the economy down, that's going to slow growth down, that's going to slow investment down, and eventually the Fed will have to cut rates as a response to that. What the ten year point is telling you is that the front end interest rate policy is not going to last forever. The Fed's going to have to cut things down and that growth is going to be slower as a function of the damage that front end interest rate policy is going to do now. And it also has to do with expectations of where long run inflation are going to be. Right. So right now, one year inflation breakevens are around three and a half percent and two years are around three and a half percent.
00:08:18.582 - 00:08:27.018, Speaker B: So the market's telling you, even though the Fed wants to get to 2% inflation, that it's only going to get to three and a half with monetary.
00:08:27.066 - 00:08:30.890, Speaker A: Policy in the next two years pricing in what they expect from monetary policy.
00:08:31.002 - 00:08:41.698, Speaker B: Correct. Which is like, I mean, if I was the Fed, it would, I mean, it freaks me out a little bit because they're jacking, the market's telling me you got a jack rates to 560 and you still won't be at your.
00:08:41.706 - 00:08:43.642, Speaker A: Target, you won't hit your target is what the market is saying.
00:08:43.698 - 00:08:47.434, Speaker B: Yeah. And now the market can be wrong for sure. But, but right now looking at, I.
00:08:47.434 - 00:09:19.102, Speaker A: Mean, it's the best prediction market we've got. Right? I mean, there's no other real way to guess here. I mean, and then on the, on the inversion, the level of this two tens inversion. Cause I saw some stuff about this. Some researchers were saying that like, the other times that it invert that this level of inversion happened was like 1929 and like, and like the crisis in the seventies and then also in the eighties, right before Volker, like, did his thing. So like, very demonstratively, historically speaking, always precedes like a major economic problem.
00:09:19.238 - 00:09:34.614, Speaker B: Yeah, correct. So it's tricky. At the same time, we have this issue right now because the economy is so hot. We're talking about historic levels of unemployment, two job openings per unemployed person.
00:09:34.694 - 00:09:35.634, Speaker A: That's crazy.
00:09:36.774 - 00:09:40.114, Speaker B: And prices that are still going up.
00:09:40.494 - 00:09:45.046, Speaker A: In the non shelter searches the other times. And frankly, every time is different.
00:09:45.190 - 00:10:19.252, Speaker B: You could have a connection to the time. Every time is different. And to be honest with you, there's a reasonable case to be made that the growth trajectory of the US is totally fine. Just think about the kind of things that are happening, the structural things that have happened post COVID onshoring being a huge one of those things. You're bringing back domestic production into a really tight labor force. And you've also just had like, like generally a lot of underinvestment over the past couple of years. I mean, energy companies are being like a big part of it.
00:10:19.252 - 00:10:53.884, Speaker B: Like, what was the thing to do over the past couple of years? It was to take advantage of low interest rates. How did you take advantage of low interest rates? You issue a lot of debt and you buy back your stock, or you issue a lot of debt and you issue a dividend, not necessarily reinvestment. Reinvestment. The US, I think structurally is headed towards a period of onshoring, reinvestment, et cetera. And now, will the interest rate sensitive parts of the economy slow down? Yes, absolutely, they have to. And just mathematically, homes will get cheaper if mortgage rates rise.
00:10:53.964 - 00:10:55.756, Speaker A: Right. Fewer people will buy them.
00:10:55.900 - 00:11:00.300, Speaker B: Yeah, they have to. But that's not the whole economy.
00:11:00.372 - 00:11:01.220, Speaker A: Other stuff looks good, though.
00:11:01.252 - 00:11:40.592, Speaker B: Other stuff looks just fine. And that's why right now I keep struggling with this idea. Like, are you supposed to be long interest rate or short interest rates? It's really tough. Part of me is like, can the world, like, can the US economy really handle like 6% inflation, et cetera? And I really do think that a lot of the perception that the market has, and this is just kind of me self reflecting, is just a function of just the environment we've been in for the past couple of years. Right. I've never seen high interest rates in my entire career. For the most part, many people haven't.
00:11:40.592 - 00:12:02.328, Speaker B: Many people haven't. I've also been very us focused. When you talk to anybody that is based abroad, especially in Em, they know inflation's a tricky issue. I've seen it their whole lives. It's not something that just goes away. And so I think there's a lot of just bias in the US that's just used to low inflation.
00:12:02.416 - 00:12:04.784, Speaker A: Right. And if it gets high, then of course it will have to come down.
00:12:04.824 - 00:12:06.844, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. Because the economy will correct.
00:12:07.184 - 00:12:07.952, Speaker A: We do it here.
00:12:08.008 - 00:12:36.396, Speaker B: That's how we do it. But I think more and more as time progresses, we're like, holy shit, the US economy is just fine with interest rates at 5% plus. However, I do think you are supposed to realize that there are unintended consequences to monetary policy and we are at uncharted territory with respect to certain things. And that anytime you raise the cost of capital from zero to 6%, there are going to be lot a of.
00:12:36.410 - 00:12:37.524, Speaker A: Something's going to happen.
00:12:39.384 - 00:12:48.924, Speaker B: In the venture world, for example, or in the private world. I mean, you really, like, it's hard. Why are you taking the illiquid risk.
00:12:49.504 - 00:12:51.544, Speaker A: At high valuations for like ten years.
00:12:51.584 - 00:13:19.834, Speaker B: In some cases, when you can get 6% on low duration stuff? Those business models are going to be fundamentally challenged. And also basically business models that have lots of liabilities in the front end or floating liabilities. Right. And like, you know, one of the better examples is that I used to deal with a publicly listed company. Their whole business model was finance in the front end and buy assets in the back end, and all of a sudden they're totally underwater.
00:13:19.874 - 00:13:20.706, Speaker A: It's like reversed.
00:13:20.770 - 00:13:40.432, Speaker B: It's reversed. And if you think about it like the Fed's balance sheet right now, that's exactly what it is. They have these liabilities, which is they gotta pay these banks, you know, interest on excess reserves. What are interest on excess reserves? That's gonna be top of the band really high. Right. And what do they have on their balance sheet? A ton of assets.
00:13:40.488 - 00:13:42.520, Speaker A: Like long duration assets paying less.
00:13:42.592 - 00:13:48.320, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. I think the average duration of the fed bond portfolio is probably like six years, seven years, something like that.
00:13:48.512 - 00:13:50.320, Speaker A: But they've got overnight rates to pay.
00:13:50.392 - 00:13:56.712, Speaker B: They got to pay the banks. Yeah, they got to pay the banks on all their excess interest. And so that's how you become insolvent.
00:13:56.808 - 00:13:57.040, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:57.072 - 00:14:00.824, Speaker B: Something's got to give ultimately, but luckily it's paper losses.
00:14:00.864 - 00:14:15.298, Speaker A: And currently, right now you're saying it mostly looks okay in the economy, if not even maybe okay, maybe even great everything. Jobs. People have jobs. Here's the other real wages are still below inflation. Right. I mean, they're like, they're.
00:14:15.346 - 00:14:18.674, Speaker B: Yes, real wages have not grown.
00:14:18.794 - 00:14:19.714, Speaker A: Yes, they have.
00:14:19.794 - 00:14:46.594, Speaker B: But here's the thing. So it's different. Like, you have to think about it, like, from what time period? Because I think the wage growth has been a recent phenomenon versus, like, there were periods where folks were just not getting raises to keep up with it. Well, there was no inflation, so there weren't no raises. So you really have to focus on the time. But, yeah, I mean, 100 million Americans, because of the Social Security cost of living adjustments, they just got a raise.
00:14:46.674 - 00:14:46.890, Speaker A: Right.
00:14:46.922 - 00:14:49.730, Speaker B: And that's not necessarily wages, but that's.
00:14:49.802 - 00:14:50.562, Speaker A: Money in your pocket.
00:14:50.618 - 00:14:51.522, Speaker B: Money in your pocket.
00:14:51.578 - 00:14:59.330, Speaker A: Right. I saw a lot of the unions have negotiated significant raises like all the airlines are.
00:14:59.442 - 00:14:59.738, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:59.786 - 00:15:08.790, Speaker A: So there are a lot of people who are making more money, too. But I just mean to bottle that all up, like, like you said, like, there is. There is structurally a lot of structural positivity in the economy.
00:15:08.902 - 00:15:09.374, Speaker B: Yes.
00:15:09.454 - 00:15:13.394, Speaker A: And it can clearly, it appears at the moment to be bearing these rates.
00:15:14.174 - 00:15:36.634, Speaker B: And the other risk I think is really important to highlight is you have a nation of 1.3 billion people that is just reopening. I know China Powell is being asked about it, but there are huge risks to the commodity complex. God forbid oil starts spiking again and all of a sudden people are like, wait, gas prices are up and there's a pass through feedback loop of energy prices into the prices of everything.
00:15:37.214 - 00:15:41.566, Speaker A: Not to mention, oil is a component and many other materials. Right? Like, absolutely.
00:15:41.630 - 00:15:46.614, Speaker B: Plastic. Like all of the above. And so there's still upside risks.
00:15:46.654 - 00:15:48.194, Speaker A: This is such a tricky man.
00:15:48.654 - 00:15:49.406, Speaker B: It is.
00:15:49.550 - 00:15:55.198, Speaker A: What's it feel like? I mean. I mean, you're, you know, you're not, like you. You're. You've been in markets a long time, but, you know, not for decades.
00:15:55.246 - 00:15:55.542, Speaker B: Yes.
00:15:55.598 - 00:16:01.502, Speaker A: So. And like you said, your whole career has been in a low interest rate environment, along with basically. Basically anyone who's worked in the low volume.
00:16:01.518 - 00:16:03.234, Speaker B: Low interest rates are low volume.
00:16:04.054 - 00:16:06.634, Speaker A: This is a very different, tricky environment.
00:16:07.714 - 00:16:08.586, Speaker B: You know, I think.
00:16:08.650 - 00:16:09.698, Speaker A: Is it more fun?
00:16:09.866 - 00:16:10.586, Speaker B: It is really fun.
00:16:10.610 - 00:16:11.618, Speaker A: Like, just as a trader, I think.
00:16:11.666 - 00:16:12.706, Speaker B: As a trader, it is more fun.
00:16:12.730 - 00:16:14.294, Speaker A: So much interesting stuff happening.
00:16:15.114 - 00:16:35.338, Speaker B: It's just so dynamic that you just have to adjust your risk. Right. Like, trading ten k of dv zero one, like three years ago, is very different than trading ten k dv one. Now, like, when the stuff moves three times more, you gotta be taking a third the risk. Right. And so it's very dynamic and it really keeps you on your toes.
00:16:35.386 - 00:16:38.858, Speaker A: Yeah. Love it. Bimnetabibi galaxy trading as always, my friend, thank you so much.
00:16:38.946 - 00:16:39.546, Speaker B: Pleasure.
00:16:39.690 - 00:16:45.522, Speaker A: Let's go to our friend Christine Kim from Galaxy Research. It's been a little while since you've been on the podcast. Great to have you back, as always.
00:16:45.618 - 00:16:47.354, Speaker C: Thank you, Alex. It's great to be back.
00:16:47.434 - 00:17:01.354, Speaker A: Yes. And so we're gonna talk about a couple things, but you were at, let's start with ETH Denver, this giant conference that happened last week. You were there, you spoke at the conference and moderated a panel. What's your big takeaway? I mean, it looked like a pretty big conference on twitter.
00:17:01.474 - 00:17:18.465, Speaker C: Yeah. I was so impressed with how massive the conference was. They switched from the sports castle venue to. To the national western complex venue, which is actually a venue for cattle and ranch and to showcase, like, livestock.
00:17:18.569 - 00:17:18.905, Speaker A: Wow.
00:17:18.969 - 00:17:48.936, Speaker C: So they filled every square footage, every square foot of this massive barn, almost, with a bunch of crypto people. And there were like five different districts. They had all the Defi booths in one area, all of the infrastructure development in another area. So I was really impressed with the scope of all of the conversations that were happening. It's like they touched on every single aspect of Ethereum, like protocol development and app development.
00:17:49.040 - 00:18:01.004, Speaker A: So did this feel like. I think the last one that you went to was Devcon, which is the more developer focused conference. And it was in Bogota, Colombia this year. That was like six months ago. How is this different than that?
00:18:01.464 - 00:18:36.104, Speaker C: Honestly, the nature of the conversations were pretty similar. I felt like after Devcon, it was right after the merge, and so people were so still really enthusiastic with how successful that was, and they were looking ahead to. Okay, what's next? I think there's still a big question mark about what's the big narrative on Ethereum. And at Denver, you could see a lot of the same mini narratives around Zke vms, the roll up future, what we're going to do about Mev, what's after the merge. So I think there were just a lot more of the same discussions happening at ETH Denver.
00:18:37.224 - 00:18:44.728, Speaker A: But, like, the composition of the conference. Right. This is a little bit more of like an exuberant, like, community conference as opposed to like a developer focused one. Right.
00:18:44.816 - 00:18:52.848, Speaker C: Yeah. Devcon was much more focused, I think, on protocol development. Whereas, Ethan, where you had big ten, Ethereum, everyone's invited.
00:18:53.016 - 00:18:53.536, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:18:53.640 - 00:19:00.440, Speaker C: You had the VC's, you had all of the Dapp developers. It was quite massive.
00:19:00.512 - 00:19:15.192, Speaker A: Yeah. And it was fun. Right? I mean, I saw some pictures of parties and stuff. People dressed up in funny costumes. You know, obviously I saw the. I'm not gonna say cringey, but some people said cringy opening, singing stuff. Were you at that?
00:19:15.368 - 00:19:17.924, Speaker C: No, thankfully, I skipped out on that.
00:19:18.704 - 00:19:29.072, Speaker A: It was better than past years. I'll give it to him, though. Some of the past songs have been even worse, but this one was kind of funny. But anyway, it seemed like a fun, lively time.
00:19:29.248 - 00:19:43.772, Speaker C: Yeah, it really was. I think the events that were happening were quite. It made me feel like we weren't in a bear market. It was like people were completely back, just like spending all their money on these events and hosting these events. It was a good time.
00:19:43.948 - 00:20:22.834, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, so I want to pick up on a thread that you mentioned about the sort of narratives between Bogota and Denver, the big topics of the day for Ethereum. I mean, obviously we thought the merge in Shanghai, which I would say formally completes the merge by finally, it's sort of the last piece of the puzzle for the specific merch and switch to proof of stake. But was that like the main thing that people were talking about or these other big issues? Right, like privacy, decentralizing, you know, block builders, Mev, et cetera. Like, have we made progress since Bogota? Like it's been about six months.
00:20:23.174 - 00:20:49.684, Speaker C: I think there's been incremental progress. And surprisingly, yeah, the focus wasn't on Shanghai. The focus wasn't on staked ETH withdrawals. Everyone, I think, has already thought of this as, like you said, the last step towards completing the merge. It's the easiest step of completing the merge. There doesn't seem to be a lot of concern around cell pressure immediately after Shanghai. There doesn't seem to be quite a lot of concern around the technical risks around Shanghai.
00:20:49.684 - 00:21:25.592, Speaker C: So the discussions kind of felt fragmented. Like if you're kind of a dapp developer in Defi, you're searching for what is the next innovation in Defi. If you're kind of like a MeV searcher or builder, you're thinking about the incentives of the MEV supply chain. So a lot of the events and a lot of the discussions I felt like were kind of siloed. But it just goes to show that outside of Ethereum protocol development, so much more is happening. And for Ethereum to succeed, you kind of need, you kind of need the input and the continued progress of all these other collectives.
00:21:25.648 - 00:21:26.560, Speaker A: And there were a lot of them.
00:21:26.632 - 00:22:13.274, Speaker C: And there were a lot, and it was really hard to keep track of, like the incremental progress being done in each of them. And there wasn't like a big milestone that any of these groups had reached. So I think I was kind of bouncing around thinking like, wow, Ethereum feels like a sprawling city. It feels like you built a technology that has now created so much more innovation, permissionless innovation to happen on top of Ethereum. But unfortunately, it doesn't seem like, you know, there's a clear path towards like, incentivizing continued innovation in one area over the other or like the success of one segment of the community over another. It just feels very discombobulated.
00:22:13.354 - 00:22:16.898, Speaker A: Everyone's just moving in a direction, in some direction with a lot of people.
00:22:16.986 - 00:22:17.386, Speaker C: Yup.
00:22:17.450 - 00:22:18.810, Speaker A: A lot of people building stuff.
00:22:18.882 - 00:22:19.258, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:22:19.306 - 00:22:22.202, Speaker A: A whole bunch of different ideas that are all getting built, basically.
00:22:22.298 - 00:22:22.642, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:22:22.698 - 00:22:26.694, Speaker A: And so not one cohesive narrative you felt like coming out of there?
00:22:26.814 - 00:23:15.956, Speaker C: Not at all. And I think that, I mean, one thing, though, I will say is there does seem to be this focus on more infrastructure development over app development of, like, we can't build the super app on Ethereum now because there's no infrastructure to support it, either wallet infrastructure or just the protocol can't sustain a high level of user activity. Like, it doesn't scale. So there does seem to be quite a lot of focus on if we're able to build the right infrastructure, like the right rails, then maybe that'll be the catalyst for what's next in DeFi, what's next in nfTs, what's next in gaming. So there was. I did think there was more conversation still around infrastructure development than app development, but I know you hate that, Alex, and you're always like, we don't need better infrastructure. We need apps.
00:23:16.020 - 00:24:08.692, Speaker A: I mean, we may need both, but yes, it's usually like, it comes down to this question about whether or not we're so early, right? People are, like, often not just in the Ethereum world at all, but across the cryptocurrency landscape, right? Long term bulls are like, oh, we're so early. The bitcoin, or say this all the time, too. And I'm just looking around being like, are we early? Or like, is it like, shouldn't we, as a general ecosystem, really be providing things people want to use? Right? And when I look at the space, like, I see bitcoin as a global money, I see ethereum as the dominant platform for smart contracting. And the apps that people like so far at scale is like, Defi and nfTs. And I really don't see anything else yet. And by the way, that's a lot. I mean, I think if you have bitcoin, ETH, Defi and nfTs, obviously, and then maybe stable coins, right? But, like, that's gotten us here.
00:24:08.692 - 00:24:38.812, Speaker A: Like, I mean, I don't know. Like, you can't just. Yet another Defi app to me is, like, not, not going to move the needle on global adoption. So it's not that I don't like infrastructure. And I hear this all the time, too. There was a protocol that launched, and I talked to an investor in that protocol and I said, like, aren't, you know, what's the thesis here? And they're like, well, you know, like, there's all these apps that we need, like, much higher throughput to do. And I'm just sort of like, isn't that what every single protocol investor said literally over the last ten years.
00:24:38.812 - 00:24:50.536, Speaker A: Right. Like, is this now? Yes, it is what they all said. Maybe it's still true. Right. And I think Ethereum. I mean, the hope here, I think, is that the roll up ecosystem can be that.
00:24:50.640 - 00:24:51.928, Speaker C: Yeah, we'll be that catalyst.
00:24:51.976 - 00:25:05.296, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's not that I don't want infrastructure, it's just that I sort of think, like, we really. We need both. Maybe we need both. The argument was that, like, we can't get the killer app until we have the infrastructure to support it. I don't know if that's true. Yeah, but if it is true, then of course we need it.
00:25:05.296 - 00:25:25.412, Speaker A: I'm just. I just feel like there's been a lot of thinkery on blockchain design. Thinkery. Shout out to Walt Smith, I think, who created this word. And I think there needs to be apps that people want. And I feel like a lot of effort has been put in on the blockchain design. And maybe, I guess there's been a lot of effort on the apps, too.
00:25:25.412 - 00:25:38.066, Speaker A: I guess I'm just asking a lot here. Someone make the killer global adoption app. I guess it's not that easy, but yeah. Yeah. They are building infrastructure, though. The roll ups well represented there and people building stuff like that.
00:25:38.090 - 00:26:20.622, Speaker C: All the ZK and roll ups were very well represented at East Denver. But again, because of the massive size of this event, they were just one small part of the collective of this mosaic of so many different groups there. Actually, now that I'm talking about this, the one group that I think was a little underrepresented in all of these topics was regulation. Every time I brought up what we think is going to happen to stablecoin regulation, what we think might happen to liquid staking derivatives, not a lot of companies. Not a lot of concern, really, from anyone I met about regulation. Just thinking that regulators would eventually come to embrace the technology over time, but until then, whatever, basically. Yeah.
00:26:20.798 - 00:26:22.594, Speaker A: To be clear, these are the builders.
00:26:22.894 - 00:26:23.158, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:26:23.166 - 00:26:37.284, Speaker A: And these are the builders primarily. They're not the. Necessarily the investors or the institutions primarily. This is more of people building stuff in the Ethereum world conference. So I guess it's not, you know, I mean, you can still permissionlessly deploy software.
00:26:37.624 - 00:26:38.480, Speaker C: Yeah. And I think there's.
00:26:38.512 - 00:26:40.960, Speaker A: Whether or not people are allowed to use it, I guess, is a different question.
00:26:41.072 - 00:26:58.966, Speaker C: That, too. And there's a lot more technology, I think, being built on Ethereum in a permissioned way, like creating web front ends that are only available in certain countries, interacting, like allowing your technology to only be available to non us customers, et cetera, those kinds of, kind of.
00:26:59.030 - 00:27:02.758, Speaker A: So there's been some innovations on that side of the. If we can call them that.
00:27:02.846 - 00:27:07.798, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't know if we can call them innovations, but more so, like, tiptoeing around the big elephant in the room.
00:27:07.846 - 00:27:14.862, Speaker A: Yeah. And remember we wrote about OfAC when they tornado cash was sanctioned, and this was a big question for us as well.
00:27:14.918 - 00:27:15.594, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:27:16.014 - 00:28:08.158, Speaker A: And not even sort of just regulation, but the recent oasis, the, what they called a self counterexploit, where they used the multisig to upgrade their t five apps, their defi apps, such that they could then seize money from the wormhole hacker, which was like a week or two ago. That, plus some of the regulatory stuff, like, has there been. Did you get a sense that there's a strong. I mean, because you just talked about some of the more permission sort of solutions, is there a turn in favor of more hardened, decentralized solutions as well? In your mind, was that a vibe that was there, like we should, for example, not have admin keys or decentralized more, or an increased focus on decentralizing block builders or validators or whatever? Obviously, is decentralization alive and well in the Ethereum mind share or is it even accelerating?
00:28:08.326 - 00:28:43.834, Speaker C: I wish it was accelerating. I wish more people talked about what happened to the Oasis defi app. I wish more people continued to talk about the concerns around oFAC sanctioning tornado cash implications of it. I wish there had been more talk around. There hasn't been a ton of movement towards censorship, like making Ethereum more censorship resistant in light of all of these actions, in light of all these regulatory developments. Again, those kinds of conversations that I tried, that I feel like some people tried to bring up at the conference were promptly struck down.
00:28:44.854 - 00:28:46.470, Speaker A: People just weren't interested in talking about this.
00:28:46.502 - 00:28:55.062, Speaker C: They weren't. And I think people were more focused on heads down building. Yeah. And I think it should have been a more important conversation. It should have.
00:28:55.118 - 00:29:12.086, Speaker A: Yeah, we've talked about this, you and I, about that. We think in general, it should be an important conversation. Yeah. All right, let's move on a little bit. It sounds like it was a great time. Check out Christine's talk. You can find it on, like, the ETH Denver YouTube page and the website that was really good about Shanghai, the forthcoming upgrade on Ethereum, where staked ETH will finally be able to be unlocked.
00:29:12.086 - 00:29:32.064, Speaker A: There are people who staked their ETH on the beacon chain in the end of 2020. I believe that it's been there for more than almost two and a half years without being able to withdraw it or the rewards that they've earned. That should come to an end with the rollout of Shanghai which will enable withdrawals. When?
00:29:32.964 - 00:29:36.900, Speaker C: Right now. The latest estimations are second week of April, early April.
00:29:36.972 - 00:29:38.420, Speaker A: For straight up mainnet activation.
00:29:38.532 - 00:30:23.522, Speaker C: Yeah, for mainnet activation. Developers have made a ton of progress getting Shanghai ready as soon as possible. Honestly, I thought that it was going to be summertime by the time Ethereum got to its next upgrade after the merge, but developers have really been barreling through all of the test nets, all of the kind of preparations to get all the software clients prepared ready for this upgrade. So the next big milestone in this testing journey is the Gourlay upgrade. That's the last public testnet that Ethereum developers are going to be launching the Shanghai upgrade on. And if that goes smoothly they'll move on to Mainnet. So Guerli is scheduled for, for, I feel like it's March 12, so it's soon.
00:30:23.578 - 00:30:24.986, Speaker A: That's like next week or the week after.
00:30:25.010 - 00:31:15.798, Speaker C: Yeah, I might have to double check my notes on that. But anyways in the next couple of weeks. Yeah, they scheduled the date and from that date you're going to assume that developers give about four weeks until Mainnet got it. Which is how we get the second week of April date. Got it. So gorally, I think one interesting thing is that developers have been testing Shanghai on several different testnets before Worley, and Worley I think is less of a testnet for developers and more of a testnet for infrastructure providers for staking pools for staking as a service like centralized exchanges for entities like Lido and Rocketpool. I think developers are quite confident about the code, but the question is, is the community ready for this upgrade? Wallet providers particularly need to be able to update the balances of users for withdrawals.
00:31:15.798 - 00:31:34.074, Speaker C: And the curious thing about withdrawals is they're not user transactions, they're like system level operations that happen. So you need to be able to connect to different API endpoints in order to correctly kind of like keep track of that activity. Got it. So guerrilla I think is going to be a really important testnet for the community.
00:31:34.454 - 00:32:04.190, Speaker A: So, and you mentioned that we don't think there's going to be a lot of like ETH cell pressure. Christine and our colleague shout out Kelly Greer at Galaxy wrote a report about this. What would Shanghai, I forget what we called it, what would Shanghai's effect be on ETH USD where you did some of the math here and using various assumptions. Do we still think that's true? Run us through what you thought about for that analysis. You've got staked ETH and then you've got the rewards, primarily these two pieces of ETH that they have. Yeah.
00:32:04.262 - 00:32:29.480, Speaker C: And our conclusion, and our assumption was that you wouldn't see a lot of people unstaking their ethnicity, and primarily because most of the ETH staked is still underwater. It's not ETH price is a lot lower than it was when people had staked around the majority of staked ETH. There's also liquid staking derivatives, where if people wanted the liquidity, they could have traded off their staked ETH for ETH already if they were using lido or something like that.
00:32:29.512 - 00:32:29.752, Speaker A: Right.
00:32:29.808 - 00:32:45.308, Speaker C: So for that and a couple other reasons, we had argued that we wouldn't see a lot of unstaking activity, but we would probably see ethereum validators take some profit from rewards. And rewards are really what's going to become liquid immediately at Shanghai.
00:32:45.356 - 00:32:47.436, Speaker A: There's no queue, there's no exit queue or anything. Right?
00:32:47.500 - 00:33:02.727, Speaker C: There's not a queue, but there is a limit to how many withdrawals the network can process at one time. They can't just withdraw the rewards. For every single validator in one go, it's 16 withdrawals that are able to be processed per block. And every block gets processed in 2022.
00:33:02.727 - 00:33:10.164, Speaker A: But that's still just a couple days, right? Ultimately, if everyone tried to withdraw all their rewards right away, it wouldn't be like months. We're talking a few days, right?
00:33:10.244 - 00:33:44.084, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, we're talking a few days, but that also, there's a little bit of a caveat there, because some validators have to update their withdrawal credentials, they have to specify an address to which those rewards can be deposited. But the point is there's about a million ETH that's gonna be become liquid as a result of rewards pretty quick. Yeah. And to find the number, like the percentage of rewards that we think are gonna be sold, it's really anecdotal. We're talking to validator node operators, we're talking to independent home stakers, we're talking to people we know who have staked on the beacon chain say, what are.
00:33:44.084 - 00:33:44.820, Speaker A: You gonna do with these?
00:33:44.892 - 00:34:04.064, Speaker C: Exactly. And anecdotally we're hearing a number between 30% to 50% of their rewards. Validators just wanna sell. Yeah. And the rest, you know, it's a mixture between restaking, putting it into defi, holding onto it. There's a variety of other kind of reasons. For what they wanna do with that ETH.
00:34:04.064 - 00:34:50.220, Speaker C: So in our analysis, we conservatively estimated that 50% of rewards would be sold off, like the week after Shanghai or throughout the week of Shanghai. So you will see a little bit of sell pressure, I think, immediately after the upgrade, but not a lot. And then I think you're going to see a ton more staking activity because now the kind of the uncertainty around when you're going to be able to withdraw your stake is removed. We're already seeing a ton of staking activity going into Lido. Lido experience the largest inflows of ETH ever a couple of weeks ago. And I think you're just gonna see the staking rate. So basically, the percentage of total e supply staked dramatically increased, which is now.
00:34:50.252 - 00:34:51.876, Speaker A: What, like 14 or 15%, right?
00:34:51.900 - 00:34:52.308, Speaker C: Was that 15?
00:34:52.356 - 00:35:02.236, Speaker A: Yeah, 15%, if not 16. And one other thing to mention, you said that you didn't think that there'll be a lot of actual unstaking of the actual staked ETH.
00:35:02.380 - 00:35:04.516, Speaker C: No. If anything, I think there's gonna be more ETH stakes.
00:35:04.580 - 00:35:19.768, Speaker A: Right. Because some of the, some of the, the uncertainty is now removed. And when you mentioned underwater, the price is a lot lower today than when a lot of the ETH was staked. I think it was like 60% of the ETH was staked at higher prices.
00:35:19.816 - 00:35:20.764, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly.
00:35:21.464 - 00:35:31.952, Speaker A: What's the idea there? Is it that you don't have to sell, you don't have gains to realize. So if anything, you have losses to realize. But also, you were early. You're probably an ETH bull.
00:35:32.008 - 00:35:34.414, Speaker C: So, yeah, I think if there had.
00:35:34.454 - 00:35:38.526, Speaker A: Been, you'd be a forced seller to be selling at these low levels. You'd have to be, like in significant.
00:35:38.630 - 00:35:47.270, Speaker C: Distress, which with liquid staking derivatives today that are trading almost on par with ETH. Like, if you were a for seller, there are ways to sell your ETH.
00:35:47.302 - 00:35:54.766, Speaker A: But, like, people who stake during beacon chain only era pre unlocks pre unstaking. Like they're long term ETH bowls. Right?
00:35:54.830 - 00:35:55.118, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:35:55.166 - 00:36:00.990, Speaker A: So they're not like, oh, crap, get me out of the seat position. Much less likely to be so than, say, just a normal person.
00:36:01.102 - 00:36:01.746, Speaker C: Right.
00:36:01.910 - 00:36:02.658, Speaker A: That makes sense.
00:36:02.746 - 00:36:12.378, Speaker C: This bear market is kind of a blessing in disguise, because if we were in a bull market and ETH prices were a lot higher, I think there could be a lot more reason to sell now.
00:36:12.466 - 00:36:25.954, Speaker A: Right. So then the staking participation rate, you think it'll go higher because it's de risked a bit once Shanghai happens. Also, right. When we look at other proof of stake networks, they have significantly higher staking rates than ETH, right?
00:36:26.074 - 00:36:26.378, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:36:26.426 - 00:36:28.734, Speaker A: Do you think it'll get that high to like 50%?
00:36:28.914 - 00:37:08.482, Speaker C: Well, not immediately, but you talk about this all the time, Alex, that as a proof of stake, in a proof of stake blockchain, if you're not staking your asset, you're essentially being diluted out of your holdings. And with liquid stake derivatives, I don't know why anyone would hold their ETH and be diluted out of ETH when you could stake it and still have the liquidity of that staked asset. And so I think it doesn't make sense for the staking rate of ethereum to stay low. I think the easier liquid, the more, more adopted liquid stake derivatives become. You're going to see there's no reason not to have 100% of the stake.
00:37:08.538 - 00:37:22.086, Speaker A: I mean, if you trust the stake, the LSD, the liquid staking derivative token, trust it, right? Like, you know, I don't know, it's decentralized enough or whatever, right? Shouldn't you just be staking everything and then only using staked ETH for everything?
00:37:22.190 - 00:37:23.102, Speaker C: I think that you can't pay for.
00:37:23.118 - 00:37:27.470, Speaker A: Gas and staked ETH, though, right? So you need ETH for gas, but then it really becomes this, like.
00:37:27.622 - 00:37:28.950, Speaker C: But there's got to be staking in.
00:37:28.982 - 00:37:33.918, Speaker A: Gas token, basically, right? Everybody else uses like staked ETH.
00:37:34.046 - 00:37:48.622, Speaker C: Also, one funny thing, when I said that there wasn't really a lot of regulatory talk, a lot of people corrected me for saying liquid staking derivatives because of regulatory concerns. Like now we call them either liquid staking tokens or liquid staking receipts.
00:37:48.678 - 00:37:49.350, Speaker A: Oh, they don't like the idea.
00:37:49.382 - 00:37:51.630, Speaker C: Derivatives is a taboo word now.
00:37:51.702 - 00:37:55.206, Speaker A: I mean, it makes sense, obviously. Obviously derivatives are financial instruments, but it's.
00:37:55.230 - 00:37:59.190, Speaker C: Funny that they like, you know, as a political correctness.
00:37:59.302 - 00:38:03.782, Speaker A: Yes. I mean, yeah, they. And it's funny because actually this happens all the time.
00:38:03.838 - 00:38:04.094, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:38:04.134 - 00:38:23.766, Speaker A: So you have like, real world assets that people talk about tokenizing, bringing on chain, like makerdao. Right? And they call them RWA, but that's, that already exists. That's risk weighted assets in traditional finance. Right? So that, and they don't mean, like derivatives like they mean in financial instruments. They mean derivations. They mean that these tokens are derived from liquids from staking. Right.
00:38:23.766 - 00:38:37.582, Speaker A: They're liquid derivations. So it's like they, you know, they weren't wrong, but I get that sensitivity, I would say. They're not like forwards. They're not. They're not like financial derivatives. They're really sort of like. They are more like receipts.
00:38:37.718 - 00:38:38.246, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:38:38.350 - 00:39:07.270, Speaker A: They're giving you rights to stake deeth. Like. Yeah, so it's a little different. That's funny, though. What? Okay, so along the same lines, we're talking about staking rates. Like there was news. I guess we've covered this in the past when it was first announced, but I guess in the last day or two, this institutional staking project, which I think used to be called alluvial, it now sounds like they call themselves the liquid staking collective, but it's some kind of partnership involving Coinbase and I think figment.
00:39:07.270 - 00:39:14.222, Speaker A: I think. So something else. They announced their own liquid staking token.
00:39:14.398 - 00:39:44.150, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that, like yesterday. Yeah. When we covered this, the interesting part of this was that it was targeted towards institutions. There hadn't been a lot of liquid staking as a service back in 2020, 2021 that was targeted away from retail towards institutions. Mainly because institutions didn't really want to stake on Ethereum at the time either. The merge, planning for the merge was a little bit chaotic. Developers were going back and forth, like how we're going to actually transition this thing into proof of stake.
00:39:44.150 - 00:39:47.114, Speaker C: You weren't able to withdraw your stake at all.
00:39:47.444 - 00:39:59.612, Speaker A: I mean, it was mostly like the guys from bankless and Anthony Cisano. It was like long term, technically savvy ETH bowls. Vitalik was staking back then.
00:39:59.708 - 00:40:31.276, Speaker C: There wasn't a huge, I think, customer base or appetite for institutional snaking. But now, take the announcement of the SEC cracking down on Kraken, calling their liquid staking program, like, basically shutting down their liquid staking program. I think with Shanghai coming up, Shanghai de risking a lot of staking activity on Ethereum, suddenly there is a lot more appetite for an institutional grade staking solution. And that is why I think we're seeing the announcement from Coinbase. I think that's why we're seeing more progress on the alluvial process, because we.
00:40:31.300 - 00:40:42.780, Speaker A: Haven'T heard anything about it in like six months, I think, if I don't have the episode number. But we talked about this on Galaxy brains, I think last summer, so summer 22, and we really haven't heard anything.
00:40:42.812 - 00:40:45.452, Speaker C: About it since then, but until recently, until yesterday.
00:40:45.508 - 00:40:51.158, Speaker A: Until yesterday. So we have to assume there's been real progress. But also, you're saying the timing of the announcement makes sense.
00:40:51.316 - 00:41:11.050, Speaker C: Yeah. And I think it's interesting to question how Coinbase is going to square a staking service like alluvial, or the one from the liquid staking collective with the staking service that they already have, which is geared towards retail, and the potential that their retail staking service could be compromised by screwdrivers. The SEC.
00:41:11.202 - 00:41:38.966, Speaker A: Right, we're not going to go deep into this topic necessarily. Now, the Kraken and the staking as a service, but Coinbase notably has pushed back, heavily, said that their program doesn't look like Kraken. So, and I don't think we've heard any news since that. So as far as I know, you can still stake on Coinbase or Ethereum, and they have their own liquid staking token Cbeth. So this is also interesting. So this will be like institutions, only liquid staking token or something.
00:41:39.030 - 00:41:54.282, Speaker C: Only the institutions can be the node operators for this staking program. I'm not 100% sure if the holders of the liquid staking token also have to be institutions. I think they have to be, at the very least be Kyc'd in Aml.
00:41:54.338 - 00:42:41.012, Speaker A: It's interesting, it remains to be seen how the announcement of this, that this institutional staking as a service provider will have its own liquid staking token remains to be seen what that means exactly, but interesting nonetheless. It's also funny because a lot of the other coins have staking as a service and stake, and they don't have a shanghai, most of them, you can already enter and exit. The staking validators can enter next to the network. It's really the Shanghai question is an ETH question only. So that's the other thing I think about when I think about Shanghai and unlocks is like, how does this affect the general economics of Ethereum? Right? We don't like at scale, right?
00:42:41.108 - 00:43:14.574, Speaker C: Yeah. It's going to stress test a part of Ethereum's economics that have never been tested before, which is the ability to withdraw your stake, the ability to fully exit from the network. And to be clear, like validators on Lino, validators on rocket pool are not able to unstake. People can't actually redeem their steth for ETH right now. And so there are certain smart contracts that will be tested for the first time on Lido. Lido V two is a big upgrade that we saw just a couple days ago. They had a bug, an unknown bug in their withdrawal contracts for stigmatic.
00:43:14.574 - 00:44:00.422, Speaker C: So these are big. This is tech that needs to be tested. So I am very interested in how the unstaking activity will go. And I'm also interested in seeing how the bifurcation of the liquid staking market between permission, KYC, AML participants and not, will also then trickle into, say, a bifurcated or fragmented deFi market on top of these two existing, say, liquid staking derivatives. Well, I shouldn't say derivative, but receipts, because at the basis of what staking does is it allows for a risk free interest rate on your ETH. Then on top of that, you can start to create other financial instruments.
00:44:00.518 - 00:44:01.278, Speaker A: It's very interesting.
00:44:01.326 - 00:44:08.698, Speaker C: Yeah. But you have to make sure that the underlying asset is kosher, is like solid enough that you can build these other financial instruments.
00:44:08.746 - 00:44:28.258, Speaker A: On top of a lot happening and a lot to be seen in the next month or so, too with Shanghai will be very exciting, I think. And I mean, it will really close a chapter. This is the completion of the merge when it happens, which is, I think we all agreed was probably the biggest protocol development story of 2022, right?
00:44:28.346 - 00:44:31.514, Speaker C: Yeah. Until developers decide to change it again.
