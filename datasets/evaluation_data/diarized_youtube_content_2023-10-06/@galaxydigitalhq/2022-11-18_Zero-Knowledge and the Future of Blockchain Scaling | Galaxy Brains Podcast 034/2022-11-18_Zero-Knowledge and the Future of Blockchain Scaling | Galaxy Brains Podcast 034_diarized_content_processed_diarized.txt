00:00:01.400 - 00:00:28.914, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmware research at Galaxy Digital. We have a great show for you today. We're calling it the ZK show, the Zero Knowledge show. We're going to talk with Christine Kim, our friend, about Zkevm's the future, the holy grail of ethereum scaling. We're also going to talk about whether that can ever be used on bitcoin as well. It's going to be a great conversation.
00:00:28.914 - 00:00:55.054, Speaker A: We're also going to talk markets with Bimnet Abibi, our friend from Galaxy Digital trading. But before we get into all of that, please refer to the disclaimers in the link on the podcast notes. And note that none of the information provided during this podcast constitutes investment advice or recommendation, solicitation, or offer by Galaxy Digital or its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Got that disclaimer out of the way. Let's get into it.
00:00:59.054 - 00:01:04.674, Speaker B: I actually think that was pretty good. Fairly. Fairly. Okay.
00:01:06.214 - 00:01:19.118, Speaker A: That's our friend, Christine Kim. Thank you for complimenting my intro. Christine, you are back. I still saying this? Cause, like, it feels like you were gone. You were on vacation in Bogota, but you were back last week. So I know it's crazy, but, you know, how's it been going? Welcome.
00:01:19.206 - 00:01:35.890, Speaker B: It's been going all right. I think the New York weather is still depressing. I mean, the weather in Bogota was still amazing. And also in South Carolina when I was on vacation, there hasn't been that much going on in terms of news lately either. So it's been pretty slow these last couple of years. And crypto, yeah.
00:01:35.962 - 00:01:49.170, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, it's been low volatility and some hacks here and there. There's obviously news. The industry is pretty big. But I agree. It hasn't been like a giant news period. One thing outside of crypto, though, that has got me.
00:01:49.170 - 00:02:02.056, Speaker A: You know what? I'm frankly upset. Okay. I'm a New Englander at my core, and Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen are getting divorced. It's apparently final. I know it's been happening for. I'm sad about this. I mean, first he divorced.
00:02:02.080 - 00:02:04.784, Speaker B: Why are you sad? This is someone else's personal business.
00:02:04.904 - 00:02:37.540, Speaker A: Alex, I don't think you know the Brady and Bundchen core that we have up in New England. This was like a. When I was literally like six years old until 14 or 15, the New England Patriots were just garbage. Just terrible. They were briefly, almost good with Drew Bledsoe and then he got injured, and for 20 years, okay, we went on the most epic run, and we just love this player. And then he had this great family, and they still are, you know, they're still great. It just saddens me.
00:02:37.540 - 00:02:46.900, Speaker A: Okay. He divorced from New England, and now they're getting divorced also. It just feels like, you know, my whole patriots world is shattering still.
00:02:47.012 - 00:02:52.344, Speaker B: What happens to their joint sponsorship of FTX? Will we still see commercials with them together?
00:02:52.764 - 00:03:12.556, Speaker A: But kind of now, I don't know if that's. If that's in the separation agreement. I did read today that they had ironclad prenups, which makes sense. Cause they're both extremely wealthy, successful people in their own rights, so there's really no need to, I guess, merge all their money. But I'm just. I'm sad about it. You know, it's just.
00:03:12.556 - 00:03:30.706, Speaker A: It's something. Another thing I've been paying a lot of attention to. We're not gonna talk a lot, but Twitter. I mean, Twitter is now a private company, right. Taken private by Elon Musk, et al. And, gosh, it's been interesting already. He's working on one of the most interesting problems in crypto networks, which is Sybil resistance.
00:03:30.706 - 00:03:36.042, Speaker A: He is trying to fix the spam and bot problem on Twitter by making.
00:03:36.138 - 00:03:42.610, Speaker B: Everyone pay more, basically by putting a dollar amount to everything that you can possibly do on Twitter.
00:03:42.682 - 00:03:56.904, Speaker A: It's true. But I will say we know this from blockchains. The simplest way to stop. Stop spam in an open system where you don't have to be permissioned is to charge a fee. Right?
00:03:57.324 - 00:03:58.196, Speaker B: Simple as that.
00:03:58.260 - 00:04:29.702, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, so that's what he's looking at, which is kind of funny. There are some interesting ideas that people have put forth around verifiable credentials, which could also help. But keep in mind, this would solve two birds. Two birds with 1 st for Musk and Twitter, which is they also need revenue. And also the people on Twitter love it, so it probably would pay for it. But it's interesting because the people around him, now, though, you have CZ, the CEO and founder of Binance, is an investor and owner of Twitter.
00:04:29.838 - 00:04:31.154, Speaker B: CZ, that man.
00:04:31.614 - 00:05:00.534, Speaker A: Yeah. And he's obviously into crypto. Elon's been tweeting about and joking about dogecoin. Still other people reportedly, and by him and by them advising him on this as a partner at a 16 z. Not on crypto, just on Twitter. And then Jason Calacanis and David Sachs. So you got musk, a 16 z, Sachs, CZ, like, got some of the Paypal mafia there.
00:05:00.534 - 00:05:08.872, Speaker A: Now some crypto people. CZ, I think, offered, I don't know if he was asked. He said he would join the Twitter board if asked. Seems like he's asking.
00:05:08.958 - 00:05:14.732, Speaker B: That man has way too much power. His influence in the crypto industry and beyond is just like mind boggling.
00:05:14.788 - 00:05:15.892, Speaker A: Finance is humongous.
00:05:15.948 - 00:05:20.196, Speaker B: No doubt. Almost 70 or 80% of total spot market.
00:05:20.260 - 00:05:39.148, Speaker A: I think I saw 60, but regardless, something crazy. Yeah, dominant. So really interesting. And then there's this thing mask some way to integrate crypto trading stuff into your Twitter interface. I don't actually know a lot about it, so we're not going to talk about it today, but there's just been a lot of interesting Twitter stuff happening on that front.
00:05:39.236 - 00:05:44.612, Speaker B: The most important of which, though, is that dog money is up as a result of all this information.
00:05:44.748 - 00:06:10.344, Speaker A: Yeah. Check out our famous report, Dogecoin, the most honest shitcoin at Dogmoney Dot in fo. All right, we're going to go deep with Christine in a few minutes on zero knowledge proofs roll ups, EVM compatible roll ups. But before we do, let's go to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Digital trading. Bim. I saw Jay Powell. I almost said JPEG.
00:06:10.344 - 00:06:29.400, Speaker A: Jay Powell, that's our friend Saul Kadir. Jay Powell announced, and the Fed announced a 75 bit hike. But there was some new language I saw in the text that seemed to give credence to the idea that they would sort of tamper their hiking in the future. In the near future, maybe not in the long future.
00:06:29.472 - 00:07:08.004, Speaker C: Yes. So high level, this is a phrase that I use often I'm trying to correct, but high level, what the Fed was trying to do was communicate that they need to reduce the size of the hikes that they do on an ongoing basis. The rationale being that monetary policy typically works on a lag. And in addition, they've already tightened a lot. Right. So because they've tightened a lot and because monetary policy works on a lag, they think it's prudent to not keep going at a pace of 75. So they want to essentially go 50 in December and then thereafter go, go in increments of 25.
00:07:08.004 - 00:07:14.676, Speaker C: Now, the challenge that the Fed had today was communicating that in a way that wasn't taken as dovish.
00:07:14.780 - 00:07:15.772, Speaker A: Right, right.
00:07:15.908 - 00:07:46.660, Speaker C: Because if you look at the data, there is nothing to be constructive about from a inflation's coming down perspective. The last inflation print surprise to the upside. Labor market is still incredibly strong. We had ADP data this morning that showed us gaining 236,000 jobs for the month of October. Inflation for the month of October is expected to be 8.1 and core inflation is expected to be six. Six, which is again a trend high.
00:07:46.660 - 00:08:27.064, Speaker C: So there's nothing on the data side that's conclusive that allows you to be less hawkish. But there is stuff on the research front that suggests that maybe there's room for you to slow down, because in theory, like mortgage rates going up, it takes time for that to pass through into the real economy. But again, that's just the guess. Right now, there isn't really a good dataset to tell you that you jack rates to 5% six months from now. Inflation should cool by x amount. There's nothing conclusive there yet. So they're taking a guess as to how long it's going to take for tight financial conditions to make their way into real data.
00:08:27.064 - 00:09:13.438, Speaker C: But in my head, the most striking moment of the press conference was when Powell received a question that was prefaced with stocks having reacted well. The reporter had not seen that stocks were actually selling off. And Powell then went on to spew out basically three hawkish points in a row. And that really talked the market lower. And I completely agree with the market reaction, which was fixed income, selling off stocks, setting new lows, et cetera. In my head, we have made no progress towards beating inflation zero. The anecdotal stuff that I see, the hard data we see, there's been little to no progress made.
00:09:13.438 - 00:09:43.502, Speaker C: And so the idea that the Fed could, could be dovish and that rates could rally and that stocks could rally when you're not even anywhere close to making progress is just insane to me. We haven't lost a job yet. The job market's still gaining 200,000 plus jobs per month. There's been no progress made. Job openings actually went up this week. People were talking about, oh, okay, labor market's starting to crack a little bit. Job openings declined.
00:09:43.588 - 00:09:44.770, Speaker A: There's more hiring.
00:09:44.962 - 00:10:15.924, Speaker C: Yeah, there's more open jobs. There's more open jobs. And so you're nowhere close on the labor market. And inflation is still eight handles on headline, so the Fed has to keep going. And what that means is a stronger dollar means higher interest rates and it means lower risk asset prices. That's been the theme all year. And I think there's still room to play for those things in markets s and p literally just went from 3500 off the back of last CPI to 3900.
00:10:16.004 - 00:10:16.484, Speaker A: Right.
00:10:16.604 - 00:10:38.288, Speaker C: That's a huge move. It really shouldn't have happened, particularly in the context of big tech earnings that missed in a meaningful way, with the exception of one company. So high level. Again, sorry to use that phrase. Inflation is still a problem. It's not going away and the Fed has no choice but to react to the data they see.
00:10:38.336 - 00:10:50.456, Speaker A: Yeah. Is there other, I mean, is that not evidence that inflation's core cause is not monetary? I mean, wouldn't. So I'm a believer in the monetary.
00:10:50.480 - 00:11:06.582, Speaker C: The debate in inflation is, is it structural now or is it transitory? Right. And it becomes super structural when inflation expectations, or expectations for continuingly high inflation gets entrenched in the economy. Right.
00:11:06.638 - 00:11:09.894, Speaker A: When every person, every retailer raises prices.
00:11:10.054 - 00:11:34.456, Speaker C: Everyone asks for more. That is equivalent to. There was a labor union today that turned down a 19% increase over the course of two years in their salaries. 19%. That is more than like twice the current rate of inflation. They turned it down. All of the big consumer companies in the US that reported earnings basically said the US economy is fine.
00:11:34.456 - 00:11:39.792, Speaker C: We raised prices in the first half of this year and we think we're able to raise prices in the back half of this year as well.
00:11:39.848 - 00:11:40.184, Speaker A: Right.
00:11:40.264 - 00:11:41.952, Speaker C: Because the US consumer is that strong.
00:11:42.008 - 00:11:50.592, Speaker A: I guess what I'm saying is there nothing that say the administration can do on the fiscal side on trade negotiations?
00:11:50.688 - 00:11:51.884, Speaker C: Don't even get me started.
00:11:52.224 - 00:12:15.160, Speaker A: We know that inflation reared its head partly because of all the savings from COVID lockdowns and then the stimulus from governments worldwide and the persistent low rates and the asset bubble made people feel wealthy and all that stuff. And the supply chain disruptions. Right. And is the supply chain something that can be worked on? Is there, you know, we also have this war in Ukraine, so the supply.
00:12:15.192 - 00:12:17.104, Speaker C: Chains have normalized a lot already.
00:12:17.184 - 00:12:33.522, Speaker A: It just seems like we're asking the Fed to use the bluntest possible instrument to solve something that's much more intricate. And in particular, I mean, in the United States, just, it doesn't seem, I'm not seeing anything from the federal government to actually do anything to help with inflation.
00:12:33.578 - 00:12:35.898, Speaker C: And inflation's not being counterproductive.
00:12:35.946 - 00:12:36.082, Speaker A: Right.
00:12:36.098 - 00:12:38.730, Speaker C: And inflation, the inflation relief package.
00:12:38.802 - 00:12:52.210, Speaker A: Right. Which was a giant fiscal spend, I mean, California did one too. And it just seems like this is, they're fighting with. It's not a primary monetary policy issue. Yeah, it's not. They're not aligned. They're not aligned.
00:12:52.210 - 00:13:05.242, Speaker A: I get it. We've got the election coming up. It'd be tough politics, democratic administration, to go to austerity or something at this time. But I don't know. Do you think they might there'll be some movement on this after the midterm election, at least. I mean, it seems like one.
00:13:05.258 - 00:13:08.194, Speaker C: It's fighting against ever politically popular to spend less money.
00:13:08.274 - 00:13:08.970, Speaker A: Right?
00:13:09.162 - 00:13:25.292, Speaker C: Like, no politician has ever, like, it was actually a Mitch McConnell phrase when I think there was a conversation with, like, DJ T and him, and basically he said, like, you're not gonna lose reelection because you spent too much money.
00:13:25.348 - 00:13:25.708, Speaker A: Right.
00:13:25.796 - 00:13:27.756, Speaker C: That's never a reason why a politician.
00:13:27.780 - 00:13:47.092, Speaker A: Was one of those conundrums for republican politicians who advocate for fiscal prudence. Actually, Caesar, when he, Julius Caesar, when he ended the roman republic and crossed the Rubicon and turned Rome into an empire, immediately paid every roman citizen 100 denarii out of the treasury. Just, here's money.
00:13:47.188 - 00:14:23.178, Speaker C: Yes, helicopter money. Yeah, but back to your point. There's still money that was earmarked from past fiscal packages that hasn't been spent yet. It's a very long process from Bill passage to dollars out the door. And so you're still feeling the effects of fiscal stuff from years ago, let alone the stuff you're passing now. And so even if you got some fiscal control out of whatever Congress happens to get elected now, it's just not going to be enough. The cat's out of the bag.
00:14:23.178 - 00:14:45.426, Speaker C: Inflation expectations have really moved a lot higher, and you're not getting any help from the commodities either. Think about this. Typically, when oil prices rise, you typically see demand destruction. Because if I'm filling up at $4 a gallon, I'm going to drive less than if I'm filling up at $2.
00:14:45.450 - 00:14:47.826, Speaker A: A gallon or get a more efficient car, etcetera.
00:14:47.930 - 00:14:50.538, Speaker C: If my heating bill is $600, I'm.
00:14:50.546 - 00:14:51.498, Speaker A: Going to get some blankets.
00:14:51.586 - 00:15:03.418, Speaker C: You're going to get some blankets. But what's happening now is that particularly in Europe and in these wealthier economies, they are buffering that by giving handouts so that people don't feel the impact of the higher energy.
00:15:03.466 - 00:15:04.778, Speaker A: The demand destruction is not happening.
00:15:04.826 - 00:15:14.946, Speaker C: The demand destruction is not happening. So oil, energy prices are staying bit, and energy prices have a feedback loop into basically every other commodity and good service.
00:15:15.010 - 00:15:29.214, Speaker A: Right? I mean, oil itself is used for almost every single thing you're aware of as a material, let alone energy. So that kind of does leave the Fed as the only actual entity that can act here. Correct.
00:15:29.674 - 00:15:36.574, Speaker B: But also why the market might not be responding as hawkishly as the Fed wants the market to respond.
00:15:36.954 - 00:16:24.124, Speaker C: So my thing about the market response is that it will correct in due time. And the reason why is interest rates. Fundamentally, I believe interest rates are the most powerful mechanism in markets, trillions of dollars will move for a basis point or a couple extra basis points. Think about that in the context of where us equities are right now. They're implying very little to no earnings decline for next year at a reasonable multiple. Put that in the context of every other alternative. Once the Fed keeps hiking interest rates, the minimum interest rate that you can get for taking no duration or time risk is going to be 5% in a couple of months.
00:16:24.124 - 00:17:22.042, Speaker C: I can take no risk, no duration, and I can park money at 5%. As time progresses and you think about marginal investments, it's not going to make any sense to go into equities. Every day you go into equities, you're forgoing interest, and 5% is just the floor. There's other investments that are super not as like municipals or AAA Clos, stuff that is very risk free that yields you six, seven, 8%. And so then the question is, wait, I'm getting risk free money, low duration, versus taking all this equity risk out there and thinking about a company that's valued on cash flows for ten plus years. Why would I do that? Over time, you'll see this drain of liquidity from equities and they will correct lower. And so that's what I'm sort of keeping an eye out for.
00:17:22.042 - 00:17:57.674, Speaker C: In addition, eventually earnings forecasts will have to come down. The Fed needs to cause a pretty severe recession for inflation to come down. And if there's a severe recession, that means earnings need to come down. So when you combine those two things, I genuinely think that you're probably going to see significantly lower lows in the S and P over the course of the next three to six months. If I'm an asset allocator right now, looking at the s and P at 3800 and looking at risk free interest rates at 4% and climbing.
00:17:58.654 - 00:18:09.354, Speaker A: I'm not touching kind of a no brainer. Okay, and where does that put bitcoin, crypto, Ethereum, where does that put these things in the mix? Because, you know, something like bitcoin has no, has no interest, it has no yield.
00:18:09.434 - 00:18:30.950, Speaker C: I know it's concerning. However, I am very pleased with how well it's been trading. It's been sustaining above 19k even when equities were breaking to new lows, like you were like in the high eighteen s, and you barely sustained it there. In addition, you've already started to see a bunch of other central banks pivot.
00:18:31.142 - 00:18:31.518, Speaker A: Right?
00:18:31.566 - 00:19:11.674, Speaker C: Bank of Canada went 50 instead of 75. Royal bank of Australia is only doing clips of 25. We'll see what the bank of England decides to do tonight. But there are already signs that other economies, which are, I would say, more sensitive to higher interest rates, are already sort of pivoting and turning, and that's generally good for, for bitcoin. In addition, I would say that the extent of the move you've had already is you've had a significant amount of deleveraging happen in crypto. All of the weekends have been flushed out for the most part, or the vast majority of it. And so that leaves you with an absence of, for sellers, really.
00:19:11.674 - 00:19:22.954, Speaker C: I think if you're. It also does leave you with an absence of buyers in the context of why would you own, why bitcoin in this kind of environment? But at the same time, if no one's selling.
00:19:23.094 - 00:19:24.890, Speaker A: Right. And that's why prices do get set.
00:19:24.922 - 00:19:26.242, Speaker C: At the margin, and that is why.
00:19:26.258 - 00:19:51.626, Speaker A: We'Ve been range bound. And I do think, obviously, we've talked about why we think there's a strong case fundamentally for something like bitcoin in an environment where monetary policy is so erratic. But other cryptos, too. I mean, you look at something like Ethereum trades really well moved to proof of stake, you could argue it has a yield. I mean, I consider it like dilution protection, not an actual yield. But you can generate more yield than.
00:19:51.650 - 00:19:52.856, Speaker C: People have expected, though.
00:19:52.930 - 00:20:14.868, Speaker A: And it's frankly, significantly smaller than overnight money in the traditional markets. And that's true in Defi as well. Right? And that's, I think, partly while you've seen USDC supply come down significantly. That, plus maybe the binance thing. But because, remember, people were flocking to defi because the rates were high when traditional rates were low, and now it's flipped anecdotally.
00:20:14.916 - 00:20:23.380, Speaker C: I'll tell you, one of the most searched things on investopedia right now is how to open a treasury direct account.
00:20:23.452 - 00:20:24.692, Speaker A: Yeah, that's the I bonds, right?
00:20:24.788 - 00:20:37.940, Speaker C: I bonds, t bills, whatever it may be. Like people, everyday people are looking to park money in treasury bills. Nobody's like, what stock are you buying? Are you in this high flying elon?
00:20:38.012 - 00:20:41.172, Speaker A: So the Wall street bets crowd is like, opening, like, I bonds.
00:20:41.228 - 00:20:46.556, Speaker C: Yeah. And honestly, as a bond guy, smart man, it's exciting.
00:20:46.740 - 00:20:48.612, Speaker A: I'm like, oh, my God, bonds are back.
00:20:48.668 - 00:21:05.602, Speaker C: Bonds, interest rates. Like, yeah, it's crazy to me. Cause again, I said this last week when you asked me why did I join crypto? Cause I was literally sitting around being like, you guys are talking about negative interest rates, zero forever. It made no sense on that. Planet.
00:21:05.698 - 00:21:11.026, Speaker A: Modern monetary theory. Don't even, I mean, that stuff is so wrecked at this. Those ideas are so wrecked.
00:21:11.130 - 00:21:18.778, Speaker C: The interesting, I mean, there's so many interesting things we talk about, but like, one of these days, I'd love to dive into the B O J and how screwed they are.
00:21:18.826 - 00:21:32.818, Speaker A: We've got to do that. I don't think we have time to talk about japanese a yen policy right now. But, but it actually, that's a great story that. So let's, let's, we'll put that on the calendar. Don't, don't forget, listeners, we're going to, we're going to bring bim net back.
00:21:32.866 - 00:21:36.266, Speaker B: Hold us to account. Remind us if we forget, we won't.
00:21:36.290 - 00:21:41.482, Speaker A: Just bring them on for markets with bim. We'll do a segment on the BoJ with bim net. I think that would be awesome.
00:21:41.578 - 00:21:42.826, Speaker C: Looking forward to it.
00:21:42.970 - 00:22:02.194, Speaker A: All right. Bimnet abb Galaxy digital trading. Thank you so much, my friend. Christine, let's you and I talk about a big topic in blockchain scaling. This is the zero knowledge roll ups, but specifically zero knowledge evms. Ethereum virtual machine says they're called ZK evms.
00:22:02.894 - 00:22:04.054, Speaker B: My favorite topic.
00:22:04.134 - 00:22:34.410, Speaker A: Yeah, this is a big topic, and you're the expert here, so I'm mostly gonna be asking you questions. But just to set the stage. The scaling roadmap for Ethereum now is very focused on roll ups. And we have optimistic rollups like optimism and arbitrum, which use fraud proofs. And then we have, I guess, what people are calling ZK evms, but really they're called validity proof evms, I guess. Right. Which use validity proofs rather than fraud proofs.
00:22:34.410 - 00:22:45.352, Speaker A: And I'm gonna get into what that is. And most, I think people believe that the Zkevm is the roll up that will drive the scalability of Ethereum in the long term.
00:22:45.458 - 00:22:46.100, Speaker B: Yes.
00:22:46.252 - 00:22:51.396, Speaker A: What the heck is this thing? Yeah, the holy grail. What the heck are zkvms, Christine?
00:22:51.540 - 00:23:01.372, Speaker B: So I like to think of ZK evms and break it down into two different components, the ZK part and the EVM part.
00:23:01.428 - 00:23:01.852, Speaker A: Got it.
00:23:01.908 - 00:23:08.652, Speaker B: The EVM part of Ethereum is basically how Ethereum can be turned complete, how it can be a general purpose blockchain.
00:23:08.748 - 00:23:11.588, Speaker A: It's the virtual machine. It's the execution computer.
00:23:11.676 - 00:24:00.866, Speaker B: Right. And it's the computer. The first of its kind. It was launched in 2015. A bunch of developer tooling has been built on top of the EVM most decentralized applications, the ones that have the highest total value locked are EVM based. And we've seen a pretty big trend, even in alternative layer one blockchains that have come out, they try and be EVM compatible because they know that the EVM is the oldest and most sophisticated among virtual machines. So when it comes to how do we scale Ethereum, and how do we try and increase the user adoption of Ethereum, one of the bets is that, well, we need to make sure that this ecosystem of decentralized applications isn't broken.
00:24:00.866 - 00:24:06.250, Speaker B: We don't create an entirely new execution environment. We stick with the one that we've.
00:24:06.282 - 00:24:19.904, Speaker A: Already made because it has all this mind shared adoption. It has a moat. And there are others, as you said, some. All l one s, right? There's like wasm and seagate.
00:24:20.244 - 00:24:21.927, Speaker B: Forget Seagate, I've never heard of it.
00:24:21.927 - 00:24:26.116, Speaker A: There's a bunch of them. I don't know. We're gonna get someone else to talk about the other ones. We're not talking about those ones.
00:24:26.180 - 00:24:26.380, Speaker B: No.
00:24:26.412 - 00:24:49.636, Speaker A: EVM has a lot of dominance in the sort of virtual machine usage. But to scale, we need more block space, right? I mean, that's what this is a L2 question, right? We're talking about how do we, what L2s? And people have tried everything, right? There's been, there's been plasma and, and all types of payment, estate channels and all that stuff. But rollups now.
00:24:49.740 - 00:24:50.420, Speaker B: Yes, maybe.
00:24:50.452 - 00:24:51.652, Speaker A: What is a roll up?
00:24:51.788 - 00:25:26.202, Speaker B: So a roll up very basically is taking, is abstracting away the transaction execution part of what occurs on your base layer to an off chain L2. A roll up essentially batches user transactions on that L2 on an off chain platform. And then it confirms down a single proof of the batch transactions to the layer one. And that batch of transactions takes up less space than if you had executed all those transactions.
00:25:26.258 - 00:26:12.168, Speaker A: It's like a Merkle tree where the different pieces, transactions, et cetera, they all get rolled up into sort of one cryptographic proof that can be used to, to prove the validity of all the underlying transactions. And then you only commit that proof to the layer one blockchain. So you get like a one transaction to many transactions type of outcome, which, by the way, is how most L2 scaling in one way or another is what they're trying to achieve. Right? Less base layer footprint for more off chain executed stuff. So the roll ups though, now. So then let's bring this, we'll bring the, we're going to get to the ZK part in a second, but let's bring the EVM back into it. So the idea behind these then is, can we operate an EVM inside the roll up? Is that the idea?
00:26:12.256 - 00:27:50.384, Speaker B: Yes. And the idea also is, can we generate a proof of transactions that are executed through the EVM? So, can you prove something like the execution of Uniswap smart contracts with validity proofs? And it wasn't very long ago that optimism and arbitrum and the idea of fraud proofs, using fraud proofs to verify general purpose computation, really got going and was actually demonstrated on chain that it is possible to have like 99% compatibility with the EVM, the virtual machine of these other L2 networks called the OVM optimistic virtual machine, and then the AVM, Arbitrum's virtual machine. It hasn't been that long since they've really gotten up and running, and it's still a long ways to go to really like decentralize and fully realize the vision behind them. But already we're seeing parallel research and development going into what about verifying general purpose computations with validity proofs, right, and validity proofs, it's a lot harder. There's a number of reasons behind that, but mainly the EVM was never designed for zero knowledge proofs of mind. And so for a virtual machine like what Starknet has, that virtual machine, which is based on the Cairo smart contract programming language, that's very optimized for zero knowledge, and that's why it is so efficient. It has so much of the scaling, scaling benefits.
00:27:50.384 - 00:28:05.956, Speaker B: But I think a lot of the ZKE EVM projects that I looked into in this report, they're still very much struggling with how do we map over all of the opcodes and the precompiles that exist on the EVM and make them ZK compatible, right?
00:28:06.060 - 00:28:32.870, Speaker A: So you could do something like a simple transfer. I think that was easy, right? Theoretically in these rolled up, maybe with validity proof, certainly with fraud proofs. But the challenge you're saying was, can we make general arbitrary computation possible in the same cryptographic environment? Right. That's really what being EVM compatible here really means is like, can we do everything we can do in the EVM inside this validity proof?
00:28:32.942 - 00:29:16.636, Speaker B: Exactly. And so ZK sync is a team matter labs, the team behind the Zk sync project, when they first launched their ZK rollup, it was specific for payments, specific for types of smart contract execution, but not general purpose. But with Zksync 2.0, which is basically the Zkevm, that is language compatible with, language compatible with the Ethereum virtual machine, it's something that they've started to work on they actually announced last Friday their baby Alpha mainnet launch, which honestly, to me sounds like a testament launch.
00:29:16.700 - 00:29:23.268, Speaker A: It's kind of how you have, like, you used to have like seed and then series A stage deals, and then they were like pre seed, then they were like angel, then they were like.
00:29:23.316 - 00:29:25.060, Speaker B: Pre angel and you're like, now I don't even understand.
00:29:25.092 - 00:29:25.604, Speaker A: There's too many.
00:29:25.644 - 00:29:26.428, Speaker B: What any of these things are.
00:29:26.436 - 00:29:32.076, Speaker A: What's a baby alpha like? It's less than an alpha. It's less than a pre, like anyway. But okay, they launched something, right?
00:29:32.140 - 00:29:32.548, Speaker B: But it's.
00:29:32.596 - 00:29:33.484, Speaker A: They're making progress.
00:29:33.604 - 00:29:47.534, Speaker B: Yeah, but the progress is that a lot of the ZK roll ups that are live today in Mainnet is specific to a certain type of smart contract transaction, like nfts or defi payments or.
00:29:47.954 - 00:29:50.850, Speaker A: So they're not general purpose usable.
00:29:50.962 - 00:29:51.234, Speaker B: Right.
00:29:51.274 - 00:30:38.868, Speaker A: So they can't absorb the EVM developer mind share onto a roll up. L two. Yet the totality of it. No, because that, as you said, is the holy grail. Right? Can we create now talk about decentralization of these things also a little bit, because there are some trade offs at the moment, right, in terms of even if we get there soon, but maybe let's go to the ZK part of this. What is the zero knowledge part of this? Is there anything yet? And why are they called ZK evms? Because zero knowledge proves the concept just broadly for our audience, is that you could produce a cryptographic proof that you could prove that something was true, such as a yes no function, or in the case of what they want to get to, entire general computation contract execution.
00:30:38.916 - 00:30:40.744, Speaker B: Which is a huge leap, by the way.
00:30:42.484 - 00:30:54.884, Speaker A: I can prove, for example, that I'm over the age of 21 without telling you my birthday. And you can verify cryptographically that I told the truth about that without needing to know. That's maybe not a great example, but not a terrible one, but it only.
00:30:54.964 - 00:31:05.964, Speaker B: Verifies the correctness of whatever fact or truth that you're trying to prove. It doesn't reveal anything about the truth itself. It only. It's true.
00:31:06.004 - 00:31:20.598, Speaker A: Yes. No. If you put an input, you can get one out, and you can, you can rely, because of the magic of cryptography and mathematics, on the fact that the answer is accurate, that you receive back without needing the underlying data to check it yourself.
00:31:20.686 - 00:31:21.054, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:31:21.094 - 00:31:41.334, Speaker A: That's a very powerful concept for two primary reasons. One, privacy. Very clearly privacy and people have been built. I mean, as far back as zero cash later, zcash uses some of this technology. Um, that's powerful. And that's. I think a lot of people want that for a variety of things and reasons.
00:31:41.334 - 00:32:03.350, Speaker A: Um, but also, it's great for scaling, because you don't need to see all. What if the answer yes, true, true, yes or no? Um, requires a lot of information to get to that. Right. Well, you don't need the information. We just published the proof. You can verify it was true, and the other rest of the information doesn't have to be included. And that therefore saves a lot of space as well.
00:32:03.422 - 00:32:13.382, Speaker B: Yeah. And verifying that proof is trivial, and I think that's one of the best. Like, you had mentioned this, Alex, while editing my report, is that which we.
00:32:13.398 - 00:32:18.470, Speaker A: Haven'T mentioned yet, but Christine has a report coming out on this very soon, so look on probably next week.
00:32:18.622 - 00:32:49.302, Speaker B: But yes, that's true. But that's actually like a principle that's not only limited to zero knowledge, just generally in, like, our crypto industry, one of the technologies that is used over and over in some of the guiding design principles is even if your proof generation is computationally intensive, so long as the proof that is generated can be verified trivially by anyone in the world, that is enough to build, like, a really powerful, decentralized, permissionless technology.
00:32:49.438 - 00:33:19.786, Speaker A: I think an iconic example of that is just bitcoin mining. Right. And proof of work in general, computationally difficult to create. You prove that you've created it, but the proof itself, the block that is propagated, is trivial for nodes to verify. And I think the longest one, John Light. We're going to talk about John Light's research into bitcoin, ZK stuff, too. But I think the slowest block to ever be verified was like, we're talking like a second, or slightly under a second by a node, by a bitcoin core node.
00:33:19.786 - 00:33:31.862, Speaker A: So, very fast to create, but of course, as people know about the bitcoin mining industry, very heavy to. Sorry, very fast to validate, very heavy to create. And so, yeah, similar concept here with ZK.
00:33:31.958 - 00:34:24.278, Speaker B: And one of the things we mentioned in the report is that there is the potential. We're not going to say that this is definitely the route in which the outcome of the ZK proving industry. But one of the pitfalls is that it will become similar to the bitcoin mining industry, which relies on specialized hardware. Because the proof generation for ZK rollups is intensive, it's computationally intensive, and now there are methods to help make that process a lot more friendly for average, efficient and whatnot. Yeah, like recursive proving, which could allow a lot of proving to happen in parallel, but it's. I don't think that. I think that there definitely will be like a specialized hardware market for zero knowledge proofs.
00:34:24.326 - 00:35:07.274, Speaker A: That is interesting, because Ethereum's just moved to proof of stake. And I think there's a lot of people on both sides of this argument about whether that was good or bad. A lot of the Ethereum community is very in favor, and I frankly think that's all that really matters when it comes to a blockchain that's open and permissionless is what its users and node runners and developers want. That's the constituency. But ironic, perhaps, if the main scaling route that ends up coming out of this is also computationally intensive. And you see, essentially, I mean, we wouldn't call it a proof of work industry, but maybe a proof of proof industry, hardware industry. I mean, we're talking about, it's basically mining, it's computation.
00:35:07.274 - 00:35:17.822, Speaker A: But that's an aside that we're not close to that really just yet or anything. But it is something that's true about ZK proof creation, that it is computationally intensive.
00:35:17.918 - 00:35:53.528, Speaker B: Yeah. But it made me also think about the ways in which, in so many areas of Ethereum's development roadmap, a lot of the work is outsourcing Ethereum's advancements to other layers. So, like, with scaling and the focus on rollups, it's basically outsourcing the job of scaling to beyond the core protocol layer of Ethereum. Right. And then even the job of like, mev extraction, the focus of it is like outsourcing it so that it doesn't tarnish. Yeah. The base layer.
00:35:53.528 - 00:36:15.968, Speaker B: So the base layer stays, what? Green energy? Efficient. It stays decentralized, permissionless. But I kind of wonder, I guess, like the purity of the chain when everything, when scalability is outsourced, when like, mev extraction is outsourced, does it really matter that, like, the base layer is that. It's an interesting question, you know.
00:36:16.056 - 00:36:38.412, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, if you think about quote unquote Ethereum in total, what most people might think of it, um, are they going to know or are they going to care or even know that actually they were using a second layer thing that tied into the thing and like, and it turns out the totality of quote unquote activity on Ethereum, well, it did use a lot of energy, or it did. It wasn't as permission or whatever. Right.
00:36:38.428 - 00:36:39.484, Speaker B: Whatever it is. Right, exactly.
00:36:39.564 - 00:37:19.748, Speaker A: You know, I personally. That's a great question, and I personally am fine with this, because this is a in the long run, I mean, because this was always kind of the layer one blockchain scaling view from bitcoiners, which was don't tarnish the corn, you know, leave the base layer intact. And if there are cool things, originally it was if there were cool things that altcoins come up with, they'll be incorporated, if not at the base layer, then at some other layer. Right. And we'll get to that in 1 second. But I want to ask you about the teams that are working on ZK and what the sort of status is. This is what most of the world, as we said, the Ethereum world believes is the future of scaling Ethereum.
00:37:19.748 - 00:37:29.676, Speaker A: You could do these things, you could do rollups on rollups, you could do many identical roll ups. There's horizontal and vertical scaling that you can get theoretically out of rollups.
00:37:29.740 - 00:37:31.716, Speaker B: You could have layer threes on top of L2.
00:37:31.740 - 00:37:47.172, Speaker A: Yeah, you could have a roll up that rolls up into a roll up and then goes onto Ethereum. I mean, you actually can have that because we're really just moving proofs around. It's just moving around where the execution is happening and ultimately committing the transaction state back to Ethereum, which is highly decentralized. Right.
00:37:47.228 - 00:37:51.104, Speaker B: And you have total flexibility on even where data availability goes.
00:37:51.564 - 00:37:56.484, Speaker A: That's that modularity question too. Right? Because you could point it elsewhere. You could get the data from elsewhere.
00:37:56.564 - 00:37:57.204, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:57.364 - 00:38:03.316, Speaker A: So who's working on it? You mentioned Zksync and matterlabs. Who else is working on this?
00:38:03.380 - 00:38:33.104, Speaker B: Polygon is also working on this scroll, the privacy scaling exploration team, which is funded by the Ethereum foundation and then the Starkware company. Interestingly enough, as I had mentioned, their virtual machine is not natively trying to be EVM compatible, but they have a number of community driven initiatives to try and create transpilers between their Chiro two.
00:38:33.144 - 00:38:45.438, Speaker A: Solidity programming language, rather than make it turnkey compatible. It's like a transpiler, I'm assuming means take the solidity code and have it automatically rewritten into the Chiro code. Is that the idea?
00:38:45.606 - 00:39:29.416, Speaker B: Yes. And so there's a warp, one of the projects is called Warp, but it had run into some issues, I believe, trying to create that kind of compatibility between the solidity and Cairo programming languages. So now there's another community driven project called Kakarot that was very recently announced. So it does. I include Starkware as a team building a ZkeVM, even though that company isn't specifically building it. But I believe that their community is. And all of these initiatives, I think one of the things I want to highlight is very contrary to the base layer of Ethereum and how development works is not actually very open source on the L2 level.
00:39:29.480 - 00:40:05.678, Speaker A: Yeah, let's talk about that, because that was very interesting. When I was reading your, the draft of your report, it stood out. It sounds like scroll is the only major team that's building a ZKVM in an open source way today. I'm sure the other teams have given some commitments that at some point in the future they'll be open source. Of course I'm sure they say, but why is that? Why are they not, this isn't like bitcoin and ethereum. Core development is literally done in the open. Even the bad suggestions are made on GitHub and then reviewed and accepted or denied.
00:40:05.678 - 00:40:11.758, Speaker A: Right. Like the process is actually public, not just even the resulting code. Why is that?
00:40:11.846 - 00:41:16.464, Speaker B: I've talked to a number of these teams and the reason that they give me repeatedly is that, well, you know, we're very concerned that if we put this kind of code out in the wild, somebody will replicate it entirely and run it with a ton of bugs and exploits and users will be hurt in the process. So we don't, so we, so we won't basically, we don't want, we want to be good stewards of the technology that we put out in the world. And hence, until we know that we've fully verified it, audit it, it's ready for prime time, we're not going to release that code. But I personally think the bigger reason is about competition and also about ensuring that any of the mindshare, because most of these companies are vc backed, it's about building a product and not having that product basically be taken forked. Yeah. And basically having all of the revenue that you could have made off of your product be prematurely vampire attacked by another.
00:41:16.544 - 00:41:40.610, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And there's that huge race among these teams to be the first that gets there. That's why you get things like baby alpha releases, which is fine, I'm not hating on them for this at all. But I just mean like there's an announcement game at play. You saw it over the summer, right? Polygon had a big announcement splash around their thing. There's real competition here to be the first fully EVM compatible ZK rollup.
00:41:40.682 - 00:42:21.064, Speaker B: And there's a lot of misinformation too about what it actually means to be a ZK EVM. What does language compatible Zka Em versus like bytecode compatible ZK even EVM really mean? And even between like, not just ZK among ZK teens, but between, you know, the use of fraud proofs versus validity proofs. I think there's also a ton of misinformation around that. Not purely because of, I think there could be misinformation because of its complexity, of course, and the cryptography involved. But I think mainly because so many of these teams are motivated to tear down other teams and to try and make theirs look like the one and only true scaling solution for Ethereum.
00:42:21.564 - 00:42:58.796, Speaker A: Fascinating. When do you think? I don't think anyone knows the answer to this, but I'm going to ask you anyway, Christine, when are we going to get, when is the ZK revolution coming in full? I don't know. To your point, does that mean a bunch of language level? And in Christine's report, you can see she lays this out very clearly for you when we talk about these different levels of compatibility and stuff, which you'll read, but I don't know what the threshold is for the question I'm even asking, but when are ZK rollups with EVM compatibility going to be in production as that scaling holy grail?
00:42:58.940 - 00:44:03.716, Speaker B: I think it'll take two to three years at minimum to see these evms at scale. And I think that in that process, it's not a foregone conclusion that the ZKE EVM projects we're talking about today, the five that I mentioned, will be the ones to really reach production level capacity in those couple years. I think in the report I talk about how optimistic rollups could even foreseeably first become hybrid rollups. They could have fraud proofs and validity proofs happening in parallel. And then once validity proofs become far more efficient and the proof generation complexity around making them even compatible, et cetera, et cetera, get figured out slowly start to migrate more to validity proofs. So I think that kind of process could play out over the next couple of years. But to be fair, this timeline is far, far expedited than what people had even originally thought a year ago about where we were going to be with fraud proofs, where we were going to be with optimistic rollups.
00:44:03.716 - 00:44:34.854, Speaker B: So this two to three year timeline, even though it might sound long to listeners now, I would just emphasize is, is far more expedited than, I think even the 510 year estimation that we were originally working off of when first talking about zero knowledge. And this is probably a good segue to mention the work around zero knowledge for bitcoin because Satoshi more than ten years ago was talking about how ZK zero knowledge technology could be used for bitcoin.
00:44:41.534 - 00:45:15.698, Speaker A: Quick break for our listeners before we dive into zero knowledge roll ups on bitcoin with Christine. Want to share the results of our poll? Last week we asked what will be opensea share of ethereum based NFT trading volume in one year. Today it's 80%. The winner was 40% to 60% with 30% of respondents. 20% of people of respondents said it would be 80% or higher. So more dominance than today, but 54% said 60% or less. New poll this week.
00:45:15.698 - 00:45:42.504, Speaker A: However, about zkvms, which we've been talking about, pretty straightforward one. Interpret the question however you like. Who do you think will win the ZkevM race? Polygon ZkvM ZK Sync 2.0 scroll ZK EVM or some other project. Hit us up on Twitter at Gl Xy Research. Make your voice heard. Now let's get back to the show with Christine.
00:45:42.504 - 00:46:29.196, Speaker A: So the question arises, could we get ZK rollups on bitcoin? Could we get zero knowledge, anything on bitcoin? To be clear, and I think very unlikely to have any kind of privacy tech on base layer bitcoin because privacy stuff is hard for supply auditability in particular. So that 21 million, we actually know this, there was an inflation bug on zcash that they patched before ever. I think they announced almost a year, if I recall, this is years ago, almost a year after it had apparently happened and they patched it said that it had happened, but there's no way to know whether that inflation occurred. Actually.
00:46:29.300 - 00:46:30.356, Speaker B: That's very concerning.
00:46:30.420 - 00:47:02.704, Speaker A: Yeah. Because of their shielded transactions. So there are reasons why you don't want zero knowledge on the base layer. I think that's true for ethereum to be clear as well, on the base layer, that may not be everywhere. That might not mean that the mempool might not have zero knowledge. Anyway, stepping back, that's a bigger question. But the question is, can we have L2s on bitcoin? We primarily have side chains and state channels with side chains like liquid or like rootstock or something.
00:47:02.704 - 00:47:39.234, Speaker A: And then lightning Network is this iconic bitcoin layer too. But the things that you can do inside a truly peer, locally held state, like lightning, right. A peer to peer network, are pretty limited in the scheme of things. And there's been some tricks that people are coming up with. Taro from lightning Labs, which uses tap tweak to encode additional data into these things. But let's be real here. Lightning Network is a giant dispersed network of bilateral connections between random parties.
00:47:39.234 - 00:49:20.406, Speaker A: As that network overlaps with itself a lot, then you do emerge with something you could call a network, where you can actually route payments farther than just from me to Christine. But there's no shared state, so composability is extremely limited by definition, heavily limiting the things you can do there. And the idea is, well, gosh, the zero knowledge community, mostly driven by Ethereum now, has made so much progress on this incredible technology. Could we integrate it into bitcoin somehow? And a lot of folks want to know the answer to that. And our friend Alex Gladstein, who we had on the podcast in August, who's the chief of strategy, chief strategy officer at the Human Rights foundation, they give grants to bitcoin developers and other developers to look into questions like this, and they gave one to a great researcher named John Light, and he wrote an excellent paper which just came out a couple of weeks, maybe a week ago, looking at this question, first of all, what are these things? And second of all, should we, are they good or bad? And then should we incorporate them into bitcoin? What types of benefits would they bring and what trade offs are at play, and then what would we have to do? And it seems, and he worked on this for six months and is much smarter about it than I am, certainly. And so I'm going to paraphrase his findings rather than necessarily cosign them as my own, although I've reviewed it quite heavily. So we need some changes at the base layer.
00:49:20.406 - 00:49:58.662, Speaker A: They're not dramatic. I think you need something on bitcoin called recursive covenants. So covenants are when you attach basically payment conditions onto bitcoin payments in the future. So for example, I tell you, Christine, here's some bitcoin, but the bitcoin you receive has these conditions on it and says you can only do certain things after a certain amount of time or whatever. BIP 119 and I think 118 also they're much more pared down versions, covenants, light. That's what had been proposed by Jeremy Rubin. And, and those are really powerful ideas.
00:49:58.662 - 00:50:41.450, Speaker A: Separately, it allows you to do weird, awesome, complex custody things, the self custody level. But you need a way for the UtxO to know that it needs to stay inside this roll up for a period of time. And then you need a method for the bitcoin holder on the base layer to remove the UtxO from the roll up at some time if they want to exit the roll up. Right. And that one UtxO, that's where you need the covenants to be working because the UtxO has to be spent into the roll up, but basically be able to be unspent out of it later. So that's a change. And I don't know, I don't think any real deep, deep work has been done on researching whether that change can be what's fully required to make that change on bitcoin.
00:50:41.450 - 00:50:54.824, Speaker A: And can it be done in a backwards compatible fork versus a non backwards? So can it be done in a soft fork versus a hard fork? Which is loads of research go into questions like that. I mean, people didn't think segwit could be a soft fork and they figured it out.
00:50:54.904 - 00:51:00.524, Speaker B: That's true. But could recursive covenants be the first hard reason for a hard fork on bitcoin?
00:51:01.264 - 00:51:17.404, Speaker A: I mean, by the way, just before I answer that question, there could perhaps be other needs, a couple other op codes on bitcoin to make this work. Okay, yeah, I don't know, but I am very bullish on this concept of ZK rollups. I love the.
00:51:17.444 - 00:51:18.324, Speaker B: For scalability.
00:51:18.444 - 00:51:29.988, Speaker A: For scalability. And we didn't talk about this with Ethereum, but there is no ZK. That's why you're saying validity roll ups, validity proof roll ups. None of the current ones on Ethereum yet actually have the privacy part of this, right?
00:51:30.076 - 00:51:31.204, Speaker B: No, none of them.
00:51:31.284 - 00:51:34.236, Speaker A: So that's yet further down the road to be figured out.
00:51:34.300 - 00:52:04.486, Speaker B: Yeah. And in fairness, I mean, privacy, I think even on Ethereum, base layer right now, is mainly enabled by applications like cryptocurrency transaction mixers on top of it. But I'm sure that there's also other ZK rollups like Aztec right now that's a Zk of a ZK rollup. And then you can get privacy. But I guess on the question of then, if bitcoiners are looking at ZK rollups for scalability, to be honest, I.
00:52:04.550 - 00:52:25.824, Speaker A: Also want it for more features. I want to be able to do stuff, quote unquote on chain. And you know, I happen to think that bitcoin has better long term settlement assurances than Ethereum. So why can't I roll it up onto Ethereum? I mean, onto bitcoin, right? I mean that, that's. I think a lot of people have that question. We know this is great scaling. We know that.
00:52:25.824 - 00:52:44.076, Speaker A: Now what features go into it can be everything obviously at the roll up level can be determined, right. And, but also at whatever bitcoin were to add at the base layer could also inhibit or allow various features. Right. Like we could make because it's not an, there's no virtual machine, right?
00:52:44.180 - 00:52:44.700, Speaker B: Yes.
00:52:44.812 - 00:52:57.304, Speaker A: So we have to figure out like. And frankly, they could be much more limited. Frankly, they may not be able to be significantly more. It's not a question of like virtual machine compatibility, because there is no bitcoin.
00:52:58.004 - 00:53:12.738, Speaker B: Virtual machine, basically, but the concerns around adding ZK to bitcoin. In the paper he mentioned so many of the same negative externalities is what ethereum faces, which is Mev, I forget what the other one, it was like AIC.
00:53:12.866 - 00:53:39.826, Speaker A: Yeah, aim attacks. And I mean, there's a variety of them. There's some specific attacks he identifies that could cause things. There's also like, you could do a DDoS attack pretty well by flooding the roll up with a bunch of junk that makes it prohibitively take too much time for nodes to then validate the block that contains the validity proof from.
00:53:39.850 - 00:54:37.944, Speaker B: That it opens up a whole can. Of course, there's a lot, I mean, I think that ethereum, Ethereum, in trying to be a general purpose computer, world computer, it has to open up these cans of worms for trying to achieve scalability. Trying to achieve general purpose computations, have a virtual machine. But my question is, does bitcoin need scalability? And in my opinion, I think bitcoin does. I think bitcoin, in its current form, if it realizes its vision as the world settlement layer, it's going to break under the pressure of just everybody, every state trying world state, like government trying to use it. And if bitcoin needs scalability, I think it's so concerning to me that there's no clear path right now of like, how bitcoin is going to scale. And I think it'll try and have to answer a lot of the same questions and a lot of the same struggles that Ethereum is currently facing now.
00:54:38.524 - 00:54:46.220, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think lightning is pretty good for what it is, but I think that thing is relatively limited in the scheme of things.
00:54:46.292 - 00:54:48.356, Speaker B: Like does lightning in a decentralized way.
00:54:48.420 - 00:55:00.604, Speaker A: I mean, it scales better if all the major nodes are run by businesses than if they're all run by people. And that doesn't really get me where I want to go when it comes to decentralization long term.
00:55:00.684 - 00:55:01.304, Speaker B: Right.
00:55:01.684 - 00:55:31.144, Speaker A: But it is good. I mean, I should be able, I love the idea that at any time you can open up a channel with someone else and we can just pass payments super fast. I mean, it's not that there's not big benefit to what lightning has done. And frankly, like bitcoin, like state channel development has gone significantly farther than anyone else because the Ethereum community abandoned it looking for this, basically. So they already looked at this and moved past it because there is no shared state. You can't really build a virtual machine there. Right.
00:55:31.144 - 00:55:32.124, Speaker A: That's why.
00:55:32.424 - 00:55:34.408, Speaker B: And it's not great decentralization wise, it's.
00:55:34.416 - 00:56:07.952, Speaker A: Not great, but it's sort of like whatever you want it to be, and that is great. It can be very decentralized if you think of it as the lightning network with like Capital L, Capital N, it's not super decentralized and it's, in my view, not likely to be super decentralized. But again, it's a thing that anyone can just spin up at any time with any sub network or directly. So it's not really fair. Also, I don't think to really criticize it for that, but it doesn't get me where I want to go for decentralized scalability long term. I don't think. At a huge scale.
00:56:07.952 - 00:56:09.804, Speaker A: At a huge scale. Right.
00:56:10.304 - 00:56:12.864, Speaker B: But do you think bitcoin needs that in its future?
00:56:12.984 - 00:56:47.402, Speaker A: I'd certainly like to explore it. I mean, because like I said, that's the other interesting thing. Like if we were doing stuff in these other environments, like, and Ethereum becomes kind of like honestly ancillary, to say a lot of people's usage of quote unquote Ethereum because they're really doing it inside of ZKR, and it's just really a matter of like where the state is committed to. Right. Well then I, like I said, I would like that state a lot of times to be committed to bitcoin. And so I, and I think others would also, if you could do, I mean, this could allow you to do more with bitcoin. Right.
00:56:47.402 - 00:57:18.080, Speaker A: And I think that that is a really interesting concept. I mean, there's a lot of other people who also think this. And I just, the issue, I think primarily, I mean, it does require some change. To do this on bitcoin requires some changes, and we haven't done the work on that. I don't think any bitcoin developers have done a lot of work to actually, like scope out what a bip would look like to implement this. Really. That's what I mean, there's some good conceptual thinking out there, but like this paper.
00:57:18.080 - 00:57:21.656, Speaker A: Yeah, like this paper. And there's a couple others that have looked into it.
00:57:21.680 - 00:57:23.096, Speaker B: But, but can you imagine?
00:57:23.160 - 00:57:23.832, Speaker A: That would be a lot.
00:57:23.888 - 00:57:56.488, Speaker B: Can you imagine, Alex, if the modularity vision of all these, of all this thinkery that is happening? Can you imagine if at the, basically in a couple of years time, the modular vision is completely realized. And actually bitcoin and ethereum start to compete as settlement layers because for like the longest time, it's always been ethereum and bitcoin aren't competing. They have different use cases. But if this modular vision is completely realize, then I actually do think that ethereum and bitcoins their primary use cases as a settlement.
00:57:56.656 - 00:58:40.112, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think so too. I think that, which is funny because that's that again, like this kind of goes back to the whole layered scaling debate which bitcoiners promoted, which is that you do all the weird stuff you want to do somewhere else and you just commit back. And to be clear, you can do that today. You can do, I mean, this is what, like the omni network kind of did this, right? Like you can commit data to bitcoin, but like the question is, can we commit a cryptographic proof that gets verified, uh, by the bitcoin network also and thus keeps it like decentralized and, and, you know, lowercase tethered to bitcoin. Right. Um, that is what validity proofs are trying to accomplish. Um, and, and I don't think that you can do yet on bitcoin.
00:58:40.168 - 00:58:42.464, Speaker B: And so, and not really fully on Ethereum.
00:58:42.584 - 00:59:07.044, Speaker A: Right. And we're not there yet even for, but it would be funny, to your point, if we come full circle on this, because the Ethereum community, like went down the same layered scaling vision that bitcoiners had proposed and have maybe found this holy grail, although we're still really early days, it seems like. But then let's say they do. And then it's like, well, hmm, I got this holy grail, but maybe I should. Somebody's like, well, should we bring that back to bitcoin? It's kind of funny.
00:59:07.084 - 00:59:08.548, Speaker B: Should we make this full circle again?
00:59:08.636 - 00:59:37.764, Speaker A: Exactly. I mean, it's very interesting. I mean, I don't think it's a near term need for bitcoin, but it, I do think it should be a big, there really isn't a long term bitcoin roadmap for software development. And, you know, some argue that's a feature, not a flaw. I'm not certain it is a feature. And if there is one, I feel like this should be on it to figure out at least step one, figure out if it should be on it, but have those conversations. I hope John Light's paper really gets those going.
00:59:37.764 - 00:59:53.608, Speaker A: It's very good. We'll try to link to it in the show notes. All right, that's all we've got. It was a great conversation.
