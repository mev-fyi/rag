00:00:08.480 - 00:00:13.001, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:13.073 - 00:00:14.169, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:14.337 - 00:00:42.435, Speaker A: Wow, exciting time. I don't know if we have the wide shot. People can see the block clock here. We hit 73, 6:35 on Tuesday. My count of the intraday all time high from March 2024 was 73,835. So we were just about a little bit less than $200 off of the all time high for bitcoin this week, a week before the election. I don't know, what's your take on that?
00:00:42.735 - 00:01:11.107, Speaker B: Yeah, I think bitcoin at this point is the $1.4 trillion gorilla in the room you can't ignore. Right. It is absolutely massive. It is accelerating higher. It's one of those things that, like, if you're an institutional investor, you're looking at it being like, okay, what are the arguments for why bitcoin can go higher? There's the whole monetary debasement thing. Right.
00:01:11.107 - 00:01:41.733, Speaker B: Which we can get into. But you look at trades that benefit from that and you immediately think about gold, which has gone on a spectacular run this year on a risk adjusted basis, one of the best trades you could have done. It's super liquid, it's up, call it 30 to 40% on the year, making fresh all time highs every other day. So that part of the argument is going great. And then you think about it from the regulatory and the adoption side of things. Well, the ETF's incredibly popular.
00:01:41.829 - 00:01:42.381, Speaker A: Incredibly.
00:01:42.453 - 00:02:14.141, Speaker B: Right. The futures product are incredibly popular. The regulatory landscape is probably only going to improve regardless of what candidate is happening. And then you look at kind of the other broader kind of macro risk things, you know, S and P at all time highs, essentially same thing with nasdaq, a Fed that's easing, et cetera. And so, you know, it's really, really hard for folks to ignore this. This thing is traded almost in every country in the world. Yeah, right.
00:02:14.141 - 00:02:15.853, Speaker B: There are local exchanges, there's a bunch.
00:02:15.869 - 00:02:17.933, Speaker A: Of countries mining it, mining it.
00:02:18.069 - 00:02:58.345, Speaker B: I mean, it is unstoppable. It's just a matter of when, not if. You break through all time highs. And then the question is, what type of FOMO do folks get once it breaks? I will tell you, I'm one of those folks that looked at the gold chart, looked at the silver chart and saw it break, have this clean technical break. And if you chose not to follow, particularly on the, on the gold example, you missed out on a ton of gains. Yeah, right. And so, you know, when bitcoin breaks this 74k level, I do think it's going to accelerate and it's going to force people to pay attention.
00:02:58.345 - 00:03:08.897, Speaker B: And it's really. I mean, just think about it. There's. The ETFs are insanely. Bitcoin is trading like $40 billion a day. It's super liquid. There's a whole ecosystem around it.
00:03:08.897 - 00:03:12.217, Speaker B: Right. You can buy it on futures and.
00:03:12.401 - 00:03:16.717, Speaker A: Do margin finance buying fintech, apps and retail exchanges. You can buy it at fidelity.com?
00:03:16.771 - 00:03:55.615, Speaker B: Absolutely. And the other thing I think people are really discounting, which has, I think gone through a transformational change over the past six months or so, is kind of the financing behind crypto. Right. Since the ETFs have launched, Bitcoin has traded more like a general collateral asset, basically an asset you can fund at very low costs. And so folks have been able to get, like, real liquidity from their Bitcoin without actually selling it. Right. And so when you get liquidity into a market and you're able to finance it, that reduces sell pressure and that actually makes people want to own it more because they're like, oh, I can buy it on margin.
00:03:55.615 - 00:04:16.705, Speaker B: Yeah, right. And it becomes almost like a cash equivalent, but you don't actually have to spend the bitcoin to spend cash. And so there's so many positive things happening for it. And you're looking at it being like it just got to, you know, 1.4, $1.5 trillion. And, you know, the naysayers will be like, it's got no use case, blah, blah, blah.
00:04:16.705 - 00:04:47.887, Speaker B: But all it's done is just defy all the critics constantly. And now there's just so much momentum behind it that, you know, I think, like, it's really hard for a macro investor or an asset allocator to ignore this. Right? Yeah, gold's at 19 trillion, but it's got a bunch of central banks, you know, printing money and buying it, and also has thousands of years of being money. And yet bitcoin's kind of catching up in a way. Although on a relative basis.
00:04:47.951 - 00:05:12.765, Speaker A: One thing that I think about with gold too, is just another sort of like, you're sort of talking through some of the positives and negatives. Just, you know, it's held in a centralized manner. Gold is not decentralized. Sure, yeah, I've got a little bit of gold on my finger. There's plenty of, like, gold out there, but the vast majority of it is, like, underneath the New York Fed or like, in a Couple depositories is not capable of being taken delivery of at scale. Right.
00:05:12.805 - 00:05:16.293, Speaker B: So it's not centralized fractions of it as well.
00:05:16.389 - 00:05:17.669, Speaker A: And a couple of coins here and.
00:05:17.677 - 00:05:25.487, Speaker B: There are examples of like governments confiscating gold over time, forcing you redeem it, you know, levels that aren't fair.
00:05:25.591 - 00:05:26.727, Speaker A: Right, right, right, right.
00:05:26.871 - 00:05:29.983, Speaker B: So yeah, I mean, but like that's. You don't have to preach to me.
00:05:29.999 - 00:06:07.745, Speaker A: About the one thing that always strikes me though because like the argument for owning gold is usually quite similar to what the bitcoiners say about owning bitcoin. Protection against inflation or debasement or from seizure. I mean, yeah, if you have American equal coins in your house, sure they're probably not going to be able to seize those very easily. But the vast majority of people who buy into that trade like gold through a brokerage and don't actually have the gold, to me that's extremely contradictory. And to own a government collapse hedge but not actually store it yourself. And the thing is, you really can't store it yourself in size gold. It's physically too large and heavy.
00:06:07.745 - 00:06:40.379, Speaker A: Super interesting. I want to ask you too about corporate adoption. There's the headlines about Microsoft. Yes, I guess now, I guess an activist, small activist investor did whatever is required to get a question added for shareholders to some upcoming Microsoft board meeting about whether Microsoft should put Bitcoin on the balance sheet. And Microsoft wrote back recommending that they. Well, they're recommending that shareholders vote against it, the board. But also they wrote back saying like, look, we look at everything, including crypto for our balance sheet allocation.
00:06:40.379 - 00:07:03.267, Speaker A: But do you recommend regardless of. I don't want to speculate given that that's a single name stock. But like do we see this happening more whether from activists or otherwise? Like, I mean, because like you said, it's really quite difficult to ignore. We're not saying like, hey, you should put on, you know, doggy poggy coin. Like this is, you know, the state of Wisconsin Investment board bought it. We just saw report that Emory University has bought the Bitcoin ETFs. Like this is a.
00:07:03.267 - 00:07:05.011, Speaker A: Not a niche asset.
00:07:05.123 - 00:07:05.459, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:05.507 - 00:07:10.907, Speaker A: Do you think, you think you're gonna see more corporates like have to either be forced to by their shareholders or decide to.
00:07:11.091 - 00:07:36.515, Speaker B: I mean it's, it's a tough one. Like I don't fully, you know, know the nuances behind getting, you know, one of the world's largest companies to hold it on their balance sheet. But I do know that blackrock is a large holder of a ton of equity yeah. Of everything in the U.S. yeah. You know, State Street, Fidelity.
00:07:36.595 - 00:07:39.963, Speaker A: Yeah. There are a lot of big shareholders that own Microsoft that like Bitcoin.
00:07:40.019 - 00:07:47.653, Speaker B: Yeah. Besides like Vanguard and Schwab like most of these companies are pretty friendly to crypto.
00:07:47.709 - 00:08:11.615, Speaker A: But is the case if you're like managing a corporate balance sheet with a bunch of assets on it like cash and whatever else. Like most of them are. Right. Because that's where they get the money to buy back their stocks. I mean there's so much cash and all these big companies balance sheets is the case. Not the same the case to own Bitcoin as it would be for theoretically an individual or for an endowment. It's the risk return profile.
00:08:12.395 - 00:08:14.283, Speaker B: It's volatile. I mean think about like.
00:08:14.339 - 00:08:16.355, Speaker A: But I mean couldn't don't you just do a small purchase?
00:08:16.475 - 00:08:18.363, Speaker B: You can. I mean I don't see why you shouldn't.
00:08:18.459 - 00:08:25.243, Speaker A: Right. I mean like theoretically the case, the math on like on Sharpe how to improve the portfolio. It's the same, right?
00:08:25.299 - 00:09:00.243, Speaker B: Same. No, I mean put simply allocating a small percentage of your portfolio into Bitcoin has proven to enhance your returns from a outright actual absolute return perspective and also from a reducing volatility perspective. And so every portfolio that has added Bitcoin to a small degree has benefited in an improved sharp on that portfolio, historically speaking. And that argument with bitcoin at all time highs essentially holds truer than ever.
00:09:00.299 - 00:09:33.679, Speaker A: Yeah. It's funny like when people there's institutional surveys all the time. I know Fidelity has done this survey many times of what is the reason why if you're not doing investing in bitcoin, what's the reason why? And always volatility is the number one answer. And it's funny because I look at that and I think what people really mean is they don't like the downward volatility. Yeah, right. Because like the reality is like, I mean bitcoin has, yeah, it's had many 50% drawdowns and a few like 80 plus percent drawdowns. But it's also just been up forever over a long enough timeframe.
00:09:33.679 - 00:10:13.471, Speaker A: So it's kind of like well, they want the volatility to the upside, they just don't want the downside volatility. But like you know, it's sort of if you don't like me on my bad days, you don't deserve me on my good days. Because this is an asset that like continuously comes back. You've got like the world's biggest economists always talking smack about it and then just always made to look a fool over and over again, you kind of just have to hold through that. I mean, think about, like, even Michael Saylor, right? Like, remember when we were talking a couple years ago about, like, people were worried, like, oh, man, like, what's his, like, liquidation level? Well, I can tell you with certainty it's nowhere near this price. Like, he ended up being super right about the price of bitcoin. So it just seems like, you know, how many times are they going to.
00:10:13.471 - 00:10:20.215, Speaker A: Are corporate boards going to say no? And how many times are they going to be made a fool of 2, 3 years in the future? Like, at some point.
00:10:20.255 - 00:10:43.663, Speaker B: No, at some point you got to learn. Yeah, no, absolutely. I just think it happens over time. You know, the younger generations, you know, as they elevate themselves across, you know, various companies and stuff. I can't tell you how many different, like, conferences or, you know, happy hours, et cetera, where it's like, oh, like, yeah, we're really into bitcoin. The younger, more junior staff versus, like the senior pm that's like a little bit more conservative.
00:10:43.759 - 00:10:44.135, Speaker A: Makes sense.
00:10:44.175 - 00:10:51.457, Speaker B: And so I think just as adoption happens and as time passes, you know, you'll see folks get more comfortable.
00:10:51.521 - 00:11:15.369, Speaker A: Yeah, Well, I guess we just keep watching. Luckily, we. I just feel like a broken record, you know, sometimes it's like, no, it's like, I don't want to apologize for having to constantly tell people that bitcoin, even if you look at the Google trend numbers, like, it's not back, like the Google searches people aren't searching, that comes in after a clean, all time high break. You think we start to get some gappage?
00:11:15.457 - 00:11:42.477, Speaker B: No, I mean, I think there's a lot of folks that have been thinking about allocating this year that haven't allocated. And it's all of those people in the middle and even the folks that are allocated, they're like, I don't own enough. Right. And you just kind of think about all the positive headwinds. It's like, take the example that Trump wins. Howard Lutnick, who is spearheading the transition team.
00:11:42.501 - 00:11:42.685, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:42.725 - 00:11:49.217, Speaker B: The transition team was on a podcast the other day saying that he owns hundreds of millions of dollars of bitcoin.
00:11:49.301 - 00:11:49.617, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:49.681 - 00:11:51.313, Speaker B: And that he expects it to be billions.
00:11:51.369 - 00:11:52.209, Speaker A: Yeah, right.
00:11:52.297 - 00:11:55.033, Speaker B: That's the guy leading the transition team.
00:11:55.209 - 00:12:08.805, Speaker A: The odds on favorite, I mean, top other people too. Vivek is huge, loves Bitcoin. RFK Jr. Loves Bitcoin. Don Jr. The former president's son, loves JD Vance. JD Vance owns Bitcoin.
00:12:09.505 - 00:12:13.817, Speaker B: It's really hard for me to be like, the regulatory environment's not going to be good.
00:12:13.881 - 00:12:14.409, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:12:14.537 - 00:12:23.163, Speaker B: Right. At the very least. And you have things like the options that are going to launch on Bitcoin.
00:12:23.179 - 00:12:32.611, Speaker A: At some point for the ETFs. Yeah. Doesn't that dramatically enhance liquidity? Right. It gives people ways to bet in so many different ways.
00:12:32.683 - 00:12:41.339, Speaker B: Gives way folks a way to hedge, earn, yield on their stuff. Yeah. I mean, it definitely enhances liquidity.
00:12:41.467 - 00:12:59.825, Speaker A: Last episode before the election, which is next week. Good Lord. I'm happy. It's. We're gonna, you know, no matter what happens, like, I'm just gonna be so happy when election season is over. It's so long in this country. You know, there are countries where they cap, like campaigning if, like for only like 45 days or something.
00:12:59.825 - 00:13:00.041, Speaker A: Like.
00:13:00.073 - 00:13:00.377, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:00.441 - 00:13:03.633, Speaker A: Because it's just like, dude. I mean, like, it's way too long.
00:13:03.729 - 00:13:06.369, Speaker B: It is way too long and way too polarized.
00:13:06.417 - 00:13:06.697, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:13:06.721 - 00:13:11.581, Speaker B: I feel like, you know, people just need to sit down and I know. You know, have a meal with each other.
00:13:11.653 - 00:13:12.037, Speaker A: I agree.
00:13:12.101 - 00:13:28.341, Speaker B: And not be so left or right. But yeah. In terms of the election and how to trade it, the one thing I know for sure is that the market is constantly surprised by election outcomes and even more surprised by price action.
00:13:28.453 - 00:13:29.149, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:29.317 - 00:13:41.911, Speaker B: Subsequently. And you know, the best example that I've heard, and I may have said it on the last podcast, but if you knew the results in 2016. Right. A day in advance, you probably would have traded it really poorly.
00:13:42.023 - 00:13:43.447, Speaker A: Yeah. It's weird. Right.
00:13:43.631 - 00:13:44.351, Speaker B: And so.
00:13:44.423 - 00:13:47.711, Speaker A: So what, like the Trump outcome trades didn't actually pan out?
00:13:47.863 - 00:13:51.167, Speaker B: Well, the Trump outcome trades were expected to be stocks down.
00:13:51.271 - 00:13:51.679, Speaker A: Right.
00:13:51.767 - 00:13:57.335, Speaker B: Right. And stocks ripped. They went from limit down to, you know, flying higher.
00:13:57.415 - 00:13:58.103, Speaker A: Wow.
00:13:58.279 - 00:14:08.463, Speaker B: And so it's, it's, it's really, you know, I think it's one of those things where you're probably meant to be a fast follow rather than a.
00:14:08.599 - 00:14:09.535, Speaker A: On whichever it is.
00:14:09.575 - 00:14:09.895, Speaker B: Yes.
00:14:09.975 - 00:14:11.555, Speaker A: Wait and see where the trend is.
00:14:11.855 - 00:14:13.375, Speaker B: Once you kind of get an inkling.
00:14:13.455 - 00:14:13.831, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:13.903 - 00:14:23.423, Speaker B: Then you kind of go with the trend. But it should be exciting. I'm hoping for a very clear election outcome. That is the thing.
00:14:23.479 - 00:14:34.411, Speaker A: I agree. I would like it to be clear. Yes. Let's hope we don't have like four or five days of uncertainty ambiguity. That'd be awful. Well, we're going to know soon. That's it for this.
00:14:34.411 - 00:14:38.267, Speaker A: For this week, though. Bim. Bim N from Galaxy Trading, as always, thanks.
00:14:38.331 - 00:14:38.795, Speaker B: Appreciate it.
