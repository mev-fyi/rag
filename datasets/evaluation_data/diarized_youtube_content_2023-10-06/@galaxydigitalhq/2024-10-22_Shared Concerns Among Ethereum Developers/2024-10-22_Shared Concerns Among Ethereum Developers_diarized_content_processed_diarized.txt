00:00:00.440 - 00:00:50.585, Speaker A: So during the call. One of the participants of the call, Francis Lee, he is a developer for the layer 2 rollup base. This is a rollup that was built and is operated by the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and Francis gave a presentation on the call to developers explaining the urgency for having a blob capacity increase in the next immediate Ethereum upgrade. And as a refresher, when developers decided to split up the Petra upgrade because there were far too many code changes in Petra, they punted the major code change that would have increased Blob capacity for Ethereum, called Peerdas, to the next upgrade after Petro, which is called Fusaka.
