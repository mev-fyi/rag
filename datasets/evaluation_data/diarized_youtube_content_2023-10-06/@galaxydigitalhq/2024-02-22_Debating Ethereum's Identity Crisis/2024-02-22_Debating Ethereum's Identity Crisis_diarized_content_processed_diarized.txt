00:00:00.160 - 00:00:41.164, Speaker A: So I think that's like one area that really needs to be thought through a little bit more heavily of will inclusion lists really improve the censorship of censorship resistance of Ethereum in practice? Given that the vast majority of validators on Ethereum are already being operated by regulated entities, and those regulated entities are probably relying on the builder or the relay to censor those transactions, and if the onus had fallen to the validator node operator to censor or not censor those transactions, I wonder if validator node operators would choose to not censor, given that they are regulated entities.
