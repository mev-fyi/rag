00:00:00.280 - 00:00:15.737, Speaker B: You're in Singapore, Nansen is in Singapore. And when we are in Singapore now for token 2049, it's I wasn't here last year but I'm told that it's double the size of last year. And I can attest there's, I mean, I'm not sure how many companies it's packed, it's absolutely packed with people and companies.
00:00:15.921 - 00:00:17.633, Speaker A: Is this success.
00:00:17.689 - 00:00:22.473, Speaker B: Of token 2049 here, is that partially a Singapore story? What is happening with crypto in Singapore?
00:00:22.529 - 00:00:52.915, Speaker A: Yes, I think that is exactly right. Token24.9 in Singapore is, I think the number one crypto conference globally now. And you know, the sort of related point, one thing I've noticed being here is that so many of the US Folks who are here are based in New York City. So to me, I feel like New York City and Singapore are kind of, I think New York City is number one for sure, but I think Singapore also is kind of elevating itself away from the past.
