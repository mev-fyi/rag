00:00:00.320 - 00:00:48.820, Speaker A: And so I think when you kind of put together all of these things and you start thinking about an SEC that doesn't have gensler, a vice presidential candidate that actually owns bitcoin and is interested in crypto legislation, when you couple this with the fact that you have Donald Trump engaging in a speaking appearance at bitcoin Nashville, all of these things start to form a very constructive picture for bitcoin domestically. Then on top of that, I view the fact that the german government is done selling as a constructive development. There's less supply coming into the market on a go forward basis.
