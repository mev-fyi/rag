00:00:00.080 - 00:00:06.310, Speaker B: Anything else that you're particularly interested in in the space? Talk about pith and soul and ETH. What else are you watching?
00:00:06.382 - 00:00:35.774, Speaker A: Categories, man, we've just started. We're late to this. Digging into the bitcoin, defi and l two sort of stuff. I'm very dismissive just because of how historically this has not been a thing, but there really seems to be momentum, and people are trying to give this a go. So we're trying to get rapidly up to speed, and we've got a couple of deals now of people that are looking to build sort of stuff, like, on top of, I guess, like, what do you want to call it? Like, defi for bitcoin? Like, is that, like, I guess the narrative.
00:00:35.814 - 00:00:40.830, Speaker B: I typically call it bitcoin as a platform as opposed to bitcoin as a monetary asset. Yeah.
00:00:40.902 - 00:00:56.734, Speaker A: So I will give that a shot. I think that's, like, got some legs on it. I think there's also just, like, enough, like, sunk assets in, like, the bitcoin ecosystem that it's not a bad place to sort of try and give it a go. So we've been. We've been doing a lot there. Like, that's where we've been spending, like, a lot of, like, resources, like, trying to get up to speed.
