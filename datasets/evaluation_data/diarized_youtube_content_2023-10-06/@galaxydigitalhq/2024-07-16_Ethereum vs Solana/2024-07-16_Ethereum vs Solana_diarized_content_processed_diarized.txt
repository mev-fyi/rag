00:00:00.200 - 00:00:18.205, Speaker A: I've. I've had a kind of hypothesis for 16 years at this point. I've been in tech for a long time, been in trading and finance for a long time. But, you know, I've tracked open source developer communities since 2008. You know, I've been on GitHub since 2008. Like, I'm old. I've been doing this a long time.
00:00:18.205 - 00:00:51.795, Speaker A: And one of the key things that I have kind of identified as it relates to a new open source technology is how much friction is involved at the developer experience level. And if you have a lot of friction, by definition, fewer developers are going to adopt it. Furthermore, if they have to learn a new programming language, or there's a whole new set of tools or something, or if the programming language is incredibly obtuse or kind of difficult to do, a Turing Complete sort of application, you're just going to struggle, right.
