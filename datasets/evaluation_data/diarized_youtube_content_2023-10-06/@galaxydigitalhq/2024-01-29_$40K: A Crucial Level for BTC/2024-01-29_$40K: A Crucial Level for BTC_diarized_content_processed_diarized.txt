00:00:00.480 - 00:00:04.878, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bibnet, a BB from Galaxy trading. As always, Bibnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:04.966 - 00:00:06.114, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:06.654 - 00:00:29.318, Speaker A: So another week in the books since we last talked. I think you well enunciated a near term bearish case for BTC last week. Where does it just stand now in your mind? I mean, we've had a whole another week in the books. We've traded sub 40 finally after as low as maybe, what, the low 38 five. Yeah, 38 five. A little bit of stability right now just at 40k.
00:00:29.406 - 00:00:29.750, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:29.822 - 00:00:30.914, Speaker A: What are you thinking now?
00:00:31.334 - 00:00:57.134, Speaker B: I think 40k is kind of a crucial level. I'd like to see us sustainably have closes above 40k for me to start getting constructive about the market. I think right now what you've seen so far is 38,500 and the 100 day moving average. Those levels have held us support, whether that's from organic demand or from short covering or from gamma hedging.
