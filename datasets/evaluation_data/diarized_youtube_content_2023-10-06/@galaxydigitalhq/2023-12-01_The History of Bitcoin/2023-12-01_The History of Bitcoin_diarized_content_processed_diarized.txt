00:00:00.200 - 00:00:39.474, Speaker A: I love this question because I think it does change a lot. I think it's also really great. And one of the things I tell, for example, researchers on my team at Galaxy, when they join, if they've entered crypto, which many of them have, I'm older than a lot of them, later than I did. I say, look, maybe they came in because they liked NFTs or Defi or whatever else. Not everyone comes through the same path these days. There's a lot happening in the cryptocurrency world but I say you really should go back and read certainly the complete Nakamoto or whatever that they have on Nook Nakamoto Institute. You should go and read some of the old bitcoin talk forms because like you need to understand that like this happens sometimes when they say, hey, you know what we really we should do on a blockchain? I'm like, yo, like how Finney suggested that already.
00:00:39.474 - 00:00:41.674, Speaker A: Like you should go back and see the lineage.
