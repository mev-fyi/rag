00:00:01.160 - 00:00:16.894, Speaker A: Hi, everyone, I'm Mike Novogratz, and this is next with Novo, guys. Everyone, this is Mike Novogratz. It's next with Novo. Couldn't be happier to have Anatoly Jakovenko. People call you Tolle.
00:00:17.014 - 00:00:18.030, Speaker B: Tolle's perfect.
00:00:18.102 - 00:00:25.234, Speaker A: From the Ukraine. I like to start. Every time I meet someone, I like to start and say, tell me about yourself. Like you grew up where?
00:00:25.554 - 00:00:26.466, Speaker B: Origin story.
00:00:26.610 - 00:00:28.614, Speaker A: Give us a little back. Or origin story.
00:00:29.074 - 00:00:44.194, Speaker B: Yeah, born in the USSR, I guess, but grew up in Illinois, Chicago area, so went to high school there, ended up in Illinois studying computer science, like, 99, 2003. My advisor at the time told me that.
00:00:44.234 - 00:00:53.206, Speaker A: Not nearly as exciting. I was hoping for. I was hoping for, like, the Ukraine revolution and throwing punches and. No. When did you migrate?
00:00:53.270 - 00:01:03.350, Speaker B: How old were you? 92 or 91? Can't quite remember at this point. But basically right after the wall fell, my family got out.
00:01:03.462 - 00:01:04.566, Speaker A: Computer science guy.
00:01:04.630 - 00:01:11.314, Speaker B: Yeah, right through the.com crash. My advisor told me that computer science might not be a good career choice.
00:01:13.694 - 00:01:15.434, Speaker A: What was your first job out of school?
00:01:17.494 - 00:01:33.560, Speaker B: So I had the startup in college that was doing, like, voice over IP, kind of Grand Central dispatch thing. We didn't have any business sense, but it was the same stack as Qualcomm was using for one of their things, and they hired me on the spot. So I went out to San Diego.
00:01:33.672 - 00:01:36.404, Speaker A: California versus Illinois for Ukraine.
00:01:40.024 - 00:01:50.874, Speaker B: I haven't been back to the Ukraine, and I only go to visit my folks during the two weeks of the year in Chicago, where it's not 100 degrees or zero degrees.
00:01:52.014 - 00:01:56.234, Speaker A: So when did you first stumble into crypto and what sucked you in?
00:01:57.534 - 00:02:38.744, Speaker B: I remember when bitcoin came out and some of my friends were messing around with it, and I thought, well, I can build a GPU miner, and somebody built that way faster than me. And then I thought, maybe I can build an FPGA or an ASIC. And then that happened within, like, you know, a few months later. So I clearly remember there was a company that promised an ASIC for bitcoin mining, and they built it, but they mined with it for six months before they gave it to anyone that preordered. So that, like, really, you know, showed me what crypto is all about. Don't trust anyone.
00:02:40.484 - 00:03:08.314, Speaker A: You know, it is interesting because in some ways, there's such beautiful communities to get formed, and there are other ways. There is this dog eat dog early on, and you still see it. You still see this weird hybrid between the beautiful communities where the white hats come in and give people their money back, but they're scamsters and fraudsters. It's just like in normal society. So your first real job in the.
00:03:08.354 - 00:03:43.514, Speaker B: Space was what, in crypto? Yeah. Really? Solana. So what really like kind of got me into it was 2017. You know, bitcoin was going bonkers, and a buddy of mine and I started building deep learning hardware that was mining crypto in the background. And that was our first foray into it. And that's when I started thinking about proof of work, why it's necessary, why it's cool, and literally had two coffees and a beer and came up with what kind of the initial idea of what became proof of history.
00:03:44.494 - 00:03:49.198, Speaker A: Talk a layman through proof of history versus proof of stake. Proof of work. Proof of.
00:03:49.326 - 00:04:15.964, Speaker B: Yeah. So proof of work is a way to measure enthalpy electricity. You got to burn electricity to generate to solve proof of work. And proof of history is just a way to measure time. So it doesn't take nearly as much energy, but you have to, you're forced to spend real time to do it. And that was really kind of like that, you know, mind blown eureka moment. I couldn't sleep for like a week.
00:04:15.964 - 00:04:41.218, Speaker B: And it was important because my spent, you know, nearly 15 years at Qualcomm time division. Multiple access was the first wireless protocol for cellular networks. Time is like this, this really core piece of optimizing those things. So once I knew I had that, I was like, okay, so you can now build scalable blockchains. And that really what started it.
00:04:41.266 - 00:05:03.084, Speaker A: You started in 2017, really? Ethereum is blown up at this point. It's trading 800, 900,000. We have all these what would be ETH killers being launched at that time from Polkadot and Cosmos and at least raising crowdfunding. You didn't crowdfund Solana. When did you raise the first money for Solana?
00:05:03.624 - 00:05:16.964, Speaker B: Basically April 2018 is when we closed like a 3 million seed round. And that was enough to get a bunch of my colleagues from Qualcomm, like principal engineers, to like say, fuck it, I'm gonna go build this thing.
00:05:17.304 - 00:05:18.656, Speaker A: So they joined you?
00:05:18.840 - 00:05:19.608, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:19.776 - 00:05:21.448, Speaker A: So Solana was the Qualcomm team.
00:05:21.496 - 00:05:23.610, Speaker B: Basically, yeah, exactly.
00:05:23.792 - 00:05:27.230, Speaker A: And your funders were friends and family crypto people?
00:05:27.342 - 00:05:31.830, Speaker B: No, like slow Ventures foundation capital, multicoin capital.
00:05:32.022 - 00:05:34.510, Speaker A: Oh, so you got classic crypto guys.
00:05:34.542 - 00:05:37.954, Speaker B: Who got Silicon Valley, like crypto people.
00:05:38.254 - 00:05:49.274, Speaker A: Yeah, I was going to call them lucky, but I guess we're all lucky. I mean, anybody who put any chip down between 2018 and now is pretty lucky. Some luckier than others, but.
00:05:50.264 - 00:06:39.312, Speaker B: Yeah, but it was the market was falling, right? Like, ETH went from 1100 to like 600 and then down to 300. So that was, that was a bottom, you know, that was like the start of a two year bear market that nobody, nobody knew that everyone thought it was going to turn around any minute. And, you know, we were trying to build this thing as fast as we could because we thought anytime at any moment, like, the bull market's going to come back. So there was no growth for solid two and a half years. And crypto really didn't take off up until basically when COVID and Black Swan, March 12, which is actually three days before we launched.
00:06:39.448 - 00:06:40.164, Speaker A: Wow.
00:06:40.744 - 00:06:43.032, Speaker B: We launched straight into the abyss.
00:06:43.208 - 00:06:52.074, Speaker A: So, yeah, so you started. Black Swan happened. COVID happened. I remember sitting to my team and I was like, guys, this changes everything. And we're off.
00:06:53.174 - 00:07:38.560, Speaker B: We had basically just gotten the network in some stable form that we thought we could launch. And we had the coinless auction lined up and a bunch of exchanges wanted to list us. We didn't want to stop the train and there's validators who were already running it ready to go. So at that moment, it felt like we could have just said, hey, this massive event happened and we need to stop and wait until the markets are better. But internally, I thought that the best time to launch was actually right after a massive crash because, you know, it's unlikely to crash again like that. You can never predict the market, right? It's impossible to predict. So if you're right after the cliff, might as well just go for it.
00:07:38.560 - 00:07:52.530, Speaker B: And that's, in retrospect, the people that came in there during that auction, they got a better price than our last private sale. They were the die hards. Right? Who else is going to invest in that time?
00:07:52.722 - 00:07:54.978, Speaker A: What did they buy salad at that time?
00:07:55.106 - 00:07:56.346, Speaker B: Twenty two cents.
00:07:56.490 - 00:08:09.894, Speaker A: Twenty two cents. People you cut about salad at traded $200. That might be the best trade of the year or two years. Yeah, it is. It is the best trade. There's some other good ones, but I don't think any as good as that.
00:08:10.474 - 00:08:52.236, Speaker B: So. Yeah, and we, the network really, like, the growth came, I think right around when we got started working with serum and FTX that that's really when the world kind of realized that there's something interesting here. And at that time, I thought, too, we had this moment, like, I don't know, three months, maybe six months when nobody else was going to launch because they're terrified of this, like, catastrophe, macro catastrophe. So we had time to, like, build stuff and like, get out there and get in front of as many people as we could with a live network while everyone else was still waiting. So our competitors. Yeah, go ahead.
00:08:52.300 - 00:09:02.936, Speaker A: Yeah. Talk a little bit about the relationship with Sam Bankman. Fried. With FTX. Sam is literally becoming a legend in the space. Yeah, funny, right? He's the accidental legend.
00:09:03.080 - 00:09:30.772, Speaker B: This was before, this was before he ascended to Mount Olympus. He was still a mere mortal at the time. FTX was not as big as it is today. And we had this demo where you smash the keyboard, and every time you press the keyboard, you see a transaction fired to the network, and it's confirmed in like 1.2 seconds at that time. And I was like, hey, look, it's live, it's smart contracts, and look, it's fast. And it was like, okay, cool.
00:09:30.772 - 00:10:10.622, Speaker B: Showed it to his engineers, and we noticed that the network was starting to have like, a bunch of transactions. I guess people were using it and it was them, like, messing around with it. And we had a bunch of calls and they're like, okay, we wanted to build an exchange. Not like uniswap, like a real exchange, but like, what we know works. And this is the first network where we think it's possible, so let's just go build it. And from our perspective, what I really liked about working with Sam was that he didn't care about the details. There wasn't any managers or a lot of deal making.
00:10:10.622 - 00:10:39.304, Speaker B: It was just kind of a handshake over the phone because we couldn't meet. And let's go just get everybody together to build this awesome thing, because no one's ever done built a central and mid order book that was fully unchained before. No one's built that as a mechanism for Defi. And he's got this personality that shifts engineering timelines. Stuff that we thought was going to take months, took weekends. Wow. So that was pretty awesome.
00:10:39.304 - 00:11:07.016, Speaker B: At that point, his team, I think there's still just six engineers behind all of FTX. They built this thing in like four weeks and launched it and went live. And we started seeing developers recognize that there's something interesting, something new here, a new set of tools that they didn't have access to in any other chain, and that's really kickstarted the whole ecosystem.
00:11:07.160 - 00:11:34.214, Speaker A: Most investors and most listeners don't really understand the difference between Ethereum and Solana and all the rest. And intuitively, there's this trade off between speed and security. Right? Speed and decentralization. Speed and security. Talk a little bit about that and how you guys fit into that in the NFL. Speed wins. It just always wins in football.
00:11:34.214 - 00:11:44.654, Speaker A: Right now, you guys are doing awesome. People are. I talk to developers, they're moving over to your network. But talk about how you think about those trade offs.
00:11:45.794 - 00:12:33.706, Speaker B: So Vitalik came up with this thing called the trilemma, where you have performance, security, and decentralization. That's the three triangles, and you kind of optimize for one or the other. And that constraint, that limit, applies to a network that doesn't use more bandwidth than it's available, than is available to it. So as long as, let's say, everybody in the world has one gigabit worth of Internet, as long as everybody doesn't send or receive more than one gigabit, you're within the trilemma. But as soon as you want to do twice as much stuff, then you have to split the network and have two of them do it independently, and then trust each other. Figure out some way to trust that they're not lying to each other. That's a really hard problem.
00:12:33.706 - 00:13:32.340, Speaker B: And this is what Ethereum has been working on for the last four or five years, and this is ETH two and their design with sharding and those systems. But because I spend a decade at Qualcomm, I can tell you that hardware moves really fast. I started with two megabyte flip phones and ended up optimizing augmented reality in a four gigabyte phone in the span of ten years. So this is as soon as I saw this problem of scaling blockchain, I immediately looked up at a data sheet of what, like a current day computer can do, and how much cryptographic operations I can shove through this thing per second. And at that time, four years ago, it was about a million per second on a modern day server. So I thought, okay, that means that this is competitive with something like Nasdaq, which is doing about half a million to a million messages per second. And censorship resistance is finance.
00:13:32.340 - 00:14:27.548, Speaker B: It's the same thing as getting access to markets. So there's something interesting here for me as a hardware kind of firmware guy. So this is really what I thought everyone else was going to approach the problem the same way, kind of thinking about it, can we make this a problem for intel, Nvidia, and those guys? So we kind of, you know, abstract ourselves out of the way, build the software so it gets out of the way of the hardware. But I think we're the only team that is really as focused on that particular angle. So the main difference between Ethereum, you know, Polkadot, avalanche, cosmos near all these other chains is how they play this game of how one shard or one sub network or parachain trusts another one. And there's a bunch of trade offs in design. And this is what they've been focusing on.
00:14:27.548 - 00:15:20.792, Speaker B: And Solana is one giant network. Everybody does the same work, but we heavily optimize and leverage hardware. So in the span of our development, we went from needing four GPU cards to get to a million signatures per second to one that can do 7 million /second wow. So that kind of like this is what I expected, right? Like the hardware is going to get cheaper networks, data centers are going to get faster. And I think we know within a span of six years, we're going to be shipping a very boring box that plugs into whatever rack you have at your business. And it's like Cisco and then Solana and it does the blockchain and you don't really think about it. And it gets faster every two years, right, because these guys are going to make faster chips and bigger chips gets faster.
00:15:20.848 - 00:15:27.592, Speaker A: Right. And so it's decentralized because you could have as many validators.
00:15:27.648 - 00:15:54.068, Speaker B: Yes, we can have, we can have very large numbers. Obviously there's limits, but on a one gigabit network, those limits are in the hundreds of thousands. It's just a matter of, can we make this thing fast enough to process all the events, all the packets, and be able to keep up with the network? So right now, I think it's at about 1000 plus voting and like 800 rpc, so close to like 2000 machines can think about it that way.
00:15:54.116 - 00:16:03.932, Speaker A: So last I saw was right before you had a glitch. The first kind of solana glitch. I have to bet you were cool as a cucumber.
00:16:04.108 - 00:16:05.784, Speaker B: That was not the first one.
00:16:06.284 - 00:16:08.624, Speaker A: The first one since you guys have been famous.
00:16:10.384 - 00:16:38.444, Speaker B: So here's the thing. What is decentralization? A lot of people talk about it in wishy washy terms, but I'm an engineer. I look at it. What can I measure about it? So the way we measure it is how much does it cost to destroy every copy of the state? Because if you do that, then you totally destroy the network. And that's true for bitcoin. It doesn't matter how much power it has. If I could magically snap my finger and destroy every copy of the bitcoin ledger, it's gone.
00:16:38.444 - 00:17:38.234, Speaker B: So that's real decentralization. How much power do I need to spend to destroy it? So right now, there's roughly 2000 of these independent validators, some businesses that run our casino, some that vote. So when the network stalls, it runs out of resources to be able to process all the information that people throwing at it for whatever reason, right? It could be an exploit, it could be a denial of service. You only need one of those to basically restart it, throw away the state that's pending, and then continue from that known point. So it's not a catastrophic event, and it demonstrates what is the whole point of decentralization. Well, if you have many number of these copies and all of these are valid, then when something like this happens, it took our community like 17 hours to get their shit together and continue. They do this on the testnet like once a month, sometimes under 4 hours.
00:17:38.234 - 00:18:14.242, Speaker B: But I think they were a little skittish because it's mainnet. So you're like, what happened? Let's analyze it. But it's generally the idea that this decentralization is the final kind of fault tolerance. How do these networks work? Well, it's people. And the cryptography allows all these people around the world to quickly come to the right decision and verify that they came to the right decision altogether. And that's kind of the magic of it. So as the network grows, you know, it might get to 10,000 people or 100,000 people running these systems.
00:18:14.242 - 00:18:24.098, Speaker B: I still suspect that if some, you know, oh, shit, event happens, that they can still continue. That's the whole point, right? Is being able to give the people the tools to do so.
00:18:24.226 - 00:18:42.530, Speaker A: So let me ask you the question, because a lot of people conceptually think they understand blockchains, but, okay, so we had 17 hours before you're like, okay, back up and running. What happens in those 17 hours? Transactions just get backed up, they just drop, right.
00:18:42.562 - 00:18:59.984, Speaker B: There's just nobody to pick them up and put them into blocks. So from an application's perspective, from a user's perspective, it looks like there was 17 hours between blocks. And I made the joke on Twitter that Solana needs to has the fastest block time, 400 milliseconds, and the slowest 17 hours.
00:19:01.804 - 00:19:06.036, Speaker A: But if you're a business running on top of Solana.
00:19:06.100 - 00:19:06.652, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:19:06.748 - 00:19:09.700, Speaker A: You're just like, patience, people. Patience, people, patience.
00:19:09.892 - 00:19:53.934, Speaker B: Yeah. And that's a serious thing, right? Because the promise of these systems is that they provide absurd reliability, that they never go down, they never, you know, get destroyed and never get hacked. Security is actually easier to build because that's just making sure all the copies are consistent and you can make as many copies as you want. But reliability is a harder problem, especially when you're trying to maximize the performance. You know, you're, you're trying to like make this thing redline all the time without, without loss to availability. So that's a challenging problem. But, you know, people have built much more complex things.
00:19:53.934 - 00:19:58.034, Speaker B: 5G LTE, all these things serve 4 billion people around the world.
00:19:58.454 - 00:20:12.634, Speaker A: How did your community react? Like, when I say your community. So they're the core developers, they're the people that have built on top of it. They're your investors. They're like, what was the broad reaction? So any hate mail?
00:20:13.294 - 00:20:50.132, Speaker B: No. Like, so we've, because we've had like our whole start even to launch has been the network constantly falling over. The first one was 20 minutes, then 2 hours, then a week, then a month, and then it was running and running under stress tests. And the community is kind of used to it. So we had a lot of internal support and they just did what they're supposed to do. They ran a bunch of consistency checks. And the way the recovery works is that there isn't some central organization that tells you, okay, everybody recover from this thing.
00:20:50.132 - 00:21:26.410, Speaker B: It's that everybody runs a tool against their copy of the state, their ledger, and then they continue. And if everyone agrees on the results, the network continues running. And if 80% don't agree, it just halted. And then we got to do more work to figure out why. So in that sense, people are just doing what they're supposed to do and super supportive. You get a lot of flack from like, the other tribes, but, you know, we take it in stride. We know we still call it beta for that reason, is that it's complicated.
00:21:26.410 - 00:21:33.618, Speaker B: Building an operating system, a database, it's a ten year proposition, right? It's like a lifetime of work and we're four years in.
00:21:33.706 - 00:22:17.554, Speaker A: Let's talk about tribes for a second. I'm fascinated with how tribal crypto is. And as I sit as an investor in, put bets on lots of tribes and comment on them, I literally, sometimes I'm a hero of some ecosystems and I'm a complete foiler villain of others, and I get trolled all the time by certain ecosystems. I mean, 30, 40 times a day. How do you see the future playing out? I mean, we got brilliant people in this space, right? Like, you look at what Vitalik and his group are doing at Ethereum, or how do you see the blockchains? Is it going to be a world of coexisting blockchains or are there going to be some dominant, like, if you were just forecasting?
00:22:19.134 - 00:23:04.810, Speaker B: My hope is that it's kind of so I grew up kind of as a technologist in the Linux era nineties. There were literally tribes around Linux file systems. People that got so into the Linux kernel that they would fight each other on the Internet because of one file system or another, or because of one Linux distribution or another. I use Gantu and the people that use Gantu people thought were annoying because were all about optimizing the software. And it was just funny. But I think it comes from this idea that when you have something magical in your hand, you cant predict how powerful its going to be. You kind of have, it's almost religious, right? You're holding like an artifact.
00:23:04.810 - 00:24:09.874, Speaker B: Is this thing going to be like so cool that it's just going to change everything and you buy into it? Just like people bought into the apple kind of idea of personal computer and you become a fan of it and you like it becomes part of your culture. So I think that's just a natural thing that happens during any paradigm shifting process. We get enthralled with the idea of like what could this change about the world? And I hope it doesn't end up like most things where you have like one Android, that's 99.99% of all Linuxes is Android or one, right? Like one company that is the personal computer company like we did with Microsoft. I think that diversity, if we can maintain it, just, it's just more fun, right? Like you get actually more, more progress, more competition. And I think there's an opportunity where that's true because one huge difference around from this generation of builders is that everything is open source by default. Everything is open.
00:24:09.874 - 00:24:36.214, Speaker B: It's a very collaborative environment. You know, I, even though we argue on Twitter, private or not even privately, but like I love the folks building ETH too. Like we discussed like really hard challenging problems, like privately, like hey, how does this work? How did you guys solve this? It's very much a open collaborative environment. So my hope is that that continues, that we can all still work on cool shit, that would be awesome.
00:24:37.194 - 00:24:42.490, Speaker A: What do your parents think of all this? Do they still have a ukrainian accent at all?
00:24:42.562 - 00:25:15.694, Speaker B: Yeah, my God. Yeah, yeah, there, yeah, my Russian is now like they're broken English. So we're having trouble communicating because I'm forgetting, right? And they started late, they don't like none of my, nobody older than me gets it. That's what I'm finding. None of my family doesn't understand. My cousins and nieces get it. They're like oh yeah, I get it.
00:25:15.694 - 00:25:18.054, Speaker B: Like I want this bad nft okay.
00:25:19.594 - 00:25:46.274, Speaker A: I always tell people I'm the oldest guy in crypto, but it is really a hard thing to keep up with. And it's really hard to explain to 60, 70, 80 year olds. They're like, eh. So how's your life changed now? You've gone from engineer, working at Qualcomm, having a good, making a good living, to now like entrepreneurs exhausted zillionaire. Have you shifted the way your life lives or are you still the same.
00:25:46.314 - 00:25:50.506, Speaker B: Guy at least by same, at least.
00:25:50.530 - 00:25:51.494, Speaker A: Buy a nice car.
00:25:53.034 - 00:26:20.748, Speaker B: Got a, got a Tesla model y, can fit seven seats, nothing like exciting yet. I just don't have time. Reality is that I'm trying to steer a complex technology problem and grow the user base at the same time. It's like, know, early days when the pc market was taken off and it's just like exhausting but exciting. You know, that's where, that's why I'm here.
00:26:20.916 - 00:26:23.784, Speaker A: Right? And your core team is how big?
00:26:25.124 - 00:26:35.372, Speaker B: It's like 70 people altogether of 32 engineers, half on the core database operating system part and half on the application.
00:26:35.428 - 00:26:49.004, Speaker A: Level and the community around it that works on the project, not projects on the project, but on the project itself. How many other people do you think that?
00:26:49.304 - 00:27:29.874, Speaker B: I think that's getting into like a few thousand peripherally. A lot of core contributors that are working on the application side are not part of Solana. So they're folks out of serum, out of star Atlas, out of Phantom. Like a bunch of these small, small teams like Metaplex, they found their little niche with product market fit and they're iterating. But they're releasing a lot of the changes to the community so people can pick them, pick them up and reuse them. So that true open source kind of let's all work together, that's happening. And that to me is like, holy shit, that's awesome.
00:27:31.254 - 00:27:39.194, Speaker A: If I had to pick a time, one year, two year, three years, when you come back and you're like, whoa, it worked. Are we three years away?
00:27:40.854 - 00:28:18.994, Speaker B: When we get to 100 million people that use self custody keys on these chains for applications, for something, for nfts, I don't care what it is, I think we'll be there. And that's that moment on the Internet when you had 100 million people browsing and you saw friendster Orkut pop up and you're like, okay, that's the model going to get it right. We're not quite there yet. Like, not, not quite at that. Like, it's obvious that this is going to be the thing. So it's exciting because we're like, well, what is it going to be like? You know, I have, like, my ideas, but I, you know, there's no way I could predict it.
00:28:19.774 - 00:28:25.798, Speaker A: Awesome. Hey, so anything else you want to say? I always give guests free open mic. You've said a lot.
00:28:25.846 - 00:28:45.900, Speaker B: Yeah. Plug, ignition, hackathon, Solana.com ignition. Our hackathons, we have one from 1000, 3013 thousand registrations. This one, I think is around 5000, but way more engineers. So I think we should see hundreds of submissions. So, really excited about what people are building.
00:28:45.900 - 00:28:56.544, Speaker B: If you're not an engineer, just jump into discord and talk to these folks and convince them to quit their jobs at Google and go start a crypto company. This is the best time to do it.
00:28:58.054 - 00:28:59.062, Speaker A: You're all in?
00:28:59.198 - 00:29:00.674, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm all in.
00:29:01.254 - 00:29:21.670, Speaker A: Well, listen, I have enjoyed the heck out of this. I'm, you know, I'm proud of you. I think what you guys have done is awesome. Listen, I think you've got, you know, we love the guys that jump, and I know those guys are partners of yours, and I see what Sam's doing. And so I think you guys have a. An awesome shot at it. And so we'll be cheering you on and watching and appreciate it.
00:29:21.670 - 00:29:22.870, Speaker A: Appreciate all your time.
00:29:23.022 - 00:29:24.072, Speaker B: Thank you so much.
00:29:24.198 - 00:29:31.124, Speaker A: Yep. Guys, that's it for this episode of next with Novo. A big thanks to Toli. We'll see you next week.
