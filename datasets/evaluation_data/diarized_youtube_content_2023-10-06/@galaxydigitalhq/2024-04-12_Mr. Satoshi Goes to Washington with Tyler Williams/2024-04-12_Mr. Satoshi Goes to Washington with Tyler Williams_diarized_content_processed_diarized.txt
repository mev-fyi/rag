00:00:44.294 - 00:00:45.566, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:45.750 - 00:00:59.598, Speaker A: Always great to have you on Galaxy brains. And it kind of an exciting week in macro. I guess I'm sounding like a broken record. It has. It continues to be exciting in the world of macroeconomics, I guess. You tell me. And I've been traveling, so I haven't been as close to it.
00:00:59.598 - 00:01:02.486, Speaker A: But the big news was what a hot CPI print.
00:01:02.670 - 00:01:45.894, Speaker B: Yes, we got a very strong CPI number today. It printed 0.4 month on month. And there's lots of details in the report that suggests that inflation is likely creeping higher and that the data that we saw in January and February weren't aberrations. But they are part of a broad theme of inflation being higher than what folks expected. The areas where we saw a reasonable amount of strength that I thought were notable were things like car insurance and healthcare costs. Those things are moving up higher pretty quickly.
00:01:45.894 - 00:02:52.644, Speaker B: And all of a sudden, it used to be that people would make the argument that the three month run rate for inflation or the six month run rate for inflation is below target now. It's well above. And when you look at things like services, inflation, ex housing, those figures are well above 4% and now are in areas where the Fed should feel uncomfortable about cutting. And so given the big beat and the details of the beat, the market has started to price out a lot of cuts for this year. Two years, treasuries were off by 22 23 basis points. So almost a full cut getting baked out of that two year point. And yeah, the bright spots to it, I would say, are the components that showed the most strength aren't necessarily going to show up in PCE I think the healthcare stuff, for example, doesn't get included in PCE.
00:02:52.644 - 00:03:23.008, Speaker B: There's an argument to be made that depending on how PPI comes out, this might not impact PCE as much. But it's really hard to ignore these CPI figures. They're well above the Fed's target. It does not indicate that inflation is slowing. It looks like it's reaccelerating. The job market is still hot. And it fits the narrative of just, you know, a hot economy that we've had over the past couple of months.
00:03:23.008 - 00:03:34.592, Speaker B: And so I think there's a lot of, you know, cold water being thrown onto Powell's arguments for why he wanted to cut three times and why the Fed officials had three cuts in their, you know, dot projections.
00:03:34.728 - 00:04:11.834, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw, even I saw Mike Novogratz had tweeted he didn't see any good reason to cut rates at this point. No, no, no reason at all. You, I gotta hand it to you, bim net, you've been saying this at this point for months, basically that, that there's no real reason to cut, that you don't feel the need to cut here, that the economy is doing well without the cuts. We don't need the cuts, and that inflation looked pretty sticky. Markets weren't very pleased with that number, though, right? Probably. I mean, it makes sense if you're repricing now fewer cuts. What do we have now? What's the expectation now for end of the year number of cuts? Two?
00:04:11.954 - 00:04:18.926, Speaker B: A little. No, it's actually under two now. Wow. It's closer to like, you know, one and a half one, you know, so.
00:04:18.950 - 00:04:21.918, Speaker A: Basically it's like, it's like maybe one is kind of what?
00:04:22.046 - 00:05:06.714, Speaker B: Maybe there's a one to two. One to two is kind of the established, you know, range now. And you've seen a bunch of, you know, sell side banks reduce their forecast from three cuts to two already on the year. You know, there are certain things that, you know, like, I'll give you an idea about, like, how hard it is to kind of really get a grasp on the data. So we had the small business survey that came out yesterday, and the employment component was super soft. And typically, small business employment leads the broader unemployment rate for the economy because small businesses can move faster than big institutions, et cetera, et cetera. So the labor market for small business is looking awful.
00:05:06.714 - 00:05:41.652, Speaker B: However, then you start looking at their expectations with respect to raising prices. And the price increase component was really strong. And so we're seeing a situation where even if the hiring and stuff is slowing a little bit or it might slow. The price pressures are still there. And then on top of that, you have a commodity complex that's trading incredibly well. Part of it is a function of oil going bid on some of these Mideast headlines. Some of it's a function of the stimulus efforts in China.
00:05:41.652 - 00:06:27.724, Speaker B: And so you're seeing things like copper trade. Well, but at the end of the day, if gas prices are higher, that is bad for inflation. Now the flip side to all of this stuff is that inflation, at least for a large portion of the population, is actually a tax. If you're telling me that your car insurance premium is up 25% this year, right, and you're paying $100 a month now, it's 125. Like that $25 is essentially a tax on you. And we know that incomes aren't keeping up with a 25% increase. And so more and more, given where savings are in the economy, people aren't.
00:06:27.724 - 00:07:12.436, Speaker B: The savings rate isn't like COVID levels, 20, 30% anymore. People are net spending, not net saving anymore. And so you've seen excess savings come down and you're now seeing price for a lot of like everyday goods go up. And so that's gonna eat into the consumer a lot. And I would say that folks have already adjusted a lot of their behaviors because of these price increases. Like, I'll give you an example. Like if you were going out to eat with your family like three to four times a week when prices were reasonable, let's say you've already cut that down to two to three or once a week or once a month, but now you're grocery shopping more.
00:07:12.436 - 00:08:15.284, Speaker B: But now your grocery prices are starting to increase more. And it's like, well, then there's the people that went from shopping at high end grocers to mid tier grocers. And so that behavioral shift in the economy has already happened. And so when you start to see inflation tick higher again with this low savings base, it makes you think that the consumer is really going to slow down. And that's precisely, precisely what you are getting out of us companies that are consumer oriented and how those consumer discretionary companies are trading and the guidance that they're giving is that the US consumer is slowing down and this inflation is likely not going to help. I feel like Powell's stuck between a rock and a hard place where there's so many conflicting pieces of evidence and there's not really, like, you should do this with like a high level of confidence. And so I'm sitting here being like, Powell has a hard job.
00:08:15.284 - 00:08:27.264, Speaker B: Now. At the same time, what are the best things to hedge Powell's jobs? It's still gold, it's still silver, it's still bitcoin. It's, you know, real world assets that protect purchasing power.
00:08:27.384 - 00:08:56.590, Speaker A: And let's talk about bitcoin real quick. Just the near term outlook. You know, we had run as low as what, like 62 ish a couple of weeks ago. Then we, we made it up to the 72k range earlier this week, actually, I think was that not yesterday, but the day before? So Monday and then on this, on this news, along with other stuff. Right. Bitcoin down, you know, back in the 67, 68 range. Do we care? Is this just kind of noise at this point? Like bitcoin still in that range, already.
00:08:56.662 - 00:09:46.274, Speaker B: Rallied from that, that morning sell off. I mean, we're back like 69, like 200 right now, which tells you that it's a dangerous thing to short. And you've seen a little bit of a short covering rally today in the afternoon. And broadly speaking, this is a healthy bullish consolidation. Prices need to calm down and it gives people more confidence that the market is mature and it flushes out the weak hands. The guys that are just in there for a couple percent here and there and they can't hold bags, they get chopped out of the market. And then you're left with a situation where market starts going up and the people holding it are not really sellers until much higher levels.
00:09:46.274 - 00:10:36.794, Speaker B: And so the way I'm looking at it from a chart perspective and just from a general sentiment perspective, is that this is just chopping, this is consolidation. The fundamentals are still there. I think anybody in bitcoin, I don't really know many people that are real believers in bitcoin that are selling it and the equity folks that are picking it up in retirement accounts, these are buy and hold types, people that have been conditioned to buy and hold every asset in their accounts for a really long time. You know, I think the setup still there and then you've got the catalysts in terms of the habiting coming up as well. Who knows how crypto will trade around that. But I'll say high level. I'm very comfortable holding bitcoin right now.
00:10:36.794 - 00:10:46.882, Speaker B: And the best thing to do with holding an asset like bitcoin is just not traded around too much, because you never know when you're going to get those seven 8910 percent days.
00:10:46.978 - 00:10:54.528, Speaker A: Yeah, we've done those, we've done that work and shown that it's like, you know, 80% of the gains were on like five days in one year, ten days.
00:10:54.576 - 00:10:54.928, Speaker C: Right.
00:10:55.016 - 00:11:10.280, Speaker B: And if you miss those days, it's, it's almost impossible to match the performance of the bitcoin. And so, you know, I would just generally say that, you know, stay long and strong, stick with the trend and protect your purchasing power.
00:11:10.352 - 00:11:17.206, Speaker A: PPP push and pm. I love it, my friend. Bim net from Galaxy trading. Thanks so much.
00:11:17.390 - 00:11:18.274, Speaker B: Pleasure.
00:11:19.414 - 00:11:26.390, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, Tyler Williams, Galaxy's head of public policy. Tyler, thank you for coming back to galaxy. Brains, my friend.
00:11:26.542 - 00:11:29.142, Speaker C: Of course, it's been a long time. Good to be back with you.
00:11:29.198 - 00:11:35.734, Speaker A: Has it been? I can't remember. We've been on many times. I guess it hasn't been this year yet. So sometime in 23.
00:11:35.894 - 00:11:45.470, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we did a wrap up call at the end of last year. Maybe just sort of quick hits, but I don't think we've really gotten into any substance in a while.
00:11:45.582 - 00:12:13.084, Speaker A: Well, we're back. Markets have evolved and matured, dare I say grown, certainly a lot since whenever that was. So we want to check in with you on a couple topics. I'm going to go into a few, but before we do that, I'm in DC with you. We were at the Bitcoin Policy Institute's policy summit yesterday at the National Press Club. I thought it was great event. What did you think of it? This is a real policy wonky event, but it was good.
00:12:13.124 - 00:12:42.962, Speaker C: Yeah, I think they did a fantastic job. They had a great lineup of lawmakers and policymakers throughout the executive branch at the conference. I think at one point they had 16 or 17,000 people live streaming the event. And it was a packed house in all of the, in the main room and the ballroom for, you know, the fancy high level speakers, the chairman, McHenry, et cetera. But it was either. Exactly, exactly. There's a ton of folks there.
00:12:42.962 - 00:12:54.378, Speaker C: I think Representative Nickel was there as well. But it was a packed house in the main ballroom, and it was also packed house and, like, the side conversations that were going on during the conference as well, so. Great event.
00:12:54.426 - 00:12:57.642, Speaker A: Yeah. And I was only there, this is.
00:12:57.658 - 00:13:07.386, Speaker C: Only their second year doing it, so to see what they've built in this sort of short order and the influence that they've been able to exert in Washington is quite reflective.
00:13:07.490 - 00:13:22.114, Speaker A: Yeah. Shout out to David and grant from the Bitcoin Policy Institute. Really great. Really great event. Saw a lot of good friends there, gave a fiery political speech, which I know that was your favorite moment. You were just telling me off camera that my speech was your favorite part of the conference, weren't you saying?
00:13:22.154 - 00:13:27.134, Speaker C: Some have been saying, I won't name names, but some have been saying that it was the best speech of the event.
00:13:29.114 - 00:13:47.210, Speaker A: That they'll post that on YouTube for our audience at some point. So I'll share that link. But we're going to talk, Tyler, about crypto regulation and legislation and all that stuff in a minute. But before we do, let's get, let's just talk about the sort of broader Washington legislative macro stuff. What does the calendar look like? What is on the forefront of the House's mind at this point?
00:13:47.402 - 00:14:48.398, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. Great question. So I think most people remember, most listeners will remember the consternation that was going on around the funding of the government. And there's always sort of teetering on this edge of are we or will we not fund the government? So I think we've largely moved past that and we've moved into this world of, I want to call like the springtime, early summer, the pre August recess that Washington's known for, where we've moved into these, these silos and verticals of discrete policy issues. So now the conversation has moved into reauthorizing FISA and FISA reform and FAA reauthorization. And we moved into this conversation about additional funding resources for Ukraine. And I think that when I think about these issues, we see engagement from the speaker and the leader and the Senate in terms of where there may be overlap in terms of coming together on issues.
00:14:48.398 - 00:15:10.776, Speaker C: And I think that there are vectors that are created of sort of policy opportunities, so to speak, where legislators in the crypto space, the people who really care about a digital asset policy, they're looking at those issues as opportunities to attach their projects to. That's how I think about how things are shaping up in the next two or three months.
00:15:10.920 - 00:15:37.278, Speaker A: And then we've discussed what those policy issues are on the table in Congress for digital assets. It's been stable. Coins, market structure, some illicit activity questions, some other stuff. But first of all, what does the landscape look like? What has any traction right now? What are the biggest crypto and digital asset topics? And then what are the likelihoods that they come to fruition this Congress?
00:15:37.446 - 00:16:23.918, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I'll get to that question. Let me answer a question you didn't ask prior to that. So I think in the financial services world, the world of things that are being talked about is the Safer Banking act, the ability for depository institutions to provide banking services to legal cannabis businesses. And that's relevant to this debate in a couple of different ways. There's also the recoup act, which is the executive compensation callback for bank executives. So those are sort of like two big areas that we've seen some agreement or desire to work on from both the House and the Senate and ours indies. And those are magnets for germane but sometimes controversial legislation.
00:16:23.918 - 00:17:21.440, Speaker C: And what I'm talking about is the interchange legislation like the Durbin Marshall legislation for price caps for the card networks. And also there can be opportunities for other pieces of legislation, such as the stablecoin legislative matters or the market infrastructure, the digital asset market structure legislation. In my opinion, I think it's really hard to attach bills because once one member or one senator starts asking for their pet project and other ones are raising their hands. So you just get into this debate where there has to be, there's basically, there has to be a picking of which is going to get in, which isn't. And the more things that are added, the tougher it is to have your project in there. So I guess I think that of the things that could be opportunities in the digital asset space, stablecoins has the best opportunity right now in the next six, seven months.
00:17:21.552 - 00:18:11.456, Speaker A: It felt like they got really close to doing it, what, two summers ago with Maxine Waters when she was still the chairman of the, of House Financial Services Committee, that it seemed like there really wasn't that much daylight, at least on paper, policy wise, between the various, the republican and the democratic sides. It was, it seemed like a, who, the question was mostly around who should regulate a regulated stablecoin issuer. Right. And it was like, should it be a bunch of whomever, banking regulators or state regulators, which is sort of the republican side. And it seemed like the Democrats were saying at the time in that debate, like it should be the fed and that, I don't really recall there being any other disagreements. Now, is that right? First of all, is my memory correct? And then also, even though that seems small, like that's actually a pretty big disagreement that has big implications. Maybe that's why.
00:18:11.456 - 00:18:20.884, Speaker A: But is, is, are we close? I mean, to get it done, it would have to answer that question, right. Who regulates it? And is that something that can be negotiated?
00:18:21.944 - 00:19:00.372, Speaker C: Of course it's something that can be negotiated. I think you're spot on, and you're correct in the assessment of the issues. It's, it's largely this state versus federal pathway and the duality approach, which I'll just remind people that we have like a dual banking system, like we do have that. And it's also the, the ability or sort of the requirement of federal, a federal approval at the end of the day for state licensed entities and state pathways. So I think it is largely that. And in my opinion, I don't think that the negotiators are terribly far apart. But again, it's still a question like, it is.
00:19:00.372 - 00:19:20.252, Speaker C: It is a big first step, and you have to get sort of consistent alignment across a lot of different constituents, being the NEC, the Fed, treasury. You have to get the stakeholders in Congress to agree. So it's just a lot of people that need to be in the room all sing from the same sheet of music, and sometimes that is difficult.
00:19:20.428 - 00:19:44.104, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. Let's talk about illicit finance, which, you know, has been a big issue, particularly re raised by Senator Elizabeth Warren following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7 with her digital asset anti money Laundering act proposal in the Senate. We've spoken at length in general, both of us.
00:19:44.144 - 00:19:44.624, Speaker B: I have.
00:19:44.664 - 00:20:11.964, Speaker A: I've had people on this show about why we think daml, that bill is bad law, um, and effectively a ban on crypto in America. But, um, a, first of all, where does that stand? Is that. I mean, she was adding co sponsors, you know, like a dripping faucet, uh, for a while. But I haven't seen anything over the last couple months. What is the likelihood there, and has there been any develop. I haven't seen any, um, alternative proposals. If this is such a big deal, which I'm saying that's if.
00:20:11.964 - 00:20:21.940, Speaker A: But if it is, wouldn't I expect to see more proposals out there than just Senator Warren's? What's the status on hers and any competitive other drafts that are. That are out there?
00:20:22.092 - 00:20:36.944, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. So just to back up. So the deputy secretary of the Department of treasury was before the Senate banking committee yesterday while the Bitcoin policy Institute conference was going on. So there was a lot of attention.
00:20:37.324 - 00:20:38.828, Speaker A: Wally Adeyamo, right.
00:20:38.876 - 00:21:35.212, Speaker C: Yes, exactly. Exactly. So he was up there testifying about illicit finance, and there was obviously a lot of focus on digital assets, largely driven by a healthy amount of senators who sit on the banking committee and their respective interest in this policy issue. Because as we all know, when we saw the fall of last year moving into the winter, there was just a heightened focus on these issues post the terrorist attacks in Israel. So I think we've seen that and we've seen that continue. I think Senator Warren, on her piece of legislation is up to 20 or so co sponsors, which is a material portion of the US Senate. And I think what we've also seen is that there's become more interest from some of the members on the banking committee who haven't always been interested in digital asset or crypto policy.
00:21:35.212 - 00:22:59.848, Speaker C: So if you watch the hearing yesterday, you'll recall that Senator Tillis and Hagerty had put out a discussion draft of legislation. And I think how their viewing is, it's their policy response to the asks that the deputy secretary and the Treasury Department had for additional resources and authorities relative to their authorities for FinCEN, for sanctions. So we've seen efforts on the democratic side from Senator Warren and Senator Warner, and now we've seen republican interest from Senators Tillis and Hagerty. And in my view, even though there's a lot of consternation and this engenders a lot of sort of tension in the digital asset policy or ecosystem writ large, there are more people who are in the debate on these issues, which is a net positive if you want progressive activity to happen. And what I mean by that is you have to get to 60 votes to vote on something in the US Senate for it to become law and get advanced to the president's decks. This and the more people are interested means the more people that can potentially get behind other things like stablecoin legislation or market structure. Because at the end of the day, for any of these things to happen, there has to be a deal cut that gets 260 votes.
00:22:59.976 - 00:23:00.376, Speaker A: Yep.
00:23:00.440 - 00:23:02.128, Speaker C: That's what matters as I see it.
00:23:02.256 - 00:23:31.806, Speaker A: Interesting. Yeah, some interesting clips from that hearing. People should check out on YouTube, too. I enjoyed. I did see the exchange that Senator Tillis had. I thought it was quite interesting. Haven't heard him speak publicly very often about digital assets, but I will say he and Senator John Hickenlooper did introduce the Proof act in 2023, which is the approving reserves on others Funds act mandates proof of reserves in the digital asset economy for third party custodians, which I thought was a great bill.
00:23:31.806 - 00:23:41.088, Speaker A: And we had members of both his staff and Hickenlooper's staff on this show, so go check that out. So great to see him staying involved and interested in this issue.
00:23:41.246 - 00:24:12.130, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's strange a lot happened in 2022. Not much has happened in digital asset policy making in the successive years since the calamitous blow ups of 22. But substantive issues and substantive policy proposals that would largely address these issues haven't been advanced. So it's a question of, like, what can we do to move the conversation forward to have good things happen to protect customers in the US and promote the economy in us. Yeah.
00:24:12.162 - 00:25:00.868, Speaker A: And not to, you know, just continuously beat this dead horse. But Senator Warren said after Sam Bankman Freed was sentenced to jail, on Twitter, she wrote that this all, you know, reminds us that we need legislation to protect people's money from people like Sam Einkman fried. And I would just point out that her bill does nothing to protect or protect customers or prevent the next FTX at all. But something like the proof act absolutely would specifically address that blow up. So just good to see a growing number of thoughtful legislators getting involved with interesting new proposals. So, and what do you think? Just to clearly, like, I mean, we're. Does undersecretary, Undersecretary Adeyamo, is that deputy secretary? Deputy secretary.
00:25:00.868 - 00:25:05.964, Speaker A: So he, like, basically runs Fincen, right? Like, he's the financial, I would think.
00:25:06.004 - 00:25:25.292, Speaker C: Of him as the, the layer between the undersecretaries at treasury, which there's three separate verticals at treasury. There's domestic finance, international affairs, and then TFI, the terrorism of financial intelligence, which oversees Fincen. And then he sits as the layer between those three verticals. And the secretary.
00:25:25.388 - 00:25:27.476, Speaker A: Oh, wow. No, no. He's like number two at treasury then.
00:25:27.500 - 00:25:28.764, Speaker C: Basically number two at treasury.
00:25:28.804 - 00:26:01.580, Speaker A: Wow. That's a big job. Does him talking about this more and appearing at the hearing yesterday, does it increase the odds or does it, is it putting more pressure on getting something done? Like, again, you were talking about how we're in this spring to, you're already talking about the August reset. It's literally April 10 as we record this. How much time is there to get something done in general in Congress? But also, like, does this likelihood of illicit finance, is it likely to get done one way or another or at all? Like, what's the, like? Is it increasing? Like, what's the temperature on it in your mind?
00:26:01.652 - 00:26:53.446, Speaker C: I think it's just. So to answer that question specifically, I think illicit finance and AML reforms, whatever, I don't know what the end product looks like that will be enacted. I feel relatively confident that something will happen in that area. And it's almost become table stakes for other things happening in crypto policy. So as I think about, like, stable coins and AML, they pair pretty succinctly together because at the end of the day, we're talking about sort of bank like enterprises and bank like products, and they pair nicely together because we put a lot of onus and responsibility on our depository institutions for performing BSA, AML, KYC, Kye requirements over the years. So they've, it's almost become table stakes. I think if we get that right, it unlocks the, it unlocks the future of other progress in legislative areas.
00:26:53.590 - 00:27:21.004, Speaker A: Interesting. You know, we didn't talk about this, but it is election year. Literally, we're in it now. We've got a vice presidential nominee from Robert F. Kennedy Junior. We've got Vice President Kamala Harris, but we have no nominee yet from former President Trump, who is almost guaranteed to be the republican nominee at this point, effectively is not asking you to predict who it might be. But that's not the point of the question.
00:27:21.004 - 00:27:43.754, Speaker A: But how's the vibe changing whether it's on the hill or just in Washington at some point? I mean, we've all lived this many times. Well, the older you are, the more times you've lived it. Eventually the entire discussion becomes consumed with the election. I think we're not quite there is my sense yet where it's not the only thing, but, you know, that further reduces the window for progressive new legislation, does it not?
00:27:44.774 - 00:28:31.358, Speaker C: I think, I certainly think it does. I think you were talking a little bit about the floor schedule and the time that is left in Congress. And yes, you're right, we're talking about August recess already. But if you think about just sort of the, the math of when the House and the Senate are both in session for the rest of the year, and just a reminder to people that the fiscal year in DC ends September 30. So really working backwards from that timeframe, it's like six weeks that we really have, in my opinion, of real legislating item. And if you think about the US Senate, it takes a good amount of time to people in DC say get onto a bill. And when they talk about get onto a bill, it's the amount of floor time that they have to burn to move the debate, move the debate forward in the US Senate.
00:28:31.358 - 00:28:53.724, Speaker C: And it takes a lot of hours to do that in our legislative process. So we don't have much time. So that's why I was talking about those vectors of opportunities like the legislative, things like that. You really have to focus on those discrete issues as it relates to the potential opportunity to add things into it. And it's a really small number of days and small amount of time and items.
00:28:54.264 - 00:29:10.472, Speaker A: Tyler, what else is on your mind when it comes to regulation in Washington, whether it's regulation or legislation or policy or what's interesting here that people should be looking into or what are you looking at beyond what we've discussed? Anything standing out that, well, maybe I'll.
00:29:10.488 - 00:29:53.390, Speaker C: Just hearken back to the theme of some of the BPI conference, because I think one thing that was resounding to me is obviously the Bitcoin Policy Institute is there to promote and defend and talk about bitcoin. They are singularly focused, and that's really good in Washington because policymakers and lawmakers in particular have constituents that are diverse and all across like the US and all across the globe and different issues, and they hear and listen to them. That's their job. And for the digital asset economy to be successful in legislating, you have to be really, really singular focused. So that was a resounding thing that I think we heard from BPI.
00:29:53.542 - 00:30:07.542, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, you can't just going with the giant, like Web three and bitcoin and all these digital assets, it's like too big, right. You need to, like make it clear and simple in a way to have real success.
00:30:07.598 - 00:30:45.470, Speaker C: Yeah, maybe I'll, maybe I'll leave it with this. Like the, the thing that I heard chairman McHenry talking about the other day was he seems pretty positive and bullish on his ability to get something done and creating durable lawn. Obviously, I think he is acutely aware of the limited opportunities to make that happen. However, he's retiring, as most listeners will probably know as well. And I think he's going to spend a lot of time and effort and political capital and getting it done. He's been around for 20 years, so I'm hopeful and I look forward to the prospects of something good happening.
00:30:45.612 - 00:31:05.554, Speaker A: Yeah, that'd be great. I love the BPI. I like that their acronym is the same as the Bank Policy Institute, which is chaired by none other than our friend Jamie Dimon. But this is the Bitcoin Policy Institute. They did have a great summit. Again, shout out to David and Grant there. Tyler, my friend, head of policy at Galaxy, Tyler Williams, thank you so much for coming back to Galaxy brains.
