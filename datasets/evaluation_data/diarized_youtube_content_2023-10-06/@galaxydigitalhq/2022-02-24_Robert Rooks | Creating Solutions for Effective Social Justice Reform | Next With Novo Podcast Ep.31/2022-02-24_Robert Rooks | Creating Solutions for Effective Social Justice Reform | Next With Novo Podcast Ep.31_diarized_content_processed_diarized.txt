00:00:01.130 - 00:00:31.334, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. I'm Mike Novogratz and this is next with Nova. We're here next with Nova with Robert Rooks. He is the CEO of the Reform alliance, our executive director. Executive director, CEO, kind of the same thing. Reform alliance is one of the, I think, most promising groups in the criminal justice reform space, primarily focused on probation and parole, but bigger aspirations. Give us a little bit about you.
00:00:31.334 - 00:00:33.686, Speaker A: You're born and raised, born in New.
00:00:33.708 - 00:01:08.722, Speaker B: York, Long Island, New York. Father was a minister, mother nurse. We moved to Dallas, Texas, when I was five, and I spent most of my time growing up in Dallas. I found myself in this work based on my experiences in Dallas in the mid eighty s, nineteen eighty three. We were in a working class community, right. Folks in the southern part of Dallas were mainly in the service sector, right? Just hardworking folks. We had a TV repair guy.
00:01:08.722 - 00:01:32.038, Speaker B: Can you believe that? We had those back then, of course, you know, but we had TV repair guy across the street, a mechanic on the other side, a social worker. Like I said, my parents were nurse and a minister, and that was our community. 1980. 1980. But everything changed right about 1984 85. And that was the influx of crack cocaine. It became an epidemic in our neighborhood.
00:01:32.038 - 00:01:46.942, Speaker B: We saw people losing their homes. We saw people losing their jobs, and we didn't see any help. There was no counselors, social workers or investments in our neighborhood to help us deal with what we were saying. It was the first time.
00:01:46.996 - 00:01:47.934, Speaker A: How old were you?
00:01:48.052 - 00:01:48.990, Speaker B: I was ten.
00:01:49.140 - 00:01:50.938, Speaker A: How'd you stay away from crack?
00:01:51.114 - 00:02:20.898, Speaker B: I was athlete. Played football, actually, when I started Oak Cliff Redskins when I was ten years old in Dallas and stayed all the way. I was a scholarship athlete. But also what helped me, I had older brothers and they didn't stay away from it. They were impacted by it in different ways, but they always made sure that I was on the straight and narrow. And I'm always going to be, it's.
00:02:20.914 - 00:02:43.294, Speaker A: Okay, I'm going to screw myself up, but damn it, I'm going to make sure my brother doesn't. There's something noble to that. But it's like, listen, I have lots of sympathy for people that get hooked on drugs. You're young. Listen, I've done plenty of drugs. There's no judgment. But I find this an interesting story and I hear it a lot because.
00:02:43.332 - 00:02:51.490, Speaker B: I was the youngest. I was kind of the hope in some ways in my family. Youngest of nine, right? Youngest of nine.
00:02:51.560 - 00:02:52.510, Speaker A: What's the age gap?
00:02:52.590 - 00:02:53.570, Speaker B: Oh, my gosh.
00:02:55.030 - 00:02:56.674, Speaker A: Same parents I administer. Dad.
00:02:56.722 - 00:03:13.882, Speaker B: Different parents. Different parents. So my next oldest brother was eight but between them there was like twelve years. So they were stack, stack, stack, stack. So I both grew up in a house where early years it was packed, later years was just by myself.
00:03:14.016 - 00:03:14.314, Speaker A: Wow.
00:03:14.352 - 00:03:42.930, Speaker B: It's fascinating. But in many ways I was brought up as their hope. We went through the 80s together. It was a challenging time. Yeah. My brothers made decisions based on the circumstances at that time, but I was always seen as someone that could do more. And I just have always appreciated that about them because they told me first that I was somebody right before I even knew how important that was.
00:03:42.930 - 00:03:49.382, Speaker B: They told me that I was somebody and I believed them. I believe I could do things and I went off, was able to accomplish a few stuff.
00:03:49.436 - 00:03:52.610, Speaker A: So you went to college where? In Texas?
00:03:52.690 - 00:04:08.538, Speaker B: Yeah. I first went to southeast Oklahoma as a scholarship athlete. Quickly realized that that wasn't for me. I started to kind of shift kind of my priorities a little bit. I was into social justice. I went. And then.
00:04:08.624 - 00:04:10.966, Speaker A: So, you know, early on you wanted to be in social justice.
00:04:11.078 - 00:04:31.986, Speaker B: Yeah. No, I did. Because in the. Talked about the 80s, in the 90s, what started to happen? I started to lose friends. Friends to violence. My best friend in the entire world, the guy that encouraged me to go talk to girls, taught me how to crease my pants. I got that phone call and he was taken away from us.
00:04:31.986 - 00:04:40.854, Speaker B: And it was at his funeral that I committed myself that I was going to do something about society, about our community, to make sure my.
00:04:40.892 - 00:04:42.354, Speaker A: You were what, 1817?
00:04:42.482 - 00:04:59.366, Speaker B: I was 19. I was 19 when that happened. And it changed everything. Yeah. So it was that commitment that pushed me to want to get involved in social justice. I went to Prairie v M University in Houston, Texas. HBCU.
00:04:59.366 - 00:05:03.994, Speaker B: Loved it. Best experience of my life. Then went on to graduate school in Connecticut.
00:05:04.042 - 00:05:06.720, Speaker A: And your first job in social justice was where?
00:05:07.330 - 00:05:20.478, Speaker B: It was at a place called Upper Albany Neighborhood collaborative in Hartford, Connecticut. I was a community was. I was given a list of names on a sheet of paper and addresses and I was told to go talk to these people. So I was knocking on doors.
00:05:20.574 - 00:05:30.018, Speaker A: Explain. It sounds dumb because you've grown up in that world, but I'm guessing most of the people on my podcast don't even know what a community organizer does. Hear about community organizers.
00:05:30.034 - 00:05:30.534, Speaker B: No, you don't.
00:05:30.572 - 00:05:32.150, Speaker A: What does a community organizer do?
00:05:32.220 - 00:06:11.540, Speaker B: You don't hear about. But the most famous community organizer was Barack Obama. And I was so happy when he was talking about his early years as an organizer and how it shaped him. So I think you're right. That's the first time people ever even heard that as a field. So basically, I was given the charge to identify issues in the community for people to work on, to address, to solve. But it's not so easy, right? You have to talk to people, find out what those issues are, and then you have to convince them it's in their best interest to get with other people, because you don't make things happen as an individual.
00:06:11.540 - 00:06:43.514, Speaker B: You make things happen when you're part of a collective. So then there's trust. You have to build both trust between you and them, and then trust with each other, and then you have to be on the same plan on how you're going to make change happen, and then you execute. And so early on, I was 22, 23, knocking on doors, talking to people. My first campaign, first major campaign, had to do with sewage in people's basement in upper Albany. So every time it ran, it rained. Sewage would run through people's basement, and it was horrible.
00:06:43.514 - 00:06:54.822, Speaker B: So we organized a massive meeting and bus tour and was able to get on the ballot of resources to change the sewer system up Albany. Harford.
00:06:54.986 - 00:07:17.190, Speaker A: Not to get off track, but I saw a special on TV. My son's doing a dot. It's shocking how prevalent the problem of shit in people's yards or houses, or if it's pig shit in the waste farms down in North Carolina, or if know, just poor sewage systems in places that are low for sea.
00:07:18.430 - 00:07:19.370, Speaker B: It's.
00:07:20.110 - 00:07:22.870, Speaker A: You sometimes wonder what the hell's going on in America.
00:07:22.950 - 00:07:57.442, Speaker B: Well, I mean, that's the thing. It's that if these local governments don't respond right, people will talk about what's happening all day, but if they don't put resources on the table, things continue to decay and people die, like we saw in flint during the water system. I mean, that's happening all throughout the Midwest and Northeast and these older communities. So, yeah, it's definitely a problem, but it's important for people to organize, come together, make a demand, and hold people accountable to get those things changed.
00:07:57.506 - 00:08:09.082, Speaker A: And so it's from a young age you started, and then job after job, the prison reform, criminal justice reform. When did this start?
00:08:09.136 - 00:08:41.410, Speaker B: Yeah, it started around the same time. I was 22, 23. The next thing after the sewage problem was public safety, right? It was open air, drug, drug dealing, and people in the community was upset and frustrated. We had moms that said they couldn't let their kids go outside and play because of what was happening. And so we again came together and started to hold people accountable. People got arrested. I was part of a campaign that resulted in people getting arrested because that's what the community wanted.
00:08:41.410 - 00:09:16.000, Speaker B: But that's when I learned that the criminal justice system actually did more harm than good. We cleaned up, quote unquote, cleaned up that neighborhood. But then seven days later, I remember knocking on doors, talking to people, hey, how things are going? They were saying, did you hear about the shooting that happened last night? What shooting? At the fish market? Yeah, at the fish market. There was a shooting. So what happened is that by the people that were doing the open air drug market, by them being arrested, it created competition in that community. Right. And so people started competing for that market.
00:09:16.000 - 00:09:46.546, Speaker B: And so we thought we were making things better, Mike. We actually was making things worse. And that's when I know the war on drugs was a failure, and I wanted to be on the side of things and change. So it was 23 years old. I became the executive director of the Better Way foundation, which is a criminal justice reform organization aligned with Drug policy Alliance. And we were working to advance harm reduction strategies because I didn't want to be part of the problem. I want to be part of the solution.
00:09:46.658 - 00:10:25.898, Speaker A: So you fast forward. It's February 2022. We're in a world now where, in my mind, criminal justice has been set back pretty substantially. Criminal justice reform has been set back substantially because there's a perception and a reality that our cities feel less safe. And a lot of people are blaming that on criminal justice reform. I think that's unfair, but it's funny because it resonates. Your first instinct was we got to make people feel safe before we can make reform, and then we need to make smart reforms.
00:10:25.898 - 00:11:23.110, Speaker A: And so talk a little bit about how you're helping kind of steer the ship at both the reform alliance, but know you've got a big presence in the whole space. We've got this space where we had so much momentum, and it accelerated the, the tragedy of George Floyd. And I think that the bulk of Americans saw George Floyd and said, this guy just got murdered in front of us. This can't be. And the willingness to believe that we had a race problem in America, that we had a criminal justice problem in America was wide open, and we never had better momentum. We were making progress on all kinds of fronts, and that all kind of got stuffed with a little bit of defund the police and people like, actually, I don't want to feel unsafe. I want police.
00:11:23.110 - 00:11:41.086, Speaker A: And the rise in violent crime in major cities, both cities that had reform and cities that didn't have reform. Right. Both red and blue cities. Right. But it puts the space in a pretty weird position now. And so how are you trying to think about that?
00:11:41.188 - 00:12:03.410, Speaker B: So this conversation isn't new to many of us that's been doing the work for a while. I think it's new for folks that have come in, like you said, since Floyd, we've been wanting to center public safety and solutions to public safety for a long time. Like I told you my story back when I was 22.
00:12:03.480 - 00:12:03.762, Speaker A: Right?
00:12:03.816 - 00:12:36.650, Speaker B: That was 23 years ago. That's what I was trying to find was that middle ground. And we saw the middle ground in terms of growing kind of alternatives to incarcerate. The language has changed throughout the years. Right. Alternatives to incarceration or substance abuse treatment instead of incarceration or alternative to probation. We've seen different iterations of it, but it was all our attempt to grow alternatives to locking people up and meeting the root causes of crime.
00:12:36.650 - 00:13:11.322, Speaker B: Right. It's just that it was a small number of us that was talking about it and doing it, and we've been successful at just reform. Prop 47 actually moved significant dollars from the criminal justice system into communities all across California and invested in new programs that actually help people. We've seen kind of those types of shifts, but not at the scale that we needed to see across the country. So then COVID hits, right. And what I mean by that is we are isolated for 18 months, two years. Terrible, right.
00:13:11.322 - 00:13:34.306, Speaker B: It has significant impact on us as a community, on individuals and also mental health. And we also saw tremendous spikes in purchasing of guns during that same time period. Right. So there was this unsettling that was happening. And then lastly, people were poor. People are poor, right. People need things.
00:13:34.306 - 00:14:03.740, Speaker B: And the combination of all of that, and I'm sure some other things as well, created a perfect storm of sorts that resulted in increase in violent crime in many places. And we in the criminal justice reform field was not ready for that. We was not ready with scaled up solutions to those issues. Many of us been talking about it. We've done it at a smaller scale. We needed better solutions, more available solutions to us than we didn't have it.
00:14:05.150 - 00:14:16.730, Speaker A: Because it's wildly important to me, how do we address public safety without turning back the clock, six years, ten years on criminal justice?
00:14:16.810 - 00:14:45.906, Speaker B: We can't. First of all, I think it's important for people to know that we're not going to turn back the clock. We as a movement, as a field are at the table in ways that we're not at the table in the, when this system got built. Like we're not going to allow that to happen. Sure, there'll be shifts, right? But it'll be a full public discourse and debate every single time. And the nature of that will allow us to be able to move kind of in the center as opposed to it being a radical shift left and right. So that's just my belief.
00:14:45.906 - 00:14:46.854, Speaker B: We'll see.
00:14:47.052 - 00:15:12.682, Speaker A: I actually think you're right. I think you're right. I think there is a, from when I got into criminal justice five years ago or four and a half years ago to now, the amount of people involved, money involved, intellectual capital engaged, is limit up. And so I don't think that group is going to fall for the false flag of throw everyone in jail and lock them up forever. It doesn't make communities safer.
00:15:12.746 - 00:15:30.146, Speaker B: We just have to grow the solutions. We got to grow the alternative. We wanted reform. We were able to get reform in many places. Now we're stakeholders in the system now, whether we like it or not. Many of us start off as advocates marching. But once you get reform and make reform happen, you're now a stakeholder.
00:15:30.146 - 00:15:48.790, Speaker B: So you need to ensure that that reform is implemented in the way it was intended. Right. So that means you're sitting at the table with law enforcement, with people in government, with elected to ensure that that happens. That's where we are now. Right. And we need to grow that body of work in our field and grow those solutions.
00:15:48.870 - 00:15:55.374, Speaker A: Let's talk a little bit about reform alliance. Yeah, you're the main man there for what, less than a year now?
00:15:55.572 - 00:15:58.398, Speaker B: Yeah, it will be a year at the end of this month.
00:15:58.484 - 00:16:23.880, Speaker A: Got it. So one year in reform alliance for you guys. Don't know is a partnership that was started by Meek Mill and Michael Rubin with kind of a celebrity cast of people that cared about the issue. From Clara Psy and Jay Z. Clara would love to be seen before Jay Z, Bob Kraft, who else? Myself.
00:16:25.690 - 00:16:26.502, Speaker B: Priscilla Chan.
00:16:26.556 - 00:17:04.542, Speaker A: Priscilla Chan and Laura Arnold. The women on our team seem to know a lot more than the men, I'd hate to say, but wickedly smart group with lots of resource and a lot of commitment to really attack probation and parole. There are four and a half million people stuck in the probation parole system. My intuition, having looked at it now for a few years, is that it's a stupid system. It doesn't really help anybody, and it's not even that political an idea. It's not like bail, which is very charged. It's kind of a lost.
00:17:04.542 - 00:17:15.666, Speaker A: People don't even think much about it. Yet we have four and a half million people whose lives are wildly impacted. And so talk a little bit about coming into that group and what the plans are and how we're going to make impact.
00:17:15.778 - 00:17:57.010, Speaker B: Yeah. First of all, I'm living the dream. I love it at reform. It was a fascinating operation when it first got established with all the names, like you just mentioned, connected to Van Jones did a great job of getting reform off the ground. He brought together a stellar team. And what compelled me to want to get involved in reform was meeting each one of the board members in the interview process. And during that process, what I heard was something I really hadn't heard before in our space.
00:17:57.010 - 00:18:30.474, Speaker B: And that was a group of people with influence saying, what happened to that young man shouldn't happen to him or anyone else. Right. And that was powerful to me as a father of three black boys, that that amount of resources was put together on behalf of Meek to say that, no, this is unacceptable America. And that pulled me in like that pulled me in. The conversations with each one of you felt real, they felt sincere. You guys wanted to make something happen. It wasn't just a figurehead board, it was a board that you, board that really wanted action.
00:18:30.474 - 00:18:53.154, Speaker B: And so I was all for it. And so I'm so glad that I joined. Coming into reform, reform had had significant successes early on passing laws in states across the country. That work will continue. Right. We're going to engage at the state, and then soon the federal level. We're going to work to change laws.
00:18:53.154 - 00:19:04.726, Speaker B: We're going to ensure that those laws are implemented correctly. And when I say laws, I'm specifically talking about laws to transform probation and parole, like how they currently operate.
00:19:04.838 - 00:19:18.810, Speaker A: Let's take people through some of know meek was on parole for nine years and might have been on forever. So part of its duration, how long you can be on parole.
00:19:18.890 - 00:19:39.950, Speaker B: Yeah, there's some states, like in Pennsylvania, where you can theoretically get lifetime probation. And that's a problem. It's basically turned into a giant bureaucracy. It's not trying to solve a problem. It's not trying to get people to be more stable. It's not trying to help just.
00:19:40.120 - 00:20:08.778, Speaker A: We met one young woman from Philadelphia whose parole officer had her arrested for missing a parole meeting while she was being given an award for good behavior by the mayor. And you're like, that could not have happened. But it did happen. And so the system is so bureaucratic, it literally feels like it's a group of people putting marbles in front of guys that are barely surviving anyway and hoping they trip and then throwing them back in jail.
00:20:08.874 - 00:20:45.882, Speaker B: But here's what we've also learned. Just like we have states like Pennsylvania, we also have states like Massachusetts and California, which is really on the other end of the continuum. State of Massachusetts ten years ago had the highest racial disparities in revocation. My team and I and Mr. Craft pulled together a meeting of all the major law enforcement leaders in Massachusetts to learn what they've done over the last ten years because they have put themselves in a position where only 24 people are in prison. This entire state of Massachusetts on revocation. It's kind of an extraordinary number, if you think about it.
00:20:45.936 - 00:20:48.218, Speaker A: That's shocking. Tell people what revocation is.
00:20:48.304 - 00:21:04.462, Speaker B: So that's basically, if you're on probation, that means you've agreed to certain stipulations for your probation. You have to show up to a meeting. You have to maybe live in a certain jurisdiction. You can't go out that jurisdiction. Maybe have to pay fines. There's certain stipulations you have to write.
00:21:04.516 - 00:21:06.802, Speaker A: You get a parole officer who sets rules for you.
00:21:06.856 - 00:21:07.266, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:21:07.368 - 00:21:32.486, Speaker A: And if you break the rules, you go back to jail. Some of the rules are silly. If you get a speeding ticket or a parking ticket, you can go back to jail. I talked to one guy who said the PO said he can't live with his mom because she has a dog. I said, was it pit bull? He said, no, it was a puppy. But the PO just didn't want him to. And so some seem absurd, some probably have some logic to them.
00:21:32.588 - 00:21:47.678, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, most don't have logic to them. That's the problem. It should be tied to whatever the offense was. Right. But they're not. They have these blanket stipulations, these rules, and then you have to live your life the best way you can. Basically, you need a community.
00:21:47.678 - 00:21:59.086, Speaker B: You need a family that's going to subsidize you when you're on probation and parole. It's not just you being on probation. Everyone around you is on probation and parole. And that's the problem with it. Shouldn't be that way. Probation should help facilitate.
00:21:59.118 - 00:22:01.602, Speaker A: So how does Massachusetts only have six people?
00:22:01.656 - 00:22:42.958, Speaker B: Yeah, 24. So a couple of things that they did, they moved the revocation decision up a couple of levels. So the probation officer isn't the one making the decision, which is great. And we see a lot of states doing that. They also had universal health care. That means that they can move people that need help into some form of substance abuse or mental health facility and get that billed, and that's not available in many other places. What I've been hearing is that many probation officers aren't trying to revoke to send someone to jail just because they believe that's where they should be.
00:22:42.958 - 00:23:29.760, Speaker B: They may have someone to come up with dirty urine who has a history of addiction in a town where people are overdosing and they feel that that's the place for them, so they revoke. Whether or not that's the right move, we can decide, but you can see the logic. So how can you build the infrastructure where that person can go to a facility as opposed to a prison? So that's what Massachusetts has done, and it's been extraordinary to see what they're doing there. California, county by county, is totally different. In El Dorado county, for example, they realized that a large number of their probationers were homeless. So they took their resources, they bought a house, and they allowed their probationists to live and run that house. Really extraordinary stuff.
00:23:29.760 - 00:23:59.002, Speaker B: In Alameda county, they saw that a lot of revocations were connected to substance abuse, and so they paid for substance abuse treatment for people a year after they left probation, a year after. That means they really didn't have to. Right. But they took some ab, $109, and they invested in people. And so we're seeing innovation on some end. But then there are states like Pennsylvania and Georgia. Georgia is getting better.
00:23:59.002 - 00:24:46.146, Speaker B: We were able to pass a law in Georgia that allows for people to get off probation earlier. But, yeah, we still have some deeply problematic states. Minnesota, Indiana. It's a problem. But I said that. All to say, the reason I want to bring up Massachusetts, California is I think there are roadmaps to this. Right? Like, if we continue to increase our resources from an advertising standpoint, move money out to the field where there are groups on the ground that are making the same demands as we are as a national advocacy organization, help local counties identify resources in their budgets to fund some of these alternatives, I think we can continue to see a dramatic shift.
00:24:46.146 - 00:24:55.542, Speaker B: There are 276,000 less people on probation than they were into 2020. A lot of had to do with COVID but that's significant, substantial.
00:24:55.686 - 00:25:23.902, Speaker A: When you talk to someone on probation and their life sucks, and they feel liberated the moment they're off 100%. And as you said, it's their whole family. So just, I want to put some numbers to the audience together just so you get a sense of the scope of our criminal justice system. Right. Every year, we have between ten and 11 million people that enter jail. Ten and 11 million people at any one night. There's about 500,000 people waiting for bail in jail.
00:25:23.902 - 00:25:50.278, Speaker A: Jail is one year and under, and there's about 1.8 million people in prison. So you got 2.32.4 million people incarcerated every single day. But that's a revolving door that people average 49 days for 50 days in jail. And so you've got this machine. And so Robert has been doing his whole life, I've five years, trying to figure out how to try to help the system a lot.
00:25:50.278 - 00:25:58.762, Speaker A: What I've come to the conclusion with is the criminal justice reform movement needs to be clearer about the solutions.
00:25:58.826 - 00:25:59.390, Speaker B: Yes.
00:25:59.540 - 00:26:39.980, Speaker A: We've all, I think, proven to the american people that it's a broken system, it's a stupid system, it's an inhumane system, it's a racially prejudiced system. And I think if you had a vote, people would say, yes, criminal justice system sucks. It's a D minus or an F. But the alternatives, and I think you've hit on a few within the space. But I just want people to understand the magnitude of the numbers of human bodies that are moving through and the money that's made. And you've got prison guards and prison guard unions, police unions. And so it's a huge part of the economy, which also makes it harder to change.
00:26:39.980 - 00:26:43.046, Speaker A: That wasn't even a question. That was just me waxing.
00:26:43.078 - 00:26:44.870, Speaker B: No, I loved it because it was right on.
00:26:44.960 - 00:27:10.280, Speaker A: It's a big, big problem. It drives me insane. You've given us a little bit of optimism, given me a little bit more optimism on the movement itself. Right. We're in this stalled space, as you said. We now have a position at the table. At least Biden has been mediocre at best, I'd say, on criminal justice reform, it's not his thing.
00:27:10.280 - 00:27:23.210, Speaker A: Kamala has been quiet. I would have hoped it would have been her thing. She had something to make up for because she'd been a pretty tough prosecutor. And so you thought she might pivot, but hasn't. And so who are our allies?
00:27:23.630 - 00:28:03.206, Speaker B: Well, I want to start with folks on the ground in the communities. Right. There's a guy by name, Akila Shirerells. He ran Newark Community street team, came in with Mayor Baraka, became, you know, has been, know, interventionist programs in Newark for the last, what, five, six years? Crime rates have continued to drop. He's done it in partnership with law enforcement, meaning pieces of law enforcement budget was shifted over to his team, and he was able to hire up. And he's been doing amazing work. There are folks like Akilah all across the country, a, we don't know who.
00:28:03.228 - 00:28:08.886, Speaker A: They all are that was going to get funded in build back better, which is now dead, which would have been wonderful.
00:28:08.998 - 00:28:35.120, Speaker B: Yeah, well, yes, of course. But the point that I'm making is that there are people in communities doing this work. We need to ensure that they get scaled up. The build back better was a huge part of that. But I don't want to let the local cities and counties off the hook. They can do exactly what Baraka did. He moved money to Aquila, and Akila was able to grow his team.
00:28:35.120 - 00:29:22.798, Speaker B: And during was, they bought groceries and they would go house to house to check on people, make sure folks were okay. I don't want to kind of overlook the importance of grassroots organizers that are working communities each and every day to solve problems. It's just that the conversation around crime has gotten so politicized so quickly, those folks aren't even being considered or discussed. And so I think part of what our job is to highlight is to highlight that, elevate that at the highest level. Hey, there are good people in these communities that's doing great work, that's addressing this issue. And let's be clear. Violent crime is up.
00:29:22.798 - 00:29:33.234, Speaker B: It's still at a historic low. Right. It's still historically. And so that means that there are certain things happening in communities, and we need to understand all of them.
00:29:33.272 - 00:29:44.278, Speaker A: Yeah. We need to do a better job of storytelling. Even bail. Like bail reform here in New York is under a huge attack. When you look at the numbers, 98% of the people that got bailed out haven't done anything.
00:29:44.364 - 00:29:44.614, Speaker B: Right.
00:29:44.652 - 00:30:28.742, Speaker A: So you have a very small amount of people. And so 98% of the people you're actually putting back into their houses, making the community safer, actually. And so, again, did the law get written in a way that doesn't pass the common sense test? Yeah. Right. A guy that's on his 7th crime in two months, you probably should say, keep that guy in, or someone who's done something really horrific. But there's also a lot of bad press, right? This young kid recently who shot at cops, who got bailed out, who's upset about. He had this $50,000 bail, and he paid his bail in the same way Robert Durst paid his bail when he murdered someone.
00:30:28.742 - 00:30:41.862, Speaker A: And no one, like, screamed and yelled. And so figuring out who really is a danger to society and where that line is, it should be a pretty high bar, but there should be a bar somewhere.
00:30:41.926 - 00:31:10.046, Speaker B: But see, this is the problem is that current criminal justice spends so much money trying to manage people, that just shouldn't be in the system at all. Right? And if we actually took those resources, either reinvested them or moved them in areas that help us solve. Because in these same communities, the murder closure rate is ridiculous. Meaning we're not closing.
00:31:10.078 - 00:31:11.570, Speaker A: Yeah, we're not closing these crime rates.
00:31:12.150 - 00:31:34.070, Speaker B: Right, exactly. The rape closure rate, that's the other thing we can do. We can actually take sexual assault seriously. Right? We don't, in terms of the justice system. So there are things that need to happen. We need to readjust these budgets. We need to invest in programs like Newark community street team, and then we'll see better results.
00:31:34.070 - 00:31:37.178, Speaker B: Until then, we need a communications know.
00:31:37.184 - 00:31:49.502, Speaker A: Eric Adams, to his credit, he tells that story all the time. We said we got to not try to pluck kids out of the river. We got to stop putting them in the river upstream. And I think that's investing. Exactly like you said.
00:31:49.556 - 00:31:51.934, Speaker B: Yeah, prevention, all of it.
00:31:52.132 - 00:32:24.834, Speaker A: All right, well, listen, I hope sunnier days are ahead. I actually have a feeling that we're in for a grind here a little bit in criminal justice. Luckily, I'm a wrestler and a grinder, and most of the people I've met in here, the guys that work at galaxy, the guys work at reform, are pretty tough and are grinders. The political narrative in our country is divided. It's funny, when I sit down with people, it's not nearly as bad as what I read, right. Everyone wants people to be treated justly, and people want to feel safe.
00:32:24.962 - 00:32:28.786, Speaker B: If it bleeds, it leads. Yeah, still true, unfortunately.
00:32:28.978 - 00:32:33.262, Speaker A: All right, Robert, listen, I really appreciate you coming in. It's been fun talking with you.
00:32:33.316 - 00:32:33.822, Speaker B: Same here.
00:32:33.876 - 00:32:40.940, Speaker A: We will try to keep all you guys focused on helping us fix the criminal justice system.
