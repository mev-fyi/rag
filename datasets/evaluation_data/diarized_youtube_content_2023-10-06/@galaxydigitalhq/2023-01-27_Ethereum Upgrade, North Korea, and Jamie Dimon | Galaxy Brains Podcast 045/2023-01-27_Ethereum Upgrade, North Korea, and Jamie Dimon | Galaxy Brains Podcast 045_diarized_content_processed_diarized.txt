00:00:07.960 - 00:00:58.362, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. Yo, this beat works for me to speak words in black t shirts. We never reverse see me always pressing forward the price was feeling low but now we're heading northward we glow up, never slow up see me throw down in a roll up we turn the soul up and you know us a funky little beat is the only place I'll blow up and every day's gift so you know we always show up Galaxy brains, as always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firm wide research at Galaxy Digital. Thank you so much for joining us this week. We have a great show. We're talking with Christine Kim from Galaxy Research about a whole host of things. She's back from a little hiatus from the show to tell us about Ethereum upgrades and the adoption of MeV Boost on Ethereum, which is a really interesting story in the ecosystem.
00:00:58.362 - 00:01:38.182, Speaker A: And we're going to talk with her about a whole bunch of other interesting news topics that have happened, the FBI and North Korea, some regulatory stuff, Jamie Dimon's comments about bitcoin at the World Economic Forum. And we're going to talk, of course, as always, with our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading about markets and macro. But before we begin, I need to tell you to please refer to the link to the disclaimer on the podcast notes and note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or a recommendation, offer, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Let's get right into the show. Welcome my friend Bimnet, a BB from Galaxy Digital trading. As always, how are you doing? Good.
00:01:38.238 - 00:01:38.862, Speaker B: How are you doing?
00:01:38.918 - 00:01:57.766, Speaker A: I'm good. It's good to see you. It's a little bit of a quiet week, I guess. I mean, after last week, certainly in crypto, which was a material uplift in prices. Now we're sort of sideways at these levels. Viewers of our YouTube channel, which we are on video, if you only listen on audio, worth checking us out on video occasionally.
00:01:57.790 - 00:02:00.394, Speaker B: I've always thought I've had a face for podcasts.
00:02:01.414 - 00:02:11.314, Speaker A: Viewers will see the block clock next to me, which shows that we're at about 22 six on bitcoin. So we're still up where we were, but a little quiet. Anything you're paying attention to in particular this week?
00:02:12.654 - 00:02:48.614, Speaker B: Yeah, a couple of things with respect to crypto. One of the things is CME activity. So we've seen a pretty material jump in open interest on CME, bitcoin and I think ETH futures as well, and I think that's a sign of growing sort of institutional adoption. In addition, it's a sign that folks are still not comfortable with credit risk in the space. Right. People want to buy bitcoin without facing counterparty risk or without having counterparty risk. And obviously the CME is a gold standard.
00:02:48.614 - 00:03:08.294, Speaker B: I think the growing importance of CME futures tells you that this asset class has a place in institutional portfolios. In addition, the guys that have been buying the stuff on CME, they've been paying a premium to spot.
00:03:10.314 - 00:03:11.162, Speaker A: It shows demand.
00:03:11.258 - 00:03:49.568, Speaker B: It shows pretty strong demand. So I think that's been super notable. Interesting. I also have been paying attention to gold in traditional markets. It's basically at trend highs, trading around 1935. And I think that's partially a function of strong seasonals and weak dollar, et cetera. But if we're to view bitcoin as something that's similar to digital gold, I think that kind of price action and physical gold bodes very well for bitcoin.
00:03:49.568 - 00:04:00.984, Speaker B: And I think if you get a break above 2000 on gold, there's going to be a lot of folks that are going to be like, oh, should I miss this? Or is this a big breakout?
00:04:01.064 - 00:04:01.928, Speaker A: Should I be buying gold?
00:04:01.976 - 00:04:14.704, Speaker B: Should I be buying gold? And then the natural question like, do I buy gold or do I buy digital gold? And so I definitely think that's a powerful narrative that a lot of folks aren't necessarily paying attention to.
00:04:14.784 - 00:04:16.840, Speaker A: Yeah, you love that bitcoin gold chart, the cross.
00:04:16.872 - 00:04:41.367, Speaker B: I love that chart. Yeah, it bottomed kind of where you'd expect it to. It's now trading at around a ratio of like eleven and it's got plenty of room to go higher. And so personally, I love being short gold versus long bitcoin. I think that gives you a really nice risk profile. It looks really good on the chart. It's got a good story to it.
00:04:41.415 - 00:04:44.575, Speaker A: Yeah, it does. It's an interesting long term bitcoin narrative as well.
00:04:44.679 - 00:05:36.128, Speaker B: Yeah, no, absolutely. And then in terms of other things we're paying attention to, I think more than ever it's really important to be honest about the data that's coming in from the market. The market's kind of gotten ahead of itself with respect to inflation expectations that have come down a lot, bond yields that have moved a lot lower, et cetera. And so I'm very focused on data points that suggest that we're going back the other way in terms of inflation or, or activity. So there have been a couple of surprises to the upside recently, not that the market is paying attention, but like, the NIHB home builder survey came out a little stronger than expected. We had us services and US manufacturing. Pmis come in stronger than expected.
00:05:36.128 - 00:05:44.720, Speaker B: Yesterday you also had a drop in initial jobless claims. So there's like, in the past week or so, you've had pretty strong.
00:05:44.832 - 00:05:46.616, Speaker A: These are like potentially inflationary.
00:05:46.680 - 00:06:09.072, Speaker B: Potentially inflationary. Or like, like hire for longer suggestive things. And I think fundamentally, I'm looking at bonds and I'm like, these things are not pricing in inflation risk. It's almost like you took away that inflation risk. And guys, we have one of the tightest labor markets in history. Stocks are fine. Consumer sentiment is fine.
00:06:09.072 - 00:06:36.152, Speaker B: People are getting raises like crazy. I mean, Walmart raises, fucking Social Security. Sorry, Social Security raises. That went effect at the start of the year. 60 million people get those cost of living adjustments, and you have China reopening. It's not, Europe isn't going to go through one of the worst winters or recessions in history. Things are starting to look good there, and God forbid the commodities start ripping again.
00:06:36.152 - 00:07:14.736, Speaker B: And so I think the market is totally underappreciating inflation risks. And I think that's a function of, or a huge part of it is just how much cash was created over the past handful of years. It's like, okay, bond yields really depressed. Cause we printed like $5 trillion of money. And so maybe they're not reflecting the true risks because it needs to find a home, et cetera. And so there's a lot of neat, interesting things going on. And that's kind of what I'm paying attention to on the macro side, on the micro, more crypto focused side of things.
00:07:14.736 - 00:07:24.428, Speaker B: I mean, you've just had such insane moves and a handful of these. All I know, one in particular that makes no sense to me is apdos right now.
00:07:24.476 - 00:07:25.476, Speaker A: Is that even a thing yet?
00:07:25.540 - 00:07:26.580, Speaker B: Nope, not a thing.
00:07:26.652 - 00:07:28.108, Speaker A: It doesn't. Has it launched?
00:07:28.156 - 00:07:40.092, Speaker B: I mean, I mean, maybe, maybe not. Honestly, I don't know anybody that's an actual user of aptos. I don't know what wallet like you would need. I don't think there's only a handful of developers that code in whatever coins.
00:07:40.148 - 00:07:42.932, Speaker A: Are in the market right now. It's got to be extremely illiquid if there are any.
00:07:42.988 - 00:08:02.384, Speaker B: Float is very limited, but right now, fully diluted. The thing's worth $17 billion, which is just crazy. And I can't tell you a single person that uses it. It doesn't have a stable coin. There's not that many developers on it. My question is, has this market not learned its lesson? What is going on? That we have a token that's appreciated.
00:08:02.844 - 00:08:03.876, Speaker A: There's got to be a reversion.
00:08:03.900 - 00:08:19.620, Speaker B: There should revert. But Milton Friedman has a great saying. The market can stay solvent longer than the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. That's really what constantly comes to mind in irrational markets.
00:08:19.652 - 00:08:27.460, Speaker A: I love that the Fed comes out next week with their FOMC meeting. Happens next week, I should say.
00:08:27.492 - 00:08:28.772, Speaker B: Correct. With their rate decision.
00:08:28.868 - 00:08:42.884, Speaker A: Yeah. Along with what you were saying about the market kind of underappreciating the inflation risk. Right. I mean, the market's also currently pricing like less than 5% terminal rate here, right?
00:08:42.924 - 00:08:54.276, Speaker B: Yeah, around 493 basis points. Terminal rates. You have around 25 basis points priced for this meeting and a little less than 25 priced for the next.
00:08:54.340 - 00:09:02.246, Speaker A: And what we did 50 last meeting. So, like the market is expecting a further decline of the hike magnitude.
00:09:02.310 - 00:09:03.190, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely.
00:09:03.262 - 00:09:16.014, Speaker A: You think if you had to guess, I mean, is that going to happen? I mean, wouldn't it, don't you think part of what, you know, Powell and the Fed governors want is to really tamp this thing down? I've heard some recently hawkish statements from some Fed members. Right.
00:09:16.054 - 00:09:18.142, Speaker B: I mean, all the Fed speak has been hawkish.
00:09:18.198 - 00:09:18.414, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:18.454 - 00:09:19.230, Speaker B: So like, yeah.
00:09:19.342 - 00:09:39.398, Speaker A: Would an upside surprise here help them with their narrative to get the market, like in line here to make sure? Because as you've said multiple times, the worst case scenario scenario is that they slow the magnitude and sort of become a little bit more dovish and then inflation rears its head again and they have to like go right back. That's what happened in the seventies a bunch.
00:09:39.486 - 00:10:33.382, Speaker B: Yeah, I totally agree. I think the Fed this year or over the past year has been very intelligent about how they've used the meeting to push markets. And so typically, like when you want the greatest bang for your buck, you surprise the market. And so doing a lot and surprising the market gets you a better impact than communicating it and doing it gradually. And so the Fed was very effective this year over the past year of over delivering and being more hawkish. Now, at this point, though, you've had three consecutive inflation prints that have come down clearly. It looks like you've topped out and some of the manufacturing surveys have really moved a lot lower.
00:10:33.382 - 00:11:02.864, Speaker B: So the data backdrop is one that allows the Fed to just do the 25 and communicate probably another 25 down the line and with potential for more. And that will kind of leave things as is you're meeting expectations. The point is, I don't think there's really that much of an incentive for them to surprise and shock the market given that the data profile has softened.
00:11:02.984 - 00:11:05.896, Speaker A: So really they're starting to see the data they would want to see.
00:11:06.000 - 00:11:48.102, Speaker B: They are. They are. And they've gotten a lot smarter in the sense that why they missed it was because they weren't, why they missed inflation really taking off was because they weren't using some of the anecdotal data or some of the soft data as heavily or the high frequency things as heavily. Like they've come out with like a new rent index that they're using. They'll look at like more active data series and they'll rely more on like soft data and anecdotal data. And so they're a lot more progressive. And they see the writing on the wall, which is rents are starting to cool, right? Like used auto prices have come down, home prices have come down.
00:11:48.102 - 00:11:57.498, Speaker B: Like there's a lot of things that suggest that prices are cooling. And so there's really not a need for them to surprise, I think.
00:11:57.586 - 00:12:09.866, Speaker A: Interesting. All right, our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. Great to see you as always, my friend. Let's go to our friend Christine Kim. Welcome back. I haven't seen you on galaxy brains in maybe like a month and a half. How are you?
00:12:09.890 - 00:12:19.202, Speaker C: I know, it's crazy. Thanks for having me back, as always. Yeah, well, I mean, I see you around in the office every day, so it's funny, like being back on the podcast, but like, you know, but there.
00:12:19.218 - 00:12:22.554, Speaker A: Were the holidays and then we had a bunch of guests on at the end of the year.
00:12:22.594 - 00:12:23.414, Speaker C: So we did.
00:12:24.614 - 00:12:45.694, Speaker A: But I'm really excited because we got a bunch of fun topics to talk about. I think we're going to start with Ethereum, as is probably no surprise to our guest. I think one of the biggest things in Ethereum's roadmap or the things to watch in Ethereum is Shanghai, the next upgrade, which is going to bring state withdrawals. What's the current update on this upgrade?
00:12:45.734 - 00:13:52.074, Speaker C: Shanghai, well, mainly that Shanghai, the only thing really going into Shanghai is state ETH withdrawals. There was so much discussion before the end of the year of like, can we include scalability upgrades on this? Can we include EVM upgrades in Shanghai? And really when all the developers were back from vacation, like the holiday break, they all came to consensus around, we're really going to make Shanghai as small as possible, which is why right now, in recent weeks, testing for the upgrade has really been fast tracked because there's not too much to test. The other eips outside of state youth withdrawals that's going into Shanghai are really minor ones and that won't have a ton of impact on the end user or the infrastructure of the network itself. So yeah, they recently, this week I believe launched their first mainnet shadow fork for Shanghai, which basically means that they replicated the state of Ethereum today and then tested out like the Shanghai.
00:13:52.534 - 00:14:02.772, Speaker A: So not just a testnet but literally a testnet with the state up to like literally all the apps, all the transaction history, all the smart contracts. Yeah, that's nice.
00:14:02.868 - 00:14:14.172, Speaker C: So I think we're close. I think that target of March for Shanghai is looking very likely, which is surprising to me because I had thought after the merge we're gonna see delays and so on.
00:14:14.188 - 00:14:19.372, Speaker A: I mean it was one of the few concepts in life you got death, you got taxes and you got delays to Ethereum upgrades.
00:14:19.428 - 00:14:19.988, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:14:20.076 - 00:14:53.656, Speaker A: But that's really impressive first of all. And we talked I think on a prior episode about how the pressure on the developers to actually just really get staked ETH withdrawals to really prioritize that because of criticism that they've been facing and also just demands from users and how other developers with more substantive, or I should say more innovative upgrades were upset by this because they want to actually build features and not just, I think this is the right move. I think you need to actually finish the merge.
00:14:53.800 - 00:14:54.548, Speaker C: Right.
00:14:54.736 - 00:15:00.604, Speaker A: And then move on to these other things. That's just my opinion. But very bullish on them. Moving quickly though.
00:15:00.684 - 00:15:18.852, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean it really affirms that developers don't work in this black box setting where they're only thinking about what's the best for the network. They really are subject and kind of impacted by what's happening on Twitter, the conversation that's happening on social media.
00:15:18.908 - 00:15:45.186, Speaker A: It's really an interesting discussion. It's probably a bigger one than we would have today, but just in how the layer ones, particularly bitcoin and Ethereum are governed, quote unquote. Right. Because you know, there's no like, you're not voting like officially. Right. And it's, these are people, the developers, there are checks and balances. We've talked, I talk a lot about in bitcoin how even if the develop theoretically with the Ethereum developers could put out an upgrade and no one could run it, that's in practice, never happened.
00:15:45.250 - 00:15:45.714, Speaker C: Right.
00:15:45.834 - 00:15:47.490, Speaker A: On bitcoin it's happened plenty.
00:15:47.602 - 00:15:48.234, Speaker C: Right.
00:15:48.394 - 00:15:59.126, Speaker A: But like what's the process for deciding it's these calls that you listen to and that all the devs go to and they sort of just arrive at a consensus, basically.
00:15:59.230 - 00:16:13.094, Speaker C: Yeah, that's the idea. Well, the governance process is not defined well. It's not like an on chain voting process where you go through step one. Step two, there's a rough process for ethereum improvement proposals, conversations just like Bips on bitcoin.
00:16:13.134 - 00:16:18.078, Speaker A: Yeah, there should be one. It should be developed widely, it should be shared and tested widely.
00:16:18.166 - 00:16:18.534, Speaker C: Right.
00:16:18.614 - 00:16:24.542, Speaker A: And then it should receive sort of, what, a majority or super majority of consensus that it's safe and good.
00:16:24.638 - 00:16:38.630, Speaker C: Right. But it depends so much on the culture too. Like the culture around these conversations on Ethereum is so much more accepted than on bitcoin. Like if you tried to start up a conversation about how to change bitcoin for the better, there's no chance.
00:16:38.702 - 00:16:56.900, Speaker A: Oh, well, you're met with immediate skepticism. Right. And this happens a lot. I think that's okay. I mean, I think that the two different approaches are nice. You have two different bets on how and what the roadmap should be, what the style should be, what the culture should be. I think if they're the same, it makes both of them less interesting.
00:16:56.900 - 00:17:15.580, Speaker A: But you're totally right. Totally different. But I do think it's still an interesting question. It's actually not even a public blockchain layer one governance question alone. It's an open source software development question, how these things are. Consensus is derived to. Well, you can always fork it.
00:17:15.580 - 00:17:19.380, Speaker A: That's what everyone says. You can just fork it. If you want something different that they don't want, you just create your own fork.
00:17:19.532 - 00:17:25.904, Speaker C: On Ethereum, it's hard to fork because the applications don't move with you. Whereas on bitcoin I think there's not a ton.
00:17:26.204 - 00:17:32.724, Speaker A: No, but I mean, even just. That's true. There's questions about the forkability of ETH, but to be clear, you literally can fork it.
00:17:32.764 - 00:17:33.380, Speaker C: Yes, you can.
00:17:33.452 - 00:18:03.244, Speaker A: Whether it's going to be successful, very different question. But in general, in open source software, I mean, we can just go to like the Ethereum repository and literally hit fork on GitHub and create our own version of it if no one uses it. Or, you know, the stablecoin values do not get honored on my fork. Surely not. There's reasons why it is fork resistant at this point. But in general, that's what you would do if you had a big, you look at something like OpenOffice, which is like sort of a Microsoft word alternative, open source one. It's been forked like a hundred times.
00:18:03.244 - 00:18:08.524, Speaker A: There's like a bunch of different versions of it. Just Libra is great, Libreoff is a fork of it, right?
00:18:08.564 - 00:18:41.076, Speaker C: So, but to that point, I recently read a really great post about how, because all of the clients on Ethereum, like all the technology, is open source, the reason why you got L2 roll ups that are so compatible with Ethereum, and you got things like Mev Geth, which was built by flashbots, like all of these products that are now so key to like the Ethereum development roadmap, they were all started by the community because the code was so easy to just replicate. Like the EDM itself. You could build off of geth, you could build off of these clients.
00:18:41.140 - 00:19:00.318, Speaker A: I think a lot of us agree certainly, that work in this ecosystem, that open source is better for innovation. It just is. For that reason. Let's talk about Mev boost, which you've got a report coming out soon on. Remind our audience, first of all, what this is. But then what's the adoption has been growing. Tell us why.
00:19:00.396 - 00:19:56.034, Speaker C: Yeah, MevBoost is kind of this middleware software that validators run on top of their usual execution layer, consensus layer client, and it allows validators to receive blocks built by third parties. Validators are usually the ones that are packaging transactions into blocks and proposing them onto the network. But because you don't want validators to become extremely specialized and kind of make a business off of profiting from user transactions, ordering them in specific ways to extract MEV, you just kind of give them a really easy way to run MeV boost, which is the software that allows you to connect to off chain marketplaces where highly specialized entities called builders are sending pre made blocks that already have MEV on them and bribing validators to include them on chain. So that's mev boost.
00:19:56.114 - 00:20:06.396, Speaker A: Why don't you want validators doing this themselves? Explain that to me. Why is it better to separate and have these specialized searchers and whatnot block builders? What's the whole reasoning behind that?
00:20:06.460 - 00:20:57.250, Speaker C: It really comes down to the decentralization of the network. One of the supposed advantages of proof of stake is that all of your security providers, all of your block proposers, are not these large mining institutions. You don't need to have a ton of capital to contribute to the security of the network. As a validator, you should be able to run your operations. Super low cost. It should, everyone should technically be able to be a validator. It just increases your pool of people who can participate in the consensus of the network significantly but if you had the specialization of MEV profits, like by taking out MEV boost, just allowing validators to compete for MEV profits directly, then you would start to see a significant amount of centralization, which is what Ethereum developers want to.
00:20:57.322 - 00:21:13.474, Speaker A: I see. So keep it simple to run a validator. And to the extent that there's complexity and specialized knowledge required to do things like what? Identify, like sandwichable transactions or other front running, back running things that happen in MEV, just sort of separate that from the validation part.
00:21:13.594 - 00:21:15.986, Speaker C: Exactly. You don't want the consensus.
00:21:16.170 - 00:21:18.242, Speaker A: The people involved in the actual network consensus.
00:21:18.338 - 00:21:24.442, Speaker C: Yeah, the people involved in creating that consensus to become centralized to like a few entities.
00:21:24.498 - 00:21:39.322, Speaker A: And that's because what MEV is hard. Right. It's a complicated process. Everyone can be good at it. So you would essentially have a reduction of the regular folks that would be validating because they'd be dominated by the MEV people basically.
00:21:39.378 - 00:21:52.714, Speaker C: Is that the other thing? Right, right. And I think the concern though with mev boost is that you're not getting rid of the specialization, you're not getting rid of the problem. Yeah. You're just moving it and offloading it to a different part of the MeV system.
00:21:52.754 - 00:21:54.986, Speaker A: Right. And now that could become centralized and.
00:21:55.010 - 00:22:23.832, Speaker C: That is kind of what we are seeing. I mean, it's still very early days on the network and I think we're going to see a significant amount more of builder centralization once we start to see defi activity heating up. But one of the interesting things that I wanted to highlight was that some of the best builders on Ethereum today, and by the way, like 90% of blocks are now built by third party builders. So you're not getting.
00:22:23.888 - 00:22:26.560, Speaker A: So that's mev boost adoption, basically 90%.
00:22:26.632 - 00:23:10.628, Speaker C: Wow. And we're now seeing that the best builders are not actually these big venture backed companies like flashbots, is not one of the top builders in the past seven days. Neither is blocksroute, neither is block native, neither are these well known kind of. We know how they're getting their revenue, we know their business models, we know they are vc backed. It's actually these two pseudonymous builders, Beaver Build and Builder Ox 69. And OX 69 has publicly said that they were previously mining pool operator that is dominating the builder market right now. And their share is growing.
00:23:10.628 - 00:23:37.140, Speaker C: And I'm concerned about how exactly they're getting their funding because certain builders are also subsidizing their blocks, even though their blocks are more, there's a higher bid on them than there is an mev revenue so they're making a loss if they're subsidizing their blocks. I'm wondering if it's like to try and dominate the market early on and then wash out all your competitors so that you can get a leg up.
00:23:37.172 - 00:23:56.284, Speaker A: Well, if you said Ox 69, if they were a mining pool operator, they could have a lot of ETH. I mean, they could just be deep pocketed. It's actually a really interesting transition. We were all saying, what happens to the, to the Ethereum miners? Not just the ones with the machines, but the mining pools. Right? I mean, there was. Who's the big miner?
00:23:56.324 - 00:23:56.748, Speaker C: Ether mine.
00:23:56.796 - 00:24:00.900, Speaker A: Ether mine, right. I mean, they were supportive, right, of the merge.
00:24:01.012 - 00:24:01.468, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:24:01.556 - 00:24:17.696, Speaker A: And some others were. And you kind of were like, why wouldn't that, like, ruin your business? And it's like, well, they're not really the ones with the machines in the data centers. They're basically block builders. Right? The miners, the pools, like in bitcoin, they create the block templates and order the transactions.
00:24:17.780 - 00:24:18.560, Speaker C: And the pools were.
00:24:18.592 - 00:24:19.664, Speaker A: And that job still exists?
00:24:19.744 - 00:24:26.176, Speaker C: It does. And the pools were the entities before the merge that were packaging bundles from searchers.
00:24:26.240 - 00:24:26.844, Speaker B: Right.
00:24:28.184 - 00:24:59.184, Speaker C: So it makes sense to me that, of course, builder zero x 69, if they were a mining pool operator, would be one of the best builders out there. But are the proceeds, are the revenues from MeV right now really all that lucrative when defi activity is still low? And on top of that, builder Ox 69 is also operating their own relay infrastructure. And relay infrastructure is not cheap. You want it to be a performant relay. And so I'm questioning strategy here. Yeah. If the top builders are not these companies, that they're not profitable.
00:24:59.224 - 00:25:02.112, Speaker A: This guy, you said he can't be profitable at this level. You don't think.
00:25:02.208 - 00:25:06.284, Speaker C: Well, I know that builder zero six nine is subsidizing some of their blocks.
00:25:07.064 - 00:25:13.584, Speaker A: What does that mean? Throwing in additional incentive for MEV boost users to take those blocks?
00:25:13.704 - 00:25:32.238, Speaker C: I think what it means is that the. The block itself has a value. Right? Like, you sum up all the rewards from MeV, from priority fees, issuance, whatever. Yeah, not issuance because that goes to the validator. But for the builder, you just sum up the value of the block and then you compare it to the bid of the block. Like, how much are they bribing validators on that off chain marketplace?
00:25:32.326 - 00:25:34.678, Speaker A: Oh, I see. They're paying more than the total value of the block.
00:25:34.726 - 00:25:36.950, Speaker C: Exactly. And so then you can see that. You can.
00:25:37.022 - 00:25:43.456, Speaker A: Of course, you would take that, by the way. Of course, if you're a validator or whatever, and it's very competitive. Of course, you take that block, but.
00:25:43.480 - 00:25:48.872, Speaker C: Not all builders are doing this. I believe Beaver build isn't subsidizing their blocks. But again, it just makes me wonder.
00:25:48.928 - 00:25:53.872, Speaker A: Yeah, well, what is the longer term dynamic here? Right. You have to assume that that can't go on forever.
00:25:53.968 - 00:25:54.896, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly.
00:25:55.000 - 00:26:00.564, Speaker A: That's interesting. That's very interesting. What else on MeV boost have you been watching anything else that we should be paying attention to?
00:26:00.944 - 00:26:20.100, Speaker C: I guess one little thing is that over the last, I guess, even before the holiday break, we have seen an increase in the number of relays. Basically those marketplaces where builders are submitting their bids, connecting to validators, an increase in the number of non censoring relays, like relays that are agnostic, they apply.
00:26:20.132 - 00:26:22.924, Speaker A: No filtering to the transactions that get put into blocks.
00:26:23.004 - 00:27:03.196, Speaker C: Yes. But I will say the more that I look into kind of what it takes to be a relay operator, the less I'm confident that these relays that are kind of seen as public goods, they're not competitive in terms of their performance. I don't see them really taking off in terms of adoption. I think you do need to invest capital and resources to make your relay performant that isn't conducive to just having these relays, that people just kind of operate out of goodwill and then have them also be able to compete with other relays that are clearly just far more well resourced for other reasons.
00:27:03.260 - 00:27:21.464, Speaker A: Very interesting. MEV is not going away. It's going to be a big story. Certainly for Ethereum, perhaps other blockchains. It already is a little bit, although nowhere as important as Ethereum today, mostly because there's not activity at Ethereum's level basically anywhere else in the scheme of things when it comes to, like, me, viable. Is that a word? Me viable?
00:27:21.544 - 00:27:25.112, Speaker C: It's not activities. It's really not. But yeah. Yeah.
00:27:25.168 - 00:27:46.692, Speaker A: Let's talk about a couple other things outside of sort of the Ethereum specific world. Just some news items that we thought were interesting. One, I guess you pointed this out to me. The FBI confirmed that the $100 million hack of the horizon bridge was conducted by North Korea's Lazarus group, the infamous state sponsored hacker organization.
00:27:46.828 - 00:27:47.544, Speaker C: Yes.
00:27:47.964 - 00:28:02.612, Speaker A: I guess this is something I feel like we already knew. I think crypto native analysis firms had already pegged them as the culprit, but I guess the FBI is now agreeing, confirming that. What was that quote?
00:28:02.708 - 00:28:25.044, Speaker C: One interesting thing that they also included in their confirmation of what these crypto blockchain analytics firms like chainalysis and elliptic have already said before is that the DPRK uses funds it acquires from crypto hacks to fund its ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction programs. The FBI said, good lord.
00:28:25.084 - 00:28:32.500, Speaker A: So literally North Korea, we're being told by the FBI, is funding their ICBM program with stolen, like, cryptos.
00:28:32.612 - 00:28:33.860, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:28:33.972 - 00:28:40.964, Speaker A: I mean, I guess. I don't know what else they'd be using it for. I mean, shouldn't they be using it, I mean, for something more constructive, you know, like feeding their people or like something.
00:28:41.004 - 00:28:58.124, Speaker C: But you would think. But I don't think this is a great look for crypto. It's not every single time people say that crypto is used for illicit activities. Imagine now saying that crypto is used to fund nuclear weapons programs in North Korea.
00:28:58.204 - 00:29:40.498, Speaker A: And to be clear, like, we're just sort of like laughing about this because I think this is the first time we've seen that language specifically from the US government. But tornado cash, I mean, one of the biggest justifications for sanctioning and adding tornado cash to the SDN list, OFAC's SDN list supposedly was. It was widely used by the Lazarus group specifically. Right. So it's never been a good look with that north korean or other, you know, bad actors are profiting from crypto theft. Obviously, that's never been a good look, but I think this is the first time that they've said it literally is funding their ICBM program. I'm interested to know whether they actually know that's true or whether it's like, well, of course all the stolen stuff is how they're funding their bad stuff.
00:29:40.546 - 00:29:42.426, Speaker C: Like, where could it be going?
00:29:42.490 - 00:30:09.338, Speaker A: Like, do they actually know that, like, the stolen cryptos went to some, like, fiat off ramp where they then bought, like, components for the new ICBM program? Or are they just being like, obviously they're being used for that. Not saying it would be unlikely to be true. I'm just wondering, like, and we'll probably never, this is probably FBI's internal sources and methods, but interested to actually know. Do we actually actually know that or, or is it just a solid reasoning? And I think it is probably solid reasoning, unfortunately, but I feel like it.
00:30:09.346 - 00:30:21.050, Speaker C: Was kind of something. Every time you hear that north korean hackers were involved, you just kind of immediately assume it's not going to be used for something good. Like something. Oh, like let's. Yeah, definitely help. Like world poverty.
00:30:21.122 - 00:31:03.106, Speaker A: I will point out that the chainalysis companies, I think chainalysis specifically have, have noted, though, that despite, you know, say a bad headline like this, and the large number of hacks, which were mostly bridges, like this one, still like crime, illicit activity, usage of public blockchains was at the smallest percentage last year of any year of the total value of all transactions. So I think well under 1% of transactions, by their calculation, involved illicit activity. So despite some of the bad headlines, I would say it's still a moving the right direction. And the classic argument is the sort of, what about ism? Well, you know, it's like dollars are used for a lot of crime, too, folks.
00:31:03.170 - 00:31:04.054, Speaker C: Fine art.
00:31:05.674 - 00:31:15.906, Speaker A: All right, let's move on. I got another one that's kind of interesting. Oh, yeah. So the New York Department of Financial Services put out a bulletin.
00:31:16.010 - 00:31:16.694, Speaker C: Yes.
00:31:19.074 - 00:31:28.690, Speaker A: Adding further guidance to their regulated entities about not co mingling user and proprietary funds. What was that exactly.
00:31:28.802 - 00:32:33.956, Speaker C: So, revelations that FTX misused custom on money has made obviously, lawmakers and regulators in the US a lot more attentive to what's going on in the crypto space. And recently, Adrian Harris, who heads the NY DF's, has warned that crypto firms should be reminded of the licensees that are required to be practicing and has issued guidance on sub custody arrangements and disclosures, appropriate disclosures to their customers. And this is kind of interesting, because right around this time, when the NYDFs put out this guidance, Binance also said that they had been using the same wallet for customer funds as the wallet with the assets that are supposed to be backing binance pegged tokens.
00:32:34.020 - 00:32:34.356, Speaker A: Got it.
00:32:34.380 - 00:32:48.604, Speaker C: So this kind of, I guess there was some mix up on which wallets were being used to deposit customer funds, and then which wallet is being used to back the value of these binance pegged tokens.
00:32:48.644 - 00:32:49.772, Speaker A: This is Binance International.
00:32:49.908 - 00:33:28.116, Speaker C: Obviously, the big binance, the big binance did acknowledge this, said that they were rewriting the situation, moving funds out. But it does kind of show that not only do our regulators thinking more deeply and issuing guidance around this, but also crypto companies are just self, they're far more aware about these things leaking and on chain activity being more transparent and people being far more nervous about this kind of commingling of customer funds. And so it was interesting to see those two happening kind of around the same time. I don't think there was too much lash back on the binance thing, even though. I don't know.
00:33:28.180 - 00:34:00.978, Speaker A: I think as long as they have the assets. But I agree, it seems like there's going to be a push, particularly given the nature of the FTX Alameda thing, as most of us know it. And of the allegations made by regulators in law enforcement against Sam Aikman Fried, that the commingling of user assets with proprietary funds or corporate funds. First of all, it's a bad thing. That's a bad thing in finance generally, but that. That shouldn't happen. And it sounds like the guidance from DF's is also includes stuff about that.
00:34:00.978 - 00:34:06.450, Speaker A: I think we'll hear more about that finance saying the same thing, like, you know, that these assets really should be kept separately.
00:34:06.562 - 00:34:07.162, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:34:07.298 - 00:34:18.338, Speaker A: And they're really, and I know a lot. I think most of the, like, professional crypto custodians, they're. They are. I think they already do this, and they've. That. That was how a lot of them were set up specifically with that in mind. So.
00:34:18.338 - 00:34:31.967, Speaker A: But. But exchanges, though, right? Not sure. I think most of them probably do this already, but I think this is something. A clear takeaway from FTX is that, you know, Alameda shouldn't be able to just, like, access customer funds.
00:34:32.095 - 00:34:32.951, Speaker C: You know what?
00:34:33.007 - 00:34:33.815, Speaker A: That shouldn't be possible.
00:34:33.919 - 00:34:45.183, Speaker C: It shouldn't. It shouldn't. But you know, what hasn't been kind of a clear takeaway and a change and a transition from this conversation is the proof of reserves. That whole conversation has died out completely.
00:34:45.263 - 00:35:16.438, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think it's gonna die out completely, but I agree. There's been. It has receded a little bit, and I hope that we'll still get more movement on it. In fairness, a lot of the exchanges did do something on it over the last couple of months, but you're right, the drumbeat has kind of receded a little bit. I'm hoping that won't be the case. I think there's good reason. And, look, we've talked about proof reserves a fair amount on this podcast, but there's criticisms, people levy, that, like the negative account values or proof of liabilities.
00:35:16.438 - 00:35:18.126, Speaker A: Oh, my gosh. That's the hard part.
00:35:18.190 - 00:35:19.574, Speaker C: Difficulty around auditing.
00:35:19.694 - 00:35:44.542, Speaker A: Yeah. Audit firms wanting to actually do these audits. The reality is, like, any step in the right direction here is an improvement, and. And there are ways to get all the way there. But even if we don't, like, you know, when it comes to assets, liabilities, the quality of the audit, the to whom it is reported, the. The cadence of it, frequency of it, et cetera, there's plenty of variables here that make something an okay proof of reserves or a really good one.
00:35:44.598 - 00:35:44.902, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:35:44.958 - 00:36:29.650, Speaker A: But in my mind, any movement towards this is an improvement. And so I think we actually have improved a lot since prior to FTX, across a lot of venues, we got to keep the pressure up to make sure they keep doing it. And hopefully we can up the quality and propagate some standards on proof of reserves. But there are many people skeptical of this, including our friend we talked about, Dan Maciszewski from CMS holdings when he was on our podcast. You recall he was totally skeptical that this would remain a big deal, that people would sort of forget about it like they had in the past. Cause there was a big push for proof of reserves after Mount Gox, literally like almost eight years ago, and like, some did it and then, like, nobody cared for like four or five years. I hope you know why.
00:36:29.650 - 00:37:11.180, Speaker A: Here's one. Other than the fact that I think it really can mitigate something like an FTX or even prevent it, I like it because it's something that crypto assets are uniquely capable of providing as a feature you can mathematically, particularly if they're natively digital. Right. Like, if they're not like a tokenized, like a stable coin or something else. That's not something you can say for traditional assets. This is actually something where crypto asks, this could become a proof of reserves, could become a major use case for crypto assets, actually, because it's not something you can do with traditional assets. It's a major bitcoin and ETH are uniquely suited to actually not only not have an FTX, but prevent.
00:37:11.180 - 00:37:14.220, Speaker A: Do something that can't be prevented in traditional world.
00:37:14.332 - 00:37:54.124, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's an improvement in some cases, like that unique ability to prove it on chain. But for most businesses, yeah, it doesn't really do much if you can't couple it with the liabilities, which of course, and the audits, which of course is part of proof of reserves already. But that part, I think is really difficult to overcome and to do in practice, which I think it's great that we do have some amount of progress. I just don't know how meaningful it is in the context of what these businesses do. But I guess. I guess I think that this conversation, like you said, will hopefully be taken more seriously.
00:37:54.204 - 00:38:04.544, Speaker A: I hope so, too, this year. All right, one last item. World Economic Forum is happening in Davos. I guess there's not a lot of crypto being talked about this year compared to prior years.
00:38:05.244 - 00:38:08.744, Speaker C: Probably a lot of crypto companies there, though I wouldn't be surprised.
00:38:09.484 - 00:38:21.658, Speaker A: One person who was talking about it was Jamie Dimon on Squawkbox. Let's roll that clip. What we're talking about, we pretty much always have some crypto conversation with you. I'm just curious because I don't think we've talked to you since.
00:38:21.706 - 00:38:26.258, Speaker D: I think all that's been a waste of time and why you guys waste any breath on it's totally beyond me.
00:38:26.306 - 00:38:29.930, Speaker A: Because you just think the whole thing just is going to zero. Going to zero. And it's fake.
00:38:30.082 - 00:38:34.162, Speaker D: Bitcoin itself is a hyped up fraud. It's a pet rock.
00:38:34.218 - 00:38:42.258, Speaker A: Back to that, really. So what do you make then of Blackrock and other firms that are investing in infrastructure?
00:38:42.386 - 00:38:55.178, Speaker D: That's different. Blockchain is a, is a technology ledger system that we use to move information. We've used it to do overnight repo, intraday repo. We use it to, we're going to use it, we've used it to move money.
00:38:55.266 - 00:38:55.586, Speaker A: Right.
00:38:55.650 - 00:39:10.150, Speaker D: So that is a ledger, that's a technology ledger type of thing that we think will be deployable. Remember, based on, remember, we've been talking about that for twelve years too, and very little has been done. There are some tokens that I agree with you, but bitcoin is based on a distributed, it has all the characteristics.
00:39:10.182 - 00:39:14.674, Speaker A: Of a store of value. It's immutable, it's scarce.
00:39:15.414 - 00:39:16.166, Speaker D: Totally untrue.
00:39:16.190 - 00:39:17.702, Speaker B: It's 21 million.
00:39:17.758 - 00:39:26.022, Speaker D: Well, yeah. Really? How do you know it's going to stop at 21 million? Because it's, I mentioned this to people, Satoshi, everyone says that, well, maybe it's going to get to 21 million, then Satoshi's picture is going to come up.
00:39:26.038 - 00:39:27.114, Speaker B: And laugh at you all.
00:39:28.894 - 00:39:32.466, Speaker D: There isn't a, by then, Satoshi, you've taken out billions of dollars.
00:39:32.530 - 00:39:54.874, Speaker A: I think we'll stop it there. Gosh, just a couple things here. First of all, the reason people give any time to it, Mister diamond, is because ethereum and bitcoin are basically the two best performing assets in the world, across asset class, since COVID lows. And by the way, if we go back even further, it only looks better for them on a total return basis. So that's why they quote, waste breath.
00:39:54.914 - 00:39:59.026, Speaker C: On it, Jamie, because pop off, go, go.
00:39:59.210 - 00:40:29.036, Speaker A: Because they perform so well. And you run an investment bank, so you know, investment returns matter. But also, you know, they said, I think the squawk box host, they asked, well then why is black record stuff doing? And he's like, no, no, that's different. That's blockchain and disregarded ledger. No, no, sir, excuse me. Fidelity and Blackrock and many others, they're building on public blockchains. Fidelity has crypto asset services not just blockchain technology, distributed ledger.
00:40:29.036 - 00:40:59.714, Speaker A: Uh, Mister diamond, they are building with bitcoin and ETH. Um, so it's not just like, oh, DLT, you know, blockchain, not bitcoin, that thing from, you know, seven years ago is rearing its head again. Don't get me wrong, like I've said this many times, blockchain technology by itself, enterprise blockchain. I'm not putting the nail in the coffin just yet, but, you know, they didn't ask him to disavow, you know, fidelity. Right. Because that, that's, Fidelity's primarily a custodian for crypto assets today, right? Not for. They're not building a supply chain system.
00:41:00.294 - 00:41:41.034, Speaker C: And also the 21 million, how do we know that bitcoin is going to stop at 21 million? Literally, miners like the whole, it's simple. It's literally, if you looked at the code that operates bitcoin, if you just evaluated exactly how bitcoin works, that's completely transparent. There are thousands if not millions of people around the world that are operating this code, that, see that this is the way that the code works. It's not some company where you don't know the operations of how that company is working. There is no secret document or secret.
00:41:41.114 - 00:41:43.498, Speaker A: Way, secret picture of Satoshi's face in.
00:41:43.506 - 00:41:48.488, Speaker C: Which you couldn't know exactly how the network is operating completely.
00:41:48.576 - 00:42:08.888, Speaker A: It's literally completely transparent. That's the other reason why I hate, how can it be a fraud? Is a hyped up fraud. How could literally open source code that just does a thing be a fraud? It's impossible to be a fraud. There's no, I mean, bitcoin, more than any of the other cryptos, is anything but a fraud. It's like the most transparent, predictable thing, I think, in, in money, in finance.
00:42:08.976 - 00:42:10.560, Speaker C: And probably the most unchanging, too.
00:42:10.632 - 00:42:31.036, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, whether you think that it should be worth what it's worth, that's a totally different question. Right. And, you know, I, we hear Mister Diamond's view on that. I mean, that's fine. I think, again, if we look at the total returns or the volatility adjusted returns, I think he would find that he's not right about its value. But it's just, it can't be a fraud if it's literally just code that people chose to run.
00:42:31.036 - 00:42:45.344, Speaker A: It's valuable because the people who run it value it. And by the way, just for our audience, bitcoin will actually never reach 21 million. So even if there was a Satoshi's face, that would come up at 21 million, there actually never will be a supply of 21 million.
00:42:45.784 - 00:42:46.928, Speaker C: And how do we know it actually.
00:42:46.976 - 00:43:03.376, Speaker A: Approaches 21, but never actually gets there? And we know that because of the mathematics. One last thing. Now, if bitcoin's supply, total terminal supply, were to change, which is possible, it wouldn't be because of some secret thing Satoshi left in the code.
00:43:03.480 - 00:43:08.656, Speaker C: It would be because we would be able to see that, yes, we'd be able to notice that literally everyone in the world would be able to.
00:43:08.680 - 00:43:20.000, Speaker A: If the total terminal supply, Max supply, were to change, it would be solely due to overwhelming social consensus by people who run bitcoin software deciding to change it. Now, that technically is possible, and we've.
00:43:20.032 - 00:43:27.524, Speaker C: Talked about the reasons why potentially it might happen and the discussions and debates around that, but clearly this is not where he's going.
00:43:28.064 - 00:44:18.676, Speaker A: We might be a little bit more deeply into this question and have thought about it a little bit more deeply than Mister Diamond. I hope he'll reconsider and think a little more deeply about it going forward. That's a great clip, and you got to give it to the squawk box hosts really pushing back on him, because they do cover it. And by the way, can we just. Even if you don't believe in bitcoin or ethereum or crypto broadly, another reason to, quote unquote, waste breath on it is it's objectively the most interesting thing, in my opinion, to happen to finance and monetary systems in decades. I mean, it's just super interesting. It's like, what if you had the developers that created the tech industry theoretically able to now experiment with money in finance, open sourcing of this historically incredibly closed source thing, finance.
00:44:18.676 - 00:44:28.076, Speaker A: But not just that sovereign only thing. Money is yielding super interesting experiments. And that's why people talk about a lot, even if they don't like it.
00:44:28.180 - 00:44:36.108, Speaker C: Truth. Truth. None of that has changed in 2023. And those are like some of the fundamental and core values of why so many people are still here today.
00:44:36.196 - 00:44:41.334, Speaker A: Yeah, great conversation. Christine Kim from Galaxy Research. Thank you so much, my friend.
