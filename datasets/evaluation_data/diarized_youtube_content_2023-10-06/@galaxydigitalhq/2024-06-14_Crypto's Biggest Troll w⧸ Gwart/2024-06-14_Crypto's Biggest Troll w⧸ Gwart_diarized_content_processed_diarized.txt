00:00:00.640 - 00:00:03.582, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, an infinite amount of cash.
00:00:03.678 - 00:00:04.334, Speaker B: Cash.
00:00:04.494 - 00:00:13.594, Speaker A: I'm your host, Alex Thornton. The us banking system is sound and resilient. Bitcoin made a new all time high. If you're not long, if you're not long, you're short.
00:00:13.934 - 00:00:19.470, Speaker B: Satoshi's gonna come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet. All bitcoin's gonna be erased.
00:00:19.662 - 00:00:20.358, Speaker C: Bitcoin.
00:00:20.446 - 00:00:22.114, Speaker A: Bitcoin's the best crypto else.
00:00:22.814 - 00:00:24.834, Speaker B: Bitcoin is going to zero.
00:00:25.874 - 00:00:44.334, Speaker A: Welcome back to Galaxy Brains. I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmware research at Galaxy Digital. Bitcoin, not zero. In fact, we're feeling nice off this CPI print. And, I don't know, it's kind of an interesting day. We've got a great episode for you. King Troll of crypto, Twitter Gwart is our guest.
00:00:44.334 - 00:01:25.236, Speaker A: We talk about a whole variety of things related to blockchains, their use tokens, their viability, their legitimacy. And of course, we'll check with our good friend Bimnet, a BB from galaxy trading, as always, to talk about fed day. Big day today. Before we get to that, I need to remind you, please refer to link to disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Also last night, former President Trump hosted a meeting with major bitcoin mining companies, and then he posted on truth Social, his own social media network. He said, vote for Trump. Bitcoin mining may be our last defense against a CBDC.
00:01:25.236 - 00:01:59.754, Speaker A: Biden's hatred of bitcoin only helps China, Russia and the radical communist left. We want all the remaining bitcoin to be made in the USA. It will help us be energy dominant. And he linked to a bitcoin magazine article endorsing him for president as the bitcoin candidate. It continues to get interesting out here in politics and bitcoin and, you know, gosh, the crypto industry and bitcoin are part of this campaign increasingly. I won't belagor the point because we've been covering it now for several weeks, but, you know, just another update. Let's get right into it.
00:01:59.754 - 00:02:07.314, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, BImnat, welcome back to Galaxy Brains.
00:02:07.854 - 00:02:09.114, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:02:10.014 - 00:02:14.554, Speaker A: Big day today. Fed day, CPI day. Tell us what happened.
00:02:16.094 - 00:03:01.042, Speaker C: So you got a pretty soft CPI print, a 0.2 month on month in core CPI. That was really good reading. You saw some of the hotter points recently cool off a little bit, things like insurance prices and some of the other metrics, but high level. This was a soft inflation print that came in below market expectations. And the substance of it was supportive of continued slowdown in inflation on a go forward basis. To caveat that you still have elevated core inflation if you annualize and compound a 0.2
00:03:01.042 - 00:03:33.410, Speaker C: month on month, that actually takes you close to a two seven ish on an annualized basis. And so that's still above the 2% target. In addition, supercore inflation, which is services inflation x shelter, came in at 0.22 month on month. And that is a very welcome sort of decline. I believe last month it was 0.42 ish, and so that was a very meaningful decline.
00:03:33.410 - 00:04:35.954, Speaker C: However, the headline supercore number is still on an annualized basis is still 4.8%, and so it's a very high number. And then with the Fed, most importantly, you got pretty meaningful information out of the summary of economic projections and the dot plot. It showed that folks were only expecting one cut in the rest of 2024 and four cuts for 2025. And the market perceived that as a little bit hawkish, especially in the context of a soft inflation print that we got earlier this morning. And so there's a little bit for everyone. I think the main message that Powell tried to get through in the press conference was that they're going to be data dependent, and that's what he's been saying for the past couple of meetings now.
00:04:35.954 - 00:05:13.624, Speaker C: And so you got a bunch of information. It was more dovish than expected, particularly in the context of the CPI print. That was fairly soft this morning, and you saw a pretty aggressive rate rally that sustained itself. So you're seeing ten year yields at 430 over a ten basis point drop on the day. You've seen equities rally, percent and a half in the Nasdaq, 1.2% on S and P. And so risk is like the number dollar is weaker on it.
00:05:13.624 - 00:06:15.944, Speaker C: I think that's an appropriate market reaction. I would just say though, that there are still pockets of the economy that are doing great and there are sticky parts of inflation. And ultimately the question about where you can take rates up to or down to on a terminal basis is still up in the air. And if you look at the dot plot, the neutral rate did go up to 2.8%. And so I think that there's more of a realization in the market and from FOMC participants that the long run neutral rate is higher than we had previously thought. And even if you do get a couple of soft inflation prints, it doesn't take away from the fact that the rate that makes the economy not overheat but not contract that much is still higher than where we were thinking it was going to be years ago.
00:06:16.324 - 00:06:25.608, Speaker A: Yeah, I think you're right. Something for everyone. A little bit of a mixed bag here too, with non farm payrolls. Were pretty hot. Right? On Friday last week.
00:06:25.736 - 00:06:26.160, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:06:26.232 - 00:06:36.688, Speaker A: So the employment picture doesn't look like it's slowing down really. Right. And now, but, but the, and then also I saw one of the other ones. You correct me on that too, or add your, your actual knowledge of this?
00:06:36.736 - 00:06:40.744, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's so mixed though. Like, they're poor.
00:06:40.784 - 00:06:46.204, Speaker A: Like, owner pretty, pretty hot in CPI also still, right?
00:06:46.704 - 00:07:34.732, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I think it came in at 0.4. And like, shelter is a big part of people's expenses. And like, yeah, I was in an Uber driver today and he's like, I work six a half days a week and I need to pay for a queen's apartment and I'm paying 1500 for a two bedroom. And he's like, when he was in New York a while back, he was paying 600 a month for rent. The absolute level of prices is still super high. And just because the rate of which those prices are increasing is cooling, doesn't mean that a lot of folks aren't in pain because of how high prices are. And incomes have certainly not kept up with the overall price increase that you've had over the past three years.
00:07:34.732 - 00:08:21.334, Speaker C: Folks have not gotten a 25% raise in the past three years on average. At least there's still that pain in the market. And that's why I think that the Fed can't be too aggressive or eager to call success on the soft landing. And that's why they probably shouldn't cut rates too quickly or too aggressively. And then looking a little bit ahead, sorry to get off track, but looking a little bit ahead, you also have trumponomics most likely coming. And as we've discussed that that's inflationary. But back to your point about the labor market, the data is just so all over the place.
00:08:21.334 - 00:09:04.630, Speaker C: So like, if you look at ISM services and the employment component there, it's like below 50, it's at 47 that's contracting. Last week you had a in jolts. The job openings figure you've had some of the high frequency data points, like the indeed job data kind of show a slowdown. And ADP came in soft as well, which is the payment processor. When you throw in a non farm payroll headline number that's 275, you're like, well, that's not consistent with what I've been seeing in other things. But there's also the household survey versus the employer survey, the establishment survey. Sorry.
00:09:04.630 - 00:10:07.302, Speaker C: And there's a big disparity between the job figures there. And there's also some other kind of estimates that the Bureau of Labor statistics puts into the non farm payroll figure, the birth debt stuff in terms of new businesses and how many employees that typically generates and stuff. So there's a lot of weird nuances that make the data picture a little unclear. And the job of the Fed, and this is what Paul is saying, is to have the tools to react in the face of that uncertainty. And so if you've already cut too much, too much, and really the price data starts to come in hot, hot again, that going to put you in a much worse position in terms of tackling inflation. And on the flip side as well, you can really put yourself in a bind if you're the Fed. And ultimately they care about their credibility as well.
00:10:07.302 - 00:10:24.564, Speaker C: And so they don't want to repeat the same mistakes of COVID thinking that inflation wasn't going to come back. And so they really have to kind of be certain that inflation is going away to really start the easing cycle in a meaningful manner.
00:10:24.944 - 00:10:38.192, Speaker A: Well, lots of interesting information I saw. You know, it seemed like Powell did say that they won't cut, sorry, they won't hike this year. That that's off the table. The dot plot shows no hikes. Right. But we'll check in with you.
00:10:38.208 - 00:11:22.728, Speaker C: It's a busy day. Yeah. I, personally, I think he could be justified in hiking. There's enough stuff if data goes higher, if we basically had a repeat of the first three months of the year, in terms of the inflation data, I would say that hike should be on the table. But ultimately, I don't think that the fed should be giving up optionality in any direction because you're one supply shock away. You're a couple of fiscal measures away from the government. They're doing this stuff with Fannie and Freddie where folks might get easier access to home equity loans.
00:11:22.728 - 00:12:09.176, Speaker C: There's some stuff in the works on student loan forgiveness. Long story short, I think there's a lot of politicians with an incentive to make sure that their constituents are feeling wealthier going into the poll booths. And so that's going to be stimulative and that's inflationary. And then on top of that, you've got a potential presidential candidate that might bring on more inflationary policies. And so I'm of the camp that you're supposed to keep optionality and not limit yourself. And so I wasn't a big fan of taking hikes off the table like that just because you're meant to react to hot data and you just want to preserve that optionality.
00:12:09.360 - 00:12:18.764, Speaker A: Yeah. And that's what they say they're going to do, is react to the data. So it is actually a little contradictory. I mean, if the data comes in hot, then they very well might hike. But, you know. Yeah.
00:12:20.304 - 00:13:23.354, Speaker C: And the other thing to think about is, sorry to keep going on this, but, like, there's a figure, I think we spoke about it last week, but there's $3.2 trillion flowing into the economy per quarter just from money market fund dividends and yields on t bills, et cetera, and from dividends from listed companies. And so that's a lot of money and stimulus that's being provided as a function of high interest rate policy. And so there's some folks that are on the more controversial side of kind of macroeconomic policy that are like, these rates are actually stimulative. And if you look at household wealth, wealth per capita in the US, all of these things are trending higher. And the positive rate environment hasn't really hurt stocks that much. And folks are also not inclined to sell their home or put their homes up for sale if interest rates are low.
00:13:23.354 - 00:14:10.714, Speaker C: Interest rates are high. And so there's been an element of supply being kept off the market and housing, and therefore the prices remaining elevated or staying sticky. There's lots of various elements that the Fed is trying to navigate, but main takeaway from today is you got a soft inflation print, one that you don't have to look too closely at. It's just good. It's not like it's good and bad. For the most part, it's good in the context of the data we've seen, in the context of what the Fed wants to see. And if we see more of those good prints, the Fed will become easier in its monetary policy.
00:14:11.174 - 00:14:24.910, Speaker A: Got it. Bimnadabibi from galaxy trading. As always, my friend, thanks for coming on, galaxy brains. Let's go now to our guest, gwart Gwart from the Internet, Internet celebrity. Gwart, welcome to Galaxy Brains. Thanks for joining.
00:14:25.102 - 00:14:46.726, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for having me. I'm Gort. I'm Internet celebrity is probably a bit generous, but if that's what I'm gonna be referred to, I'll take it. I'm a honestly just a Twitter personality. I don't know that I'm anything more than that podcaster as well. Everyone deserves their own podcast, so. But apart from that.
00:14:46.726 - 00:14:50.394, Speaker B: Yeah, just a follower of the crypto space.
00:14:51.994 - 00:15:44.984, Speaker A: Yeah. You know, Gwart, you came on the scene on Twitter. And by the way, shout out yes to the Gwart show on, which is part of Block Space media, a new crypto and bitcoin media franchise from our friends Will Foxley, our friend, friend of galaxies, as well, the maker of the video we, the movie we made, the big empty, about our mining operation in Texas. So, Gwart, you came on the scene on Twitter with this really irreverent satirical style of commenting on really pretty niche, like, technological crypto aspects. And I guess before we get into some of the opinions that you've espoused there. And now, of course, with many great interviews you've done on your podcast, what made you decide to create the Gwart account? And, you know, how did that start?
00:15:46.884 - 00:16:07.084, Speaker B: Yeah, well, the. So the profile picture is of this character from this show on HBO called Silicon Valley, which I think the character is in maybe like three or four episodes, and she doesn't say a word the entire show. So I don't. I just thought it was a. I thought it was a funny character. But anyways, I was just giving some context that there's no reason that I chose this apartment. It's kind of like a bit of a ridiculous looking person.
00:16:07.084 - 00:17:00.704, Speaker B: And it's like, I just felt like this would be good for my Twitter Persona. I'd followed crypto Twitter for quite some time, but I never really engaged much, just purely on the sidelines, I think during the bear market, which, somewhat standard, I think people start to get bored. Well, actually, there's a little bit of context there, which is that during the bull market, if you actually stop and pay attention to how any of this stuff works, losing money. Right. Like, you should be max aping during the bull market and not actually trying to figure out how any of this stuff works. Well, once it all went, like, straight down, I started paying attention a little bit more to, like, I guess, the mechanism design of crypto, and, like, started trolling a bit about this. And that led into, I guess, the Persona I have now, I think, and I've also kind of vocalized this before, but I always felt that there was.
00:17:00.704 - 00:17:39.540, Speaker B: There was, like, a lot of people who would go after what I would consider to be, like, very egregious scams, right? Like the, like, do Kwans and the SBFs. Like, these aren't, this was never, like, particularly interesting. It's like, it's very flagrant, you know, and anybody, when it's on the front page of the Wall Street Journal, it's like, it's not hard to figure out these people. Like, they don't have the best intentions of their investors. But, like, I never, I mean, I often felt that there weren't, there wasn't a, there wasn't much, like, pushback on some, maybe not people specifically, but just, like, ideas. Like, a lot of these, like, first principles that people take at face value. Like, wait, hang on.
00:17:39.540 - 00:17:58.094, Speaker B: Like, back up. This isn't a first principle. Like, you just made this up and you're basing your entire, you know, like, mechanism design ideas off this. So, yeah, like, I think that's, that provides a little context as to, like, you know, there's not, there's not a lot of, like, method to the madness is pretty much what you'd expect from my twitter.
00:17:59.714 - 00:18:41.318, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, you have been an excellent troll, and I think that was what made it so interesting. To your point, the trolling on sort of more niche and intellectual side of crypto technology. I mean, really things dows and modularity and restaking and, I mean, and also just tokens in general. I think it's, it was a breath of fresh air. A lot of people, I think a lot of people even thought that you were an insider at some major vc or big project, and because your pointed criticisms and satire were so on point. Are you a member of a, are you some secret big venture capitalist or something like that?
00:18:41.406 - 00:19:12.954, Speaker B: No, I have been accused many times. The running joke is that I'm Dan Robinson from paradigm. And then I've been, I've been accused of being a few others. But no, I'm like, I'm not as just kind of, like, random as they come, to be honest, just like a spectator for a long time. And, yeah, that's how I kind of jumped in. So I also don't have, like, I would say I can, I'm certainly in the camp that can say more like whatever I want. Right? Like, I don't have any, like, you know, I don't have anything that I have to protect in what I say.
00:19:14.274 - 00:19:49.914, Speaker A: I love that you said just a couple of tweets, just recent ones, just to sort of highlight this for the audience. You tweeted, I guess, yesterday. If I get a very small airdrop or no airdrop at all, I take this to mean the team does not trust my judgment to govern a protocol. And so I look inward. What could I do to present myself as a better leader? And then I reach out on LinkedIn to team members and ask for feedback. I guess the concept here you're really satirizing is airdrops and governance tokens in general. Before we get into all of that, I'll read some other great ones that I have screenshotted here from Gord's past.
00:19:49.914 - 00:20:02.794, Speaker A: But before we get into that, let's start with bitcoin. What are your thoughts on bitcoin? I have to say, I don't see you mock bitcoin very often. Where does bitcoin fit in in your world and the crypto?
00:20:04.694 - 00:20:29.734, Speaker B: I think I've always been quite a bitcoin bull, so I said I didn't have any biases earlier, and I absolutely do. I'm like, I would call myself a bitcoin or not. I wouldn't call myself a bitcoin maxi, but I would definitely call myself a bitcoiner. And this was. Yeah, like, when I first got into crypto 2017. Like, I don't know how much sense bitcoin made to me at the time, but within. Within a much shorter period of time, bitcoin made a lot of sense to me.
00:20:29.734 - 00:20:46.866, Speaker B: And I would. I would say that that has. I've grown increasingly confident in that position. Like, more and more, I feel like I'm a bitcoiner. Right. So, yeah, I mean, like, the thing is, is bitcoin's quite. I was gonna say simple.
00:20:46.866 - 00:21:03.414, Speaker B: I don't know if that that's really the right word. It's intuitive to me. Right. Like, a. The idea of a hard money is, like, it's quite intuitive to me. The idea of, like, non sovereign store value is, like, this makes a lot of sense. And, yeah, I mean, like, a lot of the rest of this stuff, as you can tell with what I troll about, it's.
00:21:03.414 - 00:21:25.834, Speaker B: I'm less certain on in terms of, like, it's the long run, viability or sustainability. And, you know, I'm. I think there's, like, a decent chance that some of it works out, but I wouldn't, like, put my finger on anything specifically. But, like, to the extent that I have, like, a, you know, foundational belief, like, I'm. I would consider myself a bitcoiner.
00:21:26.174 - 00:21:55.976, Speaker A: I think that makes sense. I think especially as the. The ex bitcoin technology space in public blockchains becomes more and more complicated. And I don't just mean that the technology is hard to understand. I mean that, like, the actual functional design of these blockchains is more and more complicated. Right? At first it was Ethereum's the world computer. Now it's like, well, it's not going to scale well enough to be the world computer, so we need layers attached to it so that they can help it be the world computer.
00:21:55.976 - 00:22:24.844, Speaker A: But now it's like, well, actually, we're not even going to really use Ethereum as any part of the compute part of the world computer. It'll just be like a data availability layer. And there's so much movement here. Let's talk about this a little bit. The modularity and layered scaling. Sticking with the bitcoin side. I think one of my researchers had counted over 50 announced or launching bitcoin L2s.
00:22:24.844 - 00:22:53.934, Speaker A: It's similar. There's dozens of them as well. In the Ethereum world. A couple have real usage for sure. Does that feel like over complexity? Do you think we're going to, is the future of the true general computation blockchain space going to be this interlocking web of restaked coins powering layers that roll up to other? Is that utopia?
00:22:55.754 - 00:23:39.824, Speaker B: Well, okay, I'll start by saying one thing, which I think that, I like to reiterate this, because I think this is oftentimes lost, like bitcoin. Maybe it wasn't described in such flowery language, but bitcoin has long been a modular stack. If you zoom out, the intention of bitcoin has always been, we scale in layers. This was the intention of lightning. This is why Greg Maxwell in 2014 was talking about the inefficiency of side chains at the time. And this is why we now see Eric and Udi pointing to how they had mentioned that if the Zk tech got there, um, actually, I'm not entirely sure that Greg Maxwell's talking precisely about that when he was talking about Zk tech. But, um, so I think that, like, this has always been the plan with, with bitcoin.
00:23:39.824 - 00:24:49.908, Speaker B: Um, and if we go back, right, like, we can understand why we chose lightning as a scaling solution, right? Like state channels are, they're straightforward. We've now realized that, like, you know, running a lightning node and liquidity management, this stuff has like, been, um, probably not as user friendly as we would have hoped. Now, now, coming up to my second point here, which is, okay, so like, what, what have we learned elsewhere? Bitcoin has always said we're going to take, we're going to pull the best tech from elsewhere, right? This is what they've always said, okay, our roll ups, the best tech, I'm I don't know. Right. Like, and this is probably maybe one of my overarching themes I have with a lot of. With a lot of crypto. I don't know that we have enough historical evidence to even suggest that roll ups have product market fit, yet we see people are using them on ethereum, but what are people using them for, these ongoing Ponzi games? My reservations a lot of times is not so much in let's not try these things, it's in, we can try these things, but let's not point at something and say, oh, this has unlocked.
00:24:49.908 - 00:25:21.314, Speaker B: This is a clear unlock when I'm not sure that's indeed the case. So there seems to have been in the past, like, two or three years, some breakthroughs in ZK tech, right? Like, this is the selling point. Like, you know, like, proving times have come down substantially, proving costs have come down substantially. Is this the solution for bitcoin? I I'm probably still on the fence. You know, I think that it. It's interesting to see all of this play out with, like, the new l two and not. Not just ck roll ups, by the way, but just roll ups in general.
00:25:21.314 - 00:25:41.864, Speaker B: I think to me, I look at this now and I'm like, look, are we going to pretend like we learned nothing from ethereum, right? Like, are we. Are we going to duplicate all of this? If we're going to duplicate all this? Like, we got to keep the ponzi's going, right. We're going to have to have, like, continuous token printing to keep this going on. So, I mean, I'm like, that was a bit of a cynical take.
00:25:42.164 - 00:26:03.114, Speaker A: Your point is a little bit like, among others. I mean, there's a lot to dig in there, but you're. One of the points that I think is quite interesting is that you're saying that the sort of. You're saying Ponzi is the token generation, the less, like, actually useful usage has nonetheless been the activity that has helped drive the underlying technology stack development forward.
00:26:05.174 - 00:26:29.782, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, that. Yeah, I think. I don't know if you meant that, like, in a generous interpretation or like, a less generous interpretation. I think, yeah, the way that I see it is like, so we went from, like, being very far on, like, the lightning. We're gonna scale with lightning, right? And then there was this new bitcoin season two. Like, we're gonna reintroduce expressivity. We're gonna bring people back to bitcoin.
00:26:29.782 - 00:27:16.834, Speaker B: And now, like, maybe some of us are somewhere in the middle of, like, okay, you know, you can look at all of these Ethel twos, but like there's like a new one dropping every single week. I'm not going to sit here and say like, oh, like, this is obviously an unlock, right? And like, I. When you have these token like, incentives involved, like we can talk about that in a bit if you want. Like when you have these tokens incentive involved, like, it really does distort markets. Like I find it very difficult to discern if something truly has product market fit or like any sustainability to it when 99% of the usage is to further the ongoing Ponzi games. Right? And like maybe we converge on something useful at some point. Maybe, but I'm just like not willing to say that yet.
00:27:16.834 - 00:27:19.274, Speaker B: Right? Like, that's not my personal opinion yet.
00:27:19.434 - 00:27:30.378, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a fair point. I mean, let's expand on it though. What has been useful in crypto in your mind from the application standpoint.
00:27:30.506 - 00:28:06.332, Speaker B: All right, well, I'll tell you what. And this is sort of like a cliche at this point, but I think that, I think that stable coins are undeniably useful. Right? Like, and that's something that has garnered real product market fit outside of pure speculation. I think NFTs actually not any specific NFT and maybe not even, maybe not even the current iteration of NFTs. I wouldn't, I wouldn't like, you know, say that right now either. But I think just the idea of NFTs is something that will persist. Like the idea of, you know, Ryan Dale says this like quite well, right? Like bitcoin is digital gold and NFTs are digital jewelry.
00:28:06.332 - 00:29:03.384, Speaker B: I think it works. I also think there is, there, there are people who want to identify like, you know, like all this stuff you hear about like the future of nfTs. Like, I think some of it is legitimate. And then the third thing I would say is bitcoin as a non sovereign store value, right? Like those are the three things that I think have clear product market fit. Now, outside of this, I'm pretty unconvinced on a lot of defi, for what it's worth, you know, I think that when, like it sort of goes back to the point I was saying before, when you have 99%, and I don't know if I'm being like overzealous with that or, you know, generous, but like when you have 99% of what I consider to be people using this for the purpose of getting more tokens and selling them, it's not immediately clear. This is the making of an efficient capital market. Right? So, like, you have some dj's who are getting free tokens for locking up their coins and doing all these Ponzi games.
00:29:03.384 - 00:29:36.016, Speaker B: This doesn't translate necessarily to, like, the broader vision of increasing capital efficiency in global markets. Right. And I think that this is like a big. This is like a big chasm that I still feel like what, you know, a lot of the people I view in crypto are unable to kind of come to terms with is, like, look, like you. You can. Like, we can keep doing this and perhaps we converge on something useful. But, like, I wouldn't say yet that this is indicative of the future of finance.
00:29:36.080 - 00:30:08.268, Speaker A: Right, yeah, I hear you. In fact, this brings me to another gwart tweet highlight. You said you tweeted. It is incredibly embarrassing that Satoshi did not think about yielding and that yield that I think that you're joking about is this token printing, right? I mean, most of the yield. I mean, now you have some other sources of yield. I think it's fair to say, with RWA and stuff coming on chain, actual, truly yield bearing assets, even staking, I don't really call it yield. It's dilution protection, really.
00:30:08.268 - 00:30:35.322, Speaker A: But let's at least there's sort of something behind it. But most of the yield when you talk about, like, especially 2021 and sort of other hype cycles in crypto has actually been inflation. And the yield that you get is if you just sell the tokens that you either earn, you either farm or you are airdropped. Right? It's not a yield. It's you're going and farming and then just dumping. Right? Is that. Here's a.
00:30:35.322 - 00:30:44.954, Speaker A: Well, I don't know if you have anything to add to this. I'm just pointing out that awesome tweet because, of course, there is no yield in bitcoin. Why didn't Satoshi think about that? Seems like all anybody cares about in defi.
00:30:45.654 - 00:31:28.110, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I really do think this is like, a vestige of, like, the fiat cucked mind. Like, honestly, like, we really have to understand it. Like, we're trying to do something different here, right? Like, and even when I hear people talk about, like, oh, Wall Street's gonna love yield, it's like, you know, this is sickening. Like, you should be ashamed of yourself for wanting to pander to Wall street. Right? Like, the entire premise here is, like, a hard money that you can hold and hold in self custody and not risk being diluted by the federal government or people who can change the rules. Right? Like, that's what we're aiming for. And so the entire premise of yield is, like, it really is rooted in, like, a lot of this, like, keynesian, like, tradfi, like, rent seeking mentality.
00:31:28.110 - 00:31:53.534, Speaker B: And, you know, it's not to say that, like, yield won't exist with bitcoin, of course. Like, in, in efficient capital markets. Like, people will lend, people will borrow, like, the market will determine a true interest rate. But, like, the idea of, you know, just ongoing tokens, just more and more like this. This idea is like, is. It's honestly like, it. When I hear this, it makes me wonder, like, what do you people think we're trying to do here? Right.
00:31:53.534 - 00:32:01.294, Speaker B: Like, I really. It does at times kind of. I question that, but, you know, we'll see. We'll see.
00:32:02.074 - 00:33:01.366, Speaker A: What do you think about this argument that a lot of that, the sort of the friction between developers, users and farmers. I think I saw somebody. I can't remember. I thought it was David Hoffman tweet about this today, but I can't find the tweet, but that some of the incentives that exist today are largely, certainly not exclusively, but were largely caused by the SEC's stands on token generation and the way that it sort of played out in the courts. You could theoretically have a thing where a project sells broadly to the public with disclosures, some kind of regulated offering. We had unregulated icos, but in the absence of that capability, it's turned into, frankly, airdrop farming as the only, you know. Yeah, the ripple case, that was one of the only, you know, that was one of the parts that ripple won on in their case was that airdrops weren't argued by.
00:33:01.366 - 00:33:21.936, Speaker A: Weren't seen by the court to be securities because there's no investment of money, you know, so I feel. So that's sort of the way that all of these projects have gone to get their tokens out into the. Into the mainstream. Like, you know, I don't know if you have thoughts on that as sort of, like, is it, was it inevitable? Is or is it partially the product of the, you know, the system that as it's been designed?
00:33:22.120 - 00:33:33.456, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, like, okay, you didn't. You. You didn't want me to give, like, non controversial take. So I'll tell you, like, my honest view on this. I think this has largely been like a cop out. Right? Like, the reality is. Okay, so I'll start.
00:33:33.456 - 00:34:04.048, Speaker B: I'll preface this by saying, yeah, I'm sympathetic. I think anybody should be able to release a shitcoin whenever they want. Like, I and I really, like, I believe that. I don't, I don't think it's necessarily useful. Or maybe what does this say about like the late stage capitalism, like hedonistic mentality that we all have. Cause we don't have to work in the fields anymore, you know, like, but I would say that I think this has been used very much, like on the side of a lot of these VC's, right? Like they take this stance. Well, we can't do it like that.
00:34:04.048 - 00:34:42.976, Speaker B: Like we can't do a fair launch anymore. We can't sell directly to the public. So we have to do it like this. And like, it's very rarely do people think like, wait, hang on, should we be doing this at all? Because if we do it like this, perhaps we defeat the purpose of what we were trying to do to begin with. Right? And so, I mean that would be like my, my first thought, you know, the other thing too is like, it sounds like so caustic to say this, but like they're really. We had icos and what, what successful icos came about, right? Like we did have that period of time there where we had icos. Like I was reminded of this today.
00:34:42.976 - 00:35:06.444, Speaker B: Ave came out of eth Etheland came out of an ICO that was, that was one of the icos. You know, there was hundreds, thousands likely of icos launched. Right? Like, what projects are we now saying? Like, oh, like that's how it was done. And like, clearly the, the inception of this project as a result of being an ICO is like, what made this fair? It's like, no, like, these have all failed too. Like, come on, like, you know.
00:35:07.664 - 00:35:46.636, Speaker A: Yeah, I hear you. I think there have been. I totally agree. There were plenty of bad ones. There were many lacks of disclosure as well that you. And there were straight up rugs, tons of them. One thing that I've noticed is that the coins that have sort of lasted, like Tezos and Cardano and Ethereum, which had an ICO, their token distribution is significantly better and more diluted and less held by large entities than the sort of later stage of ones that still exist that either raised as through simple agreements for future tokens or through other means.
00:35:46.636 - 00:36:10.954, Speaker A: Right? Like the Solanas and the, and the Avax is. Right. Like that sort of 21 22 crowd has a much more centralized holder base than the Cardano's and ethereums and tezos. Right? I mean, is that. I don't know, I guess maybe that's a lot to. Maybe that's not getting enough for all the collateral damage of the ICO era. But to me that's a slight positive.
00:36:11.934 - 00:37:58.824, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean I think like distribution, like so I guess maybe to compare this to like last cycles, you know, low float, high FTV tokens, the, the easy argument to make against the points that, you know, maybe I just made is like, look, we're still too early, okay? Like maybe, you know what I mean? Like we're, you can always say this, like actually I had a friend tell me the day like after the.com bubble. I think that Microsoft took like 14 years to return to an all time high. So I mean maybe these things take time, right? But like let me just like put this in a slightly different framing. If you go and look, and I did this the other day with a very well known VC, just for shits and gigs, right? But like if you go and look at the portfolio pages like pick like three well known large VC's, go look at their portfolio companies. I looked at one the other day and they did not have a single company in their portfolio that had launched a token that was within 25% of its all time high. Now, okay, we're early maybe, right? But like here's my question, like should a fund, which I'll give some context, like I have heard of ridiculously high returns for that fund, should a fund do multiple, multiple X's right on their invested capital if every single one of their tokens is down? Only like to me this is a demonstration of something distorted in a capital market, right? Like I'm, and it's not lost upon me that like, you know, VC's often have two or three winners of a ten company portfolio, right, but that's not what, what's happening here, right? Like I'm talking like there are no tokens that are up versus, well not even just versus bitcoin, but versus their all time highs.
00:37:58.824 - 00:38:34.514, Speaker B: And like I think that this really does create like mal incentives and once again you can always just say, well, we're early, these will come back, maybe, but I'm inclined to think that the valuations of these things will never return. And a lot of this is a function also of it being open source software. It's easily commoditizable. This isn't the highly extractive moats that you can build in traditional financial systems. This is quite different. And so, yeah, I don't know, like just that's kind of like food for thought as to how I view tokens, like in aggregate.
00:38:35.174 - 00:39:09.822, Speaker A: Yeah, well let's talk more about that. I'll read another gwart tweet. This is relevant, and only from about a week ago, you said, I wonder if the people who are generally against meme coins but hold coins of real projects realize that there are about zero coins that have made all time highs against bitcoin over multiple cycles. You said, like, you can say your plans are measured in centuries and that you're backing defi tokens for the long run, that's fine. But there's basically no historical precedent for these coins getting value against BTC. You would literally be making history. Are you surprised at all or.
00:39:09.822 - 00:39:46.624, Speaker A: It sounds like you wouldn't be surprised. I mean, again, some people say to me they're surprised that bitcoin is still 50 plus percent of the market cap bitcoin dominance, as they say. I actually think it's much higher if we adjust that metric to remove zero liquidity coins and whatnot. But, you know, it's been 15 years since Satoshi released the bitcoin software to the public and still we don't have. What do we have? You think that we. You said NFTs and that's pretty much it, right? Other than bitcoin and stable coins.
00:39:46.744 - 00:39:49.844, Speaker B: Stable coins, right. Like NFT stable coins, yeah.
00:39:50.464 - 00:40:07.830, Speaker A: And I mean, bitcoin stable coins are basically just bitcoin that is stable. If. If a bitcoin held its value, you could use that. And instead of a dollar collateralized stablecoin. Right. It's just controlling for volatility. It's not particularly interesting technology, you know, beyond what bitcoin offers except for that.
00:40:07.830 - 00:40:08.634, Speaker A: Volatility.
00:40:11.134 - 00:40:39.030, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I got a lot of, like, pushback on that tweet, obviously, which fairly common. But, you know, like, the way that I point, right. I think. Well, I think, like, that should resonate like, that. That should hit hard. I think you should understand that over a four year long time period, like, there have been, like, a handful, literally like under five. I think somebody else point out stacks, which is kind of interesting.
00:40:39.030 - 00:40:57.492, Speaker B: Like, it's probably closer to like, a bitcoin proxy. But. But anyways, like, there have been, like, sub five altcoins that have made multi cycle all time highs against bitcoin. Now, of course, like, the instant reaction is, wow, like, you can do 100 x during, like, one of those cycles. Like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, that's. This is not the point I'm making here.
00:40:57.492 - 00:41:11.460, Speaker B: Right. Like, the point I'm making is, like, we have not really observed sustainability yet with these tokens. Like, we may eventually. Okay. And you guys keep trying. That's fine. But like, we have not yet.
00:41:11.460 - 00:41:30.636, Speaker B: And that should, like, I don't know. I think especially for retail investors, like, if anything, what I would glean from that is, like, you should try to end the bull market with more bitcoin than you started and you win. Like, that's how you win the bull market. If you end up at the end of it after playing all these Ponzi games with more bitcoin. All right, you probably won. So, like, I mean, that. That's.
00:41:30.636 - 00:41:33.092, Speaker B: That would be, like, the takeaway that I would get from that.
00:41:33.268 - 00:42:09.014, Speaker A: Yep. You also tweeted, we'll step back a little because you had this other great tweet about dune two. I just found it. It says, you know what's noticeably absent in all of these movies that depict the future or worlds with advanced technologies? Blockchains. No blockchains. Do you, do you think, again, we've talked about, we don't have to rehash, like, which use cases have salience in adoption today. But are blockchains definitely good? Are they good beyond bitcoin at all? Or do they need to be? Or in 100 years, are we going to be storing large amounts of our wealth on distributed ledgers?
00:42:10.394 - 00:42:51.524, Speaker B: Yeah, I have. This is actually one of these things I kind of go back and forth on, I think, proof of stake blockchains. I don't see these. When you can continue to launch these over and over and over and block space becomes, I think there's been some realization of this within the roll up landscape. And then as people see, there's good quality block space. You know, I think over the long run, a lot of this converges onto similar quality of block space. And then it's sort of like, where's the scarcity coming from when there's, like, the.
00:42:51.524 - 00:43:31.306, Speaker B: The ability to just create infinite blockchains now, like, of course, my bias is ringing in here with, with bitcoin. Like, when you have exogenous, like, drivers energy and, you know, hardware that are inputs, it does make a difference in my mind in terms of, like, the commodity cost of this. With proof of stake block space, I'm like, you know, you can copy and paste this. You can, like, create a roll up in, like, literally 30 seconds. So then it. Then it does become, like, the moat of these systems becomes much more akin to, like, traditional financial modes. And I, you know, I don't know, like, if this is really the vision that I even care about.
00:43:31.306 - 00:44:16.004, Speaker B: Like, I don't know, like, I'm much more interested in, like, maximally open source, like, you know, free like, open technology versus, like, trying to silo off users and, like, create moats around products. It's not, you know, like, it's not lost upon me that, like, this is how the overall majority of people in crypto, like, you know, are trying to make money, is, like, engaging with these teams and, like, applications. But even like, that, this mentality, I think, is, like, it's very vc. Like, it's very Silicon Valley think, boy. Like, you know, you create these moats, you create these network effects. Like, you give out the equity, and, and then it's, like, for what, you know, and, like, a lot of this is modeled off of exactly that. Like, and now we're, we're seeing in tradfi, like, some of the results of this.
00:44:16.004 - 00:44:47.288, Speaker B: Like, is uber really a zero to one unlock? I mean, you know, it's the same price as a taxi now. Like, uber drivers get screwed. Like, it's. It's one of these things that we know. It's this mentality of, like, building out these network effects before realizing, like, just how big of a breakthrough this really is. And that's probably where, like, a lot of my skepticism comes from. And, like, obviously, this is even, like, more pervasive with, like, just the VC kind of, like, you know, having their tentacles on everything in crypto at this point.
00:44:47.456 - 00:45:14.116, Speaker A: This is also related. We take it back to bitcoin. You, I love this. I hadn't actually thought to do this until we started talking, but pulling up some of your favorite, my favorite tweets of yours, you said on January 8, which was sort of as the foundation for the conversation. I mean, on January 8, which is just, I think, three days before the ETF's, the bitcoin ETF's were launched. You said ETF likely approved, mission accomplished, money separated from state, unbanked, or now banked. Not even sure what to do with my time now.
00:45:14.116 - 00:45:49.494, Speaker A: The traditional finance has been dismantled. Obviously, you're mocking the idea that this was, like, you know, some endpoint for Satoshi's creation, you know, to be gobbled up and put inside the traditional financial system. A lot of people, you know, in the bitcoin world that I'm friends with raise this concern with me, like, the same, the same basic criticism, though. Like, is this even, is this good for bitcoin? Let alone is it bad? Is it. Is it remotely good? Um, you know, I have a take on this, but I, you know, people, my audience has heard my takes on stuff. What's your take on the ETF's in general? Do they impede the vision. Does it matter? Is it, is it detrimental or neutral or positive?
00:45:49.834 - 00:46:18.156, Speaker B: I mean, it's, it's not exciting to me. You know, it's like, it's just another one of these things. It's like, it's not, it's not what I, like, got, got me into this. I think it's, you know, it's net positive. Like we need, like, it is net positive. I also think that bitcoin, you know, like if we believe in this, we have to believe that it's robust to Blackrock and Wall street. And, you know, like the dynamics of owning bitcoin, this may be different when we get to like, proof of stake chains and like that.
00:46:18.156 - 00:46:52.932, Speaker B: That would be, that'll be interesting to observe. Right. Like, and especially if there are staked ETF's. But like, owning bitcoin doesn't give you more power over the network. In fact, you know, like Michael Saylor owns a ton of bitcoin and like, his actual, like, tangible impact on, you know, the code base of bitcoin is at least right now, like converges on nothing. Right? And so, and I think this is, this is the idea. So this is what we should hope for, right? And so, I mean, it doesn't, it's not like it's good.
00:46:52.932 - 00:47:17.246, Speaker B: It makes the price go up. That's good. That makes, you know, that, that makes people want to buy it and hold it and it increases like the stability of it. Right? Like I think, I don't know, I know you're more into like the market research side of this stuff. Like I think there's a good chance, like, we don't have these four year cycles anymore. Like they're not going to be like they were before you got like whatever, saudi oil money buying. Like, I think, you know, I don't think we're going to see like crazy, crazy drawdowns anymore.
00:47:17.246 - 00:47:41.354, Speaker B: That's good. Like it, it, it validates the long term store value and increasing stability. Maybe we won't see it go up ten x. Right. But like this is net positive now. I still would, you know, I would say if Wall street starts making, you know, starts merging into core, like, yeah, this, that, that would not be what I came here for.
00:47:41.434 - 00:48:24.126, Speaker A: Yeah, I hear you. No, I mean, I, by the way, on your point about the cycles, I think I mostly agree. I don't, I don't, certainly don't want to say I know, but you have, the ETF buyers are largely, and are going to be, if we look at the broader ETF market they're largely end clients of financial advisors, right? It's financial advisors, raas that are putting them into ETF's and they don't. I mean maybe they rebalance. They have a target and a thesis and they rebalance periodically. That also serves to reduce volatility because if you have say, I want to, I want to have a 1% allocation in my portfolio to bitcoin. Well when bitcoin goes up a lot you actually sell to bring it back down to 1%, but when it goes down a lot you buy to bring it back up to 1%.
00:48:24.126 - 00:48:54.894, Speaker A: So I think broadly volatility would come down as it's more widely held institutionally. And that does, yeah, that does make it better. I mean I think the properties of bitcoin are very very much, fundamentally speaking, like a digital gold. They should be seen and it should be seen and used as a long term store of value because it offers a lot for that. But the volatility is just the main thing that stands in the way of that being, you know, how it's widely thought about. So I do think it's positive. I also like your point on proof of stake networks, capital controls, consensus.
00:48:54.894 - 00:49:40.464, Speaker A: This is one of the things that's the conundrum I see with the Ethereum. ETF's on the one hand, if they don't stake, which it doesn't appear they'll be able to in the US, well then you're kind of paying like a 370 bps or 400 bps a year fee in dilution to hold that ETF instead of if you had bought ETH and staked it yourself on the network. So that's bad. But on the other hand if the ETF's could stake then probably be just a matter of time before the ETF's themselves were like controlling all block production on Ethereum or the vast majority. So it's a little bit of a catch 22 with proof of stake and ETF's which, you know, I guess that's good, right? There's a trade off either way, but you don't have that trade off with bitcoin in the ETF's.
00:49:41.124 - 00:50:11.814, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, I mean like you said, bitcoin definitely resembles digital gold more in this capacity. Right. And like I think minor, you know, like miners being separate from like the network. This is like, this is a good thing, you know, I mean, you know what I'm getting at with regards to like proof of stake, right? Like I have always kind of rejected this notion that like users and, and validators should be the same entity. Like, I don't really think this. Yeah. Like, maybe a much more, like, succinct way to say it is, like, minor cell pressure is good.
00:50:11.814 - 00:50:31.088, Speaker B: Like, this is. This is exactly what we want, right? Like, we want miners dumping coins. It's when they start to hoard coins. Like, that actually is, like, more concerning. Most of them have failed, like, miserably in doing that. Right? Like, they end up, like, way over leveraging, borrowing against their coins, and they get nuked and, like, they have all these miners out, uh, like, on loan. But, um, yeah, like, I think this is, like, a good model.
00:50:31.088 - 00:50:36.164, Speaker B: Right. But it'll be interesting to see with. With Ethereum as well, you know, with. With ETF.
00:50:36.464 - 00:51:07.498, Speaker A: I want to ask you, just because you have looked at and trolled a variety of projects and. And concepts from daos to tokens and do you need a blockchain? You had a great. I love the. Do you need a blockchain? This is something I've been. I wrote a paper at Fidelity in 2017, early 2017, called do you need a blockchain? And looking at that core question, like, at what point do you actually need a token? And there used to be. There was a great academic paper. I forget what it was actually called, but they had a website, do you needablockchain.com,
00:51:07.498 - 00:51:27.944, Speaker A: that took you through their, like, their decision tree of, like, when it did and didn't make sense to have blockchain. You tweeted in November of last year, okay, but why does it need to be on a blockchain? You said, oh, I'm sorry. Do you know of a better place to monetize ideas that are this terrible. What are some of the most terrible ideas in crypto that you've seen?
00:51:28.804 - 00:52:02.370, Speaker B: I mean, like, Luna, like, terra Luna obviously comes to mind as being so patently horrendous. I'm not sold on trading on blockchains, which is, like, a lot of what people do on blockchains, I think, you know, I talk. I interview a lot of people on my podcast about this. Like, I. And it's interesting because I have a lot of people that are work on amms, like automated market makers or, you know, order books or whatever. They may have, like, some preference. And, like, I.
00:52:02.370 - 00:52:38.596, Speaker B: Every time, I'll still ask them, like, what's the future of trading on blockchains? Right? Like, I want to hear their opinion. You know, it's like, it's one of these things where I think it's much easier. We. Maybe I'll rephrase this. I think we have a much better chance at decentralizing money, commodity money, specifically where the inputs are naturally geographically distributed. Right. Ideally we'll see if we can get like the hardware out of one company's hands, but for the most part, like energy being like naturally geographically distributed around the world.
00:52:38.596 - 00:53:59.296, Speaker B: Like I think we have a decent shot at this, right? With, with money finance isn't exactly like money finance actually benefits greatly from consolidation of capital centralization. And then you kind of have to then kind of come back to your question like do we need a blockchain? You kind of have to look at this as a, does the benefits of something being on this distributed ledger that nodes all around the world have to update and agree upon every x amount of seconds? Does this outweigh the cost of having all these distributed nodes around the world and latency concerns and the boxes required to run these and, um, yeah, like I'm, I'm not sure, you know, and I think that this is probably one of my overarching views. Like I sort of hinted at the beginning, right? It's like I'm, when I say I'm not sure, I'm not saying this like I know best, I really, I'm not, I'm not sure yet. I think there will be some long term viable applications of blockchains. But am I saying that because there have been billions upon billions of dollars invested at this point, such, like to the point where it's like, guys, we got to figure out something. I don't know, maybe, right? I think stable coins are obvious. Um, does the, does, do we need global consensus for stable coins? Maybe.
00:53:59.296 - 00:54:49.488, Speaker B: You know, if you're like in a country with like very strict capital controls, I think you're going to want, you know, like a distributed global consensus. If you're in, you know, even slightly lesser, um, authoritarian countries, you can probably do fine with not needing a blockchain. And when I say not needing a blockchain, like there are a lot of benefits to not using a blockchain, right? Like there are a lot of benefits. Whereas you know, I think. And so maybe this comes back to like my, my point with regards to trading. Like uh, it's just like you're, you're always going to run into sophisticated actors in any, anywhere in finance. And there's really not been any example in history of where like finance being decentralized for, for the sake of being decentralized is really like um, had like a net positive impact.
00:54:49.488 - 00:54:56.208, Speaker B: I don't think so. I don't know. Maybe this is, like, bit contentious, but I am willing to, like, feel it out, you know.
00:54:56.336 - 00:55:45.278, Speaker A: No, I think you, I think it's very fair, the criticism you have. You, I will point out to reiterate the point you were making before. Some people, some people, when they say, you know, is it good? I'm not so sure they are implying that it's not good. I think it's, you're pretty upfront about being skeptical, but also not, not knowing on a lot of these. And I think, gosh, we need more of that. I think that maybe that very self aware sort of nature that you have, Gwart, is behind a lot of your criticism because on Twitter, the criticism that you levy through your humorous and satirical trolling tweets, because so many people are out here saying they do know, like, with ultimate certainty, like, XYZ is going to be valuable. Is there, are the crypto, are there, I don't know.
00:55:45.278 - 00:55:52.126, Speaker A: Is there a higher concentration of narcissist geniuses in crypto, or do they just think they are?
00:55:52.270 - 00:56:32.600, Speaker B: It's like, no, I think. I think that, you know what I realized, like, this is, like, some heavy, this is some, like, heavy hitting right here. Like, what I realized eventually is, like, I don't hold, like, I don't have, like, animosity or even, like, I don't think that these people are, like, scammers, right? Like, that's not, if I see something that I'm like, I don't really think this is gonna work in the long run, in my opinion. But my inclination isn't, like, oh, this person's, like, out to grift a lot. Increasingly so in the past, like, the last cycle. And as we mature, there's a lot of brilliant people. Like, truly, I know a lot of these guys.
00:56:32.600 - 00:57:03.902, Speaker B: They are absolutely brilliant people working in this space. And what I realized is, like, a lot of these, this kind of goes back to, like, the distortion of incentives, in my view. Like, a lot of these kids, if you will, you get some kid out of Stanford who's like, 23 years old, and he finds a problem in crypto to solve. Like, so maybe, like, there's a lot of arbitrage going on, on, like some automated market maker, and they're like, oh, I got a solution for this. And they do have a solution. Like, they're gigabrands. They do have a solution, and they actually do build it out.
00:57:03.902 - 00:57:35.824, Speaker B: Well, here's the thing. Like, when these kids say, oh, I have a solution for this, and a VC comes along and says, hey, we'll give you $20 million to build that solution. You start to realize, like, it doesn't really matter if these people are thinking about, like, whether or not this stuff's gonna change the world. They're just kind of like, maximizing their own utility. And, like, I don't ha, I don't hold, like, animosity towards really any, like, people. This stuff doesn't, like, deeply offend me. You know what I mean? Like, I'm not like a scammer.
00:57:35.824 - 00:58:34.322, Speaker B: Scammer. It's just I do think that there's a lot of, like, brilliant people who may miss the forest for the trees, right. And like, it's like, okay, so what are we trying to do here? And, like, what are we trying to do to achieve it? And, like, that chasm oftentimes, like, you get so deep in the mechanism design space, you get so deep in, like, the game theory and stuff, and you come out the other side, you're like, okay, wait, what have we just spent all this time and money on? Right? And that's probably, like, the root of a lot of my, a lot of my, like, you know, skepticism or trolling or whatever. And then I will add one other point which is, like, slightly more contentious. You know, like, I think if you, and I'm not picky, like, don't assume that I'm picking on anybody in particular right now. I'm, like, leaving this very vague. But, like, if there's a founder who makes a ton of money, I think in capitalism, like, in efficient markets, you should have to have provided a ton of value.
00:58:34.322 - 00:59:16.430, Speaker B: Like, so if you get extremely rich, you better have done something extremely valuable. And so I think what happens with tokens is that, like, with this early liquidity incentives, right? Maybe this stuff does ultimately. And like I said, I'm saying, like, I'm willing to say maybe, but maybe in ten years, this stuff is extremely valuable and it really does, like, like, help build, like, this is the public goods of the future. Maybe that's the case. But my view is, like, I don't know that you should be really rich yet. You should be really rich once this has provided a tremendous amount of value. And if you look at the overwhelming majority of crypto applications, they have 2000 daily active users.
00:59:16.430 - 00:59:49.310, Speaker B: 3000 daily active users. Their chart of TVL is, you know, starts at the top left and goes down to the bottom right. It's like, we need to be, like, we need to be honest about this, right? Like, we need to be like, I do find that that probably is what gets under my skin the most. I would say, to the extent that anything gets under my skin, that does bother me. Like, I don't think you should get extremely rich unless you've done something extremely valuable for mankind. And, like, crypto distorts this. Like, it screws it all up.
00:59:49.382 - 01:00:24.774, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I hear you. The time to liquidity, as they say, or the time to exit for the investors is so heightened when you have tokens that it can create those distortions. All right, guar, before we wrap, you did just launch this great podcast you've had, Tarun Chitra. You had, I think, the first episode you had Eric Wall. You recently had my former employee Walt Smith on your, which I listened to some of. He surprisingly didn't really mention his galaxy research background, although he did also work in prop trading and venture at Galaxy. I'm just ribbing on Walt.
01:00:24.774 - 01:00:50.596, Speaker A: And you have this with block space media. I think it's really great. You have a lot of very smart people come on and talk, as you mentioned, some of the smart people that you talk to. What is next for Gwart? What's the next thing? I mean, you've got this widely followed and very entertaining and incisive Twitter presence. You've got a very high, I would say, highbrow intellectual blockchain technology podcast. Do you have further plans for gwart?
01:00:50.660 - 01:01:14.716, Speaker B: No, I think, I mean, the podcast was something fun that I would. I always saw, like, okay, I'll be really, really good at this, right? Like, everybody thinks this, like, oh, I'll crush a podcast. And so. But then I talked to will, like, the producer, and he was like, oh, dude, you'd crush a podcast. And I was like, I know. I always thought that. Right? And so it's just been, like, a fun pet project thus far and really like it.
01:01:14.716 - 01:01:51.942, Speaker B: It's conversations that I would just enjoy having anyways. And I think that, yeah, like, a lot of the more crypto, sort of centric podcasts, like, I find, you know, there's a lot of good ones, like, honestly, there's a lot of good ones that also, like, reduce fairly complicated ideas down to, like, pretty, you know, comprehensible, like, for, like, you know, your average person. It's not, like, really my goal. My goal is, like, to kind of be absurd with. With people who I think are, like, quite sharp in this. In this space. And then.
01:01:51.942 - 01:02:04.404, Speaker B: Yeah, like, I don't. I don't really have any other plans. Like, I'm not. I'm not starting a vc. What? Like, mainly what you'd expect the person to act like behind the account on Twitter is pretty much what I, you know.
01:02:06.544 - 01:02:33.094, Speaker A: Well, I've enjoyed it. I hope there is like a guard tv show where we find out or we find out that you're like an expert in Call of Duty and we get you giving these takes while you stream on Twitch or something. Cause I have enjoyed the rise of of Internet guard. So I was saying Gwart, well known Internet troll and critic and observer of blockchain tech. Gwart, thank you so much for coming on. Galaxy brains.
