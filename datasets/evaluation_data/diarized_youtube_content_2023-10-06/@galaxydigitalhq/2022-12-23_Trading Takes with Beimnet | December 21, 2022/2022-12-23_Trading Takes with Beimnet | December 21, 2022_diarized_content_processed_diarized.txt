00:00:06.680 - 00:00:11.806, Speaker A: Bimnet Abibi, our friend from Galaxy Digital trading. Great to have you as always. How are you doing?
00:00:11.910 - 00:00:13.406, Speaker B: Doing great, how are you doing?
00:00:13.470 - 00:00:17.262, Speaker A: I'm great too. I'm excited. Beautiful. This is our year end episode.
00:00:17.358 - 00:00:19.478, Speaker B: I'm so pumped you got a lot.
00:00:19.486 - 00:00:44.984, Speaker A: Of fans out there in podcast land and normally we sort of keep it a bit tight. We say, what happened last week? What did Jay Powell say today? Et cetera. But I'm thinking more, I'd love to. When you look back at this crazy year, 2022, in markets, not just crypto of course, but in macro and everywhere else, I don't know, what's your big takeaway? I don't know how to ask this question, but like 2022 speak.
00:00:45.404 - 00:01:35.264, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I mean this year I would say that the biggest thing that happened was the cracking of the bond market. Basically the massive shift that you've had from super easy monetary policy to the complete opposite. I mean before this year you were in a 30 40 year bull market in bonds and the whole world is long bonds like crazy. And all of a sudden the Fed jacked up rates to four 5%. And that had a huge impact on basically everything. The dollar went crazy. You had things like the pound crashing dollar yen, forcing a bank of Japan intervention in their currency market, not just once, but twice.
00:01:35.264 - 00:02:29.918, Speaker B: And so it's been a year that I would say where everybody had to reconsider basically every investment on the planet, because the opportunity cost of money went sky high. Every investment has to be pegged to interest rates. And when interest rates are four or 5%, that means those projects need to be earning a lot more. And so what higher interest rates have caused is just a recalibration of every investment to account for the opportunity cost of money. And that's been pretty transformational. The other big thing was just the idea of hard assets and commodities. When you're at war, you really care about getting food and oil.
00:02:29.918 - 00:03:23.856, Speaker B: And minor disruptions in this causes huge delays in semiconductors. And so I think given the Russia Crimea stuff and kind of the huge moves you had in commodities, I think a lot of investors have a newfound appreciation for commodities and real world assets. Just think about it. All of the guys that were about ESG investing this year got wrecked. If you weren't in energy because you were like, it's bad for the environment, well that meant your returns were lower, but moving on. So you had that sort of us jacking up rates, they lead the way, the US central bank always leads others. And that basically caused everyone from the Canadians, New Zealand, EM countries, they all started jacking up their rates, and if they didn't, their currency was gonna collapse.
00:03:23.856 - 00:04:09.054, Speaker B: And you finally, the last straw, or the last thing to drop was the bank of Japan. And they just did it yesterday, literally just to beat the year end mark. They adjusted their yield curve control policy from 25 basis point cap on tens to 50 is the first sort of hawkish shift you had in the BOJ. And they're the last remaining. They're still on negative interest rates in the front end. In a world where their inflation is not only continually going up, but it's actually accelerating in the data, that's crazy. And so, yeah, I mean, it's crazy to me because when you juxtapose that with where we were during COVID which was just like, here's bond buying programs, we're buying 120 billion per month.
00:04:09.054 - 00:04:47.804, Speaker B: You had negative interest rate policy priced in the US briefly. That was 2020. But yeah, but still, you went from all this easy money, crazy amount of like, everything's going up forever, venture investments, trading at ridiculous valuations to guys, no, we can't do that. There are issues with just printing money like crazy. And obviously this deleveraging has impacted crypto as well. That's why largely speaking, the move in interest rates is what's caused the role in equities and other risk assets, venture investments, et cetera. But yeah, that's the main story.
00:04:47.804 - 00:05:42.096, Speaker B: And now, in terms of where we're going from here, it really depends on what inflation does domestically and abroad. There's a path towards a soft landing in the US. I think it's very feasible, and that's kind of what the market is pricing in and what the sort of forecasts that the Fed are providing price. They're basically saying unemployment's going to get to four seven and you're going to see some slowdown in growth, but it's not going to be a collapse. And stocks are trading at fine multiples here. Breakeven inflations are telling you you're going to get to within spitting distance of the Fed's inflation target. And so the market's like, yeah, soft landing seems feasible and is the likely outcome that's being priced.
00:05:42.096 - 00:05:57.954, Speaker B: And if you. Not to get too granular, but in terms of a hard landing scenario, I think that in my head and in the market's head, which I kind of agree with right now, that's probably like a 20% probability. Wow, maybe 25, 2020.
00:05:57.994 - 00:06:03.514, Speaker A: 5% of a hard landing and the 75% of a soft landing is how the market is currently viewing it, depending.
00:06:03.554 - 00:06:33.114, Speaker B: On how you look at it. The way I think about it is what are the low delta? Or what's the implied probability that the s and P goes to 3300, or the implied probability that the Fed cuts by 150 basis points or more? Those markets and look at those option curves and try to bake in or try to extract out like a probability that's kind of where I'm getting to 20% ish.
00:06:33.154 - 00:06:40.334, Speaker A: Wow. That's extremely bullish. Or on the market's view, right? I don't know if it is bullish. I mean, it's optimistic. Let me put it that way.
00:06:40.754 - 00:06:48.890, Speaker B: It is optimistic. There's a lot of people, you get a lot more headlines being like, doomsday, this thing's going, oh, man.
00:06:48.962 - 00:06:54.516, Speaker A: How many people? First of all, there's been the long term ones that were. Yeah, you know, the broken clock has been right twice a day.
00:06:54.580 - 00:06:55.004, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:06:55.084 - 00:07:07.172, Speaker A: They've been bearish for, you know, they missed the entire run up from the last recession until 2021. And then all those guys came back. And then you get a whole new class of these doomsayers.
00:07:07.228 - 00:07:07.868, Speaker B: No, absolutely.
00:07:07.916 - 00:07:15.572, Speaker A: I mean, you also get the crypts, crypto fudsters, these guys that come out of the woodwork. You know, they're on Twitter, they use the alarm and the asterisks as if.
00:07:15.588 - 00:07:25.578, Speaker B: They'Re like a Bloomberg squawker, I gotta tell you. I mean, it's a bull market for bearishness. That's a bull market for Fud.
00:07:25.666 - 00:07:26.138, Speaker A: Yeah, it is.
00:07:26.186 - 00:07:26.666, Speaker B: Yes.
00:07:26.770 - 00:07:27.146, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:27.210 - 00:07:28.642, Speaker B: And Fud sells.
00:07:28.698 - 00:07:32.138, Speaker A: And you're saying the data doesn't really support that level of barrier.
00:07:32.186 - 00:07:32.802, Speaker B: It does not.
00:07:32.858 - 00:07:33.202, Speaker A: Negative.
00:07:33.258 - 00:07:52.378, Speaker B: I mean, like, the guy that's saying stuff's gonna be fine is not gonna be the guy that you're listening to or like, clicking the article. Yeah, guys, things are gonna be okay. Chill out. That's not a headline you wanna click. But it's kind of shaping up that way here abroad. The story is rest of world. Oh, my God, it's so complicated.
00:07:52.378 - 00:08:31.212, Speaker B: You have, like some places in the eurozone with high teens, low twenties, I think, inflation, and they have all these weird risks. It's like, who really wants to buy italian bonds? I'll tell you, nobody but the ECB. And so it's like, wait, the gilt market exploded when we took a step back in Japan. It's like, well, they own 50% of basically a ton of their asset markets owned by the BoJack. It's like, well, if we start shifting, like, what does that do, right. And the problem is you have just such entrenched behavior that still isn't out of the market.
00:08:31.308 - 00:08:31.540, Speaker A: Right.
00:08:31.572 - 00:09:01.100, Speaker B: Like when you were programmed to think bonds only rally and interest rates stay low forever, and you do all of your financial planning in that current world. Like you're not set up yet. Like if you're a 30 year, like if you're an insurance company that's managing 2030 year liabilities and you've been doing it for 2030 years, and you're just like, oh, it's easy, just buy long dated bonds. Well, no, those things are about to sell off like crazy and they're not set up for it.
00:09:01.132 - 00:09:06.020, Speaker A: Entire economies and national economic strategies were based around those assumptions.
00:09:06.052 - 00:09:24.720, Speaker B: Absolutely. I mean, just take the simple bank model. Take your deposits, pay you next to nothing, and buy super long dated bond bonds. Or like much further out the curve. Now, the liability costs you more than what you're generating on the assets and that's like how you get to be insolvent.
00:09:24.832 - 00:09:25.904, Speaker A: Yeah, that's awful.
00:09:25.984 - 00:09:46.624, Speaker B: Right? And so we have to, there's still parts of the world that have to go through that correction. And then you throw in sort of the commodity supercycle that might not super cycle. That's, I don't want to use, like lots of guys use paradigm shift. Like crazy. Like you read about paradigm shifts. That's like, that's a big statement. That's a big, big statement.
00:09:46.624 - 00:09:56.394, Speaker B: But the commodities, the commodities can, I think there's a risk that you get further sort of upside. And a lot of commodities think this.
00:09:56.554 - 00:10:01.774, Speaker A: Smart people like you have said this, even like Zoltan has been talking about.
00:10:02.194 - 00:10:11.938, Speaker B: The big headline is Jeffrey Curry at Goldman. He's their commodities analyst. He was really good early in the year, last year, super bullish oil, and.
00:10:11.946 - 00:10:17.002, Speaker A: He was pulling what, 43% appreciation in commodities in 2023 is his prediction.
00:10:17.058 - 00:10:39.624, Speaker B: That's his prediction. You know what, there's a healthy two way risk to that prediction, but I am inclined to think that that number sounds feasible to me. Think about this. A quarter or a fifth of humanity is about to reopen. There's like literally 1.3 billion people that have been trapped at home in China. In China, yeah.
00:10:39.624 - 00:10:42.824, Speaker B: Not doing anything and saving money and working.
00:10:42.984 - 00:10:45.160, Speaker A: Are they really gonna reopen though? Haven't we heard this?
00:10:45.232 - 00:10:53.968, Speaker B: Everything points that way now. It's like nowadays, I mean, it's happening. And like once you let the genie out the bottle, like why?
00:10:54.096 - 00:10:54.616, Speaker A: I agree.
00:10:54.680 - 00:10:56.816, Speaker B: Right? And you remember in the US when.
00:10:56.840 - 00:11:02.084, Speaker A: We reopened, it was masks off. And now it's like, nope, there's nothing they could do.
00:11:02.784 - 00:11:03.848, Speaker B: Partying in the streets.
00:11:03.896 - 00:11:09.768, Speaker A: Yeah, they would have to really, really go hard to actually put us back. Yeah, I mean it would take a lot.
00:11:09.816 - 00:11:10.496, Speaker B: I mean think about it.
00:11:10.520 - 00:11:12.040, Speaker A: It would literally take like police on the street.
00:11:12.112 - 00:11:47.972, Speaker B: Imagine like chinese people were protesting like crazy. They were, and it was hitting the media. And like that's the big risk if you're communist party, et cetera. And so when you have a fifth of humanity about to go crazy after saving a bunch of money, buy stuff. Buy stuff. Travel, ride cars, goods, yeah, I mean that's going to put some upward pressure on commodities most likely. And then the question is, okay, well if oil starts to go crazy again, does inflation in the US come back? And then it's like, holy shit, part.
00:11:47.988 - 00:11:48.844, Speaker A: Of the CPI, right?
00:11:48.884 - 00:11:56.420, Speaker B: Yeah, well, yeah, if you're looking at headline, I mean, I don't even know why they strip out energy. People spend money on gas. Like I care about how much money I spend on gas.
00:11:56.452 - 00:11:57.004, Speaker A: Me too.
00:11:57.124 - 00:12:05.612, Speaker B: Right. And it feeds into all the other goods and stuff and it's like, you know, core CPI nonsense. So it's like a legacy number.
00:12:05.668 - 00:12:29.296, Speaker A: This is sort of a big, I don't know what the word is, but like sort of question mark then how the China reopening actually affects, I mean thrown out one, right, the commodity, upward pressure on commodities prices is one, but also the ripple effects, it could affect the supply chain again, if all of a sudden they need to get a ton of stuff in by boat or out by boat, the whole big question mark for how that impacts 23.
00:12:29.400 - 00:12:30.136, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:12:30.200 - 00:12:30.804, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:12:31.624 - 00:12:50.664, Speaker B: But all I know for sure is that interest rates are high. And if you think about it, you're not really taking risk. If you go buy a six month t bill and earn four and a half percent, that's four and a half percent that you're making without taking any risk.
00:12:50.744 - 00:12:59.944, Speaker A: So the risk to treasury specifically, right, is a us default. When we say, like when you and everyone else says that treasuries are risk free, it's because what has that ever happened?
00:12:59.984 - 00:13:02.684, Speaker B: It's really because the Fed can just buy them.
00:13:03.344 - 00:13:07.304, Speaker A: Well, because the risk is so low because we have our own money printer.
00:13:07.384 - 00:13:35.662, Speaker B: Yes, basically. Well, it's because us is the dominant sort of monetary system in the world. But it's also if you're worried you don't even have to go that far out in duration, you can buy a short dated one and you're not taking any term risk. You'll get the money back in six months and we're just talking about the US credit. If you go up the credit stack of like corporate or you know, and you get more yields or like mortgage.
00:13:35.788 - 00:13:42.770, Speaker A: Like AAA, cos it just makes it really hard for getting your returns out of like asset risk. Asset appreciation.
00:13:42.882 - 00:13:43.218, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:43.266 - 00:13:46.362, Speaker A: When you can put stuff in very low risk stuff that just pays you money.
00:13:46.418 - 00:13:56.666, Speaker B: Yeah, that's the risk adjusted returns. Don't make like investing in like a crazy tech company like that worth it right now. Like, I just, I don't see it.
00:13:56.770 - 00:14:01.934, Speaker A: So how long does this last though? Is it until rates come down or is it until they stabilize at a level?
00:14:02.514 - 00:14:28.702, Speaker B: I mean, here's the thing, here's the risk to the risk assets. Essentially the Fed's telling you they're going to go higher for longer and they want to keep rates high. And let's just say the fed realizes they could keep rates high and shit's fine. People don't go crazy, unemployment doesn't go crazy if that happens. And they realize if that happens.
00:14:28.818 - 00:14:29.118, Speaker A: Right.
00:14:29.166 - 00:14:48.234, Speaker B: And what you're sacrificing is really like a little bit of growth upfront. The question is, are you sacrificing like big picture, like long term huge productivity gains by having front end rates so high and the cost of money so high for a really long period of time? Right.
00:14:49.094 - 00:14:56.142, Speaker A: So you're saying like we lose out on like the investment in new technologies that will yield huge benefit years in the future? Is that the idea?
00:14:56.158 - 00:15:39.814, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, that's a pretty big thing. That's a risk. The reason fundamentally, I was having a debate on the desk about us dominance and why us dominance is going to continue. People can point to, we got nukes, we got aircraft carriers, we have the Federal Reserve, like the Swift system, et cetera. But really, for me, you know what? It comes down to Silicon Valley. We got the best tech, the best brains, and you pull tons of talent together and you build cool stuff that everyone on the planet uses, that ability to innovate your way into growth and revenues. Apple is basically a giant country.
00:15:39.814 - 00:15:53.136, Speaker B: How did that come about? That comes from a capital market and capital formation aided by low interest rates and deeply hindered by high ones.
00:15:53.200 - 00:15:56.376, Speaker A: I see, that's very interesting. Right?
00:15:56.400 - 00:16:03.056, Speaker B: And so that's not necessarily how the Fed thinks about it, but that's how I think about it.
00:16:03.080 - 00:16:03.720, Speaker A: That's a risk.
00:16:03.832 - 00:16:05.496, Speaker B: That's a risk. It's like, who wants to?
00:16:05.560 - 00:16:11.936, Speaker A: And it's not that it goes away, but it's sort of like how much do we lose a period of time, right? While we're not like, if I'm a.
00:16:11.960 - 00:16:16.752, Speaker B: Big money manager, it's like, am I gonna throw money into venture? Especially in the year, the kind of.
00:16:16.768 - 00:16:19.016, Speaker A: Year that venture is that this year.
00:16:19.160 - 00:16:20.728, Speaker B: No, stick it in bonds.
00:16:20.776 - 00:16:21.336, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:21.480 - 00:16:22.184, Speaker B: Take no risk.
00:16:22.224 - 00:16:28.080, Speaker A: And that means fewer companies getting founded, fewer entrepreneurs. Right. Like, slowly.
00:16:28.192 - 00:16:34.044, Speaker B: Think about a regular company, Microsoft. They always have an investment trip. Do I invest in research and development.
00:16:34.384 - 00:16:37.952, Speaker A: Or do I do my core thing?
00:16:38.048 - 00:16:43.384, Speaker B: Like, do I just return money to my shareholders, or do I buy back my own debt? Like, there's so many.
00:16:43.464 - 00:17:13.204, Speaker A: And it's hard. If you are looking at that question and you've got, let's say, I feel. Harvard business school calls it the golden like ratio. I forget what it is. Maybe it's 15%. They suggest that, like, every mature company should be investing in R and D, right, and disrupting themselves. But it's like, if you got to cut a bunch of money or cut back on your opex, it looks like something you might not need a nice to have, perhaps not a need to have, but that has a long term effect, perhaps, on discoveries not being made, new science not being developed, et cetera.
00:17:13.204 - 00:17:17.384, Speaker A: That's a really interesting side effect. I hadn't thought about of high front end rates.
00:17:17.964 - 00:17:24.104, Speaker B: Absolutely. And it's also, I mean, I don't know, I feel like I don't need to learn to code right now. Have you seen this?
00:17:26.084 - 00:17:36.340, Speaker A: I haven't seen. Is this a meme now that you don't need to, because it used to be like, from 2010 to 2020, every kid who says, well, what should I major in? You were like, engineering. Yeah.
00:17:36.372 - 00:17:40.012, Speaker B: And now I'm like, development. Learn how to, like, use this. Yeah.
00:17:40.108 - 00:17:42.508, Speaker A: I mean, can chat GPT code for us? It's a good question.
00:17:42.556 - 00:17:44.228, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
00:17:44.276 - 00:17:44.904, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:45.244 - 00:17:46.948, Speaker B: I mean, I just. Yes.
00:17:47.036 - 00:17:49.452, Speaker A: All right, well, this has been a fun conversation a little.
00:17:49.508 - 00:17:51.700, Speaker B: I could go for hours, honestly. This is.
00:17:51.732 - 00:18:00.892, Speaker A: I know, but we got a bunch of other people to get to, so thank you, Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Digital trading. As always, my friend, and have a great holiday and new year.
