00:00:08.119 - 00:00:12.078, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from galaxy training. As always, Bimnet. Welcome to Galaxy brains.
00:00:12.166 - 00:00:13.006, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:13.070 - 00:00:19.886, Speaker A: It's been an exciting week. What's been going on in macro since last week? Anything notable to talk about?
00:00:20.030 - 00:00:54.624, Speaker B: Yeah, the main thing that I've been kind of focusing on is kind of the weakness in the dollar. Right. Structurally, we've been in a dollar bull market basically since the Fed started raising rates. But now that they've kind of signaled that they are most likely done with hiking, we've seen a major reversal in the dollar. The two big ones that I've been paying attention to has been dollar China. That's come off a lot, and dollar yen, obviously. We were talking about currency intervention a couple of weeks ago.
00:00:54.624 - 00:01:09.516, Speaker B: You know, is the Japanese, are they going to move aggressively off yield curve control or not? But long story short, you've seen an aggressive move in the dollar. Dollar yen has gone from 151 and change to 147 and change, and that's a big move in g ten FX.
00:01:09.580 - 00:01:10.092, Speaker A: That's a lot.
00:01:10.148 - 00:01:52.912, Speaker B: And it signals that the market does believe that the Fed's likely done. You've also seen decent moves in g ten FX and things like cable and euro off the lows. And I think when you pair that with the kind of market reaction you've had recently in the rate market, I think it's appropriately justified. Twos have been consistently below 5%, and you've seen the back end take out significant technical levels. So 450 was a big technical level on tens. You're trading at 441 now. And so the pressure of the back end supply and back end bonds breaking has abated a bit as well.
00:01:52.912 - 00:02:31.104, Speaker B: And so what you've seen is a turn in the dollar and a turn in rates, and that's been a function of a turn in Fed signaling and a turn in the data that we've seen. And I think given the current levels, I think market pricing is kind of fair. But you've got over 100 basis points of cuts priced in over the next twelve months or so, and that's a lot. But in terms of what we're seeing in the data right now and what we're likely going to see in the data going forward, I think that market reaction is probably appropriate.
00:02:31.604 - 00:03:03.530, Speaker A: So it's just an ongoing story too, and nothing, I wouldn't say this sounds similar to what you've been saying. So whereas we sort of that structural shift we've talked about really happened a couple weeks ago, correct? What about cryptocurrency? Markets. I think here we are basically thirty seven k at bitcoin, a rising channel, clearly like higher lows but not breaking out. Since we did break out altcoins, what rotated a bit but now also cooling off.
00:03:03.682 - 00:03:26.594, Speaker B: Absolutely. Yeah. So I think in crypto, the bull trend is still in place, as you've said, higher and higher lows moving, average support holding, and you're setting marginally higher highs. High level. I love bitcoin. I think it's going higher. It's going to go trade at new all time highs eventually.
00:03:26.594 - 00:04:17.874, Speaker B: But the indicators that I look for in a market being stretched are definitely being ticked off, overbought on a lot of technical indicators. Funding having gotten elevated, volume having gotten elevated, spot being at local highs, meme tokens pumping like crazy and alt pumping like crazy. And so those checkboxes for a trade being stretched have been hit. Right. And so I think what you're really seeing now in crypto is really just still a lack of sellers. Right. If you really believe in the bitcoin story, if you really think we're going to add billions of dollars in aum to these new ETF products eventually and that, you know, the halving is going to create a huge supply shock you.
00:04:17.874 - 00:05:02.698, Speaker B: There's no reason to really get out at 37,000. And if you just think about the perspective of most investors, right, everybody that's been involved in crypto is averaged in overtime. You know, some people bought, you know, at 10,000, at 20, at 30, 40, 50, 60, et cetera. A lot of people have blended averages that are around here. And so why are you really going to sell going into a big catalyst event? And also, if you believe that central banks are turning, which they are, right, Europe is continuing to have weak data. China's having weak data. Us has likely stopped hiking turn happening with central bankers.
00:05:02.698 - 00:05:27.370, Speaker B: And typically when central bankers turn, that's your signal to buy risk assets, largely speaking asset prices. I'm not saying everything's a ponzi, but there's a lot of, let's say, froth in the market. And the question is, with the Fed, are they trying to get rid of that froth or are they okay with the current level of froth and the conditions? And they told you they're okay with that level of froth, right?
00:05:27.402 - 00:05:30.596, Speaker A: Because they're really focused on employment and on inflation.
00:05:30.730 - 00:06:06.758, Speaker B: Yeah, but here's the thing. They're traders as much as anyone else. They get a negative payrolls print, right. People start losing jobs and the headlines start to be about, oh, people are losing jobs, they're struggling. Seems like, oh, there's more job losses ahead. Housing market starts to crack a little bit. They will be so quick to flinch that people will have no idea what hit them because at the end of the day, like, you know, they are supposed to be independent and supposed to engage in monetary policy in a way that's not short term thinking, but long.
00:06:06.806 - 00:06:08.086, Speaker A: Term cold and academic.
00:06:08.150 - 00:06:12.118, Speaker B: And academic. But when people start losing jobs, it's a big deal.
00:06:12.206 - 00:06:12.574, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:12.654 - 00:07:12.506, Speaker B: And that's when they hear it from every single person. And that's what hits home the most. And the other thing to keep in mind is that recovery in the economy and just the way the US is structured right now, it's a tale of two cities, right? The lower income brackets. You've already started to see such a material downturn in some of the important metrics that you think about, right? The credit card delinquencies for folks, the auto delinquencies, the portion of money they have to spend on rents. And God forbid you throw in a weak labor market on top of that and people start getting laid off aggressively, there's going to be a ton of folks that are just so uncomfortable. And is it the Fed's mandate to really think about that lower income stuff they've told you? Yes. Before they did a major shift in their economic policy a couple years ago where they're like, oh, we want the recovery to be broad based.
00:07:12.506 - 00:08:18.088, Speaker B: We want to look at measures like hispanic unemployment, african american unemployment, like all of these things. So they have a history of having a qualitative approach as well as a quantitative approach to engaging in monetary policy. So when you start to see layoffs, aggressive ones, and not labor unions getting 40% raises, I think the turn is going to be much more dramatic than people anticipate. And so long story short, cutting rates and the treasury being less aggressive with back end supply and inflation, that's not ripping higher is going to be constructive for risk assets. And basically it's just, and then you throw in the fiscal dominance side, there's going to be lots of reasons why you'd want to own bitcoin. Understood. And so, yeah, I mean, it's this asset, it's just set up so well to move higher, especially once an ETF launches and you get the Fed turn at some point next year in a much more aggressive way.
00:08:18.088 - 00:08:36.013, Speaker B: Things like gold will rip, silver will rip, like dollars will sell, more hard assets will go bid at some point. And so I just, you know, I remain constructive on this market, but short term cautious because of just how quickly we've come up and some of the indicators that are flashing yellow right now.
