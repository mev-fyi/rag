00:00:00.800 - 00:00:13.770, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, an infinite amount of cash. Cash. I'm your host, Alex Thornton. The us banking system is sound and resilient. Bitcoin made a new all time high. If you're not long. If you're not long, you're short.
00:00:14.110 - 00:00:17.798, Speaker B: Satoshi's gonna come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet.
00:00:17.894 - 00:00:19.646, Speaker C: All bitcoin's gonna be erased.
00:00:19.838 - 00:00:31.962, Speaker A: Bitcoin. Bitcoin's the best crypto else. Bitcoin is going to zero. Welcome back to Galaxy Brains. I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy. Bitcoin, not zero. And we have a great episode for you.
00:00:31.962 - 00:01:14.038, Speaker A: Back in New York. We have Willem Schroe, co founder and CEO of Botanics Labs, which is building an innovative new type of bitcoin L2 network called a spider chain, not a roll up. Very interesting conversation with him. I encourage you to listen to that, to understand the sort of breadth of things people are building in this emerging bitcoin L2 landscape. And of course, we'll check with our good friend Bimnet Abibi from galaxy trading, as always, to talk about markets. The sort of majority, even panicky move that happened over the weekend and earlier this week driven at least the straw that broke the camel's back was the japanese interest rate hike and the unwind of this dollar yen carry trade or the yen based carry trade. We'll get Bimnet to explain what that means.
00:01:14.038 - 00:01:48.970, Speaker A: Before we get to that, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to the disclaimer in the podcast notes. And note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by galaxy or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Feels good to be back in the studio, Phineas. But I have to say, shout out to Phineas and his team for the excellent quality of our Nashville tapes, which have now fully run. Check out the feed. We had great interviews with Dylan Leclair, Casey Rodemore, Craig Wormke, Stephen Lubka, Christian Catalini and Harry Sudock that were really great. So thank you to Phineas and his team for helping to make that possible.
00:01:48.970 - 00:01:57.034, Speaker A: Let's hop right into the show. Let's go now to our guest, Bim Netabibi from Galaxy training. As always, bimnet. Welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:01:57.122 - 00:01:57.898, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:01:57.954 - 00:02:02.854, Speaker A: We're back. We are here in New York City. I haven't been in this city for over a month.
00:02:02.982 - 00:02:03.998, Speaker C: I haven't left.
00:02:04.134 - 00:02:06.214, Speaker A: There you go. You've been tied to the desk.
00:02:06.382 - 00:02:07.558, Speaker C: I say chained.
00:02:07.654 - 00:02:08.046, Speaker A: Chained.
00:02:08.118 - 00:02:08.862, Speaker C: Imprisoned.
00:02:08.966 - 00:02:10.198, Speaker A: Well, that's what. Let's talk about it.
00:02:10.214 - 00:02:10.934, Speaker C: Incarcerated.
00:02:11.022 - 00:02:48.340, Speaker A: Let's talk about it. Because it was sleepy, then it was bullish. Leading into Nashville, and Nashville, we touched 70k on bitcoin on the back of former President Donald Trump's speech in Nashville. And then we were mostly okay last week, and then over the weekend, and even at the end of last week, some deleveraging started to happen. And then, of course, there was a pretty major crash in equities, in cryptos, in bitcoin on Sunday night, Monday morning. Yeah, in FX. What happened?
00:02:50.320 - 00:02:54.224, Speaker C: Yeah, there's just so many things to talk about.
00:02:54.392 - 00:02:56.664, Speaker A: Let's start with Japan, though. What happened with the yen?
00:02:56.752 - 00:03:58.984, Speaker C: So, basically, for the past year and a half dollar, yen has been steadily inching higher from, let's say, the 130s all the way up to 161. That's a function of the fact that us interest rates and other g ten interest rates were significantly higher than japanese interest rates. Japanese interest rates were below zero, essentially were slowly raising them by ten basis points and a little bit more. But essentially, because of that huge interest rate differential, folks were constantly longing dollars and shorting yen and earning the carry. The most popular carry trade was Mexy, where super high interest in Mex and super cheap cost to borrow on the yen. And so there are a lot of folks piled into the trade. Over the past year, the BOJ has tried a handful of times to intervene, but ultimately it failed because the currency just kept going higher.
00:03:58.984 - 00:05:14.652, Speaker C: And so it reached new highs. And so going into the BOJ meeting last week, they were expected to hike rates and kind of slowed their bond purchases and broadly take a step back from all the easing measures that they have. And they came out more hawkish than expected. And basically that started a huge deleveraging in that complex and so high level. What the carry trade is in the context of the BOJ is folks borrow yen at super cheap levels, then they sell it short to go buy a different currency, and then they go buy an asset with that currency. And so basically, there's a lot of money that was in Japan that got moved offshore because there's no place to actually earn any substantial interest on that money. And so over the past 1520 years, right, there's been a lot of money just going from Japan offshore to purchase these assets and to conduct this quote, unquote, carry trade.
00:05:14.652 - 00:06:11.518, Speaker C: And what happens when the yen starts massively appreciating is your liability starts ticking up in value. And then in addition, when the asset that you've purchased also starts going down in value, let's say us equities or commercial real estate, whatever it may be, you got hit with a double whammy and then margin calls and then cycle of deleveraging. And so you basically had, you know, the start of a very big unwind. You know, the way I describe it is, you know, this dollar yen trade, like basically front end interest rates in Japan have been sub 1% for my entire lifetime, basically. And so that carry trade has been building for 20 years. And you know, over the past week, two weeks, you've had an unwind to that. But it's just getting going, right? And so all these dollars that have flown offshore and to the US, et cetera.
00:06:11.518 - 00:06:56.930, Speaker C: And basically what's happening is these corporates need to bring back some of the money home and these pensions, et cetera. And so this repatriation flow has caused a bid to the yen and it caused risk assets to sell off. Now the risk asset sell off is a function of the BOJ stuff, but it's also a function of the data that you got in the US. And the data is constantly been slowing on a consistent basis here in the several months now. Yeah, a couple of months. And you had this non farm payrolls print on Friday that showed material weakness in the labor market even though it was a gain of like 113,000 jobs. Like the private sector component was particularly weak.
00:06:56.930 - 00:08:10.550, Speaker C: And we've seen some other jolts and other kind of labor market indicators that are softening. And typically the concerns around the softening labor market are super important because the Fed has a dual mandate, inflation and full employment. And so in instances where unemployment starts ticking up, that starts to trigger like, holy shit, am I going to be on the wrong side of my mandate? And that specifically was what Powell highlighted during the last FOMC as something that would trigger him to be more dovish or to remove restrictive measures of a monetary policy. And so everyone is focused on the labor market because if it cracks, then the Fed will be forced to be more dovish. And now what the read through was from that soft print was that you could potentially be heading into a hard landing scenario. And that's based on the fact that typically when I, you know, you see unemployment rise by 50 basis points or so, you're likely going to see there's normally a bimodal distribution, basically. So you're most likely going to see a big uptick in unemployment.
00:08:10.550 - 00:08:29.330, Speaker C: And in addition, like when you think about what actually causes a severe downturn in the market, it's really tough for the market to slow down without people losing their jobs, because as long as people have their jobs, they have a stream of cash flows. They can meet their mortgage payments, they can meet their credit card payments, they.
00:08:29.330 - 00:08:33.242, Speaker A: Can buy stuff at the mall. A lot of them will get a 401k contribution.
00:08:33.306 - 00:08:33.714, Speaker C: Correct?
00:08:33.802 - 00:08:34.498, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:34.674 - 00:08:51.258, Speaker C: And so when you start to see that slow down in the context of rates already being super restrictive, that can actually lead to a pretty big slowdown. And so folks started to price in more of a hard landing scenario, more of a recession probability.
00:08:51.394 - 00:08:54.580, Speaker A: And then the bojdeh hiked rates more than expected.
00:08:54.660 - 00:09:03.276, Speaker C: Also, there was chatter about going 25 basis points. Now, you've had a bit of a retracement in that move because one of the BOJ governors came out last night.
00:09:03.308 - 00:09:03.972, Speaker A: He said, don't worry.
00:09:04.036 - 00:09:11.692, Speaker C: And he's like, you know, we're obviously going to consider, like, basically financial conditions. Like, they're not going to hike rates when, like, the topics is down 10%.
00:09:11.796 - 00:09:16.372, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, they were on our Sunday night there. Monday morning they were limit down.
00:09:16.436 - 00:09:16.748, Speaker C: Limit down.
00:09:16.764 - 00:09:17.460, Speaker A: Circuit breakers.
00:09:17.540 - 00:09:17.940, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:09:18.020 - 00:09:27.540, Speaker A: Like, people remember during COVID the only time in our recent lifetimes that that's happened was like March 2020 during COVID where they literally halt the entire stock exchange.
00:09:28.200 - 00:09:32.912, Speaker C: And, you know, just to give you some context, like MUFG. Like Mitsubishi Financial.
00:09:32.976 - 00:09:34.032, Speaker A: Biggest bank in Japan. Right.
00:09:34.056 - 00:09:36.840, Speaker C: Biggest bank in Japan was down 20% Monday night.
00:09:36.920 - 00:09:37.208, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:37.264 - 00:09:42.384, Speaker C: If I told people in the US that JPMorgan Chase was down 20%, it.
00:09:42.392 - 00:09:44.620, Speaker A: Would be financial chaos in this country.
00:09:45.400 - 00:09:46.992, Speaker C: That's the polite way of putting it, yeah.
00:09:47.016 - 00:10:00.206, Speaker A: That's the largest bank in the world, right? JPM, I believe one of them by assets. But yeah, there's measures. Yeah, sure. But yes, this is a big deal in Japan. What, the fourth or fifth largest economy by GDP? Fourth, I think. I think third.
00:10:00.398 - 00:10:03.846, Speaker C: It depends on if you put block EU as one or not.
00:10:03.918 - 00:10:13.302, Speaker A: Somebody was asking me, they're like, oh, my God. Like something blah, blah, blah can happen in Japan of this much of a thing. I was like, well, to be clear, it's literally like the top economy in the world.
00:10:13.366 - 00:10:14.190, Speaker C: Yes, absolutely.
00:10:14.230 - 00:10:31.976, Speaker A: And it was also the only. Let me just step back, actually, I want to talk about the carry, because just to what I'm hearing from your explanation, borrow cost, the cost of capital in Japan was basically zero or very low. So it was a great thing to borrow. You had almost no interest payments to make so you could borrow.
00:10:32.048 - 00:10:38.640, Speaker C: And in addition, what was happening was you borrowed that thing, but it was also depreciating.
00:10:38.680 - 00:10:40.992, Speaker A: So it was weakening. Until recently, it was weakening.
00:10:41.056 - 00:10:41.280, Speaker C: Correct.
00:10:41.320 - 00:10:52.346, Speaker A: So your repayment was actually going down. You were paying almost nothing in principal, borrowing cost and the value, the total principle of your repayment was getting cheaper over time.
00:10:52.378 - 00:10:53.426, Speaker C: Depends if you.
00:10:53.618 - 00:10:54.810, Speaker A: What you were using it for.
00:10:54.890 - 00:10:56.274, Speaker C: But, yeah, but that was the whole idea.
00:10:56.282 - 00:11:03.754, Speaker A: So that media. So people were loading up though, going there for effectively liquidity. Cheap borrowing is similar to when we had basically zero rates.
00:11:03.802 - 00:11:04.426, Speaker C: Correct.
00:11:04.578 - 00:11:11.474, Speaker A: But in general, there's were even sub, like real unreal terms over the negative. Negative, yeah. So sometimes you're getting paid to borrow.
00:11:11.562 - 00:11:12.162, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:11:12.306 - 00:11:17.074, Speaker A: And then they're using that to buy other things like risk assets, like equities, us tech stocks. Right.
00:11:17.162 - 00:11:17.412, Speaker C: I.
00:11:17.466 - 00:11:32.256, Speaker A: And so to unwind this trade, you just like, you have to back out of all the things, you have to sell what you bought, use that to rebuy the yen that causes the equities to go down or the other assets. I mean, if you were bitcoin, then it would be bitcoin that goes down.
00:11:32.288 - 00:11:33.200, Speaker C: I don't know what he was doing.
00:11:33.280 - 00:11:39.160, Speaker A: Well, no, not really, because this is really what, what are we talking about? Large institutional traders, hedge funds, big, like.
00:11:39.200 - 00:11:43.184, Speaker C: Japanese pensions, like real money type of deep, big capital.
00:11:43.352 - 00:11:45.100, Speaker A: But that means even a specific.
00:11:46.120 - 00:11:46.568, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:11:46.624 - 00:11:48.488, Speaker A: Okay, so now that this has happened.
00:11:48.664 - 00:11:49.640, Speaker C: And it's just beginning.
00:11:49.680 - 00:11:52.168, Speaker A: Okay, so, yeah, what does that mean? I mean, basically, do we expect a.
00:11:52.184 - 00:11:54.400, Speaker C: Lot more, like, over time? Yes.
00:11:54.560 - 00:12:03.136, Speaker A: So is it merely a weakening bid that used to be here because of that carry trade, or is it like gonna be, is it sell pressure?
00:12:03.288 - 00:12:44.148, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think what you're gonna see is these real money types, like, they're not stupid, right? They're not gonna sell assets when they're puking at the dead lows. It's going to be a methodical unwind of some of those trades, and that'll slowly happen over time. You had the dramatic margin calls and big aggressive move, taking out all the speculators, blah, blah, blah, and now you'll just see a slow trickle of that stuff. But it really depends on one, how aggressive the BOJ is going to be. The data in Japan and stuff, if things start to cool.
00:12:44.204 - 00:12:53.960, Speaker A: Part of the reason for the hike here is that they are dealing with their own inflation, correct, just like us. They've got to do something to keep their inflation down for their population.
00:12:54.580 - 00:13:05.130, Speaker C: But they also have a big debt issue where if they hike rates too much, then the interest that they're paying, it all leads to bitcoin. But let's be honest.
00:13:05.670 - 00:13:18.390, Speaker A: I was gonna say, gosh, the tink, it's like a Rube Goldberg machine, you know? You know when you create like a machine with like pulleys and like in like, baskets and all that thing where it's like this overly engineered system.
00:13:18.510 - 00:13:18.918, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:13:18.974 - 00:13:26.630, Speaker A: It's just extremely complicated ball of wires where you're like, oh, crap, we got to do this thing to do that thing. But if we do that thing, then this other thing's gonna happen.
00:13:26.790 - 00:13:27.422, Speaker C: Yeah, you're right.
00:13:27.446 - 00:13:28.102, Speaker A: I mean, pretty rough.
00:13:28.126 - 00:14:11.576, Speaker C: It's like, you can't have, like, what the analogy is, but you can't have like a free floating currency and, like, centralized economy, you know, like, that's where the issue lies. And so if they did nothing, their currency would have, like, kept depreciating and they would have to, like, constantly intervene and the market would have bought it up. So then they are like, well, we have to like, re, like, back away from these stimulus measures and raise rates back to like real, like, real levels. And then, holy shit, what happens? You get a massive deleveraging event and your currency appreciates way too quickly. It leads to asset sell off. Because think about this. Japan's economy, they run a huge current account surplus.
00:14:11.576 - 00:14:41.080, Speaker C: All of their corporates earn money abroad. They sell cars in America. And Toyota technology. Yeah, Toyota takes those dollars, so they have their net long dollars. When dollar yen collapses and the yen starts appreciating, that's some mark to market loss for those guys holding the dollars. Yeah, there's a good reason why the topics is down and Nikkei is down, et cetera. And so it's all kind of intertwined in a way.
00:14:41.160 - 00:14:42.216, Speaker A: Pretty wild, too.
00:14:42.328 - 00:15:26.938, Speaker C: But realistically, what does it come down to and what are the lessons you can take away from this? The lessons are you've got a huge, complex financial market that's basically driven by central banks and the liquidity that they inject, the facilities they have. And it's a super controlled thing. And ultimately, there's just so many unintended consequences of some of the policies that we've just done. People like to think that it's proactive policy, but they're just reacting. It's like those machines with the groundhogs, they come up and the alligator head.
00:15:26.994 - 00:15:28.498, Speaker A: Or whatever, you hit one and the.
00:15:28.514 - 00:16:12.482, Speaker C: Other one comes up and you hit the other one, it's like, boom. And it's like, think about it now. In the US, it's like, okay, you start easing, you take rates to 3%, what happens? Some would argue that that means you're going to be back on the path of reinflation in short order because people then start being like, holy shit, I can actually afford a mortgage now. Maybe I'll start buying houses again. Maybe they'll unfreeze the housing market and asset prices might start going up again. It just leads to this endless loop of financialization that makes you be like, what is really the value of money? And what are these central bankers actually doing?
00:16:12.546 - 00:16:20.630, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're tinkering perpetually. And again, that's the system, like, forced to do that.
00:16:21.890 - 00:16:37.258, Speaker C: And so, like, that's why, like, the value proposition of bitcoin in these instances, like, gets highlighted at the same time, though. And what I would remind listeners is that, like, it is still a financial asset.
00:16:37.314 - 00:16:37.690, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:37.770 - 00:16:48.822, Speaker C: And when risk assets trade to one correlation, like, there's no risk asset that is safe. And I'll give you the example of gold. During 2008, it was still down.
00:16:48.926 - 00:16:52.102, Speaker A: I mean, gold was down. On Monday it was down two plus percent.
00:16:52.206 - 00:16:53.030, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:16:53.190 - 00:16:56.910, Speaker A: It was down. On Friday it wasn't down the 15 that bitcoin went down.
00:16:56.950 - 00:16:59.414, Speaker C: But you have geopolitical concerns because I.
00:16:59.422 - 00:17:08.360, Speaker A: Saw this Peter Schiff and others were dunking on bitcoin. Oh, so much for store value. In a risk off move, it went down.
00:17:08.740 - 00:17:10.172, Speaker C: But that's also what happens to gold.
00:17:10.236 - 00:17:35.220, Speaker A: And it's also separately, the bitcoin bet isn't that you can't engineer a global, decentralized store of value from zero to one. Like magic. Like, it's currently capitalizing. It wouldn't have growth potential if it had already become a stable store of value. Right. Like, part of the bitcoin bet today, if you invest in bitcoin, is a bet that it will become that in the future. It's obviously still in its infancy, in its early stages, so it didn't seem fair that dunking to me.
00:17:35.300 - 00:18:26.682, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm not going to entertain anything Peter Schiff says, but ultimately, I do think that you do want to be in hard assets like gold and stuff. And the US, Japan, everywhere has its own challenges. China is dealing with a massive slowdown right now. Their property market is under a ton of pressure and it's being masked and stuff. And that's the second or third largest economy, however you want to think about it. And then in certain places, they've tried all these efforts to get inflation to come down, but it's still going higher. And there's just so many different problems out there that to be honest, I hope that bitcoin is an answer for this stuff, but it's not the answer.
00:18:26.682 - 00:18:27.402, Speaker C: It's not the answer.
00:18:27.426 - 00:18:36.922, Speaker A: There's a lot of other factors here. Do you think the Fed markets are pricing in five cuts now by the end of 525 bps cuts by the end of the year? People are coming.
00:18:36.986 - 00:18:37.978, Speaker C: It's come down a little bit.
00:18:37.994 - 00:18:55.946, Speaker A: Okay. Well, there was some freak out in that market and it's closer to, but some people are calling Japan's more aggressive than expected hike a grave policy error. I've seen other people calling the Fed's lack of a easing cut last week a grave policy error.
00:18:56.018 - 00:18:56.738, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:18:56.914 - 00:19:07.046, Speaker A: What should the Fed do in your mind now? Should they definitely cut some amount in September? Some people were even talking earlier this week when there was panic a little bit in financial markets that there should be an emergency cut.
00:19:07.158 - 00:19:07.542, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:19:07.606 - 00:19:08.770, Speaker A: What's your view on that?
00:19:10.270 - 00:19:56.940, Speaker C: I think it's pretty clear from the data and what we're forecasting that rates are probably too restrictive already and that you should be closer to neutral. And neutral depends on what your idea is. But let's say that's 3%, three and a quarter somewhere around there. And so, you know, traditional monetary policy analysis would tell you that you should get to neutral as soon as possible. And so I would tend to agree with them that they probably should have started cutting in the July meeting. But it doesn't really align well with kind of how the Fed does things. Like Jackson Hole is typically when they announce like a big policy shift, it's also just the election makes things a little weird and stuff.
00:19:56.940 - 00:20:11.748, Speaker C: And so I do think that they should have been reducing, I'm not a fan of the emergency cuts because the economy is still fine, growth is still fine. The unemployment rate's only at 4.3%. And CE is like major us stock.
00:20:11.804 - 00:20:15.476, Speaker A: Indexes are still up like ten to 15% on the year. It's not like we're in a terrible.
00:20:15.548 - 00:20:16.876, Speaker C: No, we're not downturn or anything.
00:20:16.908 - 00:20:21.380, Speaker A: We're not in a, yeah, so it would signal weakness that isn't actually there to do an emergency.
00:20:21.500 - 00:20:35.604, Speaker C: And I prefer a Fed that isn't panicked when there isn't any reason to panic. But I do think that they should be cutting and I think they should, I believe just front load the cuts.
00:20:35.692 - 00:20:36.440, Speaker A: Take us.
00:20:38.180 - 00:20:40.492, Speaker C: And then you're at neutral and then you observe.
00:20:40.556 - 00:20:41.308, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah.
00:20:41.364 - 00:20:52.780, Speaker C: Right. Yeah. Like, it's a difficult kind of place. I don't want to be Jerome Powell. He has one of the hardest jobs on the planet.
00:20:52.820 - 00:20:54.140, Speaker A: He handles it with quite poise.
00:20:54.180 - 00:21:07.928, Speaker C: I guess he does. He does quite a lot of poise, but it's whatever you do. There's a consequence to it. And it's like if you ease too early, we just came from a period where inflation got 8%. Are you concerned about that?
00:21:07.984 - 00:21:08.336, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:21:08.368 - 00:21:14.904, Speaker C: If you don't ease, oh, the deficit, the national debt, and people are gonna start losing jobs like crazy.
00:21:14.952 - 00:21:30.702, Speaker A: And let's be real, the central bank, regardless of whether they are part of the us government or not, they're not. They are part of America. The national debt does matter to Jay Powell and the rest of the 20,000 Federal Reserve employees. So they can't hike forever. That's just a fact.
00:21:30.726 - 00:21:31.318, Speaker C: No, they can't.
00:21:31.374 - 00:21:33.118, Speaker A: That's a fact. Numbers don't, they don't add up.
00:21:33.134 - 00:21:51.542, Speaker C: But it's like ultimately, where are we headed? It's like MMT world. Huge debt to GDP, the Fed constantly buying the treasuries that treasury, the US treasury issues. And anytime shit goes crazy, everybody wants a bailout, everybody wants a stimulus.
00:21:51.566 - 00:21:54.766, Speaker A: Well, and they've conditioned the market for that, unfortunately.
00:21:54.878 - 00:21:58.570, Speaker C: Literally money. They just send people money.
00:21:58.730 - 00:21:59.042, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:21:59.066 - 00:21:59.554, Speaker C: You didn't even.
00:21:59.602 - 00:22:06.258, Speaker A: You, you couldn't even, like I was gonna say. Because if you. It's not like they mailed a check that you choose not to deposit. Just appeared.
00:22:06.354 - 00:22:06.882, Speaker C: Just appear.
00:22:06.946 - 00:22:09.570, Speaker A: Use your tax, your tax refund.
00:22:09.650 - 00:22:10.310, Speaker C: Correct.
00:22:11.170 - 00:22:15.458, Speaker A: Dollar bank account information to just literally airdrop it into your account.
00:22:15.594 - 00:22:28.768, Speaker C: Yeah. And then inflation isn't gonna come from that. Like, literally, here's free money hindsight. You're like, what? How on earth did you guys think. Not to mention that wasn't going to cause it. Look, it was one of the biggest policy blunders.
00:22:28.904 - 00:22:46.232, Speaker A: It really was. Think about like $800 or I think what most people got or something around. You got three of them. Okay, so like $2,000. Now that probably helped during those during. For about a month or two, but at the expense of effectively net 30% price inflation over three years. No one.
00:22:46.232 - 00:22:47.472, Speaker A: If they could.
00:22:47.496 - 00:22:50.720, Speaker C: But it wasn't even just that, though. You had the PPP loan.
00:22:50.760 - 00:22:51.488, Speaker A: No, no, for sure.
00:22:51.584 - 00:22:52.336, Speaker C: The student loan.
00:22:52.368 - 00:22:56.592, Speaker A: Forget. But I'm just saying like, it seems so nice. The stimmies seem nice.
00:22:56.696 - 00:22:57.120, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:22:57.200 - 00:23:01.920, Speaker A: But I would have absolutely given that money back to not pay, you know, $15 for a breakfast burrito.
00:23:02.080 - 00:23:02.768, Speaker C: I agree.
00:23:02.864 - 00:23:16.592, Speaker A: I mean, I think most people would now, but it's like. But it is kind of funny to make fun of the populace a little for demanding the bailout, demanding the stimmies, and then being like, why do we have inflation? It's like, well, it's like if we all agreed to not spend it.
00:23:16.616 - 00:23:18.570, Speaker C: Oh, it's the corporate. Their price gouge.
00:23:18.610 - 00:23:22.010, Speaker A: No, dude, we all went out and spent that money on, like, GameStop stock.
00:23:22.050 - 00:23:29.474, Speaker C: No, no, no. Let's just do universal basic income. Just spend people money and, like, fix problems. But, yeah.
00:23:29.562 - 00:23:54.280, Speaker A: Well, we will catch up with you again. There's more to come here. Obviously, bitcoin and crypto is repriced a bit lower. But, I mean, fifty six k and still, you know, if you told me we crashed to year ago, if you. If someone had busted in here while we were recording, we would have laughed at that. So I urge people to have some perspective. By the way, equity is also, like I said, I mean, if you're a passive equity investor, like most Americans are, 10% still doing fine.
00:23:54.280 - 00:24:02.556, Speaker A: But it did seem scary. It feels like that Monday of this week will be a pretty famous market day. People will remember that day.
00:24:02.668 - 00:24:14.856, Speaker C: They will. But it wasn't even that crazy. I mean, the japanese moves were crazy. Emergency cup pricing is crazy. But I don't know, I feel like just so desensitized because I work in crypto.
00:24:14.968 - 00:24:37.460, Speaker A: There was that thing where it was like, there's all these memes going around where it's like a little baby and he's crying and it says -5% and then it's like, minus. They're giving baby shots is what I saw. And a bunch of them are, you know, they get a shot and they cry. It's what a baby does. Usually when they get a shot, it's like stock investor -5% and then there's this one of a baby getting a shot, and he just doesn't do anything. Just looks at the doctor like this, and they're like, crypto, like -75% he's just, like, unfazed completely.
00:24:37.940 - 00:24:41.348, Speaker C: We don't have a central bank to bail us out. Well, every time it goes crazy.
00:24:41.444 - 00:24:44.604, Speaker A: No, we don't. Let's go back into crypto next week a bit more.
00:24:44.652 - 00:24:45.260, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:24:45.380 - 00:24:53.308, Speaker A: There have been some interesting things, bitcoin dominance, a bunch of interesting sort of things happening there. But we are overtime. So, Bimnet, my friend, thank you for coming on. Galaxy brains.
00:24:53.444 - 00:24:54.280, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:24:56.300 - 00:25:07.374, Speaker A: Welcome to our guest, Willem Schro, founder and CEO of Botanics Labs, which is building spider chain on bitcoin. It's a type of L2. Willem, welcome to Galaxy Brainstor.
00:25:07.452 - 00:25:08.510, Speaker B: Great to be here.
00:25:08.970 - 00:25:46.540, Speaker A: We talked at Pub Key, I guess, a couple of months ago on a panel about bitcoin, l two s and layered scaling technology for bitcoin. So I was really excited to have you on galaxy brains to dive into it. We're going to get into this, but primarily because a lot of the teams are building rollups, taking Ethereum technology, a lot of them ZK rollups, none of them have launched yet, and trying to roll them up to bitcoin. But botanics is taking a different approach to layered scaling or a different L2 approach, not a roll up. What is a spider chain and what is Botanix Labs? Willem?
00:25:46.880 - 00:26:16.230, Speaker B: Absolutely, yeah. Let me take a step back. Why we're building the spider chain as it is, and why we're not building a roll up. So around two years ago, I saw the power of the EVM, and I wanted to bring that to bitcoin. And actually, the most obvious thing, if you look at Ethereum is like, okay, let's build a roll up on bitcoin. It makes so much sense. So I dug deep into how we would build a roll up, what the different downsides of different roll ups and roll up technology are.
00:26:16.230 - 00:27:11.966, Speaker B: And I realized that I wanted to build a more decentralized L2. And so I started designing a L2 that's capable to be decentralized, fully EVM equivalent, and capable to be fully run on bitcoin. And out of that design exercise came what's called the spider chain. So the spider chain is a decentralized L2 where anyone will be able to participate, where anyone will be able to run a full node. That has some downsides and it has some upsides, but in essence, how it works creates this decentralized network of multisigs. In essence, one of the realizations that I had is everything is a multisig in the space. And so when you accept that reality, you can actually make the best network of decentralized multisigs, actually.
00:27:11.966 - 00:27:18.894, Speaker B: And that's what we aim to do with the spider chain. And happy to go a little bit deeper into how it actually works.
00:27:18.982 - 00:27:51.970, Speaker A: So it's not. So when you say decentralized, what I'm hearing too is maybe, I don't know if it's criticism, but a differentiation from rollups, which are today, I think on Ethereum, there is no decentralized sequencer that I'm aware of on any rollup. The arbitrum sequencer effectively controls the entirety of the arbitrum rollup. If they censor you or steal from you, there's some remediation with, you can submit a fraud proof. And there's some ways that make it safe in that sense of. Right. They're not currently decentralized in that way.
00:27:52.090 - 00:28:14.306, Speaker B: Correct. And I also don't think they should be decentralized, actually. I think rollups go for extremely fast, extremely fast blocks like you can go think arbitrum is at 0.25 seconds. Now, we all know from the blockchain trilemma, if you go super fast, you cannot be decentralized. However, you can be trustless. And so the roll ups go for more.
00:28:14.306 - 00:28:34.650, Speaker B: A trustless fashion, either optimistic by providing a capability to provide a fraud proof or with CK proofs. Now that centralized aspect has some downsides. Like you can get censored, like it's going to be a central server running somewhere in the world.
00:28:34.730 - 00:28:36.434, Speaker A: It's somebody's computer basically, right?
00:28:36.482 - 00:29:09.226, Speaker B: It's a database that's running and generating some proofs. In essence, that's it. And you can make it trustless. So very good solutions in the design space, but gums with downsides of censorship. For example, if that central party doesn't want to include your transactions, then you're kind of censored from the whole virtual machine or the whole experience. Now you can have this type of solutions where you can do a base layer transaction to force a transaction on the second layer, but you're still censored of using the.
00:29:09.298 - 00:29:13.554, Speaker A: You probably would ultimately have to leave the roll up ultimately. Right. You wouldn't be able to.
00:29:13.562 - 00:29:13.914, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:29:13.962 - 00:29:14.404, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:14.522 - 00:29:51.720, Speaker B: If you have to do every transaction on the base layer, then basically you're still censored. So that's one of the downsides. Second downside is liveness. If that central server would go down, what then? And a third, maybe more longer term question is like upgradability. Who actually can upgrade the code? That is always the question you have to ask yourself. Now there's some really good smart people working on it, but that's in essence what roll ups are going for, right? Centralized, trustless solutions. And I felt bitcoin needed more a decentralized layer, two as a first step.
00:29:51.720 - 00:30:09.184, Speaker B: And so we want to be more like an ethereum. We're never going to be as decentralized as bitcoin, but we can be as decentralized as ethereum. And I think that's very much needed if you want to build a financial system on bitcoin. And that was the original goal.
00:30:09.332 - 00:30:15.888, Speaker A: So we now we have a series of overlapping multi sigs, which is the spider chain, is that right?
00:30:16.024 - 00:30:19.656, Speaker B: Yeah. Let me maybe step back. What is a spider chain?
00:30:19.688 - 00:30:32.992, Speaker A: Yeah, give us a little more of the topography, what this network actually looks like as a network, whereas a roll up is sort of a centralized single state updated by a sequencer. What is the spider chain in comparison to that?
00:30:33.176 - 00:31:09.338, Speaker B: Okay. For the people familiar with the Lightning network, when you look from a high level, the Lightning network is a whole decentralized network of two out of two multi seq. If you and I open a channel, that's a two out of two multisig, and now park that idea. But it's very similar. So what you will do is you will create a series of multisigs. So, for example, if you would have 10,000 participants all running a full node, what you will do is you will randomly choose 100 participants out of the 10,000, and you will create one single multisig. And then you do that again, you create a second multisig.
00:31:09.338 - 00:31:38.324, Speaker B: Again, you randomly choose 100 participants out of the 10,000 and create a second multisig. And then a third and a fourth and a fifth and a 6th. And after a while, you have this decentralized network of multisigs where anyone can permissionly participate. And then all those full nodes, those 10,000 or 100,000 full nodes come together in a proof of stake consensus, and that secures the evm. And that whole thing runs on bitcoin. So that's a little bit how it works.
00:31:38.372 - 00:32:01.132, Speaker A: Yeah, that's helpful. So then the nodes themselves, are they all executing every transaction inside this evm? Each time a transaction occurs in, does it form? Sort of. Let me ask a different way. We have the overlap. We say, okay, the same. Let's say it's 100 nodes total, and so they're all in all the multi sigs, or let's say it's the thousand, but there's these overlappings of 100. Obviously, there ends up being like some.
00:32:01.132 - 00:32:25.500, Speaker A: I don't want to say central points, because I don't mean like central points of failure, but enough overlap that you end up with a core of nodes that are forming this heart of the spider chain. Where does the state actually exist? Is every node, are there actually just multiple states? Each multisig is its own evM. Or how does this come to form a network?
00:32:26.080 - 00:32:44.712, Speaker B: There's one single evm that runs on top of it, and everybody runs an eVM. So, very similar to, like, ethereum. Actually, the best comparison of what we're doing is trying to build ethereum, but then, literally on bitcoin has a second layer, and so everyone will run that same state machine and virtual machine.
00:32:44.736 - 00:32:45.420, Speaker A: Got it.
00:32:46.200 - 00:33:17.274, Speaker B: Difference with Ethereum, of course, is we will use bitcoin as the gas fees, and you will stake bitcoin yeah. So that's a little bit interesting, actually. It might be interesting for the audience to remember how the spatter chain works is maybe where the name comes from. So when you think about this series of multisigs, I actually drew it on a whiteboard. And so if you draw a multisick, a circle with like. Yeah, eight participants, and then another circle with eight participants and another circle with eight participants. And that kind of looks like a multiq, kind of looks like a spider.
00:33:17.274 - 00:33:20.258, Speaker B: And so a series of multi six became like the.
00:33:20.394 - 00:33:24.500, Speaker A: And they overlap ultimately, and form this web, basically, right?
00:33:24.540 - 00:33:32.564, Speaker B: Yes, because some of the participants will participate in some of the multisix and others in others. And so you create this whole network after a while.
00:33:32.612 - 00:33:57.956, Speaker A: That's kind of. You had set this up before, but sort of as a comparison to the lightning network. Just like, you and I may have a channel, and then you and phineas may have a channel. I don't have one with phineas, but the overlapping of your channels and my channels ultimately forms this sort of decentralized network. There is no common state on the lightning network, but that series of overlapping relationships does form like a distributed network.
00:33:58.108 - 00:33:58.436, Speaker B: Correct.
00:33:58.468 - 00:34:12.676, Speaker A: And that's how the spider chain kind of feels, too, topographically speaking. Yes, very interesting. So what. Okay, so let's go forward now. So we have an EVM equivalent network. I'm gonna say. I was gonna say blockchain, but that doesn't sound.
00:34:12.676 - 00:34:35.194, Speaker A: That's not exactly right. Does then the spider chain post data to bitcoin. We just published this report about data availability for rollups on bitcoin. Is there some checkpointing into the bitcoin blockchain? Is there some way to. What's the relationship between that state in the spider chain and the bitcoin layer? One state.
00:34:35.362 - 00:35:42.518, Speaker B: Very good question. And that's where you have to park the idea of L2 as roll ups again. So with rollups, because you are centralized, that basically comes with a few downsides. Like, how do you get that consensus from the base layer? How do you actually know on the base layer what's happening? How do you do unilateral exit? How do you force transactions on the second layer? You can only do that if you have the data on the base layer or at some location that you know that the centralized party doesn't withhold the data, for example, or at some point changes the data. What if that centralized party says, oh, let's change the database in the backend without anyone knowing? They could do that, but not if you post the data back to the base layer. That's why you need to do that. Now, if you think about bitcoin, for example, why doesn't bitcoin have to post data somewhere? It's because all the data sits in this decentralized network.
00:35:42.518 - 00:36:04.866, Speaker B: And so when you have a decentralized network, all the data can just sit on the second layer. So the issues that you have with roll ups, like in terms of unilateral exit, in terms of forcing transactions on the base layer, in terms of data availability, posting on the base layer, all come from the fact that they are very centralized. Once you have a decentralized layer too, you don't have to do that.
00:36:04.938 - 00:36:39.062, Speaker A: It's almost like blockchain is all the way down, right? I mean, yes, it's sort of like, I mean, Ethereum doesn't post its data somewhere because it is the data availability, at least for itself, for its layer one transactions. Okay, so then the question then of like what has higher state data availability fidelity is a question of the proof of stake. Spider chain networks quality of immutability and replication and liveness, not one of how it connects, but because rollups don't actually have a decentralized network. Right. They have to post somewhere. I see. So it is different in that sense.
00:36:39.062 - 00:36:44.438, Speaker A: So you're not subject to the same network wide, for example, data posting costs.
00:36:44.454 - 00:37:16.770, Speaker B: That a roll up might be exactly like. We can keep the transactions extremely cheap on the second layer because we don't have the base layer cost for that data availability. It's actually very interesting. Once you go for the decentralized L2 design, you don't have the issues that you have from the roll ups. Now that of course comes at a cost. If you want to be decentralized, then basically you need to gossip all the information between your network and between your peers. And it comes at a throughput cost like bitcoin runs on ten minutes, not on 0.1
00:37:16.770 - 00:37:28.738, Speaker B: second. Roll ups can be extremely fast. The spider chain cannot go there because you will have to gossip around the whole network. That's the cost of it.
00:37:28.914 - 00:38:19.536, Speaker A: Then let's talk about some of the other aspects. One, we talked about the trustless exit of the roll up, which is, I think you may explain it really well. We're not optimizing for decentralization with the rollup, we're optimizing with a roll up for being able to unilaterally exit if they do mess with you or in general, and then getting transaction throughput and functionality, but at the expense of decentralization. One of the big questions with bitcoin roll ups in particular, with all layered networks and everything is bridging right. And with bitcoin in particular, because bitcoin's script is limited and also hard. We were talking before this, there's only perhaps a couple hundred really talented bitcoin developers in the world. We don't really have a bridge yet for a roll up on bitcoin.
00:38:19.536 - 00:38:37.768, Speaker A: I know there's people working on variations with BitVM. There's the tapper wizards folks are working on cat VMD, which is about Opcat. I don't think it's about a kitty cat. But how do you envision or how will the spider chain users move bitcoin between the l one and the spider chain?
00:38:37.944 - 00:38:59.766, Speaker B: Good question. So when you want to move from the base layer to the second layer, you will go to one of these full nodes and say, like, look, I want to send bitcoin. Give me a deposit address. So you generate deposit address that's part of these decentralized network of multisigs.
00:38:59.798 - 00:39:12.670, Speaker A: I see. Wait, so just before you even go forward then, so that multisig, then it's, they have an Xpub, basically they can just generate deposits that the multisig controls. Basically at any time, no addresses, just like any multisig.
00:39:12.750 - 00:39:17.610, Speaker B: The cool thing is we tweak that by using your own EVM address.
00:39:18.470 - 00:39:27.366, Speaker A: Interesting. So you have, so the deposit address on bitcoin on the l one would then be my address on the l two.
00:39:27.518 - 00:39:28.150, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:39:28.230 - 00:39:28.806, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:39:28.878 - 00:39:33.694, Speaker B: Yeah. So your deposit address is uniquely linked to your EVM address.
00:39:33.822 - 00:39:55.834, Speaker A: This is very interesting. Partly one of the things I was thinking about with the roll ups. And actually that is probably, I would argue the single best UX feature of the Ethereum rollup world is that you can just use the same address everywhere because they all use the EVM. They're all just EVM addresses, which is very convenient. Right. You can say, oops, crap, I accidentally sent that to you on arbitrum. No worries though.
00:39:55.834 - 00:40:13.770, Speaker A: You have the keys in your ethereum ad wallet. So just like go on arbitrum and collect it. Okay, sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt though. So you give us a deposit address. A node would, so how would I literally go to this node? I mean, I'm going to go to a website like spiderchainnode.com and somebody's going to be like, sure, send it here.
00:40:13.890 - 00:40:39.490, Speaker B: Yeah. So basically you can test it out actually on our testnet. So you go there, you connect your metamask or any EVM wallet and a deposit address is generated. The cool thing then is you can send bitcoin, of course, from anywhere. You can withdraw from coinbase to that address. So from Coinbase, you withdraw to that deposit address and you'll have the bitcoin on the second layer in your EVM wallet. You never even see the base layer.
00:40:39.490 - 00:40:43.812, Speaker B: Or you can send from a ledger or any of any other wallet, basically.
00:40:43.876 - 00:40:54.412, Speaker A: So then the actual main net l one bitcoin is now held by the whichever of the 100 quorum multisigs I've sent it to.
00:40:54.516 - 00:40:54.828, Speaker B: Correct.
00:40:54.884 - 00:41:04.332, Speaker A: Okay, and then do they release on the spider chain? I don't know, like SBTC or spider chain BTC? Basically it's like a, right, so you.
00:41:04.356 - 00:41:10.972, Speaker B: Get the native currency of the EVM is bitcoin. So you get that bitcoin in your metamask.
00:41:10.996 - 00:41:19.868, Speaker A: So every piece of bitcoin on the spider chain is like effectively a replica of locked, multisig, actual bitcoin.
00:41:19.964 - 00:41:20.308, Speaker B: Correct.
00:41:20.364 - 00:41:31.700, Speaker A: So if I want to. So the supply, quote unquote, of bitcoin on the spider chain, the total supply is whatever the total locked bitcoin held by the spider chain multisigs on L1 is.
00:41:31.740 - 00:41:32.060, Speaker B: Correct.
00:41:32.140 - 00:41:32.500, Speaker C: Got it.
00:41:32.540 - 00:41:33.084, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:41:33.172 - 00:42:10.558, Speaker A: So you have to, like when you, when you eventually. So you're in testnet right now, right? So when you launch on Mainnet, whenever that is, which I may ask you about in a few minutes, but does that make it hard to bootstrap this network? Do you have to put some bitcoin in there just to get the machine operating? Right, I mean, because a lot of these other networks, of course, use their own altcoin as the base token. So it's pretty easy. They just print it out of thin air and bam, they've got some tokens that their users can use to interact with the chain of. Is it like, I haven't really thought about this before, but it's begging the question to me, like, is it harder to start one of these just from zero to one because of that?
00:42:10.734 - 00:42:45.902, Speaker B: No, it's fairly easy, I think. So we will start with 15 different full nodes. Like in your roll up terms, you could call it like we'll start with 15 different decentralized sequencers. On day one, they'll be globally distributed and it's actually going to be mostly the big ethereum node operators. So they also see the light and see like, wait, I can run a full node on the spider chain and get a share of the bitcoin gas fees. And so they suddenly see that. And so we're choosing these 15 parties.
00:42:45.902 - 00:43:27.964, Speaker B: We will run one node as botanics ourselves, and then all the 14 will be big company entities spread around the world, all using different infrastructure. And so we will be quite trustless from day one. We won't be able to upgrade if the rest doesn't want to upgrade anymore. So in essence, quite an interesting case from the beginning. And then we hope to grow from eventually from 15 to 100, from 100 to 1000, and basically go from there. But in terms of bootstrapping from block zero, you can basically send bitcoin there, have the bitcoin on your metamask and do whatever you want with it.
00:43:28.012 - 00:44:13.420, Speaker A: I guess it is. I really am not sure if I've actually. I think I know that I haven't myself spent time looking at a bitcoin native gas fee network launch from scratch that I'm aware of. I'm sure maybe there is, there are some, but I'm not aware of one. So I'm excited to see this, how that goes. So how do I, what prevents, maybe what prevents the node that I sent to my deposit address of my on chain bitcoin from say, absconding with my bitcoin, or let's say, or set another way, how do I exit from the spider chain if I want bitcoin back, whether it's what I originally deposited or whatever I have in my EVM address on the spider chain, how do I bail out of there if I need to or I want to without?
00:44:14.000 - 00:44:55.734, Speaker B: Yeah, it's fairly easy as well. So you send bitcoin on the EVM. So from any wallethood you send that to a burning address. Once that transaction is confirmed on the second layer, what will happen is basically all the different nodes that run the full EVM see that burning transaction, and that puts in a process where bitcoin from the last multisigs or the last Utxos starts signing and basically withdraw that, or sign the Utxo and send it to the wallet provider by the user. So basically in your burning transaction you will submit as text your bitcoin address.
00:44:55.782 - 00:45:13.382, Speaker A: Yeah. So then, because there's like, again, if it were one node, they could just decline to give you to send that, but because it's many, is that the idea that is there a penalty for a node that decides not to enact that transaction or. Correct.
00:45:13.526 - 00:45:44.216, Speaker B: So we run a proof of stake. Actually this is a whole different topic, but I used to be a big proof of work maximalist, until I realized that a proof of stake on top of a proof of work is completely different than a proof of stake on the base layer, from a technology perspective and from a trust perspective and a tech surface perspective, but yes, exactly. So basically, if someone signs the wrong transaction or doesn't do an action, or suddenly isn't live anymore, or changes the.
00:45:44.248 - 00:45:46.256, Speaker A: Deposit address to their own address.
00:45:46.328 - 00:46:09.980, Speaker B: Right, exactly. You basically get slashed, and that's where you get that consensus coming into play. And so the only thing you need to do as a user is see that the network is sufficiently decentralized, very similar to like a bitcoin. All the trust comes that not a single party has more than 51% of the hashrate. And so you trust that decentralization aspect.
00:46:10.060 - 00:46:18.144, Speaker A: Interesting. Yeah. So it's a proof of stake consensus network that has whatever trade offs and benefits that that would normally have. Basically.
00:46:18.232 - 00:46:18.824, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:46:18.952 - 00:46:40.990, Speaker A: And then they're all running that software that tells the node how to sign the withdrawal transaction and what to do the process. And if a node alters that software, it will fall out of consensus anyway. Is that the idea? So correct. And like, if like, you know, two nodes try to steal my money, but the other 13 are like, no, this is the correct one. Like the network will do that one instead. Basically.
00:46:41.120 - 00:46:41.554, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:46:41.602 - 00:46:45.778, Speaker A: Yeah. Just the transaction goes with consensus of the nodes, I guess.
00:46:45.794 - 00:46:46.594, Speaker B: It's interesting.
00:46:46.762 - 00:47:07.490, Speaker A: All right, let's step back a little bit. I have a lot more to learn about Spider chains. I think they're very interesting. I love, even more than passing judgment on the technology decisions that you guys make. I just love that there's a different, it's not yet another roll up. I love roll ups. I think they make palatable trade offs depending on what you want them for.
00:47:07.490 - 00:47:28.342, Speaker A: But very, very interesting. I encourage our audience to learn more about how it works, higher level, what types of applications and uses and features and capabilities are we going to get on the spider chain, bitcoin users or these users? And why is that interesting? Why do we need the spider chain?
00:47:28.486 - 00:48:16.288, Speaker B: Yeah, good question. I'm going to go extremely high level here. I put together this theory two years ago, and I want to see a whole world running on bitcoin as the money. That's where I would like the world to go to. And so if you think about every transaction in the world, if you buy a house, if you take a loan, if you buy stocks, I want you to use bitcoin for every transaction in the world, either from b, two b transactions, b, two c transactions, just customer to customer sending money. And so what you need for them. And actually, very interestingly, on Ethereum, what you already have seen over the last four years with Defi and a lot of the inventions, is that we've been speedrunning the traditional financial system.
00:48:16.288 - 00:48:57.434, Speaker B: But then in a ten X better version, and let me clarify with specifics on that. For example, what you see with tokens, I think they're a better version of securities. They're global, they're permissionless, open twenty four seven and ruled by code. Compare that to your today's stock exchanges. I mean, there's so many downsides, and it's not open global permissionless. Why doesn't someone in, for example, Egypt can buy all the stocks on the Nasdaq, for example? It doesn't make any sense. And you go back to this logic of Balaji's network states, and that open global network will eventually always win out.
00:48:57.434 - 00:49:47.500, Speaker B: And so I can see tokens, a better version than your current today stocks and securities. I can see decentralized exchanges are a better version of the stock exchanges or ten x better version. I can see the market makers that you see today are the hedge funds that we have in a traditional finance system. All these principles of our old traditional finance system is now being replicated in a ten x better version on Ethereum in these smart contracts. If you believe that that's a world that's better and you want bitcoin to be used for that, you go back and it's like, what type of L2 do you actually need for that bitcoin on a base layer, absolutely. Best money ever made. But what if you want to have that financial system? That's where I put the thesis.
00:49:47.500 - 00:50:27.036, Speaker B: If you have a roll up, having a financial system on that doesn't make that much sense, because then you give one single country in the world suddenly a huge amount of power over your global permissionless stock exchanges, which you want to be global permissionless, you want to have that second layer where you build that financial system to actually be decentralized. Otherwise, you lose the big benefits of having that better financial system. That's where I put together the theory, okay, I want that better financial system than what we have today. I want that to run on bitcoin and makes the most sense that your L2 needs to be decentralized for that.
00:50:27.188 - 00:50:37.708, Speaker A: Very interesting. So then, is it fair to say we can expect Dexs loan facilities tokenization platforms to emerge on the spider chain?
00:50:37.844 - 00:51:11.862, Speaker B: 100%. And I hope that actually happens. So one of the most obvious use cases today is like, okay, I want to buy a house, but I don't want to sell my bitcoin for it. Now you have something called aave on ethereum where you can actually, I mean, you have to use red bitcoin for it with all its trust assumptions. But you can borrow stable coins against your red bitcoin. And you see stable coins, you go to traditional fiat system and buy a house with that. That's a perfect mortgage and loan system and borrowing system.
00:51:11.862 - 00:51:20.686, Speaker B: And so it makes the most sense that you can actually do that natively on a L2 on bitcoin, using actual bitcoin instead of wrapped bitcoin.
00:51:20.878 - 00:51:29.490, Speaker A: Do you think there's demand from the current bitcoin user base to do these types of financial activities, quote unquote on bitcoin 100%.
00:51:29.870 - 00:52:07.410, Speaker B: I actually think it's bigger than a lot of people estimate. I never believe in something like the bitcoin user base as a single singular system that has a singular thought. That's just not reality. I actually think there's a lot of people that are active, for example in Solana or like Ethereum, that actually still own bitcoin. And totally, if you would ask them like, what is the best money? They would say bitcoin, but they cannot do anything today with it because there's no infrastructure to do it. I mean, you can buy ordinals and wounds and BRC twenties, and that's the limit. And so that's where the power of a virtual machine or like an EVM comes into play.
00:52:07.990 - 00:53:07.260, Speaker A: I think it's really interesting. That's one of the core questions other than the technology that I wonder about is you have so much of the bitcoin. Again, I totally agree, it's not a monolith at all. But if we think about sort of like mainstream bitcoin culture over the last few years, I think it's certainly less in the most recent years, but certainly the 18 to 20, I mean, 2018 to 2022 23, class of bitcoiners is almost uniformly focused on hodling on bitcoin as a store of value. And it is, by the way, and you can still use a store of value, to your point about taking a bitcoin backed dollar denominated loan, that is using bitcoin as a store of value and drawing from it. But yes, that's what I wonder about is a the absolute level of demand for more expressive capabilities that are on bitcoin, no matter which medium or l two they're using. But also, then from where does that demand come if we say, okay, I look forward a year and we say there is a lot of demand.
00:53:07.260 - 00:53:38.120, Speaker A: Well, was that mostly from the bitcoin on chain user base? Or was that, say, bringing people back from Solana or Ethereum? Who, but for bitcoins inability to provide those services, they would have been there already, do you think? Again, it's probably both. Some version of both. But to what extent do you think. Rephrase it a little bit. To what extent do you think spider chains or roll ups on bitcoin will suck users and capital away from Ethereum and its world?
00:53:38.580 - 00:54:28.048, Speaker B: Yeah. Overall, from a higher level, you just have this parallel that everything aggregates to the biggest liquidity. One of the reasons the US is so powerful is because of the us dollar reserve currency. Why the New York Stock Exchange is the biggest stock exchange, and everything draws that towards that liquidity. And so bitcoin is a black hole that would draw everyone back in, both from the fiat system and the rest of crypto. Now that said, I think in terms of the user base, it depends on how you define a bitcoiner is someone who is a founder of an Ethereum Dapp, that is a massive, that loves bitcoin and would want to build it on bitcoin, but ended up building on Ethereum. Do you call that a bitcoiner or not? I would consider that's actually a bitcoiner, but those people will 100% come back.
00:54:28.104 - 00:54:28.592, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:54:28.656 - 00:54:37.736, Speaker B: And so if I would want to split it, I would say like 20% of the people are going to be the people who are only active on bitcoin today.
00:54:37.808 - 00:54:45.592, Speaker A: I see. So you activate existing bitcoiners who don't do any of this type of activity. I think 20% of the spider chain users might be those people.
00:54:45.696 - 00:54:52.304, Speaker B: Exactly. And I think the rest of the 80% are people who are active everywhere outside of bitcoin in crypto.
00:54:52.352 - 00:54:54.120, Speaker A: But they may own bitcoin. They like bitcoin.
00:54:54.160 - 00:55:17.448, Speaker B: Bitcoin, they like bitcoin. They have bitcoin in their cold wallet and they don't do anything with it. And then with all the rest of their crypto holding the leverage on perp dexes, they take loans, they do airdrop farming, they do a bunch of different activities, but they still have the bitcoin in their gold wallet. Everybody considers it the best money. That's a funny thing that bitcoiners often forget. Everybody in crypto considers bitcoin the best money.
00:55:17.544 - 00:56:06.330, Speaker A: Yeah. There is a class of Ethereum maxis who think that sound money means simply deflationary money. But of course there's one in particular who I won't name because it's not like, screw him, or anything, but they always post that picture from ultrasound money or one of these websites where it's like, oh, bitcoin, straight line inflation going up, and look at eth, it was deflationary the last day. And we're like, I don't think you guys understand that it's the unchanging nature of the line that makes it sound money, not on whichever day the actual absolute level of inflation actually is. I think you're right, though. I think there are a lot of people who use other networks, may not even talk about bitcoin, but still use bitcoin. I do think there's a really interesting world we're headed to.
00:56:06.330 - 00:56:32.160, Speaker A: It sounds like, whether it's spider chains, whether it's rollups, are you pretty confident, how confident are you that we're going to find ourselves if we do this interview again in three or four years? Doing stuff on bitcoin going to mean something vastly more than it does today? Are people going to be doing a ton on these things, you think? How integral to the ecosystem will they become?
00:56:32.900 - 00:57:14.064, Speaker B: I think so. Today you have, I don't know, ten to $20 billion of red bitcoin on Ethereum. And that's where you'd have to take the risk of a centralized company headquartered in the US. And so the rest of the world is super scared of red bitcoin. Actually, that's what a lot of people forget is like, what if the us government seizes all the red bitcoin? Then it's game over for all those governments around the world, or like people or like institutions. And so if you do it on bitcoin, that is way more, way more trustless. And so if $20 billion of red bitcoin is the market on Ethereum, the market on bitcoin itself will just be way bigger.
00:57:14.064 - 00:58:19.284, Speaker B: And so I think it will take a few years, and that's just technology risk. Nobody trusts a new, fancy new technology on day one, right? But if this exists in four years, is stable, is secure, then I think in four years, this can be really, really big. Just like I said, all the liquidity will pour back to bitcoin. And from a perspective, from an application, like, let's say if I'm a founder of an Ethereum application or an EVM application today, do I deploy on Ethereum with exactly the same smart contract core I, or do I deploy on a bitcoin layer, too, where today there's zero market and there's a trillion dollar waiting for you to grasp and the effort, or, like, the lift on the codewise is exactly the same. And so Ethereum, very crowded market, smaller market or bitcoin, green field greenfield. And so it makes the most sense that we'll all move over, but there's still a lot of technology risks involved.
00:58:19.372 - 00:58:28.932, Speaker A: Okay, you said spider chain, you have a live test net. People can test. What's the timeline on launch in your mind at this point?
00:58:29.036 - 00:58:56.362, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a very good question. I think we've been very close to code complete for last like two, three months. I think we underestimated how difficult distributed peer to peer networks are. Our first version of the test was actually a single node, like a database, like a roll ups, that's actually super easy to run. Like you don't have the gossiping, you don't have the networking. And so we've over last month we've been facing a lot of networking issues.
00:58:56.426 - 00:58:57.954, Speaker A: Fault tolerance and all that.
00:58:58.002 - 00:59:22.926, Speaker B: Exactly, exactly. And getting that consensus into place and there's a lot of edge cases there. And so that was tougher than we imagined. So that's also, I think, the power of those distributed networks. That's where I think lies like the, the real big technology benefit. But yeah, I think another month or two of like internal testing, debugging, auditing, and then we'll bring that to Mainnet.
00:59:22.998 - 00:59:23.422, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
00:59:23.486 - 00:59:25.462, Speaker B: I want to launch an absolutely stable.
00:59:25.526 - 00:59:30.998, Speaker A: Secure product that makes a lot of. Yeah, for sure. But you think by the end of this year there'll be a mainnet launch, is that.
00:59:31.094 - 00:59:31.678, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:59:31.734 - 00:59:57.826, Speaker A: Oh, wow. So we're really entering this bitcoin season two, it sounds like that's going to be, and again, I don't know all these teams at all, but that sounds like the spider chains will probably hit main net before the roll ups do, which I know because this is the other thing. One maybe last technical question here. They're all struggling with the bridge. That's, I think, the core question. Right. Because they have only effectively one node, because they have a centralized sequencer.
00:59:57.826 - 01:00:14.774, Speaker A: A multisig is just like however good they decide to make it. No shade on polygon. But they used to get a lot of crap for this because it was like a five of seven multisig that was just like whoever the polygon association or whatever it was. Sure. They were like, we have people in different jurisdictions, but it was arbitrary.
01:00:14.942 - 01:00:16.286, Speaker B: But it was a three out of five.
01:00:16.358 - 01:00:20.638, Speaker A: Yeah. Maybe now a roll up could launch right now with a bridge like that.
01:00:20.694 - 01:00:21.390, Speaker B: Single multi sig.
01:00:21.430 - 01:00:44.240, Speaker A: Totally doable. Right. But then you're placing a lot of trust in that. And so they're all looking for ways to achieve a similar, even if it is literally a multisig. They want that unilateral exit capability that Ethereum roll ups have difficult. And that's where people are working with BitVM and all these things, really. There's a lot of experimentation happening there, but I haven't seen somebody even claim that they've solved it yet.
01:00:44.240 - 01:00:56.932, Speaker A: But yours doesn't need that because spider chains use it is a multisig. But the security of the multisig is secured by the decentralized proof of stake network itself, right?
01:00:57.076 - 01:00:57.500, Speaker B: Correct.
01:00:57.580 - 01:01:06.106, Speaker A: So that when you talk about working on distributed networking, you guys are the building a blockchain, basically. That's the hard part.
01:01:06.178 - 01:01:08.458, Speaker B: We're building a distributed network.
01:01:08.514 - 01:01:22.354, Speaker A: You have to build that distributed network over here and put all the effort into that. Whereas they don't need the distributed network on the roll up because it is just one computer, effectively, but they got to build the unilateral exit. Otherwise it's just like it's actually a centralized exchange if they don't.
01:01:22.442 - 01:01:23.698, Speaker B: Right, yeah, exactly.
01:01:23.754 - 01:01:30.954, Speaker A: So, wow, I think this is really interesting. I think bitcoiners are about to get a really interesting variety of ways to do more with their bitcoin.
01:01:31.042 - 01:02:05.330, Speaker B: Yeah, and you need all of those. Like, if you actually want a whole world to run on bitcoin, you absolutely need that when we need to, as bitcoiners who just want to have a store of value. I think that's really dangerous. Like, I'm mostly afraid if all the bitcoin ends up with ETF's, ends up with central banks and to back their fiat dollars, I mean, that's when we have lost. And so ideally, I want the whole world to use bitcoin as the money in every transaction in the world. And you need a lot of scalability for that. And we're not there yet, so I think rollups fit in that place.
01:02:05.330 - 01:02:18.994, Speaker B: I think spider chains, BitVM, you have the lightning network for fast free payments, and so you have. Yeah, it's awesome. I think we're finally moving on from that store of value in the initial phases of like, medium of exchange.
