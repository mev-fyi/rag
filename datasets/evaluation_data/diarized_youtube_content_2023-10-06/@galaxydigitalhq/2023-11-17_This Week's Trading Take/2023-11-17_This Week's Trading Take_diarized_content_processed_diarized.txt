00:00:00.280 - 00:00:04.622, Speaker B: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, BIMnet, thanks for joining galaxy brains.
00:00:04.718 - 00:00:05.654, Speaker A: Thanks for having me.
00:00:05.734 - 00:00:10.318, Speaker B: Soft CPI came in soft. Things are changing out here.
00:00:10.366 - 00:00:14.102, Speaker A: They are. We talked about a little paradigm shift happening in the day last week.
00:00:14.118 - 00:00:15.214, Speaker B: We talked about it, yeah.
00:00:15.374 - 00:00:46.666, Speaker A: And so what we saw from the CPI report was a decline in prices in a broad based way. I mean, the headline number came in flat, the core CPI number came in at 0.2. These are all indicative of what we like to call a soft landing. Some of the components in particular that drove some of the weakness or the softening was you had owners equivalent rent declined to like 0.4 month on month versus like 0.6. The services started to cool down a little bit. Airline fares came off.
00:00:46.666 - 00:00:54.754, Speaker A: Energy prices have been cooling, not in the CPI, but like, if you just look at gas prices over the past nine weeks, they're literally down nine weeks in a row.
