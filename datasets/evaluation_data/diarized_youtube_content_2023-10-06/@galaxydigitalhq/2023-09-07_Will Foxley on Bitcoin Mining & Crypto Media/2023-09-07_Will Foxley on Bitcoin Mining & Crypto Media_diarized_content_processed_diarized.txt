00:00:00.160 - 00:00:28.986, Speaker A: I think a lot of people don't like mining because they don't like tech nerds who are specifically into hardware. And people feel uncomfortable with that. And I can understand that to a degree. But I think once you sort of peel back the layer, you do get one of the most interesting parts of crypto that people just overlook. And at the end of the day, I always like to say, money is social. There's a social level to it. And that's why podcasting, stuff like that matters, right? Yep.
00:00:28.986 - 00:00:49.834, Speaker A: So mining, I think, presents an opportunity to speak to people who otherwise would not care about bitcoin at all. So interesting. So you love the story and the people the most. It is. It is. I mean, especially if we step back and consider the entire, like, crypto world. I mean, bitcoin mining is nothing like smart contract developing, completely different, so far apart.
