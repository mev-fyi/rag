00:00:00.400 - 00:00:46.300, Speaker A: All right, so yesterday, Ethereum developers agreed to include Max EB in the Pectra upgrade. Pektra is the combined upgrade name for the upgrade that's coming up. Developers are aiming to try and get that upgrade implemented on Mainnet before the end of the year. And as you know, or as we've talked about in the show before, these upgrade names have many different names. Pectra is the combined name, but the name that you'll also hear that references the same upgrade is Prague, as well as Electra. Prague references the upgrade that is happening on the execution layer of Ethereum. And Electra is the upgrade name that refers to the upgrade happening on the consensus layer.
00:00:46.300 - 00:00:58.804, Speaker A: And now those two upgrades are happening at the same time on the same day. And so to refer to both of those upgrades and just that upgrade in general, we call the upgrade pectoral.
