00:00:06.720 - 00:00:11.102, Speaker A: Let's go to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, my friend, great to see you.
00:00:11.158 - 00:00:12.394, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:12.854 - 00:00:20.234, Speaker A: So what is going on in markets? I'm a little bit out of the loop here, man, so just bring us up to speed. It's Wednesday, May 17. Tell us what's going on.
00:00:21.094 - 00:00:58.088, Speaker B: Stocks are ripping. S and P broke through local resistance. Nasdaq is close to trend highs. A lot of the price action today, at least, has been driven by optimism around the debt ceiling. You had McCarthy and Biden both give press conferences where they indicated that they're more optimistic outlooks, and the market took that well. On the rate side of things, you've had a pretty meaningful sell off in rates. That's largely been driven by a lack of sort of, of pessimism and sort of concerns around the banking system.
00:00:58.088 - 00:01:56.194, Speaker B: Financials was the best performing sector today in the S and P, up almost 2.5%. It started with one of the distressed regional banks this morning, highlighting that they gained a couple billion in deposits. Obviously, they gained them because they offered competitive rates, but nonetheless, it showed strength and resilience within our banking sector, and that caused price appreciation there and some of the froth in terms of Fed cuts being taken out of the market. So folks are generally now thinking that things are less bad than before. And between debt ceiling and a lack of insane financial stability considerations with banking, that's broadly good for risk assets. And so I think that's why you're seeing stocks trade well. In addition, you've kind of had a resurgence in the dollar over the past.
00:01:56.194 - 00:02:31.370, Speaker B: I want to say week and a half. Neurodollar basically tested up against 111 or 110 80 and rolled over. Same thing with cable. Dollar yen has been perking back up again as the concerns around us, growth and financial stability. And as you've gotten that rate cut pricing a little bit more manageable, not as pronounced, that's led to a reasonable bid in the dollar. And that makes sense because a lot of FX is driven by front end interest rate differentials. Big picture.
00:02:31.370 - 00:03:14.674, Speaker B: We've had constructive things for stocks. The dollar and rates have sold off. Then in crypto, it's doing its own thing right now. But I would say the tether announcement today was insanely meaningful. In my view, the announcement being that they are going to use 15% of operating profits and use that to purchase bitcoin outright. Right now, where things stand, they are the single most profitable business in crypto, making a billion and a half dollars a quarter to give people some context, I think microstrategy has a market cap around $3.5 billion.
00:03:14.674 - 00:03:59.070, Speaker B: So literally, in a couple of quarters, like two and a half quarters, tether could buy all of microstrategy. That's the magnitude of money they're making, and it's really efficient. No overhang. And as long as their aum stays where it's at, they're going to be printing a lot of money. And God forbid, we even put some growth assumptions on their Aum and their interest margins, and then you're really flying. And so I think where it stands right now, the math gets you to around $200 million, a quarter of BTC buy pressure, which is pretty good. And I think that's a constructive headline that can help.
00:03:59.070 - 00:04:36.586, Speaker B: Bitcoin in the near term, I would say, kind of form a base. With stocks trading really well, and us having come off of 30, definitely think that you're close to where I think this last leg of this sell off is going to stop. I think initial support is around 24, 525. You have some other stuff in between there. But with stocks rating this well, with bitcoin taking back 27k today, I think that there's a reasonable chance that you're kind of bottoming. Yeah.
00:04:36.730 - 00:04:39.434, Speaker A: Yeah. This near term sell off may have run out of legs or something.
00:04:39.514 - 00:04:42.530, Speaker B: Yeah, it looks like it's. It's lost a little bit of momentum.
00:04:42.562 - 00:05:01.364, Speaker A: Yeah. The tether announcement is interesting, and, gosh, we have to remind our listeners, like, tether is. It's a great point you made there. They are the biggest business in crypto. Yeah. They're. They've just been printing money, handover, if not to use it, you know, no pun intended, but hand over fist with the.
00:05:01.364 - 00:05:19.044, Speaker A: The rise in interest rates. And they're also. They rolled almost like, whether, you know, coincidentally, out of things like commercial paper and heavily into us debt, you know, starting about a year ago. Right, right. As it happened. So they're. They're earning a lot of money on those treasuries.
00:05:19.704 - 00:05:26.976, Speaker B: No, absolutely. And, you know, I think it's a great sort of company in the standpoint that they're not even levered.
00:05:27.040 - 00:05:27.264, Speaker A: Right.
00:05:27.304 - 00:05:52.352, Speaker B: Like, they're just, you know, all those profits just go back to equity holders. And it's not like microstrategy that bought bitcoin on debt that they issued. This is like, I'm buying bitcoin with the profits that I'm generating from my business that literally probably only needs, like, five people and a couple of, like, outside council law firms to run the essence of what they're doing is just simple money market stuff.
00:05:52.528 - 00:05:53.844, Speaker A: Yeah. And they have it.
00:05:54.464 - 00:06:23.174, Speaker B: My liabilities cost zero because I pay people zero interest and I have assets that give me 5% right now. So it's an unbelievable business model. It's incredibly scalable because it's in the most liquid market on the planet, which is the front end treasury market or the front end money market. And so it's highly scalable, highly profitable. And now that business is actively going to be accumulating bitcoin. I think that's a very constructive development.
00:06:24.344 - 00:06:32.424, Speaker A: Yeah. Wild. You know, their circulating supply of tether, it hasn't quite breached its prior all time high, which was from 83 billion now.
00:06:32.464 - 00:06:33.472, Speaker B: I mean, what? Like.
00:06:33.528 - 00:07:12.436, Speaker A: Yeah, it was like 83.8. I'm just saying, I've been following, waiting to do the, to do the chart. But yes, it's exactly, it is basically risen throughout. It dropped a ton. I think there was a point last year, Charles Yu on my team wrote a great report about this, how they had redeemed something like $12 billion in eight days during the like, big, you know, the initial like, drawdowns from terra and et cetera last year. But basically, since it formed a bottom last June or July, tether supply has just been marching up and it's. And you've now seen, particularly after the collapse of Silicon Valley bank and circles, you know, issues with briefly not being able to redeem.
00:07:12.436 - 00:07:37.434, Speaker A: Because of that circle, supply has been declining while tethers is going up. And it really is this crazy story. Story of. I view it as, you know, what happens when we don't have a clear pro America policy agenda for stable coins in the US. You get companies offshore like tether that can operate fully unconstrained. And they're making it taking advantage of that.
00:07:38.094 - 00:07:38.646, Speaker B: Rightly so.
00:07:38.670 - 00:07:39.862, Speaker A: I mean, they always have to be.
00:07:39.878 - 00:07:57.910, Speaker B: A US based company that's regulated by the US. And, you know, it's. It's a no brainer. I mean, stable coins are incredibly efficient and, you know, provide a source of, you know, like us debt buying and like, which we need help, like dollars, you know, sort of.
00:07:57.942 - 00:08:05.966, Speaker A: Don't we need that badly? Haven't global central banks and sovereign slowly, slowly though, they've been slowly coming off for years. Right.
00:08:05.990 - 00:08:47.345, Speaker B: Like, I'll give you an idea. I mean, like every time, like every day that bills roll off, I think, like the average t bill has like $80 billion, maybe like 120 or 160. And so there's like the entire aum of tether is in like one t bill in the US. And so like, yes, it would help, like if like tether became like a $500 billion thing. But at the, you know, when you have a huge balance sheet like the fed does, and you're talking about, you know, financing, you know, deficit, that's $2 trillion, and national debt, that's 32 trillion, it's a drop in the bucket. It's a kicker.
00:08:47.369 - 00:08:51.089, Speaker A: It's not going to move the needle, but it's nonetheless positive on that side, correct?
00:08:51.121 - 00:08:51.813, Speaker B: I guess.
00:08:52.353 - 00:08:56.293, Speaker A: Anything else that you're watching in the next week or so?
00:08:57.273 - 00:09:29.512, Speaker B: Yeah, I think high level. The market just got very ahead of itself in terms of cut pricing here in the US. I think the risks are a little bit more two sided. The data that we've seen so far, I mean, like unit labor costs, employment costs index, like the labor wage stuff has been really robust. The services inflation has been pretty robust. You're actually starting to get a reasonable uptick in commodity prices after a fall over the past couple of months. Like oil is back to dollar 72 and some other commodities are starting to rebound a bit.
00:09:29.512 - 00:10:11.514, Speaker B: We've also seen a rebound in rentals. The Adobe price index recently that came out highlighted that I think for the month of April, groceries were up like a percent. And so there's still a really tight labor market and there's still inflation. And the 500 basis points of hikes that the Fed is engaged in is barely making a dent. And the US is still 300 basis points away from its inflation target. And the idea, one of the key things about monetary policy is that you need credibility. Not just in the moment, but you need future credibility.
00:10:11.514 - 00:10:58.752, Speaker B: Because let's say the front end is really high. Cause the US is keeping overnight rates high. If the world starts to imply that the Fed's gonna cut in the back end dramatically or in six months from now or nine months from now, the exact opposite of what the Fed wants. That loosens financial conditions. And so for the impact of the interest rate rise to actually feed through to the economy, you need to have a market that buys into the idea that we could be higher for longer. And so you're going to be in a situation where the Fed is basically forced to communicate that strategy and where they're forced to continually strive to maintain their credibility. Think about this.
00:10:58.752 - 00:11:36.992, Speaker B: The market started to price in emergency cuts in July after the Fed hiked most recently. That is to say that the market's like, I get it, pal. You just came out on national television and told everybody you're hiking rates. Even though our banking system looks like it collapses. We think you are so stupid that you will go the other direction in your next meeting. That is what the market tried to do. And so it shows you the lack of credibility and the huge amount of uncertainty in the market as well.
00:11:36.992 - 00:12:12.018, Speaker B: And also just some of, just the liquidity that has broken down in this market just because of how violent some of these recent moves have been. You've got a fed that is staring at data that's still really strong, that's dealing with a credibility issue, maybe a banking crisis at the same time, again, not a job that I want anything to do with. And so if monetary policy was just set in advance, like 21 million tokens or something, you wouldn't have to worry about this. Who knows? Maybe I'm being silly.
00:12:12.146 - 00:12:16.954, Speaker A: I love it. Bibnet Abibi from galaxy trading. My friend, as always, thank you so much.
