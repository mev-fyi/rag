00:00:07.680 - 00:00:12.914, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome back to Galaxy brains.
00:00:13.454 - 00:00:14.714, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:15.574 - 00:00:20.114, Speaker A: Big day today. Fed day, CPI day. Tell us what happened.
00:00:21.694 - 00:01:12.664, Speaker B: So you got a pretty soft CPI print, a 0.2 month on month in core CPI. That was really good reading. You saw some of the hotter points recently cool off a little bit, things like insurance prices and some of the other metrics, but high level. This was a soft inflation print that came in below market expectations, and the substance of it was supportive of continued slowdown in inflation prints on a go forward basis. To caveat that you still have elevated core inflation if you annualize and compound a 0.2 month on month, that actually takes you close to a two seven ish on an annualized basis.
00:01:12.664 - 00:01:51.294, Speaker B: And so that's still above the 2% target. In addition, super core inflation, which is services inflation x shelter, came in 0.22 month on month, and that is a very welcome sort of decline. I believe last month it was 0.42 ish, and so that was a very meaningful decline. However, the headline supercore number is still on an annualized basis is still 4.8%, and so it's a very high number.
00:01:51.294 - 00:02:44.654, Speaker B: And then with the Fed, most importantly, you got pretty meaningful information out of the summary of economic projections and the dot plot. It showed that folks were only expecting one cut in the rest of 2024 and four cuts for 2025. And the market perceived that as a little bit hawkish, especially in the context of a soft inflation print that we got earlier this morning. And so there's a little bit for everyone. I think the main message that Powell tried to get through in the press conference was that they're going to be data dependent. And that's what he's been saying for the past a couple of meetings now. And so you got a bunch of information.
00:02:44.654 - 00:03:22.054, Speaker B: It was more dovish than expected, particularly in the context of the CPI print. That was fairly soft this morning, and you saw a pretty aggressive rate rally that sustained itself. So you're seeing ten year yields at 430 over a ten basis point drop on the day. You've seen equities rally, percent and a half in the Nasdaq, 1.2% on S and P. And so risk is like the number dollar is weaker on it. I think that's an appropriate market reaction.
00:03:22.054 - 00:04:21.564, Speaker B: I would just say, though, that there are still pockets of the economy that are doing great and there are sticky parts of inflation. And ultimately the question about where you can take rates up to or down to on a terminal basis is still up in the air. And if you look at the dot plot, the neutral rate did go up to 2.8%. And so I think that there's more of a realization in the market and from FOMC participants that the long run neutral rate is higher than we had previously thought. And even if you do get a couple of soft inflation prints, it doesn't take away from the fact that the rate that makes the economy not overheat but not contract that much is still higher than where we were thinking it was going to be years ago.
00:04:21.904 - 00:04:31.346, Speaker A: Yeah, I think you're right. Something for everyone. A little bit of a mixed bag here too, with non farm payrolls. Were pretty hot, right? On Friday last week we were hot.
00:04:31.410 - 00:04:31.746, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:04:31.810 - 00:04:36.130, Speaker A: So the employment picture doesn't look like it's slowing down really.
00:04:36.202 - 00:04:36.434, Speaker B: Right.
00:04:36.474 - 00:04:42.282, Speaker A: And now, but, but the, and then also I saw one of the other ones. You correct me on that too, or add your, your actual knowledge of this?
00:04:42.338 - 00:04:49.514, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's so mixed though. Like, they're poor, like, owner pretty, pretty.
00:04:49.554 - 00:04:51.774, Speaker A: Hot in CPI also still, right?
00:04:52.274 - 00:05:40.336, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I think it came in at 0.4. And like, shelter is a big part of people's expenses. And like, yeah, I was in an Uber driver today and he's like, I work six half days a week and I need to pay for a queen's apartment and I'm paying 1500 for a two bedroom. And he's like, when he was in New York a while back, he was paying 600 a month for rent. And so the absolute level of prices is still super high. And just because the rate of which those prices are increasing is cooling doesn't mean that a lot of folks aren't in pain because of how high prices are. And incomes have certainly not kept up with the overall price increase that you've had over the past three years.
00:05:40.336 - 00:06:17.944, Speaker B: Folks have not gotten a 25% raise in the past three years on average. At least. There's still that pain in the market. And that's why I think that the Fed can't be too aggressive or eager to call success on the soft landing. And that's why they probably shouldn't cut rates too quickly or too aggressively. And then looking a little bit ahead, sorry to get off track, but looking a little bit ahead, you also have trumponomics most likely coming. And as we've discussed, that that's inflationary.
00:06:17.944 - 00:06:52.380, Speaker B: But back to your point about the labor market. The data is just so all over the place. So, like, if you look at ISM services and the employment component there, it's like below 50, it's at 47. That's contracting. Last week you had a in jolts, the job openings figure. You've had some of the high frequency data points, like the indeed job data kind of show a slowdown. And ADP came in soft as well, which is the payment processor.
00:06:52.380 - 00:07:44.844, Speaker B: When you throw in a non farm payroll headline number that's 275, you're like, well, that's not consistent with what I've been seeing in other things. But there's also the household survey versus the employer survey or the establishment survey. Sorry. And there's a big disparity between the job figures there. And there's also some other kind of estimates that the Bureau of Labor Statistics puts into the non farm payroll figure, the birth debt stuff in terms of new businesses and how many employees that typically generates and stuff. So there's a lot of weird nuances that make the data picture a little unclear. And the job of the Fed, and this is what Paul is saying, is to have the tools to react in the face of that uncertainty.
00:07:44.844 - 00:08:30.174, Speaker B: And so if you've already cut too much. If too much, and really the price data starts to come in hot, hot again, that, you know, put you in a much worse position in terms of tackling inflation. And on the flip side as well, you can really put yourself in a bind if you're the Fed. And ultimately, they care about their credibility as well. And so they don't want to repeat the same mistakes of COVID thinking that inflation wasn't going to come back. And so they really have to kind of be certain that inflation is going away to really start the easing cycle in a meaningful manner.
00:08:30.554 - 00:08:41.498, Speaker A: Well, lots of interesting information. I saw. It seemed like Powell did say that they won't cut, sorry, they won't hike this year. That that's off the table. The dot plot shows no hikes.
00:08:41.546 - 00:08:41.802, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:41.858 - 00:08:43.802, Speaker A: But we'll check in with you.
00:08:43.818 - 00:09:28.322, Speaker B: It's a busy day. Yeah. I, personally, I think he could be justified in hiking that. There's enough stuff if data goes higher, if we basically had a repeat of the first three months of the year, in terms of the inflation data, I would say that hike should be on the table. But ultimately, I don't think that the Fed should be giving up optionality in any direction because you're one supply shock away. You're a couple of fiscal measures away from the government. They're doing this stuff with Fannie and Freddie where folks might get easier access to home equity loans.
00:09:28.322 - 00:10:14.770, Speaker B: There's some stuff in the works on student loan forgiveness. Long story short, I think there's a lot of politicians with an incentive to make sure that their constituents are feeling wealthier going into the poll booths. And so that's going to be stimulative, and that's inflationary. And then on top of that, you've got a potential presidential candidate that might bring on more inflationary policies. And so I'm of the camp that you're supposed to keep optionality and not limit yourself. And so I wasn't a big fan of taking hikes off the table like that just because you're meant to react to hot data and you just want to preserve that optionality.
00:10:14.962 - 00:10:23.414, Speaker A: Yeah, and that's what they say they're going to do is react to the data. So it is actually a little contradictory. I mean, if the data comes in hot, then they very well might hike. But, you know.
00:10:25.874 - 00:11:28.598, Speaker B: And the other thing to think about is, sorry to keep going on this, but, like, there was a figure, I think we spoke about it last week, but the, there's $3.2 trillion flowing into the economy per quarter just from money market fund dividends and yields on t bills, et cetera, and from dividends from listed companies. And so that's a lot of money and stimulus that's being provided as a function of high interest rate policy. And so there's some folks that are on the more controversial side of, you know, kind of macroeconomic policy that are like, these rates are actually stimulative. And if you look at like, household wealth, you know, wealth per capita in the US, like, all of these things are trending higher. And the positive, you know, rate environment hasn't really hurt stocks that, that much. And folks are also not inclined to sell their home or put their homes up for sale if, if interest rates are low.
00:11:28.598 - 00:12:16.304, Speaker B: And so interest rates are high. And so there's been an element of supply being kept off the market and housing and therefore the prices remaining elevated or staying sticky. There's lots of various elements that the Fed is trying to navigate, but main takeaway from today is you got a soft inflation print, one that you don't have to look too closely at. It's just good. It's not like it's good and bad. For the most part, it's good in the context of the data we've seen, in the context of what the Fed wants to see. And if we see more of those good prints, the Fed will become easier in its monetary policy.
