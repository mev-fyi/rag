00:00:07.800 - 00:01:27.078, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. The battle lines are drawn in I'm calling reserves I'm calling up all my soldiers and shady supercoders it's time to bring the message down directly to the voters bitcoin can't be stopped, yo the network is a cockroach if you drop a bomb dog stop and watch the blocks grow if you try to outlaw you'll need to ban math and words unconstitutional Peter van Valkenberg, the money is a movement we're ready here to do this we're building for the future but I bet you people knew this the use ain't hard to find when the stars align, yo the galaxy appears into view of all divine I'm different when I dip and see me chipping with equipping, flipping magic when I'm ripping like my name was Scottie Pippin, yo I'm gifted cause I'm lifted I always try to elevate today is when we fight so that tomorrow we can celebrate. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital. Thank you for listening to Galaxy Brains show for you today. As I said, Peter van Valkenberg, director of Research at Coin center, is our guest. We're going to get into it deep on the Digital Asset Anti Money Laundering act of 2023, sponsored by Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Roger Marshall and 19 other co sponsors in the Senate, and why it is a major threat to the cryptocurrency industry. We'll also talk with Peter about tornado cash, financial privacy, and a host of other topics.
00:01:27.078 - 00:02:17.160, Speaker A: It's a great interview. We'll also check in with our good friend Bim Netabeebe from Galaxy trading. As always, big day to day fed day today. That really moved markets, and we'll get into it with him. Before we get to all that, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to the disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. I've been very loud about the digital asset anti money Laundering act, and I want to continue to be unlike other bills that have tried to impose additional compliance requirements or regulation on the cryptocurrency industry, which have mostly focused on intermediaries on an off ramp, centralized companies, you know, which is very reasonable in many respects. This bill goes directly at decentralized Internet network participants, unhosted wallets, quote unquote miners nodes.
00:02:17.160 - 00:02:45.876, Speaker A: It is a direct attack on the decentralization and resilience of public blockchain networks. And I believe this type of fight, whether it culminates now, it will eventually come back. This is sort of the big fight to be had. And I encourage everyone to call their us senators, go to Senate Dot Gov Dot. There's a contact area there which will give you the contact information for all of the US senators and encourage them not to vote for this bill. Let's get right into the show. Let's go now to our friend bimnettabibi from Galaxy trading.
00:02:45.876 - 00:02:48.036, Speaker A: As always, bim net. Thank you for coming on, Galaxy brains.
00:02:48.140 - 00:02:49.108, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:02:49.196 - 00:02:49.884, Speaker A: Wow, big day.
00:02:49.924 - 00:02:52.484, Speaker B: Fed day. Unbelievable day. Super Bowl.
00:02:52.564 - 00:03:00.818, Speaker A: Super bowl. And gosh, it is resulting in. We'll just get right into it. It was a big one. They made news at this one. What did they say?
00:03:00.956 - 00:03:25.782, Speaker B: Basically, one, they kept rates unchanged, so they kept them 525 to 550 banned. Two, in the statement, they acknowledged that growth was slowing more than expected versus the last meeting. Three, they updated their dot plot, which indicates that there are going to be 75 basis points of cuts in 2021.
00:03:25.798 - 00:03:27.430, Speaker A: That's the median across all of them.
00:03:27.462 - 00:03:30.550, Speaker B: Now, the median indicates a 75 bip.
00:03:30.582 - 00:03:32.448, Speaker A: Cut versus over next year.
00:03:32.496 - 00:04:19.942, Speaker B: Over next year versus the street side expectation was 50 for the dot plot. So they outdobed the street expectations, but market pricing was closer to 100 already. But that expanded because of the dovishness of the Fed. And for during the Q and A, basically, Powell essentially acknowledged that they're done hiking and that they're not even going to wait till inflation gets to their target. They're going to in advance of that as they see things progressing and slowing, that they're going to be more proactive about cutting. And so it was a dovish message. It reinforced basically what was said by Waller the other week, and the market took it insanely well.
00:04:19.942 - 00:04:50.926, Speaker B: Dollars sold off pretty aggressively. Looking at euro dollar yen, all that stuff. Gold ripped through two k crypto obviously reacted super well with bitcoin. Bitcoin having a plus 4% day, almost testing for 4300, basically 1000 to 2000 points away from the year to date high. Russell was up like 3.5%. Dow Jones new all time highs for the Dow. It is bang on risk, on for risk assets right now.
00:04:50.926 - 00:05:02.072, Speaker B: And if you think about it, we just went from 9% inflation a year and change ago to it looks like, you know, much more manageable levels of inflation.
00:05:02.168 - 00:05:03.404, Speaker A: The three range.
00:05:03.704 - 00:05:35.096, Speaker B: Yeah, we just printed like a month on month headline that was zero. But you know, I personally disagree with the Fed and what they're doing right now, but in terms of what it actually does mean for markets, it means you're good to go to buy risk, at least for the next couple of weeks. And so, you know, that's kind of the camp I'm in. The counter to all that is the services part of the economy is still super hot if you look at like super core inflation from CPI literally yesterday, right, it printed 3.9%.
00:05:35.280 - 00:05:35.624, Speaker A: Right.
00:05:35.664 - 00:05:42.488, Speaker B: And so in the labor market, you're still talking about 199,000 jobs added last month.
00:05:42.576 - 00:05:42.824, Speaker A: Right.
00:05:42.864 - 00:06:37.540, Speaker B: An unemployment rate at 3.6% and a housing market that's still super tight like crazy because people don't really want to sell their homes. And so I think the risk of reinflation is far greater than the Fed is acknowledging. At the same time, I understand that next year is an election year and that if you have inflation coming in around 3% and your Fed funds is set north of five, you have very restrictive interest rate policy and there are cracks in the economy with respect to lower income tiers and some things in the labor market, but it's really not that bad. And also, I'm just like, who the hell is really going to be? I mean, the stock markets back at all times, crypto is ripping like crazy, asset prices are coming back and people are like, oh yeah, that policy might be too restrictive. And we gotta interrupt.
00:06:37.572 - 00:07:00.956, Speaker A: Yes, it is strange too, because they've, you know, we've talked about this before, but Jay Powell has long said that Paul Volcker is not a mentor icon for him. Yes, Paul Volcker dealt with this. They hiked because inflation went up, then inflation started to cool, started cutting, then inflation came roaring back and they had to hike like almost up to 20%. Right. That's what he doesn't want to happen. Right. That's what happens.
00:07:00.956 - 00:07:13.938, Speaker A: If you look at the CPI and the fed funds rate from like the seventies and eighties, that's, that's what happened then. So it does seem like incredibly dovish from, from them after he's been, they've been hammering us with higher for longer for some.
00:07:14.066 - 00:07:16.762, Speaker B: Absolutely. And, and you know what?
00:07:16.818 - 00:07:19.214, Speaker A: It's like tinkering. They're tinkering.
00:07:19.594 - 00:08:04.154, Speaker B: They're traitors like the rest of us. They're, you know, reacting to the data. You know, however, I just, you know, I think you just need a little bit more like big picture understanding of like, where, where things are going. And if you're talking about fiscal policy in an election year, people are going to be just sending money in the mail system, basically, and governments are going to be spending, jobs will be added, et cetera. And that's inflationary. Then the other big thing, every fed, I'm like, bitcoin makes more and more sense, don't get me wrong, partially because I'm very biased with respect to crypto and I work at a crypto. I don't think anyone would be surprised.
00:08:04.194 - 00:08:08.538, Speaker A: To know that you and Galaxy are long bitcoin. Correct? I think it's pretty well known.
00:08:08.666 - 00:08:16.242, Speaker B: Fair enough. But it's like, okay, how did the curve react to the interest rate decision today? It steepened.
00:08:16.298 - 00:08:16.514, Speaker A: Right.
00:08:16.554 - 00:08:24.658, Speaker B: Two thirty s, two ten s, et cetera. And that's because the front end went. But what you have to think about is the deficit stuff isn't going away.
00:08:24.706 - 00:08:25.226, Speaker A: Right.
00:08:25.370 - 00:08:27.618, Speaker B: Those long term bonds still have to get funded.
00:08:27.666 - 00:08:28.082, Speaker A: I just saw that.
00:08:28.098 - 00:08:31.144, Speaker B: And the Fed's still engaging in their balance sheet reduction.
00:08:31.314 - 00:08:31.692, Speaker A: Right.
00:08:31.748 - 00:09:23.918, Speaker B: And what do you think? The deficit's not going to expand in an election year. And so you're still dealing with a situation where the long term fiscal viability of the US and the ballooning interest payments because we've raised interest rates so high and we've got to constantly refinance as bonds mature. That's still a huge issue. And like easing rates in the front end helps. But the Fed is telling you simultaneously that's, and the market's telling you that it's okay to buy risk assets again, but that the long term stuff is still shaky. And so I'm like, wait, bitcoin is a risk asset in lots of ways and it also is a good gauge for long term fiscal viability. I just keep seeing this curve steepener trade and thinking, bitcoin, bitcoin, bitcoin.
00:09:23.918 - 00:09:25.398, Speaker B: And I'm not the first person.
00:09:25.486 - 00:09:30.918, Speaker A: I see what you're pointing out, though. You're saying with the shaky long term thing, that's telling you to look at something like bitcoin.
00:09:31.006 - 00:09:31.486, Speaker B: Correct.
00:09:31.590 - 00:09:35.154, Speaker A: The short term risk on. That's also telling you to look at something like bitcoin.
00:09:36.774 - 00:09:44.838, Speaker B: But again, that's like you're talking to a very bitcoin bias person. But I literally, I mean, the fiscal stuff is just insane.
00:09:44.926 - 00:09:55.894, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And maybe that's part of the impetus for trying to lower, agreeing to lower or also easing pressure on the banking system, which itself has been rocked by the rates. Right. There's those types of reasons maybe to push forward here.
00:09:55.934 - 00:10:22.054, Speaker B: No, absolutely. And then the other thing I'd like to highlight and what you brought up before this Arcanvo was how wrong central bankers have been historically. Everyone is pretty much awful at forecasting inflation. And so you've got these markets, whether it's the bank of England, the RBA, the Fed, pick your central bank of choice, and the interest rate forward path looks like pretty steep cuts that are getting baked in and more and more.
00:10:22.714 - 00:10:25.042, Speaker A: As they become more dovish.
00:10:25.178 - 00:10:34.602, Speaker B: But at the same time, people are really bad at forecasting stuff. And all the time people get stuff wrong. And the magnitude of what's priced now, you're priced to perfection.
00:10:34.698 - 00:10:35.658, Speaker A: Right. Right.
00:10:35.706 - 00:10:42.410, Speaker B: Like if you think long run inflation is somewhere between two and 3%, terminal rates are now like 320 ish.
00:10:42.562 - 00:10:42.922, Speaker A: Right.
00:10:42.978 - 00:11:12.776, Speaker B: And the fed terminal dots are like two and three quarters a little bit higher than that. And so you're basically priced to perfection in terms of the cut stuff. And I know that, like, and the pal is telling you he's going to be more reactive than he past policymakers because probably going to be looking at more of the high frequency stuff and he doesn't want to cut when inflation gets to 2%. But it's more like right before seeing where stuff is going. And so I'm just like, yeah, so.
00:11:12.800 - 00:11:15.960, Speaker A: There could be more interest rate volatility. There has to be.
00:11:15.992 - 00:11:20.484, Speaker B: There has to be. And also, which, by the way, is.
00:11:20.824 - 00:11:22.304, Speaker A: That also contrasts with bitcoin.
00:11:22.384 - 00:11:23.120, Speaker B: Yeah, fair enough.
00:11:23.152 - 00:11:23.888, Speaker A: Which is highly credible.
00:11:23.936 - 00:11:42.528, Speaker B: Let's all acknowledge what the financial system is. Right. It's a game of musical chairs. All these assets are inflated. The magnificent seven trading at insane multiples. The bond market now nearly priced to perfection. And you got crypto ripping like crazy.
00:11:42.528 - 00:12:00.000, Speaker B: Memes ripping like crazy. I mean, I wouldn't be shocked if you had those, I can't name the single names, but the popular meme stocks doing well again. And so it's just so much froth. And are we just not concerned about reinflation? Am I going crazy here?
00:12:00.192 - 00:12:28.658, Speaker A: I don't know. We're going to have to wait and see. I should point out that the Fed for really a long time has been sort of signaling that this rate cuts would eventually come. Right. And you were saying many months ago that the Fed prior, looking at prior Fed speak, that they were effectively telling you to buy risk assets. And of course, you pointed out, I mean, the Dow Jones Industrial average index today, at all time highs today equities are basically at all time highs. And had a great year.
00:12:28.736 - 00:12:29.950, Speaker B: Phenomenal year.
00:12:30.102 - 00:12:31.726, Speaker A: And so did other risk assets.
00:12:31.790 - 00:12:58.302, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, if you t read the Fed properly, basically, like, you basically had to understand what pal's response function was when the data first started slowing, like, or when. And if data started slowing, how was he gonna respond? And I thought, you know, earlier in the year, you got a sense that his response function is, oh, I'm gonna normalize policy pretty aggressively. It was kind of my reading, he.
00:12:58.318 - 00:13:01.918, Speaker A: Doesn'T want to stay higher for longer. He just does it. But I think.
00:13:01.966 - 00:13:28.310, Speaker B: I think the data, though, it may require, I mean, you go out and there's, people are still spending money, lots of it. It's the one boon to this market and to the Fed that I think the market's probably not properly appreciating is gas prices. We're talking about 1011 straight weeks of decline. Crudes at sub $70 right now.
00:13:28.382 - 00:13:33.270, Speaker A: Gasoline at the pump is sub $3 everywhere I look, basically. And that's been a while since that was.
00:13:33.302 - 00:13:43.918, Speaker B: And that impacts your sentiment, that impacts where you think future inflation is going to be. Right. And what's an important factor for determining future inflation? Expectations of future inflation.
00:13:44.006 - 00:13:59.350, Speaker A: It says, wait a second, prices are coming down because one of the only things that you go, if you go to the supermarket, maybe you look at the price that's usually written next to the item. But most people don't buy that many things where the price is literally in a big giant led board flashing right at you.
00:13:59.422 - 00:14:00.062, Speaker B: Correct.
00:14:00.238 - 00:14:09.674, Speaker A: That truly is gas prices, gasoline at the pump. That is probably the main place where americans see an index on inflation.
00:14:10.894 - 00:14:26.982, Speaker B: Grocery stores, et cetera. And now that we're talking about inflation this way, I think it's always important to reiterate that inflation measures the rate of change of prices, not the absolute level. And so all we're seeing is the rate of change of prices is now cooling.
00:14:27.038 - 00:14:27.886, Speaker A: It's decelerating.
00:14:27.950 - 00:14:31.444, Speaker B: It's decelerating, but it's still going up. Is still going up.
00:14:31.824 - 00:14:32.280, Speaker A: Right.
00:14:32.352 - 00:14:51.624, Speaker B: Although I've read some stuff on the housing stuff, looks like it's going to start declining meaningfully in the figures, at least. Cause there's a lead lag effect and also just a lot more supply hitting the market. But outside of that, prices are not back to where they were before we printed $7 trillion.
00:14:51.744 - 00:14:52.728, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:14:52.816 - 00:14:54.832, Speaker B: And mailed out money to every single person.
00:14:54.928 - 00:15:03.330, Speaker A: We've talked about this. They haven't really admitted policymakers, whether in the federal government or the central bank, they haven't really told people that, like, guys, that's never going to happen.
00:15:03.402 - 00:15:06.578, Speaker B: I don't even think Biden properly understands that inflation, I'm not sure.
00:15:06.626 - 00:15:11.322, Speaker A: So Bimnet Abibi, my friend from galaxy trading. Thanks for coming on Galaxy brains, as.
00:15:11.338 - 00:15:13.054, Speaker B: Always, thank you for having me.
00:15:14.714 - 00:15:21.066, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, Peter van Valkenberg, director of research from Coin Center. Peter, thank you so much for coming on Galaxy brains.
00:15:21.250 - 00:15:22.514, Speaker C: It's a pleasure, Alex.
00:15:22.634 - 00:16:07.236, Speaker A: I'm excited to have Peter. I've been following Peter's work for a long time. He has a phenomenal, I think, house testimony a while ago explaining bitcoin, one of the best explanations I've seen in about two minutes that we'll link to in the show notes. But in general, coincenter does great work across a range of policy and legal topics that affect the cryptocurrency industry. But the reason, the catalyst to have Peter on this week is the Digital Asset Anti Money Laundering act of 2023, sponsored primarily by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Roger Marshall. I'm very agitated about it, and I've been writing about it and tweeting about it and talking about it. But Peter and his team at Coin center have covered the issues that are at play in this bill for years.
00:16:07.236 - 00:16:19.780, Speaker A: And so I want to get into it with him on that and then talk a little bit about coincenter and stuff. But, Peter, before we get into that, give us a little bit of your background. How did you find yourself? Director of research at the premier crypto think tank in Washington, DC. Peter.
00:16:19.812 - 00:16:56.970, Speaker C: So I have a background as a lawyer. I went to NYU law back in 2012 to 2014 or 2011 2014, and graduated, wanted to work in public policy because I didn't want to take on clients. So came to Washington, DC. It wasn't long after that that Jerry Brito, our executive director at Coin center, found me and said, hey, I saw that you wrote a little bit about bitcoin from a legal perspective. I'm starting a bitcoin think tank. This is 2014, so this is early days, relatively speaking. Do you want to be the director of research? And I said, that's a completely insane job pitch, and I would be completely insane not to do it.
00:16:56.970 - 00:17:10.746, Speaker C: And so I've been lucky to be at coin center since, since we started, and I've been, as you mentioned, lucky to testify before Congress about these technologies. The hearing, I think you're talking about with the really good short.
00:17:10.810 - 00:17:13.866, Speaker A: Yeah. The two minute clip that people love was that Senator House, I guess Senate House.
00:17:13.890 - 00:17:46.762, Speaker C: That was actually the Senate, and it was Senate bank. And Elizabeth Warren actually asked questions in that hearing, and she wasn't hostile at the time. She just wanted to know that securities laws would apply to icos because it was around the time of the big ICo boom. And I think my answer was, yeah, if people are expecting profits from an issuer and they're trusting the issuer, then, yeah, the securities laws are probably the right laws to apply in that context. Then I clarified that. But there are coins like bitcoin, for example, that have no trusted issuer, and therefore securities laws are inappropriate to apply. And she seemed satisfied with that answer at the time.
00:17:46.762 - 00:17:57.298, Speaker C: Since then, she's obviously become much more aggressive towards the technology writ large, let alone just icos or the obvious scams out there. And it's unfortunate.
00:17:57.466 - 00:18:33.336, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. She has been. She. Her own statement was that she's raising a, quote, anti crypto army. It's really surprising to me that what this says about her donor base or what she thinks about her constituents, because the only when I look at the polling data on sentiment on cryptocurrencies, right, like, we just published a report about this last week about the great wealth transfer and how older people view crypto and blockchain much less favorably than younger people. She's courting an older voter base with this. With this.
00:18:33.336 - 00:18:49.088, Speaker A: Something like 63% of millennials and youngers view crypto favorably versus, like, 20% of baby boomers. So, like it. Because. Which is typically a strange. I guess. I mean, maybe we could be cynical about who gets out and votes. Right? Like, I mean, young people have been notoriously bad at voting.
00:18:49.216 - 00:19:13.634, Speaker C: Yeah, it's unfortunate. This is why I try and stick to legal analysis and to just application of rule of law on constitutional principles, because I'm terrible at politics. I don't understand how it works, and I try to avoid getting into people's heads. So I can't speculate as to why she's taken this approach. It is stunning to see someone with her track record just like, uniformly agreeing with Jamie Dimon in a hearing, right.
00:19:13.754 - 00:19:14.850, Speaker A: It is stunning.
00:19:15.042 - 00:19:16.090, Speaker C: It's odd.
00:19:16.282 - 00:19:49.094, Speaker A: You and I, I think we're of similar age. And Occupy Wall street was sort of right around, like, my college, informative adult, early adult years. And to see that movement effectively, what was born out of that movement, one of the main things was the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which she was the first head of. But to now have her directly aligning with the banks, to be clear, this digital. We'll talk about her bill. But the bank policy institute is quoted directly in the press release. It's a bill that she's written with the banks, basically.
00:19:49.094 - 00:20:13.650, Speaker A: It's just. It's weird. You know, I always joke too. Like if you had, if when I was a kid, if you'd grown up and you'd say, well, like, what political party do most of Wall street belong to? Like the obvious answer, you would just say, would probably be Republican. But now you've got the sort of the far, the leader of the left wing financial policy allying with Jamie Dimon, the CEO of America's largest bank. Just a bizarre situation.
00:20:13.722 - 00:20:28.402, Speaker C: There's always strange bedfellows in crypto, but they're usually like nice alliance stories, like, you know, where we can get a Democrat or Republican to agree on something for a change. It's like, oh yeah, innovation, right? There's also strange bedfellows on the other side, which is becoming more and more of a trend.
00:20:28.538 - 00:20:36.186, Speaker A: So let's go into this bill in particular, the digital Asset Anti Money Laundering Act. I call it daml. I don't know if that's an acronym.
00:20:36.210 - 00:20:42.338, Speaker C: They're actually, I'll probably call it the Warren Marshall bill throughout this conversation because that's what we started calling it internally.
00:20:42.466 - 00:21:37.876, Speaker A: And they're the two primary co sponsors. So I'll just set this up really quickly. But if you could tell us what's in this bill, and, you know, the gist is that unlike other things we've seen say in comprehensive regulatory proposals from, like, whether it's like Stabenow Bozeman or Lummis Gillibrand or the stablecoin stuff or whatever, which mostly deal with how businesses operate in the cryptocurrency industry, this bill seeks to impose bank like regulations on network participants, specifically digital asset wallet providers and unhosted wallets, which is just wallets and self custody wallets, but even miners and validators, and they even specify in the text of the Bill Mev, like searchers and stuff. So it's, we're now not talking about businesses, but we're talking about software, right? And the users of software. To me, that's what's so troubling. Am I forgetting, what am I missing? What else is in there? Like, what's your just overall explanation of this bill?
00:21:38.060 - 00:22:47.354, Speaker C: That we can go into finer details, but 100% that's the main issue here is that this is not a bill that's proposing reasonable regulation of trusted intermediaries in the crypto space. This is a bill that wants to register and find financial reporting coming from people who are running a node in their house, people who are operating a self hosted wallet, which is just a wallet, like you said, because they want to hold their own bitcoin. That is a big change. The first version of this bill was introduced actually December of last year, and it hasn't changed much since then. She's gotten a couple more co sponsors for the reintroduction now. And at the time we wrote a blog post and we said, look, we've been around waiting for this, but most of the work we've done to date in 2022, from 2014 to 2022, was sort of helping politicians understand the unintended consequences of their laws. Like, oh, there's a bitlicence they want to regulate the custodial exchanges in New York, but they've accidentally drafted the language to be so broad that they might sweep in node operators or things like that.
00:22:47.354 - 00:23:39.596, Speaker C: So we have to go in and have a briefing and say, this is how these networks work. There are trusted participants on these networks who probably should be the target of regulation, and then there are people who are just running software for their own purposes, who it would be constitutionally inappropriate to target for regulation, and also who, you know, it just would be anti innovation and you wouldn't achieve the consumer protection goals that you have in mind. But this bill, and we said this in the blog post, in 2022, is the first time where it's not a mistake. It's not, oops, we drafted the law too broad. We're covering a bunch of people who are mostly engaged in free speech like activities or personal financial transactions. There's a very deliberate attempt here to cover those persons with regulations. The other thing I want to point out is, because this was introduced last year, originally, I think it was very deliberately introduced right in the wake of the FTX collapse.
00:23:39.596 - 00:24:23.180, Speaker C: There was a sort of like, great troubled period in crypto history, which was deplorable and sad. From three arrows capital to Terra Luna to FTX, ultimately, we had these massive implosions of trusted corporations in the crypto space and people losing real money. And the response to that, from a regulatory standpoint, is we need new rules to protect people. Right. And that's actually a reasonable response. I would quibble with it, and I would say, actually, all the laws that we already had in place just needed to be enforced. And that's why we see SBF being brought to trial and why we see people actually, you know, like, bearing the costs of their bad actions and having consequences for those bad actions.
00:24:23.180 - 00:25:08.564, Speaker C: But this bill came around that period where, you know, Congress was just ready to finally step in and be the adults and fix this messy sector. And I can see why that would gain some sympathy, especially from the larger public who thinks like, well, it just looks like the Wild west out there and people are losing their money. But the thing about the Warren Marshall bill is it was brought up in the, in the context of the FTX collapse and people losing money. It does nothing to stop people from losing their money. It doesn't attempt to create prudential standards to make sure that custodians have the assets that they're promising their customers they have. It doesn't have risk calibrated standards for like minimum capitalization or customer disclosures. It's not an investor protection bill at all.
00:25:08.564 - 00:26:12.738, Speaker C: This is, as you mentioned, bank like financial regulation, but it has nothing to do with prudential like safety and soundness regulation. There's none of that in this bill. The only aspect of bank regulation this creates for these entities in crypto is financial surveillance. It says if you are operating a node, if you are mining, if you are holding your own bitcoin in a wallet, a self hosted wallet, to use their terminology, then you need to know your customer, which is kind of ridiculous in the self hosted wallet context, obviously, or in the mining context, because none of these people have customers. And the implication is you need to know every name, physical address, Social Security number of every person behind every transaction you deal with. So if you were a minor putting these transactions into blocks, you could be found on the wrong side of this law and prosecuted. If this was to become law for not knowing the name and physical address of all the people who wanted transactions in your blog, it's absolutely unenforceable, nonsensical, if you actually understand how the technology works.
00:26:12.738 - 00:26:28.574, Speaker C: But again, I don't think it's a mistake. I think it's intentional. They don't want it to be enforceable or make sense with respect to the technology. They basically are outlawing the technology by mandating a type of surveillance activity that makes no sense for the entities that would be obligated to do that. Surveillance.
00:26:28.904 - 00:27:09.730, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the case, when I think of wallets and miners validators, we'll call them like block builders in general, the wallets themselves, many of them. Bitcoin core itself is a wallet. It's open source, free technology. You can't ban it without banning a web browser. You can go and download this. There is no centralized entity that functionally could comply with even knowing who's downloading it, right? Like it's on GitHub, you can compile it from source, it's free software, it's available globally. And by the way, there's many of those, right? I mean, all the, I mean, all the core clients themselves have a wallet and they're all, they're all free, they're all fast, basically.
00:27:09.730 - 00:27:38.604, Speaker A: Yeah. So that one, that one is, that one harms directly individual people, right. Who may be unable to download a wallet, and it forces everybody into centralized, theoretically, if you want to comply with this, you'd have to only use hosted wallets. And they theoretically want that because they can address those centralized hosted companies. If they're mad at you, like if you're a canadian trucker or yes, if you're a foreign terrorist, they can just call up your custodian and be like, give me his bitcoin.
00:27:40.264 - 00:28:19.484, Speaker C: I think that's right. But it almost still giving too much credit, because if that was the goal, they'd just outlaw these things. This notion that we'll will just apply KYC regulation to these entities, even though that makes no sense, it's a sort of almost bad faith way of banning those activities, or it just manifestly misunderstands those activities, or it's a way of selling a ban as not a ban. Oh, we're just applying rules to these entities. But the right way to think about the way they're applying these rules would be, is if you said that everybody who operates an Internet server needs to know the name and physical address of every packet that travels over their server. The Internet would break. It would stop working.
00:28:20.064 - 00:28:47.550, Speaker A: Exactly. Thinking about the miners and validators, to your point, it is structurally a wallet developer. If they're not an open source, decentralized thing on GitHub, but they somehow make a wallet, maybe they could comply. Maybe possible, theoretically. But the miners really are structurally incapable of performing this function. It would effectively ban mining and validating in the United States, in my opinion. Right.
00:28:47.550 - 00:29:26.714, Speaker A: Like, there's no, there is truly no way to actually do this. Right? You can't. And even if somebody tried, I envision like, you may have like a private white listed pool emerge, mining or validating pool, but that would effectively bifurcate the entire network itself. You'd end up having like, us government approved blocks and then, like, which probably wouldn't actually even happen. But if, if somebody in a mining business or a validator business decided to try to stay and comply, that's probably what they'd have to do. And that would also be bad for the network too. But in my view, most of this, to your point, is structurally incapable of being done by those entities they're targeting.
00:29:27.734 - 00:30:07.924, Speaker C: There'd be entities who would try to comply. There'd be entities who would leave. And so these activities would just go overseas and continue to carry on overseas. The outcome is not what you would want either from a pro innovation standpoint, because obviously it's phenomenally bad for innovation because it basically outlaws a very vibrant area of permissionless technologies and Internet technologies. But it's also not what you would want from a law enforcement or anti terrorism policy either. Like if you actually talk to folks at the FBI or even at FinCEN, the division of treasury, that actually enforces Bank Secrecy act law. And this amends the Bank Secrecy act for those who aren't following along with the laws at home.
00:30:07.924 - 00:30:41.356, Speaker C: If you talk to these folks who have their, like, feet on the ground and are doing investigations, the useful information they get comes from custodial exchanges. And where they have gaps is not a bunch of people making self hosted wallet transfers or miners not reporting the information they would get from miners would be garbage. It would be nonsensical. It wouldn't aid in investigations. The place where they have gaps is noncompliant foreign exchanges, the guarantexes of the world, the Russian based or, you know, Lotso. Yeah, yeah. And, you know, we're slowly chipping away at that.
00:30:41.356 - 00:31:02.060, Speaker C: What's the answer to that problem is more. More money for enforcement, more money for resources to go after noncompliant custodial exchanges. It's not to go on a wild goose chase where we're going to chase down every person who's sharing open source software on the Internet and running a wallet with it. That is a tremendous waste of anti terrorism resources and anti money laundering resources.
00:31:02.172 - 00:31:31.850, Speaker A: Yeah. And it creates a giant data. There's privacy reasons why it's problematic. I mean, I'm going to ask you about that in a second, but I want to point out that when she, Senator Warren asked questions at the Senate banking hearing, I guess, last week, and I think last Wednesday, and Jamie Dimon, in a much quoted quote, he said, I've never been a fan of crypto. If I was the government, I would ban it. The question she had asked was, shouldn't crypto firms have to do the same compliance as banks? And they were all like, yeah, they should. Sure.
00:31:31.850 - 00:31:47.644, Speaker A: The banks love that. Right. There's a competition thing here going on, by the way. The banks basically have sponsored this bill. The bank policy institute is quoted directly in the press release, as well as the Massachusetts Bankers association, some, various others. Right. So there's an anti competitiveness nature to the bill, in my opinion, as well.
00:31:48.384 - 00:31:50.160, Speaker C: There's transparent irony.
00:31:50.272 - 00:32:12.934, Speaker A: Yeah. But crypto firms as the senator's question asked, they do already comply. Galaxy is a crypto firm. We work with Fincen. We do Kyc on all of our counterparties and LP's, and they file SARS. They conform to the. As money transmission, as money transmitters, or msbs, as they're mostly money services businesses, as today.
00:32:13.054 - 00:32:13.902, Speaker C: Right, exactly.
00:32:14.038 - 00:32:15.982, Speaker A: So does crypto firms in the US.
00:32:16.038 - 00:32:20.750, Speaker C: Do finance just paid $4 billion in fines for failing to do this kind of.
00:32:20.822 - 00:32:41.892, Speaker A: Exactly. So, yeah, that can be enforced. And this is one of the things that really does suggest that this bill itself is sort of a de facto backdoor ban because. And it's intended to be that because the way she's talking about it publicly makes it sound like businesses are who the bill will target. But actually, this targets decentralized Internet network participants. Yeah.
00:32:41.988 - 00:33:44.264, Speaker C: Individuals, and in many cases, just individuals who want to protect their own privacy for perfectly legitimate reasons, like ordinary Americans who would just like to hold their own crypto in their own wallet and just want to be left alone. This gets to another thing. So, like, when this bill first dropped last year, it was also not long after the russian invasion of Ukraine, and there was widespread talk of, like, is Russia using crypto to evade the more aggressive sanctions that were now imposing to sort of punish them for that violent aggression against a smaller nation. And the answer roundly, and I remember Jonathan Levin from chainalysis testifying in front of Elizabeth Warren, when Elizabeth Warren kept. Senator Warren kept asking Johnny Levin, like, are russian oligarchs using crypto to move money out of Russia? He kept saying no. In his very great basso continual voice, he said, no, no. There's simply not enough volume and liquidity to move the amount of money that russian oligarchs would like to move through crypto, and we don't see it.
00:33:44.264 - 00:34:20.512, Speaker C: And we're chainalysis. If anyone sees it, we would see it. And she just didn't accept the answer. And this bill was in addition to, I think, a response in some ways to FTX, like, oh, crypto looks bad now, so now's the time to come and target it, basically, even though this has nothing to do with investor protection. It also was an opportune moment because of the russian invasion. And I hate to be so blunt about this, but it remains an opportune moment because of the tragedy we've seen in the Middle east with respect to the palestinian attack on Israel. This all gets linked to crypto, even though time and time again we see headlines.
00:34:20.512 - 00:35:06.486, Speaker C: Crypto used to launder money to go to Hamas crypto used by russian oligarchs. And then when investigation actually happens, we find out the amount of money, as far as the percentage that these bad actors are actually moving through crypto is a tiny de minimis amount of the money that they get from the traditional banking system from just moving physical cash over borders. Like crypto is not a big part of this anti terrorism geopolitical story. But it keeps coming up because the geopolitics becomes a rationale, I think, to do what you already wanted to do, which is just to crush an industry that for some reason you didn't like. Maybe it's because you're trying to help banks compete with a new rival. Maybe it's ideological. Again, I can't speculate as to exactly what the motives are, but it just seems opportunistic.
00:35:06.486 - 00:35:48.330, Speaker C: And the other thing we wrote about in our post was, look, this is unconstitutional in our us system. If you're actually going to stop people from being able to operate and share open source software, and as you said, all this node software, all this core wallet client software miner software, is speechless. And if you're going to stop people from being able to distribute that, you're putting a prior restraint on speech. And you have a Fourth Amendment problem here. The Fourth Amendment says, you know, before the government comes and collects a bunch of private information about me, they should get a warrant from a judge. It's not an unreasonable thing to require because it just stops prosecutorial abuse. It stops the investigator from saying, like, I don't like Peter, I'm going to go search his home now.
00:35:48.330 - 00:36:49.522, Speaker C: He says, no, you know, first you have to go before a judge, and the judge will say, do you have a good reason to suspect Peter, Peter? And if they do, then they'll get the warrant, right? In the financial surveillance context, we don't have a warrant protection when our records are kept by banks because of something called the third party doctrine, which we can get into if we have time, or we can talk about offline, or you can read stuff on Coin Center's website. But the fact of the matter is, when you're not keeping your money at a bank, when you are keeping it on, say, a device you have in your home, like a hardware wallet or software wallet that you run on your personal computer, you still have the protection of a warrant. It's guaranteed by our Fourth Amendment in our constitution. And so saying that because you're operating bitcoin software in your home, you now need to report on the transactions that you're making and everyone else is making that touch your software or your miner or your node or your computer is just an anathema to our constitutional system. And this brings me back to the, you know, the Vladimir Putin, the Vladimir Putin rationale for this act in some regards. The russian oligarchs are using crypto, so we need this law. No, America is the country.
00:36:49.522 - 00:37:24.910, Speaker C: It is and is different from Russia and is different from North Korea because of our constitution, because we trust our populace to have a certain amount of freedom and the ability to do a certain amount of financial transactions as well as other speech and communications activities without having to first seek permission from the government. And so if this is really about national security, you have to ask, what are we protecting? We're protecting what it is to be american. And so if in the name of national security, we destroy what it is to be american, we've just. We've ruined ourselves.
00:37:25.102 - 00:38:09.910, Speaker A: That's a great point, Peter. Let's talk a little bit about tornado cash, which you guys have also been very involved in since we're on the topic of privacy and sort of finding. So when Tornado cash, just for quick background for the audience, I think most of our audience probably knows, but they were added by FinCEN, by OFAC to the SDN list, which is the specially designated foreign nationals list. It's the list of sanctioned entities by the United States financial sanctions. And when you're added that to that list, it prohibits Americans from doing any financial business with you. Right. They actually had added the smart contract addresses themselves for the decentralized application, tornado cash, which is a privacy enhancing application, often referred to.
00:38:09.910 - 00:38:38.774, Speaker A: It's different than this. There are many, but referred to broadly as what? Anonymizing services by the government. That includes things like mixers and tumblers and whatnot. So it was sanctioned because they believed or have evidence that. And I don't know that they don't. I mean, I'm just saying they allege that the north korean, north korean hackers, the Lazarus group, et cetera, had laundered funds through tornado cash. And I wrote at the time that, you know, well, they probably did.
00:38:38.774 - 00:38:59.110, Speaker A: I'm not denying that criminals have used the tool. There's a whole bunch here I want to unpack with you and ask you to explain this to us. But one of the things I pointed out, and it goes to your prior point, I wrote about this, we wrote a good report about the tornado cash thing that was quite principled. And I pointed out, you know, obfuscating the origin of funds is not illegal. That's privacy. It's totally allowed. It's not even money laundering.
00:38:59.110 - 00:39:05.046, Speaker A: It's only money laundering if you skate. The origin of funds and the origin of funds was a crime, right?
00:39:05.070 - 00:39:06.486, Speaker C: Like, and you know that.
00:39:06.550 - 00:39:07.894, Speaker A: And you know that it's a crime, right?
00:39:08.014 - 00:39:08.358, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:39:08.406 - 00:39:29.656, Speaker A: Like, there's nothing that stops me. Let's say. In fact, there's. Who is it? Is it Janice, the basketball player? I think he said that he keeps his money in like 50 different us banks, like, in tiny little pieces because he's from Greece that has a bank. He's a history of this being a problem. Yeah. And if you wanted to, you could just go and put little bits of money all over the world just because you want to make it hard to find your money.
00:39:29.656 - 00:39:43.960, Speaker A: That's actually totally allowed as long as you're not laundering or obfuscating the origin of crimes, that of money that derives from crime. So just pointing out, like, privacy is totally legal, but you guys got involved in tornado cash. Yeah.
00:39:44.032 - 00:40:27.652, Speaker C: In fact, I bring this up just because sometimes people think that this is a partisan issue these days. And that makes me sad because it's not always like you get strange Benfellas on both sides. One of the most clear sort of defenses of people's right to structure their financial transactions as long as they're not actually knowingly trying to evade the law, is a great opinion from Ruth Bader Ginsburg when she was still on the court. And she just makes it clear we can't start criminalizing the mere fact that somebody made a bunch of small transactions. There cannot be culpability. There's. There can be culpability only if you have knowledge and intent to actually further some illegal act or move some proceeds of some illegal act.
00:40:27.788 - 00:41:07.732, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And to your point, on privacy and partisanship, right. There was the trucker movement, which, whatever the politics of it aside, the government of Canada took people's money. I read stories about a grandmother who had donated money to this movement and her bank accounts were seized and frozen. But then you have in the US, take the ruling on abortion at the Supreme Court, and you've now got people that are being put in jail in certain states if they seek one or if they even, like, request a quote for one. Right. Like, and again, there's plenty of reasons on all sides, I think, for politics in the US for people to support.
00:41:07.788 - 00:41:51.818, Speaker C: Privacy, especially because we used to make almost all of our financial transactions in the US, peer to peer. Like, most day to day transactions would have been done using cash. The handful of transactions that would go through a bank and therefore, be subject to a financial surveillance regime would have been like big purchases, like an automobile, maybe not even an automobile, but definitely like a mortgage for a home. At that point, the trade off between security and privacy seems somewhat reasonable. This notion that like every financial transaction you make should go to some centralized database in the US government to make sure that you're not a criminal. It sort of shows incredible bad faith as to the goodness of your average american and incredible desire for power at a high level. That, of course, could be abused or hacked and then abused by the wrong people.
00:41:51.818 - 00:42:48.134, Speaker C: So to go back to the tornado cache thing just to. So we're actually, we're suing OFAC because of that tornado cache designation. And, you know, we're not, we're not arguing that it's wrong to identify some loose group of people who develop tornado cash as potentially a sanctionable entity. We're not arguing that it's right either, but we're just saying, you know, we don't know the details of that. The only thing we're arguing, it's a very important but, but very narrow point, is the smart contracts themselves, which are immutable and on the Ethereum blockchain, are just software tools. Like the developers we know for a fact, because of the way Ethereum operates, have no ability to change that software in the future, and they don't directly benefit in any way from its continued usage. And so if I, as an ordinary American, want to have privacy with respect to a payment, to, say, my friend Niraj at coin center, another ordinary American, and I want to do it on Ethereum, I should be able to send money to that smart contract.
00:42:48.134 - 00:43:20.384, Speaker C: And that smart contract sends money to Niraj. At no point is any sanctioned entity involved. It's just two Americans wanting to protect their privacy using a piece of software that exists on a blockchain. That software should not be considered property of a sanctioned entity if that entity has no control over it, and if it's just Americans using it for their own privacy, we have a real right to use that. And it's not something that the statute should preclude us from doing. So that's our lawsuit. We're in the middle of appealing in the 11th circuit in Florida.
00:43:20.844 - 00:44:01.934, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's right. I don't think there's no prohibition on privacy. That's not illegal. Privacy is not a crime. So I think it's a principled argument. I think we're really, me and many others in our space are very grateful that you guys are doing that work. Just to add another example, you talk about you sending Niraj money for a tungsten cube or something like that, right? Vitalik donated to the ukrainian side of the Ukraine conflict and did his donation through tornado cash because I think he wanted to contribute, but he said, I don't necessarily need to reveal everything about all of my other holdings just to do this donation.
00:44:02.314 - 00:44:31.404, Speaker C: Actually one of our totally reasonable use. Yeah, one of our co plaintiffs in our lawsuit. So we're challenging as coin center. We're one of the plaintiffs because we receive donations through tornado cash. Because some of our donors want to protect their privacy. They don't want to reveal to the whole world that they happen to support one or another civil advocacy organization, and they have a right to that privacy under the First Amendment. Because when the government starts asking for a list of everybody who's in the NAACP in Alabama, we know why they're asking for that list, and it's not a good reason.
00:44:31.404 - 00:45:40.542, Speaker C: And the Supreme Court actually articulated a constitutional right to anonymously donate to a civil advocacy organization back during the civil rights movement. And thank God they did. But our co plaintiff, we have a co plaintiff who's a John Doe, because they want to protect their privacy, who was organizing donations to support the defense of Ukraine using tornado Cash and Ethereum, for the very real reason that lots of people like Vitalik, who have a fair amount of crypto, wanted to help in this crisis and knew that if there were on chain transactions linking their public Personas to these donations to support Ukraine, they will very likely end up the target of russian intelligence, which is very active on these networks, trying to ferret people out and steal their money or do horrible things to their families, potentially even so, like, it's a. It's not an academic point here. This is a very real point about the value of privacy, especially in digital money, where most of the time we have zero privacy. Now we have this great new technology that actually starts to allow us to have some amount of privacy over our financial transactions online. And it's sad that we have to fight for what seemed to be sort of like fundamental american rights to just be able to protect our private business.
00:45:40.718 - 00:46:10.912, Speaker A: Yeah, it feels like, to your point, in the Wild west, if we're, like, in Deadwood, which was one of my favorite, unfortunately canceled HBO shows, mine too. You're paying with coins and cash. It's peer to peer, it's instant settlement, it's bilateral, and then the world becomes bigger and more digital, and you need more cash. Physical cash doesn't make as much sense, but we've lost this apparent, I mean, this is a core and the greenback, quote, unquote. Right. I mean, the dollar is famous as a thing, as a physical thing. Right.
00:46:10.912 - 00:46:27.372, Speaker A: But we've allowed a true degrading. You take the bank Secrecy act. What is the threshold to file a suspicious activity report with FinCEn is $10,000. Right, but that was like, in how much? Well, they lowered it. So that, that's because they just lowered it though. Right?
00:46:27.428 - 00:46:36.784, Speaker C: Currency transaction reports are 10,000, doctor. Okay, let's say the CTR 2000 or 5000, depending on whether you're Venmo or an MSP or bank.
00:46:37.484 - 00:46:47.636, Speaker A: They just updated some of those. But let's, you're right. Let's say the currency transaction report from the threshold was set at 10,000 in the eighties or something. Right.
00:46:47.740 - 00:46:48.836, Speaker C: And with inflation.
00:46:48.980 - 00:47:11.780, Speaker A: Yeah, that's what I'm saying. So it was actually in 20, like 23 equivalent dollars we're talking. It was much more, it was not intended, and I'm joking with inflation. And if they don't update that CTR, like, with inflation, in like ten or 50 years, you buy an iPhone and Apple's going to have to file a CTR. Right. Because like, they're not adjusting the threshold for inflation either. But to your point, they've also lowered the thresholds from anything.
00:47:11.780 - 00:47:18.884, Speaker A: Isn't it like $600 on PayPal now or something crazy last year? Yeah.
00:47:18.964 - 00:47:21.504, Speaker C: There might be a special rule about reporting for PayPal.
00:47:21.924 - 00:47:55.682, Speaker A: They really are dramatically expanding the financial surveillance apparatus. Right. Just Americans need to realize that we, even in a digital world, we may have had to centralize to get global payments or even cross country payments because we didn't have a technology that would allow us to go about our business using the cash model that we loved in the US. But now we do have that and we shouldn't allow them to redefine history, basically as to one where we all have to transact through a bank that they can call on the phone and.
00:47:55.698 - 00:48:43.188, Speaker C: To bring it back to the Warren Marshall bill. This is sort of extraordinary because this is not an example of just stricter rules for trusted third parties like banks. This is not an example of, well, let's just apply the same rules that banks have to deal with to crypto corporations, which was, as you said, sort of the misleading conclusion you might draw from watching the hearing with Jamie Dimon testifying. This is, oh, we're alarmed that there aren't intermediaries in this new technology. And so we're going to create them, we're going to say, you're a miner, you're a validator, all right? You say you're just relaying a bunch of data on the Internet, and you don't actually know any of these people. Now you need to know all of them. And, you know, to someone who doesn't understand the technology, that might seem reasonable.
00:48:43.188 - 00:49:39.924, Speaker C: It just makes no sense, though, because that's not the business of a validator. The business of the validator is just to say that the data that is being shared over this channel, over this protocol, is valid according to the rules of the protocol. I'm just checking digital signatures and bundling things up in blocks. And this is how we can have a beautiful, permissionless open ledger of financial transactions and all of the good that can come from this technology, especially with respect to, say, ensuring that freedom and liberty prevail in totalitarian regions of the world, where, of course, they don't want this technology to exist, but you can't stop it because there's this open, permissionless blockchain. So this is the first attempt to actually say, like, oh, we really don't actually like the idea that there's no big banks in the middle of this system. So we're going to create a law that forces there to become fully, like, trusted and sort of more traditional customer facing entities at every end of the transaction. It's forced re intermediation would be the way to think of it.
00:49:40.304 - 00:50:10.110, Speaker A: Peter, before we break, I want to ask about coin center, and I should tell our audience that you can read Peter's great work on coincenter.org. Dot. And there's not just his, but his whole teams. You just got a great new hire. Who joined you guys? Landon, who I know and just, I love the team at coincenter. They've been doing work in the space for a long time, and it's been great work. Peter, how can people get involved with coin center? Or what's exciting you for coin center next year?
00:50:10.262 - 00:50:36.146, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks, Alex. I am excited that Landon's here. It's the first time we've hired a new employee in a long time. He was a great staffer on the Hill, both for Senator Toomey, before that for Representative Emmer in the House, both incredible champions of crypto as a technology in Congress. And Landon is by far the best staffer I think I've ever met. So we're excited that coin center is expanding. We're excited to do more work.
00:50:36.146 - 00:50:41.490, Speaker C: We're excited for our lawsuits. We've got that lawsuit. We've got another lawsuit. 6050 I, which is about tax reporting.
00:50:41.562 - 00:50:44.908, Speaker A: Also about certain, that's like broker rules related stuff, right? Quote unquote.
00:50:44.956 - 00:51:17.660, Speaker C: We've got the broker rule comment, which we just submitted. We've got a lot going on. All of it's very important. And to me, it's very interesting that this is trending much more in the direction of what are the issues surrounding financial privacy? And we're starting to get off of the securities versus commodities type discussions, which had, you know, were important. But this is sort of the meat of the game. Like, if we're not allowed to have peer to peer financial transactions that preserve some modicum of privacy in this country, then we've lost everything. And so thank you for asking.
00:51:17.660 - 00:51:34.204, Speaker C: If you want to help our work, we're at coincenter.org dot. You can find all of our resources there. You can also donate. We're a nonprofit, and so we rely on our very generous community of supporters to continue operating, and we appreciate your donations.
