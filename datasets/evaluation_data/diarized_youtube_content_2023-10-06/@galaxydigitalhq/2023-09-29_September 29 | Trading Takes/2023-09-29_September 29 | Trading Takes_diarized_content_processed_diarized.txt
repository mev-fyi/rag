00:00:08.119 - 00:00:12.150, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, BiMnet, thanks for joining galaxy brains.
00:00:12.222 - 00:00:13.182, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:13.278 - 00:00:26.350, Speaker A: So we're still just ranging in bitcoin. I'm seeing dollar strength, bond weakness, equities struggling to what's the vibes in markets right now? What's driving the story?
00:00:26.462 - 00:01:42.394, Speaker B: You know, I think that there's a lot of fear around the implications of hire for longer. Folks in the equity world are like tech stocks if you think about them as dividend paying companies or a stream of cash flows over time, just functionally, as interest rates go up, you've got to discount the value of those future cash flows more aggressively. Two, what does it mean in the context of relative value between bonds and equities? And from a risk adjusted perspective, would you rather earn 4.5% on the ten year for ten years with no volatility guaranteed 4.5%, or own some of the single name equities that you can? And then the question is higher for longer. What are its implications for the broader economy? Does the consumer slow down? Does the economy slow down? And if you think about what the Fed is actively trying to do, they are trying to slow the economy down with monetary policy. So if this monetary policy does have its desired effect, it should be bad for stocks.
00:01:42.394 - 00:02:15.824, Speaker B: And we do know that there are certain things that are ramping up that should hurt the consumer. Like we're now basically in October, the student loan repayments are about to begin. In addition to that, gas prices are actually a tax on the consumer. At this point. Every time you're at the pump, you're paying an extra $20. You're going every week or every couple of weeks, that's going to start chipping away. We know that over time we'll start to see the consumer balance sheet dwindle.
00:02:15.824 - 00:02:50.726, Speaker B: However, the counter to all of this is that, you know, the Fed still only cares about the level of inflation. And so when gas prices go up and like other things related, like that drives inflation higher, and that might drive the Fed to more, more hawkish policy, which isn't necessarily what they do. But long story short, there's just so many variables at play. Like the United autoworkers are at strike, right? And so labor's got a lot of power right now, and wages might be going up because we're in a structurally.
00:02:50.750 - 00:02:53.974, Speaker A: Tight labor market which can contribute positively to inflation, right?
00:02:54.014 - 00:03:06.750, Speaker B: Yeah. So we're in this weird dynamic of, we know things are slowing, nobody wants to buy a house right now, mortgages rates are super absurd. That I think is on the cusp of some.
00:03:06.902 - 00:03:08.534, Speaker A: Something to give. Yeah.
00:03:08.694 - 00:03:39.794, Speaker B: However, the data is still super strong. Right. But consumers is gonna slow over time. Their savings are dwindling. Credit card delinquencies are picking up, auto delinquencies are picking up, et cetera. And so we've got to find the balance between knowing that that stuff is happening and the fact that the inflation metrics that the Fed's focused on haven't necessarily bottomed aren't anywhere close to where they need to be for the Fed to kind of ease. So it's really tough.
00:03:39.794 - 00:04:14.390, Speaker B: And then you throw in just the fiscal side of things and it's just so insane. Just the mountain of treasury supply every single day. Not every day, it's their settlement days, but you get treasury supply every Tuesday and Thursday on bills every mid month they're funding and treasuries and month end refunding. Then you've got the tips. There's so many. I was literally looking through a net maturity cash addition table the other day, but it's literally every settlement day. It's like, oh, here's another 15 billion in marginal, 10 billion there, 4 billion.
00:04:14.390 - 00:04:19.634, Speaker B: Like it just adds up over time. And the Fed isn't actively expanding its balance sheet right now.
00:04:21.294 - 00:04:56.632, Speaker A: But anyway, yeah, it is very complicated. I mean, your point that the economy easing should be supportive for inflation and thus supportive for rates to halt or eventually come down. But at the same time, other forces in the economy keeping inflation steady. Right. Like the tightening in the labor market, the housing market, the new, the consumer, the spending, that's the United Auto Workers is an example of like labor power on the labor side negotiating power. Right. There's that.
00:04:56.632 - 00:05:04.360, Speaker A: What's that metric of the average amount of money that like people would need to take a new job now. Right. Like everyone's demanding more hiring. Yeah.
00:05:04.392 - 00:05:12.512, Speaker B: The average, like shift, like job shifters, they actually pick up, I think around five to 6% increase in wages, which.
00:05:12.528 - 00:05:28.364, Speaker A: Is high on the historical super high. So it's tricky. And then when we think about, we have the government shutdown too. You're talking about the fiscal side. In addition to lots of spending there, we also have impasses which make effective governance more difficult.
00:05:29.064 - 00:05:36.894, Speaker B: It's so crazy. And then you throw in, I think, a banking system that just is not healthy.
00:05:36.984 - 00:05:37.962, Speaker A: It's stretched still.
00:05:38.018 - 00:05:49.906, Speaker B: It's stretched because what's happening is when we had the Silicon Valley signature banking crisis, we had it because all of these banks had all of these treasury securities and other long duration that just.
00:05:49.930 - 00:05:51.042, Speaker A: Went down in value.
00:05:51.138 - 00:05:52.818, Speaker B: They've gone further down in value and.
00:05:52.826 - 00:05:55.866, Speaker A: They couldn't hold them to maturity to get that liquidity back.
00:05:56.010 - 00:06:10.374, Speaker B: Well, they were going to get rushed by a run on them. So they put it on this bTfb facility. But at this point, everybody is now realizing that that BTFP facility is permanent. The value of those securities is only.
00:06:10.714 - 00:06:13.722, Speaker A: It just has to hold them through maturity. Basically. There's no other option.
00:06:13.778 - 00:06:14.786, Speaker B: Well, that's.
00:06:14.810 - 00:06:15.866, Speaker A: How long is that?
00:06:16.050 - 00:06:21.894, Speaker B: Or interest rates need to come down and those assets increase cover and value. But that's not happening.
00:06:22.474 - 00:06:23.538, Speaker A: Not in hire for longer.
00:06:23.586 - 00:07:00.524, Speaker B: The Fed basically just created a new long term lending facility that's a permanent feature of the banking system because of just how twisted they got things by forcing banks to own all these treasuries, then hosing them, because they created an inflation problem by not reacting aggressively enough. And so you're just in this weird situation and now there's a huge, intense competition for deposits and that's crushing these bank margins, and they're going to have to post more capital to operate. What does that mean? They're going to have to issue more debt.
00:07:01.504 - 00:07:02.824, Speaker A: It's a vicious cycle.
00:07:02.944 - 00:07:19.560, Speaker B: It's so bad. And the issue, I hate to blame regulators and the Fed because it's tough to put yourself in their shoes and to understand all the various dynamics happening. But for the BTFP, you could have.
00:07:19.592 - 00:07:22.624, Speaker A: Known, day one, the second you start hiking, you mean?
00:07:22.744 - 00:07:41.014, Speaker B: Well, no, well, the second you start hiking, yeah. I mean, they could have known about the banking crisis sooner rather than later, but not even that. But it's just the way that this facility was constructed. Like, you know, it wasn't the most honest at the beginning. Like, nobody told you that it was going to be a permanent feature of the banking system when they initially launched.
00:07:41.634 - 00:07:42.978, Speaker A: Emergency one year.
00:07:43.026 - 00:07:44.954, Speaker B: Emergency one year, we'll be fine.
00:07:45.074 - 00:07:46.762, Speaker A: No, yeah, tricky.
00:07:46.858 - 00:08:00.494, Speaker B: And so, and the other thing is just like, like, let's just be honest, the government can't afford four and a half, five, 6% interest rates at these levels of deficit.
00:08:00.534 - 00:08:05.382, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, yeah. There's all that stuff about the cost of servicing the national debt, the debt.
00:08:05.438 - 00:08:22.874, Speaker B: And it just keeps ballooning. And it's all like, this market is fundamentally built on the premise that the money printer will just go brrrr. When necessary. And it's just such an absurd concept. And it's like the only reason you can do it because everywhere else is even shittier.
00:08:22.994 - 00:08:24.094, Speaker A: Yeah, right.
00:08:24.394 - 00:08:32.634, Speaker B: That's realistically, that's what the whole essence of like the US financial system and the dollar monopoly, like right now come.
00:08:32.674 - 00:08:35.186, Speaker A: Down to is the lesser of all the evils.
00:08:35.210 - 00:08:38.234, Speaker B: It's a lesser of all the evils. Cause everywhere else is housing affordability.
00:08:38.274 - 00:08:39.450, Speaker A: They have the same problem.
00:08:39.602 - 00:08:42.946, Speaker B: Same problem and worse and worse because they don't have the currency benefit.
00:08:43.010 - 00:08:55.482, Speaker A: Right. Right. It's tricky. And I always love talking with this. Let me shift gears just a little bit because I didn't say that. Our guest this week, our guest this week is Lucas Nutsy from Coinmetrics. We're talking a lot about crypto data.
00:08:55.482 - 00:09:01.906, Speaker A: As a trader of crypto markets, like how do you think about data? What types of data in crypto are very important to you?
00:09:01.930 - 00:09:28.338, Speaker B: Just types of data, funding data, open interest volumes, all the same metrics, all market data, stuff that are relevant to any marketplace. I think all markets are essentially identical. There's buyers and sellers. There's types of buyers and sellers. You have to figure out who's motivated to do what. There's options, positioning. Are people short, gamma, long, gamma, vault, short volume, long volume.
00:09:28.338 - 00:09:44.810, Speaker B: Then there's the funding side. Are people paying a lot to be long or people paying a lot to be short? And then they're catalysts. But basically all markets in my head at least function on the same set of things. So I look at basically an identical kind of set of metrics.
00:09:44.962 - 00:09:59.682, Speaker A: What about like on chain data? You have fundamental data, obviously, like at the macro level, you talk about a lot of that all the time. You obviously can look at individual companies, they have reporting schedules. But is it impactful to you that it's more real time transparent?
00:09:59.818 - 00:10:13.890, Speaker B: It's so much more impactful. I mean, you can literally see movements on chain from wallets that you track from great traders or from market makers or from venture people that you know are dumping. And so you can see their tokens going to exchange and being sold.
00:10:13.962 - 00:10:14.266, Speaker A: Right.
00:10:14.330 - 00:10:18.522, Speaker B: And so it's an un, like transparency.
00:10:18.578 - 00:10:21.626, Speaker A: Tracing flows for you as a non chain thing? Yeah, yeah.
00:10:21.810 - 00:10:36.246, Speaker B: I mean, it's great. Again, the question is, in the biggest asset in the space, bitcoin, it's not really that relevant to track. I mean, the government wallets are really important, et cetera.
00:10:36.310 - 00:10:38.494, Speaker A: Miners maybe, but miners, but we know that.
00:10:38.574 - 00:10:51.224, Speaker B: Yeah. In things that are super macro not necessarily important. If I told you I could track people's trading of euro dollar, such a huge massive macro asset, which accounts doing what? I don't even know if there's a signal there.
00:10:51.294 - 00:10:57.044, Speaker A: Right. Just cause it's such a big macro asset. So it's trading. Bitcoin's trading more as a macro asset.
00:10:57.084 - 00:10:57.940, Speaker B: More as a macro asset.
00:10:57.972 - 00:11:01.196, Speaker A: But for a more crypto native flows, the on chain stuff is useful.
00:11:01.300 - 00:11:02.612, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say yes.
00:11:02.708 - 00:11:03.164, Speaker A: Very interesting.
00:11:03.204 - 00:11:12.908, Speaker B: Or a $300 million defi token that's held the top ten holders own, like, 30% of the following.
00:11:12.996 - 00:11:14.356, Speaker A: That flow is really important.
00:11:14.460 - 00:11:40.232, Speaker B: That's more important in those instances. But, yeah, I mean, I think crypto analytics and on chain analytics, there's a ton of service providers out there that do a great job, and folks have tried to build signals off of it and stuff. And I think, like with anything else, it's really tough. And only a handful of people really figure out the secret sauce.
00:11:40.328 - 00:11:40.552, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:40.568 - 00:11:41.128, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:41.296 - 00:11:41.912, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:11:41.968 - 00:11:42.488, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:42.616 - 00:11:46.574, Speaker A: Bim netabeebeebeebe from galaxy trading, my friend, as always, thanks for coming. Watching at galaxy brains. Pleasure.
