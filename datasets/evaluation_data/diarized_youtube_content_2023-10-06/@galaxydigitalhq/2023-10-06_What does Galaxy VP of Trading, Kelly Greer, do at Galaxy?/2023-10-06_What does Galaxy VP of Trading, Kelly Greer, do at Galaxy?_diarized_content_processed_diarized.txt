00:00:00.200 - 00:00:10.686, Speaker A: Kelly is a vice president in sales and trading. Right. So just real quickly, like, tell the audience who may not know what that is, just what that is. Like. What do you do at Galaxy?
00:00:10.750 - 00:00:56.834, Speaker B: Absolutely. I'm on our us sales team. So we have a global sales and trading team with teammates in Hong Kong and London. In the US, we work with our us based counterparties for the trading business but also connecting them to all parts of Galaxy. So my team and I talk directly with our counterparties, help them get what they need out of the trading desk and the firm. That includes trading options, loans for their portfolio, lending their crypto borrowing versat, lending crypto directly for yield and trading spot, all on an OTC basis with our desk. So we're helping them solve problems, whether it's hedging a position that's unlocking, hedging their books, solving for yield generation, or maybe they have a portfolio company that wants advice from advisory and we can make the right connections.
