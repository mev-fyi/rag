00:00:08.320 - 00:00:12.382, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet, a BB from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnett, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:12.438 - 00:00:13.594, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:13.934 - 00:00:36.996, Speaker A: So kind of a quiet time. I mean, you had the bitcoin halving, which had a big impact on the network. The network obviously becoming the monetary asset, becoming scarcer, but fees spiking because of runes and ordinals and stuff. But we're going to talk with Brian Wright from galaxy mining in a minute about that. Otherwise though, like BTC, like kind of sideways. What equities have been down, but kind of like sideways at the moment. Like it's sort of.
00:00:37.100 - 00:00:38.804, Speaker B: Yeah, they've been down for a couple weeks.
00:00:38.844 - 00:00:40.588, Speaker A: We waiting for a new catalyst or.
00:00:40.636 - 00:00:40.988, Speaker C: Yes.
00:00:41.076 - 00:00:42.172, Speaker A: What are we waiting on?
00:00:42.308 - 00:01:32.614, Speaker B: Well, earnings. So, you know, I think this week about 160 companies in the S and P 500 report earnings, including some big tech names. And so that will broadly give the market a sense of how healthy the economy is in terms of are people spending money, how healthy corporate balance sheets are. I know, broadly impact risk sentiment. If people start feeling good about stocks again, that should be good for crypto, that should be bad for the dollar, et cetera, et cetera. So it's really important to pay attention to these earnings. I pay close attention to the consumer discretionary companies that have a stronger pulse on where the US consumer is.
00:01:32.614 - 00:02:00.928, Speaker B: Also credit card companies as well. One interesting tidbit, one of the lower quality credit card companies recently reported earnings and they had their provisions for loan losses start to tick higher. And it was back to levels that you saw in 2008 and around the financial crisis, we're talking about provisioning of slightly over 5%.
00:02:01.016 - 00:02:04.280, Speaker A: So setting aside capital to cover those losses, is that what that means?
00:02:04.352 - 00:02:06.744, Speaker B: And the delinquency rates are.
00:02:06.904 - 00:02:15.152, Speaker A: So they set aside more as they expect more losses, basically. So you're saying what, the consumer is now stretched and they don't have extra cash anymore, they're in debt.
00:02:15.248 - 00:02:15.924, Speaker C: Yes.
00:02:16.344 - 00:03:30.878, Speaker B: And the debt is at a higher cost than ever because interest rates have gone up, savings have come down a lot because far less transfer payments from the government. It's also wages have not kept up with inflation and so it's a constant burn on people. And more and more people are getting stuck in the debt trap and just spending more money than they're bringing in. And so you are starting to see cracks in that economy in the everyday person, I would say. And then the other thing to pay attention to, I think, from this earnings season is the ability of corporates to respond to increasing costs by raising prices so over the past couple of years, you've seen a lot of consumer staple companies, your big conglomerate types, be able to pass through the costs, the increased cost of commodities, labor and other services to the consumer. But that was because the consumer was in a much healthier spot and so they could absorb that. But now if you continue to see some of those costs go up and there's less of an ability of those corporates to pass through that pricing to consumers, where's it going to have to come from? It's going to have to come from their bottom line.
00:03:30.878 - 00:03:41.294, Speaker B: So you're going to see margin compression as the consumer kind of tightens up. And then obviously consumption is like 70% of the US economy. So.
00:03:43.274 - 00:03:45.882, Speaker A: Are people consuming a lot and.
00:03:45.978 - 00:03:50.218, Speaker B: What are they telling you about what they're likely to consume going forward? These corporates are so good and so.
00:03:50.266 - 00:03:55.482, Speaker D: Precise at forecasting every foot, bit of foot traffic in their stores, every bit.
00:03:55.498 - 00:04:04.282, Speaker B: Of sales, et cetera. And so when they speak, you gotta listen. And generally earnings season's a great time to kind of step back and be like, what's going on? Yeah.
00:04:04.298 - 00:04:34.536, Speaker A: So a number of interesting things that I'm hearing from you here and reasons why earnings matter. One obviously that you mentioned at the top was it can help people become bullish on stocks. That can sort of change the whole attitude in the risk sentiment in the country on the investor side, which can impact things like crypto and the dollar and whatnot. But also that you're reading through some of these earnings, looking through them to help understand, engage the consumer's health overall, which obviously has an impact later on inflation and whatnot.
00:04:34.560 - 00:04:34.672, Speaker B: Right.
00:04:34.688 - 00:04:37.656, Speaker A: If they're all spending a ton, then inflation could be stickier.
00:04:37.840 - 00:04:38.224, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:38.264 - 00:04:40.160, Speaker B: And it's also like, are they laying off people?
00:04:40.232 - 00:04:40.488, Speaker C: Right.
00:04:40.536 - 00:04:44.232, Speaker A: You know, taxi employment situation, which is one of the Fed's mandates.
00:04:44.288 - 00:04:44.456, Speaker C: Right.
00:04:44.480 - 00:04:52.816, Speaker A: So very interesting. And then I wanted to ask you too, when we think about like how does this. I guess so. So no fed speak. No, we're talking about on the map.
00:04:52.840 - 00:04:54.176, Speaker B: We'Re in blackout right now. Yeah.
00:04:54.200 - 00:04:57.936, Speaker A: So what does that mean as they lead into the FOMC or something? They can't talk, correct.
00:04:58.000 - 00:05:08.680, Speaker B: Yeah. And right now, like, even if they were talking like it's just a bunch of noise, all of them come out and like, there's a gazillion speakers every day.
00:05:08.752 - 00:05:09.096, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:05:09.160 - 00:05:10.936, Speaker D: And it's like, I get the message.
00:05:11.000 - 00:05:19.360, Speaker B: Like, data's been hot, you're less likely to cut. You're telling me it in 15 different ways. To be clear, you've been pointing this.
00:05:19.392 - 00:05:45.686, Speaker A: Out for several months that they would probably get here and that, well, actually you weren't sure whether they would get here. You were saying they absolutely should get here and not cut because the economy was fine. Yeah, but now it seems consensus. I mean, obviously the futures markets on rates are basically pricing in barely any cuts. Like one cut, maybe one or two cuts down from what? Like seven cuts in January. They thought we were going to have.
00:05:45.710 - 00:06:35.698, Speaker B: Seven cuts, which was insane. But I mean, if you really think about it, like, I think your one year inflation rates are like the average, like high threes. Your six month stuff is now looking at like probably like low, probably still high threes, mid high three. But now you're like three month run rate of the past couple of inflation prints is like mid four s. And so it doesn't seem like you're anywhere close to your inflation target. And the one thing I would highlight as well is that market expectations for inflation are pretty important. And I think that's what you have to monitor the most, because if inflation just keeps continuing, these expectations are just going to start to break out.
00:06:35.698 - 00:06:41.778, Speaker B: And then people are going to be like, they're going to doubt the Fed's ability to actually achieve their mandate and that'll make sense.
00:06:41.786 - 00:06:42.474, Speaker C: And they're going to lose.
00:06:42.554 - 00:06:44.586, Speaker B: Yeah, and they're going to lose some credibility and stuff.
00:06:44.690 - 00:06:45.946, Speaker D: But I just don't know how much.
00:06:45.970 - 00:06:47.442, Speaker B: More inflation people can really put up.
00:06:47.458 - 00:06:49.946, Speaker D: With because as we've talked before on.
00:06:50.010 - 00:06:59.376, Speaker B: The past episodes, you are getting taxed because of inflation. People are going to end up spending less on, you know, tons of activities.
00:06:59.440 - 00:07:01.688, Speaker D: If their essentials are costing them way more.
00:07:01.736 - 00:07:21.280, Speaker A: And they are. I mean, I even, you know, we all see this. I have a family. We go and buy groceries. You know, some single people in New York may not go to the supermarket very often, but we do. And it's been getting more expensive for years at this point. Um, also looking at things like, um, electricity cost is going up, like gasoline, obviously, but you know, that gas, we don't drive too, too much.
00:07:21.280 - 00:07:26.160, Speaker A: I mean, it's, it's been kind of expensive. I don't know, maybe I'm old. I remember when it was like a dollar a gallon.
00:07:26.232 - 00:07:26.536, Speaker B: No, no.
00:07:26.560 - 00:07:57.034, Speaker A: So pretty much anything over like two seems kind of expensive to me, but it's been up. But really the one that I looked at recently was the electricity bill. I was like, maybe I, unfortunately, I don't live in Texas where I can. You have a much freer market on electricity and they have a bunch of renewables. I live in one of these many parts of the country where the grid is controlled by one operator with totally opaque pricing, which is how most of the country electricity. But we're talking a fair amount and we haven't even come into those summer months with like where it gets really hot. So yeah, they're hurting.
00:07:57.034 - 00:08:11.922, Speaker A: And also, you see these videos on TikTok. I'm not on there, but they get posted on x, right? And people are hurting. They're talking about it a lot, a lot of videos of people being like, how? And by the way, some of these people coming around to the. Wait a second, why can't we just print more money? Kind of question.
00:08:12.018 - 00:08:12.578, Speaker B: Oh yeah.
00:08:12.626 - 00:08:33.068, Speaker A: Which is getting pretty interesting. Tick tock. Set to be banned in the United States. The president just signed a bill that forces the sale of it or bans it. Just as another aside here about the economy, it does seem like the consumer, the average everyday consumer, you can call him the voter, is in a lot worse shape than people.
00:08:33.116 - 00:08:34.652, Speaker B: It's not getting any better, right?
00:08:34.668 - 00:08:35.676, Speaker A: It's actually getting worse.
00:08:35.740 - 00:08:38.548, Speaker D: And I don't think it will get that much better.
00:08:38.636 - 00:08:43.284, Speaker B: There are no magical solutions to this stuff. Like the government's not gonna stop printing money.
00:08:43.404 - 00:08:44.436, Speaker A: In fact, they're printing more.
00:08:44.500 - 00:08:45.532, Speaker B: They're printing more money.
00:08:45.588 - 00:08:47.244, Speaker A: So, you know, like record issuance, right?
00:08:47.284 - 00:08:48.964, Speaker D: And like, and it's just like it.
00:08:49.004 - 00:09:31.410, Speaker B: Comes down to like the wealth inequality stuff, right? Like rich people can keep their assets, savings and assets that are more resilient to inflation. They even appreciate, even appreciate even further. So the people that own homes right now, as housing keeps going up, they're protected against inflation because they rent to people. And as rents go up, they'll raise their rents and they'll keep up with the inflation. And that's what people spend a lot of their money on, is housing and stuff. And then if you don't own these assets, and if you want to hedge against inflation, gold, silver, those things are already trading super well at the dead highs. And if you really want to keep up, you gotta have big positions in them.
00:09:31.442 - 00:09:33.934, Speaker D: And so it's just so bad.
00:09:34.314 - 00:09:35.574, Speaker B: And I think.
00:09:37.314 - 00:09:38.774, Speaker D: Which is crazy, but.
00:09:39.394 - 00:09:48.510, Speaker B: Part of the reason why social media exists is to keep people in a malaise so that they don't focus on this stuff. So the government probably does need TikTok. They just don't know it.
00:09:48.582 - 00:10:07.254, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, but I think right now it's working against them or they think. I mean, I don't know exactly. Why, don't get me wrong, I have no idea. But it does seem like it is a powerful tool for Bytedance to impact, like, a chinese company to impact America. But again, people, I've seen videos, they are furious about this. They view it as a free speech issue. This is, I thought, a free market.
00:10:07.254 - 00:10:19.938, Speaker A: It's a very strange. That's very strange. But a lot of content on there about the average, like, from people all across the country saying they can't afford basic staples, that they're working two, three jobs. And, you know, I also think about that employment number.
00:10:19.986 - 00:10:20.194, Speaker B: Right?
00:10:20.234 - 00:10:23.730, Speaker A: Like, a lot of that employment is part time employment, part time employment.
00:10:23.762 - 00:10:28.298, Speaker D: But it's also, the numbers are wrong. They're statistically and they do.
00:10:28.346 - 00:10:32.354, Speaker A: Don't they update the numbers, like, every way off all the time?
00:10:32.474 - 00:10:39.734, Speaker B: Well, yes, but I'll give you an example. This is the one that's really been trending recently. Yeah. We're a nation of, what, 330 million people?
00:10:39.914 - 00:10:40.414, Speaker C: I don't know.
00:10:40.454 - 00:10:51.862, Speaker B: Maybe the labor force is like 130 million people of that, or maybe a bit higher than that. But initial jobless claims every week are $210,000 or 210,000 people.
00:10:51.958 - 00:10:52.446, Speaker A: Same number.
00:10:52.510 - 00:10:53.078, Speaker B: Same number.
00:10:53.166 - 00:10:58.278, Speaker D: It doesn't make sense for a population in a sample size that big that the variability is that low.
00:10:58.366 - 00:10:58.782, Speaker C: Right.
00:10:58.878 - 00:11:18.326, Speaker D: Like, it's insane to me. And it was crazy when the job market was really hot. Every single month got job revisions higher. There's a huge spread between the household survey and the employer survey. There's so many weird statistical anomalies in this data. It's hard not to not say.
00:11:18.430 - 00:11:20.214, Speaker B: You need to be a conspiracy theorist.
00:11:20.374 - 00:11:21.686, Speaker A: But you have to wonder, you have.
00:11:21.710 - 00:11:27.822, Speaker B: To question the stuff. If I'm a fed official, I'm going.
00:11:27.878 - 00:11:29.702, Speaker D: Down to the people taking surveys.
00:11:29.758 - 00:11:50.662, Speaker A: You're like the guy in the big short, Steve Carell's character. He's flying down and looking at it because the data didn't make sense. TikTok videos is like, look, you've got data on one hand, but then you just, like, hear from the people that it is bad. I mean, so I don't know. It's a very tough thing. Anyway, it seems like we're a little bit of holding pattern. We got to let earnings play out.
00:11:50.718 - 00:11:51.118, Speaker C: We've got.
00:11:51.166 - 00:12:09.490, Speaker A: I saw, I posted this on Monday or on Tuesday that it was the lowest day, and, like, or that was the 7th lowest day ever in ETF. Bitcoin ETF volumes actually quite close to the lowest. But there were some in February. There were so just people, like crab market people trying to just wait and see. Basically, honestly, we don't have fed for what, several more weeks.
00:12:09.642 - 00:12:17.794, Speaker B: So, yeah, here's the thing. I love bitcoin. Think it's great long term holding, but has it lost a little bit of its short term momentum?
00:12:17.954 - 00:12:18.466, Speaker C: Probably.
00:12:18.530 - 00:12:31.968, Speaker B: And you can see that reflected in the volumes. In addition, like, you had the havening, you had the ETF. A lot of the big narratives for crypto have played out, to be frank.
00:12:32.016 - 00:12:32.568, Speaker A: That's right.
00:12:32.656 - 00:12:49.912, Speaker B: And so a lot of times, markets need catalysts and markets need. And especially in such a speculative asset like bitcoin, people like to see good momentum to continue to participate. And so to the hardcore bitcoiners, this is just noise, or maybe just like path to.
00:12:49.968 - 00:12:53.168, Speaker A: I have plenty of people who are like, this is great. We can stack here, we can stack.
00:12:53.336 - 00:12:57.608, Speaker B: Everybody that's in the bitcoin game is like, I need more time to get more bitcoin.
00:12:57.656 - 00:12:58.032, Speaker C: Right?
00:12:58.128 - 00:12:59.136, Speaker B: Like, I gotta have more.
00:12:59.200 - 00:13:31.788, Speaker A: But it's obvious, I mean, if you look at the ETF flows as one version, like, you can just see like huge run in February and March, and then April's been kind of like basically almost more anemic every day. I think we might have decided that we bottomed, I think, to last week. We had, I think, basically the lowest total inflow ever. The lowest for the biggest ETF's inflow, right. So I think we maybe have bottomed, but we're remember too, on that flow story with the ETF. We haven't had these wealth management platforms and stuff turn on at all yet. Our entire analysis was 14 billion in year one.
00:13:31.788 - 00:13:46.204, Speaker A: Takes us to 75k in price. All from a percentage, a small percentage of these wealth management platforms. Well, we had 13 and it brought us to 738. And none of those platforms had turned on yet. So presumably there is more demand side to unlock.
00:13:46.244 - 00:13:46.860, Speaker B: No, absolutely.
00:13:46.892 - 00:13:48.612, Speaker A: But I agree. It feels, you know, we're sort of.
00:13:48.628 - 00:13:52.868, Speaker B: Just trying, like that's really what you need for the long term thesis, is just more success.
00:13:52.876 - 00:13:55.004, Speaker A: I want multiples every month.
00:13:55.124 - 00:13:55.596, Speaker B: No.
00:13:55.700 - 00:13:58.348, Speaker A: Remember when it was 16? Five. I was sitting right in the seat.
00:13:58.436 - 00:13:59.540, Speaker B: Yeah. A year and a half ago.
00:13:59.572 - 00:14:00.744, Speaker A: A year and a quarter ago.
00:14:01.364 - 00:14:02.516, Speaker D: Brutal times.
00:14:02.700 - 00:14:03.188, Speaker B: Jesus.
00:14:03.236 - 00:14:08.836, Speaker A: Well, we'll keep watching and we will let you know. There it is. My friend Bim Netabeebe from Galaxy trading.
00:14:08.900 - 00:14:09.484, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
