00:00:00.200 - 00:00:07.334, Speaker A: It's been ten years and we finally have bitcoin spot. Bitcoin ETF's approved and trading in the US today. On Thursday.
00:00:07.494 - 00:00:14.534, Speaker B: It feels like you've run more than a marathon. You've probably done like an Ironman triathlon marathon all put together, and now you're at the starting line.
00:00:14.574 - 00:00:16.366, Speaker A: Yeah. Now we only just get to start.
00:00:16.430 - 00:00:17.054, Speaker B: Now you get to start.
00:00:17.094 - 00:00:18.118, Speaker A: Now the battle begins.
00:00:18.166 - 00:00:23.310, Speaker B: The privilege to start and compete with all the biggest asset managers in the world has now been afforded to us.
00:00:23.342 - 00:00:30.434, Speaker A: It's really amazing. And, I mean, the Bloomberg guys have been calling it the coin Tucky derby with all the horses at the starting gate. Finally at the starting gate. Right. It's.
00:00:30.474 - 00:00:31.370, Speaker B: It's apt.
00:00:31.522 - 00:00:39.162, Speaker A: It's going to be really exciting now, obviously, Steve, you run Galaxy's asset management business. I think. What was the latest number that we published publicly on Aum?
00:00:39.218 - 00:00:43.202, Speaker B: Yes, we're five. Five. 3 billion AUM business as of November 30.
00:00:43.258 - 00:00:49.714, Speaker A: And a lot of that is the huge deal that you guys landed managing the FTX estate, so that was a big win.
