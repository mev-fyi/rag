00:00:02.560 - 00:00:28.678, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firm wide research at Galaxy. Thank you for listening. We have a great show. No wrap intro this week, but we'll be back soon with some more. We do have a great guest, Will Nelly from Galaxy Ventures is joining us to talk about the current venture capital market. Is it back? I mean, my report at the end of last year showed that Q Four was still putting in new lows in terms of capital invested, but the energy feels different.
00:00:28.678 - 00:00:57.684, Speaker A: We're going to get Will's thoughts on this. Will is also a noted expert on the concept of block space and blockchains, and we'll have a fascinating conversation about how he thinks about block space as a consumer. Good. That's quite interesting. We'll also check with our good friend Bibnet Abibi from Galaxy trading, as always, to discuss markets and macro. Before we get to that, I need to remind you to please refer to link to disclaimer in the podcast notes.

00:00:57.684 - 00:01:05.454, Speaker A: Let's hop right into the show. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, BIMnet, welcome to Galaxy brains.
00:01:05.574 - 00:01:06.754, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:01:07.374 - 00:01:18.830, Speaker A: I'm not there. We took a week off last week. You were off. I was traveling. I still am. But there was big news last week. It was a Fed day last Wednesday and rates were unchanged.
00:01:18.830 - 00:01:28.042, Speaker A: But even from far away I heard rumors that there was more dovish than expected, maybe language or something. Why don't you tell us what happened last week?
00:01:28.138 - 00:02:11.714, Speaker B: Yes. So the big focus going into the Fed last week was the dot plot. And a lot of market participants had expected the 2024 dots to go down from three cuts to two cuts. And so when that didn't happen, the market perceived that as as dovish. Even though the Fed did upgrade their growth forecasts and the dots further out, the curve moved higher. However, the market most closely latched onto the 2024 dots because that's immediate monetary policy. In addition, I would say Powell was fairly dovish.
00:02:11.714 - 00:03:16.534, Speaker B: During his press conference, he dismissed things like, you know, the equity market and kind of some of the froth in financial markets. He reiterated the fact that he thought financial conditions were tight right now, even though I don't think that they're really that tight. And just he stuck to the script and he thinks that it's feasible that they still cut three times this year. I personally, in the face of the strong data we've had, especially recently around CPI PPI, I would not have taken such a dovish stance. And I think a lot of market participants didn't expect him to be as dovish as he was. Because realistically you can make an argument that you don't need to cut at all this year. In fact, the day after FOMC, or on Friday after FOMC bostic, another Fed member, came out and said he only saw one cut happening this year.
00:03:16.534 - 00:03:55.080, Speaker B: As the economy develops, just think about this. They lowered their unemployment forecast and they increased their growth forecast, and yet they're still cutting the same amount. Even the data is hot and they've literally had to adjust their forecast because of how hot the data has been. And yet we're still talking about the same number of cuts. And I think it's really foolhardy. What you're seeing in goods inflation is some signs of revival. Oil prices have started to climb.
00:03:55.080 - 00:04:40.118, Speaker B: I don't know if you've seen charts of cocoa prices recently, things of that nature. A lot of it's structural because you can't really go much lower in terms of prices and then just high level. I think there are upside risks to goods inflation and services. Inflation is already pretty hot. And so I genuinely think that the Fed shouldn't be as dovish as they are. And then from the level of what have we really done over the past couple of years? Like prices are still up a lot. In aggregate, the price level of goods has been way higher than the 2% inflation rate that folks were being told.
00:04:40.118 - 00:05:22.874, Speaker B: Like, if a cup of coffee is now dollar four at your local Starbucks, that was $2.02 years ago. Just because it's only going from $4 to 415 in this year, people are like. And fed members are like, oh, we've dramatically cooled inflation. Yeah, but at the end of the day, what have you really done? And that's facilitated one of the largest bouts of inflation that we've had in modern history. And has that really been addressed? Will it ever be addressed? Are incomes keeping up fast enough for the price level of goods? I don't know. And it's also a tale of two halves.
00:05:22.874 - 00:05:38.666, Speaker B: Anybody with assets and financial markets is feeling pretty good. Stock markets are all time highs, home prices are keeping up. But yet if you're living paycheck to paycheck, it's a much different world.
00:05:38.810 - 00:06:15.694, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. It does seem like cutting doesn't make a ton of sense when assets are at all time highs and unemployment's doing okay, right? I mean, I know you're on the sort of. In the last few months, you've turned sort of the hawkish side of this, which has been really interesting. Let's talk quickly about a little bit more global macro. I saw a headline that said the japanese yen dropped to the lowest value against the dollar in, I don't know, I think it said since 1990. So that would be like 35 years. What does that mean? What's going on in Japan? Did they abandon yield curve control? What is, what's happening over there? This is what, the third largest, third or fourth largest economy in the world?
00:06:15.994 - 00:07:12.454, Speaker B: It depends if you group the EU together, but yeah, it's the third largest economy in the world. And I guess fourth if you loop in the EU and China. So it's a pretty big deal. And it's even more important from the standpoint that they were the only central bank, at least in g ten markets that hadn't lifted off from zero or negative, actually. And so what the BoJ did was basically end this huge experiment in monetary easing recently, and they are abandoning ETF purchases, they're raising the overnight rate back to zero, and they have already widened out the band of where back end JGB rates can trade. Don't get it twisted. They still have pretty easy monetary policy, but they announced a pretty big shift, and that was a natural reaction to some of the things they were seeing.
00:07:12.454 - 00:07:58.996, Speaker B: Literally, like this month, you've had huge concessions by large companies to their labor unions in Japan. And so wage inflation has been a pretty hot figure in Japan. And then generally their economy's been doing well, super, super low unemployment. And so they're starting to see prices pick up. They reacted and got off of zero. And that was a big deal because generally when you get off of zero, you're sending a pretty strong signal to the market that you're going to react to positive price pressure because that's what central banks are supposed to do. It was a pretty big deal for them to shift, but it was well communicated.
00:07:58.996 - 00:08:24.584, Speaker B: And the currency only continued to depreciate after basically, given the huge interest rate differentials that still exist between VOJ, the ECB and the Fed. And basically every central bank on the planet, like the yen, is going to continue to depreciate unless the VoJ gets more aggressive in monetary policy or that there's actually some form of currency intervention.
00:08:24.924 - 00:08:51.284, Speaker A: All right, real quick, before we. I know. Market's about to open. We're recording this on Wednesday, March 27, before us market open. I just want to ask you, Ben, when I left two weeks ago for vacation, we had just started a drop below seventy k to this sort of correction that we've had. I think saw about 17,000, sorry, 17% bitcoin price decline. We're back at like 71 and a half now.
00:08:51.284 - 00:09:03.764, Speaker A: Maybe by the time I get back to New York next week, will it, will we be like it never happened? What's that last two weeks been like in crypto markets for you, in your mind? And does any of this matter? Is this just some short term noise?
00:09:04.904 - 00:09:45.620, Speaker B: I genuinely think that it's just short term noise. The flows we've seen are still pretty substantial. Bitcoin is an asset class that's here to stay. Risk markets and risk assets are trading super well, especially things like fiat to basement hedges like gold. I think that's a good risk environment. The fundamentals, are there more platforms bringing on the bitcoin ETF's, more reputable institutions playing and forcing other players to come in? I think you'll see some of that after 13 f filings. There's a pathway to options getting listed on the ETF as well.
00:09:45.620 - 00:10:35.854, Speaker B: And more and more markets are opening up to the bitcoin ETF. And so I think this adoption story is one that continues. And the price action that you've had recently, testing 60k or 61 and change a bunch of moving average supports and bouncing right back, is highly constructive. It shows that it's an asset that's well supported and it's an asset that's becoming more institutionalized because as we know, institutions are generally dip buyers. And yeah, you've had some healthy developments. BlackRock launching that on chain money market fund and generally ETH commentary hasn't been that great. And you guys, Galaxy Research has a great piece talking about that.
00:10:35.854 - 00:10:47.218, Speaker B: But in alts, memes are still trading well and stuff, so I think this is a healthy market. It just went through a correction, but it's likely going to continue to trend higher. Trend is your friend.
00:10:47.386 - 00:10:47.666, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:10:47.690 - 00:10:51.952, Speaker A: There you go. Bimnet Abibi, my friend from Galaxy trading. Thank you so much.
00:10:52.058 - 00:10:53.464, Speaker B: Pleasure. Thanks for having me.
00:10:54.964 - 00:11:00.636, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, Will Nelly, general partner at Galaxy Ventures. Welcome to Galaxy Brains, Will.
00:11:00.740 - 00:11:04.572, Speaker C: Thank you, Alex. It's been a long time coming. We've been trying to make this happen for a little bit.
00:11:04.628 - 00:11:40.424, Speaker A: It has. So when I joined Galaxy, it was very clear to me that Will was one of the smartest people on blockchain technology that I had met. And it's only been further proven true, and we have some interesting, slightly esoteric topics for those interested in blockchain technology. Luckily, I know our audience is that I wanted to dig in with Will. But first I want to ask you just what's going on in venture right now? It's Q 120 24. Obviously, bitcoin is up, the liquid assets are ripping. But venture, as of the data we published at the end of Q four, was still making in new lows and deals.
00:11:40.424 - 00:11:47.036, Speaker A: Maybe that will change when we refresh the data. But what are the vibes out here? Are you guys very busy all of a sudden or more busy than last year?
00:11:47.200 - 00:12:39.272, Speaker C: The first quarter of the year has been basically a busier time than almost any in my career at Galaxy as working on and leading the venture team here. I think when the market, when the broader liquid market comes back, it gives investors this feeling of a margin of safety on their investments that they kind of lean into. I mean, you see it in the data. Historically, every time bitcoin rips, there's a lag that follows in venture funding. Obviously, venture deals, they'll get done at one time, and then they'll get announced something like three to six months later. There's some variation there, and so there's a natural lag in the data. But historically, it's, you know, that venture funding number has always, especially on the downside, as prices come down, venture funding stays high until investors kind of get the message.
00:12:39.272 - 00:13:45.694, Speaker C: I think it tracks a little bit closer than that. Real deep lag because of the announcement delay. I would say the Q four was busy actually, too, in 2022, as I think people were anticipating the market coming back then Q one starting really in the beginning of January, but especially picking up in mid and late January, has been some of the most frenetic, I think venture investing markets that I've seen. One of the reaction functions ultimately that causes that is projects which spent since 2021 or 2022 feeling like they couldn't go out to raise because it's going to take a lot. They might be able to get it done because they're great companies, but it's going to take a lot of time to actually get it done because investors are investing less, funding is down, and so they don't go out to market. They don't want to spend six months trying to fundraise. And so the second the word gets out that investors are kind of back in the market, then, then a ton of teams come back out to raise.
00:13:45.694 - 00:14:33.202, Speaker C: Of course, this is exactly as an investor, the time you want to be investing less. You want to have deployed in great opportunities in the previous year when it was slower and valuations were a little more compressed. It's this moment when everybody rushes back out at more bountiful valuations that you want to be most careful on. The converse teams that haven't raised since 2021, they might be raising their only round for the next 24 months. And there is a kind of game you have to play. Right. And so this might be your opportunity for two years to invest in some particular company you've been tracking and speaking with for that time.
00:14:33.202 - 00:14:49.702, Speaker C: And so you do have to play the game. You have to be very cautious and disciplined on value valuation at times like this, because you have this feeling of the margin of safety with the market going up and up and up. And then, as we know, especially in this industry, it turns.
00:14:49.798 - 00:14:51.714, Speaker A: It can come down, it turns quickly.
00:14:53.974 - 00:15:23.648, Speaker C: But for ventures at Galaxy, historically, we've maintained generally very steady pace of deployment, and we continue to see great entrepreneurial activity and great sort of crypto native talent, as well as more traditional talent that's building in this industry. And that really hasn't changed and remains true in q one of 2024. Yeah, I do expect the numbers to be substantially higher for q one of 2024.
00:15:23.696 - 00:15:26.056, Speaker A: So it is definitely a lot busier.
00:15:26.240 - 00:15:27.942, Speaker C: It is very active.
00:15:27.998 - 00:16:05.544, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. Cause you were also telling me before we started that in our data, which we publish quarterly crypto vc deal reports, which you can see on galaxy.com research, we had, and we did this sort of right at the end of Q four, we had Q four putting in, yet actually a new low in capital deployed by venture capitalists into early stage crypto startups. It was like one point something billion, I forget, but not still lower than the prior quarter. You were saying that once we, and we refresh every time when we do the Q 124 report, refresh the data from Q 423, we don't just use the existing data. We go back to capture any late announcements.
00:16:05.544 - 00:16:13.232, Speaker A: And you're saying that you actually think Q four will end up being bigger than Q three? That actually Q three of last year might have been the bottom, not Q four.
00:16:13.408 - 00:16:24.776, Speaker C: Yeah, if I had to guess that, that's true. Again, announcements typically happen, let's call it, on average, three months following, but sometimes six months, sometimes a year.
00:16:24.840 - 00:16:25.964, Speaker A: I know, I know.
00:16:27.374 - 00:16:47.390, Speaker C: There really is a lag to when the announcements are made. So I'd suspect q three ends up as the bottom, which is represented in q four data, and then q four ends up, which are announced in q one ends up higher and then q two of 2024 should be a sort of discontinuous jump if I had to sort of guess here.
00:16:47.462 - 00:17:20.858, Speaker A: There were a lot of teams that either, like you said, didn't want to raise again on the startup side because the valuations might have been too low or there wasn't a lot of capital. A lot of the generalist VC's really weren't around during the recent bear market we had, although crypto native VC's like yourself were. And so maybe they couldn't get the capital or they didn't like the terms they were saying, blah, blah, blah. So they were grinding and hunkering down. And I guess this is what you were kind of saying of like the game that may be played. They may see the frenetic activity as, okay, now's the time for us to go out and raise. Cause people are opening their checkbooks and they're.
00:17:20.906 - 00:18:06.616, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. And I mean, but even for gps, obviously galaxy, we invest off the balance sheet of the company, and so it's a little bit of a different sort of capital base than other venture funds in the industry have. But the logic isn't that different for gps either, where it was very hard to raise LP dollars in 2022 post FTX. But even ending in May of 2022, and especially in 2023, there weren't, you know, it wasn't a great environment for gps and funds to fundraise. Right, right. And so you can't, you know, they don't fill their coffers and so they, you know, they don't know when the next fund is coming and how big. And so you invest more slowly and more patiently.
00:18:06.616 - 00:19:14.274, Speaker C: And of course, now, you know, it remains to be seen, I think the institutional allocator community is still, is still trying to understand what the use cases are in crypto. I don't think it's, you know, it's a case where they're, their 2021 LP allocation activity was also frenetic and that group is trying to get a handle on what the real use cases beyond speculation is for cryptocurrencies. Thankfully, being at the early stage venture in the early stage venture seat for Galaxy, I am extremely confident in the long term use cases for blockchains beyond, you know, trading use cases. We're seeing a ton in payments and stablecoins that's exciting for us. We are probably going to publish a kind of analysis soon, Mike Giampapa and I, on what we're seeing in stablecoins being used for payments, in particular for cross border payments. B, two b, two c cross border payments instead of using swift, using stablecoins.
00:19:14.424 - 00:19:17.262, Speaker A: Ten x better, no brainer, ten x better product.
00:19:17.398 - 00:20:21.014, Speaker C: And it's just we're seeing secular growth. It's just at early, early stages right now of that secular growth. And so, you know, and so we're going to spend some time sharing with the world about that trend. And so that's some of the stuff we're seeing. And I think that question will get answered quickly for institutional allocators that, yes, payments with stablecoins on blockchain rails are a ten x better financial product than moving fiat over swift. Then it trickles from there. Then do you use stablecoins for payments over domestic systems or domestic payments? And then, of course, as we look forward into things like tokenization, using kind of all the financial infrastructure that's been built on chain and Defi and the general market structure of crypto that we've invested in and has been developed for the last, really, five or six years.
00:20:21.094 - 00:20:48.214, Speaker A: Yeah, very exciting. I mean, I think the stablecoin one is one of the most potent non bitcoin narratives. I think there's a lot of demand in the world now growing. I mean, growing demand for digitally distributed, non sovereign, fixed supply, inelastic supply, FX. That's the bitcoin story. But beyond that, we have all these other big ideas that people have had and built. Stables is obviously the killer app for tokenization so far.
00:20:48.214 - 00:21:05.612, Speaker A: Part of me wonders if, first of all, it's ludicrous that, like, even at a bank right now, I'm like, can I send money to this thing or withdraw from a fidelity account? Like, dude, stables should already be an option. It's ready. Like, stable coins are already ready for large volumes with all the l two s and stuff. So that's a clear one.
00:21:05.708 - 00:21:40.930, Speaker C: And just to highlight, you don't really need to even know you're transacting in stablecoins. And that's, I think the change that's made this really work, especially in the last, let's call it 18 to 24 months. But this is a process, right? It's a. We kind of bottoms up think it's roughly a $15 billion market in terms of gross payment volume on a per year basis. That's from looking at the traction of individual companies. It's growing 50% quarter over quarter. But you don't really have to know as a corporate that you're.
00:21:40.930 - 00:21:52.690, Speaker C: Or as a non crypto corporate, that you're using stablecoins in the backend, the workflow that we're seeing is fiat to stablecoins, stablecoins across the world, and then stablecoins out to a different fiat system.
00:21:52.722 - 00:21:53.290, Speaker A: Whatever you need.
00:21:53.322 - 00:22:12.498, Speaker C: Basically you might send, you might want to go uS dollar to a Singaporean bank account in Singapore, SGD, and you might go us dollar to USDT. USDT across the world over tron. Strangely enough. Block, the actual chain itself is somewhat variable.
00:22:12.586 - 00:22:13.074, Speaker A: I agree.
00:22:13.154 - 00:22:50.698, Speaker C: You can have, there's some flexibility there. And then you go USDT to singaporean dollar. And so what you need is really the market structure to be in place to make that transaction between. Make the market between dollars and tether and then tether to singaporean dollars. And once you solve that problem, you've made a ten x better product both on cost and on speed. So we're seeing that you don't, even if you're the corporate who's using it, who's you might be sending to a subsidiary in Singapore or sending money to a vendor or vice versa. You don't even need to know that it's stable coins on the back end.
00:22:50.698 - 00:23:36.656, Speaker C: You are avoiding two to four days over Swift. And it's a, it's a much better product. So the companies we're seeing now are at seed Series A and maybe the largest at the series B stages. In three years, four years, they'll be at the Series E stages. And then people will understand it and the scale of that opportunity will dwarf the kind of bitcoin as money and the opportunity with bitcoin and Defi and Ethereum. But it's going to be a identifiable be macro trend at that point that is visible because it's not at $15 billion a year in GMV over stable coins. It's much more at that point.
00:23:36.760 - 00:23:53.768, Speaker A: And then those bigger startups that have grown over that period, they can more credibly then sell to the bigger companies themselves. It's not just an interesting US Singapore, it could be the big tech companies now all start using it because they have a. A large enough partner.
00:23:53.896 - 00:24:10.840, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. And I mean, look, and that's kind of the s curve that you talk about, right? Like there's at some point where it reaches, like it becomes big enough, where it saturates the largest markets in the world, and then eventually they get so saturated that there's not enough new market to capture, which creates the shape of the s curve.
00:24:10.872 - 00:24:11.656, Speaker A: Right, right.
00:24:11.720 - 00:24:51.832, Speaker C: And I think we're pretty much at the very early stages of that particular s curve. I mean, if you look at just the size of the market for cross border b, two b payments in particular, it's $37 trillion a year in payment volume. It's $200 billion a year in revenue just from that market. And a lot of that doesn't all go. It kind of gets parceled among the sort of byzantine players in the payments space and banks and FX providers. A lot of it ends up on banks income statements, right? And banks in some ways have handicapped themselves at the knees because they can't touch. They don't really touch crypto.
00:24:51.832 - 00:25:13.192, Speaker C: So it leaves a massive opportunity for new players to gain market share. We're spending a lot of time there. We pair that, obviously with a real fundamental view on the underlying infrastructure that you should use. I mean, Tron, I mentioned Tron had really remarkable distribution.
00:25:13.368 - 00:25:39.042, Speaker A: I mean, I've explained this question before when people are like, why is there so much tether on Tron? I'm like, well, first of all, it's an ethereum clone, so it's the same tech. It was easy before all the alt two s. It was the easy, fast alt ETH clone that exchanges could add. So they did. It's fast and cheap. And sure, it doesn't have the same level of settlement assurances that, say, ethereum or other chains do, but with tokenized assets, that doesn't really matter, not in the same way it matters for natively digital assets. Right.
00:25:39.042 - 00:26:08.222, Speaker A: If something happens to Tron, then everybody can tether, can just make a facility that says, come here with your Tron wallet that had that tether in it. Sign this message and we'll just reissue, we'll cancel those tethers and give them to you on ETH or something. So like, it's not right. They can go elsewhere, too. It matters. But if we step back, I wanted to ask about the underlying infrastructure to beyond Tron and stables like you also, and this is a good segue to what we want to talk about. You guys do a lot on new protocols, blockchain technology design, and a bunch of other stuff, too.
00:26:08.222 - 00:26:12.446, Speaker A: But let's talk about that. What are the trends that you're seeing in blockchain technology?
00:26:12.630 - 00:26:18.222, Speaker C: Yeah, it's actually really, really interesting, the mention of Tron. I don't think we anticipated.
00:26:18.278 - 00:26:24.274, Speaker A: No, no. I don't want the audience to think that we're like huge investors in the Tron ecosystem or anything.
00:26:24.974 - 00:27:07.544, Speaker C: But it is interesting because, I mean, I published recently in November, I think, and I have a second version that I presented on at ETH Denver, which I'm going to turn into a kind of written piece where we want to do a real analysis of block space as a business model. This idea, just to go back to TRon for a second, this idea of why TrON succeeded. Yeah, you're right. At that time, it was an EVM compatible chain. It was the lowest cost chain at the time. It provided some really interesting benefits to the particular use cases that were existing on it. And fundamentally it created a network effect.
00:27:07.544 - 00:27:57.926, Speaker C: There's now a network effect around capital on TROn, around liquidity on TRON. And for people in the payments ecosystem, specifically of integrations, like infrastructure integrations, the things you have to think about when you're talking about a network effect. If you want people to use your blockchain, you need fire blocks to support your blockchain. You need so that people can transact on it. You need sort of on ramps and off ramps to support it. You need market makers who are providing that USDT to USD leg to be there accepting deposits or accepting transfers in and sending transfers out on that infrastructure. I think in the defi context, if you're going to talk about smart contract dexs or exchanges, you need liquidity, liquidity in those contracts.
00:27:57.926 - 00:28:43.760, Speaker C: And so there's this really, and just to maybe to zoom out and how we think about block space. It is a like. I think the market has to get towards thinking about block space as a product that's sold to the market, not this ephemeral kind of like thing that blockchains produce, that people, you know, you know, that people consume as they're using blockchains, which is kind of a public good. It is a public good and it's built as a public good. It's decentralized. There's no, the beneficiaries or owners of that are the kind of token holders of the systems themselves. But at the end of the day, blockspace is a product that's consumed by users, right? It's a consumer product in some ways, right.
00:28:43.760 - 00:29:40.762, Speaker C: And there's a degree to which it's b two b to c, because you sell, if you're a blockchain, like Ethereum, you're really selling to application developers who then go on and sell their application to users, or the consumption of their application to users. And that's, I think, the frame of reference or the frame of mind that we have in the venture team on block space we're looking for when we're investing in new blockchains. L1 s, l two s, data availability. Obviously, we were really excited about our investment in Celestia, and that was really differentiated their offering. And we could talk about that. We've come to think about block spaces, basically one of four categories that has the opportunity for robust, repeatable product market fit in the space. I mean, investors are, especially venture capital investors are in the business fundamentally not of finding new technologies, but finding new business models.
00:29:40.762 - 00:30:08.094, Speaker C: Right. And finding how new technologies create new business models. This was the case of search, of course, with Google. The new technology that Google brought to the table, which was Pagerank and enhanced search capabilities, created the new business model of sort of eyeballs and advertising to all the eyeballs. That was the business model innovation. So we think about basically the four categories of product market fit in crypto today are software businesses. This is a traditional SaaS.
00:30:08.094 - 00:30:39.030, Speaker C: SaaS businesses fire blocks, alchemies of the world. You could put some of the staking as a service provider. These are the big infrastructure players that are providing software. The second category is exchanges. Their tendency to financialize everything in crypto is really conducive to product market fit. Exchanges make huge profits, really great at unit economics. Binance and Coinbase and so on are kind of the proof is in the pudding there.
00:30:39.030 - 00:31:39.654, Speaker C: We think about, and this is a more complicated category, net interest margin businesses. I say I leave it broad like that. This is both lending businesses what Galaxy, a lot of what Galaxy does from our trading division, as well as stablecoin providers. Stablecoins are at really, in some ways, net interest margin businesses that are capturing a spread on yield versus deposits. Then the fourth category is really the sale of block space to consumers as a category of product market fit. And if you ranked the, the four categories in terms of annual revenues, and I've kind of roughly done this math, exchanges are actually the most profitable category in terms of generating the most top line revenue. Net interest margins businesses, arguably because of stablecoins, are the second most profitable because the NIM is so wide.
00:31:39.734 - 00:31:45.510, Speaker A: I mean, you're talking about like tether's giant pile of treasuries and they pass zero of the interest back to the token holder.
00:31:45.542 - 00:32:05.974, Speaker C: So it's just, and like the NIM is so big for them right now, particularly because treasury yields are very high. And so I expect that one to come at least the profitability of that business to kind of in aggregate come down over time is, I mean, you just look at the history of banks net interest margins, and it shouldn't be.
00:32:06.634 - 00:32:14.338, Speaker A: The entire treasury combination of treasuries, rates coming down, and growing demand worldwide to pass some of that back to the hold.
00:32:14.386 - 00:33:02.392, Speaker C: And just like in stock ranking, like the exchanges hard to say exactly the revenue per year because I don't, off the top of my head, know Binance's revenues and like a lot of those are private companies. But it's, well, and if I had to sort of put a finger on it, it's well in excess of $10 billion a year in sort of gross revenues for, you know, for stablecoin, net interest, borrowing businesses, mostly stablecoins. In practice it's probably around five to six per year. These are really rough numbers. Cause I haven't done the exact math. I mean, blockchains, block space in the analysis I've done. And we have databases and real time feeds that track transaction fees paid to all the major blockchain environments.
00:33:02.392 - 00:33:32.792, Speaker C: Last year, by my analysis it was 2.8 billion of transaction fees bought from blockchains paid to use block space. And then, and then the fourth category, software businesses, is probably around a mil, a million or, sorry, a billion in gross revenues. So you can see the stack ranking of the four categories. Block space is that third category. I think it expands from here. I think it eventually goes to number two, maybe uh, depending on the relationship between dexs and sexes in the long term.
00:33:32.792 - 00:34:04.424, Speaker C: Yeah, maybe to number one. But it's the most interesting business model. And just to highlight, highlight it for a second, it's also the most novel. Fundamentally, it's essentially selling cloud compute. It's like selling Amazon EC two compute, except with some really distinct properties just to highlight them. The first is network effects. Amazon EC two, cloud computing has economies of scale, not network effects.
00:34:04.424 - 00:34:10.482, Speaker C: Block space fundamentally has network effects around capital, liquidity, application deployments, developers, etcetera.
00:34:10.538 - 00:34:18.346, Speaker A: Right? One app by itself doing well on a blockchain is good, but better if there's a whole ecosystem extreme, extremely hard to disrupt.
00:34:18.410 - 00:34:46.080, Speaker C: For example, in an environment like Ethereum, where a ton of people have deployed billions of dollars of capital in thousands of applications, right? Where there's a huge developer community, there's hackathons all over the world. It's really hard to disrupt. Right? And so network effects is one of the key criteria. The other one is actually high profitability. I know that sounds surprising, but these are if you just. We'll link to my analysis.
00:34:46.152 - 00:34:47.816, Speaker A: Yeah, we will. In the show notes. So check that out.
00:34:47.880 - 00:35:38.930, Speaker C: There are really high gross margins in the long term and really high net income margins. There's no real opex to blockchains. Everything is basically paid out as like a direct cost. So everything is cogs, cost of goods sold for people, where you're paying out validators, to basically provide the service to the network. But beyond paying out the validators, there's no other real expenses. It's not like Uber, for example, which has to pay out drivers, but then has the big corp that they have to pay out Opex to. It's as if almost running Ethereum is almost as if the drivers were sort of essentially running their own computer network to actually do all the routing algorithm and essentially orchestrate the sort of driver network on Ethereum or something.
00:35:38.930 - 00:35:57.998, Speaker C: And so there's some really interesting properties. The negative is, in comparison to SAS, there's high cyclicality to block space. It sort of ebbs and flows both with the general demand for trading volume as well as, I think, for exchanges more broadly.
00:35:58.086 - 00:36:27.322, Speaker A: But yeah, the cyclicality of fees on transaction fees on blockchains is well known and it has positive feedback loops. So, like, as fees go up, people stop paying, they go to cheaper block space environments, but then the high fees end up creating innovations that make it cheaper and faster. So then they come back, and then they go back. And you see that with Alt L1 rotation trading. You see it with. You'll see it now with the l two s. I wanted to ask you, I love the way that you think about this, about block space.
00:36:27.322 - 00:36:42.690, Speaker A: I wanted to ask you. There was the dancun upgrade on Ethereum this week. It creates a new type of block space on Ethereum. They call them blobs. It stands for something, actually, but we'll just call them blobs. It's a nice acronym. It's actually somewhat similar to Segwit on bitcoin.
00:36:42.690 - 00:37:09.718, Speaker A: I made this point several times and people are like, no, it's different. I'm like, well, it's a segregated space for data of a certain type. I mean, Segwit had multiple things, but it did also enable lightning in a similar way also in l two on bitcoin, in a similar way that blobs now on Ethereum are sort of segregated block space for roll up data. And if they use it, they pay less. Right. It's something. What's your take on that? As a block space aficionado?
00:37:09.806 - 00:37:53.704, Speaker C: We're all here in service of the belief that, like, there is more demand for block space in ten years than there is today. I'm a believer that generally financial services use cases will consume a ton of block space in the future. I mean, as you like. Let's just think about this as you bring. We all kind of saw the highlights yesterday from Dengku, and it brought l two transaction fees from twenty cents to a tenth of a cent, right. Which, you know, Solana has been doing really cheap block space for a long time, so it's nothing new. I think the demand on Solana has pushed that to on the order of about a cent per transaction.
00:37:53.704 - 00:38:59.300, Speaker C: I think again, the new Denkun blob space is artificially cheap as demand will continue to build for this blob space and so it will eventually trend up towards ascent. But you think about the induced demand as you bring costs down. Now, if you can run a central limit order book, just as an example application on an l two for a 10th of a cent the market making. So you can't really run a central limit order book on an l two today because the unit economics for market makers and generally market participants, when you are sending an order and then you want to cancel it or reposition your spread, it costs twenty cents to just cancel an order. And you're trying to do that like, you know, hundreds of thousands, a lot of messages, hundreds of thousands of messages or something like, something like that. You. It's fundamentally unworkable, but when you're talking about a 10th of a cent, it really transforms the unit economics of the applications that can work on top of these environments.
00:38:59.300 - 00:39:47.112, Speaker C: And so it takes time. But I anticipate induced demand that Den Koon opens up and generally the new blob space opens up. People have been saying this for a long time about Solana, like, ok, we can run all these new applications, which is, I'm super supportive of that, and that's all well and good. The thing is, as I said, there's strong network effects around these systems. There's network effects around the EVM solidity. And EVM have become a standard, not the only possible standard, but a standard for blockchain development. And it's almost like JavaScript, right? Maybe a slightly suboptimal language, but kind of just had some virality and had some staying power.
00:39:47.168 - 00:40:18.428, Speaker A: They even say TCP IP, not necessarily the best packet transfer protocol, but the winner and certainly good enough. I mean, that's the thing. Before we wrap, I wanted to ask you too, in light of this. So in light of, let's say, dancun and the roll ups which are working and are widely adopted, will get even more performant. And when ZK rollups become widely used, perhaps even safer or more private or faster, whatever, there's more technology there. But they clearly work today. And a large swath or most of the Ethereum ecosystem basically just considers them part of Ethereum.
00:40:18.428 - 00:41:07.962, Speaker A: And now they can be be cheaper as well. You mentioned Solana. Solana is. I've been talking about it. I think we think just objectively looking at user data adoption metrics is sort of the third chain behind bitcoin and ETH does. And there are still yet new performant l one s that are either just launched or going to launch. But what do you think the Ethereum as the central hub with these now increasingly performant and inexpensive l two s as the spokes does Dancun signal the start of the resurgence of Ethereum against something like a Solana or other high performance alt l one s in ten years? Do we need anything else beyond bitcoin and ethereum, or will there still definitely be others in your mind?
00:41:08.098 - 00:42:06.138, Speaker C: Yeah, first and foremost, it's a hard network effect to disrupt. That's the point with network effects is like they have staying power because there's concentration there. So I think it's generally hard to disrupt in the same way that Solana is literally, Solana is building a network effect today. Right. It is building as applications, users and generally attention flock to Solana, it is in the process of building a strong network effect that I think cements it as the third major player. But my view is like bitcoin is in that lane. And the critique that once you open it up to ethereum, which is not as much about money per se, and more about programmability and application deployments, we're somewhere up the S curve on, I think, new technology in terms of smart contracting platforms.
00:42:06.138 - 00:42:44.154, Speaker C: And I'd probably say we're halfway up the S curve in terms of blockchain design and deployment. I'm seeing new ideas, there are new ideas out there. We are investing in new ideas and new environments. The North Star is like they have to be differentiated enough to build a network effect long term. If they can't build a network effect, they're going to be in the useless part of the power law distribution. We want them to be in the fat tail of the power law distribution. But we're certainly going to continue investing in, in new ideas that can build a network effect like Solana.
00:42:44.154 - 00:43:10.900, Speaker C: I expect ethereum to have staying power. I expect Solana to have staying power. But I don't think the generation of blockchain design and new ideas there is over. I talked to a really fascinating team this morning with some really fascinating ideas about consensus. And I know there's lots of ideas as well about parallelization of execution that are powerful. You know, we're 50% of the way through the story.
