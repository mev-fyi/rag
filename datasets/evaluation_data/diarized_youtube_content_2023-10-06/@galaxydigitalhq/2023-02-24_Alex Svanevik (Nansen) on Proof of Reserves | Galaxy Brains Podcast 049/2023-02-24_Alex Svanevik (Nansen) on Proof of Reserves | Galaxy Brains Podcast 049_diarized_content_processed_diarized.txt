00:00:06.840 - 00:00:49.958, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research recording live in New York. In my gamo sneakers I'm flipping on the old tech like I'm rolling beepers we're in the arena we're not up in the bleachers a couple special features can't hold a candle me, I'm heavy on the block, yo, I let my handle speak we analyze the chain just to take a little peek with help from our guest, Nansen's a Savanna Vik. As always, I'm your host, Alex Alex Thorne, head of firmware research at Galaxy Digital. We have a great show today. We're talking with Nansen's CEO and founder, Alex Savannah Vic, about proof of reserves and on chain data. It's a great discussion I know you'll enjoy. And of course we'll check in with our good friend Bimnet, a BB from Galaxy trading about markets and get an update there.
00:00:49.958 - 00:01:12.318, Speaker A: But before we get into all of that, I need to tell you to please refer to the link to disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice, a recommendation, offer, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. That's all we've got for the intro. I think we're ready to hop right into it. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Digital trading. As always, great to have you here.
00:01:12.406 - 00:01:13.398, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:01:13.486 - 00:01:14.390, Speaker A: How's it going?
00:01:14.542 - 00:02:04.594, Speaker B: You know, it's going, it's going. Markets have kind of turned a little bit recently. It's been off the back of really exceptionally strong like us data, PPI employment stuff. And you've also had some pretty hawkish Fed speak, although it's not new. So you've had a repricing in the rate market, and that's kind of caused equities to take a little bit of a break. I think it's totally reasonable taking a step back. I think what has driven a lot of price action this year in many markets has been an incredible degree of short covering, whether it was in crypto or EM equities or nonprofitable tech that had been beaten up.
00:02:04.594 - 00:02:39.366, Speaker B: So what you've had happen to start the year is a massive repricing of risk assets as folks got stopped out of things. And to give you an idea, looking at some PB data that we follow, one bank reported they had twelve consecutive days of just insane short covering. It was one of the longest periods like that in their entire history. That they kept track of the data. So you had a lot of shortcoming. And we knew that in crypto, at least, there was $500 million in liquidations. Both of those times that crypto really popped up.
00:02:39.366 - 00:03:15.002, Speaker B: So a lot of the price action this year has been driven by short covering. And then you got to a point last week where you had a really aggressive rate move. And so once the short covering is done, you really need marginal buyers to kind of support that market. And every market, and at least in traditional markets, equities kind of lack that marginal buyer in a meaningful way, because, as we mentioned earlier, a lot of that buying was driven by short covering and then a little bit of fomo.
00:03:15.058 - 00:03:16.586, Speaker A: So it's been drifting a little lower.
00:03:16.610 - 00:04:16.216, Speaker B: Over the years, it's been drifting a little lower. And I think that speaks to kind of one of the points I hope we touch on later, which is excess liquidity in the market. I think people totally have a misunderstanding of what that means in today's context, because the difference between excess funds in a 0% interest rate environment and excess liquidity in a 5% interest rate environment is tremendous. In one, you don't get paid to sleep at night. In another, you get paid quite well to sleep super comfortably. And so what that means is every time that a marginal dollar gets deployed in risk assets, it's at the cost of 5% overnight rates. And so even if you have $100 billion of excess liquidity in the market, that 100 billion's earning 5% plus at no risk.
00:04:16.216 - 00:04:32.220, Speaker B: And so I get it. When people talk about there's still tons of cash in the market, the market's awash, people still trying to buy stuff. But don't forget, we're in a 5% overnight interest rate environment, and that's fundamentally.
00:04:32.292 - 00:04:35.668, Speaker A: Different than you're not hunting for hunting for yield.
00:04:35.756 - 00:04:52.924, Speaker B: You're not forced to go out the risk curve. It used to be that fixed income investors, to get any yield, would have to go so far out the curve, you got to take risk. 710 year duration. Well, now, overnight duration gets you much better yield than that ten year paper.
00:04:52.964 - 00:04:53.556, Speaker A: It's crazy.
00:04:53.660 - 00:05:12.992, Speaker B: And so it is wild. And I think people have a complete misunderstanding of that construct. And what does that mean in actuality? It means that people don't feel like they have to buy the dip in stocks. There's no urgency, or at least the institutional investor doesn't.
00:05:13.088 - 00:05:19.744, Speaker A: So I think one of the reasons you bring this up, too, is that there have been some headlines about some central banks that have been injecting more liquidity.
00:05:19.824 - 00:05:20.224, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:05:20.264 - 00:05:22.888, Speaker A: I think people on Twitter have been misinterpreting that.
00:05:23.016 - 00:05:24.244, Speaker B: No, absolutely.
00:05:24.744 - 00:05:25.624, Speaker A: What were those?
00:05:25.744 - 00:06:04.110, Speaker B: There's a difference between actually buying assets in the open market and providing financing for them. For example, the PBOC, they reverse repo and assets, they provide short term lending versus an asset. And so somebody gets cash versus securities, but it's not really a sale and their balance sheet isn't really going up. A lot of those funds tend to stick in the financial plumbing or the banking system within their respective economy. Japan being another example where they're doing all these emergency bond purchases. And that money is really, it's not going past the japanese banking system.
00:06:04.302 - 00:06:07.494, Speaker A: So it doesn't filter out in a way that it can support risk assets.
00:06:07.534 - 00:06:21.534, Speaker B: For example, it's less direct than people are thinking versus when the Fed was buying $4 billion of treasuries and mortgage backed assets. No, that was a big deal.
00:06:21.614 - 00:06:23.446, Speaker A: Yeah. That was directly in the market.
00:06:23.510 - 00:06:43.520, Speaker B: That was directly in the market, but they were also doing it by providing all these financing lines and facilities, et cetera. But, yeah, it's a different paradigm now. And I think people are constantly misinterpreting it because nobody is used to the idea of higher interest rates.
00:06:43.592 - 00:06:46.768, Speaker A: When was the last time rates were this high? I mean, like decades. Right.
00:06:46.816 - 00:06:48.376, Speaker B: Well, do we even get this high in 2000?
00:06:48.440 - 00:06:50.128, Speaker A: Well, did we get that high in 2000?
00:06:50.176 - 00:06:50.656, Speaker C: How high did we.
00:06:50.680 - 00:06:52.552, Speaker B: Yeah, but it's.
00:06:52.568 - 00:06:53.672, Speaker A: Okay. 20 years, though.
00:06:53.728 - 00:06:57.528, Speaker B: But it's been a while. It's been a while. But it's also the idea of hire for longer.
00:06:57.616 - 00:07:12.240, Speaker A: Right, right. And that's when you said that the markets are repricing the rates market. That's what they're seeing. That Fed speak, that hawkish Fed speak last week has resulted in. I think we were looking at it right. There's. Now they had been pricing and the market had been pricing in some cuts.
00:07:12.240 - 00:07:13.032, Speaker A: By the end of the year, you.
00:07:13.048 - 00:07:16.048, Speaker B: Had about 70 basis points of repricing of cuts.
00:07:16.096 - 00:07:20.712, Speaker A: We went from what, like cutting 50 to like, even still rising. And I don't have it off the.
00:07:20.728 - 00:07:29.418, Speaker B: Top of my head, but, yeah, more like cutting like 130. And you went to like flat, like closer to like 60 or 50 or, you know.
00:07:29.466 - 00:07:33.354, Speaker A: Yeah. So again, higher for longer is being further priced in now.
00:07:33.434 - 00:07:34.034, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:07:34.194 - 00:07:44.814, Speaker B: And the reason for it, I mean, Bullard explained it this morning on CNBC, and it's like you have risks of like inflation taking off again.
00:07:45.194 - 00:07:51.818, Speaker A: That is what they don't want. That's what we don't want the seventies to happen. Where it's like, correct. They raise, then they lower, then inflation happens, they have to raise again.
00:07:51.906 - 00:07:59.552, Speaker B: And then when you think about it in the context of the employment market, the, basically the employment market's like telling you, you can do whatever you want.
00:07:59.608 - 00:08:00.808, Speaker A: We can bear more hikes.
00:08:00.856 - 00:08:11.304, Speaker B: We can bear more hikes. So why not do it right? You're not putting the real, you can always cut. You can always cut. You're not really putting the labor market at risk by jacking up rates.
00:08:11.344 - 00:08:11.800, Speaker D: Not yet.
00:08:11.872 - 00:08:12.224, Speaker B: Not yet.
00:08:12.264 - 00:08:12.984, Speaker A: They can go higher.
00:08:13.064 - 00:08:43.980, Speaker B: They can. It's just a risk reward decision that the Fed is making. At the same time, you can see like, housing inventories are up, like, the interest rate sensitive parts of the economy are reacting appropriately, and there are always unintended consequences to huge monetary policy changes and big ones. And so I definitely think that while I appreciate Bullard's argument that you're not really risking much by jacking up rates.
00:08:44.012 - 00:08:45.824, Speaker A: Really high, something could happen.
00:08:46.444 - 00:09:00.354, Speaker B: Yeah, something could easily happen. And I just, you just have to think, like, it's not like a month of high rates will crack the market, but six months of really high rates, a year of really high rates, like.
00:09:00.394 - 00:09:01.538, Speaker A: You just don't know yet.
00:09:01.666 - 00:09:03.034, Speaker D: But you said this before too.
00:09:03.074 - 00:09:26.566, Speaker A: Like, you know, when rates are at zero, well, you've got no more tools in your tool belt if you have to stimulate the economy, right? But if rates are at five, you can cut them back, right? So it's like go high when you can, knowing that if shit starts to break, you can then pull back because you have all this airspace below you. And that seems to be the calculus right now, right?
00:09:26.630 - 00:09:27.206, Speaker B: That is the calculus.
00:09:27.230 - 00:09:30.590, Speaker A: We can bear more. So why not do it and then we'll pull back if we have to.
00:09:30.662 - 00:09:48.044, Speaker B: No, absolutely. But it's just like, I keep trying to think about like what the end game or what the end status of this looks like. And it's really tough for me to see a scenario where everything's going to shit per se.
00:09:48.124 - 00:09:48.744, Speaker A: Right.
00:09:49.364 - 00:10:16.034, Speaker B: Everything that I'm looking at, it's like, you understand the inflation problem we have now is it's a good problem to have. The economy is so strong and so robust that it could handle four or 5% interest rates while making more people employed and while people are getting raises and generally people are feeling good. Gas prices have been coming off. Like, this is like a very desirable economy.
00:10:16.074 - 00:10:29.770, Speaker A: The economy is doing pretty well, is what you're saying. Super well. It's not great for investing necessarily right now, but for working and earning and even saving better savers market than it's been in decades.
00:10:29.882 - 00:11:06.358, Speaker B: Correct. And so really, I mean, I had a manager once that describes it this way, but it's basically central bank policy for the past three decades, with the exception of last year, has been crucifying the savings base. But historically you weren't getting compensated to save. Basically led to just a lot more consumption because nobody ever got paid to save. You got paid to invest and putting money in stock markets. But for your average mom, pa, putting money into savings, it's been awful. I'll argue with you that it is still awful.
00:11:06.358 - 00:11:09.766, Speaker B: You were talking about like somebody was telling me, I actually haven't checked.
00:11:09.790 - 00:11:11.150, Speaker A: Yeah, like the banks aren't passing it through.
00:11:11.182 - 00:11:11.754, Speaker D: Right.
00:11:12.294 - 00:11:19.630, Speaker B: Exactly. The savings rate, interest rates on most, like Ma and Pa checking accounts are still like sub 100 basis points.
00:11:19.702 - 00:11:20.150, Speaker A: Crazy.
00:11:20.222 - 00:11:36.874, Speaker B: Even though they're parking at four plus, so they're collecting a huge interest rate margin. I think folks over time will wake up to that and demand, and they will go to treasury direct and buy bills or they'll move to savings accounts that are much more attractive.
00:11:36.914 - 00:11:38.786, Speaker A: Competition will emerge. Better.
00:11:38.890 - 00:11:45.914, Speaker B: It will emerge. And I'll give you an example. Treasury direct is one of the most searched things on investopedia this year because.
00:11:45.954 - 00:11:51.082, Speaker A: Everybody'S like, oh, wait, I can buy these things. Right from the government itself. Okay, one more thing I wanted to bring up.
00:11:51.098 - 00:11:51.754, Speaker B: I could go all day.
00:11:51.794 - 00:12:05.848, Speaker A: I know. One more thing I want to bring up before we move on and wrap this up, we've talked about central banks, Augustine Carsten's, who is the chief, the head of the bank of international settlements, the bis rolls off the tongue.
00:12:05.896 - 00:12:06.128, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:12:06.176 - 00:12:38.918, Speaker A: Often called the central bankers central bank. He said, there's a headline in Bloomberg Pontification Square, he said crypto lost the battle against fiat currency. He says, quote, the battle has been won. Carson's told Bloomberg TV in an interview Wednesday a technology doesn't make trusted money. And I will just say when I read this, first of all, I think of like superhero movies, there's always a supervillain who's prematurely declaring victory. And to me when I read this, I think, sir, you know, and he's certainly, I think, you know, on economics and monetary stuff, I'm sure he's a.
00:12:38.926 - 00:12:39.758, Speaker D: Lot smarter than I am.
00:12:39.806 - 00:12:45.314, Speaker A: But I will say pretty sure bitcoin and crypto has not run its course yet.
00:12:45.614 - 00:12:46.518, Speaker B: No, absolutely.
00:12:46.566 - 00:12:48.398, Speaker A: Seems like you're calling the game a little early there, sir.
00:12:48.446 - 00:13:13.064, Speaker B: No, he's definitely calling the game a little bit early now. But, you know, I definitely respect his point of view from the standpoint of. Okay, like, you know, what are the key things that crypto is trying to accomplish? Right. Like, instant 24 settlement at all times. Right. That's something that these central banks can get to eventually.
00:13:13.104 - 00:13:14.832, Speaker A: They could do that. They could compete with that.
00:13:14.888 - 00:13:15.924, Speaker B: Oh, absolutely.
00:13:16.304 - 00:13:19.632, Speaker A: We know they can't compete with scarcity in the end.
00:13:19.688 - 00:13:20.584, Speaker B: Yes, scarcity.
00:13:20.664 - 00:13:22.096, Speaker A: They will always print more money.
00:13:22.160 - 00:13:22.924, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:13:23.424 - 00:13:42.488, Speaker B: I mean, it's literally in the term economics. Economics is a study of scarcity, essentially. And so, like. Yeah, the bitcoin story, that's not over. Yeah, he is, by any means. But could I understand why he's saying that about something like stables? Yes.
00:13:42.616 - 00:13:46.016, Speaker A: I mean, a lot of the world's working on CBdcs. Absolutely.
00:13:46.120 - 00:13:50.944, Speaker B: And it's crazy to think, I mean, the privacy considerations are just so immense.
00:13:51.024 - 00:13:51.712, Speaker A: Enormous.
00:13:51.848 - 00:14:05.440, Speaker B: And money has never, like, been investigated that. That way. Or, like, tracking people in real time as they spend. I mean, you have countries that are giving people social scorecards, basically spending. Right.
00:14:05.472 - 00:14:09.168, Speaker A: Like, you can have, like, exploding payments where, like, if you don't spend it in, like, ten days.
00:14:09.216 - 00:14:09.544, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:09.624 - 00:14:19.572, Speaker A: Lose it. Or if you actually spend it on it. No, it's. That's a. You know what? We're going to do a show on cbdcs at some point, so let's table that. But that is a huge issue. And I.
00:14:19.748 - 00:14:23.244, Speaker B: And also, for anybody that didn't check out last week's podcast with Austin Cannon.
00:14:23.284 - 00:14:27.204, Speaker A: With Austin, it was unbelievable. That guy is a genius in the stablecoin world.
00:14:27.244 - 00:14:27.892, Speaker D: Yes.
00:14:28.068 - 00:14:42.836, Speaker A: Well, Ben, great as always. Great to see you and pleasure, and thanks for coming. Let's go now to my interview with Alex. Savannah Veeck, founder and CEO of Nansen, an on chain data and analysis company. Alex is in Singapore. We're in New York. So we previously recorded this at a time that worked for both of us.
00:14:42.836 - 00:14:46.720, Speaker A: Let's run it. Let's go now to our guest, Alex.
00:14:46.752 - 00:14:50.808, Speaker D: Savanovic, CEO and founder of Nansen. How are you, Alex? Good to see you.
00:14:50.936 - 00:14:52.704, Speaker C: I'm great, Alex. Thanks for having me.
00:14:52.784 - 00:14:56.136, Speaker D: I've really wanted to talk to you. Alex, we got two. Alex's talking crypto.
00:14:56.160 - 00:14:56.440, Speaker C: It's.
00:14:56.512 - 00:15:22.462, Speaker D: What a thing. I've really wanted to talk to you for a long time, but in particular, after. Let's get right into this. After the FTX collapse, there was a big renewed push for proof of reserves at exchanges, and Nansen was at the forefront with Binance, sort of, I guess. How did this happen? You have a dashboard that shows Binance's declared assets. Did they reach out to you? Did you reach out to them to get those addresses tagged? How did that work?
00:15:22.598 - 00:16:15.076, Speaker C: Yeah, it's funny, this is something I've been talking about for a long time. I think the first time I spoke up about it in public was when I was on a panel here in Singapore with the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the MAS, which is kind of like the Fed and the SEC, and kind of all the regulators and central bank roll up into one entity. And I was suggesting that they should ask for any licensed exchange in Singapore to disclose their addresses so that people could have more transparency on what's happening with customer deposits. So this was in September, and of course, we know what happened a couple of months later with FTX. And so somehow the industry kind of had to self regulate instead. And I was pushing for this a lot on Twitter. Of course, many people were pushing for this, that we need more transparency.
00:16:15.076 - 00:17:20.436, Speaker C: We had been tracking exchanges for years at that point, actually. But our methods, which maybe we'll get into a bit later, are somewhat probabilistic, and we can never claim that we have 100% coverage of all the exchange wallets. But so after FTX, I think the other exchanges realized that, hey, it's probably in our own best interest to be more transparent about our reserves. And so thankfully, CZ and Binance led the way here, and they disclosed lots of their wallets where they have most of the customer deposits in storage. And the nice thing about this was that we have a product called nonsense portfolio, which allows people to plug in addresses from 45 different blockchains and get kind of one overview of your holdings. And so that was built actually to help investors like you and me to keep track of our holdings. But it turns out that it was also really useful to show the exchange reserves in real time.
00:17:20.436 - 00:17:55.032, Speaker C: So basically, we took the addresses from Binance and just plugged it into our product Nelson portfolio, which you can check at portfolio nonsense AI. And that created a dashboard, which we created a permanent link for dashboard Binance, and they could share that. And then what happened next was that all the other exchanges wanted to do the same thing. So crypto.com reached out to us, Bitfinex reached out, darribit, lots of the other exchanges. And so we did the same thing. It was very easy for us at that point.
00:17:55.032 - 00:18:41.718, Speaker C: We just said, just give us your addresses and we'll plug them into the dashboard and people, and you'll get a link that you can share with your community, your customers, your investors and whatnot. And actually, now I've seen that some exchanges actually use their nonsense portfolio dashboard in their investor updates as like they just screenshot it and share it with their investors to say, here's how much assets we hold, which is pretty cool. But yeah, this was a service we did free of charge to the exchanges. We felt it was good for the community to have more transparency. Our vision is to create transparency in a tokenized world. So that's kind of how it came about. It was a great example of how industry can self regulate and create more transparency.
00:18:41.846 - 00:19:14.924, Speaker D: Yeah, that sounds great. It makes a lot of sense. There was a similar push for those that were around in the crypto world after Mount Gox for proof of reserves, and several exchanges performed them then. And only a few have really done it, though, until FTX. I know Kraken and BitMex have both done some periodically on their own volition, sort of outside of this collapsing the schedule of periodic exchange collapse. I just want to follow up on a couple of things, Alex, because you said that Binance had disclosed lots of addresses for most of their customer assets. What do you mean by that?
00:19:15.004 - 00:20:23.122, Speaker C: Well, one common misconception is that if you go on, say, etherscan, and you look up which binance wallets are there, that's going to show you the totality of assets. In reality, binance manages tens of millions of addresses, because when you deposit funds into binance, you get your own address. And so every account has its own unique address, and for some exchanges, you might even have multiple addresses that you control. And these assets are not directly consolidated into these main wallets, as we like to refer to them as. And so binance definitely disclosed the vast majority of the assets that they custody on behalf of customers. But of course, they didn't disclose the tens of millions of addresses, and that's something we do separately with our algorithms and our research that we tag up these different addresses. So with nuns, and we have tens of millions of, if not more than 100 million, I think it's.
00:20:23.122 - 00:20:40.970, Speaker C: I don't know the exact number, top of my head, but we have tens of millions of exchange addresses that we have labeled up. So, yeah, it is lots of addresses, but in the grand scheme of things, it's still a small portion. So you don't get the full view only with what they have disclosed.
00:20:41.042 - 00:20:49.302, Speaker D: So it's more like the addresses that they disclosed. We can. Did they prove that they own those addresses to you? Did they sign messages with them?
00:20:49.458 - 00:21:31.946, Speaker C: That is a great question, and that's why I typically don't use the term proof of reserves myself, because, no, they did not sign cryptographic messages with the addresses. They should have done that if we wanted to really consider it proof. So we are trusting that they sent that they actually control the addresses. Of course, in practical terms, if someone else owned the address, they could speak up and say, actually, I own this address, and then they could sign a message. So it's very, very, very unlikely that they would share an address that they don't control. So that was more like for practical purposes. So, yeah, they should have signed them, and it'd be great.
00:21:31.946 - 00:21:40.162, Speaker C: They can actually sign them through nonsense with the portfolio, but it's not something that we require to publish them.
00:21:40.338 - 00:21:49.582, Speaker D: The other point, nor do I think you should have, but, yeah, I want to raise this as sort of this nuance about proof of reserves or proof of assets. Yeah, sorry, you were going to go on.
00:21:49.678 - 00:22:40.034, Speaker C: Yeah. The other point is a pushback that is often presented against proof of reserves is that proof of reserves is not enough, because you need to have proof of liabilities. And I just kind of wanted to mention that because that's also true. If you want to get to proof of solvency, which is ultimately what you care about, you need to have proof reserves and you need to have proof of liabilities. However, there is this misconception, again, that means that proof of reserves does not have any value, and I don't think that's true. There are many examples of exchanges or lending platforms doing quite risky things with customer deposits, which would have been spotted if we had proof of reserves. For example, let's say you're.
00:22:40.034 - 00:23:10.446, Speaker C: There's an example of a lending platform here in Singapore where there was something like $500 million deposited. I think, top of my head, something like three or 400 million out of that was deposited into anchor. Like, converted to UST. Deposited to anchor UST deepeggs. And so even if you didn't have the liabilities part, if you saw that on chain, which we did, then that should have raised some flags for regulators and customers as well.
00:23:10.530 - 00:23:43.414, Speaker D: Yeah, that's a great point. Several great points. I agree that I personally, when I say proof of reserves, I. There's a lot of literature on this, and I typically do encompass proof of both assets and liabilities in there. But you're absolutely right. You know, if I have $500, but, and I prove to you that I've got it and it's yours, but it turns out I also owe a dollar 500 elsewhere, and that's not included, then, of course, I'm not solvent. And there are strategies, I think, to perform that in a defensible way.
00:23:43.414 - 00:23:56.014, Speaker D: So far, the best ideas I'm aware of do require some kind of outside audit also to make sure that sort of look over your shoulder while you're summing all the assets and liabilities. But let's go to your point.
00:23:58.394 - 00:23:58.850, Speaker A: About.
00:23:58.922 - 00:24:23.100, Speaker D: Attribution and the tagging that you guys have done, because this is one of. I think one of the really groundbreaking things that Nansen did was, even if you can't tell, first of all, you've got a lot of attribution in your database of who addresses may or may not belong to, like you said, for exchanges. But one of my favorite things, and I think most people's favorite things about Nansen, and I'm a user of Nansen, is the probabilistic tagging.
00:24:23.132 - 00:24:23.252, Speaker A: Right.
00:24:23.268 - 00:24:33.876, Speaker D: So even if you don't. I was just looking up an address. Whalealert had tweeted an address that moved a lot of ether today, right. And said, you know, let's go plug it into Nansen and see what they've got on it.
00:24:33.900 - 00:24:34.084, Speaker C: Right.
00:24:34.124 - 00:24:51.074, Speaker D: And this is pretty clear. He called him an ETH whale, an EI 15, EIP 1559 user. And even just that, right. It's not much. And this is an address that. This is part of a transaction series that all they do is just send in and then send out and then send in.
00:24:51.114 - 00:24:52.106, Speaker A: So there's not a lot of activity.
00:24:52.130 - 00:24:58.970, Speaker D: On this one address. But I've also seen things like medium sized Dex trader or NFT collector.
00:24:59.002 - 00:24:59.146, Speaker C: Right.
00:24:59.170 - 00:25:16.864, Speaker D: And it's just these simple, sort of human readable things that you guys add based on the on chain activity of an address, even if you don't know who it is, that can give a really great idea. I'd love to. Like, you know, maybe the challenges behind that or the thought process. How do you come up with this pretty simple but powerful idea?
00:25:17.204 - 00:26:21.462, Speaker C: Yeah. Our mission is to surface the signal and create winners in the future of finance. And the example you just gave with, you know, having labels that are human readable is very much part of that, because when we started, Nelson, we saw those same alerts, 100 million tether going from ABC to 123. But everyone always wondered, is this significant? Should we care about this? Is this someone sending these funds into an exchange to buy tokens or bitcoin or whatnot? Or is it someone redeeming what's actually going on here? The attribution or labeling of addresses was probably the. That's actually the kind of founding piece of technological insight that we had, that this is something the market wants, and it's something that can be very valuable, and it's also not easy to do at scale. So, you know, my background is in data science and AI. My two co founders are data engineers and software engineers.
00:26:21.462 - 00:27:00.742, Speaker C: So this is something we felt that we had a unique shot at doing well. And so right now we have 250 million addresses labeled up. You can think of them as being labeled in two different ways. You mentioned some examples of behavioral tags. So these are tags that are algorithms we'll just apply, and it helps you in a very quick way. Just understand what this wallet is. Instead of having to scan through tens or hundreds of thousands of transactions on something like Etherscan, you just get a quick label that says, this is a epic NFT collector, or this is a elite Dex trader.
00:27:00.742 - 00:27:54.840, Speaker C: And that can often just help you. Yeah, elite is like the highest tier of Dex traders, or smart money is probably the most popular behavioral tag, which has to do with how successful this wallet is. So did it trade with sizeable profit? Did it do any yield farming that generated a lot of returns on their capital and so on? So those are behavioral labels. But we also do, as we kind of just discussed with exchanges, we also do entity tagging. So the other part of this is very often you want to know who an address belongs to. And so that's where you have entities. And of course, exchanges are the main category of entities because they control a massive portion of, or they custody a massive portion of all crypto assets.
00:27:54.840 - 00:28:42.224, Speaker C: But you also have other entities like funds. You have entities like actually smart contract platforms like compound and Aave could be examples of what we consider entities as well. You have even influencers, people who talk about NFTs and stuff on Twitter and have been public about their wallets. So, yeah, these are the two main categories. And of course, the methods that you would use to label or to do attribution for the two categories are a little bit different. For exchanges, you would make heavy use of algorithms because you have to study how the exchange manages their own customer deposit wallets. And then you create algorithms that have high precision and high recall on those.
00:28:42.224 - 00:29:21.634, Speaker C: And then for something like funds, you have to do a lot more manual work. So you have to literally read press releases of fundraising rounds and then play kind of a game of sudoku or elimination on this address, participated in these four fundraising rounds, and that means it's probably multicoin or three arrows or whatever. So, yeah, there's no silver bullet here. You have to make use of a lot of different techniques. But the cool thing is that these different techniques then can power up each other because the more labels you have, the easier it gets to label the next wallet. Right. So there's a very interesting compounding network effect there.
00:29:22.694 - 00:29:51.034, Speaker D: Yeah, fascinating. I'm looking right now at the smart money dashboard and there's literally just a live feed of Dex transactions that various smart money tagged entities are doing. Somebody, you know, buying, swapping 60,000 USDC for Dai. That's a labeled address. I won't name the label on it, but it's a, it's a person. But then, you know, a smart Dex trader doing a trade, buying some token I've never heard of. I'm not sure.
00:29:51.034 - 00:30:08.882, Speaker D: So. And it's a live feed, by the way. There's also other features, by the way, but that's the, that's when you just go in there. No, really interesting stuff. Let's, let's go back to, you mentioned a lender that you had watched in Singapore. We don't have to name it the lender or whatever, but they had put money in anchor and this ultimately had been a red flag for you guys.
00:30:08.938 - 00:30:09.106, Speaker C: Right.
00:30:09.130 - 00:30:45.830, Speaker D: Which was the incentive incentivized yield pool on Terra USD that ultimately sort of led to the collapse of Luna and Terra. Similarly, you guys were following a lot of FTX related stuff. I mean, what kind of regular, I'm sure you were when this thing started happening? I think everyone in this space that does analytics or research or investing was like, let's immediately go to all the tools we've got and see what we can figure out is happening. What did you guys find at Nansen when you, when you know, at any point during the sort of FTX blow up?
00:30:46.022 - 00:31:35.704, Speaker C: Yeah, there were, there's always two things you can. Two perspectives. That one is the real time perspective, like what's happening right now. And then there's the after the fact kind of historical analysis where you have more time to dig into stuff. So for the real time perspective, the main thing people were looking at with Nunsen was the exchange flows. So when people started withdrawing from FTX, those dashboards blew up because people were monitoring how much money is flowing out of FTX, and many journalists started using those dashboards. They started dming us what's happening? Can you comment on this? Then, of course, the next thing is they started monitoring what was happening with other exchanges, which is what led to the kind of proof of reserves and proof of liabilities wave afterwards.
00:31:35.704 - 00:32:33.220, Speaker C: And for literally, I think literally weeks, maybe months after FTX. I mean, now it's only two, three months after, but the whole period, almost since FTX, we've been getting journalists talking about, for example, binance exchange flows. They're like, is binance going to collapse? And it's interesting because the data can also be used to. They can be used to help you move fast, but they can also be used to maybe calm your nerves a little bit. So an example of that was with Binance when I was on Bloomberg, and they were asking if binance was the next FTX. And the data suggested that it was a completely different situation because binance, through their proof of reserves, again, with all the caveats that come with that, had shown that they had more than $60 billion of assets. And if someone withdraws three, $4 billion, that's a lot of money, but it doesn't really move the needle for them.
00:32:33.220 - 00:33:11.884, Speaker C: It's not going to break anything. A lot of people are looking at exchange flows. A few other interesting things that happened around FTX was that when they halted the withdrawals, you could still see some withdrawals. And I actually tweeted to SPF about that because I was like, what's going on here? And it turned out to be these Bahamas KYC accounts that could withdraw funds. So this was also something that I think people picked up from the blockchain, that they didn't fully halt the withdrawals. There's something else going on. And then they had to comment on that.
00:33:11.884 - 00:33:55.546, Speaker C: There were also, I think, two hacks, one white hat hack and another black hat hack, which you could see in the exchange flows dashboards, and you could see who has been withdrawing, too. It's not just the total volume, but you can actually drill down and see who are the top withdrawers in the last 24 hours or 1 hour from FTX. And that's where it became a lot easier to monitor that. So a lot of that stuff was going on very quickly in real time with our dashboards. People were using that. There's another perspective, too, though, which is kind of the. Maybe before the fact, and so looking for signs of bad things before, you know, shit hits the fan.
00:33:55.546 - 00:34:46.128, Speaker C: And so an example of that might be the somewhat strange relationship between Alameda and FTX, where there was a lot of commingling of funds. We saw massive transfers of FTT from Alameda to FTX, which I think, in hindsight, we've learned was effectively Alameda collateralizing loans. So FTX lending out customer funds to Alameda and then Alameda collateralizing that with Mickey Mouse tokens, aka FTT. Right. And then FTT collapsing, we know what happened. So there's these different perspectives that you can have. We also have a protocol, smart alerts, where you get literally notifications pushed to your telegram or slack or discord.
00:34:46.128 - 00:35:36.974, Speaker C: And there are many examples where customers have told us that because they received alerts on, for example, with UST people pulling funds out of the curve, liquidity pools, they were able to move fast and withdraw their own funds before the whole DPEG happened. So anyway, so that's like the before and during. And then on the historical analysis, there's a long research piece that we wrote on this, which people can probably Google if they want to. You could just Google for announcement FTX collapse. And there's a kind of 20 minutes read on what happened. But it looks into a lot of these aspects too, and how there was a relationship between Alameda and FTX on FTT and. Yeah, many, many other points actually that people can check out there.
00:35:37.094 - 00:36:08.724, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, it's a great piece. I've read it, and I think there were some really clear takeaways that I had on FTX. One was very simple, was not commingling proprietary and customer assets, or they claimed, Sam and his blogs has claimed that they didn't commingle it, they just borrowed more than they should have from it. I think one thing that people noticed, I think with FTX was really a difficulty in locating FTX's cold wallets.
00:36:08.884 - 00:36:49.594, Speaker C: Exactly. Yeah, that is a great point. I mean, that was something I was going to mention, actually, that we struggled quite a bit finding FTX's assets. And people would frequently message us and say, hey, why does FTX has so few stablecoins or ETH compared to, say, coinbase and binance? And we kind of always just thought maybe we're missing something. But actually, in hindsight, that was kind of a red flag. And if this transparency push had happened earlier, SPF would have been forced to maybe keep better, first of all, manage these assets better, but also be more transparent about it. Right.
00:36:49.594 - 00:36:51.934, Speaker C: So, yeah, I think absolutely. That's a great point.
00:36:52.354 - 00:37:00.730, Speaker D: Yeah. It could have proof of assets of some kind, leaving the. Just even a narrow one. Right. Even better if you prove you own the addresses.
00:37:00.762 - 00:37:00.930, Speaker A: Sure.
00:37:00.962 - 00:37:15.600, Speaker D: But, okay. A proof of assets at very least would have deterred this type of behavior because FTX would have never been able to pass a simple proof of assets, you know, attestation or whatever we want to call it, because I don't think they had them. They had the assets.
00:37:15.712 - 00:37:22.124, Speaker C: Exactly. They were lent out to Alameda and paid to politicians and media, corporations and whatnot.
00:37:22.904 - 00:37:47.110, Speaker D: You guys had really great, there was great tagging and labeling on Alameda addresses. And you can see some of the crazy stuff. And we know a lot of their addresses now. They've come out in one way or another. But I encourage folks, if they have, it's Nansen AI, to go and look up some of those Alameda addresses and see the kind of wild stuff they were doing. Really risky trading in Defi.
00:37:47.142 - 00:38:44.670, Speaker C: And also. Oh, yeah, I mean, so I was interviewed recently on this documentary that's being made about FTX, and one thing we talked about was how Alameda was kind of known as this industrialized yield farmer in Defi summer. So that was almost part of the game that when you looked at a new yield farm, you would check if Alameda was in it. And if they were in it, you figured that's probably decent risk reward ratio. So, yeah, we'd been tracking them since 2020 at least. And they were a great source of alpha in many cases. I mean, if you had the risk appetite to do some of the stuff they were doing, and it was, it'll be, I mean, the cool thing about the blockchain is that you have this immutable history now of that wallet's activity.
00:38:44.670 - 00:39:03.398, Speaker C: And, like, you could probably write a book about one of those addresses alone. Right. All the crazy stuff they were doing. So I kind of like that aspect of blockchain analytics that you have this kind of glacial, immutable history that is the source of lore for the future generations as well.
00:39:03.446 - 00:39:03.654, Speaker A: Right.
00:39:03.694 - 00:39:05.282, Speaker C: It's kind of interesting to think, think about.
00:39:05.418 - 00:39:37.010, Speaker D: Yeah. From a financial analysis standpoint, financial history. Absolutely. It is sort of like a digital stone tablet that you can look into. Before we wrap, let's go on that a little bit. You've talked a little bit about why you're been interested in what Nansen's sort of first goals were with building this attribution and making things human readable. What are you looking forward to now? Whether, and I feel to what extent, here's a way of asking it, extent.
00:39:37.010 - 00:39:52.162, Speaker D: Is Nansens future tied to a crypto native future, or do you think well be getting more of a traditional finance future onto blockchains or some combination of both? And what role do you envision Nansen playing? Sort of regardless how that plays out?
00:39:52.338 - 00:40:37.654, Speaker C: Yeah, I think all of last year shows that crypto as an industry will not succeed unless we have transparency. And I think Dunstan plays a incredibly important role in creating that transparency for investors, operators, potentially regulators, and so on in the future, although that's not really a kind of customer segment we focus on. Right now we are very focused on crypto natives. And so going forward, one big shift that's happening. Actually there are maybe two big shifts I can talk about. The first one is that we're going from being a single product company to a multi product company. And the examples I would mention here, there are basically four areas.
00:40:37.654 - 00:41:34.134, Speaker C: Analytics is where we started. That's kind of our bread and butter, but we've moved into portfolio tracking that I talked about with the exchange reserves as well, which is quite adjacent to analytics. We are also now doing more research. So we have a research portal which is gaining a lot of popularity. Then in a couple of weeks we're going to announce nonsense query, which is basically a programmatic way for teams and enterprises and institutions to access blockchain data, the best blockchain data in the market. That's a big shift for us, going from being one product to a multi product. And eventually the vision is to create the information super app of web3, if you will, a little bit similar to how something like Bloomberg is the information super app of traditional finance.
00:41:34.134 - 00:42:13.886, Speaker C: And then the other shift that we've been seeing organically, I mean organic, but also something we've been working hard to achieve, is that our customer base has grown a lot on the b two b side. So we have more institutions using our product. Back in 2020, when we started Nunsun, it was used mostly by individual sophisticated retail investors. Now more than 60% of our revenues come from institutions and teams and enterprises. So that's a big shift as well. I don't think we like. We want to do both b two c and b two b.
00:42:13.886 - 00:42:48.064, Speaker C: We want to serve both retail investors and institutions and teams. We strongly believe that if you want to be the category leader for information, you have to serve both b, two c and b two b, because that's just how, that's the nature of crypto. It's always going to be retail driven. So you can't avoid retail. You have to serve them really, really well. They're at the frontier. And so over time, what I hope to see is, so first of all, this year we're just going to improve our product significantly.
00:42:48.064 - 00:43:54.104, Speaker C: Even things like the latency of our dashboards, like how fast they load, is literally going to improve by 100 x with this new update we're making in the next few months, which is going to be incredible. We are going to improve the user experience a lot on many different fronts. We're going to allow for more configuration and personalization in the product so that you can add your own custom wallet labels, you can customize the dashboards to a larger extent. And we're going to add more teams functionality to the product. So there's a lot of really, really cool things coming that I'm personally excited about as a user of nonsense. I literally use nonsense every single day, even this year. But beyond that, I think that if we look into, say, 2030 or 2035, I truly believe in a future where blockchains are the financial fabric of the world and where, say, more than a billion people own digital assets in various different forms.
00:43:54.104 - 00:44:39.704, Speaker C: That could be not just owning dogecoin or bitcoin or whatever, but also owning a piece of real estate or owning a fraction of a song, the royalty rights and so on. And in that future, you need to have, like, first of all, that future doesn't happen unless you have transparency. But when we are in that future, people would expect to have more information available. And so hopefully what we can do in the first phase of nonsense is just to make sure that the industry succeeds by supporting the pioneers and making sure that they become winners and we can build this future of finance. And then in the second phase, I hope that nonsense can expand more to serve a much wider range of users. So, yeah, that's in a nutshell how I see the future for Nansen.
