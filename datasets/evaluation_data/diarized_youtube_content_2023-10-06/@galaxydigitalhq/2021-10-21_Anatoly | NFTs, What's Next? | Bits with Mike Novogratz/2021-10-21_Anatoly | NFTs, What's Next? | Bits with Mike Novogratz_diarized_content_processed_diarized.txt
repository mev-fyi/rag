00:00:01.160 - 00:00:29.884, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. I'm Mike Novogratz, and this is next with Novo. So nfts, in some ways, from where I sit, nfts kicked off this mania for level ones, right? Because it's kind of the first thing that people could understand. Wait, this is going to live on a blockchain? Oh, I get it. So the blockchain isn't just for buying and selling coins. It can be art. It can be ip, it can be.
00:00:29.884 - 00:00:31.744, Speaker A: And so it kind of snapped.
00:00:33.204 - 00:01:09.696, Speaker B: We built this kind of WordPress style open source, take the code and launch an NFT project thing called Metaplex. We incubated. It's now like a separate company, and I'm seeing about 10,000 new accounts, like, added an hour. Basically, there's just nfts. $700 million worth of nfts now minted on Solana with, like, 70 million in volumes in a week. And these are just people trading, basically, images, memes, culture. Right? Like, and there's no way I could have predicted this.
00:01:09.696 - 00:01:50.914, Speaker B: Like, it's just like one of those things. Like, how can you predict that this would be a business model or, like, a thing that's insane, that would be worth money? Um, and I think it comes. I think what I am seeing, at least what I'm trying, what I believe I'm recognizing, is kind of the. The birth of social networking on chain, like, real grassroots, you know, crypto based social networks. Because once people buy into one of these things and they become part of the, like, you know, they set it as their profile. It doesn't matter where they actually communicate. Is it on discord? Is it on Twitter? Is it on telegram? But you're kind of part of the monkey dao.
00:01:50.994 - 00:01:52.522, Speaker A: That's no, trust me.
00:01:52.578 - 00:01:53.034, Speaker B: Right?
00:01:53.154 - 00:02:06.530, Speaker A: I am. So, because I haven't picked my avatar yet, I'm sitting here completely paranoid. Like, I'm frozen to decide which one it's going to be. I might create my own monkey.
00:02:06.562 - 00:02:53.040, Speaker B: Mbs, man. Everyone's part of the monkey dow. I guess so. That I feel like, will it scale to 10 million people in one of these? I don't know, but it's might, right? It's possible. Or maybe these are, like, bulletin boards in the early nineties where these communities are small, but they can't really grow to that 3 billion Facebook level of a network. But our goal as a layer one, I'm just here to unblock people. How do we make this thing as cheap and as fast as possible? How do we make sure that there's 90 million accounts in Solana right now, if they're adding 10,000 an hour, how do we make sure it can go to a billion and then 10 billion, right, like that.
00:02:53.040 - 00:02:58.144, Speaker B: That's. That's an engineer's job, right? That's what we're, you know, trained to do, basically.
