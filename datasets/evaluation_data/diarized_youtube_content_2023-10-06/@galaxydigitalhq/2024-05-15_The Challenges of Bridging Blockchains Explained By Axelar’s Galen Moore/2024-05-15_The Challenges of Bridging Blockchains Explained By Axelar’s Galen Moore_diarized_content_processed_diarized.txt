00:00:10.480 - 00:00:26.794, Speaker A: Welcome back to the infinite jungle. On today's show, I have Galen Moore, global Communications lead at Interop Labs, a development team working on Axlr, a web3 interoperability protocol, aka Bridging. Galen, welcome to the show.
00:00:27.524 - 00:00:29.184, Speaker B: Thanks, Christine. Great to be here.
00:00:29.684 - 00:00:36.388, Speaker A: Fun fact for listeners who may not know, Galen and I have worked together in the past. He used to be my boss at Coindesk.
00:00:36.516 - 00:00:39.304, Speaker B: Ancient history, so long ago.
00:00:39.964 - 00:01:19.352, Speaker A: I know time really, time moves differently in crypto, and it does feel like over a decade ago, but here we are again. I am very excited to talk with you about Axelar and learn more about how bridging, how interoperability works between blockchains. So first and foremost for our listeners and for me, primarily for me, can you explain how exactly Axelar, the core bridging protocol of Axelar, works? I know Axelar has many different interoperability projects and products, but how does at its core axlr function?
00:01:19.488 - 00:02:21.720, Speaker B: Sure. Simply put, XLR is a blockchain that connects blockchains. So there is a dynamic validator set running proof of stake. Messages are picked up by that validator set on a source chain, verified and then passed to a destination chain. So those messages might include, most people think of bridging, it might include a message to verify that a deposit has taken place on a source chain and authorized issuance of a wrapped asset in an equivalent amount on a destination chain. So this is the way, for example, USDC often travels between chains. And that can happen either with sort of a lock and mint type of approach, where the asset is locked on the source chain in a smart contract and then minted on the destination chain, or it can happen in a burn and mint kind of approach, where the asset is actually burned and destroyed on the destination chain and an equivalent amount is minted.
00:02:21.720 - 00:02:26.524, Speaker B: Sorry, burned and destroyed on the source chain, and an equivalent amount is minted on the destination chain.
00:02:26.864 - 00:02:32.524, Speaker A: And which version is Axelar? So Axelar is burnt or the lock in the mint?
00:02:32.824 - 00:03:09.090, Speaker B: Axelar powers both. Yeah, 100%. There are applications using both approaches on AxlR. So then to sort of think of that as the most basic and familiar use of a cross chain or interoperability protocol. On top of that, interoperability networks like Axelr provide the ability to pass arbitrary messages as well. So you might have heard the phrase arbitrary messaging network or arbitrary messaging protocol. We use the term general message passing.
00:03:09.090 - 00:03:47.310, Speaker B: What that means is that when you bridge that asset, or when you verify that that asset is locked in a contract on a source chain, you can also send, along with that some instructions. So you could say, issue a wrapped asset in this amount and swap it for this other asset on this dex, and then send back the asset to the address that initiated the transaction. So in that case, instead of getting a wrapped asset, you're sort of moving an asset cross chain, initiating a swap, and then getting the result of that swap, the token that you swapped for.
00:03:47.422 - 00:04:27.914, Speaker A: I have some questions, though. So can anybody on Axelar create and make the validators of Axelar basically confirm? I want to be able to move this asset from Ethereum to Solana, and I want it to be a burn and mint style, and I want to have these rules around it. Is Axelar a perfect missionless protocol that can support that kind of programmatic behavior between chains? What if the validators are not running like, Ethereum and Solana nodes? Like, how does Axelart allow for the cross messaging in a permissionless way?
00:04:28.494 - 00:05:07.184, Speaker B: Okay, all right, let me just take that one piece at a time. So, first of all, let's just think of two arbitrary chains. Can any application developer come in and apply any kind of logic that they want? Maybe it's a swap. Like, they're sort of doing a cross chain swap and automating each of the steps of that, converting gas tokens on the backend so that the user doesn't have to go acquire the gas token of whatever chain. Maybe it's game logic. Maybe you want a game that involves Ethereum NFts, but you don't want to run the game logic on Ethereum because it's too expensive. You want to run the game logic on polygon or a cheaper chain.
00:05:07.184 - 00:05:52.254, Speaker B: So in that case, very similar. You can sort of apply any combination of chains and logic as you might desire. You might be another gaming example. You might be using NFT or issued on one chain as an access token for a game, or even for a DeFi application. We have application level projects in the ecosystem that are doing KYC tokens for institutional finance. For example, to participate in DeFi, you get your KYC token on one chain, and then you don't have to, like, do that on five different chains. You can use that to gain admission to Defi services on multiple chains now that you know, the system knows who you are type of thing.
00:05:52.254 - 00:07:00.564, Speaker B: So just examples of use cases, but yes, you can apply sort of any kind of logic. Now, the second part of the question, as I read it, is, how do you sort of connect different chains? How do you connect new chains? Currently, XLR connects 64 different blockchains, all Cosmos and EVM blockchains we have just rolled out to Devnet a product called Interchain amplifier, which makes it easy and permissionless to connect new blockchains. Basically, you can think of it like in the past, if you wanted to connect a new blockchain, a new form of consensus, like Solana, to the AxLR network, you would have to be a protocol developer. You would have to do that at the protocol layer. What interchain amplifier does is it enables smart contract developers to instantiate those connections and set up a connection to any form of consensus. Really? In the first cohort that are working with interchange amplifier on Devnet just announced this week, we have stacks, the bitcoin, l two. We have Hedera, which is a directed acyclic graph.
00:07:00.564 - 00:07:01.904, Speaker B: It's not even a blockchain.
00:07:02.804 - 00:07:03.624, Speaker A: Okay.
00:07:04.004 - 00:07:25.388, Speaker B: Yeah, Hedera's out there. I actually really love this stuff. So we have stacks, Hedera, we have a project called ironfish that's doing a proof of work. Zero knowledge. It's got its own proof of work. Consensus algorithm, its own miners. Right? How cool is this? And it's doing like a $0.
00:07:25.388 - 00:07:33.796, Speaker B: It's like a privacy as a service type of chain. You can route your transaction through iron fish, and it keeps the details of the transaction hidden.
00:07:33.900 - 00:07:37.396, Speaker A: Wow, you're really getting out there with some of these chains. That's pretty cool.
00:07:37.460 - 00:07:53.840, Speaker B: That's nice example. You can take any kind of weird ass consensus algorithm and plug it into Axelar. So then your question, how did the val. Oh, and the other one, by the way, is Moonriver, which is a Polkadot ecosystem chain. So that's another.
00:07:53.952 - 00:07:57.164, Speaker A: I've never heard of moonriver. Iron fish.
00:07:57.664 - 00:08:05.792, Speaker B: Moon river is legit. They're on Kusama, which is like polkadot's kind of experimental wing.
00:08:05.848 - 00:08:07.056, Speaker A: Yeah, it's testnet.
00:08:07.200 - 00:08:08.984, Speaker B: Yeah, testnet, exactly.
00:08:09.104 - 00:08:11.304, Speaker A: But it has tokens that are worth that, right?
00:08:11.344 - 00:08:12.624, Speaker B: It kind of has its own ecosystem.
00:08:12.664 - 00:08:13.024, Speaker A: Strange.
00:08:13.104 - 00:08:14.024, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah.
00:08:14.144 - 00:08:15.344, Speaker A: I mean, it's weird.
00:08:15.464 - 00:08:23.384, Speaker B: Yeah. You know, it's a wild world anyways. It's an unlimited jungle.
00:08:24.124 - 00:08:25.344, Speaker A: Yes, exactly.
00:08:25.924 - 00:08:51.658, Speaker B: So how do you then spin up validators? Let's say you want to connect brand new chain nobody's ever heard of. How do you set up validators who will monitor events on that chain and transmit them to the network? How do you incentivize them? Up until now, the 64 chains, especially IBC chains, is a whole other category. Cosmos chains. Right. It's all connected. You don't have to worry about this stuff. But when it comes to externally verified chains, like EVM, chains.
00:08:51.658 - 00:10:11.914, Speaker B: Yeah, you got to run a node and it costs money. So up until now, the Axelr protocol incentivizes the addition of new chains with additional rewards, inflationary rewards. The rate of inflation has been reduced to accommodate this kind of expansive growth in chains without huge growth in inflation of Axl, the staking token. But there's a limit to that. And we do envision a world with thousands of blockchains, which is not, I think, that far fetched these days. When you look at Celestia, Eigen layer and other projects that are in the modular ecosystem, how do you connect thousands of new blockchains? In addition, let's not forget institutional clients, customers that want to have their own private chain, et cetera, layer threes on top of L2, ecosystems and ethereum. How do you connect those blockchains without diluting the hell out of Axl? The answer is, at least with interchange amplifier, you get your group of validators and you incentivize them with a pool of axl to start and sort of bootstrap the validator pool and incentives there with a pool of axl to reward them.
00:10:11.914 - 00:10:41.684, Speaker B: And in addition to that, you can go from there by. I think some networks would probably be able to incentivize validators with fees alone. If you have some protocols that are connecting, would be able to do that, if not, need to take other paths. But bottom line, I think the set of existing validators needs to approve a new connection. There needs to be an on chain vote. But some of the economics of that, how that works is spelled out in the interchange amplifier path.
00:10:42.144 - 00:11:28.236, Speaker A: So the validator set of Axelar is not homogeneous in that they're not all running all of the nodes. They're divided into these groups that you can rent out. And as a user, I suppose that as a user of XLR trying to bridge assets over or trying to pass different messages around, as a user, you may just use the communication channels or the bridges that are already set up, but as a protocol or maybe somebody with a larger treasury or more money, basically you buy Axelar, create a pool of Axelr that you can incentivize validators and kind of get them to go on board. Is this how this is going?
00:11:28.260 - 00:12:36.018, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right. And I mean, if you look at AxLR's validator set, it is the largest of any cross chain network, 75 validators currently active in the set. We do not require each validator to cover all chains, but we do incentivize validators for covering additional chains. So it creates some interesting economics when you think about the biggest validators are going to be, and we have some of the biggest validating on AxLR names you would certainly recognize. And by the way, all of this is visible at Axelrscan. IO is our block explorer, the validators page. There has details on all the validators in the active set, but you could certainly envision a kind of a problem that Ethereum itself is facing now, I think with concentration of stake, where you have the validators that are able to connect the most chains with the most resources that can connect the most chains, they're getting the greatest rewards, they're able to offer the best return to stakers.
00:12:36.018 - 00:13:25.034, Speaker B: So they're going to sort of a winner take all type of dynamic there. That's something that I think folks in the AXLR ecosystem have been aware of for a long time, which is why quadratic voting was implemented last year. So on Axelar, each validator, and I think Ethereum nerds out there will love this, each validator has a vote, which is the square root of its stake. So if you have one unit of stake, you have one vote. If you have, if you want to have two votes, you need four units of stake. If you want to have three votes, you need nine units of stake, and so on. So in that way, it creates a much higher threshold for any kind of like concentration of voting power that could lead to a sort of a scenario of possible collusion.
00:13:25.734 - 00:13:33.294, Speaker A: But how do you know that a validator is not owned by the same node operator? How would you make that civil resistant?
00:13:33.414 - 00:14:05.090, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think one of the reasons why this works is because it's not proof of stake like axlr uses, but it's delegated proof of stake. I use the word proof of stake as an umbrella term. People are very familiar with it. Within proof of stake, there are different flavors. And what Axelar employs is it's tendermint consensus. It's a delegated proof of stake. So the validators are, for the most part, known entities that are operating not just on Axelr, but are operating validators on multiple proof of stake chains.
00:14:05.090 - 00:14:44.824, Speaker B: So there's an element of reputational guarantee and knowledge about what the entity is. It's not one entity that you're trusting, it's a distributed group of entities. But there is an element of dissimilar to ethereum where, yes, you might have a sort of a, anybody could be running the validator. If I understand it correctly, in this case, there's a sort of whether the validator is sort of doxxed or not, there's a kind of an on chain identifiable entity that's running something here and with some reputation and presumably some revenue at risk.
00:14:45.644 - 00:15:54.240, Speaker A: Yes, yes. I think that on Ethereum there's quite a big push to try and make sure that it's not only known entities that are validating on Ethereum, entities, individuals and solo stakers to encourage the censorship, resistance and permissionlessness of Ethereum. However, that really is not, it's not really working out for Ethereum right now. There's lots of problems with that. One other question that I wanted to ask about how Axelr works before we get into just broader topics on the future of interoperability protocols, is you said that we incentivize these validators to run more obviously run more secure, more chains, and presumably that means changing, of course, like you said, issuance and monetary policy and finagling with these kinds of incentives. Who is we here? Obviously, interop Labs is a development team. Curious to know, is there some kind of a dow or some kind of a foundation? How do those decisions get made? Who makes those decisions?
00:15:54.312 - 00:16:45.054, Speaker B: Very good question. So we in that sense is a pretty colloquial use of we, I think you could say we is the axilar ecosystem. All of the parameters that we've been talking about are subject to on chain vote. So there is, the AXLR foundation does exist, and axilar foundation does delegate stakeholders, so does have some. As time goes on and Axl supply is further and further distributed. And these distribution tokenomics are detailed in an early blog post by the foundation. As Axl gets distributed, that concentration of stake with the foundation decreases.
00:16:45.054 - 00:17:45.624, Speaker B: So I think decentralization is a path. The way that we think about it in interrupt labs is that we've built technology that enables decentralization and we've continued to improve it in ways that ensure that the network continues to move toward decentralization. And I think this is very similar to the kind of calculus you'd apply in Ethereum, where you'd want to not say, well, is Ethereum perfectly decentralized today? Debatable. What you really want to be debating is, is it moving toward decentralization, or is it moving the other way? Is stake decentralizing? Is it becoming more distributed and diverse, or is it centralizing, becoming more concentrated and homogenous? Because we know that in these security models, concentration and homogeneity of stake is a very bad signal.
00:17:46.204 - 00:18:13.214, Speaker A: To be clear, though, Ethereum foundation, with the balance of eth that it had, which back during the ICO days when Ethereum first launched was very large. They don't stake Ethereum foundation, I don't believe stakes a large percentage of eth. To be clear. Does the axilar foundation stake the delegates, token delegates to validators? Yeah, I see. And it does then get yield from that staking?
00:18:14.274 - 00:18:15.414, Speaker B: Yeah, I believe so.
00:18:15.914 - 00:18:16.814, Speaker A: Okay.
00:18:17.194 - 00:18:20.010, Speaker B: I'm not privy to the books, but I believe that's accurate.
00:18:20.082 - 00:18:44.528, Speaker A: But as you can see, that's a little bit of a concern. If you have a large balance of a staking token that you stake, you will presumably just earn more stake as you stake. You know, that could get a little fishy. It could get a little concerning. But I mean, I understand that maybe you unstake and then you put it back into the ecosystem. I hear you, though.
00:18:44.616 - 00:19:16.824, Speaker B: Yeah. There is sort of like a roadmap, if you will, for distributing stake right. To where it's no longer in the hands of the foundation. I think certainly, as you said, early days, you sort of have that concentration of stake. Those questions are very legitimate. I think the answer that we can provide to those questions is it's all on chain, baby. You can see and hold us to account, honestly hold the network to account, and that doesn't answer all questions.
00:19:16.824 - 00:19:33.654, Speaker B: But I think at least is the beginning of an answer, I would hope at least the beginning of a solution to a problem that we certainly take seriously at interrupt labs and at Axlar foundation when it comes to pursuing that decentralized security model.
00:19:34.234 - 00:19:40.734, Speaker A: Yeah. And decentralization really is a spectrum. It's not like a black and white. You are decentralized or you are not.
00:19:41.354 - 00:20:00.234, Speaker B: That's true. But it's also like, can it be decentralized? Are you becoming more decentralized? I think those are the right questions to ask. And I would, I would say there are protocols across the board that, you know, that haven't really put those pieces in place.
00:20:01.334 - 00:21:11.986, Speaker A: Fair. That's fair. There's actually quite a few in this space. However, I will say on the topic of decentralization, and on the topic of kind of moving towards that future, I see inherent limits, Galen, of how decentralized interoperability protocols can be if you're not, if you don't have some kind of standard SDK kit that creates a blueprint for how your protocol should be built. So Cosmos is a great example where I see interoperability working at scale. And obviously blockchains like Polkadot and other kind of more, maybe even avalanche, but blockchains that kind of look at the vision of multiple chains, but all within an ecosystem of standardized protocol development, I can see how interoperability works. But when it comes to Ethereum and when it comes to other modularity blockchains that really only define one layer of the modular blockchain stack, I feel like the interoperability between all those layers can get quite out of hand quite quickly.
00:21:11.986 - 00:21:53.534, Speaker A: And the only type of interoperability protocol that will really facilitate communication across them all is something like an exchange, like a centralized solution, where you can look at these different types of technologies being built and then create custom solutions based off of that. What are your thoughts on the future of what interoperability looks like when this space is just, the technology in the space is changing so rapidly and we're not operating under a centralized system of, like, here's the standard for making blockchains communicate with each other. There is no standard. And in that sense, how does, how does an axilar look at the future of how this all plays out?
00:21:53.694 - 00:22:30.408, Speaker B: Yeah, great stuff. I mean, first of all, let me just say that I think that centralized exchanges have come up with some of the greatest innovations in this space. I'm not a total defi maxi who hates on all centralized exchanges, you've got to look at Bitmex, for example. The perp swap itself is just a cool, innovative, crazy product, but also a derivatives exchange that offers 100 x margin and lets randos interact directly with the order book and doesnt except for maybe once or twice. Break. Thats incredible. That is an incredible financial innovation.
00:22:30.408 - 00:22:37.480, Speaker B: Everyone in Chicago should be taking notes. Definitely. Everyone in London should be taking notes.
00:22:37.592 - 00:22:38.844, Speaker A: Pop off Galen.
00:22:42.204 - 00:23:02.212, Speaker B: But that said, I mean, like, why are we here? You know, I think I'm a bit of, look, I'm a bit of a bitcoiner. I think you notice. And, and it's frustrating that, like, if I want to do something with my bitcoin, like what are my options? Like where, how am I going to deposit my bitcoin and earn, you know, take out a loan, you know, for example, or earn some interest?
00:23:02.268 - 00:23:03.620, Speaker A: The Babylon chain.
00:23:03.812 - 00:23:25.304, Speaker B: Yeah, you know, there are options, right? It's, it's, you know, it's starting to happen. But like, for a long time, I wanted to do anything. I'm going through, you know, whatever. I'm going through WBTC, a centralized service. I'm going through Coinbase, a centralized service. And I think, at least for me, those services are probably fine. But I don't think that's really why we're here.
00:23:25.304 - 00:23:46.872, Speaker B: I would like to be doing that in a way where I can see those transactions end to end. I don't have to rely on the word of, frankly, a venture backed startup. I'm putting my money in with a venture backed startup and I'm getting what yield. That doesn't make any sense to me now. Okay, okay. Coinbase is a public company. Fine, fine, fine.
00:23:46.872 - 00:24:17.884, Speaker B: But honestly, if I'm going to deposit my precious BTC or my precious eth, my precious axl anywhere, I want it to be in a protocol where I can see it end to end and it's open. And if something goes wrong or it's bad, it could be four. All of those principles are super important. So I think you're right to an extent. Why are centralized exchanges the on ramp? Right. Well, okay. Everybody says, okay, bad ux.
00:24:17.884 - 00:24:32.080, Speaker B: It's true. They have better ux. But it's also because I can come in with whatever asset and go out on whatever asset I want. I can do a cross chain swap. Easy. Cross chain swaps. Cross chain interoperability is not a problem.
00:24:32.080 - 00:24:40.040, Speaker B: You just put a database in the middle. AWS works great. It's fantastic. We can do this.
00:24:40.072 - 00:24:42.644, Speaker A: A lot of validators use it, right?
00:24:43.384 - 00:25:23.020, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right. But even do we want to be able to do that in a way where we can have the whole transaction on chain, end to end over decentralized infrastructure? I think a lot of people do and use cases for that kind of transaction have, are emerging, have emerged. So that's where Axelor, I think, fits in. Now, you described that world of modular blockchains, like hundreds of blockchains or whatever. Look, I mean, I think any sort of modular blockchain or l two that launches will have two things, right? It will have a, a sequencer and it will have b, a bridge, right. But if, you know, and so, so far, that's, like, worked pretty well. Okay, go over here.
00:25:23.020 - 00:25:31.724, Speaker B: Bridge. You know, we built the bridge. It's good. It's fine. Go over there to the bridge. The l two bridge that we built. Bridge your tokens over.
00:25:31.724 - 00:26:11.312, Speaker B: Bridge your eth over and play. Have fun. That's been the model. If you're talking about something where you've got ten different blockchains that are supposed to be the components of the infrastructure behind an application, I'm sorry, but that just doesn't work. You need the ability to pass to pass logic across those blockchains. Not only that, you need to be able to kind of abstract the, you need to not only abstract it for the user where, like, stuff is automated for the user, like, for example, gas conversions or whatever steps that are being taken, like you don't have the user pushing the button for each of those steps. Right.
00:26:11.312 - 00:26:48.924, Speaker B: You need to sort of, the user pushes a button and those things happen. Right. But it needs to be like that for the developer too, right? The developer has to be able to develop, can't like tune up program on ten different blockchains. User facing developer. And the best analogy, actually, Sriram from Eigen Lair said this in a podcast with Sergey, one of the co founders of Axeloc Protocol. He was on the block with Frank and he was saying, look, SaaS Shopify, for example, you take Shopify and integrate ecommerce into your website. Shopify has ten different SaaS products built into it, like rolled into it.
00:26:48.924 - 00:27:12.804, Speaker B: You don't know what those are. Building the end user facing developer, building an ecommerce website, integrating Shopify does not have any idea what the SaaS service doesn't need to know what the SaaS services are that are embedded in there. That's, I think, the next level of interoperability, where we can actually connect hundreds of blockchains in a way that's meaningful not only for users, but for developers where that's possible.
00:27:13.634 - 00:27:50.468, Speaker A: Okay, let's talk about that next level. And this will be my final question about this whole bridging future that you've described. Cause I too. I too, yes, I would like to have it be a permissionless thing. Do I think it's possible? I think it's a little bit TVD, but I see, especially in the beginning of the episode when you talked about the new feature of being able to more easily onboard chains, that's something Axelar saw. Axelar, the developer, the teams of developers saw that look, it's not sustainable for these chains to have to be voted in all the time. We have to create this.
00:27:50.468 - 00:28:47.576, Speaker A: It's not scalable, so we got to build this. So when you're looking at the future right now, even in the near term future, with the taking off of things like restaking protocols, of even sequencing being something that happens on a shared sequencing layer, a shared sequencer, the development of these types of protocols products, what are some of the additional or new products and technologies that Axelar, or you think bridges in general need looking forward? Because it doesn't seem like interoperability is something that's really going to be possible in the context of this. Clearly, there's a lot of changes that are coming onto what rollups look like, what execution layers are going to look like. Shared sequencing is one of them, restaking is another. Big one. And that's going to impact bridges. How do you guys adapt and evolve? Is there anything kind of in the horizon that you guys are looking at that will make Axelar, like, a long term, sustainable interoperability solution?
00:28:47.720 - 00:29:39.624, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. I think the biggest thing right now for us is the AXLR virtual machine, which we just went to main net a short while ago, just a few weeks ago. We haven't done a big hoopla about it, but we've communicated a fair amount about what this thing is and what it's supposed to do. And it is the sort of programmable layer that underlies products like interchain amplifier that we were just discussing giving us the ability, giving Axelr the ability to automate developer tasks. For example, like, you've got something you've done on one chain, you want to duplicate it on five other chains. This is not trivial, right? Building that. I mean, we've seen projects go down this route, right? The largest projects have built what I would call sort of a multi chain approach, right? They've built instantiations of their application.
00:29:39.624 - 00:30:42.904, Speaker B: Like, these are the projects with the most resources, instantiations of their, of their application of their protocol on multiple blockchains. It's extremely labor intensive. It's very high developer overhead. And in the end, you do end up with a kind of a, you know, a second tier experience on the, on the secondary, on the, you know, the expansion chains, if you will. If you could think of it like, you know, you run a coffee shop and you want to expand your coffee shop chain from your origin city to, you know, a dozen other cities and to another country, how are you going to make sure that the coffee tastes, you know, that the user who comes from the original store and goes to the store in a new city is going to taste the same cup of coffee and have the same experience. How are you going to have that McDonald's, Starbucks consistency of your Dapp across multiple blockchains? The answer is not, well, you're going to hire a million protocol developers. That's not the answer for anybody.
00:30:42.904 - 00:32:06.886, Speaker B: The answer is there's going to be infrastructure that will automate a lot of those tasks, automate the translation, automate the routing, and ultimately automate the plugging in of security and verification. I think that axelar virtual machine layer is something that's very exciting to us, because going back to our conversation earlier, anybody can build an SDK that automates those things. But are you going to have those functions on chain or off? Are those functions that handle those interchange steps are they going to be smart contract logic on a blockchain that anybody can see, or are they going to be in a black box or in a database that's outside of you and ultimately subject to censorship, hacking, regulation, any of those bad, scary words in terms of the roadmap of what's coming up, the products that I think will be built on top of Axel or virtual machine is what we're most excited about. Axelar virtual machine enables CoSm WASM contracts on the AXLR interchain environment. So interchain amplifier is the first interchain token service is another one. And coming up, interchain maestro, which is an orchestrator for applications, kind of a kubernetes for web3. Those are, I think, the products that we're most excited about.
00:32:06.886 - 00:32:14.514, Speaker B: So we're. Look, Christine, we're deep in the infrastructure layer. We're like super nerds. We don't talk to anybody but developers.
00:32:16.344 - 00:32:17.872, Speaker A: Well, thank you for talking to me.
00:32:17.888 - 00:32:19.164, Speaker B: I'm glad you had us on the show.
00:32:19.544 - 00:32:26.764, Speaker A: Yes, thank you. And very quickly, is there a timeline for the AVM, the AXLR virtual machine?
00:32:28.384 - 00:33:14.774, Speaker B: It's on mainnet now. It is. We deployed it on mainnet with a recent version upgrade that was voted on chain. We don't do a lot of fixed public timelines for reasons that I'm sure a lot of people can understand. But I think these are all things that we have in view for this year, and we did publish in the first part of the year. Roadmap look like what's in view for the ecosystem and what projects are working on. And I think there's a lot of exciting announcements to come, but definitely that Roadmap is a good guide to kind of some of these things we've been talking about and where you can find more details about that as well.
00:33:15.074 - 00:33:31.346, Speaker A: All right, we'll link to that in the show notes, and we'll also link to the axilar Twitter page, where I'm sure a lot of the updates will come. I gotta say, if you're listening to this podcast and you are interested in crypto, but you're not on Twitter, you're missing out. Gotta get on Twitter.
00:33:31.490 - 00:33:34.580, Speaker B: What about Farcaster? I'm like more interested in Farcaster these days.
00:33:34.682 - 00:33:36.192, Speaker A: No, stop it.
00:33:36.248 - 00:33:40.164, Speaker B: I was hard enough. Stop it. Absolutely not.
00:33:41.584 - 00:34:01.584, Speaker A: Well, it's been a pleasure chatting with you, Galen. Thank you again for coming onto the show, and thank you, everybody, for listening to another episode of Infinite Jungle. We hope you have learned something new about Ethereum, and we hope you'll join again for the next episode of Infinite Jungle. Until next time, stay safe out there, everybody.
