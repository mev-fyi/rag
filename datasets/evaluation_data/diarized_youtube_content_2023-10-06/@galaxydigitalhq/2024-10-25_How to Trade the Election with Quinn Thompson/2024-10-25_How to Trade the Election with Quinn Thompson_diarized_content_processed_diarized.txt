00:01:09.152 - 00:01:32.864, Speaker A: Is going to zero. Welcome back to Galaxy Brains as always, I'm your host Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy and we have a great episode for you today. Quinn Thompson, founder CIO of LER Capital, he's back. We're going to talk to Quinn about how he's trading the election, what his medium term outlook is. AI, bitcoin, miners, nuclear energy. Really interesting conversation with Quinn. He was last on the show in mid March of this year.
00:01:32.864 - 00:02:04.090, Speaker A: He had just launched, in fact I think he announced on show the launch of Lekker Capital, his fund. And he was bearish for a while. He's now very bullish and, and we'll talk about why, what has changed and what his thesis is. Theses are. We'll also check in with our good friend Bimnet, a BB from Galaxy Trading, as always to talk markets. And before I get to all of that, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to the disclaimer in the podcast notes.

00:02:04.090 - 00:02:24.630, Speaker A: We, we did a wrap at the top. I did a wrap at the top of the show. I think Quinn actually, interestingly I think was the first episode we did without a wrap. So we gave his episode a rap. People have been asking. I've been getting trolled and replies and comments, people miss those wraps. So I hope you enjoyed it.
00:02:24.630 - 00:02:46.002, Speaker A: And this is a really fun episode with Quinn. We really cover a lot of ground about the markets and it's to be an exciting one. Lots of maybe volatility on our on the coming up in markets and certainly on election day. We talk about that with Bimnet. Let's get right into the show. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet AB from Galaxy Trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome back to Galaxy Brains.
00:02:46.066 - 00:02:47.090, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:02:47.210 - 00:03:07.064, Speaker A: What's going on in your mind here? We're only two weeks out from the election. It seems like positioning is light. We were talking to some folks from a big bank yesterday. They said positioning is pretty light across the board. People are not looking to take very directional bets on the outcome of the election in terms of equities and traditional assets. Is that what you see?
00:03:07.232 - 00:03:34.586, Speaker B: Yeah, I think folks are preparing for an election that still has a lot of unknowns, particularly with respect to the market reaction function. The way to think about it is if I told you in 2016 that Donald Trump was gonna win the election a day in advance and you traded it that way, you probably would have lost money.
00:03:34.658 - 00:03:35.514, Speaker A: Even though he won.
00:03:35.602 - 00:03:57.586, Speaker B: Even though he won, because the market did the exact opposite of what people thought it was going to do. And so in terms of how to approach the election from a trading strategy standpoint, I think what you'd want to do is essentially be a fast follower.
00:03:57.778 - 00:03:58.802, Speaker A: Wait and see what happens.
00:03:58.866 - 00:04:24.508, Speaker B: Wait and see what happens, see what the trend is. That's a pretty popular take amongst traders, especially those that have lived through 2016. In addition, you just think about all of the unexpected election outcomes that we've had this year alone. There was the French election, Le Pen doing well, the Mexican election, and there's.
00:04:24.524 - 00:04:27.388, Speaker A: Just been a ton of popular surprises.
00:04:27.564 - 00:05:01.718, Speaker B: And so I think you have to be prepared for any outcome. The only real thing that matters for markets right now is the election. Waiting for that, waiting for that. But obviously under the hood, there's also earnings. You're in the prime of U.S. earnings season, so I think 60, 70% of S&P 500 companies report over the next week or so. And so there's definitely a focus on earnings.
00:05:01.718 - 00:06:06.978, Speaker B: But again, if corporates are going to get taxed less than a Trump administration, earnings would improve. Earnings could theoretically improve. Certain sectors might do better or worse, depending on inflation. What I do think is really notable, though, is the price action you've had in fixed income in the U.S. basically you've had a sell off north of 50 basis points on the 10 year yield point. The curve has steepened as well and you've seen a repricing of front end cut expectations to go along with that. And I think that is symptomatic of one, a US economy that's still doing ok, labor market that's still pretty tight and the realization that the fiscal spending in a Trump outcome is going to be very high or the deficits are going to be relatively high and that the policies that Trump is going to pursue at their face are inflationary.
00:06:06.978 - 00:07:07.490, Speaker B: And so if you're talking about a Fed that is still focused on the inflation side of its mandate, because by law it has to be, then you're probably looking at an administration that's going to push inflation a bit higher. How could you be cutting in that type of environment which puts the Fed in between a rock and a hard place? Because what's happened is because interest rates have been so high for so long, the interest expenses for the US have dramatically shot up every year. You're paying I believe now over a trillion dollars a year in interest. That's not sustainable. The Fed wants to cut rates because of how large the deficits are in the US but if they're really focused on the inflation side of things, they.
00:07:07.530 - 00:07:19.746, Speaker A: Can'T and technically their statutory mandate doesn't include protecting against a US debt deficit problem. Technically, well, markets, unemployment, inflation and all that.
00:07:19.818 - 00:07:24.178, Speaker B: But it's really, they're stuck between a rock and a hard place.
00:07:24.234 - 00:07:55.194, Speaker A: So they got a political administration in either case that is likely to be inflationary, whether it's from sending more money, more benefits, more social programs, or if it's tariffs, that and cutting taxes and cutting taxes which lower lower income and also increase the cost of goods and services because of the tariffs then that they have to react to. It's like a political and they don't want to be in that political situation kind of makes them like a balancing function against the federal government, which is not really where they want to be.
00:07:55.282 - 00:09:02.100, Speaker B: Yeah, and the, I mean eventually you're going to get to the point where the Fed will have to do some form of yield curve control in the US the way I think about it is there's already kind of synthetic yield curve control happening in the US it's very wide band, I would say. But the levers that effectively produce this yield curve control are twofold or threefold. One, the Fed tells you where they're going to eventually take Rates due the DOT plot. Forward guidance allows the market to be pegged to something secondly, which is where long run inflation expectations get pegged to, that keeps a lid on the back end. Second way they can control it is by direct balance sheet involvement, purchases and sales of securities in their balance sheet portfolio. The third way is adjusting the issuance. This is more treasury issuing more T bills rather than notes and bonds.
00:09:02.100 - 00:10:19.372, Speaker B: And so they can adjust the curve by that. And Yellen did a great job of basically stopping the 10 year from going north of 5%, let's say issuing fewer, issuing relatively fewer back end fixed income than the market was expecting. In theory, that's how the US keeps the yield curve in a relatively managed spot. Now if you get to a scenario where basically you realize inflation's here to last, it's sticky, et cetera, then interest rates are going to stay high, then the interest expense becomes abundantly burdensome, and then it feeds on itself. And so you could reach a point where you kind of have back end expectations, kind of becoming more unhinged. Essentially the back end of the US curve represents the Fed's credibility, their credibility to get inflation down, the US Government's credibility in terms of being able to repay that debt, et cetera. And so if they start to lose some of that credibility, you'll see the back end go and that will be.
00:10:19.396 - 00:10:21.708, Speaker A: A big red flag. Be a big red flag.
00:10:21.884 - 00:10:34.812, Speaker B: Now the flip side to that argument is if you look at all the debt the US has in comparison to all the wealth that the US has, it's still a reasonable amount of debt.
00:10:34.876 - 00:10:35.480, Speaker C: Right.
00:10:37.380 - 00:10:39.516, Speaker B: You could tax people and pay that off.
00:10:39.588 - 00:10:40.284, Speaker A: Theoretically.
00:10:40.412 - 00:10:41.116, Speaker B: In theory.
00:10:41.228 - 00:10:41.820, Speaker A: In theory.
00:10:41.900 - 00:10:42.834, Speaker B: But good luck.
00:10:42.932 - 00:10:43.398, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:10:43.494 - 00:10:45.958, Speaker B: You only have populists trying to run like.
00:10:46.014 - 00:10:46.374, Speaker A: Right.
00:10:46.462 - 00:10:47.702, Speaker B: It's just it.
00:10:47.806 - 00:11:11.398, Speaker A: I mean, even among the Democratic like establishment, Biden was one of the more populous like figures historically, like for decades. Do you think that, what, what would take bitcoin out of this range to pivot here a little bit? Like, you know, I mean, we're still even now. We're looking at 65 high. 65, we've been in like the 60s. We hit 69 at the beginning of the week. It's still sort of in that big descending channel of the last, you know.
00:11:11.454 - 00:11:33.472, Speaker B: No, I mean, I'm very confident, fairly confident that a Trump victory is a very positive crypto catalyst. From the deregulation to the lack of selling. Banks will hold it on their balance sheet, further integration.
00:11:33.616 - 00:11:34.176, Speaker A: Choke point.
00:11:34.248 - 00:12:15.434, Speaker B: Yeah, choke point. All of that stuff I think is tremendously bullish for bitcoin and if you think about what a Trump administration means, dollar's rallying on it right now. That's because rates have gone a lot higher. But if you live in a world where there's some doubts with respect to the US and you have things like gold hitting fresh all time highs every other day and silver breaking out and this whole monetary debasement argument going and leadership that isn't the world doesn't look.
00:12:15.442 - 00:12:20.682, Speaker A: At Trump and being like he hasn't focused on that. He's not the guy that ends the debt problem.
00:12:20.866 - 00:13:19.564, Speaker B: Yeah, quite the opposite. And so there's, and eventually if the Fed's gonna have to start printing money again to manage the balance sheet because nobody wants to buy US paper at those existing levels. And if the levels go to where the market clearing level is, that's too burdensome on the treasury and the government. And so if you start getting closer and closer to that point, bitcoin will certainly go. And I think one of the things folks have to keep in mind is that there's kind of a positive price convexity to bitcoin in the sense that folks, once bitcoin breaks to fresh all time highs, people would be like, oh, why is it doing that? It's like doing that because of these fundamental reasons. And then folks are forced to chase if they're unallocated under allocated. And it just has this positive feedback loop that I think will get catalyzed by the Trump victory.
00:13:19.692 - 00:13:23.884, Speaker A: Well, it's going to be interesting. I can't wait to see this. Do you think it's going to be volatile on election night?
00:13:24.052 - 00:13:24.652, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:13:24.716 - 00:13:45.020, Speaker A: Yeah. We don't usually get even when we get them same day, which is most elections, although not in some of the prior ones. Not in 2000. Not in 2020. Right. But well changed by the time you woke up in 2020. But you know, polls typically close at 6, 7, 8pm on the east coast when we've learned the same night.
00:13:45.020 - 00:13:57.196, Speaker A: We haven't usually learned until 11 or midnight. But equity futures markets open around 8. Right. At 8, 6pm, 6pm so they'll, I mean there'll be plenty of ways to trade traditional equities, everything.
00:13:57.268 - 00:13:57.660, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:13:57.740 - 00:14:00.172, Speaker A: Bitcoin and crypto markets are 24,7.
00:14:00.356 - 00:14:01.244, Speaker B: You think there's going to be a.
00:14:01.252 - 00:14:05.244, Speaker A: Lot of people trying to read tea leaves and look at exit polls and actively trade.
00:14:05.332 - 00:14:13.452, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. And you know, I think for those that, you know, aren't professional tea leaf readers.
00:14:13.516 - 00:14:14.764, Speaker A: Yeah, not a great idea.
00:14:14.812 - 00:14:17.212, Speaker B: Wait till you have some reasonable measure.
00:14:17.276 - 00:14:24.656, Speaker A: Similar to what you said at the top of this, talk about, you know, being the fast follow, probably wait for a trend to be established. Yes. It's going to be an exciting one though, huh?
00:14:24.748 - 00:14:27.224, Speaker B: I mean, absolutely. I'll be in the office.
00:14:27.312 - 00:14:30.904, Speaker A: Yeah. Bim that a BB from Galaxy Trading. As always my friend, thank you so much.
00:14:30.992 - 00:14:31.416, Speaker B: Pleasure.
00:14:31.448 - 00:14:32.180, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:14:33.920 - 00:14:39.336, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, Quinn Thompson, cio, founder of Lekker Capital. Quinn, welcome back to Galaxy Brands.
00:14:39.368 - 00:14:40.456, Speaker C: Thank you. Great to be back.
00:14:40.528 - 00:14:50.360, Speaker A: You bet. You were on in March. You had, oh, I think that week you announced Lekker Capital on this show. Yeah. Special was great. Thank you. Yeah, it's great to have you back.
00:14:50.360 - 00:15:18.016, Speaker A: A lot has happened in markets since then. I mean in March bitcoin was racing to all time highs in nominal terms. I've become a inflation adjusted maxi and markets were ripping. But now, I mean if we just think about bitcoin as the proxy here, it's been a downward but mostly sideways channel for six months. You were bearish then, but you've become very bullish on Twitter. What has changed?
00:15:18.208 - 00:16:08.872, Speaker C: Yeah, so yeah, we recorded mid March, I believe I was becoming bearish. And then early April I went full bear and cash and kind of avoided most of that drawdown. Luckily people think it was Iran, Israel related. It was, that was the spark. But the tinder was a tightening liquidity financial conditions scenario, kind of overbought equities and overall risk. And obviously as we've seen now bitcoin, the hype and the momentum from the ETF basically front ran eight months of price appreciation. We had an amazing sprint from October to January and then that last push when the flows actually materialized into March and that was just kind of peak.
00:16:08.872 - 00:17:20.780, Speaker C: And then we obviously had meme coin mania, kickoff, et cetera. So I think that's the backdrop for this long period of chop. Going into the summer it's been this stop start environment. Very frustrating for most traders, particularly most traders in crypto are momentum was talking with Rahm last night about the difference between some people's natural tendencies to be a mean reversion trader versus momentum trader crypto just because of the asset class and its nature of historical price movements. Many people are momentum and it's been a mean reversion environment. So I think you can point to the main thing over the summer to me is going into June we've had, let's say May 1st was an FOMC where we bottomed at 57 and we kind of went back up to range highs again from there into late, maybe on the back of that surprise ETF there was sab some of this positive regulatory things in May and then in June, basically June FOMC right around there is when we got batted back down again, which we had a cold CPI print. The Fed was.
00:17:20.780 - 00:17:48.490, Speaker C: People were expecting the Fed to be dovish and maybe point to a July cut. They ended up being very hawkish. They were still kind of scarred from their early pivot in December. That proved out to still be bumpy on the inflation side. That sent bitcoin back down. We bottomed after the German selling when they were just having horrible execution on their sales. Someone needed a political win in Germany.
00:17:48.490 - 00:17:51.494, Speaker C: Early July raced back up into.
00:17:51.582 - 00:17:54.070, Speaker A: We had GOX then too distributing in early July.
00:17:54.190 - 00:18:22.968, Speaker C: Yep. Race back up around the time of the bitcoin conference. Trump's embracing. And then lo and behold, we have another Fed meeting end of July and they obviously did not cut and they kind of softly alluded to September cut. But in hindsight, right. Looking at the meeting minutes, some of the governors were actually pushing for a cut. And then in September they ended up doing 50, which they don't really that soon after.
00:18:22.968 - 00:19:08.994, Speaker C: Talk about mistakes or errors or you know what they would have changed. But if you're doing 50 in September and very rarely historically do you start with 50, it's admitting their mistake. They should have gone the 25th of July. So they didn't. That caused some things around the yen carry weaken dollar and then we obviously had some kind of hangover effects from those new lows into September. And here we are, you know, Powell at late August, Jackson Hole, extremely dovish, very definitive in his declaration of we are now entering an easing cycle September FOMC very much the same. And we're staring down the barrel of another cut right after the election and probably one in December.
00:19:08.994 - 00:19:58.048, Speaker C: And then wait and see, that gets us down closer to four on the fed funds rate and then kind of see how things which it's looking like the economy is already improving. So yeah, I think the macro picture from that point in time is just drastically different. You have an improving monetary outlook from an easing standpoint, whereas at that point you had worsening or the same and you have an economy that's heating back up. Part of that is just kind of the cyclical business cycle, but then the other part is those rate cuts will start taking hold. So I think on the macro alone kind of we'll get to the election, but the macro alone is just night and day from early to mid of the year. And that's kind of what I base the bulk of my thesis around.
00:19:58.104 - 00:20:18.890, Speaker A: Yeah. A lot can happen in six months and it has been really fascinating to think again sort of thinking about bitcoin as a proxy here. But you also had gold has made all time highs. You've had S and P's. I don't know at the moment we talk, but within 1:1 or 1.5% from all time highs. It's in fact I just saw somebody publish that.
00:20:18.890 - 00:20:28.442, Speaker A: You know the spaghetti chart. That's like every S and P like ever starting at day zero of a year. It's apparently right now. It's literally the best performing S and P in history.
00:20:28.546 - 00:20:29.242, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:20:29.386 - 00:20:30.074, Speaker A: In a year.
00:20:30.162 - 00:20:34.906, Speaker C: So it's, it's very 2020, 2021s conditions right now.
00:20:34.978 - 00:21:03.830, Speaker A: Yeah. Which is, which is wild because such a different. That was on the back of stimulus and massive cutting and. And yet here we are above 4% and still bullish, very bullish on risk assets. It feels like what does it take to get bitcoin out of that range? This is like a big clear again sort of as a proxy for crypto broadly. But bitcoin's pretty much the only major crypto asset that had a nominal all time high this year. It is basically the only one.
00:21:03.830 - 00:21:34.832, Speaker A: The charts look very different if you look at bitcoin versus ETH or even sol just in nominal terms. What gets us out of that range? Because we're still kind of, I mean we're at 66.5. The block clock is working now with the WI fi in the room. And you know, if we look at a descending channel like that's pretty much we're at the top of the range again and sort of got to, I mean almost, almost 60. We got to 69 a couple days ago. But failing to sort of break above definitively like what takes us higher.
00:21:34.936 - 00:22:23.104, Speaker C: Yeah, you really have to, you have look at the macro because you can assume crypto native buyers are pretty maxed out here. So that's I think a good framework or thing to keep in the back of your mind. Because when we're looking at like October of last year and I think conditions are fairly similar in terms of broader risk. But at that time you had people still questioning if we would get back to all time highs and if the ETF would be anything worthwhile or if it even happened and you're coming out of 23 where it was a lot more bearish and so the positioning was not as full. Today you have CME and pretty much all futures open. Interest levels at highs. Granted funding rates aren't at highs.
00:22:23.104 - 00:22:46.714, Speaker C: So it's not maybe max long, but we're close. And you have a lot of Bitcoin ETF inflows in the rearview that are there. So it's less of a non consensus trade as it was in late 23. But that's just kind of conditions. That doesn't mean we don't break out. I think we do break out for that macro reason. I think it's just kind of wild.
00:22:46.714 - 00:23:22.590, Speaker C: We have this Fed meeting right after the election. And so you're going to. It's a lot in one week, right? Especially if there's a Trump victory. You're kind of like, I almost don't even know how it plays out because it would be so much good news for the asset class in one week. But to me, it's the macro that I'm basing the core of my views off. And I think once the Fed goes through with that 25 in November, because there's been a lot of inflation scares. PJT was on cnbc, Druck was on cnbc, kind of shorting the long bond, long gold, long inflation assets.
00:23:22.590 - 00:24:00.568, Speaker C: And inflation is bad for risk. When the Fed starts doing something about it, people are worried about inflation now coming back. Granted, it's early oil's still at the bottom of the range. There's not quite signs yet of it coming back. It's more speculating that that's what will happen. And so the Fed, the concerns of late as yields have spiked and the dollar has risen and tighten financial conditions is that the Fed's going to roll back their cutting path. And if you look at the expectations of the Fed Fed funds right now, all of that excess has been priced out.
00:24:00.568 - 00:24:45.078, Speaker C: So sitting here today, you're kind of looking at a market expectations of 25 in November, 25 probably in December, and then January is a toss up. So I would say all that excess Fed cut, his expectation has been wrung out. And so I think over the last few days, the market's kind of digested that and we've had some chop sitting at range highs. But we're rolling into a November Fed meeting where they're likely to probably maintain a December cut as the base case. And I think that's what the market's looking for to really press these inflation trades. And so I think that on itself is enough to do it. But then obviously, if you toss in a Trump win, which is my base case, that should be enough to do.
00:24:45.134 - 00:25:22.866, Speaker A: Let's talk about the election before we get into the probabilities and why that's bullish or whatever. But I was talking with some folks at a big bank and big options firm and both were separately and they're both telling me that positioning is very light going into the election in general. People aren't really. There's a lot of people in cash sort of waiting to deploy which would be supportive in my mind. Theoretically, no matter who wins, they eventually gotta deploy that cash somewhere. But a lot of unknowns and I think Susquehanna said publicly I saw in an article they're like head of options. That very light positioning here.
00:25:22.866 - 00:25:52.406, Speaker A: People not exactly sure what the trade is or what the trades are. Crypto is one of the clearest I think that outperforms in a Trump win. How do you think about just again sort of broadly aside from crypto trading, the election leading into it, what is you know, you see polymarket you can bet purely now and Cal she in the US is legal but if you wanted to bet on you know, sectors or something like how do you think of like what outperforms.
00:25:52.518 - 00:25:52.934, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:25:52.982 - 00:25:54.134, Speaker A: In each scenario or whatever.
00:25:54.182 - 00:27:02.436, Speaker C: Yeah, I think so. What I've been tracking for a while now and it's starting to get more traction is the traditional basket of Trump stocks which would be like private prisons clamping down on immigration. You know, you could look at coal stocks, you can look at energy stocks, you know, removing the, the effect of the commodity underlying. You can look at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those public equities on the idea that Republicans would or Red Sweep would privatize them. So those are assets to look and almost all of those, probably all of them actually still to this day are not yet at year to date highs nominally and not yet at year to date highs versus their benchmark. So if it's a small cap like Geogroup or something or core Civic comparing to the benchmark and they're not yet even where they were in like say July around that, that hype. So you know it's one of these events where you can price in the favorite to some degree pre but it's such a unknown that you will never, there will still be some movement after the fact and we will never reach very close to full pricing because there's so many, you know the, the weather on voting day matter.
00:27:02.436 - 00:27:59.450, Speaker C: Like there's just so many things for turnout and all these unknown. So for me I kind of and I think this is coming out more with like these CNBC big, big hedge fund interviews is people are just positioning for a probably pretty similar macro environment under, under Each president and ultimately, you know, you get these one to two month moves after on momentum and, and narrative hype that, you know, one might be good for energy and bad for banks or something. Democrats known higher regulation and financial services. Trump's known as cut the red tape and regional banks go flying. So there's these trades like that, but it just depends on your time horizon. I play some of these and there's some interesting things you can do around them, I think, and maybe fading when they get to extremes because it always takes way more to materialize. But the election itself will be interesting because I mean for me, I'm not like a day trader.
00:27:59.450 - 00:28:12.762, Speaker C: So the night of the election, like how many false starts are you? Like, it's going to be so funny to watch. I don't plan on, I plan on being in position and structuring the portfolio in a way that I'm kind of finding regardless.
00:28:12.826 - 00:28:13.162, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:13.226 - 00:28:47.262, Speaker C: And then, you know, around the edges when you get the decision, you expect some follow through on the move and you want to maybe make your final touches. But trying to trade that evening, like there's, I mean whichever news channel you're going to be watching is going to have a different declaration of Victor. And we know how last time went, went to bed and woke up and it was reversed. Like, yeah, it's too, it's too volatile and unknown. Like there's no edge because you're sitting there and you're like, oh, NBC said that Kamala's in the lead. Oh, Fox said Donald's in the lead. Like, and you're just kind of trading the chart with no real edge.
00:28:47.326 - 00:29:23.082, Speaker A: You think like that's going to be volatile that night. I mean, I think you're right. Smart, smart managers probably aren't trying to like day trade like News report on November 5th. But you know, the polls, I think they mostly start to close on the east coast in the US around seven, some maybe even at six. But we really don't start to get, I think even when it's been called definitively the night of, it's not until 10 or 11, even later sometimes, I mean, sometimes all through the night. Right. But so you get equity futures and stuff open at like 8pm Right.
00:29:23.082 - 00:29:39.366, Speaker A: And obviously bitcoin and crypto is always open. You know, I'm expecting a pretty volatile evening. I think as people, like I said, most smart people probably won't be actively trading it, but people always try to pull forward and look for an edge when they find one. Do you think it'll be volatile that Night.
00:29:39.438 - 00:30:05.930, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. Because again, it's like the smart traders will probably be playing mean reversion that night playing, you know, if someone gets out to an early lead bringing, you know, betting the other way, fading that kind of going back and forth that way. But to be honest. So if you look back at last five or 10 elections, some of them have gone like 2,000. Obviously. Gore and Bush went into like days and weeks litigation. Yeah.
00:30:05.930 - 00:30:30.480, Speaker C: 28, 2008 and 2012. Obama's two wins were called pre midnight. I think those are the best comps. I think it gets called pre midnight. It's funny, you know, both sides now yell at the other about not accepting the results. And you have just this like, that's the state we're in. But my base case is it's a surprise.
00:30:30.480 - 00:31:06.550, Speaker C: And I've held this view for quite a while. You know, politics is a topic most people don't like to go to, but I welcome, you know, touchy subjects on Twitter. So I've been kind of outspoken that I believe, you know, and I'm less making an assessment that I think one or the other is outstanding in either regard. But from the party registration data, the mail and voting registration, the polling, the different on the ground momentum and indicators you can track. I think that's where it.
00:31:07.170 - 00:31:25.660, Speaker A: And you've also said on Twitter something that I've tried that I think is also true, and I've put out too, that basically from a crypto policy standpoint, either is probably better than the status quo. Yes, sort of. My view. What makes you think that, you know, when we.
00:31:26.040 - 00:31:36.928, Speaker C: Beginning this year, you and I did this, this podcast with Rahm around the etf, and the question was, is it a buy the, buy the rumor, sell the news, sell the rumor, buy the news. You know, what would that launch be?
00:31:36.984 - 00:31:49.306, Speaker A: And ETF was classic because it was a sell the rumor, buy the, buy the rumor, sell the news. Briefly. Yeah, it took about a month and a half before the inflows really started materializing. And then of course it was. You wanted to own it, not have sold it.
00:31:49.378 - 00:32:07.732, Speaker C: Yes. So we did that on like January 3rd. So it was like 10 days or whatever before. And my point around that was it's a. It depends where your price is going in. It was a if it was buy if we're at 40 and sell at 50, kind of this range going in. But the one thing that informed that the big.
00:32:07.732 - 00:32:46.078, Speaker C: You have this volume event sitting out here on the horizon. And, you know, that event is. Could be drastically positive, you know, on the Day of launch, in weeks following, we could have had 10, 20 billion inflows or we could add zero, but we weren't going to have negative outside of the grayscale, short one time, you know, liquidation event. So just structurally over a medium term, that, that makes that event positive. And now the question is how much of the pricing occurred prior. And obviously a lot occurred prior. We dipped 20% and then the flows materialized and we went up.
00:32:46.078 - 00:33:52.296, Speaker C: So I think going into the election it's a similar state, some differences, but you know, you have Trump, which is drastically better than status quo. And then you have Harris, who seems to be taking many cues from Mark Cuban, who touts himself as pro crypto and just she's picking up on voter preference and trying to, I believe, I believe who knows what she's actually gonna do and if she believes in it. But it's true that there's less, you know, less power given to the Warren camp under her. Like they are not that good of friends. Like things like this that imply, and you can, I think rightly assume it's not as bad. So like it's either status quo or maybe slightly better or it's way better. And so, you know, you have this very positive macro event or macro horizon and you factor that in where I think the left tails are removed from people's biggest fears.
00:33:52.296 - 00:34:55.564, Speaker C: And so if people are hedged or sitting in cash going in and once that event risk clears, you have then people who need to put on exposure. And so, yeah, I mean, I think a lot of people in crypto point to the nuance around, oh well, bitcoin is fine under either, but alts. And frankly, I think that misses the bigger picture of the and ignores why alts have been so lackluster thus far the whole cycle. And even if Trump wins, to me that's a valuation problem across the board, right? Like ETH itself, 200, $250 billion asset, it's the same size as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs combined market cap. I mean, so you go and try to pitch that to anybody who's an ETF buyer and good luck, right? Go to that same buyer and say, hey, Bitcoin, 1/15th 1/20th the size of gold's market cap, but superior in all functionality and characteristics. Just, it's got a big discount because it's less mature and more nascent. But if you believe in the structural reasons to buy gold, bitcoin's right behind it.
00:34:55.564 - 00:35:34.632, Speaker C: Okay, I'll put 1, 5, 10% in there. And so there's this dichotomy and separation, it's the same thing. Look at the gold chart. Do the spaghetti chart of gold and then every other metal, palladium, platinum, silver or other commodities, and they're all different. And so I think that's people whistling by the graveyard a little bit and what the ETH ETF is telling us about the rest of the alt complex. And so that's why I'm of the view that regardless, I still kind of maintain this bitcoin dominant perspective. Obviously there's situations, maybe it's sol, maybe it's other alts that have fundamental catalysts and are more attractively priced.
00:35:34.632 - 00:35:54.584, Speaker C: But the alt space broadly is, I think, going to struggle regardless because Trump will be good for regulation. He'll put in a new SEC chair who's not. Doesn't hate the industry, but it's not going to. It doesn't fix the valuations. Maybe you get a boost in fundamentals. And obviously if he wins, there's going to be a speculative pump.
00:35:54.632 - 00:35:54.888, Speaker A: Right.
00:35:54.944 - 00:35:58.336, Speaker C: So I'm talking more like multi month, multi quarter, horizon.
00:35:58.408 - 00:36:28.016, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it makes sense. I think, you know, I did an episode in September we called the State of Crypto where I kind of. There was a. There's a lot of malaise in the. In the crypto world that I was seeing and friends and conversations and at conferences. And I think it was a lot about the lack of durable use cases still having emerged in the sort of broader blockchain space. Defi very widely used in crypto, like I think has product market fit in crypto.
00:36:28.016 - 00:36:57.996, Speaker A: There's no, you know, portfolio manager at a mutual fund company or financial advisor. That's like putting assets into defi. Right. And in many cases they may be prohibited from doing so. There is some movement of traditional issuers trying to capitalize on defi wealth by putting some instruments, mostly like treasuries and tokenized fixed income products on chain. But that's really just picking up business from the defi wealth. Right.
00:36:57.996 - 00:37:32.820, Speaker A: And that's probably the most durable proven product market fit in crypto is defi and basically no one in tradfi uses it. And then more broadly, I mean, NFTs and gaming, there is that cool new game off the grid, the avalanche, sort of based, has NFTs and it really looks really good. I haven't played it yet, but that stuff hasn't really materialized. And that's part of contributing to why you have. The other area of hype other than bitcoin has been meme coins and which, you know, I Just are just not durable as like an asset class in my view. I mean it's fairly safe statement. I don't know.
00:37:32.820 - 00:37:54.620, Speaker A: Right. And then the other narratives in crypto have all been infrastructure related. That have been big narratives this year. Right. It's modularity and data availability and restaking. None of that's actually like a use case. That's like we're still building the plumbing and so something needs to give there I think for true big interest to happen.
00:37:54.620 - 00:38:03.228, Speaker A: Right. For Eth to get to all time highs. In 2021 you had Jimmy Fallon holding up a bored ape on national television. We're not close to that.
00:38:03.284 - 00:38:37.950, Speaker C: No. Yeah, No, I mean people got burned, outsiders got burned and it's. I compare it kind of to like why is NASDAQ trumping Cathie Wood arc stocks? It's the same thing. Why is gold outperforming silver? Why is Bitcoin outperforming alts? And ETH is the barometer for alts. It's part to do with the macro environment. I can point to structural reasons, higher interest rates, yet still a healthy economy. So the thesis I think is better for these larger cap assets.
00:38:37.950 - 00:39:16.472, Speaker C: But when you boil it down, I mean, is it surprising when you say there's. You look at crypto activity and transactions volumes, revenues for certain protocols. It's dramatically dominated by meme coins and speculation. And I'm always kind of of the camp, I like to look at what is. And I don't get tribal or oh my God, that's so bad or oh my God, that's so good. I just kind of evaluate things for what they are. And there's reasons like people come to crypto.
00:39:16.472 - 00:40:00.444, Speaker C: Crypto natives speculate, they want to generate outsized returns and for years they've been getting dumped on by high FTV VC coins, let's call it. And they still want that speculative gambling fix. And so they're just going to a more pure casino type environment with the meme coins. But that has real ramifications for the rest of the industry. One, attention capital flows, let's say talent. Look at someone like Murad, who probably in the past would have been building some innovative piece of tech and now he's talking about meme coins. It just is what it is.
00:40:00.444 - 00:40:26.850, Speaker C: I'm not prescribing if it's good or bad. So you have to look at that and say what does that mean for the rest of the ecosystem? And I think that is, you know, attributing to, okay, if you're an outsider like Is can you rest your thesis on like meme coins, like you say, being sustainable, being durable, like even poly Market. That's, you know, everyone pointed that as our best crypto's best thing like app this year and. Yeah, let's talk about it on November 6th.
00:40:26.930 - 00:40:28.290, Speaker A: Yeah, I was A great point.
00:40:28.330 - 00:41:05.956, Speaker C: Because that's like, you know, there's plenty of examples like Polymart. You will forget about Polymarket by December, you know, so again, great, cool. But how durable is it? And you're getting some gaming and stablecoins have been that thing and they continue to be that thing by far. But there's no margin to be made there. There's very little business. We already have the dominant players and so it's a tough thing for crypto natives to speculate on. So I think that broader environment continues to despite even if Trump wins.
00:41:05.956 - 00:41:08.756, Speaker C: I think not a whole lot is changing in that regard.
00:41:08.788 - 00:41:22.964, Speaker A: Yeah, I think you definitely get regulatory easing and that's helpful, but I think it's reasonable. It sounds like part of your argument here is that it was not regulatory attacks that have caused broader crypto to underperform.
00:41:23.092 - 00:41:45.438, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, look at these tokens and you have. Sure. Okay. One of the commonly touted thesis is when Trump wins, it's going to be great for DeFi. All right, that's a fine case. But let's look at the DEFI ecosystem and valuations and compare those to like other things you can buy and you know, oh, we can turn on the fee switches.
00:41:45.438 - 00:42:14.530, Speaker C: Well, probably most of the assets are probably already priced. For best case, turn on the fee switch scenario. And when you do that, you know, one of the things, and it was 99 or 2000 when I think it was Yahoo or Amazon when they reported earnings and they reported positive cash flow or positive earnings for the first time. And it was right around the peak of the dot com bubble because it was like for so long you could be like, you know, it's a joke in crypto too. Right. Don't produce revenues because then you get valued off something.
00:42:14.910 - 00:42:18.182, Speaker A: It's a Silicon Valley quote from Russ Hanneman.
00:42:18.246 - 00:42:57.038, Speaker C: Yeah. That comes from a legitimate place. And so I think you're seeing that a little bit because in crypto right now the stigma is don't become an asset that people talk about in earnings multiples or yield because that's bad for your valuation. Well, unfortunately that's how just all assets ever in the history kind of are discussed and over time. This is a multi year. This bitcoin dominance thing is a Multi year phenomenon that I think plays out. So you're going to have these one or two month cases where people want to speculate probably if Trump wins you'd get that.
00:42:57.038 - 00:43:04.798, Speaker C: And so you know, depending your time horizon you might want to play that. But over the broader, you know, outlook, it's not that great.
00:43:04.854 - 00:43:40.480, Speaker A: If we look at bitcoin dominance, it's almost at 60% which is, I mean if this is a bull market then it's, that's unprecedented. I really don't think it is a crypto bull market. It's been a decent, I mean you know, obviously if we go by like a 20% move up then it's a, it's a bull market technically. But thinking in crypto terms, you know we, I posted that graphic that was bitcoin adjusted for CPI $2020. I have this view that I think people, I mean it depends, you know, who you are, what you do for a living, what you focus on. But I think the average person kind of. It's very hard for the brain to comprehend inflation.
00:43:40.480 - 00:44:12.286, Speaker A: Right. Especially if you're in America where like for the, you know, we haven't had serious inflation until now, since the 70s. Yes. So you're not accustomed to your unit of account having fluctuated a lot but really since 2020 just by CPI and that probably undercounts it. The dollar lost 14 or 15% of its value across all. I mean more and other, you know, depending on what you're buying with it, it's probably more like 20 or 30 I think. And bitcoin is the only one that's really interesting where it made nominal new all time highs.
00:44:12.286 - 00:44:37.762, Speaker A: But in a real adjusted it did not. We can look at ether other alts or crypto market cap, they didn't make nominal all time highs anyway. So it's just lower than you thought. But that bitcoin dominance or the ETH BTC ratio which I also look which is bitcoin dominance sort of at multi year highs, ETH BTC ratio at multi year lows. You don't think that reverses in the case of a Trump win or maybe only short term and then it reverts.
00:44:37.906 - 00:45:01.060, Speaker C: I would have to imagine there's a short term movement but durably man that current whatever we're at 0.038 or something on ethbtc. That's a levy ready to break. I mean I think we're going down 0.035033. The other thing to keep in mind is how these things happen. Usually when we do break range highs. Right.
00:45:01.060 - 00:45:39.194, Speaker C: Because that's the game on switch for. I was saying this to explain to someone. They're like, okay, Quinn, you giving me this bullish macro thesis and it's so good. And you're resting your case on the macro being good and new buyers coming into the bitcoin ETF or traditional non crypto buyers. And they're like, so why haven't they come in already if the macro is so good? I'm like, well, because smart money doesn't lever up at range highs. They either conviction buy low range lows and hold and then they just hold through or they buy the breakout. Like you don't, you know, you don't press at these key levels like that.
00:45:39.282 - 00:45:47.194, Speaker A: You don't want to be the one that tries to make it break range high. It's the opposite of catching a falling knife. It's right, exactly. Let it do its thing.
00:45:47.282 - 00:46:16.542, Speaker C: Yeah. And then you pile in if, if. And so this, it's counterintuitive, but buyers live higher is like this saying, and in cases, look at gold, right? Gold really struggled at that 2000 level so many times. So many times it wore everyone out. And then it BAM, straight to 2700 wherever we're at in months. And so I think that's playing out and maybe we have to go shake people out again or whatever. Like timing wise, I'm not trading on too short, but talking about the EBTC part.
00:46:16.566 - 00:46:17.214, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:46:17.342 - 00:47:00.840, Speaker C: On these big breakouts that kind of give the green light for the rest of the ecosystem. And assuming a bitcoin breakout means capital's going to rush in and also then people are going to have more eyes on crypto as a whole. You'd expect other things to do well is in addition, you get usually a bitcoin kind of green God candle first. You know, if you go back to October 2023, the Cointelegraph intern leak about the ETF, Bitcoin outperformed everything for a good number of days, maybe a week. And then, you know, so because everybody's underexposed in crypto to bitcoin, so they, they there tends to be momentum rush in for a short time. So I think something like that could happen. Then you could get reversion to alts on hype around Trump and regulatory.
00:47:00.840 - 00:47:17.432, Speaker C: But ultimately where these things settle, I think the trend from the last while is a fairly reasonable one to bet on unless there's meaningful changes. So I'm saying it's a valuation issue. The other way that valuation issue could fix is if fundamentals improve and come up to the price a lot of.
00:47:17.456 - 00:47:20.072, Speaker A: Usage new apps that get product market.
00:47:20.096 - 00:47:34.810, Speaker C: Fit exactly fees and so I will always adjust my views with new information but at this moment it's tough to paint a very attractive picture for most of the longer tail.
00:47:34.890 - 00:48:05.490, Speaker A: Super interesting because I haven't really started to. I've been a very vocal short ETHBTC for years now and part of me is thinking, well in a Trump presidency, victory, administration, whatever, I mean obviously bitcoin is going to do well. I think we've talked about this earlier in the pod. That probably does fine in either case. Doesn't really have any regulatory business before the regulators so it's probably more of a macro type of thing. But Trump could pour gas on it. Sure.
00:48:05.490 - 00:48:36.450, Speaker A: He's called for a strategic bitcoin stockpile. I can't say I'm opposed to it. I don't think it's that good of an idea from a policy standpoint. But I know he can't keep Bitfinex's coins. I don't think so. I'm not sure which coins he's really referring to but probably positive, probably more positive than Kamala Harris's administration would be for bitcoin but for alts like I mean if he's talking about if we get a material easing of the regulatory. I mean alts are under pressure.
00:48:36.450 - 00:49:04.764, Speaker A: I mean there's 60 non Bitcoin and ETH coins alleged by the SEC to be unregistered security. 60. I think across all of their lawsuits you've got things like the exchange definition that are really bad for defi and the broker rule which I think actually there's a big win for crypto. They said they're not currently applying it to any defi related stuff which is actually great but you could totally see them doing it. That stuff just reverses. Right. It should be positive.
00:49:04.764 - 00:49:20.554, Speaker A: But your point which is I haven't. So I've been considering whether on the event of a Trump win I call the bottom on ethbtc and I haven't decided here yet. But your view is that sure it could bounce but. But these bigger forces still exist.
00:49:20.682 - 00:49:24.986, Speaker C: Yeah. I'll want to see that move before I make like a super hard.
00:49:25.058 - 00:49:26.890, Speaker A: You don't want to reverse catch the knife on this one.
00:49:26.930 - 00:49:39.194, Speaker C: You want. Yeah, like I'm happy to be. You know let someone else buy the bottom tick of that ratio. And I also think if you sol eth is a funnier chart.
00:49:39.322 - 00:49:40.458, Speaker A: I wanted to ask you about this.
00:49:40.514 - 00:49:41.194, Speaker C: I think You.
00:49:41.282 - 00:50:28.156, Speaker A: Yeah, well, because you've also been tweeting about Soul Eth and I don't, I actually don't think a lot of people trade the, actually trade these ratios Y like you know, borrow and sell ETH to buy so long like or, or bitcoin vice versa. But I like the ratios because they tell you a lot of. I think they're quite demonstrative of the stories of the space. Right. Like, and so ETH BTC is a great one because it, it talks about this bitcoin dominance, this sort of barbell market, the lack of durable use cases that have emerged, whatever. But SOL is interesting because this is one of the other, I would say big stories in crypto is okay, set aside, you know, we all know the market and the use cases and adoption rates that we currently have. But you know, which platform, if you're building or if it's defi or if it's meme coins or whatever it is.
00:50:28.156 - 00:50:49.704, Speaker A: Like if it's gaming, if it's the tokenization of equity securities, where should you do it? And that's been a debate for years. Right. You have ETH and then I mean we put out a report in 21 called Ready Layer 1 that was ETH and 10 alternatives. Most of those are not relevant now, but some still are. And Solana is one that is definitely relevant. Right. Is extremely durable.
00:50:49.704 - 00:51:08.744, Speaker A: Price wise has been, I mean surprisingly. Right. Everybody thought it was dead because of Sam Bankman Fried's deep involvement and FTX owned all these coins. But it's the opposite. It went up huge last fall also along with bitcoin and that ratio SOL ETH is kind of at the top of the range. Right.
00:51:08.832 - 00:51:09.992, Speaker C: Broke out yesterday actually.
00:51:10.096 - 00:51:33.106, Speaker A: Well, there you go. So what does that tell you about the competition between these smart contract platforms? Like if we step back from the app side and the valuation of the app layer. But what about the infrastructure layer here? But to me it feels like the main battle for smart contract platform dominance is now ETH and its L2S. This modular vision versus Solana. And it's whatever. Its monolithic vision. Yeah.
00:51:33.138 - 00:51:35.938, Speaker C: Which is funny because Seoul's building, they're building L2s.
00:51:35.994 - 00:51:37.330, Speaker A: What do they call them? They have a different name.
00:51:37.370 - 00:51:37.986, Speaker C: I don't even know.
00:51:38.058 - 00:51:40.982, Speaker A: Austin Federa had a good. I forget what it is. There's a different name.
00:51:41.066 - 00:51:42.318, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay, you're trying.
00:51:42.374 - 00:51:44.010, Speaker A: They kind of are L2s though.
00:51:44.550 - 00:52:05.214, Speaker C: I've met some of the founders and they say they're the sol. But it's, it's, it's their momentum plays they're, you know, at some point. Right. If ETH btc, if you just extrapolate that forward down forever, that would implicate Soul as well because it's its closest comp. It's a smart, you know, it's Soul's closer to Ethan is bitcoin.
00:52:05.262 - 00:52:05.970, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:52:06.560 - 00:53:05.618, Speaker C: But the activities on Seoul and whether you believe that activity is durable or not, it's getting priced in to make the underlying more stout from a fundamental perspective and a valuation perspective. And so I think Seoul's obviously led thus far. But the other thing is looking forward and how much of the crypto AI conversion is real. I will not be the one to opine on that, but I will say when you combine the biggest traditional non crypto global narrative and tailwind in financial markets AI with crypto, right. That's a pretty easy narrative to latch onto. And all of that is happening on Seoul or where or you know, near around it. It's not, I mean I don't even know of anything AI related on eth.
00:53:05.618 - 00:53:31.924, Speaker C: ETH is known as this defi chain. So that's why people are talking about it with the Trump election. But yeah, it's. I think that sole ETH ratio is pretty telling of if you're going to be risk on into these things where you want to be. And now that it actually has broken out pre election, man, that's a tough fade. And personally I'm usually not trading those ratios either. Like there's both such volatile assets.
00:53:31.924 - 00:53:44.160, Speaker C: It's more of informing like yeah, all right, if I want to be long, which one and which has a momentum, which has a mind share which is likely to continue and then you see a big breakout like that. I think it was Solita was testing that upper bound for months.
00:53:44.860 - 00:54:22.838, Speaker A: Yeah, it was. I saw you posted that chart. It's an interesting one. You know what I was thinking about the other day was the crypto AI. We published a report almost probably about a year ago about this, looking at the early protocols for you know, like sharing compute and whatnot and doing decentralized inference and all that type of stuff, which are interesting. I think they're early, but it's interesting and I think at the highest level there's interest, there's reason for like if you think of AI as supreme abundance, right. Like push a button, generate a painting, right? Like generate 10,000 words like you ask ChatGPT, like describe Quinn Thompson.
00:54:22.838 - 00:54:59.060, Speaker A: It gives me like a paragraph and I can be like explorer, expand that to a thousand words and it will Just, it will figure out what to say. Right. It'll mine all your tweets and whatnot. Like it's, it's, it's just click of a button, anything you could ever want. From a content standpoint, you combine that super abundance with the perfect scarcity and verifiability of blockchains. Like it seems like there's an interesting. I haven't, you know, we've seen people doing like, you know, I know, I know Castle island has invested in some of these firms but that try to do authentication or proving the veracity or uniqueness using which is one way.
00:54:59.060 - 00:55:24.478, Speaker A: I don't think we've seen the overlap really captured yet by a startup or a crypto protocol or whatever. That's one. Everyone's looking at a digital identity as the other side of the coin to the supreme abundance. That's what I think people usually talk about when crypto AI. But then the other thing, and maybe you've looked at these too, I think the real crypto and AI overlap that we are seeing play out is the data center game.
00:55:24.534 - 00:55:24.862, Speaker C: Yes.
00:55:24.926 - 00:55:53.354, Speaker A: The bitcoin mining companies spent years with a lot of capital and the incentive to build out these massive electricity and energy businesses. Right. And now they're all being courted. We started to see some, I can't mention any specific names but you know, people can Google, you know which mining companies are doing stuff in AI. But like there's all this demand for, it's not just demand for computation. You can build a warehouse that's not that hard, a tier one data center. It's expensive, but it's not like.
00:55:53.354 - 00:56:07.434, Speaker A: But the real asset is the energy and bitcoin miners have it in heaps. Right. Like to me that's going to be the, that's going to be successful as an overlap before like a crypto protocol and the inference and stuff. What do you think about that?
00:56:07.522 - 00:56:43.996, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean it's been huge positions for the fund and I think it's really the, the best form of bitcoin beta in the market today. You can think of them as like a kind of AI semiconductor tracking valuation. Right. If the big large meg 7 hyperscalers or whatever as those valuations rise, that puts a floor presumably on these. Considering there's multi year backlog of demand for these data centers. And then on top of that you have almost like a bitcoin call option.
00:56:44.028 - 00:56:48.716, Speaker A: Embedded because it's like a bitcoin equity with an AI kicker.
00:56:48.748 - 00:56:49.036, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:56:49.068 - 00:56:50.284, Speaker A: Or like a data center kicker.
00:56:50.332 - 00:57:12.230, Speaker C: Yeah. So I'm generating contracted cash flows from my HPC side. And if bitcoin goes to 200, I have all these miners on the other side of the business. So that it's a huge. People don't understand that. And having historically bitcoin mining has been one of the worst businesses you can ever even endeavor to.
00:57:12.270 - 00:57:15.430, Speaker A: It's incredibly competitive. It's almost perfectly competitive.
00:57:15.510 - 00:57:28.086, Speaker C: Yeah. There's no way to differentiate on the revenue side. You're given what you're given and the only way to differentiate. It's like all commodities. Gold miners have liked gold for ages. Right. Bitcoin miners have generally liked bitcoin for ages.
00:57:28.086 - 00:57:40.988, Speaker C: But now you have this kind of just fell in the lap of these companies that had the power agreements because that's the, like you mentioned the, the real kicker here is getting those long term PPA agreements. Yeah.
00:57:41.004 - 00:57:57.020, Speaker A: And the energy infrastructure, the connections to grids. There's regulatory approvals. Many of them are approved for like enormous amounts. More. Yeah. I mean it's, it's. They are the like the biggest consumers of energy, of electricity in a lot of these grid jurisdictions.
00:57:57.100 - 00:58:24.690, Speaker C: Yeah. And it helps that the players pursuing this are the largest companies in the world, the richest, most cash rich, biggest balance sheets. So they can pay a premium if there's this arms race, which there is. So yeah, I've been very active in that space. I think it's super interesting. And there's been a big dichotomy between the two sides. The bitcoin miners that are actively pursuing an HPC strategy versus the ones that aren't.
00:58:24.690 - 00:58:40.718, Speaker C: You know that when you have that contracted stability in your business and cash flows, it brings down your cost of capital, allows you to finance at a cheaper level, brings in new investors and for everybody. And scale. So yeah, that's my favorite quote unquote, bitcoin beta.
00:58:40.894 - 00:58:56.414, Speaker A: It's super interesting. They're uniquely positioned. It did kind of fall into their laps. I mean I think there's only a couple. I mean that really sort of saw there. There were some Ethereum GPU miners that made this transition explicitly years ago. But they were early.
00:58:56.414 - 00:59:02.382, Speaker A: Right. And some are big and still here and now really important. It is a really interesting confluence of those trends.
00:59:02.446 - 00:59:02.926, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:59:03.038 - 00:59:18.286, Speaker A: You just like, I mean there's no other industry in the world that's been aggressively buying and building data center and electrical infrastructure than the bitcoin miners. Ethereum. You guys could have had this, you could have been part of this game, but you guys switched to proof of stake.
00:59:18.398 - 00:59:42.666, Speaker C: Yeah. Well, the other funny thing is on the regulatory front, but we see these just scare tactic type doom and gloom fear mongering articles about bitcoin mining's energy consumption which have all been debunked by you and Nick like 6,000 times. And then when it's AI it's the sexiest new trend. But in reality that power need is drastically larger.
00:59:42.778 - 01:00:01.814, Speaker A: One of the trends we've seen is the. Was it one of the big Mag 7s is buying a miniature nuclear reactor? I think what's the nuclear power plant in New York or something point. Yeah. That they shut down a couple of years ago, they're going to restart it now.
01:00:01.902 - 01:00:03.526, Speaker C: Yeah, nuclear is so.
01:00:03.598 - 01:00:21.938, Speaker A: And, and yeah I was going to say that's. I mean that's right. Nuclear is green. It emits water vapor and nothing else. It's got the highest energy density of any known energy producing commodity. But it had been maligned by the sort of green left for decades. But even I saw the Sierra Club has now basically come out being actually we're pro nuclear.
01:00:21.938 - 01:00:39.218, Speaker A: Like is that going to be, is that a trade like from a commodity standpoint or maybe on the equity company side companies that do nuclear stuff or it seems like we need it, we need a lot more electricity. I don't think there's any future where we're as a species supremely successful and we have less electricity.
01:00:39.314 - 01:01:33.262, Speaker C: Yeah, that's the thing that people don't realize is and really why we had the struggles in 2022 was an inflation spike largely caused by commodity spike, which is energy. And the reason dating back to the tech boom since the 2000 and tens is because we haven't had inflation and the cost of capital is dirt cheap and you can invest for 10, 20 year horizons without producing cash flow in these speculative technologies. And because the cost of capital is so cheap, you don't need to produce cash flow day one and people are willing to invest in that. So reducing your energy cost to me is the utmost factor. I think that's one of the reasons why personally kind of have a preference towards Trump infrastructure and energy policy. And I think that's one of the things that anti fossil fuels people have gotten wrong is you can't flip a switch overnight and turn off your oil and gas consumption. It needs to be gradual.
01:01:33.262 - 01:01:47.228, Speaker C: And the nuclear thing always kind of was confusing to people like why you know, the environmentalists hated it. It kind of mixed in with obviously fears around different nuclear power plant issues.
01:01:47.284 - 01:01:49.132, Speaker A: In the past Three Mile Island, Chernobyl.
01:01:49.196 - 01:02:03.164, Speaker C: Fukushima and the technology is getting a lot better. So China's actually Like leaps and leaps ahead of us. Because they've been building these for now years and years. They can do it in like a fifth of the cost in time. Yeah, it's pretty wild.
01:02:03.212 - 01:02:13.906, Speaker A: There's also regulatory hurdles. Right. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is like, I'm not an expert in this, but my understanding is it's among the biggest balls of red tape in the world to try to navigate.
01:02:14.018 - 01:02:31.730, Speaker C: Yeah. So no, that trade, definitely, it's run like crazy. If you bought it on the August 5 lows, you'd be sitting pretty. But so I don't know how to get in here. I think a lot of people are locked out of it and looking to buy dips. But no, it's certainly going to be huge. And I think the knock on too is in the natural gas world.
01:02:31.730 - 01:03:04.642, Speaker C: So we're Europe and liquid natural gas LNG terminals are being built all across Europe. So we'll be exporting more of that to Europe as they kind of reduce their dependency on Russia. And, you know, it's been a very abundant source of energy in the us it's bit cleaner than other forms like coal and things like that. So that's another area. I think if people are interested in the thesis behind nuclear and powering these data centers and AI, you know, natural gas is probably not too far behind it.
