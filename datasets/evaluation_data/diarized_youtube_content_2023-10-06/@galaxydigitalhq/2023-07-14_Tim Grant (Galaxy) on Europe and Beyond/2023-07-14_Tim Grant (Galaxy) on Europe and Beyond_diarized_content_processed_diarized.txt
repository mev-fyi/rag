00:00:04.120 - 00:00:49.806, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. Yo, I'm here with no fear, so I'm jumping feet first I'm flowing like a river, ever glowing, I deliver something golden from a quiver made of moments from the giver, yo. When I talk, hear a block, drip, and drop, bitcoin's a clock, you can hear it tick and tock, I'm trouble, see me bursting like a bubble, then I'm thirsting when I'm working on the camera like Hubble, flip a couple doubles when I'm Finna sing, man hanging with the one and only guy, Tim Grant. I'm crazy on the mic, you could call me swim fan cause I throw you in the pool like while you sink, man, bing bam, never messing with the ring, and you better not miss when you're coming for the king, man, battle me, haters never rattle me, I never need to mess around and call it in a cavalry. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital. Thank you for listening to Galaxy brains. We have a great show today.
00:00:49.806 - 00:01:19.728, Speaker A: Tim Grant is our guest, head of Europe, Middle east and Africa at Galaxy. He's back from across the pond to give us the update on what's happening in Europe and around the world. And we'll check in with our good friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading, as always, to discuss markets and macro.

Oh, man, this is a beat from 2010. Kind of a banger.
00:01:19.728 - 00:01:26.472, Speaker A: I think we should get right into the show. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, great to see you.
00:01:26.528 - 00:01:27.678, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:01:27.856 - 00:01:37.106, Speaker A: So we have what's going on in the market. We got some interesting stuff. Today's Wednesday, July 12. We had the CPI numbers. What happened? What do they look like?
00:01:37.210 - 00:02:02.484, Speaker B: Yeah, so we had a pretty soft inflation print. It was lower than expected. Core month on month printed at 0.2 versus expectations of a 0.3. And the unrounded was low as well. The key components that were dragging on these inflation figures relative to expectations at least, were things like airline prices and used autos.
00:02:03.544 - 00:02:14.624, Speaker A: Airline prices are down. It looked like a lot like double digit percent. I don't know if I'm seeing that, yeah. So, like on the ground, there's a.
00:02:14.704 - 00:03:08.604, Speaker B: Healthy amount of disillusionment over a lot of the government data that's published fair, for example, the owner's equivalent rent stuff. And just the housing figures in the CPI data. Folks are like, yeah, we were already expecting that to come down because we know it's a lagging indicator. And so how much weight do you put on it knowing that it's lagged? And people were already expecting it to come down. But I think the most important takeaways from this report is that inflation is headed in the right direction and that you are seeing drops in prices in areas of the economy that are sensitive to interest rates. But outside of that, it's a little bit trickier. In addition, I think a couple of things that are notable are you're going to start to lose some of the base effects that you had earlier this year.
00:03:08.604 - 00:03:30.784, Speaker B: You're not going to be losing really high prints from a year ago as you add numbers going forward. I think that's very notable. I also do think that housing's actually starting to rebound a bit and that you might eventually start seeing rents ticking up a bit and high level rents are still going up like six, seven, 8% a year. That's a lot. That is not sustainable.
00:03:30.864 - 00:03:31.344, Speaker A: That's crazy.
00:03:31.384 - 00:04:12.380, Speaker B: And the Fed is actively trying to tackle that and that has not gone away. If you think about parts of the economy, the service sector of the economy is still really hot. So all in all, this is a soft inflation number. But one, I don't think it's going to deter the Fed from hiking in July 2. There are aspects of the economy that are starting to show signs of reinflating and that is going to be a constant fear for the Fed and market participants. Anyway, besides this one soft reading, I think the price action afterwards was pretty notable. You had a pretty dramatic rally in fixed income.
00:04:12.380 - 00:04:22.036, Speaker B: The belly of the US curve rallied 15, 1617 basis points. That's pretty dramatic. The dollar index is off over a percent today.
00:04:22.100 - 00:04:25.944, Speaker A: So it's down. The dollar was coming down, coming down pretty hard.
00:04:26.324 - 00:04:57.776, Speaker B: One, that's a function of renewed speculation that the BOJ is going to increase the ban, that they allowed the ten year to trade in by another 50 basis points. So BoJ getting hawkish fears. And then two, it's like the US rates went down a lot and this could be the end of the Fed hiking cycle. And some folks are saying the hike in July could be the last one because we have disinflation and it's not a bad thing to have inflation coming down and people still having jobs. That's an okay scenario.
00:04:57.840 - 00:04:59.200, Speaker A: Labor market looks great right now.
00:04:59.272 - 00:05:05.680, Speaker B: If the labor market looks great and prices come down, then it's pretty much awesome. However, that's just not likely.
00:05:05.752 - 00:05:06.680, Speaker A: I know, I hear you.
00:05:06.792 - 00:05:09.128, Speaker B: It's just like, people get ahead of themselves.
00:05:09.176 - 00:05:30.680, Speaker A: I just like this. You use the word inflation and then you correctly and interestingly, I want to point out, use the word disinflation to describe the growth and inflation coming down, the deceleration. It's not negative inflation. It's still the presence of inflation. This is the thing that I just like. I know people know this, but some people don't really get this.
00:05:30.712 - 00:05:32.192, Speaker B: When we see inflation coming down, the.
00:05:32.208 - 00:05:50.842, Speaker A: Rate of price change, price increase is still increasing. It's increasing more slowly on a compounded annualized basis. We need to actually get to two or 3%. Don't we need to have negative months? Months where. Where inflation is negative in theory, to.
00:05:50.858 - 00:05:51.546, Speaker B: Get to the two.
00:05:51.610 - 00:05:53.042, Speaker A: That's what I'm saying. To get to the two.
00:05:53.098 - 00:05:53.410, Speaker B: Yes.
00:05:53.482 - 00:05:59.970, Speaker A: So I guess it's good that we're, like, 0.2 and not 0.3. That's getting pretty close to zero, I guess, on a month or month.
00:06:00.082 - 00:06:00.714, Speaker C: Yeah, right.
00:06:00.754 - 00:06:11.938, Speaker B: But it depends on how you slice it and dice it to. Okay. Like, electronic prices, like, are down a lot this year. And I was on Best Buy. I think I saw a 42 inch tv that was $150.
00:06:11.986 - 00:06:13.586, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I got really upset.
00:06:13.650 - 00:06:14.682, Speaker B: That stuff is down.
00:06:14.778 - 00:06:23.202, Speaker A: The 55 inch samsung I bought, like, five years ago, which is still a good tv. It's half the price that it was then. Half.
00:06:23.338 - 00:06:25.954, Speaker B: Right. But it's like, people already have tvs. Do they need them?
00:06:25.994 - 00:06:28.214, Speaker A: No. I know, and they also last a long time, too.
00:06:28.834 - 00:06:37.066, Speaker B: The other thing to think about is you do have student loan payments starting up again, at least the federal student loan payments, and that's a pretty sizable.
00:06:37.170 - 00:06:39.324, Speaker A: Is that September or October?
00:06:39.704 - 00:06:45.208, Speaker B: I think it's either August or September or October. It's within. I actually think it's September.
00:06:45.296 - 00:06:45.920, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:06:46.072 - 00:06:52.416, Speaker B: But I think the average us price is about $550 worth of monthly payments to make.
00:06:52.440 - 00:06:55.424, Speaker A: So that's income that is currently discretionary. Gonna become.
00:06:55.464 - 00:07:03.136, Speaker B: Yeah. It will go straight from, like, income to, you know, the loans or will come from excess savings.
00:07:03.200 - 00:07:03.804, Speaker A: Right.
00:07:04.224 - 00:07:05.640, Speaker B: And that should be a drag.
00:07:05.712 - 00:07:06.364, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:07:07.384 - 00:07:45.076, Speaker B: But again, if you look at what's been happening, corporates raise prices as long as people keep paying it. People keep paying it. Cause they still have jobs and people still spend because they have credit cards and they have room to run and they don't wanna change their lifestyles and stuff. And so there is a cycle where this stuff continues and persists. And a warning sign was last week when you had ADP report 400 plus thousand job gains. Although the, the actual BLS report on Friday reported less. They did show a pretty material increase in average hourly earnings.
00:07:45.076 - 00:08:08.642, Speaker B: And you're still running like 4% plus in average hourly earnings. Like inflation. Right. And so the labor market's hot. People have pricing power in the labor market. And so it's really tough to see a scenario where this stuff really cools off. Hence why I think today's probably an overreaction, if anything.
00:08:08.642 - 00:08:11.290, Speaker B: I mean, stocks going up to the dead highs of the year.
00:08:11.362 - 00:08:12.338, Speaker A: Is that where we went?
00:08:12.426 - 00:08:17.050, Speaker B: We went up to 45 20 in S and P. Wow.
00:08:17.122 - 00:08:17.418, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:08:17.466 - 00:08:21.094, Speaker B: And Nasdaq also hit high.
00:08:21.714 - 00:08:30.898, Speaker A: The market, in your opinion, was taking, is taking overly bullish view because it's like, yeah, okay, it came in under expectation, but it's still sticky.
00:08:31.066 - 00:08:57.904, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I think the most important thing is that, you know, the threat of reinflation is very real and the fed is hyper aware of that risk and they are going to stay higher for longer because that's what the economy necessitates. And you just look around the world like bank of England, they thought they had it in, and then it's like, oh, no, inflation's back, right? Like RBA and Bock stopped and then they kept going.
00:08:57.944 - 00:09:26.622, Speaker A: I know, we really need to, like, you got to quietly, like, stuff this monster back under the bed, right? You don't want him reappearing. All right, we're all calm. That's got to be really traumatic. Okay. Real quick, too. I mean, bitcoin looks like it's been mostly pinned, you see around like the mid 30 thousands. We've been chopping around for like, I think maybe three weeks at this point, basically between like 30 and 31 with a couple little dips and pops.
00:09:26.622 - 00:09:46.734, Speaker A: But what do you think? I mean, for the, what's your view on just your, directionally on bitcoin at this exact moment, you know, given we've got what, gox repayments in the fall. There was just the, there's some silk road. Bitcoins were moving, I guess, to be Twap sold by the DOJ probably currently. I don't know what else. What's your stance on this?
00:09:46.814 - 00:10:30.238, Speaker B: My stance is I do think that there's a healthy amount of long positioning that is in bitcoin, and that's why the rallies have been less than spectacular over the past couple of weeks, because it trades like a crowded position. Folks have this on whether it's in spot option form, whether it's in crypto related equities or whatever it may be. Basically, since the bitcoin ETF news came out and it's had a great year, crypto assets have done well and it's already up, like almost 90% on the year. So it's a really crowded trade that's done really well. That's at the dead highs. And in terms of the next positive catalyst, when are we going to get more ETF news?
00:10:30.286 - 00:10:32.698, Speaker A: Probably in weeks.
00:10:32.826 - 00:10:44.054, Speaker B: Weeks at least. And so there's an absence of catalysts and then we got a negative catalyst today that we weren't expecting. The Silk Road government tokens being sold.
00:10:45.194 - 00:10:56.642, Speaker A: We know, and this is like they announced in March they had about 50,000 coins to sell and they said they'd be doing it in tranches over the next year, which they've basically been doing 10,000 a quarter, looks like.
00:10:56.778 - 00:10:58.634, Speaker B: So here's their next tranche here.
00:10:58.674 - 00:10:59.706, Speaker A: But that didn't really.
00:10:59.890 - 00:11:33.194, Speaker B: It hasn't. It's a long day and bitcoin has moved down, you know, probably 400 points on this stuff, you know, so it's tough. It's tricky. I do think that, like, the ultimate direction is higher. I've never been. I'm very confident that this stuff is going to trend higher through year end, but right here, right now, fuel's a little crowded, you're at resistance and it's at year eight highs. So I think what you're supposed to do is just make sure your positions are measured.
00:11:33.194 - 00:12:05.016, Speaker B: In addition, take advantages of dips involved to maybe put on some upside structures. I also do think that the downside in bitcoin is certainly limited. Now with this looming ETF news, I think the bottom on crazy risk off headlines is at least north of 25k for me now. And so it definitely feels like a market that's trending. And long story short, trend's your friend. Buy on dips, sell on rallies.
00:12:05.160 - 00:12:09.936, Speaker A: There you go. Bibnet Abibi, our friend from Galaxy Digital trading. Thank you so much.
00:12:10.000 - 00:12:10.724, Speaker B: Pleasure.
00:12:11.344 - 00:12:16.864, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, Tim Grant, Galaxy's head of Europe, Middle east and Africa. Tim, our friend, great to have you back on galaxy brains.
00:12:16.904 - 00:12:18.920, Speaker C: It's always a pleasure, Alex, and you know it.
00:12:18.992 - 00:12:34.710, Speaker A: Welcome back to New York, too. Tim lives in the UK. How's it been going with Rishi Sunak as prime minister? I know that. Let's start right there, because. Yes, a lot of interesting stuff happening in the UK. And you were just telling me something really interesting about Rishi's upcoming election and what he's planning to do with web3.
00:12:34.822 - 00:12:53.584, Speaker C: Look, we talk with the UK government at various levels. You have to, as we do in the US, in the corridors of Washington. You're often down there. And I do the same thing in London. And I think the one news item that we all saw recently was the A 16 Z news. That was about, I think, two weeks ago. Two Mondays ago.
00:12:53.584 - 00:13:17.224, Speaker C: Yeah, it was in the FT, it was in the news. It was obviously amplified. Right. This was something that was kind of. It was bold, it was positive. And that's a big statement that they're bringing capital to London. They made a big statement about the talent and everything else that was, which is all the reasons that we often cite for London being an important international financial center.
00:13:17.224 - 00:13:39.078, Speaker C: And they're going to bring people. And we all know that's a term that, depending on who you ask, and it depends what your answer might be, but let's just call it, we hear that he's somewhat embracing the breadth of everything from metaverse to tokens to blockchain to crypto to AI. Like, that's the sort of broader.
00:13:39.166 - 00:13:42.470, Speaker A: So he's supportive, but he might, what, use these things in his campaign?
00:13:42.622 - 00:13:50.382, Speaker C: No, I don't think he will use them, but I think he. Well, I think he would. He would want to make that one of his pillars of reelection. Hey, I'm supportive of this.
00:13:50.438 - 00:13:53.006, Speaker A: The technology innovation pillar, 100%.
00:13:53.110 - 00:14:23.382, Speaker C: The UK has to be a leader. He was behind the statement when he was chancellor way back last April 2022, which now feels like a long, long time ago. It's not really that long ago that UK was going to be a big crypto hub. And that rhetoric has never faded. You have to give them credit. No one's ever said anything against that. And so the word is that he's going to lean into that as a means of appealing to the now very well documented six plus million people in the UK that own crypto.
00:14:23.382 - 00:15:11.250, Speaker C: And I think he's realizing, as any sane politician should, that this is a constituency you can't ignore. It's a youth vote, it's a progressive vote, it's a technology vote, it's a let's be a leader in the future vote. So we've heard this now, this, this, I think, aligned with the fact alongside a 16 z, that over the last few months, you've seen Brian Armstrong at Coinbase, tweeting about meeting with various government ministers, etcetera. The economic secretary of the treasury is kind of one of the key people here who works directly for the treasurer. We've met him and he's definitely pro. He's pro business, he's sort of pro progressiveness. And then you've also got Jeremy Hilaire at Circle, who's been out there making the round, and we'll talk Europe in a second.
00:15:11.250 - 00:15:52.810, Speaker C: But it's not just the UK, but they are definitively making the UK one of their stops. Now, let's just. We all know, everyone listening, I suspect, knows exactly why, but let's just say it out loud. If you're in the US and you're staring down the barrel of everything that we're looking at, that we've talked about a lot on various recent episodes, you have to, as we have to at Galaxy, think about your strategic options. And you look across the pond and you first land in London, and then you think about Paris, and then you think about the Middle east, and then you think about Hong Kong, and that's sort of the merry path these days. And Singapore gets a mention these days, but we can talk about that later. So that's the gist of the UK.
00:15:52.810 - 00:16:26.828, Speaker C: I think that the punchline is there's a feeling in London that's very different to the one in New York. Here we're like, oh, I'm so exasperated with this. When are we going to see the end of this? When are we going to see some sanity? When can we have a grown up conversation? I can tell you that we're having very grown up conversations with the treasury, but also the FCA. I love that we can sit across the table from the sea and have a really legitimate back and forth on what is this space about? Why is this good for UK Inc? And so we're feeling positive now, we.
00:16:26.836 - 00:16:41.850, Speaker A: Had talked last time you were on the show about HM's treasury giving all this guidance to the FCA on how to incorporate digital assets and how bullish that was. Have we seen progress on that implementation from the FCA yet, or is that still ongoing? Is that part of the conversations that you're talking about?
00:16:41.922 - 00:17:16.470, Speaker C: I think it's still ongoing, but I will say that. And look, we want to be respectful of the conversations we have with the FCA, but I will say it's right to be positive about the fact that over a three month horizon, six month horizon, the conversation has evolved from some of the more basic elements that we're all used to. To something, to stuff that's a bit more nuanced. Love that. So we're seeing some movement there. We're seeing a legitimate desire to talk about the things that are there. Philosophical reasons for not wanting to allow that.
00:17:16.470 - 00:17:41.974, Speaker C: Like, let's talk about. Let's go back to what is bitcoin? How does it have value? What about the now mountain of both academic and empirical literature, which tells you that liquidity isn't a problem? Market manipulation is less of an issue than a lot of other traditional markets that are fully regulated. So that's in no small part because precisely, as you said, the treasury is nudging.
00:17:42.514 - 00:17:44.738, Speaker A: Wow. Lots happening there in the UK.
00:17:44.906 - 00:17:45.962, Speaker C: Lot more positive, right?
00:17:46.018 - 00:18:01.254, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I mean, yeah, it is positive. The US is. I wouldn't say is super negative. I think it's clear. I think we have clarity on this, on the views that say the SEC has on crypto. We now know the mask is off. Right.
00:18:01.254 - 00:18:05.274, Speaker A: And it's not positive. But, you know, we're doing okay.
00:18:05.694 - 00:18:07.198, Speaker C: We're unknown risks, I suppose.
00:18:07.286 - 00:18:16.526, Speaker A: Yeah, it's ongoing. Let's hop across the channel. Let's talk about Europe a little bit. You were just in Zurich. We were talking about that. I love Zurich. I love the fondue in Zurich.
00:18:16.526 - 00:18:22.406, Speaker A: What were you doing? Did you get down to Crypto Valley? Zug. And what did you see in Zurich?
00:18:22.590 - 00:18:44.204, Speaker C: We always do, and it's always great to go to Switzerland because they've just have such a long standing love and appreciation for this movement, for what we're doing. They were among the first to really get the regulations right. A lot of the foundations were set up in Zug. A lot of the cantons. You can pay taxes in crypto. It's really very progressive. And there's a lot of crypto companies down there.
00:18:44.204 - 00:19:15.462, Speaker C: So, yeah, we were down in Switzerland and we were very excited, as everybody who's listening will have seen in the news. We have a big partnership with DWS, which we're excited about. DWS, trillion dollar asset manager. A real statement of intent from a publicly listed and owned 80% by Deutsche bank. It has to be said. Everybody knows this too. Institution that they are welcoming of crypto backed products, because we're going to start publicly with crypto backed etps in the swiss and the german markets.
00:19:15.462 - 00:19:28.770, Speaker C: But then we're going to evolve. We're going to evolve into active products, tokenization. We're looking at the stablecoin space, as we publicly said, as well. So they're in it to win it. This isn't just a little partnership.
00:19:28.802 - 00:19:30.482, Speaker A: They're not just like dipping their toes or whatever.
00:19:30.538 - 00:20:18.686, Speaker C: It's very serious. And Stefan Hoops, the CEO, if you go to his LinkedIn, has been very vocal about his support for this, and we really appreciate that. So he's one of us. So we went with DWSTC, some key wealth management clients in Zurich. So this is, you know, this is the, as far as I'm concerned, this is the, this is the coal face when it comes to this next move of how do you get the next trillion into our space? You got to crack that mechanism that goes through institutional players, institutional products to brokerage accounts in the biggest wealth management platforms in the world. But Switzerland obviously has its big fair share, and now there's an obvious player down there who's outsized in light of the recent swiss bank activity, of which there's really only one big one left. So we were down there.
00:20:18.686 - 00:21:25.792, Speaker C: Now, both us and DWs were positively surprised on the upside, at two things. One, they really loved the combination of DWS and galaxy, which told us, and I think we always intuitively knew this, like Galaxy, we believe, I think, that we have an important role to play in credentializing crypto and digital assets in the institutional world. That's a big role we play, but you have to come at it from the other side, and that's DWS, the trillion dollar asset manager have been doing their ex trackers, ETF's, for years. They're a trusted brand, they're Bafin regulated, which is a really top notch blue chip regulator, and now they're really taking crypto seriously. The two coming together, the feedback we got was, wow, this is what we've been waiting for, much more than we thought. We've always been bullish, but when you hear it from the clients directly, it's what we all know intuitively. And in some respects, one might, as a more libertarian idealist in our world, not want that to be true.
00:21:25.792 - 00:22:01.464, Speaker C: But the truth is, large pools of institutional money and high net worth money just uses that channel and won't go another way in the short run. So can we get them access to what we're doing through those channels? And so that was super encouraging to hear that. But the second thing that I think, I guess we also knew, intuitively knew, but was really encouraging. I'm just looking at our block clock here. These big figures matter. 30k matters, 35 matters, 40 will matter. We heard loud and clear from the biggest wealth management players.
00:22:01.464 - 00:22:35.096, Speaker C: They're like, yeah, volumes are quite muted right now, but in no way, shape or form are they sort of backing away from the space or wishing to not provide this to their clients. They have every view. And by the way, this conversation happened maybe two weeks ago. So it was before the recent kind of decent move up. Yeah, they know because they saw it in January and they saw it a couple of years ago and a couple of years before that. Like, make no mistake, if you're swiss and you have a bunch of money in a large wealth management player, the chances are someone's telling you about crypto.
00:22:35.160 - 00:22:35.520, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:35.592 - 00:23:21.490, Speaker C: When you've got zug and you've got Zurich and you've got just the general acceptance socially. So they've been knocking on the doors of their brokers saying, I want this payoff and they've had to go elsewhere. So they have this knowledge and they are absolutely, they strongly believe that at the point that a, the macro situation turns, we feel like the inflation cycle has been conquered, that the rate cycle has started to go in the right direction, and that we see a bump, which we know all of these things will be somewhat concurrent, that they're going to see a super reflexive demand from their big clients and they're preparing for it now, which this is again. Yes. Sometimes you think you're going to have a hard sell. No hard sell, no pushback whatsoever. Love to hear that.
00:23:21.522 - 00:23:42.144, Speaker A: I mean, they have a long history. Right. When I was in Zurich, it was in 2019. A ton had already been built by then. So yeah, they've seen the story play out. It's great that they finally are, it's great that they are building now for when demand really, really pours in. And I know it will, it will.
00:23:44.084 - 00:24:00.938, Speaker C: This is a great segue just into products. Right? So we've talked a lot about the ETF's and again, it's back. It's back in the everyone's. It sort of went away for a bit. We were like, okay, now it's back. Rightly so. The access, as you said, there's a sort of a next one, which is there's this huge multi trillion dollar structure, product market.
00:24:00.938 - 00:24:48.900, Speaker C: And I've mentioned this before, and I just think I have to mention it again, because traditional brokerage routes allow for just about any payoff structure on any asset very easily in a bankable security that goes through into your brokerage account. Super easy and really liquid and actually a great market to be in as a market maker and as a service provider. So there's vig in that market. We know that that hasn't been cracked. You can get your structured products payoffs, and obviously there's defi mechanisms, which is really exciting to do that now. But if you really want to do it through that Cefi route, it's still not there. What we're excited to see is more than green shoots now, I sort of mentioned it last time, but I'll up the ante from green shoot to seeing.
00:24:48.932 - 00:24:50.644, Speaker A: A little bit of some sprouts.
00:24:50.684 - 00:25:16.090, Speaker C: Little sprouts there. This is like, ooh, this is exciting. Nice. And it's growing, and you can see it moving on a scale that's not measured in years, it's more in months where we're going to get to a point where, and we're excited with galaxy because we're the biggest crypto derivatives player in the world. So we want to be the provider of that back end risk, have it all as much as you like. Any directions, any payoff structures will get as exotic as you like. But someone needs to wrap that.
00:25:16.090 - 00:25:48.046, Speaker C: That's how it works. Some GSIB type banks, some big credit worthy players who wealthy people will trust need to wrap that. And then it needs to be distributed. They could be sort of different legs. We're now seeing that line of sight, and those conversations in Zurich kind of confirm that, too. So, again, this isn't a tomorrow, but it's not a five years from now. It's like, I think, 2024, when we see that clock hit wherever it goes, but it's going to be 35 plus wealthy people, fomo all day long.
00:25:48.110 - 00:26:17.714, Speaker A: Yeah, this is great going around the world. Cause I've got more questions, too, about other places that you've been. Again, you are head of Europe, Middle east, and Africa. That's quite a large mandate there. Let's go down to the Middle east and tell us what's going on, particularly in the Emirates. Right, the various emirates, Dubai, Abu Dhabi. Well known for being progressive on crypto and crypto legislation, regulation, a lot of firms with business there.
00:26:17.714 - 00:26:21.830, Speaker A: You've been there recently. What's the story down there?
00:26:21.942 - 00:27:20.334, Speaker C: I have been there a lot in the last sort of 18 months or two years, more than I thought it was not a jurisdiction I knew a ton about before, and now I feel like really on top of it. First, let's talk about Dubai. That's the place most crypto native people will naturally assert is a friendly jurisdiction. And there's a lot of crypto native activity there, without a doubt. You don't have to go far to find friends in our space, and that really just remains the case. There's still an influx of people. There's still, I mean, more broadly, even outside of crypto, there's still this reasonably mass migrations, maybe a bit much, but there's a decent, consistent, constant migration of people to Abu Dhabi in Dubai because of the tax regime and just the general quality of living has gotten to the point where people really enjoy living there for families and everything, schooling and healthcare is all there.
00:27:20.334 - 00:27:46.916, Speaker C: And so that continues. But from a Dubai perspective, yes, lots of firms have moved there, but you have to remember that Dubai, yes, is wealthy. But in the Emirates, the big kahuna is the Abu Dhabi. They have all the money now, like. So you would never discount Dubai. I always call it. It's a bit like Vegas and Hong Kong 20 years ago mixed into one.
00:27:46.916 - 00:28:13.664, Speaker C: It's like people who know both of those things would be like, yeah, that sounds about right. It's just got a bright and unbridled enthusiasm and excitement. But, you know, you're starting to see traffic jams in Dubai for the first time because it's starting to get pretty big. Yeah, but, so Dubai, I think will always be a fixture. It'll be a place for people to go, especially if you're younger. That's where you want to go. The smart money, though, I think is starting to realize that Abu Dhabi is the place to be.
00:28:13.664 - 00:28:43.460, Speaker C: Now. If you get on and Google largest sovereign wealth pools of capital in the world, you'll be surprised how high up Abu Dhabi comes in that. I mean, really you're in the Norway's oil money, China and then pretty much Abu Dhabi. And the thing is they like a lot of these states, they have lots of different pools. Now it's an interesting comment. People often say, what about Saudi Arabia? Well, Saudi Arabia, yes, but 22,000 someone I'm sure out there will correct me. But it's in that quantum.
00:28:43.460 - 00:29:24.372, Speaker C: There's 22,000 people control all that money in Abu Dhabi. All that money is controlled by a very, like maybe a dozen royal family members led by one very powerful royal family member. And so this is a concentrated and therefore very strategic. They can be very deliberate. We want to do this and we'll do it quickly. So as an example, I was just down there with the world's biggest trader a few weeks ago, Jason Urban, who's on here before. And we went down there and the kind of reaction we got when we were going in and talking about what we might do in the region over the long term was it's almost like a game of phone.
00:29:24.372 - 00:29:49.384, Speaker C: Like we get in a meeting, we tell them what we're gonna do. But within 2 hours, several other agencies and pools of capital and regulators are all aware of that conversation and they're ready to come and talk to you now. You can't. That's really hard to see, that level of coordination anywhere else in the world. Like very quickly, very deliberate. They know what they're trying to do. And what they're trying to do is to ultimately diversify away from the oil.
00:29:49.384 - 00:30:23.444, Speaker C: They have to, and they will. And they're quite far down this path now. And one of their pillars is to attract technology companies and to be very progressive in our space in digital assets and crypto blockchain in general. And so ADGM, which is offshore, has a really solid regulatory regime. It's based in english law. It's something that the biggest law firms and the biggest financial institutions could be very, very comfortable with. We're not talking about certain other jurisdictions that I won't name where you're like, oh, I don't know if that's the right one or not.
00:30:23.444 - 00:30:43.280, Speaker C: This is legit. There's no reason not to be in Abu Dhabi. And so that's the sort of that first element. But the second element is just we're seeing the people who are moving there. Like binance is there. They have most of their people there, I think hundreds of people in Abu Dhabi quietly. And look, a lot of people kind of commute from Abu Dhabi, but in Dubai.
00:30:43.280 - 00:31:04.936, Speaker C: But the entities Abu Dhabi. But there are others. Brevin Howard, who's one of our brethren in this space, they've got 130 people that they're building out there. And the list goes on. And there's more coming. Like a lot of the names I mentioned earlier in the UK that are going through the UK, in Paris, they will go through Abu Dhabi. There's so many.
00:31:04.936 - 00:31:41.270, Speaker C: So often you walk in and you're like, oh, X, Y and Z were here just last week. So it's a well trodden path for a very good reason. We all get the joke that they're very open, but you have to end on this like the capital. The sheer amount of capital you cannot ignore. And this is a broader sort of geopolitical statement. That amount of capital, when it's sophisticated, and Abu Dhabi is now super sophisticated, the old statements around, you know, you could fly in and fly out and you'll just get a bunch of money. It doesn't hold.
00:31:41.270 - 00:32:12.874, Speaker C: Like, the leaders in Abu Dhabi are educated in the finest establishments in the UK and the US, they understand what we're doing. They understand the nuances. They negotiate hard for good reason. Cause they have the capital, and so they should, but they have influence. And just look at what's going on with Neom in Saudi Arabia. Like, we'll get, well, we'll just build a ski resort in the middle of the desert, or we'll build 150 kilometer long city. And.
00:32:12.914 - 00:32:15.170, Speaker A: Yeah, the line, I love that city.
00:32:15.242 - 00:32:15.866, Speaker C: They're gonna do it.
00:32:15.890 - 00:32:16.338, Speaker A: The line.
00:32:16.426 - 00:32:19.722, Speaker C: Isn't it just the best concept? Let's just build a straight line.
00:32:19.778 - 00:32:21.934, Speaker A: It's just beautifully huge.
00:32:22.474 - 00:32:30.218, Speaker C: Such wonderful hubris. But then, right, you go back to, you know, I remember 2006, seven, eight, when they were talking about building the palm.
00:32:30.306 - 00:32:30.858, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:32:30.986 - 00:32:32.330, Speaker C: And you're like, well, that's just, you're right.
00:32:32.362 - 00:32:33.994, Speaker A: People thought that was absolutely crazy.
00:32:34.034 - 00:32:34.330, Speaker C: I did.
00:32:34.362 - 00:32:42.892, Speaker A: I was like, well, that's just, now I just go on Google Earth and I look, they get the whole, they got the world one too. That's like, they got two. Two pom poms. Yeah, it's really cool.
00:32:43.028 - 00:32:44.956, Speaker C: And so they follow through. They really did.
00:32:44.980 - 00:32:45.164, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:32:45.204 - 00:33:18.816, Speaker C: Now they've got the intent, they've learned from this. So don't be surprised on a 1015 year horizon that there'll be more of this, that there'll be buying into more companies, attracting more. And I think the smart money is leaning into that. Oh, and the last thing I should call about is mining. You know, this public, they've got, you know, they look, they've obviously got the oil, but they've also got the sun and lots of it, and they've got lots of space and everything. Stay controlled in a commercially sort of positive way. So they've got cheap electricity.
00:33:18.816 - 00:33:29.856, Speaker C: And so to them, it's just a sensible commercial equation. Well, in that case, I'm going to set up a honking great big mining rig. And that's what we've seen. We've seen that happen. That's not an aspiration.
00:33:29.920 - 00:33:34.234, Speaker A: Yeah. The Middle east is growing in general in bitcoin mining. A lot of you should see that.
00:33:34.274 - 00:33:35.682, Speaker C: More of that, I think. Yeah, yeah.
00:33:35.818 - 00:33:37.858, Speaker A: Wow. Just crazy. I gotta get out there.
00:33:37.986 - 00:33:39.026, Speaker C: I think you should.
00:33:39.210 - 00:33:54.178, Speaker A: It's amazing the amount of stuff. And also, without getting too much into the intricacy here, but the way they've set up, I think, in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, these regulatory jurisdictions and mini jurisdictions is extremely favorable for business in general, right?
00:33:54.226 - 00:34:12.404, Speaker C: Very much so. There's free zones or offshore zones, which, you know, the onshore zones have pretty decent tax regimes by any one standard, but the free zones have effectively zero. Everything capital gains, zero income tax, and.
00:34:12.404 - 00:34:19.156, Speaker A: They have, like, faster regulatory decisions there in sandboxes and stuff, but no less rigorous. Right.
00:34:19.220 - 00:34:23.116, Speaker C: That's the thing. Not shaky. Right.
00:34:23.140 - 00:34:26.527, Speaker A: It's not rubber stamps. It's just, but it's, it's thoughtful and it's.
00:34:26.655 - 00:34:27.775, Speaker C: They just work through it.
00:34:27.879 - 00:34:30.863, Speaker A: Yeah. Really interesting man. And they move quickly.
00:34:30.943 - 00:34:34.903, Speaker C: They move quickly. And that's why I think that's the, that's the edge now.
00:34:34.983 - 00:34:35.359, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:35.431 - 00:34:40.943, Speaker C: If you have the capital, but you move slowly and with plenty of examples of that, then. Well, so much for having all that capital.
00:34:41.023 - 00:34:41.303, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:41.343 - 00:34:47.167, Speaker C: I think they've figured out that we need to be, we have, we need velocity of decision making with our capital.
00:34:47.255 - 00:34:47.567, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:47.615 - 00:35:37.072, Speaker C: And they're already, they've seen the results already over the last few years, so now they're just leaning into it. I think we'll see a lot more news in the next couple of years coming out of there and lots more players moving down there and things like the Abu Dhabi stock Exchange, which amazingly has attracted some of the biggest listings in the world this year now, albeit they're very large UAE and Middle Eastern companies. That still tells you something. You know, like, let's not call the death of Nasdaq, Lse, et cetera, just yet. Yeah. But let's say there's a new kid in town who's got a bunch of money, who's pretty switched on, who's gonna want to be an important financial hub on a ten year horizon, and I wouldn't bet against them.
00:35:37.128 - 00:35:45.624, Speaker A: Yeah. Wow. So should we keep traveling? Is there anywhere else you wanna talk about Hong Kong a little bit? Tell me about Hong Kong. You've also been there recently.
00:35:45.744 - 00:35:55.106, Speaker C: We should. I actually haven't been down there in a while, but because of, because of our proximity, we love to partner with our colleagues down in the Hong Kong office.
00:35:55.130 - 00:36:41.892, Speaker A: And there's, my cursory understanding is that there was a new regulatory regime introduced for crypto there that was a way for exchanges to register officially and offer trading to retail. That is also rigorous, but it has a pathway forward, and apparently that's been causing a lot of excitement and people are getting back into it. And it's a big shift. Shift from just like a year and a half ago, even obviously, of the crackdowns on mainland China, but then in mainland China on crypto. But then Hong Kong was not feeling very welcoming for a while either. Maybe along those same lines, but now. Has it flipped? Is that what's happened? Is this a durable, do we believe this is a long term durable thing? What is happening?
00:36:42.028 - 00:37:23.978, Speaker C: Well, I think the one thing you have to be, before you answer that question, you have to acknowledge that you're dealing with China and therefore you don't know what's gonna happen next. And that just is what it is. But I think you'll talk to our colleagues in Hong Kong and businesses down there and you're right, the tail end of their pandemic kind of lasted longer than everybody else because of just the way they handled it. Starting to be a distant memory of this pandemic. But for them, it wasn't that long ago that things opened up and there was this really, like, I remember this sort of trudgery at one point of like, firstly, we still can't go out. We still gotta wear masks. And secondly, crypto's Persona non grata.
00:37:23.978 - 00:37:54.480, Speaker C: Like, it just went from being a great place to do it to a really not good place to do it. And then now here we are again, and everybody's got a spring in their step down in Hong Kong. And you're right, like new. And it's so amazing how quickly these things can happen and shift. It's actually a broader, a broader statement on our space. Like the speed of things. It's not measured in sort of the quarters and years and decades that it used to be in the 20th century in tradfi.
00:37:54.480 - 00:38:18.964, Speaker C: Oh, well, that legislation might come in and change in five years time. Oh, mifid two's. Mifid one's coming in and we're all sitting there forever. It takes years. Everyone's just preparing for this stuff. This is like, well, 1 minute it is, in 1 minute it's not, or vice versa. So, yes, there's the various registration mechanisms that are now more tractable and obvious and just more grown up.
00:38:18.964 - 00:38:37.120, Speaker C: But I think the other big news that we've seen, and I think we're still trying to bottom this one out. There's a little bit of speculation on what's going on here, but things like there was a news item recently about Standard Chartered and HSBC and the Hong Kong banks being in some way leaned upon. Yeah.
00:38:37.152 - 00:38:40.568, Speaker A: Encouraged to bank crypto, bank crypto companies.
00:38:40.736 - 00:38:48.744, Speaker C: Now that just that isolated fact alone stands Hong Kong out from just about everywhere else almost. Yeah.
00:38:48.904 - 00:38:57.664, Speaker A: It seemed like a very strategic, even geopolitical maneuver. At the same time, obviously, as the US was cracking down on bank activity.
00:38:57.704 - 00:39:16.266, Speaker C: In crypto, Occam's razor like that, probably what was going on. Let's nudge on. I mean, you know what it's like in China. It wouldn't be hard for someone in the chinese government to give a call to the CEO's of those banks and say, look, we want to be competitive. This is a great space. Just tell your onboarding people to take.
00:39:16.290 - 00:40:18.948, Speaker A: A little bit of an prohibition in general, like, I mean, on anything, not just on financial innovation and cryptocurrencies, but doesn't work, right? Typically, if it's something people want, I mean, look at alcohol, obviously, right? Speakeasies all across the entire country in the twenties. If people want it, prohibition doesn't work. So better than if you were of concerns about it as a jurisdiction or a nation state. Bring it in, bring it in. Create a sensible rulemaking to regulate and protect consumers, et cetera, but also give you insight into it. Why not have it there? And it also looks to me like if I'm really any american adversary, or even, I don't even say adversary, but competitor, competitor, if I see something that the US doesn't like and is perhaps threatened by, I'm instantly looking into that. And if it looks like that the US jurisdiction is going to be hostile to crypto for whatever reason, that's a wedge that they may have, that they can gain an advantage on us.
00:40:18.948 - 00:40:32.370, Speaker A: And I think everyone knows this, and it's just crazy to see it happen so quickly because again, we were talking, I mean, I about was already at Galaxy in the summer of 2021 when the bitcoin mining ban happened in China, and it was a totally different environment.
00:40:32.522 - 00:40:35.178, Speaker C: And that was out of nowhere, too. That was the same thing. Like, wait, what?
00:40:35.266 - 00:41:17.362, Speaker A: They never really fully banned it. We later found out. But I mean, like, you know, still it seems like a very different regime. And even recently, there was this paper in China that was released, and I am more than a novice on like, the hierarchical and government structures in the chinese government and society. But apparently in sort of a government sponsored technology journal, a big supportive web3 policy paper was put out. And I'm told that that really wouldn't have happened. It's not that they would have put out bad stuff, but it's like that paper probably doesn't come out if there's not general enthusiasm and at least acceptance to be looking into it, let alone possibly even becoming a leader in it.
00:41:17.478 - 00:42:18.548, Speaker C: We know this to be true, right? You don't do that and get away with it if it's not sanctioned in some way. But I think the theme you're hitting on is the theme du jour outside of the US, in my opinion. It's, wow, look at what's going over in the US, that looks tricky. If you look at your little progressive ometer of the UK of various EU states with Mika coming in with Switzerland, with Abu Dhabi, Dubai with Singapore, with Singapore to some extent, which we're hearing there's a thawing that's worthy of quick note that a couple of shops that have been in the queue waiting for Singapore to come through, I think circle might have been one of them, if I'm not mistaken. But it's in that level of large global firm is getting the licenses that they applied for. And Hong Kong, wait a minute, they're all kind of in general neutral to positive. More positive than neutral at the moment.
00:42:18.596 - 00:42:20.140, Speaker A: And definitely more positive than the US.
00:42:20.212 - 00:42:24.372, Speaker C: And definitely more positive than the US. Now that's the rest of the world and most of the world.
00:42:24.428 - 00:42:36.464, Speaker A: That's what I'm saying. These are not backwater states. These are primal global financial centers and legal centers and thought leadership intellectual centers.
00:42:36.854 - 00:42:37.190, Speaker C: Right?
00:42:37.222 - 00:43:00.774, Speaker A: I mean, I'm not going to pick a random country to dunk on here, but it's not some tiny little random jurisdiction. These are major, major places. And that's when you just have to sort of, you have to realize that, you know, whether it's regulators or american policymakers like you understand when you're in your day to day, you can get myopic and it can be hard to step back and see a greater picture. And frankly, maybe seeing a bigger picture is outside your mandate.
00:43:00.894 - 00:43:01.270, Speaker C: Right.
00:43:01.342 - 00:43:07.582, Speaker A: But it's one of these things that's upsetting, because if you do step back and look at the bigger picture, we're the exception.
00:43:07.678 - 00:43:38.800, Speaker C: It looks that way. It looks that way, and it enters into a debate around what is everyone trying to really do? Because if you look at, for instance, back to where we started in the UK, well, the answer is clear what they're trying to do. They're trying to promote a pathway, a grassroots movement from universities all the way through that produces talent, that allows this to become a. A humming industry and a driver of economic growth. In that jurisdiction, it's really black and white. That's been done before.
00:43:38.872 - 00:43:45.084, Speaker A: Competitiveness and, yeah, entrepreneurship, business, no question about it. And that's a sensible policy.
00:43:45.464 - 00:43:56.616, Speaker C: And I think that feels the similar vibe across the rest of the world. But what are we doing here in the US? That can't be the objective for us. We wouldn't do it this way.
00:43:56.640 - 00:44:13.004, Speaker A: We've got the primary financial services regulator just basically suing everyone in courts all over the country, which, by the way, I pointed out recently on Bloomberg TV, like that's a risky strategy for the SEC also, which is crazy. I mean, cause no matter how good your case is, like, going to court is a roll of the dice.
00:44:13.544 - 00:44:14.696, Speaker C: Like the statistical.
00:44:14.800 - 00:44:49.686, Speaker A: When they could, they could have done what, like the FCA has been starting to do and what MAs and others and then Europeans, like, like get folks together and have a rulemaking conversation and develop something that works for both sides, achieves your of goals. Like that's something where you can actually, as a regulator, by the way, assert your authority, have control, get an outcome that makes sense and supports Capitol formation. Like who knows what's going to happen in these court cases, right? Even the SEC doesn't know theoretically. Like, the rulings could be so bad that their authority is significantly hampered, eroded. It could actually like backfire on them for all we know.
00:44:49.710 - 00:44:52.150, Speaker C: I mean, it's a real, it's a real potential outcome.
00:44:52.182 - 00:44:55.614, Speaker A: Isn't it strange, like reckless kind of strategy in my opinion.
00:44:55.654 - 00:45:29.340, Speaker C: That, and you mentioned prohibition. Yes. What do we now know for sure? Doesn't really work in the long run. Might work in the short run is prohibition and regulation by enforcement rather than progressive engagement. And look, since I started a galaxy almost two years ago, it's a different, I'm sanguine because I look back to that and I think, wow, this is a better place. Look at the things we're doing, which we weren't doing two years ago. Look at the number of people that are definitively engaged in our space and aren't going away.
00:45:29.340 - 00:45:54.094, Speaker C: And look at that price and look at the fact that the leverage is out of the system and there's all this institutional money on the sidelines. And now there's jurisdictions that will allow that to come in. You can't help but be bullish. We've always got to be careful. Let's not drink vast amounts of our own Kool aid. But I'm here to be a bullish, you know, cautiously, bullishly optimistic message delivery today.
00:45:54.174 - 00:46:01.070, Speaker A: Tim Grant, our man. Where in the world is Tim Grant? Thank you for that, that journey around the world, Tim. And great to have you on galaxy brains.
