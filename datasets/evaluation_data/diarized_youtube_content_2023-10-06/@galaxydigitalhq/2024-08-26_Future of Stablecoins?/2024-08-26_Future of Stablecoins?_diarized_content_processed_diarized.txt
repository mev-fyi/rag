00:00:00.280 - 00:00:27.187, Speaker A: Dollar domination in the so called offshore Eurodollar market is a real phenomenon. And the euro dollar market is so complicated, it's so opaque, there is no really good research about it. Estimates say that Eurodollar market is around $20 trillion. So imagine if you can have like offshore dollar issuance in a way more systematic and transparent way, how big that could be. Yeah, it could be. So I think we are the best friends of the US Treasuries. I don't think we are the best friends of commercial banks because we are reinventing.
00:00:27.187 - 00:00:50.115, Speaker A: You are creating money. We are reinventing monetary intermediation. Yeah, but we, I think we are truly good friends of Treasuries that have. Because I think in the same way Bitcoin is so widely spread because it's trusted in the same like US Treasuries are commonly used as collateral across the world because people trust the solvency of the US Government.
