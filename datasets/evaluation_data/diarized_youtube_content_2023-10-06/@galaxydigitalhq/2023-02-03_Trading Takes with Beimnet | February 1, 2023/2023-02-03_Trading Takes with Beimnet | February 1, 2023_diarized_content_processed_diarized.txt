00:00:06.960 - 00:00:10.950, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bibnett, a BB from Galaxy Digital trading. As always, my friend, good to see you.
00:00:11.062 - 00:00:12.070, Speaker B: Thank you for having me.
00:00:12.142 - 00:00:13.118, Speaker A: Big day today.
00:00:13.206 - 00:00:13.966, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:00:14.070 - 00:00:25.526, Speaker A: Wednesday, February 1. It's not January anymore. Wow. Month two. New monthly candle started. The Federal Reserve FOMC, I guess was the meeting today. Certainly they put out their decision on rates today.
00:00:25.526 - 00:00:25.910, Speaker A: What happened?
00:00:25.942 - 00:00:55.608, Speaker C: Yes, the FOMC decision came out today. The Fed hiked rates by 25 basis points. They guided that they are likely to do more hikes in the future. Powell had a press conference as well after the statement was released. I think the press conference was fairly dovish, and the market is interpreting it as dovish. Essentially, he had to acknowledge the fact that the inflation data has started to turn. There are constructive developments in the labor market.
00:00:55.608 - 00:00:57.816, Speaker C: They had employment cost index that came.
00:00:57.840 - 00:01:00.124, Speaker B: Out yesterday that was a little softer.
00:01:00.874 - 00:01:02.978, Speaker C: And so there's a lot of things.
00:01:03.106 - 00:01:06.242, Speaker B: That are suggesting that you have sort.
00:01:06.258 - 00:01:08.722, Speaker C: Of a Goldilocks situation where you have.
00:01:08.818 - 00:01:12.602, Speaker B: Prices coming down and employment not ticking up that high.
00:01:12.698 - 00:01:13.226, Speaker D: Unemployment.
00:01:13.290 - 00:01:18.146, Speaker C: Unemployment picking up that high. And so basically the market and the.
00:01:18.170 - 00:01:19.994, Speaker B: Fed kind of make it seem like.
00:01:20.034 - 00:01:23.146, Speaker C: Goldilocks is in really within reach.
00:01:23.210 - 00:01:25.018, Speaker A: It's in reach. The soft landing.
00:01:25.146 - 00:01:39.922, Speaker B: Soft landing, however you want to think about it. And then you couple that with an insane level of under positioning in risk assets. I mean, I was telling guys this on the floor, but you're talking about.
00:01:39.978 - 00:01:50.854, Speaker C: Trillions of dollars that are defensively positioned that all of a sudden the world's most important central banker. The most important central banker basically gave you a green light to buy risk assets today.
00:01:51.634 - 00:01:54.210, Speaker B: Does he think that he knows it.
00:01:54.282 - 00:01:54.794, Speaker A: He knows it.
00:01:54.834 - 00:01:55.810, Speaker B: He knows it.
00:01:55.962 - 00:01:57.906, Speaker C: They're too smart. They watch the price action.
00:01:57.970 - 00:01:58.378, Speaker A: They know.
00:01:58.426 - 00:02:10.090, Speaker B: He basically, when he walked into the press conference today, he had a decision to make. Do I get so aggressive enough where I need, like, I try to take stocks down?
00:02:10.122 - 00:02:12.186, Speaker A: Yeah, like mean talk following a soft raise.
00:02:12.250 - 00:02:28.540, Speaker B: But he got asked a question about stocks. Literally was the first at the moment. It wasn't that. It was like, I forgot the exact specifics, but it was basically like, financial conditions are easing. That's counterproductive to your goal of slowing down inflation. How are you thinking about them? And basically you gave like a nonchalant.
00:02:28.572 - 00:02:34.052, Speaker C: Answer that monetary policy works well, lag. They're monitoring a number of things, and.
00:02:34.108 - 00:02:37.476, Speaker B: We'Ll see how, like, that stuff develops. So essentially, he didn't take the opportunity.
00:02:37.500 - 00:02:38.548, Speaker C: To be like, no, stocks need to.
00:02:38.556 - 00:02:40.612, Speaker B: Be like 5% lower. They'll never say that.
00:02:40.668 - 00:02:43.436, Speaker A: But he said previous one yeah, basically.
00:02:43.540 - 00:02:54.204, Speaker C: A reporter in two FOMC meetings ago, I believe I told him that stocks and bonds were rallying during the meeting, and he proceeded to literally talk through five talking points about why stocks and.
00:02:54.244 - 00:02:55.916, Speaker B: Bonds shouldn't, shouldn't be rallying.
00:02:55.980 - 00:02:56.468, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:02:56.596 - 00:03:07.204, Speaker B: And so it was a very different tone. You could tell that there was definitely a change, not a pivot, but a.
00:03:07.244 - 00:03:12.372, Speaker C: Movement along towards Goldilocks soft landing and less hawkish rhetoric.
00:03:12.468 - 00:03:30.144, Speaker B: And you could see it not only in the text and what he's actually saying, but his demeanor, how he was thinking about inflation. The tone was just so different. It's really tough to appreciate these things unless you are a consistent follower. But markets don't lie.
00:03:30.184 - 00:03:31.184, Speaker C: They're ripping like crazy.
00:03:31.224 - 00:03:34.528, Speaker B: Nasdaq's up 3% here. We had some company earnings that were.
00:03:34.576 - 00:03:37.424, Speaker C: Reported after the bell today, and stocks.
00:03:37.464 - 00:04:02.104, Speaker B: Have only continued to rally thereafter. I mean, bitcoin as we speak is testing 23%. 800. And I think this move probably has some more room to run. I'm thinking probably something along lines of 4300 in s and P. That's 150 plus points away. Probably at least 25k on bitcoin.
00:04:02.104 - 00:04:10.320, Speaker B: I don't even know where the offer side is on bitcoin. Who on earth would be selling risk assets right now when the majority of.
00:04:10.392 - 00:04:12.528, Speaker C: The world's money managers are underweight risk.
00:04:12.576 - 00:04:16.262, Speaker B: Assets, they're being told to buy them by the most important central bank.
00:04:16.438 - 00:04:18.118, Speaker C: Why is there an offer on that.
00:04:18.166 - 00:04:22.474, Speaker B: Unless you're taking profit? So I'm about as bullish as I've been.
00:04:24.414 - 00:04:27.374, Speaker C: On however scale you want to.
00:04:27.414 - 00:04:29.354, Speaker A: At least in the last several months. Yes.
00:04:30.054 - 00:04:33.422, Speaker B: Basically the number one rule in markets is don't fight the Fed.
00:04:33.518 - 00:04:35.486, Speaker A: And the Fed is telling you what to do here.
00:04:35.510 - 00:04:43.774, Speaker B: The Fed is like, they didn't tell you to sell stocks, which means you have to buy them. Cause if you're not long it, you're short.
00:04:43.814 - 00:04:50.448, Speaker C: It's in my head, at least. And the way I would describe it is basically you have every single person.
00:04:50.536 - 00:05:29.014, Speaker B: That'S investing assets in the world looking at their portfolios today and looking at, holy shit, am I long? The stuff that's been moving up the most. And the answer is, I'm not long enough of that stuff. If you're a bond manager and you have liabilities going out ten plus years and you're sniffing that, the Fed might be slowing down or cutting, and you're like, oh, my God. This might be my last opportunity to buy bonds on a four handle. Oh, my God. This might be my last opportunity to buy bonds on a three handle. If you miss that opportunity now, it will cost you for decades to come.
00:05:29.314 - 00:05:30.930, Speaker C: If you're a reserve manager buying long.
00:05:30.962 - 00:05:33.334, Speaker A: Dated stuff, long dated stuff, like the.
00:05:34.354 - 00:05:42.556, Speaker B: Ten year bonds can go from 340 to like 250. So quickly? So quickly.
00:05:42.620 - 00:05:43.220, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:05:43.372 - 00:05:48.148, Speaker B: And if you miss that and you're a huge bond manager, that's your whole job.
00:05:48.236 - 00:05:48.532, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:05:48.588 - 00:05:49.540, Speaker A: You had one job.
00:05:49.692 - 00:06:02.152, Speaker B: One job. And that's to, you know, buy bonds when they were reasonably cheap because what have we known about bonds is they were in a 40 year bull market. They only go down. You're going to be hunting for yield in about a year and a half.
00:06:02.278 - 00:06:02.868, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:06:02.996 - 00:06:24.012, Speaker B: And if you don't get it now, it's like. And then same thing. It's like there's so many trades. Like everyone on the planet got long dollars last year and it's still overweight dollars. And they're trying to get into trades like long euro or short dollar yen, and you're just not getting the opportunities. Like, I mean, euro is, I think, testing like 110 right now. You got bank of England that's about to be hawkish tomorrow.
00:06:24.012 - 00:06:34.018, Speaker B: Like, it could be a 112 by the end of the week. And you're a reserve manager that put all your money in dollars and you haven't twitched yet. And the magnitude and the pace of these moves are going to catch people.
00:06:34.066 - 00:06:38.058, Speaker C: Offsides, I think for me, keep it simple.
00:06:38.146 - 00:06:44.934, Speaker B: Buy risk assets. Buy convexity in risk assets and, yeah, it's time.
00:06:45.594 - 00:06:45.970, Speaker D: Wow.
00:06:46.002 - 00:07:13.166, Speaker A: It's come a long way. I mean, we were talking, I remember us talking in June. You said you hadn't been this bearish in a long time, then you got bullish in July, then we've sort of been trucking along here through the fall, which in crypto had idiosyncratic events that impacted it. Bitcoin and ETH ran all of January, sort of like almost a reversion to where they should have been. And you think there's still room to run.
00:07:13.270 - 00:07:32.916, Speaker B: Absolutely. It's just a simple function of what does risk reward look like in these assets? You look at bitcoin, if it's floored at 20k, you are, 15% from 20k is the downside. What, are you going to go short it? Try to make 15% on an asset that has no upside and it was.
00:07:32.940 - 00:07:33.724, Speaker A: Already down a lot.
00:07:33.764 - 00:08:00.260, Speaker B: It's already down a lot. What are you going to do then at 23k, you're like, this is an asset that's traded at 68k before it's risk on. Whoa. And then you're like, okay, what's been doing well this year? Bitcoin's up 40%, has one of the best risk adjusted returns out there. It trades over $30 billion a day. Deeply liquid spot and derivatives. Market like shit should be on the radio.
00:08:00.260 - 00:08:02.740, Speaker B: Where are people probably freaking out right now.
00:08:02.812 - 00:08:05.172, Speaker C: And I'm using the PG words to.
00:08:05.188 - 00:08:15.624, Speaker B: It, especially anybody that's in crypto world that's benchmarked to an index, that is crypto. Full crypto, no cash in it. Most people are underperforming.
00:08:16.204 - 00:08:18.212, Speaker C: Couldn't have been full length, or you're.
00:08:18.228 - 00:08:21.344, Speaker A: Not going to be levered at the start of the year. You're going to be all bitcoin and ETH.
00:08:22.924 - 00:08:31.388, Speaker B: But still, if you're, like, measuring your returns versus stuff, like you're underweight, you're forced to chase here. You're a dip buyer.
00:08:31.476 - 00:08:32.184, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:08:32.684 - 00:08:33.260, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:08:33.292 - 00:08:35.144, Speaker B: I mean, I think stuff's on the wrong handles.
00:08:38.044 - 00:08:39.344, Speaker C: I gotta calm down.
00:08:39.804 - 00:08:49.972, Speaker B: Normally is your super bowl. It is a big day, and you have to remember rules and try not to get emotional. Like, buying at the highs is normally a very stupid thing in markets, especially.
00:08:50.028 - 00:08:51.424, Speaker C: In mean, reverting ones.
00:08:52.004 - 00:09:14.104, Speaker B: But I have to say, this does feel a bit different. You are taking out significant resistance levels and support levels in traditional markets. The breaks are there, the catalyst is there. That's all you need. All of markets really comes down to a chart and a story, and both of those things looking good right now.
