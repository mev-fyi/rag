00:00:08.080 - 00:00:12.126, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to galaxy brains.
00:00:12.190 - 00:00:13.078, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:13.166 - 00:00:24.726, Speaker A: So I guess, you know, you see over my shoulder in the block clock, you know, we're unchanged basically week over week in bitcoin. But we did have macro news today. We had CPI. What was the reading? What happened?
00:00:24.830 - 00:00:50.974, Speaker B: Yeah, inflation came in slightly higher than expected. Core inflation in particular printed a 0.3 month on month versus expectations of 0.2. Headline came in at 0.6%, which is very high. The market reaction to it has been a little confusing. Initially, rates moved higher and then they moved lower.
00:00:50.974 - 00:01:10.152, Speaker B: Same thing with stocks. They sold off because inflation means higher for longer, more aggressive Fed policy. And now they're actually up on the day. And so it's one of those numbers that I think people looked at. They're like, inflation's still hot, but we have tight monetary policy, so it's really not going to change things too much.
00:01:10.208 - 00:01:11.440, Speaker A: It wasn't high enough to change things.
00:01:11.472 - 00:01:27.338, Speaker B: Wasn't high enough. In terms of specific highlights from the report, airline fares showed a pretty dramatic jump after a pretty weak July. They were up 4.9% month on month versus being down 8% the prior period. That's a lot.
00:01:27.386 - 00:01:27.954, Speaker A: Month over month.
00:01:27.994 - 00:02:02.068, Speaker B: Month over month. Yeah, that 5%. Basically. That's a big, big jump. In addition, headlines up because oil prices have been moving a lot higher. You've got WTI crude at $89 a barrel and brent like 91, and that impacts a ton of things. And then most importantly though, the area that folks, the everyday person is most concerned with is like shelter, and you still had a pretty reasonable rise in owner's equivalent rent of 0.4%
00:02:02.068 - 00:02:30.624, Speaker B: month on month. And then the Fed is really focused on inflation x services, inflation x shelter. So without including the housing component and the services portion of the core CPI was 0.4 month on month too. A reasonably firm reading. And then throw that together with a labor market that's historically one of the tightest ever. And it's like, yeah, hire for longer still makes sense.
00:02:30.624 - 00:03:26.042, Speaker B: But there's so much baked in in terms of cuts that given the absolute levels of where we're at, I think you can still justify those kind of cuts because, you know, for example, the one year, one year interest rate forward puts us interest rates at 430, which is 100 basis points lower than where we're at now and change. And so I could easily see us cutting 100 basis points in nine months from now or a year 16 months, that kind of stuff. And so I think that right now the market is kind of fairly priced in a lot of different areas. The dollar has had a huge move. It's rallied a lot. I still think that's the, the path of least resistance. But this week you actually got pretty dramatic pushback from the BOJ and from the PBOC or China in general.
00:03:26.042 - 00:03:50.704, Speaker B: The BOJ talked about the end of negative interest rates over the weekend. They talked about it, yes, in the context of if we achieve our inflation target, which they're above, but they're like consistent, staying in that inflation, they'll consider raising from negative interest rates. And then the Chinese basically were telling.
00:03:50.784 - 00:03:56.072, Speaker A: Folks to sell dollars and they took some defensiveness there.
00:03:56.128 - 00:04:42.906, Speaker B: Defensiveness, absolutely. And that's just the reality of trading dollars, is you've got lots of folks that have an incentive to defend their currency, that have huge dollar reserves. And so as we go higher in these currency rates, you will see more aggressive action if the dollar continues to hold its strength. And to be honest, I keep thinking about it. In a world absent capital controls, the dollar would be just so much higher right now in the sense that we've never been as sort of technologically advanced. Like the reason why folks are so worried about bank runs now is a bank run can happen in like an hour.
00:04:42.970 - 00:04:43.194, Speaker A: Right.
00:04:43.234 - 00:04:45.370, Speaker B: Because everybody on their cell phones can move.
00:04:45.442 - 00:04:49.874, Speaker A: Right. You don't have to walk down there and push your way into the Bailey savings and loan or whatever.
00:04:49.914 - 00:04:59.810, Speaker B: No, no, no. Like even, even during the financial crisis, I can't tell you the amount of people that I know that, like, went to the physical bank to do transactions, get cash or whatever.
00:04:59.842 - 00:05:01.322, Speaker A: Oh yeah. You mean even like 15 years ago?
00:05:01.378 - 00:05:41.770, Speaker B: 15 years ago, yeah. And so the idea now, it's like, okay, if you're in Europe and you have an easy way to convert to dollars, let's say via stables or something, there's a ton of people that would m nations. If you gave all of the chinese rich people an easy avenue to convert to dollars right now, I'd tell you dollar CNH would rip like crazy. And so we live in a world that is very controlled from a capital standpoint, and these governments have a pretty strong incentive to keep those controls. And that's why you'll never see things like interest bearing stablecoins, because that would just destroy banking.
00:05:41.882 - 00:05:46.834, Speaker A: Well, there have been an announcement or two of some non us ones, which is kind of interesting.
00:05:46.874 - 00:05:49.074, Speaker B: No, I love the idea. I mean it.
00:05:49.234 - 00:05:53.610, Speaker A: But the point, I think your point is being that there will be defense against that by these nations. Right.
00:05:53.642 - 00:06:03.194, Speaker B: Yeah. Also just vested interest from folks like payment processors, people that make the middleman, is what crypto is after.
00:06:03.274 - 00:06:05.938, Speaker A: I mean, that's one of those holy grails, though, that interest bearing stable coin.
00:06:05.986 - 00:06:06.818, Speaker B: Oh, it is the holy grail because.
00:06:06.826 - 00:06:21.650, Speaker A: It combines the interest bearing nature of, say, like short term bonds with the fluidity, the high speed fluidity of a stable coin. Right. And yeah, there's reasons in the US why we don't have them. I think killer are regulatory. It's a killer app.
00:06:21.682 - 00:06:24.898, Speaker B: Oh, it's like, wait, it puts the killer in kill app. Really benefit from this.
00:06:24.946 - 00:06:28.906, Speaker A: It puts the killer in killer app. I think you're right. For large swaths of the payment stack.
00:06:29.010 - 00:06:33.812, Speaker B: Yeah. You know, I think it's entirely unfair.
00:06:33.948 - 00:06:54.348, Speaker A: Let's shift gears briefly. Let's talk about crypto markets. I said at the top of this discussion that bitcoin was mostly unchanged week over week. There was some fluctuation. We came down just slightly below 25 over the weekend, last weekend. But we've talked about this. I don't want to beat this to death, but we talk about bitcoin catalysts.
00:06:54.348 - 00:07:22.046, Speaker A: We know we have the halving April of next year. That's one of the most predictable monetary supply events on earth. Just a shill. Bitcoin's predictable monetary policy, we know that comes in April and historically has been an important event in markets. But before then, I think markets are very focused on the potential launch of an ETF, but they're still focused on it. Has anything really changed in the last week since we last talked about this?
00:07:22.120 - 00:07:27.354, Speaker B: Well, Frankel Templeton filed yesterday for a spot, bitcoin ETF.
00:07:27.434 - 00:07:28.370, Speaker A: So they've joined the mix.
00:07:28.442 - 00:07:34.706, Speaker B: They've joined the mix. And they also have, you know, I believe, a couple trillion under managers.
00:07:34.850 - 00:07:47.666, Speaker A: You got Blackrock, the largest asset manager in the world. You've got Invesco and Galaxy. Galaxy Vesco. Huge. Obviously. You got fidelity, which is huge. And you've got.
00:07:47.666 - 00:07:48.642, Speaker A: Who am I forgetting there's a big one?
00:07:48.658 - 00:07:51.170, Speaker B: I'm forgetting there's a 21 shares one which.
00:07:51.202 - 00:08:01.650, Speaker A: No, no, no. There's other big ones. World's top asset managers. And then Franklin Templeton, too, now. So vanguard, late coming?
00:08:01.762 - 00:08:02.210, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:08:02.242 - 00:08:06.106, Speaker A: Right? I mean, yeah, I think Vanguard's number two. I think worldwide, haven't seen one from them.
00:08:06.130 - 00:08:08.858, Speaker B: But Schwab also is that one.
00:08:08.946 - 00:08:23.526, Speaker A: I'm not sure. I'm not sure. But the point is a flood. Now, I would think it's fair to say it's not just the crypto native issuers, it's the traditional asset managers. It already was. But I mean, again, Franklin Templeton's like, I don't know, like four or five or something.
00:08:23.550 - 00:09:02.388, Speaker B: Yeah. No, I mean, I think essentially what you're having happen is the way I like to think about it is again, an ETF is one of the best financial innovations that's come out in the history of financial products. The US capital market's the best capital market in the history of capital markets. And there's about to be a bitcoin spot. ETF. .1.2 when you consider a product that everybody now has access to, how do they think about it? How do financial people think about assets and how do people process risk? Essentially, it comes down to the numbers.
00:09:02.388 - 00:09:28.396, Speaker B: Is bitcoin as an asset going to help my portfolio or going to hurt it? Mathematically, the performance proves that in general it is risk reducing because it generally uncorrelated sharp ratio and it's performance additive. So when you put that into most portfolios, a risk manager is going to struggle saying no to that. Especially if you destigmatize the risk of holding.
00:09:28.420 - 00:09:53.944, Speaker A: It's not just stigma too. It's even some real risk. They couldn't put it. A wealth manager can't sleep track it. Yeah, okay, individuals can buy spot, but it's not really in their platforms yet. They can't. There's a regulatory risk overall or uncertainty to it that, you know, assuming if an ETF is approved in the United States, kind of comes with a stamp of approval for the product in general.
00:09:53.944 - 00:10:10.516, Speaker A: So they feel like if they've been thinking about it for those portfolio allocation reasons, they had plenty of reasons not to go there. There was custody arrest, there was regulatory uncertainty. It wasn't on their standard platform. All of which would be, you know, mitigated or alleviated from an ETF.
00:10:10.660 - 00:11:01.224, Speaker B: And then the other really important point, which BlackRock has done a really good job of highlighting, is just a liquidity. When you come in with an ETF product in the US, there's going to be tons of market makers on there. It will dramatically improve the liquidity of this product. I think a lot of folks will become much more comfortable from the standpoint of liquidity. You can long it and short it much more easily, and bigger size, you can trade it on margin, et cetera. And as we know, liquidity tends to help a product, not hurt it. Then the other thing is just the way to think about financial assets in the modern era is you've got huge pools of capital trying to win the market they're trying to win.
00:11:01.224 - 00:11:15.616, Speaker B: At this point, there's just going to be so much vested interest in getting this product popularized or mainstream because it's the biggest asset managers telling their clients to make this a good product.
00:11:15.640 - 00:11:16.440, Speaker A: Yeah, to look at it.
00:11:16.552 - 00:12:00.090, Speaker B: Consider it, consider it. And so I just think that the financial complex that is the US, which is one of the main reasons why the dollar will be dominant a really long time and that why people still want to live here, that's just going to help bitcoin. Once it gets ingrained in the fabric of investing in the US, it's tough to go back. If now people are going to DCA in their 401 ks for the next 30 years. If it gets to that point then in terms of how high this thing can go is, I think it's pretty significant.
00:12:00.202 - 00:12:05.034, Speaker A: Yeah. Bimnet, a BB from Galaxy trading. My friend, as always, thanks for coming on Galaxy games. Bye.
