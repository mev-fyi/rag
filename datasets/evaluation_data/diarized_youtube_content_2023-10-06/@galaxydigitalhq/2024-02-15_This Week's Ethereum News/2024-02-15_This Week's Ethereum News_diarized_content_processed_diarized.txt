00:00:10.080 - 00:00:44.744, Speaker A: Welcome to the infinite Jungle, the podcast about the evolution of Ethereum. I'm your host, Christine Kim, VP of research at Galaxy. And on today's show, what you can expect are two main big discussion topics. The first is, finally, we've got a date for the Denkun upgrade on Ethereum Mainnet. We're going to talk about how developers got to that date, why they chose March 13 as the official mainnet launch date, and then we're going to talk a little bit about what the upgrade entails, how that upgrade is going to change Ethereum, what kind of impacts we're going to see on Ethereum once the upgrade goes live.
