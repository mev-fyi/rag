00:00:02.640 - 00:00:37.246, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firm wide research at Galaxy no Rap Intro this week, but we do have a great guest, Quinn Thompson, head of growth and capital markets at Maple Finance. He's going to join us to talk about markets and macro. He is a prolific writer about these markets as well as traditional markets, has some really interesting views and we're going to get into what I'm now calling cycle theory when it comes to the bitcoin markets. And is that a thing? And where are if so, where are we in it? It's a fun conversation. Bibnetta BB, our friend from Galaxy trading is off this week. We'll check up with him again next time.
00:00:37.246 - 00:00:55.454, Speaker A: Before we get to that, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to the disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information on this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Let's hop right into the show. Let's go now to our guest, Quinn Thompson, head of capital markets at Maple Finance. Quinn, welcome to Galaxy Brands.
00:00:55.494 - 00:00:56.918, Speaker B: Great to be here. Love stopping by. Alex.
00:00:56.966 - 00:01:16.622, Speaker A: Yeah, love having you on. We've been talking about markets on the Internet. It reminds me of one of these things, and we met before, but it reminds me of, I don't know if you've heard the song by Joe Wiesenthal's band, light Sweet Crude, a great band, by the way, called all my friends are on my phone. So it's one thing I love about doing this show live in New York is getting to hang out with people that, you know, we're terminally online human species, are we not?
00:01:16.678 - 00:01:20.982, Speaker B: Yeah, all day and then the weekends and then when you get in bed and you check in, and then I.
00:01:20.998 - 00:01:39.358, Speaker A: Work on it all day online, talking to people online. And then I go home and look at my phone and talk online. It's getting rough. But anyway, great to have you in person. I've wanted to talk with Quinn for a while. Joint podcast with our mutual friend Ram Alawalia from limited wealth right before the bitcoin ETF launches. And we were offering some predictions.
00:01:39.406 - 00:01:40.662, Speaker B: There's a lot of alpha in that one. Yeah.
00:01:40.678 - 00:01:45.078, Speaker A: We'll revisit that towards the end of the episode. But first, tell me about Maple finance.
00:01:45.166 - 00:02:38.294, Speaker B: Yeah, so for the last two years, I've been leading growth in capital markets at Maple. We're part of DeFi, but servicing the institutional part of the crypto market. So institutional lending, collateralized lending, similar to what? Like a galaxy lending desk partner we work with doing bitcoin or ETH, collateralized loans, providing yield for institutions, high net worth, accredited investors in the crypto space. So we scaled to a billion dollars last market, kind of with volumes came off and recently kind of coming back over the 100 million mark. We're seeing activity pick up huge, you can imagine, trading volumes, funding rates, the influx of stable coins to the space. And the biggest launch we recently had last fall or late summer was Maple direct. So we traditionally were an infrastructure provider for third parties to run their lending businesses on chain.
00:02:38.294 - 00:03:00.890, Speaker B: And we saw a big opportunity with a lot of the industry kind of reset to launch our own lending business. And that's what Maple direct is. So it's our direct lending arm, which myself and a couple others on the team have helped set up and start issuing loans from. And so it's all different types of collateralized lending to traders, institutions and other lending desks in the space.
00:03:01.042 - 00:03:13.418, Speaker A: So when you talk about infrastructure for lending on chain, for lending businesses or lenders to get their stuff, what does that mean? Right, because it sounds like you're sitting somewhere in between, like Cefi and Defi.
00:03:13.506 - 00:04:03.602, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. So we're built on smart contracts. We are, you know, defi native. It started as a protocol on chain, and some people call it the CFI in the front, Defi in the back, where we're using qualified custody to store the collateral that we hold from the borrowers. And it looks a lot like a centralized lending desk, but we're doing it transparently on chain via smart contracts. It optimizes a lot of the operational processes, adds efficiencies with reporting and accounting administration like that. So you kind of get the best of both worlds where the lenders can see the transparency of what's underneath the loan book, which we know caused some issues last cycle, and they still interact with DeFi, but it's regulated KYC institutional type of view.
00:04:03.738 - 00:04:42.010, Speaker A: I mean, that's pretty interesting because this has been a big question on our research team of if at all, or certainly when traditional finance will start to care about DeFi. I sort of think of DeFi today as well. There's a fair amount of on chain wealth and it needs financial services, but, and so it's clamoring for those services. And obviously when prices all go up, that's more wealth. So it's sort of a parallel financial system. I don't really hear anyone in traditional finance and markets demanding this technology be brought into, but this is an interesting example of how, you know, the transparency of public blockchains can provide some, you know, some genuine enhancement.
00:04:42.122 - 00:05:23.242, Speaker B: For sure. It's one of those, you overestimate what you can do in one year, underestimate ten years type of thing, because. And it's also how the RWA thesis in DeFi was born, which is interest rates. Traditional interest rates are inversely correlated with crypto defi interest rates. So typically historically, and people were seeking those traditional yield vehicles on chain. And like you said, it's a slower transition getting the old system to adopt this new method. But I think what needs to happen is prove its worth and its use case with digital native assets, tokens, bitcoin, ETH Solana, etcetera, USD stablecoins.
00:05:23.242 - 00:05:35.026, Speaker B: And then people see that optimization of their existing processes, and then they start to want to bring the industrial financing and all these other kind of more real world type of lending cases on.
00:05:35.090 - 00:05:43.620, Speaker A: Yeah, I was thinking also about something like proof of reserves, which is, I've argued this, I think is maybe one of crypto's killer use cases.
00:05:43.692 - 00:05:45.788, Speaker B: You and Nick are. Yeah, I am pioneers.
00:05:45.836 - 00:06:23.104, Speaker A: Dan gives me crap about this. My friend Dan Matryzewski, he's always trolling me about, like, nobody cares about this. I actually think it's one of the public blockchains most potent use cases, like, because this is something that only cryptographic assets can do. So it's literally a step function improvement in transparency and safety quality over traditional assets. I mean, we're all just, what? Basically trusting that our brokerage firms and the DTCC, like, don't lose our securities or that they have them. I mean, they're highly regulated, which makes up for some of that lack of technical transparency. But you could even replace some of these rules with mathematical certainty, for sure.
00:06:23.804 - 00:07:01.368, Speaker B: I can't remember the year, but it was Citibank that fat fingered a $900 million loan. They're supposed to pay the interest to the lenders, and they accidentally fat fingered the whole loan amount. And there was this whole bank, like, bankruptcy case, basically for the company, and just like an administrative error that was extremely costly. There's a lot of cases like that where the one thing I'm interested to see how it shakes out over time is there's reasons to have some non transparency. Right? Like banks, like how. How healthy, you know, but if you have to hide something, it's. Exactly.
00:07:01.368 - 00:07:14.744, Speaker B: So there's this balance, but like things like proof of reserves where you're not necessarily giving leaking IP, you know, like you're giving a more trusted audit as super valuable to know, like who's the next, you know, SVB type of thing.
00:07:14.784 - 00:07:42.634, Speaker A: Right. And you could do this, obviously, in ways where, like, you don't reveal or use zero knowledge or whatever. But I can understand with, with Maple as a lender, wanting to give, I mean, you need to prove the health and credit of you guys to your depositors or whomever else. Right. To the counterparties that you work with. So it's quite an interesting, I think, just tie up way of using Defi and blockchain technologies in what is effectively a traditional lending business. I think that's interesting.
00:07:42.634 - 00:07:50.450, Speaker A: So let's move on. But you have told me, though, that you've been building this at Maple, but you are set to leave Maple. What are you doing now?
00:07:50.522 - 00:08:36.850, Speaker B: That's right. In May, I'll be launching a discretionary digital asset focused hedge fund called Lecker Capital, something I've been very interested in for a long time, investing personally. Back when I was in tradfi, in fixed income, coming at things from the macro angle, that's originally how I got into bitcoin and crypto. I think they're very intertwined and becoming increasingly intertwined with the ETF and things. I'll be launching in May, traditional macro fund, but focused on crypto and digital assets, doing things with traditional equities, crypto related equities. I published a lot on that stuff. And then as well as tokens, it's kind of how I manage my money, trying to outperform bitcoin in an uptrend and not take a 70% drawdown on a down.
00:08:36.922 - 00:08:37.106, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:37.130 - 00:08:37.290, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:37.322 - 00:08:55.242, Speaker A: That's the challenge with this volatile market. I do like the idea of mixing the traditional assets and the cryptos. I mean, obviously now they're becoming more intertwined in markets, let alone the ETF's. But also there's a number of crypto linked equities or whatever. And so, yeah, it's an interesting. There's opportunities there.
00:08:55.258 - 00:09:32.052, Speaker B: It feels like, yeah, I mean, a lot of the tokens and things that exist in crypto, we're seeing a different. And we're going to talk about later with the cycle and where we're at. The mechanism and transmission of flows is different this time with the ETF, I think, and where people have expected alts and things to run like it's kind of maybe stayed in some brokerages and gone to some of the miners or the coinbases and the MSTRs. So I think having that latitude to be able to play in different areas. And my background is traditional finance and coming from that, so, like, to pair the two, and that's how I think about the world.
00:09:32.108 - 00:09:37.076, Speaker A: Yeah, very interesting. Quinn's a good follow and publishes a lot of these thoughts on Twitter as well, or x, I should say.
00:09:37.220 - 00:09:38.944, Speaker B: I'm trying to learn. After you.
00:09:40.164 - 00:09:43.196, Speaker A: So, yeah, I mean, that's interesting. It's exciting. Congratulations.
00:09:43.220 - 00:09:43.484, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:09:43.524 - 00:10:12.544, Speaker A: And let's talk about markets now. I mean, you're a markets guy. Like I said, you share a lot of commentary, which I always respect, because, as I also do, and you can be wrong, and it takes guts and confidence to share your views of the world. So I think that's always interesting, and it's a fun one to talk about. This is a very exciting market. It always has been. It was exciting at the depths of the last bear market, let alone at whatever it is we're dealing with now, which is certainly.
00:10:12.544 - 00:10:46.094, Speaker A: It's something bullish. I think that's part of the debate we want to have a little bit. A lot of people have been asking me, for example, particularly with the upcoming bitcoin having, we have this historical idea that bitcoin tends to enter these bull markets. And of course, ultimately the rest of crypto, which follows bitcoin's lead, sometimes subsequent to the having. We saw it in 2020. The having was May 2020. We basically started, we re broke prior December 2017, all time highs in December 2020.
00:10:46.094 - 00:11:00.942, Speaker A: And then, of course, went on a whole tear throughout 21. You saw the same thing in 2016, shortly after having. Right. That's when 2017 happened. But this time. So people think that the having has some causal relationship. I mean, there's also a big debate about whether it's correlation or causation.
00:11:00.942 - 00:11:17.058, Speaker A: There's a bunch of other factors, like global liquidity, that may play a role, but leaving that aside, this time it's been different. Right. We surpassed our 69,000 all time high a week or two ago, even on a little bit of a dip that we're having at the time of our recording. Technically, we're $10 above the priority.
00:11:17.066 - 00:11:20.370, Speaker B: We need that to get the 69, 420 by the end of this recording.
00:11:20.522 - 00:11:39.606, Speaker A: So the question is, and that people have been saying, well, is this okay, empirically, it is different. This is the first time that we've retaken the prior all time high, prior to having. Does that mean anything? Does that mean that. Are we topping too early? I don't think any of. Well, I'd like to hear your view that I've written about this. I say that, yeah, it's different and that's okay. It can be different.
00:11:39.606 - 00:11:42.838, Speaker A: But what's your take on where we are in the so called cycle?
00:11:42.926 - 00:12:25.298, Speaker B: Yeah, so I got, again, I come from the macro side of it. So I saw a lot of things lining up in September and October of last year. And then we obviously had the ETF rumors kick things off. But today, when we got this hot CPI or print inflation print today reminded me of a tweet back in like September, October. I said, the best thing you can do if you're deep in crypto is forget about the four year cycles. I think they are going to exist in some respects, but I think it's going to be different because the ETF adds a lot of different things. One, it adds correlation sometimes.
00:12:25.298 - 00:13:02.610, Speaker B: Sometimes it might be inversely correlated. I view bitcoin as a 50% Nasdaq, 50% gold, and depending on the market regime, we trade more like either of them. Like recently, Nasdaq has been very hot. Up until lately, gold was not. And bitcoin was pumping pretty hard, more like tech stocks and AI. But then you go to October where the Nasdaq was falling and we had geopolitical conflict in Israel, and bitcoin was rallying with gold. It shape shifts, it takes different forms, and I think it confuses people who don't look at it, who look at it more from a crypto native lens.
00:13:02.610 - 00:13:45.310, Speaker B: So I think it's going to be different. I do think the having matters both. Obviously there's a supply effect and that just people get excited and it induces fomo and things like that. But I also think that we are, as just as we've seen, beholden to the flows of the ETF, that cuts both ways to some degree. Now, look, if there's like 20 billion of sovereign demand that's been pent up, ready to buy this thing, and they're t whopping, those guys don't buy overnight. And you have the situation where even when there's broader market volatility, bitcoin just kind of either doesn't go down much or chops and it's fine. But I kind of think there's definitely some of the ETF money.
00:13:45.310 - 00:14:10.618, Speaker B: It's more fast money at signs of rising rates, and things will probably hit the exit. So I do think it'll be different. I think we're later in. What would people think of as the traditional four year cycle than expected? I actually would say it's not talked about much. But the true ish top was the April Coinbase IPO. So many things and then we got the bitcoin futures listing in the fall.
00:14:10.706 - 00:14:50.830, Speaker A: Yeah. A lot of people, the guys like checkmate glass node is a big proponent of this concept. And he says that on chain data also shows that basically the November 21 high was like, not fake, but like, wasn't retail, wasn't like, it kind of like ran up on really. He argues it shouldn't really be counted as the really, April 2021 is the sort of real high. And the fact that we got back to there basically is almost like a, was driven by something else, by a small amount of like, influential big traders. Wasn't a retailer like mania. It was one of the interesting things to look at on this is literally like on chain transaction volumes down only from the spring.
00:14:50.830 - 00:14:52.990, Speaker A: Yeah, so I hear you. That's an interesting point.
00:14:53.022 - 00:15:00.382, Speaker B: So it's a longer bear or like an earlier start to the bear than people think. Probably people mentally attribute the start of the bear to like, luna kind of.
00:15:00.398 - 00:15:03.830, Speaker A: Thing, but as late as, like, what, April or May 20. Yeah. Which much later.
00:15:03.862 - 00:15:24.334, Speaker B: Yeah. Wait, year after macro had already peaked? Well, you know. Yeah. So I think we're like two, three weeks ago. I thought we might hit this parabola and we've kind of hit it a little bit. We cross highs. I thought we would have got a little higher, but I think we might cool off here.
00:15:24.334 - 00:15:41.712, Speaker B: I think it's a little relief. Early 21, I think we're late, but it should go longer. We have the ETF now. There's an implicit stronger bid. So it's going to look different. But we are later, I think, than people give credit.
00:15:41.768 - 00:15:55.648, Speaker A: That's interesting. Yeah. Especially if you adjust the start time of the cycle or whatever. I think that makes a lot of sense. Yeah, you're right. So December 2020, we get back to 20 or so. And then we did chop a little bit.
00:15:55.648 - 00:16:10.030, Speaker A: I mean, bullish months. I think the most bullish month, if I recall, is maybe February of that year. We really ran pretty hard and then we go higher and then I don't know what was the actual top in April 21? Was that when Elon rugged on payments at Tesla? Do you remember?
00:16:10.062 - 00:16:13.998, Speaker B: It was, it was. He was on SNL with Doge and that was the.
00:16:14.046 - 00:16:17.750, Speaker A: I remember I was in between 69 Centog.
00:16:17.862 - 00:16:22.834, Speaker B: Yeah. And it. He's on SNL. Literally peaked during that. I remember. That was hilarious. Yeah.
00:16:22.834 - 00:16:41.582, Speaker B: It was also. It was the Coinbase IPO. It was microstrategy, ripped off two converts, not two weeks. I think it was a month, something like that. But the last one was Feb, I think 21st, similar. Coinbase just did a stock offering. MSTR just got off two converts, meme coins.
00:16:41.582 - 00:17:04.588, Speaker B: I mean, like, let's be honest, I love them. For a couple weekends, you're trading them, but they are what they are, and they're like the attention. You're fighting for house fly attention spans here, and they can't go on forever. There's a lot of signs. Like I said, I don't think it's like this picotop or anything, but particularly if macro starts weakening here, higher rates, it's vulnerable.
00:17:04.636 - 00:17:20.796, Speaker A: Yeah, and the inflation data does look like it's kind of going the wrong way at the moment. It's not like drastic, but it's not cooling. Right. I mean, if they're looking for signs of continued reduction in the inflation metrics, they're not currently getting those signs.
00:17:20.860 - 00:17:22.676, Speaker B: Yeah, that's the risk.
00:17:22.740 - 00:17:24.996, Speaker A: I mean, that creates risk for risk assets.
00:17:25.060 - 00:18:00.866, Speaker B: It's election year. So I actually, in one of these camps where it's like, how do Powell and Yellen and people in power keep the power? It's with a strong market. So dips, I think, will still be bought this year, but they have these little fires they have to put out when rates spike. The thing to watch, too, you have here is oil and commodities. Copper looks like it's breaking out. And I think that's what gold's responding to a little bit is where they know the fed eventually will find a way to keep a lid on rates, and that suppresses real yields and sends things like bitcoin and things higher. So I'm very constructive on a medium term.
00:18:00.866 - 00:18:01.994, Speaker B: This is more tactical.
00:18:02.074 - 00:18:15.690, Speaker A: I hear you. I think it makes sense. And look, I mean, it's been. I mean, bitcoin was up, I think, from what, 38 five, and we were up 60, 70% in like a month. I mean, if you look at the, like, the last, like 50 days of bitcoin price, it's effectively up.
00:18:15.722 - 00:18:17.738, Speaker B: Only, like, you gotta zoom out a bit. Yeah, yeah.
00:18:17.786 - 00:18:24.616, Speaker A: So, I mean, I think in general, it's obviously healthy if we don't. We don't want a parabolic top here if you want to go higher. Right.
00:18:24.680 - 00:18:24.968, Speaker B: Yep.
00:18:25.016 - 00:18:32.936, Speaker A: There's only, I guess that first cycle, if we've encountered as one in like 2013, there were sort of two peaks. But I mean, like, like where one went much higher, the second one was.
00:18:32.960 - 00:18:33.576, Speaker B: Such a small asset.
00:18:33.600 - 00:18:45.776, Speaker A: It's not healthy. Like, parabolic manias are not healthy. Like you'd like to go, you know, like staircase up, staircase down, not elevator up. Or usually it's staircase up, elevator down. Yeah, but you'd like. Let's be more. And I agree, the meme.
00:18:45.776 - 00:19:05.364, Speaker A: Let's talk about the meme coin mania, as I think Bloomberg called it. The. The mania. There was a Bloomberg segment and I was talking with Anthony Pompoliano. He told me that at the time when I spoke to him, which was maybe around March 13, or that it was that there were 2500 meme coins being launched per hour on Solana.
00:19:05.744 - 00:19:07.160, Speaker B: Feed the ducks when they're cracking.
00:19:07.232 - 00:19:34.568, Speaker A: Yeah, that seems like a bit of a local top signal. I mean, how many of these derivative jokes can you make? We already have like five or ten relatively well valued dog themed coins. Then there's all these political ones. I don't want to name these ones, they're funny names, but I'm certainly not trying to like actually promote them in any way. But you have one or two that came out and others like every single probably member of Congress has one. I'm making this up. I don't know, but like there's tons of them and it's like.
00:19:34.568 - 00:19:50.340, Speaker A: That feels local toppy to me, if not totally toppy. But with our long, medium and long term constructive view on bitcoin in general driving that market, I'm not prepared to say total top coins. But it feels like we're at a point where it's like, I mean, how much more juices in this lemon?
00:19:50.412 - 00:20:15.596, Speaker B: Yeah, it's an attention game you're really fighting for in these markets. Those bouts of strength can last longer where you have stable coin supply growing a couple billion a week. Since the start of the year we've had stable coins growing 15 billion year to date. That's huge. On 30 billion base. It's like 2% a week. You get new entrants.
00:20:15.596 - 00:20:33.830, Speaker B: Retail is coming back. I think. Yeah, like it just goes to we're a little later than people ascribe in the cycle. But again, like everything's very healthy overall. I think you're seeing actual, you know, more like that's what the ETF is showing. There's more adoption coming in.
00:20:33.862 - 00:20:51.910, Speaker A: So yeah, I think your point about earlier that the cycle can also be longer. And again, I think we agree it already looks different. It's probably going to keep looking different. One of the things that we've been talking about, like we had estimated in October in our report about the ETF's that, I mean, this was a methodology they could make.
00:20:51.942 - 00:20:54.838, Speaker B: It was very good. That was the billion dollar. I appreciate that.
00:20:54.886 - 00:21:42.960, Speaker A: Thank you. When we, we said $15 billion of net inflows into the ETF's in year one, which could result in a price of around $75,000. That's basically happened in the first two months, both the price and the inflows, the net inflows. But the thing is, about our report, we didn't even bother to look at any type of retail interest. The entire estimate is predicated on the idea that it's advisors and wealth managers who don't have currently access to put their end clients into bitcoin exposure. Because we said, just on balance, like retail, like me and you, we can buy bitcoin in a variety of places, have been able to for years. And by the way, the most sophisticated investors, endowments and pensions, should they want exposure, well, they can sign a private placement agreement, but you can't, as a financial advisor, do 150 private placements for your thing.
00:21:42.960 - 00:22:17.818, Speaker A: Or if you're on a platform at a bank or broker dealer, they mostly haven't allowed this. So they were the net new accessible market. But we've now gotten to where we said, and it was a conservative estimate, that that market could take the ETF's and the bitcoin price without them. They're still not actually really here. The banks and broker dealers, some of them may be offering on an unsolicited basis, but so that to me is quite bullish because you'll see them turn on over the next three to 24 months. So you'll constantly have these unlocks of new potential investors. But that also changes the glide path here.
00:22:17.906 - 00:23:00.698, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. There's no way those have come. And I know you guys been really active with your ETF, with Invesco as well, so you're probably pretty plugged in. I think also there's just a bunch of young people that they're like, I don't want to own General Motors and Hershey and my money in my retirement I can't touch for 40 years. I'll just Yolo into bitcoin, which probably decently smart. No one can put a finger on where the capital is from. I've heard rumors about big buyers that have maybe seeded ETF's and things, but like you said, we're seeing these filings trickle, where it's like the Morgan Stanley funds and then the Blackrock other funds are starting to add it to their allowed invest list.
00:23:00.698 - 00:23:05.232, Speaker B: And it's just going to continue, I think makes this cycle really different.
00:23:05.328 - 00:23:14.040, Speaker A: One thing that's going to be really exciting is in April when we start to see the 13 f filings for these funds, certain classes, I don't think individual retail necessarily, but it's on like.
00:23:14.072 - 00:23:18.704, Speaker B: Druck and PJT, and that won't surprise too much.
00:23:18.744 - 00:23:40.642, Speaker A: Those guys are bullish. But who knows what we might find. These are filings where large holders of equities have to disclose that they hold them. And so, I don't know. Trust me, we're going to be looking as soon as those probably come out in like the second or third week of April after quarter close in Q one. And it'll be really interesting to see who has filed to say they own the bitcoin ETF's. And I'm sure there will be a couple surprises there.
00:23:40.698 - 00:24:04.418, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, you can't get bearish on this, particularly bitcoin. We could talk like alts and things like that. Don't have this ETF driver. It's a different story. There's some really high FDV coins that are doing the old playbook that I don't think is going to work this time. Last cycle was like every single asset on earth went straight up and indiscriminately even coins that one. It's just like a lot of things didn't make sense.
00:24:04.418 - 00:24:27.564, Speaker B: I think it's going to look different from that regard. People are expecting the shittiest of shitcoins will just go up forever, and that probably doesn't happen. There has to be some logic there. But you look at who's already bought bitcoin. There's a number of public companies besides MSTR, Reddit that's kicking off this wave. People are seeing what MSTR is doing. All they've done to build this business is buy bitcoin.
00:24:27.564 - 00:24:41.380, Speaker B: That's it. And then the market takes it from there. It increases the volume. There's speculation they can issue converts. They issue the converts and they add book value to their business. The stock is worth more if commands a premium. It's like, sailor's just so genius.
00:24:41.380 - 00:25:03.040, Speaker B: But if you're some middle market, sleepy public company, it's like shit. Should we just do that? Why can't we? Let's go raise some money. Or, you know, sovereigns, right? We had that meeting with where we have this El Salvador guy who's like, you know, huge advocate. He's meeting with like middle eastern leaders and sovereign bukili.
00:25:03.072 - 00:25:09.592, Speaker A: What's he doing over there? Yeah, yeah, I bet he's mentioned bitcoin and then certain he. Well, I can't be certain, but I. You have one has to.
00:25:09.648 - 00:25:30.992, Speaker B: I mean, come on. Yeah, like, yeah, you know, and then you have the sovereign wealth funds, like, you know, the Singapore, like Temasek and some of those were in involved last cycle and, yeah, so, like, it's literally happening. And these signs are there and the ETF makes it more accessible and more. I haven't had as many, like, normies, like, just reaching out, like, hey, we're.
00:25:31.008 - 00:25:36.176, Speaker A: Not really fully there. I've had a couple, but I've had people. There were basically none until a month ago, just a few.
00:25:36.320 - 00:25:42.024, Speaker B: But people are more like accepting than they're like, all right, you guys just, like, battled some messed up.
00:25:42.064 - 00:25:43.344, Speaker A: You walked through the fire.
00:25:43.504 - 00:25:46.712, Speaker B: So they're like, all right, there must be something here. And it just happens every cycle.
00:25:46.768 - 00:26:14.548, Speaker A: So many people came in in the last cycle with such an explosion of normal and retail awareness, just awareness even whether or not they got interested or bought bitcoin, like, such a huge base of people, and then maybe that was their first time. And then it goes down to, I mean, bitcoin ultimately goes to, I think, bottoms around 16 five or 16 three. And that's a huge drop from sixty nine k. And maybe some of them are like, oh, it's dead. This is the first time. Some of us have been in the market a long time. This has happened a couple times.
00:26:14.548 - 00:26:39.222, Speaker A: We're kind of like, dead to that. And I believe long enough term in bitcoin generally that, like, you know, I mean, frankly, most long term bitcoiners are kind of upset. They want to stack more sats at lower prices. But this might be the first time that they've seen us be declared completely dead on arrival. Every headline, every headline, literally even some believers remember, what was his name? Paul Graham. Or like, yeah, I mean, people threw in the towel.
00:26:39.278 - 00:26:39.894, Speaker B: It's just crazy.
00:26:39.934 - 00:26:43.750, Speaker A: Some of the stuff we saw, Kramer's called it dead like 35 times, been wrong.
00:26:43.822 - 00:26:47.020, Speaker B: The fun that pivoted to AI and then pivoted back, right.
00:26:47.092 - 00:27:10.540, Speaker A: And it's like, so. But now those people have seen, like, wait, because there's something that looks different, right? Tulip mania, if it even happened at all, didn't happen twice, didn't happen a third time, didn't keep coming back. So there's obviously something here. And I think, you know, sort of average folks who aren't like diehard into crypto or been to bitcoin, they didn't. We know it, but they're, they're seeing it now. And. But I agree, for that signal in your mind, like, you know, the.
00:27:10.540 - 00:27:14.236, Speaker A: Every single person pinging you, wait a sec, how do I buy bitcoin. That hasn't happened.
00:27:14.300 - 00:27:44.720, Speaker B: No. And I think naturally the cycles should get shorter. Like, that's why ultimately four year cycles will go away. I think is now, there's many factors, but the reaction function should speed up. It's like, how many times do you have to watch something go up ten x and down and not die? Ten x down, not die to be like, all right, clearly there's something here. So every time, more eyeballs, more adoption, and so that's going to shorten the response time for people like, oh, bitcoin bought sooner. Like, bitcoins.
00:27:44.720 - 00:27:55.912, Speaker B: You know, bitcoin's rallying again. I should get in before I buy the top. So there's that. But there's also this, I would say, within. So that's outside of crypto. Within crypto, there's some. There's bear market trauma.
00:27:55.912 - 00:28:13.684, Speaker B: This was a bad bear market. This was a deep bear market. So you've had people every step of the way from October when the run started in the twenties, to today in the seventies, like. Like frantic, you know. Yeah. How many tweets do you see of, like, what's your top signal list? What's your top.
00:28:13.724 - 00:28:14.140, Speaker A: I know.
00:28:14.212 - 00:28:20.820, Speaker B: And that just tells me there's no top because you don't get that when people are. When you're at the top, then it's super cycle top.
00:28:20.852 - 00:28:25.132, Speaker A: The top is like euphoria and stuff like that. People are pretty shell shocked. I agree.
00:28:25.228 - 00:28:32.884, Speaker B: So it's like, it's these two combating factors, which again, why I think it'll be more stair like and longer and different.
00:28:33.004 - 00:29:07.858, Speaker A: Yeah. And then one of the other ideas that I've been, I want to raise this one with you. I've been criticized by some, my friends for this idea, which is great. I love that makes a fun idea, makes markets. In addition to the fact that the ETF's are not being turned on yet on all these platforms where there's all this wealth that can't get exposure and that may be prolonging or certainly being bullish that they're not here yet, there's a question. I also think, particularly if it's in advisor managed accounts, that capital is stickier. If you put into bitcoin, it's not on a crypto exchange where it can be easily.
00:29:07.858 - 00:29:33.298, Speaker A: So that has two things that it tells me. One, advisor manager accounts, they'll have a portfolio target. If bitcoin goes above its, their percent, they'll probably sell some. If it goes below, they'll come buy back volatility which is long term good. But the other idea is that what if this intra crypto rotation trade that we've seen so many times, right. Bitcoin all time high in December, 17 ETH all time high in January, 18 alt season in March, right. And then everything goes down, like.
00:29:33.298 - 00:30:09.698, Speaker A: And we've seen it at the cycle level. Like, we've seen it in little microcosms during bull markets. If bitcoin goes sideways, like in November and December is kind of sideways a little bit, then you saw, like an alt season happen. Many, like. But shouldn't. Shouldn't the stickiness if an increasing share of bitcoin is held in market access vehicles, especially if it's in lots of advisor managed accounts, although basically almost none of it is yet. But shouldn't that also dampen the intra crypto rotation trade, because that is stickier capital, it's not there to flow from? I don't think advisors are likely to be like, oh, my God, wait a sec, let's call the top here and then rotate into rotating.
00:30:09.698 - 00:30:12.284, Speaker A: Solana. Right. What are your thoughts on this idea?
00:30:12.744 - 00:30:38.142, Speaker B: You look at Grayscale Trust. We're a big accumulator of vehicles. There's obviously private funds, like the ones you guys have that brought assets in. But GBTC added about 6.5 billion of flows last cycle, and this is impactful on much smaller market. Cap Ethi added about 1.5 billion, but stablecoins added 130 billion or whatever.
00:30:38.198 - 00:30:40.766, Speaker A: So, like, went from basically one at the end of 2017.
00:30:40.870 - 00:30:57.886, Speaker B: Yeah. So, like, every dollar into these, like, regulated, like, more trad five vehicles is like a multiplier into stable coins. But those are later flows. Stable coins peaked in April 22. You know, they're later. It has to get going. Like, venture funding isn't peaking yet because people do that after the Fomos hits.
00:30:57.886 - 00:31:23.634, Speaker B: So it's been a delay. I still think that happens. Like. Like, come on, it's going to happen. Everybody you talk to is like, oh, wow, bitcoin's great, but I've heard that Solana and ETH, they're the better block, you know, so, like, you have that nat, it's just human nature and it's just slower. And this bitcoin dom run has been an absolute beast from. From basically the merge in September 22 or whatever to today.
00:31:23.634 - 00:31:39.126, Speaker B: And it's thrown people for a loop. And you've had pockets like the memes, different trades around Catalyst, the Solana catalyst, the bitcoin eco catalyst, and you're still getting those. It's just not a like alt, alt, alt, you know, and everything's up.
00:31:39.150 - 00:31:52.606, Speaker A: And that literally was like in remember, and obviously you remember this in 21. It was like, there's what they call Soluna Avax trade. It was literally like, which alt l one hasn't run yet. Just like throwing the dart and like that. The market was hunting for those things.
00:31:52.670 - 00:32:11.042, Speaker B: I mean, you had like the tungsten cube thing. I could have like paid up. Paid for my car with the tungsten cube, which, by the way, I round tripped, obviously. And then that was the only money I had on FTX. I was trying to sell that thing and I had it on the. I didn't get it and I totally forgot.
00:32:11.098 - 00:32:17.042, Speaker A: Well, what about that big one nick's always talking about on the brink? That big? They had it. How big was it? A foot bigger.
00:32:17.098 - 00:32:18.774, Speaker B: It's like a ton or something. Yeah.
00:32:19.354 - 00:32:23.706, Speaker A: In the lobby of the FTX office in Bahamas. I haven't seen this in the bankruptcy.
00:32:23.730 - 00:32:24.934, Speaker B: Well, they have mine too.
00:32:25.114 - 00:32:59.586, Speaker A: It's crazy. Yeah. You know, another counter argument that I've thought about to my point about the dampening of dampening. Notice I'm using the word dampening. I'm not, certainly not saying there won't be rotations in crypto world, but obviously I'm using the word dampening, which is an extremely vague word that I'm not going to qualify with any data because I'm really not even sure how to qualify it. So it's a sense and it's a theory, but, you know, but another thing that counteracts it is the idea that, well, not all of the rotation is actual capital rotation. It can be wealth effect.
00:32:59.586 - 00:33:27.226, Speaker A: It can be, wow. A lot of people that own alternative crypto assets, they may also own bitcoin, and so they're wealthier when bitcoin goes up, or they just see it in the market and they say, you know what, I'm increasing my offers, right? Prices just go up because people are like, well, if bitcoin's worth 75k, then XYZ Alt should be worth this, which is higher than before. And it just still kind of happens in terms of price action. It doesn't need to be capital rotation.
00:33:27.330 - 00:33:48.144, Speaker B: Another area I don't hear people talk about enough is last cycle was by far and away the biggest venture backed investing boom. The industry scene, we had icos in 17, but that's like crowdfunding. And this was Andreessen's porn in billions.
00:33:48.804 - 00:33:54.932, Speaker A: I mean, 21 and 22, by my count, was basically like almost 65 billion invested in startups.
00:33:54.988 - 00:34:31.264, Speaker B: And so the problem is all those guys need liquidity and there's no but no m and a, there's no ipos. And how do you do it? You do a token and we're seeing that. And a lot of them are trying this old SPF initiated game of low float high fdv. And there's still that overhang where price for these can stay the same and market cap can go up because the inflation supply is huge. And that's a problem for a lot of these. And it's an attention game, and that's where you get these rotations. So you still have it on the volatility point.
00:34:31.264 - 00:35:03.718, Speaker B: We talked about this on the pod. Was it a sell the news thing? And secularly for sure, it's going to lower volatility. We might see 70% dip again, but it's not going to be the norm with this bid. So that's on a secular multi year horizon where people are like, oh, dude, you're an idiot. You said volume's going to dampen. And it's like, well, we're entering a bull market where volatility is cyclically rising. I think volatility is cyclically too cheap on a 3612 month basis, probably continues to rise.
00:35:03.718 - 00:35:07.818, Speaker B: You can have these different views. That's where I find most disagreement is on time horizon.
00:35:07.866 - 00:35:28.098, Speaker A: What's the most fun part about these markets? These are just the most exciting markets because you're coupling big, giant, serious stories like bitcoin, decentralized, non sovereign effects with a fixed supply and credible neutrality and transparency that also has huge implications for things like human liberty and human rights on one end.
00:35:28.186 - 00:35:29.362, Speaker B: Yeah, it's unbelievable.
00:35:29.418 - 00:35:50.978, Speaker A: Then you've got things like dog tokens that have intentionally no utility at all. And by the way, there's a bunch of other interesting stuff all in the middle. I don't know. Is that, to me, that's sort of the other end of the barbell. And so it's a wild, crazy, technologically brilliant, but also socially memetic kind of market, which is just so fun. That's what drives.
00:35:51.066 - 00:36:05.652, Speaker B: I was trading, I was arguing about 25 basis points on bond and loan deals and trad five for fine tooth combing every legal doc for years. And I was like, and then I got found crypto and I was like, yeah, this is, this is sick.
00:36:05.748 - 00:36:26.372, Speaker A: I think that's what happens. Especially, like, people that do volatility trading. You see a lot of commodities trading, you see fixed income people that do rates. A lot of people really like the story here. Again, it's such a diverse, broad story. I still think, you know, bitcoin, even just if it was the only one, is big enough story, like for sure. But there are others, and that makes it exciting.
00:36:26.372 - 00:36:56.540, Speaker A: And there's new technology still being built, like, and whether it's blockchain technology or new ways of thinking about blockchains, some of the stuff we haven't talked about that people are talking a lot about is restaking and modularity. And you mentioned the bitcoin eco. We're seeing the launch of ZK rollups that will settle on bitcoin, which is super interesting. So there's more to the story than even the market. The technology story is a big, is still big. We shouldn't bet against human ingenuity. But sometimes I do wonder, wait a second.
00:36:56.540 - 00:37:00.766, Speaker A: Haven't we figured this out yet? Genius came along with some new idea.
00:37:00.870 - 00:37:48.410, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just unseen like anything before. I mean, how I look at it, and this is just my macro hat again, is it's an emerging market. When there's a gold boom in the west coast of the US, when there's a boom in China and a boom in India and capital floods in and there's such high demand for funding, interest rates rise, that eventually causes the demise because capital gets too costly and it kind of hampers innovation. I see it as an emerging market. And you have bitcoin, which is kind of like your store value or gold. These are more like tech innovations. And it's really, a lot of the tokens are like early stage venture where one day it looks like it's the life saving thing and the next day the future value could be a trillion or zero.
00:37:48.410 - 00:37:57.880, Speaker B: So the volume between is just like, yeah, makes the markets what they are, and there's no fun. No more. Other place you'd rather be.
00:37:57.952 - 00:38:02.432, Speaker A: Quinn, before we wrap, tell the audience where to find you and where to follow you.
