00:00:10.640 - 00:00:53.046, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. Hey, we're always in the chat and we never desert each verse rehearse and if it works, we burst when I spit a line you have a state on time, money on the mind at an open dime poked in prime soaked with rhyme bespoke design you get smoked and fried? Open eyes know when I go that I go in size when I'm throwing up my open buys? Be hitting the lows and highs with my flow supplies? And it's no surprise that I'm dope haters cope when I know the cries dripping soap I'm cleaning fresh like open skies? You know we're wise on galaxy brains. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firm wide research at Galaxy Digital. Thank you for listening to Galaxy brains. We have a great show for you today. Christine Kim from Galaxy Research. She is back.
00:00:53.046 - 00:01:20.210, Speaker A: We're going to talk about Shanghai, the upgrade on Ethereum that went great and enabled unstaking. Also, a bunch of other random crypto topics with Christine will get her take. And of course, we'll check in with our friend Bimnet, a BB from Galaxy trading, as always, to talk about markets and macro.

Oh, what a weird beat. I was doing some weird flow on this thing.
00:01:20.210 - 00:01:30.394, Speaker A: I know that's gonna make the episode great. Let's get right into it. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, my friend, great to see you.
00:01:30.514 - 00:01:31.610, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:01:31.722 - 00:01:40.694, Speaker A: It's like we could literally. I try to say it the exact same way each time, and you say, thanks for having me every. What else am I supposed to say? We got to do a montage.
00:01:41.154 - 00:01:41.930, Speaker B: Oh, boy.
00:01:42.002 - 00:01:50.874, Speaker A: Well, good to see you, man. You know, I guess right now we're down a little bit. You know, viewers of the YouTube channel can see the block clock. 29, three. You know, it seems fine.
00:01:50.954 - 00:01:51.506, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely.
00:01:51.570 - 00:02:08.434, Speaker A: A little bit of a minor deleveraging. I think we saw Ethan ETH was below two k. Think it might be back around two k. Look, we're updating now. 23, 29. 335 on bitcoin, $5 higher. Anything to that? Just before we get into other stuff.
00:02:09.054 - 00:02:41.158, Speaker B: The sell off today really started when you got a surprise print on UK inflation at surprise, higher. And you got a repricing of the UK curve. Basically, you took terminal rates in the UK market to 491, and in the US, they're a little over five. UK has got an inflation problem. The market was like, it's got a worse inflation problem. It's worsening and worsening, and when you're still surprising, higher than high estimates, it's bad.
00:02:41.246 - 00:02:44.086, Speaker A: That's not what we're doing. In the US, we've been flat or.
00:02:44.110 - 00:02:51.830, Speaker B: Slightly lower coming in line, but the data's headed in the right direction. Depending on how you slice and dice it, there's something for everyone.
00:02:51.942 - 00:02:52.718, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:02:52.846 - 00:03:30.354, Speaker B: So it's a little bit tricky. But what I do know for sure is that people are really bad at forecasting inflation. And so I think what you're supposed to do is just react to the data as it comes in. But back to our original point, you had this surprise print, and it caused the market to sell off. Equities moved a little bit lower, dollar actually caught a bid, and you had crypto sell off when it was dead close to trend highs. Bitcoin was at 30,200, a couple hundred points from literally pico, top of the trend. It was like poor liquidity, and then liquidations begun.
00:03:30.354 - 00:03:45.482, Speaker B: And so you had about, you know, 200, 250 million in liquidations go through into a thin market with, like, broader risk markets selling off. And now you're back down to 29 three. But again, it's like, what is this? A sell off for ants?
00:03:45.538 - 00:03:46.330, Speaker A: Yeah, it seems fine.
00:03:46.362 - 00:03:50.458, Speaker B: I mean, for a crypto person that lived through the last year, I mean.
00:03:50.546 - 00:03:55.042, Speaker A: I was like, right, thirty k to twenty nine three is like, we're still in the same sort of range anyway.
00:03:55.098 - 00:04:45.162, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, for me, you know, I'm looking at a market that's clearly trending. Right? What's clearly. By what I mean, what I mean when I say clearly trending is you've consistently set higher and higher lows and higher and higher highs, and it respects things like trend lines, et cetera. And for me, right now, bitcoin is still trending higher, but it did lose some momentum at highs just today. If you think about it, like, it takes a lot of conviction to buy an asset up 80% on the year. You have to be very convinced to add to your position at those highs. And so I think it's natural that we get a little bit of a pause, a relief here, if you just think about it.
00:04:45.162 - 00:05:06.914, Speaker B: We spent a couple of weeks around twenty eight k, and then we broke out. So it wouldn't shock me if we were going to consolidate for the next couple of weeks. I think a couple of things that are notable is you haven't really had, like, a huge bid in volume or volume, haven't really spiked that much in the options market. And so what that tells me is that people aren't scrambling to buy crash protection.
00:05:07.214 - 00:05:07.574, Speaker A: Right.
00:05:07.614 - 00:05:20.384, Speaker B: So it's not like, oh, we're worried that bitcoin is going to go back through twenty five k, twenty k again. It's more like, okay, you know, we've sold off a little bit, but it's not really a need. There's no real need to panic.
00:05:20.464 - 00:05:21.456, Speaker A: So there's no fear.
00:05:21.600 - 00:05:22.088, Speaker B: No fear.
00:05:22.136 - 00:05:24.712, Speaker A: It's more just in a range, in.
00:05:24.728 - 00:05:34.464, Speaker B: A range following macro overnight, following macro liquidity liquidations. And so that's kind of what it is. I'd say more noise than signal is the best way I would interpret that.
00:05:34.504 - 00:05:47.128, Speaker A: So let's move on from the crypto stuff. Cause really, we're making a whole few minutes out of not really that impact move. I did see a large tech company is partnering with a large bank to offer a high yield savings account.
00:05:47.216 - 00:05:48.284, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:05:48.904 - 00:05:50.352, Speaker A: Now that's a bank account.
00:05:50.528 - 00:05:50.976, Speaker B: Correct.
00:05:51.040 - 00:06:01.552, Speaker A: Through a nice tech platform giving near 4%, or in the 4.15. So that's competitive with a lot of the money markets and stuff.
00:06:01.648 - 00:06:02.168, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:06:02.216 - 00:06:33.892, Speaker A: How do you think about. Because I have said this before, I don't actually have a bank account. As a longtime fidelity employee, to the extent I need to access fiat services, I have typically used my fidelity accounts, which they have all the services. Abe, check, eight wire. I mean, it's basically a bank, except it's not. And so I wonder. But I can buy things, of course, in those accounts that I can't buy in a bank account, like securities or fixed income products, or money market funds, which have been yielding the highest, I would say, of any cash instrument.
00:06:33.892 - 00:06:45.900, Speaker A: How do you think about bank deposits versus money market funds in general? Like, the trends? I don't know, whatever. Like, I mean, why would anyone be at a bank at this point? I mean, I hate to say that I'm not trying to spark any kind of fear, but it's like, that's exactly.
00:06:45.932 - 00:07:23.344, Speaker B: The question folks should be asking themselves. Why am I at a bank that is paying me substandard yields in a world where the treasury secretary and the Fed basically told you, we're going to insure all deposits, right. We're going to create blanket facilities to, you know, that you can post securities at par and get all this financing for term, and so basically no banks going under. They might screw equity holders, but deposit holders are safe, and that's coming from senior people in the government. And so if you're telling me I have a blanket guarantee on all deposits, why wouldn't I go to the institution paying me the highest interest rate?
00:07:23.384 - 00:07:23.888, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:24.016 - 00:07:51.102, Speaker B: Like, why do I need to be at one of the GSIBs earning like sub 50 basis points when this company we just mentioned is offering 4.15 and those deposits are basically guaranteed? I don't own stock in that bank. I'm a depositor. And so what you're having happen, or what I think is about to happen, is a level of competition for deposits that has never been seen.
00:07:51.198 - 00:07:51.806, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:07:51.870 - 00:07:56.726, Speaker B: And it is going to be catalyzed by the fact that technology is better than it's ever been.
00:07:56.790 - 00:08:03.342, Speaker A: Right? So fintechs, other big tech companies, partnering with whomever they might need to correct to bring it directly, where consumers are.
00:08:03.398 - 00:08:14.756, Speaker B: Able to move money from one deposit institution to another in seconds. Right? That means that the competition for deposits is frictionless, essentially, right?
00:08:14.940 - 00:08:28.604, Speaker A: It's not like the Bailey savings and loan, where you gotta squeeze through the door and they're like, I was making this joke before about the bank runs when they were happening, right? When he's like, they're like, we need our money back. George Bailey, right? Yeah. And he's like, the money's not here. It's like in Frank's driveway and like Peter's house.
00:08:28.644 - 00:08:30.264, Speaker B: Steven's had a good voice for that.
00:08:31.564 - 00:08:45.014, Speaker A: But in those old fashioned bank runs, you just squeeze through the door. If you were like right now already, SVB, I think, was like the fastest collapse ever because of wires in mobile banking and whatnot. But it's even more so.
00:08:45.134 - 00:09:19.364, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, and just to take back, not that I'm a critic of central bankers, but when they were thinking about what the consequences were of jacking up rates this quickly, this high, they fundamentally misunderstood what banks held in their balance sheet and how quickly deposits moved in the context of, you know, deposit marketplace. And I think they're dramatically underestimating it now, too. Six months from now, people like you're going to have such intense competition for rates, I bet you those GSIB rates are going to be significantly higher.
00:09:19.444 - 00:09:19.844, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:09:19.884 - 00:09:51.106, Speaker B: And what does that mean? That means their interest rate margins, their nims are going to go down. And that is because, again, you have a blanket guarantee from the government that all deposits are safe. So why am I not in the bank, at least with my portion of my deposits that I don't need to move to some random country where one bank only has access, et cetera. But on anything that's excess, you should be in the highest possible yield, because there's no burden or hindrance to moving that money around.
00:09:51.130 - 00:09:53.666, Speaker A: Right. Frictionless. And you got fed now coming out.
00:09:53.690 - 00:09:55.258, Speaker B: Too, which fed now, theoretically.
00:09:55.306 - 00:10:01.978, Speaker A: I mean, that's more glue on the interbank side, rather than. But that should make everything move faster. Also, it's going to come out this summer.
00:10:02.066 - 00:10:33.414, Speaker B: And then now, though, you start to get into a scenario which I don't think the Fed has properly anticipated, which is six months down the line, it's going to be highest interest rate deposit institutions win the most. But what is actually happening to reserves in the market six months from now, you're going to have six more months of quantitative tightening. You're going to have a TGA balance that's going to go from $99 billion to. That's the treasury general account. That's the bank account for the treasury. It's really low right now because of the debt ceiling.
00:10:34.074 - 00:10:35.098, Speaker A: They're out of money, basically out of.
00:10:35.106 - 00:10:45.770, Speaker B: Money, but they're going to get money soon. But where does that money come from? That money comes from the banking system. So anytime that treasury account goes up, that is money being drained from the banking system. So you have QT.
00:10:45.842 - 00:10:47.242, Speaker A: They're not printing money for that. Right?
00:10:47.298 - 00:10:47.634, Speaker B: Correct.
00:10:47.714 - 00:10:48.854, Speaker A: Normal allocation.
00:10:49.434 - 00:10:49.930, Speaker B: Correct.
00:10:50.002 - 00:10:51.818, Speaker A: That is, yeah, yeah, yeah. So QT money.
00:10:51.866 - 00:10:52.178, Speaker B: QT.
00:10:52.226 - 00:10:53.522, Speaker A: And that will suck more out, too. Now.
00:10:53.538 - 00:11:16.116, Speaker B: It'll suck more out. And then get this. You still are dealing with the credit crunch impact of Silicon Valley, right. And the et cetera. Folks are gonna be lending at higher standards and at higher rates, etcetera. And so you're gonna have a credit impulse and a lot of shitty institutions or bad institutions or small ones, et cetera, are non competitive institutions.
00:11:16.180 - 00:11:16.684, Speaker A: There you go.
00:11:16.764 - 00:11:24.876, Speaker B: Right. Non competitive institutions. Imagine you bought a bunch of 30 year duration at the dead lows and yields, and you're not gonna be able to pay the highest interest rate possible.
00:11:24.940 - 00:11:31.832, Speaker A: Right. So you're gonna be much less attractive. You're gonna have less money to lend. So small businesses are gonna. That portends a lot of tightening.
00:11:31.948 - 00:11:42.592, Speaker B: It's a lot of tightening. And then throw in what we know about the back half of the year, which is. Wait, activity is going to slow. Right. Like unemployment might start ticking up back then.
00:11:42.648 - 00:11:48.924, Speaker A: You have less small business lending. If the regional banks can't, they're going to be squeezed harder than the GSIBs and the money center. Banks.
00:11:49.304 - 00:12:18.936, Speaker B: We've talked about it before, right? So there's a strange combination of things that can start to happen in the back half of the year. And I think it's totally like, misunderstood by the market. And honestly, it's a little concerning right now to me. Like, I'm a bank money market person. But stating the facts, the fact pattern is about as bad as possible. Listen to this. You've got about $160 billion between two emergency fed facilities right now.
00:12:18.936 - 00:12:59.284, Speaker B: You've had two banks that have had to get taken over by the FDIC. Another one that needed $30 billion in deposits from the largest institutions. Point blank, our banking system is in crisis and is being masked by the FDIC and these fuck. And these blanket facilities. But nobody cares because it's like, wait, there's just another random fed facility with billions of dollars. The average retail person doesn't care. But what people don't fail to realize is the US was on the brink of a systemic wide, like, banking crisis and they're able to gloss it over with a discount window facility, a BTFP.
00:12:59.284 - 00:13:14.544, Speaker B: But think about this. The idea that the most influential central bankers in the world miscalculated their monetary policy to the extent that it put the entire US banking system at risk. Right? Where is the accountability?
00:13:15.724 - 00:13:17.148, Speaker A: Anyway, it's fascinating.
00:13:17.236 - 00:13:19.864, Speaker B: I could literally rant on this for a while.
00:13:20.044 - 00:13:30.744, Speaker A: Uh, it is wild. It's truly wild. Right? We said we, I remember, was calling Whipsaw monetary policy last summer, you know, cut as fast as possible. Crap. Hike as fast as possible. Yeah. I mean, it's like they.
00:13:30.744 - 00:13:33.352, Speaker A: Which is. And it's just, it's wild and it's.
00:13:33.368 - 00:13:40.048, Speaker B: A really hard job and I respect them for doing it. And I don't necessarily know if I would ever want that job or do as well at that job.
00:13:40.096 - 00:13:40.688, Speaker A: Right.
00:13:40.856 - 00:13:56.232, Speaker B: But, you know, you have to realize that, like, bank balance sheets aren't that hard to understand. Yes, I get it. There's 4800 of them in the US. A lot of them, but they're not that hard. There's clearly a lack of, like, proper diligence in this space.
00:13:56.288 - 00:14:07.424, Speaker A: Right. It's sort of. I've seen people and some policymakers pointing to the fact that only two had to be taken over. That that's what. It's not that big a deal. And you're like, dude, that's only because they essentially offered to just give everyone money for free. Yeah.
00:14:07.424 - 00:14:11.392, Speaker A: In order to stem it. If they hadn't. I mean, if there wasn't that discount window.
00:14:11.488 - 00:14:12.224, Speaker B: Discount window.
00:14:12.264 - 00:14:13.712, Speaker A: Or the special facility.
00:14:13.808 - 00:14:15.480, Speaker B: Yeah, BFP, whatever.
00:14:15.552 - 00:14:19.416, Speaker A: We don't know. I mean, we haven't looked at all 4800 either. But many banks would be under.
00:14:19.480 - 00:14:21.002, Speaker B: Oh, many, many, many.
00:14:21.128 - 00:14:21.462, Speaker A: Why?
00:14:21.518 - 00:14:33.954, Speaker B: But now, think about this, though. The largest institutions now as a function of this banking crisis are now, like, they've lost a pretty big competitive advantage. And so, like.
00:14:34.454 - 00:14:36.894, Speaker A: Oh, you mean the sort of the. Too big to fail.
00:14:36.974 - 00:14:37.614, Speaker B: Too big to fail.
00:14:37.654 - 00:14:39.454, Speaker A: Now, if everyone's kind of backstopped, so.
00:14:39.494 - 00:14:42.846, Speaker B: Small, you can't fail. I don't know how to come up. Like, what's the count?
00:14:42.910 - 00:15:05.158, Speaker A: And, you know, the treasury secretary. I remember there was a viral clip when Janet Yellen was in Congress a month ago or so, was asked this by a congressperson about their own local, when she was in front of the Senate. So a senator about their own local small bank, would that also be covered? And she was sort of like, meh, meh. No, but, like, when we. Like. So they're kind of saying we haven't backstopped the whole thing, but we kind of know they have.
00:15:05.326 - 00:15:11.230, Speaker B: But here's their angle, is we've backstopped it, but we're only backstopping the depositors, not the equity holders.
00:15:11.262 - 00:15:12.158, Speaker A: That's what they have said. Right.
00:15:12.206 - 00:15:13.582, Speaker B: And so they're, you know, you run.
00:15:13.598 - 00:15:16.286, Speaker A: A bad bank, you're gonna lose all your money. Like, as the owner of the bank.
00:15:16.350 - 00:15:16.994, Speaker B: Yes.
00:15:17.414 - 00:15:19.158, Speaker A: But if you're just a humble depositor.
00:15:19.246 - 00:15:22.494, Speaker B: Yeah, they're giving the middle finger to the stockholder.
00:15:22.534 - 00:15:41.006, Speaker A: But that was something that depositors. Your point at GSIBS. Right. The biggest banks, literally the book, too big to fail about those banks during the great financial crisis. It's been long understood and implied and believed by the market that they were too big to fail, that if those faced crisis, they would absolutely be backstopped and.
00:15:41.070 - 00:15:41.630, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:15:41.702 - 00:15:44.954, Speaker A: And that was a competitive advantage for them. That's really interesting. Yeah.
00:15:45.254 - 00:15:48.590, Speaker B: But now I'm like, why do I need an account at any age?
00:15:48.622 - 00:15:51.150, Speaker A: Just go wherever the go. Wherever the yield's highest. Go.
00:15:51.182 - 00:15:54.054, Speaker B: Wherever the yield's highest. Cause it's guaranteed by the government.
00:15:54.134 - 00:15:58.918, Speaker A: Very interesting. Bimnet Abibi, my friend, as always, from galaxy trading. Thank you so much.
00:15:59.006 - 00:15:59.518, Speaker B: Pleasure.
00:15:59.606 - 00:16:03.814, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Christine Kim from Galaxy Research. Great to have you on the show again, Christine, as always.
00:16:03.894 - 00:16:05.222, Speaker C: Thanks, Alex, for having me.
00:16:05.278 - 00:16:28.080, Speaker A: So one of the main impetuses to have you on the show, of course, although we always love having you, was the completion of the Shanghai and capella upgrades last week on Ethereum. You were following it. You've been following it. I joked that you were the queen of the merge with your coverage last summer and into the fall. Just what are your initial reaction from a big picture standpoint on the completion here of the merge?
00:16:28.192 - 00:17:05.390, Speaker C: The upgrade went really smoothly, and it reminded me a little bit of how I felt when the merge was happening. There was so much anticipation, so much excitement and a lot of anxiety around how the upgrade could go. Like, for the merge, it was just a technically very complex upgrade. But for Shanghai, a lot of the concern was around cell pressure and around how much, how much withdrawal activity we were going to see right at the time of Shanghai. But for both events, the merge went extremely smoothly. There wasn't any bugs, no technical failures. So it was a pretty boring evening for the night of Shanghai, which was at 06:30 p.m..
00:17:05.390 - 00:17:49.454, Speaker C: I was also here in the office anticipating a lot of movement, a lot of market activity. I thought we were gonna see just large swaths of withdrawals. A ton of validators that had been in the exeq for a while start to get unstaked, which we did see some of that activity. But honestly, the upgrade went so smoothly and people were so bullish about the upgrade having gone smoothly that all of my anxieties around. Would the upgrade go? Well, it was kind of a non event, so it was a very boring evening. It reminded me of, like, wow, I did this, like, six months ago, and, like, it feels the same. Yeah, a very, yeah.
00:17:49.534 - 00:18:15.368, Speaker A: So we'll get into it in detail in a minute. We'll also talk about some other random crypto news to chit chat about. But let's dive deeper. Here on Shanghai, we talked about, like, withdrawals. Like, what did that end up looking? I mean, it's now, today's Wednesday, what, the 19th? It was last Wednesday, the 12th. You're listening on Friday, the 21st. So I guess it's been a week.
00:18:15.368 - 00:18:18.032, Speaker A: I mean, what have withdrawals looked like? Right?
00:18:18.208 - 00:19:10.832, Speaker C: Yeah. So we've seen about over 1 million ETH become liquid initially, like the first couple of days right after Shanghai. So after that Wednesday, you saw a lot of backlogged rewards, rewards that validators have been accruing since 2020 from the beacon chain become liquid. So you did see, like, a huge spike in the number of daily withdrawals happening. But after that period, basically the number of withdrawals that are happening for validators shrunk quite dramatically because everyone's backlogged withdrawal rewards had already been withdrawn. And so now when the sweep comes around again, it's basically an automatic every couple hours, your rewards become withdrawn, your rewards become liquid. And so there's just not that many rewards anymore to withdraw.
00:19:10.832 - 00:19:45.368, Speaker C: So you saw, there's a pretty, a very popular chart that's been shared from Nansen, but you saw kind of like a spike in the number of partial withdrawals the first couple days after Shanghai. And then you saw that number diminish quite rapidly. And then, I think around four days after Shanghai happened. So during the weekend after Shanghai, you saw a bunch of validators have the appropriate credentials to be able to receive partial withdrawals, because right at Shanghai, there was only a couple of validators that had the correct.
00:19:45.456 - 00:19:46.904, Speaker A: They were probably set up, basically.
00:19:46.984 - 00:20:27.034, Speaker C: And so you saw another spike again of, like, those validators with the backlog of rewards be able to withdraw their ETH. And then you saw that kind of taper off really quickly in the same timeline. And so now we're in this phase of just the majority of validators now having their rewards being withdrawn every couple hours or so, and there's not a lot there. Issuance isn't, as we know, because of how deflationary ETH has become as an asset. We know that there's not a ton of rewards that validators are accruing on a day to day basis, certainly less than what was being accrued to miners before the merge.
00:20:27.074 - 00:20:52.636, Speaker A: And then what about, like, straight up validator exits? Right? I mean, there were some big groups. One that we had thought was Kraken, since they had agreed with the SEC to shut down. They're staking as a service program. Cause when you talk about the rewards and the partial withdrawals, we're talking about those newly minted ETH that validators had to earn, but not the principal ETH, not the principal balance of 32 ETH per validator as being big exits. But have we seen those, too?
00:20:52.780 - 00:21:01.276, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I mean, the amount of ETH being withdrawn, the amount of ETH being liquid is. The vast majority of it is rewards. Yeah, but that includes.
00:21:01.300 - 00:21:03.788, Speaker A: That 1 million ETH number includes exiting validators, too.
00:21:03.836 - 00:21:46.394, Speaker C: It does. But the majority of that 1 million ETH number is, I would say, probably, like, 80% is partial. But you're right, we have seen a large number of exiting validators. So just to give context, there was about 500,000 active validators, and we saw about 15,000 validators exit. And currently, I believe there's an additional 15,000 in the queue waiting to exit. There was some analysis done on what kind of validators are these? Who are the operators? And like you said, the entity that was unstaking. The highest number of validators was Kraken, and we understand why they are.
00:21:46.394 - 00:22:19.682, Speaker C: So I would say in terms of exiting validators, we have seen quite a number of validators restaking back into the network. The number of new deposits is also increasing. So I would say if you think about the number of validators exiting and the number of validators entering, it's about one quarter of validators. The amount of validators that are exiting and the amount of validators that are coming in. The amount of validators that are coming in are about one quarter of the amount of the amount exiting.
00:22:19.738 - 00:22:38.214, Speaker A: So a million ETH, what, the supply is about 120 million or so ETH total. So it's less than a percent of the supply became unlocked or newly liquid. Obviously, the rest of the supply is not necessarily liquid. Not an insignificant number, but not enormous.
00:22:38.334 - 00:23:15.702, Speaker C: No. And a quarter of that coming back into the network. And a lot of the activity that we saw in terms of how much ETH is going to exchanges potentially to sell. And I really wish there were more data around this, more data on aggregating the validator labeled addresses and seeing what flows are flowing to exchange. We had that for Ethereum miners, but unfortunately, we haven't quite caught up on this end. But from Keiko, I did notice that they were reporting on some cell pressure activity since Shanghai. And they reported, I think, like something around $25 million worth of cell pressure, which is really minimal.
00:23:15.702 - 00:23:18.754, Speaker C: I think in terms of their volume, that's not much.
00:23:19.174 - 00:23:47.936, Speaker A: And of course, like, through the first week after, this was a pretty bullish environment for bitcoin and ETH. So I think plenty of demand. I mean, today, on Wednesday, the 19th, as we record this, this is a little bit of a red day for cryptos. Bitcoin, you can see behind me, is trading at 29. Two ETH was down below two k, but I think it was about at two k. I don't think those are mostly technical levels. I think we saw a chunky bitcoin seller on binance wipe out.
00:23:47.936 - 00:24:01.834, Speaker A: Cause some liquidations, but doesn't seem withdrawal related really, either. So it seems like you said at the top, a little bit of a non event from a market standpoint other than people are excited. And now there's this new thing you can do on ETH that you couldn't do without risk.
00:24:01.944 - 00:24:08.814, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, we were talking about this yesterday, but the big question now is, what is the next narrative for Ethereum? What is the next big thing?
00:24:08.894 - 00:24:20.902, Speaker A: Yeah, what is next? So now they can. I was saying this week that they can go ahead and move on. Finally developers can finally work on other stuff. What are they working on and thinking about what is next from a development standpoint.
00:24:20.998 - 00:24:55.862, Speaker C: So from a development standpoint, developers are thinking now of scalability through the proto Dank sharding EIP 4844, which has been in the pipeline for I think over a year now. The next upgrade for the execution layer is called Cancun and then for the consensus layer it's called Deneb. So I think the merge name is Dankoon. Dankoon. It's gonna be something weird. But anyways, just to clarify this now, because there was a lot of confusion around the time of Shanghai happening, right.
00:24:55.878 - 00:25:00.434, Speaker A: Because both, both layers were upgraded. Right? So Shanghai and capella.
00:25:00.554 - 00:25:00.970, Speaker C: Yes.
00:25:01.042 - 00:25:04.614, Speaker A: So people were saying Chappella, like Dave Chappelle. Right.
00:25:05.194 - 00:25:17.290, Speaker C: But yes. So, yeah, so Cancun, Deneb is all about adding in a new fee market, adding in a new transaction type to really make the cost of L2 transactions cheaper.
00:25:17.362 - 00:25:48.048, Speaker A: And this is where we were talking. I think we said, you and I had a discussion. I tweeted this somewhat provocatively a few months ago, that in its simplest form there's obviously differences, but 4844, proto Dank charting is kind of like Segwit. There's a lot of similarities and I'm going to give my layman's attempt at this, but they're creating a new transaction type and a new space and fee market for where those transactions go. They call them blobs. Right. A new blob space basically specifically for roll up settlement transactions.
00:25:48.048 - 00:25:55.800, Speaker A: So now those can they have their own lane to drive on the Ethereum highway that has like slightly cheaper fees or something else. Right.
00:25:55.872 - 00:25:57.914, Speaker C: And it can also be pruned away.
00:25:58.104 - 00:26:08.150, Speaker A: So it really is, it's prunable. It's a special area for certain types of transactions and if you use those types of transactions, the network incentivizes you by lowering the base fee.
00:26:08.342 - 00:26:29.158, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I mean, one of my concerns is that the amount of space that is going to be given initially through proto dank sharding will not be enough for the demand on these L2 rollups, especially with the launch of like ZKe vms and other optimistic type rollups. I wonder if that lane will also become quickly congested.
00:26:29.246 - 00:26:41.514, Speaker A: Interesting. So wasn't that touted as the, I don't know. With Ethereum it's never the end all be all solution. They'll always have something else they want to do. But wasn't that touted as the main major scalability upgrade.
00:26:42.934 - 00:27:25.890, Speaker C: Yes, it was. And I think dank sharding in its fullest form will implement a lot more scalability. I don't know, initiatives, but proto dang sharding I think is a little bit like a prototype of what the use of Ethereum as a data availability layer could look like. If all Ethereum DAPP activity does move to L2 s. Here is some of the groundwork that we need to lay to support that kind of activity. So it is, I think the right first step. But I would probably caution people from thinking that this is going to significantly scale Ethereum to this next upgrade specifically.
00:27:25.890 - 00:27:32.970, Speaker C: Yeah, for Cancun and Deneb. I think that, yeah, I would probably caution like becoming overly Dancoon.
00:27:33.082 - 00:27:41.114, Speaker A: I'm calling it right now. So that's really interesting. When do we expect Cancun now? Like what's the sort of timeline for that? I mean usually it's about every six months, right?
00:27:41.194 - 00:27:57.648, Speaker C: Exactly. Roughly around six months. But you know, developers have been working on EIP 4844 in parallel to Shanghai. It is quite a complex upgrade though. So I would imagine end of this year if not early next year.
00:27:57.696 - 00:27:58.136, Speaker A: Got it.
00:27:58.200 - 00:28:06.648, Speaker C: Yeah, and fingers crossed. I'm actually kind of secretly hoping for early next year. Like let's have some breathing room here. We've done a lot of complex upgrades already.
00:28:06.736 - 00:28:07.992, Speaker A: Like let's take a victory lap.
00:28:08.048 - 00:28:11.528, Speaker C: Yeah, let's take a victory lap. But I'm sure other people are like, no, let's like keep.
00:28:11.576 - 00:28:28.660, Speaker A: Well that's the thing. Cause I recall during the Shanghai developer debate about what to put in Shanghai there were a lot of people and obviously we know what they went with, which is primarily only unstaking. But there were a lot of developers and users who said, whoa, whoa, whoa, what about all this other stuff we want that's ready to go?
00:28:28.852 - 00:28:31.116, Speaker C: Yeah, there's going to be clearly some.
00:28:31.140 - 00:28:33.436, Speaker A: Demand to keep chugging along.
00:28:33.540 - 00:28:38.684, Speaker C: Oh, there's so much. And even for Denkun, I can't believe I'm co opting this term now.
00:28:38.764 - 00:28:42.292, Speaker A: It's either that or Kank Neb, and I don't like Kank Neb that much.
00:28:42.468 - 00:29:29.994, Speaker C: But for the next upgrade, there's quite a list of vip's that had tried to get into Shanghai wasn't able to and now developers are going to need to prioritize again. To what extent do we make the next upgrade solely focused on EIP 4844? Also include things like EOF, include other optimizations to Ethereum's fee market. The list is quite long. I will say though, that now that Shanghai is over, I do wonder. So I've said what developers are going to start focusing on, which is scalability. I wonder what the next criticism from bitcoin maxis are going to be about what Ethereum will do in its next upgrade, because up until now it's been that ethereum will never transition to proof of stake. Ethereum will never activate unstaking.
00:29:30.614 - 00:29:37.194, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm not sure. I haven't seen what the new ETH fud to drop is on this, but.
00:29:37.494 - 00:29:38.550, Speaker C: I'm sure there'll be something.
00:29:38.622 - 00:30:03.580, Speaker A: They'll come up with something. All right, this is great. Let's talk about some random news. We've got some interesting and funny items, and let's go right with lido, since we're talking about staking. The news was that lido deposits, so I assume they surpass 12 billion with liquid staking. The headline here was as ethereum schappella boosts liquid staking. I'm assuming lido deposits means people putting their ETH in Lido so that they get staked ETH back.
00:30:03.580 - 00:30:07.692, Speaker A: And so that's more ETH validators that lido will be spinning up.
00:30:07.788 - 00:30:08.436, Speaker C: Yup, 100%.
00:30:08.460 - 00:30:37.200, Speaker A: What's your take on that? Oh, by the way, I will say the TvL. So the total amount of ethanol, so that's $12 billion worth of ETH that it has surpassed the Tvl is 6 million ETH. Right. So I mean that's well over a percent of all ETH in existence is staked through Lido. And that would be just over 12 billion. It's up 20% Lido tvl in ETH terms since January 1.
00:30:37.312 - 00:30:37.816, Speaker C: Wow.
00:30:37.920 - 00:30:39.470, Speaker A: What's your take on the lido in general?
00:30:39.592 - 00:31:01.162, Speaker C: I mean, initially I think that shows that there's a high confidence in Ethereum as a proof of stake consensus protocol and demand for people who want to stake their ETH earn rewards, especially now that Shanghai has been. I guess there's a lot of people who see Shanghai as like a de risking event of like now. We should be able to stake even more because we know that we can.
00:31:01.178 - 00:31:02.674, Speaker A: Nobody can get it out if we have to.
00:31:02.794 - 00:31:23.252, Speaker C: So I think that's really good for confidence in Ethereum's proof of stake protocol. But I would say the other spin on it is that a lot of those flows are flowing to a central staking pool. Yeah. And before Shanghai even happened, I think there was lots of concerns around is Lido growing too big? Too big on Ethereum? Too big is it now?
00:31:23.308 - 00:31:28.396, Speaker A: Do we know? I mean, I haven't looked in a while, actually, but it remains still over 30% of all staked.
00:31:28.420 - 00:31:54.640, Speaker C: ETH is staked with Lido. And clearly their dominance and their competitiveness over other staking pools seems set to grow. I will mention that Racquetpool did an upgrade yesterday, Tuesday, so, like, five days after Shanghai, enabling stake Deeth withdrawals, but also increasing their scalability. But Lido, by far continues to dominate, and I think that presents a central point of failure.
00:31:54.752 - 00:31:56.444, Speaker A: All right, Donald Trump.
00:31:57.104 - 00:31:58.576, Speaker C: Why are we talking about Donald Trump?
00:31:58.600 - 00:32:27.856, Speaker A: Donald Trump, he had released a digital trading card. Trump cards, they were nfts, I think at the beginning of the year or so. If I recall, a few months ago, there were 45,000 of them issued or mintable, and then with a cap on 45,000. And I guess because he was the 45th president. Check out the video of him announcing that drop, by the way, is pretty funny. But he, I guess I'm gonna call this a rugging. He is kind of rugging.
00:32:27.856 - 00:32:56.420, Speaker A: Those purchasers of the 45,000, which had traded almost as high as one ETH per card at one point, because now they're releasing another digital trading cards collection. And the series of, the second series of his trading cards went on sale with the NFT selling for $99 and the project. Yeah, so the first one, the floor price of his first nfts is down 66% on the news because there's a.
00:32:56.452 - 00:33:03.300, Speaker C: New Donald Trump collection. Shouldn't supporters be really happy that Donald Trump is, like, doubling down on nfts as the way to, like, make his.
00:33:03.372 - 00:33:13.684, Speaker A: Who supports NFT supporters, the buyers? I don't know. But I mean, it's like, you know, it doesn't seem scarce to me. If the creator can just, you know, release.
00:33:13.724 - 00:33:15.484, Speaker C: He's not duplicating the previous collection.
00:33:15.524 - 00:33:15.972, Speaker A: I actually don't know.
00:33:15.988 - 00:33:16.724, Speaker C: It's a new collection.
00:33:16.764 - 00:33:19.744, Speaker A: Is it not duplicating? I'm not sure. I hope it's not.
00:33:20.164 - 00:33:22.588, Speaker C: It's a new collection. It's like a second go around.
00:33:22.636 - 00:33:24.184, Speaker A: No, it's a totally different artwork.
00:33:24.724 - 00:33:25.740, Speaker C: I have no idea, actually.
00:33:25.812 - 00:33:27.424, Speaker A: Is Donald Trump an artist?
00:33:28.164 - 00:33:30.060, Speaker C: He clearly is. He clearly is.
00:33:30.092 - 00:33:31.428, Speaker A: Is he making these himself?
00:33:31.596 - 00:33:34.916, Speaker C: He's an influencer now. An NFT connoisseur.
00:33:35.020 - 00:33:41.428, Speaker A: Wow, that's a. So from president of the United States to mere NFT connoisseur. Quite a drop for the 45th president.
00:33:41.596 - 00:33:48.344, Speaker C: Or an upgrade, depending on how you think about it.
00:33:48.844 - 00:34:19.741, Speaker A: I just. The former president of the United States is releasing his second NFT collection. Just, you know, the crazy doesn't the humor and the crazy does not. It knows no end sometimes in this world. All right, this is interesting. Let's talk about David Marcus, the former PayPal executive, the former leader of the Libra initiative at Facebook, which was Facebook Meta's Libra DM. There's too many names, but we're going to say Facebook and library.
00:34:19.741 - 00:34:51.614, Speaker A: That was going to be Facebook's stablecoin. Basically it was going to be at first, a basket of currencies, global currencies were going to back this stablecoin which drew the ire of global monetary authorities because that looks like a international, almost like, what's it called? The SPR, the IMF's basket of currencies. I forget what it's called. They were worried it would be could grow so large. Facebook has over a billion users. Maybe it's two, I don't even know. It's a lot.
00:34:51.614 - 00:35:24.194, Speaker A: And so they push back and then eventually they said it would be a dollar backed stablecoin, but then eventually they jettisoned the entire thing. Right? Pieces of this broke off. Silvergate bank bought some of the API and payments tech. Aptos and SWE are two public blockchains that spun out from developers of Libra. And David Marcus went to found a bitcoin lightning network focused payment company called Lightspark. And just over the last week, they finally unveiled their product. It is a bitcoin payments product.
00:35:24.194 - 00:35:26.774, Speaker A: It's like stripe for bitcoin, right?
00:35:26.934 - 00:35:36.886, Speaker C: Yeah. I didn't notice anything particularly notable, I think, about how this differs from existing payment, bitcoin payment solutions like open node.
00:35:36.950 - 00:35:56.916, Speaker A: Right? Yeah, I didn't either. But it is. They have some pricing. I think you can check it out on their website. Just search Lightspark. Yeah, I guess the idea is, you know, you're a merchant, you want to accept, I don't know, you need credit cards, Apple Pay, PayPal, check out with bitcoin, click the bitcoin button and bam, you've got Lightspark providing that whole service for you. And there are.
00:35:56.916 - 00:36:07.476, Speaker A: Yeah, there are. I mean, bitpay is one of the oldest, been around for a long time. They do multiple cryptos, open node, strike. There are several others, right, offer these services.
00:36:07.660 - 00:36:08.188, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:36:08.276 - 00:36:19.808, Speaker A: But I will say Taj Drija, co inventor of the Lightning Network, co author of the lightning paper with Joseph Poon, who works on ethel two stuff now I believe he works for. He's the senior researcher at Lightspark.
00:36:19.856 - 00:36:21.896, Speaker C: So maybe, maybe notable bitcoiners.
00:36:21.960 - 00:36:46.774, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe there's more to come. And I agree from a product standpoint so far. It's interesting, but it doesn't seem that much different than what we've seen many people start. You can even use BTC pay server, which is an open source plugin to let you accept bitcoin. You can't do fiat conversion. But David Marcus, pretty famous, longtime expert in payments. I don't know, are we bullish on this?
00:36:46.934 - 00:37:44.396, Speaker C: I really like the focus on payments as a use case for crypto. I think that really goes back to the fundamentals of what crypto can do, even if it was only a duplicate. I think of other payment solutions. Even then we need more focus and innovation and research and capital being spent on building out the rails of how crypto can be used as payments. It's really interesting that David Marcus from the Libra project went to found this company and some of his other developers and other researchers went to go and found other l one general purpose blockchains like Aptos and SWE. It does show how diverse the amount of infrastructure and the amount of development activity that's happening in just building one crypto project and how it's fractioned off into several innovative ideas of how to make crypto better.
00:37:44.500 - 00:38:09.860, Speaker A: I love it. I think it's going to be interesting. All right, one more topic. We've written a lot about mica. Mica. I call it Mica, but I think they call it mica in Europe. The markets in crypto assets legislation, which is a comprehensive but bespoke regulation framework for crypto, regulates things like exchanges and stable coins and trading and market infrastructure, how to operate legally in Europe.
00:38:09.860 - 00:38:35.808, Speaker A: Been in process for many years. I'm told that it is set for approval, final approval by lawmakers who will vote in the EU parliament tomorrow, on Thursday. So if it was good, then you listen on Friday and it will have happened. Apparently it is going to be easily approved in a vote. It has wide support. Are we bullish about this? I know Tim Grant, our head of Europe, Middle east and Africa, is, yeah, 100%.
00:38:35.896 - 00:39:18.364, Speaker C: It's been a long time coming and following the. The approval process for Micah has been so illuminating. The lawmaking process. Oh my gosh. The number of different approvals that need to be had and how easily something that has been passed by one body can be reverted back into draft phase and then picked back up again several years later is kind of wild to me. I will note that one thing specifically about the bullishness baronet of what mica means to crypto adoption in the EU. Mica does set forth quite a bit of regulatory clarity around how crypto companies should be overseen.
00:39:18.364 - 00:40:02.626, Speaker C: But there are parallel other pieces of law that are being built around anti money laundering and KYC that I think are also important to track alongside mica, in that mica is a very comprehensive piece of legislation, but it's not the only piece of legislation that focuses on how crypto can be used in the EU. And now that, as we're following Micah, obviously there's quite a lot of conversation around what this means for AML and KYC compliance that, in my opinion, are looking to be more restrictive and could be more damaging. I think so.
00:40:02.730 - 00:40:27.122, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw this. There is an AML bill that you're referring to that looks kind of similar to the US Treasury Department's DeFi report. They want defi services to register and conduct KYC users, daos, NFC exchanges. They put limits on the transferability of cryptos to and from unhosted wallets. That phrase is back.
00:40:27.298 - 00:40:27.842, Speaker C: Yes.
00:40:27.938 - 00:40:44.154, Speaker A: So it is damaging and also, I mean, probably impossible to comply with for many types of truly decentralized applications. Right. It's not great, but that's not in mica. They don't actually have AML in Mica, so this is a separate thing to pay attention to.
00:40:44.314 - 00:41:06.366, Speaker C: Yeah. And I do believe that on the legislation around unhosted wallets, there was a version of it that did get passed, like, a year ago by the EU, and the language around it was significantly watered down since the original version. So I do actually think that there's quite a lot of benefit to the lawmaking process being so collaborative and so long.
00:41:06.470 - 00:41:07.918, Speaker A: 26 countries, you know?
00:41:08.006 - 00:41:11.806, Speaker C: Yeah. Some of these laws get changed quite drastically before they are signed.
00:41:11.870 - 00:41:14.774, Speaker A: So there's still some chance in your mind to modify this one, too?
00:41:14.814 - 00:41:15.862, Speaker C: Oh, 100%, yeah.
00:41:15.918 - 00:41:43.804, Speaker A: I will say, too, you talk about following the EU legislative process, no offense to the Europeans, but it makes me really value things that we have in the US, like Congress, dot gov, and C SPAN, where it's, like, very easy to understand the current state of a bill. Very hard, but I get it. 26 nations coming together for that. Really interesting stuff. We'll follow it more. Christine, as always, so great to have you on galaxy brains.
