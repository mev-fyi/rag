00:00:00.240 - 00:00:21.022, Speaker A: If the United States doesn't press its advantage, other nations will. And other nations are. And those nations might be ones who do not see the world the way that we do and who choose to build a different future that is much more damaging to our values than an american bitcoin industry ever could be. Welcome to Galaxy Brains, an infinite amount of cash.
00:00:21.118 - 00:00:21.750, Speaker B: Cash.
00:00:21.902 - 00:00:28.398, Speaker C: I'm your host, Alex Thornton. The us banking system is sound and resilient. Bitcoin made a new all time high.
00:00:28.566 - 00:00:29.454, Speaker D: If you're not long.
00:00:29.534 - 00:00:36.834, Speaker B: If you're not long, you're short. Galaxy's going to come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet. All bitcoin's going to be erased.
00:00:37.774 - 00:00:39.394, Speaker D: Bitcoin is the best crypto.
00:00:40.214 - 00:00:42.274, Speaker B: Bitcoin is going to zero.
00:00:43.254 - 00:01:02.462, Speaker C: Welcome to Galaxy Brains. I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmware research at Galaxy. Bitcoin, not zero. And we're back for another great episode. Hey, that clip at the front of the episode is from my speech a few weeks ago at the Bitcoin Policy Institute summit at the National Press Club. Stay tuned to the end of the pod to hear the entirety of that speech. It's ten minutes long.
00:01:02.462 - 00:01:35.504, Speaker C: And we have a great episode for you today. Austin Campbell, professor at Columbia Business School, former portfolio manager of BUSD at Paxos, and stablecoin expert and regulatory expert. He joins us. He is a return repeat guest. We're going to get into it with him about the state of regulation and stablecoins in the US. And of course, we'll check with our good friend Bimnet, a BB from Galaxy trading, as always, to talk markets. Before we get to that, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities.
00:01:35.504 - 00:01:38.484, Speaker C: Oh, man. Well, look, we are back.
00:01:38.524 - 00:01:40.244, Speaker A: It was like we were in the.
00:01:40.324 - 00:01:55.312, Speaker C: 50 thousands last week with bitcoin. Now we're up over 60k again. So it's something like 107 days in bitcoin history. We've traded over 60k, more than 2% now of bitcoin's life. Life. So that, you know, feels a little more constructive, right, Phineas?
00:01:55.488 - 00:01:58.000, Speaker D: Positive news. Positive news.
00:01:58.072 - 00:02:02.392, Speaker C: You can't be unhappy when the price goes up. I mean, look, I. I've learned.
00:02:02.448 - 00:02:07.408, Speaker D: I learned a long time ago. Just try to have zero emotion towards any of it. Well, cause not possible.
00:02:07.496 - 00:02:13.416, Speaker C: We started this podcast, I think, in, what, 2021 or two, was it two even?
00:02:13.560 - 00:02:14.448, Speaker A: I guess it was two.
00:02:14.496 - 00:02:16.256, Speaker D: It was two, but early two.
00:02:16.360 - 00:02:24.624, Speaker C: Yeah, early two. And so we wrote it pretty far down. Got all the way down to 16. Five. I remember this, the start of last year. We were doing pods.
00:02:24.704 - 00:02:42.104, Speaker D: Yep. Oh, yeah. We were doing pods. We were, you know, we were talking long term. Well, I wanted to say I was able to listen to your, what sounds like a stump speech for presidential campaign, but we vote. Alex, we ran a clip at the beginning of the episode. We're gonna run the full clip at the end of the episode.
00:02:42.104 - 00:02:47.988, Speaker D: I would encourage people to stay tuned for that. It's good. Got a lot of great stuff in there. It's also very. Alex.
00:02:48.036 - 00:02:48.784, Speaker C: It's very.
00:02:49.684 - 00:02:57.460, Speaker D: He was just saying that he's living my best life. He's got a little Obama in him. He thinks something, but it's actually a great speech and a lot of information. So we're gonna run that at the end of the episode.
00:02:57.492 - 00:03:04.644, Speaker C: Nice. And you had some questions for me about news that happened this week. I forget what they were.
00:03:04.724 - 00:03:06.824, Speaker D: The truth is, I need translation.
00:03:08.804 - 00:03:09.188, Speaker B: For.
00:03:09.236 - 00:03:22.568, Speaker D: Stuff that happens in crypto news. So a couple of things. One, microstrategy building decentralized id on bitcoin using ordinals like inscriptions, things being built on bitcoin. Can you explain this?
00:03:22.616 - 00:03:52.244, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah. So, microstrategy, I think probably the largest single holder of bitcoin in the world now. Maybe just above the us government itself. Yeah. They announced, I was actually in Las Vegas last week for the Bitcoin for corporations conference, their conference. And at that conference, they announced this new decentralized identity scheme that basically takes verified credentials and keys and rolls them all up into bitcoin so that you can reference them on bitcoin, which is a Universal ledger that's widely available.
00:03:52.244 - 00:04:14.480, Speaker C: And then the first product that they're building on it is a pretty simple signature to a plugin for Microsoft Outlook. So you could be like, oh, I get an email from Phineas, who's like, hey, Alex, send me that bitcoin we talked about. And I'm like, wait a sec, this doesn't have the orange check mark. It's not Phineas. Right. And it's pretty straightforward. I don't know, decentralized id, a pretty big topic.
00:04:14.480 - 00:04:19.320, Speaker C: And interesting to see microstrategy getting in there with some bitcoin software product.
00:04:19.512 - 00:04:35.684, Speaker D: Super quick follow up. Do you like this? Your opinion? It's being built on bitcoin. This is like, we hear this a lot from our guests on the show. Repeatedly. They either fall into one camp or another. Typically, people like bitcoin being used in this way. Some people don't.
00:04:35.684 - 00:04:37.246, Speaker D: What's your take on it?
00:04:37.310 - 00:04:58.422, Speaker C: No, I like it. I think it's quite interesting. I think did is interesting. And bitcoin's a universal ledger, so it's widely accessible. I think there's other approaches to this. Microsoft's ion stores the credentials in a Microsoft server, but they're secure. And Block Inc.
00:04:58.422 - 00:05:07.324, Speaker C: Is working on something at TBD. It's called, called TBD. There's a number of approaches. I'm not really an expert, but I do like the. I like the use of bitcoin. I think it's interesting.
00:05:07.704 - 00:05:16.608, Speaker D: Number two, tether sees record net profit of over $4.5 billion in first quarter of 2024.
00:05:16.736 - 00:05:40.024, Speaker C: I mean, keep in mind, most of their profit is coming from earning interest on the treasury collateral that backs the USDT stablecoin. They don't pass any of that through to their token holders. If you're a bank and you hold treasuries, you typically pass some of the interest you earn back to your depositors. Right. That's what a savings account is. So, I mean, they figured out a little bit of cheat code. It won't last forever.
00:05:40.024 - 00:05:42.644, Speaker C: It's very tied to interest rates, but, you know, good for them.
00:05:43.144 - 00:05:50.096, Speaker D: Okay, number three, the justice department charges Roger Ver with tax fraud. Tell me about this.
00:05:50.160 - 00:06:22.564, Speaker C: Yeah, this is tough to, you know, I don't know. We don't know the facts here. And I see what the allegations are. Apparently, Roger Veer in exiting, giving up his us citizenship. You have to pay like a bunch of taxes. I don't know the rules, but it's like there's a pen, a one time penalty, and then for, like, you have to pay like seven or, you know, several years of taxes you would have paid. And the Justice Department's alleging that he hid or mischaracterized some of his bitcoin wealth and owes 47, I think, or $48 million in back taxes.
00:06:22.564 - 00:06:48.224, Speaker C: He was arrested. To me, it's kind of surprising. Like, this is a guy who certainly at the time had millions, hundreds of millions of dollars of bitcoin. And he was a very early adopter, sort of fell out with the bitcoin mainstream community because of his die hard support for bitcoin cash, the fork of bitcoin. But I mean, you'd think he could just pay that potentially rather than have to be arrested over it. I don't know. We'll see.
00:06:49.684 - 00:06:57.024, Speaker D: And lastly, binance founder Changpeng Zhao. Sentenced to four months czech in prison.
00:06:57.104 - 00:07:22.128, Speaker C: So he paid $4 billion fine, and now he's spending four months in prison. And I think a lot of our audience will know that four has been a joke that he's been saying for years. He had a tweet that was like, things you need to remember, like, whatever. And I'm just gonna refer to these going forward by these numbers. And one was like, I don't know, x, y, z. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose. Four was like, ignore the fudge.
00:07:22.166 - 00:07:23.076, Speaker A: And then he would just get into.
00:07:23.100 - 00:07:33.268, Speaker C: The habit of just tweeting four. Or, like, there's a picture of him holding up four. And that was, like, two years ago. And now this man is only serving four months and paying 4 billion. And it's like, dude, what?
00:07:33.316 - 00:07:34.348, Speaker D: That's classic crypto.
00:07:34.396 - 00:07:35.468, Speaker C: Do we live in a simulation?
00:07:35.596 - 00:07:44.268, Speaker D: It's classic crypto community stuff, though. It's like, of course there's gonna be some deeper thing going on.
00:07:44.436 - 00:07:45.316, Speaker C: It's very strange.
00:07:45.380 - 00:07:46.092, Speaker D: It's very interesting.
00:07:46.148 - 00:07:54.064, Speaker C: Yeah. And you got millions of people online following someone like him. And, like, you know, I mean, this one was pretty obvious. I mean, really, he was known for four.
00:07:54.644 - 00:07:55.300, Speaker D: Fascinating.
00:07:55.372 - 00:07:59.212, Speaker C: And then he gets four months and 4 billion. It's just like, you almost can't write it.
00:07:59.348 - 00:08:01.252, Speaker A: Some people were saying it's too lenient a sentence.
00:08:01.308 - 00:08:29.112, Speaker C: I would just point out, first of all, that he paid, I think, the highest fine in the history of the DOJ. And also, you know, I mean, banks have done this activity a lot. You don't see any bankers that have gone to jail for it. So I think it was probably a reasonable thing. And look, we also found out during this whole thing that binance was solvent, you know? So just from my perspective, it's not a Sam Bankman fried situation where he stole money from his users. Right? So. But anyway, he did.
00:08:29.112 - 00:08:36.528, Speaker C: He broke the law, he's serving time, and I guess he'll get out in four months. I don't know. It's gonna be interesting to see what CZ does next.
00:08:36.576 - 00:08:38.288, Speaker D: He'll pay 4 million, and he'll get out in four months.
00:08:38.336 - 00:08:46.536, Speaker C: Yeah. All right, let's go right into the show. Let's go now to our guest, Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy brands.
00:08:46.600 - 00:08:47.724, Speaker E: Thanks for having me.
00:08:48.124 - 00:09:15.930, Speaker C: So, you know, it feels, from a news standpoint, certainly less busy than last week and some of the prior weeks with all the data and the Fed meeting and. But I would say that, you know, in our markets. Bitcoin rose from the 56k area all the way back into the sixties. And, you know, now we're at 62 something or other, like. But that felt good being back above 60. What was your take on that? Was that was it just sort of like, oversold and then, like, I don't know, people overreacting one way or another? Yeah.
00:09:15.962 - 00:10:07.418, Speaker E: No, I think you had a positive catalyst in broader risk markets with the dovish Fed. In addition, you had an oversold market that was at support, 100 day moving averages, 60k support level, et cetera. And you started to see a little bit of optimism around ETF flows, et cetera. And then you had a bit of a short squeeze, a relief rally in bitcoin. And you had similar price action in all risk assets basically over that time period. And I think it's warranted because I do think the high and front end yields are in. And that's what Powell stated implicitly at the last FOMC meeting.
00:10:07.418 - 00:10:17.298, Speaker E: And that's generally good for risk. And the first order reaction is for people to buy risk assets and for volume to come down and for dollars to sell off. And that's kind of what you had happen.
00:10:17.426 - 00:10:54.088, Speaker C: Yeah. And then what else? I wanted to ask you a little bit about sort of a more macro thesis, especially since we don't have a lot of data to come through today. Where do we see, let's say, if Trump is elected, do we get any hints? Because I remember when he was president, the first time, he was tweeting at Jay Powell, saying, like, you got to lower rates and stuff, meddling a little bit there. I mean, where do you see were Trump to be reelected? A Trump administration going on? Biden's always talking about the White House, always talking about bidenomics. What would trumponomics look like in your mind?
00:10:54.256 - 00:11:38.436, Speaker E: Right. So I will highlight two things to frame this conversation. Right. So I believe it was in 2018 ish, when front end interest rates were at 2.5% and Trump was starting a trade war with China, and risk markets started to get a little wobbly. Right? And Powell, at that time, because of those concerns, partially because of those concerns, and most likely because of pressure from the White House as well, decided to cut interest rates when there was no need to. Unemployment was almost at structural lows at that time, and Powell still decided to cut interest rates in 2018.
00:11:38.436 - 00:12:11.828, Speaker E: And this was a time when inflation wasn't as much of a concern. Right. And people hadn't really thought that the US could be in a six, seven, 8% inflationary environment ever. So I'll caveat it with that. But I think the key takeaway is that absolutely, the White House can have an influence on central bankers. And I point to that as kind of the main example, because if you look at the set of facts, which was unemployment around, like, 4.2%. Right.
00:12:11.828 - 00:12:44.340, Speaker E: And having achieved solid normalization, the Fed was at that time methodically raising rates, and they were getting back to a place that felt more sustainable. And yet he decided to do an insurance cut at that time. And so that's one. And then the second one is how a second term president behaves. And I'll give you Barack Obama's first sort of address. You know that event where they do comedic speeches.
00:12:44.412 - 00:12:44.780, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:12:44.852 - 00:12:46.428, Speaker E: It's the commencement.
00:12:46.476 - 00:12:50.788, Speaker C: What's it called? No, no, it's the friars dinner or whatever. Yeah, sure.
00:12:50.836 - 00:12:52.044, Speaker E: Where he addresses the media.
00:12:52.124 - 00:12:56.828, Speaker C: Yeah. It's all like, well, there's the White House correspondence dinner. Is that the one you're talking about? Exactly.
00:12:56.956 - 00:13:16.016, Speaker E: And that was one of my favorite correspondence dinner speeches because essentially Obama was like, yeah, I want to fix immigration policy. You know what, bucket? I'm just going to do executive action, right? Oh, you know, we have to address this issue. Bucket. Executive action.
00:13:16.120 - 00:13:16.384, Speaker C: Right.
00:13:16.424 - 00:13:17.880, Speaker E: Student loans or whatever it was.
00:13:17.912 - 00:13:20.512, Speaker C: That thing. Bucket. Yes, literally.
00:13:20.568 - 00:13:23.144, Speaker E: Bucket. Right. And we can say it here, but.
00:13:23.224 - 00:13:24.800, Speaker C: Right, right. We know what he's referring to.
00:13:24.832 - 00:13:25.600, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:13:25.752 - 00:13:59.876, Speaker E: And that's the kind of mentality that a second term president, he really comes into, because there is nothing on the other side. Right. And now take the example with Trump, and you throw in a guy that is probably less fearful of the court system than he's ever been in his entire life, which is, I mean, assuming he gets elected. Correct. Assuming he gets elected. This is all under the assumption. And factually speaking, like, real clear politics has it neck and neck leaning a little towards Trump on the betting odds, but it's an even race.
00:13:59.876 - 00:14:30.372, Speaker E: But we're just kind of looking at the hypothetical. And so you've got this guy who's not afraid of impeachment. Cause he's been impeached a couple times, he's not afraid of the court system anymore, and he's on his second term and nothing to really lose. Right. And so that's the recipe you have if you. He enters office. Now, what can we assess about his economic policies that he wants to pursue? Well, tariffs, right.
00:14:30.372 - 00:14:36.692, Speaker E: Tariffs against China, tariff against auto imports, basically USA first.
00:14:36.788 - 00:14:37.732, Speaker C: He's a protectionist.
00:14:37.788 - 00:15:13.672, Speaker E: Protectionist. And we know what that looks like in the commodity sector. That is commodity prices higher? That will ultimately translate to cost of goods increasing and those costs being transferred to consumers via retail prices. So the commodity complex not looking great under a high tariff regime. Another sort of lever that a president can pull is with his treasury policy. Right. If you issue a ton more front end paper versus back end paper, et cetera, and treasury buybacks.
00:15:13.672 - 00:16:03.844, Speaker E: And so the treasury is actually a pretty strong agent in terms of impacting economic policy. And you can appoint folks that will sort of implement more dovish kind of policies, ones that will kind of reduce friction in the economy and synthetically give you lower rates. Right. And in addition to that, you can appoint Fed members that are also more dovish. Right. Including the same ambiguity whether or not the Fed chairman can get fired or not. But I will tell you, in the construct of an empowered president that doesn't care about winning another election or the court system, I would guess that he's going to take, he's going to do whatever he wants.
00:16:03.844 - 00:17:09.182, Speaker E: And so if you combine high tariff policy with a loose treasury and more dovish kind of fed members, it's going to be inflationary. I don't see how Trumponomics isn't materially inflationary. And so in this election, you're deciding between inflationary policies that are pretty blatant and in your face, and then you've got the other side, which is like, you know, they still want excessive spending and stuff. They want to do student loan forgiveness. They want to potentially make it easier to get second mortgages on your homes via the Fannie and Freddie being able to potentially make loans, et cetera. And so really, there's no outcome where I don't see a second term for Biden or a second term for Trump as being inflationary.
00:17:09.358 - 00:17:17.742, Speaker C: Yeah. Is that like the 1970s, eighties, like the second wave? Is that absolutely. How worried are you in general about a second wave?
00:17:17.838 - 00:17:39.412, Speaker E: Very, very concerned. And so right now, you are seeing the signs that the us consumer is slowing. Right. There was actually a very interesting piece today that how Wall street is kind of mismeasuring the debt burden that's on us consumers right now because of these buy now, pay later programs that don't even actually get captured.
00:17:39.508 - 00:17:41.852, Speaker C: That doesn't show up in the credit card data.
00:17:41.948 - 00:18:10.874, Speaker E: Correct. And the credit card data is starting to look worse. The auto loan data is starting to look worse, et cetera. And so while there are signs that the economy is slowing and while that's deflationary, I worry that the response of the fed in terms of cutting rates, the response of Congress in terms of more stimulative efforts, especially going into an election, will ultimately kind of outweigh the drag that you get from a slowing.
00:18:11.254 - 00:18:40.622, Speaker C: You and I have talked about this a little bit, too, but some of the infrastructure bill money and the Inflation Reduction act money hasn't been spent. Hasn't been spent. The feds, federal government rightly pushed a lot of that down to the states to figure out how to do it because they can't literally micromanage. I'm happy they actually acknowledged this. They can't literally micromanage the spending on projects all over the entire country from Washington. But the states haven't spent it all, so they're still spending, which is like. And some of it's not even spent at all yet.
00:18:40.622 - 00:18:45.758, Speaker C: Right. So that's also lingering inflationary pressure as well.
00:18:45.846 - 00:19:31.894, Speaker E: Yeah. No, and when you're consistently running two plus trillion dollar deficits, right, that's inflationary. That's a lot of spending, a lot of money. And so I think the reinflation risk is super real, and there are ways to play it in the market. But right here, right now, I wouldn't own long end fixed income, especially us fixed income, because of the fiscal path and how unsustainable it is. But it also just, you don't get paid enough for that risk. The risk that inflation is well above and beyond the returns that you're going to generate, the risk that there's default risk with Congress perpetually having re passing debt ceilings, et cetera.
00:19:31.894 - 00:20:19.414, Speaker E: And so I think bonds are just still very mispriced in the US. And then that creates such weird dynamics with the dollar. Is high inflation in the US and higher interest rate policy ultimately, is that dollar positive, negative? There's so many variables up in the air that it's really hard to trade. But ultimately, I do think that crypto will find some footing in that environment, because one thing I know for sure is that that monetary policy is defined and it allows me to plan accordingly. And so it's really hard right now.
00:20:20.714 - 00:20:40.048, Speaker C: I was gonna mention, too, before you said when Trump had been pressuring though, the Fed to act a certain way, Biden has tacitly been doing, not as openly as Trump tweeting, like, lower rates now or whatever he tweeted back then, but Biden has been predicting that rates would get lowered by the fall and stuff like that, like saying it publicly, that is pressure.
00:20:40.176 - 00:20:45.472, Speaker E: But I mean, did you even see the guy on his economic council try to talk about debt?
00:20:45.568 - 00:20:53.084, Speaker C: Yeah, that was in the Stephanie Kelton movie. The finding the money. I actually haven't seen that movie yet. I heard it's good. But I did see he could not explain how money is created.
00:20:53.394 - 00:21:03.874, Speaker E: Could not. And I would tell you that, you know, what's the sad part is that if you ask any one of our congressmen, wow, there's like 460 of them.
00:21:03.914 - 00:21:06.374, Speaker C: 435 members of the Congress, 430 of them.
00:21:06.994 - 00:21:18.098, Speaker E: I would bet that maybe less than 10% could answer those questions in a reasonable way. And for the Senate, you'd hope it's better. Right?
00:21:18.186 - 00:21:28.660, Speaker C: That's what I liked about Neel Kashkari. One time, and it's the first vocal clip on our intro. He was like, yeah, yeah. We just have infinite cash. We just push a button and print it. Like, that's the simplest answer.
00:21:28.732 - 00:21:32.624, Speaker E: And Powell's given that on 60 minutes before, et cetera.
00:21:32.924 - 00:21:34.692, Speaker C: That doesn't inspire confidence, though.
00:21:34.748 - 00:21:55.784, Speaker E: It doesn't. Because there's nobody that's like, oh, okay, let me look at these CBO projections, and what do they actually mean? And, like, you know, ten years forward from now, like, what are people gonna be upset about? And, like, how can we try to address it now? But there's no possible way of, like, addressing it in our current political economic construct.
00:21:55.824 - 00:21:58.976, Speaker C: Right. Because there's no. The two year term cycles.
00:21:59.040 - 00:22:00.096, Speaker E: Two year term cycles.
00:22:00.160 - 00:22:07.216, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. You have no incentive to do well by your grandchildren as a politician. Right. You've got to do well by the grandparents who are voting for you now.
00:22:07.400 - 00:22:10.432, Speaker E: Absolutely. And the grandparents that are donating to your campaign now.
00:22:10.488 - 00:22:11.884, Speaker C: And they do vote and donate.
00:22:12.184 - 00:22:35.224, Speaker E: Absolutely. And so it's just like, it's all coming to a head right now. And the policies we make now have such severe ramifications on what we do going forward. And it's to the point where even, like, you know, the fed, like, cutting now, like, the impact of reducing interest expenses is so huge when you compound it over time.
00:22:35.304 - 00:22:40.804, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. One little cut could save us trillions of dollars in 20 years. Right. It's like crazy.
00:22:41.224 - 00:22:49.994, Speaker E: And so that's like, that's why it's hard for anybody to really be in that pal seat and not want to cut interest rates. It is.
00:22:50.374 - 00:22:55.982, Speaker C: Well, the country needs it, really. I mean, the country's balance sheet needs it badly.
00:22:56.118 - 00:22:58.390, Speaker E: But we can have this debate another time.
00:22:58.422 - 00:23:02.918, Speaker C: But if we have 20% inflation like we did in the seventies, the country doesn't do well.
00:23:03.006 - 00:23:03.494, Speaker E: Does not.
00:23:03.534 - 00:23:08.966, Speaker C: It's a very tricky situation. Next time, I want to ask you about the japanese yen.
00:23:09.110 - 00:23:09.638, Speaker E: Absolutely.
00:23:09.686 - 00:23:11.790, Speaker C: What, that thing?
00:23:11.862 - 00:23:13.614, Speaker E: Well, their intervention is not working.
00:23:13.694 - 00:23:15.478, Speaker C: No, I see it's back up.
00:23:15.606 - 00:23:18.382, Speaker A: Let's do it. It seems like they need inflation, though, to get off.
00:23:18.478 - 00:23:27.406, Speaker C: Incredible amount of debt, too. Eventually they got away probably, but they don't want it to be like crazy rapid. Yeah, that's also cause they stepped in twice last week.
00:23:27.470 - 00:23:28.110, Speaker E: Yes.
00:23:28.262 - 00:23:29.622, Speaker C: And, you know, didn't really.
00:23:29.758 - 00:23:38.830, Speaker E: They took dollar, brought down 160 to a low of like 152, 100, 5184. And we're now trading closer to 156.
00:23:38.902 - 00:23:46.838, Speaker C: Yeah, it's like coming. Yeah, the trend is intact that. Yeah. All right, we'll talk about that another time. My friend. Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. Thank you so much.
00:23:46.926 - 00:23:48.034, Speaker E: Thanks for having me.
00:23:49.954 - 00:23:55.602, Speaker C: Let's go now to our guest, Austin Campbell, professor at Columbia Business School. Austin, welcome back to Galaxy Brains.
00:23:55.698 - 00:23:57.162, Speaker B: Thank you very much. Happy to be here.
00:23:57.218 - 00:24:28.554, Speaker C: One of very few repeat guests, I think. I was saying this to you, Mike Novogratz, Nick Carter, Tyler Williams, but maybe one, I think Trey Aslanian from Galaxy trading also, but not many others. Really happy to have you back. I thought the time was very apropos for a number of reasons, but if you recall, if you go back and listen, I think you were on maybe like February of last year, 2023. So it's been just a little bit more than a year. And we talked a lot about stablecoins. You used to be the portfolio manager for USDP at Paxos.
00:24:28.554 - 00:24:38.462, Speaker C: A lot of stablecoin news happening. Does it feel like the stablecoin Super bowl? It's starting to get interesting. I mean, it has been, but, you know.
00:24:38.598 - 00:25:01.116, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's the classic stablecoins are relevant about once a year type cycle. And what I would say is it's just become this thing that as they continue to stick around and grow and increase in usage, everybody is realizing they have to grapple with them. Right. These are not going away. And the longer you wait, in some ways, the harder it gets. So every year, the momentum to do something essentially increases.
00:25:01.180 - 00:25:21.524, Speaker C: Yeah. It's like a coiling spring. And so one of the big advancements in the discussion has been the introduction of the bill in the Senate Banking committee by Senator Lummis and Gillibrand, Republican and Democrat. What is that just at a high level? What was in that bill? Or is in that bill, that proposal?
00:25:21.864 - 00:26:04.458, Speaker B: Yeah. So I'll sort of summarize that bill as this is Lovis and Gillibrand's attempt at a stablecoin framework in the United States. And the high level points are as follows. One, stablecoins have to be bank like entities I say that because they don't literally have to be banks so that they engage in consumer lending, but they have bank supervision. And with the way the bill is written now, I think there are some technical issues with it, but the goal is to create a form of like isolated entity to hold the stable coins with prudential regulation, fine. It specifies things like reserves, how you manage operations, capital levels, those sorts of things. Two, it has all of those requirements attaching and essentially forcing people into a framework.
00:26:04.458 - 00:26:39.572, Speaker B: No more unregistered, just money services, businesses type things. And if you want to be a stable coin in the US, you've got to come here and register. And then the last part is what I would describe as a ban on algorithmic, synthetic, crypto backed stablecoins, which to me I find a little bit confusing and misguiding, because it's one thing to talk about how you represent or how you market things, and another thing to say, literally, you can't do it. Because I think there are some weird implications to that bill. If you were to start, oh, I don't know, tokenizing some forms of traditional assets, that could get strange quickly.
00:26:39.648 - 00:27:20.634, Speaker C: Yeah. So let's talk. Before we get in, I want to get into some of the specifics of the bill and some of its implications, but also, is this. There had been a big push, I think. Was it 2022, actually, in the House Financial Services committee before Representative Patrick McHenry took over as chairman, when Maxine Waters was chairperson of the committee and McHenry was the ranking member to do something like this. Are these bills similar? Are they, are they related? Do you need both? I mean, I know Representative McHenry has been saying, and he told the Bitcoin Policy Institute a couple weeks ago in Washington, that he really wants to get something done on stables this year. How do these relate?
00:27:21.054 - 00:27:45.534, Speaker B: Yeah, so both of them are attempts at the same thing that sort of bake the cake somewhat differently. They are both cakes, but they are different kinds of cakes, let's put it that way. I would say McHenry Waters has been in progress for a long time. There's been contributions from the democratic side. There's been contributions from the republican, republican side. I still think there are some technical issues to be ironed out with that bill. It has some of the same reserve problems, for instance, as Lumas Gillibrand.
00:27:45.534 - 00:28:27.554, Speaker B: But a lot of that framework works better in terms of fitting them into the us financial system. And the biggest question that I think McHenry has grappled with a little more than Lummis Gillibrand is state versus federal supervision of stablecoins, which I think is actually a very important point to get right in both directions. I would tell you, thinking about the political dynamics of how you get things done, neither Lummis nor Gillibrand really have a say in Senate banking, whereas McHenry, as you just said, is the chair of the House Financial services Committee. I would imagine if a bill moves, it is significantly more likely to be McHenry just because of the political haft and ability to make deals with the senior Democrats in the Senate than the other way around.
00:28:27.634 - 00:28:51.470, Speaker C: Interesting. So let's talk about the reserve requirements. Collateral stuff. I saw you had posted about this on Twitter. Formerly or ex? Formerly. Twitter. What are the issues with it? Because my understanding was effectively, both the House Financial services bill or proposals and Lumas Gillibrand on this topic require a variety of mostly just short term treasuries or cash as the collateral.
00:28:51.470 - 00:28:55.394, Speaker C: What's wrong with that? Or is there something more that's needed?
00:28:55.774 - 00:29:26.310, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the last time I was on here, you later made fun of me for calling myself a grouchy fixed income person. This is where you find that was truth in advertising. Because the problem that we're having in this bill is, it is like the view of an outsider looking at, sort of call it cash stability things without truly understanding the dynamics and trying to reinvent them. So I've said to crypto folks, you guys keep trying to reinvent stuff that are solved. Problems in finance. Stop. It's a little like I've never seen a real wheel.
00:29:26.310 - 00:30:13.372, Speaker B: So I make a hexagon instead of a circle, and it's like, could you just use a circle? And so here the problem is, modern money market funds, especially government money market funds, which is what these are supposed to look like post crisis, try not to be vehicles that essentially just suck in t bills and trap them forever. Because when you do that, the Federal Reserve has a very legitimate and correct point that these are systemically disruptive in times of crisis. Because what will happen is banks are going down, there's stress in the financial system, so people need more collateral to post. And by the way, all of that collateral is now being eaten by stablecoins that can't let it back out. And so that causes a shortage. This is no bueno. And so what you would want to do to deal with that is something called reverse repo.
00:30:13.372 - 00:30:46.490, Speaker B: And the way that structure works is I have cash, I lend that cash out. And the collateral I typically take for that is longer dated. Treasuries which at a time of uncertainty is good because I have long duration while interest rates are going down because things are bad, which means my collateral goes up in value. You have right way credit risk, but you're also not sucking up all the liquidity. In fact, you're providing liquidity to the system. So if you look right now at what Blackrock does, to take somebody sophisticated for circles reserve fund, it's 100% reverse repo. That is not a coincidence.
00:30:46.490 - 00:30:54.498, Speaker B: And I think without that, I would oppose this bill, and I think the Federal Reserve would oppose this bill and for quite frankly, probably correct reasons.
00:30:54.546 - 00:31:15.626, Speaker C: Yeah. And it's process, it's literal, it's pure financial, like, engineering reasons that it's not an ideological position, that that needs to be different. You're saying it's stability. Correct. And they can't just sell. Why can't they just sell the short dated treasuries? Is it because unless people come in to redeem the stables, they have to hold it as collateral. Right.
00:31:15.626 - 00:31:16.882, Speaker C: So they can't actually.
00:31:17.058 - 00:31:41.344, Speaker B: Right. If you look at what else they can hold, it's like bank deposits. And just so people know, in the United States, you get two hundred fifty k of FDIc insurance. And while there are sweep vehicles and whatnot, if you're running $100 billion stablecoin, there's literally not enough banks. Right. So are you telling people, sell your t bills and buy stuff that's credit risky in a time of crisis? No, that's bad. Now the stable coin will collapse or trap all the t bill.
00:31:41.344 - 00:31:44.696, Speaker B: Again, it's just the wrong instrument set. They misunderstood the problem.
00:31:44.760 - 00:31:45.656, Speaker A: Why do we think that they.
00:31:45.680 - 00:31:59.444, Speaker C: Cause the House bill had basically similar, I think was effectively t bills 90 days or less. I don't recall if it had reverse repo. I don't think it did. So, like, why is this they just thinking in their heads that, like, those are the least risky, most liquid instruments?
00:31:59.854 - 00:32:10.062, Speaker B: I think the problem they have run into, if I'm being honest, without naming names, is that they talk to some people in the crypto industry who have run stable coins and maybe haven't done a great job of it and just adopted what they said.
00:32:10.198 - 00:32:27.378, Speaker C: So, I don't know, do you have a sense of the likelihood of anything from either side of the Congress or either chamber, I should say, passing on this? Or does it feel like the temperature that coiled spring we talked about, is it coiled enough yet for something to really get done?
00:32:27.506 - 00:33:10.872, Speaker B: So the counterbalance here is, it's an election year, and you should always bet against progress in an election year. However, when you want to get things done in Washington, when you have a split situation in the House and the Senate, you get it done by having something each side can trade. And here the deal that would be in play is probably cannabis banking, which is something the Democrats want and Schumer apparently feels strongly in favor of. And by the way, I, as a New York Democrat, support. And on the other hand, you've got the Republicans wanting stable coins. And to me, that is, the trade that could potentially be on the table is if you trade the McHenry stablecoin bill in some form for cannabis banking, that's probably strictly better for the country overall and something that could get done because both people get a win. If you want it to get through this year, both sides have to get a win.
00:33:10.928 - 00:33:35.814, Speaker C: Yeah. What about like, so you mentioned the algorithmic and synthetic and whatever, I think they mostly call it algorithmic stablecoin are prohibited. Well, what's the problem with that? You mentioned a core, a relationship or an analogy to instruments we have in the traditional financial system. What is that? And also we'll talk about some of the other crypto stable coins that might be affected.
00:33:36.314 - 00:34:08.984, Speaker B: Right. I would say again, as somebody who's worked a lot in cash stability products, as you work your way out on the risk spectrum, there are a lot of things that I'm going to say, attempt to be stable with varying degrees of success, risk and return attached to them. And what matters to me is just representing things correctly. So if I'm thinking of a stable coin that I would feel comfortable with my mother using for payments, it's something that looks like what's in the McHenry bill. Right? Like, again, with some small tweaks, but basically it's dollars ish locked in a box, and that's how the thing operates. Good. That's a government money market fund.
00:34:08.984 - 00:34:44.757, Speaker B: It's fine, they work. But that's not an argument against the very existence of things like prime funds or maybe structured notes, or maybe like paired basis trades. Right, as you look in the financial space, or even like AAA securitizations. But what it is, is an argument against over representing the safety of those things. So I think the mistake in this bill is if you have banned things that hold a peg to the US dollar that don't follow this format. Well, if I tokenize a structured note at a bank, is it now illegal sound, maybe? Yeah, but that's like a weird outcome.
00:34:44.805 - 00:34:49.261, Speaker C: Because they're not saying come in and register to do it. They're saying, actually, that's just straight up banned.
00:34:49.317 - 00:35:21.414, Speaker B: Right? So now I have a weird situation where if I do a thing on a traditional ledger, it's legal, but if I put it on a blockchain, it's not. That's bizarre. Right? Like, it shouldn't be the case that I could have a financial product and by moving from an excel spreadsheet to an access database, like, I changed the legality. So I would say to me, the better strategy here is to say if things want to be stablecoins used for payments are represented as such with promises of safety. They should have to fit into the framework of the bill. And if you don't, you can't market it or call it that. And you have to be honest about the risks.
00:35:21.454 - 00:35:25.446, Speaker C: And it's like calling yourself a bank when you don't have a bank license. We come after you for that, basically.
00:35:25.550 - 00:35:45.566, Speaker B: Correct. And, like, that's actually a great example because there's a very narrow set of exemptions to that. But you will notice, like, even bankless had to become bonkless in California because you can't use bank. Right? Like, the only things that can actually use bank are going to be things like, literally a blood bank. Right. If you're not a financial services business. And I, by the way, I think that's fair.
00:35:45.566 - 00:35:52.390, Speaker B: I shouldn't be able to just take three dudes, rent a tiny office and call myself a bank. Like, there are a lot of strings attached to that.
00:35:52.502 - 00:35:53.614, Speaker C: Deceptive. It could be.
00:35:53.694 - 00:36:16.946, Speaker B: Exactly. And that's my point here, is get rid of the deceptive marketing, get rid of the false promises of safety. Don't have do Kwan going around calling anchor a savings account. Yeah, that stuff is bad. But on the other hand, you mentioned Athena earlier. I don't think Athena should be illegal. Like, I've actually talked with them about this myself, where I told them, I don't think it's right for you to call yourself a stablecoin, but that doesn't mean I don't think you should be able to do it.
00:36:16.946 - 00:36:19.850, Speaker B: I think it's a cool project. Just represent it correctly.
00:36:19.922 - 00:36:35.934, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think of it in some ways as, like, well, they're doing the basis trade, basically. So it's kind of like a market neutral hedge fund product they've tokenized. Right. Which is. And those trades are done across finance of a whole range of times. So it's not a crazy idea.
00:36:36.094 - 00:37:12.036, Speaker B: No. And more so, I would say I think it is a societal good to democratize access to uncorrelated high return strategies. Like, it should not be the case that we live in a financial system where only extremely rich people have good investment opportunities. To me, it is, again, back to the, you have to represent the risks cleanly, be clear about what you're doing, and be fair. Like, I'm a transparency maxi, in that way, call it. But I also don't believe that it should be the case that while they can't do it, we should hive this off and only Steve Cohen should be allowed to make money like that.
00:37:12.100 - 00:37:42.626, Speaker C: Yeah. What about tether in this situation? Because they are the largest stablecoin and the bill that requires you to come in, we didn't talk about the licensure portion of this. But you said they have to sort of be bank like. Right? You have to be a depository institution. I think, like you said, there is a state trust pathway and a federal pathway. There's some kind of threshold where if you become too big, then you have to go the full bank, Federal bank way, whatever. To be honest, that's sort of like horse trading, probably.
00:37:42.626 - 00:38:02.028, Speaker C: I know there was a lot of back and forth you mentioned about the state pathway in the McHenry waters proposal. Presumably, tether would have to. Whichever of these is adopted, they all require some form of registration as a trust or as a bank. Tether would have to. Right. Presumably.
00:38:02.156 - 00:38:40.006, Speaker B: So I think the way to think about this is this sort of flew under the radar with all the headlines flying around in crypto. But recently, I believe it was OKX. Don't quote me on that. That deplatformed tether in Europe because of Mika. And you're going to see a similar thing if a stable coin bill passes in the United States. Because what it means is you're going to need to come here and register, or you're going to need to be in some sort of regulatory regime that the US is going to be willing to say is roughly equivalent. Like, I think if the US passes a bill and Europe's got me, they're probably going to horse trade with each other to give equivalency rather than ban each other's products.
00:38:40.006 - 00:38:57.786, Speaker B: That's silly and not how regular finance works. There is equivalency treatment. But what it means is tether can't be this amorphous offshore. We're never going to show anybody our cards sort of thing and be inside the perimeter. They're going to have to make a decision one way or the other. And I think that's a feature, not a bug, for this bill. From the view of the writers.
00:38:57.850 - 00:39:28.664, Speaker C: Yeah. You think it's going to happen? Sort of. Anyway, if you. I didn't realize that this could be happening to them already in Europe, which has pretty like strict stablecoin rules now, actually. Well, do you think, is it already happening? Is tether the, in your mind? I mean, I don't know if, you know, I don't know. I have impressions, but that's just my impression. Are they the Wild west tether that they may have been in the past or with this stuff in Europe with the potential for it here? Is it different?
00:39:29.164 - 00:39:59.598, Speaker B: They've definitely been evolving. Right. I would say to me, tether is on a path that's somewhat similar to binance when binance started. If we're being honest with each other, as somebody who used to run busd and knows a little bit about that organization, and they definitely had some serious issues. You just saw CZ plead today, and so even the people running it admit that that happened. But also they have genuinely tried to improve them over time and gotten to a place where they've gone from. It was pretty bad at the start to actually, it's pretty good now.
00:39:59.598 - 00:40:31.448, Speaker B: And tether, I think is on that same journey. Like, they are not sort of a pirate ship as they are represented now. They're not perfect either. They still probably have some jankiness in there, but like, they've been cooperating with the DOJ and US law enforcement and law enforcement and foreign nations and trying to force out the worst actors. So, you know what? What I always tell people about tether is the real tether skeptics who are like, it's all a scam, they don't have the money, and it's all criminals are definitely wrong. But tether maxeys who are like, this is the best thing ever and it's perfect. How dare you criticize it.
00:40:31.448 - 00:40:33.840, Speaker B: Also wrong. The truth is somewhere in the middle.
00:40:33.912 - 00:41:35.398, Speaker C: Yeah. And then if we think about, I just want to throw this out here because I know another issue was stablecoins. Why couldn't Walmart issue a stable coin? It feels to me like, as I've been following some of the debates on these various bills, that this idea kind of got jettisoned relatively early, but was initially proposed. Why should it be only banks? Is there a reason why, really, it should be only banks? Is it not? Is there not some, maybe there's no way to just sort of rhetorically craft a threshold without something like banking rules, but like, why couldn't think about meta, right? Or Facebook at the time they wanted to do Libra, that wouldn't fly in this reg in either of these regimes from the House or Senate that we're sort of discussing. They'd have to become a bank or a bank like entity. In your mind, just maybe this is more personal opinion, but like, should it really be only banks, like, or is there some way to do prudential and regulatory oversight of a non bank? Or. I guess that doesn't really exist.
00:41:35.398 - 00:41:36.582, Speaker C: What are your thoughts on that part?
00:41:36.718 - 00:42:17.168, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I'll give something that's probably a hot take for all sides, which is I don't think banks should be stablecoin issuers either. And what I mean by that is that banks exist for the purpose of credit intermediation. And so the idea being I'm going to take deposits, I'm going to take those deposits and I'm going to go lend them for real economic activity. That's a valuable service. But that doesn't necessarily mean that somebody who wants to buy a cup of coffee should have to lend money to a real estate billionaire just to do that. That's kind of how the current system works when you also give banks a monopoly over the payment system. And there have been times in history where these systems have not been bundled with each other.
00:42:17.168 - 00:42:59.334, Speaker B: And in some ways, maybe we should consider going back there. I would say to your point in this bill, this is a nuance that I think there's still a lot of fighting about, which is, does an entity that has a stable coin issuer under it have to be a bank holding company? Because if the answer is yes, then what you said is true. And I think that breaks a lot of things, actually, because it's going to be hard to have some of the tech development things in there. On the other hand, if they don't actually, yeah, Walmart should totally launch a stable coin with, I will say one important caveat. So another trend, and Athena is something of an example of this, but maybe a better one, is Agora, which launched recently, is the old stablecoin issuers, made you the following deal. Give me a dollar. And.
00:42:59.334 - 00:43:34.026, Speaker B: Cool, thanks. I'm going to keep all the profits. That's a good deal if you otherwise didn't have access to dollars. So if you look at the holders of these things, it's largely non us persons, because that's where the economics make sense. That is a bad deal if you can just buy a money market fund. And so I also believe that in the future, stablecoins are going to have to share a lot more of their yield. And that starts reducing the value of everybody launching their own stablecoin, because just like, why at that point, if it's competed away and becomes essentially an asset management business, Walmart shouldn't and doesn't want to launch one.
00:43:34.130 - 00:43:42.934, Speaker C: Right. That's interesting. Yeah. And it is, by the way. I mean, like, in your fidelity account, you can hold a government money market fund. It operates exactly like cash. Like, you can literally do an eight.
00:43:42.934 - 00:44:04.318, Speaker C: You can have zero cash and $100 shares. $100 worth of shares of a money market fund to an Ach, and fidelity will just instantly send it like it was cash. That's basically what we're talking about with the yield bearing. Stable. Right. It's like if it's not in flight, it earns interest. When it's in flight, eventually it earns interest at somebody else's place or whatever.
00:44:04.446 - 00:44:04.790, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:44:04.822 - 00:44:05.646, Speaker C: Pretty straightforward.
00:44:05.790 - 00:44:31.862, Speaker B: And in many ways, that's why I've always been so interested in stable coins, is they are in large part a new form money. Right. For exactly the reason that you just described, which is in the past, we had, like, physical money. So, like a physical dollar bill. And it kind of suffers from Warren Buffett's critique of gold, which is like, it's just a thing that sits there. It's not doing anything. And then you also had productive investments, but even in the banking system, if you think about the mechanics.
00:44:31.862 - 00:45:19.408, Speaker B: So, like, if I have an account at JPMorgan and you've got an account at bank of America, and I have to pay you, like, one grand to settle up for a bill for some crazy outing that we had together, then what happens is, assuming banks are not holding a liquidity layer here. So let's say it's been exhausted. JPMorgan has to go sell $1,000 of stuff, get that $1,000 of cash, send it to bank of America, who gets the $1,000 and then goes and buys stuff to invest it. A stablecoin essentially allows you to eliminate that gap between the process of investment and the process of payment. It can be within the stablecoin vehicle. This is invested in overnight reverse repo, and when I send it to you, it just stays invested. So we have eliminated this friction that exists in the current system by essentially combining these functions technologically.
00:45:19.576 - 00:45:29.432, Speaker C: It's smart, too, because a government money market fund is not a security. Right. It's not like an equity vehicle. Right. So we can transfer it. Well, I guess it is currently.
00:45:29.488 - 00:46:04.602, Speaker B: So the answer is both yes and no. The answer really is, it depends what kind of wrapper you're talking about. But that is a very us centric concern, too. The US is one of the few places in the world that does not have proper regulation for just payments. So I would tell you the right way to think about this, is there should be payments companies where what they can do is just hold your cash, bankruptcy remote in custody for you. So it's not like PayPal's property, it's your property, where PayPal is the custodian. And then PayPal charges you a fee for that service and pays you the rest of the interest.
00:46:04.602 - 00:46:14.978, Speaker B: And if everybody can do that, then we have a system where people who want to use the system for payments are not essentially paying a giant invisible subsidy to those who are using the system for borrowing.
00:46:15.026 - 00:46:37.656, Speaker C: That's interesting. Yeah, I can see how splitting them out can make a lot of sense. And I guess so it's not the securities issue that I was thinking, but it's more like instead of when I do the ach out of that fidelity account with the money market fund only in it is liquidating, converting to cash, I think, and then sending cash, it just sends the shares in the mutual fund to the amount that I need. It just is money.
00:46:37.760 - 00:46:38.048, Speaker B: Correct.
00:46:38.096 - 00:47:08.180, Speaker C: And the yield follows it, rather than having to go in and out and then everybody. And that's the other thing, too. It is more equitable because the average person may not know that they should take their savings account where they're earning zero 1% interest, and actually put it in a brokerage account which has cash features, but put it in a money market, they'd earn 5% right now, or whatever it is, it would automatically happen. You wouldn't have to have this weird disparity where the average person, the working person, just gets none of that yield.
00:47:08.372 - 00:47:51.174, Speaker B: So I think that is an extremely good point, and is one of the two huge features this creates. The other one is, so when Silicon Valley bank was going down, there was this whole sort of theme that emerged of like, well, you should have due diligence to your bank if you were going to leave money there. And to me, that's crazy. And the reason I say that is I started my career at JP Morgan in distressed debt in 2009. And let me tell you, due diligencing banks, when things get creaky is a 100 hours a week job. So one, where are you doing your actual job? If my job is due diligence in my bank? And two, for many kinds of businesses, it's just not feasible. So, like, let's say I am a small to medium grocery store chain.
00:47:51.174 - 00:48:19.178, Speaker B: And I need to receive money from people because they're buying like tomatoes and bread. Am I supposed to have 50 different accounts and be like allocating them to stay under two hundred fifty k and then keeping track of like, net of my like, receivables versus payables versus pay. Like, there's no way for a medium scale business to stay under the FDIC limit. It's just not feasible. And so you're essentially saying to anybody who runs those kinds of businesses, oh, also you should be like a bank debt trader to understand if your money is safe.
00:48:19.226 - 00:48:38.408, Speaker C: Yeah, it's wild. It should be what the banks are paying into the FTP, FDIC and membership and what our taxes are paying for. That's the whole point. The FDIC has prudential authority over the banks. They could have gone in and said to SVP, whoa, whoa, whoa. Like your, your books look bad. You need to clean this up immediately or we may even take you over.
00:48:38.408 - 00:48:53.422, Speaker C: Instead. They waited till it was insolvent. That's literally their job. Right? That's what prudential oversight is, right? That means they can reach into the balance sheet and say, you have to hold this. You can't hold that. Presumably they're supposed to be doing that on our, I mean, you're right. It's not just one grocery store.
00:48:53.422 - 00:49:00.998, Speaker C: The entirety of the US economy cannot perform this diligence on banks. That's supposed to have been outsourced to the regulator. Otherwise, I don't know what they're doing.
00:49:01.086 - 00:49:11.270, Speaker B: Correct. You know, the other part I will say though, is like, you know, goes back to an old Yogi Berra quote, which is predictions are hard to make, especially about the future. Like bank regulators will never be perfect either.
00:49:11.342 - 00:49:11.798, Speaker C: Totally.
00:49:11.886 - 00:49:56.808, Speaker B: And so question, should there just be a simpler vehicle, maybe with lower returns that people could use if they don't want to deal with the headache? Or conversely, because here's a way you could actually potentially obsolete stable coins. So regulators, if you're listening and you hate stable coins, here's the actual path. You might want to look at some of the economies that ensure 100% of their bank deposits, just all of them. Because the way to get people not to worry about leaving their money in a bank is to tell them, no matter what, you're safe. And that requires a lot of structural change around how you think about banks. If you don't want people wanting the safety of government money market funds or stablecoins, the answer is you have to make the banks a lot safer. You can't just sort of magic the problem away by jawboning it.
00:49:56.856 - 00:50:23.246, Speaker C: Yeah, we could go on and on about stables. There's some other things I wanted to ask you about. There was some news last week about the founders of Samurai wallet being arrested. At least one of them was arrested. I saw he pled not guilty, actually, already, samurai wallet was an anonymity enhancing service. That actually might be one of the government legal definitions somewhere. Might be fat if I can't remember.
00:50:23.246 - 00:51:05.718, Speaker C: I'm not going to call it a mixer because it was not a centralized service provider. For our audience who may know it helped bitcoin transactors connect to perform coin joint transactions, which are ways for, say, Austin and I to collaboratively create a transaction using inputs from both of our bitcoin stacks in a way that makes it easier for us to obtain on chain privacy. We'll just say that they did collect a fee for this matching service, but they never held funds. It's not like a mixer where you just send your funds in and later take your funds out and somebody mixes them around. It's not even like tornado cash, which is a different type of way of doing this. It's also a little different. But anyway, they were arrested and they were charged with two things.
00:51:05.718 - 00:51:21.614, Speaker C: Effectively conspiracy to promote or do money laundering and running an unregistered money services business. What was your thoughts when you saw this? I know there were a lot of people concerned about this. I saw coin center has been writing about this and many others.
00:51:22.234 - 00:51:45.966, Speaker B: Yeah. So when you look at the underlying allegations, as you said, you can really divide it into two pillars. And I'm oversimplifying here. Right. But this is, you know, essentially trying to make it understandable to everybody without getting into many, many, like, layers of thought on the law. Part one is exactly, as you said, conspiracy to commit money laundering. And basically what that means is that you and I formed some sort of agreement to launder money.
00:51:45.966 - 00:52:10.216, Speaker B: And importantly there, you don't have to be any sort of licensed or registered entity to launder money. You just have to be laundering money. Right. So this is the classic. I'm disguising the source of funds and, like, hiding it for impermissible reasons through. Yeah, exactly. And, you know, it is commonly used by criminal enterprises to disguise the fact that they are criminal enterprises to get their money into the us banking system, or any banking system, really.
00:52:10.216 - 00:52:53.534, Speaker B: And that is illegal. And more importantly, that is generically illegal. Like, I would say, in many ways, the fact that crypto was involved here doesn't really matter. It would be just as illegal to conspire to commit money laundering with cash or with bank deposits or with, you know, even like, gold that we're gonna hold. Like, you just can't do it. And so in the case of samurai in particular, not legal advice, but you may not want to be talking openly about how your product is used by criminals to disguise the source of funds and maybe building features to facilitate that as alleged. Again, not confirming or denying, but if those facts are true, this seems to be a pretty obvious case down that parallel.
00:52:53.534 - 00:52:55.774, Speaker B: Like, just that. And that's not crypto specific.
00:52:55.814 - 00:53:00.118, Speaker C: And it requires. Don't do that. Intent. Yes, you have to knowingly commit to.
00:53:00.246 - 00:53:27.696, Speaker B: Or be, like, grossly negligent. Like, not mildly negligent, but like, there were very clear signs that this dude wearing the North Korean coming in to use your business. Right. Like guys, right. So, like, it really bad. And again, not really specific to crypto. The other leg of the thing, which to me is the one that was much more concerning, was the unregistered money transmission, money services business type leg.
00:53:27.696 - 00:54:57.314, Speaker B: And the reason that was concerning is that to summarize, what the DOJ said is, well, you may not have specifically been this thing, but you somehow combined features or offerings in a way that made you into the thing. And to me, the problem with that is sort of, you know, call it the malleability of that argument, which is, where do I put the bright line test to understand what is legal versus illegal? If you're just going to argue that combining features in an unexpected way produces this outcome? Well, like, what features? What's unexpected? Specifically? Like, put differently, why are these guys a money transmitter? And why isn't, like, for instance, my email provider, I will openly admit right here, and maybe I am now, apparently, in the view of the DOJ, saying I committed a federal crime. I've emailed with my family to settle up bills and used email to talk about settling in cash. So, like, there, I've now combined elements of service. Like what? And so the sort of extensibility of that thing to sort of create this definition of, like, anytime something, we put things together and a transaction happens, it's a money services business is just way too broad. Way too broad. And I think this is an area where you have to really zoom out from crypto and ask, how does this work? Cause, like, that sort of standard just produces a situation where, I don't know, like, especially, and we'll get to this.
00:54:57.314 - 00:55:03.474, Speaker B: I would imagine, like, with what they said about Fincen guidance and whatnot like, how do I legally do business in the US and e commerce?
00:55:03.554 - 00:55:34.404, Speaker C: Yeah, it doesn't make any sense to me. And before we get to FinCEN in particular, I want to highlight a couple things that they used as examples in this case. First of all, they said that you don't have to control that. Most people think, and I think the FinceN guidance says that to be a money service business, a money transmitter, in another parlance, you have to exert control over these people's funds. And my understanding was, take Western Union, the iconic money transmitter, or I don't.
00:55:34.404 - 00:55:35.540, Speaker B: Know how old it is, moneygram.
00:55:35.652 - 00:56:10.344, Speaker C: We've been around for like hundreds of years or something. You literally walk into a storefront in Boston and you say, I need to send money to my relative in Colorado, but should I put it in the mail and use the postal service? They're like, no, no, no, you just give it to us. We'll transmit a message to our office in Colorado that says, give them that money. It's even how the hawala network kind of works, to be honest. Right? Like it goes in one side, it's in flight, but while it's in flight, it's in their control. And so they could abscond with it, right. The money transmitter could just not pay it out in Colorado, but take it in Boston.
00:56:10.344 - 00:56:32.920, Speaker C: And so there's rules around this, right, to protect the consumer and the user. So control is always thought of, I thought, as an iconic and integral part of classifying you as a money service business. In the case of samurai wallet, there was no control in that sense. Right. Because while they. It's like a matching. So it's almost like a matching engine on an exchange.
00:56:32.920 - 00:57:01.450, Speaker C: It's a little different, I guess, but it's similar in that it connects a buyer and a seller. In our case, it connects to people that want to enhance their privacy. But samurai never holds the keys to those funds. They can't abscond with the funds and they may not even know who used them. The suit alleges that control is actually not required to be a money service business. And they use examples of a frying pan. When you cook food, is it in control of the.
00:57:01.450 - 00:57:47.674, Speaker C: It need not be in sole control of the egg you're frying for it to obviously have facilitated its cooking, or a USB cable could transmit information. Is that. Not that it doesn't control it necessarily, but it would still be seen as transmitting the information. It seems like a truly wild argument to me, in conflict with really what fincen, which, by the way, is the regulator for federal money service businesses. What they've said for, frankly, years on this topic. What do you make of that discrepancy between the DOJ's criminal suit against this founder and the FinCEN guidance, which is part of treasury? I mean, a different branch of the government or different agency within the executive branch of the government?
00:57:47.834 - 00:58:43.666, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, is the DOJ seriously trying to argue that swap meets need to register as money transmitters? Like, this is a little bit like, out of the blue, I would say. So the analogy I used when I was talking with one of my students about this was the situation is a little bit like you've got an octopus, it's got like eight arms. And all eight of the arms are now doing something totally different with a different interpretation of the law. In some cases, unwritten and helpfully, they don't agree with each other. So now you've got to ask, like, how am I supposed to do business legally if FinCEn is not in charge of, oh, I don't know, money transmission? And the DOJ has their own rules and they haven't really told us what they are. Other than after they prosecute you, how are you supposed to know what's legal? That's my point about e commerce. Like, if you were a lawyer advising a client and the DOJ is serious about what they said, I have no idea how you tell that client anything other than get the hell out of the United States as quickly as possible.
00:58:43.666 - 00:59:13.032, Speaker B: If you ought to stay out of jail. Right? Because you cannot have a legal standard of, well, we'll tell you after the fact what it is in a criminal prosecution. And all of the guidance that all of our agencies have published their wrong. Because, like, you know, something that will maybe resonate with crypto people. This would be a little bit like the DOJ charging you with securities fraud after you had gone to the SEC, presented them something, and the SEC clearly and publicly told you, this is definitely not a security. Like, wait, what just happened?
00:59:13.088 - 00:59:40.056, Speaker C: Yeah, it doesn't make sense. It's like, I want to start, literally, a business that does money related something, and I either want to be an MSB or I don't want to be one. Why don't we go to the agency that determines that and they'll tell us what is and isn't. I say, okay, I decide I don't want to be one. They've told me specifically, if I do these things or don't do these things, I won't be one. And then I get charged criminally with being one.
00:59:40.200 - 00:59:40.456, Speaker B: Right.
00:59:40.480 - 00:59:46.712, Speaker C: And if not having, and not having registered, even though the register, the registering overseeing agency said I didn't have to register, yeah.
00:59:46.728 - 01:00:16.502, Speaker B: I would have rejected you. So if you read, like, so coin center, as you said, wrote a piece on this, and if you read their piece, interestingly, basically all but roughly one sentence in the thing is opposing this leg of the argument. Right. And saying, listen, this cannot be the standard. It has all sorts of very serious problems for the US economy and, like rule of law. And I largely think they're correct without getting into the exact particulars of their argument. And then they had one line in there that's like, we're not really talking about the conspiracy to commit money laundering part.
01:00:16.502 - 01:00:51.574, Speaker B: Right. And to me, this is the problem of if our legislators don't pass law and if our regulators don't take their duties seriously and you just sort of punt it to like, law enforcement and prosecutors, prosecutors are in the game of winning. They want to find people who are guilty of criminal acts and put them in jail. I would doubt that the DOJ prosecutors are sitting there being like, well, you know, we've got to think really deeply about the long term implications for, like, you know, us web two fintechs, they're like, no, these guys are crooks. Let's put them in jail. And this is sort of the breakdown of law when we haven't been able to clarify things.
01:00:51.654 - 01:01:09.382, Speaker C: Yeah, it seems like they're, to your point about trying to make this case that they're sort of saying, well, we think we could convince a jury that, you know, money went in and money came out. And if it weren't for samurai wallet in this instance, it wouldn't have. So doesn't that look like Western Union to you, jury?
01:01:09.438 - 01:01:09.654, Speaker B: Right.
01:01:09.694 - 01:01:30.296, Speaker C: Like, even though it's just technically and fundamentally not how it works, you could see how you might be able to convince someone that, yeah, you know, I don't know. They didn't, didn't they open up samurai wallet? Didn't they put money into Samurai Wallet? Didn't they then later send money out of samurai wallet? Isn't that samurai wallet that did that? Well, actually, no, not really. It was software that, you know, you got.
01:01:30.320 - 01:01:52.208, Speaker B: Well, also, here's the, here's the extensibility of that argument. So I send you money by going to Chase's website, logging in, sending you through like Zelle or something, $1,000. So obviously Microsoft edge is a money transmitter because it couldn't have happened without that. I went in and money went in and then came out that's again, like.
01:01:52.256 - 01:01:54.032, Speaker C: Type on a box and then money came out.
01:01:54.128 - 01:01:58.616, Speaker B: Right. Exactly. Where is the line is the question that I have for the DOJ on this one.
01:01:58.680 - 01:02:08.864, Speaker C: Yeah. And it seemed like it was relatively well defined by FinCen, but now just, it's just a tricky. It's a problematic situation. It doesn't make a lot of sense. By the way, you still do owe me that thousand dollars.
01:02:10.684 - 01:02:12.156, Speaker A: Yeah, I hope we can solve some.
01:02:12.180 - 01:02:44.906, Speaker C: Of these, something like that with DOJ. I mean, maybe with a different administration that can send, I don't know what they're called, but a directive down to the us attorneys saying this is the way we're gonna interpret law in this area going forward. That could change it, but that doesn't have lasting effect. Seems like legislation is the real way because we're talking about a legal argument. We're not talking about a regulatory oversight. As far as we know, the regulation guide, the regulatory guidance from FinCEN remains intact. It's more about constraining what the law enforcement and prosecutorial authorities can do with the law.
01:02:45.090 - 01:03:32.018, Speaker B: Yeah, and I, you know, that kind of brings us full circle to the first discussion of this has been a really hard space for people to make laws. And, like, I want to be clear, I'm sympathetic to that. So if you put your shoes self in the shoes of congressional staff, they're doing like, 500 things. Right? Like, they're underpaid, overworked, and they are never experts in the stuff they're working on to the degree of all the people squawking in their ears. And that's hard in a normal situation. And then you get to crypto, where the span of people squawking are everywhere, from people basically saying state sponsored money should be illegal and shouldn't exist, all the way to people saying China doesn't surveil nearly enough, and they're hearing all of that, and it's hard for them to differentiate. And by the way, in their bosses layers of concerns, this is like, maybe 57 out of 100 if.
01:03:32.018 - 01:04:02.196, Speaker B: Right. Cause, like, number one and number two are things like inflation and immigration, and like Israel and the Ukraine, like, crypto is not a top thing for the overwhelming majority of people. And so this job is, like, impossible in their shoes. But the only way out in the long run is gonna be with good legislation and to some extent, also good rule of law by judges. Cause your ideal situation in samurai is a judge slaps that second leg right out of the courtroom and just looks at this and is like, this is not what it says. Goodbye.
01:04:02.260 - 01:04:35.454, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Okay, before we wrap, though, Austin, you are a professor at Columbia Business School. I know some folks there. Our friend Omid Malaykhan, who's also been on the show, is also a professor there in the blockchain space. I'm always interested to know what. I'm not going to call them kids because business school students may be older than they're not freshmen in undergrad, but what are you guys talking about? What are you covering? Maybe start here. What are you covering in your course or courses this year as it relates to the crypto and blockchain industry?
01:04:35.834 - 01:05:09.914, Speaker B: Yeah. So part of what we've been trying to build as curriculum is sort of a way to give people a comprehensive understanding of the space without hot takes and in a way that they can use to actually go get jobs. And so I would say at Columbia right now, Omid teaches the fundamentals of blockchain course. If you want to know what a blockchain is, how it works, how consensus, like, is formed and these sorts of things, you should definitely take as class. And it's very good. And then I teach after that what I would describe as essentially the blockchain equivalent of the financial market survey class, which is cool. We built these things.
01:05:09.914 - 01:05:53.648, Speaker B: Now what are people doing with them? So now we're covering all of the primitives in the space. Like, what's an amm, what's a borrow lend protocol? What's an oracle, what's a bridge, what's a stable coin? Like, how do wallets actually work in practice with the idea of, if you think of business school students, they're going to become business development people, product managers, maybe they're going into policy. You're not really having core devs coming out of there. They need about a half mile deep understanding, not a multi mile deep understanding, but of many, many things. They need to be at least semi generalists. And so that's the course I teach as background. What are they most interested in? I would tell you stablecoins and payments are a big topic of interest for them.
01:05:53.648 - 01:06:36.560, Speaker B: And then all of the things that facilitate transacting on chain in meaningful ways. Because I would say if you are somebody who is over the age of 50, something you need to understand is that people who like, were growing up and experienced the financial crisis in their formative years. So call it teenagers or younger, maybe even early twenties, and college students are really, really skeptical of the traditional financial system. They don't trust it. They saw it break. They don't think it's good. And the idea that things 30 years forward will look like they do now with like a bank oligopoly that controls four things I just think is not borne out by reality because these people just don't want to do business with those entities.
01:06:36.560 - 01:06:46.434, Speaker B: And so it is a lot of people looking at building systems of I want to take back control of my money, I want to take back control of payments. I want everything to be more transparent and fair.
01:06:47.254 - 01:06:55.630, Speaker C: Gosh, that sounds kind of inspiring. They see a brighter future. They think that public blockchains can help get us there.
01:06:55.822 - 01:07:32.864, Speaker B: I would say yes. And I want to emphasize the public part, because one thing that gets absolutely zero attention in my class is all of these private bank chains. They are, in many ways, I think, a bridge to nowhere, because all that is, is the exact same bank that we all already disliked but with a different backend. Right back to our discussion of just changing the ledger. Yeah, and so I would say it's public blockchains and an important point of that. And I think this is a point where regulators and policymakers have been behind the curve. That doesn't mean completely permissionless, bitcoin like implementations.
01:07:32.864 - 01:08:18.044, Speaker B: In many cases, people are fine with permissioning on public blockchains. Like, if I have a token that represents, say, my house, there should probably be some ability of somebody to, say, freeze or seize that token, because it shouldn't be the case that, like, if North Korea hacks a service, I can't live in my house anymore because they stole the NFT. Like, I get it. But on the other hand, that also doesn't mean that we need an impenetrably dense black box that nobody knows how it works that records ownership of my house either. There are many things that range from public and permissionless, to call it semi public and permissioned, that transform these into more communal goods than, like, private monopolies and oligopolies. And I think that is largely what many of my students care about.
01:08:18.464 - 01:08:33.252, Speaker C: Super interesting, and I love that quote. Private blockchains are a bridge to nowhere. It's like a double or triple entendre right there. Austin, my friend Austin Campbell from Columbia business school. Thank you so much for coming back to galaxy brains. Austin.
01:08:33.348 - 01:08:37.544, Speaker B: Yeah, it's great to see you. I'll be back in roughly one year when stablecoins become relevant again.
01:08:40.364 - 01:08:58.214, Speaker C: That's it for this week's episode of Galaxy brains. Thanks to our guest Austin Campbell from Columbia Business School and my friend Bimnadabibi from Galaxy trading. All right, here it is. It is my speech at the National Press Club from April 9 at the Bitcoin Policy Institute Institute summit in its entirety. Here it is, and we'll see you next week.
01:08:59.194 - 01:10:08.934, Speaker A: When our founding fathers threw off the yoke of foreign tyranny, they did so largely as a reaction to encroaching intermediation. Restrictions on transactions and oppressive taxation, even on the simple creation of official records, were such an affront to liberty that they resulted in the American Revolution. How could a faraway power charge the fixation of stamps to official documents preventing local parties from conducting simple transactions? Soon after the taxation and document restrictions came physical restrictions, checkpoints, barricades, and occupation. Indeed, the right to transact freely is coupled with the right to assemble, to incorporate, to prosper, and to speak. America is a nation built on the values of individual liberty and human rights, strong property rights, and openness. While we haven't always lived up to the best of our ideals, and we don't always, America's values are human values, and we achieve our greatest successes when we strive to live up to the best of our beliefs. We believe in the freedom to transact.
01:10:08.934 - 01:11:02.204, Speaker A: We believe that protecting the fruits of one's own labor and being able to execute transactions with with another willing party is core to capitalism, free trade, american values, and indeed, the human spirit. It is impossible to imagine a future where humanity is supremely successful, but in which two humans cannot transact directly with one another without an intermediary. This freedom has always existed, but until recently, it had not expanded into the digital realm. To be sure, a passerby could purchase something from a yard sale directly with cash. You know, the wrinkled and cotton based paper you might have in your wallet? You probably don't have any. But no digital means to exercise that inherent freedom, to transact directly without an intermediary existed. That is, not until bitcoin.
01:11:02.204 - 01:11:57.764, Speaker A: Sure, we have digital dollars today. We have fintech apps. But most digital systems we possess today are nothing more than window dressing atop the existing centralized intermediaries, a slick UX serving as a veneer over the legacy system. The gatekeepers have persisted, and gatekeep they have in almost every country on earth, from liberal democracies to totalitarian dictatorships. Those gatekeepers have blocked, frozen, even stolen the funds of citizens, even those who have broken no local laws. And they've relegated that freedom to transact to a mere suggestion, one that can be taken away without even a court order. Our once free and open system is today a web of interlocking, rent seeking intermediaries and gatekeepers, all with the behemoth government surveillance apparatus strapped on top.
01:11:57.764 - 01:12:51.404, Speaker A: Bank Secrecy act reporting thresholds were set in the 1970s and haven't been updated for inflation. The $10,000 suspicious activity report and currency transaction report threshold set then is the equivalent of $2,000 today. The threshold has remained the same despite significant declines in dollar purchasing power, effectively expanding the surveillance state. Nobody voted for this. Soon, the purchase of a consumer electronics good could require the filing of a SAR. Government has deputized banks and technology companies as a means to surveil and restrict the innate human freedom to transact. And now some want to deputize software developers, computation data centers, and indeed, everyday Americans who choose to run bitcoin software in their own homes.
01:12:51.404 - 01:14:02.694, Speaker A: This is not good for bitcoin, our economy, or for America. Why did our core human freedoms not transpose to new global communications, economic, and technological networks? For what reason did the technological expansion of the last 75 years mean that humans could not continue to transact directly with one another as they have for millennia? The reality is that each technological advancement presents new opportunities, opportunities for both liberty and enslavement, for justice and travesty, for majesty and manipulation. There will always be forces who seek to pervert the tools of the future, to perpetuate the injustices of the past. Our challenge as humans and Americans is to build and grow society while not only maintaining but expanding human freedom. Bitcoin is a tool for expanding human freedom. You will hear today about how bitcoin supports human rights and liberty across the world, from activists who fund their operations to refugees who protect their wealth. You might ask whether the freedom to transact has negative repercussions.
01:14:02.694 - 01:14:34.702, Speaker A: Some might remember the quote from Ben Franklin quite famously, those who would give up a central liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. But the reality is that bitcoin is a terrible ledger for crime. Its transactions are transparent. Its ledger is permanent. Law enforcement forensic investigators will tell you that bitcoin is easier to trace than traditional fiat and that its use for illicit activity has mostly declined in both real and relative terms over time. But bitcoin has other features that make.
01:14:34.718 - 01:14:36.676, Speaker C: It widely adopted around the world.
01:14:36.870 - 01:15:21.460, Speaker A: In addition to transactional freedom, bitcoin is also provably and predictably scarce. It's well known as digital gold, scarce enough to hold its value, but available enough to be good money. In fact, bitcoin was the first instantiation of digital scarcity in human history. It literally undoes copy and paste on the computer, which is why it has succeeded as the first natively digital money. Just as scarcity drives value across commodities and other goods, scarcity is also core to bitcoin's value. It stands in stark contrast to the supreme abundance of the United States dollar and other fiat currencies. Proximity to that money printer has helped the United States expand its influence around the world.
01:15:21.460 - 01:15:50.114, Speaker A: But that expansion has come at a heavy price. Crippling debt it is no secret that the us government is doing a dismal job at managing its finances. Just during this speech alone, the us government will have added $200 million to the national debt. A buck 50 per us household every 30 minutes. $10 billion a day. $1 trillion every 100 days. That debt is unsustainable, and everybody knows it.
01:15:50.114 - 01:16:28.118, Speaker A: We are on a path that leads to one of two places, huge spending cuts and tax increases or crippling inflation. This used to be the iconic swan song of doom saying gold bugs. But I promise you, markets have figured it out. It took time, but it's now the mainstream investing consensus on Wall street. Real rates as a measure of nominal interest rates minus the inflation rate, have diverged significantly from the gold price. Demand for gold is rising worldwide, while demand for us government debt is declining. For years, gold and US Treasuries served as hedges and traded with a high positive correlation.
01:16:28.118 - 01:17:13.174, Speaker A: Today, that correlation is deeply negative. The world is literally stockpiling gold while reducing its exposure to us debt. Why could that be? This should worry every american and every american policymaker. This is american interest, power and influence declining before our eyes. Now, if that worries you, and if you think that bitcoin further undermines american interests, power and influence, the best insurance is to own bitcoin and to support the growth of the bitcoin industry in America. We are already the global leader in bitcoin ownership, entrepreneurship, mining, technology and intellect. The us government is the largest holder of bitcoin.
01:17:13.174 - 01:17:59.094, Speaker A: There's no surprise that America is the global bitcoin leader. We have the deepest and best capital markets, the strongest property rights, the most legally codified human rights. And our values align with the open, permissionless nature of the bitcoin protocol. Bitcoin brings jobs, growth, prosperity and liberty. And this is a lead we should not squander. Contrary to what some critics will tell you, bitcoin and America can succeed together. While it is true that as a fixed supply commodity money, bitcoin's value is impacted by the imprudence of our monetary and fiscal policies, it is also true, as I've argued, that bitcoin is an expression of american values and power, not just a hedge against their dominance.
01:17:59.094 - 01:18:30.514, Speaker A: Bitcoin doesn't just hedge against american dominance and influence. It enhances it. Bitcoin is innovation, it is liberty, it is power, and it is hope. We can grow our economy, bring and keep jobs in America and expand our international and geopolitical influence by embracing the gold of the future. And the good news is, to accomplish that, we don't really have to do anything. It's more about what we shouldn't do. We're already the global leader we need, just not squander it.
01:18:30.514 - 01:19:12.494, Speaker A: And make no mistake, if we make it impossible for bitcoin to thrive in America, we won't be banning bitcoin. We'll be banning America from bitcoin because bitcoin is here to stay. That's the reality. If the United States doesn't press its advantage, other nations will. And other nations are. And those nations might be ones who do not see the world the way that we do and who choose to build a different future that is much more damaging to our values than an american bitcoin industry ever could be. The future is digital, and the United States has pole position to ensure that the Internet's digital native money has a safe and vibrant american foundation.
01:19:12.494 - 01:19:46.158, Speaker A: If we drop this ball, somebody else will pick it up and we might not like the way they play the game. Thank you. Thanks for listening to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. If you enjoy the show, please like.
