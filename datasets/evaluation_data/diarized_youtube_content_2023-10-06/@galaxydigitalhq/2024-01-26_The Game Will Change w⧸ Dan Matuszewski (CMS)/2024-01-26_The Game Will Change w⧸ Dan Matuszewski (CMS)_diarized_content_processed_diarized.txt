00:01:31.892 - 00:01:48.116, Speaker A: I was really digging in the crates for this one. I don't know if people really realize, but not only do we rap, do I rap on this podcast, but every beat I've used is one that I made. You keep lamenting to me that you're running out of beats, but then somehow I get a text in the morning.
00:01:48.180 - 00:01:49.756, Speaker B: Saying, here's three options.
00:01:49.820 - 00:02:05.428, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm digging through crates, dude. That's the old terminology when we're talking about vinyls. Shout out to my friend vinyl, by the way, still finding a couple gems. We'll see. I'm trying not to reuse any. You know, we're gonna have to at some point. Well, we have some awesome stuff coming up on galaxy brains.
00:02:05.428 - 00:02:16.932, Speaker A: Some. Several interviews already recorded and in the lineup with big, big guests. I know you're gonna like. I don't wanna spoil the surprise, but also we are launching another podcast out of this production studio.
00:02:17.068 - 00:02:18.132, Speaker B: Very exciting.
00:02:18.308 - 00:02:25.424, Speaker A: Also brought to you by my friend Phineas and his great team. And I don't wanna give it away too much, but it should be launching soon.
00:02:26.034 - 00:02:27.634, Speaker C: Very soon. We've been working on it.
00:02:27.674 - 00:02:38.586, Speaker A: Everyone's. We've been thinking about it and planning it for a while now. It's another big brain. We're gonna have a banger. Another production from Galaxy Research. We're expanding our podcast empire.
00:02:38.650 - 00:02:39.454, Speaker B: That's right.
00:02:39.834 - 00:02:51.034, Speaker A: That's right. It's gonna be exciting. I know our audience will like it. Let's get right to Bimnet a bibi. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from galaxy trading. As always, BiMnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:02:51.114 - 00:02:52.254, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:02:52.804 - 00:03:15.444, Speaker A: So, another week in the books since we last talked. I think you well enunciated a near term bearish case for BTC last week. Where does it just stand now in your mind? I mean, we've had a whole another week in the books. We've traded sub 40 finally after as low as, like, maybe what, the low 38? Yeah, 38 five. A little bit of stability right now just at 40k.
00:03:15.524 - 00:03:15.900, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:03:15.972 - 00:03:17.064, Speaker A: What are you thinking now?
00:03:17.444 - 00:04:02.684, Speaker B: I think 40k is. Is kind of a crucial level. I'd like to see us sustainably, like, have closes above 40k for me to start getting constructive about the market. I think right now what you've seen so far is 38,500. And like, the hundred day moving average, those levels have held us support, whether that's from organic, you know, demand, or from short covering or from gamma hedging, you know, it's tough to say. But bitcoin has certainly found support in a region that you would have thought should have been like, first line of support. And now, in order to get more constructive about an upside scenario, you really need to see 40k hold as support.
00:04:02.684 - 00:05:07.236, Speaker B: Right now, we're hovering in and around the level, and it doesn't seem like there's genuine organic robust demand right now. However, what is notable is that grayscale volumes have started to decrease and eventually that flow will abate. There is a level at which folks are going to stop converting out of grayscale, but that still might be a couple billion or 10 billion couple weeks. So generally speaking, I think the market is trading pretty healthily or okay. And I think corrections in a market that have moved 160% in a year or even just in the last quarter, like the move that bitcoin had, I think a correction like this is very healthy. You're talking about 20 to 30 ish percent off the highs. I mean, I think that's as long as we kind of hold here.
00:05:07.236 - 00:05:46.876, Speaker B: Tells you you're still probably in an uptrend. But it really depends on what kind of timeframe you're thinking about this stuff. I'm pretty confident that as soon as the grayscale overhang kind of abates, that just the passive inflows are really going to take this market higher. And so if you're sitting back and thinking, is now a good time to get into bitcoin, I think it's an okay time to start averaging in over time. And, you know, and I think that's what a product like an ETF is for. Right, right. Your dollar cost average and you make it part of your 401K allocation, et cetera.
00:05:46.876 - 00:05:49.436, Speaker B: And over time, you build a reasonably sized position.
00:05:49.540 - 00:06:16.444, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it makes sense. To your point about the healthy corrections. Actually, if you look back at the 2017 bull run in bitcoin, there were like literally like 720 percent plus corrections during that run from eight hundred dollars to twenty thousand dollars. I forget the number of corrections from 20 and 21, but there were a similar large number. I mean, people only remember a number. It went up, but actually it was volatile. So I agree.
00:06:16.444 - 00:06:47.710, Speaker A: Totally, totally healthy. You also have, look, this is a wall bitcoin's got a run through. Right. I mean, I think, think about this. People also been talking a lot about the Mount Gox coins, which I'm of the belief won't really be distributed for another six to nine months anyway. That's also, we clear those out, you're not going to go to, I don't know, $100,000, a million dollars of bitcoin without resolving these things. So it's a core thing we've got to deal with and they will be dealt with.
00:06:47.902 - 00:06:48.822, Speaker B: No, I agree.
00:06:48.918 - 00:06:49.854, Speaker A: I don't sound cryptic.
00:06:49.934 - 00:07:18.466, Speaker B: No. And I think the broader risk background is also constructive for bitcoin. I mean, Nasdaq today is just, you know, up another percent. We've had a couple tech names report earnings. So all time high, all time high. Some of the magnificent seven names are trading at fresh all time highs. Household wealth is at the dead highs, and the fiscal picture has not improved at all.
00:07:18.466 - 00:07:27.404, Speaker B: And so I think there is still constant demand for speculation for store of value and bitcoin as a combo of.
00:07:27.444 - 00:07:56.774, Speaker A: The two speculation on the future of store of value is one way that we think about it. So you mentioned macro, and the macro backdrop. FOMC is next week. So obviously next week we'll talk about it when it happens. But the market's expectations had been for a nice set of cuts. And then was it last week that, or even the week before we had some very hawkish Fed speak come out that slightly altered it. But it's still, what are your expectations for next week?
00:07:57.114 - 00:08:27.172, Speaker B: Yeah, so we've got to get through like a bunch of data, like between now and then. You've got initial jobless claims, you've got the quarterly refunding announcement, you've got PCE data on Friday. And so I think the market is going to focus on those data points up until FOMC. But ultimately the data side of me tells me that the Fed shouldn't be cutting and that the data is still super strong.
00:08:27.228 - 00:08:28.308, Speaker A: We don't need them to cut.
00:08:28.356 - 00:09:29.052, Speaker B: We don't need them to cut. I mean, initial jobs claims printed below 200, like pmis this morning were in expansion territory and surprise to the upside. And so there's a healthy and really good argument to be made that you don't need any cuts. But what I heard from Powell during December FOMC was that he is starting to think about a cutting cycle. And he is very aware that in six months time and in nine months time that inflation will be at or below target or below. You don't want below. And so if you're in a world where you know that inflation has come down a lot and is likely coming down further, like, why on earth are you having rates at such restrictive levels? And so this is kind of where I differ from the market a lot, is folks have been pushing back against a march cut, and there's about ten basis points priced into that March meeting right now, which is the first potential meeting where they could cut.
00:09:29.052 - 00:09:42.316, Speaker B: And I just think that if you think that you're gonna have to be cutting in June and September and May, you might as well just get started with a 25 in March and signal that you are trying to get ahead of it.
00:09:42.420 - 00:09:46.660, Speaker A: Better to cut and then pause and then cut than to surprise the market with no cut. Is that.
00:09:46.692 - 00:09:46.884, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:09:46.924 - 00:10:02.028, Speaker B: Or it's also just you want to take a more gradual approach, like 25 x, space it out longer. Right. If you're trying to do at least 100 basis, like let's say you're about 150 basis points too restrictive right now for current market conditions.
00:10:02.116 - 00:10:02.340, Speaker C: Right.
00:10:02.372 - 00:10:15.192, Speaker B: So that implies that you want to take rates to call it 360 ish 300, 5363, hundred 70 somewhere around there. And you don't want to mess with the election too much and be perceived going one way or two.
00:10:15.208 - 00:10:17.856, Speaker A: You want to get going earlier and have it be going already and go.
00:10:17.880 - 00:11:08.378, Speaker B: At a predictable pace and you want to go steady. And so while there's been fed pushback from a lot of speakers, including Waller, most notably, I think you had Jim Bullard, who retired from the Fed and is now working at Purdue University. He came out and was like, I could see the Fed starting cutting as early as March. And he was one of the biggest rate hike guys during the hiking cycle, he was calling for 575% to 6%. At some point he's like, when unemployment rate is giving you the gift of not going up a lot, you should be very aggressive. But now he's just like, wait, where's inflation going to be in twelve months time? And like, where do you want your rates to be when inflation is there?
00:11:08.426 - 00:11:17.974, Speaker A: This is the soft landing attempt. They want to, maybe if they see, they look forward to where they think the data is going to be, they want to start cutting now so that the crash isn't hard. So it's not a hard landing. Yeah, correct.
00:11:18.554 - 00:11:33.296, Speaker B: Just trying to mitigate that a little machinations. The upside to that, though, is the easing you've had in financial conditions. I mean, like the stock market's just gone up a lot. People don't, you know, people that are invested in the equity market don't feel poor right now.
00:11:33.360 - 00:11:33.964, Speaker A: Right.
00:11:34.304 - 00:12:07.054, Speaker B: And, you know, those are the same type of people that are gonna be property buyers if mortgage rates come down. And so, and there's compounded, you know, wealth effects to this, you know, equity dynamic. And so I think, you know, there's some risks to cutting early as well to kind of manage. But given the tone of Powell last December, I just think that he's committed to cutting rates and that's all that matters. It's not really data. It's really what, like, what does Powell want and what is the fed actually going to do?
00:12:07.174 - 00:12:18.614, Speaker A: And we can debate and you've made a case for keeping him higher, longer. But also, I mean, the real question, and I'm asking what everyone is wondering is what will happen? And your point is that he's already sort of locked into this narrative that.
00:12:18.694 - 00:12:34.454, Speaker B: Yeah, he's going to be cutting. It's just a question of when and by how much. And it's like, dude, you start cutting in maybe, right? Do you allow five months into the year when, you know, like, if I knew for sure, if I was Powell and I was like, rates are too restrictive right now.
00:12:35.154 - 00:12:35.586, Speaker C: Right.
00:12:35.650 - 00:12:40.178, Speaker B: If I knew for sure and I was really confident in that view, I'd start cutting.
00:12:40.266 - 00:12:40.610, Speaker C: Right?
00:12:40.682 - 00:12:45.938, Speaker B: Like, I'd cut maybe in Jan, like, maybe in like February start.
00:12:46.026 - 00:12:47.290, Speaker A: You just can always pause.
00:12:47.362 - 00:13:06.302, Speaker B: You can pause, but it's also doing 25 and like, the logic is sound, right. Nobody's gonna, like, disagree with him. That's rates are probably too restrictive given the inflation levels and we kind of see where things are headed. And so I think you want to take a more gradual, smoothed approach.
00:13:06.438 - 00:13:08.094, Speaker A: And it's tinkering.
00:13:08.214 - 00:13:10.374, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't know.
00:13:10.414 - 00:13:31.026, Speaker A: It's just funny. I know. I mean, it's obviously the way the modern economy and monetary policies work every time we talk about this. I mean, maybe because I'm so interested in bitcoin, the contrast is just so striking because now if it happens in March or may or anytime, I mean, right. We have the having in April.
00:13:31.130 - 00:13:32.730, Speaker B: Yeah. It lines up really well.
00:13:32.802 - 00:13:34.298, Speaker A: Yeah. Just, just like last time.
00:13:34.346 - 00:13:40.242, Speaker B: Yeah. And it also want, you know, potentially the Fed might be tapering. It's, it's quantitative tightening.
00:13:40.298 - 00:13:48.642, Speaker A: So they're easing in rate, perhaps in rates and in balance sheet. At the same time. Bitcoin is credibly, automatically tightening, quote, unquote.
00:13:48.738 - 00:13:53.734, Speaker B: And I mean, that narrative writes itself. It does. It does.
00:13:54.994 - 00:14:00.970, Speaker A: Chairman Powell, when he goes before Congress, like, what his comments are on the bitcoin having, I think would be a really great question I would like to.
00:14:01.002 - 00:14:08.290, Speaker B: Ask him, like, hey, buddy, did you see the CBO's projections of where debt to GDP is going to be in 30 years time?
00:14:08.362 - 00:14:09.970, Speaker A: This is your big hobby horse. And you're right.
00:14:10.082 - 00:14:18.082, Speaker B: It's like 250% from a congressional budget office. That is like not telling you the full truth.
00:14:18.138 - 00:14:21.570, Speaker A: Like, you're an economist, sir. Is that sustainable for a nation?
00:14:21.682 - 00:14:26.692, Speaker B: Yes. Like, basically, I mean, this goes back to the whole idea of, like, fiscal dominance.
00:14:26.748 - 00:14:26.988, Speaker C: Right.
00:14:27.036 - 00:14:33.140, Speaker B: Monetary policy is gonna be dominated or heavily influenced by its need to finance.
00:14:33.172 - 00:14:37.396, Speaker A: The debt, but yet he refuses to talk about it, the main purpose for it.
00:14:37.460 - 00:14:39.504, Speaker B: He's like, well, congress sets fiscal policy.
00:14:39.844 - 00:14:42.344, Speaker A: I know, I get it. And they just need to remain independent.
00:14:43.164 - 00:14:49.792, Speaker B: We're just, and like, it's like, you can't win with either party. They're just gonna both spend more.
00:14:49.948 - 00:14:50.776, Speaker C: Right? You've said this.
00:14:50.800 - 00:14:53.120, Speaker A: Nobody gets elected saying they're gonna cut spending. Really?
00:14:53.192 - 00:14:53.520, Speaker C: No.
00:14:53.592 - 00:14:54.648, Speaker A: And it's really escalating zero.
00:14:54.696 - 00:15:04.240, Speaker B: It's like either the Dems are gonna increase spending like crazy. Or the Republicans are gonna cut taxes like crazy and your deficit's just gonna end up being, like, absurd.
00:15:04.312 - 00:15:24.348, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a cognitive dissonance. Of course we know why he doesn't wanna come out. Cause it's political, quote, unquote. But in reality, it's not political. It's simple math. And it's also, if you're saying one of the main things driving central bank policy to not talk about it, it's just like. And pretend that it's only unemployment and inflation, that is what's driving your policy.
00:15:24.348 - 00:15:26.464, Speaker A: Like, that simply can't be true.
00:15:26.804 - 00:15:27.892, Speaker B: I completely agree with that.
00:15:27.908 - 00:15:32.876, Speaker A: And going forward, it definitely won't be true. Then they really will have to be thinking about it every day. They don't.
00:15:32.980 - 00:15:56.204, Speaker B: And then the other part of it is, you know that when you expand the balance sheet, right, that is permanent debt being added to, you know, the economy and the balance sheet. And, like, you can't tell me that it doesn't impact inflation and demand. Like, when you increase your balance sheet by $6 trillion in a short span.
00:15:56.864 - 00:15:57.248, Speaker C: Right.
00:15:57.296 - 00:16:05.544, Speaker B: Like, that has led to a permanent increase in demand. And so the inflation issue is perpetually going to be there.
00:16:05.704 - 00:16:06.024, Speaker C: Right.
00:16:06.064 - 00:16:11.938, Speaker B: If you have to cut rates and manage the balance sheet around, you know, the fiscal spending.
00:16:12.106 - 00:16:12.434, Speaker C: Right.
00:16:12.474 - 00:16:24.354, Speaker B: Like, and every time we have job cuts and shit, unemployment benefits. Here's some more money. Here's some checks in the mail. Like, it's just, like, it's hard to stomach.
00:16:24.434 - 00:16:24.786, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:24.850 - 00:16:35.594, Speaker B: And the problem is just the time disconnect. Like, that's a trade for, you know, the next 510 years, you know, versus monetary policy right now. And so it's just.
00:16:35.634 - 00:16:36.272, Speaker C: It's just tough.
00:16:36.338 - 00:16:47.584, Speaker A: All right, baby bim, head of baby, my friend from Galaxy trading. Thank you so much. Let's go now to our guest, Dan Maciszewski from CMS Holdings. Dan, welcome back to Galaxy Brains.
00:16:47.964 - 00:16:49.424, Speaker C: Excited to be here.
00:16:49.764 - 00:17:11.944, Speaker A: It's always fun talking with Dan. Dan's been in the market a long time. CMS is. I asked you this last time, no limited partners, solely you and your partner's own capital gives Dan a very interesting, unvarnished, unbiased view of the market. So I always like talking to him. And so much has happened. I think it was November of 22 that you were on the show last, and its been over a year.
00:17:11.944 - 00:17:26.316, Speaker A: Gosh, I mean, what did 23? If you had to characterize 23, how would you. We started at 16, five, and bitcoin ended at like 40, 42. A lot of other stuff happened. What was the year like the back.
00:17:26.340 - 00:17:57.860, Speaker C: Of 22 was bleed, right? Like I dont know, it was just everybody was falling down, every lender died. Like the borrower got sucked out of the market, everybody got delevered. A lot of stuff like folded. It was just like, that was like actually when I was on here I pretty close to like the weariness that looked for a while and then like markets do. They do they bought it except quite a bit like the ETF narrative kicked off. And when did, when did they start making comments? About February. I want to say march.
00:17:57.972 - 00:18:15.874, Speaker A: Yeah, well June. Well, yeah, so march or so I think was the oral arguments and grayscale and then Bloomberg's litigation guy Elliot Stein upped the odds. I forget what they were at that point. But then the discussion was like, okay, but really June, I think when Blackrock filed is when it really sort of kicked off with ETF.
00:18:15.914 - 00:18:37.884, Speaker C: That's when it was like really like a thing. Yeah right. That's been like a huge tailwind. I think also something that's been pretty big that like doesn't necessarily get as much play is the FTX claims got pretty good value, which obviously went in conjunction with the market. But a lot of people, I think, were able to exit that and get some cash. I think that was like actually a pretty good stimulus back into the market. And also just like that not being a zero helped a lot of sort of folks out there.
00:18:37.884 - 00:18:55.056, Speaker C: That's money. That sort of like came back into the ecosystem. I mean, a lot of stuff got hockey sticks saved. Like Solano being the biggest performance, right. That, like, came to life, brought the ecosystem roaring back. A lot of people got up on positions there that gave them risk capital to do other stuff. So I think it's.
00:18:55.056 - 00:19:21.598, Speaker C: I think it's generally, it reminded me a lot of, like 2019 sort of coming out. Remember like when the Facebook thing, the Libra was like the narrative instead of the ETF. I mean, ETF's more real. Like, Libra never went anywhere. And I think the ETF has like more of a actual, like change in sort of supply and demand structure. But anyway, like, people just like got risk appetite again and kind of had been up until like the last like week or so. I know we've seen like some material selling people taking some risks that they ran.
00:19:21.598 - 00:19:28.354, Speaker C: I mean, stuff got a little frothy. Like, I mean, there was some random stuff that was just like tripling over the course of a week that like.
00:19:28.434 - 00:19:30.906, Speaker A: Yeah, there were dog tokens on every chain, right?
00:19:31.050 - 00:20:18.492, Speaker C: Yeah, there was like a lot of, like pure just gambling going on, which is fine. Like, I have no, like, issue with people doing that. But, like, there was a little bit of mania going on in there. But, like, you also, I guess, like, the thing is, the question's been the last two months, is it just the same pool of capital recycling or have we seen, like, new, like, sustained inflows from either retail or has there been any, like, real inflow from institutional stuff into the ETF side? I think the ETF stuff we got, like, I've been saying that. I think since get is, like, it's going to be some time to really see what that looks like, not to get too caught in the weeds of, like, the first couple weeks or months. So we'll see how that baselines and what accretive flow sort of, like, comes from that. But I think a lot of the longer tail asset, like, whack a mole that was going on, it was, like, a lot of the same capital, just like, recycling.
00:20:18.492 - 00:20:54.376, Speaker C: I don't think there was, like, a ton of new retail interest that was, like, pushing stuff through, which is good in the sense that there's, like, latent demand. That's not. It's not like you're, like, at this point where, like, every, like, spare capital dollar that's out there, like, that wants, like, crypto risk is, like, deployed. It was kind of just like people got rich because they're, like, assets had, like, recovered so much from, like, the bottom that they, like, got a little, like, more aggressive on the risk curve. I think that's how we were sort of seeing that, like, play through. I think that the real material flows for bitcoin in particular be like, what the ETF does over the coming weeks to months. And then, like, ETH is sort of going to have, like, the same, like, thing.
00:20:54.376 - 00:21:13.024, Speaker C: Like, is there going to be, like, material flows in there? Like, what is that? Sort of, like, people keep talking about this may date. I think that's, like, way too soon, but, like, there'll be, like, potentially that narrative, too, on the ETF. So anyway, that's, like. So, like, look, so stuff's way better than it was last time we talked about that. Yeah. Like, things feel great. Like, yeah, like, sure.
00:21:13.024 - 00:21:23.734, Speaker C: The most recent history is, like, a little, like, annoying, but, like, we're much better as an industry, I think. So, yeah. There's been some material selling now.
00:21:24.034 - 00:21:57.814, Speaker A: Yeah, there has. In just sort of the last week or so, a lot of people were asking leading into the ETF launches if it would be a sell the news event. I think it was hard for people. Look, obviously, if we look at price, we see that bitcoin price is down materially. I mean, over 20% from launch day. But I think that that might give the sell the newsers too much credit because I really view this as a sell the structure event with the grayscale unlock, we're going to call it. Keep in mind, we didn't know Grayscale's fees until Monday morning of launch week.
00:21:57.814 - 00:22:07.054, Speaker A: And so I think it is possible if the fees had come in much lower that you wouldn't see the level of selling and redemptions there that we have been. What's your thought on that overall?
00:22:07.354 - 00:22:41.072, Speaker C: I mean, I think the biggest bogey is just FTX chucked a yard into it. Right? Like the estate, like John Ray, like launched into it. I don't know if that's confirmed yet, but it seems pretty much coming from the right sources that like that. Gotcha. So that was like, I was a big one off that just got like pushed through. I think there was also just like a lot of people that had bought that thing at a discount. Do you remember when like three ac was blowing up, block five was blowing up all that stuff? Like a lot of that grayscale risk, like, some of it the estate held for FTX, but some of it also just like ended on other deaths in Chicago who like, took it on as like a pear trade.
00:22:41.072 - 00:23:12.316, Speaker C: I think a lot of that got like just chalk. So there was people that wanted to unwind this thing and that was sort of the level. Obviously, when it got out there, they're going to be offered on it. The premium or the discount in this case is coming in, which I think is showing that that's abating a little bit. There's going to be people that are going to want to rotate out of it, and that's going to be probably for the lifecycle of that thing. Nobody wants to be holding it versus competitors. There's a lot of tax consideration that needs to be like, put in for a lot of those people that are stuck in it.
00:23:12.316 - 00:23:49.586, Speaker C: But like, I mean, the chart stays, right? That's like what the just continue to go over time. It's just the amount of people that want to sell it to take risk off versus the amount of people that want to sell it to replace deltas and the other products. And I don't know what the breakout of it. That is great. But obviously it was front loaded with a lot of people that wanted to use that liquidity and they traded that to par as a word, opening with ETF, it's like a way to get off positions that they had put in that thing lower. Because if you think about it, like a shit ton of bitcoin traded at like very cheap levels in GBTC over the course of like years that like wanted to be sort of realized. So I think that was like the big bogan.
00:23:49.586 - 00:24:06.218, Speaker C: Like the fees hurt though. Like it's not, I don't know, it's like not great. Like people definitely want to get rid of it. So it's like this toxic sort of like, thing in the market, but it's not like people keep saying, oh, they have 28 billion, it's like not like all that. People don't own that to sell. Like, it's not like people suddenly don't want bitcoin. They just like don't want it in that vehicle.
00:24:06.218 - 00:24:23.912, Speaker C: So they like want to take it off. Delta neutral, it's just like optically, I think people have, like, they just keep looking and they're like, oh, there's outflows. It's all selling. And like, it's like, actually if you look across the complex, there's net issue. Like there's net. What is it? Like 750 million as of today, inflow. So, like, it's still like positive.
00:24:23.912 - 00:24:32.104, Speaker C: It's just like nobody wants the grayscale version of it and they got to get into the other products and there's some people that just like naturally want to sell it. So, yeah, that's kind of like where it's at.
00:24:32.264 - 00:25:03.304, Speaker A: Yeah, that's, that's sort of how I view it, too. I do wonder about that net that the Bloomberg guys are talk about. You know, could that some people be selling bitcoin to go in to it? Like, could the Delta be being replaced from elsewhere? I don't know, but I agree with you that like the real thing to watch is months, not, not days or weeks. I think these products are primarily designed for financial advisors and they're not really here yet. So I don't think it's. But you know that unfortunately the unlock is here. Supply side.
00:25:03.304 - 00:25:04.992, Speaker A: I mean, it's the biggest supply event.
00:25:05.088 - 00:25:05.504, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:25:05.584 - 00:25:37.144, Speaker A: In basically bitcoin history. But I, you know, I saw somebody tweet this today and I agree with it that to really move forward with a major bull run, you're going to have theoretically grayscale unwind to some either. I mean, it won't go all the way. I agree completely, but to some amount equilibrium and then you'll have gox payout maybe in the summer or in the fall. And that's pretty much it in terms of known. I guess you've got to get some us government coins. But it pales in comparison to the size of those two, though.
00:25:38.634 - 00:25:48.258, Speaker C: Yeah. The cox thing is so hard to get a feel. I really watched it for a decade now. I just so skeptical it'll ever happen. But I saw people were tweeting about.
00:25:48.306 - 00:26:05.378, Speaker A: Like today because some emails went out, like, saying that the, if you had selected an exchange to get your payout to that, that had been confirmed. And so it was a fresh round, I think, this morning on Twitter of, like, you know, gox fud. But, you know, as far as I understand it, I've talked to some folks that this thing's not going to be distributed until the summer, probably at the earliest.
00:26:05.426 - 00:26:05.838, Speaker C: So.
00:26:05.946 - 00:26:35.634, Speaker A: But either way, we get through these two walls and then there's finally, let's hope, you know, knock it on wood, hopefully overhangs well. Exactly. And you get the having. So that should be positive, I think, at least for narrative. Yeah, it's tricky. Dan, I want to ask you, too. I asked you about last year to this year, but what about over the years you've been, you're obviously, you run a buy side fund now firm, but you've been on the sell side and, you know, used to do trading at circle.
00:26:35.634 - 00:27:04.354, Speaker A: How is the sell side pick any. I don't want to go all the way back. I think we did this conversation a little bit the last time you were on from circle days and polo days to today, but so much more has evolved. You talk about the lenders blowing out. What does the sell side look like to you now? And to what extent do you think the ETF's, like, say if you get options on the ETF's, you're getting margin now on ETF shares. How might the ETF's further evolve what the sell side looks like in crypto?
00:27:05.044 - 00:27:28.044, Speaker C: Yeah, so I tend to be the assumption that, like, a good slug of liquidity will pull into the ETF vehicles, like, as time goes on. I mean, that's going to take a little bit longer. The options, I think they just submitted for approval. Right. They're looking at like 20 days timeline, I give or take. So let's call it a month. The volume market, I think, is the most likely one that could get shipped because, like, derabit right now, like, sort of owns that.
00:27:28.044 - 00:27:55.590, Speaker C: Right. And, like, people don't really want to trade the CME. The options on the CME future is as much. But I do think that, like, counterparties that are looking to trade volume might shift towards the options complex on the ETF just because I don't know how people feel about like, facing darabit necessarily. And like, it's also would be good to like, diversify that, like risk a little bit. But right now it's like, it just very much is the derabit show. So I think the options thing might, like, move over more than like the spot necessarily will.
00:27:55.590 - 00:28:07.486, Speaker C: But I do think a good amount of spot volume will start to, like, come through. I would love to have, like, us hours of, like, trading is actually like, instead of like this, like constant nonsense all over, but like, that is just.
00:28:07.510 - 00:28:25.270, Speaker A: Like, also despite, you know, the pain trade there. Yeah, the pain trade is on that topic is that tradfi ends up moving to 24/7 instead. Like, they move to where bitcoin is rather than us to where they are. Right.
00:28:25.342 - 00:28:49.868, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's a pipe dream anyway. I do think some good amount of spot on. I think there's people that would trade physical that were institutionalized that would prefer not to, that will like use the ETF. I think that's like the big shift. Like the crypto native people are not gonna like, I think there's very few people that are in the, that are trading other things in crypto besides bitcoin that are suddenly going to want to be using the ETF product because your capital gets locked out of, like, the ecosystem. Right. Like, this is the big problem.
00:28:49.868 - 00:29:17.716, Speaker C: You go, this is a lot of reason that guys, like, didn't move over to CME futures is that if you're trading the ETF, first of all, you're only locked into those market hours. And the second problem is you can't go and do other stuff. You can't suddenly be like, oh, I want to go try Solana. Because there's no corollary product in that ecosystem. If you're not balanced, it's less of a concern. But pretty much everybody's balance sheet is the same. I think that's the biggest gating factor for all the volume going over.
00:29:17.716 - 00:29:19.912, Speaker C: Is it just a lot isn't enough.
00:29:20.108 - 00:29:24.032, Speaker A: Yeah. Let alone DeFi or especially if we talk about ETH, that's going, especially if.
00:29:24.048 - 00:29:28.816, Speaker C: You'Re going like, way out there on the curve. But even just like to trade the other majors, like, you got option. Yeah.
00:29:28.840 - 00:29:30.848, Speaker A: There's no real way to go from bitcoin to ETH even.
00:29:30.936 - 00:29:38.736, Speaker C: Yeah, you can't do it. You're just like, so I think that'll, like, gate some of the, like, stickiness of that being, like, the only vehicle people traded via. Yeah.
00:29:38.760 - 00:29:51.404, Speaker A: I think that's why this really ends up becoming a product for long term financial advisors that maybe rebalance, like, quarterly their clients. Right. It's not really a competitor to the crypto investment and trading ecosystem, um, yet.
00:29:51.864 - 00:30:01.284, Speaker C: Yeah, I just. I like, I don't think it's as much a threat to finance or Coinbase as people think it is. I think a lot of people keep making it, like, oh, Coinbase is just like. I just like, I don't think that's.
00:30:01.944 - 00:30:02.844, Speaker A: Well, yeah.
00:30:04.624 - 00:30:04.960, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:30:04.992 - 00:30:43.634, Speaker A: We have to hope that people are, whether from in this ETF world or just generally, people are learning how to actually use crypto assets. Right. I mean, I think you, you know this audience and you know the value proposition for using bitcoin quite well, right? That it's money that you can't seize, that not even the government could theoretically seize it unless they kick down your door or get your private keys. But if we go out onto the spectrum with something like ETH or Solana, where there's really quite a lot to do on the actual blockchain, you forfeit all of that if you use an ETF. So we hope that there are people who realize that and they actually want to use the thing, not just invest in it.
00:30:44.684 - 00:31:09.288, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think we, like, know a good idea of, like, what the capital is that, like, is less, like, caring about, like, actually using, like, like, great scale has been around for a while. Right? Like, you can use that as like, a proxy of, like, how much of the flow, like, is sort of looking to just be in that ecosystem. Like, that ecosystem being is, like, not actually, like, touching any of the rails. Like, just like, hey, give me deltas and like. Right, right.
00:31:09.476 - 00:31:36.936, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that makes sense. You mentioned binance, Stan. Since we talked, the CFTC, the SEC charged binance. They have civil cases against finance. Obviously, Changpeng Shao Cz was charged and pled guilty to a variety of, if I recall, mostly AML violation type stuff. Similar to what Arthur Hayes ultimately pled guilty to finance. Foreign, real big binance.
00:31:36.936 - 00:31:51.254, Speaker A: Forget binance us for now. I mean, who cares about it? Never was that big. But binance financed, it's still up and running. How important is it to the market still, given all that's happened? And how do you think it will remain a core part of the market structure?
00:31:51.874 - 00:32:20.606, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's still tremendously important. I also still think it will be. Here's the thing. They kind of didn't there was very material change to that business on the back of this. They said they did some stuff wrong, paying a gigantic fine, but they're still operating, right? Like, CZ isn't running it, but as far as, like, the outside observer is, like, it's still operating sort of the same. I think that's huge. I think that was a really good thing for the market too, is that they didn't get shut because it's such a liquidity point for so many things.
00:32:20.606 - 00:32:45.844, Speaker C: So I think it's like, got a great future ahead of it unless there's some like, other lurking thing we don't know about. But, like, I don't know, like the DOJ's been through it now and like, they're fine. They move on. Like, I don't know. Feels pretty good that that, like, that was a very good outcome in my opinion. Obviously, we don't know the final like, verdict of what, like, happens with CZ, but, like, the fact that it's like still standing, functioning pretty much identically as it was before. Barring obviously some changes to, like.
00:32:45.844 - 00:33:15.528, Speaker C: So the thing is, like, I actually think most of the changes that they made on the KyC and AML and like, sort of the like, internal tooling they did to like block stuff. Like, I think that's happened over the last two years is the investigation has been going on, right? Like, you wouldn't continue to keep doing business that, you know, they're like actively looking at like, through that timeframe. So, like, hey, when they're like, you know, so this isn't like the dude just like deciding a Thursday to come at you. So I think it's good. I think a great outcome for them and sort of the market on the other side of it. That's sort of my take.
00:33:15.696 - 00:34:00.374, Speaker A: I think that makes sense. I mean, if I recall from the various allegations, they were really all from like 18, 1920. So to your point, I think they probably have been mostly doing or trying to do what they're now being ordered to do, which is, you know, aml KyC type stuff. And so I think that's probably right, that it's. What about the ongoing monitoring? One of the things it looks like they had agreed to was that, I guess, DOJ, not sec or anyone. That I can tell though, how the internal government agencies share data across agency, I'm not sure, but they're going to be sitting there, I guess, over their shoulder primarily looking at making sure they do KYC. Does that make it more trustworthy? Is this a stamp of approval from the Department of Justice in your mind.
00:34:01.374 - 00:34:36.714, Speaker C: Um, I think it's just like, I think you're like less likely gonna have to be this like lurking. Like, oh, do they, like they're gonna finally look at this thing and then like it's gonna get shut down, right? Like, because it's like, it's like, hey, we're here. We're like paying attention. It's kind of like how you felt about tether after like New York ad, like got a crack at it, right? And you're like, all right, like they're aware, like they're paying and like, because I think they had an ongoing monitoring too that was like part of like the, I do think that the IR's is gonna get a look at everything. Like I think that's like gonna be like a big like bogey for some people. I don't know. I think you should be assuming that they're going to have like any records of any us transactions for like.
00:34:36.754 - 00:34:42.034, Speaker A: Yeah, if you owe money to the government, you should be paying it. People, you know, say that they're gonna.
00:34:42.074 - 00:34:48.050, Speaker C: Put the picture together because they basically have like a look into everybody which was like an inevitability, I think.
00:34:48.122 - 00:34:50.494, Speaker A: But because they have FTX very well.
00:34:51.034 - 00:34:58.186, Speaker C: They definitely have FTX. Yeah. Yeah. So anyway, I think that is like one of the bigger pieces that they wanted for.
00:34:58.330 - 00:35:10.938, Speaker A: And your point too is that like they could have charged CZ or, and would have, I assume if they had found that he had stolen client funds the way that Sam Bankman fried had. Right.
00:35:10.986 - 00:35:13.614, Speaker C: The fact that they did it. Yeah, yeah.
00:35:14.234 - 00:35:15.706, Speaker A: I mean that's our core concern. Right.
00:35:15.730 - 00:35:17.050, Speaker C: I mean, right.
00:35:17.082 - 00:35:25.014, Speaker A: In the scheme of things, obviously, like, you know, because we care about the world and, and we don't want them to be like allowing terrorists or criminals or whomever to use the exchange.
00:35:25.094 - 00:35:25.502, Speaker C: Sure.
00:35:25.598 - 00:35:36.830, Speaker A: I mean we all agree on that, but in terms of the existential market risk, it was all about solvency. And it doesn't seem like there's been any evidence. And you think they. Right. We seem safe there. It seems.
00:35:36.902 - 00:35:43.198, Speaker C: Oh, in no world keep operating. If they thought it was like running fragile, there's just no way. That'd be so weird.
00:35:43.286 - 00:35:43.914, Speaker A: Right.
00:35:44.574 - 00:35:54.056, Speaker C: We gotta get on the AML thing, but like the, like, there's no way. So. Yeah, I mean like obviously you never know, but like I think that's a pretty good vote.
00:35:54.200 - 00:36:07.640, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. It feels, it feels de risked, at least for them. It doesn't mean it. There's, you know, it's not gone completely, but as as it never is with any centralized exchange. But it feels de risked post that DOJ action there. We'll wait and see what happens to CZ. Right.
00:36:07.640 - 00:36:15.920, Speaker A: There was a thing. They were going to let him go home. And then the other judge, this more senior judge above the magistrate, said, no, you have to stay here. Presumably he's in the state somewhere waiting this thing out.
00:36:15.952 - 00:36:21.164, Speaker C: Right? Got to be, right. That's what they said he had to say. He lives somewhere. Yeah.
00:36:21.204 - 00:36:37.180, Speaker A: So when we talk about, I guess, non american billionaires in Crypto, I asked you last time you were here about Justin's son. In fact, what I said was, who's the best trader in Crypto, and why is it Justin sun? And you have a great dialogue. We won't replay it for the.
00:36:37.252 - 00:36:38.076, Speaker C: Well, maybe. You know what?
00:36:38.140 - 00:36:39.996, Speaker A: Let's go ahead and roll that clip real quick.
00:36:40.100 - 00:37:07.236, Speaker C: Justin sun might honestly be the best trader in crypto. Like, the man just, like, he just absolutely top takes it, and he, like, absolutely bottom takes it constantly. I mean, he, like, also creates the bottom and top. That's a pretty. I don't know. I would wager, like, four to $5 billion if I had to, like, guess. And I'd say, like, half that's trading proceeds, and, like, half of that is, like, just tron related stuff.
00:37:07.340 - 00:37:11.596, Speaker A: Okay, we've rolled it. We're back. Dan, has anything. What's going on with Justin?
00:37:11.660 - 00:37:12.620, Speaker C: He. I just.
00:37:12.652 - 00:37:18.184, Speaker A: And this is purely an oddity. I don't know. Or maybe it's not an oddities. Is Justin still important to these markets?
00:37:19.124 - 00:37:47.886, Speaker C: So he's less important right now because, like, Huobi is less important and, like, polo is less important. So, like, I think that is why his, like, sphere of influence has, like, shrunk somewhat. I mean, he still, like, does, like, run, like, a large project. Right? Like, I just, like, Hobie. I. I don't know, a ton of the situation, but as far as I know, it's, like, they're still gaining withdrawals, right? So, like, you're not using it. So, like, that kind of, like, puts the nail in the coffin on that thing until it gets fixed.
00:37:47.886 - 00:38:02.434, Speaker C: And, like, polo, because it's, like, entity adjacent to whole beat. Like, you got to feel, like, the same sort of risk, like, on it. Like, his fear of influence there has, like, definitely been, like, knocked down as far as that, though. Like, I mean, he still, like, operates a chain and, like, he's still. Yeah, sort of out there.
00:38:02.814 - 00:38:05.646, Speaker A: He's big on defi still, right? I mean, as far as I can.
00:38:05.670 - 00:38:10.530, Speaker C: Tell, unless the wallets are tagged wrong. Right? Yeah, yeah. So.
00:38:10.562 - 00:38:16.994, Speaker A: But he did. Did he give up or did he lose his honor? He was an emissary. What, to Granada?
00:38:17.034 - 00:38:21.894, Speaker C: Yeah, that was. That was like a bought position. I, like, think so.
00:38:22.314 - 00:38:23.026, Speaker A: It expired.
00:38:23.090 - 00:38:27.490, Speaker C: I think once it, like, publicly had gotten to a point, they were like, we can't, like, do this anymore. So they got rid of it.
00:38:27.522 - 00:39:05.334, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I always like to ask about Justin because he is truly, in my mind, a creature of these markets in a way that almost nobody else is sort of archetypal of the oddity that crypto markets are versus traditional assets. The guy is, I mean. Right. The tron white paper was almost word for word plagiarized from Ethereum. I mocked it to an audience of fidelity guests when I was head of blockchain research in 2017 as an example of a crazy ICo that was a scam in. Yet Tron is still quite large, and particularly in stablecoin markets.
00:39:05.454 - 00:39:07.674, Speaker C: Yeah. It still moves a lot of tether.
00:39:07.974 - 00:39:21.634, Speaker A: Yeah, it's pretty wild. All right, a couple other questions for Dan before we let him get back to the screens. You're wearing that pith shirt. Pith is. Yeah, it's like a data thing. On Solana, it was something to. On oracle.
00:39:22.494 - 00:39:29.598, Speaker C: On a bunch of chains. Yeah. You like? I mean. Yeah. So we participate. Like, we pump pricing through on that.
00:39:29.646 - 00:39:30.014, Speaker A: Oh, cool.
00:39:30.054 - 00:39:42.376, Speaker C: Sort of trade activity. So, like, we're. We're connected to them. Yeah. So it's definitely, I forget how many things. I think their goal. They said they want to be on 3000 apps by the end of the year.
00:39:42.376 - 00:39:59.520, Speaker C: Wow. So it's a big slug. Sort of like oracle pricing that's out there. And they've, like, some pretty good data sources that feed into it. Like, so obviously, like, we're one of them, but, like, there's a bunch of other, like, traditional. Sort of, like, finance folk that have, like, hopped on, so we'll see where it goes.
00:39:59.672 - 00:39:59.912, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:39:59.928 - 00:40:00.536, Speaker C: What else do you.
00:40:00.600 - 00:40:04.848, Speaker A: What else do you like? The pith started, you said it's a multi chain now, but they started in the Solana ecosystem.
00:40:04.936 - 00:40:07.016, Speaker C: Yeah. Talked about the run up. Yeah.
00:40:07.040 - 00:40:12.184, Speaker A: What's the Solana, what's your take on Solana in general? How do you fit in this new world?
00:40:12.344 - 00:40:20.456, Speaker C: Right, so I'll say this. Like, I think there's, like, obviously been some, like, material activity on that, which is, like, giving a little bit of lift, I think. Also, like, people have to remember, like, Solana got whacked the hardest, so it's.
00:40:20.480 - 00:40:21.480, Speaker A: Like, balanced the hardest.
00:40:21.512 - 00:40:52.040, Speaker C: I think there's a little bit of, like, I said this on, like, another, like, podcast thing, too. I think I like a lot of people in front of that, like, because it's roared back so much that, like, in, like, I don't know, what do we. $8. So, yeah, like, call it twelve x or whatever, but, like, at the same time, like, it fell the hardest from, like, so, like, there's just, it's just trading, like, more volatile to a degree when you, like, zoom out a little bit. So, like, I think because there's other stuff that's, like, rallied a bunch, too. And you don't see people being like, oh, dead people are moving to, like, say, a coin or whatever. So I think.
00:40:52.040 - 00:40:54.356, Speaker C: I don't like the narrative stuff as.
00:40:54.380 - 00:41:04.700, Speaker A: Much, but there is rip David Boric, psi coin. Is that not alive anymore? Let's go. Boston based blockchain companies.
00:41:04.852 - 00:41:06.732, Speaker C: I think he's not part of it anymore, though.
00:41:06.868 - 00:41:11.324, Speaker A: I don't think he is. I think he's working on something else. It exists, though.
00:41:11.404 - 00:41:13.104, Speaker C: It trades. That's what matters.
00:41:16.084 - 00:41:39.364, Speaker A: I do think some of the, some of the ETH Solana, I agree it's price, but also it's meaningfully different. Right. SVM versus EVM, it's monolithic versus this modular blockchain thing that people care about. And then also in particular, NFT markets. I've got a guy here who looks at this a lot, and it really did outpace and grow NFT markets dramatically. It's crazy.
00:41:40.264 - 00:42:01.748, Speaker C: Yeah, look, there's real things happening. We keep in material positions in both of them. I think it's wrong to be like, one's, like, cannibalizing the other. I don't necessarily buy as much, but yeah, there's, like, real projects that have, like, sort of, like, chosen a stake and, like, issue on there or things that are being built that, like, effectively can't be built, like, sort of elsewhere. So.
00:42:01.796 - 00:42:09.884, Speaker A: Well, if you don't buy that narrative, then how are you thinking about something like an ETH soul cross or an ETH BTC cross? Those are two very different questions.
00:42:09.924 - 00:42:28.876, Speaker C: But so we generally just don't pear trade this stuff like that. Mostly because I don't think we have, like, edge in it. And this second being like, I don't know. Like, I think if you have, like, a trade, you. So then you look at, like, ETH bitcoin, you're like, I want to. I think ETH bitcoin is going to, like, rally. Like, generally my thought would be like, you probably just want to be long ETH.
00:42:28.876 - 00:42:51.978, Speaker C: And then if your thesis is like, well, I, like, want to do a delta neutral, I'd be like, we'll try to, like, sell, like, a basket of stuff against it, as opposed to, like, I just like. I don't know. It's too hard, in my opinion. And there's too many idiosyncratic things that can happen to, like, individually, like, pick the crosses, or at least we can. So, like, if that works for other people, they should absolutely do it. But, like, I don't know, people put up some, like, wild, like, pairs that they, like, try to trade. They'll be like, yeah.
00:42:51.978 - 00:43:08.170, Speaker C: Like, thesis on, like, the Avax aptos, like, cross. I think there's another way that's safer that you put that trade on. Yeah, I don't really think. Sorry, go ahead. Be individually, like, short legs is like a bad, like, yeah, I don't know. It's just hard in crypto. Yeah.
00:43:08.202 - 00:43:47.190, Speaker A: I mostly think of them as just expressive of a narrative, and I really don't look to. Honestly, I really have never looked past ETH BTC in crossland until thinking about ETH soul again to help judge. Is that just purely a narrative or is it a real thing that people are talking about? I think EBTC remains somewhat relevant, but it's actually quite hard to think about what happens next. I think it was easy to see, leading into a bitcoin ETF that it should make lows, and it did. And then, of course, when bitcoin dumped from 49 one on launch day, rallied Ethan. But now it's kind of like, hard to see. Figure out what.
00:43:47.190 - 00:43:59.022, Speaker A: Because I tend to believe there's huge regulatory overhang for ETH. It doesn't exist for bitcoin. But on the other hand, if ETH is about to get an ETF, then it's really just not clear where it's.
00:43:59.038 - 00:44:04.318, Speaker C: Going to go also. But if you also just zoom out, it's incredibly stable. It hasn't really.
00:44:04.366 - 00:44:07.354, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I've been blown away six years.
00:44:07.694 - 00:44:08.054, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:44:08.094 - 00:44:24.070, Speaker A: Since 21 in particular. It's basically been in the same range for four years or three years at this point. Anyway, it's an interesting one to think about. Anything else that you're particularly interested in in the space. Talk about pith and soul and ETH. What else are you watching?
00:44:24.142 - 00:44:53.544, Speaker C: Categories, man. We've just started. We're late to this. Digging into the bitcoin, defi and l two sort of stuff. I'm very dismissive just because of how historically, this has not been a thing but, like, it does, there really seems to be momentum and, like, people are trying to, like, give this a go. Um, so we. We're trying to get rapidly up to speed, and we've got a couple of deals now, um, of people that are looking to build sort of stuff, like, on top of, um, I guess, like, what do you want to call it? Like, defi for bitcoin? Like, is that, like, I guess the narrative.
00:44:53.584 - 00:44:58.136, Speaker A: I typically call it bitcoin as a platform as opposed to bitcoin as a monetary asset.
00:44:58.240 - 00:45:14.868, Speaker C: Yeah. So I don't. I wanted to give that a shot. I think that's like, got some legs on it. I think there's also just, like, enough, like, sunk assets in the bitcoin ecosystem that it's not a bad place to sort of try and give it a go. So we've been doing a lot there. That's where we've been spending a lot of resources trying to get up to speed.
00:45:14.868 - 00:45:19.860, Speaker C: It also just seems to be an incredibly bigger thing in Asia, and I think we're just generally late to it here in the west.
00:45:20.012 - 00:45:31.820, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. I've seen quite a lot of this. We've written about ordinals a lot at Galaxy. We've done research on it. We're interested in it as well. I do like you. I struggle.
00:45:31.820 - 00:45:50.556, Speaker A: I see a lot of building happening. I see a lot of enthusiasm. Even a. Of newcomers to bitcoin even. Or people coming back because of it, that all seems quite bullish. And then on the other hand, I say, well, bitcoiners have fought for years to keep this stuff out of the protocol or to be. This is where I say monetary maximalist versus a platform maximalist.
00:45:50.556 - 00:46:13.776, Speaker A: Is bitcoin primarily a monetary instrument, a fixed supply, scarce, censorship resistant, anti central bank money? Or is it a decentralized network upon which to build stuff? It's obviously been the former very dramatically for years now. And I do. I struggle to see, like, the platform take over. But on the other hand, then you look at the volumes and there's quite a lot of.
00:46:13.800 - 00:46:37.038, Speaker C: Right, so, yeah, that's like, the one thing I think that matters is, like, real. There's been some real volume inside this. I mean, because there have been pushes in the past, like, forever, and, like, they always just, like, got crushed and, like, they never went anywhere because they would either get blocked technically, or they just, like, would not be the enthusiasm to sort of get them over the hurdle from the community in it. So this started back with, like, master coin and like, counterparty and stuff.
00:46:37.206 - 00:47:13.508, Speaker A: Exactly. Absolutely. It's always been Heather and omni, and then people try to build. Well, RGB has been built and used, and then there's root. There's always actually been some. I guess the question is, is this finally the time that, you know, it becomes more mainstream? I think, personally, I'm of the view that if you can get performant l two s that looks, look, and feel similar to the l two environment that is growing on ETH and elsewhere, there's really no reason you couldn't see a big breakout for this usage on bitcoin, especially if the l two s, like, I know, in the ops stack, the op stack, like, they want to build the super chain where they all connect to each other. You don't even have to go through ETH.
00:47:13.508 - 00:47:27.366, Speaker A: Like, if they can, like, bring a bitcoin one into that fold, then I don't. I don't see any reason why the l two users from other chains wouldn't also use that or try. That's not even talking about unlocking bitcoin capital. Right. Just sort of connecting to it.
00:47:27.500 - 00:47:28.174, Speaker C: Right.
00:47:29.034 - 00:47:37.946, Speaker A: Okay, so you reside in the state of Massachusetts. There are some very unfavorable politics for bitcoin and crypto in Massachusetts. I know.
00:47:38.010 - 00:47:38.894, Speaker C: Matt Walsh.
00:47:39.674 - 00:47:52.854, Speaker A: Matt Walsh, our mutual friend, is often apologizing on our behalf. What are you doing to solve this for the world, Dan? And when will we see a senator Dan Maciszewski representing us?
00:47:53.624 - 00:48:02.404, Speaker C: There's way too much baggage on me. Hey, tone, I say this. I got involved in the last political cycle pretty big.
00:48:04.144 - 00:48:05.080, Speaker A: GMI, right?
00:48:05.152 - 00:48:21.148, Speaker C: Which is good. Yeah. And the guys who ran that actually do the fair shake now, which is Coinbase's big thing, so they kind of ran with it, which is good. That makes a lot more sense. Right. A 16 Z and Coinbase theory. But that's the same guys who were the political brains behind that move there, and that was actually good.
00:48:21.148 - 00:48:39.316, Speaker C: I think we raised, like, $10 million or something like that and sort of got pretty active on the primary side. Here's the big thing I learned. Elizabeth Warren's not going anywhere. She's, like, basically dug in like a tick. So, like, you got to get used to that. Like, unless she takes a higher office position, she's. Which at that level, has got to be like a cabinet or try to actually give a go.
00:48:39.316 - 00:49:01.990, Speaker C: So she's there. Like, she's actually extremely popular in the state. I think people, like, don't. People don't like her, but, like, she's very popular here. And, like, my own opinions aside, like, she's, like, sort of stuck in. I think the biggest thing that I, like, took away from all that was that there is really not that much opinion for or against crypto from candidates. Most people really don't care.
00:49:01.990 - 00:49:22.362, Speaker C: So one big thing is, it's not a voting issue. The general voting public does not care. And I know Coinbase loves to throw that number of whatever it is, 500 million people own crypto worldwide and 150 million Americans on it. But, like, it is, like, that's true fine, but, like, they don't. They don't vote based on that. And, like, the things they care about are just, like, not related. Right.
00:49:22.362 - 00:50:01.876, Speaker C: So it's not an issue with candidates and it's not an issue with voters, which I think is lost on the crypto community who are so passionate about it and be like, how can this not be, like, so, like, if they're random House of Reps person, like, is talking shit about bitcoin. Like, it doesn't move the needle for them either way. So, like, a lot of them are just, like, voting along with, like, the party line sort of whistles. So the good thing about that is they're not hostile. Like, that was, like, something I noticed is there was not really a lot of, like, hostile. There's a handful of people, obviously, that, like, everybody knows and can name, but, like, there's a lot of upside in that they mostly just, like, don't have formed opinions either way. So I think it's like, I was cautiously optimistic in that, like, this isn't, like, a lost battle or, like, a problem.
00:50:01.876 - 00:50:41.246, Speaker C: It's mostly just like a battle of apathy. But, like, the counter to that is, like, it's very unlikely stuff's going to go through Congress because nobody cares. It's just, like, does not have enough, like, inertia as, like, a problem or even something that needs to be addressed that you're gonna, like, really see it get pushed through legislatively. So I think that's, like, why we've been stuck with dealing with, like, the appointed people, like gensler in offices, because, like, congress just, like, refuses to act, and I don't think they're going to, unfortunately. I think a lot of people want them to. Maybe there'll be a stable coin bill because that seems to be big enough that they care now and it's dollars, but, like, aggregate crypto getting, like, a full, comprehensive, like, markets sort of build. I just don't see it.
00:50:41.246 - 00:51:08.476, Speaker C: There's just not enough, like, people don't care, but it's good. So here's the other thing is, like, candidates pretty much along their, like, age, like, went as you'd expect. So younger candidates were pro, older candidates were against. And, like, that's good because, like, time only works linearly and, like, will only, like, get better in our favor, right? Like, those candidates will get, like, some will retire, though. That doesn't seem to be a thing they do. And some will, like, move into slots, right? So, like, it will sort of get better with time. But it is a little bit of a generational thing.
00:51:08.476 - 00:51:36.074, Speaker C: And I don't know if you can shake that entirely because, like, older candidates that are incumbents, like, they kind of don't listen or care and they don't have to. It doesn't, like, make sense for their voting. So I don't know. That's my take on, like, I would say this. If you want to get involved personally, anyone, you should definitely reach out to your local reps. But also, like, if you ever, like, want to, like, actually, like, give politically, like, give at the local level to, like, your candidates that you, like, want to support or whatever, because, like, that, that's kind of how you get in front of them. Be honest.
00:51:36.074 - 00:51:37.854, Speaker C: It sucks, but, like, that's how it works.
00:51:38.834 - 00:51:56.370, Speaker A: Well, it is. It is what it is. Money makes the world go around. My friend Dan Maciszewski from CMS holdings, thanks for coming back to Galaxy Brains.
