00:00:06.840 - 00:00:10.598, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Digital trading. As always, great to have you here.
00:00:10.686 - 00:00:11.702, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:11.798 - 00:00:12.686, Speaker A: How's it going?
00:00:12.830 - 00:00:44.892, Speaker B: You know, it's going, it's going. Markets have kind of turned a little bit recently. It's been off the back of really exceptionally strong, like us data, PPI employment stuff. And you've also had some pretty hawkish Fed speak, although it's not new. So you've had a repricing in the rate market, and that's kind of caused equities to take a little bit of a break. I think it's totally reasonable. Taking a step back.
00:00:44.892 - 00:01:41.842, Speaker B: I think what has driven a lot of price action this year in many markets has been an incredible degree of short covering, whether it was in crypto or EM equities or nonprofitable tech that had been beaten up. So what you've had happen to start the year is a massive repricing of risk assets as folks got stopped out of things. And to give you an idea, looking at some PB data that we follow, one bank reported they had twelve consecutive days of just insane short covering. It was one of the longest periods like that in their entire history that they kept track of the data. So you had a lot of short covering, and we knew that in crypto at least, there was $500 million in liquidations. Both of those times that crypto really popped up. So a lot of the price action this year has been driven by short covering.
00:01:41.842 - 00:02:13.322, Speaker B: And then you got to a point last week where you had a really aggressive rate move. And so once the short covering is done, you really need marginal buyers to kind of support that market. In every market, and at least in traditional markets, equities kind of lack that marginal buyer in a meaningful way, because as we mentioned earlier, a lot of that buying was driven by short covering and then a little bit of FOMo.
00:02:13.378 - 00:02:14.906, Speaker A: So it's been drifting a little lower.
00:02:14.930 - 00:03:14.528, Speaker B: Over the years, it's been drifting a little lower. And I think that speaks to kind of one of the points I hope we touch on later, which is excess liquidity in the market. I think people totally have a misunderstanding of what that means in today's context, because the difference between excess funds in a 0% interest rate environment and excess liquidity in a 5% interest rate environment is tremendous. In one, you don't get paid to sleep at night. In another, you get paid quite well to sleep super comfortably. And so what that means is every time that a marginal dollar gets deployed in risk assets, it's at the cost of 5% overnight rates. And so even if you have $100 billion of excess liquidity in the market, that 100 billion's earning 5% plus at no risk.
00:03:14.528 - 00:03:45.424, Speaker B: And so I get it. When people talk about there's still tons of cash in the market, the market's awash, people still trying to buy stuff. But don't forget, we're in a 5% overnight interest rate environment. And that's fundamentally different than you're not hunting for yield. You're not forced to go out the risk curve. It used to be that fixed income investors, to get any yield, would have to go so far out the curve, you got to take risk. 710 year duration.
00:03:45.424 - 00:03:51.224, Speaker B: Well, now overnight duration gets you much better yield than that ten year paper.
00:03:51.264 - 00:03:51.856, Speaker A: It's crazy.
00:03:51.960 - 00:04:11.306, Speaker B: And so it is wild. And I think people have a complete misunderstanding of that construct. And what does that mean in actuality? It means that people don't feel like they have to buy the dip in stocks. There's no urgency, or at least the institutional investor doesn't.
00:04:11.410 - 00:04:21.218, Speaker A: So I think one of the reasons you bring this up, too, is that there have been some headlines about some central banks that have been injecting more liquidity. Absolutely. I think people on Twitter have been misinterpreting that.
00:04:21.346 - 00:04:22.494, Speaker B: No, absolutely.
00:04:23.034 - 00:04:23.938, Speaker A: What were those?
00:04:24.066 - 00:05:02.290, Speaker B: There's a difference between actually buying assets in the open market and providing financing for them. For example, the PBOC reverse repo in assets. They provide short term lending versus an asset. Somebody gets cash versus securities, but it's not really a sale, and their balance sheet isn't really going up. A lot of those funds tend to stick in the financial plumbing or the banking system within their respective economy. Japan being another example where they're doing all these emergency bond purchases. And that money is really, it's not going past the japanese banking system.
00:05:02.442 - 00:05:02.730, Speaker A: Right.
00:05:02.762 - 00:05:04.218, Speaker B: So it doesn't filter out in a.
00:05:04.226 - 00:05:05.794, Speaker A: Way that it can support risk assets.
00:05:05.834 - 00:05:19.834, Speaker B: For example, it's less direct than people are thinking versus, like, when the Fed was buying $4 billion of treasuries and mortgage backed assets, like, no, that was a big deal.
00:05:19.914 - 00:05:21.746, Speaker A: Yeah, that was directly in the market.
00:05:21.810 - 00:05:41.820, Speaker B: That was directly in the market, but they were also doing it by providing all these financing lines and facilities, et cetera. But, yeah, it's a different paradigm now. And I think people are constantly misinterpreting it because nobody is used to the idea of higher interest rates.
00:05:41.892 - 00:05:45.108, Speaker A: When was the last time rates were this high? I mean, like decades. Right?
00:05:45.156 - 00:05:46.796, Speaker B: Well, do we even get this high?
00:05:46.980 - 00:05:48.956, Speaker A: Did we get that high in 2000, how high did we.
00:05:48.980 - 00:05:56.656, Speaker B: Yeah, but it's okay, 20 years, though. But it's been a while. It's been a while. But it's also the idea of hire for longer. Right, right.
00:05:56.720 - 00:06:11.352, Speaker A: And that's when you said that the markets are repricing the rates market. That's what they're seeing. That Fed speak, that hawkish fed speak last week has resulted in. I think we were looking at it right. There's now they had been pricing and the market had been pricing in some cuts. By the end of the year, you.
00:06:11.368 - 00:06:14.320, Speaker B: Had about 70 basis points of repricing of cuts.
00:06:14.352 - 00:06:17.804, Speaker A: So we went from what, like cutting 50 to like even still rising.
00:06:18.144 - 00:06:27.728, Speaker B: I don't have it off the top of my head, but more like cutting like 130. And you went to like flat. No, like closer to like 60 or 50 or, you know.
00:06:27.776 - 00:06:31.648, Speaker A: Yeah. So again, higher for longer is being further priced in now.
00:06:31.736 - 00:06:43.124, Speaker B: Yeah. And the reason for it, I mean, Bullard explained it this morning on CNBC, and it's like you have risks of like inflation taking off again.
00:06:43.464 - 00:06:47.272, Speaker A: That is what they don't want. You don't want the seventies to happen where it's like.
00:06:47.328 - 00:06:47.608, Speaker B: Correct.
00:06:47.656 - 00:06:50.128, Speaker A: They raise, then they lower, then inflation happens, they have to raise again.
00:06:50.216 - 00:06:57.862, Speaker B: And then when you think about it in the context of the employment market, the, basically the employment market's like telling you you can do whatever you want.
00:06:57.918 - 00:06:59.102, Speaker A: We can bear more hikes.
00:06:59.158 - 00:07:03.942, Speaker B: We can bear more hikes. So why not do it? Yeah, right. You're not putting the real expenses.
00:07:03.958 - 00:07:04.750, Speaker A: You can always cut.
00:07:04.822 - 00:07:09.614, Speaker B: You can always cut. You're not really putting the labor market at risk by jacking up rates.
00:07:09.654 - 00:07:10.086, Speaker A: Not yet.
00:07:10.150 - 00:07:10.534, Speaker B: Not yet.
00:07:10.574 - 00:07:11.270, Speaker A: They can go higher.
00:07:11.342 - 00:07:42.274, Speaker B: They can. It's just a risk reward decision that the Fed is making. At the same time, you can see housing inventories are up, the interest rate sensitive parts of the economy are reacting appropriately, and there are always unintended consequences to huge monetary policy changes and big ones. And so I definitely think that while I appreciate Bullard's argument that you're not really risking much by jacking up rates.
00:07:42.314 - 00:07:44.134, Speaker A: Really high, something could happen.
00:07:44.754 - 00:07:59.028, Speaker B: Yeah, something could easily happen. You just have to think, like, it's not like a month of high rates will crack the market, but six months of really high rates, a year of really high rates, like you could, I.
00:07:59.036 - 00:08:28.900, Speaker A: Just don't know yet. But you said this before too. Like, you know, when rates are at zero, well, you've got no more tools in your tool belt if you have to stimulate the economy. Right. But if rates are at five, you can cut them back, right? So it's like go high when you can, knowing that if shit starts to break, you can then pull back because you have all this airspace below you. And that seems to be the calculus right now, right? That is the calculus we can bear more. So why not do it and then we'll pull back if we have to.
00:08:28.972 - 00:09:14.334, Speaker B: No, absolutely. But it's just like I keep trying to think about what the end game or what the end status of this looks like. And it's really tough for me to see a scenario where like, everything's going to shit per se, right? Everything that I'm looking at, it's like, you understand the inflation problem we have now is like, it's a good problem to have. The economy is so strong and so robust that it could handle, you know, four or 5% interest rates while making more people employed and while people are getting raises and, you know, generally people are feeling good. Gas prices have been coming off. Like, this is like a very desirable economy.
00:09:14.374 - 00:09:16.678, Speaker A: The economy is doing pretty well, is what you're saying.
00:09:16.846 - 00:09:17.222, Speaker B: Super.
00:09:17.278 - 00:09:28.070, Speaker A: Well, it's not great for investing necessarily right now, but for working and earning and even saving. Better savers market than it's been in decades.
00:09:28.182 - 00:10:08.052, Speaker B: Correct? And so really, I mean, I had a manager once that describes it this way, but it's basically central bank policy for the past three decades, with the exception of last year, has been crucifying the savings base. But historically, you weren't getting compensated to save. Basically led to just a lot more consumption because nobody ever got paid to save. You got paid to invest and putting money in stock markets. But for your average mom, pa putting money into savings, it's been awful. I'll argue with you that it is still awful. You were talking about like somebody was telling me, I actually haven't checked.
00:10:08.068 - 00:10:10.024, Speaker A: Yeah, like the banks aren't passing it through. Right?
00:10:10.604 - 00:10:17.940, Speaker B: Exactly. The savings rate. Interest rates on most, like Ma and PA checking accounts are still like sub 100 basis points.
00:10:18.012 - 00:10:18.460, Speaker A: Crazy.
00:10:18.532 - 00:10:35.184, Speaker B: Even though they're parking at four plus, so they're collecting a huge interest rate margin. I think folks over time will wake up to that and demand, and they will go to treasury direct and buy bills, or they'll move to savings accounts that are much more attractive.
00:10:35.224 - 00:10:37.096, Speaker A: Competition will emerge better.
00:10:37.200 - 00:10:45.784, Speaker B: It will emerge, and I'll give you an example. Treasury direct is one of the most searched things on investopedia this year because everybody's like, oh, wait a minute, I.
00:10:45.784 - 00:11:03.104, Speaker A: Can buy these things right from the government itself. Okay, one more thing. I wanted to bring, I could go all day. I know one more thing I want to bring up before we move on and wrap this up. We've talked about central banks. Augustin Karstens, who is the chief, the head of the bank of international settlements, the BIs.
00:11:03.224 - 00:11:04.448, Speaker B: Rolls off the tongue. Yeah.
00:11:04.496 - 00:11:43.614, Speaker A: Often called the central bankers central bank. He said, there's a headline in Bloomberg, quantification squared, he said crypto lost the battle against fiat currency. He says, quote, the battle has been won. Carson's told Bloomberg TV on an interview Wednesday, a technology doesn't make trusted money. And I will just say when I read this, first of all, I think of, like, superhero movies, there's always a supervillain who's prematurely declaring victory. And to me, when I read this, I think, sir, and he's certainly, I think on economics and monetary stuff, I'm sure he's a lot smarter than I am. But I will say pretty sure bitcoin and crypto has not run its course yet.
00:11:43.914 - 00:11:44.834, Speaker B: No, absolutely.
00:11:44.874 - 00:11:46.698, Speaker A: Seems like you're calling the game a little early there, sir.
00:11:46.746 - 00:12:11.378, Speaker B: No, he's definitely calling the game a little bit, bit early now. But, you know, I definitely respect his point of view from the standpoint of. Okay, like, you know, what are the key things that crypto is trying to accomplish, right. Like instant 24 settlement at all times. Right. That's something that these central banks can get to eventually.
00:12:11.426 - 00:12:13.146, Speaker A: They could do that. They could compete with that.
00:12:13.210 - 00:12:14.254, Speaker B: Oh, absolutely.
00:12:14.594 - 00:12:17.956, Speaker A: We know they can't compete with scarcity in the end.
00:12:18.020 - 00:12:18.900, Speaker B: Yes, scarcity.
00:12:18.972 - 00:12:20.396, Speaker A: They will always print more money.
00:12:20.460 - 00:12:40.772, Speaker B: Exactly. I mean, it's literally in the term economics. Economics is a study of scarcity, essentially. And so, like, yeah, the bitcoin story, that's not over. Yeah, he is, by any means. But could I understand why he's saying that about something like stables? Yes.
00:12:40.908 - 00:12:44.312, Speaker A: I mean, a lot of the world's working on cbdcs. Absolutely.
00:12:44.428 - 00:12:49.264, Speaker B: And it's crazy to think, I mean, the privacy considerations are just so immense.
00:12:49.344 - 00:12:50.032, Speaker A: Enormous.
00:12:50.168 - 00:13:03.816, Speaker B: And money has never, like, been investigated that way or, like, tracking people in real time as they spend. I mean, you have countries that are giving people social scorecards, basically spending. Right.
00:13:03.880 - 00:13:19.296, Speaker A: You can have, like, exploding payments where, like, if you don't spend it in, like, ten days. Yeah, you lose it. Or if you have. Actually, no, it's, that's a, you know what? We're going to do a show on cbdcs at some point, so let's table that. But that is a huge issue. And I, and also for anybody that.
00:13:19.320 - 00:13:21.560, Speaker B: Didn'T check out last week's podcast with Austin Cannon.
00:13:21.592 - 00:13:30.224, Speaker A: With Austin. That guy is a, is a genius in the stable coin world. Yes. Well, Ben, great as always, great to see you, and, and thanks for coming.
