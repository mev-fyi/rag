00:00:01.120 - 00:00:21.314, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. I'm Mike Novogratz, and this is next with Nova. Good afternoon, everybody. I'm here with my friends Cootie and Chica. You guys have never heard of these guys, but I tell you what, by February 14, you certainly will. These guys don't know what's gonna hit them because they're gonna blow up. Especially Cootie.
00:00:21.314 - 00:00:23.474, Speaker A: Cootie's the better looking too.
00:00:24.054 - 00:00:26.638, Speaker B: I don't know about that. She can't get all the girls, man.
00:00:26.686 - 00:00:27.478, Speaker A: I'm just kidding.
00:00:27.566 - 00:00:29.862, Speaker B: He got a girl. Not so no more. He don't get girls.
00:00:29.918 - 00:00:30.534, Speaker C: Sorry about that.
00:00:30.574 - 00:00:47.210, Speaker A: These guys are about to drop. You know the Kanye three part docu series? Netflix. It's gonna start in theaters and then come into Netflix. I saw the first episode. It premiered at Sundance. It was all the buzz. Couldn't be happier to have these guys on.
00:00:47.210 - 00:00:54.922, Speaker A: Could be happy to know them. I met him a couple years ago and just fell in love with these two. So we're gonna learn about them. You know, one's from Chi town and one's from New Orleans.
00:00:54.978 - 00:00:55.850, Speaker B: Yes, sir.
00:00:56.042 - 00:01:04.406, Speaker A: I say one was a college dropout, and. And one was kind of a pretty boy, you know, Risd. Big Brad. Smart, smart guy.
00:01:04.510 - 00:01:05.214, Speaker B: Our guy.
00:01:05.294 - 00:01:11.870, Speaker A: And so I want to hear your stories a little bit before we get to the doc and everything else. So, Cootie, why don't you start? Give us a little bit about growing up.
00:01:11.942 - 00:01:38.354, Speaker B: Well, you said a college dropout. I almost didn't make out of high school by senior year. The semester before graduation, we would go to school, cut that division, go to the liquor store. This is high school. Get drunk at my boy kitty cool house. And that was our day. So when I got straight ups, I'm like, and they said, you're not gonna be able to walk across the stage and you're not going to prom.
00:01:38.354 - 00:01:56.946, Speaker B: I couldn't believe I thought that. What you mean? I got straight up. So they was like, you got to bring your grades up to an a. And when you do that, then you are. Then you can, you know, do it all. So I guess I brought it up to an a because I was able to, you know, walk in and go to prom.
00:01:57.010 - 00:01:58.378, Speaker A: So who'd you take to prom?
00:01:58.546 - 00:02:17.494, Speaker B: I took this girl, Marquita. Yeah, the prom. But I couldn't drive neither. Cause in my neighborhood, it was a stolen block. A stolen car on my block every day in my neighborhood. So as kids, we would just jump in the car, just driving, kicking. And then one time, the police got us and called us and.
00:02:17.494 - 00:02:24.206, Speaker B: And from that point, I couldn't get a license till I was 18. So, you know, she had to my.
00:02:24.230 - 00:02:25.430, Speaker A: Key to drive you to drive.
00:02:25.542 - 00:02:44.214, Speaker B: As soon as we turned the corner, I was whipping. Leaning back as soon as we turned the corner, though. But yeah, it was a trip that. My upbringing with my mother and father, my family was like the Bill Cosby show. I had three sisters, and it was me. I was Theo. Same age.
00:02:44.214 - 00:03:05.448, Speaker B: Same ages and everything. We couldn't believe us watching that. My sister Tanya, me, my sister Denise, five years under me. And my sister Wendy is ten years under me. He's like my mother every time. Every time we joke about it. Every time that we went to school, like kindergarten, she have another baby, so she ain't have to work every five years, though.
00:03:05.448 - 00:03:27.310, Speaker B: But my sister, older than me is two years. But what's crazy, my sister, she was doing radio, tv, and she really pretty. So when I was in high school, I mean, in grammar school, my mother would make me go. Cause she had an after school thing with the radio, tv. So my mother would make me go up there with her to kind of cock block the news, you know. So I'd be up there. But I'm looking at what they doing with the cameras and all.
00:03:27.310 - 00:03:50.654, Speaker B: So they fell in love with me and started, like, mentoring me. So my freshman orientation, I was in there. Like, I already went to the school. Cause they had me working the camera at the orientation, you know. So that alone, I didn't know at the time that I was gonna be a filmmaker. Cause I used to also host the talent shows. I was funny, so I knew I was funny.
00:03:50.654 - 00:04:14.868, Speaker B: And because of radio tv, I was able to do that. Cause we controlled the auditorium and everything that happened at the same mint. And that was my introduction to filmmaking. But then also we had the gang situation, you know, in Chicago. My best friend Matthias, his brother ran a gang called the black gangsters. So we was honorary black gangsters no matter what. Yeah, in Chicago.
00:04:14.868 - 00:04:26.204, Speaker B: So anything happened to us, we always had a gang of people. And of course, his brother KC Capone, who was a preacher now. KC Capone, the preacher, that's interesting.
00:04:26.284 - 00:04:26.820, Speaker C: He got shot.
00:04:26.852 - 00:04:42.664, Speaker B: I'm going to tell you a quick story. He got shot. And after he got shot, he ran in his mother's room. Shot three times, bleeding, about to die. He said, ma, he said, I'm not scared to die, but I don't want to go to hell. And she was like. And they rubbed him to the hospital.
00:04:42.664 - 00:05:00.004, Speaker B: He got to the hospital. He was pronounced dead at the hospital. And he said, obviously, he came back. He said he seen black in the distance. And then when he seen that black, all of a sudden he seen these three figures in the black. He said, pitch black, like he never seen any. He'd seen these three figures.
00:05:00.004 - 00:05:08.204, Speaker B: And he said, next door. No, the figures was right in front of him. And he said, jesus. And he came back to life. K sequence.
00:05:08.284 - 00:05:09.988, Speaker C: Casey Campone. That's crazy.
00:05:10.036 - 00:05:10.972, Speaker B: I never told you that.
00:05:11.068 - 00:05:12.836, Speaker C: I think I remember you telling me that. Yeah.
00:05:12.980 - 00:05:43.474, Speaker B: Yeah. So, I mean, you know, my upbringing was all of that, you know, fights and going to jail and just. It was insane. Then my grandmother passed away, and she passed, and it was like all of a sudden things started going good. I started doing comedy, you know, I started figuring out my way of life. And I was like, why is that? And I'm like, oh, it's because my grandmother's next to God, telling God to look out for me. So I'm like, oh, she not dead.
00:05:43.474 - 00:05:53.616, Speaker B: She didn't die. She right next to God. She didn't have it right now, looking out for me. And that was. And I'm talking about night and day from, from what we were believing in.
00:05:53.640 - 00:05:56.568, Speaker A: Something is pretty damn powerful. Narrative is powerful.
00:05:56.616 - 00:06:15.304, Speaker B: Oh, ain't it, man? Believing in a higher power. Some people call it a universe. I call it Jesus Christ, because you gotta realize, I call it Jesus. Cause my mother introduced me to Jesus as the son of God. I'm the only son in my family, so I'm so. I used to pray to God and kick it with Jesus. And every time something happened, I had a gun in my head pulled off.
00:06:15.304 - 00:06:24.346, Speaker B: It went off when we pulled off. Click. We pull up. Poom. You know, I could have died there. I was like, jesus, thank you. I got hit by a car on my bike.
00:06:24.346 - 00:06:32.574, Speaker B: The tire almost hit my head, like inches from my head. I said, thank you, Jesus. So that's my buddy right there.
00:06:33.474 - 00:06:38.642, Speaker A: My wife always says we're all the son of God for sure. All right, so you grew up in New Orleans?
00:06:38.738 - 00:07:06.540, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I feel like, you know, the story he just told you, there's a lot of similarities with just the neighborhoods that we grew up in. Osmore shelter. My mother sent me to a private school, so there was a lot of things that I wasn't directly involved in, but everything he just talked about was my existence as far as what was around me. And I feel like that's kind of like what we bonded on. We can just bond on. Like, our movement through the streets was so similar as far as what we seen as far as, like, even dealing with the trauma of going through that and hearing gunshots every night.
00:07:06.540 - 00:07:17.614, Speaker C: You know what I mean? But what part of New Orleans? Uptown, third ward. Jackson and Danielle. So I'm, like, literally in between the magnolia and the Calio projects, but it was a notorious drugstore.
00:07:17.654 - 00:07:19.030, Speaker A: That's not the good part of New Orleans for you.
00:07:19.062 - 00:07:36.702, Speaker C: That's not the good part of New Orleans. But I thank God for that journey, because so much of that story, so much of his story is what makes us, I feel so well rounded because we have multiple perspectives of just our experience in life.
00:07:36.878 - 00:07:38.394, Speaker A: How did you get into RISD?
00:07:39.454 - 00:08:10.692, Speaker C: This is funny, because I was like any other typical kid from my neighborhood. I wanted to play in the NBA, and I really held onto that dream until my senior year in college in order to play sports. My mother saw I was talented in art from an early age, so she'd make me go to art camp every summer in order to continue to play basketball. And I'm so thankful she did that, because it was my senior year, and I ended up playing AAU. And I remember, you know, I thought I was the shell. I was the captain of my team. And I just like, you know, I thought I was going to college and everything, playing ball.
00:08:10.692 - 00:08:49.600, Speaker C: I step onto that court on the AAU team, and I was like, where did they come? These kids are my height, dunking, doing vertical. I'm like, what? So, like, I'm, like, going from starting to, like, I was the last man off the bench on this team. And I remember the coach telling me, like, you know, they were going to travel for the summer at the national tournament. Tournament. And I had gotten into the. My mother was telling me about this art program at RISD where I can get college credit, and my coach, the guy, he kept, the only person that really kept it that honest with me, he was like, he's like, man, you're not like, you might make d three. Like, you might be able to play d three, you know what I'm saying? So he was like, I was like, you probably just should go to the.
00:08:49.600 - 00:09:07.154, Speaker C: And I went to the RISD. Cause I got in, and it changed my life. And that's actually when I realized, you know, I just took. My mother said I was talented art. I just like, okay, okay. That's the first time I could see it because it was against other really good artists, and I could hang with them different than I was hanging with the cats on the court, you know what I'm saying?
00:09:07.194 - 00:09:11.842, Speaker A: What a different world coming from, like, the hood to literally risd, where you've.
00:09:11.858 - 00:09:15.258, Speaker C: Got this creative, like, right by brown. You know what I'm saying?
00:09:15.426 - 00:09:23.562, Speaker B: Chiggae skipped out a whole thing that his mother's an angel. So when he was little, he did come from the hood, but his mother. Tell him about your schooling.
00:09:23.618 - 00:09:41.020, Speaker C: Yeah. So my mother put me into this. I was like, probably, like, they need to integrate the school, basically. And so she sent me to St. Martin's, like, private school, 20 minutes out of my neighborhood. Because where the neighborhood I was from, it's zoning. So if she put me in a public school, only be able to go to certain schools.
00:09:41.020 - 00:10:08.104, Speaker C: And it's just a testament to, like, the education system, but it's also a testament to the problem of systemic racism in a sense that, like, I was an anomaly. My mother gave me this opportunity, but there's so many kids in my neighborhood that didn't. And they would have excelled if they did. You know what I'm saying? So if they would have just been afforded that type of education, that would give them a certain type of exposure to see life differently. So I just saw, like. I mean, I went to school with Allie Copeland. She was Al Copeland's daughter.
00:10:08.104 - 00:10:11.952, Speaker C: They own Popeye. She'd get dropped off the school in a limousine. Like, we're having fried chicken at her.
00:10:12.008 - 00:10:16.324, Speaker A: Like, we're both jangles. We're more bojangles. But we do. Like.
00:10:17.834 - 00:10:24.442, Speaker C: But to see that as a kid early, I mean, you can obtain this, like, on my block. The other kids didn't see that. You know what I mean? So.
00:10:24.538 - 00:10:33.938, Speaker A: Yeah, no, that. Trust me, there's probably an equal distribution of intelligence and talent, and there's certainly not an equal distribution of opportunity.
00:10:33.986 - 00:10:36.250, Speaker C: 100%. That's exactly. You just nailed it. Yeah.
00:10:36.322 - 00:10:37.774, Speaker A: So, you guys, how'd you meet?
00:10:38.354 - 00:10:46.198, Speaker B: Oh, man. Well, of course I followed Kanye here, documenting him, because I know, I knew.
00:10:46.246 - 00:10:47.158, Speaker A: I'm gonna get to that piece in.
00:10:47.166 - 00:10:48.086, Speaker B: A second for sure.
00:10:48.190 - 00:10:50.294, Speaker A: I just wanna have, like, when did you guys finally meet?
00:10:50.374 - 00:10:53.022, Speaker B: It was at MTV. They wanted to do to you here first.
00:10:53.078 - 00:11:31.754, Speaker A: Oh, when you were with Kanye. All right, well, let's step back. So I don't wanna. I want people to watch the movie. And you guys do such a great job in this movie of not just telling Kanye's story, but telling your story, which is in some ways just as cool. I mean, Kanye's pretty damn cool, but the courage to kind of trust yourself to say, hey, I'm gonna give up my career as a comedian and chase this guy and follow him and be part of this journey of his, because I know something special is going on. How did that.
00:11:31.754 - 00:11:34.758, Speaker A: You know, that's ballsy.
00:11:34.886 - 00:11:47.266, Speaker B: Well, I bring it back to Jesus, to God. You know, it was. When I seen him, I just felt like. I just felt that I knew. I seen the vision. I seen exactly. I seen the hoop dreams.
00:11:47.266 - 00:11:59.778, Speaker B: I'm like, I'm gonna do that. Yay. And then, actually, I didn't. It didn't happen quite so easy because. Only reason why I got to move to New York. Cause I just bought a condo. I just got married.
00:11:59.778 - 00:12:17.424, Speaker B: I bought a condo. I had bought a car. And then I come back. I actually was gonna do a documentary on Michael Jordan coming back to the NBA. Cause I heard from his nephew coming back, and I'm like, oh, I'm gonna do a doc on that. So I went to Miami and filmed all of these. I filmed, like, magic Johnson.
00:12:17.424 - 00:12:47.586, Speaker B: It was memorial Weekend, miami, 2001. Everybody used to. Everybody was still going to Cancun, but this year, like, puff J. Lo, Magic Johnson. Everybody was at Memorial weekend. So I'm like, bet I'm gonna interview these people and just say, what would it be like if Michael Jordan came back to NBA? So I got in front of Maggie Johnson. The way we was getting in place is cause we had the source mic, because channel zero, my show, and source, fell in love with us, so they had us doing stuff with them.
00:12:47.586 - 00:12:52.986, Speaker B: So we had just the source thing on the mic. We put it on there. Yo, we with the source.
00:12:53.050 - 00:12:53.666, Speaker C: Oh, come on.
00:12:53.690 - 00:13:11.302, Speaker B: So we interplay. So I'm interviewing magic Johnson. What you think? I interviewed the brothers. What's up? Them? Dude, that was popular. I interviewed them, interview a bunch of NBA players. And then I be, like, filming stuff. So I remember me and Deion Cole, a good friend of mine, comedian.
00:13:11.302 - 00:13:45.580, Speaker B: We on stage, and biz. Markey's djing, Jermaine Dupri is on the mic. And while I'm on stage, all of a sudden, somebody come up and grab the mic and start freestyling. I turn the camera, is Jay Z freestyling? I'm right here. Freestyling. Right? So then, okay, long story short, I come back to Chicago, and I'm driving, and I come off on North Avenue with my car, and next thing I know, my door opens up, and there's a dude with a ski mask on and a nine millimeter to my head, like, give me that money. And I'm like, what money? He's like, you better give me that money.
00:13:45.580 - 00:13:56.456, Speaker B: I'm gonna kill you. So I reached in my pocket. So I'm like, he had to know me. Cause I could've been reaching for something. Boom. But I reached in my pocket and grabbed, like, $25. Like, here, you want the money? Here.
00:13:56.456 - 00:14:18.008, Speaker B: Threw that on the ground, snatched my chain off, threw it on the ground, grabbed my phone, threw it on the ground. And then he was like, you give me that money, I'm gonna kill you right now. So I was like, man, if you can find the money, just let me out the car. You find the money, it's yours. You know, my camera was in there. All that footage was in there. And I got out the car, and I just knew he was gonna shoot me, too, just for fun.
00:14:18.008 - 00:14:37.640, Speaker B: It was a car blocking me in the back, too. So I knew somebody. So I'm dodging bullets, and no bullets was coming. And because of that conduct. Cause my home insurance, that money that they gave me, they was like, we insure everything that was in the car. So they gave me the money for the camera, all the stuff, my chain, everything. I took that money, and I moved to.
00:14:37.672 - 00:14:39.084, Speaker A: You lost all the footage, though.
00:14:41.624 - 00:14:50.166, Speaker B: Deion said. I said, deion, man, I just got car jacked. He like, yeah. I said, man, they took the car. They took my camera. He said. I said.
00:14:50.166 - 00:15:00.634, Speaker B: He said. And I said, they got the footage. He said, they got the footage. I said, yeah, man, they hit me in the head, man. You know, busting my head and everything, you know. He was like, all the footage.
00:15:00.934 - 00:15:04.070, Speaker A: I was like, JT Freestyle. Yeah.
00:15:04.102 - 00:15:05.830, Speaker B: Oh, man. So di co.
00:15:05.902 - 00:15:08.470, Speaker A: But so there went the Michael Jordan doc.
00:15:08.542 - 00:15:21.474, Speaker B: Yeah, there wasn't. But, hey, you know, and that gave me the money to really get on the Kanye doc. So, you know, it's like everything happened for a reason, man. And I called that carjack angel pretty much. You know what I mean?
00:15:21.554 - 00:15:21.882, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:21.938 - 00:15:29.522, Speaker B: If it wasn't for him, I probably would have just stayed doing comedy and doing my parties that I was doing in, you know, in Chicago.
00:15:29.578 - 00:15:40.994, Speaker A: But what I'm guessing here, the fact that you've got such a big personality and likable face allowed you to kind of. And your suite allowed you to get in places with your camera, and people don't say, get the fuck out of here.
00:15:41.034 - 00:15:41.186, Speaker C: Right?
00:15:41.210 - 00:15:52.654, Speaker A: Like, you know, just showing up. Because it's interesting you guys will watch the doc. And it's interesting how you guys are just showing up in places, you know, camera in your face. And no one really seemed to get pissed at you?
00:15:52.694 - 00:16:06.318, Speaker B: No. It wasn't popular then, either. Nobody had a camera. So they looked. They look at us like, why you filming Kanye? Cause channel Zero was huge at the time. We was filming Butane and RZA, Snoop, and just everybody met them.
00:16:06.366 - 00:16:23.842, Speaker A: One of the fun parts of that movie is that first hour when you're showing all those old channel zero clips, and. And it's like all these rappers that we all know and love, and you're seeing them 20 years ago, and it feels like a century ago, right? You know, and all these young kids in hip hop, the crazy thing.
00:16:23.858 - 00:16:59.350, Speaker C: And I tell people, because certain things, stuff that didn't make the cut, like this footage of Cootie filming method man, you know, and you get to realize, man, method man really took to Cootie, to the point to where, like, it felt like method man was like, man, come film. You know what I mean? And thinking of all the people that Coodie was filming in that era that was way more successful at that time than Kanye. It's just something that he decided to, like, not go and hedge his bets better with, like, oh, well, these people are more established. You know what I mean? He just stuck with the intuition, intuitiveness to stick with Cootie. I mean, with Kanye is amazing to me.
00:16:59.422 - 00:17:03.878, Speaker A: You know, that is interesting. You know, our boy Dave loves method man. He just loves method man.
00:17:03.926 - 00:17:19.363, Speaker B: I mean, yeah, we cut out that scene, though, that was actually in the def jam office, and met the man. See me, and he, like, come to the office. I came and we, you know, smoking and kicking it out, filming. We took it out, though. Cause it didn't move the story forward. But, yeah, method. That's our guy right there.
00:17:19.863 - 00:17:24.759, Speaker A: So you guys met at MTV. That was 2015, years ago, probably, right?
00:17:24.831 - 00:17:25.199, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:17:25.271 - 00:17:27.199, Speaker A: And you started deciding to do stuff together.
00:17:27.311 - 00:17:28.043, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:17:29.303 - 00:17:31.243, Speaker A: The Kanye thing was in the background.
00:17:31.863 - 00:17:33.119, Speaker B: Yeah, the doc.
00:17:33.231 - 00:17:33.977, Speaker A: The doc.
00:17:34.095 - 00:17:50.486, Speaker C: He had already been moving on it, and we didn't really. We didn't really. We were just kicking it at first for, like, a year, and then he finally showed me channel zero. That's when I saw it for the first time. And, like, going to art school, obviously. I looked at it, and I was like, this shit, it was so raw, but the storytelling was so dope. Like, it was witty.
00:17:50.486 - 00:18:13.044, Speaker C: I was like, this shit is crazy. And that's when we started talking about film. And we were, like, finishing each other's sentences, so we were getting hype. Like, we see it the same way, and, you know, then taking just, like, all the stuff we wanted to do, and it was like. It just made sense. And the funny part is, I actually had a full on company at MTV. Like, me and my friends at MTV, we had started our own company and HBO, Snoop.
00:18:13.044 - 00:18:33.668, Speaker C: So it was a bunch of us had a company together. And I remember I was like, we started working on. So I get a call from Cootie. He had gone. Kanye got in a car accident. He goes to LA to be with him, and I get a call, and Cootie's like, man, we got this idea for this music video. My whole reason why I'm even at MTV was because I want to do music videos.
00:18:33.668 - 00:18:47.228, Speaker C: I was just waiting for the right opportunity and the right artist. And so he calls, and he's like, you know, we don't have no money. But I'm like, I'm with it. I was familiar with Kanye as a producer, so I already knew how dope he was. And then I heard the tracks. I was like, this shit is crazy. You know what I mean? I'm like, I'm in.
00:18:47.228 - 00:19:05.522, Speaker C: Count me in. And then I had all the resources at MTV to do what we needed to do. So we got busy on that. But I'm at this company, and so our company's called camp. And everything we kind of do is, like, as a collective. But I'm seeing Cootie, and I'm like, man, you need to get down with us. And he was with it, but he's like, man, if I get down, I was like, I can't come on.
00:19:05.522 - 00:19:18.258, Speaker C: Cause we had a little hierarchy. He was like, I need to be at the top. But, y'all, I gotta be your own. Yeah, I gotta be so I'm like. I'm like, you know, I seen the. I'm like, yeah. So I go to talk to my partners, and they just didn't see it the same way.
00:19:18.258 - 00:19:30.590, Speaker C: And I was like, damn. Like, I'm telling y'all, man. So then I gave them the alt. I was like, well, either we bringing Cootie on, oh, I'm rocking with Cootie. You know what I'm saying? And we started rocking out from that. That's a good shit.
00:19:30.662 - 00:19:33.006, Speaker B: When he quit MTV, I was like.
00:19:33.190 - 00:19:36.354, Speaker A: I'm like, you got no money in your pocket.
00:19:36.734 - 00:19:38.782, Speaker C: He had a good job, man.
00:19:38.838 - 00:19:41.394, Speaker B: I was like, oh, we really gotta grind.
00:19:41.694 - 00:19:44.862, Speaker A: So what was your first project together through the wires?
00:19:44.878 - 00:20:12.722, Speaker C: Our first project together, yeah. And it was so it's like full circle, right? Because through the wire was all the documentary footage that he had shot up until that point. And I remember he came to the office with this rough cut. It was just documentary footage. Then we had, you know, figured out how to make it into, like, put it into Polaroids and whatnot. But to just now come full circle and to see that imagined over x amount of years after that, you know what I mean, is pretty amazing.
00:20:12.898 - 00:20:16.462, Speaker A: And how'd the Stefan Marbury show up?
00:20:16.578 - 00:20:50.914, Speaker C: So, you know, we met staff first. Yeah, we met him at the same time. We didn't really, actually, it was so funny. Cause it wasn't even a doc we really were trying to do, but we had just done a doc with bet on Martin Luther King and Jason Samuels, who was the EP of that at BEt, called us up and he was like, you know, I'm partnering with Nina Bon Jovi on this project, and I think you guys would be perfect, but I've sold you guys on her. She just wants to talk to you guys. And she told us, and, you know, she's partners with Forrest Whitaker. We're trying to get into the movie stuff, so we're thinking about, well, man, it could be a good, you know what I mean?
00:20:50.954 - 00:20:52.586, Speaker B: And she discovered Ryan Cooper.
00:20:52.690 - 00:20:53.290, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:20:53.442 - 00:20:58.694, Speaker B: Station out of door. He was like, okay, we don't know Steph. We're going to figure it out.
00:20:59.194 - 00:21:08.626, Speaker C: And so then she was sold on us. She's like, well, y'all need to meet Steph, though. Cause he's kind of. You don't trust anybody. And so we're like, okay, yeah, of course. So we meet him at this. I can't remember what hotel.
00:21:08.626 - 00:21:28.906, Speaker C: I think it was the London. And we sat down and we just all hit it off. Like, we all bonded off of just similar. Like, we all had just lost our fathers. We all were close in age, and it was just like an instant connection. And he was like, oh, he's like, I fuck with you guys. To the point to where he trusted us so much that when we finished the doc, the first time he saw the doc was at the film festival at Tribeca.
00:21:28.906 - 00:21:30.242, Speaker C: Film festival. Yeah.
00:21:30.298 - 00:21:31.506, Speaker A: That takes a lot of courage for.
00:21:31.530 - 00:21:33.774, Speaker C: Somebody that doesn't trust anybody, you know what I'm saying?
00:21:34.234 - 00:21:41.600, Speaker A: But that's a crazy story, too. Ended up in China. I mean, like, who would have ever thought? Kid from Staten Island, China, and like a hero.
00:21:41.752 - 00:21:44.944, Speaker C: And he still loves, he's still there coaching. Coaching, yeah.
00:21:45.024 - 00:21:50.160, Speaker B: Yeah. But he real spiritual, Stephan, a real spiritual person, too. I think that was our bond.
00:21:50.232 - 00:21:51.164, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure.
00:21:51.624 - 00:22:13.644, Speaker B: My thing is that, you know, we never die. We never die. We just leave this body. But our spirits live forever, and our spirits actually help guide us to different places. So I think, like, chike father, my father and his father said, okay, y'all come together on a project, and they put us together, and that's why we did it. And it was, like, in the thing, too. I always say it's Jesus direct.
00:22:13.644 - 00:22:34.648, Speaker B: Cause that's my nickname to God. It's Jesus who I believe in. And he just made that project happen. It was like his father's spirit. Our father's spirit was there, but it was like, things you just can't write. You can't write certain things. Like the little guy, the guy at the end, xavier, had the same name as Stephan, middle name.
00:22:34.648 - 00:22:56.404, Speaker B: And we talking about, you know, he like, you could be the president of the United States. And he like, I didn't know that. And then fast forward that. The next doc, we do with the same crew, Jason Harper, our editors, and Max. And Max Altman, we do the same. We move right from that doc to this doc. And at the end of this doc, it's Kanye running for president.
00:22:56.404 - 00:23:11.994, Speaker B: Wait a minute, hold on. God, you gotta be acting up sometimes. He be like, I'm gonna show off. I'ma show y'all for real. What's real? To the point that just recently, I'm going. J ivey got nominated for a Grammy. I'm in LA.
00:23:11.994 - 00:23:30.728, Speaker B: I mean, we get our tickets. Cause we gonna celebrate with J Ivey. We gonna go to Sundance. After Sundance, we gonna go to LA and kick it. So I had my hotel room a month and a half ago when we first found out, pretty much, he got nominated. And long story short is he. We go, I'm like, I was going to council, and council, they canceled.
00:23:30.728 - 00:23:52.036, Speaker B: I mean, they did Sundance remote. Then they canceled the Grammys and moved it. Moved the Grammys. So I'm like, dang, I should cancel this hotel last week. And I'm like, you know what? I might as well just go to LA. Why not? So I, like, booked my ticket, and then I'm looking at something and I'm like, wait a minute. Kanye was.
00:23:52.036 - 00:24:01.172, Speaker B: Oh, he insulted that. That fan at the Soho house. I'm like, that's why I'm a stay. I might. It might be big. I said. I told my girl Ray shell.
00:24:01.172 - 00:24:26.980, Speaker B: I'm like, yo, it might be big. And then me just taking some of these meetings that we had set up, you know, I was like, I was gonna do that and just hang out and just get some warmth. It was about the snow here. I'm like, I'm out, but I'm like, it's bigger. So then I get there and come to find out Kanye and future rented out the fifth floor. So they there. I'm like, God, why you showing out? So now we under the same roof.
00:24:26.980 - 00:24:49.798, Speaker B: And then Ivan, who cut Kanye hair to this day, ayman was like, man, I ain't see the first movie. I'm like, oh, come through, aydman, come through. Don C. Like, where y'all at? We at the thing. So Don c come through. Ice cream, come through. Then Danny Sorge, channel zero, the creator, channel Zero, who played Jesus, and Jesus walk, is in, got a girlfriend in LA.
00:24:49.798 - 00:25:06.326, Speaker B: So he out there. So he come through. And Woody White, who put Kanye in his first advertisement, he there. And then Deion Cole later come and J Ivey, when J ivey seen us hiking, Jay was like, I'm about to get a ticket. So he flew back out. He had no room. Cause they bought out the whole hotel.
00:25:06.326 - 00:25:14.514, Speaker B: I wouldn't have had a room if I would have canceled for one day. I would have canceled. It had been booked. They definitely would have got my room. I had the big room.
00:25:16.654 - 00:25:17.150, Speaker C: So they.
00:25:17.182 - 00:25:36.918, Speaker B: Definitely would have got my room. But it was just magic. And then next thing I know, running to Kanye, of course, he said as soon as he got off the elevator, he seen me. He said, you ain't telling me you was here. He said, something told me to come upstairs. And I said, man, something told me to come here. And that was magic, man.
00:25:36.918 - 00:25:40.856, Speaker B: That was God. Like, yo, you know, bring it together and everything's gonna be good.
00:25:40.920 - 00:26:03.964, Speaker A: I think he's gonna love this. I mean, at least I saw the first episode. But if I was Kanye, I'd love the first episode. You take him on a journey. Well, he takes us on a journey, and you document it. It's interesting. Cause I've met him later in life, and he's very sweet, but you can certainly tell he struggles, struggles with some demons and got some mental health issues in that early.
00:26:03.964 - 00:26:29.592, Speaker A: Those early shots of Kanye, you're just on his side, you're cheering for him. There's no but. There's just a yes. And so was it painful to watch that? Was it. I mean, explain that journey for you. Here's this kid you love, you still love, who blew up bigger than life and struggles still, but didn't back then.
00:26:29.708 - 00:27:03.528, Speaker B: Yeah, well, you know, his mother always kept me around when he started blowing up. You know what I mean? Like, you know, of course, as a rapper, you have aspirations and dreams of working with, you know, Pike Williams and these big directors and doing, you know, everything that most rappers do. So you're like, I gotta get the shame. I gotta get this, you know, the things that make sense for, you know, your dreams that you, you know, as you in your basement, you're thinking about, oh, I'm gonna have this big house. I'm gonna have this. I'm working hype. So he started, people started pulling him in that direction.
00:27:03.528 - 00:27:34.098, Speaker B: And, you know, of course it's not what he wanted to do, but his mom would keep me around, so when she made her transition, it really went, he really went off, and I didn't see him. So now I'm just, like, watching, you know, the Taylor Swift, and I'm like, damn, you know, I might like, you know, he didn't have to do that. Whatever my thought was, you know, but then I'm like, you know, well, you know, that's him. And I guess that's the role he want to play in the. He's getting his publicity. And Kanye used to say, all publicity, good publicity. So I'm like, okay, he's doing it.
00:27:34.098 - 00:28:08.528, Speaker B: And then I see him do all this other stuff, and then I, you know, as I'm watching this six years and he blowing up, he, like, bigger than life. So I'm starting like, do I know this dude? That's why in the three, when we, when common brought us back together, so. And this is the amazing story as well. And I want to just give some of these stories just cause you understand. So common father passed away. So when common father passed away, I was like, man, I wish I can call him and say, get my condolences, you know, I still have my father at the time. And I'm talking about the next day.
00:28:08.528 - 00:28:10.496, Speaker B: Common calls me the next day.
00:28:10.520 - 00:28:11.032, Speaker A: Wow.
00:28:11.168 - 00:28:14.736, Speaker B: And I'm like, I said, yo, man. I said, your father passed, man. I'm so sorry.
00:28:14.760 - 00:28:15.048, Speaker C: He had it.
00:28:15.056 - 00:28:30.720, Speaker B: He's like, oh, man. Yeah, he passed last week. I'm like, oh, I just found out, man, you know, my condolences. Then he was like, he was like, yo, I want you to come, you know, film the odd fest for me. Document this first festival he did in Chicago. And I'm like, oh, word. I wanted to go anywhere.
00:28:30.720 - 00:28:50.398, Speaker B: Cause I heard about it, and I heard on the low that Kanye was gonna be there, so I was gonna figure out my way there, but he called me. So I wind up going and documenting. Then that's when me and Kanye reconnected. In six years, pretty much. I seen him twice, like, walking on the street with animal Rose. Hey, how you doing? We going? Like, I get your Sunday blessings. I was, oh, boy, perfect.
00:28:50.398 - 00:29:14.172, Speaker B: And then another time after that, that we had no real interaction. But when he did that, the eye fest was the last time that I seen my father alive physically. Cause of common, you know? And then, like I say, we. Me and Kanye reconnected. And that's all in the dock when you get to that, to that point. But it's just like. It's just funny how it's amazing how everything happened for a reason.
00:29:14.172 - 00:29:38.416, Speaker B: So that right there. And another quick story is that I did my father. So the hardest things I ever had to do was Mama West's funeral piece and my father's funeral piece. Of course, now I'm looking at all this footage, but it's so therapeutic, too, because I'm like, yo, my father. I can hear my father. I can see what right here. I can always just go to this tape and hear him and see him.
00:29:38.416 - 00:30:00.744, Speaker B: So that. But then when I was looking for records, I'm like, what can I put on my father? And he had, like, six records in this little hi fi thing he had. And I pulled it out, and I'm like, oh, Marvin Gaye. So I'm looking through. I'm like, oh, God is love. Okay, let me get God is love. So I go to apple music and like, God is love? So I got God is love.
00:30:00.744 - 00:30:23.900, Speaker B: Put that on my father's funeral piece. So then about six months later, comic comes to Harlem, and he's on stage rapping, and he's telling his whole story. And then all of a sudden, he's like, hey, if y'all know this song, sing with me. If you don't, then there's clap, right? And I ain't know the song, so I'm clapping. And he was like, there you go. Cootie gave me a shout out, like, oh, shoot. Word.
00:30:23.900 - 00:30:37.568, Speaker B: There you go, Cootie. And right after he said that, they played God is love by Marvin Gaye. She started singing. I was like, yo, that's why I thought it's so and so. I just be wanting to share that. And we get to.
00:30:37.656 - 00:30:40.564, Speaker C: You're connected. You're, like, connected 100%.
00:30:41.584 - 00:30:52.856, Speaker B: We get to Dr. When I met you. Oh, my good. You don't even understand. You were with Dave. I'm like, God is so good. I couldn't believe that Dave walked in there.
00:30:52.856 - 00:31:00.484, Speaker B: Cause I didn't know you at the time. And they, like, on the owner of the house coming, and then they come, Dave, behind you. I'm like, Dave, like, Cooney. Oh, my.
00:31:00.776 - 00:31:00.912, Speaker C: Cody did.
00:31:00.928 - 00:31:06.484, Speaker B: The kid went God to the screen with Kanye, said, look at God.
00:31:07.624 - 00:31:14.084, Speaker A: I think I might become most famous for that house. I've been the Kanye doc and not what a house is.
00:31:15.704 - 00:31:28.542, Speaker B: Yeah. They didn't know that. When they see this, I'm happy to be talking about it. Or not. Cause they don't know how good people y'all are. Cause they look at it like, who's these dudes with Kanye? They probably try to. You know, they don't know.
00:31:28.542 - 00:31:42.582, Speaker B: Y'all are really, really great people. You know, they just see Kae snapping out at the time. But, man, it was a blessing when y'all walked in that house. That's when everything changed when y'all walked. Cause it was a trip before then, you know?
00:31:42.758 - 00:31:49.314, Speaker A: So are you ready for all your ex girlfriends to now who's gonna see you on the big screen? Is he calling you up?
00:31:51.454 - 00:31:55.044, Speaker B: They've been doing that since Benji. Yeah.
00:31:55.744 - 00:31:58.164, Speaker A: All right. We already got that taken.
00:31:58.504 - 00:31:59.512, Speaker B: They've been through that.
00:31:59.568 - 00:31:59.992, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:32:00.088 - 00:32:27.332, Speaker A: Well, this is gonna be for both of you, I think. Just a joyous six months. I mean, I. You know, I've only seen the first episode, but I think about when that Jordan dot came out and the whole country watched it, and I have to think, this is gonna be that times two, you know, Kanye's in his moment that he is. It's such a compelling story. You guys did an amazing job telling it. And so my only advice, not that I'm supposed to give advice, you got great advice.
00:32:27.332 - 00:32:29.796, Speaker A: Enjoy the goddamn ride. Cause it's gonna be a lot of fun.
00:32:29.860 - 00:32:30.668, Speaker B: Yes, sir.
00:32:30.836 - 00:32:55.694, Speaker A: And you guys, you guys know who you are already, so you're not gonna get carried away. But really enjoy the ride. It should be fun. You know, I'm crossing my fingers. I got great predictions on the oscars, and, you know, you guys, at least you should win. If not, I'm gonna go smash somebody, then next, then you got a whole frickin. You know, this is the great thing about having.
00:32:55.694 - 00:33:06.786, Speaker A: I think this is gonna be kind of the jump step in success, is that the world's gonna be your oyster to figure out, are you gonna make more docs or feature or any work?
00:33:06.930 - 00:33:33.116, Speaker C: That's what I think people we're excited about is, like, people don't realize, I think, how long. No, people put it together. We've been grinding for a long time. And people can put together from that music video era to creative control, to all our docs, and people don't realize we're the same person doing all this. But even through all that, all the stuff that didn't make it, all that, all the stuff we have in development. Like, finally we can start to realize that stuff, you know what I mean? So, yeah, that's the beginning for us.
00:33:33.260 - 00:33:43.472, Speaker A: I'm gonna have a fun time watching and cheering you on, because, you know, I've seen every once in a while, someone makes that jump step, and then, you know, you got the chance to do bigger things.
00:33:43.528 - 00:33:44.152, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:44.328 - 00:33:46.164, Speaker B: But you could be a part of it, too.
00:33:47.064 - 00:33:49.760, Speaker A: I'm a good executive producer. I realize this.
00:33:49.792 - 00:33:50.576, Speaker C: Holy shit.
00:33:50.720 - 00:33:53.944, Speaker A: The whole executive producer thing is kind of a croc, you know, it's investor.
00:33:53.984 - 00:33:59.496, Speaker C: You're one of the most humbled executive producers I know, though, because you got. You got heat behind you. You know what I'm saying? So people need to know.
00:33:59.520 - 00:34:06.644, Speaker B: People don't notice you behind birth of a nation, right? That was a powerful movie. We all should have went up like.
00:34:09.464 - 00:34:10.752, Speaker A: Birth of a nation make you cry.
00:34:10.808 - 00:34:12.126, Speaker C: It's a hard movie to watch.
00:34:12.280 - 00:34:13.014, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:13.474 - 00:34:21.506, Speaker A: Nate Parker's still my. If I've learned anything about, you know, black America, it's all through Nate Parker. He's been my mentor.
00:34:21.690 - 00:34:23.294, Speaker B: He doesn't graduate.
00:34:25.114 - 00:34:30.826, Speaker A: He's the real guy. And then last year, I was executive producer of two distant strangers.
00:34:30.890 - 00:34:31.250, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:34:31.322 - 00:34:35.522, Speaker A: Which was. I didn't really do a lot of them give money, but. But it won the oscar.
00:34:35.578 - 00:34:36.002, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:34:36.098 - 00:34:37.098, Speaker A: That's a badass movie.
00:34:37.146 - 00:34:39.086, Speaker C: Yeah. And so you know how to pick them, man.
