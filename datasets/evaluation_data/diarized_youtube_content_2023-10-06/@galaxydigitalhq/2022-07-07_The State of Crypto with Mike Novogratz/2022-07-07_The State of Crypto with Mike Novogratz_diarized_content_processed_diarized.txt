00:00:01.160 - 00:00:42.544, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. I'm Mike Novogratz, and this is next with Novo. All right, friends, another episode of next with Novo. And today, actually, Novo's the guest. I'm kind of kidding around about that. I've got my head of research, Alex Thorne, who is a deep in the weeds crypto enthusiast, and we decided we'd have a conversation trying to help decipher the state of the world here in the crypto sphere. It has been a brutal few months, and so I'm going to pass it to Alex to kind of run the conversation and try to shed as much light as we can.
00:00:43.564 - 00:01:18.260, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks, Mike. Thanks for having me on. I think we're calling the segment the state of the union, maybe the state of our markets. I think it'll be a good, quick conversation on sort of where we are in a market cycle, how macro and crypto are interacting. And I just want to kick it right off with the first question, which is, from your perspective, you're a longtime investor and builder and a longtime follower of markets. Can you set the backdrop for what markets look like for us today, just broadly speaking? I mean, even outside of crypto? And where is all this pressure coming from?
00:01:18.332 - 00:01:58.644, Speaker A: Yeah, I was being interviewed, and I started singing from beauty and the beast. Tale as old as time. I wish I had a better voice. This is a tale as old as time. We had a asset bubble fueled by the Fed. And if you were Shopify or Zoom or Spotify or you name it, any growth stock peloton, people jumped on the story, and there was a speculative maniac. The same happened in luxury watches, in baseball cards, basketball cards, and in crypto.
00:01:58.644 - 00:02:50.674, Speaker A: And bitcoin, as the lead horse traded as high as 69,000. But lots of other cryptos took off. And I remember when COVID started, I said, oh, it's a perfect tailwind for crypto because you've got bitcoin as this unique digital asset, 21 million bitcoins, and it is a perfect salve to printing money. Right? Bitcoin is a hard money ethos that was based on Satoshi's fear of populism. And we had populism pay for everything. And I thought we also had the digitalization of everything, right? Microsoft CEO famously said, we were doing more in four months than we thought we'd do in two years, something of that. And so the stories were really powerful, and people bought in, and it became a self fulfilling prophecy.
00:02:50.674 - 00:03:21.694, Speaker A: And so when the Fed got hawkish, when Powell finally got reappointed, Ray Powell stayed dovish far longer than he should have. Wanting to get reappointed. Human frailties, I guess, or foibles. Right. You know, people love to hold on to power. And then he decided he needed to save his reputation and needed to save the economy from raging inflation and got very hawkish. We have an inflation problem in the US and abroad.
00:03:21.694 - 00:04:00.514, Speaker A: It's starting to crack. But as he was removing liquidity from the markets, all assets started to fall. Nasdaq, gross stock, stock, and crypto started to fall. I, this whole year thought crypto could. Our bitcoin could hold a 30,000, 50,000 range. And where I say totals. Oldest time, when we got down to 30,001st because of the UST that caused credit, we had this collapse from 30,000 to 19,000, where we are today.
00:04:00.514 - 00:04:38.470, Speaker A: And that was the tale. As old as time, is that the CFI players in crypto, Celsius, Blockfi, three arrows, Genesis, big balance sheets, had taken far more leverage than I think people understood. And you had a credit crises, and that credit crises impacted every player, the good, the bad, and the ugly. And it dented confidence. I got a call yesterday from a wrestling friend who had lost lots of money in crypto, and then was like, but you know, all my coins are at Celsius. I'll get my coins back. When I.
00:04:38.470 - 00:05:12.060, Speaker A: And I was like, I'm not positive, but my gut feeling is you'll get nothing back for the next three years, and then you'll get $20 to $0.30 on the dollar back. And that's where we are today. We are, I think, 70, 80%, 90% through the deleveraging process. I think there are some big counterparties that still need to get recapped. You know, knock on wood, you're seeing FTX Sam backman freed recapping blockvi, and so those consumers won't lose their money. And there's some.
00:05:12.060 - 00:05:56.734, Speaker A: Keep some confidence in the system. Celsius, like I said, I think will file, I don't know, factually, putting up the gates is almost the same thing as filing chapter eleven in some ways. And we'll see the rest of. I don't want to speculate on rumors on who's going to do the what, but it feels like the big guys that need to get capital will because they have other businesses that are sustainable and that should take the panic out of the system. And then it takes a while to rebuild, rebuild narrative, rebuild confidence. Ironically, crypto worked pretty well, right? You know, Defi worked. People got liquidated.
00:05:56.734 - 00:06:04.814, Speaker A: It was transparent. There were a few blemishes. Right. Bancorp tried to change the rules on their impermanent loss feature.
00:06:06.434 - 00:06:08.274, Speaker B: Yeah. Solend on Solana.
00:06:08.354 - 00:06:39.154, Speaker A: Yep. But for the most part, most of the protocols did what they were supposed to. And the irony is it was the non transparent traditional companies on top of crypto that got way over their skis. And that's a price for the whole community to pay. It's a little bit like when Lehman brothers and Bear Stearns and Merrill lynch got way offsides in mortgages. The more conservative investment banks still also got hammered. Right.
00:06:39.154 - 00:07:02.034, Speaker A: Everyone needs to pull money back. Confidence breaks down. Unlike traditional finance, we don't have a lender of last resort. There is no fed for crypto. And what's promising is money from outside our space is coming into these bailouts. You saw Goldman Sachs trying to raise a distress fund. I think that'll be a good business.
00:07:02.034 - 00:07:30.174, Speaker A: And so we need that money coming into the space to put a floor on the prices, and then we need new narrative. And that narrative, I think, will be the Fed flinching, because you're seeing the economy collapse right now, and we're going to be in a recession faster than you can shake a stick. That will hopefully have the Fed flinch and pause. And I think that gives bitcoin its narrative.
00:07:31.554 - 00:07:37.062, Speaker B: You think bitcoin leads the way at the point of a Fed flinch or pause?
00:07:37.118 - 00:08:13.836, Speaker A: 100% I really do. I think, I don't care if you're a bitcoin maximalist or an ethereum junkie. We all got to cheer for bitcoin right now, because without bitcoin going up, I think the confidence in the rest of crypto is going to be more shaken. Even though in the long run they might have very little to do with each other. Right now, they are conjoined twins, and bitcoin has the bigger community and the simpler story. The story of bitcoin really is a macro bet against the basement of currency. We might have lightning become a payment network, and that'll give it some utility.
00:08:13.836 - 00:08:34.604, Speaker A: I actually think, quite frankly, lightning makes it more confusing. I think it's a macro beta that a basement of currency, that's a simple story. It's digital gold. And that story has been sold. People believe it. There is a community of people that are willing to work really hard to sustain. And so I kind of think bitcoin's easier.
00:08:35.904 - 00:08:55.944, Speaker B: The rest, yeah, I think it has a. It clearly has it. Well, I'm going to ask it. Bitcoin has a very clear function. It works as advertised today. Feels like most of the rest of the space is still sort of in early phases, development phases, which is okay and good. What else are you excited about outside of bitcoin?
00:08:55.984 - 00:08:57.448, Speaker A: Well, listen, I think the rest, when.
00:08:57.456 - 00:08:59.034, Speaker B: It'S time to get excited again, has.
00:08:59.074 - 00:09:31.524, Speaker A: Been a venture bet, and it's playing out to work. I think there's three real buckets that you can think about, right? They're payments. Listen, in the US, Apple Pay and these other things work pretty damn well. So there's not this need for a better electronic payment system. But anything abroad, sending money abroad, remittances, none of it works right. And so I think there's a big role for crypto in payments. And we'll see stable coins, bitcoin, my guess is it's a stable coin system, but we'll see.
00:09:31.524 - 00:10:24.642, Speaker A: I think the big use case that will hopefully lift up blockchains was a continuation of what we saw last year, which was unique digital assets on a blockchain. Satoshi gave us private property on a blockchain, and now we can have unique digital art, unique digital signatures, unique digital characters, unique digital experience in a metaverse in a block, you know? And as the world becomes more and more meta, we spend more and more time on screens and on phones. Listen, I could be wearing a, you know, Kanye west designed gap Adidas collab, you know, digital jersey that I bought for, you know, two bitcoin because it was from Kanye west in the future, right?
00:10:24.778 - 00:10:31.322, Speaker B: And I mean, this is kind of the metaverse right now, you and I. I mean, I'm not in the office with you, and this feels pretty digital to me.
00:10:31.378 - 00:11:12.000, Speaker A: We are in the metaverse. And so, yeah, you're gonna have. But you're wearing normal clothes. Like, we could. We could be in the metaverse and we could be in, like, cool digital clothes or our avatars could be talking. And so I think, right, that expansion, now, what happened last time, that story, the story of the metaverse, the story of nfts, the excitement around the gambling mania. NFTs were investments and they were gambling mania around it that created the narrative to get Solana and all the other layer one blockchains rolling because we finally had a use case for the killer app for blockchains was nfts and probably is nfts.
00:11:12.000 - 00:11:44.624, Speaker A: For a while, there weren't sustainable long term communities built around things other than the gambling. We were starting to see it. You see it with bored apes, right? That's a community. They're not going away, but they were smaller communities. Even if you would go on sandbox or decentraland hundreds of thousands of users, not hundreds of millions. And I think what you're going to see next is big media platforms, gaming platforms. So you're going to see these bigger communities and I think you'll see faster adoption.
00:11:44.624 - 00:12:39.034, Speaker A: Listen, all 110 million of iHeart's users aren't going to show up there in their metaverse concerts, but you're going to get much quicker transition is my guess. And so I think what will lead us out in terms of use case is probably, that is probably unique digital assets in media gaming. It doesn't mean Defi's dead by any stretch. I think, quite frankly, Defi has to grind through this regulatory world. But I was wildly impressed at how compound and Aave and all the rest of them worked during this crises. Right. The other thing I think is going to change, and I haven't completely sorted this, is we have a lot of tokens, governance tokens for Uniswap, for instance, around awesome protocols where the governance token is wonky or janky.
00:12:39.034 - 00:13:35.254, Speaker A: A lot of times it was janky because they were trying to figure out how to not be a security token and make it a utility token, but also try to give some economic incent to the user. And my guess is the world will demand a cleaner link between, like there's a perfect use case for a decentralized exchange like Uniswap, which you can trade anything on, and that if I own part of that network, I should get some of those fees directly. Does that feel like a security token? Maybe. And maybe we just need another lane in regulation for decentralized security tokens. But we shouldn't stop awesome innovation because of regulation. We should get regulation to be effective and efficient around awesome innovation.
00:13:35.594 - 00:14:03.364, Speaker B: I love your point about security tokens as sort of an end state or the next development of governance tokens, because you're totally right. In my research and evaluating the space, most of the governance tokens convey very little value to their holders, right? And that is for, because if they do, then it's perhaps, you know, yielding an income and it's a dividend, it's a payment from the efforts of a third party. I think we'll get there, though.
00:14:03.904 - 00:14:41.146, Speaker A: We have to get security. Otherwise this whole thing is going to be because I think about, I don't want to pick on CZ because he's CZ and he's made more money and made more innovation in this space than just about anybody. But if you think about like his token, right, which he paid his employees in which is actually miraculous. You don't really get any of the profits of binance. He burns them if binance does. Well, I thought about, like, Novo token, and I was thinking Novotoken. If you own one of the 100,000 Novo tokens, you can come to the office and I can give you a kiss once a month.
00:14:41.146 - 00:15:16.546, Speaker A: And most people probably wouldn't want to come to the office and give me a kiss, just like most people don't use those tokens for discounted fees. Maybe my wife would show up for, like, a month or two, and then she'd probably even get bored. But if Galaxy did well, we'd burn Novo tokens, and Novo's on tv a lot, and so people get excited and they think they're investing in Novo, and it goes up, when in reality, it has nothing to do with the profits of Galaxy. Like, that's kind of what got done with a lot of these tokens. And that doesn't have, to me, have long term sustainability. It just doesn't.
00:15:16.650 - 00:15:29.618, Speaker B: Yeah, a lot of them are really, you know, weak pseudo equity at best. Right. And I think the value can really accrue and also be more useful if there is some actual, you know, it.
00:15:29.626 - 00:15:57.906, Speaker A: Doesn'T mean there's not utility. There can be great utility. There can be great utility access to something, but it's got to be, you, utility know, that people actually use in value. And so I think that will be necessary for our industry to march forward. And so there's going to be a great business in, and no one's done this brilliantly yet. There are a few businesses that do it well, but there's not enough expertise around that.
00:15:58.050 - 00:16:20.814, Speaker B: Fascinating. All right, a couple other questions, you know, I want to ask about. I've got a few more, but I think you touched on c five and Defi, I think, a bit. But I wanted to ask, given the six months that, you know, we're six months through the year, we're down, you know, big from all time highs in crypto. I mean, we're down. I think the Nasdaq 100 is down over a third.
00:16:22.194 - 00:16:30.054, Speaker A: Crypto feels like it's down 80%. It is. And that's, that's, that's so that's a tremendous beat down.
00:16:30.854 - 00:16:59.150, Speaker B: Yeah, it is. But you founded Galaxy at the end of 2017, sort of right at the. Right after the top of the last bubble, and built through that, there wasn't nearly as much private capital looking to allocate in startups and in private equity back then. I know I was doing venture in this space during that period. But there's a lot, it looks like, of still dry powder this time around. What does the private market side in your mind feel like? Is that going to.
00:16:59.182 - 00:17:01.366, Speaker A: So, listen, is that good?
00:17:01.470 - 00:17:02.878, Speaker B: There's an lot more building that can happen.
00:17:02.926 - 00:17:35.694, Speaker A: We survived crypto winter last time because we were small. We hedged our book really, really well. And so while the market was down 95%, we were down like 30, and that gave us the ability to survive. And so I think you'd have two kinds of companies. Companies that have didn't lose all their resources. Hedge funds that are down 30% will survive. Hedge funds that are down 80% won't survive, most likely.
00:17:35.694 - 00:18:12.728, Speaker A: And so we're going to. The difference between this time and last time is the industry was so much bigger, right? We were four times the size. And the good part about that is lots got built in this COVID bubble. A lot of talent came in, a lot of projects got built, a lot of innovation happened. That's all good. That's not going away, but I think it's going to be a bigger bloodletting of people losing jobs, of projects, not hedge funds, other projects not succeeding. And so there's going to be a lot of musical chairs.
00:18:12.728 - 00:19:01.320, Speaker A: I don't think it stops the industry from growing, but I think the dislocation is going to be more painful than it was last time. There's a tremendous amount of dry powder on the sidelines. Any one of their advisors, coaches, seasoned investors would be like, dudes, sit on your hands. You might be buying, you know, you might be putting a convert into a busted. A busted round from amazing companies. I mean, I think not. One of the companies that got funded in the last four months of 21, first two months of 22, I don't think we'll not have a restructuring where the pref investors get crammed down.
00:19:01.320 - 00:19:29.504, Speaker A: Everyone else in the next round. And so there's going to be a business really, in private restructurings, and there's not a lot of expertise in our community. Right. Our venture community was go, go, go. And so we put up valuations on great companies to stupid levels doesn't mean they're not great companies. It means they raise money at really dumb levels. That has implications for employees who got their options set at $8 billion valuation at a company that now is probably worth 2 billion.
00:19:29.504 - 00:19:57.474, Speaker A: And so how do you retain employees? How do you. And so there's a whole digestive process that has to go through that will take time, you know, is it 18 months? Is it six months, is it? There is a process that things have to hit an equilibrium. The good news is there's 10 billion plus of venture capital and it'll be interesting to see who can sit patiently like they should, versus it burns a hole in my pocket.
00:19:58.094 - 00:20:18.586, Speaker B: Yeah, that's what really, it's that $10 billion number. The amount of capital that came in and is effectively committed, even locked up to this investment thesis that did not exist in 2018 at all. But remember, you were a decently sized fund with 20 million back where I worked.
00:20:18.650 - 00:21:11.504, Speaker A: We came down, though, from like, we had close to a $4 trillion market cap, and now we're 600 billion or 800 billion or something. I don't even want to look. And so 10 billion is a lot. But this became a really big industry and you're going to see a rationalization that's not a terrible thing. Actually, the best companies are built in times of turmoil. And you learned you have to do some analysis of where do we screw up, what are the way every company, including ours, messed up was while I very much talked about bitcoin being 80 volume or 100 volume asset, and if you're 100 volume asset, there's a two thirds chance you're at zero or you're at two if you start at one in a year. That's what 100 volume means.
00:21:11.504 - 00:21:44.526, Speaker A: None of us planned our businesses. We might have planned our market rate trading around that concept, but we didn't plan our business growth around that. What does that mean practically? It means at the end of last year, if bitcoin was 50,000, you probably should have planned your business around a bitcoin of 30,000, not a 50. Right? Like, because there's such a chance you get there. You know, we knew the Fed was starting to hike rates. We knew there was a headwind. We knew that hill was adoption.
00:21:44.526 - 00:22:31.644, Speaker A: The adoption's still there. One of the promising data points we've gotten in the last five, six weeks is as we visited accounts in Europe and in the US, the institutions that aren't in aren't backing away. So you're going to see some pretty big commitments from people, both as investors and as builders, because no one doesn't think the world won't have more digital assets in five years than it has now. Tokenized funds, tokenized real estate, bitcoin unique digital assets on blockchains and metaverse healthcare records. And so any sophisticated bank or investor I know believes in that. What's the path? What are the right bets? Much more complicated.
00:22:32.304 - 00:22:44.816, Speaker B: Yeah, it's sort of like, if you hear this said, sometimes if you like bitcoin at 50k, you should love it at 19k, where we are right now. Right. Assuming you were doing your work and actually loving it, not just writing a momentum train.
00:22:44.880 - 00:23:27.264, Speaker A: But one of the lessons for everybody is you're either a value investor, you're a value investor. Warren Buffett. But once stock starts trading over 20 times pe a 70 P E stock, when you're trading at growth, you're a momentum investor, nothing else. You're a macro guy and you can fool yourself. But like in the two thousands, you couldn't have said the 99s, you know, or I'm a tech investor fundamentally, no. It was all wildly high peas, or even Google. Now, FAAng is a value play right there.
00:23:27.264 - 00:24:03.478, Speaker A: I think Facebook trades it eight times or something. And so you can look at it differently. There was no value playing crypto, not one. It was momentum. Bitcoin is the closest one you could have argued because you could have looked at it versus gold and adoption, but everything else was a play on the future, and we had no real way to know what valuation meant. You could look at relative valuation. I used to say this looks really cheap versus Cardano, but it was people buying into this dream.
00:24:03.478 - 00:24:30.484, Speaker A: And I think the next time up, why it's going to be harder work is we don't have the. I'm not saying we wouldn't have speculumania again. Humans love to speculate, love to gamble. It's part of our DNA. But we're not going to have COVID and we're not going to have a fed saying, we're going to give everybody money. The preconditions for the wild bull market that we had aren't going to exist for a while. You're going to have to tell a story based on shit that works.
00:24:31.304 - 00:24:47.872, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Another question here, and it goes along these same lines, and you're expecting to be clear. The Fed will pause and blink because they'll get inflation under control and then there will be other issues.
00:24:48.048 - 00:25:03.756, Speaker A: I think there's going to be this amazing tension. So right now, everyone in politics is talking about inflation. It dominates 55% of what people are going to vote around is inflation. And it's all Biden's fault because he's the president. That's just the way politics works.
00:25:03.900 - 00:25:05.820, Speaker B: Yeah, it's the economy, stupid.
00:25:05.972 - 00:25:29.939, Speaker A: In September, my belief is all aim is going to talk about his recession. We are literally going to shift the narrative from inflation. Recession. Inflation is still going to be high, but it's going to be coming down. Even today's PCE number is a little lower than last month's. We might have one more high CPI print, but then even base effects are going to make it come down. But the economy is slowing crude down.
00:25:29.939 - 00:26:11.578, Speaker A: Oil is a short here, not a long. You see it in commodity prices. And so there's going to be this tension between a plunging economy which wants you to cut rates, let alone not raise them, and Powell needing to get the credibility of the Fed back and bash inflation expectations down. Not just inflation. And you see breakevens and fixed income have collapsed. And so most likely scenario for me is the Fed hikes in July, hikes in August, and maybe pauses or gives a small hike in September and then says, hey, we're going to wait. That would give the macro story back to bitcoin again.
00:26:11.578 - 00:26:24.116, Speaker A: We first have to get through the rest of this deleveraging. We're not there yet. When you read about people getting bailed out, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.
00:26:24.116 - 00:27:02.196, Speaker B: It do you think, Mike, just given how coupled Fed policy is with the success of financial markets these days, how interventionist they've been, this massive liquidity injection that led to a huge everything bubble and now pulling that liquidity away because they have to fight inflation, is that the, I don't, I don't know if it's, the question, is the proper role for a central bank? It seems like they definitely wouldn't want this to be their role. But also, does this strengthen the argument for bitcoin in general, like both the.
00:27:02.380 - 00:27:46.926, Speaker A: Increase and listen, if you want to be really simple about bitcoin is anti populists and governments tend towards populism, right? Why does it. Capitalism tends towards inequality and governments are there to then fight inequality in lots of ways. And so it's not the Fed's fault, solely the Fed, right? It's Congress's fault. It's Donald Trump's fault for running the biggest increase in government spending in history before COVID right? Yeah. He took government spending from 3 trillion to 3.9 trillion people before COVID when we had the greatest economy of all time. And when asked who's going to pay for it, he said, oh, someone else can worry about it.
00:27:46.926 - 00:27:49.246, Speaker A: Like, that's fact. I'm not making that up.
00:27:49.430 - 00:27:49.870, Speaker B: Right.
00:27:49.942 - 00:28:21.976, Speaker A: Then Biden took over and said, hey, it's the progressive's time to use COVID to get our social policy done. And so that 1st $1.8 trillion stimulus but wasn't needed fucking so much wasted in PPE, in the schools and schools wanting to use it on shit they cared about, like books. No, got to buy more masks. And so there was this bizarre shift of more money. And quite frankly, if it wasn't for Joe Manchin, we'd had another trillion odd dollars in the build back. Better bill.
00:28:21.976 - 00:29:01.094, Speaker A: And I'm all for politicians listening to their people and making decisions based on what they run on. It's gotta be done in a context of prudent fiscal policy. And starting with Trump, we threw prudent fiscal policy out the window. We had a surplus with Clinton's last term. We went from a big deficit when Reagan took over to Iran to a surplus. And then we had this kind of neoliberalism in politics until Trump. And Trump got elected as a populist, right.
00:29:01.094 - 00:29:57.754, Speaker A: The people at the bottom 60% felt like capitalism wasn't working for them. And so they picked Trump, and then they flipped back and they picked left. And, you know, we're going to windshield wiper back and forth until there's a new narrative that actually works for lots of people. And so that's why bitcoin was invented originally, as the response to this coming. And so I do think trusting in math, trusting in code, having a monetary policy that is literally built into the code, that's really rational, it's a deflationary or anti inflationary monetary policy. It wouldn't work if we didn't have populist governments, if we had a really prudent government. Why do you need bitcoin? He built it because he knows governments tend towards populism, and we're in that phase now.
00:29:57.754 - 00:30:22.036, Speaker A: Listen, AOC could become the president, right? She's a populist, she's smart, she's effective, she's got a view. She represents a whole lot of people that feel left out of the system, really. She's the mirror to Donald Trump. Just a lot more gracious and more articulate. We're not in the center. Our politics aren't in the center. There's no fiscal prudence.
00:30:22.036 - 00:30:45.624, Speaker A: And again, I look at Joe Manchin, who my progressive friends were really angry at for lots of reasons. In some ways, he's the hero of this story. Otherwise, we'd been in more shape. And so we need adults back in the room, because it's going to be hard to. I think bitcoin has a pretty big future. Even think about what happened in the Supreme Court. You had three justices who sat there in their.
00:30:45.624 - 00:30:59.642, Speaker A: In their confirmation, and I wouldn't call them liars. Cause they didn't actually lie. They were cheeky, though. It's settled. It's settled. You know, case law. Okay.
00:30:59.642 - 00:31:20.964, Speaker A: That's what they said. It was settled case law. They unsettled it. Right, exactly. That breaks down trust. It just does. And so as we have trust breakdown in institutions, and I'm not, you know, saying that to be inflammatory, you can tell it because you just read on Twitter that half the people don't trust him anymore.
00:31:20.964 - 00:31:42.654, Speaker A: And so when the court is less trusted, it's where Satoshi's innovation is so important. You don't need to trust us. This is, it's in, it's in the system, right. It's trust in the code. And that, I think, makes me kind of big picture, much more bullish. This, this idea.
00:31:44.474 - 00:32:15.790, Speaker B: This was great, Mike. I think you covered a lot of awesome topics. I totally agree with you on bitcoin as sort of an exemplary, uh, you know, untrusting, um, you know, code based system for, uh, bring, bringing truth into the world without having to rely on, um, these things. I guess the final question I would ask is in the next maybe, you know, you've talked about rates over the next, you know, know, three, four months. What does the summer look like in your mind? I mean, like, you know, people used to say, sell in May and go away. It doesn't.
00:32:15.822 - 00:32:18.194, Speaker A: We all wish we did. We all wish we.
00:32:20.574 - 00:32:25.726, Speaker B: It doesn't look like volatility is going down anytime soon. Are people going to be trading from the beach? I mean, is it.
00:32:25.790 - 00:32:56.842, Speaker A: No, I think you're probably wrong there. I think what's going to happen is you're going to see volumes involve slow down. Yeah, we will. You'll have market volume, but you're going to have less excitement as people dust themselves off and try to understand what their new reality is like when markets are falling as fast as they are, everyone is unsettled. Right. The stock I own in my company is worth less. Oh, my pa, investment is worth less.
00:32:56.842 - 00:33:08.804, Speaker A: Oh, that's worth less. Oh, do I have. So there's this unsettling. You need the market to get settled. You need individuals to get settled. Okay, I got fired. I didn't get fired.
00:33:08.804 - 00:33:45.544, Speaker A: This is what my balance sheet looks like. I can pay my rent. That takes the anxiety down. That takes volatility down, and that happens naturally in every cycle. And so I do think we will get to that point. The interesting news for the 18 month, two year view is there's a pretty interesting scenario where things are collapsing now and the Fed pauses. This is what happened in 1974, and they might even cut, and then inflation could take right back off.
00:33:45.544 - 00:34:21.708, Speaker A: We don't understand. You're a lot younger than me. You don't understand inflation because you've never lived through it. I didn't really live through it. I got the tail end when I got to Wall street, rates were 9% on their way straight down. But I wasn't a student of markets in the seventies. And so what creates inflation expectations in people is complicated, right? Part of it's already built in the system, right? 16% of union jobs now have wages tied to CPI.
00:34:21.708 - 00:35:01.008, Speaker A: So if CPI is 7%, I get 7% plus 1%. And so the german labor unions used to have all of that. That's why the Germans were so cautious about inflation expectations. They lived through Weimar. And so we're hoping pal hits the silver hammer on the inflation head and it goes right back down into its little box. And you run the jack in the box, it doesn't pop its ugly head, but there's an easy scenario that says everyone thinks the jack in the box is back in the box, and all of a sudden he pops right back up and you're like, oh, fuck, we've got inflation. I think this is going to be a really, really interesting 24 months in macro.
00:35:01.008 - 00:35:39.504, Speaker A: It's going to be challenging running businesses. But I think the rationale of why we got into this business, from bitcoin Maxis to people who really believe in decentralized systems and unique digital assets like that's not going away. Navigating to where that's going to be in two years is going to be the companies, the CEO's, the teams that can do that are going to feel really good about themselves and make great wealth, and others are going to run into rocks and crash into the shoreline. It's not going to be nearly as easy as the last 24 months, where we all look like Superman.
00:35:41.104 - 00:35:47.244, Speaker B: You could throw a dart. Okay. I don't know. Do you want to cover anything else, Mike? I mean, I think that's good for me.
00:35:47.544 - 00:35:59.404, Speaker A: For the last day of the worst six months, I've suffered in a long time. I'm going to call it a day. It is. I'm going to grab a cigar. I'm going to take a shot of either Havana club or Hibiki 21, and.
00:36:02.344 - 00:36:05.936, Speaker B: It'S been a wild six months. I can't believe it's June 30 today. You're right.
00:36:06.040 - 00:36:13.896, Speaker A: Yeah, it does feel a lot. Crazy year. So far, I think I've lost my voice in this whole thing. All right, Alex. Thanks a ton. All good.
00:36:13.920 - 00:36:14.864, Speaker B: Sorry I talked to you, too, Mike.
00:36:14.944 - 00:36:15.584, Speaker A: Yep. Be well.
00:36:15.624 - 00:36:17.184, Speaker B: No, this is great, dude. I'll see you in a couple weeks.
