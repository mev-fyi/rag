00:00:00.410 - 00:00:00.960, Speaker A: You.
00:00:01.570 - 00:00:49.830, Speaker B: This gonna be a one take day, Finn. It's not gonna be a 20 take day. We're not punching any lyrics here, dude. We're doing these verses straight up. Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. Yo, holler to my homies making moves to rebirth and I'm pedaling grooves so hard it's like my knees hurt. Mind your beeswax packs and eat your peas first I've been double dipping, ripping, rolling hazy and never being lazy with the words that I'm arranging when my team rolls up, I'm yelling hell, we hear Bim net, t will and the killer Kelly Greer, you can't top us, stop us we're kings of the corn riding through the storm with the cyber hornet swarm and we buzing since we born and we're never gonna let up and we're building for the future written I really love the setup.
00:00:49.830 - 00:01:18.798, Speaker B: I've been feeling vibes since the song started. See my haters going down like the long bond market and tinders in the fire pit something's gonna spark it keep your eye on the prize and your focus on the target. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital. Thank you for listening to Galaxy brains. We have a great show for you today. As I said, we've got a little bit of a medley here. We've got Kelly Greer from Galaxy trading to talk about options, market positioning and other interesting stuff in the near term outlook.
00:01:18.798 - 00:01:54.114, Speaker B: We've got Tyler Williams, our head of policy at Galaxy, to give us an update on the dysfunction in the US House of Representatives. And of course, we'll check in with our good friend Bimnet, a BB from Galaxy trading, to talk macro. Before we get to that, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Yo, what up, Phineas? We got two major trials happening a couple blocks from here in New York. Did you see any of that when you came over? Big news. Big news in our world. And I think we're following one much closer than the other.
00:01:54.114 - 00:02:21.062, Speaker B: Is that right? Yeah. Well, one of them is a egomaniacal man accused of fraud, and the other is Sam Bankman free, literally. The former president and Sam Bankman fried of FTX are undergoing trials in lower Manhattan now, which is pretty wild. It's the FTX crime family on display. Totally. You've been following reporters live, tweeting from inside the great account. Inner city press.
00:02:21.062 - 00:02:36.190, Speaker B: He literally transcribes it for you. But I can't help but think every time I read it. Like the music that Castle island plays on the brink podcast for the FTX crime family. It's like the violin from the Godfather plays. I love that pod, by the way. Absolutely.
00:02:36.260 - 00:02:37.882, Speaker C: One of our favorite podcasts.
00:02:37.946 - 00:02:54.478, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, great guys. Very smart and doing it a long time. Did you know that they edited themselves? And I'm looking at the job that they're doing. I don't know what I would do if I had to do it myself. They do two episodes a week, which is just impressive. Yeah, it's just a lot of work and hundreds, I think. Fantastic pod.
00:02:54.478 - 00:03:11.238, Speaker B: Yeah. Big fans of on the brink. I think it's the only actual other pod I listen to on a regular basis other than our own. Like I said, we got a great show this week. Let's dive right into it. Let's go to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:03:11.334 - 00:03:12.506, Speaker C: Thanks for having me on.
00:03:12.608 - 00:03:21.002, Speaker B: It's a really exciting time. Is this too far to go to say that there's like a run on us government debt happening?
00:03:21.136 - 00:04:02.940, Speaker C: I would say the moves that we've had over the past several weeks are indicative of a market that's not functioning properly. It's indicative of a market that's woken up to the reality of fiscal policy, what it means currently and what it means going forward. And the magnitude of that realization versus where we were before is pretty huge. And that's why you're having this catch up. The essence of it is there's more treasury supply coming and it's just not stopping. And so when there's just infinite supply, prices go down. And prices of bonds went down this week, particularly in the back end, I don't think they're done.
00:04:02.940 - 00:04:17.598, Speaker C: And the only likely solution is these prices cheapen to the point where the government starts feeling uncomfortable and the Fed starts feeling basically something breaks or something becomes mean.
00:04:17.684 - 00:04:30.210, Speaker B: The US government issues this debt in order to finance itself, right, to provide itself with money to spend. And theoretically, you could take in revenues that would be equal to the spending. And so that would be.
00:04:30.360 - 00:04:34.100, Speaker C: That's not happening in our current political climate in decades. Absolutely not.
00:04:34.710 - 00:04:45.254, Speaker B: But so they're printing all of this debt and people are becoming more and more concerned that we'll ever be able to pay it off. Right. Or that we'll pay this off, but it'll get more and more expensive. Our credit is declining basically, right?
00:04:45.292 - 00:05:12.378, Speaker C: No, absolutely. So the issue right now that we're having is it was okay to issue all that debt at 2% interest rates or at zero, right? And the interest expense wouldn't kill you as much. But now it's like the fiscal policy is such that it looks like you're going to be printing like 5% deficits at least going forward and your interest expense is constantly going up as a portion of your budget. And so the math becomes untenable.
00:05:12.474 - 00:05:13.066, Speaker B: Spirals.
00:05:13.178 - 00:05:54.958, Speaker C: Basically it spirals. But then in the context of all the unfunded liabilities that you have in the balance sheet, you can see that the debt is only going to continue to increase. And it's never an issue because it hasn't been an issue because there's always been buyers of this paper, right? Mainly the central banks. They own like a quarter of it, but foreign officials, corporates, pensions, insurance, et cetera. But at this point, with such huge mark to market losses, more supply coming, and the central banks can't really buy that back, or the US central bank can't buy it because it'd send the wrong signal because you're still 1.6% above your inflation target. And so they can't really start buying that paper.
00:05:54.958 - 00:05:59.578, Speaker C: And if they signal that they're buying that paper, it basically means we're going to have money printing forever.
00:05:59.674 - 00:06:07.618, Speaker B: Right? Which they're trying is the reality. We know we will. But right now they're gritting their teeth, trying to be as stern as possible to say it won't happen.
00:06:07.704 - 00:06:42.286, Speaker C: Correct. But my issue is that all of this stuff is really bad, right? If you were in an EM economy and you're like, holy shit, my country has to print debt forever and the only way they can pay it is by inflating it and having the central bank buy it. You'd be like, I want to sell that currency like crazy because it's worthless. Because they just keep printing money that they don't have out thin air. However, in this instance, you have a situation where the US is winner by default, everywhere else is way worse. Japan's still stuck at negative rates. Their debt to GDP is way, way higher.
00:06:42.286 - 00:07:22.294, Speaker C: Europe can't really grow its way out of its issues. They're having a slowdown. They're getting very impacted by the chinese slowdown as well. And so you've got a situation where the US is the best house on a shitty right and it wins by default. I would like to think that the market is getting smarter on this and eventually this will lead to folks thinking about bitcoin more. And, you know, I'd like to take this moment to raise the bit signal because it just feels like the right time. I think people are waking up to the reality of the future of this debt path.
00:07:22.294 - 00:07:24.060, Speaker C: Right. We have.
00:07:25.950 - 00:07:26.410, Speaker B: Correct.
00:07:26.480 - 00:07:43.098, Speaker C: I mean, Ray Dalio was on tv yesterday warning against a literal debt crisis in the US. And so we're fundamentally at a situation where it looks like we're going to spend way more than we ever receive in income in perpetuity.
00:07:43.194 - 00:07:47.442, Speaker B: Right. That's that currency you'd want to sell.
00:07:47.496 - 00:07:48.462, Speaker C: That's that currency.
00:07:48.606 - 00:07:49.554, Speaker B: But it's the only one left.
00:07:49.592 - 00:07:50.674, Speaker C: What do you sell versus it?
00:07:50.712 - 00:07:53.506, Speaker B: Right. Well, there hasn't been an alternative and.
00:07:53.528 - 00:07:57.858, Speaker C: I think that's where it is now. And that's bitcoin. Right. Finite money.
00:07:57.944 - 00:07:58.386, Speaker B: Right.
00:07:58.488 - 00:08:00.854, Speaker C: Defined monetary policy, by the way you can use it.
00:08:00.892 - 00:08:05.190, Speaker B: Right? Gold would be great, but I mean, in this, you can't spend it. Possible.
00:08:05.340 - 00:08:30.522, Speaker C: Exactly. And then you throw in the positive headwinds of an ETF. Potentially sooner, rather. But besides, like, just from a philosophical perspective, the issue is it's not only just the debt construct, but it's a construct of the US financial plumbing. It is entirely dependent upon the ability to print infinite amount of money and to loan institutions money at. Ridiculous, sorry, like contracts and specifications.
00:08:30.586 - 00:08:30.766, Speaker B: Right?
00:08:30.788 - 00:08:37.742, Speaker C: The BTFP, where you can borrow money at poor versus securities and loans. That's absurd.
00:08:37.806 - 00:08:38.420, Speaker B: Right?
00:08:38.870 - 00:09:20.026, Speaker C: And the banking system would have literally crumbled without these emergency facilities. The discount window, which had over 100 billion in usage. The BTFP, another 100 billion plus. Without that, what would regional banking look like right now? Right? Without the FX swap lines that the government had during COVID and all the other random facilities where they just injected free money at zero, you can borrow infinite money versus assets at zero. Without that, the financial plumbing really doesn't work. And some people would argue that, well, it's no better anywhere else. That's how financial plumbing should work, et cetera.
00:09:20.026 - 00:09:43.990, Speaker C: And things are fine because we have this infinite money printing. But in my head, it's like, guys, this can't last forever, right? Just infinite balance sheet expansion will have consequences. We're seeing a little bit of it now with this inflation stuff. But fundamentally and philosophically, I just have just such a huge, I don't know, discontent.
00:09:44.410 - 00:10:24.846, Speaker B: What's the alternative? As you've said, and right now there's not really one. But the thing is, whether or not it's bitcoin or not every empire has thought it would last forever or tried to make it last forever. Right? But yet every single empire in human history has collapsed. Right? It's inevitable. I mean, it is inevitable now. Whether we can hang on to this parlor game for 300 more years, who knows? But it will come to an end. And the fear that I'm seeing now in the markets in general is it does feel new, even though people have been talking about the debt problem for so long and the fiscal and the lack of a balanced budget, et cetera.
00:10:24.846 - 00:10:37.526, Speaker B: But now I think people are really starting to freak out, honestly, because the cost, like you said, the cost of merely servicing the debt is going to, it already is, what, like 10% of the 15%? Eventually we're not going to.
00:10:37.548 - 00:10:40.546, Speaker C: I mean, look at spending over a quarter of the budget.
00:10:40.658 - 00:11:15.434, Speaker B: I was saying it's a bim expenses, right? So you have to keep raising taxes to cover it, but it's like you're spending more and getting less for it each time. I was saying this to bimnet before we started recording, but look out at your infrastructure in America. Look at your roads, look at your public schools, look at your public hospitals. Does anyone think they're better now than they were ten or 20 years ago? Because I'm wondering where this money is going. And increasingly, we know it's going to go just to servicing our out of control debt, which is just a disaster. I mean, basically. And at least with bitcoin, it's global, doesn't have that type of liability.
00:11:15.434 - 00:11:25.062, Speaker B: It's a liability to no one. And I think that people are starting to figure that out. Bitcoiners have been preaching this for years.
00:11:25.196 - 00:11:33.258, Speaker C: I'm like, thank God. I think Mike Novregatzer, CEO, put it best. But it seems like the market is having like a moment.
00:11:33.344 - 00:11:33.546, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:33.568 - 00:11:56.802, Speaker C: Right. Just all of a sudden everybody realizes this at once and they're now trading on it. And it's interesting because that's just how markets work. The factual, the reality of stuff is there, but until something actually happens or there's a catalyst, you rarely see value get to where it should be.
00:11:56.856 - 00:11:57.506, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:57.688 - 00:12:19.654, Speaker C: And so the thing I generally have an issue with as well is just folks are thinking a couple of years out right now, like two, three, four or five years. But if you start thinking a decade out and like two decades out, right, what does the deficit or the national debt look like? A decade out right now?
00:12:19.772 - 00:12:21.962, Speaker B: 50 trillion? I don't know. A lot more.
00:12:22.016 - 00:12:23.900, Speaker C: A lot more, right.
00:12:24.270 - 00:12:27.260, Speaker B: That chart is like parabolic. Parabolic, yeah.
00:12:27.630 - 00:12:44.542, Speaker C: And I'm just like, what is it going to look like in 30 years? And the only solution right now, if you ask the fed, okay, what do you think monetary policy is going to look like in 2030 years? They're not going to tell you that their balance sheet is going to have come down or it's going to be at a manageable level.
00:12:44.676 - 00:12:45.022, Speaker B: Right.
00:12:45.076 - 00:13:01.378, Speaker C: They're going to basically be. Their ideal scenario, their best case scenario is that inflation isn't an issue and they are able to keep yields low and they have a huge balance parlor game going, but that's not going to work anymore. We've seen that when you do that, that leads to hyperinflation.
00:13:01.474 - 00:13:02.120, Speaker B: Right.
00:13:02.570 - 00:13:17.850, Speaker C: And so there's no real solution. And I think more and more people are waking up to the reality that it's bitcoin, I think, but it's slow. And you really do need passage of time for wealth to move.
00:13:17.920 - 00:13:21.002, Speaker B: Yeah. You need a long term conviction in it, though. It is a long term bet.
00:13:21.056 - 00:13:28.154, Speaker C: I think one of the things I've always wanted to do is write a piece called Dear Bond vigilantes. Have you heard of bitcoin?
00:13:28.202 - 00:13:28.798, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:28.964 - 00:13:33.866, Speaker C: Basically a piece that I might actually write this, but calling out each one of the title.
00:13:33.898 - 00:13:34.734, Speaker B: That's Bibnet's title.
00:13:34.782 - 00:13:56.214, Speaker C: Yeah, but basically calling out every huge bond manager on the planet, like the guys at Vanguard, the blackrocks of the world, et cetera, being like, realistically, what are you actually betting on when you buy 20 year bonds? I think the answer is the central bank is going to continue to buy this paper. Right?
00:13:56.412 - 00:13:57.542, Speaker B: Core thesis there.
00:13:57.596 - 00:14:41.382, Speaker C: Core core thesis there. But I don't think it's really a function of, oh, I'm going to generate returns above inflation on this. And it's also, when you think about it in the context of, okay, what are the government's actual obligations for the next 20 years? Right. You can predict that pretty easily, right? Social Security, all the Medicare stuff, aging population, how much you're going to have to spend on that. You make assumptions about whether the defense budget stays the same, et cetera. The long story short, the picture just gets worse and worse, and it's not even linear. And so either you're going to have to inflate your way out of all that debt, but the math just doesn't work without assuming the central bank's just going to like.
00:14:41.436 - 00:14:50.554, Speaker B: And of course, if you try to inflate your way out at that level with the math, I mean, the math doesn't work, but I mean, you know, what will happen, right? You'll have coups, you'll have revolution, massive social unrest. Right.
00:14:50.592 - 00:15:02.860, Speaker C: It's totally possible, which is what I'm worried about in Em sooner rather than later, because they're getting pounded by a stronger. You know, they still have. And so.
00:15:03.390 - 00:15:10.494, Speaker B: Well, we. I think Bitmet has raised the bit signal. He's raised it. We got to get one. Like the light.
00:15:10.532 - 00:15:12.654, Speaker C: With the light? Yeah, with the bitcoin logo, maybe.
00:15:12.692 - 00:15:14.898, Speaker B: Phineas, get on that. Help us look into that.
00:15:15.064 - 00:15:16.066, Speaker C: Phineas, please.
00:15:16.168 - 00:15:28.630, Speaker B: We need it. This is great. We're having Kelly on. She's going to talk to us a little more about bitcoin markets as well. So Bimnet BB from Galaxy Trading. My friend, thank you for joining Galaxy Brains, as always.
00:15:28.700 - 00:15:29.800, Speaker C: Thank you so much.
00:15:31.050 - 00:15:36.034, Speaker B: Let's go now to my friend Kelly Greer from Galaxy Trading. Welcome to Galaxy Brains, Kelly.
00:15:36.082 - 00:15:37.890, Speaker A: It is a pleasure to be here, Alex.
00:15:37.970 - 00:15:48.822, Speaker B: So Kelly is a vice president in sales and trading. Right. So just real quickly, tell the audience, who may not know what that is, just what that is. What do you do at Galaxy?
00:15:48.886 - 00:16:41.214, Speaker A: Absolutely. I'm on our us sales team. So we have a global sales and trading team with teammates in Hong Kong and London. In the US, we work with our us based counterparties for the trading business, but also connecting them to all parts of galaxy. So my team and I talk directly with our counterparties, help them get what they need out of the trading desk and the firm. That includes trading options, loans for their portfolio, lending their crypto, borrowing versat, lending crypto directly for yield and trading spot, all on an OTC basis with our desk. So we're helping them solve problems, whether it's hedging a position that's unlocking hedging their book, solving for yield generation, or maybe they have a portfolio company that wants advice from advisory and we can make the right connections, but generally talking to and working with the Galaxy counterparties all day, which is super fun.
00:16:41.332 - 00:16:47.390, Speaker B: And what kind of counterparties? Who are these counterparties? Right. I mean, it's hedge funds. What is it?
00:16:47.540 - 00:17:02.354, Speaker A: Hedge funds, venture capital funds, corporates. We have strong relationships as well with pensions and endowments who allocate to the space in different ways. But I think over time, we'll get comfortable with spot crypto, too.
00:17:02.392 - 00:17:18.310, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. So you had a really interesting tweet a couple of days ago talking about the positioning in the options market and how there were a lot of dealers that are basically short. Gamma, what did this bitcoin in. Bitcoin specifically? Yeah. What did this mean?
00:17:18.380 - 00:17:40.142, Speaker A: It's particularly interesting there's a strong difference in the market positioning in the options of bitcoin and ethereum, and we can talk about the reasoning behind that, but generally, what does it mean? So when you think about options positioning of dealers, you're saying for everyone that's trading options in the market from a speculative position or from a hedging standpoint, there's a dealer on the other side of it.
00:17:40.196 - 00:17:40.800, Speaker B: Right.
00:17:41.330 - 00:18:27.966, Speaker A: When dealers are what we call short gamma. Gamma is a greek. So when you think about options, you think about them in terms of greeks, because that shows how your option price changes with respect to all of the black scholes inputs that go into the option, things like Delta, which is how the option price changes as spot prices change, things like time to maturity, things like volatility, interest rates, dividends for a stock, et cetera. So what my tweet was focusing on was really delta and gamma. And so when you analyze this data, you're making an implicit assumption that dealers who are managing a vol book are running their book Delta neutral, I. E. They're taking positions in volatility, and they're hedging out their risk to spot price.
00:18:27.966 - 00:18:42.770, Speaker A: Okay. So what we can take from that is when you see flows in the market, and you can back out as a result of that, what dealers positioning is, you can anticipate how they will have to be hedging their portfolio as spot prices change.
00:18:42.840 - 00:18:43.458, Speaker B: Right.
00:18:43.624 - 00:19:01.062, Speaker A: So when dealers are long gamma, gamma is a derivative of delta. That means they will be reinforcing markets in either direction. Sorry. When they're short gamma, they're going to be reinforcing the market direction either way. And when they're long gamma, they're doing the opposite.
00:19:01.126 - 00:19:01.690, Speaker B: Right.
00:19:01.840 - 00:19:06.746, Speaker A: So in bitcoin, we can go into why this is the case.
00:19:06.848 - 00:19:07.450, Speaker B: Right.
00:19:07.600 - 00:19:09.450, Speaker A: In bitcoin, dealers are.
00:19:09.520 - 00:19:09.994, Speaker B: Today.
00:19:10.112 - 00:19:11.114, Speaker A: Yeah. Today, yeah.
00:19:11.152 - 00:19:12.266, Speaker B: This isn't like a long term thing.
00:19:12.288 - 00:19:14.042, Speaker A: This is the current position, current positioning.
00:19:14.106 - 00:19:18.190, Speaker B: Yeah. And you can see this with data from places like derribit and paradigm, right?
00:19:18.260 - 00:19:54.826, Speaker A: Yeah. Paradigm blocks 95% of block trade sizes in the listed options market. So they have really good insight into data. Also a great podcast, and a lot of the data that I look at is from amber data. They have some really interesting charts that show that gamma positioning for dealers is very short in bitcoin, and it's very long in ETH. And the ETH is especially interesting because there was a shift that happened at the Shanghai upgrade. And so that's a reflection in Ethereum of a lot of option selling activity that happened once ETH holders unlock their ETH, it's available.
00:19:54.826 - 00:19:56.074, Speaker A: They can sell calls on it.
00:19:56.112 - 00:19:56.522, Speaker B: I see.
00:19:56.576 - 00:20:08.794, Speaker A: Which is an outsized flow we're seeing in the market. There's heavily skewed activity to selling calls in Ethereum, hence why dealers are on the other side of that and are long options and long gamma, which will suppress ETH volatility.
00:20:08.922 - 00:20:09.358, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:09.444 - 00:20:39.490, Speaker A: Opposite the case in bitcoin. And so you can come up with reasons why, anecdotally, we see more demand for bitcoin upside from some of the traditional funds and crypto funds we work with, either on a stance around being long on the ETF narrative, or some funds are benchmarks to bitcoin. And bitcoin has been outperforming. It's a great way to catch up to the market performance and their benchmark by being long in a levered manner.
00:20:39.570 - 00:20:40.200, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:40.810 - 00:20:45.626, Speaker A: Thus, when you look at the positioning, there's a lot of outstanding call interest around 30 and 35k.
00:20:45.728 - 00:20:46.090, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:46.160 - 00:20:53.574, Speaker A: So as we get near those levels in spot, those dealers will need to be buying delta to hedge their books.
00:20:53.622 - 00:20:53.798, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:53.824 - 00:21:15.358, Speaker A: And we put some numbers out to our counterparties, and we wrote about it on Twitter. It's hundreds of millions of spot notional or futures notional, whatever they want to use. And we do see the behavior of futures markets behave in such a way that reinforces this thesis. So on moves higher, eth funding goes more negative and bitcoin funding increases.
00:21:15.454 - 00:21:44.766, Speaker B: I see. When you're short gamma, you basically have to buy bitcoin as the price goes higher to cover exactly your position. And so I think the thing we were saying, and that you were saying was that as we approach those levels, it can spiral higher. Right. I think a lot of people in crypto are familiar with, like, long and short futures liquidations. It's not the same thing, but it has a similar effect. Right.
00:21:44.766 - 00:21:46.238, Speaker B: Of enforcing the move.
00:21:46.324 - 00:21:47.978, Speaker A: Exactly like a virtuous cycle.
00:21:48.074 - 00:22:08.738, Speaker B: Right. And what you think that level is like in the 30k range. Right. So if we can round it for some reason, whichever the reason is, whether it's an ETF approval or any other positive catalyst in the market, right. Then there could be some gap up, basically because of the positioning of the major dealers in the space. Really just anyone who's selling in options.
00:22:08.824 - 00:22:30.460, Speaker A: Yeah, that's our view. And you can zoom out. And I got this feedback, actually from some Twitter friends I met up with when I was tweeting about this, and they were like, but the options market is still pretty small. Right, but zoom out. Spot volumes are down, and listeners of the pod will know that spot volume data has its flaws, but volumes are down, like 80% or something from the bottom.
00:22:34.050 - 00:22:56.674, Speaker B: I tweeted a chart of bitcoin denominated bitcoin volumes on exchanges. Right. So in BTC terms, so controlling for the price of bitcoin, and again, yes, knowing that it's very subject to which exchanges you look at, some are not reliable or whatever, but this is the data from the block. And I think September was the lowest volume since December 2016.
00:22:56.722 - 00:22:58.870, Speaker A: Yeah. Down bad in spot volume.
00:22:59.370 - 00:23:04.274, Speaker B: That leaves the dealers as among the only big traders currently, like, active.
00:23:04.322 - 00:23:25.114, Speaker A: Active, exactly. An increasingly important force in the market. So spot volumes are down, call it 80%, but open interest, while it's still a relatively small market, is a larger and larger share. So bitcoin options open interest peaked at like 15 billion in the bull market and before the September expiry was around ten. So down much less than spot volumes.
00:23:25.162 - 00:23:26.126, Speaker B: Right. Interesting.
00:23:26.228 - 00:23:48.914, Speaker A: Yeah. So more and more. So it's an increasingly important thing to pay attention to when you think about what's moving crypto markets. And it will be, I think, one day, the same way it's viewed in traditional markets, where I came from when I was on the derivatives desk at Morgan, where there are research analysts dedicated to analyzing options, positioning to predict how futures and cash markets will behave.
00:23:48.962 - 00:24:12.186, Speaker B: So you don't view, in the longer term maturation of the space, you don't think that if we have a massive influx of spot volume, whether driven by market access vehicles or just another giant bull run that retail gets heavily involved in, wouldn't that reduce the magnitude of the options? Or you're saying that longer, as it matures, it should actually stay quite important?
00:24:12.288 - 00:24:27.250, Speaker A: I think it will stay quite important. I think the retail users will also come back to crypto options, and the participants of the driven market will continue to grow, as we've seen it grow dramatically through our counterparty base as well. Right.
00:24:27.320 - 00:24:34.018, Speaker B: And so, like, more mature market participants also use more sophisticated instruments to express themselves.
00:24:34.104 - 00:24:41.846, Speaker A: Right, exactly. They give access to leverage. You can hedge. It's a lot of smarter solutions you can solve for versus trading just the spot product.
00:24:41.948 - 00:24:42.600, Speaker B: Right.
00:24:43.130 - 00:25:04.010, Speaker A: And I do think crypto retail options traders might be focusing their attention on things like one day options that are now available in robinhood. And so that phenomena has left crypto, and right now, you have a core focus of institutional players in the options market. So when we see retail and a lot more interest come back to crypto, I also think options markets will benefit.
00:25:04.090 - 00:25:17.390, Speaker B: Which weren't really, like, huge back in the day. Right. And certainly not prior to 21. Yeah, it wasn't really an option. No pun intended. Kelly, I wanted to ask you about a couple of other things. I know you're very active in a Dow boys club.
00:25:17.390 - 00:25:18.130, Speaker B: What is that?
00:25:18.200 - 00:25:46.614, Speaker A: Yeah, boys club is many things. It's a dao. The founding team, Dina, Natasha Parker, others have built it over the past few years. It's really a community to bring sort of less heard voices on the Internet and in crypto to light. So they host a podcast, they have a newsletter. All are very funny, digestible, talking about some of the key topics in crypto. Web three Internet.
00:25:46.662 - 00:25:51.350, Speaker B: There's some real meme lords over there. I mean, this is like a pretty based meme lord.
00:25:51.510 - 00:26:11.810, Speaker A: There was a tweet that they are responsible for keeping crypto fun in the bear market, and honestly, they do a very good job of it. They're hosting an in person conference during south by Southwest in Austin, which should be really cool, focusing on sort of consumer applications. So they're doing a lot, they're building a lot, and it's a great thing to be a part of.
00:26:11.880 - 00:26:25.030, Speaker B: I want to say right here that I'm very. And even though I have pressed this to you and boys club, I'm very, very upset that they have not adopted the song boys club by wean as their main theme song. It's an absolutely incredible song. I don't know.
00:26:25.100 - 00:26:29.394, Speaker A: Well, Alex, it's a dao. I welcome you to write the proposal to get that passed.
00:26:29.442 - 00:26:29.926, Speaker B: I'm going to write.
00:26:29.948 - 00:26:30.582, Speaker A: We would love that.
00:26:30.636 - 00:26:33.074, Speaker B: It's an incredible song. By the way, everyone should go listen to that song.
00:26:33.122 - 00:26:35.126, Speaker A: Great song. We should play it.
00:26:35.308 - 00:26:40.974, Speaker B: I don't know if we can. I don't think we can get rights. Phineas, are we able to get rights to random songs? I don't think we can.
00:26:41.012 - 00:26:43.866, Speaker A: We don't want to get a seasoned assist, but it's a good song.
00:26:44.058 - 00:26:48.320, Speaker B: Just look it up on your preferred streaming platform that hopefully you pay for.
00:26:49.410 - 00:26:51.774, Speaker A: Support the artist comment there.
00:26:51.812 - 00:27:15.074, Speaker B: Yeah. Thank you, Faith. I love having you on the show. We'll have you back to talk about positioning and stuff. It's been an exciting time in the market. I mean, what are you looking for? Are you looking for anything? We're obviously watching for the ETF news, I think is the biggest story in crypto markets right now. But how are we feeling through the end of the year, in your mind? If you had to draw a line, put a marker down, plant a flag.
00:27:15.122 - 00:27:23.274, Speaker A: Et cetera, that's what I'm thinking about. I think that Mike and Galaxy have said that we're looking forward to an ETF approval, hopefully before the end of the year.
00:27:23.312 - 00:27:25.594, Speaker B: I think Mike says it's a matter of when, not if.
00:27:25.712 - 00:27:55.122, Speaker A: Definitely. So very excited for that. I do think that brings in a lot of more participation in spot markets, and we could see that then fuel this sort of price activity that we've been anticipating off of the options positioning. Outside of that, interesting developments in the DFI space like Dydxv four and things like that. But it's all about the ETF right now, outside of unlocks and other things.
00:27:55.176 - 00:28:19.706, Speaker B: The other thing, too is we're in lower Manhattan here. He who shall not be named criminal trial has begun a few minutes from our office. And actually I'm talking about Sam Bankman Fried, not the former president, who I believe is also having a trial, lower Manhattan in the same court, same court building. Are people following that? Are counterparties, like chit chatting about, like, because there's a lot of little news coming out.
00:28:19.728 - 00:28:28.638, Speaker A: Michael Lewis's book, a lot of chatter on the. Some of the Twitter folk have summarized the book, and it's not good. It's not good.
00:28:28.724 - 00:28:30.938, Speaker B: I think he's an apologist for Sam.
00:28:31.034 - 00:28:34.638, Speaker A: Yeah, primarily, yeah, I haven't read it, but yeah, I have it.
00:28:34.724 - 00:28:54.022, Speaker B: I've only gotten like a few pages because I started reading all the takes. And then I saw his 60 minutes appearance on Sunday where he said, among other things, that if there hadn't been a run on FTX, the business would be doing great. And we're like, what business are you referring to? You mean the business where they just took everyone's money?
00:28:54.076 - 00:29:05.930, Speaker A: It's a painful subject for everyone involved. I honestly am not really a fan of the grave dancing and reading the book and watching the documentaries. We lived through it. It was, and I'm ready to move on.
00:29:06.000 - 00:29:21.418, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. You know what? I'm going to move on, too. If our audience wants to hear me be angry about FTX, go back to, like, what, our November 9 episode or something like that. I just ranted for like 35 minutes about it. Well, my friend Kelly Greer from Galaxy trading, thank you so much for joining us on Galaxy brains.
00:29:21.434 - 00:29:22.640, Speaker A: Thank you for having me.
00:29:24.290 - 00:29:29.406, Speaker B: Let's go now to our friend Tyler Williams, head of public policy at Galaxy Digital. Welcome back to Galaxy Brains.
00:29:29.438 - 00:29:32.802, Speaker D: Tyler, thank you. Alex, good to see you again. Thanks for having me back.
00:29:32.856 - 00:29:58.266, Speaker B: Yeah, I love having Tyler on, and especially when there is dysfunction in Washington, which is very common, but a huge shakeup happening in Washington this week, of course, with Speaker Kevin McCarthy cutting a deal essentially with the Democrats to keep the government funded over the weekend and then being ousted as speaker earlier this week. Tell us what happened.
00:29:58.368 - 00:30:48.970, Speaker D: I mean, if you hit the nail on the head last weekend, it was sort of right up against the time frame of keeping the government funded. McCarthy cut a deal to keep the government open and funded for a 45 day period of time, which gets us to, I think, November 17. And then in the course of doing that, he met the political fate that he probably knew he was going to encounter at some point in time when he went through the speakership election, which was giving the authority or the ability to one individual member to file a discharge petition to remove him from his job despite the fact that he enjoys or he enjoyed, excuse me, very close to like 95, 96% of the party's support in Congress. He was fired from his job the other day.
00:30:49.040 - 00:31:02.878, Speaker B: So what, one person could introduce the bill to remove him from the job or whatever, the motion to remove him and the margins just so tight that we can only lose like five votes, basically, and then he loses a job. And that's what happened.
00:31:02.964 - 00:31:55.294, Speaker D: That's right. There was a privileged resolution that was brought in the House for yesterday to basically fire the. Remove the person who was serving in the capacity of the office of the speaker. So that happened. And you're entirely right. There's such thin majority in the House, you can't lose more than three or four people unless you're negotiating some compromise where there's like democratic support for an issue. And that was something that if you watched former Speaker McCarthy's press conference yesterday, he alluded to the fact that his predecessors, both Speaker Boehner and Speaker Ryan, had some type of implicit support that was embedded from then leader Pelosi.
00:31:55.294 - 00:32:02.654, Speaker D: And I think that he hinted at the fact that that wasn't there for him this time, for whatever reasons.
00:32:02.702 - 00:32:33.206, Speaker B: Yeah. It's such a tight congress where they have like 222 votes, Republicans or something, and what, the threshold is 217 to do anything. Yeah, but that means that any defection in your party right now would mean that the Democrats end up electing the speaker, basically. Right. So you need, it's like, it's one thing if you have, of course you have the fringe wings of each party or whatever. Right. They'll always exist.
00:32:33.206 - 00:32:45.906, Speaker B: But if you have a 30 or 40 vote majority, that's always fine. But that gives these far right wingers, I guess in this case or whatever we want to call them, this outside control, outsized control within the broader sort.
00:32:45.928 - 00:32:56.766, Speaker D: Of modern day House Republican conference. If you remember back to the 2010 election cycle when Boehner came in and became the speaker, this was the Tea party, right?
00:32:56.808 - 00:33:00.038, Speaker B: 2010 was the Tea Party, but the.
00:33:00.044 - 00:33:18.090, Speaker D: Tea Party is like sort of the predecessor party to the now Freedom Caucus. And the issue he had was still relevant to those members and it existed, but they had such a healthy majority in the House, it wasn't as big of a factor as it is now.
00:33:18.160 - 00:33:18.538, Speaker B: Right.
00:33:18.624 - 00:33:33.360, Speaker D: And that has dissipated over time, that margin and thus that individual faction within the Republican Party, the Freedom Caucus, has definitely had an outsized impact. And some would say it's good and some would say it's bad. I'm not taking a value position.
00:33:34.290 - 00:33:41.970, Speaker B: It's the reality. Okay, so the big questions are then one, who's going to be the next speaker? Does anyone know?
00:33:42.040 - 00:34:13.494, Speaker D: Zero idea. It's so tough to handicap. I think the people that are obviously out there, you have leaderskalise and you have whip Emmer. Those are the two guys who are in the current sort of upper echelon of leadership. And then you have Elise Stefanik, who is also in leadership as the conference committee chair. And those are sort of the three individuals who are in the upper echelon. Then you have the republican study Committee, which represents sort of the conservative part of the House Republican conference.
00:34:13.494 - 00:34:32.750, Speaker D: And that's Kevin hearns, the chair of that. And then you have these influential committee chairs that people are looking at and speculating whether it's Jim Jordan who has announced his candidacy for speaker, or you have Patrick McHenry, who chairs the financial services committee and is obviously super important to the crypto crowd.
00:34:32.830 - 00:34:35.006, Speaker B: I'm a big fan of Rep. McHenry.
00:34:35.198 - 00:34:43.366, Speaker D: And he's serving in the capacity as the speaker pro tem because he was designated by former speaker McCarthy, which is what?
00:34:43.388 - 00:34:54.278, Speaker B: That's basically the backup speaker. Like for the job of speaker, not for like, it's like the vice president of speakership. He'll gavel it in if the speaker's.
00:34:54.294 - 00:35:08.062, Speaker D: Like, I don't know. See, this is a good question. I haven't really encountered this situation before. So it's unknown whether or not committees can even function, whether or not committees have subpoena power. If there isn't a speaker who's sitting in.
00:35:08.116 - 00:35:12.778, Speaker B: Oh, because is this the first time really a speaker's been ousted, like mid Congress?
00:35:12.954 - 00:35:18.926, Speaker D: That's right. So we don't really have a past precedent to understand what exact authorities the House has.
00:35:18.948 - 00:35:45.706, Speaker B: You just add this to the list of reasons why the rating agencies are downgrading the US. Honestly, we're literally an unprecedented political disorganization. Although I should say I had some Democrat friends who were dunking on the situation on the House Republicans dysfunction. I'm like, well, as dysfunctional as you think they are. You lost to them. You guys both have problems. Okay.
00:35:45.706 - 00:36:03.870, Speaker B: So. Okay, that's one question I want to ask you also. What impact, if any, this change or whom might become speaker might have on crypto policy. Because obviously the House has been foot forward on things like the fit act and the stablecoin hearings and all that. Does this impact that?
00:36:04.020 - 00:36:51.342, Speaker D: It's tough to say right now. I think it depends entirely on who is the next speaker. And I think know in a pie in the sky scenario, like, say, speaker pro tem, McHenry becomes the actual speaker. Then for sure, crypto policy is elevated because he cares a lot about it and has done a lot of work within the House Financial services committee and with the AG committee as well. And it's really important to him. On the other hand, we knew that Chairman McHenry was super important in terms of the broader political discourse and the negotiating authorities because he was the chief lieutenant of former speaker McCarthy. So it's a little bit dynamic of we could Monday morning quarterback at week project, but it really depends on who the speaker is.
00:36:51.396 - 00:36:51.758, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:36:51.844 - 00:38:44.126, Speaker D: I do think that there is some hope that in an optimistic world, if the House republican conference can unify behind an individual and empower that individual with more authority to negotiate and try to build consensus, not only among Republicans but with Democrats, that helps crypto, because then it's truly a nonpartisan issue that can be voted on as a body and less a push as an individual policy priority for republican members, in the other scenario, in which we have a candidate or we have a speaker who is sort of working under the same powers or authorities that McCarthy was, which is a tough job. I don't think anyone would take a normal job. They were instantly able to be able to be fired on the spot despite doing what everyone wants them to do. If that is the path, then I think it's really hard for anything policy wise, to happen, let alone funding the government. So I think that's like the world. That's the strongest reality, unfortunately, where we're living in this base case, where there's a high probability that we have a shutdown in Q four and policy priorities, whether or not it's tax extenders or some type of tax reform, or if it's crypto policy or even if it's something like, people have talked a lot about the cannabis banking bill that was passed out of the Senate banking committee the other day as sort of a policy signal that could be included because it looks like democratic leadership in the Senate wants it and there may be some deal to be had there. Even things like that that seemed bipartisan in the Senate could easily fall off because there is no sort of white space for legislating.
00:38:44.238 - 00:38:50.438, Speaker B: It literally can't even have it. There's dysfunction in the process. Yeah.
00:38:50.604 - 00:39:04.570, Speaker D: At some level, everything in Congress is about fourth grade math. So you have to get to 60 in the Senate and you have to get to 218 in the House. And unless you can do that, it's really hard to get anything done.
00:39:04.640 - 00:39:09.302, Speaker B: Now, can I ask you, is the House able to hire a non member to be speaker?
00:39:09.446 - 00:39:11.354, Speaker D: Yeah, of course. There's nothing in the Constitution.
00:39:11.402 - 00:39:46.786, Speaker B: Has there ever been one? Do we know? I'm not a, well, there's been some talk, as you know, of a certain Republican who's not a member of Congress that maybe asked if he would take that job. That man, he gave a comment on it outside of his criminal trial in New York. That's former President Donald Trump. People have joked or flirted with the idea that he might be asked. And he commented something, know, like, we'll do know. We'll see how we can help or whatever. Can you imagine?
00:39:46.978 - 00:39:50.840, Speaker D: Well, I think Washington would literally implode upon itself.
00:39:51.210 - 00:40:06.350, Speaker B: I mean, this is like, where, what does Elon Musk say? Like, the funniest outcome is the most mean. You almost didn't think it could get funnier, but I can't really imagine anything funnier than Donald Trump wheeling the gavel in the US House while running for president while under indictment.
00:40:06.690 - 00:40:18.094, Speaker D: You remember early in January when former speaker McCarthy was going through his sort of long, protracted process to becoming a speaker. And how many rounds was it? Like 17 or twelve rounds.
00:40:18.142 - 00:40:23.090, Speaker B: Yeah. President Trump was calling, like, Marjorie Taylor Greene and people on the floor. Right.
00:40:23.240 - 00:40:29.874, Speaker D: But you'll remember that President Trump was also a nominee from certain members who were sitting at the time to become.
00:40:29.992 - 00:40:35.846, Speaker B: I didn't realize that was an actual thing, that if he had won, could happen, though. I thought it was more like, you vote for Santa Claus, you write him.
00:40:35.868 - 00:40:58.880, Speaker D: In as a, it's like, it's very, you can, any individual member can nominate anyone that they want to become the speaker. And hypothetically, if that person gets 218 votes, they would become the speaker of the House. That would be a strange world in which second in line to the president was the former president.
00:41:01.090 - 00:41:15.940, Speaker B: There's a lot that's strange about it. Tyler, just before we wrap in general, you talked about the shutdown. Do you think the ods have increased or declined of that November 17 shutdown? Now? It seems like increased now, given the.
00:41:16.790 - 00:41:44.720, Speaker D: Somewhere at the same threshold that we were last weekend. And I think it was really high up until the point where there was a negotiated deal that came to fruition that narrowly averted a government shutdown. It has to be at least in that quartile of risk in the same way it is. I don't think anything has materially changed from last week to this week. The only thing that we have is we don't have a leader in the.
00:41:46.770 - 00:41:56.290, Speaker B: A. There's a lot happening. I always appreciate Tyler, our man in Washington, T Bill Tyler Williams T Will Tyler, thank you so much, as always.
00:41:56.360 - 00:41:57.650, Speaker D: Thanks for having me, Alex.
