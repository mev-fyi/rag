00:00:07.480 - 00:00:46.542, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. I'm back with the wrap, and I've got a special feature. There's a new place for you to go to store your data on bitcoin, thanks to Casey Rodemore. He's our guest, and we'll just break down the topic. Is it good or bad? Will fees be rad? Can you even stop it? Do inscriptions conflict with the mission or the vision? Or are ordinals additive to the overall system? You decide. While I ride on this crazy game Boy beat, I dare you speak and let the words drip and creep. There's a dispute to inspect, some loot to collect who knew about this new use of tap root to detect? Apparently no one and some want you to have no fun.
00:00:46.542 - 00:01:17.190, Speaker A: They say you're lying and tricking the code. They're show guns, but hold on, we're flying close to the flames and we'll unpack it all today on galaxy brains. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmware research of Galaxy Digital. Thank you for listening. We have a great show today. Casey Rodemore, host of SF Bitdevs, bitcoin developers and creator of ordinals, a new way to do nfts and store data on bitcoin that has the community buzzing. He is our guest, and we'll also check in with our friend bin at Abibi, as always, about markets and macro big day to day fed with their rate decision.
00:01:17.190 - 00:01:40.500, Speaker A: We'll get into it, but before we begin, I need to tell you to please refer to the link to the disclaimer on the podcast notes and note that none of the information contained in this podcast represents an investment advice recommendation, offer or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Galaxy Brains, we're ready to go. Let's hop right into it. Let's go now to our friend Bim Netabee from Galaxy Digital trading. As always, my friend, good to see you.
00:01:40.612 - 00:01:41.620, Speaker B: Thank you for having me.
00:01:41.692 - 00:01:55.100, Speaker A: Big day today. Wednesday, February 1. It's not January anymore. Wow. Month two new monthly candle started. The Federal Reserve FOMC, I guess was the meeting today that certainly they put out their decision on rates today.
00:01:55.172 - 00:01:55.444, Speaker C: Whatever.
00:01:55.484 - 00:02:25.158, Speaker B: Yes, the FOMC decision came out today. The Fed hiked rates by 25 basis points. They guided that they are likely to do more hikes in the future. Powell had a press conference as well after the statement was released. I think the press conference was fairly dovish, and the market is interpreting it as dovish. Essentially, he had to acknowledge the fact that the inflation data has started to turn. There are constructive developments in the labor market.
00:02:25.158 - 00:02:42.158, Speaker B: They had employment cost index that came out yesterday that was a little softer. And so there's a lot of things that are suggesting that you have sort of a Goldilocks situation where you have prices coming down and employment not ticking up that high.
00:02:42.246 - 00:02:42.766, Speaker A: Unemployment.
00:02:42.830 - 00:02:52.726, Speaker B: Unemployment picking up that high. And so basically the market and the fed kind of make it seem like Goldilocks is in like really within reach.
00:02:52.790 - 00:02:54.558, Speaker A: It's in reach. The soft landing.
00:02:54.686 - 00:03:23.750, Speaker B: Soft landing, however you want to think about it. And then you couple that with an insane level of under positioning in risk assets. I mean, I was telling guys this on the floor, but you're talking about trillions of dollars that are defensively positioned, that all of a sudden the world's most important central banker, the most important central banker basically gave you a green light to buy risk assets today. Does he think that? He knows it.
00:03:23.822 - 00:03:24.374, Speaker A: He knows it.
00:03:24.414 - 00:03:39.630, Speaker B: He knows it. They're too smart. They watch the price action. They know when he walked into the press conference today, he had a decision to make. Do I get so aggressive enough where I try to take stocks down?
00:03:39.662 - 00:03:41.750, Speaker A: Yeah, like mean talk following a soft raise.
00:03:41.822 - 00:04:09.182, Speaker B: But he got asked a question about stocks. Literally, it was the first, they were rich. And at the moment it wasn't that. It was like, I don't forgot the exact specifics, but it was basically like, financial conditions are easing. That's counterproductive to your goal of slowing down inflation. How are you thinking about them? And basically you gave like a nonchalant answer that monetary policy works a little lag monitoring a number of things, and we'll see how that stuff develops. So essentially he didn't take the opportunity to be like, no, stocks need to be like 5% low.
00:04:09.182 - 00:04:10.166, Speaker B: They'll never say that.
00:04:10.230 - 00:04:12.438, Speaker A: But he said something very bad at the previous one. Yeah.
00:04:12.486 - 00:04:25.446, Speaker B: Basically a reporter in two FOMC meetings ago, I believe, told him that stocks and bonds were rallying during the meeting. And he proceeded to literally talk through like five talking points about why stocks and bonds shouldn't, shouldn't be rallying.
00:04:25.510 - 00:04:25.998, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:26.126 - 00:05:09.722, Speaker B: And so there's a very different tone. You could tell that there was definitely a change, not a pivot, but a movement along towards Goldilocks soft landing and less hawkish rhetoric. And you could see it not only in the text and what he's actually saying, but his demeanor, how he was thinking about inflation. The tone was just so different. It's really tough to appreciate these things unless you are a consistent follower, but markets don't like, they're ripping like crazy. Nasdaq's up 3% here. We had some company earnings that were reported after the bell today and stocks will only continue to rally thereafter.
00:05:09.722 - 00:05:56.934, Speaker B: I mean, bitcoin as we speak is testing 23 800 and I think this move probably has some more room to run. I'm thinking probably something along lines of like 4300 in s and p, 150 plus points away. Probably at least 25k on bitcoin. I don't even know where the offer side is on bitcoin. Who on earth would be selling risk assets right now when the majority of the world's money managers are underweight risk assets and they're being told to buy them by the most important central bank? Why is there an offer on that unless you're taking profit? So I'm about as bullish as I've been on however scale you want to.
00:05:56.974 - 00:05:58.246, Speaker A: At least in the last several months.
00:05:58.310 - 00:06:02.982, Speaker B: Yes. I mean, basically the number one rule in markets is don't fight the Fed.
00:06:03.078 - 00:06:05.022, Speaker A: And the Fed is telling you what to do here.
00:06:05.038 - 00:06:15.798, Speaker B: The Fed is like, they didn't tell you to sell stocks, which means you have to buy them because if you're not long it, you're short it in my head at least.
00:06:15.846 - 00:06:16.198, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:16.286 - 00:07:12.102, Speaker B: And the way I would describe it is basically you have every single person that's investing assets in the world looking at their portfolios today and looking at, holy shit, am I long? The stuff that's been moving up the most. And the answer is, I'm not long enough of that stuff. If you're a bond manager and you have liabilities going out ten plus years and you're sniffing that, the Fed might be slowing down or cutting, and you're like, oh my God, this might be my last opportunity to buy bonds on a four handle. Oh my God, this might be my last opportunity to buy bonds on a three handle. If you miss that opportunity now, it will cost you for decades to come. If you're a reserve manager buying long dated stuff, long dated stuff, like the ten year bonds can go from 340 to like 250. So quickly? So quickly.
00:07:12.158 - 00:07:12.774, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:12.934 - 00:07:36.120, Speaker B: And if you miss that and you're a huge bond manager, that's your whole job. Yeah, you had one job, one job, and that's to buy bonds when they were reasonably cheap. Because what have we known about bonds is they were in a 40 year bull market. They only go down. You're going to be hunting for yield in about a year and a half. And if you don't get it now, it's like. And then same thing.
00:07:36.120 - 00:07:59.564, Speaker B: It's like there's so many trades. Like, everyone on the planet got long dollars last year and it's still overweight dollars. And they're trying to get into trades like long euro or short dollar yen, and you're just not getting the opportunities. I mean, euro is, I think, testing like 110 right now. You got bank of England that's about to be hawkish tomorrow. Like, it could be a 112 by the end of the week. And you're a reserve manager that put all your money in dollars, and you haven't twitched yet.
00:07:59.564 - 00:08:14.484, Speaker B: And the magnitude and the pace of these moves are going to catch people offsides, I think, for me, keep it simple. Buy risk assets. Buy convexity in risk assets. And, yeah, it's time.
00:08:15.184 - 00:08:40.884, Speaker A: Wow. It's come a long way. I mean, we were talking, I remember us talking in June. You said you were, you hadn't been this bearish in a long time. Then you got bullish in July. Then we've sort of been, you know, trucking along here through the fall, which, you know, in crypto had idiosyncratic events that impacted it. Bitcoin and ETH ran all of January, sort of like almost a reversion to where they should have been.
00:08:40.884 - 00:08:42.720, Speaker A: And you think there's still room to run.
00:08:42.832 - 00:08:55.966, Speaker B: Absolutely. It's just a simple function of, like, what does risk reward look like in these assets? You look at bitcoin, if it's floored at 20k, you are like 15% from 20k.
00:08:55.990 - 00:08:56.502, Speaker C: This is the downside.
00:08:56.558 - 00:09:24.382, Speaker B: This is the downside. Are you going to go short it, try to make 15% on an asset that has no upside, and it's already down a lot. It's already down a lot. What are you going to do then at 23k, you're like, this is an asset that's traded at 68k before it's risk on. Whoa. And then you're like, okay, what's been doing? Well this year? Bitcoin's up 40%, has one of the best risk adjusted returns out there. It trades over $30 billion a day.
00:09:24.382 - 00:09:28.154, Speaker B: Deeply liquid spot and derivatives. Market like shit.
00:09:29.014 - 00:09:29.846, Speaker A: Should be on the radar.
00:09:29.870 - 00:09:42.230, Speaker B: There are people probably freaking out right now, and I'm using the pg words to it, especially anybody that's in crypto world that's benchmarked to an index that is crypto. Full crypto, no cash in it.
00:09:42.262 - 00:09:42.874, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:43.614 - 00:09:47.578, Speaker B: Most people are underperforming. It couldn't have been full length, or.
00:09:47.626 - 00:09:48.946, Speaker C: You'Re not gonna be levered at the.
00:09:48.970 - 00:09:49.437, Speaker B: Start of the year, you're not gonna.
00:09:49.437 - 00:09:52.562, Speaker A: Be all bitcoin and ETH, you know, even the alts.
00:09:52.618 - 00:09:57.570, Speaker B: But still, like, if you're, like, measuring your returns versus stuff, like, you're underweight.
00:09:57.682 - 00:09:58.282, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:58.418 - 00:10:00.938, Speaker B: You're forced to chase here. You're a dip buyer.
00:10:01.026 - 00:10:02.794, Speaker A: Yeah. Interesting.
00:10:02.834 - 00:10:33.054, Speaker B: I mean, I think stuff's on the wrong handles. I gotta calm down. It is a big day and, like, you know, you have to remember rules and try not to get emotional. Like, buying at the highs is normally a very stupid thing in markets, especially in mean, reverting ones. But I have to say, this does feel a bit different. You are taking out significant resistance levels and support levels in traditional markets. The breaks are there, the catalyst is there.
00:10:33.054 - 00:10:43.654, Speaker B: That's all you need. All of markets really comes down to a chart and a story and both of those things looking good right now.
00:10:44.314 - 00:10:47.698, Speaker A: Bimnadabibi from Galaxy Digital trading. As always, my friend, thank you so much.
00:10:47.746 - 00:10:48.330, Speaker B: No problem.
00:10:48.442 - 00:10:59.986, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, Casey Rodemore, open source development, creator of ordinals on bitcoin inscriptions. These new. I'm going to call them nfts, but he's going to correct me, I'm sure. Casey, welcome to the show.
00:11:00.170 - 00:11:09.658, Speaker C: Thank you very much. I'm really happy to be here. I'm a huge fan of the pod. Very happy to hear that. You know, maybe the Alex Thorne wraps are going to be showing up on chain. Who?
00:11:09.706 - 00:11:19.770, Speaker A: Yeah, you know, we can't confirm it yet, but it is possible if you go to ordinals.com where you can inspect these bitcoin nfts, these digital artifacts. These digital artifacts.
00:11:19.802 - 00:11:20.938, Speaker C: Not just nfts.
00:11:21.026 - 00:11:30.254, Speaker A: Thank you. These digital artifacts. Yeah. I don't think anyone has uploaded an mp3 yet there, but, you know, that could happen.
00:11:31.714 - 00:11:40.450, Speaker C: I wonder. I think there maybe are some. There's so many now. I mean, not so many. There's like 500 or something. But if you keep hitting previous on the inscriptions page.
00:11:40.482 - 00:11:41.194, Speaker A: I gotta go in and look.
00:11:41.234 - 00:11:41.914, Speaker C: I think.
00:11:42.074 - 00:11:42.346, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:42.370 - 00:11:49.648, Speaker C: Cause I think that, yeah, there was a couple maybe, like, songs about bitcoin. I think there's a sea shanty about bitcoin. Oh, sick. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:11:49.776 - 00:11:51.936, Speaker A: Those sea shanties are so young.
00:11:52.040 - 00:11:56.568, Speaker C: But the memes are already very strong. The memeing potential is enormous.
00:11:56.656 - 00:12:12.752, Speaker A: It really is. And people are putting. They put some iconic Udi Wertheimer tweets up there. There's some bitcoin punks, it looks like, that are getting made. I saw some other collection I don't know the name of, but clearly it's a collection that's being put up. There's plenty of, like, true one of ones. There's text.
00:12:12.752 - 00:12:14.364, Speaker A: The rare pepes are back.
00:12:14.764 - 00:12:34.876, Speaker C: Direct purpose are back. Yeah, it's really hard for me to tell what's original and what is, like, a copy or a derivative. There is definitely a lot of copies of things. People just uploading old stuff. So, you know, if you see something, it doesn't necessarily mean that the person who made it uploaded it. Yeah, but it's. It's wild things.
00:12:34.876 - 00:12:52.276, Speaker C: This has been exploding. Like, I thought we were going to do this mainnet release. I think it was like January 20, maybe. And then some people would, like, you know, use it and, like, a dog would bark off in the distance, and then we would, like, go back to, like, just grinding in the open source salt mines, you know, for, like, more features.
00:12:52.340 - 00:12:53.036, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:12:53.220 - 00:13:22.818, Speaker C: But it basically has been completely insane. And I think part of that is like, this sort of, like, quote unquote, controversy over, like, how it's been being used. And, I mean, one thing is, like, when I first saw some people criticizing the project, I was like, oh, like, I feel bad. Like, people don't like me on the Internet. And then I realized that they were, like, blasting out the project to their, like, hundreds of thousands of followers. And now, like, you know, I just embraced the haters. I want to deal with the criticism.
00:13:22.818 - 00:13:35.946, Speaker C: There's a lot of, you know, people have reasonable concerns, but, yeah, just a hint. Like, if you don't like it, don't mention to your hundreds of thousands of followers that you shouldn't put monkey jpegs in the blockchain because they might do just that.
00:13:36.090 - 00:13:42.894, Speaker A: Yeah, it's. It's. It's the streisand effect, I guess. And I completely agree. I think it's. And we're gonna. We'll take it back.
00:13:42.894 - 00:14:00.878, Speaker A: You know what? Let's step back for our audience. Let's explain what we're really talking about here. So I'll set it up, but then you take it from there. Casey. So there is now a way that was not previously possible. And we'll talk about why. To store arbitrary data on bitcoin in larger amounts than had previously been possible.
00:14:00.878 - 00:14:35.888, Speaker A: Large enough amounts on chain for things like images and documents. Right. Casey, who built ordinals, which is this way to do that? These inscriptions, they're called, has. It's gotten a lot of, it's gotten a lot of discussion in the community over the last week and a half or so because it's a new use for bitcoin, but it also perhaps was an unintended use and byproduct of the taproot upgrade. And that's causing some controversy. But before we get into the controversy and the sort of big ideas, tell us again what it works, what it is and how it works, Casey. Sure.
00:14:35.976 - 00:15:21.502, Speaker C: Yeah. So there's basically two layers to ordinals and inscriptions. So the lower layer is ordinals, or the ordinal protocol, or ordinal theory, which I call it when I'm, like, kind of being tongue in cheek. And ordinal theory is just a convention for numbering individual satoshis in the order in which they are mined and then tracking them across transactions. This is a purely opt in convention. It's a different way of viewing the data that's already on the chain. And so this gives individual sats an identity and lets somebody say, like, oh, I hold this sat and send it to other people, secure it with a private key, send it in a transaction.
00:15:21.502 - 00:16:12.264, Speaker C: And that is sort of the lower level that inscriptions are based on. And the then inscriptions are a way of assigning content to an individual sat. So you include the inscription content, which is basically any file that you can view in a web browser. You include it in the witness, which is this part of a bitcoin transaction. You mine that block, and that content gets assigned to the first Sat in the first output of that transaction. And because the SATs are transferable using the ordinal theory protocol, which is just based on normal bitcoin transactions, it's not a sidechain, it's not a token. You just need to make these kind of, like, you kind of control the order and value of the inputs and outputs to get the sats to line up where you want them to go.
00:16:12.264 - 00:16:51.184, Speaker C: That turns these sats into something that I think the term NFT is very overloaded and very weird. And there are things that people call nfts that are not immutable and that are not decentralized and whatever. So I use the term digital artifacts for inscriptions. And that is just an NFT that is immutable, an NFT that is uncensorable, an NFT that doesn't have, like, security vulnerabilities or, like, a backdoor key. Yeah. So then by making these inscriptions, by inscribing these stats, you can create these digital artifacts, which you can see on ordinals.com. Dot.
00:16:51.804 - 00:17:11.984, Speaker A: Yeah, very cool. And so when you talk about the ordinal theory and the protocol, this ordering of the sats themselves. Right. It's native bitcoin functionality. But I imagine that it's the wallet itself that has to be really used to. I mean, it's not even Utxo selection at this point, right? It's something even more granular.
00:17:12.524 - 00:17:50.822, Speaker C: Yeah, I call it, like, SaT selection or SAT control. And to be clear, this ordinal protocol is not part of the bitcoin base layer. It's really just an accident of the way that bitcoin works that enables you to view it from this lens. And pretty interestingly, I started thinking about this in early 2022. And the reason that I made this thing is I've made digital art in the past, like, generative algorithmic art. And nfts never really appealed to me. But when I started seeing these very cool, creative algorithmic art nfts, I was like, oh, like, okay, this is the kind of stuff that I make.
00:17:50.822 - 00:18:36.068, Speaker C: I should be able to make these. But I couldn't feel good about making Ethereum nfts for a variety of reasons, variety of technical reasons. And so I wanted to create something that was on bitcoin that had sort of these better properties. And so that was when I started thinking about it in early 2022, kind of came up with this ordinals idea because I needed a way to assign. Like, bitcoin doesn't have accounts, it just has utxos, and utxos are created and destroyed, so you need some place for the nfts to, like, live on. So I kind of came up with ordinals to have a place for the nfts to live on, on chain. And then when I finished the idea of ordinals, I thought like, oh, these are like serial numbers for sats.
00:18:36.068 - 00:18:54.564, Speaker C: And then I typed in serial numbers for sats into Google, and I found a post on bitcoin talk from 2012 where somebody described the scheme exactly that I had come up with. So it's not part of the base layer, but in some way, I didn't create the ordinals protocol. I kind of discovered it.
00:18:55.064 - 00:19:21.424, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. It's something that could be done. Let's talk about the witness data, because I think this is, in some ways, perhaps at the core of the controversy. You might have to correct me on this, but there's two main things here, both a taproot and a segwit story. And with taproot, I guess there's a way to encode additional arbitrary data in the witness, in the signature part of the transaction.
00:19:22.924 - 00:20:07.064, Speaker C: Well, the thing is that arbitrary data storage has always been possible on bitcoin. First in op returns and actually inscription content. It goes in the witness, which is a new part of a transaction that was introduced in Segwit. But it would have been possible to do the same thing before segwit, even before Segwit, just more inconveniently and with more limits. Segwit introduced the witness and gave it a discount relative to other parts of the transaction, which is done for a few reasons, but it still had a lot of limitations on the witness. In particular. I believe these were all essentially policy limitations where they couldn't be above a certain size, et cetera.
00:20:07.064 - 00:21:07.000, Speaker C: And then Taproot removed those limitations. Now, I think the really important thing to keep in mind about the controversy is that these limitations on Segwit witnesses and on pay to script hash scripts beforehand were not put in place to limit the amount of data that could go into a transaction. They were there for other technical reasons. For example, I know for sure that the early limit on pay to script hash scripts, which would have been another way to store data that was there due to this exponential increase in the cost of processing a transaction when you had a very large transaction with very many inputs. And so that limit was there, among other reasons for that. And there were a whole bunch of other reasons to have those limits. But those eventually changes were made to bitcoin that made it safe to remove those limits.
00:21:07.000 - 00:22:04.198, Speaker C: And those limits caused issues, particularly for transaction construction. Imagine you're trying to construct a bitcoin transaction and you have all these goals. You want to send somebody some sats, you want to include something in the script, you want to do some locking stuff. And every thing that could possibly make that transaction invalid is sort of a pitfall that you have to avoid. So these limits were put in place for technical reasons that don't involve storing arbitrary data on chain, and they were lifted because those technical reasons were no longer a worry. And so I don't think it's fair to say that this is coming as a surprise to some people who didn't really understand why those limitations were there in the first place and don't really understand why they were lifted. But if you ask a lot of the bitcoin developers involved with those decisions and how they were thinking about it, they go, oh yeah, people stuffing arbitrary stuff on bitcoin is kind of a fact of life.
00:22:04.198 - 00:22:17.046, Speaker C: We just want to make sure that it doesn't mess up the system in other ways. And we lifted those limitations because the original reasons that they existed simply no longer applied. And those reasons weren't about preventing arbitrary data storage.
00:22:17.110 - 00:22:37.194, Speaker A: I see. Yeah. There's some discussion that I guess the op return field, where you can also store arbitrary data for a transaction, it used to allow a significantly larger amount of data. Right? Like, was it 10,000 bytes at one point? I mean, this is maybe a decade ago. And then it was reduced to 80 bytes, which is, I think, where it currently is.
00:22:37.774 - 00:22:38.222, Speaker C: Yep.
00:22:38.278 - 00:23:06.564, Speaker A: Which is enough to say, store a hash that references some kind of off chain data. That's how omni layer worked, where tether was first issued, counterparty. And I think, and certainly that piece of junk veriblock that was spamming transactions using opereturn for a long time. But putting data in the witness though there is, like you said, no longer a limit. And that's one of the things that enables sort of, I'm going to call it more robust data to be stored.
00:23:06.604 - 00:24:14.320, Speaker C: Bigger data like images, more data cheaper, less gotchas, more more efficient. Yeah. I mean, so one thing about the op return and the controversy there, which is sort of unique to opereturn, is that by default, before people were using operturn, or let me just say, opraturn uses the script pub key is in the script pub key of a transaction, and that is the locking script. And because that output with that locking script has to go into the Utxo set, it means that very large locking scripts are a burden on full nodes because they enter the UtxO set, and the Utxo set needs to be small and fast. And so in order to. So the initial problem is people were encoding data in outputs, and that data was going into the UcXO set. And operturn was sort of like a harm minimization way where when a full node seeds an oper turn, it knows that nobody will ever be able to spend that because it marks that as invalid.
00:24:14.320 - 00:24:57.136, Speaker C: It immediately says can't spend it. And so as a result, full nodes have special code in them that will remove opereturn outputs from the Utxo set, special code that recognizes that template. And they also made it standard up to a certain number of bytes. Bitcoin has these standardist rules that mostly determine what the network will relay, and they made opereturn with up to 80 bytes, a standard transaction type, and added the special code to prune it from the Utxo set. The witness, on the other hand, is input data. It authorizes a transaction for being spent. And so as a result, it has no possibility of entering the Utxo set.
00:24:57.136 - 00:25:36.734, Speaker C: So there's no code that's needed to ensure that these inscriptions don't enter the Utxo set. And also, a lot of people are talking about the fact that the witness gets this discount, the 75% off. And that's because, for a lot of reasons, the witness is very low impact data on the network. It does take up block space, but full nodes basically download it and verify it, and then they never have to look at it again. And when it's buried below a certain height, bitcoin core has this setting called assume valid. Where below that block height, it won't even look at them. It'll just be like, okay, yeah, whatever.
00:25:36.734 - 00:25:53.588, Speaker C: I'm sure they're fine. They're buried by so much work that it's no problem. And so that means that inscriptions will be downloaded by full nodes, but after a certain point, they won't even be. And right now, they're being skipped. They're, like, processed but skipped. They won't even be full nodes, won't even look at them when they're sufficiently valid.
00:25:53.636 - 00:26:21.714, Speaker A: That's one of the criticisms that I've heard and seen on bitcoin Twitter, was that this increases the burden on full nodes. And you're saying because it's not in the Utxo set, it doesn't need to be pruned. It literally isn't in the Utxo set. And also, the nodes still do have to download the block data. But blocks could be full for any number of reasons. This doesn't increase the total possible block size.
00:26:22.174 - 00:27:19.188, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. One very important point is that bitcoin's security model requires that blocks be full. So as the subsidy, the new coins created in every block gets cut in half every four years, we become increasingly reliant on fee revenue to pay for chain security. This is something that, if it were not true that blocks needed to be full, I would be much less cavalier about inscriptions. If there was some future where bitcoin could be secure and blocks could be often empty, then I would say, okay, maybe there is some possibility that inscriptions will increase the expected future size of the chain. But because blocks must be full, it's true that more transactions on bitcoin leads to bigger blocks. But as you zoom out, blocks need to be full anyways.
00:27:19.188 - 00:27:22.620, Speaker C: So this doesn't increase the long term size of the chain.
00:27:22.692 - 00:27:40.638, Speaker A: Yeah, you could be positive on this if you're on the security budget question. The long term bitcoin question. Miners are positive on it already. Of course, they. They want fees. But that. I think one of the criticisms is like, okay, so, you know, nodes still have to download it in the, in the beginning.
00:27:40.638 - 00:28:09.910, Speaker A: And, and there's some bandwidth costs, but to your point, I mean, if we assume blocks have to be full anyway, it's no, it's no premium to that. But should it be getting the Segwit discount? In fact, should the Segwit discount even exist anymore? The witness discount. Why, what, let me start. Why was that added? Because I was looking into this. The best I can tell is that it was just to incentivize people to use Segwit, basically, and theoretically make it cheaper for lightning opens and closes, which you. Segwit.
00:28:10.102 - 00:28:26.678, Speaker C: Yeah, actually, I don't think that that's the case. The discount was added for a few reasons, and I haven't heard, like, incentivize people to use Segwit is one of them. It is one is, there was a desire for a block size increase. So the segwit upgrade was a block size increase.
00:28:26.766 - 00:28:27.140, Speaker A: Right.
00:28:27.222 - 00:29:31.744, Speaker C: And if Segwit data was not given this discount, I mean, we could have kept the block size at 1 mb total by not giving these segwit bytes a discount. And then old nodes would see blocks partially full, and new nodes would see that difference between what the old nodes are and the new nodes saw made up by the witnesses. But so there was a desire for a block size increase. And that's one of the reasons why the witness was given a discount, because it was a way, just a technical hack, to do a block size increase as a soft fork. Another reason was to encourage people to clean up their utxos. So witness data, if you have a transaction, and the more inputs it has, the larger the witness data will be, because for each input, you need a witness. So transactions that are relatively witness heavy are transactions that remove more items from the Utxo set, which decreases the long term burden on full nodes.
00:29:31.744 - 00:30:19.082, Speaker C: So there was to incentivize cleaning up the Utxo set. And certainly they did not intend to incentivize monkey jpegs on the blockchain. But a third reason is that is this low impact, um, aspect of the witness, that it's verified once and it's thrown away, it's not verified at all. Below assumed valid pruned nodes already delete it. And also in the, in the, in the distant future, we might want to do something called witness pruning. And I don't really understand the technical arguments for and against this, but because witness data is sort of separate from the rest of the transaction, and in particular because it's not covered by the transaction hash. We could say, okay, witness data from like ten years ago.
00:30:19.082 - 00:30:44.316, Speaker C: We're just not even. You can boot a full node and it will have a mode where it won't even look at the old witnesses because they're no longer needed. And in that case, it wouldn't download them at all. So it's actually three reasons why the witness discount was given. Technical hack to increase the block size, which was seen as desirable, encourage people to clean up old utxos. And it's low impact. So.
00:30:44.316 - 00:31:05.424, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. So, like, inscriptions definitely don't fit with the spirit of the second one because they don't clean up old utxos. You can stick a lot of rare pepes in a, in an inscription and not clean up any utxos, but they do kind of fit with the second and first, you know, that it's a general block size increase and that it's low impact on the network and on full nodes.
00:31:06.204 - 00:31:22.660, Speaker A: Fascinating. Okay, couple of questions. Let's talk. We'll table some of the. I think the controversy for now may ask you one or two questions more at the end of the interview about that. But let's talk about inscriptions and what your plans are now for ordinals.com. I mean, listeners can go to ordinals.com,
00:31:22.660 - 00:31:45.654, Speaker A: comma or d I dash s.com and see what people are inscribing. You can get all the technical docs and the link to the wallet on GitHub that you can use with your full node to do your own inscribing. Do you have any plans or have you talked to, like, the, the full node, like, self hosted provider, the umbrellas and the my nodes and those guys to make this.
00:31:45.994 - 00:32:11.984, Speaker C: Oh, sure, yeah. And just to be clear, and thank you for showing ordinals.com. Ordinals.com. But that's also the underlying binary. The binary that, like, does everything is a wallet and a block explorer called Ord. And when you go to ordinals.com comma, you're just talking to my copy of ordinary running on a computer somewhere, I think possibly in Helsinki, I don't know, somewhere in Europe, because it's cheaper over there.
00:32:11.984 - 00:32:39.798, Speaker C: You can run that locally and you can see exactly what is on ordinals.com dot like, no different. So I just want to emphasize that it's open source software. It's very decentralized. You just need a full node and you need this binary, and it is command line only. But we're trying as hard as possible to make it easy to run. And so, yeah, that is actually one thing for the future, we want people to run full nodes, and in some future, maybe we want something like a light client.
00:32:39.798 - 00:32:58.854, Speaker C: And you could build a lite client, given the protocol. But I'm very happy that people are running full nodes. A big priority right now is basically just like, tech support. People are like, how bitcoin? And we're like, okay, like, bitcoin D. Let's go. Yeah. And then inscriptions already have a lot of great properties.
00:32:58.854 - 00:33:24.304, Speaker C: So when you go to ordinals.com, you can know that everything you see is immutable, and everything you see is entirely on chain, so you don't need to audit them individually. They're not smart contracts that could have vulnerabilities. You don't need to look where the data is stored. You know, it's on the bitcoin blockchain. And. Yeah, and for future features, we have a lot of stuff that we want to add.
00:33:24.304 - 00:33:57.606, Speaker C: One sort of hole in the feature set is there's really no way of doing collections or a good kind of provenance where you can see, like, who made a collection and what somebody's body of work are. And so we have a design for adding that, where you'll be able to use an inscription as the parent for other inscriptions by making a transaction and linking them, basically. Exactly. Yeah. And then this gives you this tree of inscriptions. So you could make an inscription representing you. And then, like, every week, you could put out the galaxy.
00:33:57.606 - 00:34:23.464, Speaker C: The galaxy wrap, the galaxy brains wrap as an inscription, and people would be able to see that you had made it, and they would be able to know that because the Alex inscription had been used and authorized, that only you could have made that child very cool. And then that's infinite recursion and nesting. And you can do just these trees of inscriptions. So you have many crazy features.
00:34:23.624 - 00:34:40.246, Speaker A: So you can go and see on ordinals.com, the. Someone's been minting a lot of these rare pepes. And I think those are just the old rare pepe images. Right. They're just putting those up. But then they put up an inscription saying it was all text, that was a link to every transaction id and said, like, rare pepe, number one.
00:34:40.246 - 00:34:44.734, Speaker A: Rare pepe. So they're kind of trying to do provenance without your nested hierarchy.
00:34:44.894 - 00:35:04.318, Speaker C: Life finds a way. You know, the users will hack it together. Yeah. And. Yeah, and a lot of this is very much like user driven development. I have random ideas about what I think is important, but ultimately, it's what users want and it's what their, they're running into. One fun thing is that the ordinals.com,
00:35:04.318 - 00:35:46.836, Speaker C: like the protocol, you can put any kind of content you want because they're identified by a content type, also known as a mime type, which is a string of text like image Png, text plain. But there's nothing stopping users from putting whatever kind of content they want. And as users have been uploading new kinds of content, I've been figuring out how to support that in the front end. And so I call these illicit inscriptions. And then somebody inscribed a PDF of the bitcoin white paper and so I had to figure out like, okay, well, for technical reasons we can't sandbox this effectively, so we have to use a JavaScript library to render it. And I wrote that and we pushed the code out. And to be clear, this isn't just me.
00:35:46.836 - 00:36:04.770, Speaker C: There's also a small cadre of dedicated open source contributing dgens. And we got that code up and now you can go that PDF that the person inscribed you now see the preview of the first page when you go to the inscription page, and then you can jump in and get the content.
00:36:04.882 - 00:36:24.364, Speaker A: Yeah, so the data is there. I could download the data, I could use my own way to render it or whatever. The literal bytes are there for the data and the mime type. But yeah, you're saying like on the front end itself, like there wasn't a PDF viewer, right. Or if we put, if someone puts an MP3 up, like you need like an MP3 player to actually play it on the site.
00:36:24.664 - 00:36:51.680, Speaker C: Yeah, you need to notice the content time and be like, ok, this is an image, so it needs to go in an image tag or this is a MP3 and this needs to go in an audio tag. Or for example, this is HTML or SVG, which gets rendered inside of an iframe. And for that we have a lot of weird considerations, like it has to be sandboxed and all that. But yeah, so you're exactly right about how it works.
00:36:51.752 - 00:37:04.296, Speaker A: Cool. A couple other questions. Is it possible to build a decentralized exchange or marketplace for inscriptions? And let's start even before decentralized, let's just say an exchange before ideally decentralized. But could we have an open source?
00:37:04.320 - 00:37:05.680, Speaker C: Let's go right into decentralized.
00:37:05.712 - 00:37:06.400, Speaker A: All right, let's do it.
00:37:06.472 - 00:37:54.388, Speaker C: Let's just go right into decentralized. So actually the technology is not done yet. To be clear, a lot of the stuff I'm talking about is not done, just requires some of the old elbow grease. But because these inscriptions ride on sats and you can do sort of normal bitcoin transactions that transfer one sat to another. You can do atomic swaps from BTC to an inscription. And the way that this will eventually work is you make an inscription that you want to sell, and then you create what's called an offer. And an offer is a partially signed bitcoin transaction that is not valid because it has your inscription on it that goes into one of the inputs and you sign for that.
00:37:54.388 - 00:38:45.240, Speaker C: And also on one of the outputs, you pay yourself, say, one bitcoin. The only way that that transaction could be made valid is by somebody putting their one bitcoin into one of the other inputs, signing for it, and then broadcasting it to the rest of the network. This gives us a really nice primitive that we can use to build basically a decentralized. I don't even know if I should call it a market or an exchange because it's really just, you create these partially signed transactions and then you put them wherever. You post them on Twitter, you post them on Noster, you staple them to a telephone poll, you paste them in discord, et cetera. They can be relayed in any sort of way. In fact, if we really wanted to, Ord could have sort of like a PDP network where they would trade these offer files.
00:38:45.240 - 00:39:17.174, Speaker C: And then the person who is sort of authorized to sell the inscription, who owns the inscription, just completes it and then broadcast it to the bitcoin network. And this is like one really nice thing about ordinals and inscriptions is they really fit in nicely with the rest of bitcoin. So all this existing infrastructure we can leverage, all this stuff about partially signed transactions we can leverage. It's really like, it's kind of like caveman technology. Like it's just the simplest thing that can work. So, yeah, decentralized. Decentralized trades are like trustless offers.
00:39:17.174 - 00:39:21.654, Speaker C: Yeah. Should be coming soon, slash eventually.
00:39:22.034 - 00:39:39.218, Speaker A: Soon. Tm. I love that. I love the use of the pSbt here. I had been just thinking in my head, like, you could maybe with like a DLC, you could get it done. Some kind of. Some kind of multisig escrow with the buyer and an oracle as one and two, and then the seller or somebody comes in as three.
00:39:39.218 - 00:39:50.370, Speaker A: There's definitely ways. I would love to see that. I'd love to see the wallets integrate this, really. I guess it's primarily SAT selection that they had have to integrate to really.
00:39:50.402 - 00:40:29.572, Speaker C: Make this SAT selection, sat control. And then looking at these old transactions. And so the way they have many options for wallets to do it, it's actually not such a heavy lift for existing infrastructure because it's using the normal transactions that they're already processing the normal signatures. For example, we use bitcoin core. The Ord wallet is really just a wrapper around bitcoin core, and we use bitcoin core for all the transaction signing, some transaction construction, transaction broadcast propagation, et cetera. So people with existing bitcoin infrastructure should take a look and see if this is something that they want to support.
00:40:29.708 - 00:41:08.676, Speaker A: Yeah, everyone should definitely give it a shot, first of all, because it's a very, very novel use case on bitcoin. I agree. I am surprised and impressed by the elegant integration with bitcoin, how simple this is. But the people are mad. Luke Dash Junior said that you were lying and tricking the code to make this work, which I find to be quite a humorous statement because the code is the code and you're just using it. And we've seen some other people, frankly, be very upset. They don't want their chain bloated with this arbitrary stuff.
00:41:08.676 - 00:41:13.104, Speaker A: They say, what's your general pushback on that?
00:41:13.684 - 00:42:13.692, Speaker C: I guess my general pushback on those kind of very general criticisms, I'm very happy to. I probably have better answers to more specific criticisms, but those general criticisms that are of the form that bitcoin is not for this don't really do much for me. I think bitcoin is a system, and we should use the system in the way that benefits us, and people should find ways to use it that are good and which don't hurt the system, and that it's not something that's for something or for other people, for some things and not for other things. It's essentially transcended the intentions of its original creator. And I think a lot of the bitcoin devs really see themselves as caretakers and not really sort of people who are going to say what the protocol is used for. So sort of general criticisms of the form, like bitcoin is not for monkey pictures are like, well, I don't know, some people, like the monkey pictures. They want to trade the rocks.
00:42:13.692 - 00:42:19.624, Speaker C: They want to trade the bitcoin rocks. They pay their fees, which kind of indicates that they find these transactions valuable.
00:42:20.254 - 00:42:26.714, Speaker A: The transactions themselves are valid on chain like. They're correctly constructed and they pay their way.
00:42:27.454 - 00:42:28.022, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:42:28.078 - 00:43:00.670, Speaker A: Yeah. I have to say I found the debate to be quite humorous overall, especially over something that is a totally valid use case or use of the network. Right. You didn't break anything, you didn't change, just use the code that was there. But also for something so fun, something that can be so silly by the way we talk about. It's true for nfts in general also, but for inscriptions, like, yes, people are mostly, it looks like, you know, putting jpegs up there, but there could be a lot of other uses for this you could imagine.
00:43:00.742 - 00:43:41.198, Speaker C: I'm really excited. We can do really good support for essentially multi file inscriptions where you make inscriptions and they're just files that the web server can return to you. Then you make other inscriptions which reference the content of those inscriptions. This is not functionality that exists. Again, this is in the sune tm category. But the whole model was really designed to be very compatible with the web. And I think that you're just going to have this on chain library of images and code and HTML and CSS and all these other web resources, and you'll be able to do like collages and remixing.
00:43:41.198 - 00:44:13.894, Speaker C: And if you're doing an inscription and you have a JavaScript library that you need, if that's in an inscription, then other people can use it in the future in their inscriptions. So that's actually what I'm most excited about for myself. As somebody who loves the web, loves web content, loves the browser, and has made a bunch of silly, weird web art, I'm really excited to give a, like a platform where people can explore this very weird new medium.
00:44:15.114 - 00:44:27.774, Speaker A: I really like it. I think it's very exciting. There's a lot of creativity that's clearly going to come from this. We've got to wrap it up here. Casey Rotomore, creator of ordinals and inscriptions on bitcoin. Thank you so much for coming, Casey.
