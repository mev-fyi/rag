00:00:07.720 - 00:00:12.294, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. Bimnet, as always, welcome back to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:12.374 - 00:00:13.342, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:13.438 - 00:00:25.166, Speaker A: So I was away in Austin last week, so I'm a little bit out of the loop. But it seemed like the data is softening the economic data. What are you seeing in the data, and how has the market been reacting? But I guess the first part first.
00:00:25.310 - 00:01:00.108, Speaker B: Yeah, so we've seen the data soften pretty materially in some employment metrics, some price metrics, and other kind of broad sentiment indicators. More specifically, core PCE was the big one. That's the Fed's preferred measure of inflation. It came in at 0.249 for the month of April. That, again, kind of adds to the string of, okay, CPI and NPCE numbers that we've had. And then today you had jolts, which are job openings surprised lower by 300,000.
00:01:00.108 - 00:01:39.566, Speaker B: And you've had things like, indeed, job openings and some other high frequency employment. Market points point to a slowdown in hiring activity and then looking at manufacturing and services. You had ISM manufacturing out yesterday. The price is paid component, the price component of that survey came in soft. So did the new orders. And then the other thing to think about is generally, crude oil is a barometer of broad economic activity, and it dipped a lot. You're trading at like 73, $74 for WTI.
00:01:39.630 - 00:01:41.910, Speaker A: We were up in the eighties. Briefly, we were.
00:01:42.102 - 00:01:58.102, Speaker B: But some of the geopolitical tensions have eroded, and it looks like there's a ton of supply and less demand. And so the prices are reacting accordingly. OPEC, did they, they have price cuts that they're still, they were gonna tighten.
00:01:58.238 - 00:01:59.656, Speaker A: But even in the face of that.
00:01:59.750 - 00:02:42.610, Speaker B: Even in the face of that, yes. And another conspiracy theory thing is Saudi Aramco is doing this huge equity offering. They're trying to sell 15 billion in the open market. So folks have always thought that going into that sale, they want oil a lot higher to get more funds. The point being, you've had a slowdown in the data. It's enough for the market to start pricing in a greater likelihood of cuts happening sooner as well. I think now that you're getting to this point where employment is kind of tilting over a little bit, non farm payrolls on Friday are going to be very important to watch.
00:02:42.610 - 00:03:51.230, Speaker B: But it's also, I think what you really have to think about as an investor is the distribution of outcomes, because when you start cutting, it opens the door for a number of different things. If you start cutting, that means you think that you're supposed to be lowering interest rates. So then the question becomes, what magnitude do you cut? Is your first cut 25? Is it 50? And if you're trying to get rates to a more not too accommodative, but not too restrictive point, which is their goal, you have to think that there's a chance that they just cut two times of 50 basis points. But the odds of them just doing 25 and then 25 and then 25, I think is, you know, I don't think that's likely. But again, like, when you look at what's priced in, you're only seeing the cumulative basis points that are priced in, not necessarily the probability of like a 50 and the probability of a 25. It looks like the weighted average of those probabilities and stuff. So there's some distortions in the interest rate curve.
00:03:51.230 - 00:04:47.824, Speaker B: But I firmly believe that if you do start cutting, they're going to be a little bit more aggressive than the market anticipates. And right now, if you do start to see cracks in the labor market, particularly on this non farm payrolls, I think the market will start thinking about a July or September cut in a more meaningful way. I think you're seeing the setup there then. The last thing I'll mention is last week also brought about significant weakness in some software names. In the US, you had four software and generally electronic computer stuff that those companies gave very poor guidance and those stocks were down like 20% plus. There's a lot of areas underneath the hood of the S and P 500 and the Nasdaq that aren't performing that well. Some of the consumer discretionary names as well have been giving poor guidance.
00:04:47.824 - 00:04:59.316, Speaker B: You're also seeing the FDIC had a report out last night talking about banking health, and they think that more banks are in trouble than their last quarter report is.
00:04:59.340 - 00:05:04.196, Speaker A: Yeah, I think they have that 63 banks or something like that from somewhere in the fifties.
00:05:04.300 - 00:05:45.214, Speaker B: Yeah. And the mark to market losses on those portfolios are increasing. And the banks that are now part of that stress category are banks that have higher assets on average than the ones that were there before. And so there's an element of, like, there's pockets of stress in banking, commercial real estate. You're seeing uptick in non performing loans, credit card write offs. You've seen material weakness and things like used autos and stuff. And so I really do think that you're starting to hit that soft patch of data and that it will mean that the Fed is going to get more comfortable with cutting sooner rather than later.
00:05:45.214 - 00:05:53.224, Speaker B: And I think once that seeps into the market, I think the market's going to be very aggressive in terms of, you know, pricing in that rate path.
00:05:53.564 - 00:06:36.226, Speaker A: You know, everyone in the January was calling for what set the market had priced seven cuts this year, but the data didn't support that. And you were very critical of the market. You said market, dear mister market, you are wrong. The data is not nearly soft enough to justify that. Why would the Fed use this now? And now, I can't believe it's already, it's been six, well, I guess it's been five full months. We're in the 6th month and it really does feel like there's, and we're going to this summer, which is a slower and not in all facets of the economy, but it certainly feels slower. And you think now is this, does it, are we turning or it's the perennial question, or is this in between the two peaks? Yeah, no, I, because inflation is still pretty stubborn here.
00:06:36.226 - 00:06:36.530, Speaker A: Right.
00:06:36.602 - 00:07:25.784, Speaker B: You know, ultimately, like, we're not, the Fed can't solve the fiscal issue. Government is still spending a ton of money and I think they're going to be inclined to have more stimulative measures in place before the election. And so I think the risk of reflation is always there. Geopolitical risks can take commodity prices higher and there's still just so much money washing around in the system. But right here, right now, I think I feel comfortable letting my foot off the gas. But the other constraint that we always talk about is just the debt, and the debt's just so not sustainable at these levels of interest rates, rates and stuff. And so everyone at the Fed or Powell himself has an incentive to bring rates lower even at the risk of reflation.
00:07:25.784 - 00:08:23.962, Speaker B: So yeah, I think right here, right now, it's leaning towards that softer path. But ultimately, the policy responses that monetary folks or central bank officials have and the fiscal response function that people have to a weakening economy is inflationary. So you cut rates for more folks, start to think about buying houses, housing becomes a little bit more affordable. That might lead to more supply coming into the market, but it also might mean that people are more aggressive with buying, might raise asset prices. And so when you bring in easing, you do bring about some reflation risk. And if people are losing their jobs aggressively because of AI or cause of some other random thing, the government's gonna be like, oh, okay, unemployment benefits, we got to jack that up. Earned income tax credit, all these social safety nets and stuff.
00:08:23.962 - 00:08:38.814, Speaker B: As the economy deteriorates, it's like where's my stimulus and that's inflationary. But I guess it really does come down to the election right now because there's just a lot of paths just lead to who's going to end up being president.
00:08:39.594 - 00:08:47.407, Speaker A: Cause you're not going to change that much with new policy on the ground in the economy between June and November, right?
00:08:47.455 - 00:08:50.639, Speaker B: Not likely, not likely. But if you're desperate, you might.
00:08:50.711 - 00:08:51.695, Speaker A: Yeah, we might try, but.
00:08:51.719 - 00:08:53.527, Speaker B: We might try, but it's hard for.
00:08:53.535 - 00:08:57.159, Speaker A: The real outcomes, though. We're still, they take longer than that to materialize.
00:08:57.191 - 00:09:07.295, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, realistically, like for Congress or president to enact something that hits people's wallets by the time of the election. Like it takes a while. Like even if, right.
00:09:07.319 - 00:09:11.215, Speaker A: Even if you pass something or do enact something besides, like the mailing the.
00:09:11.239 - 00:09:14.102, Speaker B: Checks directly to people, everything else once.
00:09:14.118 - 00:09:52.304, Speaker A: In a while, they're still spending PPP loans, they're still spending the infrastructure bill money. The states, a lot of that money was pushed out of states that haven't actually spent it yet either, which has contributed to some of the stubbornness. Let me ask you a question about the fixed income and the treasuries. There's an index that I follow that has just been down bad, down 50% or something over a couple of years of us treasuries. When do these become a buy in your mind, or do we. I think it's almost consensus to consensus, or at least on social media and stuff that you don't want to own treasuries like, oh my gosh, look at the fiscal situation.
00:09:52.384 - 00:09:53.096, Speaker B: I think it really does.
00:09:53.120 - 00:09:54.608, Speaker A: This has to reverse at some point, right?
00:09:54.656 - 00:11:02.944, Speaker B: Yeah. So your question really comes down to like, what point in the curve are you buying or thinking about buying? Is it the back end, which is, let's say, seven years in greater 1030? Yeah, that type of stuff. Or is it front end? Focus, zero to five. And I think zero to five for cash allocation is totally reasonable. But if you're thinking about any time of greater duration, I would not touch long end bonds with a ten foot pole because you just think about what has inflation averaged over the past three, four years in real terms to you, those bonds are not going to keep up with where inflation is going to realize over time and like asset values. And so your best hedge for protecting your purchasing power of dollars is not buying ten year treasuries at 432 in yield when implied inflation is only like two and a half percent. There are just better ways to store money.
00:11:02.944 - 00:11:52.784, Speaker B: And so I'm just not a fan of owning long end treasuries, and it's really, this is a concept for a later podcast, but essentially the US is engaged in synthetic yield curve control. A lot of other economies, they will do it overtly. Like the Japanese, when they had yield curve control on their tenure point, they would buy bonds if the yield surpassed a certain level, right? And they would fix that ten year point at a specific point. In the US, they do it a little bit differently now. They manage the back end of the treasury curve via regulations, via treasury policy as well. In terms of when Yellen decides what point of the curve to issue, she's going to be like, okay, this thing is breaking down in price. I'm not going to sell more of these than I really have to.
00:11:52.784 - 00:12:56.588, Speaker B: Then you've got the treasury buyback operations as well, which is a way of cash managing, but it's also a way of just managing the liquidity. It's also like the Fed has an ongoing mandate to have market open operations in case stuff starts to trade crazy. And then you've got the ultimate way that they guide it, which is inflation expectations. They pay attention to where breakevens are priced and where the market thinks inflation is going to be. And they tell people what they forecast in their summary of economic projections, where they think inflation is going to be, the long run dots are going to be. And they try to keep that back end anchored at a reasonable level. Mechanisms, not all of which I've stated, but they synthetically try to manage the yield curve so that it doesn't like get out of hand, aka it's not really reflective of the true price of ten year credit risk to the us government net of inflation expectations.
00:12:56.588 - 00:13:30.314, Speaker B: It's just that point in the curve, there's no value in it for me. Some would argue that we're headed into crazy deflation, economy is going to downtick, et cetera. But everything I know about governments and central banks tells me that they are trying to kick the can down the road. That is their natural inclination. They are going to push things as far down as possible, which ultimately is going to be inflationary. And I couldn't justify owning that paper personally.
00:13:30.394 - 00:13:35.444, Speaker A: I hear you. Well, we got what, CPI next week and FOMC the week after.
00:13:35.524 - 00:14:38.192, Speaker B: And the most important thing though, coming up is non farm payroll this Friday and you're starting. So the JOLTS data, for example, today had weakness in healthcare and some hospitality stuff. But essentially those are components that have been really strong in non farm payrolls. And so I'm expecting to see some weakness in the NFP data. But again, so much of this data is just like how much of it do you really believe and how much weight do you put on it? Because more than ever there's just distortions, like how many jobs are created every time a sole proprietorship is created, like the birth death ratio and stuff and the sampling and how come all the revisions are always, there's a lot of doubt around the data. But if you look at the high frequency stuff, the indeed job data, the jolts opening data like it's pointing to weaker.
00:14:38.248 - 00:14:38.912, Speaker A: Yep.
00:14:39.088 - 00:14:40.648, Speaker B: So I think we'll come in soft.
00:14:40.696 - 00:14:54.808, Speaker A: All right, so NFP this week, Friday, CPI next week, FOMC the week after, is that right? Middle of June? I believe so, yeah, I think so too. And we'll be here to see what happens.
00:14:54.896 - 00:14:55.682, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:14:55.808 - 00:14:57.734, Speaker A: A BB from galaxy trading, my friend. Thank you so much.
