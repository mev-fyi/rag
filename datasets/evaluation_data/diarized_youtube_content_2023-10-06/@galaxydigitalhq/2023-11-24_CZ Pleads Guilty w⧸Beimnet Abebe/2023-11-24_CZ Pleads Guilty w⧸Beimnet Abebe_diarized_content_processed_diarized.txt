00:02:40.514 - 00:02:41.802, Speaker A: Welcome to galaxy brains.
00:02:41.898 - 00:02:42.706, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:02:42.770 - 00:02:59.624, Speaker A: It's been an exciting week. Before we get into some topics, and by the way, we have no other guest this week, so we're going a little longer with BiMnet than usual as a Thanksgiving day special. Before we get into some of the other topics, we're gonna talk about what's been going on in macro since last week. Anything notable to talk about?
00:02:59.714 - 00:03:46.858, Speaker B: Yeah, the main thing that I've been kind of focusing on is kind of the weakness in the dollar. Structurally. We've been in a dollar bull market basically since the Fed started raising rates. But now that they've kind of signaled that they are most likely done with hiking, we've seen a major reversal in the dollar. The two big ones that I've been paying attention to has been dollar China. That's come off a lot, and dollar yen, obviously, we were talking about currency intervention a couple of weeks ago, and is the Japanese, are they going to move aggressively off yield curve control or not? But long story short, you've seen an aggressive move in the dollar. Dollar yen has gone from 151 and change to 147 and change.
00:03:46.858 - 00:03:49.050, Speaker B: And that's a big move in g ten FX.
00:03:49.122 - 00:03:49.642, Speaker A: That's a lot.
00:03:49.698 - 00:04:32.434, Speaker B: And it signals that the market does believe that the Fed's likely done. You've also seen decent moves in G ten FX and things like table and euro off the lows. I think when you pair that with the market reaction you've had recently in the rate market, I think it's appropriately justified. Two s have been consistently below 5%, and you've seen the backend take out significant technical levels. 450 was a big technical level. On ten s, you're trading at 441 now. And so the pressure of the back end supply and back end bonds breaking has abated a bit as well.
00:04:32.434 - 00:05:10.634, Speaker B: And so what you've seen is a turn in the dollar and a turn in rates. And that's been a function of a turn in Fed signaling and a turn in the data that we've seen. And I think given the current levels, I think market pricing is kind of fair. But you've got over 100 basis points of cuts priced in over the next twelve months or so, and that's a lot. But in terms of what we're seeing in the data right now and what we're likely going to see in the data going forward, I think that market reaction is probably appropriate.
00:05:11.134 - 00:05:38.770, Speaker A: So it's just an ongoing story too. And nothing, I wouldn't say this sounds similar to what you've been saying, whereas we sort of that structural shift we've talked about really happened a couple of weeks ago, correct? Yeah. What about cryptocurrency markets? I mean, we've been, I mean, I think here we are basically thirty seven k at bitcoin. You know, I mean a rising channel clearly like higher lows but, but not breaking out since our, since we did break out.
00:05:38.842 - 00:05:39.522, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:39.698 - 00:05:43.090, Speaker A: Altcoins, what, rotated a bit but now also cooling off.
00:05:43.242 - 00:06:06.144, Speaker B: Absolutely. Yeah. So I think in crypto, the, the bull trend is still in place, as you've said, higher and higher lows, like moving, average support holding, and you're setting marginally higher highs. High level. I love bitcoin. I think it's going higher. It's going to go trade at new all time highs eventually.
00:06:06.144 - 00:06:44.182, Speaker B: But the indicators that I look for in a market being stretched are definitely being ticked off. Sorry, overbought on a lot of technical indicators. Funding having gotten elevated, volume having gotten elevated, spot being at local highs, meme tokens pumping like crazy and alt pumping like crazy. And so those checkboxes for a trade being stretched have been hit. Right. And so I think what you're really seeing now in crypto is really just still a lack of sellers. Right.
00:06:44.182 - 00:07:33.994, Speaker B: If you really believe in the bitcoin story, if you really think we're going to add billions of dollars in Aum to these new ETF products eventually, and that the halving is going to create a huge supply shock, there's no reason to really get out at 37,000. And if you just think about the perspective of most investors, right, everybody that's been involved in crypto is averaged in overtime. Some people bought at 10,000, at 20, at 30, 40, 50, 60, etcetera. A lot of people have blended averages that are around here. And so why are you really going to sell, going into a big catalyst event? And also, if you believe that central banks are turning, which they are. Right. Europe is continuing to have weak data.
00:07:33.994 - 00:08:06.914, Speaker B: China is having weak data. Us has likely stopped hiking turn happening with central bankers. And typically when central bankers turn, that's your signal to buy risk assets, largely speaking like asset prices. I'm not saying everything's a ponzi, but there's a lot of, let's say, froth in the market. And the question is with the fed, are they trying to get rid of that froth, or are they okay with the current level of froth and the conditions? And they told you they're okay with that level of froth, right?
00:08:06.954 - 00:08:10.146, Speaker A: Cause they're really focused on employment and on inflation.
00:08:10.250 - 00:08:28.442, Speaker B: Yeah, but here's the thing. They're traders as much as anyone else. They get a negative payrolls print, right? People start losing jobs. And the headlines start to be about, oh, people are losing jobs, they're struggling. Seems like, oh, there's more job losses ahead. Housing market starts to crack a little.
00:08:28.458 - 00:08:30.186, Speaker A: Bit, they will be so quick to.
00:08:30.210 - 00:09:12.570, Speaker B: Flinch that people will have no idea what hit them. Because at the end of the day, they are supposed to be independent and supposed to engage in monetary policy in a way that's not short term thinking, but long term cold and academic. And academic. But when people start losing jobs, it's a big deal. And that's when they hear it from every single person. And that's what hits home the most. And the other thing to keep in mind is that recovery in the economy and just the way the US is structured right now, it's a tale of two cities, right? The lower income brackets.
00:09:12.570 - 00:10:34.726, Speaker B: You've already started to see such a material downturn in some of the important metrics that you think about, right? The credit card delinquencies for folks, the auto delinquencies, the portion of money they have to spend on rents, and God forbid you throw in a weak labor market on top of that and people start getting laid off aggressively, there's gonna be a ton of folks that are just so uncomfortable. And is it the Fed's mandate to really think about that lower income stuff they've told you? Yes. Before they did a major shift in their economic policy a couple years ago where they're like, oh, we want the recovery to be broad based. We wanna look at measures like hispanic unemployment, african american unemployment, all of these things. So they have a history of having a qualitative approach as well as a quantitative approach to engaging in monetary policy. So when you start to see layoffs, aggressive ones, and not labor unions getting 40% raises, I think the turn is going to be much more dramatic than people anticipate. And so, long story short, cutting rates and the treasury being less aggressive with back end supply and inflation, that's not ripping higher is going to be constructive for risk assets.
00:10:34.726 - 00:10:43.742, Speaker B: And basically it's just. And then you throw in the fiscal dominance side, there's going to be lots of reasons why you'd want to own bitcoin.
00:10:43.918 - 00:10:44.834, Speaker A: Understood.
00:10:45.574 - 00:11:16.064, Speaker B: And so, yeah, I mean, this asset is just set up so well to move higher, especially once in ETF launches and you get the Fed turn at some point next year in a much more aggressive way. Things like gold will rip, silver will rip, like, dollars will sell off, more hard assets will go bid at some point. And so I just, you know, I remain constructive on this market, but short term cautious because of just how quickly we've come up and some of the indicators that are flashing yellow right now.
00:11:16.224 - 00:11:38.954, Speaker A: Okay, let's talk about a couple other things. Absolutely. So Argentina just elected a self described anarcho capitalist, Javier Millet. I hope I'm pronouncing that right, as president. And he won a bear haircut. He won resoundingly. I think the final numbers I saw maybe were 59 41, which is dramatic.
00:11:38.954 - 00:12:13.000, Speaker A: I mean, in democratic elections, that's pretty much a landslide. So he has a mandate now too. And he has joked or said, I mean, said humorously, I don't know if he's joking about cutting every department of the federal government there. He has his main, I would say, for international markets. His main proposed policy is to dollarize the economy. He did an advertisement where he smashed an effigy of the argentinian central bank with Thor's hammer. He has wielded a chainsaw in public.
00:12:13.000 - 00:12:38.260, Speaker A: The obvious idea being that he's going to chop down all this fiscal excess. And he has spoken positively about bitcoin, although a caution. He's not like literally calling to bitcoin eyes the economy, say, like naive Bukele. And El Salvador, this is the 23rd largest UDP in the world. Argentina, it's one of the top, I would say. I believe it's the third largest latin american economy behind Brazil and Mexico.
00:12:38.332 - 00:12:39.996, Speaker B: Almost 50 million people as well.
00:12:40.060 - 00:12:49.276, Speaker A: Yeah. And so I don't know any take on this or does the, you know, or how are markets reacting or anything like that in your mind? I mean, it's a big economy. It's a big.
00:12:49.300 - 00:12:59.264, Speaker B: Well, the notable shift currency is continuing to depreciate. And I think last I checked, argentine pesos, like 355, maybe a bit higher.
00:12:59.604 - 00:13:02.524, Speaker A: So 355 pesos to buy one american dollar.
00:13:02.604 - 00:13:03.148, Speaker B: Correct.
00:13:03.276 - 00:13:04.180, Speaker A: It's a lot of paper.
00:13:04.252 - 00:13:05.820, Speaker B: It was 45 years ago.
00:13:05.892 - 00:13:06.212, Speaker A: Wow.
00:13:06.268 - 00:13:27.154, Speaker B: And their rate of inflation on goods is like north. Well, this year, I think is north of 100, but historically it's like north of 50%. Imagine you buy this can of soda today with $10. It's going to cost you $20 tomorrow. The rate of inflation is so high that it's going to be a different price next week. That's insane.
00:13:27.314 - 00:13:29.298, Speaker A: Very hard to run a business or anything.
00:13:29.466 - 00:13:39.294, Speaker B: Anything. Dollarization does make sense. It's already a very dollar based economy in terms of the black market. Very active.
00:13:41.314 - 00:13:49.722, Speaker A: Peter McCormack, from what bitcoin did, he did a podcast, documentary, or actually documentary series recently, and he found many people using tether.
00:13:49.858 - 00:13:50.810, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely.
00:13:50.922 - 00:13:53.054, Speaker A: Which is dollars in the.
00:13:54.314 - 00:14:05.134, Speaker B: And I think if. Yeah, you're hitting a nail on the head. Like dollarization does mean adoption of stables. That's the easiest and fastest way to trade dollars around.
00:14:05.834 - 00:14:26.660, Speaker A: Yeah, there's been pretty wide. I actually, myself, I know several, and I have several good friends who are argentinian bitcoiners and makes sense, a lot of them. In fact, there are quite a number and I think I checked and there's been nine. The country has defaulted nine times in the last hundred years.
00:14:26.732 - 00:14:27.124, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:27.204 - 00:14:34.740, Speaker A: So clearly I think attempting a different policy makes sense, but this is where.
00:14:34.772 - 00:14:53.468, Speaker B: A lot of em is headed. Like Argentina is in the headlines now. They've got a lot of people and it's much more advanced economy, but this is the real story of Em. Every day people's purchasing powers get eroded. Every day people that don't have their money in dollars, they struggle or they don't own hard assets.
00:14:53.516 - 00:14:57.484, Speaker A: Ours has been getting eroded, but at a much slower rate than many of these emerging markets.
00:14:57.524 - 00:15:02.500, Speaker B: Correct. And that's simply because the US has the nukes and the FPU factors.
00:15:02.532 - 00:15:03.464, Speaker A: That's what you said.
00:15:04.084 - 00:15:41.582, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. It makes a huge difference. When the entire world wants to be in your capital markets, they want to own your currency, prevents it from selling off on a relative basis. And so, you know, I think this is just a reality of like every Em nation. If you play it out, if you play out like pick any random Em country, if you play out their fiscal situation over the next ten years, it's not going to look good. Doesn't look good if you already have high rates of inflation, like it's going to be tough to change that. Because the key thing about inflation is it's as much to do about actual inflation as it has to do with expectations of inflation.
00:15:41.582 - 00:16:05.984, Speaker B: Well, if you've been born in a country that's had excessive inflation for 20 years, you're going to expect that every year going forward, and that's going to anchor stickier harder. And so that's why the US is so aggressive about stamping out inflation, and that's why they care about market based inflation expectations, et cetera, because they're an important determinant into actual inflation.
00:16:06.104 - 00:16:45.904, Speaker A: So in 2022, the central bank of Argentina banned banks from offering crypto in any form. And then in May 23, the central bank in Argentina banned payment processors from offering crypto in any form. So you know that there's. But there is a lot of crypto there. So, you know, it's all black market basically, or, you know, off the books and whatnot. And I wonder, regardless of whatever sort of explicit crypto policy president millet adopts, if he is going to take an axe to big parts of the central bank, such as taking away their power to print money, which is what dollarization would mean. Right.
00:16:45.904 - 00:16:59.332, Speaker A: Presumably formally, though, some of those policies might get rolled back at the central bank as well. If, let's say there is no central bank, which, I mean, I don't know, but he did smash the central bank with Thor's hammer in an advertisement.
00:16:59.388 - 00:16:59.980, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:00.132 - 00:17:01.384, Speaker A: So it might be a more.
00:17:02.554 - 00:17:08.698, Speaker B: There's no developed economy that doesn't have a central bank. It's a hard premise to begin with. That's why.
00:17:08.746 - 00:17:41.636, Speaker A: And to your point, he actually, I saw that in his acceptance speech. I forget the exact language, but he did, it did seem like he actually kind of walked back some of what he's been saying. Yeah, he said something like, you know, we're gonna have, like, strong reforms of the central bank or something like that. In any case, he is a wildly popular, populist, extremely pro capitalist, anti socialist, self described president in a country where a very socialist government has been in charge for decades and has had runaway rampant inflation.
00:17:41.700 - 00:17:59.660, Speaker B: So, yeah, I mean, but it's chicken. Wait, wait, like, oh, I'm going to solve, like, you know, 100 years of bad economic policy that's compounded itself over time with a currency that's run away. Rate of inflation that's run away. I'm going to do it by cutting social spending programs for a couple of years. Like, come on, buddy, it's going to be tough.
00:17:59.692 - 00:18:00.380, Speaker A: We'll see.
00:18:00.532 - 00:18:01.116, Speaker B: Okay.
00:18:01.220 - 00:18:41.912, Speaker A: Yeah, go on. Another major story in cryptocurrency markets just happened. We're recording on Tuesday, this week just happened. Changpeng Zhao known as CZ Binance CEO founder has pled guilty to effectively, well, to criminal charges relating primarily to money laundering, bank illicit finance and binance. The corporate has like international binance has agreed to pay 4.3 billion in fines to I guess the DOJ, the CFTC and the treasury. But the CZ has apparently flown, apparently flown to Washington.
00:18:41.912 - 00:19:19.834, Speaker A: Yeah, flown to Washington state to plead guilty and he will personally pay a fine. Again, I'm recalling what the headlines just were moments ago. So this changes, my apologies, but will personally pay a $50 million fine and give up CEO. And he's tweeted that he is stepping down. Richard Tango will take over, who is an executive at Binance. This has been so this is not, by the way, SEC was not related here where they also have a case against binance us. So this doesn't necessarily resolve everything, but this apparently resolves these long rumored and reported on federal criminal investigation into Binance and CZ.
00:19:19.834 - 00:19:22.594, Speaker A: You know, what's your reaction?
00:19:22.894 - 00:19:55.484, Speaker B: Well, my gut tells me that it's left tail risk that's been eliminated from the market. Now. I think a lot of this was already expected. There's been stuff leaking for months now of a purported settlement. And so I think the 4 billion number might be a little bit above or below certain people's expectations, but loosely. It was a fully priced event and the prices are really unchanged. I mean, BNB goes up and down a lot.
00:19:55.524 - 00:20:10.994, Speaker A: I mean, even this morning there was the story that there would be announcement, there would be a press conference by DOJ, CTC, treasury, and we came down a little bit, but then once it was, more information came out about what it was and we basically repriced right back to where. Oh, it's that. Yeah, yeah.
00:20:11.034 - 00:21:01.258, Speaker B: But anyway, I mean, I think the most important thing is that these are the kinds of things that needed to happen in order for the US to feel really good about opening up, opening up the US capital market to crypto. Yeah. Via the ETF and via other means. But in order for, if you asked me six months ago what needed to happen for the government to feel comfortable allowing a bitcoin, ETF, I'd say finance and possibly other things, other stable coin related things, I would say potentially. And so I think this is just another hurdle that's been removed from the market. It's a left tail scenario that's gotten cut away. And I think that's, again, why you're sitting basically 1000 points from year to date highs in bitcoin.
00:21:01.258 - 00:21:24.092, Speaker B: It's really tough to ignore this asset class is screaming at you that it wants to go higher. I get it. I gave the whole spiel about all these warning shocks happening, but taking a step back, a 2510 year view, this is just such an owner. You know, the government's telling you we're okay with us capital markets being involved now.
00:21:24.228 - 00:21:28.020, Speaker A: We're getting better clarity in that regard. I did that.
00:21:28.052 - 00:21:33.692, Speaker B: And it's not becoming, like, less of a political issue as well. It's kind of my sense. Right. It's like.
00:21:33.748 - 00:22:24.814, Speaker A: Well, the illicit finance thing has been of top of mind the last few months, of course, since the attacks by Hamas on Israel and on ten, seven, and then the subsequent reporting about Hamas use of cryptocurrency that was part of this settlement. US Attorney General Merrick Garland specifically referenced that. They've secured a monumental fine. So there's a disgorgement here or something, and there will be ongoing monitoring. Again, this is criminal settlement. But he did say when he started that the fact that it was Treasury, DOJ, and CFTC all up there together represented the US government's whole of government approach to this asset class. Notably absent from that podium was SEC chairman Gary Gensler.
00:22:24.894 - 00:22:25.222, Speaker B: Yes.
00:22:25.278 - 00:23:00.774, Speaker A: So, and then the SEC announced just yesterday, on Monday, a new, I'm gonna say, Coinbase like case against Kraken, mostly focused again on the National Securities act and the National Exchange act. So going after Kraken for allowing the trading of supposedly unregistered securities and then itself not registering as an exchange under the Exchange act. So, similar case. And that case is really, first of all, these are civil cases. The SEC. Right. So these are getting litigated.
00:23:00.774 - 00:23:21.090, Speaker A: I think Kraken released a very strong statement saying they're gonna fight it. They believe the SEC is wrong on the substance, wrong on the law, whatever. But again, SEC not up there. So I think the point, though, is that there are still those regulatory civil cases, both. There's Coinbase, there's now Kraken, there's binance. Us. Right.
00:23:21.090 - 00:23:59.910, Speaker A: That's not settled here. But these are, I think, to your point, like that DOJ story. I mean, I think the journal reported in 22 that they had an investigation into binance. This was sort of a big tail risk. I mean, it felt like for, theoretically, although I think the length of time, there are reasons why we didn't think, and why the market, I think, is mostly flat on the news. It's just, I think, ultimately quite positive that this story ended with a plea deal and a settlement, rather than SWAT teams kicking down a door or story that CZ is fleeing or something. That would have been much more negative.
00:23:59.910 - 00:24:02.062, Speaker A: But although there are still these other things.
00:24:02.158 - 00:24:19.638, Speaker B: The other things, right? Like they mentioned Defi and like they mentioned how, you know, any defi protocol or person, you know, engaging in activity with us folks needed to like, apply those laws. And we've seen all the mandates from treasury. You got accounting standards, right?
00:24:19.686 - 00:24:40.834, Speaker A: You got the broker rule from IR's, you got the Exchange act definition from SEC. You got these new Fincen guidelines. They all point at DeFi and say you need to do BSA compliance, which is the same thing that binance is getting hit. It's very clear that basically outside the SEC, the main thing the US government cares about is illicit finance control.
00:24:40.954 - 00:25:02.560, Speaker B: And as they should, that's an appropriate stance to have as a government agency. You want people to respect your sanctions and you don't want terrorism to get financed. You should have protections against that. You know, is there like, is there lower hanging fruit that they could be going after more effective use of their resources?
00:25:02.712 - 00:25:03.240, Speaker A: Certainly, yes.
00:25:03.272 - 00:25:14.328, Speaker B: Sometimes it does feel that way at times. But at the end of the day, like, one of the main reasons why I love, like us capital markets is the rule of law is respected for the most part.
00:25:14.376 - 00:25:15.424, Speaker A: And we have good property rights.
00:25:15.464 - 00:25:21.480, Speaker B: Good, good property rights. And like, you know, kraken, like they will get their day in court.
00:25:21.552 - 00:25:21.880, Speaker A: Right.
00:25:21.952 - 00:25:23.544, Speaker B: With, you know, and which.
00:25:23.584 - 00:25:24.200, Speaker A: That says a lot.
00:25:24.232 - 00:25:25.256, Speaker B: That's a fair point, actually.
00:25:25.320 - 00:25:33.664, Speaker A: You don't just, it's not like we've seen in like, you know, when like a. Was that story star, the. Was it. Okay x guy. Like years ago. Just like disappeared.
00:25:33.744 - 00:25:34.328, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:34.456 - 00:25:43.456, Speaker A: Right. You're like, what? No, people don't typically just get, if it's a criminal case, you'll get your day in court. If it's a civil case, your idea.
00:25:43.480 - 00:26:18.474, Speaker B: Of property rights are really important. Right? Like, I'll give you an example. Like, I have a, you know, a person that owns an apartment in an EM economy, right? They had it built somewhat recently. They still don't have their deed, right. And if they wanted to go to court for that thing, it'd take them like six plus years to litigate that and God knows what would happen, right? You got places with tons of government turnover. And so having a place with such strong rule of law is ultimately like one of the main reasons why you've got such a strong capital market. Absolutely.
00:26:18.474 - 00:26:34.222, Speaker B: A sign like this, four agencies getting together right before an ETF potentially gets approved, et cetera. Big picture. It's a good thing because that will mean that more institutions will get a lot more comfortable because the government will be like, we've cleaned up crypto.
00:26:34.278 - 00:26:45.688, Speaker A: Yep. All right. Before we wrap, it is, as you listen to this, if you listen as it just came out, it is thanksgiving morning in the United States. Happy Thanksgiving to everyone. Bimnett, what are your plans for Thanksgiving?
00:26:45.816 - 00:26:51.536, Speaker B: Well, I plan to listen to all I want for Christmas because now it's appropriate to.
00:26:51.560 - 00:26:52.512, Speaker A: You're a big Christmas guy.
00:26:52.608 - 00:27:09.168, Speaker B: I love Christmas. Yeah, I love Thanksgiving, too. I love eating family, all of that. But I do love my Michael Buble holiday album. All I want for Christmas. The jingles and stuff is great. Also, ugly sweaters for those watching on YouTube.
00:27:09.168 - 00:27:10.208, Speaker B: On YouTube.
00:27:10.376 - 00:27:11.320, Speaker A: I like it. Sweater.
00:27:11.392 - 00:27:16.540, Speaker B: I do like it, too. My running joke right now is it's okay to wear ugly sweaters in the holidays.
00:27:16.572 - 00:27:16.668, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:16.676 - 00:27:36.980, Speaker B: It is the most appropriate time. And, but, you know, high level. I'm very thankful for the year we've had in crypto. I'm very thankful for all of the listeners that we have on galaxy brains and the viewers on the other platform. And I'm happy to be in crypto. And I got to tell you, I mean, it didn't feel that way this time last year.
00:27:37.012 - 00:27:37.824, Speaker A: No, it didn't.
00:27:39.884 - 00:27:43.276, Speaker B: We've come a long way and it's important to have perspective.
00:27:43.460 - 00:28:07.708, Speaker A: Bimnet Abibi, my friend from Galaxy trading, thank you so much. That's it for this week's episode of Galaxy Brains. Thanks to our guest, Bim Netabeebeebi from Galaxy trending as always, and to our producer, Phineas. We love doing this show. Happy Thanksgiving to everyone. If you celebrate it, we're very thankful for you and know that there's this common joke about Thanksgiving and other holidays in December and January. People go home.
00:28:07.708 - 00:28:46.200, Speaker A: Crypto people, bitcoin people, they go home. Their parents are either ecstatic, their parents and family and friends are either ecstatic that they told them about crypto or bitcoin. If it's last year, they're probably furious. I don't know what it's going to be like this year, but try to explain to them that we've come a long way over the last year. A lot of the industry has matured, and there are a lot of reasons to be positive about what's there in the future, you know, but keep it measured because it's still a volatile industry. Look, we'll catch you next week, and everyone have a safe and happy holiday weekend. Thanks for listening to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research.
