00:00:07.960 - 00:00:11.838, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet, a BB from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:11.926 - 00:00:12.782, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:12.838 - 00:00:26.942, Speaker A: So like, I mean, Bitcoin and ETH are not doing great. We'll talk a little bit about any effect that we've seen from this, the attack on Israel. But what is the status of markets in your view right now?
00:00:27.118 - 00:01:07.744, Speaker B: Crypto markets trade heavy. Right now. There is a very distinct sort of dislike or lack of favorability for ETH. Right now, ETH BTC is down pretty meaningfully over the past month, around 10%. Some of it has been because the FTX exploiter has been t whopping some ETH. But I generally think it has to do with the fundamental case for ETH as well, the lack of follow through on the ETH futures product, in addition to a lack of any meaningful positive catalysts in ETH. In addition, you have competitors and l two tokens, et cetera.
00:01:07.744 - 00:01:40.084, Speaker B: I think bitcoin's got a great story and it's going to outperform. It's going to be one of the better outperformers this year if you get an ETF or going into q one. And so just on a relative basis, it doesn't seem that compelling. And then with broader markets, the main concerns were obviously around the events of the weekend in Israel. The immediate reaction was oil jumped from $82 a barrel to 86. And you had some correction in equities. And we've eventually bounced back.
00:01:40.084 - 00:01:53.872, Speaker B: And then ultimately it's led to a little bit of a risk off move in treasuries, and we've caught a bid. And that relief in treasuries has helped generally support price action and equities, which.
00:01:53.888 - 00:01:57.040, Speaker A: Is like the opposite of historically, how it typically would be.
00:01:57.112 - 00:02:07.944, Speaker B: And so now I think we go back to what was originally driving markets, which was this price action in bonds, and you've got a really important data point tomorrow in CPI.
00:02:08.024 - 00:02:08.552, Speaker A: Right.
00:02:08.688 - 00:02:47.362, Speaker B: And so I think if you get a soft number, you'll see continued relief in bonds, and that should cause equities to rally high level, though. I think you're just at such a weird place in markets. The part of me is like, oh my God, there are so many things cracking. Look at credit card delinquencies, auto delinquencies, look at the number of people that have part time work. Look at wage growth coming in a little bit lower. There's so many signs in the economy that we're rolling over a little bit. However, the structural things just have not changed.
00:02:47.362 - 00:03:29.288, Speaker B: In the economy, there's going to be tons of bond supply and the government is probably going to spend 6% of GDP on their deficit in perpetuity. The labor market is still tight in terms of there's still huge mismatches among skills and labor. In addition, there's 9 million job openings, all already. We just had a huge surprise and jolts. And so there are signs that support both arguments. And ultimately I find myself in the camp of the curve has got to steepen. If you think that the economy is going to slow down, then the Fed is likely going to cut more and you'll get more cut pricing.
00:03:29.288 - 00:04:10.186, Speaker B: That should mean that twos rally and you still have tons of long end supply. And so the curve steepens. If you think we go higher in rates because the economy is really strong. The Fed came out this week and told you that moves in the back end will effectively tighten financial conditions to the same extent that a rise in front end interest rate does. It seems like if rates are going to go higher in general, we're going to get a bear steepening of the curve. And if rates are going to go lower, you're going to get a bull or bull bear steepening of the curve. So either or, it kind of seems like you're set up for steepening.
00:04:10.186 - 00:05:18.540, Speaker B: And that's kind of my bias at the moment. But it's really tricky, especially now that you've thrown in a geopolitical conflict on top of that. In addition, I genuinely, I think the Fed's making it up as they go, just responding to these data points and stuff. And the fact that they felt obligated enough to have four, five Fed speakers comment on the extent of the back end selling off when it's totally justified. And when you're still hiking, you're still telling the world that you might need to hike, you might need to take rates more financial condition, more restrictive, and yet you feel the need to comment that it might not justify hiking in the front end. It's so messed up. And part of the interpretation of why back end yields have risen is because some market participants view the current Fed as one not willing to fight the most important battle with inflation, which is the last mile.
00:05:18.540 - 00:05:48.064, Speaker B: If the Fed right now is like, oh, we're close to done, and they're not showing that vigor to really stamp out inflation, then that means inflation is going to be an issue in the longer run, potentially. And so I think that that's kind of a reason for some of the sell off in the curve, because market participants like the whole ten year paper or 30 year paper, you need to be confident that you're getting real returns that are meaningful.
00:05:48.644 - 00:05:53.396, Speaker A: And so people are doubting the Fed's resolve here as we're in this, like I am.
00:05:53.460 - 00:05:53.820, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:05:53.852 - 00:06:08.256, Speaker A: And we're in this hike, pause, hike, a regime right now where they're sort of, sort of sputtering along, kind of signaling there might be close to done. And yet inflation is still elevated, although that's where you're saying big number tomorrow to see what CPO.
00:06:08.320 - 00:07:08.812, Speaker B: And it's also, I mean, we've had this discussion before, but what people still fail to realize is the fed is going to claim victory over getting the rate of price changes to a reasonable level so that the price increases are somewhat more manageable. It does not address the fact that certain aspects of the economy and certain price levels have gotten to astronomical levels. So if rent in New York or in anywhere goes from $1,500 to 3000, rent doubled and then starts going from 3000 to 3100, that's a win in their mind. That's a win in their mind. But it is absolutely nonsensical because the real incomes, like, haven't actually kept up for those price levels. And so you're just in such a weird situation. And the Fed's gonna be quick to declare victory because they have a huge issue, which is 6% of GDP going towards deficits, right.
00:07:08.828 - 00:07:17.788, Speaker A: They've got to lower those rates as soon as they can. Basically. Well, they can't keep them higher for longer. They just can't. The government will essentially bankrupt itself and.
00:07:17.876 - 00:07:28.050, Speaker B: Or the Fed's gonna have to just start accumulating, buying the bonds. And so it's such a weird situation. Like what is victory? What does victory look like?
00:07:28.082 - 00:07:34.994, Speaker A: We've talked about this before too, about how a decline in inflation actually means a slowing of the growth rate of inflation.
00:07:35.074 - 00:07:35.490, Speaker B: Correct.
00:07:35.562 - 00:07:49.302, Speaker A: Versus inflation. It doesn't mean things go back the way they were. Deflation. I'm thinking about that video, that great video of quantitative easing explained from Omead Malaikon, where they're saying, isn't the price of milk higher than a year ago? Yes. Isn't the price of airlines higher than a year ago?
00:07:49.318 - 00:07:50.542, Speaker B: You've seen orange juice prices.
00:07:50.598 - 00:08:03.502, Speaker A: Exactly. And airlines too, just recently too. I know the last couple CPI's, they were elevated a component. And I'm seeing that as too, as I travel. I mean, prices are almost double from where they were six months ago for basic commuter funds.
00:08:03.678 - 00:08:15.454, Speaker B: This is another debate. But like, are we even measuring the right things? Like do they capture the, is the CPI basket really indicative of what people actually spend money on?
00:08:16.634 - 00:08:27.290, Speaker A: There was a video that was going viral from TikTok. I saw it downstream of TikTok on Twitter or x.com comma. And it's a guy going around Costco comparing all the prices, being like, dude, these are ridiculous.
00:08:27.402 - 00:08:29.018, Speaker B: Yeah. Way higher than they were.
00:08:29.146 - 00:08:34.354, Speaker A: And not like three, 4%, 5%, 20%, 50% higher.
00:08:34.394 - 00:08:34.826, Speaker B: Correct.
00:08:34.930 - 00:08:37.636, Speaker A: And this is, you know, Costco is a large wholesaler. Right.
00:08:37.740 - 00:08:40.300, Speaker B: They got the best price. Exactly.
00:08:40.372 - 00:08:43.004, Speaker A: That hot dog. I don't know how they keep that hot dog at a buck 50, though.
00:08:43.084 - 00:08:44.844, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's Buck 99.
00:08:44.884 - 00:08:50.508, Speaker A: But did they raise it? No, I think it was about 50. I'm not sure, but it's been flat for like decades anyway.
00:08:50.556 - 00:08:51.340, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:08:51.372 - 00:08:52.452, Speaker A: It's a tricky situation.
00:08:52.588 - 00:09:13.628, Speaker B: It's tricky. But I just, you know, what I want is just a level of communication from the fed that that's a little bit more, you know, factual, not more factual, but just speaking to people being like, we just have, like, such big. They can't acknowledge the fact that, I guess, the deficit spending is, like, totally out of control.
00:09:13.676 - 00:09:15.204, Speaker A: They're not talking about the deficit because.
00:09:15.284 - 00:09:19.372, Speaker B: Apparently, I mean, they've got no control over that. So they only respond to whatever, even.
00:09:19.388 - 00:09:34.140, Speaker A: Though these are like revolving doors. I mean. Right. The prior Fed sex, Fed chairperson is now the treasury secretary. It's like the same. And they can't acknowledge to regular people the fact, the truth, which they and the government should be clear with. Prices aren't going to come down, most likely.
00:09:34.140 - 00:09:42.012, Speaker A: They almost never do. And in fact, the Fed's terrified of deflation as well. Right. They think that's a huge impediment to growth.
00:09:42.108 - 00:09:43.244, Speaker B: No, absolutely right.
00:09:43.284 - 00:09:59.184, Speaker A: So not only won't they, they really can't, they don't want them to come down. But I don't think people, I mean, you hear this from both people in government. You hear it from the. We don't hear at all anything from the Fed but declaring victory against inflation when people. It'd be great if people were clearer with.
00:09:59.284 - 00:10:22.768, Speaker B: No, absolutely. But then there's the market knows, then there's just the obvious stuff that, like, you know, we can. This is a topic for another day, but, you know, you're gonna have, like, social unrest or social issues at some point. Like, these policies in general, like, lead to widening, like, wealth inequality. Right, right. Like, if nobody can now afford a home, it's like all the homeowners are gonna do great.
00:10:22.816 - 00:10:39.156, Speaker A: And even like, the deficit spending and the debt has been like a macro watchers issue. But as that interest payment grows and grows, it'll become a real significant issue for fiscal allocation. That really does impact a lot of what they can spend money on.
00:10:39.220 - 00:10:44.464, Speaker B: Absolutely. And that's like what are the things that people tend to cut first?
00:10:46.004 - 00:10:47.596, Speaker A: They don't cut defense first.
00:10:47.780 - 00:10:53.144, Speaker B: It's like the marginal programs that help the needy and stuff like that, you know.
00:10:53.644 - 00:10:56.964, Speaker A: Right. So that pain will start to be felt. You're right, there'll be more pressure over time.
00:10:57.004 - 00:11:06.676, Speaker B: And it's also like what's going to perform well, like equities are going to do okay in the environment. Like generally, like assets are going to do fine. And if the fed starts cutting again.
00:11:06.740 - 00:11:09.588, Speaker A: Like it's assets, and then we're right back to where we were, you're going.
00:11:09.596 - 00:11:10.516, Speaker B: To have the inflation again.
00:11:10.540 - 00:11:12.116, Speaker A: The asset owner is growing wealthy.
00:11:12.140 - 00:11:20.348, Speaker B: But yeah, here's the real, like, you know, crux of the issue is the risk of reinflation. Right, right.
00:11:20.436 - 00:11:22.900, Speaker A: And chart from like 70 in the seventies and eighties.
00:11:22.932 - 00:11:24.908, Speaker B: Arthur Burns and Paul Volcker. Right.
00:11:24.956 - 00:11:40.100, Speaker A: Like it's, that's how you go into like multi decade financial and economic hardship as a country. Right. With. When you just constantly are oscillating. I mean inflation got as high as like what, 20% or was that one print? How did it get very high? I know.
00:11:40.132 - 00:11:40.900, Speaker B: Interest rates.
00:11:41.052 - 00:11:42.668, Speaker A: Yeah, interest rates were up in the twenties.
00:11:42.756 - 00:11:45.118, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. And so I would think, you know.
00:11:45.236 - 00:11:50.154, Speaker A: That was one of his ideas too, right. That you had to raise rates above the inflation rate.
00:11:50.234 - 00:12:15.170, Speaker B: Yeah. Fundamentally, every time you wanted to get inflation down, you got to get it above. But it's like, it's a hard issue and I think the trades are easy, which is long bitcoin because the fiscal stuff ain't changing anytime soon. And gold and Paul tutor Jones saw on tv yesterday making a great case for the two. I would recommend that clip.
00:12:15.242 - 00:12:17.434, Speaker A: Love to see Paul back out here talking about it.
00:12:17.554 - 00:12:53.344, Speaker B: Yeah, let's get Paul and Galaxy brains give a call. I don't know if the market has such a nuanced understanding of it. Frankly speaking, I think a lot of equity investors just woke up to bonds a month ago and what it means, the shape of the curve and stuff. Some of these points are probably not as appreciated right now. But six months from now, nine months from now, a year from now, I think they'll come to a head.
00:12:53.504 - 00:12:55.984, Speaker A: BImno DB and Galaxy trading, thanks so much, my friend.
