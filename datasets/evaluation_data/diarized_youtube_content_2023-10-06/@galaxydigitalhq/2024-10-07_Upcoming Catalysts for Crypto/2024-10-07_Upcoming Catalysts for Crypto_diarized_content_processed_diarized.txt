00:00:00.160 - 00:00:58.565, Speaker A: What I'd also like to highlight is that you've just had so much selling happen over the past handful of months. You had the German government, you had the GOX claims, you had sort of natural profit takers, etc. And so there's been a ton of supply that's been absorbed by the market. And then when you think about it in terms of what are the next potential catalysts on a go forward, it's the election, it's FTX distributions, These are all not supply events. Right? And so I think just from a simple supply demand dynamic, it does look pretty favorable right now for crypto, for bitcoin at least. But I'm still very concerned with kind of the alt market, particularly some of the bigger VC coins. I just don't know where the interest tells buy some of this stuff is going to come from, particularly given the supply schedule.
