00:00:00.240 - 00:00:03.502, Speaker B: I am super stoked to be here, Alex. Thank you for inviting me. And, yeah, we.
00:00:03.518 - 00:00:04.518, Speaker A: Got some fun stuff to talk about.
00:00:04.566 - 00:00:20.742, Speaker B: We do. So we're gonna get into it a lot about the Sam Bankman free trial, because David was in the courtroom for the duration of the trial, covering it. He's writing about it. He's been writing about it. I saw this morning, or I guess maybe it was. I saw the tweet this morning. I think last night you tweeted that you may even write a book about it.
00:00:20.742 - 00:00:40.904, Speaker B: Yes. Excited to see that. David's one of my favorite writers in crypto. We're also gonna go back and ask David some questions about stuff he wrote as far long ago as ten years ago. Um, but before we do that, David, maybe introduce yourself to our audience. If they don't know, what are you doing now at flesh markets? What is that? And a little bit of your story. And when did you get into bitcoin and crypto?
