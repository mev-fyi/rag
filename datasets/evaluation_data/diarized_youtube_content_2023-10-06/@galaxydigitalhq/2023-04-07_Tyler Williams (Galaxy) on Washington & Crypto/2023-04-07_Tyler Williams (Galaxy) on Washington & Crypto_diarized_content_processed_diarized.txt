00:00:09.760 - 00:01:29.530, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. I'm immersed in the verse in the coins that I join when I purchase? Know I furnish into purses? Know my person is purpose? Cause my passion is worth it, I earn it? Never feeling like I got another life to live? Cause I got plenty to give? Long as the planet still spins damn it's been panic insanity managed humanity manic vanity demands vigilance? Yo, the ink, I've been spilling it every beat I've been killin it? Our guest this week is top billing Tyler Williams. Even on vacation no one is filling in? I'll be wrapping in my grave when the shovels start filling it in all seriousness, the game is never ending there's always something pending and always needs defending but I am always sending and you know I'm not pretending when I tell you contending that we're winning in the ending as always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital. Thank you for listening to Galaxy brains. We have a great show for you today. As I said, we are talking with Tyler Williams, head of public policy at Galaxy Digital, about the ongoings in Washington, both generally and in crypto. And of course, we'll check in with our good friend Bimnet of BB to talk markets and macro.
00:01:29.530 - 00:01:49.866, Speaker A: But before we get to all of that, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information contained in this podcast represents investment advice or an offer, recommendation or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates who buy or sell any securities. Getting fast at that, Finn. I don't know. We're going to need to. It's not sped up. Hey, I'm in here on vacation for y'all. I never miss the Galaxy brains.
00:01:49.866 - 00:01:57.306, Speaker A: We've got a great one for you, so let's get right into it. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, how are you, my friend? Good to see you.
00:01:57.330 - 00:02:01.466, Speaker B: Doing well. Nice to see you, too. I know you're on vacation, so technically I'm not here.
00:02:01.530 - 00:02:10.514, Speaker A: Someone. I was in the office. I'm in the office. Cause I'm on vacation in New York. And someone's like, oh, Alex, about that thing. I was like, no, no, no, I'm not here. Yep, don't talk to me.
00:02:10.514 - 00:02:21.294, Speaker A: But I will talk to you, my friend. Cause it's been an exciting. It's been exciting in markets. Absolutely. Point out last week on our show you said that gold was going higher. It has. We're through 2000.
00:02:21.294 - 00:02:33.820, Speaker A: You talked about the incredible technical setup for bitcoin higher on the monthly, the weekly, the daily chart looked good. We closed the quarter three consecutive up months. Correct.
00:02:33.932 - 00:02:36.068, Speaker B: And an outside month to boot.
00:02:36.196 - 00:02:56.168, Speaker A: But I will say just in the couple of days since then, bitcoin holding in the 28k range. But a big geopolitical maneuver here. OPEC unexpectedly cutting production and oil is ripping higher, which you pointed out was perhaps, if that were to happen, a risk for the market. What's happening now, I guess with the oil thing and how does that impact?
00:02:56.216 - 00:03:03.312, Speaker B: Yeah, so more specifically, we had OPEC and OPEC plus agree to a surprise cut of about one and a half million barrels per day.
00:03:03.368 - 00:03:04.296, Speaker A: Is that a lot?
00:03:04.480 - 00:03:48.084, Speaker B: That is decently chunky. The US, for context, consumes about 20 million barrels per day. So it's a lot. But remember, with commodities and with any market in general, it's a market set at the margin. So if you take one and a half million barrels per day off the market, it's definitely going to apply upward pressure to prices. In addition, some of the research we've read suggests that OPEC has more pricing power than ever, as in the marginal supply is more relevant than it has been from OPEC and OPEC plus. So I think the market is correct in pushing crude prices higher.
00:03:48.084 - 00:04:40.114, Speaker B: And we went from about $75 a barrel for WTI crude to about $81 a barrel. That's been a pretty significant move. And through 81, $82 a barrel, there's a pretty strong resistance there that we've kind of been at for the past three to four months. So if we move through these levels, it kind of suggests you're going to be headed towards 90 or even $100 a barrel. Most of the street has moved up their year end forecast for oil. We're in the camp of, I think in the back half of this year, you're probably going to see oil prices closer to $100 a barrel, partially a function of OPEC and OPEC plus being very strong handed in terms of supply cuts, but it's also a function of dollar weakening. Today we've had a pretty meaningful weakening of the dollar versus gold, but also versus other currencies.
00:04:40.114 - 00:05:25.780, Speaker B: I think that speaks to what we've had recently in terms of data. And what we've had in terms of the data is a meaningful continuation of the deterioration that we've seen. So ISM manufacturing yesterday was incredibly weak. The prices paid component was really weak, which is inflation. The employment section was really weak. And then today we got job openings that dropped by a lot, durable goods that didn't look good. So even though oil has moved higher and that is sort of has a very strong feedback loop into inflation, the hard data we've seen and the soft data we've seen from manufacturing and the real economy in the US is suggesting quite the opposite, which is a slowdown in pressures.
00:05:25.780 - 00:06:06.834, Speaker B: And some of the other things I've seen, like credit card spending data for March is down meaningfully month over month. So things of that nature point to a cooldown in the US economy. But again, energy has such a strong feedback loop into literally every good and service that it's a risk that people need to be aware of. And one of the ways here at galaxy we think about it, you can look at option structures on crude or energy markets and stuff. I definitely think that it should be in the average investors toolkit because that is a huge tail scenario for the market and for the disinflation story.
00:06:06.914 - 00:06:26.250, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting when you think about the cooling down should be good for the risk assets because it could mean the Fed's doing its job and they don't have to hike as much. And then we can finally like take the foot off the gas on rates. But if energy is getting much more expensive or if other commodities eventually do. Right, China reopening is still happening, right?
00:06:26.282 - 00:06:27.122, Speaker B: Yeah, no, absolutely.
00:06:27.218 - 00:06:48.994, Speaker A: Then that has a pretty inflationary impact long term. And that, and it's awful because it's one of the things the Fed really can't impact very much. Right. Whether if inflation overall stays higher, goes higher even while the economy is cooling. But the thing causing it is something the Fed barely can affect. That's a we're still in that rock and hard place scenario.
00:06:49.114 - 00:07:35.348, Speaker B: Absolutely. I would hate to be a central banker right now, but again, they are. Yeah, there's no good outcome here. And so I'm just kind of taking my cues from the markets and what the markets are telling you is that while there are upside risks to oil and stuff, it didn't go to 100 after the surprise cut and rates have been moving lower and the market is pricing in cuts. I saw this and the dollar is weakening and risk assets are rallying. It speaks to what we talked about last week on the podcast, which is the right tail of interest rate policy. Risk is being removed from the market even if oil prices were to get much higher.
00:07:35.348 - 00:07:49.796, Speaker B: I think folks realize that central bankers understand the limitations of monetary policy and aren't going to pursue that crazy six 7% interest rate policy if all of a sudden bananas start to go through the moon.
00:07:49.820 - 00:08:03.412, Speaker A: Because there are other things. If oil and gas go higher, I know we're really talking about oil and not gas, but if energy goes higher, then things like the US fracking complex maybe comes back online and can sort of.
00:08:03.468 - 00:08:04.100, Speaker B: It takes time.
00:08:04.172 - 00:08:25.132, Speaker A: I know it does. But there are other policy decisions that theoretically can be made in the US. To put it to sort of help out on the oil front. You can literally allow more drilling, for example. I know, again, this administration is not very keen on that, but if it got really bad, there are other tools other than interest rates to push back on that, too. So. Very interesting.
00:08:25.132 - 00:08:44.844, Speaker A: So like you said, risk assets are rallying. I saw s p through 4100, which I'm not an expert on this, but on tv, that's what they've been talking about as a key level on CNBC for literally weeks and weeks and weeks is like what the sort of average near term bull has been targeting is the bullish level. And we're through that.
00:08:44.924 - 00:08:58.236, Speaker B: And Nasdaq's also outperforming a lot. I mean, you're up almost, I think, 17, 18% on the year. But one of the key things that I think is worth pointing out is you're entering a period of very strong seasonality.
00:08:58.300 - 00:09:01.972, Speaker A: Just about to say this. April alone as a specific month is a very bullish month.
00:09:02.028 - 00:09:07.924, Speaker B: Very bullish month. Like 80% hit rate of being bullish. One of the highest months on average.
00:09:07.964 - 00:09:08.538, Speaker A: It's wild.
00:09:08.636 - 00:09:17.562, Speaker B: And then if you look at, like, historical returns based on years where, you know, S and P had a good start to Q one, like, odds are you're gonna have a great rest of the year.
00:09:17.568 - 00:09:25.526, Speaker A: There's only a couple years where it was up in less than it was then. I was gonna say there wasn't even. Are there even any years where it's down for the year? I saw there were.
00:09:25.550 - 00:09:26.118, Speaker B: No, no, no.
00:09:26.166 - 00:09:32.670, Speaker A: There was like one year in the last 30 where it, like, was up a lot in Q one, but then barely inked out, like one extra percent.
00:09:32.742 - 00:09:52.062, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that was 1987 or something where it was up 7%. Then it closed the year up eight or so. Something wrong? Long story short, there's been about 25 times when S and P has been up more than 7% in Q one. And basically 23 of those 25, you ended up having a great rest of the year.
00:09:52.118 - 00:09:52.678, Speaker A: Crazy.
00:09:52.806 - 00:09:55.766, Speaker B: So there's some good data to support.
00:09:55.870 - 00:10:03.038, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, that's the kind of. It's sort of a historical guidance concept, but it's not, it's not prescriptive at all. Anything can happen. We're in crazy time.
00:10:03.086 - 00:10:03.926, Speaker B: No, no, absolutely.
00:10:03.990 - 00:10:06.654, Speaker A: But still, I mean, yeah, it's just, it's such a weird time here.
00:10:06.774 - 00:10:23.456, Speaker B: And then the other thing to think about is, is just like, although there feels like there's a lot of uncertainty in the world still, right. The actual uncertainty priced in by the markets actually come off a lot interesting. And that's actually generally risk positive.
00:10:23.520 - 00:10:23.768, Speaker A: Right.
00:10:23.816 - 00:10:59.124, Speaker B: So when we had that whole banking crisis, interest rate volume shot up, and twos are moving 25 basis points up and down like crazy, and now it's like a little bit more gradual. I mean, today's a little bit of aberration given, you know, the data print we've had, but the interest rate volume has come off a little bit. Liquidity has entered the market. The VIx is on 18 handle now. We spike through 30 during that crisis. And generally speaking, it's been a little bit calmer. And I think the fed is more in a position where it's kind of wait and see.
00:10:59.124 - 00:11:10.208, Speaker B: They don't want to really cut rates throughout the balance. They just want to wait and see. They'll go one more meeting, most likely, and then just wait and see. So there's a lot less uncertainty in the market, I think.
00:11:10.296 - 00:11:12.204, Speaker A: And they got rates up high.
00:11:12.244 - 00:11:14.876, Speaker B: Pretty high. Not, they did a lot of hiking reasonably high.
00:11:14.900 - 00:11:17.268, Speaker A: We're not at the beginning of the hiking cycle, correct? Yeah.
00:11:17.396 - 00:11:33.516, Speaker B: And so, you know, one of the ways I think about my equation, mentally, at least for the market, is, like, the more uncertainty there is, the lower the prices, generally speaking. And so right now, we're adding more, less uncertainty into the market, and people are more comfortable.
00:11:33.580 - 00:11:34.716, Speaker A: We're adding more certainty.
00:11:34.780 - 00:11:44.088, Speaker B: Correct. And it's also just a function of, like, a $10 million position on a 20 volume is very different than a $10 million position on a 40 volume.
00:11:44.216 - 00:11:44.504, Speaker A: Right.
00:11:44.544 - 00:12:04.600, Speaker B: And so naturally, as volume comes down, you have room to add notionally to your position because your risk unit is actually staying constant as your notional. And so as volume comes down, people can take more risk. And I think that's what you're kind of seeing with things like S and P, NAsdaq, and a little bit of crypto.
00:12:04.672 - 00:12:18.312, Speaker A: What do you see? I was gonna say, how does this play into crypto? Let me set the stage here. I just saw that ETH BTC is back up a little bit. I mean, it's what I like. 0.0,645,065. And it had gotten down to, like, 0.062 ish.
00:12:18.368 - 00:12:19.672, Speaker B: Yeah, I meant.
00:12:19.808 - 00:12:36.856, Speaker A: So ETH has been outperforming just the last few days. Bitcoin. Bitcoin, I think, year to date, still outperforming. But ETH. But, you know, is that part of this? It's sort of like, well, we're in a little bit of a, you know, more risk on mentality right now. The street is feeling a little bit more comfortable. And ETH, this scene is a little bit more risky.
00:12:36.856 - 00:12:40.414, Speaker A: It certainly is. Higher volume bitcoin. Is that part of the story.
00:12:41.194 - 00:12:56.770, Speaker B: So I think it's the EBTC story to me is just positioning. People got very bulled up on bitcoin after the banking crisis, fiat to basement banking insecurity, et cetera.
00:12:56.802 - 00:12:58.914, Speaker A: Chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks.
00:12:59.034 - 00:13:07.354, Speaker B: And then gold was ripping as well. It had a really strong narrative, positive narrative, you know, ETH with Shanghai upgrade.
00:13:07.394 - 00:13:09.098, Speaker A: Coming up, little bit of uncertainty, a.
00:13:09.106 - 00:13:37.206, Speaker B: Little bit of uncertainty. And so what did you have? You have people positioned for that. And so ETHC moved a lot lower, right, as bitcoin, like, had its huge leg higher. And then you're left in a situation where everybody's kind of like Max long bitcoin and Max underweight ETH. And that's where we were, like two days ago. And then people are like, wait. ETH has been trying to break through, like 1820, like seven times now.
00:13:37.270 - 00:13:37.726, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:37.830 - 00:13:46.870, Speaker B: And, like, it broke through that level. I mean, today. And you had a subsequent rally in ETH, BTC. I think the high has been like 1880 in.
00:13:47.022 - 00:13:48.886, Speaker A: I think it's the highest, certainly highest.
00:13:48.910 - 00:14:33.176, Speaker B: Year to date for basically since merge. I mean, merge, we got to, like almost 1900 and change in September. Yeah. And so I think what you've seen over the past, like two days is just a positioning unwind where people got a little overextended on bitcoin and a little underexposed to ETH, and you just had that unwind happening. I think fundamentally, I still prefer being long bitcoin, but there's no issue being long, both right now. And I continue to think that one of the best ways to express it is upside options. I think people really underestimate how violent moves to the upside can be, especially when you take out technical levels.
00:14:33.176 - 00:14:38.424, Speaker B: You know, if you think about it, we went from 20 to 28k in the span of two weeks.
00:14:38.844 - 00:14:39.252, Speaker A: Right.
00:14:39.308 - 00:15:06.144, Speaker B: That's a huge move. That's a 40% move. That can happen in two weeks. And so one month implied volume at like 60 doesn't really make that much sense in this kind of a market. And so I still think that the best way to play for crypto upside is probably. Probably an optionality, but being long, also long and strong.
00:15:07.324 - 00:15:10.884, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, it's a fascinating time. I'm excited to just keep following this. I can't.
00:15:10.964 - 00:15:11.652, Speaker B: No, absolutely.
00:15:11.708 - 00:15:26.308, Speaker A: I mean, it's just. It's a much more interesting time in my mind now than it was like, say, last summer. Remember we had that episode with you and Robert Bukkoki and Christine Kim? I think maybe like, June of 22, and we were sort of Max bearish. I mean, I think.
00:15:26.396 - 00:15:29.732, Speaker B: 1819K bitcoin. And then we went to, like, 16, five.
00:15:29.788 - 00:15:51.304, Speaker A: I know. This is this famous in my mind, famous episode where we asked everyone to say a positive thing, and you were just, like, straight up stumped. Couldn't come up with anything. And. And, yeah, that was an interesting time, but I just. That the complexities swirling around in this market now are so interesting. The geopolitical stuff happening with China's reopening, but also China making all these moves on the world stage.
00:15:51.304 - 00:16:16.342, Speaker A: You know, Finland just formally entered NATO, like this morning, which, you know, is. Is literally an adjacent country, adds a dramatic amount of border with Russia to NATO. There's just a bunch of stuff happening. Even Mexico's foreign minister last week said that they were. That their vision was aligned with the BRICS countries. They're interested in doing more with brics. I'm like, that's our southern neighbor, right? There's a whole bunch.
00:16:16.478 - 00:16:17.846, Speaker B: You heard of NAfta guys, we're gonna.
00:16:17.870 - 00:16:31.454, Speaker A: Talk with Tyler Williams. I know NAFTA. We're gonna talk with Tyler Williams in a bit about. A little bit about the debt ceiling debate, which still has to happen in the US. It probably gets solved. There's a lot of moving pieces. That makes it an exciting time.
00:16:31.454 - 00:16:39.502, Speaker A: Looking forward to keep talking with you about it, but that's it for today. Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading, our good friend. Thank you so much. Pleasure.
00:16:39.558 - 00:16:40.494, Speaker B: Thank you for having me.
00:16:40.574 - 00:16:48.958, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, Tyler Williams, regulatory council, regulatory affairs council, head of public policy at Galaxy Digital. Tyler, our friend. Good to see you again.
00:16:49.046 - 00:16:54.514, Speaker C: Good to see Alex. Thanks for having me back. New year, new beginning, new time on galaxy brains.
00:16:54.854 - 00:17:19.164, Speaker A: We're already in the second quarter. The last time we had you on galaxy brains, I believe it was the weekend that FTX blew up. So quite a while ago. A lot has changed. I guess just before we even get into all that, I'm in New York you're in Washington, I think, about eight blocks from us in lower Manhattan. Former President Donald Trump is being indicted as I speak. It is Tuesday.
00:17:19.164 - 00:17:32.213, Speaker A: It is Tuesday, April 4. Tuesday, April 4. And there are helicopters overhead here in New York. It's a little bit of a scene. What is the mood there in Washington and on this Trump indictment?
00:17:32.673 - 00:18:02.536, Speaker C: So honestly, Congress is out. Both the House and the Senate are not in session. So that definitely colors and affects the general mood in Washington. Like, the town is just slower when members aren't here. So I haven't seen any sort of, sort of protracted outcry in Washington that we have seen on the news and otherwise in lower Manhattan. So I think it's drastically different. But we're in unchartered, like, you know, new history.
00:18:02.536 - 00:18:14.684, Speaker C: Right. Like, we haven't seen this in terms of indicting a former president or sitting president in quite some time. I think there's maybe one previous example in history, but I don't know the facts and circumstances.
00:18:15.704 - 00:18:33.490, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think the example, I'm willing to be wrong on this, but maybe was it like Teddy Roosevelt supposedly had got like, a speeding ticket or something? That's the story I heard. I don't know if it's true, but that, I mean, that's the level of discrepancy we're talking about versus what the former President Trump is facing.
00:18:33.602 - 00:18:41.234, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's right. That's what memory serves me. But I wasn't 100% sure either. We are in a new world order, I guess.
00:18:41.274 - 00:18:54.914, Speaker A: I mean, President Nixon was certainly in legal jeopardy, but he was pardoned. Right. And I don't know, maybe back in the, you know, in challenging people to a duel days, there was something here or there that could have happened.
00:18:54.994 - 00:18:55.722, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:18:55.818 - 00:18:57.658, Speaker A: Yeah, it's pretty wild. Sure.
00:18:57.786 - 00:19:03.850, Speaker C: I think they, we settled our legal scores and different mechanisms 150 years ago than we do today.
00:19:03.922 - 00:19:30.082, Speaker A: Yeah. As they say in Hamilton, the musical, everything's legal in New Jersey. Look, let's move into the real reason we're talking. How has Washington changed? We talked in early November of 2022. It was right after the congressional elections, the midterm elections. I think when we spoke, they hadn't even actually finalized that Republicans had won the House. Of course, they did eventually win by a narrow margin.
00:19:30.082 - 00:19:43.514, Speaker A: They're now in control of the House. But it's been, you know, almost five months since we spoke. And, and a lot has happened, broadly speaking. How, what, how does Washington feel different since it did than it did back then?
00:19:43.594 - 00:20:22.872, Speaker C: I think it feels quite different. I think that the FTX debacle and blow up has definitely colored the crypto economy in Washington. That that is for sure a true, true statement. I think in addition to that, what we've seen is other issues in the financial services sector and in our economy have started to creep up, and that, too, has colored Washington. So if you think of Congress is generally a reactive body. They try to solve problems that are like emergency or exigent, and sometimes they do a good job of planning for the future. But usually it's like dedicated in spending.
00:20:22.872 - 00:21:17.396, Speaker C: It's dedicated in very specific areas. And here what we have seen is the banking issues that have occurred with SVD and Silvergate and signature. That has caused at least the financial services policy community to sort of turn their attention a little bit more to issues affecting the traditional banking sector and perhaps the commercial real estate market as well, which gets into like a broader macro topic about interest rate policy and like our general spending environment. So I think it has shifted policymakers and legislators opinions, or maybe not opinions, has shifted their focus a little bit. But that doesn't, that shouldn't miss the underlying current. There's still a lot of people who are working on digital asset policy in both the House and the Senate and then also in the administration. So there's still people working on it.
00:21:17.480 - 00:22:02.414, Speaker A: So how is the banking crisis really? I guess it's what, it's now three, four weeks, maybe four weeks since SVB was taken over ish. And there was, yeah, I guess sort of. How has that simmered now they're on break. Are we likely to see any legislative changes? I know there's oversight that's been happening, and some hearings have already occurred where the FDIC was in Washington. The chairman, certainly Jay Powell, has did his semiannual appearance where he was actually, that was right before it. What is the mood? I mean, what are people blaming for it or what do you think comes out of it from a legislative perspective?
00:22:02.574 - 00:23:22.896, Speaker C: Well, this shouldn't shock anyone or any listener, but Washington's very good at pointing fingers at each other. So we had the crisis in 2008, and then in the immediate aftermath, we had Dodd, frankly, you know, Dodd Frank was billed as an end to too big to fail, and it was going to ensure that institutions who were in trouble, troubled financial situation, they had a path to resolving that financial stress in an orderly manner, and it wasn't going to cost taxpayers. That's literally unlike the beginning of Dodd Frank. And so now we're here today, and in 2018, there was some legislative effort. And people commonly refer to this as s 2155, which was largely billed as fixing the regulatory overreach and impact of Dodd Frank to community banks, mid sized banks, and sort of like the super regionals, I'll call it the banks that are above like 100 billion, below 250 billion in assets. And so what we had was that bill had broad bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate and was signed into law. And there are some folks in Washington that are pointing to that bill as sort of the reason that SVB went down.
00:23:22.896 - 00:24:10.278, Speaker C: And what we've seen in that is like a little bit of finger pointing. I would say there's close to a 0% chance that we see legislative movement to restore or strip that bill or to remove the authority from the Fed for tailoring in different sized institutions. But what I think we will see is the fed, and particularly the vice chair of supervision, Michael Barr, use his existing authority under the legislation to ensure that the larger institutions on that scale, that the regulators and supervisors have more tools available to them and perhaps tailored tools that are available to them. So I think we'll see the regulators take sort of a new, fresh look at the legislation.
00:24:10.366 - 00:24:40.678, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a question, because I know some on the left in particular, have blamed that they've called that 2018 reform s 21 55, a watering down of Dodd Frank. And I guess this is, please correct me, my understanding, the reason they say that is that it raised the threshold that banks would be siffis. Considered sifIs. Right. It's thus sort of exempting some, like you said, super regional big banks, but not big enough from additional oversight.
00:24:40.806 - 00:24:59.154, Speaker C: I would say it gave the Fed additional tools to tailor their supervisory and regulatory regime within certain size parameters so that those banks that were larger than 150 now had new, the regulators had new supervisory tools to look at them and put them into different categories for.
00:24:59.464 - 00:25:04.408, Speaker A: Capital liquidity rather than prescribing it sort of top down from Congress.
00:25:04.536 - 00:25:05.728, Speaker C: Yeah. Yes.
00:25:05.776 - 00:25:48.970, Speaker A: That's exactly. A little bit more leeway, but a big. The banks are holding a lot of debt. A lot of them are from right before interest rates started to dramatically rise. Right. And some of those are hold to maturity that don't really get fully exposed on the balance sheet. But more broadly, isn't this a problem the Fed definitely was well aware of? Aren't they aware whether you're a $50 billion bank, Fed member bank, or 150 billion, aren't they aware of what you have on your balance sheet? To what extent was this foreseeable? Just in general, from the supervisory side.
00:25:49.002 - 00:26:29.554, Speaker C: Of the Fed, it seems to me highly foreseeable, the Fed and the Reserve banks and the bank regulatory system, they all have different dedicated supervisory and exam teams that are specifically focused on different sized institutions. And so you'll have like large bank groups, you'll have community bank groups, and you'll have mid sized groups. And almost every one of the banking regulators and each one of their jobs is to ensure that, like their, the safety and soundness of the banking system isn't compromised. So there's literally like probably thousands of employees across, like the federal banking regulators, that their sole focus is supposed to be the safety and soundness of the banking institution. Banking system.
00:26:29.674 - 00:26:52.414, Speaker A: Yeah. And it just seems to me that, and of course, they've come out since they did the BTFP and sort of other backstopping measures, and we did only see so far SVB and signature. I'm not even going to include Silvergate in this. Cause I mean, they certainly, it's a little bit more nuanced there. And they weren't taken over. Right. They just closed shop.
00:26:52.414 - 00:26:58.774, Speaker A: And then first republic sort of allowed to limp on. And then eventually credit Suisse abroad.
00:27:00.634 - 00:27:00.922, Speaker B: They'Ve.
00:27:00.938 - 00:27:28.434, Speaker A: Been coming out saying the banking system is safe and sound. But obviously now it's very clear that it's really on relatively tentative footing absent the unlimited backstop that ultimately the Fed can provide. There's a lot of banks whose balance sheets look pretty weak. Right. It's just not clear. I'm having a hard time understanding this. I understand how Fed policy, they can't come out and say, by the way, things are looking shaky.
00:27:28.434 - 00:27:41.946, Speaker A: Right. Because the second they say that things will collapse, right. I mean, they have to sort of always project confidence. But like, it just seems to me that this is a very foreseeable problem that they, everyone was so shocked by.
00:27:42.090 - 00:28:23.190, Speaker C: I don't disagree that it was a foreseeable problem. And my comment earlier about the commercial real estate, if we see a weakening in the commercial real estate market, like, that could bleed into like a broader swath of the banking system. Because if you look at the balance sheets of like, community banks all across America, they all hold a significant amount of commercial real estate exposure on their balance sheet. Like, true, it's very dedicated and localized in different banks. And so, like, unique risks might not sort of present across the entire system, but it might be another weak spot, particularly if we see like a continual rising rate environment. We start to see like, defaults actually tick up. I did see, we haven't seen that.
00:28:23.190 - 00:29:17.216, Speaker C: We haven't says, we haven't seen that today like we saw in the run up to the zero eight crisis. But I don't disagree at all with you. What you said, like, the policy is a little confusing because in zero eight we said, we have a banking, we have a crisis. We had a mortgage crisis that led into significant sort of wholesale banking system reforms, and then we purported to end too big to fail. And now we have the banking crisis that exists in, like, the SVB in the last couple months. And now we have a situation where I'm not entirely sure what the projected policy is, other than we certainly didn't end too big to fail. We just said we're going to reignite all of the emergency liquidity provisioning tools that our banking regulators have, and on a very spot basis.
00:29:17.216 - 00:29:18.768, Speaker C: I think that's the policy, though.
00:29:18.896 - 00:29:40.424, Speaker A: That's what it seems like. All right, let's move on a little bit. Cause the banking thing is, it's just a wild thing. I joke that banks are magic, right? If I run a central bank or a bank in general, you have to say, it's fine the entire way down, no matter where it is. You can never.
00:29:40.464 - 00:29:42.816, Speaker C: We could have an entire session dedicated just to this.
00:29:42.880 - 00:29:52.744, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. But. Exactly. So let's move on. Let's talk a little bit about the crypto and banking stuff. Really. I want to actually just focus on signature in particular.
00:29:52.744 - 00:30:45.950, Speaker A: We've talked, I think, certainly from my platform at Galaxy research, we've written a lot about Silvergate and signature and the banking crisis from a crypto standpoint. But even just this, earlier this week, I think yesterday or Sunday in Barron's, Barney Frank of Dodd Frank, former chairman of house financial services during the great financial crisis of 2008 and co sponsor, named co sponsor of Dodd Frank. He was a director on the board of signature bank. And he said right after it was seized by NYDFs and then given to the FDIC. And he continues to say that he believes that it was targeted because of its crypto activities. He believes it was solvent. What do you make of these comments? Certainly I'm sympathetic to this because it seems as if it was seized.
00:30:45.950 - 00:31:26.716, Speaker A: It was seized right before the backstop was announced, literally minutes before. Right. And First Republic has sort of been allowed to limp on when it looks quite impaired. But signature was not, and the NYDFS has said expressly that it wasn't, that the reason that NYDFS says it was seized was because of a crisis of confidence in the bank's leadership as it relates to its reporting. That's literally what the superintendent Harris of the NYDFS, its primary regulator, said about signature. But Barney Frank, a director there, says they believed it was solvent and it could have opened on that Monday. And he said just this past Sunday that he believes crypto was targeted.
00:31:26.716 - 00:31:28.492, Speaker A: You know, what are your thoughts on this?
00:31:28.628 - 00:31:43.018, Speaker C: I wouldn't be shocked at all if it was targeted for those specific reasons. I haven't examined, like, the balance sheet to know whether or not, like, the financial distress of the company, like, wasn't the like, but for cause of, like, the receivership.
00:31:43.066 - 00:31:43.362, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:43.418 - 00:33:19.658, Speaker C: However, as you noted, like we've talked and written about in the research, the successive actions that have transpired just in this calendar year, starting from January 3, where there was, like, the joint statement, plus, like, the joint statement from the prudential banking regulators, plus the custodial decision and so forth and so on. And I think what we have seen, and the only thing that we didn't cover within that research was there was a FDIC IG report that explicitly stated that there were 136 banks in the United States that were interested in or providing services to the crypto economy. And if you think about that, in the broad scale of the banking system, I don't know what the exact number is today, but we have close to 5000 FDIC insured banks in the US. So it's like a sub fraction of a fraction of a percentage point of the banking system that is providing services, the sector. And then we've seen these successive actions, plus the receiverships of one of the main financial conduits and the on ramps to the digital asset economy being taken into receivership. And then if you look at the after effects of that, we saw the sale of the non crypto related deposits to Flagstar and the crypto deposits sitting around in the bridge bank. Reasonably, people can disagree about the facts and circumstances of that, but I think it's hard to disagree with the outcome.
00:33:19.658 - 00:33:26.974, Speaker C: And the outcome certainly looks like the federal government is saying we don't want the banking system provides services to crypto.
00:33:27.314 - 00:34:15.258, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a tough situation. And this, along with some of the market regulators actions, really goes in the opposite direction of what some of the other major world economies are doing. We talked about this on our podcast with Tim Grant earlier this year. But if you look at the UK, Europe, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, parts of the Middle east, again, major economies, they're really going in the opposite direction. Here. It looks like not just not, you know, doing an operation choke point, but in some cases being, you know, putting forth and enacting extremely progressive regulations, Mika. And the EU, the recommendations from His Majesty's treasury to the FCA in the UK.
00:34:15.258 - 00:35:01.340, Speaker A: And I just. Yeah. Anyway, I just can't help but note that stark difference at something. Just as an american, I am particularly hopeful we can move past and sort of figure out a way to get over these very restrictive and even, I'll say, dare I say, negative policy decisions that seem to be being made in the US on that point. Tyler, I've been following the House Financial services committee for a long time. What does it look like? Now we have, Representative Patrick McHenry of the great state of North Carolina is in charge, is the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. I guess Democrat Representative Maxine Waters now is the ranking member.
00:35:01.340 - 00:35:27.000, Speaker A: They've worked together in the past. They worked last summer a bit on that stablecoin bill that was widely reported. You've got Representative French Hill now sort of in charge of a subcommittee on the House Financial services committee that's focused on digital assets. What's the mood look like at house financial services? Do we feel positive about anything getting done on a bipartisan basis this year that could be positive for the crypto industry? Yeah, absolutely.
00:35:27.032 - 00:36:41.128, Speaker C: And just to tie one ribbon around the banking issue, I even think there's a positive narrative within Congress relative to the banking issues because we have seen some pretty strong oversight from both the Senate Banking and committee and the House Financial Services Committee relative to these debanking efforts. And we've seen it in the past couple weeks. There were multiple hearings in both the House and the Senate with the chair of the FDIC, with the vice chair of supervision from the Fed, and also with the Treasury Department, all relative to these issues. And we saw, like, specific commentary. So I think we'll continue to see, like people in policymakers, particularly legislators, pushing back against, like the D banking great relative to, like, the progressive actions that might happen, or like the bipartisan work that's happening in the House financial service. I think, I think it's entirely true that both chair McHenry and ranking member waters are trying to sort of build the momentum around producing both a stable coin bill and then a market structure package. And I see that because they are pulling together these bipartisan briefings.
00:36:41.128 - 00:37:47.210, Speaker C: So they're trying to do everything together. So they're having briefings from experts coming in and talking about stable coin policy. They're having briefings from experts coming in talking about market structure issues, and they're also doing it in concert with the AG committee. And I think that's really important because there's this historic jurisdictional divide between securities and commodities being like the AG committee and the House Financial Services Committee. And I think what chair McHenry and ranking member waters are trying to do is, like, build a collegial environment and do briefings together. And then it looks like they're going to release at some point in time these two different legislative packages and try to move them through their committees with, like, a dual referral process, which is, you know, Washington, DC parlance for, like, they're going to try to do it together and they're going to try to produce a piece of legislation out of the House that has bipartisan support, which I think is a very strong signal to people in our space who care about policy and regulation.
00:37:47.362 - 00:38:09.698, Speaker A: Yeah, that's great. I didn't realize that the sort of bipartisan spirit that Representative McHenry and Representative waters we know they had last summer has really sort of persisted so dramatically. That's great. Not just between the two parties, like you said, but between the financial services and the agricultural committees. That would be ideal. Right. I mean, I think that that's great to hear.
00:38:09.698 - 00:38:17.174, Speaker A: Is this the one issue in Congress where we're seeing sign this? I guess, in China, you know, hating on China are the two main bipartisan issues right now.
00:38:19.274 - 00:38:36.144, Speaker C: You know, Washington finds strange bedfellows. So, yeah, those are definitely two bipartisan issues. There's lots of other stuff going on in Washington. I'm not saying this is like, the only important issue. We obviously have, like, the debt ceiling debacle, whatever might happen there.
00:38:36.224 - 00:38:48.584, Speaker A: Yeah. What is the current state on the debt ceiling? Right. The secretary of the treasury, the treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, is currently using what emergency measures to fund the government because we're actually out of money at the moment.
00:38:48.664 - 00:39:21.072, Speaker C: That's right. And they always solve, they've never not solved this. They've never not solved it, but we've come close to not solving it a couple times. And if you remember back in 2011, like, the last time that this was like a serious emergency debate, when Speaker Boehner was around, he was negotiating with President Obama at the time. And we had sort of like that near default. But we did have a slight downgrade of memory of serving me correctly. So we've come close before.
00:39:21.072 - 00:39:47.292, Speaker C: Now is a question of, it's pretty much the exact same political divide. You have Republicans controlling the House, you have Democrats controlling the Senate, and a democratic elected president in the White House. So it's the same dynamics as 2011. I think the only difference is, like, we have a really different conference in the House from a republican majority, and we have a much thinner majority in the House than we did in 2011.
00:39:47.428 - 00:39:58.206, Speaker A: Right. So you had a more, I think it's fair to say a more moderate republican conference in the House in 2011, but a bigger one, whereas you have. Is that fair?
00:39:58.350 - 00:40:23.688, Speaker C: I don't know. I wouldn't say we had a more moderate. I would say we had a. There was a larger majority that Speaker Boehner at the time enjoyed. And there was still this. The conference was still divided insofar as there was less collegiality around sort of the underlying conference. Like, there was less unity in that conference.
00:40:23.688 - 00:40:38.092, Speaker C: And so it allowed the speaker to exert a little bit more authority and agency when he was negotiating with the White House. What I think we have now is perhaps more collegiality. It's just in a starker, more hardline position.
00:40:38.268 - 00:40:38.980, Speaker A: Got it.
00:40:39.092 - 00:40:52.192, Speaker C: So I don't know exactly how to handicap it other than I think everyone understands that, like a downgrade and a default on, like, the US debt would be, you know, a cataclysmic event in, like, the world's financial markets.
00:40:52.248 - 00:41:21.664, Speaker A: Yeah, it would. And not just in the financial markets, but I think in the, in the, in terms of monetary history. I've been following a lot. I don't want to be a doomer on this. There's a lot of people on, on Twitter that are sort of dollar doomers at the moment, and I'm not one, but I would say, I think that there's been a lot of de dollarization progress, if we want to call it that, worldwide. In. When I look at 2023 versus 2011, the Saudis have really started to chart a third way here.
00:41:21.664 - 00:41:57.356, Speaker A: They're not really, you know, they just. We're going to talk. We talked about this with BiMnet earlier, but, you know, they've basically orchestrated an OPEC supply production cut against the wishes of the White House, which is pretty rare historically in the long allyship between Saudi Arabia and the United States. You see Saudi agreeing to sell their oil. The oil that they sell to China priced it in the yuan, which is about 25% of all saudi oil exports, on and on. There's a whole bunch of examples of this. China, people didn't even talk about this.
00:41:57.356 - 00:42:38.874, Speaker A: China just negotiated essentially a peace deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia. And the US statement was, oh, well, the Saudis kept us in the loop on this and, you know, we're just happy that something got done, aka, like, wow, like, we had nothing to do with this. And we're basically totally unimportant now in saudi iranian relations. So my only point is, I think it would actually be much more cataclysmic, even a slight downgrade this time, because, you know, we are in a much more multipolar world now than we were in 2011. So let's get it together, people in Washington. Let's get that debt. We should, we should also reduce the debt, but, you know, it's also not default on it.
00:42:38.874 - 00:42:40.246, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:42:40.270 - 00:42:43.590, Speaker C: These are expenditures already incurred, so to speak.
00:42:43.622 - 00:42:43.814, Speaker A: Right.
00:42:43.854 - 00:42:46.154, Speaker C: So we're just like paying our credit card bills.
00:42:46.534 - 00:43:14.638, Speaker A: Yeah. Tyler, just, just, you know, one. One last question. Overall, you know, you talked about markets, a market infrastructure. Sorry, market structure legislation and a stable coin bill. When you talk to people about crypto now, you know, I've gone through a lot of eras in the sort of blockchain timeline, right. And I joke that the period in 2012 to 2015 or so was the blockchain, not bitcoin.
00:43:14.638 - 00:43:40.158, Speaker A: Right. Every single big bank and big company was looking into blockchain technology. But if you ask them about bitcoin, they'd be like, oh, no, no, no. Bitcoin, that's for criminals because of the Silk Road and whatnot. We had Chris Tarbella on last week who took down the Silk road. But that blockchain technology, baby, that underlying tech, it's still nice, right? We can do stuff with it. Are we back in that era? Is that what people are asking about now in Washington? They're about the crypto markets and now.
00:43:40.158 - 00:43:44.854, Speaker A: But they, they still think there's this big blockchain opportunity outside of crypto.
00:43:44.974 - 00:44:22.534, Speaker C: I. I think that's generally right. I would just put us more in, like, the world of, like, people want. People want to show us the use case. And as I mentioned, like in, in Washington, especially in Congress, it's a very reactive body and people need to be able to see and feel like whatever change is occurring and we need to be able to produce sort of like the tangible, physical, real world. Like, let me play with this toy type thing. And I think the, the momentum, at least in the policy environment, isn't gone.
00:44:22.534 - 00:44:36.090, Speaker C: I just think there are other things that are sliding in as well. And if you think about, like, AI and the revolution, are they worried about AI? I think people look at chat GPT as, like, the real world use case for AI.
00:44:36.162 - 00:44:36.526, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:44:36.610 - 00:44:47.478, Speaker C: And they say, like, here's this cool tool. I can throw in any question and, like, the magic computers give me this answer and I don't know how the computers are working. But I have this answer, and that's our use case.
00:44:47.526 - 00:45:23.900, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, it's. I mean, I think it's so funny when you bring this up to me because, like, I look at, you know, non sovereign, decentralized money in a multipolar world, I look at something like being your own bank or decentralized finance in a world where, gosh, banks and finance look pretty dicey dicier than I think they have in a long time. Those seem like powerful use cases to me, but I guess those aren't the ones that a lot of Washington wants to hear about, right? They want the dollar. They don't want decentralized money. They want the dollar. What did President Trump say when he was president that he doesn't. I don't like bitcoin.
00:45:23.900 - 00:45:44.184, Speaker A: It's not money like, I like the dollar. Right. I mean. I mean, is that part of the issue? They're hunting for some other use case than what I think? I mean, even digital collectibles. I mean, sure, a huge bubble has happened in the NFT space, but there's going to be those digital. You're asking for tangible use cases. My twitter handle is intangible coins.
00:45:44.184 - 00:45:50.504, Speaker A: Is that not compelling? Should I change it to tangible uses instead of intangible coins?
00:45:51.204 - 00:46:39.986, Speaker C: Maybe you should change. I don't know. I hear you. And as I think about it, we're in a policy debate for the future of the global capital markets. In some ways, we don't know exactly what is going to happen, but we know that the future in 50 years or 100 years is highly unlikely to look like it does today. If someone suggests a use case might be tokenizing securities, unless we have the ability to actually do that, and unless we have the ability to actually conceive of that and consume it. From a retail investor perspective, it's very hard to convince policymakers because what they need is like, show me things that I can tell my constituents that I'm working on.
00:46:39.986 - 00:46:46.434, Speaker C: And if my constituents on the largess don't care about these things, how am I supposed to care about it?
00:46:46.554 - 00:47:12.772, Speaker A: Yeah, I get that. Well, I think the last survey I saw, I forget who produced this, but 20% of Americans own crypto as of the end of 2022. So hopefully that's a lot of constituents. Hey, Tyler Williams, Galaxy's head of public policy and regulatory affairs. As always, my friend, thank you so much for joining.
