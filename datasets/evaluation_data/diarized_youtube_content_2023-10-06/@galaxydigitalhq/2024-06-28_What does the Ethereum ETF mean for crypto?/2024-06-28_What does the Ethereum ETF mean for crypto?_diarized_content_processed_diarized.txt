So you have $10 billion, $11 billion of ETH that goes from being idle ETH to potentially redeemable ETH that can be used in the ETH ecosystem. It can be used to stake farm on DeFi, et cetera.

And so what I really like, if I had to trade anything from the long side going with ETF, are the DeFi protocols.
