00:00:00.720 - 00:00:05.617, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains. An infinite amount of cash. I'm your host, Alex Thorne.
00:00:05.641 - 00:00:08.245, Speaker B: The US banking system is sound and resilient.
00:00:08.625 - 00:00:13.697, Speaker A: Bitcoin made a new all time high. If you're not long. If you're not long, you're short.
00:00:13.881 - 00:00:17.617, Speaker B: Satoshi's gonna come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet.
00:00:17.721 - 00:00:19.365, Speaker C: All bitcoin's gonna be erased.
00:00:19.665 - 00:00:24.885, Speaker B: Bitcoin. Bitcoin's the best crypto. Bitcoin is going to zero.
00:00:25.755 - 00:00:57.145, Speaker A: Welcome back to Galaxy Brains. As always, I'm your host Alex Thorne, head of Firmwide Research at Galaxy Bitcoin not zero. And I am on site in Hong Kong at Galaxy HQ in Asia. We have a great episode for you today. John Cahill, COO of Asia at Galaxy is our guest and of course we'll check in with our good friend Bimnet ABB from Galaxy Trading. As always to Talk markets. Before I get to that, I need to remind you, please refer to link to disclaimer on the podcast notes and note that none of the information this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer recommendation or solicitation by Galaxy or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities.
00:00:57.145 - 00:01:03.625, Speaker A: I am on a whirlwind tour of Singapore and Hong Kong and this was a great episode with John. So let's get right to it.
00:01:04.885 - 00:01:10.829, Speaker D: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:01:10.997 - 00:01:12.189, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:01:12.317 - 00:01:31.837, Speaker D: I am still in Hong Kong and not back in the States, but a lot has happened. It's actually been a very eventful week in, in bitcoin markets. Let's start with the SEC's approval of ETF options. Bimnet, what's your take? When's it going to happen? Why does it matter?
00:01:31.941 - 00:02:26.255, Speaker C: You know, it's a little unclear about when it's going to happen, but it was a step in the right direction. You needed the SEC to approve it and the subsequent steps are, you know, the CFTC needs to approve it and I think the occasional as well. But now, you know, there's a more believable pathway to getting a Bitcoin etf. I think in terms of what it means for the space, it means continued institutional and retail adoption. If you look at some of the volumes on crypto equities in terms of options volumes, they're very significant. And that's because, you know, partially because folks haven't had the ability to purchase options on Bitcoin directly. And so I do think that folks will use this product.
00:02:26.255 - 00:03:11.555, Speaker C: Folks are Very sophisticated these days, and so are institutions. And so I think it's just another pathway for liquidity. Tough to estimate what kind of impact it will have on price. But in theory it should mean that folks will get more comfortable with Bitcoin because it's another avenue for hedging, it's another avenue for generating yield. In addition, your counterparty on the calls is the clearing house, right. And so there's no credit risk on these bitcoin options versus say facing an offshore exchange or a counterparty directly. And so it should bring more adoption, more trust into the space.
00:03:11.555 - 00:04:20.815, Speaker C: And that's sort of basically what's been happening from the Moment these Bitcoin ETFs have been approved. We've seen continued kind of adoption of Bitcoin as an acceptable form of collateral to lend against. Rates generally have been softening as kind of the credit premium and the rate component of it have both been moving in the right direction. And so it's a very positive sort of event that came out of last Friday's announcement. And then you've also had some positive rhetoric with respect to what the Harris administration is going to do with respect to crypto policy. I think Mark Cuban was on Twitter yesterday saying that they aren't the Harris campaign presidency will not pursue a regulation by enforcement sort of policy. And that Gensler is out is kind of what Cuban was saying.
00:04:20.815 - 00:05:50.855, Speaker C: And so you're having a bunch of constructive narratives forming around bitcoin and that should be very good. And then when you couple that with a very strong macro backdrop with gold trading at all time highs, with Silver having a 5% plus day yesterday and at trend highs, with S and P at all time highs and Nasdaq trading well, with China injecting stimulus into the economy, with just the broader turn you've had in monetary policy over the past couple of months, European data has been softening. They're expected to cut further. Bank of Canada is going to be cutting by 50. And so there's just a lot of constructive tailwinds from the macro and the liquidity side of things as well as the regulatory and structural dynamics. And so, you know, I really do think that Q4 is going to be a very strong quarter for Bitcoin. And you know, when you couple that with FTX distributions that are likely going to happen at some point in the next couple of quarters, you know, you should really have kind of the catalysts and you know, the momentum for push beyond all time highs over the next quarter or so.
00:05:50.895 - 00:05:59.791, Speaker D: We're back. It sounds like we've got a bullish bim net. We've got a bullish bim net on the mic. It's hot on the mic. I saw that. You know we've been covering the.
00:05:59.863 - 00:06:01.199, Speaker C: I wish I could rap like you.
00:06:01.247 - 00:06:39.745, Speaker D: But you know, we've been covering the SAB121 story for a long time. And I wrote about the easing, the apparent offering of exemption to some entity, some state regulated bank. We all thought it was BNY Mellon and now it looks like this week BNY has said it was them. How big in your mind, if BNY is about to start being able to offer Bitcoin custody to institutions, say to ETFs, how big is their entrance in your mind? Why is that better than the other custodians that we have?
00:06:40.245 - 00:07:29.839, Speaker C: They custody over 90% of U.S. treasuries. And the bony payment rails and bony tri party is how money and Treasuries move across the entirety of sort of US Banked the US banking system. And so when you have the largest custodian and the most trusted custodian of U.S. government securities, which are the risk free securities in the entire world, it's a big deal. And that's only going to spur further adoption by folks. And it's meaningful in the sense that the SEC is not fighting the banks on this stuff.
00:07:29.839 - 00:08:12.311, Speaker C: It allows them to hold it on their balance sheet without a really punitive capital charge. It allows them to provide services. And so it's very meaningful. And I think in terms of the precedent it sets, that means other banks are going to seek the exemption and try to do the same thing and now lead to just a lot more US institutions trying to play in the same game. Because right now Boney doesn't custody any Bitcoin, right. Or whatever it does. It may be minimal, but that looks like market share that another bank can possibly gain.
00:08:12.311 - 00:08:16.255, Speaker C: Right? And so all of these banks are going to try to compete in that space.
00:08:16.335 - 00:08:20.271, Speaker D: Bank of New York, founded by Alexander Hamilton himself.
00:08:20.463 - 00:08:21.639, Speaker A: Oldest bank in America.
00:08:21.727 - 00:09:06.815, Speaker C: When you think about what Bitcoin is as a form of pristine collateral that has the utmost confidence of market participants in terms of that asset being theirs at all times. And there's no risk of a custodian going down, et cetera, it gives me the highest level of confidence possible in theory, not knowing anything about their custody technology, just knowing who Boney is and what they've done for the treasury market. And so I really think that it's a very, it's a giant leap is kind of what I would call it and I don't think that's an over exaggeration.
00:09:06.855 - 00:09:27.013, Speaker D: Yeah, it's so interesting. SAB121, the counting rule that required public companies from the SEC to carry client held digital assets on their balance sheets. And BNY apparently getting an exemption from that. It does seem like a very big deal. I wonder if there will be others.
00:09:27.069 - 00:09:29.141, Speaker A: That can get through with an exemption as well.
00:09:29.213 - 00:09:56.175, Speaker D: You mentioned jp. I mean as an example, Jamie Dimon, no fan of Bitcoin, but they've done a bunch of blockchain stuff. You have to assume that if BNY is successful and attracts a large amount of deposits, bitcoin deposits from the ETFs or from institutions, that this could open a floodgate. And maybe the national banks like JPM or Citi or, or GS would be trying to position here too.
00:09:56.835 - 00:10:24.255, Speaker C: No, absolutely. At the end of the day custody does make fees. It's another profit center. So I don't know why another bank is not going to pursue that opportunity. Just from a cost and revenue perspective then. The other thing to think about though is where does the lending market go for, for Bitcoin, right. It ends up becoming over time viewed as a GC asset.
00:10:24.255 - 00:11:31.737, Speaker C: By GC I mean general collateral. By general collateral I mean an asset that can be converted to cash or a cash equivalent with relatively minimal slippage and a very small haircut. Right. And so if you get to a world where Bitcoin is easily convertible into cash, it becomes one of those things that is a medium of exchange because you can easily get cash for it and transact in it and you don't actually have to sell the asset to do that transaction. And it becomes a great store of value because the Bitcoin itself as collateral will actually have a value because you can always generate cash versus it. This is almost the ultimate like, you know, endgame for Bitcoin in the sense that, you know, when you think about it being a store of value and a medium of exchange, giving Bitcoin open access to Tradfi, you know, lending markets and tradfi custody.
00:11:31.881 - 00:11:32.305, Speaker A: Right.
00:11:32.385 - 00:12:06.527, Speaker C: Gives it that value as collateral. Right. Whereas before, you know, the use cases were very limited and the US Nexus component was very limited, but now it's much more open. And so, you know, fundamentally, I think just when you start pricing in the fact that, you know, Bitcoin has value as inherent collateral right now and it's going to go become usable in tradfi. Rails. Right. Like the value proposition gets that much better in my eyes.
00:12:06.631 - 00:12:09.023, Speaker D: Thank you as always, for coming on Galaxy Brands, my friend.
00:12:09.159 - 00:12:10.715, Speaker C: Pleasure. Thank you for having me.
00:12:12.305 - 00:12:17.681, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, John Cahill, Galaxy's lead in Asia. John, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:12:17.833 - 00:12:24.265, Speaker B: Thanks, Alex. It's a real pleasure to be here. It's taken us a long time to get you out here and we're thrilled to have you with us.
00:12:24.305 - 00:12:43.747, Speaker A: It's been a lot of fun. We're recording now in Hong Kong at Galaxy's Asia headquarters. We were both in Singapore also for token 2049 and Solana Breakpoint before coming to Hong Kong. And. No, it's been a great time. The food out here is amazing. I love all types of food.
00:12:43.747 - 00:12:52.707, Speaker A: I've had bibimbap. I've had an enormous amount of the soup dumplings. What are those called? So good.
00:12:52.851 - 00:12:53.755, Speaker B: Shaolin bao.
00:12:53.835 - 00:12:59.055, Speaker A: All right, we're not going to talk about food. John, how did you get out to Hong Kong? You said you've been here for 20 years.
00:12:59.555 - 00:13:14.375, Speaker B: Yeah. So I did my first career at Goldman Sachs, spent the early part of my career in New York and effectively just didn't say no. When a second opportunity came up for Hong Kong, my expectation was to be out here for six months and that never quite wound up.
00:13:14.415 - 00:13:15.578, Speaker A: That was 20 years ago.
00:13:15.643 - 00:13:48.301, Speaker B: 20 years ago. Did my career at Goldman and wound that down in 2019 into 2020, right in time for Covid. And that kind of prepared me for this direction. Through the global financial crisis, I was front and center. We had a big balance sheet business which was directly impacted. And that's when I kind of went down the rabbit hole of the Austrian school of economics, Ludwig von Mises, and became more of a gold bug than anything else. Yeah, you know, I got the hard money itch.
00:13:48.301 - 00:13:51.461, Speaker B: And so I still have gold sitting in the Perth Mint today.
00:13:51.573 - 00:13:52.133, Speaker A: Nice.
00:13:52.269 - 00:13:57.013, Speaker B: But I think that that laid the foundation and direction for me to end.
00:13:57.029 - 00:14:14.377, Speaker A: Up in this, because the unprecedented intervention of the great financial crisis, as they call it, and then the backstopping. Right. The entrance of phrases like too big to fail. Right. It's a perverted situation that happened in markets.
00:14:14.401 - 00:14:34.273, Speaker B: I mean, I think I'm a free market absolutist when things boil down. And there was a time where the Chinese market was maybe the most free market in the planet, where entrepreneurs were building companies and going public, and the US and Western world had massive intervention. And it was really a managed economy more than anything else.
00:14:34.329 - 00:14:42.849, Speaker A: So I assume this sets the stage for your interest in bitcoin and crypto later. I mean, at some point. When did you Find out about it.
00:14:42.897 - 00:15:03.925, Speaker B: Yeah, I found out about Bitcoin in 2013. A good friend of mine was really into it. In fact, I brought him into Goldman and did a couple sessions with our equities business and the private wealth management business. And I didn't buy enough. Like everybody. Yeah, but that, that, that was where I bought a couple of bitcoin. Back then there was an ATM in Hong Kong which I.
00:15:03.925 - 00:15:19.021, Speaker B: Which I used to purchase the bitcoin and didn't do much with it. I just kind of sat on it and I was definitely one of those people in 2017 telling the juniors, don't put your whole bonus in bitcoin, guys. Things are good now, but, you know, just be careful, you know, size accordingly.
00:15:19.093 - 00:15:19.461, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:19.533 - 00:15:47.737, Speaker B: And so I was. I was very much, you know, in the traditional, you know, model of finance. And it wasn't until I retired and left Tradfi that I spent the time, really went down the rabbit hole, got my hands on the tools and a lot had happened in that time. Oh, yeah, that was interesting to me. You know, we did carry trades for a living. And all of a sudden there was, there was yield. There was yield farming, there was NFTs and DeFi was coming online.
00:15:47.737 - 00:15:49.131, Speaker B: And that was super interesting to me.
00:15:49.193 - 00:16:18.041, Speaker A: Yeah, it is. And I just think about those meetings when, you know, some early smart person has found out about bitcoin and they talk their way into a meeting with like, executives at like, a large bank just to, like, give a little. Come on in and give a presentation about it. Right? Like 2013, 14, 15. And basically everyone in that room thinks you're a crazy person. And like, just if you're one of those people, like, how do you feel now? You know, it's like even at Fidelity, it was almost like people. Abby Johnson herself was very interested in bitcoin.
00:16:18.041 - 00:16:27.249, Speaker A: And I witnessed people sort of like nodding with her but being like this. She can't be serious about this behind her back. It's crazy. Everyone was wrong and we were right.
00:16:27.417 - 00:16:29.905, Speaker B: Well, look, have you victory lapped at all?
00:16:30.025 - 00:16:31.297, Speaker A: I am victory lapping.
00:16:31.441 - 00:16:39.185, Speaker B: It took me unplugging from the matrix of my career to really spend time and really kind of wrap my hands around it.
00:16:39.265 - 00:16:50.243, Speaker A: So background in trading and in traditional finance in Hong Kong, knew about bitcoin, was interested in it. All this stuff happened. How then did you get to Galaxy? How long have you been at Galaxy?
00:16:50.299 - 00:17:06.835, Speaker B: Yeah, I've been to Galaxy a little over three years. I joined the Asia business to kind of help build out the team. We had six or seven people when I joined. We're now up to 40. We're kind of at scale on the trading side of the business. Now we're going to add some other segments to the mix.
00:17:06.915 - 00:17:20.057, Speaker A: Okay, so based in Hong Kong, you're extending what Galaxy's businesses out across Asia, you've got. I mean. Yeah. What's the scene like out here? Who are you selling services to or whatever? Who are your clients and counterparties?
00:17:20.121 - 00:17:54.307, Speaker B: Yeah, look, I mean, our job as Galaxy is to deliver the firm, you know, and we don't always have subject matter expertise on the ground, but we have to rely on, you know, the different subject matter experts we have. Our counterparts are kind of the same everywhere. It's high net worth, it's family office, it crypto native. It really does run the gamut. And there's an awful lot of activity out here in Asia, and particularly in Hong Kong. Hong Kong played a big role in kind of the origin story of bitcoin and adoption. This is a lot of the exchanges were born here and grew up here.
00:17:54.307 - 00:18:11.905, Speaker B: A lot of them have now gone elsewhere. Some of that's for regulatory stuff, which we can talk about in a little while. But it was a very prominent place in kind of the history of bitcoin. This is going back to 13, 14, 15, before a lot of people had devoted their careers to the space.
00:18:12.245 - 00:18:31.147, Speaker A: And I mean, China, mainland had dominated bitcoin mining for so long. There's been a long history of a lot of bitcoin and a lot of crypto out here. I mean, just at that token 2049 conference we were at, I mean, I've been to most of the big conferences this year, and that was by far the largest, huge interest.
00:18:31.291 - 00:18:45.363, Speaker B: It was a circus. Yeah, it was, it was pretty wild. I mean, look, the other thing is Asia is like the center of retail participation in all kinds of stuff. And so a lot of the more wacky projects are kind of born and do get some traction here.
00:18:45.419 - 00:19:06.741, Speaker A: Yeah. So when we think about the opportunity then, is it, is it, is it because of regulatory like. I guess maybe what is the regulatory like, landscape look like? Because there was a time, I remember when, and partly maybe this is why some of the exchanges that were here had left where it became sort of illegal in Hong Kong to operate a crypto exchange or a crypto business. But that's not the case anymore.
00:19:06.893 - 00:19:30.271, Speaker B: Well, it's been an evolution. So there was no regs for a long time, as we all know. And then Hong Kong started to introduce some regs, although slowly. And there is a framework for running an exchange here, but it's quite narrow. And so there are three regulated exchanges right now, but their ability to kind of commercialize the business is very limited. It's only spot trading. It's only a handful of coins that get listed.
00:19:30.271 - 00:19:40.223, Speaker B: I think the groundwork is there for a lot more different types of products to come online. But we don't have perps or futures in the regulated framework here.
00:19:40.279 - 00:19:49.395, Speaker A: Yeah. And then in the other jurisdictions, like in Japan, it's quite strict. Right. What are the big markets? Japan, Korea.
00:19:49.915 - 00:19:51.115, Speaker B: Yeah. And Singapore.
00:19:51.195 - 00:19:52.043, Speaker A: Singapore, yeah.
00:19:52.179 - 00:20:04.691, Speaker B: Singapore is where a lot of the business had migrated kind of during COVID Covid restrictions in Hong Kong were pretty harsh and a lot of people, for one reason or another, whether it was reg or just kind of quality of life, decided to go somewhere else.
00:20:04.763 - 00:20:19.985, Speaker A: Right. And so that, so is that what you spend your time like talking to, flying around to these areas? I mean, what about Japan? Right. Japan's what, one of the largest economies in the world. Mount Gox is the only thing that I really know a lot about from Japan.
00:20:20.445 - 00:20:40.371, Speaker B: Japan's a tricky one because it's kind of a locals to locals market. Korea is similar. I used to tell a joke that Australia is the other local to local market. They have very strict rules around participation. Capital doesn't necessarily move freely across borders. There are all kinds of restrictions. They've also been slow on the regulatory side.
00:20:40.453 - 00:21:00.395, Speaker A: Yeah. What do you think? All right, let's step back a little bit. Not necessarily Asia specific, but like, what's your long term either vision for crypto or your utopia? Like if I, if you wake up tomorrow and you're like, dude, we completely won, like bitcoin won, crypto won, like, what does that mean to you in your mind? Like, what's your like, future end state vision for crypto adoption?
00:21:00.775 - 00:21:09.335, Speaker B: I think it's fully abstracted adoption. And what that means to me is you kind of, you know, nobody thought about how payments get processed.
00:21:09.415 - 00:21:09.775, Speaker A: Right.
00:21:09.855 - 00:21:38.061, Speaker B: You know, one of my theses for being in the space is also about just better software wins over time. It's the software reach the world value proposition. If the only use case at the end of the day for this industry is changing the plumbing, upgrading the plumbing for the financial industry. It's a multitrillion dollar value proposition. And I think that's, that's where we end up. Yeah, it's taking a lot longer than, you know, a lot of us think it should and there's a lot of reasons for that. But there's no question.
00:21:38.061 - 00:21:49.197, Speaker B: And look, Larry Fink is on board this train as well. There's no question that software reaches the world and the better operating system wins. And I think blockchain technology for a lot of this stuff is the better operating system.
00:21:49.261 - 00:21:55.517, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess it's like, it's just, it's replacing the piping in an old house is really. You got to rip the walls down to get to it.
00:21:55.581 - 00:21:58.013, Speaker B: Yeah, it's hard. Yeah, it's hard to build the plan while you're flying.
00:21:58.069 - 00:22:02.829, Speaker A: A lot of entrenched interests and parties that are aligned in it not happening.
00:22:02.877 - 00:22:03.109, Speaker C: Right.
00:22:03.157 - 00:22:06.949, Speaker A: Rent seeking intermediaries that if they're disintermediated, they lose money.
00:22:07.077 - 00:22:16.301, Speaker B: Look, a lot of this does come down to margins getting squeezed for people who have been incumbent in doing this for 100 years.
00:22:16.373 - 00:22:45.263, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I feel like this is a question I like to ask because some people have very different views of what winning looks like. I mean, remember when the ETFs were launching in the US people Bitcoin or friends of mine were like, well, wait a sec, this isn't good. Why are we cheering? Like we're supposed to be, you know, it's supposed to be mined at home on a home computer and stored like in your own self custody. We're not supposed to be simping for the institutions. And I kind of think like this is what like winning looks like. Right. You're gonna have Bitcoin in every type of account that exists.
00:22:45.439 - 00:23:07.581, Speaker B: And maybe because it's my career in tradfi, I have a very pragmatic approach to this stuff. You know, there are way points on the way to Valhalla. There's a lot of steps in between where we are today and where we want to get to. And I don't think you get there without these incremental changes. More people owning Bitcoin is better for the market. More adoption is better. Easier access is better.
00:23:07.581 - 00:23:36.093, Speaker B: You know, we can, we can debate whether the ETFs are good. Is there concentration risk there? Probably there is, but I think, you know, net net, I think it's better. I think we also have to, you know, teach people and generationally around things like self sovereignty, which is just an important ideal that's important to me. And I'll, you know, teach my son because I think some of those things are not as prominent as they ought to be and they used to be.
00:23:36.149 - 00:23:47.693, Speaker A: Yeah, they definitely not. I think that's a great point. Right. It's not just that, you know, buying the asset and using the tools but perhaps living the fundamentals, living the.
00:23:47.829 - 00:23:54.737, Speaker B: There's philosophical underpinnings to this that I think are really important for the world, not just for bitcoin and further crypto adoption.
00:23:54.921 - 00:24:00.377, Speaker A: You're also involved in something called web3women. What is that, John? And how is that going to help crypto?
00:24:00.441 - 00:24:40.141, Speaker B: Yeah. Web3Women is an organization that I got involved in about a year ago. A friend of mine, Vivian Koo, started it with a couple other people based in Hong Kong and Singapore. It's effectively to educate and to help network for women who are interested in the space or already in the space and want to take on mentees and help propagate the industry. I look at part of our job as Galaxy is to be an employer of choice and to access the broadest, most talented people we can find. And I think crypto underserves the broadest community. And I think these efforts, I think in part will help open some doors for people.
00:24:40.213 - 00:25:22.191, Speaker A: Yeah, that's great. What about looking forward, say, even just for the rest of the year? I've been asking a lot of people while I've been out here what their take is on the presidential election in the US not like necessarily the politics of it, but it is a catalyst. My view has been it's actually really quite difficult to see through when it comes to price action. See past that. That's sort of like the key domino that has to fall before the market, and not just in our market, but maybe even a lot of markets can figure out where to head next. What's it been like as an American abroad, but also in our industry, like, waiting for this to resolve. And do you think, is there some other catalyst before? Or is this really the thing we're all sitting around waiting for?
00:25:22.223 - 00:25:47.269, Speaker B: Yeah, I've been an American abroad for a long time. It does give you a unique perspective. It's a little bit. You can look at it almost from an outsider perspective and look, this is kind of a car crash in slow motion, and it's kind of going to be a jump ball. I think at the end of the day, I don't think it's catastrophic, no matter what happens for our industry or for America at large, despite both sides.
00:25:47.357 - 00:25:49.493, Speaker A: Claim it is, though, which is the annoying part.
00:25:49.589 - 00:26:06.047, Speaker B: I mean, this is where we are, right. The fringes are pushing further to the edges and they're dominating the conversation. And so you can kind of look at it and step back and be a little bit removed. And there are benefits to not living in the US Sometimes.
00:26:06.141 - 00:26:34.221, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, it is Wall to wall coverage. And it does. I feel like my, I agree, not catastrophic for our industry. Some inroads appear to be being made with the Harris campaign from, from crypto. But in any case, I feel like we're, it can't really get worse, more hostile than the Biden administration's general attitude towards crypto. So it's, we're looking at like, you know, neutral to maybe even slightly positive to know, very positive as a likely outcome.
00:26:34.221 - 00:26:36.013, Speaker A: So that, that feels good to actually.
00:26:36.149 - 00:26:40.925, Speaker B: The balance of probabilities support what we're, what we're trying to do in the direction where I think the industry is going.
00:26:41.005 - 00:27:00.553, Speaker A: Yeah, I think. And do people in Hong Kong, do they follow the election just generally like how much does it matter? Because I'm not joking. In the US it is a fever pitch. You can't get away from it. Knocking on your door like I'm having pieces of paper stuffed through my door about one side or another. I got a million text messages stop to end. You know, it's insane.
00:27:00.669 - 00:27:01.161, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:27:01.273 - 00:27:02.325, Speaker A: Do they care?
00:27:03.665 - 00:27:29.701, Speaker B: The United States is the most important economy in the world. So everybody who cares about economics and finance and business looks to the US US is a leader on regulatory stuff. Yeah, they're not as obsessed with it. They're not as, you know, surrounded by it constantly, but it's certainly, you know, a huge focus. We're in a multi access world. Right. I don't think we kind of fully have embraced that notion, but it's true.
00:27:29.701 - 00:27:54.385, Speaker B: And China is one of those axes, us being the other one. And so I think China's looking at it very closely and I think what happens in our industry, China will have some responses. I think there's a narrative and a story about de dollarizing that's probably never going to go away. And I think cryptocurrency is part of that story for the East.
00:27:54.875 - 00:28:03.947, Speaker A: Is it an opening in crypto that like the restrictive US regime has created?
00:28:04.011 - 00:28:26.229, Speaker B: Is that why here in Hong Kong we're in a regulatory sandbox for stablecoins? You know, there's four projects that have government kind of implicit backing and we're going to see more of that. We're going to see CBDCs live in. I know, I know. Well, look, blockchain technology is great for decentralization and perfect for centralization.
00:28:26.317 - 00:28:36.373, Speaker A: Yes, it is. It is. Yeah, that's a good point. People don't, people don't make that point enough that blockchains are great for a lot of things, including total surveillance.
00:28:36.429 - 00:28:46.295, Speaker B: It's a tool and you can use the tool in different ways. And so I agree with you. I don't love CBDCs. There's lots of different ways to implement, and so I think we'll see a lot of different.
00:28:46.485 - 00:29:10.027, Speaker A: But that's so interesting because we've got no action on CBDC from the Fed in the us We've got no framework for stablecoins. We've got no ability to be part of an innovation sandbox with the regulators. But that's not true here. Right. And so it does feel like this is what we've been saying. I said if we drop the ball, somebody else might pick it up and we might not like the way they play the game. And like that is happening.
00:29:10.027 - 00:29:15.423, Speaker A: Right. I mean, it's sort of like innovate in America or it will be innovated upon you from elsewhere.
00:29:15.519 - 00:29:30.183, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, this stuff, you can't stop. You can try to guide it in Hong Kong, they've, I would say, have an open mind and, you know, they're getting the blessing from mainland China for this stuff. And we'll see innovation come from it.
00:29:30.359 - 00:29:37.247, Speaker A: All right, last question before we wrap. What's got you most excited for the next year or so, either in Asia or in crypto or in general? Like, what's the.
00:29:37.391 - 00:30:24.527, Speaker B: Oh, look, we're really hitting our stride at Galaxy here in Hong Kong. We've got a great team. It's a cohesive unit, feels like a family and just doing more growing, setting up a few more verticals, getting a few more visits from our global colleagues and really demonstrating what a diversified offering brings. There's not a conversation in this business that we can't have. And we can bring real value and real creativity to solving problems and moving the market forward, whether it's from a regulatory standpoint, from an operating standpoint. We're in a regulatory licensing process right now ourselves, and we have to be first in a lot of the stuff we do. That's our job.
00:30:24.631 - 00:30:33.521, Speaker A: I love it. Well, thank you again, John, for having me here in Hong Kong and coming on Galaxy Brains. John Cahill, COO of Asia for Galaxy.
