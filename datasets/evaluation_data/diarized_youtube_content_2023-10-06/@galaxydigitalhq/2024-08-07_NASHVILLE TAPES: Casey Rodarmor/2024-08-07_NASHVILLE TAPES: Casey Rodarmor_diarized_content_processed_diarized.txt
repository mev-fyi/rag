00:00:00.800 - 00:00:03.758, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, an infinite amount of cash.
00:00:03.854 - 00:00:04.510, Speaker B: Cash.
00:00:04.670 - 00:00:13.810, Speaker A: I'm your host, Alex Thornton. The us banking system is sound and resilient. Bitcoin made a new all time high. If you're not long. If you're not long, you're short.
00:00:14.110 - 00:00:22.330, Speaker B: Satoshi's gonna come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet. All bitcoin's gonna be erased. Bitcoin. Bitcoin's the best crypto else.
00:00:22.990 - 00:00:43.298, Speaker A: Bitcoin is going to zero. Welcome back to Galaxy Brands. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmware research at Galaxy Digital. This is the Nashville tapes. On this edition, we're talking with Casey Rodemore, Bitcoin developer, inventor of inscriptions and ordinals. It's a fascinating conversation. Also going to talk with Casey about his new file sharing project, not related to bitcoin or crypto, but also very interesting.
00:00:43.298 - 00:01:00.506, Speaker A: It's a fascinating one. Let's get right into the talk. Before we get to the show, I need to remind you, please refer to link to disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Welcome Casey Rotomore, creator of ordinals and runes on bitcoin. Welcome back to Galaxy Brains.
00:01:00.538 - 00:01:04.606, Speaker B: Casey, my man, Alex Thorne. It's been a while. I'm very glad to be back.
00:01:04.718 - 00:01:06.774, Speaker A: We met on Clubhouse. Remember those days?
00:01:06.822 - 00:01:07.382, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right.
00:01:07.406 - 00:01:08.238, Speaker A: That was good times.
00:01:08.294 - 00:01:11.190, Speaker B: Before Twitter, space God, that was a moment.
00:01:11.230 - 00:01:11.790, Speaker A: You know, it was.
00:01:11.830 - 00:01:14.614, Speaker B: It was. It was like, really before the eternal September.
00:01:14.702 - 00:01:21.574, Speaker A: It really was like there was like a six months right in there. They declined an acquisition offer from Facebook.
00:01:21.702 - 00:01:23.134, Speaker B: Looks like a mistake at this point.
00:01:23.182 - 00:01:44.930, Speaker A: It does. Casey, I want to talk to you about ordinals a little bit. And runes and bitcoin, but also a new project. You were telling me right before we were recording that you were working on a new file sharing project you and I both share a common interest in. Let's start, though. And for our audience, I think Casey was on Galaxy Brains February 7 of.
00:01:44.970 - 00:01:49.810, Speaker B: 2023, right in the depths of the madness. This is when I was rocketing.
00:01:49.930 - 00:02:00.034, Speaker A: Yeah. I inscribed my own avatar. I ended up not being sub ten k. I was 10,888. Check it out. Although eights are lucky in us.
00:02:00.082 - 00:02:00.994, Speaker B: That's true. Yeah.
00:02:01.122 - 00:02:16.366, Speaker A: But this was the era when you had to go to, like, a Dennis Porto and be like. It was like over the counter inscriptions. Like, it was right before the bots and ordinals bought and all these companies emerged and they emerged fast. That was a great episode. I encourage people to check that out. There's a good rap in there too.
00:02:16.398 - 00:02:17.702, Speaker B: Where I was, there's always a good rap.
00:02:17.766 - 00:02:40.522, Speaker A: Yeah, but a lot has changed since then. My gosh. I mean, we wrote a report, came out about a month after that, where we just predicted we had good reasons for it, but that the ordinals digital art market, we didn't even foresee the emergence of fungible tokens built on ordinals, but that it would be, I think we said four and a half billion dollars worth by 2025.
00:02:40.586 - 00:02:42.282, Speaker B: So where are we on that?
00:02:42.386 - 00:02:55.354, Speaker A: Well, I think if you included the BRC 20 tokens, we did get to like two or 3 billion wild. I think there's still time. I think, frankly, the NFT markets have been in shambles overall.
00:02:55.442 - 00:03:20.174, Speaker B: Absolutely. And I think that stuff on bitcoin sort of, it goes in cycles with the cycles that the bitcoin asset itself goes through. Right. And so I expect, you know, the next bull market that starts ripping, ripping our faces off, all the memes and all the altcoins on bitcoin will also pump, which is not investment advice. I only buy bitcoin. I only recommend that people buy bitcoin. If you want to degen in the casino, go for it.
00:03:20.174 - 00:03:24.270, Speaker B: But bitcoin is the only real asset that matters.
00:03:24.390 - 00:04:02.258, Speaker A: Absolutely. I think core to our thesis there was that I really didn't think it would be used for profile picture collections or fungible token standards, partly because Ethereum is literally purpose built for that. We did think, in particular the high fidelity of bitcoin's block space, the permanence, the immutable nature of it. I almost think of bitcoin's ledger, when we think of it this way, as a digital stone tablet. So we thought luxury items, high value art projects. In fact, to their credit, I really like that project that Yuga Labs did, I thought was quite interesting. Their generative art project.
00:04:02.258 - 00:04:20.820, Speaker A: I forgot what it was called. Something fold, twelve fold, maybe turning fold. They did a good ordinals project that I thought was closer to the types of art that I think that I hope we'll continue to see. And by the way, there are, I mean, you can scroll through ordinals.com and see like there's a ton of really interesting stuff that people are putting there.
00:04:20.940 - 00:04:54.408, Speaker B: I think that stuff is going to happen. I think it takes a long time. Like, if you look at aesthetic movements in traditional art, you know, they take decades to really fully form, you know, from very early experiments with cubism and abstract art, you know, in the fifties, in the sixties, they take a long time to develop. And so I think those things will happen. It just takes a long time, especially for traditional collectors, to start to get into digital art. But I do think it's going to happen, and I do think it's going to happen on bitcoin.
00:04:54.504 - 00:05:15.940, Speaker A: I just can't believe that people were doing digital art decades ago and then selling. You printed out copy of the code they used to generate it. That's all you could do, putting the code on the chain in a way. Or, and there are some Ethereum projects that do this, and crypto punks are all stored on chain. But that seems like a no brainer to me in general.
00:05:15.980 - 00:05:52.490, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think it's really natural. And I think a lot of people go like, oh, well, like, anybody can look at the JPEG, anybody can like right click download. But I think that that actually misses something about traditional art collecting, in that a large component of it is the ownership of the work separate from the exclusive right to view the work. And traditional art collectors, they know this and everybody kind of knows what they're buying. They're not buying the right to view the JPEG, they're viewing the rights to own the JPEG. And it's quite abstract and weird to think of ownership of a digital object separate from actual, some kind of physical possession of it.
00:05:52.830 - 00:06:01.486, Speaker A: Yeah, it is interesting. In fact, a lot of people that own famous or beautiful art, they do display it to the public in museums and stuff, but they also own it.
00:06:01.558 - 00:06:12.122, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, absolutely. You go to a museum and somebody bought some $10 million painting, and then it says on loan from Bob and Deborah so and so. And it's like, well, why did they buy it?
00:06:12.266 - 00:06:34.630, Speaker A: Right. And this was a criticism that I had of the NFT market. And I think what we're saying is a pretty valid pushback to the criticism, which was that one of my views of blockchain ledgering of assets is that it's great for tracking ownership and maintaining ownership, but most NFT projects don't actually confer ownership closer to a lease agreement.
00:06:34.710 - 00:06:57.920, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. And you get all these weird IP agreements, you get weird stuff with royalties. I always didn't want to do any kind of royalties. I think royalties are kind of stupid. I think if you own something, you should just straight up own something. But the ultimate end state of attempting to do royalties is what we're seeing on Ethereum right now, which is everybody is kind of realizing that it doesn't work.
00:06:57.920 - 00:07:02.452, Speaker B: And big players, I think you go labs essentially threatening to sue you if.
00:07:02.476 - 00:07:25.708, Speaker A: You attempt to go, you can only trade our stuff on this or that exchange that enforces royalties. I think Blur was one of the first to refuse to honor any royalties. So it became really popular for people to trade NFTs. Yeah, it's kind of a never ending cycle. I don't think people realized this until a couple of years ago that actually NFTs can't enforce royalty.
00:07:25.764 - 00:07:26.492, Speaker B: No, absolutely not.
00:07:26.516 - 00:07:29.616, Speaker A: Yeah, you can always just wrap it and then just move the wrap version.
00:07:29.708 - 00:07:46.880, Speaker B: Exactly. You can wrap it. I mean, fundamentally, this is a fundamental limitation of blockchains, which is that they don't know anything about the real world. Right. And this is why all this, like lettuce on the blockchain stuff, like, doesn't work. Right. But the information of the real sale price is not available on the blockchain.
00:07:46.880 - 00:07:58.584, Speaker B: You can slip somebody cash, you can wrap it, you can underreport it, you can do all sorts of shenanigans. Right. And so, yeah, fundamentally it just doesn't work. There's no way you can guarantee that the contract is going to have that.
00:07:58.632 - 00:08:21.100, Speaker A: Information, but you can store and transfer the items themselves and regardless of. And people are doing that. And ordinals was the first time at scale, obviously, that it's been done on bitcoin. Obviously there were, you know, things like counterparty or colored coins we're doing with, with. Not with images per se, but there are people like Dennis Porto, my friend, who's at opera turn maximal.
00:08:21.140 - 00:08:22.280, Speaker B: Opera turn maxi.
00:08:22.900 - 00:08:33.048, Speaker A: He has a tapiru wizard which says opera turn on it, which is like, I guess, his claim to fame, but nobody had done it at scale on bitcoin until ordinals. And it has turned into a scale.
00:08:33.224 - 00:09:43.042, Speaker B: It's interesting, I think about this a lot. Like there were all these earlier systems and why didn't they take off? And one of the things that I've kind of come to eventually is that I think that it has to do partially with the fact that ordinals, inscriptions, and now runes, they actually integrate really well with the rest of the bitcoin technology stack. If you look at something like counterparty, counterparty is essentially a totally different system that's totally divorced from the way that bitcoin works. And you're just putting these messages for this entirely different system that happened to be in a bitcoin transaction, but with ordinals, inscriptions and runes, they're very bitcoin native. When I want to do something with some inscriptions, that is hard to do with Ord, the software that I wrote, and it's hard to do because my software is crappy and it's missing a lot of features. I go use Sparrow, and Sparrow doesn't actually need to know anything at all about ordinals and inscriptions in order to manipulate them profitably. And this is really comes down to the fact that ordinals addresses are just bitcoin addresses.
00:09:43.042 - 00:10:27.380, Speaker B: They're Utxo based. So the same technology that lets you manage your utxos in your wallet lets you manage your inscriptions and runes, et cetera. Runes are a little bit more complicated because runes actually, when you want to do a non trivial transfer, you have to include some data in an oper turn. But for simple transfers, if you're transferring everything into Utxo, Sparrow will do just fine. And so I think it's actually that, like, integration that made it take off when previous systems failed, because I can't build everything, and the other people who work on it with me, they can't build everything. So essentially, having all this pre existing technology in the bitcoin ecosystem that interoperates is incredibly helpful for adoption and just scaling the technology on a technical and social level.
00:10:27.460 - 00:10:32.876, Speaker A: Yeah, it really is bitcoin native in that sense. You can do multi sig custody of inscriptions.
00:10:32.948 - 00:10:33.420, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:10:33.500 - 00:10:43.044, Speaker A: Basically. Anything to your point? Yeah, like back to counter coin, you need Utxo selection. That's the basic thing that you need. Right. To be cautious with not accidentally sending them.
00:10:43.132 - 00:11:11.438, Speaker B: And, for example, counterparty, like, counterparty assets are nothing custodied. They're not locked by bitcoin script. So counterparty didn't have multisig for a long time because they just hadn't implemented it. And they finally implemented it, but it was a long time. Contrast that with inscriptions. The next time we get some upgrade to bitcoin, whatever it may be, that technology will automatically benefit ordinals and inscriptions. It's also nice from my point of view, because people are like, I want to do x, y, and z.
00:11:11.438 - 00:11:23.880, Speaker B: Why don't you add it? I'm like, ah, well, inscriptions are as programmable as bitcoin. We just kind of got to wait for bitcoin to become more programmable. I can kind of like, you know, beg off, like, no, I don't have to do anything right now.
00:11:23.960 - 00:11:26.640, Speaker A: So, runes launched at the halving block.
00:11:26.720 - 00:11:27.168, Speaker B: That's right.
00:11:27.224 - 00:11:36.528, Speaker A: Which is what, 840,000 block. 840,000 sounds about right, I think. And which was April, maybe. I'm thinking back April or early May.
00:11:36.624 - 00:11:37.536, Speaker B: April or May 20.
00:11:37.568 - 00:11:41.416, Speaker A: Yeah. I can't remember, but time is a flat circle and a lot is happening.
00:11:41.448 - 00:11:42.220, Speaker B: That's right.
00:11:42.880 - 00:11:48.356, Speaker A: And so runes is a different protocol. Right. It also uses inscription.
00:11:48.428 - 00:11:48.900, Speaker B: It does not.
00:11:48.940 - 00:11:49.396, Speaker A: It does not.
00:11:49.428 - 00:12:02.708, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a totally different. Yeah. So it all comes back to, like, I forget when BRC 20 launched, but I had made inscriptions, which is just a non fungible token protocol. And around, like, I think it was.
00:12:02.724 - 00:12:05.348, Speaker A: Like spring of 23. It wasn't that long after it was.
00:12:05.444 - 00:12:24.182, Speaker B: Spring of 23, I go to ordinals.com and all of a sudden it's all these JSON text swaps. Yeah. I was like, oh, my God, like, what is this? And it got extremely popular. Like the dgens, they thirst for fungible tokens. They want high speed turbo degenering. And so BRC 20 is based on inscriptions.
00:12:24.182 - 00:12:53.614, Speaker B: And so it actually inherits a lot of complexity from inscriptions. It's essentially like one very complicated protocol. Ordinals and inscriptions. And then on top of that, another set of rules that just kind of uses inscriptions as a data carrying layer. Kind of like, kind of like counterparty embeds data in bitcoin transactions. And so I eventually got kind of irritated with all the JSON blobs on ordinals.com. and there were a lot of shortcomings of BRC 20.
00:12:53.614 - 00:13:11.916, Speaker B: Things like you could front run somebody's choice of name. It doesn't integrate quite as well with bitcoin software. It's not utxo based, it's address based. And so I was like, all right, I'm going to. I guess the degens wanted, I'm going to do a fungible token protocol. Yeah. And so the goal with runes is really to create something like very simple.
00:13:11.916 - 00:13:42.040, Speaker B: And that's why it's separate from inscriptions. It's a very simple protocol. The core is messages are in operturns. They're called runestones and they dictate how the runes in each utxo move from the inputs to the outputs. And if you look at the core of the protocol, it's something like 2000 lines of code. Just look at this transaction, update the database entries for the inputs and outputs. And I'm really happy with how it's been received.
00:13:42.040 - 00:14:07.652, Speaker B: I don't know if it's going to go anywhere, but just what I've been hearing from a technical point of view is like, this is great. It's easy to integrate, it's simple, it's lightweight, the software works well. No, real weird things that have happened. When you release something, really all you care about is, please let there be no bugs. Please let there not have been some crazy oversight that I didn't think about that. Now the system is burning to the ground. So that has happened.
00:14:07.652 - 00:14:13.024, Speaker B: There have been no bugs. There's one tiny bug, one little one, but it was a baby bug. So, yeah, it's working as intended.
00:14:13.112 - 00:14:13.568, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:14:13.624 - 00:14:24.160, Speaker B: Yeah. And they're all, you know, they're all s. Coins. You know, I wouldn't tell anybody to go, go buy any of them, but technically it works. And I think it's fun to be able to have this, like, degenerate sky casino.
00:14:24.280 - 00:14:47.084, Speaker A: I mean, I think it is very interesting, the idea that the DTCC wrote a paper in 2016 that was, I think, really ahead of its time. This is the depository trust and clearing corporation. They're the ones that technically custody all us equities. So, like, when you own a stock at, like, fidelity.com, comma, really, like, they just tell the DCC that, like, now this share is. Is actually held at Fidelity on Stacy's behalf.
00:14:47.132 - 00:14:49.076, Speaker B: Layers of indirection are, like, wild.
00:14:49.148 - 00:15:08.406, Speaker A: And, you know, they wrote a paper that said, basically, blockchains should disintermediate us. And it was very forward thinking. I think they're still right. We haven't seen that, obviously, but they are the definition of a centralized intermediary. And actually, the story is kind of interesting. It used to be totally peer to peer bilaterally and settled between brokerage houses. The shares.
00:15:08.406 - 00:15:16.390, Speaker A: You sell 100 shares of Apple at your brokerage firm, and I buy at mine. And, like, we have to actually physically move those specific non fungible shares.
00:15:16.430 - 00:15:18.126, Speaker B: Somebody runs it over, literally.
00:15:18.318 - 00:15:44.474, Speaker A: And stock investing exploded in the sixties, and literally, shares were getting, like, dropped in puddles and, like, left on desk. It was so bad, they called the paperwork crisis on Wall Street. A quarter of all brokerage firms went out of business. NySE had to close at noon every Wednesday to give four extra hours for all those record keeping that was happening. So they created a centralized intermediary. And I always think about how if our natural state was to just work directly with each other.
00:15:44.522 - 00:15:44.930, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:15:44.970 - 00:16:07.928, Speaker A: But sometimes complexity ends up leading to centralization. If only there had been a technology. And so my long point of the story is that I would, I think in many ways that similarly, the way number go up, might orange pill someone to then become a truer bitcoiner later, you know, like, come for the gains, and I stay for the world changing movement. So, too might, like, you know, random.
00:16:08.104 - 00:16:10.408, Speaker B: Protocol settlement between two parties.
00:16:10.504 - 00:16:16.680, Speaker A: It's not the domino like Casey releases inscriptions and then like ten dominoes later is like overhaul of the us financial system.
00:16:16.760 - 00:16:22.784, Speaker B: So I would somebody else launch the first domino, but I definitely appreciate the compliment.
00:16:22.832 - 00:16:40.188, Speaker A: Yeah, well, and I. But one of the. So this, I'll lead it to a question here, is, you know, maybe we are only seeing meme coins and stuff like that for the most part on runes today, or BRC twenties. I'm not aware of any that have any real utility in on the network. Partly because you can't really do anything with tokens on bitcoin.
00:16:40.244 - 00:16:59.324, Speaker B: You can't really do anything with tokens, period. I mean, if you look at, you know, what are the actual use cases that have product market fit? They're essentially just speculation and gambling. Right. There's like Defi. Defi is just weird ways of like redressing a Ponzi scheme. I think probably the only things that have utility are really centralized stablecoins. Right.
00:16:59.372 - 00:17:04.774, Speaker A: So this was going to be my question. Could we, could you build a stable coin on runes or on BRC twenties for that matter?
00:17:04.822 - 00:17:05.550, Speaker B: Oh yeah, certainly.
00:17:05.630 - 00:17:07.810, Speaker A: Can you do like creation and redemption?
00:17:08.190 - 00:17:13.102, Speaker B: So for technical reasons, I have it so that all runes, when you create them, you create them.
00:17:13.206 - 00:17:14.030, Speaker A: Fixed supply. Right?
00:17:14.070 - 00:17:39.430, Speaker B: Fixed supply. There's a lot of that avoids a lot of technical complexity and a lot of nasty surprises. But if you were a stable coin issuer, what you would do is you're like, okay, I'm going to create literally two to the 64 units, which is more units than you ever possibly need. It's like trillions. Trillions of trillions, yeah. And then just keep them in reserve in cold storage. And when somebody sends you a dollar, you send them one of those and you can publish your reserve address so you can be audited.
00:17:39.430 - 00:17:48.406, Speaker B: And whenever somebody wants to get their dollar back, you either burn it or you send it back to this sort of central reserve.
00:17:48.518 - 00:17:53.918, Speaker A: I think that was what I had guessed the way to do this was. I didn't realize you could do that many units.
00:17:53.974 - 00:17:59.850, Speaker B: Oh yeah. Two to the 60. No, two to the 128. Sorry, it's an absurd number. It's like more.
00:18:00.150 - 00:18:02.022, Speaker A: Two times 2128 times.
00:18:02.086 - 00:18:06.688, Speaker B: That's right. And it's more. It's more, you know, units than like atoms in the galaxy.
00:18:06.744 - 00:18:07.792, Speaker A: Okay, so we're good then.
00:18:07.816 - 00:18:08.496, Speaker B: I'm good. Yeah.
00:18:08.528 - 00:18:24.464, Speaker A: I was like, oh, maybe the Max is like 21 million or some number. And then it's like, well, even then you just create another one and you're like, okay, this is like you know, USDB for bitcoin, one USDB, two USD, they're all the same. They're all managed by the same issue. But in any case. Okay, so it is possible.
00:18:24.552 - 00:18:25.488, Speaker B: Yeah, certainly could do it.
00:18:25.544 - 00:18:27.032, Speaker A: Have you heard of anyone trying to do this yet?
00:18:27.096 - 00:19:03.700, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I've heard of some sort of more technically complicated stablecoins that are trying to do some like staked vaulted thing where you like vault your bitcoin. I think all those are just a terrible idea. As unfortunate it is that the major stablecoin issuers are centralized. I would much rather something centralized that works than something that's like pseudo decentralized or decentralized with a bunch of weird long tail risks like terra Luna that it's just going to explode. And I made runes. I really made it for meme coins and degeneracy. But it's a solid protocol.
00:19:03.700 - 00:19:04.372, Speaker B: There's no reason they.
00:19:04.396 - 00:19:10.012, Speaker A: Well, that's sort of what I'm saying is just like number grow up could lead to bitcoin movement, maybe degeneracy could lead to financial stock.
00:19:10.036 - 00:19:19.356, Speaker B: I think you got to target the DJ's first. The DGens are going to be first through the door. They're going to be the first users of your technology. So if anybody is building, I would say, yeah, build for the degens.
00:19:19.508 - 00:19:27.384, Speaker A: It's like cryptokitties is the first NFT, big NFT project on Ethereum. Then you eventually got actual art. I mean, I'm a big fan of art blocks over there.
00:19:27.392 - 00:19:28.776, Speaker B: Art blocks is sick. Love art blocks.
00:19:28.848 - 00:19:30.392, Speaker A: I like a bunch of those collections.
00:19:30.496 - 00:20:00.932, Speaker B: And we like to be all high and mighty about our freedom money, but we all love number go up. We're all like bitcoin degens. We get excited when we hit a new all time high. And that's part of what, of course everybody has their. Is kind of self interested and you've got to appeal to people's self interest. I mean, I think that's what makes bitcoin such a beautiful system is that. But it appeals to everybody's self interest and then gets them into a activity where there's no violent interference with each other.
00:20:00.932 - 00:20:22.184, Speaker B: Right. If you're in a fiat money system, like, well, what do you do? I guess you try to like grab the reins of power and be the one at the money printer. Right. On bitcoin. What do you have to do? Well, I guess you just have to do capitalism and like make, make things for people to buy and sell things and try to get more coins. And it's sort of like, a virtuous cycle. But at the root of that virtuous cycle is our own self interest.
00:20:22.272 - 00:20:44.880, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's totally right. It does create an interesting incentive alignment where the system actually thrives and builds on that selfish self interest incentivization. One of the other things that has come out of inscriptions is, I think, largely not just inscriptions, but also taproot and other recent bitcoin developments. Is this renewed interest in creating bitcoin L2 networks.
00:20:44.920 - 00:20:50.500, Speaker B: Dude, it's wild. The last count I heard that we had, like, 82 or 84 bitcoin out.
00:20:50.620 - 00:21:05.940, Speaker A: That we know of 65 roll up projects. But then one of our venture investors told me it's 100. And then I interviewed Mike Dudis on this show, who's gotten very interested in bitcoin L2s, his venture from six man ventures. He said he's personally seen 200 Dex.
00:21:06.020 - 00:21:06.300, Speaker B: Wow.
00:21:06.340 - 00:21:34.688, Speaker A: I don't know if these are all actual, like, l two s or whatever, but they're all like, bitcoin align, like Defi and l two s. But a lot of them will post their data. If they're ZK roll ups, for example, they have fraud proofs or whatever, whatever Zk data they need. That's effectively call data on ether arbitrary data for the roll up in an inscription. Because now there's a space and a method for posting slightly larger data. So that's one of those dominoes that you also set off a little bit. Not the only one.
00:21:34.688 - 00:21:36.032, Speaker A: What are your thoughts on this overall?
00:21:36.096 - 00:22:05.622, Speaker B: Yeah, no, absolutely. I think it's really interesting because the things that they use from inscriptions is really just this very simple technique of putting data in a bitcoin script that is really trivial. I came up with it myself, but I came up with it because I sat down and tried to figure out how to put data in a bitcoin transaction. Anybody who thought about it for a little bit would probably figure out the same thing. So it's not like it was some big technical innovation. I think it was actually just. It sparked everybody's imagination.
00:22:05.622 - 00:22:07.566, Speaker B: It was like, hey, look, you can build things.
00:22:07.638 - 00:22:19.912, Speaker A: It really did spark imagination. I think that's one of the best things that has come out of your ordinals and inscriptions, is that it has created a true renaissance of people asking, again, what might be possible to build on bitcoin.
00:22:19.976 - 00:22:57.104, Speaker B: Absolutely. But then as far as where we are with the technical aspect of these projects is we're really, like, nowhere. We're really at this white paper stage. And I think it's really important for people to remember that when a system gets complicated enough, like an l two or a roll up or whatever, it's really hard to figure out how it's actually going to work, if it's going to actually work until it exists. When systems get complicated, the paper description doesn't tell you, you know, how it's going to behave once it's actually implemented. I think everybody should keep in mind the Lightning network. So I'm a huge lightning network fan.
00:22:57.104 - 00:23:25.744, Speaker B: I think it's a great technology. But if you were in 2017 or whenever the white paper, the original lightning network white paper came out, you could have thought like, oh my God, this is incredible. This is the best thing since sliced bread. It solves all our problems. But as we've gotten experience with the lightning network, it turns out it is very hard to run a self custodial wallet for a normal person. It's very hard to paper over all of the things that are happening behind the scenes, like channels, openings, channel closing. You do have to go on chain.
00:23:25.744 - 00:23:54.162, Speaker B: You have inbound and outbound liquidity management. And the lightning network is, I think, the best possible outcome in terms of actually producing something valuable. But we needed to get experience with the system to understand how it would actually behave. And right now, none of these l two s exist. They're just like fever dreams. We don't know if any of them are going to be really viable, if any of them are going to produce any level of reasonable decentralization. So I'm in a very much like, wait and see.
00:23:54.162 - 00:24:00.770, Speaker B: I'm glad people are doing it. I think it's really cool that people are experimenting and researching, but who knows if anything is ever going to come about.
00:24:00.850 - 00:24:19.448, Speaker A: Yeah, one of the things I love so much about this is when you have a more generalized blockchain like that uses an EVM or something, where it's really quite easy to build. Well, the EVM has plenty of its own issues that I'm aware of, but it's, I would say, almost at least an order of magnitude easier to program an application on Ethereum than on bitcoin.
00:24:19.544 - 00:24:46.310, Speaker B: Absolutely. I mean, the way that I like to put it is that when you program on Ethereum, you really mold Ethereum to your idea. Right. You just tell Ethereum to do the things that you want. And yeah, there's a lot of problems with that execution model, a lot of rough edges. And you don't really need to adapt your idea too much to ethereum when you build on bitcoin. The process of building on bitcoin is figuring out how you can adapt your idea to the underlying chain.
00:24:46.310 - 00:25:28.674, Speaker B: Inscriptions are based on ordinals, which is this numbering and tracking of individual sats, which is really just an insane idea. Why would you go through these weird backflips to do it? And it's because, well, that was the way that you could get the idea onto bitcoin, figuring out how could you conceptualize something permanent that could be transferred across a transaction? And it's really, I didn't set out to be like, oh, I'm going to make trackable sats. That really was the best way to design the protocol. If you want to design for bitcoin, you really can't take your idea and just kind of force it square peg in a round hole. You need to think like, okay, how can I adapt my idea and make it work with the functionality that is available on bitcoin?
00:25:28.762 - 00:26:05.136, Speaker A: That's one of the things that's so exciting about new ideas that happen on bitcoin is that there's a real puzzle to solve. You have to bend the knee to bitcoin network. That really sets it apart, because the alternative has been for years, oh, well, we can't do it on bitcoin, so let's just start a whole new blockchain and put whatever features we think we might need for that. That's sort of a never ending game. That's why we have, like, I don't know, I was gonna say dozens, hundreds, probably thousands of layer one blockchains, but at least hundreds genuine ones. And, and it's also that technology innovation game that you can never really win. Right, this one.
00:26:05.136 - 00:26:36.166, Speaker A: That's one thing I love about the fact that bitcoin, the network, which isn't really an entity, but a distributed force, doesn't play that game. Instead, it's the reverse where you gotta come to bitcoin. I would love to see the roll up somehow get on bitcoin. I think roll ups are interesting technology. They're sort of, in my mind, among the most clear distillings of just what do we really need here to actually use a distributed network? Right. I mean, there's plenty of problems as well. There's no such thing as a decentralized sequencer today in the world, but absolutely, yeah.
00:26:36.238 - 00:26:39.942, Speaker B: I mean, I definitely wish them well. I hope somebody cracks that nut.
00:26:40.046 - 00:26:53.642, Speaker A: Yeah, we were talking before. You have a new project that you're working on, I think I mentioned at the beginning, but file sharing, I was going to say, you seem to be one of the common threads. I'm seeing here is a true love of digital objects.
00:26:53.786 - 00:27:23.230, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean I'm just a giant nerd. I've been using computers since I was very young. I'm 41 now. And so born in 1983 and my mom and dad actually were very plugged into technology very early. My dad was an editor at PC World magazine and my mom is a novelist and she had a Mac like very early. She had one of the original, I think she had a Mac plus and so she let me play with that thing. So I've been on computers for my whole life and I love file sharing.
00:27:23.230 - 00:28:04.078, Speaker B: And what we've seen with file sharing is that BitTorrent was very, very popular. The sort of dominant file sharing method of file sharing maybe between 2010, 2015 really kind of had its ascendancy. But then as the streaming services have appeared, they've really competed with it on like a UI UX basis. All Netflix, Spotify, they're all point and click, they're very easy. BitTorrent has all these components that you have to use together well. You've got your tracker that you access via the web, you've got your torrent client and then your torrent client can actually play any of the content you then need to download VLC or some video player. You're not going to be able to use every format.
00:28:04.078 - 00:28:46.636, Speaker B: If you want music, you have a library that you got to import things into. I'm trying to come up with a sort of of all kind of all in one application that includes a file sharing network that sort of gets you this very nice, usable end to end experience. And it's interesting, it's not exactly, it has nothing to do with cryptocurrency or bitcoin. It's not a crypto project and it's not exactly a technical project. BitTorrent works really well once you have the hash of the content that you want, finding peers who have that, who are interested in the same content and trading bits of that content back and forth until you have the whole thing. BitTorrent works phenomenally for that. I'm not really trying to improve on that.
00:28:46.636 - 00:29:44.926, Speaker B: It's really a Ui Ux problem, right? How can you sort of sand out Bittorrent? The BitTorrent experiences rough edges in that way. It's kind of like lightning, right? Like you have a system and it has some complicated weird aspects to it and you're like, well, how much can I stuff all that under the rug and let the user just click the button that says does the thing? And I don't know if I'm going to be successful. The core idea behind it is that content on BitTorrent is really just these bags of files. They're in a whole bunch of different formats. They're in a whole bunch of different organization. And so it's really hard to build a unified user experience on top of that sea of content. What does Netflix build their user experience on top of what they build on top of it is a database of every single piece of content in exactly the same format with a fixed metadata schema that lets you give this very sort of unified user experience.
00:29:44.926 - 00:30:08.258, Speaker B: You just click the movie, it streams, it streams in a format that your browser can understand. So what I'm working on is a packaging format where you can package content for this network with actually a very strict schema that's very strict about what metadata you can and can't have and the file formats. So that on top of this sort of sea of strongly typed content, you can build a really good user experience.
00:30:08.354 - 00:30:16.130, Speaker A: Interesting. And is the file sharing the network protocol of it? Is that also going to be new or are you going to use Bittorrent?
00:30:16.170 - 00:30:41.596, Speaker B: Basically, I'm probably going to write it myself. I do want to control the, the implementation. There are some small improvements that I want to make. Bittorrent is the main thing is that I don't actually think I get a whole lot by being interoperable with BitTorrent, that it's a legacy system. People would not really be interested in changing their existing practices within that legacy system.
00:30:41.668 - 00:30:49.704, Speaker A: So you're not going to, you don't think you get a lot of BitTorrent users coming over to your thing and you're not really going after the hardcore BitTorrent users anyway, at least not initially.
00:30:49.812 - 00:31:20.900, Speaker B: That it's going to be people who want to experiment with something new and not something which will incrementally improve the BitTorrent experience. Yeah, so right now I'm in the depths. I'm working on Kademlia, which is a distributed hash table implementation that BitTorrent uses to find peers that are interested in that content. And I'm doing like, it's the first time I've really had to do like really hardcore network programming and it's hard, you know, ordinals and inscriptions. That stuff is all easy. Literally all I have to do is connect to bitcoin core. Bitcoin Core says what the new blocks are, process those blocks.
00:31:20.900 - 00:31:30.800, Speaker B: I'm sort of shielded from the chaotic reality of being on the Internet. But now I'm like in there on the trench in the trenches working on complicated algorithms. And it's rough.
00:31:30.880 - 00:31:43.670, Speaker A: Yeah. You just piggyback on top of the bitcoin network, the bitcoin protocol. You don't have to actually do that networking stuff. In fact, this is something people don't realize. But a lot of the stuff that gets updated in bitcoin core upgrades and in bitcoin upgrades is networking layer stuff.
00:31:43.710 - 00:31:44.446, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:31:44.598 - 00:31:46.454, Speaker A: That's a huge, important part of the network.
00:31:46.542 - 00:32:14.360, Speaker B: Absolutely. I mean, essentially, bitcoin is a network of untrusted peers, and doing any sort of complex communication with untrustworthy peers over the Internet is just fraught with peril. Somebody sends you a message, you then have to allocate some memory for that message. How does that not turn into a situation where somebody can get you to allocate an infinite amount of memory, crash your computer. So it's. It's a. It's.
00:32:14.440 - 00:32:21.000, Speaker A: There issues with timeout. There's a thing. Bloom filters. It was really important. These are the ways that the nodes communicate with each other.
00:32:21.040 - 00:32:21.352, Speaker B: Yep.
00:32:21.416 - 00:32:25.944, Speaker A: Right. So. And that's not a consensus change even. Right.
00:32:25.992 - 00:32:26.312, Speaker B: That's right.
00:32:26.336 - 00:32:28.832, Speaker A: A software messaging protocol.
00:32:28.896 - 00:32:50.336, Speaker B: Well, yeah. The nice thing about the peer to peer network is that it doesn't all need to be upgraded in lockstep like it does for the main chain, that if two peers. You know, there's a new standard for encrypted communication over the bitcoin p, two p network, and nodes are free to support that or not. And if they. If you talk to a node that doesn't support it, you can still fall back to the old.
00:32:50.368 - 00:33:06.316, Speaker A: You just talk to a different node or. Yeah, or you go back to the old one. Yeah. Backwards compatibility is really cool, too. So before we wrap, Casey, we're at the bitcoin conference in Nashville. You were saying something interesting to me about your impressions of where we are in this moment in bitcoin. It's truly seeming kind of wild to me.
00:33:06.316 - 00:33:23.428, Speaker A: I mean, we're. We're just above the enterprise hall here, but Senator Cynthia Loomis was just speaking on the main stage. I think current independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy junior is speaking in a few moments. What does that mean to you? I mean, what's the feeling that you're getting from this situation?
00:33:23.524 - 00:33:58.260, Speaker B: I mean, I think that, you know, if you think bitcoin is going to succeed in a really big way, the way that we all hope and think it can, it will enter a geopolitical era where it becomes. Starts to become systemically important and systemically interesting. And it feels to me like we're maybe knocking on the door of that geopolitical era. Governments, they hold their own money. They hold the money of other states. They hold debt, but they've always been interested in gold. They've always been interested in gold as a reserve asset.
00:33:58.260 - 00:35:19.980, Speaker B: And so that I see as the fundamental sort of beginning of the next era of bitcoin. It's going to be central banks establishing a strategic reserve of bitcoin, the asset, for their own political ends. And that could really kick off a chain reaction very quickly. If a sitting us president said, we are going to establish a bitcoin strategic reserve, the dam would break and things would get crazy really fast. And it's going to be a delicate era in bitcoins journey because we're going to start seeing these entities that do have a lot of power starting to be interested in this decentralized peer to peer network and certainly trying to co opt it, certainly trying to control it. I think the best possible outcome is going to be that they all fight each other for control of bitcoin, and they actually all benefit from its neutrality. And so their strategy to participate in the network is actually just to strengthen it, to try to keep it neutral, all fighting over each other for more of the asset and more of the miners producing the asset, but ultimately, in a way where, through their own self interests, they compete via actually strengthening the network.
00:35:19.980 - 00:35:24.658, Speaker B: I think things are going to get weird. I think it's going to be the weirdest phase.
00:35:24.754 - 00:35:59.386, Speaker A: I really do think so, too. It's going to be very weird. RFK has a proposal to partially back the us dollar with metal, precious metals and bitcoin. There's this rumor that has been started that president, former President Donald Trump, who's speaking here tomorrow, right. We're recording on Thursday, July 26, he may announce something along these lines. It does feel like if the United States does, basically, I don't think they need to establish a strategic reserve of coins, but a national bitcoin policy or strategy. You know, we're already the leader basically, in this entire network.
00:35:59.386 - 00:36:13.096, Speaker A: I think we have the most hash rate, but, but also I probably the most coins literally custodied inside our borders, I would bet, and I would dare say, and I apologize to my friends in different countries, the most intellectual capital I bet is in the United States.
00:36:13.158 - 00:36:13.628, Speaker B: Could be.
00:36:13.724 - 00:36:18.900, Speaker A: Could be. So it is going to get weird. Casey, my friend, thank you so much for coming back on Galaxy Branch.
00:36:18.940 - 00:36:22.720, Speaker B: My pleasure. Thank you as always for having me. This has been great. Yeah, awesome.
