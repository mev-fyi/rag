00:00:00.600 - 00:00:47.614, Speaker A: This is a bill that wants to register and find financial reporting coming from people who are running a node in their house, people who are operating a self hosted wallet, which is just a wallet, like you said, because they want to hold their own bitcoin. That is a big change. The first version of this bill was introduced actually December of last year. It hasn't changed much since then. She's gotten a couple more co sponsors for the reintroduction now. And at the time we wrote a blog post and we said, look, we've been around waiting for this, but most of the work we've done to date in 2022, from 2014 to 2022, was sort of helping politicians understand the unintended consequences of their laws.
