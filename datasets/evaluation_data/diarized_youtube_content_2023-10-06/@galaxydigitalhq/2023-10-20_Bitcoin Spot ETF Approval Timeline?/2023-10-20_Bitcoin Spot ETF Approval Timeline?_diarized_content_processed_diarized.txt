00:00:00.200 - 00:00:01.990, Speaker B: Broadly speaking, these developments.
00:00:02.062 - 00:00:03.086, Speaker A: Were constructive.
00:00:03.190 - 00:00:22.406, Speaker B: The price action that you've seen after has been healthy, and it's now going to be at the forefront of people's minds that we might have an ETF that gets approved before year end or in and around year end. And so you don't want to be caught with your pants down in an asset that can literally moon.
00:00:22.510 - 00:00:56.374, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. It was an exciting and obviously strange thing that happened just for our listeners. If you didn't see, although I'm sure almost everyone did, Cointelegraph had apparently erroneously, certainly erroneously, we know now, but didn't right away posted that BlackRock's bitcoin ETF spot application had been approved by the SEC. That was false. It has not. None have been approved. I think prudent for market observers to rely on official communications from the SEC and others, maybe issuers or something, to find out when that happens.
