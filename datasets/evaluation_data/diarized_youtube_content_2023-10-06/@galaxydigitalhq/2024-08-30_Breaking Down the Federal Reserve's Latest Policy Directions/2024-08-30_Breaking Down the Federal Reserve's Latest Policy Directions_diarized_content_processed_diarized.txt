00:00:00.400 - 00:00:54.525, Speaker A: He basically reinforced the expectations for the Fed to cut pretty aggressively over the course of the next year. You had fixed income rally on the back of his speech, dollar sell off. And so I think none of what he said really came as a surprise to the market. And in all honesty, you're basically at the point where the Fed recognizes the fact that monetary policy has been restrictive for a long period of time and that restrictiveness is beginning to impact the labor market. In addition, that restrictiveness may not be warranted with respect to the price level or the rate of change of the price level. And so with that in mind, you probably need to be at neutral sooner rather than later.
