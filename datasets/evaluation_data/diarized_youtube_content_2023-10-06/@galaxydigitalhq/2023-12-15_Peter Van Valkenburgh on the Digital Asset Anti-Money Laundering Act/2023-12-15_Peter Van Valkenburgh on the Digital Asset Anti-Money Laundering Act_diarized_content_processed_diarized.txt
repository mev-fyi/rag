00:00:00.320 - 00:00:56.194, Speaker A: The only aspect of bank regulation this creates for these entities in crypto is financial surveillance. It says if you are operating a node, if you are mining, if you are holding your own bitcoin in a wallet, a self hosted wallet to use their terminology, then you need to know your customer, which is kind of ridiculous in the self hosted wallet context, obviously, or in the mining context because none of these people have customers. And the implication is you need to know every name, physical address, Social Security number of every person behind every transaction you deal with. So if you were a minor putting these transactions into blocks, you could be found on the wrong side of this law and prosecuted. If this was to become law for not knowing the name and physical address of all the people who wanted transactions in your block. It's absolutely unenforceable, nonsensical if you actually understand how the technology works. But again, I don't think it's a mistake.
