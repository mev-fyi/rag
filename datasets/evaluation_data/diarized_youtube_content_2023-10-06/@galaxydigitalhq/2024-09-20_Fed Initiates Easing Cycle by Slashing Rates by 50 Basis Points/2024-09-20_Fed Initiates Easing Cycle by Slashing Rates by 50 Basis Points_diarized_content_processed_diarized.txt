00:00:07.560 - 00:00:12.725, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:13.505 - 00:00:14.769, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:14.937 - 00:00:16.925, Speaker A: Big day today. Fed Day.
00:00:18.145 - 00:00:19.417, Speaker B: Almost a Super Bowl.
00:00:19.521 - 00:00:36.875, Speaker A: Well, it did. They came out and they cut rates by 50 basis points. It seemed like markets were ultimately pricing right around there. But still even I'm actually in Asia right now. But waking up to see the headlines. Seems like there was surprise.
00:00:37.035 - 00:01:19.755, Speaker B: No, there was a little bit of surprise for sure. But I think high level. What the main thing you got to take away from this is that the easing cycle has begun. Right. This is the first time we're cutting rates since basically Covid and we started with a cut that was about was significant enough to actually matter with 50 basis points. It was a small surprise to the market in the sense that you only had 40 basis points priced in going in. And so there was some chance that folks were thinking 25.
00:01:19.755 - 00:02:07.765, Speaker B: Besides that, I do think it was the appropriate decision. We've seen the labor market start to show signs of cooling. Inflation has calmed down materially. The employment side of the mandate is important to focus on at the moment. And so when you're already at 525 to 550 and you're seeing the data head in this direction, it's entirely appropriate to cut rates by 50 basis points. There's a couple of things that I thought were notable. One, you did have a dissent for the first time in a while by Fed member bowman who wanted 25 basis points.
00:02:07.765 - 00:03:04.005, Speaker B: Secondly, they changed their unemployment forecast for the end of 2025 in terms of the unemployment rate to 4.4%, which is an uptick from here. But it does show that that is kind of what they're thinking in terms of where the labor market is headed. We're probably going to slow down, but there was plenty in the pressure that kind of acknowledge the fact that the economy is still in a half decent shape. Growth figures are pretty reasonable. If you look at Atlanta GDP now forecast for Q3 GDP, that's almost close to 3% on an annualized basis. If you look at other metrics that measure economic activity, nothing's really falling off a cliff.
00:03:04.005 - 00:04:00.455, Speaker B: And so Powell was definitely kind of cognizant of the fact that stuff's still fine. Basically the path to a soft landing is still there. And so I do think that the market was caught a little bit by surprise in the sense that you did see fixed income sell off, particularly stuff a little bit further out the curve. And that's just Largely a function of like cutting 50 basis points now doesn't mean that they're going to go by 50bps increments on a go forward. In fact, in the dot plot it suggests that they're going to go another 25 and then another 25 meetings. 25 bips in the last meeting of the year to get to cumulatively 100 basis points cut by the December meeting. And so I think that's probably the appropriate stance of monetary policy.
00:04:00.455 - 00:04:30.275, Speaker B: The market reaction though was very volatile. You had stocks rip higher S and p up a percent and then it's finishing the day down like 35 basis points at the moment. Gold hit fresh all time highs. Then it's going to finish down on the day. Bitcoin, 61k and change. And now you're kind of hovering right around 60k is kind of what it seems like. And so the price reaction was volatile, but again it was expected to be volatile.
00:04:30.275 - 00:04:32.495, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll pause there.
00:04:32.535 - 00:05:12.521, Speaker A: Yeah, we're finally in a new regime from a rate standpoint, which I think is the most interesting part. You've been among the most clear thinkers that I've heard over the last year explaining that rate cuts does not automatically mean bullishness for risk assets, that if rate cuts are necessary, it means possibly weakness in the broader economy, which is bearish. Right. I mean, it's bad if the economy's not doing well. Do you think that it was justified of 50bps? Does it not? See, you know, you said it was. But is the fear about a recession warranting such a, you know, a 50bps cut, not a steady 25?
00:05:12.593 - 00:06:26.663, Speaker B: Well, so I mean, the way I would think about it is, you know, he did the 50bp cut, but he also guided, you know, via, or they guided via the dot plot that they're going to go in smaller increments. And so, you know, and he signaled a willingness to basically adjust policy based on the data and you know, if they need to move less frequently or by smaller magnitude, he signaled that he was willing to do that. And so I do think that this struck the right kind of balanced tone where this wasn't like a panic 50 basis point cut. It was more like given the employment data they had since the July meeting, it seemed like they should have probably started cutting in the July meeting, you know, 25bps and then another 25bps for the September meeting. And so it kind of seemed like they were just catching up to kind of where, where the data was not necessarily kind of being like on a Go forward basis stuff's going to be so bad that we got to cut 50. And so that's kind of how it was framed. And it kind of made me less concerned that the Fed was going to incite that type of panic reaction by cutting 50 because of the set of circumstances around it.
00:06:26.663 - 00:07:22.427, Speaker B: But high level, you're right in the sense that I do think that if we are going down a recessionary path or a hard landing path, if that's more likely than a soft landing path, I think equities are very mispriced. You know, to give you guys some context, I think earnings growth for the Magnificent Seven in 2025 is expected to be like 14%. And for the rest of the 493 stocks in the S&P 500 is expected to be around 9%. And so that's a lot of growth to have in an economy that might be slowing down a lot. And so I just think that there's a little bit of a disconnect between, you know, the Fed cutting rates because stuff softening and kind of where forward earnings growth is expected to be. And so that's what I'm cognizant of right now. Particularly because you had the S and P at an all time high yesterday.
00:07:22.427 - 00:08:08.967, Speaker B: Right, right. And so your risk reward for holding these risk assets isn't, you know, it didn't seem that attractive. But I will caveat that with saying that generally when you ease monetary policy and you ease financial conditions, that's broadly supportive of risk from the simple standpoint that cash ultimately has lesser value. But right now the cash rates are still juicy, it's still very compelling. But it can't be said enough that if the Fed did cut by 400 basis points, that would probably be very risky, all else equal.
00:08:09.031 - 00:08:24.515, Speaker A: All right, lastly on this topic and in general, what about the balance sheet, the Fed balance sheet, I mean, they're cutting the overnight rate here, the minimum rate, the Fed funds rate. But is there any hint of any further Fed action on their balance sheet side?
00:08:25.515 - 00:09:42.867, Speaker B: Nothing concrete. Basically, they stuck with the policy stance that continued balance sheet normalization while lowering interest rates is kind of consistent policy because they're on one end, they're just kind of managing the balance sheet of the Fed to kind of get to more normal. I mean, it kind of like this backing up like the Fed balance sheet is so big that if they do like even go back to $100 billion a month in runoff, it's still not doing a whole lot from the standpoint that there's still a ton of net dollars outside of not net, but there's a lot of dollars that offset that balance sheet runoff. The Fed pays out 5% and change on all of the excess reserves in the banking system. That's a ton of money that's flowing back into the economy and things like that. And so just because they're reducing, they've gotten the pace of runoff to a reasonable level and they're continuing, it doesn't mean that it's really doing that much impact. And so it's at a place where I think the impact is relatively benign.
00:09:42.867 - 00:10:07.043, Speaker B: But from a policy consistency standpoint, you know, there are a lot of market participants that are like, you're cutting rates, but you're still running off the balance sheet. That seems inconsistent. And what the Fed is trying to do is trying to communicate the fact that it is consistent policy because you're just normalizing things to healthy levels, both in interest rates and in balance sheet policy.
00:10:07.139 - 00:10:10.515, Speaker A: All right, my friend, Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Trading, as always, thank you so much.
