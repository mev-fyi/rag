00:00:06.040 - 00:00:12.158, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from galaxy Research.
00:00:12.246 - 00:00:12.934, Speaker B: You're the truth.
00:00:12.974 - 00:00:57.350, Speaker A: Echoes off the walls like reverb? Every scoop that goes pop rocks a space like comets? Check how my phonics capture rings like sonic double duty when I drop it? Flow with beauty when I rip it, never snooty when I wrap it, counting bunches when I pick it, pull no punches when I spit it cause I'm different when I hit it, bring your money when you bid it cause I come and just lift it. I got crazy bread, call it biscuit, you flakes can never rise, don't you even try to risk it? Haters, close your eyes cause my flow is something mystic, you, pretzels are too salty, by the way. You get it twisted, this is just another rebel missive. I'm addicted, give me things that I can fix, kid if I ever leave all my haters, they would miss me. By the way, our guest is Adam Zarazinski. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmware research at galaxy digital. Thank you for listening to galaxy brains.
00:00:57.350 - 00:01:31.034, Speaker A: We have a great show for you today. As I said, CEO of Inca Digital, Adam Zarazzinski is our guest, a blockchain and digital asset data analytics firm. We'll talk with Adam about the dark web, foreign scams, national security implications of crypto. It's a fascinating conversation, and we'll check in with our good friend Bibnet Abibi from Galaxy trading, as always, to talk markets.

00:01:31.034 - 00:01:36.336, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, bimnet, great to have you.
00:01:36.400 - 00:01:37.376, Speaker C: Thanks for having me on.
00:01:37.440 - 00:01:38.888, Speaker A: Hey, big day. Fed day.
00:01:38.976 - 00:01:39.552, Speaker C: Fed day.
00:01:39.608 - 00:01:42.336, Speaker A: Fed day. Was it a Super bowl?
00:01:42.480 - 00:02:19.764, Speaker C: No, it was like a wild card playoff round at best. At best. I mean, this was like the most lackluster, uninspiring FOMC I've seen in a while. And I think it just goes to show you, we're near the end and that there's going to be a lot less volatility. That's going to be a function of Fed policy. And I think the future drivers of markets or the next sort of big things for markets are going to be less oriented around Fed policy. So, yeah, I mean, it was an exciting day.
00:02:19.764 - 00:02:32.000, Speaker C: Powell basically said that, you know, they hiked rates right now because the data suggested that they should and that going forward they're gonna be data dependent as they always have been.
00:02:32.112 - 00:02:32.704, Speaker A: Same story.
00:02:32.784 - 00:02:36.184, Speaker C: Same story as last time. There's very minimal changes in the statement.
00:02:36.264 - 00:02:36.872, Speaker A: Yeah, it was very minimal.
00:02:36.888 - 00:02:49.226, Speaker C: We did acknowledge the constructive elements of the last CPI print and that if they were to see follow on that, that would be a welcome site, which we all know.
00:02:49.320 - 00:02:49.726, Speaker B: Yes, correct.
00:02:49.750 - 00:02:50.814, Speaker A: So it's like he's just saying, he's.
00:02:50.854 - 00:03:08.874, Speaker C: Just reiterating stuff and then he still thinks that the balance of risk is skewed towards not doing enough to combat inflation rather than going too hard on landing. Too hard and hard landing because that stuff's reversible.
00:03:09.374 - 00:03:24.654, Speaker A: And we've been talking about this now for months, maybe even a year. Yeah, the hard landing, we're just not seeing it yet. Like it could still come. But it's. Oh, it's definitely, unemployment's still low, the housing market's still high, wages are still going up. Yeah.
00:03:24.694 - 00:04:04.010, Speaker C: I mean, we've forecasted away the recession that we had forecast. Right. And so there's definitely been stronger elements of growth. But what's important about this stuff is that this growth hasn't come at the expense of high inflation or it's come at the expense of inflation as inflation has been coming down. One interesting statistic that I just got from Jeffrey Gundlach, famous bond investor at double hind Capital, is that if you replace the owner's equivalent rent component of headline CPI with more live accurate housing metrics, you'd be talking about headline inflation, headline that was at zero or close to it.
00:04:04.122 - 00:04:04.682, Speaker A: Wow.
00:04:04.818 - 00:05:12.454, Speaker C: And so there are ways like there are certain elements of the inflation story that tell you, oh, the Fed should be done right now, that monetary policy works on a lag and it's clearly working and we're getting even more restrictive now when we're seeing it working. And so it really depends on what your perspective is. But there are just so many strange structural elements to the current macro landscape that it makes it very difficult to have confidence in. Your assessment, is housing tight because everybody has a mortgage and supply tight? Are rents going to come down? Are there structural things in the supply chain that have fundamentally altered where inflation can get to and where it can't, et cetera? There are all these new strange things, post COVID dynamics that market participants and central bankers have to take into account. So it's really tough to say with any confidence this is what you should do. In addition, I think it's worth noting that you've only just had once off inflation number. There are elements of weakness, but you still have the tightest labor market in history.
00:05:12.454 - 00:05:18.058, Speaker C: Prices are still going up. They're going up at a relatively slower.
00:05:18.146 - 00:05:20.376, Speaker A: Rate, but still higher than you'd like.
00:05:20.440 - 00:05:20.776, Speaker C: Correct?
00:05:20.840 - 00:05:21.112, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:21.168 - 00:05:30.896, Speaker C: And then the other thing that's really important to note that I didn't think Powell did a great job of addressing was the easing and monetary conditions. By that, I mean, stocks are at the dead Heights.
00:05:30.960 - 00:05:31.272, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:31.328 - 00:05:33.400, Speaker C: Nasdaq's up 38% on the year.
00:05:33.512 - 00:05:38.048, Speaker A: That's crazy, right? I think you said that to me last week or the week before. That was at the time it was up like 40%.
00:05:38.176 - 00:05:39.800, Speaker C: And I'm like, yeah, it moved down.
00:05:39.912 - 00:05:43.104, Speaker A: It's like, what, one of the best stock years ever on NaSDaQ.
00:05:43.184 - 00:05:44.456, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely.
00:05:44.520 - 00:05:47.264, Speaker A: Meanwhile, everyone's been out. It's been a wall of worry the entire time.
00:05:47.304 - 00:05:51.632, Speaker C: Wall of worry, yeah. And the paying trade was higher. Cause everybody was worried.
00:05:51.688 - 00:05:52.224, Speaker A: It's crazy.
00:05:52.264 - 00:06:02.884, Speaker C: And now it's like, wait, if stocks rip another 10%, I mean, everybody's gonna feel rich again. And what does that do to inflation?
00:06:03.464 - 00:06:05.952, Speaker A: It should push it up. Yeah, people spend more. I mean, yeah.
00:06:06.008 - 00:06:08.048, Speaker C: Spend more, feel richer, take more debt out.
00:06:08.096 - 00:06:19.676, Speaker A: Think that they can remember what people were doing at the 21 Manias. They were mortgaging. They were mortgaging their homes, or they were borrowing. They're buying like dogecoin, using their stock portfolio as collateral.
00:06:19.860 - 00:06:22.916, Speaker C: Three quarters interest rates. I borrow as much money as possible.
00:06:23.060 - 00:06:30.860, Speaker A: That's what people were doing. I saw Crate, there's this Terrible Reddit Subreddit where there'll be people that have, they ask for financial advice, and sometimes you see screenshots. They're really bad.
00:06:30.892 - 00:06:31.564, Speaker C: They're really bad.
00:06:31.644 - 00:06:53.956, Speaker A: And the guy's like, I put up my Stock portfolio at the highs to use it as Collateral to borrow money to purchase a home. And now the stocks are all down a lot. Can I get out of it or anything? You're in trouble. Back to your point, that attitude could return, and that would cause a lot more inflation, too. I mean, that's an extreme example. But, like, in general, I mean, meme.
00:06:53.980 - 00:07:00.188, Speaker C: Stocks are the best performing stocks this year. The G's custom basket that I look at, I think is up 100%.
00:07:00.316 - 00:07:03.140, Speaker A: G's has a meme stock basket. Oh, absolutely. Love that.
00:07:03.212 - 00:07:04.184, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:07:04.484 - 00:07:05.292, Speaker A: Wow.
00:07:05.468 - 00:08:00.234, Speaker C: But anyway, I think you bring up an important point, which is monetary policy is meant to address the needs of the everyday person. Right. The reason why Powell feels so compelled to hike rates by 550 basis points in such short order is because the average person, their ability to consume has been constantly getting eroded. Now the question is, is that level of erosion getting to acceptable levels? And when you look at headline numbers, they actually look okay. But there's just still perpetuate the risk of re acceleration. Now I think it brings us to just another point which I think is worth noting is that households are actually still okay. If you look at credit card delinquency data, it hasn't shot up that much household savings.
00:08:00.234 - 00:08:34.234, Speaker C: They've come down a lot and are expected to decline. You still see a lot of spending, some of it might be on credit, et cetera. There's still momentum behind a lot of the consumer and the average person. And so I'm still in the camp that you haven't really addressed inflation because those people still have jobs and wages are still going up at four plus percent and asset prices are still going up. And while there are signs that they're weakening things here and there.
00:08:37.374 - 00:08:52.566, Speaker A: They just lower the magnitude that they're increasing each time. But to your point and the frequency, that's the other. What have they been doing now? Every other one. So they raised, what's the last couple been? So this was 25 bps they raised. They raised and then the last one they didn't, they didn't raise and then they raised 25 before that.
00:08:52.630 - 00:08:53.158, Speaker C: Correct.
00:08:53.286 - 00:08:55.342, Speaker A: Did they not raise before that or.
00:08:55.438 - 00:08:57.950, Speaker C: No, they were raised every meal, 50, 25.
00:08:58.102 - 00:08:59.622, Speaker A: None then 25, yeah.
00:08:59.638 - 00:08:59.830, Speaker B: Correct.
00:08:59.862 - 00:09:03.670, Speaker A: And now what do we think? Now they're going to race through the rest of the year? I mean essentially most likely.
00:09:03.782 - 00:09:12.392, Speaker C: So I think the most likely scenario is another hike in November. And there's about, let's say ten basis points priced in and.
00:09:12.408 - 00:09:23.624, Speaker A: Right. They take a break here. Right. They don't do one in August or they don't do one in September. So none in August, September, October, November and then November. September, November, yeah. So you think a pause and then another one in November.
00:09:23.624 - 00:09:24.104, Speaker A: Correct.
00:09:24.184 - 00:09:24.648, Speaker B: Got it.
00:09:24.696 - 00:09:28.344, Speaker A: So another 25 bits on top through the end of the year.
00:09:28.464 - 00:09:32.392, Speaker C: Basically I think the market thinks there's another ten basis points left.
00:09:32.528 - 00:09:32.880, Speaker B: I see.
00:09:32.912 - 00:09:39.282, Speaker A: So they think less than half, they think less than a 25. BiP's likelihood, quote unquote. You think the full 25 is a.
00:09:39.298 - 00:09:42.010, Speaker C: 40% probability of a hike.
00:09:42.082 - 00:09:42.734, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:09:43.314 - 00:09:51.986, Speaker C: But then what's really interesting, what's really interesting is also just the pricing around cuts. Right. And you know, when the, so basically.
00:09:52.090 - 00:09:56.594, Speaker A: I saw this on the panel. Right. Like they people. The market is pricing cuts, like, next year.
00:09:56.714 - 00:09:57.826, Speaker C: Next year, absolutely.
00:09:57.970 - 00:10:03.328, Speaker A: And it's like we're going to see that. We're not going to see cuts unless there's, like, economics. Massive economic issue.
00:10:03.376 - 00:10:03.560, Speaker B: Right.
00:10:03.592 - 00:10:07.760, Speaker A: Like, if the recession appears, there's no reason to cut. Right?
00:10:07.872 - 00:10:08.680, Speaker C: That's what I think.
00:10:08.752 - 00:10:08.936, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:08.960 - 00:10:09.672, Speaker A: That's my strategy.
00:10:09.688 - 00:10:32.618, Speaker C: There has to be a structural, like, premium or structural discount, however you wanna think about it, because the risk is that when they do cut, they cut like 100. You don't know the magnitude of the cut. Right. Cause, you know, like, if we are in a recession, it's a hard landing and there's some shit happening. They could go 200 basis points in a day. That takes you back to neutral.
00:10:32.706 - 00:10:35.170, Speaker A: That's why they brought it all the way up here. So they have all that flexibility now.
00:10:35.202 - 00:10:40.374, Speaker C: Yeah, correct. And so it makes it really tricky, I see, to think about.
00:10:41.634 - 00:10:42.034, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:42.074 - 00:11:01.722, Speaker C: And so you could look at the curve and be like, wait, terminal rates, around 3350, whatever that band is, might be too high. Because if we are going to hit that hard landing and all that, we're going to be cutting rates. The corn is going higher.
00:11:01.778 - 00:11:02.562, Speaker B: Let's go.
00:11:02.738 - 00:11:03.586, Speaker A: 29.4.
00:11:03.690 - 00:11:04.418, Speaker B: Yeah. 450.
00:11:04.466 - 00:11:09.210, Speaker A: Let's talk about the corn real quick before we break. I mean, you know. Cause we had a pretty big. I mean, we.
00:11:09.242 - 00:11:10.874, Speaker C: Oh, it's time for the corn to go now.
00:11:10.994 - 00:11:11.202, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:11.218 - 00:11:33.288, Speaker A: And we pulled to the top of the range, like, or a yearly high briefly. After what? After BlackRock's announcement about the ETF, like about over the last month, and then we really just in that tight 30 to 31 range for, like, weeks. Then we had a little bit of a dump over the weekend, last weekend and got down to what, 29 two ish. 29. 29 the figure or even 28 something, actually, briefly.
00:11:33.336 - 00:11:35.884, Speaker C: Yeah, basically 29,000 even so.
00:11:37.384 - 00:11:42.504, Speaker A: But still, we're super low volume. I mean, it's been in this thing for a while. What do we think?
00:11:42.544 - 00:12:37.444, Speaker C: What brings us out of this, fundamentally? If the market is perceiving the Fed as ending their hiking cycle, or this is kind of it, and EU just had some really weak data. Looks like BOJ is not going to go on yield curve control. This meeting, PBOC is easing, et cetera. And I'm looking at price action in things like silver and gold, and those things are trading really well. And just broader risk assets, stocks being close to the dead highs of the year. If you think about crypto as a function of risk assets and debasement hedges, both of those components would suggest that bitcoin should doing well here. The other thing to think about are just more technical things like what is positioning and funding and derivatives positioning look like in bitcoin.
00:12:37.444 - 00:13:12.574, Speaker C: And I think positioning is a lot cleaner than where it was a couple of weeks ago in terms of levered longs at the highs. I do think that there's been a healthy sort of washout of weaker hands, let's put it that way, and that the path is set for a move higher. Make no mistake. I think if you do believe that an ETF is coming, this asset is not priced for the kind of liquidity that is coming in. It is dramatically mispriced. And if you're telling me that the macro currents are going to be supportive of it, in addition to the fact that you're going to get a large.
00:13:12.614 - 00:13:14.166, Speaker B: ETF by, and don't forget you have.
00:13:14.190 - 00:13:16.110, Speaker A: The halving is going to happen about.
00:13:16.302 - 00:13:17.782, Speaker B: Nine months from now, correct?
00:13:17.958 - 00:13:18.834, Speaker A: Ten months.
00:13:19.134 - 00:13:21.066, Speaker C: I think dips are there to be bought.
00:13:21.230 - 00:13:21.722, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:21.818 - 00:13:24.578, Speaker C: And upside's there to be owned. That's that easy.
00:13:24.666 - 00:13:35.202, Speaker A: Love it. Hey, this is a great one. Absolutely. I love the. It does feel like easier to do Super bowl fed day now. It's not that. Everything.
00:13:35.258 - 00:13:36.362, Speaker C: It's not just pain.
00:13:36.538 - 00:13:38.494, Speaker B: I know, right? We know where we're at.
00:13:40.594 - 00:13:44.250, Speaker A: Bim Netabee, our friend from Galaxy trading. As always, my friend, thank you so much.
00:13:44.362 - 00:13:45.094, Speaker C: Pleasure.
00:13:46.114 - 00:13:52.954, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, Adam Zerazinski, CEO of Inca Digital, a digital asset data analytics company. Adam, thank you so much for coming on. Galaxy Brain.
00:13:53.034 - 00:13:54.162, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you for having me.
00:13:54.218 - 00:14:02.914, Speaker A: It's been. I would say it's been a long time in the making, although we've only had this podcast for about a year, actually. I think this will be our 70 or 71st episode, so a little bit more than a year.
00:14:03.034 - 00:14:03.650, Speaker B: Congrats.
00:14:03.762 - 00:14:13.626, Speaker A: But, yeah, but we've known each other for a decent amount of time, and I really want. I think our audience will be interested to understand what Inca digital does. What is a data blockchain data analytics company? What do you guys do?
00:14:13.690 - 00:14:41.628, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. So we're a little different than the blockchain data analytics companies that are typical in the space. The forensics companies like chainalysis, TRM, ciphertrace, elliptic, all those companies. Yeah. So if I can just kind of generally break down the data that we pull in and then productize first is crypto market data. So we're plugged into about 350 centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges globally. That's category one.
00:14:41.628 - 00:14:50.780, Speaker B: The forensics companies do not collect that data. Right. They do not have market data. There are other great companies in the space that do. Your friend, of course, Nick Carter at coinmetrics.
00:14:50.812 - 00:14:53.340, Speaker A: They've got that data metrics and Keiko camera data.
00:14:53.412 - 00:14:55.052, Speaker B: Exactly. All those companies. Yeah.
00:14:55.228 - 00:14:57.104, Speaker A: Which is also like data analytics.
00:14:57.524 - 00:15:20.434, Speaker B: It's just a different focus. So that data, we run our own nodes. We collect blockchain data, too. The second category of data is what we call technical and blockchain data. So it includes us running our own nodes and collecting that data, but also GitHub repos data from the dark web, stuff like that. That's category two, then category three. I know you want to get on dark web.
00:15:20.434 - 00:15:58.462, Speaker B: Yeah. Category three is natural language data. So data from news and social media. We collect data across the open web, and then we've got five custom social media connectors now, which I can dive into. So we pull all the data into our system, and then we build tools on top of it. Those can be simple market data tools like an API of open high pricing, open high low close volume, VWAP, every executed trade across x number of exchanges, and then risk management tools that incorporate social media, that incorporate blockchain data, that incorporate market data, all kind of mashed together and then shoved into an API, depending on the use case. Got it.
00:15:58.462 - 00:15:59.518, Speaker B: So that's what we do. Yeah.
00:15:59.606 - 00:16:15.126, Speaker A: So, and then what types of, do you have service. The same types of customer groups as like a chain analysis. I mean, let's baseline here. Right. A chain analysis. One of the core things they do. And I'm not speaking on behalf of the team at chainalysis, but, you know, complying with, say, the bank Secrecy act.
00:16:15.126 - 00:16:34.330, Speaker A: If you're a crypto financial company, right. You may have to file suspicious activity reports. You certainly also have to comply with sanctions. Right. So you'll screen your transactions as they come in and out. If you're an exchange, for example, see if any of the transactors, the receiving or sending addresses, appear on, like, the SDN list, for example.
00:16:34.362 - 00:16:34.874, Speaker B: Right, exactly.
00:16:34.914 - 00:16:47.514, Speaker A: That's a service that they provide. And also they'll do risk scoring on like, well, did this thing hit a gambling site or a tumblr or whatever? So that's a pretty clear set of clients. What does your sort of customer base look like?
00:16:47.554 - 00:17:46.379, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a similar customer base. So I break it down kind of. We're b two b only. So we focus on traditional financial institutions that are moving into crypto, large crypto service providers, the large centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges, folks like yourselves that are kind of crypto native, but need b, two, b, data analytics and services and then government agencies. So we work within those three industries, but our focus is not blockchain data. Sanctions is actually a really good example, or if you broaden it out a little bit beyond sanctions to just scams and frauds and people that are sanctioned and businesses that are sanctioned. So our focus is more not on the wallet side, but on person names, company names, types of scams, amounts, lost locations, things like that.
00:17:46.379 - 00:18:02.556, Speaker B: So if you think of. If you think of those forensics companies as like a bottom up approach to data analytics in this space. Right. Focusing on blockchains, we're a top down. We're focusing on people, companies and things like that, and then connecting that back to what's happening in crypto.
00:18:02.620 - 00:18:10.828, Speaker A: Interesting. It feels like a more investigative approach, the thesis driven investigative approach to it. Right. Figure out these types of scams, then connect it all together.
00:18:10.956 - 00:18:11.784, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:18:13.204 - 00:18:41.746, Speaker A: I want to talk about some of the types of scams because there was a really interesting story that I think you were quoted in. I know you guys, and you did some work on according to the story, too, but also, we've chatted about this before. I'm going to tease the audience by not talking about that just yet. I want to go back to the dark web thing. What types of data are you finding these days? Give me an update on it. It's been a while since I was a dark web researcher myself, which I have been at various times in my past, but I'm not up to what's happening on the dark web.
00:18:41.770 - 00:18:42.002, Speaker B: Still.
00:18:42.058 - 00:18:46.124, Speaker A: Do we still have alphabays and illicit marketplaces? What else is happening out there?
00:18:46.194 - 00:19:04.604, Speaker B: Yeah. Yes, still illicit marketplaces, of course. And generally speaking, what we're looking for is money laundering, the purchase of precursor materials for weapons of mass destruction.
00:19:05.544 - 00:19:06.880, Speaker A: Seems like a good thing to prevent.
00:19:06.992 - 00:19:32.290, Speaker B: All of those things. And the intersection of those things in crypto, I can tell you a couple interesting stories just on how things that you might not expect are interconnected are and why it's important to focus on kind of like these disparate datasets and bring them together. And I know I'm being a little vague so we can talk about it in more detail, but. Yes. Yeah.
00:19:32.322 - 00:19:38.626, Speaker A: Can you give an example, maybe, of a dark web investigation or, you know, with however much specificity you can?
00:19:38.730 - 00:19:42.502, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can give you two. We can talk about pig butchering first, if you want.
00:19:42.518 - 00:19:48.390, Speaker A: Well, that was the one that I was referencing before there was. Let's talk about pig butchering. It's such a lovely term.
00:19:48.502 - 00:19:49.014, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:19:49.134 - 00:19:49.686, Speaker A: First of all.
00:19:49.750 - 00:19:49.926, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:19:49.950 - 00:19:50.934, Speaker A: What is pig butchering?
00:19:51.054 - 00:20:20.314, Speaker B: Okay, so pig butchering is the term that the scammers use, not us. Right. Nor law enforcement. It's called choosupon or something. I'm probably butchering the name, but that's the term that they use. And so I can basically walk you through. Let me walk you through from first, a product perspective, all the way through what we identified and what the news, what media outlets are saying, and then what's actually happening.
00:20:20.314 - 00:20:36.222, Speaker B: Okay. So from product perspective, first focusing on that. So we have a tool that's called scam and fraud API. It is. If you know Finra's broker, check. It's like that for fraud on steroids, for crypto. Okay.
00:20:36.222 - 00:21:06.000, Speaker B: Yeah. So what we do is we collect a lot of data across the open web and social media. I'm gonna use Twitter as an example. But let's imagine that you, Alex, tweet out something like, this guy, Adam Zarazinski, enticed me to invest $100,000 worth of bitcoin into his company called Inca Digital. I think it's a scam company. I sent it three months ago, and he convinced me a ten x return in a week. And it's been three months.
00:21:06.000 - 00:21:32.464, Speaker B: I think he ran away with my money. I sent it all to the wallet address, ABC 123. So that's your tweet. What we essentially do is you can imagine us breaking down that tweet in an API. The name of the victim, the name of the scammer, the name of the shell company. If we can geotag any of that, the location of the person or the company, any other outside data that we have, like, registry information for that company, the amount lost, the wallet address, et cetera. So that's the tool.
00:21:32.464 - 00:22:16.706, Speaker B: We sell that tool, but then we also use that tool ourselves. We got an entire intelligence investigations team that looks at our data, kind of eats our own dog food, and then spits out reports and stuff like that that I know you want to get into. And we saw a trend of people essentially complaining that they were getting scammed on dating websites, places like Tinder, and started looking into it. And this was a long time ago. This was like two and a half years ago. What we found is that there's a scam taking place in the billions of dollars. It's a giant transfer of wealth from the US and Europe back to China for what is known as pig butchering.
00:22:16.706 - 00:22:27.986, Speaker B: And it's essentially a scam where people are kind of create relationships with these scammers online, and they're ultimately convinced to invest money in a fake company.
00:22:28.090 - 00:22:31.634, Speaker A: So is it like, what do they call it? Like, catfishing? Kind of.
00:22:31.714 - 00:22:42.734, Speaker B: Yeah, it's kind of like catfishing. Yeah, yeah. It's getting fairly sophisticated. Sometimes they even have fake websites where you can see your account information and how much money you've made, but then ultimately all the money disappears.
00:22:42.774 - 00:22:48.278, Speaker A: But it starts on a dating site. So you've got a man or a woman in the west.
00:22:48.366 - 00:23:04.572, Speaker B: Typically, yeah. Let me give you a real example. So we had a victim that was quoted in the news. A public school teacher, recently divorced, out of Troy, Michigan, two kids, owns. Has a mortgage out on her home. She meets this guy. Excuse me.
00:23:04.572 - 00:23:18.524, Speaker B: Meets this guy online. They start online dating. She's never met him in person. She's convinced to invest something small, $2,000. She does. She triples her money on whatever website they show her. Exactly.
00:23:18.524 - 00:23:39.938, Speaker B: Exactly. Sorry. Then she's convinced to invest more. Then she takes out a second mortgage on her home, invests all of her savings, everything that she's got. She's like 250 deep. Then, obviously, all the money disappears, and she has no recourse whatsoever. It goes to the FBI.
00:23:39.938 - 00:23:51.162, Speaker B: But the scale. The size and scale of the scam is such that there's not even much that the FBI can do. Maybe they can freeze funds. So that's just one example.
00:23:51.218 - 00:23:53.138, Speaker A: How many of these examples are there?
00:23:53.306 - 00:23:59.284, Speaker B: Tens of thousands. Tens of thousands of examples. And we estimate over $5 billion has been lost.
00:23:59.324 - 00:23:59.948, Speaker A: Oh, my God.
00:23:59.996 - 00:24:01.108, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. A lot of money.
00:24:01.156 - 00:24:09.908, Speaker A: And then what are the mechanics? Okay, so we have a relationship, and at some point, I casually. If I'm the pig butcher. So I'm understanding now. You're luring in this pig. You're fattening them up.
00:24:09.956 - 00:24:18.460, Speaker B: That's exactly. Yeah. So we even have their. We have their, you know, so going to, like, the natural language data side of the data that we collect. We even have their. Their training manual.
00:24:18.532 - 00:24:19.020, Speaker A: Oh, God.
00:24:19.092 - 00:24:19.564, Speaker B: And so, like.
00:24:19.604 - 00:24:22.916, Speaker A: And you, like, found this on their own, like, bulletin board type stuff?
00:24:23.060 - 00:24:26.612, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah. And I can. I can share it with whoever's interested watching the show.
00:24:26.668 - 00:24:27.356, Speaker A: That's interesting.
00:24:27.460 - 00:24:40.116, Speaker B: But, like, there's even. There's even annexes. Like, so there's, like, you know how you approach this type of person? There's, like, annex, like, c for, like, homosexuals, elderly, thirsty men, and then an.
00:24:40.140 - 00:24:41.252, Speaker A: Entire way of approaching them.
00:24:41.268 - 00:24:44.428, Speaker B: An entire way of approaching them. Yeah. All the ttps. Oh, my gosh.
00:24:44.516 - 00:24:46.212, Speaker A: There's a deep, deep script.
00:24:46.348 - 00:24:47.028, Speaker B: A deep script.
00:24:47.076 - 00:25:00.604, Speaker A: It's like a. Okay, so then, so you build a relationship then. And then at some point, I introduce. And what are they typically offering as the investment? What are they saying it is? Is it like in a crypto or is it in real estate? Like, what is it they're suggesting? It's like an.
00:25:00.644 - 00:25:02.876, Speaker B: Like a fake hedge fund or fake fund.
00:25:02.900 - 00:25:03.956, Speaker A: So it's like an investment vehicle.
00:25:03.980 - 00:25:05.196, Speaker B: Investment vehicle, exactly.
00:25:05.260 - 00:25:09.324, Speaker A: And then are they. What are they, what are they telling the victim to send them?
00:25:09.444 - 00:25:34.922, Speaker B: So they'll typically walk them through setting up an account on a centralized exchange. Right. So most of these people are either completely new to crypto or maybe own crypto, but are not moving kind of beyond, like, you know, buying bitcoin on coinbase or something like that. So they will set up an account or already have an account on their local, centralized exchange somewhere. And then they say, okay, now send that money to this wallet address. This is like our hedge fund.
00:25:34.978 - 00:25:37.178, Speaker A: Is it typically bitcoin or.
00:25:37.346 - 00:26:02.408, Speaker B: It starts out as bitcoin. It'll start out as bitcoin or ethereum. We can catch, based on transaction patterns, we can actually catch it that early. So we can catch it as early as. Not the first transaction, but we can catch it before these victims get too deep. But it's typically bitcoin to start. They'll send the bitcoin to a wallet address, and then from there, they chain hop.
00:26:02.408 - 00:26:05.512, Speaker B: They exchange hop. And I can walk through those terms if you. I'm not sure.
00:26:05.568 - 00:26:07.664, Speaker A: No, I think we get aware enough.
00:26:07.704 - 00:26:08.296, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:26:08.320 - 00:26:14.224, Speaker A: Well, if chain hopping is just, you know, swapping from one chain to another, either over a bridge or however you want.
00:26:14.264 - 00:26:16.520, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. But they're typically going to difficult.
00:26:16.592 - 00:26:23.112, Speaker A: Obfuscates the chain of custody over time. Makes it a little harder, they think, for analytics firms like you to follow.
00:26:23.248 - 00:26:46.352, Speaker B: Well, yeah, that's right. Well, it's actually harder for the forensics companies to follow. They'll move to tether and places like that where it's like, it's harder to automatically follow it. We have an. Not that the forensics companies don't have this, but we have an intel team that often does this by hand. Right. So, like, we're by hand going from bitcoin to ethereum to tron to tether and tracing.
00:26:46.408 - 00:26:50.928, Speaker A: Like, we can see the inflow at the same time that it exited the other one. Assume that it's the.
00:26:51.016 - 00:27:12.580, Speaker B: Yeah, and then we have. And then we have, like, you know, the company names on top of it, and then we'll often even work with exchanges to get. Okay, like, what is, like, here's the company names that we have, the people names that we have, and then it's like some random preteen in Thailand that just so happens to have $50 million worth of crypto associated to their name. That's where it ends. Yeah.
00:27:12.732 - 00:27:21.028, Speaker A: So $5 billion, and this is just ongoing. It's evil catfishing that results in an investment vehicle scam.
00:27:21.116 - 00:27:55.824, Speaker B: Yes, yes. But the catch is. So a lot of what you'll read in the news is, like, the example I give you, right? Like, farmer loses half a million dollars to scam. Right. Public school teacher in Troy, Michigan. What's not as well reported on is that this isn't like, well, now I think it's morphing into a type of scam, like nigerian print scam, where it's just, like, people doing it randomly, but for the most part still, this is not that. This is a well organized transnational criminal group operating out of China and border countries.
00:27:55.864 - 00:28:00.256, Speaker A: It's not a type of scam is an ongoing, specific, major operation.
00:28:00.360 - 00:28:01.080, Speaker B: Major operation.
00:28:01.112 - 00:28:02.680, Speaker A: It's not just a class of scam at this point.
00:28:02.712 - 00:28:05.368, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's moving into class. Yeah.
00:28:05.376 - 00:28:06.720, Speaker A: Well, other people are probably like, wait a sec.
00:28:06.752 - 00:28:08.296, Speaker B: We should do this. We can make a lot of money. Yeah. Yeah.
00:28:08.320 - 00:28:20.496, Speaker A: So it'll become a whole. Yeah, but this is now. Okay, now I'm gonna. I don't. Is this like a CCP? Is this the Chinese? Is this sanctioned by. I mean, China doesn't like crypto. They're allowing all this crypto to flow into their country, into the hands of criminals.
00:28:20.520 - 00:28:21.760, Speaker B: Is that. We can. We can get into it.
00:28:21.792 - 00:28:23.544, Speaker A: What's the geopolitical situation here?
00:28:23.584 - 00:28:27.128, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. So, like, not that we have anything that's, like, specifically tied to the CCP.
00:28:27.256 - 00:28:35.196, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't literally mean. I just mean, like, is this the Chinese. I always wonder this. I mean, is this China attacking the west to make money, or is this just criminals?
00:28:35.260 - 00:28:40.744, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I mean, like. I mean, like, I think that there are major national security implications for this.
00:28:41.044 - 00:28:44.804, Speaker A: The smarter would ask it, what are the national security and geopolitical implications of this?
00:28:44.884 - 00:29:20.674, Speaker B: There are, like, it exists. Right. I think, like, you know, from a. You know, what the CCP says publicly and what's happening in reality are two different things. I find it hard to believe. While we don't have any direct evidence, I find it hard to believe that the CCP is not aware that there are billions of dollars flowing into their country and right on their borders from what we know is a transnational criminal group operating, and they are chinese that they don't know about that. So that's as far as we've gotten.
00:29:20.674 - 00:29:34.746, Speaker B: We know that the money is flowing ultimately into China, but anything that's directly related to CCP. No, you know what I mean? And obviously, a lot of this goes through Hong Kong, too. And we can debate the merits of how China uses Hong Kong as an avenue for.
00:29:34.850 - 00:29:58.344, Speaker A: Yeah, and I was actually just looking, there was just recently the protest in Israel over this contentious election with Netanyahu. And I was thinking back to the Hong Kong protests with all the umbrellas and how that issue China has, I think, since then certainly firmed their grip on Hong Kong over time, which is actually made, by the way, the Hong Kong sort of pivot on digital assets more recently. Quite interesting.
00:29:58.424 - 00:29:59.084, Speaker B: Yes.
00:29:59.544 - 00:30:29.446, Speaker A: But let's talk more about the geopolitical stuff because I know Inca, you talked about, for example, the precursor materials to weapons of mass destruction. Again, since you're, you guys do some forensics, but it's sort of a different service. But you also said you have some government agencies that are clients. We know that I once pulled from whatever it is, the vendor registry, the US government publishes, who they spend money on and they spent.
00:30:29.590 - 00:30:29.870, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:30:29.902 - 00:30:32.854, Speaker A: And they've spent money on the forensics companies for years.
00:30:32.894 - 00:30:33.046, Speaker B: Right.
00:30:33.070 - 00:30:39.950, Speaker A: It makes sense. Ir's does it. Right. FBI, even the border Patrol, I think was paying money on.
00:30:40.142 - 00:30:40.874, Speaker B: So.
00:30:42.734 - 00:31:14.758, Speaker A: What are the geopolitical implications for a nation state? The national security implications, like broadly define that set for me in cryptocurrency. Like what are nation states looking at? What is the US looking at them? I don't know to the extent you can describe to me what. Cause I'm pretty sure the US doesn't care that much. Again, at the federal government level, most of on the national security side merely are exchanges conducting proper kyc. Parts of the government obviously care. Fincen cares. But what are the real national security level implications of cryptocurrencies?
00:31:14.866 - 00:31:27.790, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. So let me answer a slightly big question. No, no, yeah, no, it's okay. Yeah. Let me answer a slightly different question first, and then I'll answer. I'll give you a couple use case examples. Right, cool.
00:31:27.790 - 00:32:09.526, Speaker B: So, like, first from like a high level, what Inca does and cares about is providing data and services to not just government agencies. Right. But to all three of those different industries sectors that we talked about. Right. Providing the same data. And that can be national security related stuff like KYC or what are the North Koreans doing? What are the Chinese doing, where are they laundering money, et cetera. It can also just be things like market data analytics, like how do we get closer to a bitcoin ETF and what data and services can Inca provide for us as a community to get there, right, cross market surveillance, stuff like this.
00:32:09.526 - 00:33:03.198, Speaker B: But then those same cross market surveillance tools can be used, tweaked, and then used for other purposes to identify money laundering, to build models, to identify ttps, to identify particular types of trafficking. So with the outset, that's what we do. I think that there's a couple big, you know, big national security implications and examples of scams and frauds and things like that are only one. There's. There's a lot happening. So, like, we can talk about, you know, and the way that the United States operates and the way that the west operates oftentimes is different than the way, for better or worse. I'm not placing a value judgment on the way that some of our near peers operate.
00:33:03.198 - 00:33:56.934, Speaker B: So I'll give you two examples and kind of the intersection of these things. So we ran an operation with a DOD partner where we were looking at something at the outset looks nonsensical. We were looking at illegal fisheries in South America. Okay. Why does the DoD care about illegal fisheries in South America? Why? And what nexus does that have to crypto? So what's happening is there are basically multitudes of chinese fishing vessels off the major port cities in South America, and they're fishing for nearly extinct animals there. And then they catch them, and then they make whatever food they make from them and then sell them to folks in these port cities. Right.
00:33:56.934 - 00:34:14.472, Speaker B: Why was Inca involved in this? And what is the nexus to crypto? Well, it just so happens that those same fishing vessels that are used to catch, like, nearly extinct seahorses or whatever also are used to traffic people.
00:34:14.568 - 00:34:15.056, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
00:34:15.120 - 00:34:30.715, Speaker B: And also are used to traffic precursor drugs for, like, vent and stuff. Yeah, yeah. That are ultimately routed up into the United States. Right. And it's all done in crypto, and increasingly it's done with the digital you want. So you can go.
00:34:30.779 - 00:34:31.123, Speaker A: Really?
00:34:31.203 - 00:34:41.899, Speaker B: Yes. So you can go to port cities in, let's say, ecuador and trade and buy things using the digital you want right now. It's happening right now.
00:34:42.011 - 00:34:42.755, Speaker A: Wow.
00:34:42.939 - 00:34:43.587, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:43.715 - 00:34:48.611, Speaker A: Are people buying anything in those, like, did you see, like, legitimate uses of the digital yuan then?
00:34:48.707 - 00:34:49.971, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes.
00:34:50.067 - 00:34:51.699, Speaker A: But these guys are also using it.
00:34:51.731 - 00:34:52.171, Speaker B: Also using it.
00:34:52.187 - 00:34:54.731, Speaker A: So that's how it's flowing in. The digital yuan is primarily flowing into.
00:34:54.787 - 00:35:11.210, Speaker B: This trade, and it's still largely like chinese communities in those port cities. Right. But it's flowing over into the local population, too. Now, that's one example of rare seahorses, Adam.
00:35:11.242 - 00:35:14.534, Speaker A: I'm going to have nightmares about this. Poor seahorses.
00:35:16.714 - 00:35:24.650, Speaker B: Destroying the environment. No. So that's interesting. Yeah. So that's one example. Right. From a national.
00:35:24.650 - 00:35:52.198, Speaker B: Here's my opinion on national security writ large, and my interest in particular is Russia and China, and then those two vis a vis North Korea as well. Right. So those three total. So I think if you kind of separate it out into three categories, you have this kind of, like, quasi illegal, but quasi, arguably government backed operations, pig butchering, like illegal fisheries, things like that.
00:35:52.206 - 00:35:53.894, Speaker A: What about, like, Lazarus group? Does that fit in there?
00:35:53.934 - 00:36:17.880, Speaker B: Lazarus group, exactly. So those types of things. And how does Lazarus group move their crypto to fiat? It's through China. Chinese OTC, for the most part. Okay, so that's kind of like category one illegal stuff. Right. Category two is like the digital yuan and CBDCs, and we can talk about how those are used globally and the Chinese setting up bilateral agreements globally.
00:36:17.880 - 00:36:40.308, Speaker B: So we've got that category three. And actually, the one that I'm most worried about is how much liquidity is offshore, how much of that liquidity is in Hong Kong, and chinese control of that liquidity, ultimately, which goes back to what, obviously, what the United States is doing and our.
00:36:40.436 - 00:36:42.044, Speaker A: You mean our regulatory approach to the crypto?
00:36:42.084 - 00:36:52.656, Speaker B: Our regulatory approach to crypto. And again, obviously, ultimately a neutral data provider. Right. So it's not that I have specific policy recommendations, aside from saying that we need to move liquidity back to the United States.
00:36:52.720 - 00:36:56.856, Speaker A: I see. So when you say you're most concerned about. You mean for, like, american competitiveness?
00:36:56.960 - 00:37:23.406, Speaker B: American competitiveness, yeah. The innovation needs to be here. I mean, obviously, all the large liquidity providers, you know this better than me, right. They're moving offshore. They're, you know, they're closing the doors on crypto completely, at least for the time being, that needs to move back onshore, because right now, of the centralized exchanges, only three of the top 15 exchanges by spot and derivatives volume are not chinese founded in Hong Kong.
00:37:23.510 - 00:37:24.194, Speaker A: Wow.
00:37:24.534 - 00:37:26.950, Speaker B: To me, that's a problem. Yeah.
00:37:27.102 - 00:37:29.918, Speaker A: And it also can amplify the first two problems, too.
00:37:29.966 - 00:37:31.174, Speaker B: Exactly. Yes, exactly.
00:37:31.214 - 00:37:37.814, Speaker A: It's not just that we're. Wow, that's. I'm still a little shook by the seahorses.
00:37:37.854 - 00:37:38.638, Speaker B: The rare seahorses.
00:37:38.686 - 00:37:43.364, Speaker A: I didn't know this poor. I thought they were cute. People eat seahorses. All right. I'm sorry.
00:37:43.404 - 00:37:50.148, Speaker B: Well, ultimately, they're going to die anyway from our everything dies jokes.
00:37:50.196 - 00:38:22.880, Speaker A: I was joking. Let's talk about the concept. This has been fascinating. You guys work on some really interesting stuff, and I think there are serious implications for american competitiveness, as I think many people interested in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies do. Let's talk a little bit about blockchain forensic, the ethos. Because I know a lot of people, I know a lot of people personally who really don't like companies like Inca or chainalysis. They think it's somehow anathema to the cypherpunk ethos that underpins bitcoin.
00:38:22.880 - 00:38:32.544, Speaker A: That essentially, and I don't hear that Inc is not even. Chainalysis isn't even often the one that people are really upset about right now. Is this Arkham intelligence?
00:38:32.624 - 00:38:33.404, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah.
00:38:33.784 - 00:39:06.492, Speaker A: That's actually pretty accelerationist what they're doing, trying to do. It's a doxxing marketplace. It's a little different than what you guys do. But, like, how do you think about that? I mean, I know you're a proponent, and we've heard the leadership of chainalysis and elliptic many times in Congress and otherwise. Also, I think, passionately talk about how they believe in the future of cryptocurrencies. How do you think about. How do you square your belief and passion for cryptocurrencies with the intelligence side of it and the criticism that some levy against a company like.
00:39:06.548 - 00:39:23.572, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's, you know, like, maybe this is a little quippy, but I'm not anti crypto. Right. I'm just, like, anti stealing people's money. Right. I'm not anti crypto. I'm just anti centralized exchange, committing massive amounts of fraud and setting crypto back a decade.
00:39:23.572 - 00:40:00.764, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm not anti crypto. I'm just anti North Korea hacking into a barely secured video game and stealing $600 million worth of crypto to fund their nuclear proliferation efforts. Right. I think our work is necessary in order to mature and grow crypto globally. And like I said, we do that. But we're also working on data analytics to help bolster an ETF here in the United States, which I think everybody is for, at least for the most part. So I have a couple other points.
00:40:00.764 - 00:40:48.620, Speaker B: The second is, if you go on our website, you'll see some reports, which I know that you've seen, where we call out specific exchanges, specific actors on things that they do, things that we have seen with every single one of those reports. We always reach out to the subjects of those reports first. And in some cases, it's me literally begging them to take a phone call where I reach out to an exchange and I'm like, hey, we see that you're providing services to sanctioned russian banks. Here's the data. Can we talk now? Obviously, a little bit of this is, I want to sell them services, but honestly, if they just said, okay, we're not going to buy any of your shit, Inca, but I see what happens.
00:40:48.652 - 00:40:51.708, Speaker A: So you're saying, guys, FYI, you need help preventing this?
00:40:51.756 - 00:40:52.132, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:40:52.188 - 00:40:53.920, Speaker A: Sometimes they say, no, we're good.
00:40:54.052 - 00:40:57.024, Speaker B: Oh, no, not sometimes. I mean, it's like, most of it. Most of the time, they don't even respond.
00:40:57.064 - 00:40:58.312, Speaker A: I'm saying they're well aware.
00:40:58.448 - 00:41:05.256, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And they're like, no, we're cool. Right? Then I'm like, okay, well, I guess I'm going public with it then.
00:41:05.280 - 00:41:06.896, Speaker A: Cause I guess you're criminals, basically.
00:41:07.000 - 00:41:48.974, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think there's that. Well, there is that. And then the other thing I would say is, in terms of ethos, I think it's a little, honestly naive to think that all of this, the approach is openness, and it's naive to think that that is not going to be used for intelligence, for ferreting out bad behavior. And I think that the ask should be not that it doesn't happen, but that it's done in a responsible and ethical way and in an open way. We're the ones that are doing it. Right.
00:41:48.974 - 00:42:03.030, Speaker B: We are selling this data to the government. We also sell this data openly, the majority of it, to anybody else that wants to buy it, and we do it openly. I'm sitting here on your podcast talking about it.
00:42:03.142 - 00:42:14.182, Speaker A: You're not a secret spy agency. It's a commercial business using publicly available, mostly publicly available information. It's an analytics. It's open source intelligence analytics.
00:42:14.238 - 00:42:14.614, Speaker B: Yes.
00:42:14.694 - 00:42:15.620, Speaker A: Is it osint?
00:42:15.742 - 00:42:18.680, Speaker B: It is osint. Yeah. Financial Osint.
00:42:18.712 - 00:42:28.592, Speaker A: Financial osint. I like it because I just, as in now I'm just getting geeky. But, like, imminent is one of my favorites. One of the least sounding, but like, image intelligence. I used to spend hours and hours and hours.
00:42:28.608 - 00:42:33.032, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. Like Google Earth, Walmart parking lot in Florida. So I'm not good at this, but.
00:42:33.048 - 00:42:36.928, Speaker A: Yes, you can look at, like, the amount of oil tankers. Right. Hedge funds do this stuff all.
00:42:37.096 - 00:42:37.568, Speaker B: Yes.
00:42:37.656 - 00:43:06.746, Speaker A: The amount of cars parked out on Walmart, like, during Christmas, can give you an idea of, like, what the spending is gonna look like. But what I liked to do, and I actually have somewhere a Google Earth file, which I know could seem a little sketchy to a three letter agency, is just look at military bases everywhere. Not in the US. I spent a whole bunch of time identifying a whole bunch in Iran just for fun, because you can see airstrips. You really can't cover these up. They're airstrips. There was a hilarious one, I'm really going off tangent.
00:43:06.746 - 00:43:23.274, Speaker A: There's a hilarious one in North Korea. I found where they. They try to make it look like in the apron next to an airfield, an airstrip. There's either hangers or. Sometimes there's just these little roads where you just park a plane and they try to make them look like little houses. And I'm like, dude, I can see there's a plane under there.
00:43:23.734 - 00:43:29.718, Speaker B: The wings are sticking out of this house. Exactly. No, but this is a good example.
00:43:29.766 - 00:43:33.062, Speaker A: Those pictures are there. I can see them. It's not my fault for looking at them.
00:43:33.118 - 00:43:45.610, Speaker B: Well, dude, we had one. This is an old one. But when Venezuela built their oil backed coin, what was the name of it?
00:43:45.802 - 00:43:46.442, Speaker A: The petro.
00:43:46.498 - 00:44:25.742, Speaker B: The petro. Yes, the petro. So when they built that and they built some infrastructure around it, everybody rightfully laughed at how bungled the launch was and everything. And we released a report about how it was the Russians that were helping them out. And this got a lot of people in crypto and also in the DoD shook. And how did we find it? There's pictures of Russians with Maduro literally shaking hands on Twitter, talking about the fact that they're doing this. It's right there.
00:44:25.742 - 00:44:29.750, Speaker B: There's images of it, and we can identify all the people. You know what I mean? Yeah.
00:44:29.782 - 00:44:46.748, Speaker A: There's a lot of information out there. And you're right. I think I agree that, look, one. In one way, a public blockchain is a public blockchain, and the information is public. Now, the analysis, it's not right. We talk about, like, pseudonymity, pseudonymity.
00:44:46.796 - 00:44:47.156, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:44:47.220 - 00:44:57.468, Speaker A: Right versus right. My name's not on the bitcoin blockchain unless I put it there. I can put it there. You can inscribe it. For example, my photo is on there. I inscribed it. Inscription ten 888 is my Twitter avatar.
00:44:57.468 - 00:45:10.414, Speaker A: Nearly sub. 10,000 inscriptions. Anyway, point being. But there is a lot of information. There's so much information in other blockchains, like ethereum, there's even more information, and it's. Someone's gonna use it. It's.
00:45:10.414 - 00:45:21.414, Speaker A: You're saying you're trying to use it for good. Right. You're trying to stop crime, stop scams, stop people buying fissile material or fentanyl.
00:45:21.754 - 00:45:29.064, Speaker B: That's right. Among other things. Among also, like I said, providing cross market surveillance. Just, well, that's the other thing also.
00:45:29.144 - 00:45:34.360, Speaker A: Hey, I need intelligence on the market because I'm a trader, an investor, a business, or whatever.
00:45:34.472 - 00:46:03.386, Speaker B: Yeah. And then you can combine those types of data sets together, and that's the key piece. Right. You can look at centralized exchange market data and see, okay, here's every executed trade that's happening. And it looks like we know from our blockchain analytics or we know from what people are talking about on the dark web that this money went here and they're trading this exact amount every hour on the hour for a week straight, and then they go quiet, or whatever it is.
00:46:03.410 - 00:46:16.106, Speaker A: Yeah, we're almost at the end here. Before we wrap, what are you most excited about for Inca or for the crypto markets? What's right on your near term horizon that's getting you hyped about your day to day?
00:46:16.290 - 00:46:44.438, Speaker B: That's a good question. I think, you know, I'll answer from like, a really broad perspective. I think that we're on the precipice of another, like, crypto bull run a lot of market activity. Like, it's going to happen soon, and I think we're just going to see a lot of changes to the ecosystem generally. And I'm just excited to be a part of it, honestly. Me too. Yeah.
