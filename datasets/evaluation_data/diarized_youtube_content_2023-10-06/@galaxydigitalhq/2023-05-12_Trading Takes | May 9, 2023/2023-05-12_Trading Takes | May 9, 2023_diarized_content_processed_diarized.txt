00:00:06.680 - 00:00:10.622, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet, a BB from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnett, great to see you.
00:00:10.678 - 00:00:11.758, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:11.886 - 00:00:16.646, Speaker A: So I guess, so we're recording this on a Tuesday this week, a little bit of travel plan.
00:00:16.750 - 00:00:18.662, Speaker B: You're throwing me completely off.
00:00:18.758 - 00:00:46.820, Speaker A: So it's going to be a little bit before the big number this week, which is CPI. So just for our listeners, we're unaware of the result of that number. But a lot of other stuff to talk about. I'm just looking at the block clock behind me. We're sort of at the bottom of the recent channel or near the bottom of it. We're still up there in that area. We've been, I think if you look at the chart for bitcoin, we've cycled from like 27 to 30 a bunch of times, but we're sort of down what's happening in traditional markets.
00:00:46.820 - 00:00:49.664, Speaker A: That's been interesting since we last talked last week.
00:00:49.964 - 00:01:32.208, Speaker B: So the main focus for the market has still remained kind of the regional banking crisis. So in terms of people's perception of that and the outlook going forward, we got a new piece of data this week. It was the loan officer survey, the April loan officer survey, and it basically showed what we had been expecting, which is a tightening of lending standards, basically a credit crunch crunch, especially within certain sectors. So it confirmed what people had expected, which was the failure of major banks led to systemic issues that's going to lead to tighter credit conditions.
00:01:32.336 - 00:01:40.592, Speaker A: And those tighter credit conditions almost have like a, they have a tightening effect overall. So does that help the fed in their, should they decide to pause hiking?
00:01:40.688 - 00:02:11.904, Speaker B: It should, absolutely. It will certainly put a strain on small businesses. I'll put a strain on employment. I'll help them achieve their sort of inflation mandate. However, you know, I am a bit skeptical of, you know, kind of how of the market's interpretation right now. Basically, the market has multiple cuts priced into this year, particularly into Q one of next year. You've got a lot of cuts priced in more than three.
00:02:11.904 - 00:02:41.500, Speaker B: And I kind of disagree with it, particularly on the back of some of the really robust labor market data that we've gotten. To give you an example, I mean, non farm payrolls, this on Friday came out at 235,000 jobs added. Right. It's a huge ad, but let's ignore the fact that we added those jobs. The average hourly earnings came in at like half a percent month on month. Right. That's a really strong reading.
00:02:41.500 - 00:03:17.384, Speaker B: And the other employment data we've gotten, we had unit labor costs that surprised higher. We had the employment cost index surprised higher. This was all last week. So basically every reading for the labor market that you've gotten says it's still really hot. And then on top of that, even when you get bad pieces of data like the regional fed surveys and the manufacturers get asked about how things are going, they're like, oh, the activity's bad, right? But labor market's still tight. I'm still having issues retaining employees. I still have to pay them really high rates, and they have pricing power.
00:03:17.384 - 00:03:59.846, Speaker B: We're in a world where the unemployment rate is 3.4% and people have pricing power in their jobs, not just their tons of jobs out there and available, but it's like you have negotiating power. And what is the stickiest part of inflation? What is the part that the Fed's most concerned about? It's the services inflation, the stuff ex shelter core services, basically. And that stuff is super sticky. But that's actually a pretty good segue onto what we're expecting to see for this month's figure. And this month's figure is all about core CPI. The median expectation is for 0.36
00:03:59.846 - 00:04:33.366, Speaker B: month on month. But there's a distribution of analysts. There's a heavy distribution towards like zero point four s and even some to 0.5s. There's been a rebound in owner's equivalent rent. And from what we see from the high frequency data, like rental prices are starting to tick back up again. We've also seen used auto prices start to tick back up again. Like, there could be another pretty material inflation upside surprise happening this week.
00:04:33.470 - 00:04:34.214, Speaker A: Oh, man.
00:04:34.334 - 00:05:19.914, Speaker B: And that's not going to be good for risk assets. But at the same time, it's such a weird place because everybody's like, wait, okay, if the Fed's only response to really hot data is raising rates, what does that do? That further exacerbates the banking issues and that lowers your growth in the long run. So curves should be flatter, and you should also be pricing in more cuts in the back half of the year, et cetera. It's a very interesting dynamic. And then you throw in the debt ceiling, which is obviously a very topical issue at the moment. But yeah, it's a very challenging macro environment. Lots of uncertainty, and that means you're going to get lots of volatility.
00:05:19.914 - 00:05:35.394, Speaker B: And I don't think crypto is going to be any different. You've definitely had material volatility over the past couple of weeks. Some of it's headline driven, some of it's liquidation driven, et cetera. But volume crypto is realizing a lot.
00:05:35.434 - 00:05:38.098, Speaker A: We're going to get some volume up top, volume down.
00:05:38.226 - 00:05:51.046, Speaker B: I think you're in that environment. I don't think it's going to be straight line up as it has been this year. And right now, risk reward looks relatively decent. However, you have an inflation number that.
00:05:51.070 - 00:05:53.926, Speaker A: Could literally rock the world, change the entire picture.
00:05:54.030 - 00:06:54.030, Speaker B: At the same time, I think people need to realize that you have to price in the right tail for assets as much as you have to price in the left tail, or there's a distribution, people stop thinking about the right tail as much. We're on the cusp of the Fed ending tightening altogether. The S and P earlier this week was testing new highs and Nasdaq breaking out. If we're in an environment for sure where inflation's headed the right way and we're confident in it, and we know that the central bank pressures are about to ease, that's a major boon for risk assets. I think that part of the distribution of bitcoin is lost on a lot of people, especially in the scenario where you do actually have the debt ceiling stuff come to fruition in a more meaningful way. I look at bitcoin as an asset. It's done really well this year.
00:06:54.030 - 00:07:27.814, Speaker B: But at the same time, if you're telling me we're going to go back to a world where inflation's not an issue because we've collapsed the economy, credit crunch is happening in the back half of this year. We're going to cut 100 basis points and change. Europe's going to stop hiking, etcetera. China has got deflation that they're trying to deal with, et cetera. I'm like, well, that's actually pretty good environment to own. Super robust bitcoin or gold or hard money, super robust, I think that's probably the.
00:07:27.894 - 00:08:18.732, Speaker A: Yeah, wow. It's definitely a lot of stuff mixing together here. I think back a year ago, I think about one year ago was really the beginning of the true collapse of the crypto credit complex. I'll say. I think you had Luna in May, you had three ac in June, and then, of course, the lenders that followed those events and then ultimately FTX. What does it look like now to you as someone who trades in these markets? The infrastructure scene, obviously it's smaller, but it's, gosh, it's such a different, it's such a different time. Obviously, macro we knew was getting more, was entering a tightening cycle then, but we didn't like, you know, wasn't as we weren't nearly as far along in it.
00:08:18.732 - 00:08:19.028, Speaker A: Right?
00:08:19.076 - 00:08:48.914, Speaker B: Yeah, no, absolutely. I think there have been notable changes to the market structure over the past twelve months, particularly with respect to how credit is extended and what jurisdiction credit is extended as well. I think, taking a step back, one of the reasons that crypto did so well over time was because of exchanges like FTX that gave you liquidity on alts and other things.
00:08:49.374 - 00:08:50.150, Speaker A: We've talked about that.
00:08:50.182 - 00:08:50.934, Speaker B: And leverage. Right.
00:08:50.974 - 00:08:54.822, Speaker A: Yeah. The derivatives there, the derivatives number of names they covered.
00:08:54.918 - 00:09:17.796, Speaker B: Absolutely. And so, generally speaking, when you increase the liquidity of an instrument, it attracts more and more capital. Right. If I know that I can hedge an alt position that's illiquid, I'm more likely to buy it. Right. Because I know I can go just, you know, if I'm able to trade the perp, I would go trade the perp. And so I'd be less worried about having an illiquid alt.
00:09:17.796 - 00:09:53.428, Speaker B: Right. If I wanted to speculate on alts, you know, long or to the short side, I wanna do it in a very capital efficient way. Right, right. And so generally, like, liquidity breeds size and it breeds more market participants and further adoption, et cetera. And so I think derivatives have a very important place in our marketplace, and they have an important place in every other market, and they help with tons of things. And so I think the fact that Coinbase and Gemini are opening these offshore exchanges are gonna be tremendously valuable. To the space.
00:09:53.516 - 00:09:54.756, Speaker A: Yeah. To the global crypto space.
00:09:54.780 - 00:10:22.286, Speaker B: To the global crypto space. It's gonna make it more capital efficient. It's going to make it so that people feel more comfortable trading alts around because there's more than one platform to trade them. If all of your perp risk is concentrated on one exchange, you're going to take less of perp risk. But now, if you can spread out your counterparty risk, it helps you do that. And so I think the additions of Coinbase is offshore Gemini. It's a pretty big deal for markets.
00:10:22.350 - 00:10:25.070, Speaker A: For the global crypto market, which is an extremely global market, by the way.
00:10:25.102 - 00:10:34.378, Speaker B: An incredibly global market. Yeah, but, yeah. And I see the tide turning from the US every day, and it's pretty dramatic.
00:10:34.426 - 00:10:35.418, Speaker A: Yeah, I hate to see that.
00:10:35.506 - 00:10:55.170, Speaker B: You hate to see it. But at the end of the day, I keep thinking about, I was having a conversation with somebody today that hires folks in Argentina. And one of the interesting points that I was highlighting during the conversation was, yeah, look at bitcoin and Argentina. Peso denomination. Yeah. New all time high.
00:10:55.282 - 00:10:57.698, Speaker A: Yeah. New all time high, very different environment there, right.
00:10:57.746 - 00:11:20.658, Speaker B: And so, you know, we think in the western world in dollarized ways, but, you know, versus a lot of, like, em, currencies and like, versus, you know, rates that you have to pay in terms of capital controls, et cetera. You know, bitcoin's still incredibly attractive. And like, I mean, there's just new good things like Liechtenstein today. Like, you can pay your taxes and, you know, so I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go to Vodou.
00:11:20.706 - 00:11:23.242, Speaker A: It's a country. It's a very small country, but it is a country.
00:11:23.338 - 00:11:29.114, Speaker B: But like, you know, they're part of the european financial system, trading swiss francs. Like, you know.
00:11:29.154 - 00:11:55.462, Speaker A: No, I agree. I think we've talked about this to the future of the american dollar and the current, like, sort of precarious geopolitical situation that exists and how bitcoin is a really interesting, like, gold is really interesting asset, particularly because it can actually, can actually use it, right? I mean, if you have gold, like, great. Like, I hope you have it on your person or like you really trust, like the vault from somewhere that it is stored. No, but you can't pay with it globally. You can't send it instantly.
00:11:55.618 - 00:12:41.508, Speaker B: I mean, basically the essence of money globally comes down to the idea that the US can print infinite amounts of money and people still want dollars and people still want to buy us debt. The moment that loses its significance or that statement is no longer true, that's when you'll actually start to see de dollarization. But for the time being, it's really tough. But like, the philosophical argument gets stronger by the day. Every bit that gets added to the deficit. I mean, just think about this banking crisis. They basically had to blanket guarantee all deposits for this banking crisis not to happen.
00:12:41.508 - 00:12:55.532, Speaker B: And now if you ask a government official, are all deposits guaranteed by the FDIC? They'll be like, no, but in theory it's like, will the US ever allow depositor to not be made whole in banks?
00:12:55.548 - 00:12:56.652, Speaker A: It'd be a big crisis of confidence.
00:12:56.748 - 00:13:16.148, Speaker B: It'd be a huge crisis of confidence. And so now you're at the point where this is the thing that I'm trying to stress, is you have a huge, like, moral hazard issue. And it's also like, why would anybody put money in one of these large g sips anymore? Like, if the government's coming and telling you that your deposits are safe at.
00:13:16.196 - 00:13:18.636, Speaker A: These regional banks, go wherever the rates are highest, why.
00:13:18.700 - 00:13:27.030, Speaker B: Why aren't people just navigating to. And it will happen over time. And personally, like, you know, I think these big banks, like, they're gonna have it coming to them.
00:13:27.062 - 00:13:28.390, Speaker A: It's gonna be an interesting dynamic.
00:13:28.502 - 00:13:34.966, Speaker B: I mean, six months from now, they're, you know, deposits in general are gonna go down. The marketplace is gonna get much more competitive.
00:13:35.030 - 00:14:08.130, Speaker A: And that's good, right? Overall, it's good. Strange to think that. Cause it's. They're denying that. That's the policy. The officials are right, but it's normally the criticism of the banking regulators, the Fed, whomever, in these situations is that their policies result in the centralization of banking power into the too big to fails. But your point is that if there is either an explicit or de facto blanket deposit insurance provided to everyone, that could actually decentralize the banking system more, which could be bad for the big banks.
00:14:08.130 - 00:14:09.162, Speaker A: It's an interesting.
00:14:09.298 - 00:14:11.138, Speaker B: It'd be very bad for the big banks.
00:14:11.226 - 00:14:15.338, Speaker A: All right, well, this is a great conversation. We're gonna talk more next week. It might be remote.
00:14:15.386 - 00:14:16.546, Speaker B: We have another 15 minutes.
00:14:16.610 - 00:14:18.538, Speaker A: No, dude, I could go.
00:14:18.626 - 00:14:19.282, Speaker B: I could go.
00:14:19.338 - 00:14:22.074, Speaker A: Bimnet Abibi from galaxy trading, my friend, as always, thank you so much.
