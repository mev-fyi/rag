00:00:00.560 - 00:00:37.050, Speaker A: You know, I remember this was early, this was 2018, and I was on a panel with one of the founders of Anchorage, and we were arguing back and forth about decentralization. And I said, do you want to be right or do you. And bitcoin was about $6,000 at the time. And I said, do you want to be right or do you want to be happy? And I said, if you want to be right, go tell the regulators that they can pound sand if you want to be happy. Let's find a way to work with the regulators. Because at the time, bitcoin, it's either going to be 6000 or 60,000. If it's 6000, we can all go home because nobody cares.
00:00:37.050 - 00:00:47.682, Speaker A: It's just a hobby. If it's 60,000, it starts to become a real financial asset that people want to have in their portfolios. That leads to other adoption, that leads to innovation, and that leads to more.
00:00:47.706 - 00:00:55.346, Speaker B: Valuable than all the world. Silver, I don't think people realize this. It's $1.2 trillion asset by itself, just bitcoin.
00:00:55.418 - 00:00:56.930, Speaker A: So I agree. Yes, that starts to matter.
