00:00:00.170 - 00:00:55.690, Speaker A: In short, the Denkun upgrade was a success by all these metrics, but there's still quite a lot to keep watching for and keep evaluating about the Denkun upgrade in the weeks and in the months to come. There is a data challenge being sponsored by the Ethereum foundation to source a lot of these insights and to financially incentivize people to really keep an eye out for how this impacts the ecosystem. And of course, developers are just continuing to blaze forward. In the latest dev call, there's a meme where there's this developer on a computer, and as soon as they achieve one milestone, they have a little woohoo for one blip, and then they go back to work. That's definitely Ethereum developers for you, because on the call they spent maybe just like two, two minutes talking about how well the upgrade went, and then they went straight to the next upgrade.
