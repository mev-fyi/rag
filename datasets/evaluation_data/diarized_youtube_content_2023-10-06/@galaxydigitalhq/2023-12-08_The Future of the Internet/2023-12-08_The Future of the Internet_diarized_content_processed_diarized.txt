00:00:00.200 - 00:00:18.086, Speaker A: This has been great. I think there's so much to learn about urbit. It truly is a fascinating rabbit hole if you're interested in the future of the Internet and also, of course, issues of self sovereignty, decentralization, privacy, security. It is an old project. It's been around now. It said it was founded in 2002.
00:00:18.190 - 00:00:52.394, Speaker B: That's right. I mean, it took a long time to bring it to a minimum viable state. It's there now. It's definitely there now. It certainly, the UX on urbit certainly will be able to meet, say, the expectations of crypto people who already are accustomed to jumping through hoops. So certainly the early adopters will have a more spartan attitude. But undoubtedly the UX required for mass adoption is in the works.
