00:00:07.680 - 00:00:12.598, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:12.726 - 00:00:14.006, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:14.190 - 00:00:27.430, Speaker A: Yeah, big day today. Fed day. Yet again, I'm as if you're watching on YouTube. You may notice I'm in Las Vegas for Microstrategy's bitcoin for corporations conference. Bimnett, you are on the ground there, audience.
00:00:27.502 - 00:00:28.674, Speaker B: You're there to gamble.
00:00:31.284 - 00:00:40.068, Speaker A: You were there on the ground in New York. What happened today? What did the Fed say? What's their policy? And what was your impression from Chairman Powell?
00:00:40.236 - 00:01:57.914, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say that the big notable change in policy was with respect to the balance sheet management. They are now going to roll off a smaller portion of their portfolio every month. So in treasury world, they are going to reduce their roll off from 60 billion per month to about 25 billion per month starting on June 1. And so that is a pretty big deal in the sense that the Fed is anticipating that eventually they will need to stop the balance sheet runoff. And there's a little bit of a philosophical debate in the sense of should you be cutting rates while engaging in hawkish balance sheet policy? And so this brings us closer to better alignment with respect to where we are in the monetary policy cycle. So I thought that was fairly notable. In addition to that, I do think Powell's kind of reluctance to meaningfully engage in a conversation about potential hikes was viewed pretty constructively by the market.
00:01:57.914 - 00:03:04.894, Speaker B: I think at the start of the presser, he basically started to list off a bunch of pieces of data that suggest that the economy is slowing in certain aspects. I would broadly perceive this FOMC meeting as being perceived as on the dovish end. And that is the reaction that you had in fixed income markets with the front end rallying anywhere from six to eight basis points. I think he struck a tone that acknowledged that further progress needs to be made on inflation. Just to give you an idea, maybe six months ago, the talk was about supercore inflation, which is inflation services inflation at ex housing. The three and six month run rates on those figures right now are very, very elevated. In addition, you had really hot January, February and March CPI prints, PPI prints as well.
00:03:04.894 - 00:03:32.264, Speaker B: Broadly speaking, in the context of those hotels inflation prints, Powell was reluctant to really push back against hike chatter. And so ultimately, I think he was about as dovish as he could possibly be in the context of a very hot price environment.
00:03:33.484 - 00:03:50.674, Speaker A: Yeah. And I saw right after he spoke and during equities rallied, I saw at one point the indexes were up like 1.5% or so on the day. And bitcoin rallied from. And we'll talk about bitcoin in a second. And then it looks like they, I was just checking the equities. I saw what happened in bitcoin.
00:03:50.674 - 00:04:19.174, Speaker A: They mostly gave it back, following it. So it was, this happens all the time, like either down a lot and then right back or up a lot and then back, like. But that instant sort of rally, brief rally in equities and bitcoin. Probably a bunch of other stuff I'm not looking at. That must be the market's reaction to your point about that. He, he seemed about as dovish as he could be. But then you take a breather and you're like, oh, well, it's pretty much the same situation as an hour ago.
00:04:19.334 - 00:05:04.024, Speaker B: No, absolutely. And I think part of the reason for the sell off is that higher for longer is going to pinch the economy. You already have credit card delinquencies shooting higher housing is starting to look a bit shaky. I saw a map of Denver homes for sale yesterday and it just seems like there's a ton more supply on the market, whether that's from new homes that are being built or existing supply. There's a ton of housing supply coming on right now and housing affordability is very low. And so there's a lot of supply into a market that doesn't have that many strong bids to it. And so stuff is cracking there.
00:05:04.024 - 00:06:09.778, Speaker B: And ultimately I do think about inflation as a tax on the consumer. You go to the pump, you go to the grocery store, you pay rent, you engage in normal activities and if that's going to eat away at your marginal consumption, then it's going to be bad for the economy ultimately. I think what you're starting to see is just cracks in the us consumer. I'll give you some names. There's a large coffee company that was down 17 18% today on weaker than expected figures from Q one and probably bad outlook as well. There was also a healthcare oriented chain company, pharmaceutical chain company that was also down 18% today, again signaling a weaker consumer. And so we are starting to see the effects of higher interest rate policy and tight monetary policy flow into the consumer.
00:06:09.778 - 00:07:14.134, Speaker B: And consumption is 70% of the us economy. And so there's enough reason to be cautious about hiking rates or keeping rates higher for too long. And so what I really think the price action shows you is that, you know, while monetary policy being a little bit more dovish than expected, is good for risk sentiment, ultimately the real economy is kind of what drives earnings and what really matters. And the real economy is slowing right now, period. And so we just have to stay very vigilant because it slows, then it could start rolling over much more quickly, especially if you start to see the labor market move the other direction. But as of right now, we had a hot ADP print today that was higher than expected. I expect non farm payrolls to be high.
00:07:14.134 - 00:08:16.492, Speaker B: Employment cost index, Fed's preferred measure for wages, was also a strong beat at 1.2%. Q one, there's a lot of weird things going on. Ultimately, I would say that what you're seeing happen is a story of stagflation at the moment where inflation is becoming really hot and staying hot while overall activity is slowing. ISM manufacturing today was the, the perfect kind of example where the activity indexes were weaker than expected, but the price is paid component of it was really hot. And so it just signals that growth is kind of cooling a little bit, but the price pressures are still there, and it almost seems as if they're entrenched at the moment. And that's why the Fed can't really cut right now.
00:08:16.588 - 00:08:30.908, Speaker A: Yeah. And yeah, makes sense. I saw the ISM stuff. It's effectively manufacturers input costs aren't going down, but the demand to buy the stuff they output is basically. So it's like, yeah, and there's a.
00:08:30.916 - 00:09:16.042, Speaker B: Purpose for producing the same goods are going up because the input costs are going up, but also the labor costs are simultaneously going up. So it costs more to produce every single unit, and there's a little bit less demand for every unit. And so it's a very tricky place to be right now. However, ultimately, I think the Fed's main concerns, inflation is a real issue, but a growth slowdown and employment ticking much higher ultimately is a way bigger concern for the Fed. And so it's just so hard to balance. I think Powell's got probably the hardest job on the planet right now, or one of the hardest jobs on the planet.
00:09:16.148 - 00:09:16.366, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:16.390 - 00:09:56.074, Speaker B: And I would say that the brevity of the statement and the brevity of the press conference sort of underscores how uncertain these policymakers are with respect to kind of what they're going to do, because the data could really go either direction at the moment. I do think that the growth stuff is cooling and inflation will likely come down, but it surprised markets pretty meaningfully to the upside in all of Q one. And so it's a very tricky place to navigate given kind of the volatility you've had in the data.
00:09:56.374 - 00:10:04.434, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I also want to ask you, but we don't have time today. So next week we're going to talk about this. But I want to talk a little bit about JPY.
00:10:04.854 - 00:10:10.262, Speaker B: And they just literally just got intervened on just now, just dropped.
00:10:10.318 - 00:10:12.432, Speaker A: So they did it again today on Wednesday.
00:10:12.598 - 00:10:13.012, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:13.068 - 00:10:34.188, Speaker A: Yeah. So they did it on, they did it on Monday. We'll talk about that. We don't have time because I want to get to the bitcoin and crypto price action a little bit here too. Obviously, we're recording this on Wednesday, May 1. Bitcoin's trading at like 57K ethers at this point, well below 3000. So it's a significant correction at this point.
00:10:34.188 - 00:11:25.144, Speaker A: Whereas it sort of felt for the sort of, since we had those all time highs in March, it felt more like we're kind of near it, we're below it, but it's more mostly chopping. You know, we had run all the way back up to 68 69 at one point, but now we're meaningfully down. We're 22 by my count, 22 and a half percent below that all time high of 73.8k. That's a, that's a legitimate correction. There's been prior, I've published about this how in prior bull runs there have been many of these, but you know, obviously macro sentiment. I mean, the S P is down a decent amount also over this timeframe. How are you thinking about it? Either those two combined, is it a macro thing? Did we just get overextended in our exuberance as all markets tend to when they're very excited? What do you think about the near path forward for bitcoin?
00:11:26.444 - 00:12:25.718, Speaker B: The short term path for bitcoin is tricky to figure out. And I would say that the things that I look at suggest that you're kind of close to a reasonable bottom. Historically in bull markets, you've had corrections of 20% to 30%. You're in that band right now and you're hovering around things like the 100 day moving average and a couple of support levels. And I think positioning has definitely shifted from folks being a little too long to closer to flat, a reasonable short base in the market as well. And then on top of that, you've had a significant amount of overriding flow in bitcoin that has brought call SKU a lot lower. Right here.
00:12:25.718 - 00:13:18.514, Speaker B: Right now, it definitely feels like a little bit of an oversold market that's hovering around supports and the macro environment doesn't seem great. And so I still kind of feel like it's probably still in do nothing land. But for folks that are more concerned about the medium term and the bigger picture story, I still think that's intact firmly. So the fiscal situation in the US has not gotten any better. Right? And ultimately I do think risk markets rally into the election as we're probably going to get more spending no matter who's elected. And generally equity markets tend to do well in the back half of the year. Santa Claus rally, October, November, December, et cetera.
00:13:18.514 - 00:14:17.784, Speaker B: And then on top of that, I do think that the 13 f filings in may can potentially be a potential positive catalyst for bitcoin in terms of folks realizing that there are real long money, sorry, real structural players in the global financial markets that are taking an active interest and really betting on it to go higher. I do think that 13 f filings can be a positive catalyst. And then the other part of it is just more platforms turning on. I do think that there are some constructive things that are happening, but right here, right now, it's really tough to call. It's really tough to call. And so I think technical levels are your friends. Bitcoin tends to respect them, at least on a first go and on retests and stuff.
00:14:17.784 - 00:14:31.124, Speaker B: So right here, right now, probably best to keep positioning a little bit on the lighter side. But for over the medium term, in the long run, I still think you're supposed to meant to stack.
00:14:31.824 - 00:14:36.056, Speaker A: Yeah. Bim Netabeebeebi, my friend from galaxy trading. As always, thank you for coming on.
00:14:36.080 - 00:14:37.704, Speaker B: Galaxy brains, thanks for having me.
