00:00:00.160 - 00:00:14.726, Speaker B: You know, I believe in tech and, you know, the adoption will be there, but not everything can be worth a billion dollars. Like right out the gate. Right out the gate. It's insanely hard to build a billion dollar business.
00:00:14.838 - 00:00:15.662, Speaker A: Yeah, but how.
00:00:15.686 - 00:00:20.678, Speaker B: Many billion dollar protocols do we have that make like $5 million a year, if that?
00:00:20.734 - 00:00:51.060, Speaker A: Yeah, not many. In fact, we were looking at of the top 20 coins, like on coinmarketcap.com, by which obviously includes stable coins and stuff too. Yeah, I think only five are the result of venture capital. So you've got $100 billion since 2015 invested in the crypto ecosystem by venture capitalists. According to our research, not all of that went into token projects, but of that, I mean, probably thousands of tokens created out of that money, and only five are in the top 20.
00:00:51.640 - 00:00:52.024, Speaker B: Right.
00:00:52.072 - 00:00:55.880, Speaker A: I remember saying, where is that value? Token VC'S? Where's that value.
