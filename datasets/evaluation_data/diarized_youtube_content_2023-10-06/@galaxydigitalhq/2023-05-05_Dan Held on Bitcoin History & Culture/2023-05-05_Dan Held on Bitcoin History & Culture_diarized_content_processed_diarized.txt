00:01:42.558 - 00:01:44.134, Speaker A: As always, how are you doing?
00:01:44.174 - 00:01:45.430, Speaker B: Well, thanks for having me.
00:01:45.502 - 00:01:48.126, Speaker A: Great to have you, as always. Big day today. Fed day.
00:01:48.190 - 00:01:49.646, Speaker C: Super bowl. It's your super bowl.
00:01:49.710 - 00:01:50.406, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:01:50.470 - 00:01:51.474, Speaker A: What happened?
00:01:51.774 - 00:02:28.702, Speaker B: So the Fed raised rates today by 25 basis points, taking the ban for the Fed funds rate from 475 to five to five and five and a quarter. That was pretty much expected. We had 22 basis points of 25 priced in. So this really came as. It came as no surprise to anyone. In addition, we had the release of the FOMC statement, and we also had the press conference. I would say that the message from Powell and the statement was broadly neutral.
00:02:28.702 - 00:03:52.144, Speaker B: It did not shock the market in any way. And you can see that by the lack of major moves in fixed income and in traditional markets. I think the most notable parts of it were his comments surrounding the banks and the regional banks in particular, he had a statement in there that said that he thinks the bank situation has actually eased from February to March recently, even though we've just had the first republic issue, the one thing I'd like to note for our audience is that the Fed actually has the most advanced banking data available to it, and that is ahead of the market. They actually have the loan survey data already. In addition, what we've been told is that their staffers have been communicating with a bunch of bank executives over the past couple of weeks. So they are getting real time sort of assessment of the banking situation amongst regionals. And so while I think that there's been a lot of sensationalism amongst the media and hype, I do agree with him that largely the bulk of the banking issues are from First Republic, Silicon Valley, Signature, etcetera, and that the rest of the banking system, or the banking issues are gonna be more drawn out as you sort of have the competition for deposits, et cetera, and they're not gonna be like, a bank is gonna get run in like a day.
00:03:52.144 - 00:03:55.076, Speaker B: And so the more acute threats to.
00:03:55.100 - 00:03:59.260, Speaker A: Those regional banks, we think have passed, there's still big lingering issues.
00:03:59.412 - 00:04:03.532, Speaker B: But what he had to acknowledge simultaneously was that the data is still really robust.
00:04:03.628 - 00:04:03.884, Speaker A: Right.
00:04:03.924 - 00:04:38.548, Speaker B: Just today alone, we had ADP. It's a payroll survey. Add 300,000 jobs in the United States. That's not non farm payrolls, that's on Friday. But ADP good enough is telling you that you're not only adding jobs, but you're adding jobs at a really robust rate, as if you hadn't hiked by 500 basis points already, which is wild. Then you look at the service sector of the economy, which is really important because the Fed's focused on services inflation. ISM services came out today surprised at a little bit higher prices.
00:04:38.548 - 00:05:10.664, Speaker B: Paid for services surprised higher. New orders for services, surprised higher. And you had the PMI for services come in and expansionary territory once again also have global pmis that are starting to shift higher. And so the data with respect to prices and service prices is telling you that you could probably still continue to hike. And the unemployment market. He said so in the speech today. Unemployment is at a 50 year low, 50 year low.
00:05:10.664 - 00:06:06.954, Speaker B: And so, yes, we do have these banking issues, and we've had three large banks fail under his watch. And any reasonable person can get to the conclusion that there wasn't sufficient supervision and that hiking rates too quickly and too high was probably a mistake or not doing it sooner or making it more gradual, et cetera. There were mistakes made, but it does not change the data backdrop. And I think the moment you get through this banking crisis stuff, people will settle and realize, what are we in? We're in a world where the US economy is still adding hundreds of thousands of jobs per month. And without that labor unemployment starting to tick up, it's going to be very tough for inflation to come down. And I think certain folks draw comfort from the idea that inflation break evens in twos, fives and tens. They're basically at 2% right now.
00:06:06.954 - 00:06:30.458, Speaker B: What I'd like to remind people, and what I constantly say, is that every single smart person is basically awful at predicting inflation. They have been for decades. They're every central banker, every trader, et cetera. For the most part, like, I don't know anyone that has been consistently right on inflation. And so when you see the market telling you you're going to get to 2% inflation, I'll be like, no, no way.
00:06:30.506 - 00:06:34.082, Speaker A: Like, that could be completely wrong. That could be completely wrong.
00:06:34.178 - 00:06:59.138, Speaker B: And it's just a function of like, just habits and, like, things that have changed over time. Like you're telling me that, you know, when you start going to the doctor and you're paying $100 a month and they're raising it $10 every year, they're going to stop raising it at some point, like that momentum has already started, right? And I think, again, it goes back to the difference between western folks and em folks.
00:06:59.186 - 00:06:59.394, Speaker A: Right?
00:06:59.434 - 00:07:08.922, Speaker B: Em folks have seen the fight against inflation. It just doesn't go away. It becomes entrenched. Especially when you're talking about a labor market that's at a 50 year old.
00:07:08.938 - 00:07:25.900, Speaker A: People have good jobs even today. So again, it's Wednesday, what, May 3. Correct. Which is why I was fed day. And no, I mean, even today, I'm watching people buying it cost $16 here, where we work, not in our building, but like at the place nearby, for three slices of pizza.
00:07:26.012 - 00:07:26.596, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:07:26.660 - 00:07:32.172, Speaker A: $16. It's more than $5 per slice of pizza. And the line was out the door.
00:07:32.308 - 00:07:32.908, Speaker B: Out the door.
00:07:32.956 - 00:07:45.670, Speaker A: People are willing to pay that. And so, like, it's, now this is, you know, lower Manhattan. It's a business area, right? There's plenty of cheaper pizza in New York than that. But I mean, like, that line is. No one's being like, oh, my God, I can't eat this too much.
00:07:45.702 - 00:07:49.246, Speaker B: I'm going to go to any airport. I mean, restaurants, et cetera.
00:07:49.270 - 00:07:50.310, Speaker A: They're all pretty expensive.
00:07:50.422 - 00:07:51.270, Speaker B: Everything's expensive.
00:07:51.342 - 00:08:04.394, Speaker A: And here's like, if we want inflation to come down, everyone needs to collectively throw their hands up and say, this is too expensive. But more of them are employed than ever. Right. Like there's, people don't feel they have to collectively.
00:08:04.694 - 00:08:25.710, Speaker B: Well, here's the thing. Unemployment's low, but there's also huge social safety net programs. Right. The student loan payments that were paused, the foreclosures that were paused as well. And then you just have this excess savings build from the stimulus checks, the PPP loans, et cetera. Like, you're still talking about like over a trillion dollars in excess savings in the.
00:08:25.742 - 00:08:33.318, Speaker A: I saw that. I saw that chart. Still, even, still. Let's talk about the debt of the United States of America.
00:08:33.366 - 00:08:34.278, Speaker B: Don't even get me started.
00:08:34.326 - 00:08:38.502, Speaker A: So we have a lot of it. What do we have? Over $31 trillion of 32 plus trillion.
00:08:38.558 - 00:08:41.438, Speaker B: I'd guess 33. I lift the over on 33.
00:08:41.566 - 00:08:42.870, Speaker A: It's a lot of debt.
00:08:43.022 - 00:08:43.390, Speaker B: Darn.
00:08:43.422 - 00:08:45.154, Speaker A: That's a lot of debt. You got a credit card?
00:08:45.544 - 00:08:48.432, Speaker B: Just try counting to a billion and then counting to a trade.
00:08:48.488 - 00:08:53.112, Speaker A: We've basically hit our credit limit. Right. Amex is saying, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
00:08:53.168 - 00:08:53.552, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:53.648 - 00:09:14.494, Speaker A: But we have this ace in our sleeve. We can actually, it turns out we're on the board of, of the credit card company and we can say, you know what? Raise our limit. And that's what we've been doing now for decades. Yes. And we have to do it now because we have exceeded the limit or hit the limit. We've talked about this. The treasury is currently using extraordinary measures to fund the government.
00:09:14.494 - 00:09:18.274, Speaker A: These are payments that we've already committed to.
00:09:18.314 - 00:09:18.442, Speaker C: Right.
00:09:18.458 - 00:09:26.306, Speaker A: So it's not new spending. And we had thought that for a while. It had been said that we could last to July, maybe even to August.
00:09:26.410 - 00:09:26.922, Speaker B: Correct.
00:09:27.018 - 00:09:42.294, Speaker A: Before a limit, the debt ceiling limit had to be raised. Now there's negotiations. The House managed to pass something. Speaker McCarthy rallied. It has other stuff, I think the Democrats were calling it. Oh, gosh. Like a right wing ransom note, I think is what one of the Senate democratic leaders said.
00:09:42.294 - 00:09:54.262, Speaker A: They're jostling now the secretary of the treasury, who is all, you know, Janet Yellen, who, who is the administration's chief economic spokesperson. She has now said it may hit the debt ceiling by June 1. That's less than a month away.
00:09:54.358 - 00:09:54.894, Speaker B: Correct.
00:09:55.014 - 00:09:59.854, Speaker A: There's some posturing there. But, you know, what are we, like, how important it's very important that this gets.
00:09:59.894 - 00:10:08.494, Speaker B: Insanely important that the US government does not default on its debt. It is the backbone of global finance is the US debt market.
00:10:08.574 - 00:10:08.898, Speaker A: Right.
00:10:08.966 - 00:10:17.122, Speaker B: And so it'd be a pretty big deal. Most people have no idea what the actual implications are in terms of how wild things could possibly get.
00:10:17.218 - 00:10:19.746, Speaker A: You mean the average person or smart people. Or smart people.
00:10:19.810 - 00:10:20.130, Speaker B: Everyone.
00:10:20.202 - 00:10:24.322, Speaker A: Yeah. No one knows. It could be economic apocalypse or it.
00:10:24.338 - 00:10:28.818, Speaker B: Could be like people have rushed to buy the bonds. Cause it's a flight to quality. Like, I don't know.
00:10:28.906 - 00:10:30.178, Speaker A: Does the bottle sell off?
00:10:30.226 - 00:10:31.074, Speaker B: Does it go bid?
00:10:31.154 - 00:10:31.546, Speaker A: No one knows.
00:10:31.570 - 00:10:31.754, Speaker C: Right.
00:10:31.794 - 00:10:33.282, Speaker B: Like, who knows?
00:10:33.378 - 00:10:35.154, Speaker A: Volatility is the only thing we can be certain of.
00:10:35.194 - 00:10:35.818, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:10:35.866 - 00:10:36.454, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:36.844 - 00:11:03.284, Speaker B: Which will bring me to a different point later on. But I think what you have is a setup that is really constructive for Republicans. I think. I think if you're an incumbent president that is running for reelection, you've got a lot more to lose than the congressional Republicans and Senate Republicans, et cetera. Because in the election, who ultimately is going to get the blame for not.
00:11:03.324 - 00:11:06.084, Speaker A: Raising the debt if it goes wrong, if there's going to be the president.
00:11:06.204 - 00:11:15.452, Speaker B: And you blame the president. And I think he's got a lot more to lose. And so I do genuinely think that Republicans will come out with something tangible.
00:11:15.508 - 00:11:17.588, Speaker A: Some kind of like a moratorium cap.
00:11:17.636 - 00:11:25.796, Speaker B: On future recession, et cetera, whatever it may be. And the other thing I know that I think for sure is that it will go down to the wire.
00:11:25.940 - 00:11:26.268, Speaker A: Right.
00:11:26.316 - 00:11:34.540, Speaker B: You will get more bang for your buck in terms of negotiating. When it's imagining, it's like you're doing that two car thing.
00:11:34.692 - 00:11:35.412, Speaker A: Game of chicken.
00:11:35.468 - 00:11:44.244, Speaker B: Game of chicken. And it's going to be the first person who flinches will lose. Ultimately, I think it's gonna come down to the wire just cause I think that's how the game theory works.
00:11:44.284 - 00:11:44.904, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:46.484 - 00:12:07.860, Speaker B: And I do think that Republicans will kind of win, but on the off chance that the US government does default. This is literally one of my favorite reasons to own bitcoin ever. Is the US government potentially defaulting because of a government that does not work. Again, friendly reminder, this is the same congress that took 16 attempts to elect McCarthy for House.
00:12:07.892 - 00:12:08.268, Speaker C: For a speaker.
00:12:08.316 - 00:12:09.268, Speaker A: For a speaker, yeah.
00:12:09.356 - 00:12:23.396, Speaker B: Right. And so this is a divided Congress and let alone within their own parties, but, you know, amongst each other as well. And the idea that the most important institution government in the world is about.
00:12:23.420 - 00:12:26.500, Speaker A: The default and mostly over political bickering too.
00:12:26.532 - 00:12:27.388, Speaker B: Not even political bickering.
00:12:27.436 - 00:12:30.468, Speaker A: They're not making a determination that we shouldn't raise the debt limit.
00:12:30.516 - 00:13:27.354, Speaker B: They just are fighting about it. People will fundamentally start doubting the idea of money and us treasuries and what that means. And I think that's going to be so incredibly constructive for bitcoin. I think the number one trade to have as a hedge, as a hedge for government default is owning bitcoin calls. I think bitcoin could trade north of this year's highs, probably closer to 40k on the chance of a genuine government default. Given how cheap those wings are, especially short dated stuff, I think owning bitcoin wingy upside is probably one of the best diversification government default hedges you can possibly have in a portfolio. And I think it's almost like if you were managing hundreds of billions in a cross asset portfolio, you're a big insurance company, you're a big real money account, and you're in crazy amount of treasuries.
00:13:27.354 - 00:13:57.016, Speaker B: The CDs market for us barely exists. You got to trade with a non us bank and it's weird, you might not get your payoffs. The best hedge for that. I think the best convexity in the market is bitcoin wings. And there are some other products as well, Vix and other sort of structures that could do well. But from my standpoint, I would feel like I was going against my duty to my firm, fiduciaries, etcetera.
00:13:57.040 - 00:14:07.880, Speaker A: You gotta bring this up, is what you're saying. This is a real. I mean, it makes sense, right? It's a non government issued FX. That's how I think about it. You know, a lot of people, including our boss, think about it as digital gold. Absolutely. Which plays the same kind of role.
00:14:07.880 - 00:14:22.384, Speaker A: I mean, gold would presumably. Gold will very well in that scenario. Let's hope it doesn't happen. You know, Mike Novogratz always says that he goes to bed every night praying for sound financial stewardship of the economy. Absolutely. But this question. Of course, but this question.
00:14:22.384 - 00:14:41.402, Speaker A: I mean, we don't want political operatives playing chicken with the US debt, right? So I don't know. We're gonna have to wait and see. We will follow up on that debt as we get closer. We've got about a month, it seems, to watch this play out either way. But that's all for now. Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, my friend, great to see you.
00:14:41.498 - 00:14:41.874, Speaker C: Pleasure.
00:14:41.914 - 00:14:42.882, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:14:42.978 - 00:14:48.282, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, Dan held. Great to see you, my friend. Thanks for coming on, Galaxy brains.
00:14:48.378 - 00:14:50.458, Speaker C: Yeah, appreciate it. It's a long time coming.
00:14:50.546 - 00:15:00.614, Speaker A: I appreciate it. And so, Dan, I think many people in our audience may know Dan. He's been in bitcoin for a long time. How long? When did you get into bitcoin?
00:15:01.514 - 00:15:06.054, Speaker C: I created my mount Gox account in 2011. I actually went back to go figure out the exact timing.
00:15:06.134 - 00:15:07.846, Speaker A: Do you have a claim or were you out of there before?
00:15:07.870 - 00:15:37.784, Speaker C: No, I mean, it's pretty fucking obvious that Mount Gox was gonna collapse. People who got trapped in that. I'm like, how the hell did you not see that happening? Because there's a couple. I got really frustrated about this because I emailed the Wall Street Journal and a couple other media publications and gave them all this data and none of them published it. I actually talked to Paul Vini about this, where I found the original email and I showed it to him again, and I'm like, look, I told you guys about this in July 2013, and it gave you everything on a platter amongst other publications as well. Forbes Kashmir Hill.
00:15:37.864 - 00:15:38.564, Speaker A: Yep.
00:15:39.584 - 00:15:53.696, Speaker C: Okay, so for two reasons, it was obvious. One, there was a. On a bitcoin talk because that's where everyone was back in that day. That's the forums, there was like a 500 paginated, like 500 page thread of people having withdrawal issues.
00:15:53.800 - 00:15:55.376, Speaker A: Right? That many?
00:15:55.520 - 00:15:57.632, Speaker C: Yeah, it was. It was every day.
00:15:57.688 - 00:15:58.736, Speaker A: That was a red flag.
00:15:58.880 - 00:16:19.850, Speaker C: Giant, giant, huge red flag. And then there is a price delta. So a price difference between bitstamp and Gox. And the only way to explain it is that the Gox bitcoin were more expensive. It's because people had to buy bitcoin to get their money out because the fiat wires weren't working. So those were very clear warning signs. So, no, I didn't get caught in that.
00:16:19.882 - 00:16:22.442, Speaker A: That's nice, but that's 2011, dude.
00:16:22.538 - 00:16:32.330, Speaker C: You had to send money via Dwala. There was like a weird Douala intermediary, and it would take like, three days to get there. So you just put your money in and you didn't really see it pop out the other side for like a week.
00:16:32.402 - 00:16:40.978, Speaker A: Well, the magic, the gathering, online exchange, it wasn't built for it to be a high powered financial market. That's what Mount Gox stands for.
00:16:41.146 - 00:16:43.034, Speaker C: What was it written in? Was it PhP or something?
00:16:43.074 - 00:16:46.938, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, it's like what you used to write, like, bulletin boards in, in like, 2003.
00:16:47.026 - 00:16:49.754, Speaker C: Oh, the interview he had on the blue. The blue ball.
00:16:49.834 - 00:16:50.490, Speaker A: Carpeles.
00:16:50.562 - 00:17:02.224, Speaker C: Yeah, carpelles or whatever. Yeah, he had that blue exercise ball and he did an interview with Reuters on that. Oh, man. I mean, Carpelis was convicted for fraud in France prior.
00:17:02.344 - 00:17:03.336, Speaker A: It's so ridiculous.
00:17:03.400 - 00:17:07.024, Speaker C: Yeah. So, like, this guy was like a. Yeah, he's an idiot.
00:17:07.104 - 00:17:09.328, Speaker A: Yeah. So that was 2011.
00:17:09.456 - 00:17:09.976, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:17:10.080 - 00:17:14.968, Speaker A: So you were interested in doing bitcoin stuff. When did you. Professionally?
00:17:15.096 - 00:17:17.912, Speaker C: You know, it's funny is that people used to say bitcoins, too.
00:17:17.968 - 00:17:18.656, Speaker A: Bitcoins, yeah.
00:17:18.720 - 00:17:20.120, Speaker C: I see sometimes you do, but.
00:17:20.152 - 00:17:26.184, Speaker A: Yeah, but depends. But, yes, bitcoin stuff, when did you start doing it full time?
00:17:26.224 - 00:17:34.198, Speaker C: Like, professionally? Yeah, I worked at a small investment firm in Dallas, and then they relocated me to San Francisco. And while I was in San Francisco, I started to go to the bitcoin meetups.
00:17:34.246 - 00:17:34.974, Speaker A: Yep, yep.
00:17:35.014 - 00:17:47.674, Speaker C: So this was at 20 mission. I mean, at that time, there's only a dozen of us. This is January 2013. And it was like Brian and Fred. There were dozens. Brian and Fred from Coinbase would go, yeah, there's dozens of us. Dozens.
00:17:47.674 - 00:18:02.398, Speaker C: Brian and Fred. Charlie Lee, Jed McCaleb, Jesse Powell. I'm the fucking pleb. Non billionaire of the group. So it was small. It was literally a dozen people. Like a cooler of pbrs.
00:18:02.398 - 00:18:18.114, Speaker C: It was actually a bathtub with ice and pbrs. Yeah. Pbrs were all we could afford, so that was pretty. And Jared Kinna was the guy who owned 20 mission. He also built the first Us exchange called Tradehill. This is so old. No one remembers this stuff anymore.
00:18:18.114 - 00:18:23.338, Speaker C: But that's the early community. So I started to go to that. I was wearing business, like, business cash.
00:18:23.386 - 00:18:25.242, Speaker A: Coming from work, basically coming from work.
00:18:25.418 - 00:18:27.082, Speaker C: And everyone else is in hoodies and shit.
00:18:27.138 - 00:18:27.774, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:28.714 - 00:18:49.206, Speaker C: So March 2013, price went from $10 to 260. And that's when the fervor really happened. So we had 100 people come to the meetup. There's like 100 people. There were VC's. I mean, I remember David Chen from Lightspeed Partners, like, handing out business cards, and I'm like, whoa, I'm three months in Silicon Valley, right? I'm like a noob.
00:18:49.270 - 00:18:52.014, Speaker A: You got lightspeed. I mean, that's a big fund. They've been around for a long time.
00:18:52.054 - 00:19:17.356, Speaker C: Yeah, they're big funds. And things felt tangible. And then around then is when I decided to build my first product. So, on mobile, when you try to check the price of bitcoin, all the mobile apps at the time didn't have live prices for no technical reason. The engineers are just lazy. They didn't want to ping the API and pull the price down. So we built the first real time market data product with news charts kind of all encompassing.
00:19:17.356 - 00:19:38.144, Speaker C: So that was my first foray into product building. And it's called Zeroblock, and it became the most popular mobile app in crypto in 2013. Then we got bought by blockchain.com dot. That was the first PM@blockchain.com. Back in December 2013. So that was my foray into tech and into crypto professionally, was moving out to sf, building my first mobile product.
00:19:38.144 - 00:19:53.818, Speaker C: The way I describe it, I think most accurately is I stumbled and bumbled my way into it. I didn't know what product thinking was. I just built a product. I was obsessed about to solve my own problem. And that turns out, actually how you build great products.
00:19:53.946 - 00:19:58.138, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. I mean, you knew what you needed. You were a user.
00:19:58.266 - 00:20:00.186, Speaker C: Precisely. That was the target audience.
00:20:00.250 - 00:20:18.842, Speaker A: So you went to Blockchain.com, which is obviously still around, and a pretty big, pretty, I would say relatively big player even today at one point. This is definitely stale, but they had 25 million wallets at some point, much later than that. What did you do there? And then what was your whole blockchain? What was next?
00:20:18.898 - 00:20:34.778, Speaker C: Blockchain.com at the time was pretty hot. Yeah. There's the whole, like, Abraham and Isaac story too, where like, there was a divorce between. Because originally it was Brian Armstrong and the founder of Blockchain.com, comma, what's his name? Ben Reeves. They're originally supposed to work together.
00:20:34.778 - 00:20:39.042, Speaker C: Interesting. Yeah, yeah, there's a whole. This has actually been written up, I think, in wired.
00:20:39.138 - 00:20:47.930, Speaker A: Yeah, there might be also. What was that book? Somebody wrote a decent book about Coinbase. I can't remember what it's called, but also has some history like this in there about. I think about that split.
00:20:48.042 - 00:20:56.714, Speaker C: Yeah. Blockchain.com was non custodial. It's a web wallet. So it was a pretty hot idea. Very popular wallet. A ton of people used blockchain.com
00:20:56.714 - 00:20:59.434, Speaker C: back in the day. The block explorer as well. Right.
00:20:59.474 - 00:21:04.974, Speaker A: Blockchain dot in fo, although get there through.com, comma, one of the biggest block explorers still.
00:21:05.634 - 00:21:38.960, Speaker C: And there was a lot we thought we could do with that to build like, a DAp store, decentralized apps on top of our Web interface. Advertising, of course, was an early, quick monetization path. There was just a lot of bad execution and leadership, I think that led to blockchain.com floundering, because when's the last time you've heard someone name drop, I have a blockchain.com wallet. Or you've seen it, someone pull it open or any reference to a blockchain.com wallet?
00:21:39.072 - 00:21:52.960, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it's really hard to sustain. And then you have binance, FTX or whatever. I mean, these big, giant new players constantly come in and disrupt. There's very few coinbase maybe being even, like, bit stamp.
00:21:53.032 - 00:21:53.880, Speaker C: Right. Yeah.
00:21:53.952 - 00:22:03.946, Speaker A: Been around. Longest running exchange, I think, survivors, but not that big. Right. It's always like these new guys keep coming in and disrupting. Yeah.
00:22:03.970 - 00:22:11.834, Speaker C: I mean, if it's hard to sustain that, it's super hard. I mean, the fact that, like, Kraken is still alive and thriving after this long is, honestly, it's a race of survival.
00:22:11.954 - 00:22:12.498, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:12.626 - 00:22:13.586, Speaker C: It's a marathon.
00:22:13.690 - 00:22:14.282, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:14.418 - 00:22:20.442, Speaker C: And whether, like, regulations kill you, competition kills you. Just surviving, though, alone is, like, a pretty hard thing to do.
00:22:20.498 - 00:22:20.778, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:20.826 - 00:22:21.738, Speaker C: Not getting hacked.
00:22:21.826 - 00:22:29.076, Speaker A: Right. I mean, you're holding digital bearer assets. It's like the number one cybersecurity, like honey pot.
00:22:29.170 - 00:22:35.640, Speaker C: Like, if we were to ask noobs and we'd be like, hey, have you heard of Bittrex or Crypsy or Poloniex? They'd be like, I've never heard.
00:22:35.672 - 00:22:55.864, Speaker A: Remember cryptopia, the one that was, like, New Zealand one? Yeah. Poloniacs was based in Boston. No one even knew they were there. In fact, I almost. I did some interviews for a job there when I was trying to move full time into crypto before I. I was at fidelity, before I did it at fidelity. And I was like, yeah, you know, I like the troll box on Poloniex.
00:22:55.904 - 00:23:01.436, Speaker C: Like, I use this. BTCE was my. My most cherished exchange, the one that.
00:23:01.460 - 00:23:06.676, Speaker A: They shut down for, like, being, like, a russian money laundering thing.
00:23:06.780 - 00:23:17.444, Speaker C: In the end, I loved BTCE. BTCE was wonderful. So no Kyc aml. It was broken. English and Russian. But they never. They never rug pulled.
00:23:17.524 - 00:23:22.500, Speaker A: Yeah, as far. As far. No, they got taken down because, like, Interpol said that there were terrorists on.
00:23:22.532 - 00:23:23.756, Speaker C: It's even more epic than that, though.
00:23:23.780 - 00:23:24.132, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:24.228 - 00:23:46.958, Speaker C: So they ran for, like, seven years without getting taken down, and then they finally got taken down when they got taken down. So, like, the FBI, like, worked with Interpol, seized the server. The private key management was so good that they just lost all the fiat. So they popped up another website, and they're like, you can log in over here and we have all your crypto. Oh, my gosh. So they had 70% of the funds were in crypto, and they were like, yeah, you can withdraw it. So even when they got seized, they.
00:23:46.966 - 00:23:49.078, Speaker A: Didn'T actually get seized. Wow.
00:23:49.206 - 00:23:51.366, Speaker C: They were actually pretty, like, crypto og ethos.
00:23:51.430 - 00:23:52.798, Speaker A: Yeah, I like that. That's interesting.
00:23:52.886 - 00:23:55.238, Speaker C: They're definitely a front for, like, money laundering for Russia.
00:23:55.326 - 00:24:01.726, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, you know, in early, like, you know, Central caucus region, bitcoin exchange.
00:24:01.790 - 00:24:06.110, Speaker C: It was amazing, though. I mean, you email address, you go in, and the liquidity was real.
00:24:06.222 - 00:24:06.494, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:06.534 - 00:24:10.846, Speaker C: So the interface is terrible. They're the ones who pioneered the troll box. That's where it came from.
00:24:10.950 - 00:24:16.394, Speaker A: The troll box was a big part of, like, the pre 17 and earlier crypto trading world.
00:24:16.974 - 00:24:27.988, Speaker C: Rice, chicken, rice, chicken rise. That's like an litecoin early memetic thing. Sometimes I feel like the moment in, what's it called? It's blade Runner.
00:24:28.036 - 00:24:28.332, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:28.388 - 00:24:31.132, Speaker C: You know, at the end where Harrison Ford and the Android are there.
00:24:31.188 - 00:24:31.900, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:32.092 - 00:24:36.692, Speaker C: And he laments how no one will ever see the things that he's seen. Those will all fade.
00:24:36.788 - 00:24:37.244, Speaker A: Yep.
00:24:37.324 - 00:24:38.756, Speaker C: That's how I feel with some of this stuff.
00:24:38.860 - 00:24:53.364, Speaker A: It is. It feels like ancient history, because I feel like when the big bull runs happen, the, like, so many new people come in that it's just impossible to impart all of the oral tradition.
00:24:53.484 - 00:24:57.884, Speaker C: Yeah. There's like, you've got these old narratives. Right, from the previous epics.
00:24:58.004 - 00:24:58.540, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:58.652 - 00:25:05.844, Speaker C: Then you have these new narratives that just come in, and the size of the community behind the narrative is so large that it just kind of, like, crushes. It's so true.
00:25:05.884 - 00:25:16.172, Speaker A: I mean, even think about, you know, we talked with. We talked about, like, the, you know, sound money laser eyes culture from, like, the last two plus years.
00:25:16.228 - 00:25:18.844, Speaker C: That's 1819 era, very different from like.
00:25:18.884 - 00:25:46.640, Speaker A: The 1617 and even before that. But I mean, very, very different. But, you know, right around the halving and particularly accelerated at the third having and COVID money printing. That was like a real inflection point for bitcoin sound money narrative. And then you had, you know, what Pete Rizzo calls the monetary maximalist takeover, sort of the bitcoin culture. There used to be the platform maximalist that said that, you know, everything should be a test net for bitcoin. And if there's something good, we'll actually incorporate it to the platform.
00:25:46.792 - 00:25:48.128, Speaker C: That was a common narrative by the.
00:25:48.136 - 00:25:54.982, Speaker A: Wayside, I think, as a dominant form of bitcoin culture, come back, inscriptions might be moving some of that culture back.
00:25:55.038 - 00:25:59.622, Speaker C: I do think so. I think. I think bitcoin defi, that Overton window has now been shifted.
00:25:59.678 - 00:26:30.078, Speaker A: Let's talk about that, because you've been talking about bitcoin Defi for a while. And by the way, you also had great content for a long time. Evaluating. Now, I know some people have given you crap about this because blockfi ultimately like, went out of business or whatever, but you had great content on how to do lending and options types, activity across the ecosystem where you would do. You'd borrow or you'd lend, or you do call overriding strategies or whatever you were doing at a bunch of different vendors and exchanges and publish all the information.
00:26:30.206 - 00:26:36.614, Speaker C: Yeah, I was one of the first ones to call out Celsius and stuff like that. Cause I'm like, these seem super shady. Definitely wouldn't have your money there.
00:26:36.654 - 00:26:38.334, Speaker A: As someone who used, like, all of them.
00:26:38.414 - 00:27:03.226, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I checked them all out. Yeah, yeah, I got a lot of flack for that too, because people were like, oh, my God, you recommended these services. And I'm like, I had a spreadsheet with. And I had a spreadsheet that showed my exact coin holdings at each one. I mean, I lost ten bitcoin at Genesis. Like, okay. Like, I didn't analyze the risk properly, but what other individual would write up this content and put their money where their mouth is other than myself?
00:27:03.330 - 00:27:03.594, Speaker A: So.
00:27:03.634 - 00:27:25.872, Speaker C: And I still got a ton of flak. Everyone was like, fuck you. You recommend you had money at Blockfi at one point. And I'm like, I said a year and a half before they went under to move all your money out of blockfi. But people will take screenshots from a 2019 tweet and be like, you talked about Blockfi favorably in 2019. I'm like, what the fuck's wrong with you? Never read any of my other stuff where I'm like, yeah, my money's out of blockfire. The sheet has zero for Blockfi for.
00:27:25.888 - 00:27:26.796, Speaker A: A year and a half.
00:27:26.970 - 00:28:12.494, Speaker C: And that's where the Maxis get really fucking annoying, where they're like. And then they're like, oh, all lending is evil. I mean, that is absurd. This is a common narrative amongst the hardcore fundamentalist Maxis now, where they're like, all lending is evil and yield is evil and it's usury. And I'm like, what the hell is wrong with you? This is called capitalism, of people assessing risk and then allocating, assigning an interest rate that compensates them for the risk that will always exist, even in a bitcoin standard. And there's this weird thing that's happened now where, like, it's a very, very anti capitalist, anti free markets tone, where nfts are immoral and evil and scam somehow. And I'm like, okay, who cares if people want to buy and sell art, whatever.
00:28:12.494 - 00:28:23.834, Speaker C: It really started with Seyfiddin creating this culture just to call it out I like his thoughts on a lot of other things, but the whole modern art thing, that's where that came from.
00:28:23.874 - 00:28:25.554, Speaker A: Yeah, it's in the bitcoin standard.
00:28:25.714 - 00:28:56.072, Speaker C: Yeah. These things are fiat things, and fiat things are evil or moral, but he's assigning subjective, weird values to fiat things and moral things. If you want to be a free markets person and capitalists, and you want to believe in bitcoin, you have to be open to people buying and selling whatever they want. Otherwise you're authoritarian. So it's a more authoritarian leaning, which is really bizarre. And this newer cohort of bitcoiners, laser eye like fundamentalist types, which I don't think many bitcoiners would actually. If you gave them a choice, they wouldn't actually be like, yeah, I'm for that.
00:28:56.072 - 00:29:12.112, Speaker C: Just like a very loud minority. It's pretty sad to see, because I'm like. They're like, oh, yeah, if you sell a course, that's evil. If you buy or sell art, that's evil. If you earn interest, that's evil. And I'm like, what the fuck is wrong with you people? This is bizarre.
00:29:12.168 - 00:29:18.696, Speaker A: It is a fundamentalist viewpoint sort of focused on sound money as the only thing that is sound.
00:29:18.840 - 00:29:27.672, Speaker C: Look, my big narrative. You remember back when we first met, I think back in 1819, I was hitting the. Hitting the bell of sound money.
00:29:27.768 - 00:29:28.288, Speaker A: Right.
00:29:28.416 - 00:29:34.984, Speaker C: And I still believe in the whole sound money thesis. They're not really correlated with each other at all. You can be sound money and have, you know.
00:29:35.024 - 00:29:35.952, Speaker A: And have other stuff. Yeah.
00:29:36.008 - 00:29:43.344, Speaker C: If bitcoin's going to be the world reserve currency, it's going to have everything else on it. Right. Like, right. There's not going to be this world of just pure bitcoin.
00:29:43.424 - 00:29:46.576, Speaker A: Like, the only thing you can do is hold bitcoin.
00:29:46.680 - 00:29:46.968, Speaker C: Right.
00:29:47.016 - 00:29:53.528, Speaker A: I know. Well, you're going to have to spend bitcoin on education, on artwork, on whatever. On. On McDonald's.
00:29:53.616 - 00:29:53.976, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:29:54.040 - 00:29:54.644, Speaker A: Right.
00:29:55.954 - 00:30:03.722, Speaker C: It's a cultural thing where people want to be in the in group. And so whatever the in group is deciding as the in thing, everyone signals that they're into that thing.
00:30:03.818 - 00:30:19.810, Speaker A: Well, that's. I think, you know, I think this really accelerated in COVID. Everyone's at home, literally. I mean, you're literally at home. The podcast circuit was humming. The money printer was burring. The having occurred.
00:30:19.810 - 00:30:21.842, Speaker A: There was plenty of good reason clubhousing.
00:30:21.938 - 00:30:24.494, Speaker C: That we were on. You were a legend earlier, right.
00:30:24.954 - 00:30:28.922, Speaker A: I still do, technically. I think I control the Bitcoin club, on clubhouse.
00:30:28.978 - 00:30:29.810, Speaker C: How many followers is that?
00:30:29.842 - 00:30:37.322, Speaker A: This has 500,000 followers, which I think is no offense to clubhouse, but I think that's, like, two or three times the total number of clubhouse users at this point.
00:30:37.378 - 00:30:37.974, Speaker C: Sure.
00:30:38.434 - 00:30:46.218, Speaker A: But, yeah. So it accelerated, and we were all. And we weren't out and about. When you meet people in person, you're not gonna. Most people aren't toxic in person.
00:30:46.266 - 00:30:46.738, Speaker C: No.
00:30:46.866 - 00:30:56.586, Speaker A: But the Internet culture, you know, the edge lord stuff, like, the people are just much more likely to in group associate and then, you know, attack the out group at any.
00:30:56.690 - 00:31:00.898, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. And I've only been heckled once in person, and it was a pretty minor thing.
00:31:00.946 - 00:31:01.586, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:31:01.610 - 00:31:04.218, Speaker C: And it wasn't like, when I was up on stage, it was just, like, in passing.
00:31:04.346 - 00:31:08.794, Speaker A: Yeah. So I. And. But I do think it feels like the tide is turning a little bit.
00:31:08.874 - 00:31:14.794, Speaker C: It is fun with the Internet trolls, though. I always loved, when I see them in person, to give them a very warm embrace and, like, a very heart firm handshake.
00:31:14.834 - 00:31:15.218, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:15.306 - 00:31:17.946, Speaker C: It's like a bear hug of cringe.
00:31:18.130 - 00:31:23.914, Speaker A: It is funny, too, because if they don't come out and say what they said to you online, that's your winning right there.
00:31:23.954 - 00:31:36.898, Speaker C: Most of them are super fucking beta. Like, you know, you just come up to them and give them a warm hug, and they get, like, really fucking uncomfortable. It's wonderful. It's, like, the best. Yeah. They can't reject it because they look like an asshole in person.
00:31:37.026 - 00:31:37.602, Speaker A: Right.
00:31:37.738 - 00:31:44.086, Speaker C: So they have to accept it. But you can tell they're dying from the cringe. So you're just like. I just revel in those moments.
00:31:44.270 - 00:32:02.070, Speaker A: But the culture is expanding. I think inscriptions have a big part in this. There was another thing, too. John Light's paper on roll ups. On roll ups on bitcoin. I think got a lot of people interested in what more could be done. So almost a platform maximalist resurgence.
00:32:02.070 - 00:32:19.450, Speaker A: Now, I wouldn't say it's not taking over bitcoin culture, but it's bringing a lot of people, let alone just the straight up inscription. Movement is literally bringing in thousands and thousands of people that. Many of whom left bitcoin for other chains because they wanted to do other stuff. Other chains. Many people who've never been interested in bitcoin at all.
00:32:19.482 - 00:32:33.890, Speaker C: And inscriptions are bringing back. Inscriptions steal market share away from other chains. It brings them back to bitcoin. These are more like Ethan and Solana, maximalists. And now they're into bitcoin, which is great. Bitcoiners should be jumping for joy with this. I noticed.
00:32:33.890 - 00:33:06.622, Speaker C: So I'm writing a paper called Casino games, which I haven't written something long for in a long time. Casino games essentially says that all of adoption in crypto is primarily through speculation. And so bitcoin, if you think about bitcoin as a casino, it's got one game, spot trading basically. And that speculative game is what draws most people in. This is completely obvious. We have 1317, 2021 as the cycles adoption occurs. That way adoption did not occur because 100 Nigerians were paying for food with bitcoin.
00:33:06.622 - 00:33:21.422, Speaker C: So like when we see that happen, we see these speculative loops draw in more and more users. This is the natural user acquisition cycle for a money. The bitcoin casino only has one game. Ethereum casino has bunch yield farming.
00:33:21.478 - 00:33:22.070, Speaker A: Tons of games.
00:33:22.142 - 00:33:33.202, Speaker C: Tons of games, lots of games. Now bitcoiners might dismiss that as, oh, well, that's just speculation. Well, newsflash, that's how bitcoin got adopted. People didn't buy bitcoin because it sound money, right?
00:33:33.218 - 00:33:36.546, Speaker A: You come for the game, for the moon, and you stay for the sound money.
00:33:36.610 - 00:33:38.202, Speaker C: Precisely. That's what most people did.
00:33:38.258 - 00:33:38.618, Speaker A: Right.
00:33:38.706 - 00:34:07.424, Speaker C: Even, even early on, even part of us probably, yeah, for sure. Yeah. So bitcoiners like to believe that bitcoin is immune from this speculation is this dirty word? No, that's how bitcoin got adopted and that's how people are getting into Ethereum. Now what I noticed at NFT NYC last year is that people were thinking in Ethereum standard once they bought nfts, they're like, yeah, man, I bought it for point one. He flipped it for. .3 right? Now, do they understand anything about Ethereum's monetary policy? No, they don't understand that at all.
00:34:07.424 - 00:34:34.664, Speaker C: But if that speculative game introduced them to Ethereum, and now they're holding Ethereum and thinking in Ethereum standard, they're ethereums. They're ethereums. And that's a decent way to introduce them to a money. Now, I don't think the Ethereum community understood this fundamentally. At the beginning they were just like, build stuff, stuff will happen. They stumbled upon this via luck. The bitcoin community, I believe, needs to embrace it because speculation will lead to more people holding bitcoin, which helps bitcoin long term.
00:34:34.664 - 00:35:02.452, Speaker C: More speculative games are good for bitcoin. That includes nfTs, other Defi things. Now some of these do have very fundamental good use cases too. People want to sell digital assets like digitally native assets that are non fungible nfts. Those I think make a lot of sense on a blockchain. You'll have other things as well. Borrowing and lending your bitcoin will be an inherent activity that a lot of people would want to do.
00:35:02.452 - 00:35:04.344, Speaker C: So that will exist as well.
00:35:04.644 - 00:35:16.116, Speaker A: I like to see that in something that is more defi than CFI because it's much more transparent. Right. I mean, there are risks, obviously, with like, you know, take the ethereum ecosystem, smart contract hacks and bugs and all that.
00:35:16.140 - 00:35:32.652, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, let's definitely not gloss over the risk of zero days, you know, like, I think a lot of the Defi side, totally. They're like, oh, we have no counterparty risk. I'm like, yeah, you fucked wod, like, but you have a massive amount of zero day, like, protocol risk. And they're like, yeah, whatever, hold on a second.
00:35:32.748 - 00:35:39.788, Speaker A: But they're, and I totally agree, it's an absolutely massive risk. And it's, by the way, it's also one that's basically impossible for an average person to evaluate.
00:35:39.836 - 00:35:40.596, Speaker C: Oh, yeah.
00:35:40.660 - 00:35:53.004, Speaker A: So even almost every one of the big hacks that has happened in Ethereum default was also, the application went through a rigorous process, it really did, by these security auditing firms. And still you don't know, and you screw up. So there is risk.
00:35:53.164 - 00:35:54.356, Speaker C: Defi is our goal.
00:35:54.460 - 00:36:03.684, Speaker A: Yeah, Defi is the goal, because if you look at what happened with the credit deleveraging in CFi, Defi really performed blue chip defi, quote unquote performed really well.
00:36:03.764 - 00:36:04.468, Speaker C: Totally.
00:36:04.636 - 00:36:11.504, Speaker A: So that's, we'd like to see, I guess. But where does that happen? Does that happen on. Can't happen on the l one right now.
00:36:11.544 - 00:36:11.720, Speaker C: Right.
00:36:11.752 - 00:36:12.856, Speaker A: Where does it have bitcoin?
00:36:12.920 - 00:36:18.176, Speaker C: Kind of, I mean, partially signed bitcoin transactions? You can do dexs, ordinal dexs on bitcoin layer one.
00:36:18.240 - 00:36:18.624, Speaker A: Yes.
00:36:18.704 - 00:36:22.164, Speaker C: I mean, Defi is this all encompassing term for, like, what does that mean?
00:36:22.464 - 00:36:24.032, Speaker A: Every Dex can be done, kind of.
00:36:24.088 - 00:36:33.136, Speaker C: Dex can be kind of done on bitcoin, l one. So there's really cool things you can do with that. Bitcoin's inherent protocol design pushes a lot of that activity to l two.
00:36:33.200 - 00:36:33.544, Speaker A: Right.
00:36:33.624 - 00:36:50.434, Speaker C: So we'll probably see most of that happen in l two s. I mean, you've got a bunch of l two s. You probably talked about them previously. You've got lightning rootstock, stacks, et cetera. I mean, stacks is kind of like arbitrum and polygon, where they're like l two with a token.
00:36:50.514 - 00:37:02.010, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like a bitcoin. It's a bitcoin adjacent l two, as opposed to, I mean, if the layer technology maximalists are listening, they would say, well, it's not technically an l two.
00:37:02.042 - 00:37:03.286, Speaker C: It's not technically an l two.
00:37:03.410 - 00:37:06.486, Speaker A: Cause it doesn't derive its security directly from the l one.
00:37:06.630 - 00:37:07.622, Speaker C: It kind of does, but it kind.
00:37:07.638 - 00:37:08.398, Speaker A: Of does in a different way.
00:37:08.446 - 00:37:09.382, Speaker C: It's, like, really fucking weird.
00:37:09.438 - 00:37:09.750, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:09.822 - 00:37:11.742, Speaker C: I think a lot of people get, like, freaked out by it, but either way.
00:37:11.758 - 00:37:15.678, Speaker A: And you also have side chains, you have liquid, you have. Is that it?
00:37:15.806 - 00:37:16.806, Speaker C: Rootstock is a side chain.
00:37:16.830 - 00:37:17.166, Speaker A: It is, yeah.
00:37:17.190 - 00:37:20.750, Speaker C: Rootstock. But Rootstock also has a token. Most people forget that, actually.
00:37:20.822 - 00:37:21.366, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:37:21.470 - 00:37:21.894, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:37:21.974 - 00:37:24.574, Speaker A: So, like, I think.
00:37:24.694 - 00:37:26.734, Speaker C: Or you can pay for the gas fees in bitcoin.
00:37:26.814 - 00:37:27.830, Speaker A: That's very interesting.
00:37:27.982 - 00:37:29.006, Speaker C: LBTC, I think.
00:37:29.070 - 00:37:29.382, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:29.438 - 00:37:31.320, Speaker C: Or SBC, one of the.
00:37:31.392 - 00:37:33.124, Speaker A: Yeah, they have their own RBTC.
00:37:33.664 - 00:37:35.204, Speaker C: Yeah, it's RBTC. Yeah.
00:37:35.984 - 00:37:56.368, Speaker A: So especially with the new crowd coming in, partly from inscriptions. A lot of these folks from Ethereum who like NFTs now, they like bitcoin inscriptions now. They might say, well, wait a second. Where do I do my, my, my defi? Because then ETH when I buy. And that's been really interesting because the long term dominant maxi, bitcoin, maxi culture hasn't been interested in doing defi.
00:37:56.416 - 00:37:56.750, Speaker C: Right?
00:37:56.832 - 00:38:00.466, Speaker A: So, like, RSK's Rootstock's been around, isn't it? Sergio Lerner, it's been around forever.
00:38:00.530 - 00:38:04.610, Speaker C: Yeah. Been around forever. Well, people forget that, like, NFT started on bitcoin.
00:38:04.642 - 00:38:04.882, Speaker A: Right?
00:38:04.938 - 00:38:06.010, Speaker C: Rare pepe's on counterpart.
00:38:06.042 - 00:38:09.418, Speaker A: But bitcoiners just weren't that interested. I mean, they were a little interested.
00:38:09.506 - 00:38:16.578, Speaker C: The newest, newest cohort that are more fundamentalists, that have all these stupid, arbitrary things that they've assigned to bitcoin. But the old bitcoiners, the Ogs, myself.
00:38:16.666 - 00:38:17.890, Speaker A: Yeah, they enjoyed it.
00:38:17.922 - 00:38:18.586, Speaker C: Yeah, of course.
00:38:18.690 - 00:38:20.162, Speaker A: Did you. Do you have any rare pepes?
00:38:20.298 - 00:38:22.654, Speaker C: I don't. I mined prime coin, though.
00:38:23.034 - 00:38:23.786, Speaker A: Claim to fame.
00:38:23.850 - 00:38:34.002, Speaker C: Yeah. I mined a whole block of prime coin. First day it came out, prime coin was doing something. This is before I understood proof of work as well as I do now. But I was like, oh, it's doing something useful. Signing prime numbers.
00:38:34.098 - 00:38:34.722, Speaker A: Yeah, right.
00:38:34.818 - 00:38:35.242, Speaker C: Silly.
00:38:35.298 - 00:38:54.206, Speaker A: But I did like that idea, though. Prime numbers are a fascinating topic. We won't get into anymore because I know we're short on time, but what do you see in the future? What are you doing now? You were at Kraken for a long time, obviously, but you're not at Kraken anymore. What are you doing now? And what do you think for the next near medium term? What does bitcoin look like for you?
00:38:54.290 - 00:39:09.514, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, left Kraken after three years there. Kraken's a great company. Loved the team, loved the leadership left there. Wanted to, you know, I've done quite a few things almost in over a decade. I'm an old. I'm an old man in crypto years. So.
00:39:09.514 - 00:39:16.566, Speaker C: Block explorer, web wallet, mobile price tracker, app, tax software, micropayments.
00:39:16.630 - 00:39:18.142, Speaker A: I remember the tax software. I forgot about.
00:39:18.198 - 00:39:19.094, Speaker C: Yeah. Interchange.
00:39:19.174 - 00:39:22.150, Speaker A: Interchange. I forgot about that. I know you and Matt, right?
00:39:22.222 - 00:39:23.020, Speaker C: Yeah. Matt Gallagher.
00:39:23.062 - 00:39:23.992, Speaker A: Yeah, that was it.
00:39:24.048 - 00:39:24.704, Speaker C: Clark Moody.
00:39:24.824 - 00:39:30.672, Speaker A: That's when we talked with you when I was back at Avon. And then it was like there was an acquisition. Right.
00:39:30.688 - 00:39:31.872, Speaker C: Or something like, we got Bob at Kraken.
00:39:31.928 - 00:39:33.264, Speaker A: Right. And that's how you ended up at Kraken.
00:39:33.304 - 00:39:48.484, Speaker C: That's right. Got it. I've done a lot of different things. Kraken exchange, brokerage options. They got all sorts of stuff. OTC desk. So I've kind of touched on a lot of different products in the space, and so the Defi world is something I haven't touched on as much.
00:39:48.484 - 00:39:55.688, Speaker C: That's where trust machines is building a suite of applications on top of bitcoin. Kind of like a consensus for bitcoin. The Ethereum consensus.
00:39:55.776 - 00:39:56.136, Speaker A: Yep.
00:39:56.200 - 00:40:07.768, Speaker C: So they raised 150 million. They've got an exceptional team. So I came in and helped them build out their marketing team. So help them build out the marketing team. Strategy, execution. So I'm sort of like the fractional vp of marketing over there.
00:40:07.816 - 00:40:08.448, Speaker A: Got it.
00:40:08.576 - 00:40:11.552, Speaker C: That's super fun. Love the team. We just had an event last night. You were at.
00:40:11.608 - 00:40:14.216, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I did. It was at the great, great pub key.
00:40:14.280 - 00:40:15.048, Speaker C: The pub key.
00:40:15.176 - 00:40:17.792, Speaker A: 85 Washington place, my favorite bar in New York.
00:40:17.848 - 00:40:31.290, Speaker C: Yep. That was. That was super fun. It's a great team. We've got a couple different products that we're building, and then as well, I do other fractional vp of marketing work. Another one is the wizards. Tap wizards.
00:40:31.290 - 00:40:36.014, Speaker C: Yeah. This isn't super well known yet, but I'm starting to tell more people. I'm working on the Wizards project.
00:40:36.874 - 00:40:41.482, Speaker A: I really have to say I like the wizard projects where we had Udi wartimer on the podcast.
00:40:41.538 - 00:40:45.054, Speaker C: I was just drawn into it. Well, I just. It was hard to resist.
00:40:45.474 - 00:40:55.306, Speaker A: A lot of people are critical of Ud. They think he's some kind of anti bitcoiner at this point. It's just not true. Like, I've talked to him a lot, and, like, it's. Look at the Tapper Wizards project. You know, how you. How you interact with.
00:40:55.306 - 00:41:00.202, Speaker A: And they haven't expressly said that how an airdrop or something might one day happen. Because they've minted all the wizards.
00:41:00.298 - 00:41:00.570, Speaker C: Yep.
00:41:00.602 - 00:41:08.218, Speaker A: But they haven't been distributed. They're not for sale yet. But you have to complete the wizard quests. And what, what are those? I mean, aside from the funny shower.
00:41:08.346 - 00:41:09.146, Speaker C: Yeah, that was you.
00:41:09.170 - 00:41:09.426, Speaker A: You.
00:41:09.490 - 00:41:10.194, Speaker C: We wanted that.
00:41:10.234 - 00:41:11.290, Speaker A: It's all bitcoin activity.
00:41:11.362 - 00:41:17.378, Speaker C: It was a way to have a fair standard for whitelisting. Normally whitelists are a bunch of insider. Sort of like.
00:41:17.426 - 00:41:20.026, Speaker A: Yeah. Or at best, it's like you clicked the form first.
00:41:20.090 - 00:41:20.266, Speaker C: Right.
00:41:20.290 - 00:41:20.754, Speaker A: I mean, it's just.
00:41:20.794 - 00:41:21.090, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:41:21.122 - 00:41:21.866, Speaker A: Yeah. You heard of it?
00:41:21.930 - 00:41:22.834, Speaker C: This is proof of work.
00:41:22.914 - 00:41:23.226, Speaker A: It is.
00:41:23.250 - 00:41:26.946, Speaker C: You had to get in a shower and take a, take a shower. It's pretty awkward.
00:41:26.970 - 00:41:31.138, Speaker A: But also complete a lightning transaction and a bunch of other bitcoin specific stuff.
00:41:31.306 - 00:41:32.394, Speaker C: You had to donate to HRs.
00:41:32.434 - 00:41:37.038, Speaker A: You're teaching people how to use bitcoin. You had to donate bitcoin to the Human Rights foundation using lightning.
00:41:37.146 - 00:41:37.462, Speaker C: Yes.
00:41:37.518 - 00:41:41.598, Speaker A: You're teaching people how to use bitcoins. I just don't know how people can really be that critical of this.
00:41:41.686 - 00:41:42.038, Speaker C: I know.
00:41:42.086 - 00:41:45.126, Speaker A: And by the way, most of the smart people I know are not critical of it.
00:41:45.150 - 00:41:45.334, Speaker C: Right.
00:41:45.374 - 00:41:46.990, Speaker A: Clear. Because it's awesome.
00:41:47.142 - 00:41:51.198, Speaker C: And the wizards go back to an early 2013 meme, the, our bitcoin sub back.
00:41:51.286 - 00:41:51.486, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:51.510 - 00:41:56.350, Speaker C: Because it was the forums and the subreddit and then Twitter. Twitter wasn't really a thing like bitcoin.
00:41:56.382 - 00:41:58.254, Speaker A: Twitter was like 2015 or so.
00:41:58.374 - 00:41:59.902, Speaker C: It was. It was a lot. Yeah, it was late.
00:41:59.998 - 00:42:04.394, Speaker A: Yeah, it was. And even now, I don't know, that's. We'll save this for a different conversation.
00:42:04.774 - 00:42:08.998, Speaker C: But, yeah, I think Udi, you know, he likes to poke the bear a little bit.
00:42:09.126 - 00:42:13.934, Speaker A: He's a troll by nature, as a human. It's not an act. He is that way.
00:42:13.974 - 00:42:46.654, Speaker C: Yeah, he is that way. Him and Eric are the two main guys behind the project. They're both a little trolley like that. I think their roles are very important in crypto for bitcoin and ethereum communities because they'll poke both sides, and I think they do a good job of doing that because you need someone to challenge the status quo. I think Udi, a lot of bitcoiners don't like him just because he brings up uncomfortable conversations that they don't want to have. And I think he revels a little too much in the poking the bear thing. So he gets a lot of heat, but he creates the heat that he gets.
00:42:46.654 - 00:43:04.054, Speaker C: Wizards, I think they're going to be the punks. Or apes of bitcoin. It's memetically the most cogent, I think, project in the space because it ties back to this original meme. It's just fun. It's hard to describe it. It's super silly.
00:43:04.354 - 00:43:05.104, Speaker A: I agree.
00:43:05.234 - 00:43:08.188, Speaker C: You know, we're having an event tomorrow and New York.
00:43:08.236 - 00:43:08.492, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:08.548 - 00:43:25.260, Speaker C: Yeah. And so I was working with them. I'm like, how silly could we make a certain thing, like, whether it be lighting setup or something else, we're like, we're like, actually, if we did it shittier, it'd be funnier because if we do it too well, it looks too polished.
00:43:25.332 - 00:43:25.868, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:25.996 - 00:43:33.572, Speaker C: And that's not what we're about. It's just the wizard itself. For those who haven't seen it, it's like an MS paint sort of drawing.
00:43:33.748 - 00:43:37.308, Speaker A: I do like. By the way, there's 2121 of them.
00:43:37.316 - 00:43:37.516, Speaker C: That's right.
00:43:37.540 - 00:43:38.348, Speaker A: 21. 21.
00:43:38.436 - 00:43:39.228, Speaker C: They're beautiful.
00:43:39.356 - 00:43:51.860, Speaker A: Yeah. Once you start getting out of the original ones that look really iconic, classic for that meme, the sort of generative, the different colors and stuff, it's actually pretty funny and pretty cool.
00:43:51.932 - 00:43:53.140, Speaker C: The PFP ones are super cool.
00:43:53.172 - 00:43:54.004, Speaker A: That's what I mean. Yeah.
00:43:54.124 - 00:44:00.512, Speaker C: We started to add texture to them. The Arthur Hayes one is actually my favorite. Arthur Hayes has a badass one that's like gold.
