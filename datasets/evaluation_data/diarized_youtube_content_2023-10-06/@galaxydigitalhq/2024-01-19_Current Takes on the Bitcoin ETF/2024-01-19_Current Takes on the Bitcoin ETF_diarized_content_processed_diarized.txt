00:00:00.240 - 00:00:04.974, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:05.094 - 00:00:06.142, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:06.278 - 00:00:22.314, Speaker A: It's been an exciting week. When we recorded last week, we recorded right after the bitcoin ETF's were approved. Yep. But now we're recording on Wednesday, and they've traded for three full trading days. Thursday, Friday, Tuesday. Monday was a holiday in the United States. The markets were closed.
00:00:22.314 - 00:00:27.274, Speaker A: Let's get right to it. I mean, what are your takes so far on the ETF complex?
00:00:27.614 - 00:00:55.846, Speaker B: I think the total flows into the product are anemic at this point. I think the figures are, as of yesterday, there was $800 million of net inflows into the ETF's, of which grayscale had 1.8 yards that were outflows. And I think a lot of the inflows of the net inflows were a function of people just exchanging bitcoin or.
00:00:55.870 - 00:00:56.674, Speaker A: Some other.
00:00:57.054 - 00:00:58.654, Speaker B: Bitcoin related exposure.
