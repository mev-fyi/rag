This was a little bit of news to me, but this was the sentiment that I was getting from the conversation and the call that developers are just very, very excited about peer das in comparison to these other code changes that have already been included in Pectra. So let's talk a little bit about peer das and what that code change entails. Let's go back to the den kun upgrade, which is the the latest upgrade that Ethereum developers have activated, and the primary code change that went into Dancun was EIP 4844. It introduced a new transaction type to Ethereum blobs. And this transaction type is ephemeral. It stores data, arbitrary data objects, and it stores them temporarily on the consensus layer of Ethereum.
