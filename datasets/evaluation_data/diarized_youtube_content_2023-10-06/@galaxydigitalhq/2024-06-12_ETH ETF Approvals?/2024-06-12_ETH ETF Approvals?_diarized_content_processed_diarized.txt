00:00:00.320 - 00:00:41.044, Speaker A: When we think about the bitcoin process, when issuers would make new filings to the SEC, it typically took about two weeks for the SEC to send comments back to the issuers. So if a bunch or any or all of the s one s that are sent into the SEC today are perfect and require no edits, you would think maybe within two weeks they could launch. There's a variety of views on this. I think it will be longer than that, but maybe more like weeks to months. But I don't think six months. I think it seems like they're moving quickly now. So I think it's reasonable to think in a month or month and a half you might see these actually start trading.
