Like the excess balances from the pandemic have started to get eaten into. You've seen a pickup in credit card default rates and stuff, and a lot of the soft data indicators.
00:00:21.998 - 00:00:39.556, Speaker B: Yeah, I saw somebody saying that online. I don't wanna say the platforms, but the big online ad sellers, so the big tech companies, the search engine giants that do this, are laying off huge swaths of their ad teams and that this has also historically been a leading indicator of like a downturn in the economy. Ad spending.
00:00:39.700 - 00:00:57.124, Speaker A: No, no. Lots of things like that that are saying you're headed towards a slowdown. And so basically the Fed's being like, rates are probably too restrictive in the context of what we're seeing in the future. Like, on a forward indicator basis.
00:00:57.204 - 00:00:57.884, Speaker B: Slow down. Yes.
