00:00:00.120 - 00:00:11.094, Speaker A: There are some really interesting developments. I think inscriptions and ordinals are quite interesting. I think generally there's this thing, bitvm. Have you seen this thing? Quite interesting. Again, a discovery. Effectively a discovery. Wait a second.
00:00:11.094 - 00:00:32.614, Speaker A: We can do much more robust scripting right now, right? People are figuring out how to use it, but it's not, doesn't require any upgrade. And there's like enhanced, I would say, this year, interest in new layers, new types of layer, two networks, several teams building sovereign roll ups that will sort of have similar functionality to the roll ups in the Ethereum world on bitcoin.
00:00:32.734 - 00:00:47.086, Speaker B: So, I mean, how I approach this personally and how we approach as a company is we're bitcoiners. Like, I genuinely don't hold anything else but bitcoin. Um, not, not because I. Not really because I don't want to. It's just the thing I understand the most. I don't understand synthetic assets. I don't come from finance.
00:00:47.086 - 00:00:54.854, Speaker B: Bitcoin. I have no questions about bitcoin. It makes it make sense to me. I'm comfortable. I'm comfortable leveraging that and putting like my entire life into it, effectively.
