00:00:03.400 - 00:01:06.192, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brands, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. Everybody buys bitcoin at the price they deserve, yo, I'm slippin these nerves when I'm trippin these nerds? I'm flippin these birds, sendin signals inverse? I'm Rappin in the office, yellin let me cook? Keep it clean, opponents keep a messy book? You wanna test me? Look, I leave hater shook and devastated while I levitate? I'm the queen of all you rooks? We walk in the sun, forget the town, we paint the forest boring? Write it down like David Morris? And I'm always winning? Never have to ask me what the score is? Every track, I serve it back like my raps are seeding torrents? Pick your poison, yo, and I will bring the noise, spitting it with poise when I'm ripping with the boys? Not indifferent to the ploys of the haters who battle me, but my crew is stronger than the forces in the galaxy. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmware, researcher, Galaxy Digital. Thank you for listening to Galaxy brains. We have a great show for you today. As I said, David Z. Morris is our guest, former longtime columnist for Coindesk, writer at protos and flesh markets.
00:01:06.192 - 00:01:44.764, Speaker A: He was in the room for the entirety of the Sam Bankman freed trial, and as we know, SBF was found guilty on all counts. We're gonna talk with David at length about his impressions from the trial, the things that really stood out to him, and a whole bunch of other interesting topics. This guy has been covering bitcoin and crypto for ten years, so we're gonna go around the horn with him on all of it. Of course. We'll check in with our good friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading, as always, to talk markets. And before we get to all, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to the disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information contained in this podcast represents investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities.

00:01:44.764 - 00:01:53.032, Speaker A: I liked it. Finn. So, SBF, guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.
00:01:53.032 - 00:01:54.744, Speaker A: Guilty. Seven counts.
00:01:54.904 - 00:01:55.844, Speaker B: Resolution.
00:01:56.384 - 00:01:57.944, Speaker A: It feels like the end of an era.
00:01:58.024 - 00:02:01.744, Speaker B: Does this feel like the trial of the century for this community, you know?
00:02:01.824 - 00:02:16.426, Speaker A: Yeah, it definitely does. And I think was. But, you know, apparently, very little question in the jury's mind about whether he was guilty. They deliberated for less than 4 hours before convicting him on all counts.
00:02:16.450 - 00:02:20.994, Speaker B: I mean, yeah, it seems like there was no doubt.
00:02:21.154 - 00:02:25.786, Speaker C: Seems like there was probably no doubt from the beginning, middle and end.
00:02:25.970 - 00:02:30.642, Speaker B: Seems very unsurprising, yet still quite jarring in a lot of ways.
00:02:30.738 - 00:02:32.538, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a big sentence.
00:02:32.626 - 00:02:36.594, Speaker A: It's a, well, we don't know the sentence yet, but it's a lot of conviction. It could be a massive sentence.
00:02:36.634 - 00:02:37.706, Speaker B: A lot of conviction.
00:02:37.850 - 00:02:42.562, Speaker A: Technically, if he gets the max on every charge, we're talking about 110 years.
00:02:42.618 - 00:02:45.098, Speaker B: Certainly unprecedented in crypto.
00:02:45.146 - 00:02:46.082, Speaker A: This is the biggest one.
00:02:46.178 - 00:02:47.498, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, absolutely.
00:02:47.586 - 00:03:03.242, Speaker A: And so the sentencing won't happen, I guess, until March 28. So we've got a while. Did you know this guy could have stayed out of jail if he hadn't tampered with witnesses? He'd actually be at home right now before sentencing if he hadn't leaked stuff to the press about Caroline Ellison and others.
00:03:03.298 - 00:03:10.304, Speaker B: It's just wild think about, but it's wild to follow. He was a unique character before the.
00:03:10.344 - 00:03:11.684, Speaker C: Crash, but.
00:03:13.504 - 00:03:15.136, Speaker B: It'S fascinating in a lot of ways.
00:03:15.200 - 00:03:33.736, Speaker A: Stunning story, and we haven't covered it that much except for some of our chit chat. But David Z. Morris, our guest, he covered it extensively, was in the room the whole time. So it's a great interview coming up, but let's go to Bimnett and get the show started. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brainstorm.
00:03:33.736 - 00:03:34.908, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:03:34.996 - 00:03:42.308, Speaker A: Love having you on. And you were just priming me with, there's a structural shift happening in macro. What is happening?
00:03:42.396 - 00:04:41.862, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, well, basically the fed during the last FOMC meeting, I think, told you that they're done hiking rates. And they're done hiking rates because, one, they're worried about the risks of continuing to hike and the kind of financial stability concerns which we talked about with that. But more importantly, we're seeing softening in the data, whether it's employment inflation, some of the sentiment surveys, and not only domestically, but abroad as well. You've got Europe slowing down pretty aggressively now, China continuing to slow down. We have a chinese inflation print tonight that is most likely going to be a little soft. You know, if you think about, like oil as a barometer for, you know, global growth and sort of, you know, the industrial complex, et cetera, it's starting to trade incredibly weak right now. We're at $76 a barrel on WTI crude.
00:04:41.862 - 00:04:47.774, Speaker C: Brent just broke $80 a barrel. Doesn't seem like an economy, a global economy that's about to rip and have.
00:04:47.814 - 00:04:51.674, Speaker A: Crazy inflation or the seven handle 70 handle on 70.
00:04:52.054 - 00:04:56.462, Speaker C: Correct. And this is with a whole geopolitical situation happening in the Middle east.
00:04:56.518 - 00:05:00.660, Speaker A: And you think that's, is that driven by like declining production and stuff? Is that the issue?
00:05:00.692 - 00:05:04.604, Speaker C: Is that probably mainly a function of declining demand?
00:05:04.684 - 00:05:11.284, Speaker A: That's what I mean. Right. Declining demand. So I don't mean production of oil, I mean of other stuff in the economy needs oil. So declining demand.
00:05:11.324 - 00:05:17.100, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, you have like the SPR bid level that is around here.
00:05:17.172 - 00:05:20.716, Speaker A: Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt, though. WTI was one of the examples.
00:05:20.820 - 00:05:55.894, Speaker C: It's just a market indicator right now telling you that stuff is soft. And what you've had happen in fixed income is a broad route, including the backend. You've had a flattening of the yield curve. So you got a double whammy with supply from treasury refunding last week. But rates are starting to rally in the front end. In the back end, you're starting to price in more cut activity, the wages side of things, even though you have UAW, et cetera. I think the three month run rate on wage growth in the US is sub 3%.
00:05:55.894 - 00:06:51.868, Speaker C: Right. And so you're just in a situation where it looks like your goals of tame inflation and full employment is kind of like within reach and you have some financial stability concerns as well. And so it kind of seems like you're getting a huge sea shift in terms of how market participants are thinking about central bankers, their response functions, and the upcoming data as well. I think a lot of the forecasters and researchers that I've been talking to, they're expecting a continuation of the slowdown. If you look at things like credit card spending data, the delinquencies are going up for the most sensitive groups. Same thing with the auto stuff as well. If you think about it, somebody gets into a leverage loop where they have a high credit card balance that they can't really service and high interest rates.
00:06:51.868 - 00:07:39.330, Speaker C: And so you're starting to see that kind of part of the economy or that sort of segment of the population start to really feel pain. And so that's going to lead to slow down in spending. And there's a whole crisis in freight happening right now, tons of trucking companies doing layoffs and stuff that's impacting all sorts of things from banking to people's jobs, et cetera. And so there's just lots of anecdotal bits and pieces of evidence that suggest that the weakness is going to continue and perhaps even accelerate. The counter to that is as rates move lower, people are going to want to buy homes again and stuff. And you've actually seen that. So the 30 year mortgage rate this week dropped 25 basis points.
00:07:39.330 - 00:08:08.876, Speaker C: So the largest drop we've had in like three months. But you know what happened? A subsequent increase in mortgage applications, the highest we've had since June. And so there's like a push pull of like, you know, when people start to overreact to some of this, you know, softening data and rates start to drop further. That is stimulative. And that does cause, like, things to come back. So it's gotta be kind of like a swing of sorts, you know, back and forth, back and forth. But high level.
00:08:08.876 - 00:08:12.484, Speaker C: It seems like we're making good progress on prices.
00:08:12.564 - 00:08:16.740, Speaker A: Last week, did they not, was there not a hire for longer? Were they talking tough?
00:08:16.852 - 00:08:22.596, Speaker C: But they weren't. They want it all. They're just like, it's really tough.
00:08:22.620 - 00:08:27.756, Speaker A: So you think it probably isn't higher for longer right now? No, it is staying higher.
00:08:27.860 - 00:08:29.444, Speaker C: It is higher for longer, but raise.
00:08:29.484 - 00:08:31.340, Speaker A: Even higher from here at the moment.
00:08:31.372 - 00:08:41.389, Speaker C: Correct. The idea that they would go again after this in my head is done. And in FOMC pricing, I think the Jan meeting has another four basis points.
00:08:41.421 - 00:08:48.589, Speaker A: Of hikes, which is basically not a hike. Right. Yeah. And then I saw, I think now the market is pricing what in by the spring is cuts.
00:08:48.661 - 00:08:52.869, Speaker C: Yeah. 100 basis points by expectation. FOMC meeting next year.
00:08:52.901 - 00:08:53.269, Speaker B: Next year.
00:08:53.301 - 00:09:02.893, Speaker C: So, yeah, so there's a lot of cuts. But when you think about where we're coming from, like we're 525 to 550, like cutting 100 basis points, you're still pretty high. You're still pretty high.
00:09:02.933 - 00:09:03.133, Speaker B: Right.
00:09:03.173 - 00:09:06.341, Speaker A: Which is what the Fed wants in the state that is higher for longer.
00:09:06.397 - 00:09:31.534, Speaker C: Correct. But there are some other things. I mean, you're starting to see more commercial real estate deals go through and those valuations and those marks start to feed through. There's just a lot of things that could potentially go wrong as well. And so I think path of least resistance is now lower in terms of yields. That should be constructive for risk assets and things like bitcoin.
00:09:31.614 - 00:10:03.726, Speaker A: Yeah, it's been an interesting ride with bitcoin. We've basically been in the range since the, actually we've straight mostly bled higher. We're pretty firmly now in the high 34s or even the mid 35s since the gamma squeeze we talked about now two or even three weeks ago. I'm forgetting, I think maybe two weeks ago. It's just been higher lows the whole time. But still struggling to break above 36. Do we have another leg higher in us before ETF announcement?
00:10:03.830 - 00:10:32.044, Speaker C: This kind of price action tells you that there are dip buyers. This kind of price action tells you that the pain trade is higher. I don't think there's been participation from the hedge fund community in a meaningful way. And most folks are under allocated. Even the crypto native folks that you talk to that are crazy bullish. All the people that I'm in chats with and communicating with, nobody has had this on, like, oh, I'm gung ho crazy bullish bitcoin. I'm going to max allocate to it.
00:10:32.044 - 00:11:16.474, Speaker C: And the issue is everybody gets benchmarked to it, right? It's the most liquid thing in crypto, and it's up over 110% with a great sharp. And it's got further upside because there's an impending catalyst. And so everybody that has this tool in their toolkit, from a macro standpoint, from a crypto standpoint, is just looking at this and is underperforming this thing. Every ticket goes higher. And so that's why this thing has like such a strong bid on dips. And secondly, like, this is an asset whose value is determined by where people are willing to transact it. There's sellers for miners, et cetera.
00:11:16.474 - 00:11:43.702, Speaker C: But high level, when something gets to a value point or critical mass in terms of ideas, bitcoin's value is now 35,000 to tons of people that trade money around. And the market makers determine where prices are set at the margin and stuff. But once something has value, right, it's tough to take that away. And God forbid we're back in a bull market and these equities and stuff. And so people are feeling good about owning risk assets.
00:11:43.758 - 00:11:49.114, Speaker A: Yeah, it feels like you combine it with the changing in the rates, environment, you got a bitcoin halving next year.
00:11:49.614 - 00:11:50.454, Speaker C: It's like the perfect.
00:11:50.494 - 00:11:57.422, Speaker A: You've got the catalysts which could cause inflows and not enough people own it. It does. It feels strong right now.
00:11:57.558 - 00:12:01.058, Speaker C: It feels strong and normally stronger, stronger.
00:12:01.166 - 00:12:04.266, Speaker A: Than it basically has since we started this podcast.
00:12:04.370 - 00:12:36.772, Speaker C: Well, this is what we've talked about. There's a convexity to the thought. And so once you get to that critical mass, it just starts to feed on itself. The positive price action is a positive feedback loop into the asset itself. Because your thesis gets rationalized, you're like, oh my God, this is actually working. Getting validated brings other people in. And so we, you know, we've talked about this, and so that's kind of, I think, where you're at, and it's a wonderful place to be.
00:12:36.772 - 00:13:11.470, Speaker C: And normally, like, when you feel really great about something and, like, it's gone your way, you're supposed to sell something, you know, like take profits, et cetera. But, like, clearly everybody that's felt good about this thing took some profit. And all of a sudden, it's like, all those profits that you took, like, you're underwater on them. And so this is what happens when an asset performs so well, especially late into the year, where you have, like, performance coming up, right? That's like you're a hedge fund manager, you're a venture guy, you're a crypto business. Anything in crypto gets benchmarked to this. So it just gets tough and every.
00:13:11.502 - 00:13:41.178, Speaker A: Tick higher is, remember last year we saw, we ended the year bleakly, right? FTX collapsed, like, mid or early November. We bled down all the way down. I think we started 23 at about 16, five. But that also helped because then it was everyone saying, oh, base effect, fresh performance, base effect, low base. And we lifted off through March after around the SVB collapse, we hit 30k. So it almost doubled in a couple months.
00:13:41.226 - 00:13:42.482, Speaker B: Earlier this year, God forbid we had.
00:13:42.498 - 00:13:44.826, Speaker C: The ETF when we had the banking crisis.
00:13:45.010 - 00:13:52.394, Speaker A: I mean, you talk about money flying out of the banks, going into money market funds. A lot of it would have ended up in a bitcoin ETF. I think that's.
00:13:52.434 - 00:13:54.394, Speaker C: I think a ton. Yeah, a ton of.
00:13:54.474 - 00:14:03.170, Speaker A: It's gonna be an exciting time. I'm happy we've got bimnet Abibi here to talk with us about it. And of course, we'll continue to talk about it. Bim net.
00:14:03.202 - 00:14:06.162, Speaker C: Absolutely. One of these days, I'd like to go off on just the BoJ.
00:14:06.258 - 00:14:11.130, Speaker A: Okay, we'll do a Bank of Japan episode. Bimb from Galaxy trading, my friend. Thank you so much.
00:14:11.242 - 00:14:12.214, Speaker C: Have a good one.
00:14:13.634 - 00:14:26.318, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, David Z. Morris, longtime writer about crypto and bitcoin, currently writing at flesh markets. Check him out on Substack. Also longtime former columnist at Coindesk. David, thank you so much for coming on Galaxy brains.
00:14:26.406 - 00:14:30.854, Speaker B: I am super stoked to be here. Alex, thank you for inviting me. And, yeah, we've got some fun stuff to talk about.
00:14:30.894 - 00:14:43.902, Speaker A: We do. So we're going. We're going to get into it a lot about the Sam Bankman free trial, because David was in the courtroom for the duration of the trial covering it. He's writing about it. He's been writing about it. I saw this morning, or I guess maybe it was. I saw the tweet this morning.
00:14:43.902 - 00:15:07.532, Speaker A: I think last night you tweeted that you may even write a book about it. Excited to see that. David's one of my favorite writers in crypto. We're also going to go back and ask David some questions about stuff he wrote as far long ago as ten years ago. But before we do that, David, maybe introduce yourself to our audience if they don't know, what are you doing now at flesh markets? What is that? And a little bit of your story. And when did you get into bitcoin and crypto?
00:15:07.628 - 00:15:24.644, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. So I have been writing about crypto for more than a decade now. Like, I wrote my first piece for fortune about bitcoin and, like, early, early 20. Well, wait, maybe it's not more than a decade, early 2014. So we're, like, coming up on exactly a decade when I was working on those pieces.
00:15:24.644 - 00:15:53.552, Speaker B: But yeah, I've been doing it for a long time. I unfortunately was laid off from Coindesk recently. The joke that I've made so many times, it's no longer funny, is that there should be something equivalent to a purple heart for journalists who lose their jobs after destroying the company that they worked for. And before that, I was at fortune for a little while. I wrote for a startup magazine called Breaker, if anybody remembers. That was like one of the first crypto focused publications. So anyway, long story there.
00:15:53.552 - 00:16:21.540, Speaker B: And right now I just got through writing about the trial for protos. So a lot of my work is at protos now. I will probably continue having some role there and just kind of like picking things up here and there. And yes, working on a book. I'm very close, I think, to having a deal with a publisher that I'm really excited about. So we'll have some updates there. And I will actually also be, I'll show hard here.
00:16:21.540 - 00:16:26.684, Speaker B: I'm gonna be selling some nfts to help fund the work on that book. So keep an eye out there.
00:16:26.804 - 00:16:27.444, Speaker A: Very cool.
00:16:27.524 - 00:16:37.188, Speaker B: And there will be sketches of the trial of Sam from inside the courthouse that you did. That I did. So they're gonna be exciting. I think people have enjoyed that work so far, too.
00:16:37.236 - 00:17:06.392, Speaker A: I love that. So let's get into the trial, because I think like many of our listeners, I was observing from the sidelines, following, like, inner City Press's transcript and whatnot, reading, obviously tons of people, including your work on it, but we weren't in the room. And I really want to ask some stuff about, like what it was like, at different points in the trial. Just broadly, though, what is your take on Sam's conviction? You know, what does it mean for the crypto ecosystem, if anything?
00:17:06.568 - 00:17:35.888, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I don't. I think it's. We were talking a little bit about Nick Carter, and I think that his take is the best, which is that this is just like clearing the decks, getting all the bad actors out of the space, hopefully learning a few things, but God knows we never learn. And then I think that we've seen the market obviously kind of behaving as if that's what's going on, that there's clearing out. We're getting this stuff taken care of.
00:17:35.936 - 00:17:37.696, Speaker A: Maturity coming back.
00:17:37.760 - 00:18:18.334, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think that the more interesting questions, though, are not so much for crypto as, like, Sam himself embodies so many things about just the way financial markets work, the way venture capital works, things that ultimately the case is not about crypto, and his crimes are not about crypto. And I think that that is really the most important takeaway here. He's a fascinating character, and all of his connections, his family situation, the effective altruism thing, it's all so fascinating. And crypto is at the center of it, but also kind of not really crucial. So it's really just an amazing story, whether you care about crypto or not.
00:18:18.374 - 00:18:36.658, Speaker A: Yeah. He didn't even really like crypto that much. If you watch that Eric Voorhees interview that he did, basically right before the collapse, it's clear he doesn't really share any of the underlying foundational values of decentralization or self sovereignty. And he said himself.
00:18:36.746 - 00:18:37.018, Speaker B: Right.
00:18:37.066 - 00:18:41.778, Speaker A: He got into it. Cause it was interesting to trade. Right. He's not a. Yeah.
00:18:41.866 - 00:19:05.588, Speaker B: And you saw all kinds of manifestations of that. But I think that the most important one is, if you look at the Michael Lewis book, which is a way bigger topic that we probably don't have time to get into right now. But the title is going infinite. Right. Because Sam thought he could basically make infinite money. He said that. And obviously, there's the bitcoin maximalist perspective where, like, maybe there's some scenario there.
00:19:05.786 - 00:19:07.032, Speaker A: You mean, like hyper bitcoinization?
00:19:07.088 - 00:19:14.864, Speaker B: Hyper bitcoinization, something like that. But, I mean, if you have a grounded view of crypto, like, this is not an infinitely huge market, even at maximum.
00:19:14.904 - 00:19:15.128, Speaker A: Right.
00:19:15.176 - 00:19:35.264, Speaker B: Like, there are specific applications. We got to keep our heads on the ground. Like, there are. There's real stuff here, but that reality means it's limited as long as you're living in this world of fantasy. Yes, it can be infinite, right? But that's all Sam had in his head, is, like, I have this vague sense that, like, there's infinite money, and he didn't understand the basics, but then he went to the top level.
00:19:35.304 - 00:20:07.056, Speaker A: So do you think, like, what's your just impression of Sam in general? Like, is he a villain? Is he naive? Like, was it. Cause I honestly, I still haven't decided. I mean, I know that they very quickly convinced the jury that he obviously was a criminal. I don't think many people dispute that. But, like, was this more naive hubris, or was it like, you know, evil strategy? Like, you know what I mean? Is he truly a villain, or is he sort of a sad case of his environment? You know what I mean?
00:20:07.080 - 00:20:47.402, Speaker B: I mean, it's a complicated story because I think there are a bunch of inputs here. I think that one thing that's clear, one thing that became clear during the trial that wasn't necessarily totally clear beforehand is I think Sam is a sociopath. I think he does not fundamentally care about other human beings. I think he has, like, a neurological situation. But you add to that things like, he was brought up in this household where he was taught that everything could be explained rationally and calculated. And then he got into the effective altruism world, where, again, calculation, predicting the future.
00:20:47.458 - 00:20:58.714, Speaker A: They basically say almost anything is justified. It's a classic John Stuart Mill utilitarianism thing, right? If the benefit outweighs the cost, it's positive. Basically. It doesn't really matter.
00:20:58.834 - 00:21:38.880, Speaker B: And that makes it, you know, as Carolyn Ellison told in testimony, Sam did not believe that there was any rationalization from moral rules like don't lie and don't steal. So his particular brain, combined with these lessons that he was learning, led to what happened. And he. The other sort of the more grounded version of this that wasn't clear is, I think a lot of people in crypto going in thought that Gary, Nashad, Carolyn and Sam were like, you know, the gang of four operating, stealing. But it turns out, really, that Sam was basically bullying and manipulating the other four people. Or at least that's the image that came across during the trial. So I think that's.
00:21:38.880 - 00:21:43.184, Speaker B: He's. I think he is a villain. I think he is a villain, right?
00:21:43.224 - 00:21:52.520, Speaker A: So, like, the sociopathic nature and stuff, you're right. It did feel like, I mean, if we believe the testimony from Gary and Nishad, and who's the other guy? Adam.
00:21:52.672 - 00:21:53.440, Speaker B: Adam Yadidia.
00:21:53.472 - 00:21:54.040, Speaker A: Adam Yadidia.
00:21:54.072 - 00:21:55.892, Speaker B: Not one of the charged people, right?
00:21:56.028 - 00:22:16.836, Speaker A: They, although paint a similar picture of, like. I mean, he was just pulling all the strings, basically. I mean, even Caroline sending him the seven balance sheets and him saying, you know what? Pick the 7th one. That has no reference to the whole. It does paint a picture that he was at the center of it all and that actually, they didn't really know what was good. And then, though. Then he tries to.
00:22:16.836 - 00:22:21.484, Speaker A: Okay, let me. I was gonna say, then he tries to argue. He didn't know. Oh, I wasn't looking at that. No one told me.
00:22:21.604 - 00:22:22.264, Speaker B: Right.
00:22:22.684 - 00:22:51.222, Speaker A: Let's talk about some specific instances in the trial. You mentioned Caroline. I mean, they, by both their testimony and by reporting, had dated and obviously had a relationship. She was the CEO of Alameda, so they had a business relationship. She was on the stand. I thought this was probably the. Well, until we got the cross of Sam's own testimony, I thought that was the most compelling and interesting moment to me.
00:22:51.222 - 00:22:56.406, Speaker A: Again, reading it, what was it like to you when she testified? What were your takeaways in general from that?
00:22:56.550 - 00:24:08.774, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that sort of, to add on to my previous point, I think that what became clear during her testimony is that she was, you know, bottom line, in love with Sam Bankman fried, which is crazy to think about, but nonetheless seems to have been the case, and really, like, did what he wanted at every turn until the whole thing fell apart. And she didn't cry uncontrollably, but she lost her composure a couple times on the stand, and it was in the context of saying, I felt so relieved when it was all over, even though it was a disaster, because basically, she had felt trapped into perpetuating these lies, and it was convincing. The point is that you're sitting there listening to this person say something, and what matters is their credibility. Right. And she seemed extremely credible in explaining this, that, like, she had felt, you know, she was a junior trader, basically, and then got bumped up into the CEO role, did not get a raise, did not get equity, but was basically, I think, made into a fall guy late in the game. And I think that was the takeaway from her testimony.
00:24:09.154 - 00:24:35.860, Speaker A: Let's talk about the cross. So, Sam, first of all, let's talk about Sam testifying. We joked, phineas and I, a couple episodes ago, about, like, I think I said, things aren't going too good for him like this. It seems like he needs a Hail Mary. Like, typically, you would always advise your clients, lawyers basically, universally, typically advise their clients not to testify on their own defense, partly cause of what can happen on cross. What do you make of his. Why did he testify first in your mind?
00:24:36.012 - 00:25:15.202, Speaker B: I think that my thinking on this has evolved because I think that for a long time, I was just like, he's delusional. He thinks he's innocent. His parents, I think, genuinely are probably still delusional and think he's innocent. But the other aspect that we kind of figured out and that I figured out from talking to legal experts over the course of the trial is that the math of his sentencing is so brutal. He ripped off so many people that according to federal sentencing guidelines, he very easily could get life in prison. And it's very possible that there was no possible upside for him to do a plea deal. Like, he might have not gotten anything out of a plea deal.
00:25:15.202 - 00:25:19.346, Speaker B: So this whole thing might have just been a Hail Mary and he might have known going in that he was.
00:25:19.370 - 00:25:20.842, Speaker A: Going down, may as well speak anyway.
00:25:20.898 - 00:25:37.922, Speaker B: Exactly. On the other hand, he definitely thinks that he can talk his way out of anything. And that was the whole point of the media tour, which, by the way, the entire reason he's trapped in this situation by the time he gets to trial is because the version of events that he gave in testimony or not.
00:25:37.938 - 00:25:40.114, Speaker A: In testimony, just speaking, talking to Aaron.
00:25:40.154 - 00:26:03.370, Speaker B: Like it's all on the record, like everybody knew at the store crime, like, why are you doing this? And it turns out. Yeah, like, once you tell the story to the media, you're locked into that version of events. And his cross examination was brutal because he did not have an explanation other than. I don't remember. I don't recall. I didn't tell them to do that. They did that without asking me.
00:26:03.370 - 00:26:08.058, Speaker B: All of which was contradicted by other people's testimony and in many cases, by documentation.
00:26:08.106 - 00:26:19.106, Speaker A: Yeah. What was it like during the cross? Which I thought was masterful. In fact, I think that was the US attorney, Sassoon, Danielle Sassoon. She seemed to smoke him in this.
00:26:19.130 - 00:26:19.634, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:26:19.754 - 00:26:37.858, Speaker A: Because I didn't get to see, we're just reading the transcript and it's like, do you remember? She would lock him into a statement that he previously made and say, yes, I said that. Or he'd say, I don't remember. I didn't say that. And then she would. What was she showing as evidence? Like, where he literally said that?
00:26:37.906 - 00:27:00.182, Speaker B: Media. Yeah, over and over again, over and over again. The one that sticks with me right now is she would ask him about something and then he would say, I don't recall saying that. Or. And the worst part of the cross examination was he would say, I don't recall using those words, or. I don't remember saying exactly that. And then the judge a couple times had to yell at him and be like, just answer the question.
00:27:00.182 - 00:27:01.902, Speaker B: Stop splitting hair. Did you say something?
00:27:01.998 - 00:27:07.350, Speaker A: Did you say it or not? Yeah. How do they describe that? Like, the general. Like, do you recall the general?
00:27:07.462 - 00:27:22.330, Speaker B: Or in substance, inform or in substance, did you say this? And he was just trying to weasel out. And he, it was almost like watching a guy who was a bad high school debater try and, like, score points on some technical scale without recognizing that his real goal was to influence the.
00:27:22.362 - 00:27:26.362, Speaker A: Jury, who are regular people who are literally cross section of Americans.
00:27:26.458 - 00:27:27.314, Speaker B: Can I swear on this?
00:27:27.354 - 00:27:27.826, Speaker C: Yeah, you can.
00:27:27.890 - 00:27:59.276, Speaker B: They don't give a fuck about the niceties of these arguments that he's making inside of his own head. And so it was a lot of that. He was just chopping logic and not really saying anything substantive. He was just, like, hesitating. And, you know, there was an amazing piece of tape that I was reminded of in the George Stephanopoulos interview where he's like, at some point, Stephanopoulos quotes him to terms of service and says, these assets cannot be loaned. And Sam just sits there for a second whispering to himself on national television, going, cannot be loaned. Cannot be loaned.
00:27:59.276 - 00:28:10.812, Speaker B: Like, he's clearly trying to figure out some way to, like, get out of the trap. And there were so many moments like that on the cross ex where he was just like, all he knows how to do is play language games, and he didn't have any real answers.
00:28:10.868 - 00:28:21.644, Speaker A: What was the jury's reaction in general? Like, when you looked over at the jury during this takedown, like, are they exasperated with Sam? Like, are they in shock? What were some of the reactions you saw?
00:28:21.804 - 00:28:37.592, Speaker B: Well, I think the real difference in reactions is actually between the cross examination and the defense's questioning, because the jury was, by and large, extremely attentive. Most people were taking notes. It's complicated stuff. It's SDNY. So there's a lot of people with finance contacts who are taking care of.
00:28:37.598 - 00:28:42.884, Speaker A: I saw that. I mean, actually, we looked at the jury poll. There was even, I think, someone who worked at the US attorney's office in the past.
00:28:42.924 - 00:28:45.508, Speaker B: There was investigators, Harlem Brothers, banker, I.
00:28:45.516 - 00:28:52.332, Speaker A: Think banker, a hedge fund person, a real cross section. There was a MTA bus driver or something. I mean, it was really interesting.
00:28:52.428 - 00:28:52.676, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:52.700 - 00:28:54.404, Speaker A: And, you know, it's classic New Yorker.
00:28:54.444 - 00:29:09.344, Speaker B: Like, it's one reason they try these things here, because people know what they're talking about. But, you know, people were attentive. Right. And when there's a back and forth going on, the jury was paying attention. The real killer, though, was when the defense was doing their questioning. Often the jury would seem to be, like, zoned out. They weren't paying attention.
00:29:09.344 - 00:29:13.424, Speaker B: The defense attorneys were very boring and not engaging and not telling an interesting story.
00:29:13.504 - 00:29:13.840, Speaker A: Right.
00:29:13.912 - 00:29:22.016, Speaker B: So, you know, there was not, like, any moment where the jury was, like, gasping or anything. They were just. They were paying attention. They were watching Danielle Sassoon put on a clinic.
00:29:22.080 - 00:29:22.872, Speaker A: I mean, she did.
00:29:22.968 - 00:29:24.960, Speaker B: And then they kind of checked out when the defense was on.
00:29:24.992 - 00:29:41.624, Speaker A: So they just, like, I mean, they clearly did not think. I mean, you could also didn't think Sam was credible. Right. And I think that's the core of, sure, some of the substance of what Danielle Sassoon was pinning him on matters. There were some facts to pin him on, but it feel like it was just a mega takedown of his credibility as a witness in general.
00:29:41.664 - 00:29:42.088, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:29:42.136 - 00:29:47.760, Speaker A: Like, you can't believe anything he said in the defense direct because this guy is completely not credible overall.
00:29:47.832 - 00:30:00.416, Speaker B: Right. And then in the closing statements, which were not Sassoon, but Roos took over. You know, he just said straight up, you know, he. Sam lied to you under oath, and that was repeated in the closing statements, which is brutal.
00:30:00.480 - 00:30:05.264, Speaker A: Yeah. So then the jury, I mean, by my count, what, they were out for about 5 hours total.
00:30:05.344 - 00:30:05.888, Speaker B: Not even that.
00:30:05.936 - 00:30:06.592, Speaker A: Not even four.
00:30:06.648 - 00:30:07.896, Speaker B: I think it was less than four.
00:30:07.960 - 00:30:08.272, Speaker A: Wow.
00:30:08.328 - 00:30:08.712, Speaker B: Total.
00:30:08.808 - 00:30:27.728, Speaker A: So, I mean, the obvious thing, you know, is that if you're in a jury trial, civil or criminal, a quick. Well, let's use criminal as the example. It's a little simpler. A quick verdict is almost universally bad for the defendant. Right. Because it means, like, they just think he's guilty. It's easier to find him guilty if everyone.
00:30:27.776 - 00:30:35.160, Speaker B: I can actually add some serious color here, right. Cause the judge set the deadline of 08:00 p.m. We went late the last two days. Everybody wanted to get.
00:30:35.192 - 00:30:42.112, Speaker A: And I saw there was this thing about a jury who had a flight on Friday, so they were gonna break for Friday. If it ran longer than Thursday, they're gonna wait till Monday. Yeah.
00:30:42.168 - 00:30:57.464, Speaker B: So, like, there was big debate back and forth between the journalists, like, are we gonna get a verdict tonight? We just, like, were sitting there waiting, like, reading the newspapers in the jury room. It was going to eight. The jury got pizza. They got cars home. That's nice. Good for them. We're waiting.
00:30:57.464 - 00:31:09.552, Speaker B: We're waiting. We're waiting at 745. They're like, we've got a verdict. So they were just sitting there waiting for the deadline. They were just chilling like, until ten, till eight. It probably took about an hour or two to get the verdict.
00:31:09.608 - 00:31:20.000, Speaker A: Yeah, right. They probably were like, let's be real, guys, like, well, and there were like nine counts. So they technically did have some process of, like, we do actually have to go through each of the counts and make sure we all agree that he was guilty on.
00:31:20.032 - 00:31:27.536, Speaker B: Well, here's the question. Here's the thing, though. There are seven counts. They actually don't have to do the technical stuff. Like the judge instructs them on the technical stuff.
00:31:27.680 - 00:31:29.456, Speaker A: Here's where conspiracy, you know what?
00:31:29.560 - 00:31:33.456, Speaker B: We're just gonna do a straw. They vote. Is everyone think to do any of that? Yeah.
00:31:33.520 - 00:31:33.720, Speaker C: Really?
00:31:33.752 - 00:31:36.844, Speaker A: They can do whatever they want, actually, once they're back in the room.
00:31:37.484 - 00:31:38.924, Speaker B: Us citizenship, baby.
00:31:39.044 - 00:31:43.700, Speaker A: So have any of them spoken publicly since? Do we know?
00:31:43.892 - 00:31:45.068, Speaker B: Not that I've seen.
00:31:45.196 - 00:32:02.204, Speaker A: Sometimes jurors do, and they're certainly free to. Yeah, it's a free country. That'll be really interesting if they do. I mean, we should. Journalists everywhere have to be trying to see if they can. But, you know, you gotta be careful too. Obviously, there's certainly during the trial, but in general, protecting jurors identity is extremely important.
00:32:02.204 - 00:32:02.692, Speaker A: Right.
00:32:02.788 - 00:32:09.572, Speaker B: I mean, their identities are theoretically public, but I think it's not so much legal, but just in an ethical sense. You don't want to out there.
00:32:09.588 - 00:32:19.252, Speaker A: These are people, by the way, doing their duty to society. This is not somebody who needs to be doxxed, necessarily, but it will be interesting to hear, get some color about what it was like in that jury room.
00:32:19.308 - 00:32:26.244, Speaker B: I would say, honestly, we're not even on jury and we're still recovering. Give them a couple weeks and maybe someone will decide they want to talk.
00:32:26.284 - 00:32:32.892, Speaker A: Yeah, it was long. It wasn't the longest trial, but that's a long. But it's, what was it, six or eight weeks or something?
00:32:32.948 - 00:32:39.292, Speaker B: No, four or five, actually. They really got it done. The Elizabeth Holmes trial was six months.
00:32:39.348 - 00:32:42.812, Speaker A: Oh, my God. Was it really bored? Can you imagine being on that jury for that long?
00:32:42.908 - 00:32:44.864, Speaker B: I mean, I would have loved it, but.
00:32:45.804 - 00:32:55.844, Speaker A: Oh, man. So were there any other moments that just stuck out to you from the trial that, you know, like, I don't know, it was neat to me. It seemed pretty, like, methodical and simple, the case against him.
00:32:55.924 - 00:33:40.864, Speaker B: Well, I mean, the thing that I was paying attention to, and it's a little ghoulish, undeniably, but, I mean, I was in the courtroom watching his parents, because not only did we find out that they were way more involved than we thought. But obviously, this is an intense thing for anybody, and it was tough to watch because they were losing their composure. I was in the courtroom when the verdict was handed down, and they really, they did not completely lose it. It seemed like this was expected by everybody by the end of the. But they got day up. And I think this was interesting. I'm not gonna speak definitively, but what I saw was Sam got up, the verdict was read.
00:33:40.864 - 00:34:08.380, Speaker B: Most people filed out. The jury was gone. The parents were there at the very end with dozens of journalists, again, ghoulish, but waiting to just see what happened. And they kind of, like, walked up behind the defense table as Sam was. They didn't cuff him in the courtroom. They actually had to marshals that walked out. But they were, like, sitting there waiting and, like, they'll never see him again as a free man.
00:34:08.452 - 00:34:09.524, Speaker A: Did they get to talk to him?
00:34:09.564 - 00:34:11.188, Speaker B: They did not get to talk to him, as far as I could tell.
00:34:11.196 - 00:34:12.604, Speaker A: Was there a hug or any kind of.
00:34:12.684 - 00:34:16.236, Speaker B: He did not go out of his way to turn around and acknowledge them.
00:34:16.300 - 00:34:16.636, Speaker A: Wow.
00:34:16.700 - 00:34:26.452, Speaker B: Which I thought was quite interesting. And I might have missed some moment. Maybe there was some brief eye contact, but he can't turn around and hug them. He's in custody.
00:34:26.468 - 00:34:27.612, Speaker A: He could have, like, done, but there.
00:34:27.628 - 00:34:33.112, Speaker B: Was no, like, gesture, no wave or nothing that I saw. Pretty tough.
00:34:33.288 - 00:34:45.864, Speaker A: That is tough. And I'm a parent. I can think about how devastated you would be and also what a failure you would feel like. And, by the way, would be, if your kid grows up to be Sam Bankham defreed, you've clearly done something wrong.
00:34:46.024 - 00:35:33.612, Speaker B: And in their case, it's even tougher than that because they didn't raise him as, like, some in any typical way. Right. They indoctrinated him in a pretty alternative set of ethical standards. And one of the big things that I'm going to be diving into when I write this book is, what are those ethical standards? Well, one of the most fascinating things is that Barbara fried, and I haven't done the full survey, but some of her work was about essentially arguing that people who commit corporate fraud are not responsible for their actions. And, I mean, I'm being reductive, but she has a 2013 paper called, I think beyond blame, where she's arguing that, like, blame in the justice system is harmful. And so, like, putting those things together, it's just like, it's very weird stuff.
00:35:33.668 - 00:35:42.868, Speaker A: That is really weird. And, you know, have you looked in? So there's another trial. And I guess is that on the political, like the political donation fraud, basically.
00:35:42.916 - 00:36:12.310, Speaker B: Like election donations, and I think perhaps the bribery charges, it really remains to be seen. And the government has until February 28 to let the court know whether they're actually gonna pursue those charges. My understanding is that often when you get a big conviction and there's another set of charges, you just drop the second round and don't go through it again. However, in this case, because it's the campaign finance stuff, there's some political barriers to dropping those charges. So they might wind up going through. Right.
00:36:12.342 - 00:36:21.846, Speaker A: Because if they drop them, it looks like they're letting not just Sam, but maybe even Congress off easy. And there's probably deterrence reasons why they want to do the charges.
00:36:21.910 - 00:36:47.254, Speaker B: And not just that, but it's partisan. And it's. I have to speak out because this is something that has been very badly misperceived. There's, you know, people on the right. Republicans believe that Sam and have said multiple times over the course of all of this that Sam is somehow going to get a pardon or get off because he was this, like, democratic mega donor. Y'all are listening to Sam's own propaganda. He committed campaign finance fraud to conceal the fact that he was donating money to both parties.
00:36:47.254 - 00:36:48.906, Speaker B: And so when you're saying he used.
00:36:48.930 - 00:36:52.618, Speaker A: The straw donors he had, was it Nishad and Gary? Who was it Gary?
00:36:52.706 - 00:37:01.608, Speaker B: It was Nishad and Ryan. Sam and Ryan Salem primarily. I mean, he probably just, like, used everybody as cutouts, but those were the big ones. And he had Ryan Salem doing all of his cause.
00:37:01.736 - 00:37:06.816, Speaker A: He gave to two thirds of the 535 members of the House and Senate.
00:37:06.880 - 00:37:07.824, Speaker B: Oh, I didn't know that.
00:37:07.904 - 00:37:08.844, Speaker A: Two thirds.
00:37:09.144 - 00:37:09.744, Speaker B: Not surprising.
00:37:09.784 - 00:37:27.416, Speaker A: It's just wild to think about. Many of them spent the money and can't give it back. Some gave it back or donated it or whatever, but, like, that's a big deal. He was also, what, the biggest donor to President Biden's or the second biggest? I think he was the second biggest, maybe to President Biden's presidential candidate.
00:37:27.440 - 00:37:33.704, Speaker B: But keep in mind, he's, like, broke now, has no power, and has. Is embarrassed. So, like, nobody's gonna do anything to help this guy at this point.
00:37:33.704 - 00:37:42.604, Speaker A: Speaker one. No, totally. I agree. But so that, that trial. Yeah, it's gonna be interesting if that happens. So then they're not sentencing until, what? March?
00:37:42.904 - 00:37:50.800, Speaker B: And this sentencing is set from March 28 for this conviction, which is wild that they just let him wait for four months.
00:37:50.872 - 00:37:59.768, Speaker A: I guess if he hadn't been remanded already to MDC. Some I read, and maybe, you know, if that's true, he might not have actually be in jail until the second.
00:37:59.816 - 00:38:09.048, Speaker B: That is my understanding. And that is crazy. An idiot just, like, accomplished. The thing that got him sent back to jail was leaking Carolyn's diary or whatever.
00:38:09.096 - 00:38:09.520, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:38:09.632 - 00:38:20.992, Speaker B: Which seemed to accomplish absolutely nothing and seemed like it could not have accomplished anything because, you know, it was part of this strategy where he was trying to, like, discredit her as the manager of Alameda, but it didn't look like. But it didn't really accomplish.
00:38:21.048 - 00:38:33.684, Speaker A: And I read the story that was written about those, those diaries or whatever, and I thought it was interesting journalism for sure, getting into her head a little bit, but, like, I didn't think it moved the needle in any direction at all. No.
00:38:33.724 - 00:38:40.148, Speaker B: And in retrospect, it honestly just supports the idea that she was, like, really not into what she was doing and.
00:38:40.156 - 00:38:50.452, Speaker A: That she was hating every man, not very experienced person for that role. And she was a girl. I mean, she was like a normal person. Like, to me, if anything, had humanized her.
00:38:50.508 - 00:38:51.124, Speaker B: Oh, totally.
00:38:51.204 - 00:38:56.092, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. Accomplished nothing. What an idiot. Why would he do that? He could have been hanging out in Palo Alto the entire time.
00:38:56.188 - 00:39:26.540, Speaker B: And I think this speaks to sort of the bigger picture here of who he was as a person and kind of how he was perceived, which is everybody. Not everybody. A lot of people wanted to think he was a genius and in some, perhaps very limited scope of basically being a traitor. Maybe he was some kind of mathematical genius or at least gifted at some point, but in terms of understanding people or even understanding just anything beyond the very narrow scope of his specialization, he seems to be very stupid, frankly.
00:39:26.572 - 00:40:11.280, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, all he had to do was not intimidate witnesses, basically, and he'd still be fraud that has ever happened. Is it the.
00:40:11.352 - 00:40:30.796, Speaker B: I mean, it's definitely by scale the biggest fraud in crypto, but I also feel like it's actually not some epochal thing. Right. Like, you've been around two. It's cyclical. At the top of every cycle, we attract vultures, we attract parasites who want to feed off of what's going on here, which is growing.
00:40:30.940 - 00:40:32.144, Speaker A: You're good at this real quick.
00:40:33.284 - 00:40:40.384, Speaker B: Which is, like, the reason it's the biggest fraud in crypto is because crypto has grown, not because he's exceptional.
00:40:40.724 - 00:40:42.276, Speaker A: Yeah, it's really interesting, and I think.
00:40:42.300 - 00:40:58.898, Speaker B: We'Ll see more frauds and bigger frauds the next time around, and people will get taken, but it's all about learning as you go and hope you know there's nothing more, Lindy, than keeping an eye out for the new people and saying, I don't trust you until you've got a track record.
00:40:58.946 - 00:41:02.094, Speaker A: Yeah, Sam didn't have one. He came out of nowhere.
00:41:02.434 - 00:41:02.986, Speaker B: It's just.
00:41:03.050 - 00:41:24.034, Speaker A: What a wild situation. I can't believe how that happened. All right, got some questions. We were looking through some of David's work, which, like I've said, I've been reading David's particularly coindesk columns for a long time. I've got a couple questions about stuff that you've covered in the past. This kind of ranges the gamut across crypto. So we're stepping back from Sam's trial now.
00:41:24.034 - 00:41:47.258, Speaker A: You wrote a book, bitcoin is magic, Internet money, memetic warfare, and the end of mere reality. And in the book, you discuss the magical elements of bitcoin. How does that magic manifest in the creation of propagation of bitcoin's value proposition and belief system in your mind? This is sort of. Give us a quick summary of the thesis of that book.
00:41:47.306 - 00:41:47.898, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:41:47.986 - 00:41:49.254, Speaker A: What do you mean by that?
00:41:50.474 - 00:42:44.964, Speaker B: The core of the book is, if you're familiar with Crowley and magic, or what Alan Moore is really into, which is this understanding of magic as a collective symbolic act where we're all kind of agreeing on something. And this is kind of the big lesson of bitcoin, right, is that money is what we agree money to be. And obviously there's more to it than that. You can't just put ticks on a board. And the reason the system is what it is, is to support that idea. But everybody who's running a bitcoin node is participating in this collective act of meaning. Creation is basically the core argument of the book, and that we're moving symbols around and talking to each other through the blockchain in a way that creates something larger than our ourselves and larger even than the collective of all the parts.
00:42:44.964 - 00:43:00.016, Speaker B: And so that's magic in the sense of discourse, of symbols, of things that we elevate to a kind of transcendental state that is way bigger than the bits and bytes on the computers.
00:43:00.080 - 00:43:38.072, Speaker A: It's fascinating. Here's another one for you, David. In 2014, actually, bitcoin was around dollar 900 at this point. You were at the North American Bitcoin conference, and Vitalik Buterin, who shortly thereafter would be the main founder of Ethereum, obviously he gave a talk on daos, and at the time, they were often called digital asset corporations. And you said he admitted by the way, we were reading this too. You said during the talk, sometimes he emitted strange frog hiccups and gave off the impression of, quote, a nervous nerd messiah. This is one of the reasons I love David's writing, by the way.
00:43:38.072 - 00:43:59.948, Speaker A: You got a great way with words and flourishes. So I like entertaining writing. I prefer not to. I want reading to be a textbook. So I continue to recommend reading David's content now at flesh markets. But at the time, you wrote that despite their promise, there were issues with daos. And what you said was there was a lack of infrastructure and integration of the broader economy, which would limit their functionality and adoption.
00:43:59.948 - 00:44:22.484, Speaker A: You said they could either make our economies more egalitarian or they might further the domination of a savvy few. And you said they might eventually take on lives of their own. You said, quote, their most profoundly strange feature, the thing that makes them both amazingly powerful and more than a little disturbing is their capacity to take on lives of their own. First of all, what did you mean by that? And then separately, that was ten years ago. Like, has the picture changed for Dallas in your mind?
00:44:22.524 - 00:44:31.004, Speaker B: I mean, the picture has changed completely. So. And just by the way, the 2014 talk, he talked a bit about daos, but that was the announcement of Ethereum.
00:44:31.044 - 00:44:31.220, Speaker A: Right?
00:44:31.252 - 00:45:04.174, Speaker B: So, like, I was there for that. It's like one of my biggest Og moments. I actually still have a t shirt from that conference. Love that. But daos at the time, we thought were going to be automated business logic people were talking about, and this is still a possibility in a different way. But people were talking about decentralized Uber. And the idea at that time was basically, you set up an algorithm that's going to do certain things, and then it distributes out and is able to interact with the blockchain so that it has monetary tools at its disposal.
00:45:04.174 - 00:45:35.936, Speaker B: And that understanding has changed a lot. I think that maybe eventually we're going to circle back around to that, because I think there is immense possibility in just smart contract systems that are businesses. But obviously, daos now are more about groups of people coming together and agreeing to certain governance rules and coordinating action. And I think that that is still a totally viable and interesting model where maybe over time we slot more automation into those. Right?
00:45:35.960 - 00:45:42.152, Speaker A: Because it's called the term as a decentralized autonomous organization, which doesn't really fit anymore.
00:45:42.208 - 00:45:44.256, Speaker B: No, so not autonomous. But that was the idea at the time.
00:45:44.360 - 00:45:54.800, Speaker A: I've been a critic in the past. I've said, well, they're also not. Mostly, they're not decentralized many DAOs and Defi applications are actually controlled by a simple multisig. Right.
00:45:54.992 - 00:45:58.112, Speaker B: Or their membership is permissioned, which I think is actually correct for the way.
00:45:58.128 - 00:46:04.920, Speaker A: They work now and then. The third one is organization. I was like, they're also not organizations from a legal sense. You saw the.
00:46:04.952 - 00:46:06.200, Speaker B: Although that's changing a little bit.
00:46:06.312 - 00:46:32.026, Speaker A: I know. So. And I'm hoping it will. I'm pleading with Dow founders and to register as a limited liability corporation, say, in Wyoming. There's pathways now to limit your liability because actually, they're mostly being held in courts. To the extent this has been done in at least two lawsuits, it was argued that they're general partnerships, which is actually terrible because that means every member of the Dow is joint and severally liable for the totality of the DAO's actions. Right.
00:46:32.090 - 00:47:01.726, Speaker B: And, in fact, on this topic, I really recommend a relatively recent book called Blockchain Radicals by Nate Devila, who talks about platform cooperativism cooperatives. So you can be an LLC, but you can also have a legal status as a co op, which is a different thing that has different affordances, but I think actually fits the model of even better what daos are. So I think that that's kind of where we're at right now. And I have good friends at Gnosis, other places where they're building out the.
00:47:01.750 - 00:47:17.278, Speaker A: Tooling for this, because I remember Aragon. I don't know if that project is still around, but it's still going. Yeah. That was also a very early Dao corporation. Daos is really companies, right? You could do payroll, you could have adjudication of disputes. It was very interesting. Okay, here's another one.
00:47:17.278 - 00:47:39.624, Speaker A: In 2019, you tweeted, you said, the reason maximalists are more. You're talking about bitcoin maximalists. The reason bitcoin maximists are more engaging and interesting is because they have an ethos and have played out its implications. I couldn't spell out the beliefs of ETH heads. If you put a gun to my head, doesn't mean they don't have one. But does that, you still agree with that? Does Ethereum have more of that?
00:47:39.624 - 00:48:40.684, Speaker B: Does that equation have changed? Yeah. I mean, I hope this isn't a controversial statement. Well, I'm sure it is, but like, you know, the 2020, 2021 class of bitcoiners were, they were not sending their best, let's say. I think that there was a big devolution in what it meant to be a bitcoin maximalist, and it sort of turned into, you know, Nick Carter and I are totally on the same page about this, and we've kind of written about each other's contributions that, like, the bitcoin crowd has lost the plot a little bit, I would say. And there are still people, like, we talked a little bit about Eric Voorhees conversation with Sam. I mean, there are still very principled people who have thought out their positions, but I think that there are a lot more people who are figureheads of bitcoin who don't have thought out positions. Meanwhile, on the Ethereum side, I think the ethos has developed a lot, and it has become a lot more about daos, coordinated action, social coordination.
00:48:40.684 - 00:49:03.646, Speaker B: I don't think all of those ideas are entirely intuitively compelling. I'm not really sold on regenerative finance, and some of those things seems like a goal more than a practical thing so far, but at least I think it does constitute something like an ethos that has clarified over the last few years.
00:49:03.830 - 00:49:27.804, Speaker A: Here's another one for you, David. We're going to talk about Worldcoin. I'm very excited about this because I have been a very vocal critic of worldcoin. You have as well. And I was a long time ago I said that. I think I tweeted, I believe this is actually what got me blocked by Chris Dixon from a 16 z. I said that it was audaciously tyrannical, the concept.
00:49:27.804 - 00:49:57.376, Speaker A: But you've written a lot about it. You said, that's exactly right in your own words. You said it eviscerates. You said, it's eviscerating for the ominous implications of gathering biometric data from the global poor, but also for the initial distribution of its tokens. They've played out a lot of your concerns. I'd love to hear your views on how privacy has evolved since you entered the space as a concept in crypto, but also anything on world coin specifically, you want to share.
00:49:57.480 - 00:50:22.218, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I don't know. Like, worldcoin. What do you say? It's just like, it's very stupid, and it's like a stupid idea from somebody who's very influential. And so he got a bunch of money for it. I mean, even if you think about it on a very basic level, like, you can't scale it. You can't scale this, like giant metal basketball to go out and individually recruit people. It doesn't make any sense.
00:50:22.218 - 00:50:40.498, Speaker B: I just want to scream, because just that very basic thing, it's like, how do you even get enough of those machines and enough people running those machines to actually accomplish the goal that you're setting out to, it doesn't make sense. And so I think it's one of these things that you see so often in Silicon Valley where they're saying one thing, but the real purpose is actually something else.
00:50:40.546 - 00:50:41.346, Speaker A: What do you think that purpose is?
00:50:41.370 - 00:51:22.076, Speaker B: And I think the real purpose is really just to pioneer further biometrics. Like, I think all they care about the biometrics and they'll find some other application for that. I mean, first, let's get into the tokenomics, because why is this going to work as a Ubi? Where does the value of world coin derive from? Is it just yet another thing where you're going to say, oh, everybody's going to use it as money, and therefore it doesn't make sense at any level. And so I just don't even want to belabor the point. The privacy in crypto, right. I mean, this has been obviously a huge evolution, and I think it's still one that's ongoing because the privacy coin stuff is still out there. I mean, mixers are still out there.
00:51:22.076 - 00:52:00.730, Speaker B: And I think that we do have to fight the classification of mixers as like, money laundering tools. Like that is a major problem. But at the same time, I think that people have come to terms with in a, I think, mostly positive way with the idea that blockchains are not anonymous. Blockchains do not offer privacy. And that's not the worst thing in the world. Especially when you start thinking about like, I mean, you even still see people saying like, oh, crypto is for crime, crypto is for terrorists. We had this thing with the elliptic and Wall Street Journal last week or two weeks ago where, you know, that whole thing got pretty thoroughly debunked.
00:52:00.730 - 00:52:57.024, Speaker B: And I think that, like, as a space, as an industry or whatever you want to call it, I think that's only good where you say, no, what we're doing here is actually more about transparency than privacy. I think that's a net positive because you as an individual, and I don't want to say if you're not doing anything wrong, if you want to do stuff that's, I mean, I wrote a column called in defense of crime about a year and a half ago that I still recommend people, great title, but it's like you're working around the edges. You're not doing large scale terrorist financing or money laundering or anything like that. You can get away with stuff that is pseudo gray area legal if you're just doing it around the edges. But then if you're doing major crimes people can find you. I think that's a good balance. I think that we're going to get to even further down.
00:52:57.024 - 00:53:11.224, Speaker B: We can talk five years from now, let's put charities on the blockchain so you can actually monitor what's going on. Government agencies on the blockchain, so you know how they're actually spending their money. I think all of those are very interesting and have, because there's been these so many.
00:53:11.304 - 00:53:32.670, Speaker A: You talk about governments. I'm thinking what immediately comes to my head is how the DoD periodically loses billions of dollars. Remember, there was a thing actually right before 911, the Defense Department announced that they had, like, misplaced like $100 billion. I forget some number. I forget, I don't want to cite the number. And then, of course, everybody forgot about it because we got deep into the throes of 911 and then the war in Afghanistan. But, like, they.
00:53:32.670 - 00:53:38.370, Speaker A: What do you mean you lost it? Right. Like, if it was digital, right. We would see where it went. I mean, you'd be able to find it.
00:53:38.402 - 00:53:50.554, Speaker B: Exactly. It's like, it's so. And I mean, you speak to a specific concern of mine, which is like the security state and, you know, intelligence agencies and things like that. But that's a rabbit hole. We can do that at different times.
00:53:50.714 - 00:54:31.404, Speaker A: It's a good one, though. Okay, sort of. Maybe not the second to last question. So you wrote a column called Twitter is dead. Long live crypto Twitter. You've been a critic of X since the takeover by Elon Musk, but you still use it. Why is that? Why do you still use it? What value is there still talk about maybe in your mind, how it's evolved? What value do there used to be? And what's that delta? But also, where do you think it's going? And is there not a possibility of decentralized social media? Is that never that sort of Ahab's white whale that we're always looking for or the holy grail that we never find? Is that something that eventually can emerge in your mind, or should.
00:54:31.994 - 00:54:46.274, Speaker B: I mean, I think it's definitely going to emerge at the very least, we've had all these projects. Blue sky is supposed to transition to decentralized at some point, and at least the infrastructure is being built. It's being proven out.
00:54:46.314 - 00:54:53.546, Speaker A: Right, because the Ethereum's like, what farcaster Len, something like bitcoiner's like Noster, which is also lens.
00:54:53.570 - 00:54:59.100, Speaker B: And Nostra, I think, have had some significant pickup. It feels like I honestly haven't used either of them.
00:54:59.292 - 00:55:23.940, Speaker A: I used Noster a bit. But I mean, but I think the social media is like liquidity, right? Like, liquidity begets liquidity. Like, you need to be where everyone is. And to me, at least in our space, Twitter is still, the x is still. That place takes a lot to move people off it. But how is it different now? I mean, to me, like, crypto Twitter has never been better. But are other people not using it anymore? Other communities?
00:55:24.052 - 00:56:01.014, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think that my criticisms of musk fall into a couple of buckets, but the main one is just like, his business decisions have been insane and his relationship with advertisers and his understanding of where the value in the platform comes from. It's like the opposite of the thing that we're saying about decentralized social, which is that the value accrues to the user and the creative and the poster, basically, whereas he's trying to extract value from the user. Things like trying to get Stephen King to pay $8 a month for a subscription. He doesn't fundamentally get Stephen King on.
00:56:01.054 - 00:56:02.918, Speaker A: There in order to make the whole thing valuable.
00:56:03.006 - 00:56:55.406, Speaker B: Exactly. And so as much as I feel like there were major problems with a project like Deso where you're directly trying to financialize social clout, I don't think that's a good model, but I do think it at least gets the structure right where the individual is the source of value. So that's my criticism of Elon's approach to Twitter. He doesn't understand how it works, but as far as the current state of it, it's become much less useful for general news. You have, most news organizations are not even posting there anymore, frankly, because of the way that he has treated them. But for communities, for tight knit communities, and especially for pre established communities like crypto Twitter, it's still really good. And, I mean, I have tragically, you know, I've had a lot of success on Twitter after it has started its decline.
00:56:55.406 - 00:57:15.140, Speaker B: So I'm just, like, extracting the last little bit of juice from that thing and, you know, we'll see if it's still vital in two or three years. It is still, I think, important and useful now. It's really been great for me growing the newsletter, which, by the way, is at davidzmorris dot substack.com dot. And so it's still giving me a lot of value.
00:57:15.252 - 00:57:44.344, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, we went, we started on bitcointalk.org dot, and then Reddit had a pretty big moment in crypto and in bitcoin, and then I would say since maybe, like, maybe like, early 2017, maybe even a little earlier, it really has been all Twitter. That's the front page for bitcoin, for Ethereum, for crypto, like, for markets even. I would hate to see it go away. I love Twitter, personally. I love the format. I don't like the long form stuff.
00:57:44.344 - 00:57:51.868, Speaker A: I prefer to read it on substack or on medium. Is a much. Literally on the eyes. Like, it's not nice on the eyes. Personally, I don't.
00:57:51.916 - 00:57:54.052, Speaker B: And I think that's enough. I mean, it's another example, I think.
00:57:54.068 - 00:57:56.540, Speaker A: Of who wants to read, like, an 8000 word tweet.
00:57:56.692 - 00:58:02.348, Speaker B: There are some people who do, I guess, but, like, it's another example of elon not quite getting, like, what the appeal is.
00:58:02.436 - 00:58:11.880, Speaker A: So do you think he's gonna add financial tools? And I don't mean the financialization of social, but, like, he's been talking about, like, making everything apple.
00:58:12.052 - 00:58:25.560, Speaker B: I just. I think he's gonna do it in some sense. Like, there's gonna be things that are added. I mean, this is. This is his whole. And this is kind of why he, I think, has mismanaged it, because he didn't actually want to own Twitter. He wanted to go back in time to.
00:58:25.560 - 00:58:31.128, Speaker B: Before he got kicked out of PayPal. And, you know, he made it X.com comma, which was in his mind originally.
00:58:31.176 - 00:58:32.744, Speaker A: That was his domain 20 years ago.
00:58:32.864 - 00:58:39.088, Speaker B: Was a payments app. And that's, I think, what he really cares about.
00:58:39.176 - 00:58:43.176, Speaker A: He makes it, like, what wechat, basically. It's like half his goal.
00:58:43.320 - 00:58:59.304, Speaker B: But I also, again, don't think he's, like, looked at the landscape. Like, WeChat works in China as an everything app for very specific reasons, and you just can't, like, recreate it in the. In the US and western context. So I think that's not gonna, like. I think he's gonna try, but I don't think it's gonna really take off.
00:58:59.384 - 00:59:15.954, Speaker A: All right, last question. So your new location is called flesh markets. Davidz Morris dot substack.com. You can also, as you mentioned, read David's work in protos recently on the trial. What is flash markets? What do you envision that being and going forward?
00:59:16.074 - 01:00:11.000, Speaker B: So I think that in the context of the Bankman free trial is a really good way to understand my project there, because the reason it's called flesh markets is partly. It is literally a reference to some of the darker parts of our history and economy, which involve a lot of human domination of other humans, but in the specific context of finance, Sam's key mistake was thinking that everything was calculable, that everything was just numbers and math, and then you could predict what was going to happen. But we are humans. We are flesh. We are weak, we are incomplete, and the numbers are just an abstraction of all of that. So the goal at flesh markets is to try and kind of bridge that gap where I'm talking about finance, I'm talking about tech, I'm talking about AI, I'm talking about crypto. Every, every week you get a couple of roundups of big news that have my thoughts, but it's all way more squishy than it appears on the surface.
01:00:11.000 - 01:00:24.964, Speaker B: And you kind of have to get beneath that surface to get into the guts, to get into the complexity and the flesh of it all. And so that's the pitch for the newsletter, is that it's like finance with complications.
