00:00:00.240 - 00:00:36.134, Speaker A: We're in the post truth era. We're going to move to the post post truth era where now, again, so back in the day, we didn't have Photoshop, and so if there was an image or a video, is assumed authentic, then we had this gulf of uncertainty which lasted from whenever to now. And now AI is accelerating us out of that gulf because now we're going to assume that everything's fake and we are going to have to rely on cryptographic signatures to determine that something's real, or at least to ascribe the creation of some content to an individual.
00:00:36.434 - 00:00:49.694, Speaker B: Welcome to galaxy brains, an infinite amount of cash. I'm your host, Alex Thornton. The us banking system is sound and resilient. Bitcoin made a new all time high. If you're not long, if you're not long, you're short.
00:00:49.994 - 00:00:55.454, Speaker C: Satoshi's gonna come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet. All bitcoin's gonna be erased.
00:00:56.424 - 00:01:14.480, Speaker B: Bitcoin is the best crypto. Bitcoin is going to zero. Welcome back to Galaxy Brains. I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy. We have a great show for you today. Back from Austin, Texas, we have Nick Carter, founder partner at Castle Island Ventures on. He's a third time guest.
00:01:14.480 - 00:01:51.014, Speaker B: I think it's our only third time guest, other than folks at Galaxy like Bim net and Tyler Williams and Christine Kim. We're going to talk with Nick about AI a lot. We're going to talk about AI, we're going to talk about crypto regulation, and we're going to talk about Nick's budding career as a MMA fighter. We'll also check with our good friend Bibnett Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, before we get to that, I need to remind you to please refer to a link to disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. We've got a great interview with Nick and with BiMnet. Let's hop right into the show.
00:01:51.014 - 00:01:57.474, Speaker B: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. Bimnett, as always, welcome back to galaxy brains.
00:01:57.554 - 00:01:58.522, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:01:58.618 - 00:02:10.810, Speaker B: So I was away in Austin last week, so I'm a little bit out of the loop, but it seemed like the data is softening the economic data. What are you seeing in the data and how has the market been reacting? But I guess the first part first. Yeah.
00:02:10.842 - 00:02:45.264, Speaker C: So we've seen the data softening pretty materially in some employment metrics, some price metrics, and other kind of broad sentiment indicators. More specifically, core PCE was the big one. That's the Fed's preferred measure of inflation. It came in at 0.249 for the month of April. That, again, kind of adds to the string of, okay, CPI and PCE numbers that we've had. And then today you had jolts, which are job openings surprised lower by 300,000.
00:02:45.264 - 00:03:21.182, Speaker C: And you've had things like, indeed, job openings and some other high frequency employment. Market points point to a slowdown in hiring activity. Then looking at manufacturing and services. You had ISM manufacturing out yesterday. The price is paid component, the price component of that survey came in software. So did the new orders. And then the other thing to think about is generally crude oil is a barometer of broad economic activity, and it dipped a lot.
00:03:21.182 - 00:03:24.750, Speaker C: You're trading at 73, $74 for WTI.
00:03:24.822 - 00:03:27.070, Speaker B: We were up in the eighties. Briefly, we were.
00:03:27.262 - 00:03:43.302, Speaker C: But some of the geopolitical tensions have eroded, and it looks like there's a ton of supply less demand. And so the prices are reacting accordingly. OPEC, did they have price cuts that they're still, they were going to tighten?
00:03:43.438 - 00:03:44.822, Speaker B: But even in the face of that.
00:03:44.918 - 00:04:27.784, Speaker C: Even in the face of that, yes. And another conspiracy theory thing is Saudi Aramco is doing this huge equity offering. They're trying to sell like 15 billion in the open market. So folks have always thought that going into that sale, they want oil like lot higher to get more funds. The point being, you've had a slowdown in the data. It's enough for the market to start pricing in a greater likelihood of cuts happening sooner as well. I think now that you're getting to this point where employment is tilting over a little bit, non farm payrolls on Friday are going to be very important to watch.
00:04:27.784 - 00:05:18.280, Speaker C: But it's also, I think, what you really have to think about as an investor is kind of the distribution of outcomes, because when you start cutting, it opens the door for a number of different things. Right. So if you start cutting, that means you think that you're supposed to be lowering interest rates. So then the question becomes, what magnitude do you cut? Is your first cut 25? Is it 50? Right. And if you're trying to get rates to a more not too accommodative, but not too restrictive point, which is their goal. Right. You have to think that there's a chance that they just cut two times of 50 basis points, but the odds of them just doing 25 and then 25 and then 25, I think, is, I don't think that's likely.
00:05:18.280 - 00:06:06.896, Speaker C: But again, when you look at what's priced in, you're only seeing the cumulative basis points that are priced in, not necessarily the probability of like a 50 and the probability of a 25. It looks like the weighted average of those probabilities and stuff. So there's some distortions in the interest rate curve. But I firmly believe that if you do start cutting, they're going to be a little bit more aggressive than the market anticipates. And right now, if you do start to see cracks in the labor market, particularly on this non farm payrolls, I think the market will start thinking about a July or September cutting in a more meaningful way. And so I think you're seeing the setup there. And then the last thing I'll mention is last week also brought about significant weakness in some software names.
00:06:06.896 - 00:06:44.502, Speaker C: In the US, you had like four software and generally electronic computer stuff that those companies gave very poor guidance and those stocks were down like 20% plus. And so there's a lot of areas underneath the hood of the S and P 500 and the Nasdaq that aren't performing that well. Some of the consumer discretionary names as well have been giving poor guidance. You're also seeing the FDIC had a report out last night talking about banking health, and they think that more banks are in trouble than their last quarter report is growing.
00:06:44.518 - 00:06:49.342, Speaker B: Yeah, I think they have it at 63 banks or something like that, up from somewhere in the fifties.
00:06:49.438 - 00:06:49.670, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:49.702 - 00:07:38.414, Speaker C: And the mark to market losses on those portfolios are increasing. And the banks that are now part of that stress category are banks that have higher assets on average than the ones that were there before. And so there's an element of like, there's pockets of stress in banking, commercial real estate. You're seeing an uptick in non performing loans, credit card write offs. You've seen material weakness in things like used autos and stuff. And so I really do think that you're starting to hit that soft patch of data and that it will mean that the Fed is going to get more comfortable with cutting sooner rather than later. And I think once that seeps into the market, I think the market's going to be very aggressive in terms of pricing in that rate path.
00:07:38.994 - 00:08:00.678, Speaker B: Everyone in January was calling for. The market had priced seven cuts this year, but the data didn't support that. And you were very critical of the market. You said, market, dear Mister Market, you are wrong. The data is not nearly soft enough to justify that. Why would the Fed use this now? And now I can't believe it's already, it's been six. Well, I guess it's been five full months.
00:08:00.678 - 00:08:18.198, Speaker B: We're in the 6th month and it really does feel like there's, and we're going to this summer, which is a slower and not in all facets of the economy, but it certainly feels slower. And you think now is this, are we turning or it's the perennial question, or is this in between the two peaks?
00:08:18.326 - 00:08:19.454, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I.
00:08:19.614 - 00:08:21.710, Speaker B: Because inflation is still pretty stubborn here. Right.
00:08:21.782 - 00:09:10.974, Speaker C: You know, ultimately, like, we're not, the Fed can't solve the fiscal issue. Government is still spending a ton of money and I think they're going to be inclined to have more stimulative measures in place before the election. And so, you know, I think the risk of reflation is always there. You know, geopolitical risks, you know, can take commodity prices higher and there's still just so much money washing around in the system. But right here, right now, I think I feel comfortable letting my foot off the gas. But the other constraint that we always talk about is just the debt, and the debt's just so not sustainable at these levels of interest rates and stuff. Everyone at the Fed or Powell himself has an incentive to bring rates lower even at the risk of reflation.
00:09:10.974 - 00:10:03.994, Speaker C: So yeah, I think right here, right now, it's leaning towards that softer path. But ultimately the policy responses that monetary folks or central bank officials have and the fiscal response function that people have to a weakening economy is inflationary. So you cut rates for more folks, start to think about buying houses, housing becomes a little bit more affordable. That might lead to more supply coming into the market, but it also might mean that people are more aggressive with buying. It might raise asset prices. And so when you bring in easing, you do bring about some reflation risk. And if people are losing their jobs aggressively cause of AI or cause of some other random thing, the government's gonna be like, oh, okay, unemployment benefits, we gotta jack that up.
00:10:03.994 - 00:10:23.974, Speaker C: Earned income tax credit, all these social safety nets and stuff. As the economy deteriorates, it's like, where's my stimulus? And that's inflationary. But I guess it really does come down to the election right now. Cause there's just a lot of paths just lead to who's gonna end up being president.
00:10:24.834 - 00:10:32.588, Speaker B: Cause you're not gonna change that much with new policy on the ground in the economy between June and November, right?
00:10:32.636 - 00:10:35.780, Speaker C: Not likely, not likely. But if you're desperate, you might.
00:10:35.852 - 00:10:36.764, Speaker B: Yeah, we might try.
00:10:36.844 - 00:10:38.524, Speaker C: You might try, yeah, but it's hard.
00:10:38.564 - 00:10:42.516, Speaker B: For the real outcomes, though. We're still, you know, they take longer than that to materialize. Yeah.
00:10:42.540 - 00:10:52.236, Speaker C: I mean, realistically, like for Congress or president to enact something that hits people's wallets by the time of the election, like, it takes a while. Like, even if.
00:10:52.300 - 00:10:56.396, Speaker B: Right. Even if you pass something or do enact something besides, like, the mailing the.
00:10:56.420 - 00:10:59.700, Speaker C: Checks directly to people, everything else takes a while.
00:10:59.772 - 00:11:35.908, Speaker B: They're still spending. They're still spending the information infrastructure bill money. The states, a lot of that money was pushed out of states that haven't actually spent it yet either, which has contributed to some of the stubbornness. Let me ask you a question about the fixed income and the treasuries. There's an index that I follow that is just been down bad, down 50% or something over a couple of years of us treasuries. When do these become a buy, in your mind, or do we. I think it's almost consensus to consensus, or at least on social media and stuff that you don't want to own treasuries.
00:11:35.956 - 00:11:37.744, Speaker C: Like, oh my gosh, look at the fiscal situation.
00:11:38.124 - 00:11:39.788, Speaker B: This has to reverse at some point, right?
00:11:39.836 - 00:11:51.172, Speaker C: Yeah. So your question really comes down to, like, what point in the curve are you buying or thinking about buying? Is it the back end, which is, let's say, seven years in great.
00:11:51.268 - 00:11:52.012, Speaker B: 1030.
00:11:52.108 - 00:12:42.144, Speaker C: Yeah, that type of stuff. Or is it front end? Focus, zero to five. And I think zero to five for cash allocation is totally reasonable. But if you're thinking about any time of greater duration, like, I would not touch long end bonds with a ten foot pole because you just think about like, what has inflation averaged over the past, like three, four years, like, in real terms to you. Right. And those bonds are not gonna keep up with where inflation is going to realize over time and, like, asset values. And so your best hedge for protecting your purchasing power of dollars is not buying ten year treasuries at 432 in yield when implied inflation is only like two and a half percent.
00:12:42.144 - 00:13:19.922, Speaker C: There are just better ways to store money. And so I'm just not a fan of owning long end treasuries. And it's really, you know, this is a concept for a later podcast, but essentially the US is engaged in synthetic yield curve control. A lot of other economies, they will do it overtly. Like the Japanese, when they had yield curve control on their ten year point, they would buy bonds if the yield surpassed a certain level. Right, right. And they would fix that ten year point at a specific point in the US, it's, they do it a little bit differently now.
00:13:19.922 - 00:14:17.840, Speaker C: They manage the back end of the treasury curve via regulations, via treasury policy as well. In terms of when Yellen decides what point of the curve to issue, she's going to be like, okay, this thing is breaking down in price. I'm not going to sell more of these than I really have to. And then you've got the treasury buyback operations as well, which is a way of cash managing, but it's also a way of just managing the liquidity. It's also like the Fed has an ongoing mandate to have market open operations in case stuff starts to trade crazy. And then you've got the ultimate way that they guide it, which is inflation expectations. They pay attention to where breakevens are priced and where the market thinks inflation is going to be, and they tell people what they forecast in their summary of economic projections, where they think inflation is going to be, the long run dots are going to be.
00:14:17.840 - 00:15:08.506, Speaker C: And they try to keep that back end anchored at a reasonable level. So through these mechanisms, not all of which I've stated, but they synthetically try to manage the yield curve so that it doesn't get out of hand, aka it's not really reflective of the true price of ten year credit risk to the us government net of inflation expectations. It just that point in the curve, there's no value in it for me. Some would argue that we're headed into crazy deflation, economy is going to downtick, et cetera. But everything I know about governments and central banks tells me that they are trying to kick the can down the road. That is their natural inclination. They are going to push things as far down as possible, which ultimately is going to be inflationary.
00:15:08.506 - 00:15:15.508, Speaker C: And I couldn't justify owning that paper personally.
00:15:15.586 - 00:15:20.624, Speaker B: I hear you. Well, we got what, CPI next week and FOMC the week after.
00:15:20.704 - 00:16:17.214, Speaker C: And the most important thing though, coming up is non farm payroll Friday. And you're starting. So the jolts data, for example, today had weakness in healthcare and some hospitality stuff. But essentially those are components that have been really strong in non farm payrolls. And so I'm expecting to see some weakness in the NFP data. But again, so much of this data is just like how much of it do you really believe and how much weight do you put on it? Because more than ever there's just distortions, like how many jobs are created every time a sole proprietorship is created, like the birth death ratio and stuff and the sampling. And like how come all the revisions are always, like, low, so there's a lot of, like, doubt around the data.
00:16:17.214 - 00:16:23.342, Speaker C: But if you look at the high frequency stuff, the indeed job data, the jolts, opening data like it's pointing to weaker.
00:16:23.398 - 00:16:24.062, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:24.238 - 00:16:25.830, Speaker C: So I think we'll come and solve.
00:16:25.862 - 00:16:39.992, Speaker B: All right, so NFP this week, Friday, CPI next week, FOMC the week after, is that right? Middle of, middle of June? I believe so, yeah, I think so, too. And we'll be here to see what happens.
00:16:40.088 - 00:16:40.632, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:16:40.688 - 00:16:49.844, Speaker B: Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Trading, my friend, thank you so much. Let's go now to my friend Nick Carter, partner at Castle Island Ventures. Nick, welcome back to Galaxy Brains.
00:16:50.264 - 00:16:53.336, Speaker A: Thank you, Alex. Thanks for inviting me back on. Glad to be here.
00:16:53.480 - 00:17:17.736, Speaker B: I always love having you on. It's your third appearance on Galaxy Brains, one of our first guests, I think, way back in the summer of 2022, and then you came on in the fall in New York. But I think it was one of the last episodes before we started doing video on this podcast. It was, if I recall, like only a week or two before FTX collapsed. So it's been 18 months almost.
00:17:17.800 - 00:17:21.760, Speaker A: My gosh, what did you talk about last time? I don't even remember.
00:17:21.912 - 00:17:25.680, Speaker B: I don't really either. So much has changed. Yeah.
00:17:25.792 - 00:17:26.744, Speaker A: My goodness.
00:17:26.904 - 00:17:38.414, Speaker B: Probably stablecoins. I think you guys were just starting to really bang the drum on the stablecoin. Well, you had put out. When did you guys put out your crypto dollars report?
00:17:38.794 - 00:17:44.130, Speaker A: Well, that was in 2020. That was one. It was a while after that, believe.
00:17:44.162 - 00:18:10.954, Speaker B: It was that long ago. Yeah, because. All right, well, it's. In either case, it's been a long time. And in that time since we last talked, obviously FTX collapsed, and then we endured a regulatory onslaught from a variety of agencies, including Operation Chokepoint 2.0, which you coined in the pirate wires sheets. I don't know, on the website, I guess, technically, but in the pages of pirate wires.
00:18:10.954 - 00:18:57.864, Speaker B: And then, of course, an ongoing sort of enforcement driven regulatory front from the SEC in particular. So we'll talk about that. But just in the last few weeks, and we've talked about it on our show, you've talked about it on, on the brink. It seemed there's been some pivot, right? Cause you had the SAB 121 vote sail through both houses of Congress. You had tons of Congress members vote, I for fit 21 bill, you had the ETH. The last minute, it seemed ETF sort of approval process kick in and then eventual approvals. And of course, the former president embracing crypto as a political issue.
00:18:57.864 - 00:19:05.014, Speaker B: What's your take? Is it an actual regulatory pivot? Um. What's your take on the last three weeks in the regulatory world?
00:19:05.714 - 00:19:56.374, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, there's. What were there five major things that happened? So the ECTF was trending towards disapproval. And I don't know why people are clowning on the Bloomberg boys for getting that wrong, quote, unquote, because sometimes unexpected things happen. So you couldn't have expected beforehand that Trump would loudly endorse crypto and the Biden admin would react. So the unexpected change from the SEC, which was clearly driven by a directive, probably from someone in the Biden campaign, someone senior, that you couldn't have expected that to happen. So as far as I'm concerned, they were still right up until something very unexpected happened, which nobody could have forecasted.
00:19:56.374 - 00:20:26.308, Speaker A: The other things that happened. Saab 121, repeal, passed both houses and was vetoed. Fit 21 passed the House. Unclear fate in the Senate. Groomberg is forced to announce his resignation, although he hasn't resigned. And Biden admin says they want to be collaborative on crypto. But what actually occurred, I mean, the legislation didn't pass.
00:20:26.308 - 00:21:07.852, Speaker A: Right. The Biden admin carried through their threat to veto. Fit 21 has a very unclear path through the Senate. Yes, you had senior democrats defect on Saab 121, including Chuck Schumer, which is very interesting. But the only thing that's materially happened is the ETH ETF pending approval. And interestingly, you know, the Biden admin did veto Saab 121 repeal, or Biden himself did. That was after Trump was indicted or was found guilty.
00:21:07.852 - 00:21:52.150, Speaker A: Right. So my read on this is that they revalued. They figured that Trump's guilty verdict would reduce his electoral chances by a couple of percentage points. And they started panicking less about the electoral impact of being hostile to crypto. So that's my guess, is the Biden admin realized that crypto was a wedge issue, which Trump could use to bash them. And they thought it would cost them votes in some swing states and maybe votes in the Senate, and they felt it would drive a lot of fundraising activity, which it is. I mean, fair shake is the largest single issue pact, the second largest single issue pact.
00:21:52.150 - 00:22:16.106, Speaker A: Now it's really big. And then they. So they had become complacent. They panicked a little bit. They made noises about a rapprochement with crypto. And when Trump was finally found guilty, they kind of eased off a little bit. They felt that the election was maybe safer than it had been.
00:22:16.106 - 00:22:38.702, Speaker A: And to me, it looks like there's not that significant of concessions being made to the crypto space. So I'm sort of not that optimistic on the Biden admins supposed pivot here. What has materially transpired is really just the ETF thing and nothing else so far.
00:22:38.878 - 00:23:19.226, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's right. I've sort of been viewing it as a political strategy shift and pivot rather than a policy shift and pivot. But you're right. I mean, that would have, I think, been enshrined as very obviously true had Biden either signed sab 120 one's overturn or done nothing and let it lapse into law. It does make you wonder, the veto late on a Friday following, I guess, theoretically good news for the Biden campaign with Trump's conviction that maybe it has halted. I still feel that we're in a different place, but it's something to watch for. Sure.
00:23:19.226 - 00:23:39.790, Speaker B: And the amount of money, you have to think maybe a counterbalance to that. Um, maybe we. That idea that maybe it isn't a full political shift, or at least anymore, is the amount of money that Trump has raised since, uh, you know, both his crypto pivot, but also probably more so this conviction. Right. I mean, something like $300 million, I saw in a couple days. Crazy.
00:23:39.862 - 00:24:10.170, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, yeah. I do think the Democrats are now going to message a softer tone on crypto. And I also do think the Warren wing of the party has, to a certain degree, lost power, specifically with the Senate vote on sab one two, on senior Democrats defecting and the Fit 21 act being told to vote with their conscience in the House and with the Grunberg pending resignation. Still hasn't resigned.
00:24:10.322 - 00:24:16.294, Speaker B: This is from the FDIC. Right. He's technically the acting chairman of the FCC or the FTIC.
00:24:16.594 - 00:24:34.956, Speaker A: He's the chair of the FDIC. He was Obama's chair. He's now Biden's chair. And there was a real scandal there. I mean, the internal report that was released is damning. I mean, 10% of FDIC staff complained about some form of harassment. 10% of the staff.
00:24:35.100 - 00:25:16.334, Speaker B: It was like hazing, sexual harassment. I mean, one of the weirdest things that came out of that FDIC scandal. And by the way, right, it's not allegations against him specifically committing them, but it's his leadership, you know, during presiding over a, I guess, a multi decade environment of harassing and improper behavior, of which he was the chair for many of those years. One of the details that came out that really blew my mind from that was that the FDIC owns a hotel in Washington. Yeah, I guess the bank examiners, because they're all over the country. Because banks are all over the country. I guess they have to come back to touch base in Washington so often that at some point they decided to buy an entire hotel.
00:25:16.334 - 00:25:19.590, Speaker B: And it was there that a lot of bad behavior happened.
00:25:19.782 - 00:26:10.282, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, pretty surprising, really. Think of bank examiners and financial regulators as pretty sober people. But apparently there was, like a ridiculous bro culture there. And Groomberg himself did face complaints historically, not about sexual harassment, but just about bullying of subordinates. I don't know how related that is. But anyway, initially when the allegations came out, the Democrats did circle the wagons around him because the FDIC is tasked with enforcing the key tenet of the Biden admins strategy on banking and financial regulation, which is targeting political adversaries via bank regulation. I mean, this is very well established.
00:26:10.282 - 00:26:57.424, Speaker A: It was established on a choke .1.0 under Obama when they were targeting businesses known to be conservative leaning, or they were targeting, for instance, firearms manufacturers and some nonpartisan stuff like adult businesses. And then this time around, with choke point two, point zero, the targeting expanded to crypto firms. And it's still the case that banks doing business with crypto firms face a far higher risk of examination from the FDIC. And it's even gone beyond that now to banks that deal with fintechs and embedded finance or banking as a service. Even just this week. Evolve bank appears to be in trouble.
00:26:57.424 - 00:27:50.714, Speaker A: I can't tell you how many banks I know where they had a digital team or a crypto team or a fintech team, and those individuals left the firm as the bank furloughed their crypto strategy because they just didn't want to run the risk of facing an examination or closure or due to FDIC harassment. So this is still going on, and Groomberg is still in power. He said he would resign if Biden announced a successor, but he was carrying out political orders from the progressives, from the Warren camp. And so initially, they didn't want him to resign, even though he was facing this ridiculous scandal. Finally, they acknowledged that it was probably too much to bear and that he would have to leave.
00:27:51.134 - 00:28:11.344, Speaker B: It's crazy putting it on the president like that. Doesn't that seem to be shifting? Like, if you do something, let's say you work for me and you do something you know you should resign for, but instead you say, well, I'll resign as soon as Alex, you know, tells me to resign or appoint someone to replace me. Now it's like all of a sudden on the White House to get rid of this guy. Sounds more like fired, basically.
00:28:12.084 - 00:28:36.944, Speaker A: Yeah. I could actually see Grunberg staying in that position until the election or even the lame duck session. There is also an issue with the banks right now where they're. Apparently hundreds of banks are insolvent. Again, there's headlines coming out. So the FDIC is going to have to take a very active role in that. Yet again, the kind of regional banking crisis is not over.
00:28:36.944 - 00:28:51.116, Speaker A: It's unclear what the best path forward would be. I could see that being ammunition for Groomberg saying he has to stay in the role because they sort of need his oversight and their stewardship, and they can be leaderless throughout a crisis like that. Right.
00:28:51.140 - 00:29:17.096, Speaker B: Well, at least in a situation like that, we'd hope we'd have steady and competent leadership that is widely supported. If anything, we know, even if Grunberg were to stay, you know, specifically because of that, we know he's lost the support of many, many of his constituents in Congress, for example. So, yeah, that's just a wild one. I can't believe it took so long. That scandal was being written about last year. That was a while ago.
00:29:17.160 - 00:29:39.142, Speaker A: And it's kind of odd to me that that's the thing that caused Groomberg's termination. The much bigger scandal is Operation Choke point, which, by the way, that was a name that the Obama administration. Administration came up with. That wasn't something that we came up with. They chose to call it something incredibly sinister, Operation Choke point.
00:29:39.198 - 00:30:32.992, Speaker B: Let me ask you something about this, because there was that Supreme Court ruling just recently that the ACLU won as the attorneys, they represented the National Rifle association against, I forget who a state was it a state? I think it was New York state. And the idea was that the state had basically made it, although not illegal, had pressured people not to join the NRA, and basically pressured the NRA's activities in general, while not actually using the law. Right. But de facto making it impossible for people to interact with the NRA or hurt their careers and whatnot. And the Supreme Court ruled unanimously 90, that that behavior from the state was a violation of the First Amendment, that pressure campaigns by government to suppress otherwise lawful activities. In this case, free speech is illegal. Right.
00:30:32.992 - 00:31:21.810, Speaker B: Do you think there's an overlap here with what's happened from the various banking regulators and Operation Choke? .2.0 because as far as I know, maybe the OCC, because they rescinded the Brian Brooks guidance, is maybe they actually do prohibit national banks from touching blockchains in some way. But most of those things we saw last year in 23, the joint letters on January 3, and then I think January 27 from the Fed, OCC, FDIC, those were really just like, if you do this, we're going to, like, we're going to come and investigate the crap out of you. It was mostly what it said. Right. It was a strong deterrent, and we have to assume, and maybe you have heard that there was much more explicit things said behind the scenes. Does that feel like what this court was just saying about that other issue to you?
00:31:22.002 - 00:32:31.144, Speaker A: Yeah, the NRA case is highly salient, in my opinion, because this is the strategy. Those letters that were written, I think, just gave those agencies air cover, kind of political air cover, to engage in their campaign of intimidation. They said that dealing with crypto would threaten the safety and soundness of these banks. It was kind of funny because the banks safety and soundness was ultimately threatened by the rapid rise in interest rates, which caused their fixed income portfolios to sell off. Wasn't really a crypto thing, although they did try and blame the collapse of SVB and Silvergate and signature on crypto, which, in my opinion, had very little to do with it. But, yeah, the real tactic involves going behind the scenes, giving informal guidance to the leadership teams of these banks, thuggishly telling them, if you serve crypto, or even if you serve fintech, you will face investigation, you'll face higher costs to do business, and you'll probably be out of business. And that is not the way things should work.
00:32:31.144 - 00:33:06.574, Speaker A: If there is guidance, it should be written into law. Congress should pass the law. Congress could pass law saying banks can't deal with crypto. At least that would be valid from a democratic standpoint. But this is much worse. This is an executive agency kind of going haywire, taking the law into their own hands, rewriting the law and using threats and intimidation to basically persuade banks to not do business with crypto. And everybody that's an entrepreneur or an operator in this industry has been affected by this.
00:33:06.574 - 00:33:42.444, Speaker A: Everyone in the US, and to banks, crypto is now utterly toxic. And this problem isn't getting any less worse, in my opinion. It started in November 22, around the time of the FTX collapse, when the Biden admin finally felt politically empowered to do this. But it hasn't actually abated much. In fact, more and more banks that I'm aware of that had a crypto practice are terminating that crypto practice. So it's still, I thought last year, the period of maximum pressure had ended. It's still ongoing.
00:33:42.444 - 00:33:45.124, Speaker A: It's still as bad as it ever was.
00:33:46.264 - 00:34:03.880, Speaker B: Well, it seems like. I think one of the scariest things about it, too, wasn't just that banks can't themselves take custody crypto, whether because of SAB 121 or because of prudential rules or can't interact with blockchains or do their own stablecoin. That's all not great.
00:34:03.912 - 00:34:06.816, Speaker A: They can't even do business. They can't even do business with crypto.
00:34:06.840 - 00:34:06.952, Speaker C: Right?
00:34:06.968 - 00:34:12.284, Speaker B: We're talking dollar accounts with companies, legal companies.
00:34:12.784 - 00:34:41.941, Speaker A: I mean, every aspect of it has been eliminated. SAB 2121 says the big custody banks can't custody crypto on behalf of clients. Then you have the Fed's guidance saying, if you want to do stablecoin stuff as a bank, you need to get a permission slip from us, which is kind of like when you're in school and you ask the teacher if you can use the bathroom, and they say, well, you have to get a permission slip, and they just never give you one. So, you know the hall pass, they.
00:34:41.957 - 00:34:48.637, Speaker B: Used to call this the hall pass in my school. Well, you can't go to the bathroom because you got to walk in the hallway and you can't walk in the hallway without a hall pass.
00:34:48.805 - 00:35:26.164, Speaker A: So it's like them saying they'll give you a hall pass, but they just never, ever give you one. And then, of course, there's the more insidious thing, which is saying, yeah, you can't even deal with dollar banking for crypto businesses. That's too risky. So it's every single aspect that's walling off the banks. And this totally empowers foreign banks. It empowers foreign stablecoin issuers, it encourages us firms to go overseas, and it eliminates the largest, most credible custodians from custody and crypto, which is also a bad thing. It's not sound policy, regardless of whether you like crypto or not.
00:35:27.344 - 00:35:45.364, Speaker B: Let's talk about stable coins. We've got some other interesting topics to talk with you about. AI in particular, we're going to spend some time on. But let's talk about stablecoins. Since we brought it up here, a lot has changed, certainly since you guys wrote crypto dollars in 2020. We wrote a report called digital dollars in 2022. A lot has changed since then.
00:35:45.364 - 00:35:59.994, Speaker B: The market is still dominated by tether and circle, but, but lots of interesting new entrants. Now, what are the trends that are most interesting to you in stablecoins? And are you guys doing any new research when crypto dollars 2.0?
00:36:00.294 - 00:37:13.876, Speaker A: Yeah, it's coming. We have commissioned a research paper with a pollster, actually, we're doing a survey of emerging market countries, users in those countries, to determine how they use stable coins, specifically whether they're using stable coins just to get access to crypto, or as I suspect, they're using stable coins or ordinary business activities for what I call crypto dollarization, engaging in currency substitution to escape their local currencies, moving into dollars. And they're using stables for cross border flows, basically going outside of the correspondent banking system and transacting directly with counterparties in other countries, whether it's for trade invoicing or things like that. So we expect that will drop in July. No ones ever done a study like that before. We know from on chain data that the usage of stablecoins is the killer app, and it has decoupled from crypto macro trends. So stablecoin usage grew throughout the bear market even as exchange volumes came down, which was indicative that stablecoin usage was growing regardless of crypto, which means theres a cohort of people out there that are using stablecoins, not just for crypto stuff.
00:37:13.876 - 00:37:22.468, Speaker A: But we intend to prove this with data. So we are very excited about this study. We'll have preliminary results soon.
00:37:22.636 - 00:37:58.578, Speaker B: That's gonna be amazing. That's like a core question, I think, not stable. That's a distinguishing speculation from sort of non speculative use cases is always a big topic. And in stables, I can see how that'd be huge. But this in general, the nature of adoption and quantifying it and then understanding the nature of it is something that I still think is sorely lacking. I've been wanting to do a general cryptocurrency ownership and usage poll, probably in western countries, for different reasons, which is to show how many people, and not stop relying on the crypto.com survey or whatever.
00:37:58.578 - 00:38:05.094, Speaker B: There's a couple out there, but they're Internet surveys. But I suspect there is a lot of usage.
00:38:05.564 - 00:38:24.624, Speaker A: Yeah, most of those. There have been some surveys done. Coinbase did one, consensys did one, Nidig has done one. There's like varying levels of rigor there. Mostly they're Internet surveys. We contracted with one of the best pollsters that exists, one of the most rigorous ones. So we expect our data will have a very high quality.
00:38:24.624 - 00:39:14.264, Speaker A: And yeah, I'm very excited. This is a question I get from policymakers all the time. They acknowledge that stablecoins are a thing, but they kind of refuse to acknowledge that there is real economic modalities to the usage. Real I mean, not that trading crypto is not real, but theres this perceived distinction between people using stable coins for crypto economy speculation or for defi yield farming or whatever, and between real economic usage substituting what you might otherwise be using fintech or the bank system for. We intend to prove that there is real usage. We know this already. Anecdotally, of course, we have startups that do this, startups in the remittance space, b two b transfer space.
00:39:14.264 - 00:39:23.432, Speaker A: Just startups that are giving people access to dollars. They're earning a yield on it. We know that this is happening, but we want to prove it with data.
00:39:23.628 - 00:39:41.004, Speaker B: Yeah, I can't wait to see that. Let's talk about AI. You wrote a great post on X.com which I, you know, the well known app X. It was really interesting. Was this yesterday? Yesterday's post? I think you posted it. I think I read it this morning.
00:39:41.004 - 00:40:26.696, Speaker B: I'm just going to summarize very briefly here, but I'd love you to actually help me explain it. You said the Nvidia rally has gone from incredibly impressive to actually scaring you a bit. Not for AI safety reasons. You proceed to talk about a lot of the clear things that you learned after going through your own journey, learning about AI, about how important and additive it can be, that it empowers capital relative to labor, so it quite simply expands capabilities. You said investors missing out on one of the biggest themes of the decade, if they're not an AI. My favorite one you mentioned, I'm just scrolling it here, was that it would rescue the US from its demographic malaise and its debt overhang. I don't know.
00:40:26.696 - 00:40:36.964, Speaker B: I really want to ask you about this post and more about AI. What am I missing about the post? What was it? I didn't get to the bottom where you started talking about what scares you? What scares you about the AI rally?
00:40:37.344 - 00:41:06.308, Speaker A: Yeah, what scares me is making human capital obsolete in all across the economy. So that's what scares me. So basically, I think the Nvidia rally is justified by Nvidia's fundamentals. It's actually not a function of multiple expansion, believe it or not. In fact, multiples have contracted, the fundamentals have grown. You could argue that the multiples were already high. But I think it's confirmation that AI is an enormous theme.
00:41:06.308 - 00:41:49.894, Speaker A: Even though within the AI sector venture investments, I do believe that capital is being incinerated right now, especially at the foundation model companies. Those models look somewhat fungible to me. I'm not sure that there's long term value in any of the specific models, but we can leave that aside for now. The thing that worries me is that AI, we know it's successful. We know it's being incorporated into basically every single application. And the direction of travel is very clear in terms of making human capital obsolete. I called out a number of industries where I think basically human labor is already irrelevant.
00:41:49.894 - 00:42:15.588, Speaker A: It's already been surpassed. Transcription is a great example. Translation is another good example. Of course, it's taking time for these to settle and for adoption to emerge. And then there's other industries where we can see the direction of travel. So obviously ride sharing, taxis, trucking in the future. It's clear that AI, full self driving works today.
00:42:15.588 - 00:43:05.576, Speaker A: That's only just become clear in the last six months or so. But even white collar industries and legal advice and medicine even, believe it or not, I think it's very, very clear that AI will surpass human capabilities. If you think about what medicine is, at least diagnostics, you're just ingesting data. You're basically using a model to create a diagnosis. Whether it's image data or other diagnostic data, AI will obviously surpass human capabilities. They're in legal. You are taking requests from a client and you're cross referencing it against a body of established legal precedent or research and providing a conclusion.
00:43:05.576 - 00:43:55.354, Speaker A: Some recommendations in software engineering programming. Obviously, AI vastly enhances the capabilities of sort of senior programmers because they don't have to do this grunt work anymore, and it makes irrelevant, you know, more junior programmers. So there's like a number of white collar elite professions that AI really challenges. And I think you can expand that to sort of the whole white collar service economy and then of course the blue collar portion of the economy. You can see how AI would affect that. So my fear is that AI will continue to be enormously successful and render obsolete large portions of the labor force. I know people like to say, well, everyone can be retrained or humans can adapt.
00:43:55.354 - 00:44:49.624, Speaker A: I don't think that's strictly true. Not everyone can become a senior software engineer, and not everybody can learn to use AI, unfortunately. So I think we have to start looking forward to reckon with what society looks like once this workforce transition occurs. What happens when 20% of the workforce is furloughed because they are redundant? I draw a comparison to the industrial revolution. Everyone says, well, that didn't put anyone out of work. That just created new specialization, new jobs, etcetera. But it did put a big part of the labor force out of work, which is agricultural animals, horses, and obviously it didn't really matter that we could put those horses out to pasture, so to speak, but you can't put a large portion of the labor force out to pasture.
00:44:49.624 - 00:45:16.984, Speaker A: We have to find something to do with them. So the TLDR is, I expect, reprisals against capital. I do believe that capital will be dramatically empowered relative to labor, including elite white collar labor, salaried workers. And the question is, what does that world look like? Can we prepare for that world? I think it will empower a lot of socialist dynamics actually, in developed economies. So that's the fear.
00:45:18.324 - 00:46:14.024, Speaker B: That's a big fear, and it's scary. I saw there's a meme that was going around that was I think it was actually a quote in a newspaper that being shared widely, and it was a woman quoted saying that she doesn't want AI to do her art and her creative music so that she can spend all day washing dishes and doing laundry. She wants AI to do laundry and dishes so she doesn't spend all day doing art and music. Because right now it looks like, I think for a lot of people that we just sort of have these toys, right? You got mid journey and stable diffusion and dolly, right? And you've got, like, I like to ask chat GPT I write the plot of a movie in two sentences, and I say, write me a synopsis or a script, right? And I know people are using it for coding and it's starting to get embedded, but it feels a little toyish. But you're not concerned about that staying toyish. You're concerned about it far expanding? No?
00:46:14.064 - 00:46:52.924, Speaker A: Yeah, we know that AI has exceeded human capabilities in specific verticals, obviously, starting with things like chat games, chess, go, et cetera. But they are coming to match human capabilities. And in the next five years, probably, AI will exceed human capabilities in virtually every vertical. And at that point, there's no coming back from that. It's not like humans can then get smarter relative to the AI. Like, the AI will have won, and it won't just exceed our capabilities by a little bit, it'll exceed them by a huge amount. So for now, we're still in the arms raise period.
00:46:52.924 - 00:47:49.664, Speaker A: People think, oh, yeah. The legal advice dispensed by AI isn't quite at par with a partner at a big law firm, but AI is obviously infinitely better at querying large datasets than humans. So once we figure out how to incorporate AI models into things like legal advice, there's no going back from that. And that doesn't mean humans will be totally relevant. Like, there's still taste, and there's still, you know, a layer of advice and expertise that needs to be layered on. But that does mean that you'll just need many fewer individuals to deliver the same service or an even better service. I even see this in my own practice, data science, big data tools where I would have previously needed to data scientists or five analysts to do these tasks for me, now I can do it myself because I've noticed 100 x to 1000 x speedup in certain data tasks.
00:47:49.664 - 00:48:22.614, Speaker A: So that concerns me. And I don't strictly see how 50% of the workforce could sort of reprogram themselves and learn to harness this technology for taxi drivers. If in ten years time you're just looking at fleets of self driving taxis, what are these people going to do? I think the answer is there'll be a societal push for EBI or for Covid era transfers to resume, so expect the size of government to double or treble. Basically.
00:48:25.674 - 00:49:01.484, Speaker B: One thing I've heard about your point, not as a counter, as a lingering question, if we still do need the elite partner at the law firm or the senior software engineer, and they're at least in the interim until total AGI or something merely enabled by AI, and so there's less of a need for junior associates to do legal precedent research or junior coders, where are we going to get the senior software engineers of the future or the legal experts of the future if there's not a funnel to train the junior people under them?
00:49:02.074 - 00:50:03.520, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great question. I think it drives a huge gulf between people that are more established in their careers and can leverage these tools to their benefit and the new generation. And you already see this look on Reddit and look at the forums for like, CS grads that are entering the workforce. There's a huge amount of disillusionment and fear there because they use GitHub, copilot and things like that, and they realized that the basic tools to become an early web developer or software engineer, a lot of that stuff is now redundant and is already being done at human levels by AI. So I do think it drives a huge gulf between folks that are established in the careers and people that are trying to become established. That doesn't mean that you should be totally disillusioned. I mean, I think any bright young individual can learn how to harness AI and use this to their benefit.
00:50:03.520 - 00:50:10.644, Speaker A: But I think by the numbers it still challenges that generation of new graduates.
00:50:11.344 - 00:50:18.964, Speaker B: Are there any verticals or professions that you think will be more immune to AI?
00:50:19.884 - 00:51:00.982, Speaker A: I mean, anything requiring like physical manual labor. I was actually thinking about capital allocation. That's obviously the business that we're in, at least on the venture side. I feel okay about it because my job is basically to make friends with people and to be someone that is well liked and that seems like it's more resistant. But, you know, it's kind of hard to imagine any profession that goes untouched. I mean, even factory workers, like factories, are being automated. So even being a hands on kind of blue collar professional, you're not immune at that point.
00:51:01.158 - 00:51:33.074, Speaker B: What about some of the more creative professions, you know, literature, music? I know there are some startups that do AI driven music, and some of I've heard are decent, but is that something, I mean, you know, one of the, I think, utopian ideas I've heard as well, you get rid of all the jobs that are real worky and lifty and heavy. But maybe the, maybe the, you know, film, art, maybe everybody just becomes an artist. You know, we all get a Ubi and we sit at home painting. Like, is that possible, or are they going to be better painters and artists and musicians than us too?
00:51:33.494 - 00:51:52.014, Speaker A: That's what we thought. And then the first things that AI ended up being extremely good at were arbitrary text generation, including creative writing, which is why essay writing is now irrelevant. That's like a thing that doesn't happen anymore. They're not doing that unless we want to force, unless we want to make students write their essays by hand, which we can.
00:51:52.054 - 00:51:54.174, Speaker B: Yeah. In a room. Just on that point, I did.
00:51:54.214 - 00:51:55.134, Speaker A: They still know.
00:51:55.294 - 00:52:17.074, Speaker B: I have seen people in college post that their schools are using AI generation or AI recognition technology, and I saw a couple that were lamenting like, I definitely did not use AI on this. And it's coming back as AI generated, which actually says the reverse to me, which is like, it's. They're frankly going to become indistinguishable if they're not already.
00:52:17.734 - 00:52:30.406, Speaker A: Yeah, there's no way to watermark AI content. It's impossible. We have open source models, so you can't force models to include a watermark. This is actually a great segue into the crypto AI nexus, the interstate.
00:52:30.430 - 00:52:41.264, Speaker B: Let's go into that. Yeah, we hit it really well. So. Well, can crypto help with this then? Yeah, let's segue that way. We'll get back to the other big AI and crypto stuff happening, happening in a second.
00:52:41.724 - 00:53:14.584, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I touched on this on the post as well. This deserves a fuller treatment. But look, you can't know for a fact that some piece of content, whether it's image, video, music, text, is AI generated just by looking at it. It's impossible. The models are reaching parity with human ability and there's no way to do watermark or enforce watermarking. But so absent that, you have to assume that everything is fake. So we have to totally change our epistemic model.
00:53:14.584 - 00:53:41.544, Speaker A: We have to reverse it. Just because an image or some video looks real, that's not proof that it's real, because the cost to generate arbitrary content in any modality is zero now. So we have to do the opposite. Assume everything's fake and then only trust the stuff that has been attested to as real. And you don't strictly need a blockchain to do this. But I think a really interesting model would be. Let's just start with images.
00:53:41.544 - 00:54:29.778, Speaker A: You could have a module inside a smartphone that includes a bunch of metadata on the image, location data, biometrics. Maybe you do face id to sign a photo as you create it, timestamp data, and then you embed the hash of all that aggregate data into the blockchain at the time of creation. So I don't think this is completely foolproof, but at the very least, you know that this image was created by a person on a specific device at a specific time, maybe at a specific place. And the blockchain timestamp gives you credible attestation. So this is something I've actually been obsessed with for years. We've actually backed startups that have done this. I think that is one way.
00:54:29.778 - 00:55:16.016, Speaker A: And you can extend this to a bunch of other. Not just images, of course, but all kinds of things. I think eventually we're going to come to only trust attested content and then assume that all other content is fake. But we need a wholesale shifting of our epistemic standards to achieve that transition. For now, we're stuck in this really weird place where if you go on Facebook, remember Facebook? Barely all of Facebook is flooded with fake AI content and all these boomers being like, oh, that's such a cool picture, or whatever. It's all complete fake AI nonsense. So we're still stuck where people think just because there's an image or video that it's real.
00:55:16.016 - 00:55:21.364, Speaker A: Of course it's not. But people are unevenly coming to this realization.
00:55:22.734 - 00:56:13.504, Speaker B: Yeah, there was that image of Kate Middleton and her family that a few, maybe one or two months ago, that was run in all major newspapers in the UK and also abroad. And I guess it was determined after some people started pointing out some strange irregularities in the image that was actually heavily doctored and to the point where like major newspapers formally retracted the photo. You can imagine a very simple use case there. If they have the, this was the DSLR camera that it was taken on at this location. Just, it's a real photo. Like photojournalism makes a, this would be quite helpful and useful. And all those, you know, the Reuters and the AP's and whatnot, they have like giant databases of imagery, right? Like that they could maybe help kickstart this with too.
00:56:13.504 - 00:56:15.924, Speaker B: You could imagine that's something on their mind.
00:56:16.274 - 00:56:29.498, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think that photo was just photoshopped. I don't even think so too. But the difference is now that anybody, the cost to create any kind of image of anyone doing anything is now effectively zero.
00:56:29.626 - 00:56:40.690, Speaker B: Whereas before, that's actually the Photoshop artist, their job being disintermediated in the future, you could just use AI for it. But functionally from a sort of fake news authenticity standpoint, it's similar. Right?
00:56:40.882 - 00:57:38.654, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is why I actually think AI is saving the epistemic crisis that we're in. So we're in the post truth era. We're going to move to the post post truth era where now back in the day we didn't have Photoshop and so if there was an image or a video is assumed authentic, then we had this gulf of uncertainty which lasted from whenever to now. And now AI is accelerating us out of that gulf because now we're going to assume that everything's fake and we are going to have to rely on cryptographic signatures to determine that something's real, or at least to ascribe the creation of some content to an individual. So I'm actually very optimistic about it because I think it sort of forces us through and it means that we can finally acknowledge that, yes, content can be fake. And okay, here's the set of all the real content.
00:57:39.474 - 00:58:18.004, Speaker B: Yeah. You assume it's fake and you train everyone to look for proof that it's real. And lo and behold, we may have a technology that can help with that. Let's stick on this topic, Nick, of the overlap between AI and crypto, one headline I saw today, Coreweave, the large AI company and data center company computation company, is buying, or has a bid to buy core scientific, which is one of the biggest bitcoin mining firms and data center companies. You, I recall many years ago you were an investor in Corweave. What can you tell me about this deal? Or what is Corweave thinking with this acquisition in your mind?
00:58:18.504 - 00:58:57.560, Speaker A: Yeah, to be clear, I'm affiliated with both companies. Some early investor in Corweave and actually advise Corsi. It's very interesting because bitcoin miners are now able to throw out this Hail Mary where they're potentially able to repurpose some of their infrastructure, which they built for bitcoin mining, to AI. Historically, this has not been successful. In fact, core weave began as an Ethereum miner, and they were focusing just on high end GPU's. So they were able to effectuate this transition. As it transpired, when ETH did the merge, that was when AI actually took off.
00:58:57.560 - 00:59:52.196, Speaker A: And so the timing worked out great for them. But most other bitcoin miners, their infrastructure and their hard assets, ASICs, were obviously not suitable for generalized use cases, and their data centers were not suitable for AI or any HPC. Because a bitcoin mining data center can be a shack that you have some power, some transformers. An AI GPU data center requires cooling control, needs to be tier three or tier four. Data center needs redundancy. Everything that makes bitcoin mining interesting, like the ability to be intermittent, the ability to have downtime, those are very interesting factors for bitcoin mining and their ability to take power from the grid and be a benign consumer of energy on the grid and sell into ancillary services. That's not what you want for AI.
00:59:52.196 - 01:00:31.076, Speaker A: You want uptime, you want reliable power. And of course, there's significant cooling requirements. You need networking. So, bitcoin miners have historically struggled to deal with AI at all. Core size infrastructure was at a sufficiently high level where core weave was able to lease 200 power from them. That's very important for core weave because there's a huge bottleneck in the AI data center race right now, which is power. So it's funny because this is going to mirror the debate over bitcoin miners consuming power.
01:00:31.076 - 01:01:07.444, Speaker A: Now, all the people that are complaining about that, including digiconomist, are now complaining about AI using power. The exact same debate, basically a degrowther idea that using power is bad, although I think it's easier to make the case that they're doing something useful. In the case of AI, you don't have to be a bitcoin believer, but it's a fascinating story. And I joke about Corey, the largest or second largest crypto business is actually an AI business, because they started as a crypto firm, made this pivot into AI, and now they're an enormously successful business.
01:01:08.184 - 01:01:41.334, Speaker B: Yeah, it's incredible to see. I just remember you telling me about them as a small ethereum miner is how I thought of them when you were first getting involved with them. This was years ago, you guys had almost just recently started Castle island and I was still at Fidelity. The growth is incredible and I can't believe that especially Coresci was one of the biggest bitcoin mining firms, right? I mean they did go through a bankruptcy so I don't, regardless of how good they are at it or were at it, they're huge. We're talking massive data center capabilities.
01:01:41.994 - 01:02:13.472, Speaker A: Yeah what a very funny story there is in 2021. I was having dinner with the leadership of Core Sci and they actually had a deal with core reef back in the day to do some hosting with them. So they knew them and I said guys there's this AI startup, they pivoted out of ETH and they're doing AI and you have to buy them. I think they just raised it around 300 million valuation and core sigh was worth billions of dollars. And I said you need to buy them. Stop everything you're doing, buy them. They didnt.
01:02:13.472 - 01:02:35.000, Speaker A: And then core Sci went through restructuring, basically the equity was zeroed out. Core weave is now worth ten dollars to twenty billion dollars and they just put in a bid to buy core psi. Its really indicative of the disparate directions that bitcoin mining has gone versus AI data centers.
01:02:35.152 - 01:03:00.454, Speaker B: Its truly wild. You mentioned the electricity usage and digiconomist and the debates around bitcoin mining and electricity. Do you envision we'll see a department of energy report and perhaps a White House. We already had a White House. A White House. What do you call it? Presidential order or whatever about AI? Yeah, thank you. An executive order.
01:03:00.454 - 01:03:11.594, Speaker B: Sorry about AI, but did it mention electricity usage the way the crypto executive order did or is this still yet to come? And do you think we'll see. I mean significant pushback ultimately.
01:03:11.994 - 01:03:43.464, Speaker A: Yeah. It's actually very similar to chokepoint. Power was an easy way to go after the bitcoin miners. Of course the view was that they were consuming an excess amount of power relative to their social value. With AI it's a harder case to make because AI is obviously something that's very useful. But I felt that the Biden admin was trying to ultimately exercise control over bitcoin via the energy debate. And I think the same is the case for AI.
01:03:43.464 - 01:04:35.184, Speaker A: That's a very easy choke point so to speak, to target because there's only so many data centers and it's kind of easier to grapple with that than going to the models themselves or the software engineers. So if you look at all the layers of the stack where you could exercise control, the data centers and the utilities themselves is a place where you could, in theory, exercise control. So to me it's the same thing. And I am certain that we will see more noise made in the press and academia and policy about the power resource demands of AI, which will far exceed bitcoin mining. I mean, I think bitcoin mining in the US is less than 1% of power usage. At the most, it might be around 1%. I think AI will be in the five to 10% range.
01:04:35.184 - 01:05:25.772, Speaker A: I've long felt that, even though I won't get into the specifics, but yeah, it'll be really significant. And so we can expect to see kind of a social political backlash there. But also I believe that will be weaponized ultimately by the state. To the extent the state wants to control AI, they'll use the power angle to go after it. I always felt that was what was happening with bitcoin, which is why I thought, but the bitcoin mining debate, that's something that everyone should have cared about. It's not about bitcoin. It's about basically the government intruding on a private sector activity and expressing that utilities should be exercising discretion in terms of who's able to buy power, which is not something we normally.
01:05:25.772 - 01:05:54.400, Speaker A: That's not the way we normally think about power. Like any kind of utility. We don't say you can't make telephone calls that are about bitcoin, for instance, they were trying to make the case that you can't buy power. That's about bitcoin. This is the same thing, I believe that will happen with AI, especially as the resource demands grow. I think we should be extremely vigilant about this. And I think everybody missed a trick by not caring about bitcoin mining, because that was just a prelude to what was to come.
01:05:54.592 - 01:06:39.954, Speaker B: Yeah, if you think about the intermittent power of green energy, wind and solar in particular, they exacerbate this problem. Of the reasons why. I think some maturation has occurred, and particularly because of how successful Texas has been with their many bitcoin miners. There's been some maturation in the criticism and even some dampening of it, because people are actually realizing that you need these large, flexible loads, particularly because bitcoin mines can turn off so quickly, right, and also consume so much so quickly. So if the utility is need someone to come in and buy it right now, bam, they're there. If they need to give it to somebody else, they don't the bitcoin miners, by the way, it's not altruistic, it's purely economic. They have the ability to turn off much more granularly.
01:06:39.954 - 01:07:06.562, Speaker B: The AI's can't do that. Right. My understanding is what I'm being told. You can't just stop a job mid thing. Microsoft isn't going to turn off its machines. So you really a. It's still a case for there being a good purpose for large, flexible loads to be on these grids to help sort of supplement and buoy the demand that comes from AI in the face of this growing intermittent power generation.
01:07:06.562 - 01:07:19.054, Speaker B: But also, does it not demand and call for some kind of incredibly dense, highly productive, always on and green electricity generation source to be built in this country once again?
01:07:19.434 - 01:07:24.770, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I know what you're referring to. It's a rock, a glowing green rock.
01:07:24.802 - 01:07:26.554, Speaker B: I don't know what it actually looks like.
01:07:26.674 - 01:07:56.754, Speaker A: It's the greatest energy. Yeah. I mean, I think if you look at nuclear rods underwater, they're bluish. There's a name for this, but, yeah, I mean, this is actually a very interesting thing, is that bitcoin is a much better steward of the grid than currently AI data centers. Because bitcoin is a smart load. It can curtail at a moment's notice with no interruption. Because if you think about what bitcoin mining is, it's the same computational procedure done gajillions, I think, is the technical term of times a second.
01:07:56.754 - 01:08:00.382, Speaker A: It's a lot more than trillions. I don't even know what's above trillions.
01:08:00.438 - 01:08:04.118, Speaker B: It's crazy. We looked once per second, too. It's insane.
01:08:04.166 - 01:08:35.396, Speaker A: Yes. It's very large numbers of the same computation, of course, that's inherently interruptible. And the miners build their fleets around this and their data centers, so they can be very useful to the grids. I do agree that that's why the political pressure has abated significantly on bitcoin miners, because they've adapted. They've proven that you can be a huge buyer of power, but you can be very accretive to the grid. The challenge is for the AI data centers to learn from the bitcoin miners. I think the bitcoin miners set the template.
01:08:35.396 - 01:09:24.813, Speaker A: The question is, can you do model training or inference in a way that's interruptible? It's plausible to me that you could do model training in an interruptible manner. You could schedule loads for times when people aren't running their ac, for instance, because it's actually very predictable when power is going to be expensive. Or there's going to be grid scarcity for inference, as in when people consult the model. Once the model exists, it's harder for me to imagine how you could render your GPU fleet interruptible. Because if I'm using chat GPT, I want an answer now. I don't want an answer in 6 hours when the sun goes down or, and it cools down, people turn off their ac. So that's a challenge I would pose to the AI data center space.
01:09:24.813 - 01:09:35.553, Speaker A: I do think they'll have to evolve and learn to be a little bit more benign on the grid. Or as you say, we could build a huge nuclear fleet. That would also kind of solve the problem.
01:09:36.253 - 01:09:59.103, Speaker B: It's fascinating. Big changes in society, crypto driving them, stable coins driving them, AI, absolutely going to drive them. And I totally agree with your point that it's a much easier case to sell AI's usefulness than, say, bitcoin. You have to specifically understand and want and like bitcoin. But if I tell you that and proof of work.
01:09:59.213 - 01:10:02.004, Speaker A: And proof of work, that's true of a stake, right?
01:10:02.044 - 01:10:23.904, Speaker B: That's true and. But if I tell you that if we have this AI thing, like your, your relative's cancer will be found sooner or you'll be diagnosed better or your cars will be safer or. Right, since it's an easier sell. And it does seem, by the way, I'm not trying to trivialize those. Does seem like those are all going to be possible under a, with a, you know, big AI regime.
01:10:24.364 - 01:10:53.424, Speaker A: Yeah. And that's why I have no patience for the AI safety camp. Not to like, get into this enormous debate, but, but the safety has kind of assumed the static model of AI, where it doesn't transform the world in a positive direction and they fixate on the risk of extinction due to some super intelligent AI that goes haywire and kills everyone. But to me, the much bigger risk. Of course, I'm not trivializing the existential risk. Maybe there is some degree of that. I don't think so.
01:10:53.424 - 01:11:43.184, Speaker A: Actually, I am trivializing it. But to me, the greatest risk is that we don't advance healthcare and transportation and we don't create this enormous age of abundance because we're fearful of AI. And I think we're going to discover personalized drug therapies that are genetically tailored to every individual. I think it is plausible we could eradicate cancer or any number of diseases. We could build vaccine. I don't know if this will be popular with bitcoin is, but we could build vaccines that are far far more effective and personalized and tailored, and work with your genome and et cetera, and we could make physics discoveries and develop new ways to harness energy. The possibilities are literally endless.
01:11:43.184 - 01:12:09.744, Speaker A: I think this is a likelihood in our future. I think it will kick off in a huge wave of growth, GDP growth, rescue us from our debt crisis. So if we inhibit all of that because of these AI safety notions and means for strong government regulation, that's a catastrophe. That's a huge loss of potential human welfare. And that's the risk, I think, of AI safety.
01:12:11.084 - 01:12:34.854, Speaker B: Nick, before we wrap, we both just got back from Austin, Texas. I have to admit, I was going down there for one reason, and that was to watch Carter battle Hoffman at karate combat 46. Was it 46? And I was like, all right, I'll also go to the conference. I spoke at the conference. You were at the conference. We'll talk about the conference some other time. I think it was a good conference.
01:12:34.854 - 01:12:55.802, Speaker B: It was big. It showed the industry is still really here and out in force. But you did not get to have that fight despite training incredibly for it. Uh, David was injured during training, and so, you know, I'm not throwing any shade on David. I think he said it was a broken rib. I mean, that's, that could result in a punctured lung. That's a serious injury.
01:12:55.802 - 01:13:21.094, Speaker B: Um, tell us about your training regimen, though, because you put out one of the best videos I think I've ever seen. I was actually stunned at the level of, um, intensity in that video. And by the way, really shout out to you and the folks who, uh, shot and edited that video. It wasn't cringe at all. And I mean that sincerely. This is one of the most badass workout videos I've ever seen. What was that, your workout and training, like, for karate combat 46?
01:13:21.394 - 01:13:49.302, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, that video was produced by my friend Kayla, who's exceptional. So all credit to her, I just went to the gym and did what she said. It was very funny. A lot of people said that they thought the video was AI generated or that I had enhanced my muscles with AI or something. I promise you, it was real. So I took the fight with a two and a half months notice, and I decided to do a real camp.
01:13:49.302 - 01:14:17.474, Speaker A: I thought, well, I'm not going to get in there and embarrass myself. Like, okay, I might lose the fight, but I want to at least look somewhat trained. So the camp while I was here, and I had to travel a little bit, so I couldn't train literally every day. But a typical week would be six days of training. I would get one day off and three to 4 hours of working out a day, believe it or not. Wow. So I let all my social responsibilities slide.
01:14:17.474 - 01:15:10.110, Speaker A: Probably my work output suffered, frankly, and I did nothing for that period other than train, work, and recover. So a typical day would be resistance training in the morning, focus on muscular endurance, hitting the bags, and working on technique with my coach, and sprinting often in the middle of the day, because for boxing or karate, your cardio engine has to be extremely good. And then sparring. And I did sustain a bunch of injuries throughout the camp, which I'm still recovering from. I just didn't publicize them because I didn't want my opponent tease my injuries against me. But, yeah, I mean, it was grueling. It was very, very challenging.
01:15:10.110 - 01:15:22.074, Speaker A: It was just mentally very difficult to work out, do Zoom calls, work out Zoom calls, and then get the energy up to do my fourth workout of the day and get punched in the face a lot.
01:15:23.534 - 01:15:35.454, Speaker B: So the fight didn't happen. It was still a great fight. Joe Rogan was there, others. I saw some incredible fights. I saw a man get kicked in the head. That was the crazy. This is actually the first fight I've ever been to of any type.
01:15:35.454 - 01:15:46.034, Speaker B: So I was. Yeah, and I was, it was pretty intense and fun. I thought, do you have plans to fight again? Or I guess you haven't fought yet? Are you gonna, you're gonna be in karate again?
01:15:46.614 - 01:16:07.614, Speaker A: I didn't spend three months of my life training for nothing. You know, obviously there are some ancillary benefits, but I intend to fight. I want to prove to people that I can do it, and I'm not afraid to. So I have been offered to fight on the next influencer karate combat card in Nashville, which would be in July, so.
01:16:07.774 - 01:16:09.414, Speaker B: During bitcoin Nashville.
01:16:09.574 - 01:16:12.750, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's. They. Wow, the karate Khan.
01:16:12.782 - 01:16:13.038, Speaker B: Wow.
01:16:13.086 - 01:16:14.942, Speaker A: People are doing the crypto conference.
01:16:14.998 - 01:16:16.194, Speaker B: They know what they're doing.
01:16:16.734 - 01:16:17.182, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:16:17.238 - 01:16:17.550, Speaker B: Oh, man.
01:16:17.582 - 01:16:36.222, Speaker A: So hopefully I can find a suitable opponent. If you weigh 155 pounds and you have two to six months of fight experience, and you're five nine, roughly. Well, the height doesn't matter and you're an influencer. Let the karate combat people know, and I'll fight you.
01:16:36.398 - 01:16:39.270, Speaker B: I'm gonna put my research team on that immediately.
01:16:39.462 - 01:16:53.154, Speaker A: Yeah. And I've also been offered a rematch against Hoffman, probably in October. I permissionless. So we'll see if we can make that fight. I'd like to fight. I mean, I. Otherwise it'd be a waste.
01:16:53.864 - 01:17:08.964, Speaker B: Well, I would love to see it. I'm impressed. I continue to be impressed with you and your work, Nick. And thank you for coming on Galaxy Brains, Nick Carter. We know him as an investor, as a longtime defender of bitcoin, a writer, but now also a fight.
