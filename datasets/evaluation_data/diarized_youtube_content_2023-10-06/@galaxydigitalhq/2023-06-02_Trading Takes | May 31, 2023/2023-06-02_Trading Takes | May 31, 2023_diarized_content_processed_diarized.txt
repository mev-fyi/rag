00:00:07.240 - 00:00:12.262, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. Bimnet, as always, great to see you. How are you doing?
00:00:12.398 - 00:00:14.326, Speaker B: Doing great. Thanks for having me.
00:00:14.470 - 00:00:37.574, Speaker A: So, I don't know. I mean, gosh, I feel like I saw bitcoin. Volatility is back to almost that pre FTX lows realized volatility, not a lot happening in markets. The debt ceiling, we saw a little bit of a pump over the weekend when it was announced that the debt ceiling, there was maybe a deal, but equity is heavy. Crypto now trading heavy, but still sort of in the same range. What is happening in markets, if anything?
00:00:37.614 - 00:01:26.738, Speaker B: Right now the main focus is still on the debt ceiling. Without a debt ceiling resolution formally getting passed through both chambers of Congress and getting signed by the president, it's still the biggest priority for markets because a default would ultimately be catastrophic. So that's the number one focus. The number two focus is on the Fed meeting on June 15. You have about 50% probability baked in for a hike in the June meeting and 100% probability of a hike baked in for the July meeting. So the market is definitely focused on front end pricing. Here in the US, the recent run of data has been incredibly hot, with a handful of exceptions.
00:01:26.738 - 00:02:26.204, Speaker B: But the broad trend is that core inflation is still persistently high, and the factors that go into determining that core inflation suggests that it's going to remain tight. And so the Fed is left with no choice but to continue hiking in the front end. And so now the question that the market is trying to figure out is, one, how many more hikes are potentially possible? Today? Larry Fink said that we could see another two to four hikes. Last week, we had a couple Fed members saying you could see another two hikes. And so I think you probably have at least another two hikes in the cards. In addition, there's still significant rate cut pricing, mainly in 2024, and so the market can take out that pricing and assume that the Fed is going to be forced to stay higher for longer over that period. In addition, I think the other thing of note is sort of the international central bank backdrop.
00:02:26.204 - 00:02:58.978, Speaker B: You have significant inflation in the UK, and their latest prints have not been any better. And so the BoE is expected to hike their next two meetings. Same thing with the ECB. We just had a hot australian CPI print last night. Japan. They're still pondering the end of yield curve control, and now there's chatter about currency intervention. And then fourthly, we are seeing certain pockets of weakening activity, particularly in China and Germany.
00:02:58.978 - 00:03:39.312, Speaker B: These are two huge industrial complex nations and they are markets that are continuing to struggle. Look at the Hang Seng recently, underperforming by a lot like chinese industrials. Chinese tech names have come off a lot. Basically in China there's a lot of hope surrounding that they're reopening. And it just has sort of fizzled out just because I think historically a lot of their economy has been based on their property market and investments. And so at this point in the cycle, there's just a lot less investment. And the housing market isn't like what it once was.
00:03:39.312 - 00:04:28.934, Speaker B: Because I do believe that a lot of the historical activity has been driven by private real estate agents in China. And given sort of the recent collapse you've had in home pricing, I think people remember like Evergrande, etcetera, there's less appetite there. And so China, it's a market that's continuing to struggle. And you're seeing that reflected in their currency, which is breaking out through seven. I think it's at 711 right now and looking like it's about to make new trend highs. And then Germany's in a recession. So it's a battle of, this is a market that's torn between a bunch of central banks that want to hike because inflation is really strong and pretty notable pockets of weakness in the global economy.
00:04:28.934 - 00:04:32.906, Speaker B: So it's a pretty interesting dynamic at the moment.
00:04:32.970 - 00:04:53.290, Speaker A: We still see bond investors had been diverting strongly from what the Fed had been saying. We saw that the, the inversion was suggesting like an imminent recession and thus possibly cuts. But now it really does feel like higher for longer is still in the cards. I mean, is that dynamic still at play with the disparity between the two?
00:04:53.442 - 00:05:34.884, Speaker B: So that level of inversion in the front end, talking about, you know, call it overnight versus the twelve month point or the 18 month point has normalized pretty significantly. I see. And, but however, like if you look at, you know, a curve like two's five's or two's ten's, those curves are still at historically inverted levels. And they suggest that based on historicals, that something meaningful is about to happen in the economy. And just the other kind of point that folks look at is just like the three month rate versus tenure. And that is, you know, insanely inverted. Right.
00:05:34.884 - 00:06:40.092, Speaker B: I mean, I think, yeah, it's one, it makes, it makes owning fixed income incredibly difficult from a carry perspective. And from an opportunity cost perspective, most funding or leverage that is used to buy treasuries funds and overnight, or the three month point. And so when you're talking about almost 200 basis points of negative carry. It makes it really tough to be long, that long end duration. In addition, it's just like, wait, why wouldn't I take less duration risk and park get an extra 200 basis points? And then, honestly, there's one big thing that I didn't touch earlier that I'd like to just quickly go back to the resolution of the debt ceiling and what that means for markets. Once that actually goes through, there's an important sort of component to it, which is like the treasury supply that's going to hit the market after they approve the bill. Essentially, the government is going to need to raise a trillion dollars of funding via treasury sales.
00:06:40.092 - 00:07:13.666, Speaker B: Six to $700 billion of that is going to come from t bills. That means that the market is going to have to buy $600 to $700 billion t bills and another $300 million in $300 billion in other paper. And that's going to drain reserves from the market, and it might be draining from banks that aren't in such good situations. And so that's definitely something sort of very notable that I think market participants are watching closely. Wow. Yeah.
00:07:13.690 - 00:07:31.744, Speaker A: It's going to be crazy to see how this goes down. I mean, I've been following the politics of the debt ceiling, and, you know, it seems like a tough sell for both sides right now to their, to their constituencies. Hopefully, we get some kind of totally bipartisan where the fringes vote against, but the strong middle comes through and gets something done sooner rather than later.
00:07:32.604 - 00:07:43.580, Speaker B: I hate to sound like a broken record, but I think this is great for bitcoin. I mean, it basically is like, hey, we're the government. We're going to spend as much money as possible up until this deadline, and then we'll.
00:07:43.612 - 00:08:07.146, Speaker A: I mean, they're haggling. If you do the arithmetic on long term fiscal situation in America, it's so ugly, and it's basically impossible to do the math and have it work out without, without either massive tax increases or massive government spend cuts in the, you know, over the next 2030 years. And then you have people in Washington. I know, but then you have our people in Washington haggling over, you know, like, one or 2%.
00:08:07.210 - 00:08:08.810, Speaker B: Right. And, like, that's where now I know.
00:08:08.882 - 00:08:40.110, Speaker A: And it's just, if you think about it, I mean, I mean, Stan Druckenmiller, I encourage people to look, listened to his speech at the University of Southern California on May 3. It's, it's depressing. Um, but he just lays out the, the simple arithmetic of things like financing the debt over the next ten to 20 years and the cost of entitlements and the other spending. And it just doesn't add up. So it's, it literally can't add up. So, um, and then we're haggling over, you know, freeze. What are we talking about freezing fiscal spending at like this year's rate for, until, for next year? Like that's, that's the debate right now.
00:08:40.110 - 00:08:47.082, Speaker A: So, yeah, it seems very out of touch. Honestly, the situation, I agree, in terms of bitcoin, fundamentally speaking, makes a lot.
00:08:47.098 - 00:09:05.054, Speaker B: Of sense in an environment like that. It's ugly. I mean, long run, the only solution is to continue to finance the debt via the Federal Reserve. Like the Federal Reserve will eventually go back to QE. It's not if, but a matter of when.
00:09:06.374 - 00:09:15.474, Speaker A: So anything else just in your mind as you look at markets or crypto markets this week to share that, you know, how. And we've talked about, I mean, bitcoin.
00:09:15.854 - 00:09:36.674, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I mean, I would be remiss to not mention that. You know, the biggest sort of attention driver in markets over the past week is, has been AI. And. Yeah, names. And we've had several companies, you know. Right. Report a revenues related to AI businesses.
00:09:36.794 - 00:09:38.882, Speaker A: Chip makers, big tech. Yeah.
00:09:38.938 - 00:10:17.164, Speaker B: I mean it's, it's all about AI. And, you know, I think that's where a lot of speculative money is going towards right now. You know, some of the valuations and the names are, you know, I'd say they're hot, they're high. And a lot of the performance and equity markets this year are driven by, you know, a handful of, you know, five to six. Six names. And so, you know, it's, it's a market that, you know, has lost a lot of breath and, you know, is driven by one thing right now and that's speculation around AI. And so it does feel a little bubble esque and a handful of names at least.
00:10:17.164 - 00:10:53.204, Speaker B: So, yeah, I think that's an important story to watch. And obviously, you know, there are certain plays in crypto as well that are receiving positive attention because of their association with AI. I think if you look at some of the AI tokens, those have been the best performing tokens over the past couple of weeks. As long as the AI narrative in broader markets continues, I would expect the crypto AI stuff to be well supported as well.
00:10:53.814 - 00:10:58.190, Speaker A: That's great. Bimnet Abibi, as always, our friend from galaxy trading. Thank you so much.
00:10:58.342 - 00:10:59.454, Speaker B: Pleasure. Thanks for having me.
