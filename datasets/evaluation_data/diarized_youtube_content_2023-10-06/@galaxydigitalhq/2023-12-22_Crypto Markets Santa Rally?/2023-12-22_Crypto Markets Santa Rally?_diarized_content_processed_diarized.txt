00:00:00.120 - 00:00:14.182, Speaker A: So bitcoin is still pressing, and crypto markets are still going higher. Yeah. No. Is this Santa rally? Uh, well, it's kind of a multi month rally. Think about bitcoin. It's basically at a Santa Claus rally almost every month this year. Yeah.
00:00:14.182 - 00:00:28.962, Speaker A: Uh, which I think is why it's so compelling to traditional investors. Even the best traditional investors, they look at their portfolio, I'd say they were heavily weighted in Nasdaq, maybe up 45%. Not bad. Pretty good, actually. Epic. Epic. Great.
00:00:28.962 - 00:00:57.784, Speaker A: Fantastic. One of the best years in a long time for the Nasdaq. Bitcoin's up 150% this year. We've had Solana up over 600% this year. I mean, some of these alt moves have been insane, like, thousands of percents. Crazy nfts have done well, et cetera. But high level, there are liquid crypto things that offer competitive alternatives to traditional markets.
