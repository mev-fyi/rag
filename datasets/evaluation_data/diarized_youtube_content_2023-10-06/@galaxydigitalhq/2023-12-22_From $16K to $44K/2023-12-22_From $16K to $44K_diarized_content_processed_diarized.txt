If you celebrate the holidays this weekend, you're going to go home and probably just like Thanksgiving, your parents and your aunts and uncles or whoever it is that hopefully you're spending the holiday with, they may ask about bitcoin. It's been quite a year, and I remember last year we started this at 16 five. And goodness gracious, it's 44k today on.
00:00:21.958 - 00:00:24.790, Speaker B: Its way to like six digits.
00:00:24.982 - 00:00:31.540, Speaker A: On top. Have a great weekend, Bimnet, and we will actually catch you next year, my friend. So thanks.
00:00:31.572 - 00:00:38.364, Speaker B: So much for having me this year, by the way. And I want to say appreciate all the listeners out there. It's been a great year and hopefully we can have a great 2024.
