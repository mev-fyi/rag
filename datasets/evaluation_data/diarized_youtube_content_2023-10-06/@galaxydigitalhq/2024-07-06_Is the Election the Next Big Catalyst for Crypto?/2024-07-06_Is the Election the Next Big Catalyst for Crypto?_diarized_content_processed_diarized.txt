00:00:07.120 - 00:00:12.890, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, BiMnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to galaxy brains.
00:00:13.430 - 00:00:14.550, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:14.670 - 00:00:26.184, Speaker A: So we got some data and there's some disruption also happening in the presidential election which could impact markets. But let's start with the data. What are you watching? Has anything changed?
00:00:26.382 - 00:01:11.680, Speaker B: Yeah, ISM services came in dramatically weaker than expected today. It was in contraction territory. I think it printed on a 47 handle, which is really, really low. And services make up a very large portion of the us economy. We are a services economy. And so to see that kind of enter the contraction territory kind of is ringing some alarm bells. You've had a very dramatic reaction in fixed income and in the dollar where bond yields have rallied and the dollar has weakened pretty significantly for a holiday trading day.
00:01:11.680 - 00:02:20.446, Speaker B: Just for context, the index, ISM services index has been around for 27 years. Only in three instances has it or three periods has it actually printed in contraction territory. The first one was in 2001 around the tech bubble. The second one was 2008 2009, great financial crisis. And the third time was in 2020 during COVID This is a very meaningful indicator that, that the economy is slowing and it supports some of the other data points that we've gotten over the past two weeks, particularly with respect to manufacturing activity and broader business conditions and inflation. So we've seen, we've had the CPI prints that were in line, the PC prints, they were soft, PC was softish. And so the inflation stuff is starting to cool and now the growth stuff is looking like it's starting to cool as well.
00:02:20.446 - 00:03:22.844, Speaker B: And then in terms of the labor market, the labor market stats we got today were okay. Initial jobless claims in line ADP inline the ISM services employment component, still an expansionary expansion territory on a 56 handle. And so labor market is proving tricky to crack. But again, I think the focus is still on price measures and that's kind of what I'm still paying most attention to. But I do think if you do see a crack in the labor market in a meaningful way, the language you've heard out of Powell and other FOMC officials is that they will respond pretty aggressively, I think, to any dramatic weakening in the labor market. So all in all we're seeing softening in the data and that's helping risk assets, stocks are at fresh all time highs and that's helping bond markets kind of rally.
00:03:22.932 - 00:03:40.636, Speaker A: Yeah, what's happening with crypto in that? Because we're down pretty much across the board in crypto now for several weeks. Risk rally there how do you view the divergence between equities and tech equities and cryptos at the moment?
00:03:40.748 - 00:04:30.880, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I think it's just a supply and demand function. At Galaxy, we've seen a pretty healthy amount of selling flow. We've seen german government sell. We've seen a ton of overriding activity on Darabita, and there's a ton of alt token supply that's regularly hitting the market. And then you've got the GoC supply, you've got a potential supply unlock in the ETF conversion, potentially as well. And so it's just a story of lots of sellers and not that many buyers. And you've also, I think, over the past two weeks, you've probably averaged net outflows out of the ETF products as well.
00:04:30.880 - 00:05:30.408, Speaker B: And so, really, it's just an asset that is seeing a lot more supply than fresh demand versus, when you think about tech stocks, they're constantly buying back their own shares, especially the big ones. And companies, especially in AI, have delivered consistent beats on earnings and growth expectations, et cetera. And so there's real, genuine organic revenue that's driving a lot and expected revenue that's driving some of the price action in equities versus in crypto. We're still in the land of magic Internet money in certain instances. I really do think that until you get through a lot of this crypto supply, it's going to be hard to sustain a rally.
00:05:30.504 - 00:06:16.944, Speaker A: Yep. Understood. And then, okay, let's turn to this other market that people have been watching, the prediction markets on, the presidential election. Yeah, I mean, one of the main things since President Biden's appearance a couple weeks ago at the presidential debate has been speculation about whether he will ultimately win the democratic presidential nomination. The idea whether or not he would drop out. Just today, as we record this on July 3, Kamala Harris is now trading at basically 50%, 49% likelihood versus Joe Biden's 31% likelihood. It's been dropping significantly, not so much questioning whether you follow that market as a trader and investor, but instead, you know, let's talk again.
00:06:16.944 - 00:06:34.140, Speaker A: I've seen talk about the Trump trade. There have been some polls that have come out that show that president, former President Trump, is leading across many battleground states. What is the Trump trade, as the street thinks about it, as it relates to fixed income securities and or inflation and stuff?
00:06:35.000 - 00:07:54.200, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it's getting a little bit more complicated. I would say the initial kind of gut trade for a Trump presidency, at least in my head, was a curve steepener that is a function of Trump wanting lower rates in addition to spending that's likely not going to get cut that much, in addition to tariff wars and labor supply, that's going to get deported, really. And so initially, my gut instinct is telling me that the curve should steepen as a function of the two year yield going down and kind of the long term viability of government debt and spending being an issue and kind of trade wars and geopolitical risks. I think that was kind of the trait I had in my head. But it's, I'll give you the comparison to equities, though. Historically, it does not matter who's president, stocks just go up. And as long as there's still dysfunction in Congress and in the Senate, typically the US economy just continues chugging along.
00:07:54.200 - 00:08:59.416, Speaker B: And so with respect to the equity market, I do think that Trump pays attention to it, more so than most presidents, I would say. But it's not necessarily clear that a Trump victory versus a Biden victory is going to send the market relatively higher or lower. I think that there's some trades to do between sectors and stuff, but that's, again, still a little bit unclear. Bitcoin and crypto seems like the most clear trade for an election trade to me because, you know, he's definitely come out as supportive as possible for crypto. And so I think a change of the guard in the SEC would be viewed constructively as well. And so I do think that being long crypto makes a lot of sense. I actually like a handful of crypto equity names in particular, because they also have kind of the energy and AI power theme going for them as well.
00:08:59.416 - 00:09:30.592, Speaker B: When you throw in crypto regulation, that's a little bit more friendly. In addition to continued AI and kind of power narrative spreading in the market, I tend to think that some of these crypto equities still have a lot of Runway to run. And so I think one of the clearest trades for the election is probably long crypto. And, yep, there you go. Appreciate it.
00:09:30.616 - 00:09:34.624, Speaker A: Bimnet Abibi, my friend from galaxy trading, as always, thanks for coming on. Galaxy brains.
00:09:34.752 - 00:09:35.620, Speaker B: Thank you.
