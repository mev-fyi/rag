00:00:00.120 - 00:00:34.414, Speaker A: I think the proof of stake model that Ethereum has employed is more complex because it transitioned from a proof of work model as well, and so it had to finagle around with some other properties. And the fact that Ethereum's consensus model is really a combination of two strains of proof of stake, one that favors network finality and the other that favors liveness. And a lot of these complexities come from the way Ethereum developers are trying to maximize both chain security and liveness at the same time with other proof of stake blockchains. They just pick one or the other.
