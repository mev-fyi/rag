00:00:00.200 - 00:00:53.094, Speaker A: The other thing to pay attention to, I think, from this earnings season, is the ability of corporates to respond to increasing costs by raising prices. So over the past couple of years, you've seen a lot of consumer staple companies, your big conglomerate types, be able to pass through the costs, the increased cost of commodities, labor and other services to the consumer. But that was because the consumer was in a much healthier spot, and so they could absorb that. But now, if you continue to see some of those costs go up and there's less of an ability of those corporates to pass through that pricing to consumers, where is it going to have to come from? It's going to have to come from their bottom line. And so you're going to see margin compression as the consumer kind of tightens up. And then, obviously, consumption is like 70% of the us economy.
