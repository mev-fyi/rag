00:00:00.800 - 00:00:03.758, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, an infinite amount of cash.
00:00:03.854 - 00:00:04.510, Speaker B: Cash.
00:00:04.670 - 00:00:11.134, Speaker A: I'm your host, Alex Thornton. The us banking system is sound and resilient. Bitcoin made a new all time high.
00:00:11.302 - 00:00:12.190, Speaker B: If you're not long.
00:00:12.270 - 00:00:22.290, Speaker A: If you're not long, you're short. Satoshi's gonna come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet. All bitcoin's gonna be erased. Bitcoin. Bitcoin's the best crypto else.
00:00:22.990 - 00:00:25.010, Speaker B: Bitcoin is going to zero.
00:00:25.640 - 00:01:02.560, Speaker A: Welcome back to Galaxy Brains. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firm wide research at Galaxy. This is the next edition in the Nashville tapes. We're here at the Bitcoin conference, and we're talking with Dylan Leclair, chief bitcoin strategy officer at Metaplanet, market intelligence analyst at Utxo Management. We're going to talk with Dylan about enacting the microstrategy playbook as a public company, what's happening in the market, and what his impressions are of what's happening here in Nashville for bitcoin 2024. Let's get right to Dylan. Before we get to the show, I need to remind you, please refer to a link to disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates of buyers sell any securities.
00:01:02.560 - 00:01:12.684, Speaker A: Welcome to Dylan Leclaire, director of bitcoin strategy at Metaplanet, director of market intelligence at Utxo Management. Dylan, thank you so much for coming on Galaxy brains.
00:01:12.772 - 00:01:14.240, Speaker B: Thanks, Alex. Happy to be here.
00:01:14.660 - 00:01:29.584, Speaker A: We had a fun time at the microstrategy conference in Las Vegas a couple months ago. What was your take on Michael strategy? I mean, Michael Saylor, Michael Strategy. It's not a bad joke here. Michael strategy on Michael Sailor in general. Like, he's vindicated, isn't he?
00:01:29.712 - 00:02:11.146, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, for sure. You know, I was under the bit of naive impression that this playbook that they have pioneered would have taken off in 21, 22, 23. And obviously, I think after they escaped the bear market, it was like, okay, they survived. The market cap's 20 x'ed. Like it's, you know, it's a no brainer. Yeah. And so I think this cycle is, you know, among other things, obviously, you know, we have presidential candidates gonna be talking about bitcoin and tomorrow and, you know, a whole bunch of stuff on the landscape that is positive ahead.
00:02:11.146 - 00:02:20.220, Speaker B: But I think, among other things, the public corporate adoption narrative is not even narrative, just reality is gonna be a big driver.
00:02:20.330 - 00:02:25.608, Speaker A: Yeah. What is the strategy? Will you just lay it out for our audience real quick? The microstrategy strategy.
00:02:25.784 - 00:02:46.220, Speaker B: Well, yeah, I mean, so there's a couple of different kind of layers to it, right? Levels, I would say level one is just, you buy a little bit of bitcoin. A company like square, who has cash app, is a great bitcoin product. They have a hardware wallet. They do great stuff. Their bitcoin team is amazing. But in terms of their treasury allocation balance sheet, it's like five to 10% of their balance sheets in bitcoin.
00:02:46.400 - 00:02:47.788, Speaker A: So just holding some. Getting.
00:02:47.844 - 00:02:48.540, Speaker B: Holding a little bit.
00:02:48.620 - 00:02:49.124, Speaker A: Exposure.
00:02:49.172 - 00:03:23.960, Speaker B: Yeah, have some exposure. Right. Don't have all of your liquid capital and t bills. I think level two is you have a bigger bitcoin allocation and you maybe even have gone to the public market and done, say, an equity issuance. Right. Because I like, there's a practice where take any market cap for any company, you're looking at any valuation, it can even be a private company, and it's in dollars, a billion dollars, and flip that, change the denominator to bitcoin. In a world where we're going ten years from now, your company today is probably overvalued in bitcoin terms.
00:03:23.960 - 00:04:14.060, Speaker B: So if you're a public company and you look at your market cap and it's say, 10,000 bitcoin or 100,000 bitcoin, if you look and you think the world that we're going to ten years from now, maybe it's not worth that much bitcoin, the rational thing to do would be maybe issue equity and buy bitcoin. So level two is like, maybe you have, instead of 10% of your balance sheet in bitcoin, you have 50 or a little bit more, or you've gone to the market and you've done something like maybe a Semler where they file the shelf registration. Just yesterday, Eric was saying. Eric Semmler was saying, yeah, that SEC has had some comments for us, but they've said, hey, we're going to go have $50 million at the money at the market facility. Sell equity, buy bitcoin. Level two, level three is basically what microstrategy has done, which is we're not going to put 80% of our balance sheet in bitcoin. We're not going to put 100%.
00:04:14.060 - 00:04:40.702, Speaker B: We're going to put 120%, we're going to be levered bitcoin volume, and we're going to go out and we're going to sell that volatility. We're going to sell that volatility through convertible notes. We're going to borrow at zero, and we're going to loop it back into bitcoin. Basically, it's this idea of accretive dilution that is, I think, the ultimate form of this strategy. Right. But I don't think that will be adopted en masse. Right.
00:04:40.702 - 00:04:43.750, Speaker B: It's kind of like a. It's kind of like you have to. You have to go to step one first.
00:04:43.830 - 00:05:01.806, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. It's amazing that he really launched into this so quickly once he started, too. I mean, I think I remember Matt Walsh found this filing in, like, summer 2020, and it was pretty doldrums, too, right. When this happened, you know, the having had just happened, we were in Covid, but bitcoin really didn't start to move, seriously until the fall.
00:05:01.878 - 00:05:03.374, Speaker B: Yeah, it was like nine k for, like, three months.
00:05:03.422 - 00:05:29.762, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And like. And then he's like, this company, like, microstrategy, like buying bitcoin, and we're like. And then nothing really happened in the market. And I remember being like, you know, when I was first at fidelity, like, I mean, now, a long time ago, like, there I was like, oh, I remember that company. There was, like, some system I opened occasionally that would be like, microstrategy. And I was like, who is this company? That strategy is super interesting.
00:05:29.762 - 00:06:01.452, Speaker A: There's people that wanted. I thought. What I thought was that it was gonna degrade after the ETF's launched, and it hasn't yet, really, at all. But the idea was that before the ETF's, there wasn't a publicly listed equity, like vehicle or equity wrapper to get bitcoin exposure other than mining stocks and microstrategy, basically. So I thought some of the monetary premium of microstrategy would get drawn out, but we haven't seen that yet. But you are now the chief bitcoin strategy officer or something like that, right? That's close enough. Right.
00:06:01.452 - 00:06:15.144, Speaker A: The name for Metaplanet, which is one of these. And I don't think they'd be offended to hear this, but what Michael Saylor even called his own company, company that is now running this playbook in Japan. Why? What are you guys doing?
00:06:15.312 - 00:06:55.970, Speaker B: Well, yeah, that's literally out of the words of Simon Garavicz yesterday on a panel, and he'll say it. It was a former commercial real estate company, still has a property, but Covid happened, and the restructuring happened. But essentially the idea came from the fact that Tokyo, Japan's a massive market, massive bond market and equity market. The tax laws in Japan for crypto bitcoin are pretty hostile. It's ordinary income, miscellaneous income, so it's up to 55% for listed securities. It's a flat 20%. The yen and the macro environment there, the financial repression there, interest rates at zero on the short end, 1% on the long end, that GDP the highest in the world.
00:06:55.970 - 00:07:38.818, Speaker B: And the fact that there's no bitcoin proxies in Tokyo, there's none. There's no ETF's, there's no miners, there's no microstrategy. And everybody in Japan has a brokerage account. So it was kind of all these stars aligned. We had, long story short, met Simon. They did around, but we joined and basically published a manifesto, released it on the Tokyo Stock Exchange disclosure system in English and Japanese, and said, look, this is the plan. We're going to use all the tools available to us in the public capital markets come August 1, we're increasing our authorized capital by three x, meaning that we have equity to issue with as disclosed.
00:07:38.818 - 00:08:07.296, Speaker B: With the intent to buy bitcoin. We've already issued a billion yen in bonds, which isn't much. Right. It's just the start of it, the strategy, but like six 7 million, but at 50 basis points, not convertibles. Right. This is just. And so I think the idea is to just lean into this and lean into this really hard and give basically japanese investors and some international investors too have the ability to access this exposure to bitcoin.
00:08:07.296 - 00:08:09.752, Speaker B: And the market so far has perceived it very, very well.
00:08:09.816 - 00:08:26.936, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw. It's been quite a story. I think it was the best performing equity in Japan over the last, what, quarter or something like that. I forget what this chart said. And of course it's not financial advice for anybody listening, but just that those are the facts as I am aware of them. Very interesting. So let's talk a little bit about.
00:08:26.936 - 00:08:42.040, Speaker A: You work in the Bitcoin magazine, diaspora, I'm going to call it. I mean, Utxo is David Bailey and fund. Right. Investment fund. You also still work at Bitcoin magazine technically, right?
00:08:42.500 - 00:08:44.060, Speaker B: Yeah, a lot of roles.
00:08:44.180 - 00:08:53.560, Speaker A: Yeah. What do you think about the bitcoin conference so far? I know it's sort of just getting started. Right. We're recording on Friday, July 26, but it's already been quite a scene.
00:08:53.940 - 00:09:20.958, Speaker B: Yeah, quite a scene. I mean, yesterday was industry day, so I think it was like 25% of the people that we expect today. I feel like there's just so far, you know, this morning there's been a great energy. Yeah, I think people are really excited, you know, the buzz about Trump and all of that. I think, again, for me, it's very much not, it's not even a red team blue team thing. I think it's just about the, you know, I've been coming to these. This is my fourth conference hosted by.
00:09:21.054 - 00:09:25.494, Speaker A: BTC Inc. One 2342-122-2324 and, you know.
00:09:25.502 - 00:09:42.552, Speaker B: The first three in Miami. Yep. Aside from the ones in Europe or Amsterdam. Sure. But yeah, I mean, this is, this is the biggest one. I think it's gonna has the most national attention as I think the biggest potential implications nationally, potentially geopolitically. Right.
00:09:42.552 - 00:10:12.980, Speaker B: I mean, just like, I think Matthew Pines had a great point. We were in a space a month ago and it was like after the meeting with the miners and Trump comes out and says, basically, we want to keep bitcoin mining in America. It's good for our energy. And Matthew, basically a really smart guy, said, the first thing he said was, first thing I thought of is think about all the intelligence agencies globally that have to write a brief about what Donald Trump just said to their superiors.
00:10:13.020 - 00:10:14.548, Speaker A: Yeah, that's absolutely right.
00:10:14.644 - 00:10:51.908, Speaker B: And so whether you're an adversary of the US, whether it's Russia, China, Iran, I, you know, anyone that's at threat of like sanctions risk, or just even allies, right, where they're saying, look at this, is the world reserve currency, you know, Trump and betting markets a 60% chance to win the presidency. What does that say? Right. And I think people that got mad or upset that, you know, Orange man was saying this and because they dislike his views or he's mean or whatever, missed the point that this is like, just completely shifts the Overton window where bitcoin was pretty irrelevant in 2020, it was not even close to this stage. Now it's, you know, we're in the big leagues.
00:10:51.964 - 00:10:52.692, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely.
00:10:52.756 - 00:10:53.668, Speaker B: There's no turning back.
00:10:53.764 - 00:11:01.076, Speaker A: There isn't. And we were excited in 2021 about a video of a central american president announcing that bitcoin would be legal tender.
00:11:01.188 - 00:11:01.880, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:02.180 - 00:11:05.812, Speaker A: And all power to El Salvador. It's been, they've done well with that strategy as well.
00:11:05.836 - 00:11:06.564, Speaker B: Amazing story.
00:11:06.692 - 00:11:33.734, Speaker A: Amazing story. But now you've got the former president coming to speak. You've also had RFK junior speaking here today, pulling at about 10%. He was at the karate combat last night where Nick Carter defeated Cody Koon. You know, I was thinking about Trump and him saying that. Remember when he was at the UN and he was lecturing Germany about how they were overly dependent on russian natural gas. And they laughed at him.
00:11:33.782 - 00:11:34.014, Speaker B: Yep.
00:11:34.062 - 00:12:19.278, Speaker A: They laughed at him. Yes. Completely vindicated. You know, Germany effectively still, I mean, in an energy crisis, at least strategically, for them at this point now with the war in Ukraine and having to be so anti Russia, I wonder, and I hope for the sake of those intelligence agencies, policymakers, that they don't laugh at that, because honestly, I'm more certain than I ever would have known about the implications of russian natural gas in Germany. More certain about bitcoin in five years. I'm pretty sure if Trump does embrace bitcoin after and wins and does embrace bitcoin and people don't take it seriously, then we're going to be having the last laugh again in five years on bitcoin.
00:12:19.414 - 00:12:31.718, Speaker B: Yep. I totally agree there. I mean, this is like, this is the big leaks, right? And so I think even Trump wins, loses, or, you know, a third world, like, worst option like this, this is a point of no return.
00:12:31.774 - 00:12:36.334, Speaker A: It has been leveled up. It's really quite insane. Yeah. And I agree. Adversary or ally?
00:12:36.422 - 00:12:36.782, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:12:36.846 - 00:12:41.782, Speaker A: I mean, if the US has any type of national bitcoin strategy, even if it's not to buy and hold it.
00:12:41.806 - 00:12:43.566, Speaker B: I mean, don't sell our current bitcoin.
00:12:43.638 - 00:12:56.944, Speaker A: Even if they do, even if they just adopt a more friendly attitude towards the bitcoin industry. That's the one thing, too. What are your thoughts on the bitcoin strategic reserve idea? I have some, but I'll offer mine if you want, but I'll let you go first.
00:12:57.072 - 00:13:24.486, Speaker B: I mean, it's crazy because a lot of. I don't want to say memes, but there's all these bitcoin people, and they'll say things years in advance that are just radical and crazy and they look like lunatics and sound like lunatics. And then three to four to maybe five years later, it's like, is this maybe going to happen? And so I don't have a strong, you know, opinion one way or another. I don't know what he's gonna say. I don't think anybody does.
00:13:24.558 - 00:13:24.790, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:24.830 - 00:13:27.182, Speaker B: Anybody claiming to know what's gonna come out of Trump's mouth.
00:13:27.246 - 00:13:27.582, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:27.646 - 00:13:28.334, Speaker B: Doesn't.
00:13:28.502 - 00:13:30.110, Speaker A: That's true. Outside of bitcoin also.
00:13:30.150 - 00:13:38.846, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, totally. Like, I think Trump's gonna go up there. He's gonna feel the vibe of the room. If it's electric, he's a wild card in the best way.
00:13:38.918 - 00:13:39.174, Speaker A: Right.
00:13:39.222 - 00:13:53.694, Speaker B: So I, you know, we'll see what happens. I I know. I think. Was it I was talking with you or someone else? Where yeah, I think I was talking with you, like, exactly what it would look like. Like, what regulatory body or what part of the government does this fall under? Right.
00:13:53.702 - 00:13:55.486, Speaker A: Right. That's a fun question. It's a.
00:13:55.518 - 00:13:55.966, Speaker B: What are your thoughts?
00:13:55.998 - 00:14:13.262, Speaker A: It's a nerdy question. Well, I have a couple. One is that I don't believe that he will or should announce that it's part of some attempt to hedge or protect the dollar. I don't think it should be backing the dollar with bitcoin. If you announce that we're going to back the dollar with popsicle sticks, the dollar is going to crash. Like. Right.
00:14:13.262 - 00:14:24.312, Speaker A: Like, there's no need. Like. Right. Fiat currencies, especially reserve currency, is a confidence game. There's no reason to, like, suggest that it's weak. I don't believe that there is any reason to suggest it's weak. Right.
00:14:24.312 - 00:14:43.860, Speaker A: Yep, I do think it's weak. And we also know the Trump administration will want a weaker dollar for the manufacturing base, but they don't want to spiral it out of control. Nobody wants that. That'd be terrible for Americans. So I think if they buy it, it should be done through for different reasons. Perhaps a geopolitical competition. International trade.
00:14:43.860 - 00:15:18.344, Speaker A: Not specifically. Shouldn't be done out of the treasury, shouldn't be done out of the Fed. Right. Because then you're just hurting the dollar for no real reason when you could just also stack for a different reason. That's one view that I have. The other one is that I'm kind of annoyed about the hype over this because I really don't think this week or this conference or this moment in bitcoin history needs this, and we're almost certainly going to be disappointed. I don't think there's really any likelihood, really, that the US embarks on a meaningful, like, El Salvador bitcoin strategy.
00:15:18.412 - 00:15:18.688, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:18.744 - 00:15:39.056, Speaker A: And I don't think we have to, and I don't think bitcoin needs, needs it at all. So, like, to me, it's like a little bit like opium that that is most likely going to disappoint, whereas, like, the fact that two presidential candidates are speaking at the bitcoin conference, that Kamala Harris was interested and looked into speaking here, that that's good enough, you know?
00:15:39.168 - 00:15:46.294, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I mean, we, you know, we get ahead of our skis, and I say we as, like, you know, I know we're not some, like, homogeneous.
00:15:46.382 - 00:16:08.494, Speaker A: Collective, but there are definitely some, like, permeating, like, unspoken narratives that pick up real fast. And we all sort of, like, think about it in the bitcoin world, even across the various, like, you know, bubbles and spheres of bitcoin influence. Like, I think it's fair to say that we bitcoiners do often get ahead of our spot, to your point. I mean, a lot of what people have been saying for years gets less crazy every day.
00:16:08.662 - 00:16:33.286, Speaker B: Yeah. You know, and again, I think it's about just the fact that this is a conversation. Shifts, shifts the Overton window and what's politically palatable at the time. Right. Like, if we're here in 2024, what does the 2028 election look like? Trump, Kamala. I mean, you know, probably Trump's out of the picture at that point, but whoever's next, right, this isn't gonna go away. I think just with the, with the voting bloc, which may or may not be a bit overestimated.
00:16:33.286 - 00:16:50.250, Speaker B: I'm not sure the size of the single issue voter bloc, the size of. What's not underestimated is the amount of donations that have come in. Right. And, you know, say what you want about the left. Like, they're smart enough to realize they don't want to go get on the other side of a massive wall, of, a growing wall of capital, and they don't need to. Right.
00:16:50.290 - 00:17:04.090, Speaker A: That's one of the things that always confused me about Elizabeth Warren, like, her level of vitriol and her wing of the Democratic Party's level of hatred of crypto. I don't think there's a lot of people who are going to the polls to vote against crypto. Like, it doesn't seem like a real good political issue.
00:17:04.170 - 00:17:04.602, Speaker B: No.
00:17:04.706 - 00:17:28.893, Speaker A: I mean, obviously, there have been, like, at this point, innumerable violations of consumer safety across the broader crypto complexity. And I get that that's bad. And she herself has been a consumer safety and protections advocate, but politically speaking, I just don't see it as. And of course, there's plenty of good actors as well, so I think that is pretty durable. You're right. The money. Money speaks in american politics.
00:17:28.893 - 00:17:30.733, Speaker A: It is speech in american politics.
00:17:30.821 - 00:17:44.305, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, look, like the underbelly of politics isn't some, you know, it's not a beautiful, eloquent thing. It's like. Right. It's like politics is a gross game.
00:17:44.437 - 00:17:46.466, Speaker A: The art of convenience and compromise. Right.
00:17:46.538 - 00:18:10.730, Speaker B: Yeah. And so, like, you know, this is, if you want to, I think for the longest time, bitcoin, crypto, I mean, it's like, it is technologically political, but for the longest time, it was like, very much we were, it was a reactive, defensive position. And I think, you know, RFK spoke in 2023. I think that was the first little inkling of like, huh, okay.
00:18:10.810 - 00:18:11.674, Speaker A: That was a good speech.
00:18:11.722 - 00:18:35.410, Speaker B: It was a great speech. Yeah. And I think, you know, I got to give a shout out to David Bailey because, you know, I, it was perceived, at least, you know, from the start, at least for me, a bit of a leap of faith where, you know, I just, he was like, we're going hard on this. And it was tweeted about it and he was like, you know, in March was like Trump keynote and everyone was like, haha, you know, like, haha, good job.
00:18:35.450 - 00:18:36.326, Speaker A: Manifested it.
00:18:36.418 - 00:19:07.736, Speaker B: And like, no, David went hard in the paint for months to make this happen. And so again, say what you think, what you want, say what you want about Trump. But this is a big moment. And I think this going ahead regardless of what happens with whatever people think he's going to say or whatever is actually put into policy this next term or whoever wins. But I think this is somewhat of an inflection point for bitcoin in the regulatory lens, in the political lens, then geopolitical lens of how we look at this.
00:19:07.808 - 00:19:15.200, Speaker A: Absolutely, it is. Would you think Satoshi would be surprised to. Well, I think he'd be surprised if you just said that it was Trump specifically.
00:19:15.240 - 00:19:15.488, Speaker B: Right.
00:19:15.544 - 00:19:27.536, Speaker A: But I mean, that, you know, 1516 years after, you know, creating and ideating bitcoin that there'd be a 25,000 person conference that the former president is speaking at. Yeah.
00:19:27.568 - 00:19:38.172, Speaker B: I mean, that's crazy, right? I mean, there's, there's going to be billions of views of Trump saying something about bitcoin, bitcoin 2024 logos behind him.
00:19:38.236 - 00:19:38.844, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:39.012 - 00:19:39.844, Speaker B: Billions of views.
00:19:39.892 - 00:19:40.932, Speaker A: Yeah. Wow.
00:19:41.116 - 00:19:41.844, Speaker B: Wow.
00:19:42.012 - 00:20:06.858, Speaker A: Yeah, it's wild. Before we wrap, what are your thoughts on, do you have any short, have you been following the macro situation? I saw they just revised inflation, what, slightly higher PCE, it looks like cooling of the economy is that didn't, it was minor. Right. But all the data seems to be turning towards a cooling economy now. And what do you think we're going to get some rate cuts anytime soon? How do you think about that? And also, does bitcoin care?
00:20:06.954 - 00:20:20.410, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, you know, bitcoin is correlated with all the risk until it's not. Right. And, you know, we've certainly seen a bit of, a, bit of a bump in the last week or two against risk that got hurt a little bit.
00:20:20.490 - 00:20:21.110, Speaker A: Right.
00:20:21.890 - 00:20:54.946, Speaker B: Look, I was someone in 2022 that was very bearish on the state of things and was actually right for a good amount and bearish into 23. Just given the, just given the monetary tightening and just the fiscal stimulus and the fiscal impulse and people like Lynn Alden just completely nailing that kind of regime flip of fiscal dominance. I think even if we get a little bit of a minor downturn, the Biden regime going into the election and then post election, neither one of them is going to be tightening the belt fiscally.
00:20:55.018 - 00:20:55.546, Speaker A: I don't think so.
00:20:55.578 - 00:21:05.820, Speaker B: Right. So even if you get a little bit of a downturn, a little bit of an uptick in unemployment, like, they're both, it's like welfare state regimes, fiscal stimulus regimes on both sides.
00:21:05.900 - 00:21:23.996, Speaker A: Yeah. I think Trump at the RNC said he was going to rein in the deficit and cut taxes. And I was like, pretty sure that's impossible. Everyone knows that. I don't know if everyone does. Maybe not everyone watching that speech, but everyone in finance, politics, policy, Washington, everybody knows that's impossible.
00:21:24.068 - 00:21:35.390, Speaker B: Yeah. So, no, I mean, I don't think there's any material, you know, there's no, there's no need to be bearish or, you know, maybe there's a little 1020 percent downturn, but that's a walk in the park in this world, so.
00:21:35.510 - 00:21:45.518, Speaker A: Well, Dylan, I guess one last question, since this will air after the. We're about to go on stage and ask, is this the end of the four year cycle? What are your quick thoughts on that?
00:21:45.574 - 00:22:00.690, Speaker B: The end of the cycle? I think the four year bull bear, again, it's somewhat of a meme and I think there's a lot of things in bitcoin that work until they don't. Right. We don't go below the all time high, but the 200 week moving average, just like.
00:22:00.810 - 00:22:04.954, Speaker A: And we kind of the prior all time high. That one was sad that I was upset about that one.
00:22:05.002 - 00:22:05.442, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:22:05.466 - 00:22:14.890, Speaker A: I was like, it was a good, really organic. I don't think. But yeah, that one was not, it was not great. That was like FTX for selling. That brought us down there, but that one did kind of hurt. That was nice to always say.
00:22:14.970 - 00:22:25.196, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. And so, you know, I think we keep kind of slaying these, like these prior preconceived notions. So. Yeah, I don't know. We'll have a good talk, though. I'm excited for it.
00:22:25.268 - 00:22:28.060, Speaker A: Well, Dylan, my friend, thank you so much for coming on. Galaxy brains.
