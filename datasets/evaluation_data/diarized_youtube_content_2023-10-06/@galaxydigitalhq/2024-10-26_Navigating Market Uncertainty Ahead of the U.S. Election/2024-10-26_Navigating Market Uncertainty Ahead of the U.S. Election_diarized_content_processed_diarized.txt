00:00:08.480 - 00:00:13.081, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome back to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:13.153 - 00:00:14.129, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:14.257 - 00:00:34.149, Speaker A: What's going on in your mind here? We're only two weeks out from the election. It seems like positioning is light. We were talking to some folks from a big bank yesterday. They said positioning is pretty light across the board. People are not looking to take very directional bets on the outcome of the election in terms of equities and traditional assets. Is that what you see?
00:00:34.317 - 00:01:01.727, Speaker B: Yeah, I think folks are preparing for an election that still has a lot of unknowns, particularly with respect to the market reaction function. The way to think about it is if I told you in 2016 that Donald Trump was gonna win the election a day in advance and you traded it that way, you probably would have lost money.
00:01:01.791 - 00:01:02.559, Speaker A: Even though he won.
00:01:02.647 - 00:01:24.641, Speaker B: Even though he won because the market did the exact opposite of what people thought it was going to do. And so in terms of how to approach the election from a trading strategy standpoint, I think what you'd want to do is essentially be a fast follower.
00:01:24.833 - 00:01:25.849, Speaker A: Wait and see what happens.
00:01:25.897 - 00:01:49.853, Speaker B: Wait and see what happens, see what the trend is. And that's a pretty popular take amongst traders, especially those that have lived through 2016. In addition, you just think about all of the unexpected election outcomes that we've had this year alone. There was the French election. Right. Le Pen doing well, the Mexican election. Right.
00:01:49.853 - 00:01:54.141, Speaker B: And so, and you know, there's just been a ton of popular surprises.
00:01:54.213 - 00:01:54.629, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:54.717 - 00:02:28.807, Speaker B: And so, you know, I think you have to be prepared for any outcome. Yeah, right. And yeah, the only, the only real thing that matters for markets right now is, you know, the election, waiting for that, waiting for that. But obviously under the hood, there's also earnings. You're in the prime of U.S. earnings season, so I think, you know, 60, 70% of S&P 500 companies report over the next like week or so. Yeah, you know, and so there's definitely a focus on earnings.
00:02:28.807 - 00:02:33.287, Speaker B: But again, if, you know corporates are going to get taxed less than a.
00:02:33.311 - 00:02:35.215, Speaker A: Trump administration, earnings would improve.
00:02:35.295 - 00:04:15.425, Speaker B: Earnings could theoretically improve certain sectors might do better or worse, depending on inflation. What I do think is really notable though is the price action you've had in fixed income in the US basically you've had a sell off north of 50 basis points on the 10 year yield point and the curve has steepened as well. And you've seen a repricing of front end cut expectations to go along with that. And I think that is symptomatic of one, a US Economy that's still doing okay, labor market that's still pretty tight, and the realization that the fiscal spending in a Trump outcome is going to be very high or the deficits are going to be relatively high, and that the policies that Trump is going to pursue at their face are inflationary. And so if you're talking about a Fed that is still focused on the inflation side of its mandate, because by law it has to be, then you're probably looking at an administration that's going to push inflation a bit higher. And so how could you be cutting in that type of environment which kind of puts the Fed in between a rock and a hard place? Because what's happened is because interest rates have been so high for so long, the interest expenses for the US have dramatically shot up. And so every year you're paying, I believe now over a trillion dollars a year in interest.
00:04:15.425 - 00:04:36.257, Speaker B: And so that's not sustainable. And so the Fed wants to cut rates because of how large the deficits are in the US but if they're really focused on the inflation side of things, they can't. And so.
00:04:36.361 - 00:04:43.937, Speaker A: And technically their statutory mandate doesn't include protecting against a US Debt deficit problem. Technically.
00:04:44.081 - 00:04:51.305, Speaker B: Well, markets, unemployment and all that. But it's really, you know, they're stuck between a rock and a hard place.
00:04:51.345 - 00:05:15.571, Speaker A: So they got a political administration in either case that is likely to be inflationary, whether it's from sending more money, more benefits, more social programs, or if it's tariffs that and cutting taxes. And cutting taxes which lower. Yeah. Lower income and also increase the cost of goods and services because of the tariffs then that they have to react to. It's like a political. And they don't want to be in that political situation.
00:05:15.723 - 00:05:16.107, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:16.171 - 00:05:22.275, Speaker A: Kind of makes them like a, like a balancing function against the federal government, which is not really where they want to be.
00:05:22.355 - 00:05:56.495, Speaker B: Yeah. And I mean, eventually you're gonna get to the point where the Fed will have to do some form of yield curve control in the US the way I think about it is there's already kind of synthetic yield curve control happening in the US it's very wide band, I would say. But the levers that effectively produce this yield curve control are twofold. Right. Or threefold. Right. So one, the Fed tells you where they're gonna eventually take rates due.
00:05:56.495 - 00:06:12.103, Speaker B: Right. So the dot plot forward guidance. Right. Allows the kind of the market to kind of be pegged to something. Right. Secondly, which is where long run inflation expectations get pegged to. And so that keeps a lid on the back end.
00:06:12.103 - 00:06:29.119, Speaker B: Second way they can control it is by direct balance sheet involvement. Right. So purchases and sales of securities in their balance sheet portfolio. The third way is adjusting the issuance. This is more Treasury. Right. Issuing more T bills rather than notes and bonds.
00:06:29.119 - 00:06:40.915, Speaker B: Right. And so they can adjust the curve by that. And Yellen did a great job of basically stopping the 10 year from going north of 5%.
00:06:42.455 - 00:06:45.879, Speaker A: Like let's say issuing fewer, issuing less.
00:06:46.047 - 00:07:47.369, Speaker B: Backend fixed income than the market was expecting. In theory, that's how the US keeps the yield curve in a relatively managed spot. Now, if you get to a scenario where basically you realize inflation is here to last, it's sticky, et cetera, then interest rates are going to stay high, then the interest expense becomes abundantly burdensome, and then it feeds on itself. And so you could reach a point where you kind of have back end expectations, kind of becoming more unhinged. Right. Essentially the back end of the US curve represents the Fed's credibility, their credibility to get inflation down, the US Government's credibility in terms of being able to repay that debt, et cetera. And so if they start to lose some of that credibility, you'll see that the back end go and that will, you know, that'll be, be a big red flag.
00:07:47.497 - 00:07:48.817, Speaker A: Be a big red flag, yeah.
00:07:48.921 - 00:08:14.817, Speaker B: Now, you know, the flip side to that argument is if you look at all the debt the US has in comparison to all the wealth that the US has, it's still like a reasonable amount of debt. Right? Like it's, it's, you know, you could tax people and pay that off theoretically. In theory. In theory. But good luck, right? You only have populists trying to run like, Right. It's just it.
00:08:14.921 - 00:08:38.805, Speaker A: I mean, even among the Democratic, like establishment, Biden was one of the more populous like figures historically, like for decades. Do you think that, what, what would take bitcoin out of this range to pivot here a little bit? Like, you know, I mean, we're still even now. We're looking at 65 high. 65, we've been in like the 60s. We hit 69 at the beginning of the week. It's still sort of in that big descending channel of the last, you know.
00:08:39.105 - 00:08:57.665, Speaker B: I mean, I'm very confident, fairly confident that a Trump victory is a very positive crypto catalyst. From the deregulation to the lack of selling. Banks will hold it on their balance.
00:08:57.705 - 00:09:01.241, Speaker A: Sheet for their integration. Choke point.
00:09:01.313 - 00:09:44.645, Speaker B: Yeah, chokepoint. All of that stuff, I think is tremendously bullish for bitcoin. And if you think about what a Trump administration means, right. Dollar is rallying on it right now. That's because rates have gone a lot higher. But if you live in a world where there's some doubts with respect to the US and you have things like gold hitting fresh all time highs every other day and silver breaking out and this whole monetary debasement argument going and leadership that isn't the world doesn't look at Trump and being like he isn't focused on that.
00:09:44.685 - 00:09:47.741, Speaker A: He's not the guy that ends the debt problem.
00:09:47.893 - 00:10:46.623, Speaker B: Yeah, quite the opposite. And eventually, if the Fed's going to have to start printing money again to manage the balance sheet because nobody wants to buy US paper at those existing levels. And if the levels go to where the market clearing level is, that's too burdensome on the treasury and the government. And so if you start getting closer and closer to that point, like bitcoin will certainly go. And I think one of the things folks have to keep in mind is that there's kind of a positive price convexity to bitcoin in the sense that folks, once bitcoin breaks to fresh all time highs, people would be like, why is it doing that? It's like doing that because of these fundamental reasons. And then folks are forced to chase if they're unallocated under allocated. And it just has this, you know, positive feedback loop that I think will get catalyzed by the Trump victory.
00:10:46.759 - 00:10:51.719, Speaker A: Well, it's going to be interesting. I can't wait to see this. Do you think it's going to be volatile on election night? I mean, absolutely.
00:10:51.767 - 00:10:51.943, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:51.959 - 00:11:14.994, Speaker A: We don't usually get even when we get them the same day, which is most elections, although not in some of the prior ones. Not in 2000. Not in 2020. Right. But well changed by the time you woke up in 2020. But you know, polls typically close at 6, 7, 8pm on the East Coast. We, when we've learned the same night, we haven't usually learned until 11 or midnight.
00:11:14.994 - 00:11:24.321, Speaker A: But equity futures markets open around 8. Right. At 8, 6pm 6pm so they'll, I mean there'll be plenty of ways to trade traditional equities, everything.
00:11:24.393 - 00:11:24.787, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:24.881 - 00:11:27.287, Speaker A: Bitcoin and crypto markets are 24,7.
00:11:27.471 - 00:11:28.239, Speaker B: You think there's going to be a.
00:11:28.247 - 00:11:32.311, Speaker A: Lot of people trying to read, read tea leaves and look at exit polls and actively trade.
00:11:32.383 - 00:11:40.519, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. And you know, I think for those that, you know, aren't professional tea leaf raiders.
00:11:40.567 - 00:11:41.759, Speaker A: Yeah, not a great idea.
00:11:41.807 - 00:11:43.935, Speaker B: Wait till you have some like, reasonable.
00:11:43.975 - 00:11:49.991, Speaker A: Measure similar to what you said at the top of this. Talk about, you know, being the fast follow. Probably wait for the trend to be established.
00:11:50.063 - 00:11:50.271, Speaker B: Yes.
00:11:50.303 - 00:11:51.779, Speaker A: It's going to be an exciting one though, huh?
00:11:51.887 - 00:11:54.275, Speaker B: I mean, absolutely. I'll be in the office.
00:11:54.355 - 00:11:58.011, Speaker A: Yeah. Bibneta BB from Galaxy Trading. As always, my friend, thank you so much.
00:11:58.123 - 00:11:58.755, Speaker B: Pleasure. Thank you.
