00:00:01.280 - 00:00:19.662, Speaker A: It is a very dynamic ecosystem. Like, things are changing so quickly, and the opportunity set is immense, but the risk that comes with that is also immense. And so in order to be effective in what we do, we need to be on top of the risk management at all times and adapt.
00:00:19.758 - 00:00:57.560, Speaker B: We've very quickly discovered that transparency and trust is everything, right? And so it is incumbent on us, given our stature within the ecosystem, to continue to do what we can, to elevate the conversation, to challenge people to think a little bit more about what crypto can be. And part of that is not only delivering solutions, but also educating, staying present with folks and steering them away from the failures of certain bad actors. And, you know, celebrating the triumph that was. The technology that never wavered in any.
00:00:57.592 - 00:01:33.980, Speaker C: Way in 22 galaxy has a major role to play in the future for this industry. We've come out strong, we've come out as a leader. We clearly demonstrated our prowess in risk management, and I think we can help others get there. I think we can help be a part of the building that's going on. When I look back at two of the transactions we just did, whether it's GK eight on the custodial technology side, or I look at the Helios transaction on the mining side, there's a lot that we can do in terms of bringing solutions to our clients and counterparties and to bring new people into the ecosystem.
00:01:34.132 - 00:02:00.626, Speaker D: For crypto to really scale, you do need the large money centers and allocators and regulators and banks ultimately participating in this. We've done a survey in our group, over $40 trillion of allocators that we've gone out to and asked them where they are in crypto. About one in four has some exposure to crypto, either through venture or maybe through a hedge fund or maybe through direct crypto. 25% won't touch it and about 50% are interested and they want to learn.
00:02:00.690 - 00:02:15.398, Speaker A: The biggest risk that I see facing the industry right now is really macro. You can look at adoption and think about adoption as a risk. Like, is tradfi going to step in? Are traditional institutional players going to step in? They will step in.
00:02:15.446 - 00:02:54.404, Speaker B: I think when we talk about our new mantra, this engineering a new economic paradigm, that's quite an ambitious thing to say, and it could mean so many different things. But what I'm really excited about with recent acquisitions and the way that we handled the storm in 22 is really honing in on how we can take steps to, you know, eat the proverbial elephant one bit at a time, leading with tech integrations, actually developing solutions for our clients and, you know, using our privilege platform for good.
