00:00:08.920 - 00:00:18.526, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. Yo, the market's on a heater so get up out your seat or take a lap around the studio?
00:00:18.590 - 00:00:20.230, Speaker B: Your ears up to the speaker there's.
00:00:20.262 - 00:01:01.142, Speaker A: No one as elite like my machines are behind the meter cause I'm shining always finding hashes like I'm grinding the path to greater freedom is a road that's always winding so I'll race it, victory, I taste it lazy is a snake pit but you gotta keep it real cause facsimiles are fake shake and break the power of placebo jump halmer trades every single hour on the sibo some dummies call the corn a bubble or flower yo but we know that there's more to what we're building than decentralized casino I do it differently bring poetry to industry so many financial instruments that you could call it symphony my infantry is gallantry, infinity and majesty I'm savage with the passages when I'm rapping on galaxy brands. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne.
00:01:01.158 - 00:01:05.422, Speaker B: Head of firm wide research at Galaxy Digital. Thank you for listening to Galaxy brains. We have a great show for you today.
00:01:05.558 - 00:01:09.158, Speaker A: John Palmer, president of CBO Digital Markets, is our guest.
00:01:09.206 - 00:01:16.086, Speaker B: We're going to talk about the intersection of traditional markets, market structure, and crypto. It's a fascinating discussion. We'll also check with our good friend.
00:01:16.110 - 00:01:17.790, Speaker A: Bimnet, a BB from Galaxy trading, as.
00:01:17.822 - 00:01:38.822, Speaker B: Always, to talk markets. And before we get to all of that, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to disclaimer in the podcast notes. And note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Let's hop right into the show. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnett. Welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:01:38.958 - 00:01:40.154, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:01:40.454 - 00:02:13.974, Speaker B: So bitcoin, I guess, is technically flat a little bit, although what we did earlier this week hit a yearly high of nearly 53k. But now we're back in the 51 range. I mean, it's basically the same range. We've been over 50k for nine consecutive days. Ether has outperformed a little bit in the last week or two, but still, I would say below where it was the last time bitcoin was at 50k. So still also kind of in its range in the scheme of things. So not a ton of news, crypto, major price action wise, since we last spoke.
00:02:13.974 - 00:02:17.254, Speaker B: Is that your view of the crypto markets at the moment.
00:02:17.674 - 00:03:08.164, Speaker C: Yeah. I would tell you that the price action we've seen over the past week is, is incredibly constructive. What you're seeing is an asset class maturing in front of your face. Basically, the ETF volumes have started to materially go higher. You've had consistent inflows, dips have been bought, and in ETH, it's less institutional right now. But I think what's capturing folks with respect to ETH is just the broader crypto narrative around tokenization stablecoins. I can't tell you the amount of meetings that I'm just getting pulled into about this different effort, that other effort.
00:03:08.164 - 00:03:24.756, Speaker C: It seems like now people have finally realized that it's here to last. It's not some fad where some bank or whatever random firm like for a year invests in it. And then the next year it's like.
00:03:24.900 - 00:03:28.804, Speaker B: Oh yeah, they do innovation theater, which I used to call it. No, it seems more durable.
00:03:28.844 - 00:03:55.420, Speaker C: Now that is exactly how I would describe it. It seems much more durable. And I think that makes folks very excited for where ETH's gonna be on a go forward basis. And then I genuinely think three k is a big level. It's the highest level ETH has been at April 22, basically. And there's lots of good reasons for it. Eigen layer has been really constructive.
00:03:55.420 - 00:03:56.740, Speaker C: Bitcoin's been doing well.
00:03:56.812 - 00:03:59.724, Speaker B: It's high beta wealth effects restaking situation.
00:03:59.804 - 00:04:02.156, Speaker C: Yeah. Supply that's getting staked.
00:04:02.220 - 00:04:19.044, Speaker B: And it's been, I would point out too, I think our audience will know this. But I mean, bitcoin is, I would say, more predictably scarce certainly than ETH. But ETH has been basically flat supply like for years now. And so it's also scarce is my point. So demand increases it can.
00:04:19.204 - 00:05:18.264, Speaker C: But the other thing is just like the culture of like asset allocation in the US, right? Like people just buy and hold normally in equity world in fixed income. And you know, part of it's one, if you sell something that's a taxable event, but two, like a lot of people invested in stuff to hedge themselves for fee at the basement. People are always afraid of that, right? Anyway, with ETH, you've had a ton of bag holders that just haven't sold through many cycles. And I'd say the underperformance of ETH relative to bitcoin, you can assign some of it to just how much was in bankruptcy estates. Celsius was selling a ton and you could see it on chain every day. So there was always all this supply. But now that's kind of cleared up a little bit and it looks like an asset that's just run out of sellers and you have a bit of marginal flow and markets that get set at the margin.
00:05:18.264 - 00:05:38.044, Speaker C: They're tactical guys and crypto native hedge funds, et cetera, playing for swings here and there. But broadly, ETH is in the big asset game now with bitcoin. And what do people do? They just buy, hold, accumulate, and there's tons of ETH, Maxis, et cetera, for sure. Big community and all of that.
00:05:38.084 - 00:05:39.732, Speaker B: They have interesting technology narrative with the.
00:05:39.748 - 00:05:40.396, Speaker A: L two s, really.
00:05:40.420 - 00:05:41.412, Speaker D: It's got a story, it's got a.
00:05:41.428 - 00:06:35.538, Speaker C: Chart, their flows like it's trading well. And I rarely allow myself to get there in terms, I'm moving on to bitcoin now, but I rarely let myself go there in terms of right tail stuff like the analysts on tv calling for 250 grand and a million bucks. I try to be a little bit more pragmatic about market expectations, but it's really hard not to think what the future value of bitcoin is going to be based on the current supply dynamics that we know about right now. In terms of just the flows we've had so far are exceptional. I would say at this point they weren't at the start. And that's without bitcoin. ETF's being in all the platforms, without the distribution of the entire us wealth.
00:06:35.586 - 00:06:37.642, Speaker B: Management platforms, banks, burger dealers.
00:06:37.698 - 00:07:08.642, Speaker C: Yeah, etcetera. And so I think you're just kind of at the tip of the iceberg with respect to how far reaching this ETF product is going to be. And to go along with that, you have the supply of the happening, literally supply is going to come down. And so it just kind of seems like one of those things that's just always going to have marginal buyers, really not that much in terms of sellers. It could be speculators selling, et cetera.
00:07:08.698 - 00:07:12.594, Speaker B: But one of the other sort of this year questions has been rates, right?
00:07:12.674 - 00:07:13.338, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely.
00:07:13.386 - 00:07:39.336, Speaker B: And we know we have the halving. I love your point about the advisor platforms. Not even, I mean, we've said this over the last couple of weeks, but like, frankly surprised, obviously, happily surprised with the volumes and inflows that we've seen in the ETF's even before this main market for them comes online. That's just great. That just makes me even more bullish. And that's a major one. The catalyst of various large bank or broker dealer wealth management platform turning on bitcoin.
00:07:39.336 - 00:08:24.080, Speaker B: ETF's is going to be a drip, drip, drip that you hear over the next twelve to 18 and 24 months. But the halving is a big narrative event. And I had been, I've always been of the view, especially this is what happened in 2020, right? Was the monetary easing, historic, arbitrary, crazy levels the same time that bitcoin, credible, neutral, predictable tightens you had been for a while in the fall and earlier this year it looked like the same dynamic was going to happen. Obviously the easing that we're expecting is not nearly what happened in COVID, but that arbitrary, human designed, controlled rate cuts and maybe balance sheet runoffs and easing would occur at the same time as the having again, now we're going to have the having. It looks like rate cuts won't happen at that time, right?
00:08:24.192 - 00:08:26.304, Speaker C: Most likely May or June will be the first.
00:08:26.344 - 00:08:57.114, Speaker B: Well, if it's May, that's still kind of right there. I mean, we're looking at April 20 or 19th for the having. My question is, are you surprised to see bitcoin's performance in the face of what fed funds rate at five and a quarter? Rates are so high, but bitcoin's almost at all time highs. One, do we need cuts? Two, is it better to have them sooner or later? Because I was thinking maybe even later is better since it's doing great with adhere, it gives it a second shot. What are your thoughts on that timing?
00:08:58.634 - 00:09:47.854, Speaker C: In terms of one, does the economy need cuts and that's up for debate. The current data says you don't need them. Employment's incredibly contained or low and prices, there's still upside risk to inflation, at least as far as we can tell right now. It's really up for debate. I tell you the best logic for cutting is that stuff is has normalized and you are at restrictive levels and you're let's say 200 basis points above restrictive. So you probably, if your policy objectives are met, you want to get to neutral and you're not at neutral and then your risks are. If you think your risk is more tilted towards a hard landing or unemployment ticking higher, then you should probably start cutting before that turn happens.
00:09:47.854 - 00:10:22.784, Speaker C: And so that's the logic with rate cuts. And I think it's going to be an important driver for markets. But I tell you, the scenarios are already baked in to a certain extent. We've gone from a market that prices in seven cuts to closer to three, four. You've established that range. If you go back to pricing and a lot more cuts, that's probably going to be because the economy has turned and maybe stocks will do well in that environment. They most likely will because they do well in any environment, it seems like right now.
00:10:22.784 - 00:11:05.490, Speaker C: But that's kind of where you are, I'd say. The bigger thing for me in terms of monetary policy that I think hits home even more with respect to bitcoin is the balance sheet management. If we live in a world where everybody is forced to recognize the fact that we are basically not going to be able to reduce the balance sheet at a certain point, and that ultimately, because of the fiscal situation, that the balance sheet has to be ever expanding on a go forward basis. Like the moment where we're just like printing money to buy our own debt to go spend money on social program. Social programs, any type of program, any.
00:11:05.562 - 00:11:07.266, Speaker B: Program, who knows, whatever.
00:11:07.450 - 00:11:15.944, Speaker C: And it's like, it's just that I think will kind of drive the message home about fiat, the basement. Right.
00:11:16.024 - 00:11:19.724, Speaker B: It's perpetual and inevitable in this current system.
00:11:20.464 - 00:11:34.576, Speaker C: I couldn't have said it better myself. I mean, yeah, perpetual and inevitable. And so it's a matter of time before that happens. And I think that balance sheet policy shift is kind of what I'm more focused on.
00:11:34.600 - 00:11:41.016, Speaker B: So that might be the second shot when we really, it's both when we see it, but also when it becomes understood that that's what's going to happen.
00:11:41.080 - 00:12:23.654, Speaker C: But at the end of the day, I could tell you that macro markets are the most important thing. And if Nasdaq crashes 5%, bitcoin will crash 5%. That stuff is mostly true, but I think you really have to think about bitcoin in isolation. There's a whole investor base that wasn't able to get access before. That is just getting access. Markets move at the margin, and if there are going to be more marginal buyers than sellers on a consistent basis for bitcoin, the price needs to go a lot higher, and that's kind of where we're at. And you could talk to people on either end of the monetary policy spectrum, and I don't think it would sway you on where bitcoin prices are headed.
00:12:23.654 - 00:12:31.434, Speaker C: I've talked to macro guys that are super hawkish and super dovish, but most of them are pretty bullish bitcoin, and they wish they had more.
00:12:31.514 - 00:12:42.834, Speaker B: Yep, I hear you. Well, Bim Netabeebe, my friend from Galaxy trading, as always, thank you so much. Pleasure. Let's go now to our guest, John Palmer, president of CBOE Digital Markets. Jon, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:12:42.914 - 00:12:44.082, Speaker D: Alex, thanks for having me on.
00:12:44.178 - 00:13:18.922, Speaker B: I'm really excited to have Jon on because CBO is one of the most storied and oldest derivatives and spot and equity exchanges in the world, a staple in Chicago. Some of our audience may have recently heard of CBO just very recently in crypto because several of the bitcoin spot ETF's trade on CBO's BZX exchange. But CBO was early to add bitcoin futures markets. But CBO Digital is something new and a little bit different. I think it's really interesting. So we're going to get into it with John. But before we do that, Jon, tell the audience who you are and what your background is and how you got interested in bitcoin and crypto.
00:13:19.018 - 00:14:07.346, Speaker D: Yeah. Thanks, Alex. So background basically been building exchanges, really since out of school, was a quant by education, and then just decided that I liked the intersection of tech and business and trading, and kind of fell into product management and kind of just started building from there. Most of my career has been on the equity derivative side. I joined CBO through the Bats acquisition back in 2016, having helped them build out some of the options exchanges, spent a little bit of time migrating some of the stuff that CBO was operating over to bats technology. That's when I got into futures, which we'll talk about with CBO being the first bitcoin futures contract, I think 2018 or early December 17.
00:14:07.530 - 00:14:18.602, Speaker B: Yeah, if I get my numbers, I think there was a whole thing that I think, actually, if you look at that December 17 parabolic move in bitcoin, it peaked at CBO Futures launch. So people were like, oh, no, is it bearish?
00:14:18.778 - 00:14:40.734, Speaker D: Right. It was a race between Simeon CBO. We won at least the first leg of that race. I remember all my buddies were buying bitcoin at the time. Not to tangent too much, but they're like, what do you think about this? I'm like, it's a bearish opportunity because now people can sell it. You could only buy bitcoin before. Right now, actually, folks can sell it, so be careful.
00:14:40.734 - 00:14:45.842, Speaker D: And they're like, understand what that means because they don't work in markets. And so I was just, you could.
00:14:45.858 - 00:14:48.490, Speaker B: Definitely short it in a way that you really couldn't before, for sure.
00:14:48.562 - 00:14:49.178, Speaker C: Right?
00:14:49.346 - 00:15:27.894, Speaker D: Anyway, yeah. 17, moved in the options, ran the options business for CIBO for a number of years, jumped into crypto in 21, did a stint at a startup in Bermuda building international derivatives exchange for institutional participants for just shy of a year. And then Cibo had bought Aris X, which became CBO digital. And that deal was in May of 22 when it finalized and so I came back to rejoin CBO and run the digital effort. So Boomerang employee, as I like to term it. Some people think that's funny and some people don't, but it is what it is.
00:15:27.974 - 00:15:59.444, Speaker B: Well, I mean, I love the story. And Aris X, I think, was one of the original institutional grades bot markets for bitcoin and other digital assets. We interacted with them when I was at fidelity for a long time, and so interesting that now at CBO, it makes a lot of sense. They had built great institutional trading tech at a time when. And I think this is where we're going to really start going in this conversation, but at a time when. If you think about the 2017 rally in crypto assets bubble, if you want to call it that. I don't call it that because you don't get multiple bubbles over a decade.
00:15:59.524 - 00:16:00.212, Speaker D: In the same asset.
00:16:00.268 - 00:16:32.344, Speaker B: Doesn't make sense. Yeah, it's not a tulip. I mean, show me where tulips went up again. I saw a recent chart, actually, where I think put out a chart about, like, various bubbles over the last 20 years. And they have, like, China, and then, like, housing and, like, China, and then, like, they had tech, and then they had bitcoin, and then now they have AI, and I'm like, wait, so you're just looking at the one from 21 and calling that the bitcoin bubble, but, like, you used to call the other one? Or what about the one even before that? That's a little bit of a tangent. But that. That move, that rally throughout 2017, happened on the back of very scant market infrastructure.
00:16:32.344 - 00:16:54.252, Speaker B: It was exchanges like Poloniex and, you know, bitstamp. And some of these are still around. I'm not saying they're not relevant now, but that was, like, all there was. It was coinbase, right? There was no institutional custody. There was no institutional settlement. There was no institutional market. And Eris and others were born out of that, along with many other types of companies.
00:16:54.252 - 00:17:08.452, Speaker B: Galaxy was founded at the end of that, like all the lending companies, all the institutional custody companies. Right? So there was clear market need was defined. So what has. That was. God, it's 24. That was, what, six years ago? Seven years ago.
00:17:08.468 - 00:17:11.024, Speaker D: I had to do the math. I was like, wow, seven years ago.
00:17:12.124 - 00:17:20.788, Speaker B: How far has that nascent and then direly needed institutional exchange infrastructure come in those last seven years?
00:17:20.876 - 00:18:15.576, Speaker D: Yeah. No, it's crazy to think about how things have changed in the crypto space over those seven years. And I'm sure we're going to get into a lot of it today, from our perspective, how much has changed. I think we're just now really seeing that adoption that I think Arisex was formed. And what CiBo Digital is really about, even today for back in 17, was providing an ecosystem, an experience platform that institutions that were trading other asset, highly liquid asset classes in the US are used to. And so when you think about that, you think about some really small nuances, like bare metal matching engines that accept fix, or binary APIs that allow people to co locate. And when you look at 2017, everything was websocket and rest API installed.
00:18:15.576 - 00:18:53.876, Speaker D: There's a lot of that, and it's used. But if you're latency sensitive, you want colocate, you want probably something even better than fix, but you'll take fix if that's all you have to do. And so that was what it was founded for. And so I think we've seen the industry start to come that way more and more every, call it six or eight months, but it's taken a while. And so it's really interesting to see some of the pain points that institutions have over that lifetime of that six years. Obviously, I wasn't a part of the team for the whole six years. So the pain points in 18 and 19 are certainly different than the pain points now.
00:18:53.876 - 00:19:05.952, Speaker D: But I think as an industry, whether it's us international, we're slowly, like, you run into a pain point, then we solve it. Run into a pain point, we solve it. But that cycle is like an eight to twelve month solving cycle, right?
00:19:06.048 - 00:19:34.608, Speaker B: Yeah. One of the things that's so interesting about the exchange space, many things are, but one that I'm coming to mind at the moment is that exchanges are. Inequities are regulated by the SEC. Right. The exchange act governs exchanges. Now, without getting into too much about why this is or not, but digital assets are broadly not regulated by the SEC, despite the SEC says they're all crypto asset securities. And if that were true, then they would have jurisdiction.
00:19:34.608 - 00:19:52.804, Speaker B: There's a lot of lawsuits about this. Our audience knows. Well, how does CiBO digital, though, approach that, either in which assets you do trade enlist with what is the broad, not negotiation, but posture with regulators is obviously a traditionally regulated, broad organization.
00:19:53.184 - 00:19:59.512, Speaker D: Yeah. So it's a really important point. I think there's, you know, 4005, I don't know how many coins out there.
00:19:59.568 - 00:20:01.160, Speaker B: I bet you it's like 100,000 right now.
00:20:01.192 - 00:20:01.680, Speaker D: Yeah, who knows?
00:20:01.712 - 00:20:02.896, Speaker B: I don't even look, I mean, maybe.
00:20:02.920 - 00:20:06.320, Speaker D: You could say, like, the top hundred are the most liquid. And even then, the top 20 is.
00:20:06.392 - 00:20:06.600, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:06.632 - 00:20:07.984, Speaker D: You know, and then, even then, most of them.
00:20:08.024 - 00:20:08.344, Speaker B: Totally.
00:20:08.384 - 00:20:09.768, Speaker D: Most of it's in bitcoin and ether.
00:20:09.856 - 00:20:10.192, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:10.248 - 00:20:26.436, Speaker D: Right. And so when we look at the tradable universe, we only list five coins today. Right. And it's bitcoin. It's. It's ETH, that bitcoin cash, litecoin, and then USDC, stablecoin. And that approach has been conservative compared to a lot of other platforms.
00:20:26.436 - 00:21:02.336, Speaker D: And we've done it intentionally that way because the lack of clarity in terms of we don't know what is or isn't. And even though there may be some demand for, especially some of the more popular layer ones out there, the risk isn't worth the reward at this point. And so we're waiting kind of, for that clarity to be able to offer that to our customers in a box. I'll call it a box. Whatever box it is, whether it's a sec, CFTC, some new. Yeah, whatever the guidance is, just give me a box. Tell me what the rules are.
00:21:02.336 - 00:21:08.552, Speaker D: We're gonna. We operate 28 markets under the Cibo umbrella globally, so. And they're all regulated in some way.
00:21:08.568 - 00:21:10.344, Speaker B: Shape or form, and probably all slightly differently.
00:21:10.384 - 00:21:11.016, Speaker D: And they're all a little bit.
00:21:11.040 - 00:21:11.992, Speaker B: You can certainly handle.
00:21:12.048 - 00:21:12.880, Speaker D: So we can figure it out.
00:21:12.912 - 00:21:27.200, Speaker B: It's just there aren't any rules, really. Exactly. I mean, obviously there are some that apply here and there, but in terms of market regulation, it's really not clear which you're supposed to. I used to call those the PayPal five. Right. The one that I didn't hear, I think was. Did you say litecoin?
00:21:27.272 - 00:21:28.536, Speaker D: We do. Yep. Litecoin.
00:21:28.680 - 00:21:30.336, Speaker B: What's the one? Dogecoin. No dogecoin.
00:21:30.440 - 00:21:31.448, Speaker D: No dogecoin. Doge.
00:21:31.496 - 00:21:39.088, Speaker B: Totally legit in my view here. It's a bitcoin fork. It has no pre mine supply. It's proof of work. Right. Anyway, you should consider listing.
00:21:39.176 - 00:21:40.408, Speaker D: I'll put you in touch with my team.
00:21:40.496 - 00:21:45.040, Speaker B: I'm a big fan of dog money in general. I think dogs deserve their own decentralized cryptocurrency.
00:21:45.152 - 00:21:46.799, Speaker D: You convince them, I'll list it.
00:21:46.964 - 00:22:24.824, Speaker B: I totally get that because that list has sort of been long adopted by other players like CBO, where it's, you know, most of them are all bitcoin forks except for Ethereum. And they have more regulatory clarity, I would just say, than further down the list. Certainly the 2017 ICO coins or the 2020 and later, like venture backed coins, all much trickier, I think, from a fact pattern standpoint. I don't think personally they're securities, but I mean, much different than looking at a bitcoin or a bitcoin fork. So makes sense. What other interesting you're talking about bare metal and latency. This is something really interesting.
00:22:24.824 - 00:22:58.190, Speaker B: Does your CBO digital, do you see high frequency trading? Is that something that's going to start? You can't really do it well with websocket and traditional Internet architecture, but obviously Wall street and Chicago trading venues have enabled high speed trading for years. It's a big feature in markets. I think some of the most profitable and valuable trading companies in the world are high speed trading firms. Is that something that's going to come at scale? Do you see it already? Is that a key constituency that you build for?
00:22:58.342 - 00:23:50.014, Speaker D: Yeah, I do think we see it already. And we can always divide it in two camps. You have the high frequency trading. When people think about the takers, the folks that are removing the market and acting on market news as quickly as possible and being able to say, I have an opportunity at this price, I want to hit that price. But you also have the market makers on the other side of that that also have to adjust to that market news. And from that perspective, when you think about how much global fragmented liquidity and market data there is in crypto, it's actually, in my opinion, more important to be able to support that type of infrastructure for those participants because they want to be able to act on news or a funding rate change in some perpetual in the international space to be able to update maybe how they view the spot market.
00:23:50.094 - 00:23:55.278, Speaker B: Interesting. So more news even and harder to find news makes it even maybe more needed.
00:23:55.406 - 00:23:56.150, Speaker D: Correct.
00:23:56.342 - 00:24:11.374, Speaker B: I guess because if you're following us equities and trading those at high speed, all the news is coming from one or two locations. You don't need, I don't know, mandarin speaker to know what's going on with a top, you know, us tech company. Well, maybe you do. I'm not a market maker, so I don't either. I don't know.
00:24:11.494 - 00:24:12.646, Speaker D: I'm not sure where they're getting the.
00:24:12.670 - 00:24:42.972, Speaker B: Global nature conglomerating now into a high speed institutional grid exchange is interesting. Are you seeing, you know, uptick in volume overall over time? America? I mean, we were talking before we started recording about how the bitcoin spotty tfs have, have increased the US liquidity, have increased liquidity in general for bitcoin, but also increased the US exchange market share. Are you seeing some of that in general, and if so, what are the drivers in your mind. I mean, ETF's are one that I mentioned, but is general institutional interest?
00:24:43.148 - 00:25:15.826, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's a couple of things you've mentioned. So, I mean, to answer your earlier question, yes, we are seeing some increase. And just to kind of, we don't publish monthly or daily stats, although there is a public web socket that anyone can go ahead and kind of look at the data. You want to see it if you're interested. But, you know, when we close the deal, call it summer of 22, we're doing maybe five or 7 million a day. And now we're doing, I think yesterday we did over 200 million. And that's up and down.
00:25:15.826 - 00:25:52.456, Speaker D: It's not flat, 200 million every single day. But we've been in that ballpark for now, really leading into the ETF approval and post the ETF approval, and we had pockets of that even last year. So we've had a really great ramp as we've onboarded more and more institutional participants, and I think we're going to continue to see that ramp. We have a really great pipeline. I think interest is peaked. I would say we always see interest peak when the price rises, generally as people tend to engage more when there's a rally and tend to pull back, maybe when there's a sustained kind of bear market. And that's just kind of how we've seen it.
00:25:52.456 - 00:26:18.108, Speaker D: But the ETF approval also has driven quite a lot of interest. It's interest from new participants, but it's also interest from existing participants, because now you have a whole nother ecosystem built on top of the spot market, and those participants want to hedge. If I'm making a market in an ETF, I need to be able to hedge my exposure. A lot of them are going to go to the spot market and they look for markets and counterparties that they know and they trust. So that's where we really see the opportunity.
00:26:18.156 - 00:26:37.804, Speaker B: Can you connect into CBO digital through, like, traditional, like, I don't know, like traditional screens, basically. Like, if I'm a traditional trader, like, or is it some new bespoke architecture? For example, if I connect to, like a crypto exchange, like, it's not on my traditional oms or it's not on my traditional Bloomberg or what, or whatever. Like, is that, is that something you guys offer?
00:26:37.884 - 00:26:56.006, Speaker D: Yeah, there's still some integration depending on where, but the way we structured it, especially being built kind of around fix, is to provide that kind of connectivity. So that way, if you're a traditional Oms and the majority of connections you use is likely fixed. The integration is low. Right. So then it just says, and it's more of just an opportunity plugging into.
00:26:56.070 - 00:26:57.942, Speaker B: Any traditional vendor, right.
00:26:57.958 - 00:27:17.236, Speaker D: But we're connected to a lot of different isvs, both traditional and crypto native. Right. So if you're using a TT or you're using a talos or you're using like a CQG or even other platforms that are very, you know, call it tradfi in terms of, you know, being able to access some of the other markets, whether they're futures, derivatives, or even spot markets, you can, you can access CBO digital through those.
00:27:17.310 - 00:27:46.204, Speaker B: Nice. That makes sense. I mean, it's so funny, I think about Sam Bankman free. Not to raise Sam, but FTX was sort of hacked together, right? And people originally thought the tech was good. Then, of course, we then used to see plenty of rumblings, oh, it's down, it won't work like whatever, just from traders complaining it didn't work that well. Then, of course, it came out throughout his whole, the trial and the unwind there, that actually, their supposed famed liquidation engine didn't even exist. Right.
00:27:46.204 - 00:28:53.944, Speaker B: So just drawing a comparison between so many times in crypto, you've got, in some cases, very brilliant people, but with no real markets experience, maybe great coders or in some cases, cryptographers, you see this across defi that we tend to reinvent the history of financial services. It's like speedrunning the entire history, right, without sometimes learning the lessons that finance and trading learned over the centuries. And that can be a real loss. One example is that they call tokenized assets from the real world. They call them real world assets, RWA, but that term already exists. They weren't aware that Rwas are already a thing. I make this point a little bit long windedly to say that it's really, I think, refreshing and nice to finally have exchanges and venues that aren't built by neophytes to the trading world that are bringing some of the long time we want innovation and crypto and bitcoin is certainly new and disruptive, but there's still things that we can learn from the traditional world.
00:28:53.984 - 00:29:47.024, Speaker D: It's funny, I wrote a piece about a year ago, I put on LinkedIn, and I think at the end we said, what's the next big thing in crypto? And I said, traditional finance. And I got a lot of people that laughed at that. And I said, but in all, honestly, sometimes you have to crawl before you run. Most of the time you do. Unless you're going to be a world class track, track athlete, and you just, you know, you come out of the gate running or something like that. But I view that as kind of bringing in the market structure the way traditional finance has kind of approached running markets with different participants, doing different types of things, all for a purpose. Because if we want to bring them on this journey with us, right, which I think we all do because of, similar to what's happening with the spot ETF, the amount of opportunity it brings into the ecosystem in terms of capital.
00:29:47.024 - 00:30:46.920, Speaker D: Right. You're going to need to make it look similar to what they're already doing. And it's not because we want to, it's because there's a risk team, there's a compliance team, there's an operational team at that entity that may not be willing to sign off on the change because there's a security risk or there's a operational lift that's over and above what they typically do. There's all these other pieces outside of the commercial business opportunity that we need to solve, make it look, feel, and be the same as an equity trade or a derivatives trade, the more likely you're going to be able to bring them on the journey. And then, sure, we can innovate. We can look for opportunities to make the infrastructure, the value chain, streamlined, more efficient on chain, off chain, public versus private chain. We can have all these conversations, but it's better to have most of those folks in on the journey and solve it with them, then try to solve it, and then bring them this.
00:30:46.920 - 00:30:53.096, Speaker D: I flipped the entire structure on its head, and now I want you to change the way you completely do your business. I think that's a really hard sell.
00:30:53.160 - 00:31:41.424, Speaker B: So one example of building the crypto, and it's innovative and different, but trying to bring it to the trad five, but it doesn't jive is things like settlement and custody. Custody is one example where, sure, you're safekeeping a record in that way, it's the same, but the record data structure is different. Settlement finality is different. Right. So it's key material, and it's not like whatever it is that an equity share is, ultimately, it's at your bd, but it's also at the DTC, who knows? So trying to force that in is very difficult for people. And it wasn't even until, I mean, fidelity was one of the first that launched an institutional custodian for this reason. This was something that we and others, certainly not just me, but when I was there, it was decided this was like one of the clearest base case market needs, because trying to force people into that new thing was very difficult.
00:31:41.424 - 00:32:07.522, Speaker B: Has that improved on those two examples, specifically settlement? There was a company in Chicago I knew for a long time and many attempts at some kind of central clearing and settlement thing. But either it required a lot of capital and I wanted to trust a startup to be that. And then people said maybe it should be consortium of all the exchanges or all the custodians or all the whatevers, and everyone's trying to build a network. Has that improved?
00:32:07.618 - 00:32:24.898, Speaker D: Yeah. You know, I think we've certainly come a long way from where we were in 17 or even 14 or 2010. If you really think about how, you know, you go back and watch your Netflix shows and you learn about, you know, I can't remember the canadian exchange that they have it.
00:32:24.946 - 00:32:25.898, Speaker B: Quadriga CX.
00:32:25.946 - 00:32:28.554, Speaker D: Yes, that one. Yes. So I watched that one.
00:32:28.714 - 00:32:30.442, Speaker B: Yeah, that was a mystery just to.
00:32:30.458 - 00:32:32.402, Speaker D: Kind of like, wow, I didn't really know about it at the time.
00:32:32.458 - 00:32:33.186, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:32:33.290 - 00:33:24.758, Speaker D: But looking back through the lens, obviously it's easy to be Monday morning quarterback and be like, oh, we should have done it that way and that way. But I think we've come a long way, but it's different. So the way you, custody equity is likely different than the way you're going to have to custody crypto. You've mentioned obviously the key material and those types of deals, whether or not we see the same market structure or the end state market structure. And crypto, as we see in equities today, I think is where everybody is maybe butting heads. But I do think making it as agnostic and as similar for those traditional entities to be able to enter is important, meaning they have choice in custodian today, and a lot of the assets they use, they have choice in prime broker. They have choice in the way they execute, who they execute through, how they get borrow land, financing, all the kind of things.
00:33:24.758 - 00:34:00.892, Speaker D: I still don't think there's enough of that in the crypto ecosystem, and maybe it's from their lens, I would say maybe not enough of the same players. So over time, as those players start to enter digital assets, whether it's crypto or real world assets or whatever, we'll start to see those services being offered, and I think that'll unlock a lot of it. The challenge from an exchange perspective I've looked at is those things didn't exist when platforms, I'll call them platforms because they're doing a lot of different things other than just being an exchange, were created. You had to have a wallet, you had to custody assets.
00:34:00.988 - 00:34:02.700, Speaker B: You had to refund your account.
00:34:02.812 - 00:34:58.314, Speaker D: Whether you're a custodian or not, or a qualified custodian or not, even you still had to have a wallet where people gave you coin and even dollars before you could really do anything on the platform. We're still really there, though. We've seen in the last, I call it twelve months, some really great, I want to call it innovation, but really great development in that space where now you have like, the go network copper clear loop, you're starting to see these kind of, like, networks of custodians and exchanges where now all of a sudden, you can trade without moving your coin, which I think is important, because maybe not everybody, everybody's level of trust is different. And who am I to say you should trust me? Well, you know, maybe you don't want to. And if I want to compete for your business and I want to operate an exchange, I can't look at any other exchange that. That I'm used to running or building that holds the asset class. So I kind of say maybe I shouldn't hold it.
00:34:58.314 - 00:35:26.340, Speaker D: Right. But there's a transitionary period there, and I think we're starting to be in that. Where the end state is, you know, I think is really interesting, but this whole concept of self custody or being able to trade out of your cold wallets, I think is the right direction for the ecosystem. But it's still an island approach. You have islands, and we need to solve all the islands. And obviously, who does that eloquently and with the least amount of friction for the end customer will have a really interesting product.
00:35:26.412 - 00:35:30.224, Speaker B: Yeah. That'd be a big company or consortium or whatever it is.
00:35:30.804 - 00:35:31.116, Speaker D: Right.
00:35:31.140 - 00:36:00.694, Speaker B: You don't send your apple stock to NYSE. If you want to sell it, there's a settlement cycle, and I don't know, but as a necessary. That didn't exist. So every crypto exchange, every crypto platform now, because they're not all like this, to your point, but they all were custodians by, you know, de facto custodians. Right? They had to. And it's not just, yeah, you don't want to exchanges, historically don't do that. So I can see why you wouldn't want to.
00:36:00.694 - 00:36:14.214, Speaker B: But also, the SEC's new custody rule proposal actually requires that advisors don't pre fund, or what they require is that all these assets stay in qualified custody.
00:36:14.294 - 00:36:14.914, Speaker D: Right.
00:36:15.524 - 00:36:27.036, Speaker B: That it should be pushing further in that direction. Right. Yeah, we're getting close. You mentioned a couple examples I mean, can we trade now, depending on if my setup is correct, on CBO digital without pre funding, basically, and settling?
00:36:27.180 - 00:36:30.804, Speaker D: Not yet. Not yet, right. So I would say not yet, but I think that's the evolution.
00:36:30.884 - 00:36:31.124, Speaker B: Right.
00:36:31.164 - 00:36:49.244, Speaker D: I think as we see these. So from our perspective, we're watching that, right. And I think as we see those expand, we want to embrace them. Ultimately, that's where I want to go in the sense I don't want to hold coin or dollars for that execution. Clear trades, which I think is interesting because we haven't talked about this yet.
00:36:49.284 - 00:36:51.624, Speaker B: What does this mean, by the way? Explain to the audience.
00:36:52.164 - 00:37:38.650, Speaker D: So clearing, is that part of, like, the exchange plumbing or financial market plumbing, as I call it, that always gets overlooked a little bit. And that's this concept of you have a trade match and that technology is, can be advanced or can be pretty simple, but the concept of clearing is actually saying, okay, yes, I have some relationship, or I have the assets and I actually can make sure the trade happens, right. It's settled. You give me your bitcoin and I give you dollars. Right. If there's no one in between who hits go first. If I'm clearing it in between, then you and I can trade and I can depend, I can trust on this entity, this third entity, this third party entity to make sure that all this happens.
00:37:38.650 - 00:37:47.734, Speaker D: And if it doesn't happen, that clearinghouse stands in the middle. So if you default and you didn't give me the coin, the clearinghouse is going to make sure I get the coin.
00:37:48.154 - 00:37:51.514, Speaker B: And maybe they take recourse against the broken side of the trade or something.
00:37:51.554 - 00:38:19.532, Speaker D: If you think about equities, there's multiple parties in between all that. It happens between you and a third party. There's prime brokers, there's clearing brokers, there's retail brokers, and maybe it's the same entity, maybe it's multiple entities that doesn't really exist yet in crypto. One of the things that we are working on at Cibo Digital is that concept of a CCP for crypto assets. And we're really already doing it today in the sense that we have two legal entities. One runs the exchange, one runs the clearinghouse. We call it where everything is cleared and settled and where all the licenses are.
00:38:19.532 - 00:38:32.798, Speaker D: And what we are now starting to do is clear for other platforms. If you want to stand up just an exchange or just an EC, but you don't want to deal with the clearing and settlement, you can send the trades to us and we'll clear it.
00:38:32.846 - 00:38:59.358, Speaker B: That's cool. And Cibo has a trusted brand and size because that's part of it. It's almost like an escrow clearing. This is one of the things I was alluding to when some of the startups wanted to solve this problem. It's like, well, why would us, two big traders, let's say we're big traders, why would we meet it little bitty startup to do that for us? You want some capital, some experience, some name, some reputation behind that central. I mean, because that is by definition a trusted third party.
00:38:59.406 - 00:39:47.428, Speaker D: Right, right. And so you start that with, it's all pre funded today, right. So the risk is pretty low, obviously, but for the participant, you have counterparty risk in the sense that you're giving someone, in this case CBO digital, the assets. But ultimately being able to do that where now I no longer hold the assets and those assets are held at some third party custodian, is kind of like what I'll call that utopia, right? But really it's not anything new. It's the way equity markets have functioned for decades upon decades. And so it's, I think that evolution will bring a tremendous amount of buy side entrants that are standing on the fence as saying, I'm trading derivatives because it's fully regulated, it's structured different, and I'm comfortable with it, but I'm not trading spot because of some of those concerns that would be solved by them.
00:39:47.516 - 00:40:22.412, Speaker B: One of the barriers has been that, again, it comes to regulatory, is that the traditional custodians and traditional exchanges that have already built all of this stuff. I think for the most part, we're talking a lot of times about messages. It's electronic messaging. Most of these processes, obviously on one end, you do have settlement and delivery of a different type of assets. So there's some tech that's crypto native, but the matching engines, there's tons of those, right? Like you said, they can be simple, complex, but it's a relatively solved problem. Some of that is like out of the box technology, clearing it's trust. There's probably tech for that, too.
00:40:22.412 - 00:40:45.934, Speaker B: But again, it doesn't really matter what you're clearing, as long as both parties know about it and can agree to it and the third party can clear it. But because there hasn't been regulated custodians, like the existing regular custodians, the big banks, the ones that cause custody equities, they're not allowed to touch crypto. So none of the crypto settlement evolution could go through their existing pipes, basically.
00:40:45.974 - 00:41:08.268, Speaker D: Well, they could. I think there's just been some strong guidance potentially might hinder commercial opportunity. Right. Because we could go in the room, maybe it's an SAB 1121. But I, you know, if I'm, if I'm running a business out, not an exchange business, and I need to custody a customer's assets and I need to hold that as a liability on my balance sheet.
00:41:08.436 - 00:41:10.460, Speaker B: And if you have bank capital requirements.
00:41:10.532 - 00:41:26.270, Speaker D: Exactly. Now you've nailed it. Now all of a sudden I need to park a bunch of capital in some account that I'm earning very limited interest, if any, on it, just because I'm holding a customer's, you know, non cat, you know, crypto assets. In this case, it makes the business case that much harder.
00:41:26.372 - 00:41:37.802, Speaker B: Yeah, it's impossible in the scheme of things, even if you're not a bank. You could. Broker dealer is also custody, but the broker dealer guidance is and stuff have been scant as well.
00:41:37.898 - 00:41:39.242, Speaker D: It's been difficult.
00:41:39.298 - 00:41:58.146, Speaker B: All right, let me get a little nerdy with you because I wanted to ask you about Best X, the Reg NMS rule that. Well, first maybe you can tell us what that is. But I want to ask you how it applies to crypto, if at all. I don't think it actually technically really would apply yet. But is there even a concept of it in crypto? But maybe you can explain what it is in the first place.
00:41:58.250 - 00:42:26.724, Speaker D: High level. Put my equity hat on, though. I would always say I was in equity derivatives. And the market structure there is very different than equities. Not to get even nerdier here on this stuff, but Bestx essentially is a requirement on your broker dealer to make sure that you get the best price that's available at the time. If bitcoin is trading at 50,000, as an example to use for bitcoin, but you bought it at 51,000. Sounds dollars like a bad trade, right? Like you just spent an extra thousand bucks.
00:42:26.724 - 00:43:05.068, Speaker D: If you're buying a whole bitcoin, you probably don't want to spend that extra thousand bucks. And so I think how you execute crypto is different in the sense that you go to one place today, right? You go to a platform and you get their market, right? And that's the price you get. What if it was trading at a different price on a different platform? You have to go onboard there, then you have to deal with the routing, and then the whole world gets very complex, and then you have capital issues because maybe those are all pre funded. And so how do you manage all that? Right. It becomes very complex. That's where we like our setup. Obviously, I'm biased, but being an intermediary, we're not.
00:43:05.068 - 00:43:35.898, Speaker D: We don't want retail to. We don't onboard retail. So you would go through a retail broker or another intermediary, and then they would be able to access our platform and likely other places, and then they could amalgamate all the prices and then try to, you know, give you the best offer to buy your bitcoin at. But I think we're still in the very early stage. There are some places that do it, right, but it's not required at the regulatory level.
00:43:35.946 - 00:43:39.098, Speaker B: And it is tricky because bitcoin's a global asset. Right.
00:43:39.226 - 00:43:39.946, Speaker D: It is really hard.
00:43:40.010 - 00:44:19.924, Speaker B: And there have historically been some. They're idiosyncratic, usually when they happen, but there have been dislocations between global markets as well. But that makes it tricky, I think, of bitcoin and really all of crypto because of its seamless global nature, because it really runs on the Internet, which is global, more like a commodity in terms of how it trades. Maybe in other ways, too, but in terms of how it trades, a major equity may trade will actually, in the end, trade on one exchange. So the execution ultimately happens. You can go into dark pools and these other types of execution venues, but eventually it all hits the New York Stock Exchange or CbOe BZX or something. Right.
00:44:19.924 - 00:44:21.640, Speaker B: Or does some trade on multiple.
00:44:21.752 - 00:44:33.400, Speaker D: I mean, you can. I mean, the equity market structure is. There's a lot of places you can execute, and then everything, everything gets reported. Reported right to the. To the tape. And so you can see all the trades. Right.
00:44:33.400 - 00:44:33.904, Speaker D: So that's all.
00:44:33.944 - 00:44:35.192, Speaker B: There's some transparency.
00:44:35.368 - 00:44:39.920, Speaker D: There's a, there's a global price feed where you can see all the prices from all the exchanges.
00:44:39.992 - 00:44:40.872, Speaker B: We don't really have that.
00:44:40.928 - 00:45:04.094, Speaker D: We don't really have. There's so many things that, that the crypto industry doesn't necessarily have, whether or not good or bad, we should have them. There's probably. You can line up on both sides of that argument, right. We're just not there. And again, the globalization, I think, is tricky. Do you have, like, a US only best x? And then what happens if there's dislocations between the US and Europe? Who can, whose fault and who's going to trade that dislocation? Because it's an arb.
00:45:04.094 - 00:45:09.374, Speaker D: And ideally, you would want folks doing that. So that way the global prices align.
00:45:09.494 - 00:45:13.904, Speaker B: But is there best x requirement or expectation for something like spot gold?
00:45:15.404 - 00:45:19.396, Speaker D: I don't, I don't think so. But I'm not going to say that I. That I truly know that I. Yeah.
00:45:19.420 - 00:45:41.068, Speaker B: Well, I just know that this rule that we're talking about is specifically an SEC rule, so it wouldn't apply to gold. But I'm not sure. I actually don't. You're right. I do not actually know if the CFTCSA put something up, but I honestly can't imagine that you could, because gold is traded at pawn shops, at gold dealers. I mean, Tiffany's is one of the biggest sellers of gold. Right? Like commodities don't, like, trade in sort of one market.
00:45:41.068 - 00:45:56.172, Speaker B: They can. You can mine gold anywhere on earth. You can farm corn on anywhere on earth. Right. So, like how those. And those. Most markets, I think, tend to be much more dislocated in terms of price geographically, simply because they're physical things in different parts of the world.
00:45:56.172 - 00:46:18.914, Speaker B: And while, you know, bitcoin is not physical in that sense, and it certainly moves more freely across borders, it is global in that way. So it'd be, like, hard pressed for me to tell you what, like the central most, the, like, the most, like, top of book, like, tightest bid ask spread in all of crypto is like. It's not. Probably changes a lot. It's really not clear. Then you have FX involved, too, so it gets straight, right?
00:46:18.954 - 00:46:28.066, Speaker D: And then you have the stablecoins. And do you link the books? Do you do a risk haircut on any of the stablecoins? It starts to get really nerdy.
00:46:28.170 - 00:46:58.798, Speaker B: And I'm going to go to this because I know you mentioned USDC is one of the coins that you guys have on the platform, but before that, I want to ask another. Well, what about things you talked a lot about what tradfi market structure and technologies and in general can bring to crypto markets. That's. I think obviously, it was a core value proposition for Ars X, and I know Forcibo Digital now, too. What about things that crypto can bring to tradfi? And one that I want to ask you about is the perpetual swap.
00:46:58.886 - 00:46:59.366, Speaker D: Oh, yeah.
00:46:59.430 - 00:47:20.934, Speaker B: I think this is a brilliant financial instrument. We don't have it in traditional markets. Do you have any view on why or if we might ever. This is one where it feels to me now it wasn't invented by crypto, but I think it was first implemented by Bitmex. So there's actually an academy. I looked into this one. There's an academic paper, invented it in the nineties, but I think Arthur Hayes is basically the first person to actually do it.
00:47:20.934 - 00:47:27.390, Speaker B: And now, of course, it's integral to crypto markets. Could we ever see that in tradfi markets?
00:47:27.462 - 00:48:13.310, Speaker D: Yeah, it's interesting. I think they're called perpetual futures on a lot of platforms. But you nailed it, they're swaps. It's a bilateral exchange of the funding amount between the buyer and the seller, and the platform is really just a tech provider between that funding that. The swap is the key part in the US. Now you're talking about the CFTC and the regulations around swap dealers or swap execution facilities, thefts and the reporting. And then the question really be it is, are the retail brokers that are facing the customers going to offer or can they offer or will they, would they be willing? Maybe it's a better question.
00:48:13.310 - 00:49:10.908, Speaker D: I can't say whether can't a swap to their customers, right? There's obviously different risks associated with swaps and there are listed cleared contracts. Even swaps can be cleared, but they don't have to be essentially cleared. And so you get all these little nuances that is probably, I'm going to guess I'm going to go out on a limb on that one and say is why most fcms and brokers are not offering swaps to their customers. Because there's very liquid swap markets today, interest rate swaps. And so you could get sophisticated traders that understand the risks and are willing to take the risks, probably access to swaps if you wanted. And I'm sure there's ways you can get access to them if that's really what you want as an individual investor. What crypto has done is really brought the retail traders into this concept of swaps with this perpetual, and from my purview, I would say it's because of the leverage.
00:49:10.908 - 00:50:09.564, Speaker D: So you get a similar asset that looks like the spot market doesn't expire, trades at a little bit of a basis depending on the structure of the product. And now you get some leverage. And then obviously depending on where you go on what platform, you can get extreme leverage. Now you can get the type of a different exposure that you want. I think what we've struggled with in the US is probably seeing the same amount of retail engagement in quote, unquote, futures markets as we see in kind of equity derivative markets. So, you know, why are single stock options and index options, index equity options so popular? And why aren't options on futures as popular? You know, and maybe it's the product, maybe it's the structure, you know, again, not a good question, not, not for today to solve. And I'm probably not the right person to answer that, but that's the phenomenon that we've seen and obviously huge amount of demand, huge amount of volume trading in those internationally.
00:50:09.564 - 00:50:30.988, Speaker D: So I think something has to give, right? Either we need to see those participants offer swaps to their retail somehow with venues like a CBO digital potentially offering that swap and being it probably centrally cleared for capital efficiencies and things like that, or it's got to be a different product.
00:50:31.076 - 00:50:31.462, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:50:31.548 - 00:50:55.586, Speaker D: Right. It's got to be structured a different way. And I think that's just, it's a challenge. You also have a futures market that's been sitting around for 50 plus years that there's a role, right. And there's commercials about. Around the role in terms of who's making money in the role. And so there's also now all of a sudden, if I can get exposure and I don't ever have to roll for me, if I'm a trader, it's probably cheaper, though.
00:50:55.586 - 00:51:33.424, Speaker D: I might pay more in premium maybe in terms of price difference, maybe, maybe not, I don't know. But everybody else that's charging commissions, fees along the way is going to lose out on that. So what does the real market look like? Is the fee higher? Is the premium higher? There's obviously there's a cannibalization potential there for anyone that's offering futures contracts. Obviously we have those same contracts buyer every one month, three months. So if someone wants to roll now, they don't have to. I lose that transaction totally revenue from my perspective as an exchange. And so there's some risk there.
00:51:33.424 - 00:51:50.524, Speaker D: And so I think all those different factors play at whether or not we will or won't. I think it's a really interesting product and I think it could be really interesting for the future of at least crypto in the US, whether or not it gets applied to other assets.
00:51:51.464 - 00:52:18.456, Speaker B: As TBD, I always wonder what innovations crypto will seep from. Crypto will seep into traditional market structure. Another one is obviously the stablecoin. And I want to ask about, because you said you have USDC on the platform, I assume that means I can trade the other four like non stable crypto assets against USDC markets if I want. Or I guess it doesn't really matter. It's an equivalent. Can I do deposits and withdrawals at CBO digital in USDC stablecoin?
00:52:18.520 - 00:52:26.864, Speaker D: You can bring it and you can buy other coins with it or you can sell coins for it. But we don't integrate the books. They're still separate. Right.
00:52:26.904 - 00:52:28.280, Speaker B: Think of it as its own coin, basically.
00:52:28.312 - 00:52:28.960, Speaker D: So its own.
00:52:29.072 - 00:52:49.216, Speaker B: But you can send it out to me like, I could operate solely on the stable coin. I don't have to do wires in and out and stuff because this was one of the things I remember early on at fidelity when I led blockchain research there. We thought about, well, wow, these networks. In many ways, even bitcoin, which is comparatively slow compared to some other blockchains, is almost lightning speed compared to Tradfi.
00:52:49.280 - 00:52:50.112, Speaker D: Compared to dollars.
00:52:50.208 - 00:53:12.648, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Or equity settlement. Any of the existing, not the trading. Trading in tradfi is quite fast. But the settlement. Yeah, but man, without, and this is like 2016, and tether was probably like 10 million in the supply. Now it's 100 billion and there's probably 140 billion total us dollar denominated stablecoin supply today.
00:53:12.648 - 00:53:38.084, Speaker B: But it was so early and we were saying without the dollar lag, we can't really offer robust on chain folk. I mean, you can wire us cash and we can sell you bitcoin with dollars, but the bitcoin will arrive or be sent almost immediately, and the dollars will take more time to arrive or be sent. Do you see a wide adoption eventually? Isn't a public blockchain just a much better rail for dollars than other technologies?
00:53:38.204 - 00:54:00.436, Speaker D: Yeah, I think ultimately end state, something like that. Yes. Whether it's a stablecoin or what we call stable coins today, or something different, tokenized money market fund or tokenized deposits, central bank digital currency, I don't know on that one. And the opinions vary significantly as you talk about each of those.
00:54:00.500 - 00:54:01.140, Speaker B: They do, yeah.
00:54:01.212 - 00:54:37.380, Speaker D: Right. But I think that the challenge today is stablecoins aren't regulated the way some of the other collateral vehicles are in traditional finance. And so I think there's potential for additional risks. I'm not saying there is, but I think from a risk management perspective, you look at that and say, oh, there's additional risk there. And so I think that's probably why maybe the adoption hasn't been as fast. I think internationally it's different because there's, the dollar system in the US is so strong. Dollar is still really what I'll call KiNg when it comes to settlement, potentially even globally.
00:54:37.380 - 00:55:04.196, Speaker D: When you bring on something that isn't dollar denominated, like USDT, you've seen wide adoption, but that's also because it's traversing jurisdictions, currencies. And so there isn't necessarily the same widespread adoption of another currency as there is maybe the dollar globally. You know, that's maybe why we've seen it work so well internationally. Tokenization, which is much bigger, the newest, hottest topic, right?
00:55:04.220 - 00:55:06.340, Speaker B: The last six months, everything old is new again, right?
00:55:06.372 - 00:55:17.788, Speaker D: Exactly. It was hot a couple years ago, if I remember. But that, to me, you talk about what crypto can bring to traditional finances. Maybe not like the coins themselves. Maybe, maybe not. I don't know. That's really interesting.
00:55:17.788 - 00:56:03.464, Speaker D: It's the technology, right? How can we leverage DLT blockchain technology in the way our system works today to make it better? Right? So a lot of people talk about atomic settlement. Is there a use case for it depending on the asset? Sure. Not every asset I don't think I'll see in my lifetime single stock equity settling atomically, but maybe, and if we do, I think the cost of those equities from a spread perspective that you know, that you get when you, when you cross it will be bigger because market makers lose a little bit of efficiency if you make them, them deal with their capital atomically. But there's probably some medium between where we're at. We're going from t two to t one. Now. Does it get better than t one? Maybe this technology can help.
00:56:03.464 - 00:56:49.590, Speaker D: Tokenized fiat or collateral, I think is really interesting in the sense of how do we make it less expensive and remove the friction from the ecosystem for the purpose of settling transactions. Right. It doesn't have to be trading crypto or trading equity. It's just transactions. Like, you're going to give me this and I'm going to give you that, and that is going to be dollars. But instead of me sending an AcH or a wire handing you dollars, like, am I giving you some token that's in lieu of it, whether it's a central bank currency or a token that represents something that's held in some transfer agent or whatever, you know, there's probably a lot of different ways that can go. I think that's likely the evolution we'll see in the future.
00:56:49.662 - 00:56:57.518, Speaker B: You could see that that seems plausible with regulation or clarity around stablecoin safety, etcetera.
00:56:57.566 - 00:57:15.850, Speaker D: Regulation on stable coins could really push stable coins really to the forefront of that. If we see lack of that, then I could see tokenized money market funds or tokenized ABS's or something like that, which is like, like very trusted, has a strong regulatory framework around it, could actually leapfrog stable coins.
00:57:15.922 - 00:57:40.274, Speaker B: All right, so you run a centralized exchange with a bunch of great features, both from crypto and from the long history of traditional exchange operation, as we've discussed. What do you think about Defi? Aren't you the exact business that the crypto puritans think should be disintermediated itself. Will it ever happen?
00:57:40.774 - 00:57:48.678, Speaker D: Yeah. So the first part, yes, I think I am the exact business, or running a business. That's the exact reason why maybe bitcoin may be formed in the first place.
00:57:48.686 - 00:58:19.524, Speaker B: Talk about ccps and trusted intermediaries for settlement. Nick Zabo says that trusted intermediaries are security holes. There's a core ethos of attempting to remove as many trusted intermediaries as possible. Do you think trading, though, obviously, DeFi is sort of its own ecosystem and has grown quite large, but like in a box kind of. You haven't seen the principles or technology really behind Defi. The applications seep their way into tradfi. Do you think we will?
00:58:20.144 - 00:58:55.892, Speaker D: I think it depends on the asset, and I think, yes, we will. I don't think it's should be all or none. I think there are definitely probably lots of pockets of quote unquote finance that DeFi probably can do really great things in, and I think we probably will see that over time. Do I think that? Are you single stock equities again, as an example? I think single stock equities are going to trade in a Defi like manner in the future. I would probably take the other side of that. I might be wrong, and that'd be really interesting. I just think about all the things in line that have to be solved for that to actually work in what the costs are.
00:58:55.892 - 00:59:15.464, Speaker D: Not everything gets better. If you change something, there could be a cost. You add all that up. I'm not sure I see it. But to answer, I'm not against Defi. And from my perspective, obviously, I've run a centralized exchange and clearinghouse, so maybe I should be against DeFi. I think the technology is really interesting, and I think what it can solve is really interesting.
00:59:15.464 - 00:59:37.060, Speaker D: It's just, I don't want to boil the ocean with it. I just want to say, okay, maybe over here it works really great. Let's figure out how to do that in a trusted, transparent manner with oversight. Maybe that adds a lot of value to the participants, maybe with not a ton of friction, and that could be really interesting. Those are the types of evolution I think we'll see over time.
00:59:37.172 - 01:00:10.540, Speaker B: It sounds like Cibo Digital is well positioned in between traditional investors and exchange users and cryptocurrency networks and assets. It makes sense. You think about it more as a bridge. Maybe there are pieces from each, but it wouldn't make sense if you went full deFi. You convert CBO digital into an automated market maker like Uniswap, then you probably lose a lot of your traditional users because you're building it for them primarily to give them access to this innovative asset class. Makes a lot of sense to me. But I do wonder that, too.
01:00:10.540 - 01:00:41.658, Speaker B: By the way, I don't see any clamoring in traditional finance, any part of it, to have defi come into tradfi, quote, unquote. I see demand for on chain pulling in traditional assets, like real world assets we talked about. There's plenty of that. I don't see anyone that's waking up saying, oh, my gosh, I would like that is in traditional trading or equities or any part, really. Although I think FX would be very interesting on chain. I think that actually, because it's global, it's not really regulated in that way.
01:00:41.706 - 01:00:42.866, Speaker D: We haven't talked about FX.
01:00:43.010 - 01:01:03.566, Speaker B: Well, let me ask you that one, then, because I've always thought this was a great candidate for something like a tokenized, decentralized market, because FX is basically not regulated, and it can't really be because it's, by definition, cross jurisdictional. I'm sure there are rules about how different entity types, like a broker dealer or a custodian or something handles FX. That's different. But the trading of it is inherently international, right?
01:01:03.590 - 01:01:03.886, Speaker D: Yep.
01:01:03.950 - 01:01:27.440, Speaker B: There's no international market regulator, really. There are standards and whatnot. But, like, does that seem like something where you talk about tokenized fiat? Like, doesn't this seem like a lot of it swaps? I mean, and obviously there's other markets, but, like, it seems like this thing could move, would make a lot of sense on chain in some ways, because, like, FX, it's, you know, public blockchains are global decentralized, et cetera.
01:01:27.552 - 01:01:48.444, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I think that definitely very interesting things in the FX base. It would be interesting to see if, like, as an industry, we kind of look at FX. I know sometimes we get focused on certain parts of the, you know, the broader market and say, okay, let's. Let's do bonds, or, oh, let's do collateral, let's do real estate, or let's do. You know, we haven't really looked at FX.
01:01:49.224 - 01:01:59.864, Speaker B: I haven't really ever heard of anyone focusing on it. But it does seem to make sense to me in some ways. And especially, again, because FX is cross jurisdictional.
01:02:00.284 - 01:02:25.884, Speaker D: It's very similar to crypto in that sense, but also similar in market structure in the sense that you have a lot of. There's no best x if we compare it to equities. There's over the counter trading, no consolidated tape. That tells you everything. It's all a lot of OTC. There is obviously some ECN's and disclosure. Cibo operates CBO FX, which is in the FX business.
01:02:25.884 - 01:02:36.480, Speaker D: So yeah, there's a lot of, I don't know, overlap, similarities, whatever, with FX and crypto. And that's why I think you've seen a lot of FX players.
01:02:36.592 - 01:02:37.048, Speaker B: That's true.
01:02:37.096 - 01:02:42.592, Speaker D: Get into crypto early, earlier than a lot of the other traditional players, because there's so much similarity there.
01:02:42.648 - 01:03:12.932, Speaker B: FX commodities types love crypto. For this reason, I think it makes a lot of sense. Before we wrap, Jon, what is the, your bullish view on what are you guys looking forward to at CBO Digital and what makes you want to work? I mean, you've been in the equity markets, equity derivatives markets. You built exchanges, you worked on an international exchange. You set out of Bermuda, which we won't even talk about, but I love Bermuda, but people don't realize. Incredible financial leader, Bermuda, huge in the insurance world. But you've been working on this for a while.
01:03:12.932 - 01:03:28.468, Speaker B: You now lead Cibo digital. So also not just what is CBO digital looking forward to and thinking about why are you guys, why did you acquire RSX? Why are you building all this? What is your bullish view of this market? And also what is your bullish view on these assets?
01:03:28.596 - 01:04:15.500, Speaker D: Yeah, so from a CBO digital perspective, I think it's the continued evolution of the ecosystem. Spot bitcoin ETF approval was, I think, fantastic. Obviously, we want to see more continuation there and more development. Anything we can do or working with partners that can do, that can continue to bring more of the buy side and the traditional folks sell side, prime brokers, traditional custodians into the ecosystem, I think is going to be over net positive. That's really where we see the opportunity. Also, derivatives, we didn't touch a ton about derivatives, but we're very excited about derivatives. We just launched futures in January, so we have futures on bitcoin and ETH, and we'll continue to build out not only that ecosystem as we onboard participants, but also new products.
01:04:15.500 - 01:05:08.766, Speaker D: So we talk about being kind of crypto native and tradfi at that intersection. So that's really how we think about our product development as well. And that's not just like, what order type are we gonna bring, but it's more of like, what products can we list and trade and how can we really drive, you know, us innovation in kind of this crypto derivatives world. So, you know, we're very focused there as well. I'm very excited about kind of what that opportunity looks like and tokenization, I think on that, what's called the third leg, you have the spot market, the derivative market, maybe tokenization. Seeing how I think we really expand collateral for the purposes of just making it more seamless and removing friction from the value chain for our participants, I think we're really focused there as well. Personally, I hold bitcoin disclosure, so obviously the halving and seeing the price go up is, you know, I'm not going to frown at that.
01:05:08.950 - 01:05:13.478, Speaker B: Up a lot. Up even like just from 30 days ago, up almost 30%. That's crazy.
01:05:13.526 - 01:05:17.030, Speaker D: I mean, we've seen a massive run. I think the low was like 17.
01:05:17.182 - 01:05:21.390, Speaker B: Or 16,605, I think is what I called it, Ash.
01:05:21.502 - 01:05:34.726, Speaker D: So quite a big rally, you know, how much more do we have? I mean, hey, I'd love, I mean, I'd love to see it higher than the last high. I'm not going to make a prediction because I'm not in that space, but whoever is predicting the highest number, I like.
01:05:34.790 - 01:05:35.414, Speaker B: You're fine with that?
01:05:35.454 - 01:05:56.134, Speaker D: I'm like, hey, yeah, that'd be great. You want it to go to a million, so do I. Who that holds it doesn't. Right. Just from that perspective, I think why I'm obviously would be bullish on the price because I just. We have the halving. We saw the bitcoin ETF and so I think that just generates participation, broader participation.
01:05:56.134 - 01:06:06.322, Speaker D: Obviously the halving might have different types of economic input to the price, but general awareness, people migrating, or I call.
01:06:06.338 - 01:06:20.354, Speaker B: It a quadrennial marketing event. Yeah, I think it's, it shows bitcoin's transparent, credibly neutral, you know, supply schedule, basically, which is pretty unique.
