00:00:00.320 - 00:00:34.709, Speaker A: Likely. I actually think it's inevitable that Bitcoin eventually becomes the dominant global currency used by basically everyone, unless they're really under the thumb of a geographic tyrant in some small jurisdiction or something like that. So I think that's probably inevitable. It's not necessary for bitcoin to deliver 80 or 90% of the good that it can deliver for humanity. It's not required for it to supplant the dollar. It still provides this check on tyranny. It provides this exit.
00:00:34.709 - 00:00:58.845, Speaker A: It will, you know, all the things we kind of hypothesize about seem to already be starting to some degree just because people can exit their local currency for Bitcoin, should they so choose. And that will only become more and more attractive as Bitcoin stabilizes and just becomes more accepted and just feels safer.
