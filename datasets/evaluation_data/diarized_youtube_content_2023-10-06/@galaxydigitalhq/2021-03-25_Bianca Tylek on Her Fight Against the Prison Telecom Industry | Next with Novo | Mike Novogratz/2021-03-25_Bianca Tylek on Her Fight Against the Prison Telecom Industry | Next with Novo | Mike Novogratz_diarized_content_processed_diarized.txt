00:00:00.480 - 00:00:23.406, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. I'm Mike Novogratz, and this is next with Novo. Guys, welcome to next with Novo. This episode is special. I've got Bianca Tylek. She is a feisty fighter who wants to dismantle profiteering in prisons, who wants to take money out of the prison system, this injustice system we have. I've known her for a few years.
00:00:23.406 - 00:00:36.676, Speaker A: I'm more impressed every month. I see her as she grows her strength, her tenacity. She'll stand up to anybody. If you think about David and Goliath, you gotta meet Bianca. So, Bianca, tell us a little bit about your story. Why are you so angry?
00:00:36.860 - 00:01:04.000, Speaker B: I'm not actually angry, although I am angry about a lot of things that are going on in our society. So, you know, at worthrises, we work specifically to dismantle the prison industry. The industry is an $80 billion industry that is working every single day to extract as many resources as possible possible out of communities that are impacted by incarceration, which are disproportionately black and brown. And I can tell you where that anger started for me.
00:01:04.112 - 00:01:04.768, Speaker A: Please.
00:01:04.936 - 00:01:37.856, Speaker B: My story right back when I was a young person, I was getting caught up in a lot of things, making a lot of decisions that my parents were not super pleased with. Found myself in the juvenile system. I had to stand in front of a court a few times, right? But things sort of escalated pretty quickly. And what I was going to get to around sort of when I got angry, really angry. I think the first time, it was when I was 15, my boyfriend was murdered. And that's a lot. That's a lot.
00:01:37.856 - 00:02:06.898, Speaker B: It's a lot for a young person, right, to. Yeah. To sit through. And I remember that moment and that time and that suffering. And what happened that week was there was an article written in our local paper, and the article was about his murder and who he was and all these things. And when I first started reading it, the headline was something to the effect of shrine erected for slain man. And I was like, okay, well, this is interesting.
00:02:06.898 - 00:02:29.914, Speaker B: I start reading, and the last line of the article read, at least he died in a pool of his favorite color. Yeah, I was angry. Like, I was 15, and I was angry, and I didn't know what to do or what to say. I didn't know why. I just knew there was something wrong that, like, our lives weren't somebody else's creative writing project.
00:02:31.254 - 00:02:35.566, Speaker A: And so how did you harness that? You went to college, you went to law school.
00:02:35.710 - 00:03:12.096, Speaker B: The thing that I really benefited from is always doing really well. In school. And so, you know, coming out of that, I still managed to kind of get myself together in a really important and powerful way. And I ended up going to Columbia for undergrad. And I will say that transition was also hard. I remember friends from my community coming to visit me at Columbia, and that being a real culture clash, some real moments of tense conversations. I mean, to the extent that, like, there were actually classmates of mine at Columbia, like, I didn't, like, talk to people.
00:03:12.096 - 00:03:39.008, Speaker B: People didn't talk to me, actually, I should say, because they were scared of me. They were scared of what I brought to campus. And that was frustrating. It was a thing I had to sort of figure out, like, how do I navigate this world and, you know, my community, where I come from and help them understand each other? And so that was, you know, interesting. But through college, you know, ended up coming out and, strangely, going to finance.
00:03:39.136 - 00:03:56.444, Speaker A: Let me flip back before we go forward with the transition of finance. You know, I'm still thinking, you're 15 years old, and your boyfriend gets murdered, and it's just trauma. Like, it's just trauma. You're in the traumatic. How did you process? How did you get through that? Or when did you get through that?
00:03:57.184 - 00:04:31.158, Speaker B: I don't know that you ever get through. Right to this day, I have a three by four foot painting on my wall in my living room. Right. The biggest piece of art I have in my house is about his murder. And it's been 17, 1819 years since then. So I don't think there's a moment you forget a tragedy like that. I still think it's a thing I think about very often.
00:04:31.158 - 00:05:06.722, Speaker B: And when I say very often, I would say, you know, daily, every other day, like, it's. It's a very regular thing. And so I will say this about what it was like when I was young. I actually didn't tell anybody, like, in some of my worlds for a long time, I lived a very strange life in terms of a dichotomy, because I went to this, I got kicked out of school, so I went to this private high school. And so I had, like, my community back home, and then I had this school. It was kind of like, I felt like for the most part, I was, like, going to work every day. I went to work from, like, seven to, like, three, and then I went and, like, went back to my community, my home.
00:05:06.722 - 00:05:35.604, Speaker B: And so I just didn't tell anybody for a really long time. And my reality, I didn't tell my best friend in, like, high school anything. I just felt like, I needed to be comfortable telling the story without fault, fully breaking down. And that building that type of defense mechanism builds a different kind of strength. You know, people ask me sometimes about light bulb moments. I'm like, there's no light bulb moments. You just don't have this moment where you're like, it's about the support mechanisms for the things that you're good at.
00:05:35.604 - 00:05:54.104, Speaker B: Right. And the reality is, what I remembered about both his death, like, and him and his legacy is that he really wanted me to be successful. And I think it was with that that I think I took that energy, you know, when he passed, and I was like, I'm gonna win.
00:05:54.644 - 00:06:10.704, Speaker A: When did you decide, you know? And is it for part of that legacy of, like, frickin I'm gonna fix something? Like, what was that moment where you decided, I'm going and spend my life in trying to dismantle this shit system that we have called criminal justice?
00:06:12.464 - 00:06:31.432, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, I would say so. It's interesting, actually. Every time I applied to an institution, a fellowship, anything, like, including college, I always talked about that. That was the leading. It was always the essay, right. Whenever there was a personal statement, there was something that you had to kind of, like, tell what you're gonna do in the future.
00:06:31.432 - 00:07:06.080, Speaker B: It was always like, I want to work with the community around criminal justice, like, around the people that other people have condemned. Right. That has always been for one reason or another, like, the space in which I felt most comfortable. And so I actually went into Columbia with that. And I remember because I didn't let my parents see my personal statement, my essay, because I felt like they were going to have feelings about it. And my dad read it before he put it in the mail. And he comes back to me and he says, I don't know if you're gonna get in with that.
00:07:06.080 - 00:07:33.044, Speaker B: And I was like, I'm gonna do this my way. Like, that's the only way I know how, is I'm gonna get in with what is in my soul and my spirit, in my being. And if I don't, that's okay, because we have to be true to who we are. And that was. And then when I went in, you know, I think I was just constantly feeling out my path, and I was able to, like, really transition into criminal justice for time after law school, as you know. But that was.
00:07:33.084 - 00:07:34.636, Speaker A: So you did Wall street? How long? Two years.
00:07:34.700 - 00:07:35.204, Speaker B: Four years.
00:07:35.244 - 00:07:36.916, Speaker A: Four years, yeah. Where'd you work?
00:07:37.060 - 00:07:54.108, Speaker B: I was. So I actually started as an intern in undergrad at Goldman Sachs for a few years. And then I went to Morgan Stanley, and I was at Morgan Stanley full time for two years after college, and then went to Citigroup and spent two years at city.
00:07:54.156 - 00:07:56.510, Speaker A: Wow. So you were a real gold. I mean, Wall street.
00:07:56.652 - 00:08:03.482, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. All the big banks, like, really took that time and. Yeah. Learned what I learned.
00:08:03.578 - 00:08:08.690, Speaker A: So you graduate from law school. When did you start worth rises? Right away.
00:08:08.882 - 00:08:48.694, Speaker B: Almost right away. So I actually, I took one more year between Wall street and law school, and then I went to law school in 2013. That was. And spent three years in law school, obviously. And it was at that time that I came out, and I was like, no, I'm ready to do the thing I really want to do. And so when I came out, I started first in a fellowship at an organization, and that just wasn't a good fit for me, and it wasn't exactly what I wanted to do. And then, most importantly, though, I had just started to identify a gap and started to identify a place where I could really uniquely support the movement.
00:08:51.314 - 00:09:09.524, Speaker A: Your basic mission is to get money out of the jail system. Right. Profiteering in prisons, a to me, it's, like, just immoral and unethical. Like, no one should profit from the caging of people. I believe that in my soul. So you figured out this was a gap. How did you do that?
00:09:09.904 - 00:10:03.338, Speaker B: I started talking to people I had always been interested in, maybe partially from my working past or whatever, about the big business of prisons. Like, people who. This inequity, I think most of my life was also shaped around these visions of inequity, right? Seeing folks who really didn't have. With folks who had a lot, and just watching these dichotomies in life as a mixed race person, there's a dichotomy you have in your life of, this is this one culture, and there's this other culture. So it was like, there's so, like, when I was in high school, right, like, going to this private school that, you know, where folks had money and had wealth and then the, like, few of us who were not, per se, the scholarship kids. But there was literally, like, I remember my senior year, we had a class trip to Florida. Three students didn't go in the entire class.
00:10:03.338 - 00:10:35.236, Speaker B: All three of them were students of color, two black girls and myself. And all the other students went because we couldn't afford to go. So I saw this sort of throughout my life, this inequity, and it just always interested me. And so coming off of Wall street in all those years, I kind of saw how money was made. And I would talk to people in the criminal justice world about the exploitation, and everybody would sort of kind of shrug their shoulders, toss their hands up, and say, well, what are you gonna do about capitalism?
00:10:35.300 - 00:10:55.626, Speaker A: So let's help the audience understand a little bit about where money shows up in prisons. Right? We hear about private prisons. There's not that many private prisons, but there's tons of ways people profit off of the caging business. So take us through from the highest to the lowest and just in kind of fast order. What pisses you off?
00:10:55.770 - 00:10:56.426, Speaker B: I'll give you some examples.
00:10:56.450 - 00:10:58.114, Speaker A: How many things? Yeah, give me some examples.
00:10:58.194 - 00:11:38.016, Speaker B: Yeah. So, as you said, there's private prisons. Everybody likes to talk about the private prisons. They make up 8% of all beds in the correctional system, a lot more in the immigration system, you know, we should acknowledge over nearly 80%, but in the criminal system, about 8%. So where does profiteering show up otherwise? In public, publicly run prisons and jails, nearly everything has been externally contracted to private corporations, from laundry services to maintenance to food and commissary to telecom. You sort of name it, it's been outsourced. I mean, the architecture and construction firm that builds prisons and jails, right, is making money off of this.
00:11:38.016 - 00:12:01.352, Speaker B: And it's not. Some will say, oh, it's a service provider, this, that, and the other. Who's going to do it? And they kind of toss their hands up. Not true. They actually. Prison construction companies in particular, they will give campaign financing dollars to sheriffs who want to build new jails. So this is very intentional exposure and cooperation with the correctional system.
00:12:01.352 - 00:12:09.722, Speaker B: But telecom is another example, right? You have niche prison telecom corporations that charge people as much as $1 a minute to be on the phone.
00:12:09.778 - 00:12:31.734, Speaker A: That's insane. I remember when I went to college, it was a long time ago, 1983. My parents lived in Germany. And if you called long distance back then, it was about a dollar a minute, and you'd call, and after two minutes, you had to hang up the phone, stop the phone. You're killing us. And so the stress around phone calls when it was a dollar a minute was bizarre. Now it's free to call everywhere.
00:12:31.734 - 00:12:36.114, Speaker A: But in prisons, there's still places to charge a dollar a minute. Like, how in the hell does that happen?
00:12:36.854 - 00:13:07.226, Speaker B: It's contracting. Right? Not only are so there's two main things that these, like, companies, these niche companies created how they, like, really ate out this market, because actually it used to be done by the regular companies at and T and Verizon and all them. They all left when these companies came in and they did two things. One, they convinced everybody we needed surveillance of phone calls, so they introduced all these surveillance technologies. And then secondly, they offered to pay the prisons in jails. That was like the big part. They said, hey, hold on, hold on, hold on.
00:13:07.226 - 00:13:23.850, Speaker B: If you let us do this, we'll share our revenues, our profits with you. So these aren't competitive government contracts. Like, this isn't a competitive procurement process. It's a profit sharing agreement between the government and private corporation to exploit people.
00:13:23.922 - 00:13:33.532, Speaker A: All right, so let's agree. Me and you fundamentally agree there should be no phone exploitation in. And I know New York state is it. New York state passed New York City. New York City passed a law free.
00:13:33.588 - 00:13:45.644, Speaker B: We just got our third. Mike, nice. Yeah. So New York City is now fully free in jails. San Francisco also. And as of yesterday, San Diego became the third city to make phone calls.
00:13:45.684 - 00:13:54.580, Speaker A: So only three cities in America make phone calls free from prison, which that's bizarre. Cause phone calls are free everywhere else. Who are the worst offenders? What cities?
00:13:54.692 - 00:14:29.024, Speaker B: Hard to say. I would say all over the place. But Michigan is particularly bad in counties. Arkansas, Alabama. The thing that people should know, right, is that the actual most exploitation, the worst rates charged are in jails. Are in county jails. And I know you've had folks on your show before talking about bail, right? Like who's sitting in a county jail, people who are awaiting trial, people who are not yet convicted, people who don't have money to bail out, but instead we're gonna charge them $15 for a phone call, but they can't afford $150 to get out of prison.
00:14:29.334 - 00:14:50.574, Speaker A: Yeah. Insanity. Yeah. It's interesting that, you know, Bryan Stevenson always talks about proximity. Most middle class to wealthy people have zero proximity to the criminal justice system. I shouldn't say middle class. Most wealthy people have zero proximity to it.
00:14:50.574 - 00:15:27.078, Speaker A: You know, at least where I grew up in the middle class, we had very little proximity to it. And so you just don't understand in the first few times you're exposed. You're like, oh, shit, what the heck? You know? And it really does change. There's something we have to do in our country to get people proximity. If it's in media, movies and trips, schools should, like. Somehow people have to understand how horrific the system is, and they don't. In New York City, right, we've got the richest city in the world, and there are horrific pockets of, you know, criminal injustice.
00:15:27.078 - 00:15:35.350, Speaker A: And most people naively not because they're bad people, just have no exposure 100%.
00:15:35.542 - 00:15:43.382, Speaker B: And it's also have no understanding of the system. Like, I tell people all the time, it's crazy that our prisons are so opaque. Like, you can't just walk into one.
00:15:43.438 - 00:15:43.958, Speaker A: No, you can't.
00:15:44.006 - 00:15:52.354, Speaker B: Even our elected officials sometimes can't walk into one. So it's like, what are you keeping so secret and so hidden and so, you know, away from the rest of us?
00:15:52.394 - 00:15:57.226, Speaker A: I mean, I hit on this topic. It's bizarrely difficult to get in. Bizarrely difficult.
00:15:57.250 - 00:15:58.218, Speaker B: We went in together.
00:15:58.306 - 00:15:58.738, Speaker A: Yes.
00:15:58.826 - 00:16:25.132, Speaker B: And even that, you know, actually, we went through some hurdles that time. We were trying to organize that. Yeah, that trip, because we wanted people to have that proximity. Exactly what you're talking about. And it was made incredibly difficult. And I think the one thing that I'll share that people may not know about me is that I actually, during law school, wanted that proximity in a really important way. And so I actually worked for three different departments of correction.
00:16:25.228 - 00:16:26.104, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:16:29.124 - 00:17:00.674, Speaker B: So I have exciting. A really exciting campaign that we are going to be launching soon and that we're. I'm just so honored to be able to lead this campaign. I was just invited to join the core team of the abolished slavery national network. It's a network that was built in the last year of organizers and folks who have been leading on the fight to end the exception in the 13th amendment that allows for slavery as punishment for a crime.
00:17:02.374 - 00:17:17.900, Speaker A: Stop right there. Let's stop right there and let's rewind. So explain that we have an amendment. We have a section in the 13th amendment that allows for slavery to be punishment for a crime. That that exists in 2021 is just incomprehensible.
00:17:17.972 - 00:17:28.084, Speaker B: It's completely incomprehensible. In fact, I was talking to my dad last night. Cause we did a show last night, and he learned that yesterday, and he's got me as a daughter.
00:17:28.124 - 00:17:32.908, Speaker A: And, you know, so is that going down to the prisons in Louisiana and you're working on the chain gang? I mean, is this what we're talking about?
00:17:32.956 - 00:18:04.442, Speaker B: I mean, we're talking about people picking cotton in 2021 for free and, like, under force of, like, under threat of, like, solitary confinement. Like, we are talking about states building, like, entire wealth off of incarcerated labor. This is, like, what people don't know about this system. This is why you can't walk into angle. You can't walk into these facilities, because if you do, you'd see this. And, you know, it's why journalists are, like, essentially just camping out next to prison so that they can see the trucks that are going in and out.
00:18:04.528 - 00:18:10.434, Speaker A: And so campaign to basically end free labor in prisons.
00:18:10.934 - 00:18:52.984, Speaker B: Right? So this campaign. So I joined, as I mentioned, ASNN as invited to be the lead organizer for the federal campaign. What's exciting about this network is that it is comprised of organizers who have won this already now in a few states. So not only is this in the US Constitution, but because of the way in which the US Constitution and laws are ratified from the federal system to the state system, this is also in every state constitution. Okay. And so in the last three years, there's been an incredible swell of work happening to change these state constitutions. And three states have won in the last three years.
00:18:52.984 - 00:19:03.210, Speaker B: Colorado, Nebraska, and Utah have all eliminated this exception from their state constitutions. And what's so exciting about that is that those are two red states and a purple state.
00:19:03.312 - 00:19:04.334, Speaker A: Yeah, that's awesome.
00:19:04.374 - 00:19:05.670, Speaker B: Those are republican legislatures.
00:19:05.702 - 00:19:25.074, Speaker A: So what people need to know, like, at least the listeners should know, is that, you know, the criminal justice system isn't monolithic. It is a patchwork of lots of grassroots organizations. There's some big organizations, but there are a ton of faith based groups, grassroots groups, local organizing groups that together collaborate, at times collaborate and sometimes compete.
00:19:25.654 - 00:19:27.606, Speaker B: There's some messiness sometimes to try to.
00:19:27.630 - 00:19:33.234, Speaker A: Push the ball up the hill and over the hill. And it's awesome to hear that you're having some success.
00:19:33.354 - 00:19:49.298, Speaker B: I think it's an exciting campaign. And I would just say it's the big thing for, you know, in the federal space will be to literally introduce. I mean, I think I would just say, every time I've been saying this in the last, like, week, it feels so audacious. But to say that we're gonna introduce the 28th Amendment to the Constitution, I'm.
00:19:49.306 - 00:20:12.024, Speaker A: Gonna get a 28th logo here. If we had Merrick Garland right there and Joe Biden, number one. Number two, in reverse order, who both are, you know, Garland's at least decentralist. You know, Biden is center left. Would you say? What would you say to him?
00:20:12.804 - 00:20:46.582, Speaker B: It's a great question. I. You know, we've been asking in our space, we need to 100% uproot out, completely shut down the industry and economy that has been built around incarcerating people. We need to figure out a way. And what we're driving for is to literally shut down this industry and shift in economy so that jobs are not dependent on people being in prison. I read an article today, it was about food, and there was this. It's a New York times op ed.
00:20:46.582 - 00:20:50.222, Speaker B: And it was, oh, the food in prisons is terrible. It was talking about how.
00:20:50.278 - 00:20:51.970, Speaker A: Yes. Yeah. Harvard. Right.
00:20:52.042 - 00:21:20.012, Speaker B: Okay, so. But listen, there was a commentary in there about farming and how people inside are doing farming so that they can provide better food for folks in the facility. Then there was a comment by some. It seemed like maybe a trade association or something, like, representing farmers. And they were like, oh. Because of COVID institutional procurement around schools and, like. And other things of that sort of has gone down for farmers.
00:21:20.012 - 00:21:34.372, Speaker B: And so they're, like. They're looking to correctional institutions to, like, save the day. And I was like, this is what's wrong with reform. Like, the notion that we're gonna save farmers. We're gonna save farmers because correctional institutions don't go down. What?
00:21:34.428 - 00:21:52.334, Speaker A: Why is it so goddamn hard? Like, it's amazing how hard it is to change these rigid systems. Like, I think if you polled America, certainly the majority would say, okay, we should change this. And maybe that wasn't always the case, but I think certainly, post George Floyd, it's become the case. But change happens so goddamn slow.
00:21:54.074 - 00:22:16.402, Speaker B: It's really hard. I mean, like, I would say on the telecom issue, like, really simple. We actually polled, and we found that in every single jurisdict, like, every. No matter what the demographics were, we had over 50% support from the public to make phone calls free. And yet it's like, we go into every state capitol and have to battle out this fight, and it's sheriff's fight, and it's, you know, it's all of this.
00:22:16.418 - 00:22:18.298, Speaker A: And so vested interest just digging in.
00:22:18.386 - 00:22:38.106, Speaker B: Yeah. It's the vested interest there. And so that's our job. Like, at worthrises, we are one piece of the puzzle. Right. And our piece is we want to remove that vested financial interest. You know, when I talk about the work we do, and not just, like, the work we do, but the issue that we're trying to solve, the issue.
00:22:38.130 - 00:22:40.042, Speaker A: Is much bigger than the work. It's a gigantic issue.
00:22:40.098 - 00:22:48.984, Speaker B: Exactly. When we talk about this issue, I tell you, most people's brains just hurt by the time they're done with the conversation. Right. It's just like. Jesus. Like what?
00:22:49.364 - 00:22:52.716, Speaker A: Yeah, Cheetos. Like, how much do Cheetos cost in a normal prison?
00:22:52.860 - 00:22:55.892, Speaker B: Oh, I mean, they could be $3. They could be $8. Think about that.
00:22:55.948 - 00:22:59.140, Speaker A: $3 for a goddamn pack of Cheetos. Yeah. They're not even good for you.
00:22:59.212 - 00:23:06.452, Speaker B: Not even that. I was talking to somebody on death row in Arkansas who said that a bag of Skittles was dollar eight. A bag of Skittles?
00:23:06.508 - 00:23:16.618, Speaker A: Yeah. We're taking the poorest people they don't have. They're not making any money. So it's their families who have no money that are giving them money so they can spend it at the commissary, where they're selling them shit at widely overpriced.
00:23:16.746 - 00:23:20.810, Speaker B: And that's gonna make them sick? That's gonna. Right. Destroy their health.
00:23:20.842 - 00:23:26.774, Speaker A: I know I'm maybe as angry as you are. How do you stay joyful?
00:23:27.074 - 00:23:28.602, Speaker B: I know, because you think I'm angry.
00:23:28.658 - 00:23:46.164, Speaker A: I teased you about being angry, but you're a pretty joyful person. You're smiling. You're giggling like, how do you lean, even for a moment, this brutal battle you're in with vested interests that are hard to move. How do you stay positive? How do you stay joyful? How do you balance your life?
00:23:46.504 - 00:24:47.844, Speaker B: You talk to people who are inside. You talk to families, and you find hope. Where they find hope, I would tell you, I think the most incredible, you know, resourceful, resilient people that I know are serving time. Right. I was just filming something else, and I got a phone call from death row in Arkansas, and the producer, like, walked out. She comes back, and after I got off the phone, I was like, oh, are you cold? She looked uncomfortable, and she was like, I am, but I'm in a different place right now because seeing you get that phone call, I'm like, how is this even a thing? Like, we just spoke to somebody on Jethro in Arkansas who's remarkably upbeat, and I'm like, yeah, you have to find hope somewhere. And so that, I think, for me, is a big part of where you keep this going, and you keep that hope, and you keep.
00:24:47.844 - 00:25:19.066, Speaker B: You see people who have suffered an incredible amount of trauma over and over and are still suffering that trauma right now, who are hopeful, who are resilient. And you borrow some of that strength, and then I'll just say, for me, I was born a fighter. There's some people who recite affirmations in the morning. I'm the person who's like, where are we going to war today? That's where I get my energy from. It's where I feed. It's like, I'm a fighter. It's what I love to do.
00:25:19.066 - 00:25:22.194, Speaker B: And so this feeds my energy. It doesn't deplete it.
00:25:22.274 - 00:25:47.354, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, I would say you're a fighter and a lover because there's joy. There's joy, there's compassion. It's awesome that you're on the team. You're leading the charge in lots of ways. I'm more optimistic than most people in the criminal justice system that things are going to change, partly because I got in late and I got in right as I saw change happening. And I think the opportunity for change is bigger than other people.
00:25:47.354 - 00:25:53.792, Speaker A: I really think we've got this seven, eight year window where we can really flip the whole narrative. And so.
00:25:53.928 - 00:25:56.448, Speaker B: And I think it's important to recognize that didn't happen overnight.
00:25:56.496 - 00:26:06.600, Speaker A: There's a lot of foundation. Right. We stand on the shoulders of all these people. A lot of them are completely, you know, people all know Bryan Stevenson, but there are 50 people that no one knows their names.
00:26:06.672 - 00:26:26.586, Speaker B: Yeah. And there was, you know, decades of work before Brian. Yeah, right. Like, they're, like, this work goes really far back. Right. When I think about this fight to abolish slavery for good in the US, just think about how long that fight's been waged. So it's a fight that's been going on for a long time, and I think that resiliency also gives us hope.
00:26:26.650 - 00:26:31.466, Speaker A: So, Bianca, how do people find out about worth rises? How do they get in touch with you? How do they follow you? What's your twitter?
