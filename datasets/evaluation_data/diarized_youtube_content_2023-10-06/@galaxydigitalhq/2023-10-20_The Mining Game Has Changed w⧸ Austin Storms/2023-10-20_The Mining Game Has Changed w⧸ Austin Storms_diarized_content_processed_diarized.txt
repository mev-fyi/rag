00:00:03.120 - 00:00:32.550, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains podcasts from Galaxy Research. We're the best. Never spit in jest, only bring finesse, never rest when I put the pencil back down on the test? Press your mental kings and teens? Cause it's time to play some chess, yo, put your thinking cap? Consider blinking back that sinking feeling that our world can't come back. It can. The world's problems, they were caused by man. So it stands to reason they can be solved by our hands, yo, nothing is final. Every suture can be thread, every door can be open.
00:00:32.550 - 00:00:51.594, Speaker A: Every future can be dread. Every possible obstacle can be lost or born. And we're talking bitcoin mining with my homie Austin storms. Whether the weather is super rainy or whether market insanely levered or level headed endeavor to build something go getter other than total indebtedness every time you develop a rhyme and sure that it's better.
00:00:52.534 - 00:01:19.730, Speaker B: As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital. Thank you for listening to Galaxy Brainstorm. We have a great show for you today. As I said, Austin Storms, co head of bitcoin mining at Galaxy, is our guest. We'll talk about how miners are preparing for the halving interesting power strategies and dynamics in the ErCot power market and much more. We'll also check with our good friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading, as always, to discuss markets and macro.
00:01:19.842 - 00:01:20.842, Speaker A: But before we get to all that.

00:01:32.586 - 00:01:46.586, Speaker B: It's a really interesting week in bitcoin markets. A lot has happened, so let's just jump right into it with BIM. Net. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, my friend Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:01:46.690 - 00:01:47.842, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:01:47.978 - 00:02:02.624, Speaker B: Yeah, what an exciting week it's been so far. It feels like ETF speculation and consideration is really picking up after that headline that turned out to be inaccurate was published on Monday morning. What did you see on Monday?
00:02:03.004 - 00:03:16.796, Speaker C: We saw a tremendous amount of short covering in spot and in options form. We saw renewed interest, renewed attention to the bitcoin ETF and the timeline around that. Since then, we've seen healthy follow through in the price action of bitcoin. So far, you've turned the 200 day moving average, which was resistance, into support now and generally speaking, bitcoin has been trading much better than the rest of the crypto complex. So it's led to a bitcoin relative outperformance and just an outright sort of continuation of the uptrend that you've had since hitting a low of. So broadly speaking, I think folks that were short any convexity panicked and they quickly covered that convexity via spot and via options, and it really showed how under positioned the market was for an actual ETF announcement. I think broadly speaking, these developments were constructive.
00:03:16.796 - 00:03:36.100, Speaker C: The price action that you've seen after has been healthy, and it's now going to be at the forefront of people's minds that we might have an ETF that gets approved before year end or in and around year end, and so you don't want to be caught with your pants down in an asset that can literally moon.
00:03:36.212 - 00:04:10.626, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. It was an exciting and obviously strange thing that happened just for our listeners. If you didn't see, although I'm sure almost everyone did, Cointelegraph had apparently erroneously, certainly erroneously, we know now, but didn't right away posted that BlackRock's bitcoin ETF spot application had been approved by the SEC. That was false. It has not. None have been approved. I think prudent for market observers to rely on official communications from the SEC and others, maybe issuers or something to find out when that happens.
00:04:10.626 - 00:04:41.622, Speaker B: But what are we watching? I know you and I have been following the amended s one filings we've seen. Fidelity, Invesco, Galaxy and Ark have all refiled their s one applications with amendments. And those, I would say the updates have been relatively benign. Right. Sort of expanding disclosure sections and stuff. What are we watching for? Obviously we're watching for others to refile. But what does that tell you, the sort of character of those amendments, when.
00:04:41.638 - 00:05:43.762, Speaker C: You think about, I think you're totally spot on that the character of those amendments is completely benign. Right. They're not like huge fundamental changes to the filing. It's more like there's some risks around this stuff and it's like the proper disclosures. And so I think what we're getting at and what we're looking for is just language that's becoming more consistent amongst the filers as this process develops, the closer you are to just consistent language across all of the filings, the closer you're going to be to actually getting an ETF approval. And then most importantly, I'm watching the Jan ten date for the ArC ETF, which I don't think that there's right now a feasible path for the SEC denying that filing. And so I'm kind of viewing that as kind of the last, uh, kind of stick in the sand or whatever proverb you want to use.
00:05:43.762 - 00:06:59.084, Speaker C: Uh, and so, you know, that's, that's kind of, you know, what, what I'm watching for, um, in addition, it's just, you know, the one thing I, you know, folks need to keep in mind is that the last time, you know, bitcoin traded at new all time highs, it was around hype for an ETF because folks did believe that an ETF product would make, you know, that this asset class really go off to the next level. And I've said this before, the two things you have to keep in mind with the ETF is that the US capital market is the largest and best capital market on the planet. ETF has proven to be one of the best financial innovations ever in history for wealth creation. You are combining those two things with a bitcoin ETF product. And as the price action recently suggested, it's going to be unequivocally bullish. The amount of supply that's available in the market in terms of just liquidity for buyers versus the liquidity that's going to be brought on by an ETF, I think there's a complete mismatch. I think as time goes on, the market will continue to price in that Delta or that probability of an ETF approval much, much, much higher.
00:06:59.084 - 00:07:46.700, Speaker C: Therefore, I do think you're going to be in one of those situations where not necessarily buy the rumors, sell the news, but you are going to have a rally in crypto prices going into the ETF. Now, are there some potential negative catalysts between now and then? Government selling, potential finance action? Yes, but I do think those are going to be dips that get bought. And ultimately, I don't see a world where you're in mid November and we haven't gotten, we have a bunch of new s one filings and it's getting closer and you're not kind of approaching trend highs for the year. So I'm constructive on bitcoin, just specifically because of this catalyst, but also because of the macro backdrop as well.
00:07:46.852 - 00:08:21.724, Speaker B: Let's talk about that real quick. Because in sort of response to the fake news from Monday, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink characterized on Fox Business crypto, which he later said he's not allowed to say bitcoin because of their filing. I don't know what advice he's getting, but that crypto, he said, could be part of a flight to safety, along with things like gold and the dollar, given the macro geopolitical and macro environment, like, let's think about that and how that fits in, in your mind.
00:08:21.844 - 00:10:06.074, Speaker C: So, I mean, this is a brutal take, but let's just say that bitcoin's magic Internet money or just some random asset, right? And it's not something that has a long history, but it's just a random asset that the BlackRock CEO is talking about, right? If he characterizes it as something that's going to be a flight to quality, and he's one of the more influential macro folks on the planet because he runs a $10 trillion asset management firm, I'm going to be interested in buying that for the reasons he specifically said, whether it's in crypto, in bonds, et cetera, particularly in just allocating towards assets or narratives. And so when he puts a narrative that this is now a flight to quality asset, a gold asset, a safe haven asset, I am going to take him at his word because that is the messaging that the world's largest asset managers is going to go out to, is going to go out with. And so I think it's incredibly bullish in the sense that it will help shape the narrative and the conversation around bitcoin in a way that's much more direct, as in he's the guy that goes into investment committees that can go turn a board that's one or two people away from investing in an asset. He can go to these sovereign wealth funds and be like, why haven't you allocated yet? And so if he can do that and the price is appreciating, folks are literally going to look like not idiots, but they're going to look unprepared and or just not having done the proper.
00:10:06.154 - 00:10:08.010, Speaker B: Work if they don't consider it.
00:10:08.162 - 00:11:02.004, Speaker C: If you don't consider it, at the very least, you're not doing your fiduciary duty. Maybe that's a little bit strong, but fundamentally, right. Technically speaking, if you just think about bitcoin as a series of price returns, we know that over time in a portfolio with a small allocation, it has added to performance, it has delivered outsized market returns. In addition, it has diversified your returns, aka, it's improved the risk and the reward profile of your investment portfolio. For somebody that's just looking at their portfolio in the context of portfolio construction, you have to seriously consider this because it helps your returns and it reduces your risk. How on earth are you not thinking about that? Especially when the CEO of the world's largest asset manager is giving you a product that this is the narrative around it.
00:11:02.044 - 00:11:31.784, Speaker B: Yeah, we just put out a report about two weeks ago called Bitcoin in a portfolio that goes into some of that historical impact on portfolios that bitcoin has had. Let's shift gears briefly, bim net, and talk about the broader macro environment. I saw that two year yields were making new highs, trend highs earlier this week. So yeah, today, so people still don't, they're still selling those bonds. What does that tell you?
00:11:31.864 - 00:12:02.312, Speaker C: Well, it tells you that the data has been hotter than most market participants had expected. And so what you recently had is a string of really hot, hard data going back to a couple of weeks ago. You had over 300,000 jobs printed in non farm payrolls. So strong labor market CPI was really strong. It surprised higher, 0.4 month on month. And the components that you cared about most also came in the hottest ownership equivalent, rent and supercore, which is a gauge of services inflation, all surprised higher.
00:12:02.312 - 00:12:37.964, Speaker C: And then you had retail sales, which is a good indicator of the US consumer consumption is like 70% of the US economy, also surprised higher meaningfully. So you're talking about like a 0.7 month on month increase in retail sales. And August numbers were revised higher. So the critical parts of the economy and the critical points of hard data that the market looks at have all surprised higher. And therefore you have seen a repricing of interest rates to go along with that. And you're now seeing like, as we speak, thirties are sitting at over 5% now.
00:12:37.964 - 00:13:12.216, Speaker C: Two year yields are at five and a quarter tens or look like they want to go to 5%. And this is in a world where we have a potential political conflict that involves billions of people potentially. And so I think it's quite telling. In addition, none of the supply stuff has slowed, improved, like Biden's trying to do another $100 billion aid package. What does that mean? That's debt that has to get financed, that's more interest payments, et cetera. That just puts things out of whack. And so there's nothing really tackling the supply issue in the market.
00:13:12.216 - 00:13:58.560, Speaker C: And the Fed, even though they've recently tried to talk down expectations of a hike, again in the front end, they can't ignore hard data like this. I understand that monetary policy works with a lag and we're seeing cracks, but when the main thing you're targeting is not going your way and it's still surprising higher, you kind of have to question, am I right in my policy? And so that's kind of the juncture we find ourselves in, which is a lot of hot data and a fed that doesn't necessarily want to move the front end for it and a market that is taking that as a sign that it can sell the back end, particularly in the context of supply and dollars have gone, are now super bid as a function of us rates backing up again.
00:13:58.652 - 00:14:13.600, Speaker B: Wild. Well, it continues to be a tricky and interesting market. My friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading, thank you so much. Let's go to our guest, Austin Storms, co head of bitcoin mining at Galaxy Austin. Thank you so much for coming on. Galaxy brains.
00:14:13.712 - 00:14:16.288, Speaker D: Alex, thanks for having me. I'm excited to be here.
00:14:16.376 - 00:14:31.648, Speaker B: Yeah, we had a. I visited our site in West Texas with you last week and it was really eye opening. And we'll talk a little bit about some of went down. There was a solar eclipse. We'll talk about that. But I was like, it is time. Let's get Austin on the show.
00:14:31.648 - 00:14:36.792, Speaker B: You've been in bitcoin mining a long time. How did you. How long and how did you get started?
00:14:36.888 - 00:15:11.444, Speaker D: Yeah, I've been in bitcoin mining for, man, I guess almost. Almost seven years now. I got started with a friend of my dad's who was interested in the space. He kind of funded and bankrolled my first facility like a small half megawatt site. And then since then I founded a company called Barebox. It was pretty early on demand response and then worked with Marty Bent and the team at Great American Mining to do the flare gas stuff, and then came to galaxy from great american mining. And I've been at Galaxy now for really the last two years.
00:15:11.524 - 00:15:35.228, Speaker B: Yeah, it's been a long road. I don't know that many people, to be honest, that have been in bitcoin this long at this point. But a lot has changed. I mean, maybe before we go deeper in bitcoin mining, like, just high level thoughts, how has mining changed? I mean, obviously hash rates, I'm not looking at the chart, but I mean, if I think about seven years ago, that puts us around 2016. I mean, hashrate's probably like maybe 100 x since then.
00:15:35.316 - 00:16:02.504, Speaker D: Yeah, it's been an insane growth in network hashrate. As you mentioned, there's also been this technological shift on the ASIC side where ASICs have gotten. Just almost hit that point in the s curve where the new s 21 that came out from bitmain recently has amazing efficiencies and the power consumption really hasn't changed that much. It's a different game than it was seven years ago, but very excited to be playing that at this point.
00:16:02.584 - 00:16:22.040, Speaker B: Yeah. So how do you think about bitcoin mining in general? I see some people say that they're securing the network. Other people are maybe solely opportunistic. You had an interesting way of thinking about it. You were explaining to me last week, maybe tell our audience how you think about bitcoin mining.
00:16:22.112 - 00:16:59.464, Speaker D: Yeah. So look, the way that I think about bitcoin mining has changed over the last seven years. I previously was like altruistic, helping the network, which miners do. Miners are the heartbeat of the bitcoin network as blocks come out roughly every ten minutes. But a few years ago, I had a conversation with Chad Harris, who was formerly at Winstone and Riot, and he kind of changed my perspective on what mining is as a fundamental business. And really he communicated to me that miners are really nothing more than widgets. And you have an input cost of x.
00:16:59.464 - 00:17:35.334, Speaker D: You run that x input cost of electricity and other operating expenses into the widget and it outputs a y value. And the business really is like an undifferentiated commodities business between the x and Y. Like that margin is the dollar that you make or the dollar that you lose. And so, yeah, I am, look, I think miners, miners should be more commercially focused on the difference between x and. Yeah. And although like, we, we do support the network and we do support like certain, certain development patterns within bitcoin, like, at the end of the day, we, we are running a what, what I consider to be a commodities business.
00:17:35.454 - 00:17:44.766, Speaker B: Yeah, very interesting. On the, on the input side, um, I think the obvious thing people know about is like, cost of electricity. Right. But what, what else goes into that input side?
00:17:44.910 - 00:18:38.236, Speaker D: Yeah. So cost of electricity is, is 80% to 85% of your input costs. Um, in addition to that, you have just general labor and really SG and a expenses across the business that includes everything from your data center techs to your electrical technicians to your mechanical technicians to your back office functions. And those are probably 95% of your input costs. In addition to that, you've got general maintenance and tools and fan bearings and pump couplings and the miscellaneous stuff on site that breaks that you need to fix in order to run the business. And so really electricity labor. And that includes too, like the software component, we run an in house software team and then like general parts and maintenance requirements.
00:18:38.420 - 00:18:55.198, Speaker B: So on the electricity side, I know that for a long time, the game was almost exclusively signing long term power purchase agreements with producers. Right. How has that evolved? I guess particularly in the ErcoT markets.
00:18:55.286 - 00:19:50.610, Speaker D: Yeah. So, exactly what you said. For the first, I would call it maybe six or seven years of bitcoin mining. The game was buy as much fixed price electricity that you can co located at a hydroelectric facility or from a regulated utility. What we're seeing in markets like ERCOT now, like deregulated electricity markets, there's variability in different power strategies where you can hedge power forward, you can participate in demand response programs, you can participate in ancillary services programs, you can ride index, and take spot exposure from the market. There's just a slew of optionality that you get in markets like ERCOT or PJM that you don't get from the traditional side of, hey, I've got a regulated utility that's got this tariff rate for industrial customers, and I'm going to pay them $0.04 or $0.05
00:19:50.610 - 00:20:21.534, Speaker D: fully delivered for the next five years. Now it's, hey, I'm looking at short forwards on power in load zone west, and I'm looking at, okay, what is my index exposure? What's our thesis on solar and wind interconnections and variability on these shoulder hours where ERCoT has to manage the ramp up and ramp down? The game has entirely evolved. And that's one of the reasons why we hired Blake King very early on at my tenure at galaxy, because he's got the subject matter expertise to understand the physics portion of that equation.
00:20:21.654 - 00:20:49.816, Speaker B: Yep. Yeah. Very interesting. We had Blake on our podcast a couple of weeks ago, so recommend our listeners check that out. Blake is an expert in ErCot power markets, and it's a very interesting and sophisticated thing that both consumers and I'm assuming producers in ERCOT are dealing with. Now, when I drove into the site last week, there were maybe hundreds of wind turbines. How has the growth.
00:20:49.816 - 00:20:58.136, Speaker B: I mean, Texas is enormous in wind and solar. How have the growth of these renewables affected the grid generally?
00:20:58.240 - 00:22:14.554, Speaker D: Yeah. So, in general, like, the way that we view the increased penetration of renewables, specifically in Texas, is you've got this great overlap of prime wind and prime solar, really, in the northern hemisphere, in west Texas, as more and more wind and more and more solar interconnects, and that grid mix gets higher vres, or variable renewable output from wind and solar. What we're seeing is this barbell distribution of pricing, almost where you've got really cheap pricing during the day. For example, when we were on site Saturday, I think power prices were, like, steady $0 per megawatt hour in load zone west, because it was sunny outside of the small eclipse event, it was sunny and it was relatively cool. But you get this variability in what I consider to be the PVGR or the photovoltaic generation ramp up and ramp down in the morning and the evening, where you've got ten to twelve gigs of solar ramping up and ramping down. That creates a physics problem for ERCOT in the event that there's, like, a significant amount of, like, system wide demand or load on the grid. And so as we see more and more solar interconnect and more and more wind interconnect, like, my.
00:22:14.554 - 00:22:39.854, Speaker D: Really, our general thesis is that we get very cheap power when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing. But during. During these, like, you know, the early morning hours and late evening hours when the sun's setting, there's a. There's a physics problem that's difficult to solve, and we expect that there's going to be more and more high priced events during those hours.
00:22:39.974 - 00:22:52.198, Speaker B: Yeah. And those are when people wake up and they turn everything on, they make breakfast, and then it's when they come back from work. Right. And they cook dinner, they watch the tv. Right. Those are the higher demand periods.
00:22:52.366 - 00:23:22.672, Speaker D: Exactly, yeah. And, like, in the summer, those higher demand periods, they correlate, like, with exactly what you said. Folks are coming home from work, it's 105 degrees or 110 degrees outside in Texas, they're cranking down the air condition to get comfortable. And so you get this, like, this glut of residential load that's ramping up. At the same time, solar is also ramping down, or beginning to ramp down, and that's just a difficult physics problem to solve. Yeah, it's really fascinating, Preston.
00:23:22.688 - 00:23:27.164, Speaker B: So how do bitcoin miners then contribute to solving that physics problem?
00:23:27.554 - 00:24:26.514, Speaker D: Yeah, great, great question again. So, bitcoin miners have really two options to help solve that physics problem. The first is ERCoT's demand response, or ancillary services programs that allow ERCOT to control the ramp up or ramp down of mining facilities based on the obligation that the mining facility and the load resource carries forward for that specific program. There are things like responsive reserves, non spin ERCOT's most recent program, ECRs, that aims to solve specifically that solar ramp down period in the evening. And then also, miners can just respond to wholesale power prices every five minutes within ERCOT. And so, as solar ramps down in the evening and those prices begin to spike, miners that are price responsive loads within ERCOT are able to curtail the facilities to reduce this total system demand and have a negative effect or net negative effect on power pricing during those periods.
00:24:26.674 - 00:24:33.854, Speaker B: So the demand spikes, the cost spikes, and then miners can just turn off, basically.
00:24:34.314 - 00:25:21.560, Speaker D: Exactly correct. So, the way that we view it is, any miners in the state of Texas that are running what we call index, or spot price, exposed, they have a dollar per megawatt hour strike price for their specific facilities, and maybe even more granular for that, for their specific machines. Those miners respond to wholesale prices in a way that when the arbitrage between the input price, x is less than their output price of y, on a normalized basis for the actual power being consumed. Like, great run. There's a positive arb there. When power prices spike above the value of the lost load for those miners, the miners are economically incentivized to then turn off to avoid those high prices where they're running marginally negative against the real time spot price.
00:25:21.672 - 00:25:33.880, Speaker B: Yeah. And that helps the. In addition, protects the miner from mining at an uneconomical price. It also essentially frees up significant load for the grid, which helps bring the price down for everyone.
00:25:33.952 - 00:26:08.232, Speaker D: Right, exactly. Yeah. That's the other point that's oftentimes missed. So, like, right now, I think Ercot's large, flexible load, the most recent literature that they've put out, is roughly two to 2.2 gigawatts of large, flexible, like mining load within the state of Texas. As power prices go up, how ERCot determines power prices for the next five minutes, sked print is really just solving the disparity and the difference between supply and demand. So, a price print above what the value of the lost load of the miner is, you may have.
00:26:08.232 - 00:26:27.324, Speaker D: Because there's a. What's the word I'm looking for? There's a similarity between that value of the lost load, based on the number of machines that are running and the type of machine you may have, two gigs of miners start to ramp down when they see that price print, which alleviates the difference between supply and demand that ercot's trying to solve.
00:26:27.824 - 00:27:17.680, Speaker B: Yeah, it's wild. So, this is what I was really hoping would happen, uh, and did happen briefly, when we were at the site last weekend, uh, during the solar eclipse. I'm saying to myself, I'm talking to Blake and, uh, and I'm talking to Austin, and I'm hearing that, okay, like, you're explaining the solar physics problem to me, and I'm like, well, while I'm there, isn't the sun supposed to basically turn off right over west Texas? And it did. Right. Although we didn't actually get a great view of it, I think it was about 80% covered where we were, so you could see the light changed and stuff. But it was still plenty of sun to, like, keep the, you know, wasn't dark out south of us, you know, near, like, San Antonio. It was pitch black for a little bit, but over many parts of Texas where the solar is, it was significantly reduced.
00:27:17.680 - 00:27:24.264, Speaker B: Right. And I was like, I wonder if that will price the spike and will our facility curtail what happened?
00:27:24.344 - 00:28:27.166, Speaker D: Yeah. So we were standing inside the Helios facility, kind of watching our main dashboard that shows the site load, the power prices, et cetera, et cetera. And as we reach that peak eclipse, power prices went from, I think, in the low dollars per megawatt hour, like, single digits dollar per megawatt hour immediately to 100, 200, $300 per megawatt hour. As ERCOT was trying to manage the ramp down at the beginning of the eclipse, across their entire footprint, prices spike, we begin to curtail. As we're standing there, we see the first price spike, um, and, you know, in addition to the prices that we saw, you know, because. And I think I told you this, Alex, like, traditionally, ERCot manages like a, like a two and a half to three and a half hour ramp down of the solar at the end of the day. But, like, this solar ramp down was almost, you know, 80% to 90% of nameplate capacity of their expectations over an hour and a half period.
00:28:27.166 - 00:29:00.108, Speaker D: So the velocity of the ramp down was much quicker during the eclipse, eventually. And so they actually ran a. I believe they ran an off cycle scad, which is a inter five minute sched run within their systems to provide an additional price print and additional direction to load resources and generation resources within ERCOT to help balance the grid, because the ramp down was so quickly. And so it was really cool to see, see that play out in real time and be in the facility when it started to curtail. But that's, that's the second way that miners do help, help with this grid issue. Yeah.
00:29:00.156 - 00:29:11.260, Speaker B: And it wasn't like you or any of the folks down at our site were, like, running around flipping switches. Right? Like, we watched it in an automated basis. Right. Does our. Does the software do that?
00:29:11.332 - 00:29:45.260, Speaker D: Yes, the software does that. So we run an in house, like, proprietary software program that manages all of our curtailments, resumptions, everything related to our power strategy, and that's all automatic. It runs 24, 7365, monitors a set of conditions that we think are important in making those determinations. And ultimately, like, as you're standing there, we don't have, you know, we don't have 100 techs running around flipping breakers and manually shutting machines down. Like, we, we manage all of that through software now. Yep.
00:29:45.332 - 00:30:06.844, Speaker B: Yeah. That's awesome. Let's, let's shift gears a little bit and talk about some bitcoin development stuff, if that's interesting. I mean, I, you know, we talked about before some of the inputs, but what about some of the outputs? Right. So we know the output we're talking about is bitcoin. Right. It's BTC is what the machines literally create.
00:30:06.844 - 00:30:50.362, Speaker B: There's a lot of debate in, in the bitcoin world about, you know, and there has been for as long as bitcoin's really been around the proper use of bitcoin, the, you know, what bitcoin's really meant to be used for. And I would say there's been a big discussion, more discussion, I think, than maybe ever, but certainly in years since perhaps the launch of ordinals earlier this year about bitcoin as a platform. So not just bitcoin as a monetary network, but also perhaps as a platform upon which other applications can be built. You've got things like drive chains and new L2s that are launching. How does that factor in? What does a miner think about that if you're thinking about it as a commodities business?
00:30:50.488 - 00:31:38.394, Speaker D: Yeah. So my personal belief is that all development on top of bitcoin is good for bitcoin. As we look at from a mining perspective, what it means to have ordinals or to have these drive chains. My general non specific understanding is that the increase in transaction fees caused by this usage is relatively good for not only bitcoin, but also good for, like, our business as a miner. Anytime that I have a spike in transaction fees that makes me more profitable. I'm not ever going to not take that. I'm always going to say, okay, more transaction fees, great for the business, increase the value of the y and the spread between my x inputs.
00:31:38.514 - 00:31:51.464, Speaker B: Yep. Yeah. It's so interesting. But of course, miners also, when it comes to say, new protocol development questions. Right. Bitcoin also has to keep functioning. I mean, obviously.
00:31:51.464 - 00:32:16.644, Speaker B: Right, right. So it's an interesting balance. But I, you know, I've heard, you know, we won't go deep on drive chains. Maybe I'll do an episode on what drive chains really are, but there's been a lot of debate for those that follow, like, bitcoin Twitter. But it does seem pretty straightforward to me. Right. Miners collect revenue from newly issued bitcoin and from transaction fees that transactors attach to their transactions when they send them.
00:32:16.644 - 00:32:46.630, Speaker B: So just increasing the delta between the inputs and outputs, which of course this would, you know, any additional fees would do seems like a, you know, just a general no brainer. I think we haven't seen really many minoring many miners, I should say we haven't seen many miners speak out against or in favor of most of these things, but I have to assume most are in favor for that. Are in favor theoretically at least. Maybe not specifically on any one proposal, but theoretically on sort of any of these platform type plays.
00:32:46.782 - 00:33:32.176, Speaker D: I think theoretically when you're running a business, it's difficult to say that any increase in the profitability of your business is not something that you support. But to your previous point, Alex, if any of these drastically change the consensus rule set or mechanism in their proposal, obviously bitcoin still has to work. And at the point in which the base layer does ossify and we are not opening bitcoin up to any major changes, I think that's where we're comfortable at least saying, hey, anything that you build on top of this, great. But don't mess with the underlying bitcoin, don't mess with the underlying consensus ruleset.
00:33:32.320 - 00:33:43.672, Speaker B: Yeah. In your mind it's if the risk of an upgrade or new type of usage approaches anything that could be existential, a problem for bitcoin, then you certainly wouldnt be in favor of that.
00:33:43.808 - 00:33:45.424, Speaker D: Exactly correct. Yeah, yeah.
00:33:45.504 - 00:34:14.084, Speaker B: Fascinating. And just like a couple of random questions here, theres bitcoin mining things that I think about sometimes. So you have the China ban right? Supposedly. I mean well we know a lot of hash rate came offline and we then later saw a lot of hashrate come online in the US, which has better property rights. I think there's reasons for that. Plenty of energy production. They're still mining in China though right? I mean I know like Cambridge and others that try to estimate this.
00:34:14.084 - 00:34:20.044, Speaker B: Like they, they claimed that it went to zero, but like that doesn't seem true. Are they still mining in China?
00:34:20.204 - 00:34:52.296, Speaker D: Look, I have no definitive proof that they're still mining in China, but I also have no definitive proof that they're not mining in China anymore. And so like as, as I understand it, there is, there is some mining activity still going on in China, albeit less than there was before the big ban. But if I was a betting man, which alex I am, I would say there's probably still low double digit mining activity in terms of network hash rate within the borders of China today.
00:34:52.400 - 00:35:05.100, Speaker B: And then you mentioned Gam, who you worked with great american mining. They were really focused on the flare gas opportunity, or are focused on it. Right. What is that? Just for our listeners who may not know, what is that type of mining?
00:35:05.172 - 00:35:31.676, Speaker D: Yeah. So flare gas. And being able to monetize wasted flare gas. When I was at Great American Mining, I was the director of engineering. So I was in charge of all of our hardware and software for setting up these systems at upstream oil and gas production facilities. And flare gas, for people who don't know it, it's like a waste product of the oil and gas, like, upstream emp process. So, oil and gas companies, they typically care about the crude.
00:35:31.676 - 00:36:23.352, Speaker D: Crude oil is, like their main product. That's what they produce. That's what they sell to a midstream company and deliver it downstream to refineries. In the process of producing that crude, though, there's associated gas that comes into the production process. And what do they do with it? If there's midstream pipeline or takeaway for it, they'll sell it into the midstream pipeline. But if there's not, and there's some type of either physical constraint in the midstream infrastructure, or it's just not economical for them to sell it, they'll flare it and burn it on site. When I was at great american mining, we stood up infrastructure to go on site on oil pads in North Dakota, in Wyoming, in Pennsylvania, to take flare gas from these facilities that were producing the oil and generate electricity on site to mine bitcoin in these very remote areas.
00:36:23.352 - 00:36:32.688, Speaker D: And there are a couple other companies that do this as well. But, no, it was a really interesting experience, especially from an engineering standpoint.
00:36:32.816 - 00:36:53.762, Speaker B: I bet because you're out far in the middle of nowhere, there's a lot of containerized stuff happening. And I guess is the idea that for the producer, the gas is essentially a byproduct. Right. Like, if they don't have takeaway capacity for the gas wherever they are drilling remotely, then, like you said, they. They flare it or even vent it often. Right. Just methane.
00:36:53.762 - 00:36:56.654, Speaker B: We're talking about methane. Right. Just going right into the atmosphere.
00:36:57.074 - 00:37:07.706, Speaker D: It's exactly correct. The majority of. The majority of the gas composition is methane. Now, I will say, like, we don't really vent gas in the United States. We always really combust it.
00:37:07.850 - 00:37:08.658, Speaker C: Okay, so.
00:37:08.706 - 00:37:10.458, Speaker D: But that combustion, that's like the.
00:37:10.506 - 00:37:16.048, Speaker B: That's like, at the top of a. Like a smokestack looking thing on an oil field. That's the burning flame, right?
00:37:16.226 - 00:37:30.060, Speaker D: Exactly. That's the burning flame. That you see. And oftentimes it's blue. Sometimes it burns with black smoke because it has heavier liquids in it. But that's exactly correct. It's a byproduct of the oil production process.
00:37:30.060 - 00:37:54.460, Speaker D: And the way that we structured things at great american mining was, hey, this has found money for the producer. You sell us this gas locally on site because it's not economical for you to sell it elsewhere. We pay you for it where you were otherwise just flaring it, and we come in and set up everything else. And so it was a win win. And then great american mining got acquired by Crusoe last year in the throes of the market.
00:37:54.612 - 00:37:56.184, Speaker B: And they do that too. Yeah.
00:37:56.644 - 00:37:57.804, Speaker D: As well. Yeah.
00:37:57.844 - 00:38:09.780, Speaker B: It's interesting because you're getting cheap electrical generation. So I guess you run like a methane combustion engine or something like that. Generator. Electrical generator that takes those gases. Um, and then you mine there.
00:38:09.812 - 00:38:10.100, Speaker D: And.
00:38:10.172 - 00:38:19.796, Speaker B: And I guess, like, mining doesn't use a lot of bandwidth. Right. Like you can mine on out in those remote oil fields. What do you need connectivity wise? Like a cell phone, basically, or.
00:38:19.900 - 00:38:28.028, Speaker D: Yeah. So, look, when we. When we started on that journey a few years ago, there was no. There was no mature product like. Like Starlink right now.
00:38:28.156 - 00:38:28.468, Speaker C: Right.
00:38:28.516 - 00:39:01.518, Speaker D: That allows you to have that remote connectivity. And so we had to get super creative. One of the things that. That we did was stand up, like multiple cellular, like, modems within the containers that would directionally point to faraway towers and then to decrease the bandwidth from the mining machines, because sometimes you had like two or three megabits up and down, you would. You would stand up a stratum v one proxy locally on network, so that those miners pointed locally there. And the stratum proxy was what was. What actually communicated with the endpoint in the pool.
00:39:01.646 - 00:39:25.462, Speaker B: Yeah. Wild. And then I think just one of the last points, too, is if you're combusting the. The methane into you produce carbon dioxide, which is both are greenhouse gases, but methane is a significantly more potent greenhouse gas. Right. So it also has a sort of an ancillary benefit of being better for the, you know, for the environment and for carbon, carbon production or whatever we call it. Right?
00:39:25.558 - 00:40:14.572, Speaker D: Yeah, it's totally correct. So the. I think it's called the warming potential of methane is like 20 to 30 x higher than actual, like, carbon dioxide as a byproduct of really combusting that methane. And so what we specifically did and what others do is you stand up like a reciprocating engine on site or even a turbine, if the gas quality is good enough and the exhaust manifold from that recipe or from that turbine, it's like it's outputting CO2 where previously you're running a flare stack that has some efficiency. Who knows what it is to burn that methane and you take a uncontrolled process and you turn it into a controlled, calculated, measurable process. And that's all. Yeah.
00:40:14.588 - 00:40:40.494, Speaker B: Because even if you. Yeah, even if you burn it and flare it on top of the stack, like, some vents out, right. It's just like it doesn't actually all get combusted. So now you have more. It's really interesting stuff. I know there's a lot more we could talk about, Austin. I'll just end it here with, I don't know, what are miners doing to prepare for this upcoming halving that is going to happen in April of next year? Just generally.
00:40:41.194 - 00:41:22.940, Speaker D: Really good question. What are miners doing? I think miners are shoring up their balance sheets. I think miners are restructuring debt. I think miners are preparing to operate in an environment that's less conducive to this 98% to 100% uptime that we've seen in the past and more conducive to optimization of free cash flow for the business with a lower uptime. And so ideally, miners are staying alive. Miners are staying alive with worsening economics going to the halving unless there's some catalyst that changes those economics prior to, I think, mid April of next year.
00:41:23.012 - 00:41:36.412, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's expected now. Clark Moody's dashboard tells me it's expected on April 24. If we assume ten minute block times between now and then. Austin, this is great to have you. We'll have to have you back. Thanks so much for coming on galaxy brains.
