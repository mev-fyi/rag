00:00:00.360 - 00:00:34.694, Speaker A: What is modularity? What is it? Well, I think modularity is a little bit of the big buzzword in crypto. It represents kind of like a real shift in thinking of how we scale blockchains. If we think about how blockchains tried to scale, or how many blockchain developers tried to think about scaling blockchains before the modularity thesis, before modularity even became a term, we were thinking about layered scaling approaches where on bitcoin, if you think about it, how do we get faster transactions? Let's get a protocol built on top.
00:00:34.734 - 00:00:35.534, Speaker UNK: Of bitcoin that.
00:00:35.574 - 00:00:58.734, Speaker A: Settles to bitcoin, but doesn't actually execute every single transaction on bitcoin. And so that, I think, was really how the modularity thesis continued to develop out from. The difference, though, with the modularity thesis, is that with layered scaling approaches, you have these solutions on top of a blockchain that still allows the execution of transactions.
