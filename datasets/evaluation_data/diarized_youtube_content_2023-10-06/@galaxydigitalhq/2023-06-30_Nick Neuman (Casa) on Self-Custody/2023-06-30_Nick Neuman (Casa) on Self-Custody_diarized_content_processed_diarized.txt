00:00:01.930 - 00:00:59.514, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brands, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. See me diving feet first fallacies we burst till it hurts kicking dirt up and taking critics to the mat yo, I'm picking words that mess with analytics in the chat, yo this the time that we always hoped we'd have again building for the future with a slew of baddie friends don't you stand in line and wait for feet to pick you, man take a stand and build the Costa like Nick Newman I'm gripping on the earth till it stops its spin and I'm never letting go I've got more revolutions till it's time for me to end and I'm ejected into space I'll be dripping from my pen putting words into their place, yo. Cause I'm different call me dissonant just a couple miscreants making music for the dissidents savage with the visions of bitcoiners in their mission honey, it's funny we're here to fix the system and the money. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital. Thank you for listening to Galaxy Brains. We have a great show for you today. As I said, nick Newman, CEO and co founder of Casa.
00:00:59.514 - 00:01:28.114, Speaker A: He is our guest. We're going to talk with him about collaborative custody and their new product, Roadmap. It's really interesting stuff. And of course, we'll check in with our good friend bimnet of BB from Galaxy trading, as always, to talk markets and macro.

Yo, I am so happy we did this beat this week, Phineas.
00:01:28.114 - 00:01:47.726, Speaker A: I've been wanting to rap on this for a long time. And by the way, stay tuned to the very end of the podcast. We're going to run this beat out a little bit for you. If you want to rap on it, we'd love you to send in your own versions, and we will play those. But let's get right into the show. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abib from Galaxy trading. As always, bimnet, great to see you.
00:01:47.726 - 00:01:48.382, Speaker A: Welcome to the show.
00:01:48.436 - 00:01:49.710, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:01:49.860 - 00:01:54.270, Speaker A: I love having you on the show. And, gosh, I just was saying you look nice.
00:01:54.340 - 00:01:54.574, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:01:54.612 - 00:01:55.814, Speaker B: Where is your blazer?
00:01:55.962 - 00:01:58.402, Speaker A: Dude, I left my blazer back at Fidelity. Okay.
00:01:58.536 - 00:02:01.540, Speaker B: All right. You don't make you look good.
00:02:02.710 - 00:02:24.570, Speaker A: Well, we are on video, so I guess it does kind of matter to look good. But let's talk about the markets. Well, we didn't have you on last week, actually, and I have to apologize to our viewers. I told our viewers that Bimnet was on vacation, but actually I was on vacation and we weren't able to connect in order to do the weekly markets, so we just didn't have it at all.
00:02:24.720 - 00:02:26.534, Speaker B: I don't take markets, never sleep.
00:02:26.582 - 00:02:53.442, Speaker A: Obviously, he was here waiting in the wings, but I was like in a line at Disney World, so I was unable to do it. So it's been there for two weeks since we've last connected on markets, and a fair amount has happened. Obviously, bitcoin rallied hard on the blackrock, presumably on the Blackrock news, although the rally came about like two or three days after the Blackrock news, which is a little surprising to me. But when we're back up over 30k, absolutely deja vu all over again.
00:02:53.496 - 00:03:43.970, Speaker B: Sustaining above thirty k. Yeah, nicely right now. So high level. I do think the Blackrock ETF application is a significant market catalyst, and that as people start to price in a greater probability of approval, bitcoin's prices should definitely move higher. We've seen the impact of what a spot ETF can do, or rumors of a spot ETF, hence the 2021 rally, et cetera, and how much gold moved after GLD. There's tons of good arguments to be made as to why bitcoin's got to appreciate a lot more if ETF is going to get approved or if that probability is inching higher. And I think it's an order of magnitude higher than most people are thinking about it right now.
00:03:43.970 - 00:04:44.774, Speaker B: Right? Like you're talking about the world's largest asset managers coming into the space. There are more applications for bitcoin ETF than I can count. And each one of these ETF providers is going to have an incentive to market this product, get more aum into it. It's a higher fee product to begin with, and it's got a really great story at the moment. And fundamentally, all a good asset needs, or any asset needs is liquidity and a good story, and that's what bitcoin's got. The other thing to think about is just the importance of having an ETF from the liquidity standpoint, right? You launch an ETF, it's going to make bitcoin a lot more liquid from a spot stated trading standpoint, from a posting it as collateral standpoint from a derivatives standpoint. And the more liquid something is, the more institutions can take a look at it, the larger positions that they can hold.
00:04:44.774 - 00:05:12.314, Speaker B: And so it's one of those things that becomes self fulfilling or self reinforcing, where as liquidity grows in the product, more and more folks can jump in it. And that will help more and more folks, because more people come in, there are more dip buyers, vault goes down, of the asset goes down, people can allocate more. And so I really do think that this could be like a foundational paradigm shift for bitcoin if you do actually get the approval.
00:05:12.362 - 00:05:12.814, Speaker A: Right.
00:05:12.932 - 00:05:34.502, Speaker B: And what we're doing now as market participants is basically trying to figure out what the distribution of bitcoin is going to look like or what it looks like given the information that we have at hand. And if you start placing higher probabilities of an ETF, your value for bitcoin is going to start. Your expected value for bitcoin now is going to start climbing a lot.
00:05:34.556 - 00:06:39.606, Speaker A: It's interesting. Senior litigation analyst at Bloomberg, Elliot Stein, pegged the likelihood that the SEC would lose to grayscale in their lawsuit over the GBDC conversion at 70%. So they're guessing 70% likely that grayscale wins that case. Now, whether that results in, you can win a court case without getting the outcome you want, you can nominally win, but the precedent doesn't actually. But if it were to force the SEC to even just relook at approving a spot, bitcoin, ETF, or even in the best case scenario, force them to start approving one, or force them to approve GBDC's conversion, that you could see then as the catalyst for a near term approval of others like Blackrocks and Fidelity's and whomever's. Right, it does seem. And then you have to ask, why now? Why Blackrock now? They didn't file for one in 2021 when everyone else did, right? I mean, fidelity and Vasco and State street and everybody actually, maybe not State street, but wisdom tree and arc and all those people had filed, right? It was 35 filings, but no Blackrock.
00:06:39.606 - 00:06:46.158, Speaker A: Right? And then now, at seemingly the height of peak regulatory fud in some ways.
00:06:46.244 - 00:06:50.570, Speaker B: Well, it seems clearer than ever that bitcoin is going to come out of this looking the strongest.
00:06:50.650 - 00:06:50.990, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:51.060 - 00:07:14.598, Speaker B: Right. Relative to the entirety of the crypto industry, it seems like bitcoin is going to be unscathed. And if you're one of the world's largest asset managers or anyone that manages any real money, and it looks like, there's a clear winner in crypto and you've got clear regulatory framework around it, then it just opens you up for business. And what they see is a business opportunity.
00:07:14.764 - 00:07:15.142, Speaker A: Right.
00:07:15.196 - 00:07:24.018, Speaker B: They clearly view it as an asset that's probably going to go up, that's going to have tremendous trading volume, lots of interest, and it's a product that's been around for over a decade now.
00:07:24.044 - 00:07:24.234, Speaker A: Right.
00:07:24.272 - 00:07:31.690, Speaker B: It ain't going away. And so if it ain't going away, you might as well make money off of it. And I think that's where a lot of these institutions stand at the moment.
00:07:31.840 - 00:07:42.138, Speaker A: And we saw a little bit of an alt rally follow on the back of the bitcoin rally, but that looks to have stalled a bit. And ETH BTC is notably lower than. It's not like ridiculously low, but it's.
00:07:42.154 - 00:07:45.038, Speaker B: Starting to ground about 10% on the month.
00:07:45.124 - 00:07:48.642, Speaker A: Yeah. So what does the rest of crypto look like at the moment in your mind?
00:07:48.696 - 00:07:51.422, Speaker B: I mean, everything looks pretty awful. Versus bitcoin.
00:07:51.486 - 00:07:51.954, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:52.072 - 00:08:09.474, Speaker B: Bitcoin is the ultimate asset in crypto right now. The only reason these alts pump, for the most part, are short covering rallies. Nobody is fundamentally being like, I need to get long. Some of these protocols, I need to get know optimism with an insane unlock.
00:08:09.522 - 00:08:11.066, Speaker A: Schedule and like, new money, right?
00:08:11.168 - 00:08:26.030, Speaker B: Oh, I need to get long. Polygon, salana, these things that the SEC is clearly deeming is mad about, right? Like, wait, oh, I need to get long. Another new blockchain catalyst. There is no story.
00:08:26.100 - 00:08:31.166, Speaker A: And you mentioned, too, there's some base effect here happening too, right? If something's down like 98% on the.
00:08:31.188 - 00:08:50.040, Speaker B: Year or it moves up a dollar, it might be up like 100%. And so people are like, oh my God, look at these alt moves. No, step back. If salana goes from $15 to 16, yeah, it's a reasonable percent gain. But remember, we came from 200.
00:08:52.250 - 00:08:57.686, Speaker A: So what else are you looking at then in macro and in markets right now? What's the data been like? Anything interesting?
00:08:57.788 - 00:09:29.854, Speaker B: Oh my God, there's so much. To be honest, my favorite thing right now that I've been looking at and keeping track of is china and dollar. CNH thing is just gapping. Their currency is depreciating like crazy. Their economy is in shamples, they've got a looming, like, youth unemployment crisis, and they're cutting interest rates and engaging in easy monetary policy while the rest of the developed world is doing the complete opposite. And so that's been an interesting dynamic. And then this morning, you had a panel.
00:09:29.854 - 00:09:36.674, Speaker B: I forgot who organized it. But you had the G four central bank heads all on tv today in Portugal.
00:09:36.722 - 00:09:37.030, Speaker A: Wow.
00:09:37.100 - 00:09:40.630, Speaker B: It was Governor Bailey Ueda from Japan.
00:09:41.130 - 00:09:42.066, Speaker A: Christine Lagarde.
00:09:42.098 - 00:09:50.102, Speaker B: Christine Lagarde and Jerome. And it was so interesting because I watched this thing last year.
00:09:50.156 - 00:09:51.314, Speaker A: Grateful dead wasn't.
00:09:51.362 - 00:10:17.182, Speaker B: Yeah, grateful dead. I watched this thing last year and it was so funny because Bailey was like hawkish, Powell was very hawkish, and Lagarde was just so dovish. And now it's like those three guys or three people are all super hawkish and they're like, inflation is still an issue. We have to keep going. And then you've got the japanese guy still stuck at negative interest rates and having yield curve control with 4% inflation.
00:10:17.246 - 00:10:18.098, Speaker A: What does he say?
00:10:18.184 - 00:10:27.182, Speaker B: Being like, we still think that inflation is lower and they're concerned about the risk. We're going to wait to see how it develops. Total, we don't know.
00:10:27.256 - 00:10:27.954, Speaker A: Total outlier.
00:10:28.002 - 00:11:08.402, Speaker B: I mean, it was just so traumatic. But literally, I kept thinking about it. I'm like, that's the reason I'm long bitcoin, because you've got a reckless boj with a money printer that they try to solve everything with. And even when they're hit with an issue that every other academic across the world says that you're supposed to tackle. Right? Like, what did the ECP do? The crazy dovish ECB. All of these crazy academics were like, what is the appropriate policy response to high inflation? And they were like, raise interest rates and these guys are still stuck at negative rates. Yeah, makes absolutely no sense.
00:11:08.402 - 00:11:24.386, Speaker B: And then the other thing is, I've seen these central bankers before and it's like their true colors are. They're addicted to the money printer. It's like every single. I keep thinking about it. It's like they were talking about our policies. Coordinated. Yeah, they're coordinated.
00:11:24.386 - 00:11:45.690, Speaker B: These guys all talk, et cetera. But fundamentally, you know, what holds all of these things together, right? It's the US dollar. And what holds the dollar together? It's the fucking money printer. We are going to backstop everything. If treasuries go crazy, we're going to buy a crazy amount of them. Oh, if dollars funding goes crazy, here's a swap line to every single bank. Oh, if you can't fund your munis, here's a lending facility.
00:11:45.690 - 00:12:11.254, Speaker B: If your bank is going, if there's a bank run, yeah, we got this facility where you can borrow at par, you can take a bond at borrow $100 versus that. It is absurd. The entirety of money is backed by the full faith and confidence in the US to print money and people to accept it, because the US has got good printers and nukes and shit like that.
00:12:11.292 - 00:12:11.878, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:12:12.044 - 00:12:13.560, Speaker B: Anyway, I love it.
00:12:13.930 - 00:12:17.110, Speaker A: Bimnet, a BB from Galaxy trading. As always, my friend, thank you so much.
00:12:17.180 - 00:12:18.280, Speaker C: All right, thank you.
00:12:18.890 - 00:12:24.038, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, Nick Newman, CEO, co founder of CASA. Welcome to the show, Nick.
00:12:24.054 - 00:12:25.914, Speaker C: Great to have you. Thanks, Alex. Great to be here.
00:12:25.952 - 00:12:29.338, Speaker A: Yeah. So I've been wanting to make this interview happen for a long time.
00:12:29.424 - 00:12:32.842, Speaker C: Yeah. You text me once a month and say, hey, are you ready for a podcast yet?
00:12:32.896 - 00:12:45.710, Speaker A: I do, and I've known you for quite a while as well. I've been a user of Casa for a long time as well, so I'm really excited to have you here. Let's start right off the bat. What is Casa if our audience is unaware?
00:12:45.870 - 00:13:32.894, Speaker C: Yeah. So Casa makes it easy for people to simply safely hold private keys, and those private keys store their money right now in the form of bitcoin. And recently added, we saw, when we started Casa five years ago, we saw a problem, which was that you could either trust a custodian with your crypto, which has lots of problems, or you could try to hold your own keys, and people were losing money left and right because they were making mistakes. And so we've really focused on making it as easy as possible for everybody to hold their crypto in a safe way while holding their own keys. And so that's the gist of what Casa is in a package, making private keys easier for people.
00:13:32.932 - 00:13:39.906, Speaker A: Yeah. And on the ground. Right. You have a great mobile app. Makes it really easy. Is it for iPhone and Android or just.
00:13:39.928 - 00:13:41.042, Speaker C: Yeah, both.
00:13:41.096 - 00:13:41.700, Speaker A: Wow.
00:13:42.230 - 00:13:48.520, Speaker C: It's both. And it integrates with Ledger, Trezor, cold card, all the different hardware wallets. We actually integrate those.
00:13:49.050 - 00:14:02.106, Speaker A: So I use a cold card with my Casa, two of three, multi sig or multi key account. But I guess for the Ethereum edition of ETH, can cold card work? No.
00:14:02.128 - 00:14:07.260, Speaker C: So cold card doesn't work for that. So that's one of the things that we handle for you.
00:14:08.430 - 00:14:18.078, Speaker A: If I had been using ledger or trezor, which obviously support Ethereum for my existing bitcoin vault, and then I add the eth vault, I can use the same.
00:14:18.164 - 00:14:19.342, Speaker C: You can use the same key.
00:14:19.476 - 00:14:20.570, Speaker A: Is that advised?
00:14:20.730 - 00:14:22.430, Speaker C: Yeah, if the key supports both.
00:14:22.500 - 00:14:22.734, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:22.772 - 00:14:44.966, Speaker C: Then that's great. And we actually would suggest it because simplicity is the best thing you can do with your security. There's so many people that are trying to set up all these different things. They've got this treasure map of where their keys are and trying to get real smart about it, and then they don't think about it for a year, and a year later, they've forgot a pin or something like that, and they've lost money.
00:14:45.068 - 00:15:03.038, Speaker A: So some have described this business model or product design, I guess, as collaborative custody. I've heard that in the past. We can debate whether that term is totally accurate, but why is that? What is it that they're saying? How is this different than just using a hardware wallet by itself?
00:15:03.124 - 00:15:42.730, Speaker C: Yeah, I think collaborative custody is one way to describe it. That's like, kind of hits on it. Sometimes. We'll talk about shared security, but the biggest thing to think about is custody on a spectrum for crypto and for bitcoin and ether specifically. And so you, on the one end, got a custodian, which is very much like the legacy financial system. You're just totally trusting somebody else to hold keys for you and hold your bitcoin with those keys. And then on the other end of the spectrum, you've got full self custody, maybe on a single hardware wallet or in a mobile app or something like that.
00:15:42.730 - 00:16:33.546, Speaker C: And that's where you're holding the keys, and you've got full responsibility. If you lose a key, you've lost all your funds. Right? And so those were what existed before Casa came around and made multi sig, is what it's called. But we kind of started talking about it as multi key wallets or vaults, and that is using multiple keys, sometimes held by different parties, to secure one pool of funds. So, with Casa, as the simplest example, you've got one key on your phone, one key on a hardware wallet, and then one key that's actually held by Casa. And so you need two of those three keys to spend funds. And if you lose your hardware wallet, for example, in the old world model, you're sol, unless you have your seed phrase and can recreate it and all that.
00:16:33.546 - 00:17:02.590, Speaker C: With Casa, you still have the key on your phone, you still have the key held by Casa that you can always count on, and we can actually help you recover your wallet and recover your funds. And so that's where you get into this shared security model, where you still have full control. CasA can't move funds without you. We're only one key out of the three or one key out of the five at our higher security. But you can fall back on us if you make a mistake and use us to help recover your funds.
00:17:02.670 - 00:17:22.742, Speaker A: Yeah, I love it. I also love the fact that I don't know if I'm not an expert necessarily in hardware wallet usage or bitcoin security design, but one thing I love about a multi sig setup is that I don't feel the need to keep the seed phrase lying around for that. Even in that two of three setup.
00:17:22.806 - 00:17:35.760, Speaker C: Yeah. It becomes very much more of an optional thing for people. And what we found when we were first creating the product is just people were scared of holding seed phrases. They're like, I've got this 24 word piece of paper. What do I do?
00:17:36.130 - 00:17:40.606, Speaker A: And it is the private key. It's a very vulnerable piece of paper.
00:17:40.708 - 00:17:41.230, Speaker C: You're done.
00:17:41.300 - 00:17:41.678, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:41.764 - 00:18:12.970, Speaker C: And so they don't know how to save that securely. And honestly, that job is much better done by the hardware. And when you have to go write the seed down on a piece of paper, you're putting a private key somewhere that is not protected by hardware meant to protect private keys. And so with the Casa setup, because it's not so important to restore a single key, if you lose it, it's not as important to keep your seed phrase. Some people still prefer to keep it because.
00:18:13.040 - 00:18:14.074, Speaker A: Which is fine.
00:18:14.272 - 00:18:31.870, Speaker C: They want that extra level. They feel of security, they feel comfortable securing it themselves, and that's totally fine. But we think that most people will not use seed phrases when we get to mystical mass adoption of bitcoin.
00:18:32.530 - 00:19:23.694, Speaker A: I like not using it. The reason, of course, you have the seed phrase and you would keep it around is for redundancy, right? If you break or lose access or lose the hardware wallet itself, you can just use the seed phrase to reconstitute the whole wallet in a different device or on a different piece of software. But in this case, with a multi SiG setup, you have other redundancies, right? Like, if I lose, break or lose access to my hardware wallet, then I still have the key stored in my phone's secure enclave and I have casa. So then I just say, hey, Nick, I lost this hardware wallet, but I've got this other, like, we have to collaborate together to build a new wallet. I'll get a new hardware wallet, whatever. So I have other redundancy. I like that redundancy of the other device and the company to work with.
00:19:23.694 - 00:19:45.446, Speaker A: That feels much better to me than. And this is just personal opinion, by the way. Again, like I said, people can have been self custodying many ways for years. But that's what I've always liked about this collaborative custody type model or this multi key vault with a technology provider also holding one of the keys as sort of a resource. It feels very reassuring to me.
00:19:45.548 - 00:20:17.742, Speaker C: It's in the middle, on the spectrum, and it gives you all the benefits of holding your own keys without the drawbacks of doing it just solely by yourself. It helps mitigate some of that. And what we always say is it removes single points of failure. So you just have a much more resilient setup. And it now takes multiple things to fail for you to lose your money. That's pretty difficult to do. People can make a lot of mistakes, but it's pretty hard to lose multiple keys at the same time, unless you have really not set something up correctly.
00:20:17.806 - 00:20:26.386, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, so let's talk now. Why would you want to, like, why should people self. We'll call it self custody, broadly, because it really is self custody with a.
00:20:26.408 - 00:20:27.678, Speaker C: Couple of extra steps.
00:20:27.854 - 00:20:30.390, Speaker A: Why should people be self custodying their bitcoin?
00:20:30.810 - 00:22:03.266, Speaker C: I think when you really look at the history of our industry over the last decade, since it was started, there are time and time again, custodians cause problems, and that is because the asset itself is fundamentally different. They're bearer assets that don't have all the ability to reverse transactions or the ability to go claw back funds if they get lost or stolen. You can actually lose funds by accidentally sending them to the wrong place or by losing the keys. And so, over the history of bitcoin, we have seen repeatedly, institutions that were holding keys for people and securing all of their people's bitcoin, acting as a custodian, fail for a multitude of reasons. Even within the last year, we've seen different reasons, ranging from complete fraud and misuse of customer funds, to losing keys, to trusting, like lending funds to other people and going bankrupt. And then you still have the customers assets, but they're tied up in bankruptcy court. There's tons of ways that a custodian can mess this up, and there isn't the regulatory strictness to try to bring these custodians up to the level of the legacy financial system.
00:22:03.266 - 00:22:15.654, Speaker C: But even then, the tech itself is just different. And so even with the best regulations, you're only going to cover it so far. And so what we always say is, nobody cares about protecting your money as much as you do.
00:22:15.692 - 00:22:16.262, Speaker A: I like that.
00:22:16.316 - 00:22:25.130, Speaker C: So hold your own keys, like, protect your money yourself and make it easier, and we make it easier. And it's something that, when you think about it, everybody's like, oh, that's hard. I don't want to do it.
00:22:25.280 - 00:22:26.154, Speaker A: Casa is pretty easy.
00:22:26.192 - 00:23:14.682, Speaker C: I will say it's pretty easy. We have people there to help you. But if you think about it on a relative to any point in history, this is the easiest it's ever been to secure your own money, because historically, you always had to go, you had to have a safe for your gold that you're keeping, somewhere you don't want to be, storing cash, like piles of cash in your house. Everything was physical. Now we have a way, and there was digital money, but it was all kind of based on physical money. And there was no way to prove that pure digital money was not being double spent or owned by multiple people until bitcoin introduced cryptography into the equation, right? So now cryptography has made it easier than it's ever been in the history of the world to secure your own money. All it takes is a thumb drive.
00:23:14.682 - 00:23:35.570, Speaker C: And so that, we fundamentally believe, is a flip in technology that will enable and catalyze many, many more people to hold their own keys, to secure their own money, because that trade off of trusting somebody else versus doing the work yourself has changed significantly in favor of doing the work yourself.
00:23:35.720 - 00:23:59.226, Speaker A: So how it sounds like, and I guess it shouldn't be surprised, based on who you are and who you guys are at CASA and what you're building. But the capability of self custodying your assets that bitcoin introduced, and of course, with ether and other similar cryptos they allow, is fundamental to the value proposition here for crypto. Is that true in your mind?
00:23:59.328 - 00:25:34.120, Speaker C: Yeah, it's like, why would you use all of this new tech around cryptography, decentralized networks and nodes and systems, and just rebuild the old legacy financial system, where it centralizes into a bunch of central institutions that manage everything, you lose all of the value proposition of it. I think to the people that really understand the tech, the value proposition is not about the speculative casino of trading a bunch of assets and trying to make more gains. In fiat terms, the value is trying to build a system that is more distributed, puts control into the hands of individuals, and lets people actually have that control over their money. And that's the ultimate core building block of everything that is in this industry. And I think people, for the sake of kind of simplicity or doing things that they feel used to, basically, they've tended to lean more towards that custodial side of things. And we learn this lesson repeatedly, over and over and over again. And we've seen it a bunch with most recently, prime trust, binance, commingling customer funds with their company funds, FTX, massive fraud, Celsius, misusing, like, gambling customer funds in random defi protocols, and losing a bunch of money.
00:25:34.120 - 00:25:37.734, Speaker C: Prime trust actually lost the keys. So that was the.
00:25:37.772 - 00:25:39.020, Speaker A: That's what came out. Right?
00:25:40.030 - 00:25:41.610, Speaker C: That's what's alleged at the moment.
00:25:41.680 - 00:25:45.814, Speaker A: Yeah, I think. But alleged, like, in court by the Nevada document.
00:25:45.862 - 00:25:49.030, Speaker C: It's like a complaint, then they'll go litigated.
00:25:49.110 - 00:25:53.666, Speaker A: Yeah. So the allegation is that prime trust actually lost access to a large portion of funds.
00:25:53.718 - 00:25:55.280, Speaker C: Right, like $80 million.
00:25:56.130 - 00:26:03.558, Speaker A: Right. So to your point, it's either. It could be on one side of the spectrum, fraud, theft, but it could just be, like, negligence, a mistake.
00:26:03.674 - 00:26:14.610, Speaker C: And prime trust, what they're alleging is negligence of losing the keys, but then also taking customer funds and trying to gamble their way back out of that hole.
00:26:15.430 - 00:26:27.410, Speaker A: One big trade, one final on black. Yeah, exactly. It's always like the thiefs in the movies where they're like, there's just like, one last job, man, one final job to set us up. It always works in the movies.
00:26:27.570 - 00:26:28.710, Speaker C: It didn't work.
00:26:28.860 - 00:26:35.994, Speaker A: Yeah, except for point break. That one. That's a great old one. Great old one with Keanu Reeves. Well, he's an undercover copy. I think he catches them at the end.
00:26:36.032 - 00:26:40.406, Speaker C: But I actually just watched Oceans eleven two nights ago. Yo, good movie, great movie.
00:26:40.438 - 00:27:02.366, Speaker A: I got to go back and watch some of the. Honestly, we haven't had good heist movies in quite a long time. It was a great genre. Well, maybe we should have a good crypto heist movie, because to your point, there have been so many. But you didn't even mention some of the famous hacks that have happened. May not even have been actually negligence on the part of the custodian. Or I guess it was because they should have been more secure.
00:27:02.366 - 00:27:13.670, Speaker A: But Mount Gox probably was negligent. But there's been others. Finance was hacked. Their cold wallet. Remember? It was like $40 million at one point. CZ had floated rolling back the chain.
00:27:14.410 - 00:27:15.558, Speaker C: I forgot about that.
00:27:15.644 - 00:27:27.862, Speaker A: I mean, that was just a random thing. And I guess the issue is, like, there will always be. I mean, look at traditional finance. Let's be real. There's still fraud. There will always be fraud.
00:27:27.926 - 00:27:29.226, Speaker C: Yeah. And that stuff happens, right?
00:27:29.248 - 00:27:31.946, Speaker A: You just hope that you're not. If you're trusting a custodian, you hope.
00:27:31.968 - 00:27:33.306, Speaker C: You'Re not part of it, caught up in it.
00:27:33.328 - 00:27:35.502, Speaker A: You just hope you just trusted the correct one.
00:27:35.556 - 00:27:57.880, Speaker C: Yeah, but what's interesting is when you hold your money yourself and if you have the right tools to help you do it right, you reduce that risk significantly because it really takes you messing up a lot in order to result in losing your funds. Whereas when you're trusting somebody else to hold it, it's really a black box.
00:27:58.330 - 00:28:00.082, Speaker A: And they become a huge honeypot.
00:28:00.146 - 00:28:02.114, Speaker C: Exactly. It's a honeypot.
00:28:02.162 - 00:28:12.534, Speaker A: Yeah. With self custody, you significantly flatten out and broaden the sort of attack surface, becomes much more difficult. You'd have to be specifically individually targeted.
00:28:12.582 - 00:28:13.180, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:28:14.430 - 00:28:15.660, Speaker A: You could be.
00:28:17.790 - 00:28:50.774, Speaker C: You're much more likely to make mistakes with self custody. You're much more likely to lose funds by making a mistake than by theft, because the theft is just not worth it. And so when people are putting together their setups, they're thinking, like, okay, I got to protect against thieves. And so I'm going to do this super complicated thing, and that's how they end up shooting themselves in the foot. And so that's why we try to help people keep it simple. And Casa is actually protected against multiple thefts. Like, we've had instances where somebody had a customer, had their house broken into, and their ledger was.
00:28:50.774 - 00:29:19.066, Speaker C: So they were targeted and the person stole their ledger, but that ledger was part of their casa multi key, three key vault, and so they couldn't get any funds. We had another guy who was drugged, and they were trying to steal money from, trying to get him, and so they were getting him to log into coinbase and that kind of thing. And he was drugged, so he did it, and then it didn't matter because his stuff was in a multi sig.
00:29:19.098 - 00:29:23.742, Speaker A: Yeah. And Casa, he didn't have the hardware wallet on him or whatever, and it's like, he couldn't even do it if he wanted to.
00:29:23.796 - 00:29:39.046, Speaker C: Yeah. And so that's where having the right tool with self custody can really help. And for the most part, like you were saying, that attack surface is spread out so much that there's no honey pot to go after, and so it reduces the overall systemic risk in general.
00:29:39.148 - 00:29:40.040, Speaker A: Love that.
00:29:40.730 - 00:30:17.762, Speaker C: And if you're the type of person that is worried about being targeted by an attacker because you do have enough funds or you're a public person or something like that, we actually have a higher security tier that is a five key vault. It's more keys. You distribute them geographically. And we've got a client service team that has all these emergency protocols that we set up with our customers at that level. And we really are very familiar with serving that type of client. And so for those people, there's a solution, too.
00:30:17.816 - 00:30:18.610, Speaker A: Love that.
00:30:18.760 - 00:30:33.330, Speaker C: So, anyway, I think it's something that we've put a lot of thought into this, and I think it's something that people can feel more comfortable and find that it's easier than they thought it was if they just give it a shot.
00:30:33.410 - 00:31:26.438, Speaker A: Yeah. So bitcoin is the largest asset by network value is usually what I say, which is a semantic joke on market cap, ether is the second largest, but the Ethereum ecosystem is quite large if you include all the tokens and all the teas and whatnot. Casa just added eth, right? So for four years and nine months or so of Casa's five year life, you could only store bitcoin there. But now you can store ether in an adjacent vault with similar setup and I'm assuming customer service and stuff. What drove the decision to add eth, to add anything but then ether specifically, and say not, I don't know, like Solana or. Yep. And what's the reaction been so far from your client base?
00:31:26.524 - 00:32:17.238, Speaker C: I mean, the biggest driver of it was our customers. We had people supporting ether was the largest customer request for two years, basically. And during that time, we knew we didn't have the resources to do it right, because as a security company, we really want to make sure that when we do something, we're doing it to the level of quality that we want it to be at, from both a security perspective and from a usability perspective. And that bar, for us, is much higher than it is for most companies in our industry. And so we really wanted to stay focused on bitcoin as the biggest asset by network whatever you said, network value. Network value. And that was the right decision for the first few years of our life.
00:32:17.238 - 00:33:10.598, Speaker C: And then we listened to our customers and started mapping out what's the roadmap to securing ether and just generally entering the Ethereum ecosystem. And that's what really drove that decision for us, the way that we view private keys, much broader than just being a crypto wallet. We view this as a decade long expansion into private keys, securing everything important in your life that is digital. So our money has become very digital, our identity has become very digital, our communications are all very digital. All of those things are made better by private keys and put more into control of people by private keys. And so we want to be the place where you actually hold those keys and use those keys. So back to Ethereum.
00:33:10.598 - 00:33:47.720, Speaker C: Ethereum was the first step along that path in terms of it being an ecosystem where there are different types of money, different types of assets that people are wanting to secure. We're not even talking or thinking about expanding into other cryptocurrencies right now. Like, for us, we can be a much better product by focusing on fewer things that cover that the majority of people want to do, and making the core experience of holding private keys for those currencies as easy as possible.
00:33:48.330 - 00:34:39.314, Speaker A: I think it's fascinating. It makes complete sense to me that people would want to hold bitcoin and ether if you own both. Personally, if you buy an index of this market, I've made this case a long time, right. They're different assets. And I think together both obviously on a market cap weighted basis, I think ether, bitcoin and stablecoins are 75% of the total market cap of the entire crypto space. But also, from a narrative standpoint, the things that cryptocurrencies do and can do. If you have bitcoin, you got a huge one, maybe you definitely got the oldest one and currently still the biggest one, which is sort of money, right? But you don't have any of the blockchain type stuff, right? Because most of that's not happening on bitcoin, but it's all basically happening on ether.
00:34:39.314 - 00:35:01.254, Speaker A: So if you were to buy bitcoin and ether, in any percentage, you're holding essentially the entirety of the current market, in my opinion. We wrote a big report about this called ready layer one in November 2021, saying that bitcoin is different. It's over here. It's a whole separate thing. Read our bitcoin report to learn about that. But general computation, blockchains, it's Ethereum's game to lose.
00:35:01.302 - 00:35:01.814, Speaker C: Yeah, totally.
00:35:01.862 - 00:35:14.770, Speaker A: It's Ethereum and a bunch of competitors. So it makes sense that you would add that and that people would ask for. I'm interested in particular also about when is it on your roadmap to add NFT custody support into there.
00:35:14.840 - 00:35:59.262, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think, we think that that is a natural addition to what people are securing. And as you step into the Ethereum ecosystem, people expect that not only will they be able to store their ether with you, they'll be able to store their ERC 20 tokens, their nfts. And so that's something that is more of a win than an if in my mind. And it's something that we're really listening to our customers to see what are the most important things for you right now to be doing? And that includes bitcoin. Like, there are things we could be doing with bitcoin right now that we are very excited about.
00:35:59.316 - 00:36:05.698, Speaker A: I've bothered you over the years about some bitcoin product improvements, some of the stuff that people are doing now with miniscript, though.
00:36:05.704 - 00:36:10.866, Speaker C: But like time locking, super interesting time locking within the miniscript yeah, cool.
00:36:10.888 - 00:36:12.434, Speaker A: Time locking stuff would be fun.
00:36:12.552 - 00:36:24.790, Speaker C: But, yeah, it's something that we prioritize it all together based on what we are hearing from our customers. And so that's why it's a question of when versus, like, yeah, tomorrow we'll have NFT support.
00:36:24.860 - 00:36:46.670, Speaker A: Well, and that's the thing, too, is I look at. I raised this partly because some of the plebs on Twitter, the bitcoin, only Maxis, really, mostly. I mostly saw, like, relatively unknown, smaller accounts complaining about this, but saying, oh, Casa's added ether. They've added the great Satan or whatever.
00:36:46.740 - 00:36:47.360, Speaker C: Right?
00:36:47.730 - 00:37:17.746, Speaker A: They're no longer, like, a Bitcoin only company. I'll never use them. And of course, none of these people used Casa anyway. But that criticism, to me, has always seems stupid for even just a simple reason. If I have, you're a security company, and I love the way you help me secure my bitcoin. It's not the only thing I own, like, in crypto or otherwise, to your point, in a bigger thing, like, well, gosh, I'd love to have, like, dude, I'd like to have my house keys in a multi sig someday.
00:37:17.858 - 00:37:19.110, Speaker C: Yeah. I think there's some interesting.
00:37:19.180 - 00:37:20.098, Speaker A: You know what I mean?
00:37:20.284 - 00:37:21.194, Speaker C: There's some interesting.
00:37:21.312 - 00:37:39.230, Speaker A: I want you to secure everything. I'd like to put some dollars in there eventually, if that's, you know what I mean, for a company, like, essentially a custody or a self custody company. A self custody service provider. To me, it's like, if you're good at it, I want literally everything I could possibly have in there.
00:37:39.300 - 00:37:50.962, Speaker C: Yeah. On the one hand, I think we're lucky to work in an industry where people get so riled up.
00:37:51.016 - 00:37:51.678, Speaker A: Passionate.
00:37:51.774 - 00:37:53.106, Speaker C: Passionate. That's the word I was looking for.
00:37:53.128 - 00:37:53.314, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:53.352 - 00:38:43.582, Speaker C: People are very passionate about what we're doing. And so, in a way, we're lucky there, because it feels different than building a calendar app or something like that, that people aren't super pissed when you add a new thing to it. It's true. And so, in a way, we're lucky there and then. I think it's a benefit and a curse where sometimes people get upset with you when you do things. But we were very strongly guided by our existing customer base in this. And when you look at some of the things from a more market perspective, like, in terms of what you were saying earlier, like the market caps, and then also there were surveys that were, I think, suggesting about 80% of people that own crypto hold both bitcoin and ether.
00:38:43.582 - 00:38:49.730, Speaker C: And so it's like, how are you going to cut out so many of those? People want the simplicity of storing both in one place.
00:38:49.800 - 00:38:50.094, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:38:50.152 - 00:38:59.762, Speaker C: And before Casa, that did not exist for multi key vaults, you could not do a multi key vault for bitcoin and ethereum in one spot.
00:38:59.826 - 00:39:00.066, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:39:00.108 - 00:39:01.786, Speaker C: And so we're the only place you can do that right now.
00:39:01.808 - 00:39:48.322, Speaker A: It's awesome. And actually, one of the interesting things I've mentioned about bitcoin development that stands out, like you don't have an enormous amount of on chain developers on bitcoin, of bitcoin, even bitcoin core development. We're always trying to get these developers grants. There's not enough of them. I even argue, even though some of the core devs were aware, they didn't make the masses aware of the implications of taproot when it comes to something like ordinals, which they could have. And I feel like that would have come out in ethereum's core development process, because there's so many more people working on it. And that's partly because you can't really build on bitcoin the protocol the way you can build on ether the protocol.
00:39:48.322 - 00:39:50.706, Speaker A: Right. And that's been by design, and that's.
00:39:50.738 - 00:39:51.954, Speaker C: Perfectly great for bitcoin.
00:39:52.002 - 00:40:24.222, Speaker A: It is. But you know, what's in. I agree completely, and it's by design, and that's why I like bitcoin in many ways. But it meant that a lot of the innovation that's happened in the bitcoin world has happened in things like hardware. We got the block clock here behind me, ethereum, like hardware wallets, security stuff. None of it's as good as the bitcoin side. And so that's one of the things I'm really excited about here, is bringing the bitcoin security standards to ether, because I don't even know of anywhere easy or good to store ether on a self custody.
00:40:24.222 - 00:40:25.806, Speaker A: I know that, like, treasures and ledgers.
00:40:25.838 - 00:40:27.486, Speaker C: Can do it on a hardware wallet.
00:40:27.518 - 00:40:33.474, Speaker A: But it's like metamask. I mean, most people are just in metamask, right? Even without a hardware wallet, the vast majority.
00:40:33.602 - 00:40:56.078, Speaker C: So there are people have been onboarded to ether through metamask. And I think that that's something that metamask is great for what it's meant for. And even they know, even the metamask team is like, they want to help people be as secure in their self custody as possible and then use metamask as that gateway to the rest of the ecosystem like you're supposed to.
00:40:56.164 - 00:41:08.478, Speaker A: Right. I think it's just that the Ethereum user base, compared to the bitcoin user base, has much less experience in security, I think. And so bringing them a product like this, I think, is going to have a lot of impact.
00:41:08.574 - 00:41:37.498, Speaker C: Yeah. And I think it's a mindset shift for people. And there are some things that will work differently between the bitcoin and ethereum ecosystems from a security perspective. But we've done a lot of work to really make it feel like a unified experience between the two and to bring as many of those security properties from bitcoin as we can over to the Ethereum side of things.
00:41:37.584 - 00:41:48.030, Speaker A: Really cool. Well, what else do you have going on at Costa, though? So is it building out eth? What's the next big push? You just launched this eth thing.
00:41:48.100 - 00:41:56.158, Speaker C: We just launched Ethereum support, so we are working with customers through all.
00:41:56.244 - 00:42:02.130, Speaker A: A lot of these existing customers in particular, who'd been asking for it are like, okay, now I'm ready to get set up, let's get set up.
00:42:02.200 - 00:42:13.094, Speaker C: And I kind of touched on this earlier, but one of the big benefits about being a CAsa client is if you want to, you can get on the phone with us and do a video call where we will help you set everything up.
00:42:13.132 - 00:42:13.494, Speaker A: That's great.
00:42:13.532 - 00:42:44.990, Speaker C: So that you know that you're doing it right. And so right now we're just booking up the calendars with people, making sure that they can get their Ethereum vault set up right. And that's been super exciting. And we're getting feedback from people, then we're thinking about what comes next. And there's all the things within the Ethereum ecosystem that are interesting. I think staking is something that is currently, most people do this in a centralized way. They're going through coinbase or something like that.
00:42:45.060 - 00:42:52.242, Speaker A: Even if they use like Lido, which is a more decentralized way of doing it between the user and Lido, it's still.
00:42:52.376 - 00:43:17.894, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And so one of the things that we're thinking about is how can we bring that more to the roots of the user having control over their staking with their keys, but not make them run their own node. There's some interesting ways that we can do that. We're talking to some people about that. On the bitcoin side of things. We are excited about some of the things that have been enabled with miniscript.
00:43:17.894 - 00:43:50.520, Speaker C: I think that's bringing programmability to bitcoin in a way that hasn't really been there before. And it's something that has. Miniscript itself has been around for a while. But the hardware wallets just started supporting it. So ledger just started supporting it. Cold card literally added support like last week or something like that. And so it's a bit of a path to get there because it's a complex system and we want to take the same kind of care with that that we have with the other things that we've built.
00:43:50.520 - 00:44:00.230, Speaker C: But that's something that we're excited about and something that we see as a way to take the bitcoin security side of things to the next level.
00:44:00.380 - 00:44:07.482, Speaker A: Love it. Nick Newman, co founder CEO of Casa Congratulations on the new launch and thanks for coming on. Galaxy Brains, my friend.

Hey, like I said at the beginning of the show, stick around to the very, very end of the pod if you want to hear that beat again. I would love it if some of you would rap or sing on that beat and send it into us at research@galaxy.com we would feature anything that you did.
