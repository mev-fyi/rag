00:00:07.210 - 00:00:48.822, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brain, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. Do the math because we're back and we're glad to rebirth I'm the meanest rap phoenix back speaking at demons I'm the cleanest at the zenith of bitcoin it's that scenic yo, I'm dedicated, ready made to star meditative levitated yo, steady raised the bar because I'm deadly on the mic but I'm better with the pen but, yo, it's time for galaxy brains. Let's begin. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital. Welcome to Galaxy Brains. We have a great show today. We're talking with Bimnet Abibi from galaxy trading, as always, about markets, a meaningful material move in crypto asset markets up since we last spoke.
00:00:48.822 - 00:01:23.560, Speaker A: We'll get into why. Also talking with Saul Kadir from Galaxy Research about Solana and NFTs, what is next for that ecosystem following FTX's collapse? And we'll check in with Charles Yu from Galaxy Research about optimism and arbitrum, the two optimistic roll ups that are gaining a lot of steam on ethereum. But before we get into all of that, I need to tell you to please refer to the link to the disclaimer on the podcast notes. And note that none of the information contained in this podcast constitutes an investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. That's it. We got the disclaimer out of the way. Let's hop right into it.
00:01:23.560 - 00:01:30.694, Speaker A: Let's go to our friend Bimnet, a BB from Galaxy Trading. As always, my friend. How are you?
00:01:30.732 - 00:01:32.090, Speaker B: I'm doing great. How are you doing?
00:01:32.160 - 00:01:38.422, Speaker A: I'm great. I'm feeling good. Since we last talked last week, it's been a material rally in crypto assets.
00:01:38.486 - 00:01:41.062, Speaker B: Yes, it has. It's been a very fun journey.
00:01:41.126 - 00:02:03.090, Speaker A: And now, month over month, I think as of today, this is Wednesday. What, January 18, is it the 18th. I didn't screw that up, I think so. Today is Wednesday, January 18. Month over month, bitcoin and ETH are basically both up 30%. Pretty material uplift. I mean, you can see the block clock behind me says we're over 20,000 in bitcoin for the first time since pre FTX.
00:02:03.090 - 00:02:07.030, Speaker A: So we've, what, retraced the SBF?
00:02:07.450 - 00:02:20.794, Speaker B: Yeah, I would argue that it's just catch up to traditional markets. Traditional markets, basically since mid to late October, early November, have just been on a one way tear right.
00:02:20.832 - 00:02:24.778, Speaker A: Since that CPI missed to the downside, which was right around.
00:02:24.864 - 00:02:36.602, Speaker B: Right after the same day. Yeah. Nasdaq was ripping like four plus percent, five, six. It was up like 6% on the day as bitcoin was collapsing.
00:02:36.666 - 00:02:37.280, Speaker A: Right.
00:02:38.050 - 00:02:46.686, Speaker B: And it's only been going higher ever since as well, with the exception of today. And so there's a huge catch up. And you look at things like gold.
00:02:46.718 - 00:02:46.962, Speaker A: Right.
00:02:47.016 - 00:03:01.622, Speaker B: Gold went from 1650, around the same time to 19,000 or 1920. Right. Other sort of dollar proxies. Euro went from about one to 108.
00:03:01.676 - 00:03:01.846, Speaker A: Right.
00:03:01.868 - 00:03:03.634, Speaker B: So you've had huge moves in traditional.
00:03:03.682 - 00:03:06.870, Speaker A: Markets, and the dollar DXY has come down over that time, too.
00:03:06.940 - 00:03:07.526, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:03:07.628 - 00:03:08.422, Speaker A: Making way euro.
00:03:08.486 - 00:03:21.494, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And so I do think there's an element of this that is just catch up to traditional markets. Dollar weakness, us equities higher. There's an element that is base effects.
00:03:21.622 - 00:03:21.926, Speaker A: Right.
00:03:21.968 - 00:03:27.054, Speaker B: There's a lot of cryptos that are just. They were sold off so much, down.
00:03:27.092 - 00:03:30.878, Speaker A: 90%, like going up 100% after that. Easy.
00:03:30.964 - 00:03:32.078, Speaker B: It's super easy.
00:03:32.164 - 00:03:32.462, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:32.516 - 00:03:38.622, Speaker B: Especially. And then you had just a sheer amount of liquidations.
00:03:38.686 - 00:03:38.914, Speaker A: Right.
00:03:38.952 - 00:03:58.842, Speaker B: From the short side, from what we saw in exchanges, you're probably looking at at least $500 million of liquidations, if not more. And then I just think when you think about crypto down at such low levels, if you're playing it from the short side, what are you really playing for?
00:03:58.976 - 00:04:03.526, Speaker A: Right. Bitcoin is going to go from 16 to ten. That'd be a material.
00:04:03.638 - 00:04:18.634, Speaker B: Yeah. If FTX and the slew of things that had happened this year in crypto couldn't take us below 15, five. What on earth is going to take us below there? It would have to be finance.
00:04:18.682 - 00:04:19.646, Speaker A: That's what I was going to say.
00:04:19.748 - 00:04:20.730, Speaker B: Totally fraudulent.
00:04:20.810 - 00:04:56.794, Speaker A: Few minutes ago. Right. They're not as far as we know, but just a few minutes ago, the Department of Justice, this morning, they had said that they were set to take a cryptocurrency action. They would announce at noon, it's like 1230. So a few minutes ago, and of course, there's been talk, there was some Reuters reporting weeks ago. I think the journals reported on this, too, that there was a dispute among us regulators and law enforcement about what to do with. And so there's been this hangover on binance that there could be some kind of, um.
00:04:56.794 - 00:05:01.978, Speaker A: And so I think the market assumed that it must be binance, but it turned out. What was it?
00:05:02.144 - 00:05:04.870, Speaker B: It was a. I can't.
00:05:04.950 - 00:05:06.758, Speaker A: I don't know how to say it. Bitslato.
00:05:06.854 - 00:05:09.498, Speaker B: Bitslato. Or something along those lines.
00:05:09.514 - 00:05:10.522, Speaker A: So it wasn't binance.
00:05:10.586 - 00:05:12.990, Speaker B: It wasn't binance. It did start with a b, though.
00:05:13.060 - 00:05:16.074, Speaker A: Yeah. And there was a press conference.
00:05:16.122 - 00:05:42.202, Speaker B: There's a press conference. And I'll say, I mean, obviously there was some shady stuff going on with the exchange, but the cynic in me was like, the government just wanted to do a press conference and say the words Russia, china and crypto and take a victory lap about something. The only way this would have been better is if they planted some trees and got some carbon offsets. I don't know how else.
00:05:42.336 - 00:05:57.582, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a good story for the government given, like, the war in Ukraine and the geopolitics, and they seized the domain. They did that thing where they put up a graphic on the website. Now, to be clear, I don't think. You probably didn't. This is a russian based crypto exchange that I've never heard of.
00:05:57.636 - 00:05:58.302, Speaker B: I've never heard of.
00:05:58.356 - 00:06:09.442, Speaker A: That's why we were chuckling a little bit, because the pre announcement made it seem like, oh, this is going to. And I think crypto markets were a little bit jittery leading into this announcement, but it turned out that no one's ever even heard of this thing.
00:06:09.576 - 00:06:16.658, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I mean, bitcoin went from 21,400 to 20,500 pretty quickly.
00:06:16.744 - 00:06:17.234, Speaker A: Right.
00:06:17.352 - 00:06:41.680, Speaker B: You did have an s and P sell off of material magnitude separate from this. Separate from this at the same time. So it didn't help liquidity. And so, you know, you did see a bit of, you know, we went right back up the moment the market realized it wasn't finance. I do think that the biggest thing I'm focused on this year is.
00:06:43.410 - 00:06:43.726, Speaker A: Sort.
00:06:43.748 - 00:07:33.574, Speaker B: Of to start the year is the January effect. Folks that are benchmarked to crypto and have to invest in crypto, they're probably underweight and are therefore underperforming the broader market. So in theory, that makes them kind of forced buyers into this market. You can't be a crypto manager and tell your investors that you're not keeping up with crypto performance this year just because they probably stuck with you through last year. And so I kind of do think that there are going to be continued dip buyers, and you are going to get more and more folks fomoing into bitcoin, especially the macro types. I think there's a lot of momentum behind the dollar, weaker trade, and part of that is just bitcoin.
00:07:33.622 - 00:07:51.390, Speaker A: Yeah. One way to express it well is bitcoin. Absolutely. I was looking at some on chain data for bitcoin. And one of the things I like most is looking at what price coins last moved. It's the simple way of saying it, really. Utxo is last created for our more technical bitcoin.
00:07:51.390 - 00:08:19.050, Speaker A: Yeah. Because it sort of gives you an idea of on chain cost basis. Now I can send a coin to myself or to you, that's not a sale. And that would mess the metric up. But there was a huge pile other than literally zero to $600, meaning like Satoshi's coins, which is still the biggest cohort, because there's a lot of coins that have never moved or haven't moved in ten years. Other than that, 16, like five to 17. Two is the largest percentage of supply.
00:08:19.050 - 00:08:48.434, Speaker A: So a strong base basically was created down there. And what I'd like to see, for me to get more and more comfortable, I think there's many ways to think about this, but if we hang around these levels for long enough, you'll start to see that base move there and start to form a nice stronger base around 20. Right. And that's sort of how. I mean, I've got versions of this data that I pulled at different times throughout the year. Last year this looked a lot different. There's basically very few coins that last moved at prices higher than today.
00:08:48.434 - 00:08:58.466, Speaker A: Right. Like, most of those coins from, like, the essentially were already sold. Right. Yeah, certainly moved technically, but I think it's a decent heuristic.
00:08:58.578 - 00:09:13.782, Speaker B: No, I think that's totally fair. And the other thing to think about is just the pace of the move you had. It happened mainly between Friday New York close and Saturday Asia open. Right. Or like the overnight.
00:09:13.846 - 00:09:14.510, Speaker A: It was fast.
00:09:14.580 - 00:09:34.146, Speaker B: It was super fast, and it gave very few folks an opportunity to actually buy in. So if you were constructive, the space you wanted to get a little bit of capital on to start the year, basically you missed 10% of a move on an illiquid post Friday close.
00:09:34.248 - 00:09:34.850, Speaker A: This is why.
00:09:34.920 - 00:10:15.806, Speaker B: So nobody's had an opportunity to really buy this back on any dip. And so I do think bitcoin is going to be supported, and I think your case about the cost basis makes sense. That's the other thing to think about is these low cost basis bitcoin or anything that has remotely like a good average fill level. You have huge tax implications when you try to sell this stuff. If I'm long, a lot of crypto, and I know that if I want to get less long, I have to take a huge tax bill, I'm just.
00:10:15.828 - 00:10:29.590, Speaker A: Going to stick, especially if you're generally still long in your thesis. It also tells me too, the fact that people feel like they missed this move is like, well, we were down in those levels for several months, but it was just like, I know that news.
00:10:29.660 - 00:10:31.430, Speaker B: I know they're afraid after bad news.
00:10:31.500 - 00:10:32.280, Speaker A: I know.
00:10:32.890 - 00:10:35.750, Speaker B: And really it's just so tough.
00:10:36.810 - 00:10:37.990, Speaker A: It was a lot of bad news.
00:10:38.060 - 00:10:47.740, Speaker B: There's a lot of bad news. But think about it from this standpoint, who wants to go like 100% risk on to start the year after the year we just had?
00:10:48.750 - 00:10:49.322, Speaker A: I know.
00:10:49.376 - 00:11:01.674, Speaker B: It's an impossibly decision to make, right? Like you have to either be super irrational or like crazy genius level, like either zero IQ or like 200 to kind of make that decision.
00:11:01.722 - 00:11:07.742, Speaker A: Well, it makes sense. It's that left curve, right curve meme. Right. It's pretty funny though to think about it that way.
00:11:07.876 - 00:11:16.130, Speaker B: It's like I'm going to go gung ho Max risk on crypto gen one. Well, that's bright thing to do, right?
00:11:16.200 - 00:11:31.946, Speaker A: It turns out. Well, that's what's funny. To your point about the catch up trade and the benchmarking to BTC, I think a lot of funds, crypto, like liquid funds benchmark against bitcoin is probably the most common then some maybe against ETH, some newer ones, but also a lot against indexes. Right.
00:11:31.968 - 00:11:34.310, Speaker B: Like the crypto index.
00:11:34.470 - 00:11:45.390, Speaker A: And honestly, if you are benchmarked to bitcoin, ETh or the in particular, but you invest in other altcoins, you probably underperformed.
00:11:46.050 - 00:11:46.558, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:46.644 - 00:12:07.130, Speaker A: Or maybe if you're against the index it's a little bit better because the index is more diversified. Right. But that's really interesting. Okay, just a couple more minutes. So we got fed in like two weeks and beginning of Feb. But what do we got like on the macro side, what's the economic data you're looking at the next couple of weeks or what are you thinking here, macro?
00:12:07.150 - 00:12:16.546, Speaker B: Well, we had retail sales come out today. It showed that spending in December was particularly weak from the US consumer.
00:12:16.658 - 00:12:18.202, Speaker A: That's good, right, for inflation, right?
00:12:18.256 - 00:12:32.394, Speaker B: No, that is good for inflation theoretically in theory. But again, consumption is 60% to 70% of the US economy. So whenever you see consumption slow down, that's generally like, hey, markets pay attention.
00:12:32.442 - 00:12:35.338, Speaker A: To this because it could be weakness in general economy.
00:12:35.434 - 00:12:46.642, Speaker B: Absolutely. And if you listen, the credit card companies or the bank types, they tell you, the US consumers right now eating into savings and stuff and like credit.
00:12:46.696 - 00:12:48.658, Speaker A: Card level, debt levels are very high.
00:12:48.744 - 00:13:26.654, Speaker B: Credit card levels are rising. The delinquency rates are kind of rising a little bit. But they're still very low. And so basically, you play out the current market for the next six months, the US consumer might not be in such great shape. And that's kind of what the retail sales data showed us today a little bit. And you also had the producer price index data series today that showed softness and prices. But the thing I hate about these economic metrics is they're all backward looking.
00:13:26.692 - 00:13:27.280, Speaker A: Right?
00:13:28.610 - 00:13:32.538, Speaker B: This is Jan. 18. We're talking about what people did in December.
00:13:32.714 - 00:13:34.630, Speaker A: Right. Which seems like a long time ago, by the way.
00:13:34.640 - 00:13:48.134, Speaker B: Seems like a long time ago. But at the same time, what do we know about Jan. One to Jan. 17 or Jan. 18? Gas prices have started to rise again. Commodities have started to rise. Copper went on a tear to start the year.
00:13:48.134 - 00:13:58.018, Speaker B: Things like aluminum have been trading higher. So that producer price index, that was really soft this morning from December, you're already.
00:13:58.124 - 00:13:58.662, Speaker A: Hmm.
00:13:58.726 - 00:14:53.030, Speaker B: Oh, shit. Well, this is probably going to be higher, right? I'm trying to focus on more of the high frequency data points, like that Adobe price series that comes out a couple of days before CPI, other metrics along those lines. And even the Fed admitted this recently where there was some paper where they were like, we totally underestimated the usefulness of soft data, which is like, survey data, instead of, like, hardcore type data. Yeah. And like, anecdotal survey type of stuff. And so I think that's really important to kind of pay attention to going forward. Now, what I'll say is the Fed has gotten really smart about this stuff, and people like to shit on the Fed all the time, but let's not get it twisted.
00:14:53.030 - 00:15:41.754, Speaker B: They're like a bunch of Ivy League phds with a bunch of really smart people working underneath them, and they talk to a bunch of industry folks and smart contacts, all the, you know, yes, they messed up on inflation, but they're also some of the savviest people on markets. And what Bullard said this morning was, knowing what he knows now, all the forward looking indicators, high frequency points, blah, blah, blah, all that stuff, he's like, we got to take rates to 525 to 550, which is very aggressive. The current market pricing is only 490. So his four is 35 basis points above what the market's telling you. And he's saying, the reason he's saying it is because, God forbid, inflation takes back up again at some point later this year.
00:15:41.792 - 00:15:42.602, Speaker A: Stamp it out.
00:15:42.736 - 00:15:58.894, Speaker B: He wants just the insurance policy. Because think about it this way. Let's say you're at 525 basis points in interest rates in the US. Shit starts to go downhill. And we get nervous. Well, there's 500 basis points of cutting. You can have to get right back.
00:15:58.932 - 00:16:00.142, Speaker A: To where you said you might be.
00:16:00.196 - 00:16:03.610, Speaker B: Start printing money again. It's like, what are you really?
00:16:03.700 - 00:16:04.942, Speaker A: That cushion, it's the reverse.
00:16:05.006 - 00:16:12.798, Speaker B: Knowing that you could take mortgage rates from 6% and change right now to 3% overnight.
00:16:12.894 - 00:16:13.250, Speaker A: Right.
00:16:13.320 - 00:16:16.434, Speaker B: And all of a sudden, housing activity will start to pick back up.
00:16:16.472 - 00:16:41.738, Speaker A: Basically, if they overshoot to the upside, it just gives them more cushion when they need to come down. It's kind of like the opposite. When rates were already so low into Covid and stuff that it was like they had nowhere to go. They could barely do anything. Remember this? Back when they were talking to me? We were talking about this back when they were talking, not the fed, but commentators were like, what if they would have to go negative? Other central banks worldwide were like, maybe will go to negative interest rates.
00:16:41.914 - 00:16:42.542, Speaker B: Oh, man.
00:16:42.596 - 00:16:44.480, Speaker A: Fun times, nerp instead of.
00:16:44.930 - 00:16:46.222, Speaker B: Yes, yes.
00:16:46.356 - 00:16:54.830, Speaker A: All right, well, this is great bimnet, as always, our friend Bimnet Abib from Galaxy trading. Thank you so much. Let's go to Charles Yu from the Galaxy research team. Hey, Chuck, how you doing?
00:16:54.900 - 00:16:55.742, Speaker C: Good, how are you?
00:16:55.796 - 00:17:26.460, Speaker A: Great. Good to have you here in studio for the first time, a multi time galaxy brains guest, but the first time here in our physical studio. What do you got? A nice accoutrements again there. I want to talk to you about roll ups, specifically the optimistic variety. There's zero knowledge and optimistic roll ups. And we've talked a little bit with Christine Kim from our team on the podcast about the zero knowledge variety, which are sort of still a ways out, I think, in development. But optimistic roll ups are already here.
00:17:26.460 - 00:17:36.080, Speaker A: Before we jump into this, and you've done some work on optimistic roll ups, you have a report coming out on them. But what are roll ups in general?
00:17:36.530 - 00:18:07.470, Speaker C: Yeah, so roll ups are Ethereum's go to scaling solution. It seems like it's the one that they're pretty committed to at this time. And how they work is users submit transactions. They're executed off chain. And then a data aggregator or sequencer, in this case, they publish the call data of all these transactions just so that anyone has the data available to reconstruct all the transactions that happened off chain.
00:18:07.570 - 00:18:13.654, Speaker A: Okay, so they batch up the transaction information, post it to mainet Ethereum.
00:18:13.782 - 00:18:14.362, Speaker C: Correct.
00:18:14.496 - 00:18:19.660, Speaker A: And then what does that mean? What is that part of this?
00:18:20.130 - 00:18:51.170, Speaker C: Yeah. So between optimistic roll ups and Zk roll ups, the key difference between the two is basically when they choose to pay the cost of verification with optimistic rollups they choose to delay it. They'll post the minimum amount of data that's required to reconstruct all the transactions. And only in the case if someone raises a dispute against what the sequencer posts will they have to re execute all the transactions.
00:18:51.250 - 00:18:52.166, Speaker A: I see.
00:18:52.348 - 00:18:59.526, Speaker C: ZK roll ups, on the other hand, they'll post the proof of all the verification upfront with every single transaction batch.
00:18:59.638 - 00:19:22.682, Speaker A: So the term optimistic, I guess then is that the system, the community, optimistically assumes that the data is valid and that the transactions were done correctly unless a challenge is raised. Basically that's the optimistic part of that language, right?
00:19:22.756 - 00:19:24.706, Speaker C: Basically, best case scenario, yeah.
00:19:24.808 - 00:19:38.326, Speaker A: Okay, but that means there's a challenge period, right. So like a ZK roll up, theoretically will settle immediately, but technically there's a window for people to raise those disputes on an optimistic roll up.
00:19:38.348 - 00:20:16.390, Speaker C: Right, right. I mean, get into this kind of notion of transaction finality. Like when does it actually occur? For ZK roll ups, it's whenever transaction batches are submitted to the base layer. Right. But there is this challenge period that is open for anyone to dispute those transactions. But for the most part, because all the data is posted on chain, all of it does go into the layer one inbox, so to speak. It's basically finalized whenever a transaction batch is submitted with a ZKR, with an optimistic.
00:20:16.490 - 00:20:35.206, Speaker A: Okay, but theoretically, though, you could treat it as finalized when it's posted, a batch of optimistic roll up transactions. But three days later someone could challenge. Yeah, but if it's legit, then it would stay anyway. It would only be if it was like faked or whatever.
00:20:35.308 - 00:20:58.286, Speaker C: Yeah, and they do have this notion of penalizing people for whoever is the lying party, whether it's the one who's disputing the transaction or the batch transaction submitter. So if the system is working correctly, then the economic penalty will probably deter any malicious parties from doing. Got it.
00:20:58.388 - 00:21:06.690, Speaker A: Okay, so ZKR is not here really yet, but optimistic roll ups are here. What are the big optimistic roll ups on Ethereum today?
00:21:06.840 - 00:21:09.054, Speaker C: Today we got optimism and arbitrum.
00:21:09.102 - 00:21:14.114, Speaker A: Okay. And people are using these a lot. What's going on on these things?
00:21:14.232 - 00:21:55.854, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, we're getting there. Before the year started, we're seeing daily active users of under like 10,000. Now by the end of the 2022, that's closer to 60,000. So over six times the levels that we saw before everything started. But the way I kind of think of it, when compared to other networks out there, you kind of have two tiers of blockchains when it comes to user activity, first tier, probably Ethereum, BSc, Polygon, Solana, and then you have the second tier of, I guess, like aspiring networks. And that's where I would group arbitrum and optimism.
00:21:55.982 - 00:22:06.062, Speaker A: Got it. And what types of stuff can you do? On mean, are we talking about defi nfts? What are people doing today on arbitrum and optimism?
00:22:06.206 - 00:22:33.114, Speaker C: Yeah, so, I mean, with optimistic roll ups, you have everything that you have on Ethereum available. So all the big popular applications, most of them are already on optimism and arbitrum. But in addition to that, you have a lot more games. You have a lot more, I guess, like retail applications. Just because transactions are so much cheaper on an l two, it makes sense to launch different products for different kind of users.
00:22:33.162 - 00:22:42.542, Speaker A: Got it. So is it faster too? Are they faster if you stay inside leaving, like, finality on the l one aside? Is throughput higher?
00:22:42.676 - 00:22:50.942, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, that's one of my favorite parts about actually using L two s is that the transaction confirmations that you're getting are just so much faster.
00:22:51.006 - 00:23:03.190, Speaker A: Okay. So that opens up other use cases then, I guess. What about, like, wasn't Reddit doing something with arbitrum? Like one of their, Reddit has what they're like, they don't call them nfts, but they're like their collectible badges or whatever.
00:23:03.260 - 00:23:04.390, Speaker C: They're community points.
00:23:04.460 - 00:23:06.680, Speaker A: Community points, yeah, that's right.
00:23:07.390 - 00:23:07.706, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:23:07.728 - 00:23:12.540, Speaker C: Arbitrum, Nova is Arbitrum's dedicated gaming and social platform.
00:23:12.990 - 00:23:14.138, Speaker A: Also a roll up.
00:23:14.224 - 00:23:23.566, Speaker C: Yeah. It runs on the same tech stack, but just make some sacrifices along security to provide more, cheaper and faster experience.
00:23:23.668 - 00:23:24.142, Speaker A: Got it.
00:23:24.196 - 00:23:34.646, Speaker C: For games. Yeah. That successfully migrated over to Nova, I think, late August, maybe September.
00:23:34.778 - 00:23:35.314, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:23:35.432 - 00:23:36.626, Speaker C: Yeah, it's out there.
00:23:36.728 - 00:23:54.710, Speaker A: And when we think about the future of roll ups, because this is what this is really scaling. This is a scaling solution. Right. And unlike, say, a side chain, these are inexorably tethered to the l one. Right. Like they can't exist without an l one to publish to.
00:23:54.860 - 00:23:55.560, Speaker C: Right.
00:23:56.330 - 00:24:12.886, Speaker A: Whereas a side chain is kind of just like a blockchain of its own with its own validator set or depending on how it's run, consensus mechanism that sort of, like, I guess the way I think of it is a sidechain is its own blockchain, but it pledges fealty to another blockchain. Right. But it doesn't have to.
00:24:12.928 - 00:24:13.902, Speaker C: Heavy reliance on it.
00:24:13.956 - 00:24:30.580, Speaker A: Heavy reliance. Yeah. So like a polygon, the polygon main net. I mean, there's many polygon projects, including, I think, several ZK projects. But the main polygon that we know of, right, is a side chain on eth, but it could publish or peg in and out to something else if it wanted to, right?
00:24:31.030 - 00:24:39.510, Speaker C: Yeah. To be fair, all of the roll ups technically could spin off and become their own l ones.
00:24:39.660 - 00:25:01.840, Speaker A: Interesting, but. Okay, and then what about centralization on these things where I hear a lot about the sequencers aren't decentralized yet, right. These sequencers are the entities that actually roll up the transactions into a batch and post them on the l one. Theoretically, they're kind of like what? They're sort of like block producers basically. Are they decentralized today?
00:25:02.370 - 00:25:29.906, Speaker C: Absolutely not. I mean, really, all the sequencers are run centrally by the operating team at this point. And to be fair, sequencing sounds like it is like a pretty technical challenge. But for optimism, they're taking the approach that all the revenue that is generated by the sequencer, they're committing back to the community to fund different grants programs.
00:25:30.018 - 00:25:35.506, Speaker A: But there's got to be plans to try to decentralize that over time, right? In some way, or at least ideas.
00:25:35.538 - 00:25:54.030, Speaker C: To do it eventually. Yeah, like arbitrum is a little more ahead because they added a couple other validators, different providers, also big centralized entities, but they do have a whole slate of validators that could hop in.
00:25:54.100 - 00:26:45.920, Speaker A: Got it. And then what happens if ZK roll ups come out, I think in earnest, and let's say the market says they're definitely better overall than optimistic ones. Theoretically, is this like a market share game? Like optimistic works today, so you grow so big, will they stay big even if technically a better solution comes out? But TCPIP wasn't like, theoretically. It's not theoretically the best way to do Internet packet exchange. But it won, right? It's good enough and it's a technical standard. Do you think that's what happens with optimistic? Or do they end up having to themselves turn into zkrs? Or do zkrs overtake optimism and arbitram? Like, how do you think that plays out if we assume that ZKR technology works and is good?
00:26:48.290 - 00:27:55.940, Speaker C: Well, all the roll ups today, all the optimistic roll ups, they do have a call option to convert to a ZK roll up at some point. But even if ZK roll ups come out and technology is the exact same or even better, it's going to have to be like five to ten times better than optimistic roll ups on the usability side, like technology could be way better. But if you actually want to migrate users over from optimistics to ZK, then technology or the usability has to get there. And right now, I don't think too many of them have Metamask support. A lot of them require different wallet types that people are unfamiliar with. And so you'll have your early adopters, the people that are really interested in the different types of technologies available by ZK rollups. But if you want to win over from optimistic rollups, a, you're going to have to see a lot more adoption before things get more economical, and b, you're going to have to play the marketing game against them.
00:27:56.390 - 00:27:57.186, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:27:57.368 - 00:27:59.814, Speaker C: Launch some incentives or something to get.
00:27:59.852 - 00:28:04.390, Speaker A: People so the optimistic ones could be sticky because they've got all these users and stuff is happening.
00:28:04.540 - 00:28:19.850, Speaker C: Yeah, I'd say so. And one thing that really surprised me about these two, optimism and arbitrum. It seems like all the different growth initiatives launched between the two. Arbitrum had their own Galaxy campaign.
00:28:20.350 - 00:28:21.802, Speaker A: Not related to us.
00:28:21.856 - 00:28:52.514, Speaker C: Yep, not related. Optimism had their token launched. They had their ecosystem fun. They launched their own galaxy initiative just to get people trying different applications and using the chain. All the growth has really been symbiotic between the two. Anytime you see a spike in usage on one chain, you'll see it on the other, even though some of these initiatives are one sided. So users are interested and it's super easy to switch between the two networks.
00:28:52.514 - 00:28:55.800, Speaker C: And yeah, I'm here for it.
00:28:56.250 - 00:29:19.386, Speaker A: Charles Yu from Galaxy Research. Thank you so much, Chuck. Quick break for our listeners. There's a poll posted to our Twitter handle at GLXY Research. Check it out. The question is, if or when zero knowledge roll ups, particularly ZKe evms, launch on Ethereum, what happens to optimistic roll ups, arbitram and optimism? One, they lose market share to zkrs. Two, they keep market share because they're sticky.
00:29:19.386 - 00:29:38.502, Speaker A: Three, they grow their share because they have a head start, they're easy to use, or four, they themselves convert to zero knowledge rollups. Hit us up on Twitter. Make your voice heard. Now let's get to the show. We're going to talk with Saul Kadir from Galaxy Research about Solana. Welcome, Saul Kadir from the Galaxy research team. How are you doing? Great to have you back.
00:29:38.636 - 00:29:40.310, Speaker D: Great to be here. Doing well.
00:29:40.460 - 00:30:03.806, Speaker A: It's been a really interesting start to the year in crypto. A lot of positive price action. Bitcoin and ETH are up like 30% year to date. I was saying year to date, we're doing great. But I want to talk to you specifically about two topics which you cover very closely, specifically Solana and NFTs. In general. But I know the stories are a little bit intertwined as well.
00:30:03.806 - 00:30:16.658, Speaker A: But first, let's talk about Solana. And a lot of people were very down on Solana following FTX's blow up collapse, or whatever we want to call it, the FTX saga. Why?
00:30:16.824 - 00:30:17.538, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:30:17.704 - 00:30:21.710, Speaker A: What was the intertwining nature? What's the relationship between Solana and FTX?
00:30:21.870 - 00:30:46.086, Speaker D: It's a great question. I think there's kind of two schools of thought about it, what the perception was in public and what the relationship was in reality. And the perception was that FTX was really tight with Solana. They were very coupled with the ecosystem. They traded the Solana perps. They had a bunch of coins on the exchange. They were investors in a variety of Solana projects, both FTX and Alameda.
00:30:46.086 - 00:31:18.406, Speaker D: And so perception wise, a lot of people assumed, oh, if FTX is going down, that means Solana is going down, because they're like a big steward of their ecosystem. In reality, though, it's a little bit more nuanced. And I think a lot of people kind of miss this. Yes, FTX and SBF in particular were important early on in Solana's growth and development. And really, it comes down to serum, the invention of serum that was created by FTX, kind of devoting about five or so engineers to build it out, which is what?
00:31:18.428 - 00:31:20.178, Speaker A: Like a decentralized exchange.
00:31:20.354 - 00:31:28.934, Speaker D: So serum is like a decentralized exchange, but the main innovation is they put the order book on chain. So on chain clob is what they call it.
00:31:28.972 - 00:31:31.842, Speaker A: Central limit order book. So not an amm?
00:31:31.906 - 00:31:32.966, Speaker D: Not an amm.
00:31:33.158 - 00:31:40.102, Speaker A: It should be like a dlob, a decentralized limit order book, but actually an order book. And I guess the idea was making use of Solana's high transaction throughput.
00:31:40.166 - 00:31:40.538, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:31:40.624 - 00:31:41.790, Speaker A: Actually made that possible.
00:31:41.940 - 00:32:07.334, Speaker D: Exactly. Right. It only could be built on something like Solana. And so early on, Solana labs and FTX kind of worked together to put out serum. And then in the first kind of year or so around that time, SPF would promote Solana on his personal Twitter account. All that engagement really started to trail off, though, and he hasn't really talked about it. One year prior to the FTX collapse, he barely even spoke of it.
00:32:07.334 - 00:32:17.718, Speaker D: And serum became its own self sustaining. You know, FTX still invest in Solana projects, but so did many other vcs, and nothing really unique about them there.
00:32:17.884 - 00:32:22.060, Speaker A: But they did have sole tokens. What are they called?
00:32:22.750 - 00:32:23.734, Speaker D: SPL tokens.
00:32:23.782 - 00:32:35.030, Speaker A: SPL tokens. So these are tokens that run on Solana and they were a key on an off ramp into those. Right. They were one of the only places that you could actually go from dollars directly to these Solana based tokens.
00:32:35.110 - 00:32:35.414, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:32:35.472 - 00:32:49.810, Speaker A: Whereas there are plenty of places to buy Solana, but you'd have to theoretically go, like, Solana to then maybe a Solana Dex or something to get those other. So, like there was a liquidity provision provided by FTX that was probably helpful for growth.
00:32:50.310 - 00:33:18.554, Speaker D: Was nice. I guess it was nice to have infrastructure wise that on ramp into Solana. And even they had integrations with Solana wallets so you could deposit dollars and receive either USDC on Solana or a Solana token. But again, these types of things are now kind of being replaced already. Like Coinbase now already supports natively issued USDC on Solana and a few Solana tokens as well. I want to call it essential, but yeah, they're probably one of the first to do that.
00:33:18.592 - 00:33:36.426, Speaker A: And they also had some of the wrapped Solana tokens were like, was it the sole BTC was actually alameda. Right. So that's more of an acute thing. But that obviously didn't go mean. Their collapse meant that those tokens basically collapsed.
00:33:36.538 - 00:33:45.838, Speaker D: The tokens collapsed. But I guess the good news is those products. So the wrapped eTH and the wrapped bitcoin on Solana weren't very popular to begin with. They weren't that big market cap wise.
00:33:45.854 - 00:33:46.034, Speaker A: Right.
00:33:46.072 - 00:33:50.470, Speaker D: It wasn't even that much. It was tens of millions of dollars. Again, not billions, not billions.
00:33:51.450 - 00:34:20.682, Speaker A: Okay, so, and obviously, Sam, like you said, had been a promoter, but he hadn't been. Right, actually. I mean, I don't recall him tweeting about Solana for quite a. That's the. I don't know if that's the extent of it, but that's a lot of where this Solana SBF FTX sort of tie up comes. Obviously, Solana. The market, I think, punished Solana in the weeks following FTX.
00:34:20.682 - 00:34:25.986, Speaker A: What is there, though, in Solana that keeps you excited about it today?
00:34:26.088 - 00:35:18.500, Speaker D: Yes, and a lot of things excite me about Solana. I think it really boils down to this. They already have a lot of people using the blockchain and their scaling approach, to me at least, it makes a ton of sense. And this scaling approach has been done in other industries that have nothing to do with blockchain, which is relying on hardware and not necessarily doing a very convoluted approach of layers or modularity. They kind of make two bets. One, they could improve the protocol itself, which is what the Solana labs team is responsible for doing and what they have done at a very fast clip over the past year. But then the other side of this is that even if the labs team did nothing just over time, you're guaranteed to have performance increases in throughput because the hardware for the validators is at a high spec and hardware improves over time, especially gpus, which they use for parallelization of state changes.
00:35:18.500 - 00:36:01.966, Speaker D: That trend has already been happening in AI, and the chat GBT is kind of an example of this, where it's not that sophisticated of a model. You could watch a 1 hour YouTube lecture on how llms work. It's really about them scaling it to a ton of hardware, spending tens of millions of dollars on hardware to train those models. That's why it's so impressive. So when you look at kind of what's happened in other industries, it seems logical to assume that this approach Solana is taking with high spec validator hardware and relying on that to improve over time, you're kind of always going to improve over time, too. And I think that's kind of a brilliant approach that more hardware focused software developers like Anatolia Yakovanko would take.
00:36:02.068 - 00:36:17.778, Speaker A: Interesting. So a different approach. You talked about layers of modularity. It is a very convoluted. I chuckle. Not that it's bad. First of all, I have long term been a big layered scaling approach guy, but.
00:36:17.778 - 00:36:37.190, Speaker A: I chuckle. Vitalik's flowchart of east development. It's like, oh my God, the merge purge things like my head explodes. Just like I get a migraine looking at it. Yeah, again, no offense to that. I'm just saying there is a meaningfully differentiated approach to blockchain design happening with Solana. It's not an EVM clone.
00:36:37.190 - 00:37:09.266, Speaker A: In fact, it doesn't use the EVM at know. Let's be real. I mean, the way I've described it before is that layered scaling is actually bitcoin. And Ethereum's approach with bitcoin on a conservative end of that spectrum, and eth on a very accommodative side of that spectrum, literally redesigning some of the layer one to make it even better for layers. Right. With like protodank sharding and some of their roadmap. But Solana differentiated here not just the reliance on hardware, but also the focus on monolithic blockchain.
00:37:09.266 - 00:37:14.130, Speaker A: Yes, I think that makes it interesting just from a pure blockchain technology standpoint.
00:37:14.290 - 00:37:21.222, Speaker D: Absolutely it does. And I guess the big criticisms it's had historically downtime, the downtime and the outages.
00:37:21.286 - 00:37:21.946, Speaker A: Right? Right.
00:37:22.048 - 00:37:33.030, Speaker D: We got to talk about that for a sec. They seemingly have addressed these in a pretty, I think, interesting way, in a way that has worked so far, which is localized fee markets.
00:37:33.110 - 00:37:33.450, Speaker A: Right.
00:37:33.520 - 00:37:40.846, Speaker D: If you look at something like Solana compass and just look at transactions over time and when there's spikes in demand, like the bonk thing that happened.
00:37:40.948 - 00:37:43.610, Speaker A: Bonk. We're going to talk about that in a second. I got to ask you about Bonk.
00:37:43.690 - 00:37:55.778, Speaker D: The chain was able to handle all the traffic. And if you needed to get your transaction processed, you could, you just paid a little bit more in the fee. And even that premium you pay in fees is still lower than pretty much every single L2 out there.
00:37:55.864 - 00:38:18.806, Speaker A: So this was like, we've talked about this on prior episodes about Solana and the fee market problem and how this is one of the big value props for Solana has always been that the fees were extremely low or even nonexistent. But of course, then critics had said, well, fees are how you protect against civil resistance, how you make it civil resistant, how you prevent spam.
00:38:18.918 - 00:38:19.580, Speaker D: Yes.
00:38:20.990 - 00:38:48.630, Speaker A: And most of the times when it had gone down, it really sometimes was directly spam. Other times it was like a big drop, a big giant spike in activity. And we're like, oh, they just showed up to blockchain and they're here to fix it. They're going to have to add fees. But if they add fees, a genuine fee market, doesn't that undercut the whole thing? What is local fee market? What does that mean? That's not fees for all transactions.
00:38:48.970 - 00:38:54.440, Speaker D: So every transaction has a fee. The thing that makes Solana interesting is that the fees extremely small. It was like.
00:38:56.330 - 00:38:57.410, Speaker A: Was that fixed?
00:38:57.490 - 00:38:58.882, Speaker D: Yeah, it was basically fixed.
00:38:58.946 - 00:39:00.946, Speaker A: No fee market, but still a fee. Right.
00:39:00.988 - 00:39:32.818, Speaker D: And so what they did with this software change with fee markets is they allowed you to kind of pay a premium over that base fee to have your transaction prioritized. It's called a priority fee. And so if you had a very urgent transaction, you can express that urgency with an additional fee. But that additional fee is still very low. And I think this detail is very important. It gets lost on a lot of people who, you know, Solana capitulated and they added fee markets. Okay, they added fee markets, but they had so much headroom with how low the fee already was.
00:39:32.818 - 00:39:35.090, Speaker D: It's still the cheapest blockchain by far.
00:39:35.160 - 00:39:39.614, Speaker A: So is it, though, a fee market for all types of transactions or what's the local part of?
00:39:39.672 - 00:39:50.230, Speaker D: Right, right. So the local part just means, like, what is the kind of data you're trying to manipulate on chain. So if it's like an NFT mint, that would cost more than if it was a simple transfer from one to another.
00:39:50.300 - 00:39:57.146, Speaker A: They call the smart contracts, or whatever they call programs, right? Yes, Solana. So it's like a program by program fee market, is that the idea?
00:39:57.248 - 00:40:08.362, Speaker D: It's really just based on the amount of, they call it compute units that the transaction requires. Then if it requires more compute units, then you have to pay a higher premium over the base fee to get included.
00:40:08.426 - 00:40:12.266, Speaker A: It does sound like that you mentioned this, that they did kind of capitulate and add fee markets.
00:40:12.298 - 00:40:14.366, Speaker D: So here's the thing. They didn't add a mempool, though, and.
00:40:14.388 - 00:40:16.830, Speaker A: I think that's there's no queue.
00:40:16.910 - 00:40:17.614, Speaker D: There's no queue.
00:40:17.662 - 00:40:18.066, Speaker A: Right.
00:40:18.168 - 00:40:25.060, Speaker D: It's just reordering the transactions to get processed by the validators. And Solana doesn't believe that. Mempools scale. That's why they don't have one.
00:40:25.510 - 00:40:57.982, Speaker A: Okay, so you're right. That would be the full capitulation we mempool plus fee market, which would basically make it look like every other major blockchain that has something like that. So they haven't done that yet. But you must made the point, frankly, that, dude, if they have to, they could. The point here is like, why do it when they don't have to yet and they don't want to, but they can always do make changes. But you're saying this change has worked? Has there been downtime? When was last downtime? Like briefly this last summer, like six months ago.
00:40:58.036 - 00:41:14.418, Speaker D: And let's also remember the downtime from this past summer or fall. I forget the exact date. That had nothing to do with spam. That was kind of an obscure bug at the code of the validator. Yeah, that's been patched, and that'll also get reduced as more the validator clients get used. Like fired answer.
00:41:14.504 - 00:41:19.414, Speaker A: Right, which is the jump crypto client. They made a whole client right.
00:41:19.452 - 00:41:21.750, Speaker D: From scratch using c plus plus, I believe.
00:41:21.820 - 00:41:35.580, Speaker A: Interesting. Okay, this is very interesting. So we get it. You like the tech too. I mean, I'm interested in the tech differentiation here as well. It's the reason I think Solana is interesting. But let's talk about its adoption a little bit.
00:41:35.580 - 00:41:44.422, Speaker A: You're wearing a ute sweatshirt. Isn't this D labs? This is one of the most popular NFTs on Solana NFT collections.
00:41:44.486 - 00:41:44.954, Speaker D: Right, right.
00:41:44.992 - 00:41:50.254, Speaker A: But they moved, right? They got paid by Polygon to move to. Do we know that they got paid? Maybe. I don't know.
00:41:50.292 - 00:41:54.174, Speaker D: They confirmed it was a $3 million grant. Grant to dlabs, I believe.
00:41:54.212 - 00:41:55.440, Speaker A: So they're going to move?
00:41:55.810 - 00:41:56.126, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:41:56.148 - 00:41:58.350, Speaker A: They're planning to Polygon. They haven't yet, no.
00:41:58.420 - 00:41:59.874, Speaker D: So this is going to take a lot of work.
00:41:59.912 - 00:42:21.142, Speaker A: I know, and let's talk about that in a second. But step back for a minute, because the NFT markets on Salana are one of the most vibrant things on Salana. But also Salana is like, I think you had a chart recently in a report or in our newsletter, I can't recall, but that 12% of all NFT trading volume is on Salana, and that's the second behind eth.
00:42:21.206 - 00:42:25.334, Speaker D: Behind eth. And it's like three, four times more than the next challenger.
00:42:25.462 - 00:42:33.350, Speaker A: So Salana is a player as an l one in the NFT ecosystem. That's notable.
00:42:33.430 - 00:42:34.380, Speaker D: Oh, absolutely.
00:42:34.750 - 00:42:40.170, Speaker A: But utes, though, and d gods, that's the biggest collection. Right? And they're leaving.
00:42:40.250 - 00:43:05.298, Speaker D: They're leaving. So the story with that is Frank, who's the creator of dlabs, which manages d gods and utes. He's probably the most famous non ethereum NFT collection. I don't want to say owner, but like creator, I guess. And so he's very high ambitions, wants to challenge yuga labs. And so he sees the only place for growth is being on Ethereum and I guess ethereum adjacent, which is polygon. So d gods moving to Eth and utswol move to Polygon.
00:43:05.474 - 00:43:14.700, Speaker A: Oh, got it. D gods goes right to eth. L1 goes to main net. Yeah. Interesting. Does that harm the NFT story on Salana in general?
00:43:16.350 - 00:43:38.462, Speaker D: I would be lying if I didn't say it was bad. It's definitely bad. But it seems like, especially with what happened with bonk, that the NFT community in Solana is much bigger and more vibrant than these two collections. But it does beg the question, how will Polygon fare over time? Will eth be able to just kind of dominate NFTs?
00:43:38.526 - 00:43:54.818, Speaker A: Makes you wonder if you grow big enough on Tezos or Solana, which both have, is it sort of like training wheels, and then you become big and then you go to mean, and if so, it's not great for those other ecosystems. It's not inherently terrible.
00:43:54.914 - 00:43:55.638, Speaker D: I don't think so.
00:43:55.724 - 00:44:06.806, Speaker A: But it positions like a Solana or an Alt L1 as well. It solidifies them as an alt L1. Like I said, as training wheels, before you hit the big leaf, go to eth.
00:44:06.918 - 00:44:13.130, Speaker D: That is actually a pretty good analogy. And you're right, it's not just Salana like, now. Tezos generative artists are pretty big.
00:44:13.200 - 00:44:14.506, Speaker A: Pretty big market, very big.
00:44:14.528 - 00:44:20.234, Speaker D: I have a few of them, and they're beautiful and they're cheap. You can get them for like $10, like some really top collections.
00:44:20.282 - 00:44:20.878, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:44:21.044 - 00:44:26.298, Speaker D: They must be wondering, if I move to Eth, will I make more money? I mean, it's like the Eth premium that people talk about in NFT communities.
00:44:26.394 - 00:44:26.942, Speaker A: Right.
00:44:27.076 - 00:44:31.630, Speaker D: It makes you wonder, will everyone just eventually ditch once they hit escape velocity?
00:44:31.710 - 00:44:40.682, Speaker A: It makes you wonder. All right, bonk, before we run out of time here. So bonk was what? A dog coin, airdrop to NFT holders on so bonk.
00:44:40.766 - 00:45:01.962, Speaker D: It was created by a small team of developers, and they were upset with the decline in Salana post FTX. And so they said, hey, let's airdrop 50% of this meme coin to existing holders of Salana, NFTs, to artists that are exclusive to Salana, and to early community members and proponents and other stakeholders.
00:45:02.026 - 00:45:03.822, Speaker A: So everyone went on chain to collect it.
00:45:03.956 - 00:45:06.794, Speaker D: Yeah. And it generated a ton of excitement.
00:45:06.842 - 00:45:15.514, Speaker A: And activity on chain activity. It coincided, I think it was shortly after Vitalik had a favorable tweet about Solana.
00:45:15.562 - 00:45:15.982, Speaker D: That's right.
00:45:16.036 - 00:45:21.746, Speaker A: Saying, you know, like, I forget what it was. I don't know much about it, but seems like a lot of people like it and I'm rooting for them or something.
00:45:21.848 - 00:45:22.686, Speaker D: It was a positive tweet.
00:45:22.718 - 00:45:29.910, Speaker A: This positive tweet and sole activity and prices of Solana and the Solana ecosystem stuff rose on this.
00:45:29.980 - 00:45:30.310, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:45:30.380 - 00:45:35.400, Speaker A: Yeah. But then this is just a useless meme token, right? Like, there's no purpose to it.
00:45:36.010 - 00:45:44.966, Speaker D: Yeah. When they released it, the website was one page with a couple of buttons. Now, it's interesting. You say there's actually more on chain to do in bonk than there is in doge or shib.
00:45:44.998 - 00:46:01.306, Speaker A: What are they doing? Well, that's true. I mean, doge, let's be real. It's like a bitcoin litecoin fork. You can't really do anything with it. Shiva, who knows what going at she. Right. So it was 50% of the supply.
00:46:01.306 - 00:46:03.806, Speaker A: What's the story here? Where's the rest of the supply?
00:46:03.918 - 00:46:10.258, Speaker D: Yeah, 50% was airdropped and 50%. That's a good question. Exactly. Where?
00:46:10.344 - 00:46:14.638, Speaker A: Because I read maybe that the creators may have burned their allocation.
00:46:14.734 - 00:46:16.946, Speaker D: It's a very small. They only had 5%.
00:46:17.048 - 00:46:20.326, Speaker A: Yeah, but I think they may have burned it again. They did burn it.
00:46:20.348 - 00:46:28.258, Speaker D: They burned it. But people are also, remember, like, early participants, not the developers, have 20%. And that was not burned. So there's still a lot of insider holders.
00:46:28.354 - 00:46:32.306, Speaker A: Okay, so it's not a perfect, fair launch at all. It's not fair enough. Okay, that's what I was wondering.
00:46:32.338 - 00:46:35.050, Speaker D: There's a lot of criticisms early on for this exact reason now.
00:46:35.120 - 00:46:35.402, Speaker A: Right.
00:46:35.456 - 00:46:41.550, Speaker D: Granted, a lot of people made good returns on bonk. It went up a ton during that two week period. It's come down a lot.
00:46:41.700 - 00:47:18.886, Speaker A: Sure. Well, okay, very interesting. Like I said, when we talk about the blockchain, I think, again, from a blockchain technology standpoint, I really look at it as layers, monolithic, where Solana is the iconic player and is differentiated. And then I guess we would say, like, I don't know if it's maybe app chains, right? So you have like Cosmos and Avalanche and theoretically Polkadot and I'm not sure what others, but outside of that, layers, monolithic and app chain scaling. I don't really know of another. And maybe I don't know where we would put aptos and swee exactly in here at some point. Do they go into monolithic, by the way? Maybe.
00:47:19.068 - 00:47:22.946, Speaker D: Yeah, they're monolithic. But very different flavor, right?
00:47:22.988 - 00:47:36.250, Speaker A: Different tech, but maybe it goes in a monolithic bucket. But thanks for giving us the update, Saul, on Solana. And we'll also have you back. There's a lot more to talk about in the NFT world. I know you're working on some new research, so we'll get you back on there to talk about NFTs generally.
