00:00:10.000 - 00:00:27.326, Speaker A: Welcome back to the infinite Jungle. On today's show, I have with me two very special guests. The first is Chris Perkins, managing partner and president at Coinfund. And we also have Andy Baer, the head of product at Coindesk Indices. Thank you so much for being on the show. Chris and Andy, thanks for having us on.
00:00:27.398 - 00:00:27.934, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:00:28.022 - 00:01:45.504, Speaker A: We are going to be talking about market infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem and primarily the Caesar staking. We're going to talk more about the Caesar product, which tracks how much rewards validators on Ethereum are earning. But before we get started with the show, here is a quick show disclaimer. I need to remind you to please refer to the disclaimer linked in the podcast show notes, and note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice, an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. So, Chris and Andy, I'm very excited to talk with you guys because this conversation is something that I expect to be very different from our prior shows, which has focused primarily on the technology and other crypto native products that are being built in the Ethereum ecosystem. But this is a product, the Caesar product I'm talking about is a product, really for institutions and something built that is more akin to traditional finance products. So I'd love to get a better understanding of the utility of Caesar, what the innovation behind it is, and why you thought it was important to build something like Caesar.
00:01:45.592 - 00:02:19.392, Speaker C: Maybe I'll start with how it came to pass. And so, well, well, before the merge, we were talking on our morning meeting at Coin fund, and we're an investment firm, and I'm like, hey, when Ethereum moves from proof of work to proof of stake, we're going to have a risk free rate for Ethereum. And I don't want to call anything risk free, but that was the conversation that was had. But the fundamental piece of it was like, well, we're going to have this baseline rate. And if you think about traditional finance, where I come from, the world evolves around rates. Generally, those rates were centralized and controlled. You turn on Bloomberg in the morning, that's all they talk about.
00:02:19.392 - 00:02:52.994, Speaker C: They don't talk about companies. And I was like, wow, for the first time we're going to have this decentralized rate. Now, if we can create social consensus around a standard observation, that's going to unlock something magical. Why? Because if, again, based on our experience in traditional finance, interest rate swaps alone are a $500 trillion market, because they provide an incredible amount of utility, they introduce fixed rates and other things. So with that in mind, grabbed my computer scientist and I said, guys, we have to build this. I said, well, is anyone building this? I said, no, no one's even thinking about this. I said, well, we got to build it.
00:02:52.994 - 00:03:21.364, Speaker C: And they came back a few hours later. We know how to do it. And all Caesar is, again, we try to capture a baseline rate. So if you're not doing anything else, this is the rate that you should probably be achieving. And it's really what it is. We look across those validators, all the validators that are eligible, and we capture the emissions and the transaction fees or tips that they receive. We take that and we look at the mean annualized return, and we produce it every day with our friends at Coindesk indices.
00:03:21.364 - 00:03:23.164, Speaker C: So, Andy, maybe you want to pick it up.
00:03:23.332 - 00:04:12.680, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. This is one of these great examples where there was fantastic innovation in the crypto native side and fantastic innovation on the expats of the traditional finance world trying to rebuild a financial structure. And those two rivers started to merge to the point where you have a rewards rate which is going to be useful for risk transfer or for benchmarking, and then you have a traditional finance kind of stream which comes in and says, well, this is how robust we need it to be to be as a benchmark or to be as a settlement rate. And this is what Chris and the folks at Coin fund identified. And we were very pleased to be able to sort of put this into a hardened up methodology and offer it in a way so that many different marketplace participants can use it for those purposes.
00:04:13.060 - 00:05:17.680, Speaker A: So I'm going to push back a little bit here because I'm still not quite understanding why I, the understanding, I guess, what the issuance, the emissions of what the network is giving, and also the validator tips. Isn't this all data that you can publicly gather from the blockchain? Many providers also share it from the beginning of the Ethereum, since it merged, to proof of stake. You have websites that track it on an extremely granular basis on almost like a block by block basis. You can have MeV added to it if you wanted to. You can simulate how many rewards you would get if you ran this many validators on this type of hardware. What kind of users are really needing something like Caesar that gives it to you on a daily basis? And that also kind of relies on the simplest methodology for trying to calculate these rates. Because as I understand, this is a tool that anybody can really build.
00:05:17.680 - 00:05:21.356, Speaker A: Why is Caesar so important?
00:05:21.428 - 00:06:03.044, Speaker B: A couple of things Chris mentioned, consensus, which is critical, right? Everybody has to agree on the same calculation. You could think about the same conundrum for interest rates in the traditional finance, in the fiat world, right? There are a lot of borrowing and lending rates, and there's a lot of different observables. And I'm going to look at this note, but not that note, but there's consensus over what gets used to benchmark rate yield performance and what settles derivative contracts. So consensus is important. The other is methodology. We run into a lot of folks who say, I don't really need an index, I can calculate this myself. But having a methodology driven process that's transparent and that has governance is really what the core of indexing is about.
00:06:03.044 - 00:06:52.020, Speaker B: It changes this idea from, yeah, this is a reward rate and I can calculate it and parse it, but it's not something that you're going to put into a financial contract. It's not something that if you have an institutional fund that offers stake deeth that your institutional investor is going to be able to drill down into a methodology, see how the calculation is, see what the governance engine around that is. It's a very similar problem in traditional finance as in digital assets, to harden up a rate, get consensus around it, and make it so that it becomes broadly acceptable. Once it's broadly acceptable, investors accept that as a benchmark and market participants easily accept it as a settlement rate for transactions. So that achieves our sort of dual goals of liquidity and sort of adoption and assets under management.
00:06:52.640 - 00:07:20.752, Speaker C: Maybe. I'll add, I'm an old naval officer and I almost think of it like containerized shipping, right? For years, people would bespokely, I'm sorry, would bespokely pack ships. And then all of a sudden they're like, wait a second. If we standardize the box, we can ship a heck of a lot more. And you can't unlock a lot of institutional products like derivatives if you don't have social consensus around a standardized observation. And so like, yeah, anyone can do it. I think the methodology that we put, like, there's no secrets here, right? No, we publish it all.
00:07:20.752 - 00:07:47.380, Speaker C: We're all very public in the methodology. We've received feedback on the methodology, but I think the methodology that we've tried to adhere to is one of a baseline rate, right. When you start throwing in additional mev factors or whatever, there's maybe some discretion. Again, we're trying to solve for something that's very simple, very basic, and that can unlock product development and next generation things like derivatives. Or benchmark total return products.
00:07:47.760 - 00:08:39.324, Speaker A: Okay, let's talk a little bit about some of those products because I think that will help me understand kind of where the Caesar index is being used. Because in my mind, these kinds of products, they should have a node themselves or should build in these calculations. It's not that difficult of a calculation to really integrate into their products, to have it auto calculating, say, every block or every day and averaging out in whatever cadence or methodology they want. Tell me a little bit about how since the launch of the Caesar product, where have you guys been seeing the, the rate being used and what products have been building, being built off of it? Have you noticed some interesting kind of ways in which appetite, in which institutions have been asking for something like this?
00:08:39.372 - 00:08:39.892, Speaker B: I'll start.
00:08:39.956 - 00:09:27.246, Speaker C: I'll start. So we provide a ton of utility, and I think a great use case is maybe the validator use case. So if you go to a protocol today, you say, what's my rate? They say, well, you get what I get, and I take 10%. That's a pretty brutal business model, because as institutions come on, they're going to be like, wait a second, you need to perform. And that 10%, it's kind of rich. And I come from futures markets where those goes to pennies, right? Perhaps a different way to offer this product would be to say, well, wait a second, I'm going to pay you the benchmark. And if I outperform that benchmark, and what we've seen is a lot of top institutional validators, they will outperform the benchmark by like 30 bps or so, depending on the validator, because they can earn extra mev and they outperform that mean annualized.
00:09:27.246 - 00:09:57.450, Speaker C: All those different validators, right? So it actually provides that end user also transparency. Hey, what's my rate? I'm going to get a rate calculated by a third party. So you provide that transparency, you take it the next step. You know, validators today, what is their revenue? They have no idea, right? Because the rewards are fluctuating with the rate. So one of the basic things they can do is they can manage the risk. And that is how we introduce interest rate swaps or staking rate swaps. Caesar swaps, we call them.
00:09:57.450 - 00:10:14.370, Speaker C: This is again, a $500 trillion tradfi market. Why? Because if I'm outperforming Caesar, I can pay the floating rate to a market maker and I can receive a fixed rate for a period of time. Now, I know exactly what my revenue is going to be, and I can run an efficient business model.
00:10:15.070 - 00:10:29.638, Speaker A: Question about that. Yes, if 90% of validators on Ethereum are running mev boost software, which means they are earning MEV and outperforming the benchmark by a certain amount, how does that impact the viability of some of these products?
00:10:29.734 - 00:11:22.766, Speaker B: The key is for the benchmark to be transparent. And there was a very specific reason why the MEV question was a big consideration in US building the benchmark. But you have to have a floor, right? You have to. In the rates world, you have a risk free rate, you may have a credit spread, you may have other types of spread on top of that basic risk free rate, but you have a risk free rate that everybody agrees on that you can write a contract against. Chris's point is an important one, that a validator who is receiving kind of this variable stream of income, that they may expect a certain amount of number of spikes during a year like the one we had over last weekend, but if they don't get them, then they're kind of underperforming versus this fixed investment they have in their validating nodes. For every 32 eth I put in a node, I have a return expectation based on a certain fluctuation of my staking rewards. If I don't achieve that, I've underperformed.
00:11:22.766 - 00:11:59.004, Speaker B: So I have volatility around this against this fixed investment leg. If I can find somebody who will take that risk, that volatility risk, and pay me a fixed rate in return, now I know exactly how much I'm going to make. I may pay a little risk premium away to achieve that benefit. This is exactly how the interest rate swap market works, right? When companies finance, they might finance with a floating rate instrument, but they may say, you know what, I want to lock in my financing costs for the next five years. So I'm going to swap that floating rate for a fixed rate. Now I know, now I don't have any concerns anymore. I know exactly what's going to happen.
00:11:59.004 - 00:12:34.022, Speaker B: So the fact that the benchmark isn't what an immaculate, perfect validator would achieve, or an imperfect one, that's not the objective. The objective is what would an average validator receive if they just take into account their consensus rewards and their prior transaction fees. Everything gets built on top of that. So the fluctuation versus a fixed in a risk transfer trade, or just a benchmark against which an investor can say, ah, they achieve this, plus, okay, that's acceptable.
00:12:34.126 - 00:13:05.738, Speaker C: I want to unpack a little bit with Andy said at the end, no one ever says you have to price at the benchmark. Right. The benchmark is a common point of departure. If you think you're going to outperform, you can always price relative to that benchmark, plus or minus. The other thing that's pretty interesting, as we started looking at the data, is that right now, Caesar, which is that mean annualized return, is tracking Lido very closely, whereas Lido, you get what you get, and they take that 10%. It's really interesting that those rates are very similar. We can send you some data on it right now.
00:13:05.874 - 00:14:05.722, Speaker A: I was going to mention, actually, Lido, because when you were talking about the variability in the fees and the rates, that is really why I think pools on Ethereum, staking pools have been gaining so much attraction and so much adoption, because they take the variability of your staking rate, which is still variable even without MEV, because of the priority fees. And they make it so that you, as a validator and the returns that you are getting are kind of averaged out for everyone over time. So, given the trend of many kind of people that are staking, likely to be staking in an increasing rate through pools, and the variability all kind of decreasing over time because of the pool mechanisms and dynamics, do you think that the benchmark will also have to incorporate, like, evolve to address the fact that many people's staking rates are including, it's not like a variable.
00:14:05.786 - 00:14:06.510, Speaker B: No, no, no.
00:14:07.410 - 00:14:09.002, Speaker A: They have the MEV all included.
00:14:09.026 - 00:14:50.252, Speaker B: The Caesar calculation looks at all million plus validators, and very specifically, what it does is it looks at their current balance at the beginning of the period and their current balance at the end, and just looks at their holding period return from receiving consensus rewards during that period. So a validator who kicked the plug on his machine and gets penalized included. A validator who withdraws included. A validator who gets slashed included. As long as they're active, they are included. The tips are averaged across the entire validator pool. So, as you point out, it's important to look at a population result when creating a benchmark.
00:14:50.252 - 00:15:30.846, Speaker B: You don't want to look at an isolated, impeccable validator or an imperfect validator. You want a population result. So Lido does a good job of that by virtue of just having so many validators, but they're not every validator. So Caesar captures everyone and just looks at those two things which are really revenues or rewards that come directly from the network, the consensus rewards and the priority transaction fees. I agree with you. That's the nature of a good benchmark. That's the yardstick against which a stake Deeth fund would want to be measured from the investor's point of view.
00:15:30.846 - 00:16:02.870, Speaker B: If I say I'm launching a private stake Deeth fund, I want to attract high quality institutional investors. Your ETH is safe. Plus I'm staking it. And here's the benchmark for the yield I'm expecting to provide you for my staking activities here you can look at this methodology to see why this yield is legitimate. Then the investor is going to go, great, that looks like all my other investments where I have an asset, I have a utility yield on top of that, and the utility yield is measurable against a benchmark. Perfect.
00:16:03.410 - 00:16:47.792, Speaker C: So Andy said something really interesting. He unpacked another really nice way that you can utilize the index, and that's in the total return product. So as institutions are now looking at Ethereum, they're like, wait a second, this is an asset with a stable supply, but it also has utility, and then it has this thing called yield. And one of the interesting things is that the ETF's out of the gate, do not have that yield. So they deprive investors of one of the greatest properties from an investment perspective. But again, when you start talking to institutions, they say, well, what's the yield? And Caesar offers them a baseline, a point of departure, to say, listen, we can write you a total return swap. So you don't want to figure out custody, you don't want to figure out those operations, you don't want to get hacked.
00:16:47.792 - 00:17:20.570, Speaker C: It's all confusing for you, Mister Tradfi guy. Well, what if we were to provide you a total return that references Caesar as that, as that yield? The other thing, like when you start really unpacking other institutional applications, like what about insurance? You hear about insurance on slashing, what about insurance on lost rewards? What's the rate? And so these are the types of things. Again, rates and benchmarks like this are everywhere in finance. And we're offering a suggestion, a benchmark that we think people can probably use.
00:17:21.319 - 00:18:43.490, Speaker B: I'm a big fan of this show, and I listen to it and I learn about things that I wish I had more time to spend on about upcoming changes to how the network works and changing the validator node size and bonding and unbonding efficiencies and how those can be packaged and resold in a risk way, and many, many more deeper things than this. And people who are really in the weeds, listeners who are listening to this conversation may think, oh, well, it's tourist season in ethereum, right? We're having the tradfi guys come in and see how they're using all these things that we built and try to apply them. It's, I think, in defense of our being here today. It's important for adoption for these users to be able to have some familiarity with a rate and know how to digest it. And rather than sort of explain, explain, explain to an institutional investor, this is why you should just take the rate as it is and not ask too much any questions. Putting some familiar market structure around it so that they can use it for benchmarking, so we can start to create more lending and trading and risk transfer activities in the sort of the half and half crypto native and traditional derivatives market. Create liquidity there, create lending.
00:18:43.490 - 00:19:07.040, Speaker B: That adoption is going to help. That just brings more people to the table. You need lending markets, you need trading markets, and you need risk transfer markets. You just definitely need those. Ethereum's a multi hundred billion dollar asset now. It deserves these pieces of market structure. So your earlier point about there are many great ways to measure the staking rate is totally valid.
00:19:07.040 - 00:19:38.842, Speaker B: One which bridges the gap, which can be familiar and usable right away by these new participants is important. And I think that's being both derivatives people, we've spent a lot of time adapting and trying to build liquidity, building those things, right, execution, lending, risk transfer, this is just another application of that. So it's hopefully something that your normal audience will not be eye rolling too much about and will sort of appreciate as bringing fresh money to the table.
00:19:38.946 - 00:19:48.290, Speaker C: And I think it helps contribute to the health of the ecosystem. Validators love this rate because it helps them manage the risk and be much more robust from a business perspective.
00:19:48.750 - 00:21:13.180, Speaker A: I hear, you guys, that the packaging of this product is something that is probably a lot more palatable to institutions and traditional finance actors in a way that I definitely do not have the expertise to truly understand the details of. But I appreciate the, I'm starting to see a lot more and learn more about the intricacies of the Caesar product. But while I have you guys here too, and because most of my guests, they don't have the finger on the pulse for what institutions want and what institutions are looking for, I'd love to spend a little bit the last couple minutes of our conversation talking about how institutional adoption looks for Eth. Because my biggest worry has been that the narrative around ETH has been very confusing, even for somebody that's crypto native. I can't imagine trying to go around selling the ETH ETF's to institutions of why they should be buying ETH curious to know how you guys have been seeing flows for the ETH ETF's. What have you guys been seeing in terms of the sentiment among institutions, looking at how obviously ETH BTC as a ratio has been trending down quite a bit ever since the merge, and it hasn't been looking good, I guess, broadly in terms of crypto prices either. But in terms of institutional appetite, is there any really for, for Ethereum?
00:21:14.760 - 00:22:19.172, Speaker B: I'm very hopeful. Ethereum has a big head start because it has a futures market and that I think put it on the map in a way where I don't think it necessarily would have been, at least in the United States and at least in terms of support for the ETF. The launch of the ETF has been kind of a mixed bag, right? I think part of that is a large number of people are still trying to digest bitcoin and understand it as a macro asset and trying to integrate it into their everyday portfolios. Ethereum and Ether are completely different kind of story. Ethereum also has competition. And so I think that our kind of angle on this, rather than just hopefulness about Ethereum's, I guess, tenacity. And I think Chris and I both agree, like Ethereum is going to have huge tenacity, whether it ends up being the execution layer or the clearing layer or the whatever layer.
00:22:19.172 - 00:23:13.032, Speaker B: It's going to have an unchallenged role in decentralized finance, there's no doubt about it. May it have to adjust its business model a little bit to adapt to that. I think probably all three of us agree that that's maybe something that happens. We like to think of a bigger group of assets and get investors involved in those so that they see the other layer ones and that they can start to judge Ethereum based on comparison to other layer ones rather than just comparing it to bitcoin. That in the longer term, that's why like a coin does 20 index which has nine layer ones in it, right? Lets people start to evaluate these things, apples to apples, and theyll say, oh, you know what, Ethereum is bigger than these other things. Its not just smaller than bitcoin, but its bigger than Solana, its bigger than the other layer ones. Its more important, it has better adoption.
00:23:13.032 - 00:23:27.560, Speaker B: Its definitely going to be a winner in one of the races. So on that basis I definitely want to stick with it. I think we want to try to create an educational pathway using a broader set of tokens rather than just stacking it up next to bitcoin every day.
00:23:28.260 - 00:23:57.686, Speaker C: Look, I feel really good. We're very impatient in our little industry where we think everything has to happen now. Morgan Stanley was the first wirehouse to really get approved to sell the bitcoin ETF. We were so early on this thing, and you really can't look at the interim noise. We don't even have ten years of historic look back data for Ethereum. A lot of institutions will require ten years of look back data so they can calibrate their risk models. But at the end of the day, I said this earlier, it's an asset with a stable supply utility and a yield.
00:23:57.686 - 00:24:30.048, Speaker C: And that yield, that real yield, blows away most treasuries. Right now, when you account for inflation, it's a very attractive yield. So it's early, right? And as time goes on, I feel really confident, and I think Andy's talked about this. Ethereum evolves, right? It is not a stagnant protocol, it evolves. And I think there's been a lot of thought, a lot of smart people, much smarter than me, who put a ton of thought into it, and it will continue to evolve to be a thing to do what it does. I'm excited about the future, frankly, Chris.
00:24:30.104 - 00:24:48.920, Speaker A: One thing I'm worried about in terms of the future is do you think institutions will balk at the idea that the Ethereum core developers can change the rates, can have in the past multiple times, changed issuance, and is considering to do it again?
00:24:49.000 - 00:24:49.560, Speaker C: It's a great question.
00:24:49.600 - 00:24:50.508, Speaker A: Is that something?
00:24:50.584 - 00:24:52.400, Speaker B: And they certainly don't think it's too low.
00:24:53.940 - 00:25:25.706, Speaker C: It's a really good question. I think the important thing there is transparency, transparency around governance. And it's a lot different than a couple of fed governors sitting in a room deciding what they want to do. So as long as it's transparent, thoughtful process where communities and token holders can weigh in, I think that's what's important. There's probably something in the middle that makes a lot of sense you don't want to have, and no offense to any other protocol, something that's just stagnant. I love the fact that it will evolve and I hope it stays transparent.
00:25:25.858 - 00:26:11.324, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with that sentiment. Ultimately, from an allocation point of view to a digital asset portfolio, people are going to select and allocate to Ethereum because they think it's going to win. They think it's going to grow. It's a growth asset. People, given that it's a growth asset in a competitive field, most rational investors are glad that there are people who are making these decisions. Unlike bitcoin, where there are no decisions to be made. Basically, the rate is too high if you feel that there are too many validators, that there is too much incentive to become a validator right now, and that's either unnecessary or unhealthy or creates problems.
00:26:11.324 - 00:26:48.472, Speaker B: Right. Ultimately, I don't think an investor is going to allocate to or not allocate to ether because the staking rate is 3.5% or 3% or 2.5%. It's just going to be part of the value proposition. It's critical though, when you're thinking about I want to borrow, I want to have a futures contract, I want to do an interest rate swap, that that rate is calculated properly. It's an attractive rate right now next to Treasuries, as Chris said, when you adjust for inflation. But I don't think that that's going to make or break the Ethereum investment case.
00:26:48.472 - 00:27:11.000, Speaker B: I think it's going to be something where a little bit of clarity, demystifying it, having a benchmark so that people have a sense how they can hang on to this rate and understand it better. That's going to satisfy that. And then people will say, okay, well, as we said before, Ethereum is going to win at least one of the battles as long as some smart decisions are made about how it evolves over time.
00:27:11.420 - 00:27:45.620, Speaker A: Sounds like you guys are both more educated than you let on about the core protocol, technical changes that are happening on Ethereum. So very impressed with the both of you. Another question on the topic of ETF's and institutional adoption. How soon can we expect staking rates to be added to the ETH ETF's? And do you think that in the interim that is what's going to cause very low inflows into the like, do institutions really care enough that that's really the deal breaker for, you know, what they want?
00:27:45.660 - 00:28:11.286, Speaker C: I don't see it as a deal breaker, but given the choice between a yielding asset and a non yielding asset, if it's the same thing you want the yielding asset, right. Why would you leave three to 4% on the table, especially if you're an institution from tradfi? Some of the challenges, by the way, staking is already live. It's live in Canada with the Ets. They allow you to stake 50%. And the reason for that is there's challenges around the bonding and unbonding. Right. So there is a queue.
00:28:11.286 - 00:28:36.792, Speaker C: The good news is that these types of issues have been addressed in the past in other markets, and there are a number of people who are working to solve for that. So if there's a redemption right, and you need eth, you can't wait eight days to get that eth out, right, or whatever the queue is at the time. And so the question is, how can you create that interim liquidity and incentivize people through economics to offer that contingent liquidity? Those are some of the challenges that.
00:28:36.816 - 00:29:16.858, Speaker B: Need to be solved for it's very peculiar. As Chris mentioned, Canada, it wasn't a light process for the ETF issuers to get regulatory approval to do this. And they had to think carefully about, you said this liquidity buffer. ETF's have to be liquid, and unstaking is not an instantaneously liquid process. So you need to make adjustments for that. So it becomes a novel thing. Now in Canada, the success of ETH ETs, which have been around for years now, as well as options on them, so they haven't gone up tenfold because there's half of a staking rate there.
00:29:16.858 - 00:30:13.538, Speaker B: I think it's. It is probably, I would guess, more of part of the educational process about the Ethereum investment case. As it is, I'm getting two or 3% on top of something. Why is that? The whole world is yield hungry, but now fiat yields are 5.5%. So if we'd been having this conversation when the staking, when 1559 and the merge were being contemplated and interest rates were zero, totally different conversation, right? 3% is basically a huge bag of cash in front of your front door every day. Now, there's competition for that too, but it is critical. One thing that's going to be a bad investor experience is if they consider an Ether ETF, and then they read a news story on coindesk or something that you write that says these don't have these yields in them, they feel like it's not a complete product yet.
00:30:13.538 - 00:30:29.590, Speaker B: So our regulatory out of stepness in the United States, with Canada and other places like even Hong Kong, which is considering adding staking yields to, is just kind of slowing stepping on the rope a little bit.
00:30:30.170 - 00:31:01.876, Speaker A: One last question, both for you, Andy and Chris. Looking ahead for this year, we've got the ETH ETF approvals. We had, you know, a presidential candidate like Trump talking about, you know, the promise of bitcoin. There's quite a bit of, obviously, milestones that have been reached this year. What is the next milestone for the industry that you guys are most excited to see and think will be reached over the next, say, like six to twelve months when it comes to institutional adoption of I have my answer.
00:31:01.948 - 00:31:02.804, Speaker C: I have my answer.
00:31:02.932 - 00:31:03.960, Speaker B: What's your answer?
00:31:04.830 - 00:31:29.166, Speaker C: We've seen a ton of regulatory de risking. So the next big milestones and unlocks for institutional adoption will be the stablecoin bill and also market structure bill. Institutions care about two things, right? Actually, they don't want to take two types of risks. They don't want to take regulatory risk, and they don't want to take operational risk. Right. Think of the operational risk I'll also throw in there, like things like hacking. That all goes into the operational risk bucket.
00:31:29.166 - 00:31:57.298, Speaker C: Why are ETF's so appealing? Because you essentially take those off the table. You know how they're regulated, you know how they're protected. And operationally, it's just like any other equity, right. Once we have good laws in place and good statute, that will form the basis of that regulatory de risking, that will absolutely attract institutions. And we don't have to wait for that. It's already happening. We're seeing that clarity come in the courts, but that's really what the institutions want.
00:31:57.298 - 00:32:07.370, Speaker C: And then, of course, we're venture investors. We're investing in infrastructure all the time. That will help address those operational issues. But, yeah, it's very simple to me.
00:32:07.950 - 00:32:09.158, Speaker B: It'S just totally different.
00:32:09.254 - 00:32:10.870, Speaker A: Oh, is it different?
00:32:10.990 - 00:32:35.880, Speaker B: Totally different. More derivatives markets, options markets. You'll see that some of the ETF issuers, grayscale and BlackRock, filed for options on their ether ETF's. That's a long process. We need more. We need more liquidity in more forms available to more people. On the traditional side, having a liquidity triangle of, let's say, spot ETF's and futures is great.
00:32:35.880 - 00:33:29.108, Speaker B: But if you can throw in options and you can throw in perps, and then you can throw in a better deployed OTC market, you just have more flow, you have more risk transfer, you have more risk hedging ability, you have more investment outcomes that are possible. So Canada's had look on the canadian options exchange. There are several days where the bitcoin ETF options are the most liquid options in Canada, alongside all canadian equities. So there's demand out there, a lot of the derivatives flow and liquidity is offshore and not available to us institutions or to us persons. Right. Fixing that, I think, is going to unlock so much activity. And so it's not the kind of very headline y kind of adoption, like a new ETF launch ringing the bell in New York Stock Exchange by my brokerage account.
00:33:29.108 - 00:33:31.452, Speaker B: But it's going to be even more meaningful.
00:33:31.596 - 00:33:35.932, Speaker C: So Andy's right. But why is it offshore? Because we don't have the regs.
00:33:36.036 - 00:33:37.356, Speaker B: Yes, that's right.
00:33:37.548 - 00:33:38.588, Speaker A: Hand in hand.
00:33:38.764 - 00:33:40.012, Speaker C: So we're right. We're both right.
00:33:40.076 - 00:34:03.130, Speaker B: We're both right. I think we're both getting there. But we both want more trading more ways to get in. Not everybody is going to have their Ethereum in a wallet, and we just have to kind of accept that and realize that you do want those players who are getting involved and starting to contribute virtually via tradfi wrappers.
00:34:03.830 - 00:34:14.830, Speaker A: Fascinating. Well, thank you guys so much. You have given me a lot to think about, and I'm sure a lot for our listeners to think about, too. Thank you, Andy and Chris, for joining me on today's show. I hope.
00:34:14.950 - 00:34:15.694, Speaker C: Thank you so much.
00:34:15.742 - 00:34:40.070, Speaker A: Thank you, Christine. I hope everyone who is listening also I hope that you learned something new about Ethereum and specifically what the Ethereum ecosystem looks like and needs for more institutional adoption. I hope that you will join me again on another episode of the infinite Jungle. Until next time, stay safe out there, everyone.
