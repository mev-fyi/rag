00:00:00.240 - 00:00:42.644, Speaker A: I think the real big question to be continuing to ask is, is eos going to be included in Prague or not? And then on the consensus layer side, as I had mentioned during the last episode, are major items like inclusion lists and the increase to the maximum effective balance. Are these code changes going to be perhaps reconsidered or re included in Prague for reasons to do with kind of like how important they are to Ethereum security and how important they are to Ethereum censorship resistance? So still lots of open ended questions and and debates still to come for figuring out what the next upgrade on Ethereum after Dankoon is going to look like.
