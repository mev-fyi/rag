00:00:00.160 - 00:00:43.854, Speaker A: We call it digital gold because like gold, it's scarce. They're only 21 million bitcoin that'll ever be mine. You know, I tell everybody, you just start get off zero. You don't have to put a ton of money in, but buy something. So gold came from the gods, right? It was blessed by the Aztecs, the Incas, the Egyptians all thought it was this miracle metal, and they vested it with value. And over 3000 years, we started to believe gold had value. It's a social construct.
00:00:43.854 - 00:01:41.048, Speaker A: Bitcoin was created 13 years ago, so it's kind of a miracle that it's worth 600, $700 billion. We call it digital gold because like gold, it's scarce. There are only 21 million bitcoin that'll ever be mined. Now what's interesting is before bitcoin, you used to be able to just copy paste in computer. The genius of the innovation of Satoshi Nakamoto, who founded bitcoin, who wrote the great bitcoin white paper, was he created the first digital asset you could encounter fit. And so over 13 years, guys like me and lots of others have convinced people that this technology is real and that the social construct gives it value. Ethereum, which was designed by a guy named Vitalik Buterin, who's a boy genius and a lovely guy, looked at bitcoin and said, this is really cool, but I want to create a platform that I can actually build on top of.
00:01:41.048 - 00:02:29.084, Speaker A: And so the Ethereum blockchain is built with the idea of smart contracts in mind. And so where bitcoin, we can move value, Ethereum we can move anything. And so you're in essence moving whole businesses that you can build in code on top of it. So what Ethereum is trying to accomplish now is to be, I like to think of it as a decentralized global supercomputer that processes and authenticates all the data that's built on top of it. And so you can have things like NFTs or digital currencies, decentralized finance, all built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. That would be really, really hard to build on top of the bitcoin blockchain. It just wasn't built for that.
00:02:29.084 - 00:02:59.216, Speaker A: Decentralized finance is broadly using a blockchain and applying blockchain to what we would normally think of as financial services. So what's financial service? An exchange. So we have decentralized exchanges. When I say decentralized, I mean peer to peer. Instead of me trading with the New York Stock Exchange and meeting EVA on the New York Stock Exchange. I can trade directly with EvA or directly with you. That will be built on, most likely, the Ethereum blockchain.
00:02:59.216 - 00:03:23.358, Speaker A: But there are other competitors. Why is that so important? Well, think of all the people that work at the New York Stock Exchange. The decentralized version of that is just computer code. It's a company with no people, and so it's more efficient. Uniquely, it settles instantly. They call it atomic settlement, which means it settles instantly. When you buy a stock, it settles t plus two.
00:03:23.358 - 00:03:47.378, Speaker A: So there's credit risk. You've got to either put the money up in advance, or the person who's selling it to you gives you credit for two days. That creates risk. In DeFi, it's instant settlement. What's also really fascinating about it is it's transparent. Every single transaction you get to know about. So we had a mortgage crises in America in 2007, right? We had companies that had all these mortgages on their books.
00:03:47.378 - 00:04:17.504, Speaker A: You might have been lending money to those companies. You had no idea the risk they were taking. Again, in Defi, it's all out there, so anybody can audit what's being done or how much risk people have. And so one of the reasons I'm so certain Defi will win in the long run is it's just better. And usually better things win out over less better things. I love nfts. When I said bitcoin was the first digital asset you could encounter fit, that same technology works for anything.
00:04:17.504 - 00:05:00.954, Speaker A: So now we have the ability to create art that you can't counterfeit. And you're seeing this whole new generation of digitally native artists creating really cool stuff that are one of a kind or five of a kind, but they can limit and create scarcity of their work. It's a space that's just getting started. We're going to see digitally native artists use it. We're going to see famous non digitally native artists move to the digital medium. It's going to revolutionize the way intellectual property is monetized. We're having this collision between culture and community and commerce.
00:05:00.954 - 00:05:30.980, Speaker A: We never were able to monetize culture or monetize community. And now we can. We can create these tokens that around a community that we set up. We can create tokens around an artist. You know, the old fan clubs can be tokenized. And so it's a really, really early in the space, but it's a space that's just ready to explode. No, I don't think it's a bubble at all.
00:05:30.980 - 00:06:11.608, Speaker A: I think we had a bubble in 2017, and it crashed. And from that crash, you're developing a real industry. There's times markets get overvalued, and there are times markets will stay overvalued for long periods of time. But real bubbles are complete hype cycles, and this isn't a hype cycle. I see the world in five years being far more blockchain based. We are going to have central bank issued digital currencies, and so you're going to be in the transition from bank accounts to wallets on your phone. We're going to spend a lot more of our money in crypto dollars.
00:06:11.608 - 00:06:34.678, Speaker A: There'll probably be dollars or euros or renminbi. They probably won't be bitcoin, but they might be stable, you know, algorithmic stable coins. You're gonna have bitcoin accepted everywhere. And, you know, nfts are gonna be part of your dating profile. Someone's gonna like, Jimmy, let's check this guy's NFT collection out. Oh, yeah, I'll go out with him, like, right there. Social markers, just.
00:06:34.678 - 00:07:07.964, Speaker A: We always have social markers. This guy dripping in Gucci, or is he wearing keds? And we're gonna have new ways to. To look at the world. A lot of crypto people say, well, you know, it could go to zero. I just don't think it can go to zero. I don't think bitcoin could go to zero. These ecosystems are like religions, and there are enough people that have put enough blood, sweat and tears and belief system into this that they're never selling bitcoin.
00:07:07.964 - 00:07:44.184, Speaker A: Even if the government bans it, it'll go down. If the government says, we're going to arrest you, if you have bitcoin, it will go down, but it's not going to zero, because the whole idea of it was, we don't trust the center. Now, if our government would actually arrest someone for owning bitcoin, we're not going to trust our government. You're just not. All of a sudden now, we're in an authoritarian regime, so there's more reason you're going to want it. And so when I look at upside downside, zero is not my downside case. And so that bothers me, because even, like, crypto, people will say, well, it could always go to zero.
00:07:44.184 - 00:07:46.564, Speaker A: That was true probably five years ago. It's not true anymore.
