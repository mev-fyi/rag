00:00:00.200 - 00:00:22.430, Speaker A: What is actually happening at the intersection tangibly right now. And so the way I look at it is there's kind of like four categories I'm seeing emerge. So the first category is pretty boring. It's just like the traditional web. Two AI integrations we're seeing with the explosion of chat GPT. So using copilot to like ten x developer talent, using stuff like training. I see.
00:00:22.430 - 00:00:44.454, Speaker A: You mean like there's not a crypto integration with the AI, but like crypto developers could use it. Exactly. Got it. Yeah. So, you know, if you're a new DeFi protocol and you've got governance training a chachi so that it can, somebody can go in and use a chatbot to understand exactly how your government works, making it more accessible. So things like even like code review, right? Yep. Smart contract security and audit is a huge thing we're seeing right there.
00:00:44.454 - 00:00:57.614, Speaker A: So that, that is like where I think the bulk of the integration, you might say, is happening right now. But it's not specific to crypto, but it definitely benefits crypto. Sure. And then there's these three other categories that I think are really popping up and emerging.
