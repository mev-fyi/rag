00:00:12.654 - 00:00:47.404, Speaker B: Well, the problem is that you don't know what might be used against you in the future.

So much like how I had many aspects of my life that were public back then. I wasn't dreaming of the fact that someone might send a SWAT team to my house because I would become a prominent figure in a niche Twitter community. You never know what's going to happen.
