00:00:00.440 - 00:00:26.558, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firm wide research at Galaxy. Thank you for listening. We have a great show. No wrap intro this week, but we'll be back soon with some more. We do have a great guest, Will Nelly from Galaxy Ventures is joining us to talk about the current venture capital market. Is it back? I mean, my report at the end of last year showed that Q Four was still putting in new lows in terms of capital invested, but the energy feels different.
00:00:26.558 - 00:00:44.024, Speaker A: We're going to get Will's thoughts on this. Will's also a noted expert on the concept of block space and blockchains. And we'll have a fascinating conversation about how he thinks about block space as a consumer. Good. That's quite interesting. We'll also check with our good friend Bibnet, a. Bibi from Galaxy trading, as always, to discuss markets and macro.
