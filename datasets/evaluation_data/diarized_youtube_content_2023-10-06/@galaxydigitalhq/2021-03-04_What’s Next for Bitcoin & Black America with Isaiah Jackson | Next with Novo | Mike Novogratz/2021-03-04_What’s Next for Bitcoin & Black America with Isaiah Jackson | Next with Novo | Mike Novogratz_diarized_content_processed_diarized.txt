00:00:00.400 - 00:00:17.478, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. I'm Mike Novogratz, and this is next with Novo. Hey, friends. This is Mike Novograst. We're back with next with Novo. I've got Isaiah Jackson, author of Bitcoin in Black America, with me, a topic near and dear to my heart. Isaiah, welcome.
00:00:17.566 - 00:00:20.354, Speaker B: Thank you for having me, Mike, glad to be speaking with you finally.
00:00:20.734 - 00:00:28.296, Speaker A: Yes. So you're from Charlotte, North Carolina. How does a guy from Charlotte get into bitcoin and write a book about bitcoin and black America?
00:00:28.400 - 00:01:10.682, Speaker B: Well, it was actually kind of easy because Charlotte's a big banking city, and I've been known to do the exact opposite of what the crowd is doing. So in Charlotte, when everybody was talking about banking and bank of America's here, and Wells Fargo's here, and everybody's uncle, a cousin, is a banker, when bitcoin came around studying the financial system, I realized that didn't really matter. And, you know, I work better alone. So bitcoin seemed great to me. So everybody else who worked with banks without the banking industry was the end all, be all in Charlotte. That's sort of how I got the name bitcoins a, because I was this crazy guy running around in 2013 telling people twice my age that your advice doesn't matter because bitcoin is going to take over the world. You know, just kind of.
00:01:10.818 - 00:01:13.770, Speaker A: You were buying bitcoin down, like, at a $100 then, huh?
00:01:13.882 - 00:01:17.774, Speaker B: Yep. When I started in 2013, about 150. Yep.
00:01:17.954 - 00:01:22.674, Speaker A: So I started right before you then because I bought at 96 and 100. But that was pretty damn early.
00:01:24.014 - 00:01:32.598, Speaker B: Yeah, but, yeah, that's my Charlotte story. That's how. That's how you can learn about bitcoin in Charlotte. Just do the opposite of the crowd, and you'll get it.
00:01:32.726 - 00:01:42.114, Speaker A: I appreciate that. And so give me your bitcoin career. You started buying it yourself and traded and talking about it. And how does that. How's that evolved?
00:01:42.894 - 00:02:25.608, Speaker B: Yep. So I think a lot of people in the industry go through the same cycle. They learn about bitcoin, and then they see the money that can be made from it, and then they instantly jump into, hey, maybe I can make some money in altcoins. So for about a year and a half, two years, there did the altcoin trading mind litecoin, you know, just getting my feet wet around that time because I still had my, you know, day to day job. So I was doing that. And what happens is you realize that all coins are okay, but if you're not a full time trader, you don't really need to use them, or if you have a use case for it, that's not the same as bitcoin. So I took from that point and realized, you know, holding bitcoin as a savings mechanism or technology was a better way.
00:02:25.608 - 00:02:44.824, Speaker B: And from that point got to the point where I am now, where I realized that the biggest thing lacking was education. Bitcoin's technology hasn't changed since I've gotten into it, since me or you got into it. So it's still been working. It's just education and getting people to realize what they're actually buying or owning long term doing.
00:02:46.974 - 00:02:49.594, Speaker A: And so now. So you wrote this book. When did you write the book?
00:02:50.054 - 00:03:36.192, Speaker B: I wrote it in 2019 because I wanted, in my opinion, to make sure it was out before the May 2020 happening. And one big thing about that is the information I had, the reason I wrote it was to make it more efficient for black people to get the information about bitcoin. But I also wanted to time it so that anybody who read about it and would be able to invest in bitcoin would almost assuredly have, you know, large profits over time. Because historically speaking, after a halving event, the price of bitcoin goes through a bull run for about twelve to 18 months. So I timed it that way on purpose, and I put the book out so that people understood this is something that can help you and the people around you long term. And it's not a multi level marketing scheme, not a ponzi that was big in the black community. People thought it was all a scam.
00:03:36.192 - 00:03:42.376, Speaker B: I had my own family members who thought I was a drug dealer. Now, because I use bitcoin, because it was just mis education.
00:03:42.560 - 00:03:44.844, Speaker A: How did you buy your first couple bitcoin?
00:03:45.424 - 00:04:10.422, Speaker B: I actually did it through local bitcoins, peer to peer. I met a guy in front of a police station. Yeah, I only meet people two places. When I do or when I did peer to peer, it was in front of a police station or inside of a bank. And, you know, that was just the security reasons. Back then it was the wild west, you know, seedy people wearing hoods. You don't know who's showing up.
00:04:10.422 - 00:04:11.950, Speaker B: It was fun times, though.
00:04:12.022 - 00:04:20.374, Speaker A: So when did you finally move on to the legitimate, did you ever get Coinbase account? Or how do you transact in bitcoin at this point?
00:04:20.494 - 00:04:51.148, Speaker B: Yeah. So my first exchange that I ever used was Coinbase back in around 2015, had some unfortunate problems with Coinbase. Some of the ogs from back then got their account shut down, but it helped me realize how to use exchanges, how to buy it, how to send it, and also to that, you know, ownership of bitcoin yourself was important because you have to remember, no keys, no cheese. So if you don't own those private keys, you don't actually own bitcoin. So it was a gift and a curse. But Coinbase was the first and is the first for most people.
00:04:51.196 - 00:04:57.664, Speaker A: So and so. Now, if you wanted to buy more bitcoin or if you wanted to sell it, how would like, what are you set up on other exchanges?
00:04:58.044 - 00:05:22.754, Speaker B: So if I want to buy bitcoin now, I don't do it very often. Usually dollar cost, average through something like Swan bitcoin, just set it and forget it. So I don't really do hand to hand or peer to peer or use multiple exchanges. That's basically the only one. Most of the bitcoin now is through acquiring it, either through different ways, with foldapp, with lolly, or selling goods and services for bitcoin.
00:05:23.294 - 00:05:33.882, Speaker A: Awesome, awesome. And that original pile of bitcoins, you live off that. You actually spend a little here and there. You've bought yourself a car, a house, or do you just save it?
00:05:34.018 - 00:05:59.750, Speaker B: Just saving it. I've only sold maybe 5% of the bitcoin I've ever gotten because I believe in myself to make money outside of bitcoin. So it's just sitting there. It's a savings technology that is the key to winning in the bitcoin space. And 99.7% of people who hold bitcoin are in profit to this day. So that is a very winning strategy, winnable strategy.
00:05:59.750 - 00:06:01.394, Speaker B: So I just stick with somebody.
00:06:03.814 - 00:06:27.770, Speaker A: All right, so let's talk about the african american community a little bit. When I look on my Twitter following, first of all, the first thing I notice it's 85% male, 15% female. Listen, we got 13% African Americans in America, but we probably have 1% in crypto. And so how, how's your experience been reaching out to your community?
00:06:27.962 - 00:07:19.698, Speaker B: So, initially, the first thing I always describe to a black community is the current financial system. It's hard to think about the future if you don't know what you're dealing with now, because as soon as you explain bitcoin, the first thing they reason, the first thing they ask is, why do I need this? What does this mean to me? And my pitch to them is that over time, your wealth has been taken away from you very quietly through inflation, and bitcoin does the opposite. And before we can even talk about making money and investing and people doing all these different things, with financial instruments, the first thing you should be able to do is save the wealth that you have, which has been a problem in the black community for years. Things that we've acquired have been taken away from us. And, you know, I sort of use historical references like Black Wall street, how we built amazing communities, libraries, doctors, lawyers, all of these. These things. But they were brick and mortar, so they could be burned down.
00:07:19.698 - 00:07:38.784, Speaker B: Fortunately, you can't burn down bitcoin. So that is why I think the black community has a great chance to preserve their wealth with bitcoin. I start there, and then when they ask, how does it work? I basically explain it as a savings technology, and then they go from there. Bitcoin has a lot of niche spaces, but if you start there, they can find their way.
00:07:38.824 - 00:08:09.300, Speaker A: Yeah. Have you ever found a black brokerage firm or a. Like, if you're pitching to the black community and say, gotta go buy some bitcoin right now? Most when I'm pitching to new people, I say, you know, set up a Gemini account or a Coinbase account or a kraken account or someplace. What makes it easy to log in a blockfi account where you can log in, get Kyc, and buy it? Is there a. Is there. Are there any black businesses in crypto that you could send people to? And if not, should we start one, me and you?
00:08:09.412 - 00:08:35.292, Speaker B: Well, that's the thing. We're actually in talks now, and we can talk about this more, Mike, but we're in talks now because we said the same thing on Clubhouse. You know, we spend hours speaking, and all we're doing is sending people to cash app, to swan to, you know, different exchanges. Edge wallet, which is fine, but in the black community, if we don't have ownership, at the end of the day, we're just repeating what we had before digitally. So we are working on that. Actively, actually been working on that the last year, keeping it under wraps.
00:08:35.388 - 00:08:47.916, Speaker A: I'd be a 49% owner. That's kind of my philosophy. You know, listen, I. You know, for. You know, I do criminal justice reform, and you get into criminal justice reform, and it's a. It's really. It's a racial thing, right.
00:08:47.916 - 00:09:20.042, Speaker A: It's, you know, the black community has been screwed over for a long period of time. And so as you get in, you start unpeeling that the real key is not ended up in jail. And so it's education, preserving wealth in that whole nine yards. And so getting the black community into crypto in a smart way and not in a stupid way is certainly a goal I have that aligns with the values of galaxy, the values of my philanthropy. And so I'd love to talk to you about it.
00:09:20.098 - 00:09:27.570, Speaker B: That was our concern at the beginning, too, is, man, we're making everybody else rich. We're bringing all these people in. It's great. But I'm with you, Mike, and it's great timing.
00:09:27.682 - 00:09:36.734, Speaker A: Interesting. So is there a community that, you know, do you have your own community in Charlotte of five or six guys that you've done this with, or have you been a lone wolf?
00:09:37.394 - 00:09:58.346, Speaker B: So, yes, I do have a community here as well as in LA. I lived in LA the last three years, right before I just came back here. So by actually bicoastal. So I have people there. And in Charlotte, our community online with the gentleman of crypto daily show is pretty large. And with the book tour forming that community as well. But in person, I keep it pretty close to the chest.
00:09:58.346 - 00:10:01.970, Speaker B: Only about four or five people that I work with directly here and in LA.
00:10:02.082 - 00:10:09.934, Speaker A: Got it. And so what's your side hustle, Benz. You see, you said originally you had another job and you were doing bitcoin. Where did you spend that extra energy?
00:10:10.314 - 00:10:44.720, Speaker B: I first was a teacher, and then I got into the it world. So, you know, as a teacher, I was 23 teaching high school. When I started out as a teacher, I did it because I felt like I was good at it. And I have a family full of teachers, and I was fresh out of college, like I said, 23. And the way that you discover bitcoin is because most people get into it for the money. And the state that I was in is the second lowest paying state for teachers in the US, North Carolina. So the way I found bitcoin as a computer science teacher is I googled, how can I make money one night? And I just looked up different ways.
00:10:44.720 - 00:10:51.536, Speaker B: And then me and my roommates kicked around ideas, and one of my roommates said the word bitcoin, and I took it from there, and that was it.
00:10:51.600 - 00:11:05.524, Speaker A: I love it. I love it. Lots of ways into the. Into the space, but people seem to get sucked into the space once they're in it. And so that's why I kind of. I love the community organizing part of this whole ecosystem. It's just community after community after community.
00:11:08.124 - 00:11:46.248, Speaker B: And people like myself, who I learned from, the first black person I saw in crypto was Sinclair Skinner. He actually created the black blockchain conference. He's also the CEO of Bitmari Wallet, where they actually use bitcoin for Zimbabwe farmers as a portion of that. And, you know, Sinclair's who I first got started and introduced to, but from there, learned about Lamar Wilson, who he taught the first bitcoin class for Doctor Boyce Watkins. And Lamar Wilson has built companies in the bitcoin space and actually has his company's bitcoin in treasury as well, much like Galaxy. And, you know, he. He's a giant in the space on Clubhouse.
00:11:46.248 - 00:12:13.276, Speaker B: We have a lot of new people who came in, like 2017, 2018, but they've learned so much. I would consider them great in the space as well. Justin Redrick, known as bitcoin vegan. He actually is one of the people I work with in Charlotte directly. He got out of prison, had a felony, very hard to get into any other industry, jumped on with bitcoin, learned how to trade, learned how to mine now has educational courses on all of that. And I do want to throw in, you know, a couple of black women as well. Don't want to leave them out.
00:12:13.276 - 00:12:56.822, Speaker B: Naja Roberts, who's actually in Inglewood, California, first black woman to have a crypto lounge called crypto blockchain plug. She actually does over the counter sales for bitcoin, and she has a partnership with Ledger, so you can actually buy ledgers directly from her. And that's been great for the community to see black women in person teaching. Also, Tavania Evans, who created guap coins, she actually spoke after me on that clubhouse we were on, Mike. And, yeah, so these are some giants in the space, and they've been doing it for a long time. The problem is they're just now being known to the mainstream. So I think once people realize that, it'll be less of, you know, we're all black people and more of, oh, yeah, we've been here, and we have people we can use in our community.
00:12:56.998 - 00:13:17.454, Speaker A: Well, listen, we are 100% committed to increasing our diversity at galaxy. So, you know, anyone that you think would want to work here in New York City or actually, we got a bunch of different offices, Chicago, soon to be the west coast, have them send us our resumes. We certainly both on gender diversity and racial diversity. It's an uphill battle, but we're pushing hard.
00:13:17.534 - 00:13:23.358, Speaker B: Yeah, I got people in Chicago and New York. I can definitely reach out, see what we can come up with. I would love to also give that opportunity.
00:13:23.406 - 00:13:32.224, Speaker A: I appreciate that. All right, well, any. Any final thoughts? What do you want to ask me? Anything. Want to say anything to the audience.
00:13:32.804 - 00:14:00.524, Speaker B: So I did always want to ask you this, Mike, because I followed you for some time. What was the thinking when you first became a billionaire? Because myself, I want to be that one day as well and getting as close as possible. What was your thinking when you first got there? Like, was it I deserve this? Was it imposter syndrome? Was it, I'm rich? Just what was that feeling? Because the first million, you know, that's. People say it's always the best, but I'm trying to see what a billion feels like.
00:14:01.144 - 00:14:29.824, Speaker A: You pinch yourself and you laugh and you're like, really? Really? And you don't really believe because often you first make your big amount of money in equity. And equity is different than cash. So we had this company, fortress, and we went from being wealthy to 2 billion overnight, but it was mostly in stock value. So you're like, oh, my God, we're going to have to work so hard to make sure the stock actually is worth what the stock market says it is. And it. You get full of yourself for a little bit. You start walking around like, oh.
00:14:29.824 - 00:14:53.126, Speaker A: And then all of a sudden, you screw up and your brothers and sisters kind of bring you back to life, and they're like, you know, use the same toilet, jackass. And that wears off after a little while. But you do go through this little period where you're got a grandiose. You're full of yourself. You're like, oh, wow. Because you'd start thinking, oh, my goodness. What that actually means.
00:14:53.126 - 00:15:28.516, Speaker A: We're in this weird world now where you got Jeff Bezos at 180 billion, in musk at 200 billion. And those numbers just. They absolutely make no sense. It worries me, the medicine that the central banks keep giving the Sikh economy and the ministers of finance and the treasury departments keep giving the sikh economy are doing nothing but creating this wealth gap at an accelerating rate. And so one of the reasons I love bitcoin is it's a hedge versus this medicine. And even of good intention. Right? Joe Biden's coming up with good intention.
00:15:28.516 - 00:15:59.524, Speaker A: He wants to give everyone $600 extra. He wants to increase the unemployment insurance, all things that we probably should be doing, that's getting funded by printing dollars, which are accelerating asset growth. Bitcoin is one asset, and it is stealing from the other asset pools. It is stealing from gold, it is stealing from Tesla and other equities. But that whole asset pool is growing. The crypto community is about a trillion dollars, a little more than a trillion. If crypto didn't exist, that trillion would be spread out over all those other assets because the government's printing too many dollars.
00:15:59.524 - 00:16:53.634, Speaker A: Why? I think young people got in first is because even though if they were an economist and they didn't understand the government, there was an intuition that they knew that grandma and grandpa were stealing all the money that the baby boomers were printing so much because they wanted another hip replacement and they're living longer and they wanted healthcare. So we have this generation of baby boomers that have blown out deficits to the levels that will never get paid back. The only way you pay them back is inflated them away. And I think Gen Z and millennials have an intuition about that. And that's why they were the first buyers of crypto. It's cool, it's a social currency, but that's why I want young people, because they're going to need it. Young people to buy bitcoin and stick it away and not trade it.
00:16:53.634 - 00:17:46.034, Speaker A: The same thing you've been telling people it is to some degree an essential hedge against this debasement of currency, which is all happened by the old guys. Crypto is a direct assault or a direct response to that. Generations blowing out the deficit and spending too much on themselves and not investing enough in kids. And it's why I think it's important, especially for underserved communities, because what happens in hyperinflations is rich guys, we know how to zig and zag, and it's the middle class and below that sees their entire life savings wiped out like this in an inflation. It's why Venezuelans love crypto and Argentinians because they've seen it happen and it hasn't happened in the US. And so I really appreciate what you're doing. I want to stay in touch and, you know, develop a relationship with you and your community because I think it's important.
00:17:46.414 - 00:17:51.710, Speaker B: Absolutely. And I'm glad you brought up kids because I'm doing the same thing. Teaching a bitcoin summer camp this summer middle.
00:17:51.782 - 00:17:52.374, Speaker A: I love that.
00:17:52.454 - 00:18:05.994, Speaker B: So. Yep, definitely. I think that's a perfect pipeline of talent into our industry because it's some twelve year old kid that's going to eat our lunch. Mike, I've already come to terms with it. You should, too. But I want to be the one to teach that kid.
00:18:06.034 - 00:18:08.730, Speaker A: So, hey, tell me a little bit more about the summer camp you're doing.
00:18:08.842 - 00:18:43.826, Speaker B: Yes. So the summer camp will be a virtual summer camp for anybody around the nation. It's based in Charlotte, North Carolina, with a group called Innovative Learning, a 501 C three nonprofit that I'm a board member of. They do after schools and summer camps right now, but they are looking to broaden their horizons with a tech week and then bitcoin summer camp, which I'll be teaching for free. And I want to give the be able to teach whoever wants to learn about bitcoin middle school and high school for free. We're also offering that if you enroll your student, we will teach the adults for free as well. So just enroll, get just your kids learn.
00:18:43.826 - 00:18:52.258, Speaker B: Because if we're talking about generational wealth, there's no reason the kids should be able to learn about it. And their adults don't understand it either because it's good for everybody. So that will be taking place in June.
00:18:52.386 - 00:19:03.090, Speaker A: If you need a guest lecture, I'm volunteering for your class. So you've had a great run. You're writing books and got a big community following you. What's the future look like?
00:19:03.242 - 00:19:33.896, Speaker B: So the future is the bitcoin and black America book tour this year, the virtual summer camp as well. And nfts. That is probably the biggest space that I will be exploring this year. Art, music, you know, the ability to tokenize your work is great for our community. We have a lot of creative black artists in different areas, and I think nfts can impact us just as much as bitcoin long term. So that is my main focus outside of that this year going forward, that's.
00:19:33.920 - 00:20:11.100, Speaker A: Another thing we potentially could work together. I'm 100% believer in the NFT market. Anybody in the creative space has to learn about them. And so we're hopefully in the next month going to announce a big venture with a great partner on how we're going to get into the space. But I think certainly for the creative community, it's a must if you're an artist, if you're a singer, if you're any producer of creative content, to really understand that space. And some people might feel like they missed out on the beginning of bitcoin or ethereum, I don't think they have. But no one's missed out on the beginning of nfts.
00:20:11.100 - 00:20:36.766, Speaker A: It's just starting. So it's a perfect time to dive in, spend time educating yourself, and figuring out how that ecosystem is going to develop. All right, well, listen, I think this was great. I like to keep these short and punchy. I think my audience, it's not big, but it's growing, is going to love you. Isaiah, why don't you talk about your own handles, how people can find you.
00:20:36.910 - 00:20:44.184, Speaker B: On Twitter, it's Instagram at bitcoin Z LLC and at bitcoin and black america.com dot.
00:20:44.264 - 00:20:48.576, Speaker A: Let's keep in touch and let's hope bitcoin goes a heck of a lot higher.
00:20:48.640 - 00:20:52.032, Speaker B: Will do. Mike. I'm glad you brought me on the show. Glad. Glad I could speak with you.
00:20:52.168 - 00:20:52.464, Speaker A: All right.
