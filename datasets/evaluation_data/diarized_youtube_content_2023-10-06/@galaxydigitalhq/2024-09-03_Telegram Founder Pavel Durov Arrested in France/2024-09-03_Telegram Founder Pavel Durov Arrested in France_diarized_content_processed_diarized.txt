So what happened was Pavel Durov for whatever reason being a jet setting global entrepreneur presumably worth a couple of bucks, decided he was going to fly to Paris where he's a, he's a French citizen and he's also a citizen of the uae. So he flew to Paris and if the media reporting from French media sources is correct, when he was on his way there a judicial warrant was hurriedly executed for his arrest and he was arrested as soon as, basically as soon as he put down on the tarmac. So the list of charges came out. So initially everybody said we don't know what the charges are. There was, there was a, there was a, an initial release from the Ministry of Justice via the press, via leak which mentioned all of the sort of big bads of the Internet, narcotics trafficking, you know, gang rico, child pornography, all that sort of stuff.
