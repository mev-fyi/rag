00:00:00.240 - 00:00:07.374, Speaker UNK: Um, let's talk a little bit about Galaxy's mining business. I know some of our listeners are interested. What. What's going on with it.
00:00:07.454 - 00:00:19.350, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think, like, I. I'm actually excited for the summer. So I think, you know, when people. When people talk to me like, oh, like, is the. Is the having, you know, bearish, is it. Is it for miners? It's like, well, it's not really bearish for miners.
00:00:19.350 - 00:00:32.382, Speaker A: Like, I. It's always. I always knew it was going to happen. Right? Like, you know, in fact, are you going to ask me four years from now if the having is bearish? No. It's like, yeah, it's always been in my model, you know, ever since I got into mining. I modeled a halving, you know, this year. Year.
00:00:32.382 - 00:00:58.334, Speaker A: That being said, for every miner, I don't. You know, I've heard some miners like, oh, I'm looking forward to the halving. I don't. I don't understand that necessarily, because your revenue is going to decline, certainly. But I will say, you know, asking about our operation, the one thing I was excited about is I think that, you know, we. I don't think that there's a miner better prepared for the having than we are. I truly think, you know, our helio site down in Dickens county in Texas is the best mining site in the universe.
