00:00:00.240 - 00:00:24.617, Speaker A: There's no evidence in my mind at all that there's any daylight between Kamala Harris's campaign, the Harris Waltz campaign, and the Biden administration on crypto policy. So I would say that we've made exactly zero progress this year in defi. Permeating into traditional finance. We haven't even heard the word metaverse in it feels like years. Welcome to Galaxy Brains. An infinite amount of cash. Cash.
00:00:24.617 - 00:00:31.865, Speaker A: I'm your host, Alex Thorne. The US banking system is sound and resilient. Bitcoin made a new all time high. If you're not.
00:00:31.895 - 00:00:34.037, Speaker B: Not long. So if you're not long, you're short.
00:00:34.221 - 00:00:37.941, Speaker A: Satoshi's going to come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet.
00:00:38.053 - 00:00:39.705, Speaker B: All bitcoin's going to be erased.
00:00:40.005 - 00:00:53.437, Speaker A: Bitcoin. Bitcoin's the best. Crypto outer bitcoin is going to zero. Welcome back to Galaxy Brains. Bitcoin not zero. And as always, I'm your host, Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy. We have a special episode for you this week.
00:00:53.437 - 00:01:24.455, Speaker A: Bimnet is sick. We have no guest and so we wanted to use that opportunity to share a bunch of thoughts on the state of crypto markets where we are in the cycle. And I've got a lot to say. I mean, I'm going to touch on gaming, NFTs, DeFi, stablecoins, Bitcoin, ETFs, the political situation, the regulatory situation. It's a pretty, if I may say so, and I am well known for these, but I would say it's a pretty epic rant. Phineas, what do you think?
00:01:24.955 - 00:01:41.081, Speaker B: It's a fantastic episode. We just recorded it. We're recording this intro just after it. Yeah, it is packed with stuff. If you have interest in the landscape, this is the one. We've been encouraging Alex to be on the mic solo. Yeah, and we had to twist his arm, but we.
00:01:41.113 - 00:02:08.069, Speaker A: Yeah, and I want feedback. Guys, if you're. And gals, if you're listening, like, let us know because I pretty pointed takes on some of this stuff. And you know, if you disagree or you do agree, hit us up, let us know. Before we get to that, I need to remind you to please refer to a link to the disclaimer in the podcast notes. Note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer recommendation or solicitation by Galaxy or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. All right.
00:02:08.069 - 00:02:43.487, Speaker A: People are wondering where we are in this cycle. It's been, you know, you had a bitcoin all time high in March right on the back of the ETF launches, you've got an ETF complex with net flows of over 17 billion positive. Right. So that right there is quantifiable net inflow capital into the bitcoin ecosystem. But bitcoin's basically the only asset in the crypto asset ecosystem that made an all time high this year. And I think that really has people thinking this is, you know, some people have said, is the bull market over. Based on all available data, it almost looks like the bull market never happened or never arrived.
00:02:43.487 - 00:03:12.005, Speaker A: This is some kind of new market cycle where only bitcoin actually runs. You've got bitcoin dominance at highest levels that it's ever been during a supposed bull market. Because there has been no alt season, there has been no altcoins running. Right. Ether's up 7% on the year, the S&P is up 20. Right. So you've got ether dramatically underperforming, particularly, by the way, because of August where ether was down 25%.
00:03:12.005 - 00:03:25.251, Speaker A: I think through July, the picture looked better. But August was a very, very rough month for cryptos. Bitcoin was down a lot, 10% or so. Ether was down 25%. 25%. It's a huge drawdown. Right.
00:03:25.251 - 00:03:41.509, Speaker A: In one month. And a lot of people are asking why that is. I've got some ideas. I've got Phineas on the mic here though. Does it? What does it? I mean, you know, you follow the show. I mean, it hasn't felt negative, but I would say there's a lot of negativity out there in crypto that I want to address.
00:03:41.707 - 00:03:48.401, Speaker B: Well, I'm excited to hear your thoughts. We, we were talking about the ETH BTC ratio before the show.
00:03:48.473 - 00:03:49.165, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:49.745 - 00:04:18.685, Speaker B: It also just sort of feels like a slow time. Maybe it's summer doldrums, but it does just feel like news wise. And the crypto landscape doesn't feel like there's particular. I think everyone's right. I think everyone's anticipating the election and people are kind of like when, you know, before Biden dropped out, it was everybody was anticipating Trump. That's all changed. There's a lot of anticipatory energy in the market now, but not a lot of certainty.
00:04:18.845 - 00:04:19.213, Speaker A: Right.
00:04:19.269 - 00:04:24.725, Speaker B: And maybe extended periods of uncertainty lead to this sort of like lull in the landscape.
00:04:24.765 - 00:04:47.071, Speaker A: I think that's right. And it has been uncertain if we just look at like say bitcoin price action literally sideways to slightly down since March. Right. That was six months ago. So, you know, the jubilation that came after the bitcoin ETF launches in the early winter is long past. From a, from a narrative, it doesn't mean that ETFs aren't doing well. It's just like that's not.
00:04:47.071 - 00:05:29.069, Speaker A: If you recall, you go back and I know you recall we were here recording throughout that entire period, obviously. And I mean, there was literally champagne bottles popped all around the world when those were approved in January and when they really started to run and bitcoin hit like 73,000 all time high in March, it's. That feels like a fairly long time ago. There is seasonality, right? I mean, August is among the worst performing months for bitcoin, just as a proxy for all of crypto historically over like the last 10 years. September is the worst, seven out of the last 10. September is Bitcoin traded down in September, but October is the best performing month historically from a seasonality perspective. And November, December also quite good.
00:05:29.069 - 00:05:47.089, Speaker A: So. And actually, if people recall, it wasn't until October, late October of last year that the bitcoin ETF anticipatory trade really started to take off. September was very slow and negative last year also. So there is seasonality. There is like. And I would say, yeah, the election. We'll talk, I'll talk about that in a minute.
00:05:47.089 - 00:06:31.639, Speaker A: More specifically for crypto, but the election feels toxic, right? I mean, we're, I'm just, I've been voting in elections since about 2004 and they. It was. These are like sort of the first, the last few, certainly this one where basically both sides are claiming that it's apocalypse if the other wins. You know, it makes you pine for the more, you know, civil discourse and reasonableness of say like an Obama McCain, you know, battle or even an Obama Romney battle. Like the level of vitriol in the country around this election from both sides, in my opinion, is very high. And I think that really weighs on people, right? It makes you just feel negative. It's depressing.
00:06:31.639 - 00:07:21.407, Speaker A: And I don't, I don't think it is the case that in one case or another, it's some kind of apocalyptic outcome. But what I know is that it shouldn't be, right? The American president is supposed to have limited powers, right? So it shouldn't even be possible that one person gets in and somehow ruins the whole country. It shouldn't even be possible, right? They have, you know, Article 1 of the U.S. constitution is the Congress, not the president for a reason. And I'm critical of this, but I think it's partly because of this concept of the unitary executive, and that the Congress, for its own systematic failures, operational failures, has abdicated so much responsibility to the executive branch that it actually does matter a lot, and it really should matter less. But I think those are factors. I mean, is that the vibe you feel in the country on this election? It just feels angry? It's very angry.
00:07:21.511 - 00:07:52.261, Speaker B: It does. It feels. But it also feels, again, uncertain. On top of that anger, there was. There was significant anger. There's been anger for the last several years, but I think there was such a seismic shift when Biden stepped down that now everyone is sort of like, trying to realign and understand what the implications of that are from every angle. So there's anger and a little bit of.
00:07:52.261 - 00:08:14.261, Speaker B: And significant uncertainty. And that's. I think that's evident. And in some ways, there's a bit of relief from that anger because people are kind of like, trying to re. Understand the landscape. But I think for crypto and for the markets more generally, that uncertainty is like. It sort of feels sort of murky as to the way forward.
00:08:14.261 - 00:08:26.975, Speaker B: And, you know, the Democratic ticket is not spoken on crypto, not much at all. And, you know, Trump is being Trump. And yeah, the bitcoin conference, we were in the room at that.
00:08:27.015 - 00:08:28.463, Speaker A: We were and was very bullish.
00:08:28.519 - 00:08:29.335, Speaker B: That was a wild day.
00:08:29.375 - 00:08:47.071, Speaker A: But that was two months ago. And there was a hangover, literally, like a drunk like you. You got drunk on that speech. Right. It was. I mean, in many ways, that had all the red meat that bitcoiners and crypto more broadly wanted to hear. And then it was over, and now he hasn't talked about it since, and it's unlikely to.
00:08:47.071 - 00:09:08.261, Speaker A: Right. And it's like, oh, that's. That was the big excitement. And while I think it was obviously notable, just a former president, any former president to give a speech like that would be bullish. But now that's behind us right now we have all this other stuff to deal with. Yeah, I think it's. We got some interesting things coming up.
00:09:08.261 - 00:09:39.003, Speaker A: I mean, the debate is. I think the first one on ABC is next week. It's next Tuesday, I think, September 10th. That's gonna be very interesting. I think it's gonna be very different from a Biden Trump debate. Obviously, Vice President Kamala Harris is a very different candidate at the top of the ticket than she was as the vice presidential candidate or the vice president. I really don't even want to venture any predictions around that, politically speaking or obviously as it relates to crypto.
00:09:39.003 - 00:10:38.455, Speaker A: I think the extent that crypto matters at all. You're not likely to hear either candidate mentioned crypto again, I don't think between now and the end of the election or even their staffs really. So it's more about reading the tea leaves on broadly speaking, what does financial regulatory posture and policy look like under these various administrations. We have some guests coming up over the next couple weeks to talk about that. I think there's no doubt just in shorthand that a Trump victory is bullish and you're meant to effectively own wingy upside to capture some of that, you know. And I think the question is, is a Kamala Harris administration the same as the Biden administration or is it better or worse on crypto related policy? All the evidence I've seen is that it is a continuation of the status quo period. Like there's no evidence in my mind at all that there's any daylight between Kamala Harris campaign, the Harris Waltz campaign and the Biden administration on crypto policy.
00:10:38.455 - 00:11:31.009, Speaker A: She got basically all the same advisors that, that came up with Biden and worked in the White House on Biden's crypto related financial regulatory policy. The statement that they made is it's a non statement. It says, we acknowledge that the industry wants more clarity. We will try to support innovation and clarity for that sort of industry. That's basically what they've said. But if you go and read the White House's own latest policy statement on crypto, which is the May 2024 statement of administration policy from the White House following preceding the vote in Congress for the fit 21 act, they were much more specific about being conciliatory to the crypto industry. So that statement made by Brian Nelson, this adviser to the Camp Harris campaign, is less specific and less bullish for crypto than Biden's own White House was in May.
00:11:31.009 - 00:12:07.395, Speaker A: So I don't see how you can look at that and think that it's particularly positive. On the other hand, I don't, I don't see how a policy could become much more restrictive or antagonistic to crypto than it is today out of the White House. So to me you're looking at mostly a neutral status quo continuation policy from a Harris Waltz administration. And let's be real, like I mean, we've done okay, right? We're alive. The industry is growing in America. It's hindered in many ways and lacks clarity in many ways. But like, you know, Biden's the last four years haven't been bad for crypto, broadly speaking, bitcoin, all time highs, bitcoin all time highs.
00:12:07.395 - 00:12:08.395, Speaker A: Everything. All time highs.
00:12:08.475 - 00:12:09.275, Speaker B: Everything. All time highs.
00:12:09.355 - 00:12:21.883, Speaker A: I mean, obviously, major legal problems for various parts of the industry, many of which in my view, are unfair, but nonetheless, like, we're alive. Right. So I don't think there's an existential threat from a Kamala Harris administration, some.
00:12:21.899 - 00:12:24.643, Speaker B: Of which fair and needed to be rooted out.
00:12:24.739 - 00:12:29.379, Speaker A: Absolutely. Yeah. Well, most of it wasn't rooted out until. Until after it collapsed. And I think.
00:12:29.427 - 00:12:29.755, Speaker B: Right.
00:12:29.835 - 00:13:03.305, Speaker A: In addition to having a more innovation focused regulatory frame works, they should actually police, you know, rather than showing up after the crime has been committed. And I think in a lot of cases, that's what they've done. Which is also depressing. Right. I mean, you know, they protected investors all the way offshore to get wrecked by unregistered exchanges. If they had had a proactive, progressive regulatory regime for crypto exchanges, maybe no one would be using those offshore exchanges, you know, but then, of course, they show up during the bankruptcy to get their pound of flesh. And, you know, I don't want to digress too much on that, but I think in both cases, like, they could be.
00:13:03.305 - 00:13:33.347, Speaker A: It's not just that we're asking for, like, more lenient rules. Like, we want clear rules that allow good actors to thrive and make it impossible or difficult for bad actors to thrive. And when there are bad actors, for the regulators to go after the bad actors. In my view, over the years, too many times the regulator regulators are showing up after the bad actors have already acted bad. Right. And part of the reason for that is that there are not clear rules that everybody has to follow so they don't follow them. And, you know, and.
00:13:33.347 - 00:14:11.273, Speaker A: And that punishes the good actors who try to stay above board anyway in the absence of guidance, maybe take, you know, a conservative approach to this or that issue, and then they find themselves disadvantaged in the marketplace to the people that skirt those rules. So I'd like to see that change. But let me step back before we talk. I do want to talk a little bit, I think. I guess I've said my piece mostly on Trump versus Kamala. I think it's undoubted that Trump is a positive catalyst, mostly for even if he is laissez faire to the industry, that would be a significant change than what I view as a mostly hostile attitude from the Biden administration. But more likely we would see innovation sandboxes at various regulators.
00:14:11.273 - 00:14:57.073, Speaker A: When he was president, Brian Brooks was the acting head of the occ, which I think is called the Comptroller of the Currency. He put in which is the OCC regulates national bank banks and they put in specific guidance allowing banks to do things like interact with public blockchain networks, run nodes, blah blah, blah. Right. Those were rescinded day one by the Biden administration. So we know that like some policies like that are likely to return which are specifically supportive. I think you know what happens from the market regulators, the cftc, the sec, these are a bit more independent. But if someone like a Hester purse is empowered at the sec, you're likely to see a much more innovation focused regime there that, you know, lets companies come in and try things in sandbox environments and stuff like that.
00:14:57.073 - 00:15:28.913, Speaker A: So in my mind there's no doubt that a Trump presidency is bullish for digital assets in America. The question is the extent to which a Kamala Waltz administration is negative. I think the downside's mostly capped. Like I said, I don't think get that much worse than it is today. Let me give a couple other data points and talk about this crypto malaise. Travis Kling had a thread, you know of Ikigai Capital. He's in to be fair, Travis has been very bearish for a while now, particularly since FTX its collapse.
00:15:28.913 - 00:15:55.459, Speaker A: But he had a thread that was going viral on Twitter talking about this quiet quitting that the industry is doing in his view. I wouldn't call it that. But I think his thread speaks to this malaise. Right. And people at conferences. I think basically outside of bitcoin there's significant disillusionment among the crypto builders, like investors, even industry broadly. Bitcoin has done great.
00:15:55.459 - 00:16:48.023, Speaker A: I mean it's still kind of sideways like I said since March, but I mean all time high this year, massively successful, probably the most successful of all time ETF launch from the Bitcoin ETFs plenty of stuff going well in bitcoin world, right? Interesting innovations happening, debates about the future, upgrades and stuff like all that seems mostly okay. Digital gold narrative at a minimum permeated quite well. Like people get people know what bitcoin bitcoin is. The rest of the crypto complex doesn't feel nearly as certain. Right. And I think if you think about 2021 there were these big application categories that drove so much interest in Ethereum as an example and maybe this can be the proxy to talk about the ETH BTC ratio which is just one. I don't think a lot of people actually trade this, you know, like short ETH and long BTC specifically in the same trade, borrow eth, sell it and use the proceeds to buy Bitcoin would be how you one way to put on that trade.
00:16:48.023 - 00:17:39.533, Speaker A: I don't think a lot of people actually do that, but I think it's, it is a widely watched ratio because it hints, it tells you information about this broader market status, right? And but if you look at those application categories from 2021 that cause so much interest in Ethereum, right? We're talking about things like web3nfts, the metaverse, gaming and crypto, right? You could even say Defi. They're all pretty bad right now. Those narratives lack salience, broadly speaking. Almost all of them. I think, in fact the only one of those that has durability right now is Defi. It is widely used, right? Defi on Ethereum and other networks and potentially on Bitcoin soon if we have L2s and stuff. Defi is widely used now the thing about Defi is that it's widely used by on chain crypto wealth.
00:17:39.533 - 00:18:10.949, Speaker A: There's nobody that I know in Wall street saying, man, I'm taking this company public. If only I could take them public on the blockchain. Never heard those words uttered, right? No one's like, I want to buy these stocks. But gosh, it'd be great to do it on a decentralized exchange instead of the New York Stock Exchange. So there's there the problem. Defi's narrative stagnancy is driven by a total lack of interest from Tradfi and actually using it. So I would say that we've made exactly zero progress this year in Defi permeating into traditional finance.
00:18:10.949 - 00:18:53.455, Speaker A: We have seen a little bit of the reverse, which is a little bit of traditional finance coming into Defi. But it's basically been, you know, what the space likes to call real world assets. It's basically been crypto on chain yield rates low, real rates in the and yields in the traditional economy high. Let's bring some of that yield on chain, right? So you've got companies tokenizing US treasuries as an example. BlackRock is doing this because there's on chain wealth to service that wants access to that, that traditional yield. And for whatever reason, that on chain wealth can't just go to Fidelity or whatever their brokerage firm is to get that. And there's a fairly large amount of on chain wealth that can't.
00:18:53.455 - 00:19:13.149, Speaker A: But outside of that, there's no new Defi. Primitive really, right? I mean, most of this stuff falls into three categories in my view. Decentralized exchanges, decentralized lending and synthetic asset protocols. Those are built mostly right. We haven't seen a way. It's not like summer 2020, which you call defi summer. You saw a wave of innovative new types of ideas.
00:19:13.149 - 00:19:30.381, Speaker A: Right. I think there's. There's some innovation on the stable coin side with these delta neutral stable coins like Athena and, and. And yield bearing stable coins like Mountain and others. But like again that's. They're not huge yet. Most of the world that uses stable still uses tether and, and circles stable coins.
00:19:30.381 - 00:19:48.093, Speaker A: I wouldn't call it like game changing narrative. Right. It's a marginal innovation on the stable coin. And so I think there's some stagnancy there. When we look at those other categories though, like NFTs are just down bad. I don't mean just their floor prices, I mean trading volumes. Like people are not interacting with NFTs like they were.
00:19:48.093 - 00:19:52.653, Speaker A: There's no Jimmy Fallon coming to talk about your NFT on his show. Like there was. You remember that?
00:19:52.709 - 00:19:53.453, Speaker B: Yeah, it's crazy.
00:19:53.509 - 00:20:21.839, Speaker A: I mean he's like Snoop Dogg and Eminem did a whole song straight out of Compton I think was called or From Detroit to Compton or something. I forget because Eminem and Snoop and the video is them as bored apes. Right? I mean we are so far from that. And then also you have think about gaming, right? No, still no hit game. Some. A lot of people working on that. Games are really long.
00:20:21.839 - 00:20:51.027, Speaker A: They take a long time to build and they're expensive, but they're not here yet. Right. And the rest of it looks similar. Right. The hot narratives this year have been like inside crypto, outside of bitcoin, inside of the crypto crypto world have been infrastructure stuff, modular blockchain thesis and restaking. Right. And the L2s versus Solana and I mean these are infrastructure plays.
00:20:51.027 - 00:21:13.976, Speaker A: They're not application layer stuff. It's applications that drive users. Right. And so, and we've seen this like we've seen a lack of capital venture investment is down. Last quarter Q2 was about 3 billion across 570 deals. But I just looked a minute ago, right where we got about 26 days left in. I'm looking at a watch I don't have if you're watching me on YouTube just out of habit.
00:21:13.976 - 00:21:42.299, Speaker A: We've got about 26 days until the end of the quarter and we only have 1.7 billion invested across 300 deals. So it's likely to be low. And there's reasons for that that are structural, like rates and stuff that harm venture overall. But that lack of investment is Partially born from this stagnative narrative environment. Right? And let's be real, a tiny, tiny, tiny portion of VC crypto VC is actually going to bitcoin related stuff. The vast majority is going to things like web3defi NFTs, gaming, metaverse.
00:21:42.299 - 00:22:09.331, Speaker A: Right. I mean, we haven't even heard the word metaverse in it feels like years. Right. So that stagnancy is, I think, contributing to a lot of malaise in crypto, you know, and it absolutely these things, the some unique regulatory headwinds, the lack of cumulative ETF flows for Ethereum are also contributing to that ETH BTC ratio. Right? ETH as a proxy for these application layers. Right. And Bitcoin has its own sort of digital gold narrative.
00:22:09.331 - 00:22:55.923, Speaker A: So like that thing has been down ETH BTC for two straight years in a very clear channel. Lower highs, lower lows for two years since September 22, literally since the merge, which was about two years ago. And I just don't know what reverses that. Obviously eventually it runs out of, runs out of steam. Yeah, Look, I know this has been a bearish soliloquy monologue, 25 minutes of bearishness. I think it's important just to be truthful about where you know, someone we, you know, we sit in this space and I talk to a lot of builders across the crypto ecosystem, investors, crypto native hedge funds, and to acknowledge that there is, there is a malaise due to a lack of innovation capital outside of the bitcoin space. I think it's important to acknowledge that.
00:22:55.923 - 00:23:53.235, Speaker A: But there are, look, there are positives, right? So I say, like, you know, why are we here then? If it's because I, I don't think it's all doom and gloom in the future. The infrastructure is improving, so when those applications do show up, they will show up on much more capable footing. There has been significant infrastructure layer innovation, Right. Most of my, I think the malaise, like I said, the lack of capital, the lack of users is driven by a lack of new application types or the stagnation or breaking down of the ones that drove so much interest in 2021. Like I talked about there, there is this much stronger footing. Like we, for the first time we actually have a viable layer, one competitor to Ethereum, which is, I mean, ethereum launched in 2015. So took almost, you know, if we, if we say that this is the year that Solana really has, is distinguishing itself as a, you know, viable layer, one alternative, like that's nine years it took to get some diversification there.
00:23:53.235 - 00:24:29.669, Speaker A: And look on the ethereum side, it's facing such an interesting conundrum like the eth. One of the things contributing to the negativity on the ETH BTC ratio or just ETH weakness overall has been that it's almost a victim of its own success. Right. These L2s have permeated and are really quite successful. They still need to be more decentralized, but they're widely used. Like if we include L2 metrics along with Ethereum, usage is way up of Ethereum, but because they've scaled so effectively, a lot of that value is not accruing to the layer one. Right.
00:24:29.669 - 00:25:09.479, Speaker A: And so it's like one of these people are even we have this upgrade, proto dank sharding that creates this new blob space on ETH where roll ups can post their data much more cheaply than in call data. And that it's proto dank sharding because it's just a small amount of this new space. And even that people are talking on Twitter, not really in the developer calls or anything yet, but about maybe even rolling back a little bit. So the roll ups have to pay more to the ethics L1. So it's in some ways a little bit of a victim of its own success. And then look, there are like, you know, I was maligning the innovation happening on stable coins. Not maligning, I guess, but just saying that it's mostly marginal.
00:25:09.479 - 00:25:32.415, Speaker A: It's mostly about can we. I think the delta neutral stable coins are an interesting innovation. It's kind of like the Bitmex old Bitmex trade where you could create a synthetic dollar by longing and shorting Bitcoin in equal size. It's interesting. That's interesting. The rest of them are. The reason I'm aligned is it's mostly just about passing around to whom the interest from the underlying collateral accrues.
00:25:32.415 - 00:26:03.625, Speaker A: Right. But what's not stagnant is the usage of stable coins which are absolutely through the roof. And stablecoin supply is at or near all time highs. Right. And so payments businesses, cross border remittances, the usage of stable coins is very much in a bull market. I think that's quite interesting. I think people acknowledge broadly across the payments, outside of crypto payments ecosystems, even in traditional finance, that stablecoins absolutely are very useful technology.
00:26:03.625 - 00:26:41.495, Speaker A: Tokenization too, again that old. Oh, tokenization people have been trying to do this, right? Can we not please use the blockchain? They say that's doing such a good job settling and moving value inside the crypto native ecosystem, can we? There's got to be a way to use that for other types of assets. Let's just take publicly listed equities when on the blockchain. The Depository Trust and clearing corporation, the DTCC. See, DTCC two Cs wrote literally like in 15 or 16. I can remember when this paper came out, the seminal paper, saying that they themselves should be disintermediated by the public blockchain. That hasn't happened.
00:26:41.495 - 00:27:08.183, Speaker A: Right. I think regulatory easing makes that possible. Right. And I think most people who look at public blockchain technology acknowledge that it is a far superior system for ledgering and transferring digital value. And the world is digital, it's becoming more and more digital. So I think you're going to see permeation. Some of that is regulatory headwinds or obstacles or lack of innovation support.
00:27:08.183 - 00:27:42.591, Speaker A: And look, there's a high likelihood, not just in the U.S. but in general that we will see easing of that over time. And then look, like I said, the other categories like NFTs still work, people still like digital art. I think so much of what I'm comparing to when I look back at the 2021 was hype and mania. Like the craze around NFTs was absolutely a mania. But that doesn't mean that digital artists aren't using NFTs or won't in the future, or that there will emerge new use cases for non fungible tokens. It just feels different.
00:27:42.591 - 00:28:25.135, Speaker A: I think that's why, I mean look, if you look at the performance of the, you know, we have a great crypto hedge fund performance database vision track and if we look at that, hundreds of funds submit their performance in AUM data too on a monthly basis. I mean you can see it there. Bitcoin has outperformed all strategies this year basically, except for maybe a hair on, I think, was it quant fundamental? Perhaps that tells the story. A lot of the crypto hedge funds, they don't really invest in bitcoin, Right. A lot of the people that allocate to those funds may already own bitcoin. So they're looking for alpha over bitcoin a lot of times by investing in those and that has been few and far between this year, right? Alpha over btc. I think there's a lot of reason to be excited.
00:28:25.135 - 00:29:18.889, Speaker A: Like I said, if we look back a year ago, we were in a way more tenuous position. I think people who've been in crypto a long time, whether it's builders or investors they're conditioned to expect astronomical returns and for the cycle to go Bitcoin Eth altcoins, which it has multiple times, that hasn't happened. And I think that uncertainty, to your point earlier, Phineas, on the political side, that creates uncertainty on the market cycle side, on the investor side, people say like, well, why isn't the value flowing for. And I don't know, listeners from this podcast will probably recall that among other things, many of which were probably wrong, I did predict this. I said that the Bitcoin ETFs were likely to dampen intra crypto cyclicality. I said that multiple times. I said capital that flows into the Bitcoin ETFs is not easily available to change into Ethereum or altcoin.
00:29:18.889 - 00:29:49.531, Speaker A: Certainly not altcoins. Now, with the Ethereum ETFs, theoretically you can easily rotate in your brokerage account between a bitcoin and an ETH exposure. But those products are primarily for institutions and advisors. Right? The rest of us have been able to access exposure to bitcoin and ETH for years, and they don't rebalance on crypto trading cycles, really. Right. And that's happened like that. Intra crypto cyclicality is what creates that iconic famous crypto market cycle of bitcoin Eth alt season.
00:29:49.531 - 00:30:25.149, Speaker A: And so with most of the net flows in crypto going, being comprised of that 17 or 18 billion into the Bitcoin ETFs, that new money isn't available to be the hot ball of money, quote unquote, that moves through the various, various altcoins and trades. So that's why I think it's happening. It's a core reason capital is expensive now. It's more expensive than it's been in decades. Right. So there's not like all this easy money, right. 2021 happened on the back of literally checks mailed to you by the US government.
00:30:25.149 - 00:30:45.259, Speaker A: Right? There was just money everywhere. And by the way, for a large part of it, you couldn't even go outside to a restaurant in a lot of parts of the country. So what were you going to do? You stayed home and you traded meme coins and meme stocks and bitcoin and. Right. Like that's so much of that mania was fuel. What a time that was, right? With the. You remember that? I mean, my gosh, seems like a long time ago.
00:30:45.259 - 00:31:46.365, Speaker A: The pandemic, like when it was really in its heights and throws, I mean, people, right? March 2020 Was that like crazy bottom when like the NBA canceled their season and bitcoin dropped to like 3200 in one night. And then all the stocks like nuked. And it was before the vaccines like and so no, everyone was terrified. Nobody knew anything about the virus really. It was in May that the having happened in Bitcoin and that Paul Tudor Jones said, if we enter an inflationary regime, Bitcoin will be the fastest horse. That was May of 2020, right? That was so long ago and such a unique moment in time and now we're in just a very different moment in time. And I think without, you know, literally free money in some cases, but certainly easy money, you know, people are more discerning about what they invest in and like, you know, these various long tail crypto hype cycles, like they're not, they're not good enough to draw tons of capital.
00:31:46.365 - 00:32:11.781, Speaker A: So you know, I still. One of the main categories that I'm bullish on is gaming and I maligned it because there isn't even one like major successful crypto game. Like there's not one, you know, teen that you would talk to that's like I'm playing a new crypto game. Right? Like, but those games, I said this before, they have incredibly long development cycles. They're very hard to make. It's an extremely hit driven market. I've used the example tons of times.
00:32:11.781 - 00:32:27.277, Speaker A: Fortnite, the epic games, didn't even think Fortnite was the game. They were building a different game. And Fortnite as we know at the battle royale game was a demo for that game and then it became the game. Like even they were surprised by that. Right? So they're just hard to build. They take a long time and so many of them were funded. Newsflash.
00:32:27.277 - 00:32:56.691, Speaker A: 2021 and 2022 games take years to build good ones. So like maybe we're going to see some of these finally come to market and maybe some will be good. I mean literally it, you don't need much, you need a killer app, something. It can't be, you know, step to earn. It's not good enough, can't be Axie Infinity. But like if there was like a Call of Duty level hit, like we never, we would chuckle at how bearish Alex was on this September episode of Galaxy Brains. Right.
00:32:56.691 - 00:33:19.971, Speaker A: Like, so anyway, I think like, and then obviously like I said, there's, there's election catalysts. It's hard to see past the election but I think there's a possibility for significant upside resulting from the election outcome or and like I said, mostly cap downside. I think I said that earlier in the episode. Right. So it's not super bearish and it's possibly bullish. Right. You got no more supply overhangs.
00:33:19.971 - 00:33:53.745, Speaker A: We don't think really in the near term in bitcoin you've got that lack of supply overhang, by the way, could also be coupled with cash inflows from the FTX estate. Talking about billions more than, I forget the number. More than 10 billion. The estate claims, I think maybe even 15 billion, that they're going to deliver in cash to a creditor pool mostly derived of pro crypto. I mean literal crypto investors. That's not supply to be sold to capture gains. That's potentially cash that might some portion of which is likely to be used to buy crypto.
00:33:53.745 - 00:34:26.277, Speaker A: Certainly not all, but probably some. And then of course, the infrastructure itself is better. Like I said, it is better. So if you get those apps, and this is why I always encourage, I'm like, where are the apps that people want to use? Right. If I was a developer, and I'm definitely not, so take that with a grain of salt, you'd be hunting for things people want to use for this broader crypto thing. And I would say for my bitcoin friends, I think bitcoiners are sitting pretty in general, they're feeling fine. I mean, of course it's been stagnant.
00:34:26.277 - 00:34:58.875, Speaker A: But if you're a bitcoiner, you're mostly a long term vision kind of person on this asset. And like I said, I mean, Bitcoin's up 35%, 30% this year. That's a great year for any asset ever. Yeah, it doesn't feel like the 2000 to 20,000 of 2017 or the 3200 of March 2020 to 69,000 in 2021. Those were astronomical. But in general it's performing well. It's becoming more widely owned.
00:34:58.875 - 00:35:36.289, Speaker A: There's interesting developments happening in the ecosystem. So, yeah, I think that we find ourselves in an interesting cycle, if you want to call it that. But I think I agree with Kobe when we said let's be fair, the bull market hasn't really happened yet. This was a bitcoin market and it may continue to be one. But, you know, we have to wait and see if the broader crypto application space comes back. I'm confident it will, but there's a lot of, you know, we've got better infrastructure, but we got a lack of capital and we got expensive capital and we need more applications. I think that's my summary of it.
00:35:36.457 - 00:35:41.801, Speaker B: I just want to say, as we Close this episode out. And as your producer.
00:35:41.873 - 00:35:42.145, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:42.185 - 00:35:46.465, Speaker B: As the person whose job it is to help produce you.
00:35:46.545 - 00:35:47.089, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:47.217 - 00:35:53.385, Speaker B: We were prepping for this episode and saying we're gonna do a solo episode. Give the audience more. Alex.
00:35:53.545 - 00:35:54.025, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:54.105 - 00:36:03.433, Speaker B: And you were a little bit concerned about filling enough time. We're approaching minute 42 of you by yourself.
00:36:03.489 - 00:36:04.977, Speaker A: Well, yeah. You put a mic in front of me.
00:36:05.041 - 00:36:06.569, Speaker B: I mean, there's stuff to say.
00:36:06.657 - 00:36:06.969, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:07.017 - 00:36:11.745, Speaker B: And that was just, you know, it's just an education and I enjoyed listening to it.
00:36:11.785 - 00:36:18.973, Speaker A: I appreciate that. This is more of a. I've said this before. I was on CNBC last Friday. I basically said some of this. Right. I mean.
00:36:18.973 - 00:36:31.287, Speaker A: But, you know, I think it. Just think about how grinding these markets are. Right. Well, we've been through so much. Dude, You've been sitting in that seat while I've been sitting in this seat from like. I was joking. At the start of 2023, Bitcoin was 16:5.
00:36:31.287 - 00:36:38.745, Speaker A: Right. We're. We're at 58K. Right. I mean, it's just like. But that's a lot of volatility in there. A lot of gray hair is in my beard.
00:36:39.165 - 00:36:51.321, Speaker B: Mine too. And every once in a while, I think it's important to just put a mic behind you and say, tell us what your general thoughts are on the landscape, on the larger, wider crypto landscape.
00:36:51.393 - 00:36:51.689, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:51.737 - 00:36:54.249, Speaker B: And so we're going to start doing that more from time to time.
00:36:54.297 - 00:36:54.769, Speaker A: I like it.
00:36:54.817 - 00:36:56.177, Speaker B: And give feedback.
00:36:56.361 - 00:37:06.565, Speaker A: Yeah. Hit us up. If you, by the way, shout out to my friend Hannah Burgess with this custom Galaxy sweatshirt, hand embroidered. You can't buy this anywhere.
00:37:07.065 - 00:37:07.713, Speaker B: Beautiful.
00:37:07.809 - 00:37:25.797, Speaker A: And you know, and it's getting. We're in the fall too, by the way. I love the fall, especially in New York and in the Northeast. Things are going to look up. September, like I said, at the top of this is a seasonally weak month for all markets, by the way. I think the S P as well. But the fall is when a lot of work gets done in this world and in the markets.
00:37:25.797 - 00:37:40.151, Speaker A: So, I mean, think about last fall. We were just drumbeating this bitcoin ETF anticipation for months. What a. What a culmination. It's also, to be clear, right. It's really hard. We haven't had anything as exciting as three months of anticipating something that hadn't been.
00:37:40.151 - 00:38:03.159, Speaker A: That had first been applied for 10 years ago and then it culminating with this massive launch. Like, it's going to be hard to ever have something. A bullish market narrative that approaches that. That was such a giant coiling of the spring for months and then explosion of excitement and capital. Yeah, very hard to replicate that.
00:38:03.247 - 00:38:10.725, Speaker B: All right, let's wrap it up. Yeah, shout out to the audience. Shout out to Pub Key who was mentioning the show today? Our friends of Pub Key.
00:38:10.765 - 00:38:36.765, Speaker A: Shout out to our friends at Galaxy Marketing as well for always helping us out here. Yeah, shout out to Mike Worst Thorn, my man. Thank you, sir. We have a great. By the way, we have a great slate of guests coming up. I don't want to spoil them, but over the next few weeks it's going to be great. And we'll also be taking the show on the road again to Singapore and Hong Kong for the token 2049 and Solana Breakpoint Conferences and checking out our office there in Hong Kong.
00:38:36.765 - 00:39:14.205, Speaker A: Everyone have a safe and happy weekend and we will catch you next week. Thanks for listening to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research.
