00:00:07.440 - 00:01:04.900, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. It's another day pushing for another way to elevate, levitate heaven sent me to celebrate verbal demonstrate until it resonates cause I never knew what trouble was stayed inside the lines of a bubble buzz try to tell the truth with a touch of love utilize the words that do what subtle does but now I see a fully life can be a bully battles are a force turning vent veteran from rookie purely I gotta keep it real no matter what the format talking with my friends like Peter McCormack tell me where the corn at head into the moon I'll bring a couple friends that are with me in the room whether in the street or on 50 zooms yo, I always kill a beat like the studio's a tomb here on Galaxy brains. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmware research at Galaxy Digital. Thank you so much for listening to Galaxy brains. We have a great show for you today. Peter McCormack, host of what bitcoin did. Chairman of Real Bedford Football Club, is our guest.
00:01:04.900 - 00:01:23.950, Speaker A: We're going to talk with Peter about owning a football team, a soccer team, for our american listeners in the UK. What it is like. He's kind of like a modern day Ted lasso and also what Bitcoin did. One of my favorite podcasts in bitcoin. I think the largest podcast will talk to Pete about what it's like to run such a large media organization.
00:01:24.132 - 00:01:25.162, Speaker B: Of course, we'll check in with our.
00:01:25.178 - 00:01:32.298, Speaker A: Friend Bimnett, a BB from Galaxy trading, as always, to talk markets. FOMC meeting today. And before we get to that, I need to remind you to please refer.
00:01:32.306 - 00:01:33.018, Speaker B: To a link to the disclaimer in.
00:01:33.026 - 00:01:44.174, Speaker A: The podcast notes, and note that none of the information this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital, any of its affiliates, to buy or sell any securities. Phineas, we have a podcaster on the podcast.
00:01:44.514 - 00:02:08.010, Speaker C: I was very excited for this episode. He's somebody we look up to in the space. You know, his story, it's kind of shocking. It's far more interesting than he maybe even gets credit for. I mean, you know, he purchased a football club in the town he grew up in, and he's trying to infuse bitcoin culture into this town.
00:02:08.082 - 00:02:08.522, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:02:08.618 - 00:02:11.050, Speaker C: And become sort of like a global leader.
00:02:11.162 - 00:02:11.922, Speaker A: And it's working.
00:02:12.018 - 00:02:13.018, Speaker B: That's the crazy thing.
00:02:13.106 - 00:02:53.080, Speaker A: He's telling people that run businesses that are not related to bitcoin, that adding a bitcoin feature can be a cheat code. As he calls it, because you tap into a global community, a global audience, and literally global money that can help jumpstart and add more, you know, buzz to your business and bottom line revenue. By the way, something that happened since we recorded with Pete the. There is a dispute in the town of Bedford, there is actually another football club in Bedford that apparently, it appears, may have an improper relationship with the town's government. And the town's government is effectively threatening or has threatened to pull the lease.
00:02:53.192 - 00:03:01.024, Speaker B: For real Bedford's pitch for their football field. And it's very improper, as far as we can tell.
00:03:01.104 - 00:03:02.968, Speaker C: Documentary coming soon, I hope.
00:03:03.016 - 00:03:05.776, Speaker A: I mean, truly wild stuff in the world of football.
00:03:05.880 - 00:03:44.582, Speaker C: I think it's one thing I wanted to call up that I think is so fascinating, is one of the biggest challenges in crypto over the years has been practical application, culture change, right? Merging cultures. And what he's done is he's taken bitcoin and crypto in large degree and merged it with cultures that we know so well. And we feel so nostalgic for small town football. You know, all these things, you know, he was talking on the show and about, like, after the games, they all go to the pub and, you know, it's merging in the same way. You know, that other places like Bitcoin park and pub key are doing as well. This is just a totally different spin on it.
00:03:44.598 - 00:03:58.054, Speaker A: So, anyway, it's amazing when pub key football club. Thomas, get on that. Let's get right to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from galaxy trading.
00:03:58.094 - 00:04:00.198, Speaker B: As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy brains.
00:04:00.326 - 00:04:01.374, Speaker E: Thanks for having me.
00:04:01.494 - 00:04:02.254, Speaker A: Big day today.
00:04:02.334 - 00:04:03.274, Speaker D: Fed day.
00:04:03.774 - 00:04:05.766, Speaker E: Huge day. Yeah, basically the Super bowl.
00:04:05.790 - 00:04:07.206, Speaker B: And it was a big day, right, because.
00:04:07.270 - 00:04:08.110, Speaker E: Unbelievable day.
00:04:08.142 - 00:04:09.054, Speaker B: Tell us what happened.
00:04:09.134 - 00:04:46.658, Speaker E: So we started the day with ADP, which came in softer than expected, around 100,000 jobs. Employment data that was soft. The employment cost index came in at 0.9 versus expectations of 1%. So a notable measure for wages that Powell specifically tracks and loves came in soft. In addition, you had a regional bank that was experiencing a pretty significant drawdown in its share price as a function of loan loss provisions. And so we're seeing some weakness in finance, although it does seem a little bit idiosyncratic.
00:04:46.658 - 00:06:00.278, Speaker E: You had the refunding announcement also in the morning, but that didn't really move markets, but that kind of gave a really aggressive bid to fixed income in advance of the Fed. And we saw two year treasuries and all the short dated FOMC pricing move super aggressively, almost as if Powell had happened at 830. And then we got to Powell, and the statement read more hawkish than I think most market participants expected. And really, during the pressure, the key takeaway and the key statement was March is not likely for cuts, for cuts, but the pricing is still at, call it 35%, call it 8%. Somewhere around there could cut, could cut. And the logic, essentially, that he gave out in terms of the Fed's response function that would get them to cut was continued progress on inflation. And so basically, they've had six months in a row of really good inflation data, and that's why the six month run rate for core PCE is below 2%, which is their target.
00:06:00.278 - 00:06:43.078, Speaker E: And three months actually won six. But specifically, they probably need to see a couple more months of that. And if you got something even lower than that, then you could potentially be talking about earlier or bigger cuts. But it basically set the stage for the Fed to begin cutting around the spring of this year. I would say most analysts expect May, June, September cuts to the tune of, for the calendar year 2024. Anywhere from 100 to 150 basis points is where the range of expectations are, and that is going to hold. I would say equities did not like the pressure.
00:06:43.078 - 00:07:26.038, Speaker E: They traded down S and P was off a percent and a half, and Nasdaq was off close to 2%. Some of that was based on earnings that we had, but a lot of it is just feds not cutting in March. And then lastly, there was, I would say, minimal talk of the balance sheet and normalizing the runoff. But that's gonna come into focus around the same time when cuts start. Get going. I'm in the camp that they need to be cutting already. I think the way we're looking at data now is entirely not representative of, like, the data set in the sense that, like, I'll give you one example.
00:07:26.038 - 00:08:11.310, Speaker E: There's the establishment survey for non farm payrolls, and then there's the household survey, the disparity between the two, it just keeps on growing, and it shows a totally different picture. And if you look at more qualitative things, like how many people have two jobs, right, what are the kind of work that people are doing? Is it white collar work that is increasing, or is it more blue collar? And when you start to look at the qualitative measures of things, the employment picture doesn't look great. And then more and more people, like every podcast that I listen to nowadays, obviously, ours is the best, but more and more people just highlight the fact that these surveys are just not that reliable. The response rates on these economic surveys are abysmal.
00:08:11.382 - 00:08:11.846, Speaker D: Wow.
00:08:11.950 - 00:08:28.742, Speaker E: Right? And another thing, I mean, there's an analyst on tv talking about it today, but when you look at like state level employment data, like state by state level employment data, and then compare it to the national average, you're like, wait, two plus two is equaling five right now.
00:08:28.798 - 00:08:29.390, Speaker D: I see.
00:08:29.502 - 00:09:16.908, Speaker E: And so there's just so such weird distortions that I think you need to rely on other things and you need to look at things more realistically. And realistically, we have core pc that's around 2%, likely going to be around 2%. And you've got a fed funds rate that's at 530. That means you have 300 plus basis points of restriction in the economy. And I think the main thing that I know for sure is that the business cycle has not gone away and that it kind of seems like things are shifting in the sense that companies are more comfortable laying off people. Like you're seeing more and more layoff headlines, et cetera, I think you're starting to see a normalization of supply chains post COVID. And so I think the world is becoming much more normal and therefore monetary policy needs to be much more normal.
00:09:16.908 - 00:09:41.620, Speaker E: And we're about 300 basis points away from normal right now. And I think reinflation risk is a little over hyped. And I think some people lean on commodities and stuff. But you look at China, they're having financial, a GFC type of event in their markets right now. And oil, even with all this stuff in the Red Sea, is barely reacting.
00:09:41.692 - 00:09:42.260, Speaker B: Right.
00:09:42.412 - 00:10:04.276, Speaker E: And so I think you're at a point where the commod complex is healthy, I think in terms of not that much upside risks and the global economy is slowing. That's why other central banks are cutting. You had surprises in UK CPI. You've had ecbs expected to cut in April. It's all going that way. And the Fed, I think is a little behind the curve at this point.
00:10:04.340 - 00:10:06.620, Speaker B: Yeah, it's interesting. They just want to hang on.
00:10:06.652 - 00:10:07.708, Speaker A: They don't want to do it just yet.
00:10:07.756 - 00:10:12.912, Speaker B: You had said maybe a few episodes ago, if you're going to do it in March, which now they, now he's saying they want you're going to do.
00:10:12.928 - 00:10:14.720, Speaker E: It in May, might as well start in March.
00:10:14.832 - 00:10:24.592, Speaker B: And you kind of like, theoretically they could have already done it. Like, I mean, it's sort of, it's just laying the inevitable for. And you were also making the point about the politics point, which is if.
00:10:24.608 - 00:10:26.688, Speaker A: You'Re going to be cutting, you want.
00:10:26.696 - 00:11:03.266, Speaker B: To have been cutting by the time, if you're the Fed, by the time the presidential election comes, you don't want to, like, wait, wait, wait. And then just like, cut rates right before the election and somehow, again, cause that destabilizes the economy and then be perceived as to being unfair and whatnot. I just want to throw out one more thing. So now we're thinking, what, between March and May, maybe they cut on March or May. And that's the current thinking in the market, May. So in April, bitcoin will automatically tighten its monetary policy with no involvement from humans. So we're saying then maybe then the arbitrary human intervention in markets in May will give us some respite from these high rates.
00:11:03.266 - 00:11:39.106, Speaker B: I just want to point out that contrast because I think this is a year of clash. You've got the bitcoin market and phenomenon smashing on Wall street like a wave generational clash happening between. Between young bitcoin people and older generations that now have access. They're calling up to learn about it gold bugs. And you've got the clash happening between traditional market structure and infrastructure and bitcoin infrastructure, which are now combining in some ways. But you've also got the clash between predictable, programmable money and unpredictable, arbitrary money, which is going to play out again.
00:11:39.170 - 00:11:40.978, Speaker A: In the spring of an election year.
00:11:41.026 - 00:11:44.272, Speaker B: Just like it did in 2020. What do you think about that?
00:11:44.448 - 00:11:45.872, Speaker E: I love that juxtaposition.
00:11:45.928 - 00:11:46.520, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:11:46.632 - 00:12:08.176, Speaker E: It is phenomenal. And it's so crazy. The smartest people in macro, they're all saying in 510 years time, the fiscal deficit is just going to be at the forefront of every conversation. Every conversation. And it's like those guys fully embrace bitcoin. It's game over.
00:12:08.240 - 00:12:15.280, Speaker B: They're going to have a real leg up when it comes to that thing. Bim Netabeebeebi, our friend from Galaxy trading. Thanks as always for coming on Galaxy broke.
00:12:15.392 - 00:12:16.524, Speaker E: Thanks for having me.
00:12:17.784 - 00:12:24.104, Speaker B: Let's go now to our guest, Peter McCormick, host of what bitcoin did. My friend. Peter, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:12:24.184 - 00:12:24.832, Speaker F: Thanks, man.
00:12:24.928 - 00:12:27.216, Speaker B: Dude, I've been listening to your podcast for years.
00:12:27.280 - 00:12:27.728, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:12:27.776 - 00:12:31.808, Speaker B: It's always funny and surreal to have a podcaster on the podcast.
00:12:31.936 - 00:12:32.600, Speaker F: It's always.
00:12:32.712 - 00:12:34.072, Speaker B: Do you go on podcasts?
00:12:34.168 - 00:12:34.400, Speaker D: Not.
00:12:34.432 - 00:12:36.312, Speaker F: Not often. I think I'm a terrible guest.
00:12:36.408 - 00:12:37.204, Speaker D: I do.
00:12:37.504 - 00:12:40.972, Speaker F: Like, I get flustered. I could talk about. I'm a good guest about football.
00:12:41.088 - 00:12:44.660, Speaker B: Well, that's what we're going to talk about, because obviously we could talk about bitcoin.
00:12:44.852 - 00:12:45.636, Speaker F: I'm terrible.
00:12:45.740 - 00:13:11.898, Speaker B: Both of us talk about bitcoin for our day jobs, but I really want to talk to Peter about running what bitcoin did. As far as I know, the biggest bitcoin podcast, we've gone off of YouTube subscribers because there's no public data on Spotify and whatnot. Huge podcast. I'm a big fan of it. Thank you. And, yeah, I continue to be a big fan of one of the few that I listen to. I tell our audience, basically, listen to you and Castle Island's podcast.
00:13:11.898 - 00:13:25.570, Speaker B: I listen to Marty, Ben, Matt O'Dell occasionally. And look, I mean, there are other good ones, but I don't have a lot of time. But also the Ted Lasso of bitcoin. What do we call you? The owner of Real Bedford FC.
00:13:25.602 - 00:13:26.138, Speaker A: The chairman.
00:13:26.186 - 00:13:32.010, Speaker B: Yeah, chairman of Real Bedford FC. We're a big supporter of Real Bedford here at Galaxy.
00:13:32.082 - 00:13:32.738, Speaker F: Thank you.
00:13:32.866 - 00:13:38.030, Speaker B: So I want to talk mostly about football and podcasting, but we were just. Before we started recording, we were talking about Ireland.
00:13:38.102 - 00:13:38.334, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:13:38.374 - 00:13:39.326, Speaker F: Nicest people in the world.
00:13:39.390 - 00:13:43.854, Speaker B: Great people. I had great food in Ireland. People give Ireland a bad rap for food, apparently.
00:13:43.934 - 00:13:45.446, Speaker F: Well, so what?
00:13:45.470 - 00:13:49.014, Speaker B: Cause they don't like Shepherd's pie, I guess, is what they are mad about.
00:13:49.054 - 00:13:59.630, Speaker F: So I think UK and Ireland are similar in that, like, our middle of the road food, like, just standard pub food, is not great. Our top end is very good.
00:13:59.662 - 00:13:59.990, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:14:00.062 - 00:14:04.662, Speaker F: Whereas you come to the US. I think your top end is very good, but your middle is excellent.
00:14:04.678 - 00:14:05.310, Speaker B: It's also pretty good.
00:14:05.342 - 00:14:06.566, Speaker F: Well, it's good, but it's, like, totally.
00:14:06.630 - 00:14:07.366, Speaker D: Have you seen.
00:14:07.470 - 00:14:08.990, Speaker F: It's just cheese. It's cheese.
00:14:09.022 - 00:14:16.934, Speaker B: And have you seen those videos where british folks come to the US and they find out about chick fil a or something?
00:14:17.094 - 00:14:17.950, Speaker D: Chick fil a is.
00:14:18.022 - 00:14:18.646, Speaker F: Oh, my God.
00:14:18.710 - 00:14:19.238, Speaker B: So good.
00:14:19.286 - 00:14:19.870, Speaker F: It's so good.
00:14:19.902 - 00:14:25.758, Speaker B: Shout out, bojangles. Also excellent chicken. My boss owns a lot of bojangles.
00:14:25.846 - 00:14:29.414, Speaker F: People kept saying to me, like, for years, have you had chick fil a? And they're like, whatever. It's kfc.
00:14:29.454 - 00:14:45.886, Speaker B: It's literally delicious. The chicken's so good. But there's some videos where, like, the, like, Europeans, like, find out about, like, american fast food. And, like, it's so good. To be clear, it's very bad for you, but it's delicious. So, Pete, let's. We'll get into real bad for it.
00:14:45.886 - 00:14:49.194, Speaker B: Let's talk about what bitcoin did. How many episodes have you guys done?
00:14:49.854 - 00:14:50.874, Speaker F: I don't know.
00:14:51.254 - 00:14:52.366, Speaker B: Five years, four years.
00:14:52.430 - 00:14:55.098, Speaker F: 800 maybe. Yeah, that's a lot.
00:14:55.186 - 00:14:55.738, Speaker A: A lot.
00:14:55.826 - 00:14:56.454, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:14:57.634 - 00:14:59.170, Speaker A: Danny is here off camera.
00:14:59.242 - 00:15:08.410, Speaker B: Danny's 760 episodes. You guys do it well. They're excellent quality.
00:15:08.482 - 00:15:08.962, Speaker F: Thank you.
00:15:09.018 - 00:15:22.366, Speaker B: Guests, host, production. I've been on a couple times. I've been fortunate to be on a couple times. And you have. That's the thing that, as a podcaster, I think about a lot is the quality of the production. Literally. You do.
00:15:22.366 - 00:15:27.598, Speaker B: You're in New York. We're in New York now. And you come on location with a bunch of stuff.
00:15:27.726 - 00:15:28.670, Speaker D: By the way, I should also shout.
00:15:28.702 - 00:15:30.774, Speaker B: Out, your thing on Argentina was great.
00:15:30.894 - 00:15:32.646, Speaker F: In person, though. You get it because you do it here.
00:15:32.710 - 00:15:33.806, Speaker B: I much prefer in person.
00:15:33.870 - 00:15:36.550, Speaker F: In person. It's got, like. I hate remote interviews.
00:15:36.582 - 00:15:36.958, Speaker B: Me too.
00:15:37.006 - 00:15:39.398, Speaker F: Every time we do one, I phone up Dan. I'm like, I hated it.
00:15:39.526 - 00:15:40.358, Speaker D: Hated it.
00:15:40.486 - 00:15:42.462, Speaker F: I'm distracted. I'm bored.
00:15:42.598 - 00:15:47.812, Speaker B: Yeah, you need to be in the room. I really believe that. I think that you guys do a great job with this. You have to travel a lot, though.
00:15:47.878 - 00:16:00.280, Speaker F: I think there's three reasons for that. Right. Okay. Firstly, you hang out before the interview, so you settle. The interview itself is a lot more real. You don't. You have less talking over each other.
00:16:00.280 - 00:16:10.536, Speaker F: Cause, like, you get the visual cues that someone's gonna interrupt you. You don't have the latency. And then, thirdly, you also hang out again, and then you become friends with that person. And so, like, future interviews become a lot easier.
00:16:10.600 - 00:16:11.684, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree.
00:16:12.144 - 00:16:14.476, Speaker F: I'm a in person, Maxi.
00:16:14.540 - 00:16:19.604, Speaker B: Now, you. What bitcoin did is your primary job, right?
00:16:19.724 - 00:16:24.860, Speaker F: No, no, not in terms of time. Money. Yeah, in terms of time. It's the football club.
00:16:24.932 - 00:16:25.228, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:16:25.276 - 00:16:30.500, Speaker F: I mean, Danny runs the podcast like he's the secret sauce. Shout out to Danny. It's Danny's birthday today.
00:16:30.572 - 00:16:38.624, Speaker B: Danny Knowles. Happy birthday, my friend. So. And by the way, shout out to Phineas. It was his birthday yesterday. Our guy phineas. Our audience knows phineas.
00:16:38.624 - 00:16:59.284, Speaker B: So again, okay. In terms of money, though, like, I want to ask you a little bit about the business of running a podcast. You. We're not going to get into the. Well, I was going to ask about bitcoin culture, because you put yourself out there. If you do media and everyone's got a say, they all think something. They think, let's take bitcoin.
00:16:59.284 - 00:17:17.204, Speaker B: They think, oh, you're not sufficiently a bitcoiner. Oh, you're too much of a magazine. It's one or the other. How do you manage that? I know people who know you like I do. And your guests, they know you. No one's like, oh, my God. Because let's be real, bitcoin.
00:17:17.204 - 00:17:19.084, Speaker B: Twitter is not real life.
00:17:19.164 - 00:17:20.108, Speaker F: I had a good mentor.
00:17:20.196 - 00:17:21.204, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah.
00:17:21.244 - 00:17:55.680, Speaker F: So my mentor, when I launched a podcast, a guy called Rich Roll, very successful podcaster, millions of downloads. He gets unbelievable guests now, like a list celebrities. His backgrounds, like, he's a vegan ultra athlete. And at the time I launched my podcast, my mom was sick. She had cancer, and I went vegan with her because one of the things that people do when they have cancer is they stop drinking and they go vegan. So I did it with her, was running loads and discovered his podcast and then ended up going. He had a retreat on, and I was like, yeah, I'm gonna go.
00:17:55.680 - 00:17:58.016, Speaker F: I don't know why. I just decided to go and became friends with him.
00:17:58.040 - 00:18:03.168, Speaker B: And I just said, look, when what bitcoin did retreat. All right, yeah, well, we'll get into that.
00:18:03.216 - 00:18:03.800, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:18:03.952 - 00:18:10.232, Speaker F: So. And I just said to him, well, he's at the end of it, I think he said to everyone, like, if you ever in LA, you know, look me up.
00:18:10.288 - 00:18:10.712, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:18:10.808 - 00:18:12.960, Speaker F: So I literally booked a flight to LA and went up here.
00:18:13.072 - 00:18:13.432, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:18:13.488 - 00:18:27.256, Speaker F: He's like, all right, come over. Right over to his house. I said, look, I'm level with you. I want your job. I want to do what you do. How do you do it? And he told me, and I said, like, what's your advice? And he said, look, you don't know how many people have come into me and said, yeah, I want to start a podcast. Yeah, ten episodes in, they've given up.
00:18:27.256 - 00:18:40.240, Speaker F: So you have to. You have to accept this, like, years of hard work to make it work. And he said, don't change. Like, do not let the audience change you. Don't let people shout at you, change you. You know, avoid the audience capture, just stay you. So that's what I've done.
00:18:40.240 - 00:18:51.032, Speaker F: I've just always, like, just been me, which is sometimes a bit of a moron, sometimes saying stupid shit. But, like, whenever I say something, if I say something, I definitely believe it. I'm not saying it for anyone listening.
00:18:51.088 - 00:19:00.240, Speaker B: Yeah, well, let me ask you about this, because I. And this may be totally unfair, so correct me if it's not, but I've thought of you in some cases as the Joe Rogan of bitcoin.
00:19:00.312 - 00:19:01.584, Speaker F: That's a hell of a compliment.
00:19:01.664 - 00:19:02.184, Speaker D: It is.
00:19:02.264 - 00:19:20.024, Speaker B: But here's the. I'm gonna let you down on this one. Here's what I mean. And now, Joe has evolved over time, but I used to think of his interview style as sort of like, I don't know anything. Please educate me. And I'm thinking about of the. Was it wasn't, it was the.
00:19:20.024 - 00:19:47.280, Speaker B: Not the pub key, but the X pub, the X pub thing. And I think of you, and this is sort of how I think of your interview style, which is like, let me have on the experts, let them educate me, and therefore educate the audience. And it's one reason I love your podcast, too. It's one of the ones, one of the few that I, and we don't. That run this podcast. Our podcast is really for people that know about bitcoin and crypto. This is for, I think our audience will know, people that already know a lot about it.
00:19:47.312 - 00:19:47.456, Speaker D: Right.
00:19:47.480 - 00:19:54.552, Speaker B: But, but I. Yours is really good for bringing new people in because. Partly because of that interview style. Is that something you thought about specifically?
00:19:54.648 - 00:20:02.422, Speaker F: Yeah, I mean, look, like, I have a thesis on this that there's. I've tweeted about this. There's three types of interview podcasts. There is two smart people together.
00:20:02.528 - 00:20:02.906, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:20:02.970 - 00:20:18.226, Speaker F: So that might be Eric Weinstein, and I know some scientist, and then you have a moron of smart person, which is like Joe Rogan, and then two morons, which might be like Jake, Paul and some other idiot. Right. And there is a place for all of them, right? Totally place for all of them.
00:20:18.250 - 00:20:19.402, Speaker B: But those are the three archetypes.
00:20:19.458 - 00:20:39.014, Speaker F: They're the three. And so I'm like a. More on a smart person. And when I, my previous career was advertising, I originally started as a planner. And I always say to people, the best book I ever read was a book by Steve Krug called don't make me think. It's all about, like, ux design, basically. Do not make me think.
00:20:39.014 - 00:20:52.542, Speaker F: And so that influenced the podcast in that what I'm trying to always do is help the listener understand complex things. And so occasionally you get somebody who's listening, they're like, oh, you're such a moron. It's like, yeah, you listen to the wrong show.
00:20:52.598 - 00:20:52.934, Speaker D: Right?
00:20:53.014 - 00:20:55.434, Speaker F: Go and go and listen to Stefan Livera.
00:20:55.514 - 00:20:58.090, Speaker B: Right. More technical or whatever.
00:20:58.122 - 00:21:06.546, Speaker F: Yeah, they're too smart people. And so, yeah, I've always kept it that way, just like. And then, look, sometimes now I'm asking them, look, can you explain that? And I know what the answer is.
00:21:06.570 - 00:21:07.090, Speaker B: Sure.
00:21:07.242 - 00:21:12.546, Speaker F: But most of the time, it's just like, be curious and explain it. Like, I'm five.
00:21:12.690 - 00:21:16.914, Speaker B: I love this. I'm not wrong. This is a part of a strategy. You think it's part of the archetype.
00:21:16.994 - 00:21:18.378, Speaker F: No, I just think it's who I am.
00:21:18.426 - 00:21:47.402, Speaker B: Well, okay. I don't mean to say that it's, like, conniving or anything. I just mean that apparently I'm not wrong to think of this podcast this way comes through, is my point. This is my organic thought of your podcast, by the way. It's been. It's one of the only podcasts that I send to, like, newbies in bitcoin, because it's very accessible. But I will say you've done a great job because I am a professional in bitcoin, and I also love it.
00:21:47.402 - 00:21:53.690, Speaker B: I think you also do a good job with it, so. Yeah, well, my guy, let's not just. Let's not be too pro Peter here.
00:21:53.762 - 00:21:54.654, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:21:55.594 - 00:22:12.754, Speaker B: But it is interesting, right? Because we. We don't. For example, this podcast, as I said, is primarily for professionals in the space. I mean, that's how we've done it. We could try to do it differently, but I can't be the head of research at Galaxy and do the moron expert thing. That doesn't work.
00:22:12.794 - 00:22:26.774, Speaker F: No, no. But look, a huge part of it, I'll say he's in the room. It's Danny. I'm always very pro Danny explaining it. He gets very shy and humble about it. But Danny runs the pod. If people want to come on the show, I'm like, speak to Danny.
00:22:26.774 - 00:22:34.922, Speaker F: He guides a lot of the topics. I'll push back as well. But Danny essentially runs it. But he also runs it, so I can run that.
00:22:34.978 - 00:22:58.894, Speaker B: Can we talk about a couple that you've done that come to mind in particular? And I don't want to. Look, we're competitors now with ETF, so I don't want to talk too much smack. It's not polite. But your podcast with Michael Sonnenschein. Michael, was that his name in, what, like, june of last year ish in pub key? Yeah, at pub key. You had had him on in the past, and he agreed to come on. I don't know why.
00:22:58.894 - 00:23:15.086, Speaker B: Cause you absolutely smoked this guy and there. But anyway, what was that like? Because this was just for background and for the audience. Like. So you had. So he's the president of Greyscale. I guess he was like, sure, we'll come on. This is right around.
00:23:15.190 - 00:23:16.830, Speaker F: This is before they asked to come on.
00:23:16.862 - 00:23:17.950, Speaker B: Yeah, they asked to come on.
00:23:17.982 - 00:23:18.126, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:23:18.150 - 00:23:23.434, Speaker F: So I think they. I think they screwed up. So what happened is I think they wanted to go on a pr tour.
00:23:23.794 - 00:23:27.346, Speaker B: This is just before they ended up winning the court case, by the way.
00:23:27.410 - 00:23:52.666, Speaker F: Yeah, that's where you can hold two truths. One truth is everything that grayscale and Genesis and DCG did is shady, say the least. And then they won a lawsuit, which was brilliant for everyone in bitcoin. Who wants ETF's? You can hold both truths. You can say you screwed up there, you did a good job there. It's not either or agreed. But anyway, so when we were planning to come to New York, Danny was like, should we try and get Michael Sonnensheim on the show? And I was like, there's no point.
00:23:52.666 - 00:23:56.138, Speaker F: He's never gonna come on the show. Let's not bother. That's right, isn't it?
00:23:56.226 - 00:23:56.450, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:23:56.482 - 00:24:03.946, Speaker F: So anyway, then an email comes from their pr company. They're like, can Michael come on the show? I was like, you know, funny enough, we're in New York and they're like, great, we'll make it happen.
00:24:03.970 - 00:24:06.482, Speaker B: I was like, I cannot believe it can't be happening.
00:24:06.538 - 00:24:11.774, Speaker F: So then they reached out and said, can we have top. Can we have the question? I said, look, we never give questions in advance, because we don't.
00:24:12.154 - 00:24:15.978, Speaker B: If you go to normal flow, we don't know the questions. You're not reading off a script.
00:24:16.066 - 00:24:28.074, Speaker F: So here's some topics. So we did. So we gave him the topics. And then David Bailey, I spoke to her. I said, look, I've got this coming up. Can we have a call? And we had a call, and David Bailey went to all the detail of Genesis and Greyscale.
00:24:28.114 - 00:24:47.170, Speaker B: And this is. David is the head of the owner, chairman of Bitcoin, Inc. BTC Inc. Which owns Bitcoin magazine, Utxo, and he was leading at the time, a redeem GBDC movement. Right? They wanted to unlock the coins. They owned the coins. David owned GBDC.
00:24:47.242 - 00:24:47.688, Speaker D: Yes.
00:24:47.786 - 00:24:52.940, Speaker B: He wanted to redeem. And I guess now that's kind of moot. Cause now anyone can redeem, but, well.
00:24:52.972 - 00:25:18.802, Speaker F: So there was so much detail in this, in all this prep that he was telling me, I was like, to be asked to do this justice in an interview. I need to spend a week on this with notes, arrows, drawings, like, fully mapping everything. I was like, we're in town to do 20 interviews. I don't have that. So I was like, I'm not gonna do that. And so I didn't actually know what I was gonna do. Me and Danny talked about a bunch of things, and what happened was, I said, look, let's relax when he comes in the room.
00:25:18.802 - 00:25:22.562, Speaker F: So he comes in, we're like, do you want a beer? He's like, yeah. So we all got three beers, sat down out of a bed.
00:25:22.578 - 00:25:23.574, Speaker B: You're at pub key.
00:25:23.914 - 00:25:43.216, Speaker F: Here's crisis management. Ladies in the room. Anyway, we start the interview, and Danny was like, do not let him off the hook. I was like, no, I'm not. And honestly, just as I sat down, it came to me. I was like, I tell you what, I'm gonna get you just to walk me through what you are and what you do and your responsibility. And then I'm gonna ask the big question.
00:25:43.240 - 00:25:46.008, Speaker B: It was great because it was about 30 or 45 minutes into the interview.
00:25:46.096 - 00:25:50.032, Speaker F: Danny was saying afterwards, he was like, looking in, going like, you've bottled this, you bottler.
00:25:50.168 - 00:26:09.392, Speaker B: Oh, my God. It was. I mean, I had to go. So I listened to the audio of this interview. Then I was like, so, okay, for the audience, we'll just say, Pete, you had a good, normal, friendly interview. Let him explain what Grayscale does and do all of his talking points. And then about 30 or 45 minutes.
00:26:09.448 - 00:26:11.062, Speaker F: In, I called him a liar.
00:26:11.118 - 00:26:29.198, Speaker B: Yeah, you called him a liar. You pinned him on what we now know, which is that, first of all, the next day, you also tweeted an image of a loan document from Genesis with Michael Sondensheim's signature on it, because you were starting to pin him on the question of whether or not grayscale knew about.
00:26:29.286 - 00:26:30.654, Speaker F: I didn't have that in advance, by the way.
00:26:30.694 - 00:26:31.950, Speaker B: Right. Someone gave it to you.
00:26:31.982 - 00:26:32.126, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:26:32.150 - 00:26:41.986, Speaker F: Somebody said to me, someone listened. They're like, if you had that, you should have put it on the info. I didn't. What happened was after I did the interview the next day, he said, oh, by the way, have you seen this?
00:26:42.090 - 00:26:56.450, Speaker B: Because one of the big scandals I would say about Grayscale was whether or not they were aware at Grayscale that Genesis was accepting GBDC as collateral, whether they were artificially creating GBDC shares because of the ARb. Right.
00:26:56.522 - 00:26:57.210, Speaker F: They knew.
00:26:57.362 - 00:27:14.610, Speaker B: Like I said, we know now that, like, blockfi, three arrows capital, a bunch of people were borrowing from Genesis and creating GBDC shares, which goes to Grayscale. Right? So there was a virtuous cycle or a vicious cycle.
00:27:14.722 - 00:27:27.290, Speaker F: But my point to Sonnesheim was like, you had to know, and if you. You're either lying or incompetent. And that. That burned him. But I think it was a fair statement because I don't think he's incompetent. I think he's lying. I think he had to lie.
00:27:27.290 - 00:27:38.372, Speaker F: That was my view. And so the thing was, I don't like doing interviews like that. I don't want to do gotchas. I think you can. You can literally get away with one or two a year because otherwise people won't come on the show. And.
00:27:38.428 - 00:27:38.668, Speaker D: But.
00:27:38.716 - 00:27:49.988, Speaker F: But I knew with this one, this deserved and needed to be asked. But what was really weird at the time, when I was putting pressure on him, he started looking across the room to his crisis management, thinking, what have you. What have you put me in?
00:27:50.156 - 00:27:50.948, Speaker B: Why am I here?
00:27:50.996 - 00:27:53.780, Speaker F: Why am I here? She yelled out during the interview.
00:27:53.892 - 00:27:54.228, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:27:54.276 - 00:27:57.424, Speaker F: And it's like, hold a second. You're in it by privilege.
00:27:58.524 - 00:27:58.860, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:27:58.892 - 00:28:11.408, Speaker F: You need to shut up. You're not part of this interview. If you don't like it, so be it. You know, you've gone on. You've tried to use this for a pr tour. We're not CNBC. We're gonna ask you the question.
00:28:11.456 - 00:28:13.216, Speaker B: It was really a great interview, but.
00:28:13.240 - 00:28:18.400, Speaker F: At the end, it was so awkward, so it was like, so what did I say?
00:28:18.472 - 00:28:20.752, Speaker B: I don't know. Yeah, after you did this, I don't.
00:28:20.768 - 00:28:30.294, Speaker F: Think you're gonna come on again. And, like, daddy was like, can we get your photos? Like, we'll send you one. And he just, like, got up and left. And they sat in the car outside the thing for about ten to 15 minutes.
00:28:30.334 - 00:28:32.182, Speaker B: Oh, man. Probably having another discussion.
00:28:32.238 - 00:28:32.598, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:28:32.686 - 00:28:40.222, Speaker F: And then do you know what happened? The next day? They emailed us and they were like, basically telling me to cut bits and you've got to cut this. I'm like, not cutting anything. Not cutting anything.
00:28:40.358 - 00:28:51.606, Speaker B: I'm sure I know which part they want to cut. It was a really good interview. I think it matters a lot. By the way, nobody has gotten them on the record like you did in that interview.
00:28:51.630 - 00:28:54.998, Speaker F: I tried to get Barry. I asked Barry three, four times. Even after I said, barry.
00:28:55.046 - 00:28:58.914, Speaker B: Where is Barry? All right, big week. Barry. Where is he?
00:29:00.274 - 00:29:01.282, Speaker D: Yeah, I asked him.
00:29:01.298 - 00:29:03.330, Speaker F: Barry should have spoke, but, you know.
00:29:03.482 - 00:29:12.922, Speaker B: He still should speak. There's a lot going on. He's been in this industry for ten plus years. He knows a lot, and he should be out here.
00:29:13.058 - 00:29:26.694, Speaker F: Do you know what he emailed me after that? He said, interesting interview. Yeah, he said, interesting interview. I think there's some things you don't know. I have some alternative thoughts. Happy to chat, but it won't be an interview. Well, Barry will engage.
00:29:26.774 - 00:29:26.982, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:29:26.998 - 00:29:39.022, Speaker B: Well, let's get Barry on the record. You know, some CEO's. Mike Novogratz. Go out and talk a lot. Where is Barry? Would love to see him. All right, let's shift gears. I'm a big fan of what bitcoin did, by the way.
00:29:39.078 - 00:29:39.374, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:29:39.414 - 00:29:41.582, Speaker B: As I've said, let's talk about real Bedford.
00:29:41.638 - 00:29:42.274, Speaker D: Yes.
00:29:42.734 - 00:29:50.214, Speaker B: You've got the Pirates logo on your chest right now. We've got. We're big supporters here at Galaxy. We sponsor the women's.
00:29:50.294 - 00:29:50.868, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:29:51.006 - 00:29:53.200, Speaker F: Team won every game this season.
00:29:53.312 - 00:30:00.664, Speaker B: Let's go. Let's talk about. First of all, why did you decide to buy a football club?
00:30:00.744 - 00:30:00.984, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:30:01.024 - 00:30:10.896, Speaker F: So, look, this is a situation where everything. The stars have aligned perfectly. I want to buy my local football team.
00:30:11.040 - 00:30:12.524, Speaker B: Because you're from Bedford.
00:30:12.824 - 00:30:29.082, Speaker F: Yeah. And I think we should have a team in the football league. The first four professional divisions. I don't have the money to do it. So the first time I looked at it, years ago, I just couldn't do it. I didn't have the money. And then it hit me, I was like, well, hold on a second.
00:30:29.082 - 00:30:46.578, Speaker F: If I make us the bitcoin team, football teams are just a business. If I make us the bitcoin team, all the bitcoiners around the world will back us. They'll buy our stuff. I'll get the sponsors. Economically, I can make it work. Once I realized, I was like, oh, you've got to be the first. I was like, if I don't do this, someone else will.
00:30:46.578 - 00:31:08.174, Speaker F: So I literally went straight out. I tried to buy another local team. They said, no, our rivals who hate us. And so I brought the team next door in the 10th tier, and I had a drink in Austin with the Winklevoss. I said, listen, I've got this idea. I want to take our team into the football league. And I think it was Tyler who went, how do you get in the Premier League? I was like, oh, okay.
00:31:08.174 - 00:31:09.730, Speaker F: I'll come back to you on that.
00:31:09.842 - 00:31:11.586, Speaker B: You gotta win like six leagues or something.
00:31:11.610 - 00:31:12.018, Speaker D: No, nine.
00:31:12.066 - 00:31:12.538, Speaker B: Nine.
00:31:12.666 - 00:31:19.054, Speaker F: But anyway, I said, will you sponsor me? And they went, absolutely, we'll sponsor you. I got five or six other sponsors. Like, okay, we can do this.
00:31:19.514 - 00:31:29.426, Speaker B: Some that. I really like. Gemini, obviously, they sponsored. I have the original jersey. Casa Luxor. Who else was original sponsor?
00:31:29.450 - 00:31:29.834, Speaker F: Ledger.
00:31:29.914 - 00:31:31.934, Speaker B: Just throw them out there. Ledger? Yeah.
00:31:32.474 - 00:31:33.410, Speaker F: BCB bank.
00:31:33.482 - 00:31:34.122, Speaker D: Yep. Yeah.
00:31:34.178 - 00:31:37.386, Speaker F: I mean, a bunch of people like this only works with sponsors.
00:31:37.530 - 00:31:40.370, Speaker B: Well, I mean. But it's easy, though, right?
00:31:40.442 - 00:31:41.154, Speaker F: It's not easy.
00:31:41.234 - 00:31:50.706, Speaker B: Okay, fair. But I mean, the cheat code. And we're gonna get to cheat code because people like me buy the jersey because it's got bitcoin companies all over it. It's a cool jersey, it's a great.
00:31:50.770 - 00:31:57.218, Speaker F: Logo, but you can feel like it's your team. It's like, yeah, it's my team, but it's all sounds cringy as our team, but it is our team.
00:31:57.266 - 00:31:57.978, Speaker B: It is.
00:31:58.146 - 00:32:22.074, Speaker F: I know as we go up the leagues and we get bigger and bigger, all the bitcoins are going to be like, this is our team. This is our team. Screw you, this is our team. But look, the math of football is really simple. It's 60, 70% of your chance of winning in a league is your playing budget. 20% is your manager. But that's an important 20%, 10% luck.
00:32:22.074 - 00:32:40.370, Speaker F: And so you could have. If you've got the best team and the best manager and you have that, 10% is bad luck, you're gonna win that league. If you have a mid budget and a mid manager and good luck, you might get promoted. Right? That's my thing. You can have no budget, best manager, all the luck. You're not going anywhere.
00:32:40.402 - 00:32:44.066, Speaker B: But you have a much bigger budget than everyone else in that first league.
00:32:44.210 - 00:33:13.014, Speaker F: Necessarily. The way I target is, I try and know what I think the biggest budget is and either match it or be just above. And that's a strategic thing, but that doesn't guarantee success. I know plenty of teams who've got the best budget and they don't win things. Man City have the best budget. Liverpool top of the league at the moment. I think most divisions, if you line up the teams into their order and then line them up in terms of budget, most teams will be in four or five spaces of where they are.
00:33:13.014 - 00:33:32.994, Speaker F: It's just a reality. Budget gets you the players, but you have to have a manager who can shape them to win and consistently and relentlessly win. You have to do that. And then I don't want to rely on luck. Okay. So if I had to rely, for example, this weekend, we're playing the only team that we've lost to simply on our midfielder, Lee Watkins. Unbelievable.
00:33:32.994 - 00:33:49.834, Speaker F: Players injured. That's bad luck. Now, we could go into that game and we could be two one up and they get a penalty they shouldn't get. It's two or so. There is a bit of luck, but the goal is to get this team into the professional leagues, ultimately the Premier League. Now, everyone laughs at me for this. Everyone laughs at me because they think it's ridiculous.
00:33:49.834 - 00:34:16.870, Speaker F: You're taking a team that has 40 fans years ago to the Premier League. What do you want about you? More on. But what they don't understand is the cheat codes. I got it. It clicked for me straight away. What I realized is, during this journey, everyone who supports us every four years is going to get richer and richer and richer to the point whereby every time we hit a certain ceiling, there's going to be people. I can go and say, look, we've hit a ceiling.
00:34:16.870 - 00:34:28.939, Speaker F: Do you want to get involved? Do you want to support this? Do you want to? And so I also know if our bitcoin team keeps winning and winning and winning and we get up into the leagues, we become like the wreck, the next wrecks them. Everyone's gonna be excited by this.
00:34:28.971 - 00:34:29.275, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:34:29.339 - 00:34:30.467, Speaker F: It is a cheat code.
00:34:30.555 - 00:34:31.067, Speaker B: It is.
00:34:31.155 - 00:34:41.743, Speaker F: And most people can apply it to their business. And it's gone so well. Look, we won the league in our first year. The men this year, we're now top of the league again. Seven points clear. And our ladies are top of theirs. They've won every game.
00:34:41.743 - 00:34:43.819, Speaker F: The project is working.
00:34:43.891 - 00:34:44.347, Speaker D: Yeah, it is.
00:34:44.395 - 00:34:47.819, Speaker B: It is working. And it's also revitalizing the town of Bedford. Right?
00:34:47.851 - 00:34:48.067, Speaker D: Yes.
00:34:48.115 - 00:35:04.694, Speaker F: Well, look, again, early days, but every game, every home game, there will always be someone who comes in like, hey, I'm from Arkansas. Hey, I'm from Miami, or, I'm from Slovakia. And that people will constantly coming in and we now put it on the conference, which we'll talk about.
00:35:04.734 - 00:35:05.094, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:35:05.174 - 00:35:11.742, Speaker F: You know, I've. I've worked out, I think the economic inflow to Bedford for that will be two to 3 million pounds, which is a lot of money.
00:35:11.798 - 00:35:12.198, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:35:12.286 - 00:35:14.518, Speaker F: Bedford's now on the map. No one had heard of Bedford before I ever heard.
00:35:14.526 - 00:35:18.362, Speaker B: So Bedford's, what, 45 minutes or so north of London on a train, an.
00:35:18.378 - 00:35:37.394, Speaker F: Hour in the car. It's historically a deprived town. It does have certain areas of poverty. I don't know what's like here in the US, but the high street, the town center, is dying because most people shop online. So it's a lot of charity shops, betting shops or pubs. There's a lot of closed shops. I'm trying to take over.
00:35:37.394 - 00:35:44.432, Speaker F: So I open one place, I'm trying to put two more. So I'm trying to revitalize it. And I'm trying to make Bedford like the bitcoin hub of Europe.
00:35:44.528 - 00:35:44.784, Speaker D: Right.
00:35:44.824 - 00:35:48.120, Speaker F: Because if I do that, then it will revitalize the.
00:35:48.152 - 00:35:48.568, Speaker B: It will.
00:35:48.656 - 00:35:52.232, Speaker F: We've just had the announcement that we're getting a universal studios in Bedford, which is utterly insane.
00:35:52.288 - 00:35:52.712, Speaker B: What is that?
00:35:52.728 - 00:35:53.584, Speaker F: Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.
00:35:53.624 - 00:35:54.256, Speaker B: What is that?
00:35:54.360 - 00:35:58.648, Speaker F: Like, Universal Studios have bought 500 acres on.
00:35:58.736 - 00:35:59.848, Speaker B: They're building a theme park.
00:35:59.936 - 00:36:00.488, Speaker D: Yes.
00:36:00.616 - 00:36:03.416, Speaker F: They picked Bedford. They didn't pick London, Manchester, Leeds.
00:36:03.440 - 00:36:04.048, Speaker B: That's incredible.
00:36:04.136 - 00:36:04.992, Speaker F: They went, Bedford.
00:36:05.048 - 00:36:05.520, Speaker B: That's incredible.
00:36:05.552 - 00:36:20.204, Speaker F: The only thing. The only reason I think it might have happened is we've got, right near our football ground, literally five minutes. We've got two air blimps. You know the blimps there? Airships, hangers, old hangers. They're the largest indoor structure in the UK. Batman was filmed there.
00:36:20.284 - 00:36:20.612, Speaker B: Wow.
00:36:20.668 - 00:36:20.860, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:36:20.892 - 00:36:25.516, Speaker F: Because they built Gotham City in there. So when you watch Batman, that's. That's in Bedford, 50 minutes from my house.
00:36:25.540 - 00:36:26.140, Speaker B: Let's go, Bedford.
00:36:26.212 - 00:36:26.652, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:36:26.748 - 00:36:29.388, Speaker F: So. So I think that might be the connection.
00:36:29.476 - 00:36:30.084, Speaker B: Very interesting.
00:36:30.124 - 00:36:41.900, Speaker F: But the town is definitely just doing this shift now. It's on the map. Everyone is backing us apart from our next door neighbors. Bedford town football club. They hate us because they've had the monopoly for, you know, decades.
00:36:41.932 - 00:36:42.236, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:36:42.300 - 00:36:46.516, Speaker F: They literally hate us. They're doing everything to cause us problems.
00:36:46.540 - 00:36:49.704, Speaker B: I don't know who those guys are. They're not on any podcast. I don't know who those guys are.
00:36:50.004 - 00:36:51.652, Speaker F: But, yeah, no, look, the whole thing's just working.
00:36:51.708 - 00:36:56.996, Speaker B: It's really, really interesting. And we've seen now, like, what, there's four teams now?
00:36:57.060 - 00:36:57.212, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:36:57.228 - 00:37:01.588, Speaker B: Like, in the Czech Republic, maybe, or Bulgaria. Bulgaria? Yeah, Bulgaria is the one.
00:37:01.596 - 00:37:03.356, Speaker F: I'm thinking Hawaii and Austria.
00:37:03.380 - 00:37:14.318, Speaker B: I think people are realizing that there is a global movement in favor of bitcoin. Hundreds of millions of people love bitcoin around the world, and they also like football.
00:37:14.406 - 00:37:15.114, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:37:15.814 - 00:37:22.526, Speaker F: Wasabi have just sponsored another club. Coin corner was sponsoring Oxford City. Like this. Cheat code is spreading through football.
00:37:22.710 - 00:37:23.790, Speaker B: Let's talk about cheat code.
00:37:23.822 - 00:37:24.238, Speaker F: Yes, sir.
00:37:24.286 - 00:37:38.552, Speaker B: It is a cheat code that you've unlocked, and it's working. And as I said, what do we care in New York about north of London football clubs? Well, we care a lot, turns out. But you have a conference.
00:37:38.608 - 00:37:39.008, Speaker D: Yes.
00:37:39.096 - 00:37:39.888, Speaker B: Called cheat code.
00:37:39.936 - 00:37:40.208, Speaker D: Yes.
00:37:40.256 - 00:37:41.440, Speaker B: It's what, in April?
00:37:41.632 - 00:37:41.976, Speaker D: Yes.
00:37:42.000 - 00:37:56.360, Speaker F: So we did it last year, but what we did, it was like a live podcast like this. 150 people sold out. Sold out in the final week. And then everybody, we took them to the game, and everyone had a great time. Jeff Booth loved it. I mean, he had a great time. Everyone just had such a good time.
00:37:56.360 - 00:38:27.808, Speaker F: And so going around to these conferences, it's become really clear to me what works and what doesn't. Right? And so we decided we were want. We wanted to do another one. And the things that stand out to me about conferences is that if you're in industry, you want to see your mates hang out and get drunk. If you're not in industry, you want to see the people you see, on podcasts that get a photo, everyone cares about the first day of the conference. Second day is always a disaster because people are hungover and don't turn up, and the room's half empty. And then you always have, like, this weird expo hall where it's like, you've sold, like, space.
00:38:27.808 - 00:38:41.144, Speaker F: Loads of, like, shitty companies because you need to bring the money in, right? And so, like, we flipped it. We'll go, okay, we're going to change the economics of this and the way it's gonna function. We're gonna have it two days. But the first day is the conference where everyone's, like, ready and fresh. Yeah, I'm up for a.
00:38:41.184 - 00:38:41.952, Speaker B: Excited to be there.
00:38:42.008 - 00:38:44.920, Speaker F: Yeah, let's do it. And then second day, there's no point. Cause no one cares.
00:38:44.992 - 00:38:45.888, Speaker B: Starts in the afternoon.
00:38:45.936 - 00:38:56.112, Speaker F: Yeah, we're gonna. Well, no, still starts in the morning. But what we're gonna do is we're gonna get a bunch of buses. We're gonna bus everyone down to our stadium. We're gonna have a barbecue, marquee, a party, and a football match.
00:38:56.168 - 00:38:56.448, Speaker B: Sick.
00:38:56.496 - 00:38:59.848, Speaker F: And I swear to you, everyone's gonna go, this was brilliant. They will love it.
00:38:59.896 - 00:39:00.560, Speaker B: I'm excited.
00:39:00.632 - 00:39:22.924, Speaker F: Yeah, it will work. We're flipping the conference on its head, having an expo hall. Basically, if we sell 300 tickets and five sponsors, we don't lose money. If we sell 500 tickets and three sponsors, we don't lose money. If we sell both, we make a little bit of money, right? We don't need. This, for me, isn't about making money. It's not worth the effort and stress.
00:39:22.924 - 00:39:47.110, Speaker F: Even if you make 100,000 profit, it's not worth the effort of stress. But what it's worth to me is Bedford again on the map. Economic inflow into Bedford, like two, 3 million pounds. Recognition from the local council. Oh, somebody's doing something here. We should support them, right? And then great for the football club. I think once you go, you really get it, because when you go, you realize, I mean, our ground is a shithole.
00:39:47.110 - 00:40:05.416, Speaker F: It is a crappy little ground with a porter cabin for a bar. But you get there and you see everyone has fun. It's a really good day out, and you feel what's being built. There is a community being built here. And so for me, it's. Sometimes you do things in life not from the money, for the. For the goal.
00:40:05.416 - 00:40:06.640, Speaker F: And that's what we're doing for the goal.
00:40:06.672 - 00:40:07.840, Speaker B: It's a longer term play.
00:40:07.912 - 00:40:08.096, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:40:08.120 - 00:40:28.896, Speaker F: No, don't get me wrong. Like, if we can make this a regular every year. And it's only as a thousand people come in and we do. Yeah, we will do cheat code Australia and maybe an America, if we can do that, have maybe three and rotate them each to a thousand people. It's a revenue line and it's worth it for sure. But the one right now is really like, you know, a lot of my attention is now focused on my town.
00:40:29.000 - 00:40:29.520, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:40:29.632 - 00:40:53.314, Speaker F: You know, this. What can I do to rejuvenate Bedford? Make it a better place, improve opportunity for people there with these little things. Like, we have a 12,000 pound a year budget within the football team, so that any kid, boy or girl, if their parents cannot afford a pair of football boots, they can't afford the subs. We will pay it for them. So no kid. So every kid who wants to play football can. Yeah, that's a small start.
00:40:53.314 - 00:41:16.470, Speaker F: We're opening a rail bed for shop and cafe in the town. That's the start. You know, my dream is I want to build a stadium. In that stadium, we have a co working space, we have classrooms to teach people, economics and finance. We have a football academy. So kids who want to. Because at the moment, if you're a good footballer, you get a Milton Keynes, Cambridge, Stevenage and go and play for one of the big clubs.
00:41:16.470 - 00:41:22.562, Speaker F: We want to keep them in Bedford. So my dream is, is that I can centralize. It's all around Bedford with bitcoin as the cheat code.
00:41:22.618 - 00:41:37.734, Speaker B: It's brilliant. And it's also, let me ask you, before we wrap, too, about, like, the bitcoin third places, right? We're in New York, we have pub key. There's bitcoin park in Nashville, there's bitcoin commons and Austin. There's one in Lisbon.
00:41:38.394 - 00:41:39.250, Speaker F: La needs one.
00:41:39.322 - 00:41:57.794, Speaker B: Yeah, there's Bedford in the UK. Yeah, LA does need one. Somebody was saying, actually, on Twitter, they said, we need a bitcoin, we need a pub key in Austin. I was like, you absolutely do. I said, woke is hosting a bitcoin meetup at a bar. Bespoke is buying the bar and making every day a bitcoin meetup.
00:41:57.834 - 00:41:58.354, Speaker F: There you go.
00:41:58.434 - 00:42:05.954, Speaker B: But Bedford is also one of these things now. I don't. I like the third place thing.
00:42:06.034 - 00:42:06.818, Speaker F: Spaces.
00:42:06.946 - 00:42:07.654, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:42:09.274 - 00:42:10.810, Speaker F: I think of them as pilgrimages.
00:42:10.922 - 00:42:11.314, Speaker D: Right.
00:42:11.394 - 00:42:13.760, Speaker F: Yeah. A lot of people made that.
00:42:13.792 - 00:42:17.528, Speaker B: You really can't be a bitcoiner and have not gone to pub key in New York at this point.
00:42:17.656 - 00:42:33.304, Speaker F: And if you. If you go to. Well, look, let me go back a step. When I first did the podcast, right? First couple of years in what used to be very cool is I could go to a city. I could be in, I don't know, Nashville. I could be in San Diego and say, I'm in town. Who wants a beer? Go to a pub.
00:42:33.304 - 00:42:36.560, Speaker F: 20 people will turn up. Bitcoin is. Want to hang with bitcoin? Us?
00:42:36.592 - 00:42:37.056, Speaker D: Yeah, they do.
00:42:37.120 - 00:42:58.122, Speaker F: Bunch of weirdos. We're all psychos. Want to hang out together. Now, what people have done is they've monetized that by creating these spaces. And it's very cool, but it becomes a destination and it becomes a magnet and it becomes a pilgrimage. So if I'm in New York, pub key is a magnet. But actually, when we're planning a trip, we're here now.
00:42:58.122 - 00:43:12.030, Speaker F: We're going to Nashville. Those two places are magnets. They draw us in Bedford, El Salvador. They're pilgrimages. I think of that as like most bitcoin is eventually want to go to Elzante and see what that is about. Someone to come to Bedford and watch Raoul Bedford. And it happens.
00:43:12.030 - 00:43:43.690, Speaker F: So this is only going to expand. And again, it's kind of like a cheat code again. Thomas has a bar, right? If there's no bitcoin, that bar probably does okay. But that extra 1020 percent because of bitcoin, that makes the difference. And I think there needs to be a lot more people not thinking about just making bitcoin businesses, making normal businesses part bitcoin, because that extra 1020 percent means. It means you're going to do that little bit better. You know, if you've got a hotel in Berlin, we accept bitcoin.
00:43:43.690 - 00:43:47.858, Speaker F: Yes, that's extra 10% of people coming in. So yes, it's just the cheat code.
00:43:48.026 - 00:43:57.354, Speaker B: Love it. My friend Peter McCormack, host of what Bitcoin did, chairman of real Bedford FC. Thank you so much, Pete, for coming on Galaxy Brands.
