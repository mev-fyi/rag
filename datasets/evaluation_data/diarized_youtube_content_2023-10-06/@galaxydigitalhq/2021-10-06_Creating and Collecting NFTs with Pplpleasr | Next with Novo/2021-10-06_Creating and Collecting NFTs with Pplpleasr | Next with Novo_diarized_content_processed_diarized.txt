00:00:01.160 - 00:00:09.318, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. I'm Mike Novogratz, and this is next with Novo. Emily.
00:00:09.446 - 00:00:10.110, Speaker B: Hello.
00:00:10.262 - 00:00:27.554, Speaker A: Those of you who don't know Emily, she's also known as people pleaser, and she's a kick ass NFT artist. I'm gonna let you talk, mostly because I was out really late last night and I hungover. You wrote an article how crypto changed your life, and it's a beautiful place to start. So why don't you a little recap so we can start understanding your story for sure.
00:00:27.634 - 00:00:32.994, Speaker B: It was an op ed piece that I had wrote for Fortune magazine, which, by the way, I brought you a gift.
00:00:33.074 - 00:00:34.134, Speaker A: That is awesome.
00:00:34.434 - 00:00:36.010, Speaker B: There's a little message for you.
00:00:36.042 - 00:00:40.294, Speaker A: To be on the COVID of Fortune before you're 30 years old is pretty damn cool.
00:00:40.674 - 00:00:43.474, Speaker B: I mean, yeah, I'm not on the COVID but I have.
00:00:43.514 - 00:00:46.378, Speaker A: You are the COVID You are the COVID It's better than being on the.
00:00:46.386 - 00:01:26.362, Speaker B: COVID We are all on the COVID I would like to think of it that way. This is meant to represent the entire crypto community. Community. At least I hope so. But anyways, so, yeah, I had the fortune opportunity to collaborate with Fortune magazine, and then Robert Hackett, who is one of their senior writers, asked if I could write an op ed piece. And then I had never written one before, so I was like, sure. And I think it was cool because I had always sort of just internally thought about how it's crazy that, you know, in the past year, my life has changed so much, mainly because of crypto.
00:01:26.362 - 00:01:44.818, Speaker B: I did sort of passively get into it in 2017. I was just basically buying shit coins in 2017. And then. But, you know, it was always separated from my career. Right. And then so sort of in my op ed, I was just talking about how around last summer, I was actually supposed to go work at Apple.
00:01:44.906 - 00:01:46.938, Speaker A: Dream job. Parents. Proud of you.
00:01:47.026 - 00:01:53.170, Speaker B: Yeah. Everyone was very excited. And then because of the pandemic hit, they rescinded my offer.
00:01:53.242 - 00:01:58.154, Speaker A: And then the richest company in the world, and they would rescind the offer on young grads.
00:01:58.234 - 00:02:10.674, Speaker B: I mean, I think it was more boycott Apple. It was actually more because of the USCIS shutting down during the pandemic and because they needed to get me a visa and everything. And then. So the USCIs during that time, just stopped.
00:02:10.754 - 00:02:12.274, Speaker A: Donald Trump did not, like, ages.
00:02:12.394 - 00:02:37.804, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess he just didn't want me to be here. That's fine. And then. So I ended up unemployed. And this was the first time, you know, since college that I was just without a job or plan. And obviously, I was mainly just concerned about paying my bills, paying rent and everything. And then, so then during this time, I was just applying to all kinds of jobs, literally even jobs that weren't even matching my skill set or anything.
00:02:37.804 - 00:02:58.840, Speaker B: I was just trying to sort of apply for anything. And then I was just getting rejected from everything. I think it was just a tough time because of the pandemic and everything, but to just make myself feel more fulfilled and productive during this time, I started creating artwork in my free time and just to make myself feel a bit better, as in, did you consider.
00:02:58.912 - 00:03:05.792, Speaker A: Yourself, you know, you were a graphic designer. Did you consider yourself an artist when you were a graphic designer? Is there, like, a shift that happened?
00:03:05.888 - 00:03:53.910, Speaker B: I always considered myself an artist. I think everybody is to some degree. I know that sounds cheesy and lame or whatever, but I do think that everybody is creative, right? It doesn't matter what kind of medium you're using, if you're a coder, you're still a creative person, you know? And so I've always been a creative soul, obviously. But, you know, previously, I think the way I saw it was just I was training my skillset to execute somebody else's creative vision. And then during that time when, you know, I think people think of it as an artist was just me executing on my own creative visions. So just using my skill set to translate the creative thoughts in my brain onto a canvas or digital software. And so, anyways, during this time, I had created my art account called people pleaser, and it was just sort of a self expression hobby.
00:03:54.022 - 00:04:03.114, Speaker A: Stop for a second. Like, people pleaser. Like, I'm a people pleaser, so it resonates with me. And I've got a daughter that's a people pleaser. But, like, why people pleaser?
00:04:03.494 - 00:04:27.974, Speaker B: Just like you said, it's just my personality. That's just who I am. And when I was making the account, it was just one of those moments where I really needed an idea, and I didn't want it to be like, oh, I have to put my phone down and think about it for another two days or something. I just wanted to just create an account right then and there. You know, it was one of those things where I was like, maybe I just create one now. I can always change the name later or something. I mean, that just didn't end up happening.
00:04:28.014 - 00:04:33.614, Speaker A: When you're like a 98 year old woman and your grandkids or great grandkids are around, they're gonna be like, people pleaser.
00:04:33.734 - 00:04:41.238, Speaker B: Yeah, basically, it literally just stuck. I didn't even have time to change it or even improve it or anything. And then here we are.
00:04:41.286 - 00:04:43.438, Speaker A: I love alliterations, so that's a good, good choice.
00:04:43.526 - 00:05:19.988, Speaker B: Oh, thank you. Yeah, so then I created that, and then was just sort of, you know, using that as a form of self expression and just to buy time while I was applying for jobs. And then that was also happened to be the summer of Defi. And so one of my good friends, who's really deep in the crypto space, which I didn't even know this about him, reached out to me that summer and was just like, hey, do you know that something really crazy is happening in crypto right now? Because, you know, obviously through the 2019, like, bear market, I think a lot a of lot of people had just kind of forgotten about crypto. And then he's like, but something really crazy is happening. You should check it out. And then, so I went on crypto Twitter, and then was just browsing around and stuff.
00:05:19.988 - 00:05:59.238, Speaker B: And then I realized a lot of people are promoting things using memes, but nobody has, you know, they're all made using, like, Microsoft paint or something, and none of these are actually really high quality promotional assets. And then, so I just, as a joke, said to my friend, I was like, I'm so desperate for a job or income. They should just pay me to do these memes or something. I could totally do it better. My friend took that to heart and then dmed somebody from urine finance at the time. And then basically they saw my art Instagram and then reached out to see if I wanted to collaborate on something. And then I made my first sort of animated short for Defi, and then the rest is history.
00:05:59.238 - 00:06:43.526, Speaker B: And so my op ed in fortune just kind of talks about how not only that, crypto and Defi sort of opened up a new means of investment for me because that's originally what drew me to it, but also just that the whole community of people are just so welcoming, and they're very passionate, and yet they're just not afraid to prop people up. Because I feel like in the traditional world, so much of everything that we do is based on credentials or connections or who, you know, and even the NFT space started like that as well. And when I jumped into crypto, Defi, you know, I had no followers on anywhere, like, on Instagram or Twitter. I had, like, zero followers. But people don't. They don't really care. I mean, this is obvious with all the anonymous profiles on there, you can literally not be a person.
00:06:43.526 - 00:06:59.030, Speaker B: But as long as you're putting out good work they don't care what you look like, where you come from, who you know. If you're doing cool stuff, people will notice and not be shy about propping you up. And I think that's really sort of what changed my life about the space, and I'm really grateful for that.
00:06:59.062 - 00:07:43.084, Speaker A: It's cool because in the NFT space, more than almost any other in crypto, the community seem really supportive. When I think about what's gone on in the last 15 years, really, even in the world, decentralization has a lot of advantages, but it's a lot of disadvantage. We have this balkanization of the world, and in a lot of the crypto protocols, it's like war between one british soccer team and the next. And it's funny, don't see that in NFTs as much. You definitely look at, like, the art blocks community or your community. You definitely see huge support systems, which is a nice change of breath.
00:07:43.544 - 00:07:57.096, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. I see it as almost an inversion of control where now it's sort of just this whole concept of being creator first and supporting the underdogs and that kind of stuff, which I think is.
00:07:57.120 - 00:08:17.538, Speaker A: Really cool, which cuts into the crypto ethos. Right? Yeah, it's a little bit of, you know, screw the establishment. Speaking of the establishment, two weekends, three weekends ago, I drank too much again, and I, with Emily and a few other crypto degens, crashed a pretty established dinner party.
00:08:17.666 - 00:08:18.482, Speaker B: That was amazing.
00:08:18.538 - 00:08:43.962, Speaker A: I thought it was a cocktail party. It turned out to be a sit down dinner for 82 beautiful tables of 40 very fancy art people. And then they had a kids table they set up at the last minute for us. I threw Emily to the lions and put her on stage, and she crushed it. But what I thought was really interesting to me, you could talk about it was in a really nice way. You kind of said, we don't really need you guys. These are the richest people in the world, literally the richest art collectors in the world.
00:08:43.962 - 00:08:55.002, Speaker A: And she wasn't being rude. She was like, our community wants to celebrate our artists and support our artists. And the crypto community has gotten pretty damn wealthy. And so talk a little bit about that.
00:08:55.058 - 00:09:54.242, Speaker B: Yeah. So for a lot of people who maybe were first acquainted with me, or sort of like my magnum opus happened in March when I auctioned off one of my. It was my first NFT auction ever, actually, and it was an animated piece that I had made for the unisot V three launch. And basically what happened was, I guess, all of my fans or Internet friends who had known me throughout DeFi summer and appreciated my work and everything, and also obviously became wealthy through crypto and stuff, came together and formed what is called a dao, a decentralized, autonomous organization. Named it after me because I guess this was the first time that this had happened where a dao was formed just specifically to go bid on a piece. And then, so I guess this was sort of a really standout event to the entire community and really fell under the whole ethereum ethos about decentralization, community and collectivism and everything. And so it was kind of a really special moment.
00:09:54.242 - 00:10:27.322, Speaker B: And I guess this is sort of what I explained over at that dinner was just, people are, through crypto now are able to pool together funds really quickly and efficiently in a way that was never possible in a traditional financial or just any kind of system. And so, yeah, in a way, it's like this even applies to like film, right? So recently I collaborated with like Linda Hsieh from Scalar Capital and this production team too, that they're doing the Ethereum documentary.
00:10:27.378 - 00:10:28.354, Speaker A: Yeah, the crowdsource.
00:10:28.474 - 00:10:38.082, Speaker B: We crowdsourced it using a series of nfts that I had made, and we raised over $2 million in 48 hours. And so, because if you've ever made.
00:10:38.098 - 00:10:42.730, Speaker A: A documentary, it is brutal to raise $2 million. It's a brutal, brutal task.
00:10:42.842 - 00:11:23.386, Speaker B: It is. And so, you know, like, even now, I think sometimes there's often people like from the traditional world, like, let's say the film industry or something, seeing that, they think, okay, web3 is the future. We want our seat at the table too. How do we find somewhere to fit ourselves in? And they maybe would come to me and be like, we want to produce something for you. We can finance their angles, we can finance it for you. And then I would the same thing, tell them the nicest way. I actually don't need financing because obviously with decentralization and crypto now, it's like, and I have my own audience, I think I can just do the same thing like I did for the Ethereum film, for example, and just drop nfts.
00:11:23.386 - 00:11:53.590, Speaker B: And then it could be crowdfunded, you know? So I think it's interesting to note this sort of inversion of control or just sort of the shift in power from wealthy individuals to a collective. I mean, I think still somewhat wealthy, but, you know, you don't have to be a gazillionaire to sort of dominate the film industry to do something cool, right? And that's what makes this space so exciting. And that's similar to what I touched on at that dinner, it's kind of cool.
00:11:53.622 - 00:12:17.734, Speaker A: Like, you know, if you think about pleaserdao, really one of the first daos to do one artist, and now it's grown into a much bigger organization or a bigger. A bigger fund. It's almost like a collective fund that token holders own shares in, but also crowdsourcing the documentary. You're kind of cutting edge. Did you always grow cutting edge? Did you have funky haircuts and, like, dye your hair purple?
00:12:18.114 - 00:12:47.530, Speaker B: I think I was always kind of weird, probably growing up, and I do hope that, you know, growing up, even in school projects, you grew up where I grew up in. So I lived up until probably, like, you know, like, end of elementary school when I was in Vancouver, like, Canada, and then I moved back to Taiwan, where I stayed until I was about 18, and then I came out to the US for college, so I kind of split my time, you know?
00:12:47.562 - 00:12:58.162, Speaker A: Is Taiwan, like, Korea's edgy? Like, I've been to Korea a lot. I haven't been to Taiwan since my first baby was born, who's 26. This was a long time. Was growing up in Taiwan edgy at all, or.
00:12:58.258 - 00:13:30.648, Speaker B: I wouldn't say it was edgy. Yeah. So I don't think that location wise, I was growing up anywhere edgy, but just in school projects and stuff, I always tried to do things in a more creative way. Maybe that's just how my brain works, or I find it boring otherwise. And so, yeah, hopefully it almost felt, like, very serendipitous for almost an accident that I fell into where I am today in the industry. But, yeah, hopefully I won't take it for granted and continue to do new and cool things, or cutting edge, as you would say.
00:13:30.776 - 00:13:33.536, Speaker A: Talk about pleaserdow a little bit. Like, they've done some cool stuff.
00:13:33.680 - 00:13:46.756, Speaker B: So it's literally. Yeah. Collective of prominent individuals within the defi space and crypto. There's a lot of founders, builders, passionate crypto people.
00:13:46.780 - 00:13:50.292, Speaker A: Is it like a secret society? No one tells who's in it? Kind of like skull and bones at.
00:13:50.308 - 00:14:13.802, Speaker B: Yale, you can actually see the full members list on their website. But, I mean, yeah, because they sort of operate as a collective. So it's not like there are certain pretty prominent individuals in there saying, robert Leshner is in it, Suzu is in it. I'm Stani from Aave, Leighton from pulled together. I mean, I could go on.
00:14:13.858 - 00:14:35.604, Speaker A: Emily told me I could get into pleasers about four months ago, and I, like, dropped the ball and I stumbled. I was busy. It literally is. Talk about how crazy. This space is. I had a benefit for criminal justice reform, of all things, but a bunch of NFT artists showed up for various reasons, and I got pictures of them. And if I had just bought the nfTs, if I join pleaser now, right.
00:14:35.604 - 00:14:42.672, Speaker A: Alexey Cherniak was there. Ringers were literally selling for almost nothing, and now they're selling for millions.
00:14:42.728 - 00:14:43.416, Speaker B: I know.
00:14:43.560 - 00:14:44.600, Speaker A: All in four months.
00:14:44.672 - 00:14:53.400, Speaker B: Yeah. It's crazy. This space moves so fast. It's like crypto time dilation. Right. One month on crypto feels like six months in the real world.
00:14:53.472 - 00:14:54.844, Speaker A: God, I'm getting old fast.
00:14:56.544 - 00:14:59.842, Speaker B: Same. Don't worry, we're all going down together.
00:15:00.018 - 00:15:02.690, Speaker A: Do you collect nfts?
00:15:02.762 - 00:15:03.494, Speaker B: I do.
00:15:04.714 - 00:15:06.578, Speaker A: Outside of the pleaserdao?
00:15:06.626 - 00:15:35.084, Speaker B: Sure. Outside of pleaserdao? Yeah, I mean, just inside pleaserdao. Just to sort of point out the main pieces that they've collected is the one of one by Edward Snowden for 5.5 million, the original doge meme image that was collected for 4 million and recently fractionalized. They also obviously kind of clocked my uniswap piece, which is their first purchase ever. And also the one on one from the Tor project by exchells. That one went for 2 million.
00:15:35.084 - 00:15:43.524, Speaker B: And recently a new piece that I can almost talk about, but it's going to be huge.
00:15:43.604 - 00:15:44.292, Speaker A: Almost talking about.
00:15:44.308 - 00:15:47.148, Speaker B: Yeah, almost. It's coming, but it's going to be.
00:15:47.196 - 00:15:48.812, Speaker A: Everybody get ready because you're going to.
00:15:48.828 - 00:15:51.500, Speaker B: Blow you away, probably. Yeah. And then.
00:15:51.532 - 00:15:54.028, Speaker A: I am terrible at keeping secrets, and I've kept this secret.
00:15:54.196 - 00:15:56.220, Speaker B: I'm so glad that you did.
00:15:56.252 - 00:15:59.124, Speaker A: And I'm the worst secret keeper on the planet.
00:15:59.164 - 00:16:20.808, Speaker B: Me too, actually. So, you know, I probably because we're people pleasers. We are. Yeah. Just succumb to peer pressure, I guess. But on a personal level, I love just collecting, honestly, not even as investments, just pieces that I think are cool. Recently, I collected these really cute Pokemon illustrations, and I also collected a few.
00:16:20.808 - 00:16:25.248, Speaker B: I mean, I have two bored apes. I minted them, though, so I didn't, like, spend a lot of money on.
00:16:25.256 - 00:16:26.024, Speaker A: Them, which is good.
00:16:26.104 - 00:16:29.288, Speaker B: I used to have five, but then I only have two now.
00:16:29.336 - 00:16:30.896, Speaker A: We were saying Steph Curry today.
00:16:31.080 - 00:16:31.608, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:31.696 - 00:16:51.110, Speaker A: I bought one and made it his avatar, his profile pic. And so when you think about culture, first Jay Z with the cryptopunk, and I told everyone, you got to buy a cryptopunk. I didn't buy one myself, like an idiot. And now Steph Curry, and so biggest names in culture moving into our space. It's really freaking cool.
00:16:51.182 - 00:17:04.238, Speaker B: I know. It was crazy when Mike Tyson made his profile picture a cool cat, and it's still the cool cat. I think it's hilarious, first of all. But yeah, it's honestly really wild because I think, you know, both.
00:17:04.286 - 00:17:10.030, Speaker A: I need to get a profile and I'm panicked to pick the right one. I tweeted, I waited too long.
00:17:10.102 - 00:17:15.474, Speaker B: I tweeted recently saying, if you're not using an NFT as your profile picture, you're not gonna make it.
00:17:16.134 - 00:17:22.406, Speaker A: I feel huge nervousness every night. Within the next two weeks, I'm going to have an NFT as my profile pick.
00:17:22.510 - 00:17:23.286, Speaker B: Yes.
00:17:23.470 - 00:17:30.190, Speaker A: People send me NFTs myself, but they're all kind of a little weird looking. I don't make nearly as good of a cartoon as I thought I would.
00:17:30.342 - 00:17:44.180, Speaker B: Well, actually, I recently went and splurged on an NFT. I spent 20 ETH on this really dope piece of art by this taiwanese artist and then made it my profile picture. So that's my biggest flexible, I guess. Nice.
00:17:44.372 - 00:17:46.548, Speaker A: Nice. What's next?
00:17:46.676 - 00:18:22.198, Speaker B: I don't know, actually, my, I think, you know, I was saying, like, crypto moves so fast, I feel like, you know, I could think something and then the next day my life goes a completely different direction. I'm sure everyone in the industry relates to this, but I think my sort of north Star or guiding light here is just to hopefully use my platform and my voice and area of influence to spread crypto positivity and elevate the community somehow and just, yeah, like, do cool, cutting edge things that are not boomer and utilizes technology. Yeah, those are the kinds of things that I'm interested in.
00:18:22.286 - 00:18:27.526, Speaker A: I keep telling people I identify as Gen Z, but damn it, my art collection is a little more boomer.
00:18:27.670 - 00:19:19.480, Speaker B: I do actually have something coming up very, very soon, which you should come to the dinner for, by the way. It's basically, I did a collaboration piece with Steve Aoki, and it's gonna be a one of one where he scored the music, I did the visuals, and we're auctioning it off at Sotheby's fairly soon, sometime this month. And part of the proceeds are going to go towards, basically, me and Steve are going to create a vault that we're going to use to purchase NFTs from up and coming female artists. Because I also feel like this is something in the space that I really want to address is just, why are there no other female art? I mean, there are, but just all the prominent NFT artists are predominantly male. And I really want that to change because that's something that obviously happens in traditional art, like fine art world already, and, well, we have a chance to start over.
00:19:19.512 - 00:19:20.192, Speaker A: Yeah, start over.
00:19:20.248 - 00:19:40.672, Speaker B: Set new ground rules. Right. So hopefully the idea behind this fund is that, you know, when Steve and I will go and curate and then collect from, let's say, an up and coming female artist, and then we'll both. He'll use his audience, I'll use mine. We can tweet and endorse them and hopefully bring some light to their work and maybe change some lives. Who knows?
00:19:40.728 - 00:20:02.568, Speaker A: I met Steve Aoki. I love the guy. We honored him at a wrestling benefit. His father, Raki Okey, was a great, great wrestler before he founded Benihana. And so I had the whole Olympic team and Steve jumped into one of his jumps and then they were literally holding him like a young baby. He's so tiny in terms of weight. And these were giant wrestlers.
00:20:02.568 - 00:20:08.456, Speaker A: But I have some amazing pitchers. We actually should make it in that team of, like, Steve jumping with the entire jumping team. Really?
00:20:08.480 - 00:20:11.768, Speaker B: Is that where the inspiration for all his jumping photos came from?
00:20:11.776 - 00:20:13.324, Speaker A: No, he was already a jumper.
