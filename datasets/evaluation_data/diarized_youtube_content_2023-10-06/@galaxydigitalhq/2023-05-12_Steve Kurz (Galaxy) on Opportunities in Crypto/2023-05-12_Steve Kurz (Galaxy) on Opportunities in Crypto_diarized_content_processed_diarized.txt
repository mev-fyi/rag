00:00:04.520 - 00:00:18.310, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. Steady, lads. We never practice or rehearse. Yo, the market is a sentence and we're destined. We serve. Yeah, we'll spark it. And our guest is my friend, Steve Kurz.
00:00:18.310 - 00:00:56.678, Speaker A: Opensees and blurs battling for first ordinals, absurd transaction fees. Observe miners making bank and stablecoins on curve us policy demurred. Yo, when will we learn that the future isn't obvious? It has to be seized telling almost my audience we have to be freed. It's getting kind of scary. The count of intermediaries is it fair? Did we find ourselves in something hairy? Truth or dare, we always paying our dues? See me bending some spoons while I'm playing our tunes? Walk a day in our shoes and flip a coin on its head, you'll see there's never been a day when bitcoiners are dead. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmware research at Galaxy Digital. Thank you for listening to galaxy brains.
00:00:56.678 - 00:01:21.044, Speaker A: We have a great show for you today. Steve Kurzweil, head of Galaxy Asset management, he's our guest. We're going to get into a whole bunch of interesting stuff, including new partnerships that Galaxy Asset management has what they think in the bear market, big opportunities are. Also talk to Steve about the early days of Galaxy. He's an OG, been at Galaxy for six years at this point. It's a great interview you won't want to miss. We'll also check in with our friend bin Mattabibi from Galaxy trading, as always, on markets and macro.
00:01:21.044 - 00:01:45.990, Speaker A: But before we get into all of that, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to the disclaimer in the podcast notes.

00:01:45.990 - 00:01:52.022, Speaker A: All right, let's get right into the podcast. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet, a BB from Galaxy trading. As always, Bibnet, great to see you.
00:01:52.078 - 00:01:53.174, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:01:53.294 - 00:01:58.078, Speaker A: So I guess this. So we're recording this on a Tuesday this week, a little bit of travel plans.
00:01:58.166 - 00:02:00.086, Speaker B: You're throwing me completely off.
00:02:00.190 - 00:02:31.196, Speaker A: So it's going to be a little bit before the big number this week, which is CPI. So just for our listeners, we're unaware of the result of that number, but a lot of other stuff to talk about. I'm just looking at the block clock behind me. We're sort of at the bottom of the recent channel or near the bottom of it. We're still up there in that area. We've been, I think if you look at the chart for bitcoin, we've cycled from like 27 to 30 a bunch of times, but we're sort of down what's happening in traditional markets. That's been interesting since we last talked last week.
00:02:31.390 - 00:03:13.632, Speaker B: So the main focus for the market has still remained kind of the regional banking crisis. So in terms of people's perception of that and the outlook going forward, we got a new piece of data this week. It was the loan officer survey, the April loan officer survey, and it basically showed what we had been expecting, which is a tightening of lending standards, basically a credit crutch crunch, especially within certain sectors. So it confirmed what people had expected, which was the failure of major banks led to systemic issues, is going to lead to tighter credit conditions.
00:03:13.768 - 00:03:22.244, Speaker A: And those tighter credit conditions almost have like a, they have a tightening effect overall. So does that help the Fed in their, should they decide to pause hiking?
00:03:23.184 - 00:03:53.344, Speaker B: Absolutely. It will certainly put a strain on small businesses. I'll put a strain on employment. I'll help them achieve their sort of inflation mandate. However, I am a bit skeptical of the market's interpretation right now. Basically, the market has multiple cuts priced into this year, particularly into q one of next year. You've got a lot of cuts priced in more than three.
00:03:53.344 - 00:04:20.668, Speaker B: I disagree with it, particularly on the back of some of the really robust labor market data that we've gotten. To give you an example, I mean, non farm payrolls, this on Friday came out at 235,000 jobs added. Right. It's a huge ad, but let's ignore the fact that we added those jobs. The average hourly earnings came in at like half a percent month on month.
00:04:20.836 - 00:04:21.140, Speaker A: Right.
00:04:21.172 - 00:04:57.120, Speaker B: That's a really strong reading. And the other employment data we've gotten, we had unit labor costs that surprised higher. We had the employment cost index surprised higher. This was all last week. So basically every reading for the labor market that you've gotten says it's still really hot. And then on top of that, even when you get bad pieces of data like the regional fed surveys and the manufacturers get asked about how things are going, they're like, oh, the activity's bad, but labor market's still tight. I'm still having issues retaining employees still have to pay them really high rates.
00:04:57.120 - 00:05:34.370, Speaker B: Interesting when they have pricing power. And so we're in a world where the unemployment rate is 3.4% and people have pricing power in their jobs. Not just there are tons of jobs out there and available, but it's like you have negotiating power. And what is the stickiest part of inflation? What is the part that the Fed's most concerned about? It's the services inflation, the stuff ex shelter core services, basically. And that stuff is super sticky. But that's actually a pretty good segue onto what we're expecting to see for this month's figure.
00:05:34.370 - 00:06:14.810, Speaker B: And this month's figure is all about core CPI. The median expectation is for 36 month on month, but there's a distribution of analysts, there's a heavy distribution towards zero point four s and even some to 0.5s. There's been a rebound in owner's equivalent rent. And from what we see from the high frequency data, like rental prices are starting to tick back up again. We've also seen used auto prices start to tick back up again. And so there could be another pretty material inflation upside surprise happening this week.
00:06:14.922 - 00:06:15.634, Speaker A: Oh, man.
00:06:15.754 - 00:07:01.328, Speaker B: And that's not going to be good for risk assets. But at the same time, it's such a weird place because everybody's like, wait, okay, if the Fed's only response to really hot data is raising rates, what does that do? That further exacerbates the banking issues and that lowers your growth in the long run. So curve should be flatter, and you should also be pricing in more cuts in the back half of the year, et cetera. It's a very interesting dynamic. And then you throw in the debt ceiling, which is obviously a very topical issue at the moment. But yeah, it's a very challenging macro environment. Lots of uncertainty, and that means you're going to get lots of volatility.
00:07:01.328 - 00:07:16.808, Speaker B: And I don't think crypto is going to be any different. You've definitely had material volatility over the past couple of weeks. Some of it's headline driven, some of it's liquidation driven, et cetera. But volume crypto is realizing a lot.
00:07:16.856 - 00:07:19.504, Speaker A: We're going to get some volume up, volume down.
00:07:19.624 - 00:08:13.864, Speaker B: I think you're in that environment. I don't think it's going to be straight line up, you know, as it has been, you know, this year. And right now, you know, risk reward looks relatively decent. However, you have an inflation number that could literally rock the world, change the entire, at the same time, like, I think people continue to need to realize that, like, you have to price in the right tail for assets as much as you have to price in the left tail, or like there's a distribution, people stop thinking about the right tail as much. We're on the cusp of the Fed ending tightening altogether. The S and P earlier this week was testing new highs and Nasdaq breaking out. If we're in an environment for sure where inflation's headed the right way and we're confident in it, and we know that the central bank pressures are about to ease, that's a major boon for risk assets.
00:08:13.864 - 00:09:07.032, Speaker B: I think that part of the distribution of bitcoin is lost on a lot of people, especially in the scenario where you do actually have the debt ceiling stuff come to fruition in a more meaningful way. I look at bitcoin as an asset. It's done really well this year. But at the same time, if you're telling me we're going to go back to a world where inflation's not an issue because we've collapsed the economy, credit crunch is happening in the back half of this year. We're going to cut 100 basis points and change, Europe's going to stop hiking, etcetera, deflation that they're trying to deal with, et cetera. I'm like, well, that's actually a pretty good environment to own. Super robust bitcoin or gold or hard money.
00:09:07.032 - 00:09:09.224, Speaker B: Super robust. I think that's probably the.
00:09:09.304 - 00:10:00.152, Speaker A: Yeah, wow, it's definitely a lot of stuff mixing together here. I think back a year ago, I think about one year ago was really the beginning of the true collapse of the crypto credit complex. I'll say. I think you had Luna in May, you had three AC in June, and then of course, the lenders that followed those events and then ultimately FTX. What does it look like now to you as someone who trades in these markets? The infrastructure scene, obviously it's smaller, but it's, gosh, it's such a different, it's such a different time. Obviously, macro we knew was getting more, was entering a tightening cycle then, but we didn't like, you know, wasn't as. We weren't nearly as far along in it.
00:10:00.152 - 00:10:00.448, Speaker A: Right?
00:10:00.496 - 00:10:30.364, Speaker B: Yeah, no, absolutely. I think there have been notable changes to the market structure over the past twelve months, particularly with respect to how credit is extended and what jurisdiction credit is extended as well. I think taking a step back, one of the reasons that crypto did so well over time was because of exchanges like FTX that gave you liquidity on alts and other things.
00:10:30.744 - 00:10:31.576, Speaker A: We've talked about that.
00:10:31.600 - 00:10:32.360, Speaker B: And leverage. Right?
00:10:32.392 - 00:10:32.512, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:10:32.528 - 00:10:36.248, Speaker A: The derivatives there, the derivatives number of names they covered.
00:10:36.336 - 00:11:06.604, Speaker B: Absolutely. And so, generally speaking, when you increase the liquidity of an instrument, it attracts more and more capital. Right. If I know that I can hedge an alt position that's illiquid, I'm more likely to buy it because I know I can go just if I'm able to trade the perp, I would go trade the perp. And so I'd be less worried about having an illiquid alt. Right. If I wanted to speculate on alts long or to the short side, I want to do it in a very capital efficient way.
00:11:06.604 - 00:11:34.496, Speaker B: And so generally, liquidity breeds size and it breeds more market participants and further adoption, etcetera. I think derivatives have a very important place in our marketplace, and they have an important place in every other market. They help with tons of things. I think the fact that Coinbase and Gemini are opening these offshore exchanges are going to be tremendously valuable to the.
00:11:34.520 - 00:11:36.224, Speaker A: Space, to the global crypto space.
00:11:36.264 - 00:12:03.224, Speaker B: The global crypto space. It's going to make it more capital efficient. It's going to make it so that people feel more comfortable trading alts around because there's more than one platform to trade them. If all of your, your perp risk is concentrated on one exchange, you're going to take less of perp risk. But now, if you can spread out your counterparty risk, it helps you do that. And so I think the additions of Coinbase is offshore. Gemini is a pretty big deal for.
00:12:03.264 - 00:12:06.480, Speaker A: Markets for the global crypto market, which is an extremely global market, by the way.
00:12:06.512 - 00:12:15.808, Speaker B: An incredibly global market. Yeah, but, yeah, and I see the tide turning from the US every day and it's pretty dramatic.
00:12:15.856 - 00:12:16.830, Speaker A: Yeah, I hate to see that.
00:12:16.912 - 00:12:37.826, Speaker B: You hate to see it. But at the end of the day, like, I keep thinking about, like, you know, I was having a conversation about with somebody today that hires folks in Argentina. And one of the interesting points is that I was highlighting during the conversation was, yeah, look at bitcoin and Argentina. Peso denomination. Yeah, new all time high. Yeah, new all time high.
00:12:37.850 - 00:12:38.858, Speaker A: Very different environment there.
00:12:38.906 - 00:13:02.098, Speaker B: Right. And so, you know, we think in the western world in dollarized ways, but, you know, versus a lot of like, em, currencies and like, versus, you know, rates that you have to pay in terms of capital controls, et cetera. You know, bitcoin's still incredibly attractive. And like, I mean, there's just new good things like Liechtenstein today. Like you can pay your taxes and, you know, so I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go to Vodou.
00:13:02.146 - 00:13:04.682, Speaker A: It's a country. It's a very small country, but it is a country.
00:13:04.778 - 00:13:10.538, Speaker B: But like, you know, they're part of the european financial system. Trade in swiss francs, like, you know.
00:13:10.586 - 00:13:36.900, Speaker A: No, I agree. I think we've talked about this to the future of the american dollar and the current, like, sort of precarious geopolitical situation that exists and how bitcoin is a really interesting, like, gold is really interesting asset, particularly because it can actually use it, right? I mean, if you have gold, like, great. Like, I hope you have it on your person or like, you really trust, like the vault from somewhere that it is stored. No, but you can't pay with it globally. You can't send it instantly.
00:13:37.052 - 00:14:22.948, Speaker B: I mean, basically the essence of money globally comes down to the idea that the US can print infinite amounts of money and people still want dollars and people still want to buy us debt. The moment that loses its significance or that statement is no longer true, that's when you'll actually start to see de dollarization. But for the time being, it's really tough. But the philosophical argument gets stronger by the day. Every bit that gets added to the deficit. I mean, just think about this banking crisis. They basically had to blanket guarantee all deposits for this banking crisis not to happen.
00:14:22.948 - 00:14:36.942, Speaker B: And now if you ask a government official, are all deposits guaranteed by the FDIC? They'll be like, no, but in theory it's like, will the US ever allow depositor to not be made whole in banks?
00:14:36.958 - 00:14:38.078, Speaker A: It'd be a big crisis of confidence.
00:14:38.166 - 00:15:08.436, Speaker B: It'd be a huge crisis of confidence. And so now you're at the point where this is the thing that I'm trying to stress is you have a huge, like, moral hazard issue. And it's also like, why would anybody put money in one of these large g sips anymore? Like, if the government's coming and telling you that your deposits are safe at these regional banks, go wherever the rates are highest, why aren't people just navigating to. And it will happen over time. And personally, like, you know, I think these big banks, like, they're going to have it coming to them.
00:15:08.460 - 00:15:09.804, Speaker A: It's going to be an interesting dynamic.
00:15:09.924 - 00:15:16.396, Speaker B: I mean, six months from now, they're, you know, deposits in general are going to go down. The marketplace is going to get much more competitive.
00:15:16.460 - 00:15:49.580, Speaker A: And that's good, right? Overall, it's good. Strange to think that. Cause it's. They're denying that. That's the policy. The officials are right, but it's normally the criticism of the banking regulators, the Fed, whomever in these situations is that their policies result in the centralization of banking power into the too big to fails. But your point is that if there is either an explicit or de facto blanket deposit insurance provided to everyone, that could actually decentralize the banking system more, which could be bad for the big banks.
00:15:49.580 - 00:15:50.572, Speaker A: It's an interesting.
00:15:50.708 - 00:15:52.572, Speaker B: It'd be very bad for the big banks.
00:15:52.668 - 00:15:56.716, Speaker A: All right, well, this is great conversation. We're gonna talk more next week. It might be remote.
00:15:56.740 - 00:15:57.972, Speaker B: Can we have another 15 minutes?
00:15:58.028 - 00:15:59.964, Speaker A: No, dude, I could go.
00:16:00.044 - 00:16:00.716, Speaker B: I could go.
00:16:00.780 - 00:16:11.652, Speaker A: Bibnet Abibi from Galaxy trading, my friend, as always, thank you so much. Let's go now to our guest, Steve Kerrs, head of Galaxy Asset management. Steve, it's been a long time in the making. Great to have you on galaxy brains, finally. Yeah, I mean, I've been asking.
00:16:11.708 - 00:16:12.916, Speaker C: You had to go through all the brains.
00:16:12.980 - 00:16:15.676, Speaker A: Apparently, you're busy doing running a real business.
00:16:15.780 - 00:16:18.180, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, I listen every week. I'm a fan.
00:16:18.252 - 00:16:18.860, Speaker A: I appreciate that.
00:16:18.892 - 00:16:20.984, Speaker C: Honored not to mess it up.
00:16:21.844 - 00:16:29.412, Speaker A: Well, okay, before we get into it, we got a bunch of interesting topics. Why don't you tell us, like, how long have you been at Galaxy? Cause I. As far as I. Certainly before me.
00:16:29.508 - 00:16:40.428, Speaker C: Crypto years. A lot of crypto years. Six real years. So 2017. Yeah. I used to work with Mike at Fortress back in the day. Got it in my trad days, and he took me down the bitcoin rabbit hole in 2017.
00:16:40.516 - 00:16:42.260, Speaker A: So you got orange pilled by Mike Novogratz.
00:16:42.292 - 00:16:58.504, Speaker C: I did get pretty elite. Two things I'm thanking Mike for. One is get me out of Lehman brothers to Fortress in September of 2008. And the second was introducing me to bitcoin. I'm very thankful to Mike, and we had a plan. We kind of stuck to it. Lots of ups and downs and some funny stories.
00:16:59.124 - 00:17:23.264, Speaker A: Definitely been a wild ride since 2017. So you've seen. So you saw the 2017 bull market at what would become galaxy, I guess, at the time. Then you went through the, what we called the crypto winter, which, I mean, I went through it also, but I mean. And then you did the last bull run, which was crazy. And now we're in whatever we're in now. What is it like? I mean, what does that feel like? How do you.
00:17:23.384 - 00:17:32.860, Speaker C: What's interesting is the last bear market. So if you came from tradfi, the last bear market, you got a lot of, you know, pats on the head and, like, it's okay that you tried something different.
00:17:32.972 - 00:17:34.164, Speaker A: Come back to papa.
00:17:34.324 - 00:17:50.100, Speaker C: Yeah, a lot of that. Then during the bull run, you know, can I get a job? Can my kid get a job? And now, actually, none of that. And I think that's because people kind of have this understanding that even though I don't get it yet, I know it's not going away. And so you're onto something, but you didn't, you know.
00:17:50.132 - 00:17:50.796, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, it didn't.
00:17:50.860 - 00:17:51.804, Speaker C: You still have to work.
00:17:51.924 - 00:18:05.712, Speaker A: You got a bear market now. But, like, it's not like, yeah, you're right. After 17, it felt like, oh, this was literally just a total speculative mania. They were literally saying, tulip bubble. Still a tulip bubble. You don't hear tulips often anymore. No.
00:18:05.728 - 00:18:36.244, Speaker C: And look, I think we're going to get to some of this, but if you think about coming out of the last bear cycle, really, it was bitcoin and ETH. I don't mean, for all the crypto natives know that it's more than that, but that's, from an institutional perspective, what came out of the ashes from the 99% that went away, bitcoin and ETH. This time, it's not just bitcoin and ETH. And so when the institutions, even if they don't understand it, stables defi nfts bitcoin, ETH, maybe they understand L2s, right? Secondaries. Like, there's all these things that are just evidence that this is different than the last.
00:18:36.544 - 00:18:45.696, Speaker A: It's a much more robust market in general, and not just even the coins, to your point, talking about secondaries, the companies that have been built, all the venture money that's been invested, and the.
00:18:45.720 - 00:19:16.150, Speaker C: Institutional knowledge, we spent so much time, it's so obvious now, you can get an auditor. Maybe not a bank, but you can get an auditor, you can get a custodian. And back then, we literally treated KPMG and Deloitte like the biggest clients in the world because they needed to know what it was before they could work with you. And so there was a lot of foundational meetings that did nothing for you commercially, but that were a prerequisite for not just us, but for any institutional players to feel safe coming into the space. And so we feel like we were a good part of that, actually.
00:19:16.222 - 00:19:24.706, Speaker A: So, Galaxy Asset Management, one of the three business units now, business lines at Galaxy, what is gam?
00:19:24.890 - 00:20:23.644, Speaker C: Well, what we want to be and what we think we're becoming is a safe space for institutions to play in crypto. And I think from the beginning, we had this idea that there wasn't a true asset management platform. So think the blackstone of, and I hate using those analogies because we all obviously agree in a world where asset management is on chain. But what was interesting five years ago, six years ago, was when you do the two by two matrix. On the one axis, it's crypto underlying versus traditional underlying, and on the other axis, it's traditional structure versus crypto structure. Everyone in crypto was going to the quadrant that said tokenized wrapper around crypto underlying, and we sort of looked at our target client base, which is institutional allocators and institutional wealth players and consultants and all these large money centers. And we said they're never going to get to the bottom right of the two by two if you don't start at the quadrant that has traditional wrappers around crypto underlying.
00:20:23.644 - 00:20:46.306, Speaker C: So we took this, we've taken this long journey where we're both educating these clients about what crypto is and isn't and which pieces are worth paying attention and which are investable. And then we've taken another hard journey, which is, let's wrap crypto in private fund wrappers, ETF's, et cetera, meet them where they are, and then over time, bring everyone to the promised land that we all believe so much in.
00:20:46.460 - 00:20:59.430, Speaker A: So what types of, I guess, products do you guys offer, then? I mean, I'm hearing very clearly, like, the bitcoin fund, right? A traditional wrapper on a crypto asset. But what else have you guys put?
00:20:59.462 - 00:21:23.850, Speaker C: Yeah, so we're two and a half billion of Aum, and we have three different buckets. It's passive, it's active, and it's venture. And I think each of those buckets has a unique sort of duration to it. It has a unique set of portfolio characteristics. And we think different institutions and different investors want different things from crypto. Some think of it as a diversifier for a hedge fund bucket. Some think of it as the venture bet that we all also think it is.
00:21:23.850 - 00:22:03.574, Speaker C: And some think of it as the coins themselves. We think it's all of those things. We think crypto is more than an asset, more than an asset class. But both of those things are also true. And so what we want to do is give, we have about a dozen strategies, choices, and you don't have to pick one fund that does everything for galaxy. You could put our bitcoin fund with our venture fund, or you could put our fundamental, long only fund alongside an index as an example. And I think over time, hopefully, the wisdom, I think that's probably a little cocky to say now, but what we think will happen over time is that's where the $250 million checks and the $500 million checks will be deployed, not just in one mega fund, but rather in a more sleeved way.
00:22:03.574 - 00:22:04.710, Speaker C: And that's what we're building for.
00:22:04.822 - 00:22:21.940, Speaker A: So I wanted to bring this up because I saw this news, and I don't know that much about it in terms of, like, who this party is, but I'm told it's a very big deal. Dws. DWS large asset manager in Europe. You are partnering with DWS on what exactly, and what is DWS we're excited about?
00:22:21.972 - 00:22:58.512, Speaker C: So DWS is one of a handful of asset managers around the world that are over a trillion dollars of AUM. It's a high hurdle. It's an exclusive club, and many of them have tinkered around with crypto. DWS has taken the step with us to actually go into crypto. So what we announced is an exclusive european partnership to build exchange traded products. So again, traditional structures with crypto underlying across Europe. And so for years now, we've been meeting with their product teams, their lawyers, their risk teams, and really talking this through, exploring what is actually the goal of this partnership.
00:22:58.512 - 00:23:07.986, Speaker C: And the announcement was a major step forward. We're now going to go build a lot of products and we think offer investors much better choices for how to get access to crypto in Europe.
00:23:08.080 - 00:23:21.510, Speaker A: So exchange rated products. Galaxy has what? Has an ETf in Canada with Ci. What else do we have? This is not the product concept, certainly isn't new. You guys run EtF's already?
00:23:21.662 - 00:24:18.634, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we're one of the larger crypto ETF managers in the world, and I think we've never had the ego that we can be subject matter experts, traders, index creators, educators, and distributors, and building product in all regulatory jurisdictions simultaneously, that's just not something that is rational. So we've taken this partnership approach, and we think it's really mission driven. Right. How you bring institutions and you can partner with them. What we do in every one of the partnerships that I'll lay out is we provide what we're great at, which is what I just mentioned, trading service providers, product development, all of that subject matter, expertise, education, and then we partner with regional partners that are very good at their local market, the brand, the distribution, and who have a forward thinking approach to, you know, what, putting crypto on the lineup alongside everything else. So in Canada, we partnered with CI Group. They're called the Blackrock of Canada, and we have a number of ETF's with them.
00:24:18.634 - 00:24:33.510, Speaker C: That's pretty significant. Now, in terms of AUm in the fall, you may have seen, we partnered with itau in Brazil, which is the largest bank in Latin America. In the US, we have a partnership with Invesco. So they're a $2 trillion Aum mega asset manager.
00:24:33.542 - 00:24:33.726, Speaker A: Although.
00:24:33.750 - 00:24:36.142, Speaker C: Although we don't have any ETF's, unfortunately, in the US, I don't think that's.
00:24:36.158 - 00:24:38.566, Speaker A: Either sell yet yours or invesco's fault.
00:24:38.630 - 00:24:56.774, Speaker C: But we're working on it. And then Europe, the reason we really wanted to focus on Europe with DWS was 25% of the ETP market in the world, which is an $11 trillion market, is in Europe and the UK, and five of the 7 billion of crypto AUm. So about 70% ex Us of Aum lives in Europe.
00:24:56.854 - 00:24:57.070, Speaker A: Wow.
00:24:57.102 - 00:25:06.364, Speaker C: And we've been looking at Europe for a long time, and we thought about building, we thought about buying, and ultimately, this just felt like the right thing at the right time for crypto buyers in Europe.
00:25:06.524 - 00:25:24.340, Speaker A: I mean, I think it's really impressive. I mean, honestly, the partnerships that you have struck are. They're very notable. I mean, I think in Vesco, too, when I remember when. I mean, I was here, I think when you guys struck that partnership, and, you know, obviously, we know why we don't have that rubber. Hasn't met that road yet, but I.
00:25:24.452 - 00:25:25.060, Speaker C: It'll happen.
00:25:25.132 - 00:25:28.084, Speaker A: I quipped, right. That wasn't because of Investco or Galaxy.
00:25:28.164 - 00:25:28.796, Speaker C: It'll happen.
00:25:28.900 - 00:25:39.002, Speaker A: I think. I don't know how many the ETF's, the SEC has rejected, but it's. It's over 25, I believe. Bitcoin, ETF's, we can control what we can control.
00:25:39.058 - 00:26:13.020, Speaker C: I mean, some of that is all. I mean, look, we also have a partnership on the indexing side with Bloomberg. And five years ago, when we started just defining the asset class, the taxonomy of the asset class, the rules around the Internet, like, really boring stuff to crypto natives, truly not what they get excited about, had never happened. I think when you look at it now and you take the SEC out of it, one of the things that we say, look at Canada. We had a terrible bear market last year. We managed bitcoin and Ethereum ETF's in Canada. On the bitcoin fund side, we tracked, I think it was -0.04%
00:26:13.020 - 00:26:45.798, Speaker C: to bitcoin, and the product functioned perfectly well. Intraday liquidity, lower fees. The american consumer, unfortunately, was stuck in trust structures, which not only suffered the downside of bitcoin, but there's also a 40% discount. There's 2% fees. And so what we're saying in those rooms is, which would you prefer your consumers to have access to? This is not hypothetical. We're running these ETF's with real capital markets partners, with real asset manager partners, with real service providers. In a regulated framework, it's completely possible.
00:26:45.798 - 00:26:52.902, Speaker C: We did it. It's battle tested. Let's do that for consumers in the US. And I think that's a valid thing to suggest.
00:26:52.958 - 00:27:21.076, Speaker A: Let's talk about the bear market. You mentioned this too, before, the current one versus the last one. I love the comment you made about your tradfi friends sort of patting you in the head and then later asking you to help their kids get jobs. Yeah, yeah, I definitely experienced a little bit of that as well, but I don't know what else. I mean, I was talking earlier with Bibnetta Bibi about some of the changes in market structure. You mentioned secondaries before, like I was doing venture investing through the last bear market in crypto.
00:27:21.140 - 00:27:21.524, Speaker C: Nice.
00:27:21.604 - 00:27:40.940, Speaker A: And in retrospect, you could probably have thrown a dart and made a lot of money, or at least on paper and those investing there. But it feels different now. We've got a lot of later stage companies that really need to show growth and adoption. That bear market hits them harder. What's it look like now in your mind?
00:27:41.132 - 00:28:16.544, Speaker C: Well, if we're talking to an investor, I think the bear market playbook that we would tell an investor is, number one, you have to understand the regulatory landscape, and that's not just a us point. Right. And we could talk about that in a second. I think you've mentioned this many times on the podcast. You have to understand that globally because crypto is global. Number two, is risk managed crypto in your portfolio is now obvious. And what I mean by that is no disrespect to many of the funds that we love and know in crypto, but throwing long only risk in a sort of liquid structure and not trading around it and then hoping for institutions to come into that, that's never going to happen.
00:28:16.544 - 00:29:03.992, Speaker C: You can't take a down 90% drawdown and expect a large public pension to put that return profile in a liquid structure. Risk managed crypto means what crypto requires, 24/7 focus trading and real benchmarking and rules and a risk team and systems. And so all those things are important. I think allocators that are going to put money going forward will have learned that lesson and they will only go with those that know how to manage risk, reduce volatility, diversify, trade in and out, not be zealots. All of these things. And then the third bucket in the bear market today is, you know, this growth equity opportunity that you speak of couldn't have happened last time because the market wasn't developed. But thematically, there's, you know, two, three dozen companies that hit.
00:29:03.992 - 00:30:08.928, Speaker C: Exactly. And we don't have to prove to them that crypto is what we think it is. It's for the blockchain, not crypto crowd. But that's okay, right? The reality is there are these companies that are either born of crypto, crypto adjacent, or have some venn diagram to crypto that ties to digital rails, that ties to financial infrastructure, blockchain analysis tools, all the companies that you know so well, those are great companies, but because of so much venture capital being raised by tourists, right, not by actual venture capitalists, many people in crypto didn't really think about their liquidity and the need to meet capital calls. You multiply that times 100 or 1000. You take the macro environment on top of it, and what ends up happening is you have weak hands holding really good positions. And so we think our job as galaxy, but also as an asset manager, is to present that opportunity to investors and effectively say, look, you can buy the market of the top tier blue chip names in the space that have already demonstrated product market fit at a discount, not because the companies are bad, but because of the dynamics on the tech platform.
00:30:08.976 - 00:30:28.912, Speaker A: I love you. That's what I, when I first was thinking about this idea of all the. And, you know, you can thumb through, like, the various bankruptcies that we've seen, and you can see all these piles of assets. There's many others, but those are public in bankruptcy proceedings. Lots of them. I mean, just lots of them. And I was like, you know, is this a bad company? Or is it like, oh, no, wait.
00:30:28.912 - 00:30:32.392, Speaker A: This bankrupt company is a forced seller. They're a forced seller of this position.
00:30:32.448 - 00:30:34.684, Speaker C: I would call FTX a tourist in the venture space.
00:30:36.064 - 00:30:38.840, Speaker A: I'm not sure where they got that money that they invested either. I'm not sure.
00:30:38.872 - 00:30:43.968, Speaker C: But actually, not funny to laugh about. But just. It's a good indication, I think, we're talking about.
00:30:44.016 - 00:30:50.294, Speaker A: I agree. I think on this podcast, unless this is your first time listening, I think we've proceeded well into the gallows humor stage of the FTX story.
00:30:50.334 - 00:30:54.514, Speaker C: So, as a fellow hungarian, you could appreciate gallows humor, right? Exactly.
00:30:54.894 - 00:31:03.790, Speaker A: No, but it is so different, because, like, you're right. Back in, like, 17 1819, the only growth stage companies in crypto were. Crypto exchanges were like bitcoin mining machine.
00:31:03.822 - 00:31:06.126, Speaker C: Manufacturers and exchanges and air quotes.
00:31:06.190 - 00:31:07.166, Speaker A: Right, exactly.
00:31:07.310 - 00:31:08.830, Speaker C: Not like real, but we were talking.
00:31:08.862 - 00:31:10.606, Speaker A: About the early, the early exchanges pioneers.
00:31:10.630 - 00:31:15.942, Speaker C: And not knocking them. But that's, you know, that's not what an institutional investor would look at as an exchange.
00:31:16.078 - 00:31:34.046, Speaker A: Right. So, I mean, it's a much. When I remember last year in a venture report that I did, there were like 40. 40 companies that had raised over, at a valuation over a billion now. Again, some of that's. I'm certain maybe almost all of those valuations have come down, if they've raised since then. But, I mean, these were a lot.
00:31:34.046 - 00:31:48.702, Speaker A: I mean, and it was stuff. Yes, it was exchanges and trading and finance type companies, but then it was the companies that service those companies, the compliance firms, the settlement companies, but then it was like gaming companies and metaverse companies, and it's just happening, and it.
00:31:48.718 - 00:32:32.312, Speaker C: Doesn'T have to have the crypto baggage. And it's, you know, that's what crypto has been so hard for institutions, because following the headlines and trying to make sense of it without having. And to be honest, we as a community have been a little bit arrogant about some of this stuff over the last few years. And what's going to happen is it's just going to become integrated and you're going to be investing in it without even really. Because no one says money's not going to be digital or the integration of AI and money isn't going to happen through some digitally native. Everyone sort of knows that if you can get rid of the crypto baggage in their minds, and that's actually our job. Galaxy Asset Management's job is to tell an investor what you throw in the trash can, what's interesting to follow, but not invest in, and then what's investable today, that's our job.
00:32:32.312 - 00:32:37.792, Speaker C: And that's a really hard thing to do in crypto, but it's really valuable because no one's really doing it that way, in my opinion.
00:32:37.848 - 00:32:52.206, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's essential. All right, a couple other questions before we wrap this up. Okay. So one that I know, I wanted to ask you about. You know, I'm just gonna poke fun about this a little bit, because I remember I was totally wrong about this. But, you know, Steve, you are a fan of the pudgy penguins.
00:32:52.390 - 00:32:53.646, Speaker C: I am a fan. I always have been.
00:32:53.670 - 00:32:56.398, Speaker A: It's a personal thing, by the way. We're not endorsing or promoting any random things.
00:32:56.406 - 00:33:06.910, Speaker C: There's no promotion of that. But I did. I just have to say, I got a lot of flack at Galaxy for making, including from me, including from Alex, for making my avatar a penguin.
00:33:06.982 - 00:33:23.194, Speaker A: And I remember saying, dude, didn't the founder quit or something like that? Or is there some kind of weird blow up with this project? But it must have been moments as perfect. I bottom ticked this, I think, because it's a perfect call, right? Like, then a new group came in and bought it and revitalized, got the.
00:33:23.234 - 00:33:23.946, Speaker C: Floor back up to five.
00:33:23.970 - 00:33:25.490, Speaker A: Now the pudgies are back.
00:33:25.562 - 00:33:34.210, Speaker C: The pudgies are back. But the story, it's a great lesson. Like, everyone overthinks everything. I have a daughter, and she loves.
00:33:34.282 - 00:33:35.490, Speaker A: She loved the pudgies, the penguins.
00:33:35.602 - 00:33:42.960, Speaker C: We would literally sit on opensea and scroll through, and she'd be like, look at that penguin. Look at that penguin. Different features. She loved the colors. So I got a pudgy penguin.
00:33:42.992 - 00:34:06.724, Speaker A: That's what I like about it. You know, actually, that's what I like about this collection in general, too, because especially given the fact that it, like, again, I don't recall so NFT DJ's listen and know the actual facts of this. But there was some. Something where the project might have, like, gone away completely, but then it didn't. So there's an interesting. It changed hands or something, but also, like, you know, again, you, to your credit, you weren't like, I'm gonna get rich off pudgy penguins. No, you're like, dude, I like the penguin.
00:34:06.724 - 00:34:08.624, Speaker A: And you're like, my daughter likes the penguin.
00:34:08.664 - 00:34:11.544, Speaker C: That's the great thing about crypto. To each his or her own, right?
00:34:11.624 - 00:34:15.332, Speaker A: You still have the pudgy penguin as your internal, like, slack avatar, which I respect.
00:34:15.428 - 00:34:19.484, Speaker C: I may or may not have that. I'm not going to comment on that. To be clear, we have the pudgy penguin.
00:34:19.524 - 00:34:26.492, Speaker A: We also talk a lot about nfts on this show, and so I don't think users will be surprised that other people here that like them, and I am one of them.
00:34:26.548 - 00:34:27.144, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:27.684 - 00:34:43.250, Speaker A: Let's talk a little bit about, like, I want to ask you this, too. We're in this great studio now that Galaxy has built for galaxy brains and for other stuff that maybe Galaxy will shoot. But we're in this great building in lower Manhattan. But it didn't. Galaxy was pretty famous for these Soho offices.
00:34:43.362 - 00:34:51.974, Speaker C: The Soho offices. First of all, they had the evil Knievel novo suit right outside of the office. Full body. Full body, Evel Knievel suit.
00:34:52.514 - 00:34:53.586, Speaker A: Magnificent.
00:34:53.770 - 00:35:01.874, Speaker C: So, I mean, I don't even know which story to tell. There was the time where the elevators stopped working and our president got stuck on the way up. The water pressure was terrible, so the bathrooms were alive.
00:35:01.914 - 00:35:09.264, Speaker A: Air conditioning didn't work very often or actually, I think the building was trying to, like, like, skimp on us. They would turn the temperature up.
00:35:09.724 - 00:35:24.340, Speaker C: I'm not sure there's a debate about that. Yeah, there is, but we had the yellow couches. I probably shouldn't tell this story, but we literally, the first year, literally had the interns in the boiler room because there was nowhere else to go. And so you had ten interns just in a small.
00:35:24.412 - 00:35:37.462, Speaker A: We moved to this much larger office in the end of 21, I think. Also a nice. I'll say the. It was right near the top in crypto, but it was right at the bottom of commercial real estate prices.
00:35:37.518 - 00:35:39.646, Speaker C: It was, yeah, we got one side of the trade, right?
00:35:39.790 - 00:35:40.614, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:35:40.734 - 00:35:42.022, Speaker C: Well, it's maybe too early to tell.
00:35:42.078 - 00:35:59.350, Speaker A: Well, it's a much more professional office like. So does that feel. I mean, what, does that feel differently to you? Because the Soho office, by the way, was iconic. There are a lot of people in New York who recall you and Mike and others used to host a very crypto meetup there all the time, like, for, you know, people in the industry listen, those well known and beloved. But it was beloved.
00:35:59.382 - 00:36:23.984, Speaker C: It was also. It was also tenuous. I remember there was a guy, I walked into the bathroom at one of our crypto cantinas, and there was a guy who had. And I'm just, you know, I'm not as technical as many who listen to this podcast, but he had a laptop open with these two big wires, and he was typing furiously in the bathroom. I was like, what are you doing? He's like, don't worry about it. Shuts the runs out, and you're like, what, did we just get hacked? What was that? So it was all that crypto of that time period had to offer.
00:36:24.284 - 00:36:24.596, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:36:24.620 - 00:37:09.574, Speaker C: Look, I mean, one of the things we said, what's different about this cycle? And I think everyone who's going to be a part of this future has to have a lane, and our lane is an institutional lane, and we can debate why that's important. And I know a lot of crypto natives probably don't understand that, or they don't agree with it, or they think they understand it. I'd love to have that debate, actually. Our lane is the institutional space. And when we bring in pensions and consultants and endowments and foundations and partners, this is one way to achieve our mission and to help bring them in and feel comfortable and open minded and understand that there's really something for everyone in crypto. It's not just the yellow couches or the evil Knievel suits and all that. I mean, that's fun.
00:37:09.574 - 00:37:27.098, Speaker C: But we've grown up a little bit as a company, and we want to recruit talent, and we want to be global, and we're public and we do work with regulators constructively, notwithstanding all the headlines. And it's important to sort of give off that impression as well is actually behaving that way.
00:37:27.146 - 00:37:39.082, Speaker A: It's great. I mean, I love this office we're in because it's not that the other one wasn't professional. I mean, if people in New York, they know Soho is a neighborhood. I mean, this is a. This is a professional office converted from, like, an artisanal lofts.
00:37:39.138 - 00:37:40.682, Speaker C: It has Bevy. It has bevy machines.
00:37:40.738 - 00:37:44.866, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, we've got bevy. Shout out to Bevy. Yeah, big fan. Boston, Massachusetts, company Bevy.
00:37:44.930 - 00:37:52.434, Speaker C: Yeah, we couldn't have Bevy in the Soho office. Cause the water pressure was too bad, to be honest. So I'm just very happy that we have water pressure that works.
00:37:52.474 - 00:38:09.850, Speaker A: That's great. Well, no, that was years ago. At this point, it's now been over almost two full years. I think since we moved into this new office, a lot has changed. Okay, one last question for you. So, Steve, I hear. I think someone was telling me, I've heard you talk about this for charity.
00:38:09.850 - 00:38:15.962, Speaker A: You and many others. You're gonna do a different type of race. Sounds pretty intense.
00:38:16.018 - 00:38:35.108, Speaker C: Hashtag cryptomurf is what we're going for. Yeah. Look, we had this idea, and I have to give credit to our president, Chris Ferraro. For years, he's been needling me for having not done the Memorial Day murph. For those of you who don't know, the Memorial Day murph, there were a couple of Navy Seals that were. If you've seen the lone survivor movie, it's that story. Effectively.
00:38:35.108 - 00:38:54.846, Speaker C: Stranded in Afghanistan, had a very difficult firefight. Lieutenant Michael Murphy led those seals. He unfortunately died in that mission. But he had a workout, and his favorite workout was four times. You push go on the clock. You throw in a 20 pound weight pack, you run a mile, 100 pull ups, 200 pushups, 300 air squats, 100 pushups. Sorry, 1 mile run.
00:38:54.846 - 00:38:55.806, Speaker C: And then you stop the clock.
00:38:55.870 - 00:38:58.238, Speaker A: So, like, it escalates up and back down.
00:38:58.406 - 00:39:17.468, Speaker C: You can do it any way you want, but you have to. You just have to do the whole workout with the 20 pound weight vest. And we thought it'd be a nice, a nice way to raise money for the Navy SEAL foundation. So we're partnering with Figment, we're partnering with Coinbase. We've got a couple dozen people doing the workout. We've raised $35,000 for the Navy SeAL foundation. And, you know, we'll see what happens.
00:39:17.468 - 00:39:25.944, Speaker C: There's a couple of dark horse candidates for who's going to win that one on Memorial Day. But even if the US doesn't love us from the regulators, we love the US.
00:39:26.244 - 00:39:28.740, Speaker A: We're going to make progress with those regulators. We're going to work on it.
00:39:28.772 - 00:39:29.268, Speaker C: Yeah, we will.
00:39:29.316 - 00:39:33.204, Speaker A: Hey, Steve Kerrs, head of Galaxy Asset Management, my friend, thank you so much for coming on Galaxy.
00:39:33.244 - 00:39:34.708, Speaker C: Thanks, Alex. Appreciate it, man. Thanks.
00:39:34.836 - 00:39:53.306, Speaker A: That's it for Galaxy Brains this week. Thanks to our guest Steve Kurz and Bimnetta BB, great conversation.
