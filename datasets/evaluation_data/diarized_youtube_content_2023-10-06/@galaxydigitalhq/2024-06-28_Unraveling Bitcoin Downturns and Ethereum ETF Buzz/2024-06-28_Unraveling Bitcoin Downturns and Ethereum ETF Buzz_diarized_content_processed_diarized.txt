00:00:07.240 - 00:00:11.598, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy brains.
00:00:11.774 - 00:00:13.182, Speaker B: Thank you for having me.
00:00:13.366 - 00:00:23.170, Speaker A: What's happening? You know, I'm not really sure what's going on in markets. Obviously we've had a correction in bitcoin, lower, I think, since we last spoke. But broadly, what are you following right now?
00:00:23.790 - 00:00:52.020, Speaker B: Fixed income markets. We've had a little bit of a retracement in the inflation narrative. Things were easing over the past couple of months and people got lulled into thinking that inflation was kind of under control domestically and abroad. And now you've had two back to back g ten economies print higher than expected. CPI. You had canadian CPI yesterday or earlier this weekend. You had australian CPI last night.
00:00:52.020 - 00:01:04.900, Speaker B: Both were hot, and that caused fixed income markets to sell off. In addition, you have dollar yen breaking through 160, well, through intervention levels and stuff.
00:01:04.940 - 00:01:07.668, Speaker A: I was going to say, wasn't 140 an important level a long time ago?
00:01:07.684 - 00:01:19.126, Speaker B: 150, etcetera. But now you're through 160 and you are in uncharted territory, at least over the past 1020 years or so.
00:01:19.158 - 00:01:21.910, Speaker A: Are the Japanese the largest holders of us bonds?
00:01:21.950 - 00:02:27.010, Speaker B: One of the largest holders of us bonds. There's a lot of Twitter chatter about all these real money accounts in Japan that are now going to be forced to sell some of their fixed income holdings because they're so underwater on their portfolios. But yeah, it seems like the evolution of Japan is moving towards more of a monetary policy response rather than just outright currency intervention, which I think would be bad for bond markets if you had japanese rates rise and they're a large money center for Asia as well. So if those funding rates start to go up, that should have reverberations into the bond market globally. But high level, we had a lot of good data in the US and bonds repriced pretty aggressively. But when you think about it, how much can the Fed really cut? Like, I think they should cut because there's a lot of signs that the labor market's cooling and inflation is fine. And so I think it's appropriate to cut.
00:02:27.010 - 00:03:00.816, Speaker B: But I think the cut probably gets you to, like, you should go to like 4% if you're going to cut. But even then, I've gone back and forth because, like, the data is just so unpredictable, as we saw with Canada and Australia. And if you look at certain high frequency things, like, I think Jim Bianco tweeted out a photo of TSA and flight things of us folks, you're at all time highs in terms of tons of flying happening, tons of flying activity. So it's a really hard picture.
00:03:00.848 - 00:03:15.124, Speaker A: It's kind of like chopflation, right? Chopflation, basically, it's not really trending in either direction. Sometimes it looks like it's getting better, then it looks like it's getting worse. Luckily, it's not getting dramatically worse yet. It's not really reflation yet. Right?
00:03:15.172 - 00:03:35.980, Speaker B: It's not, but it's like, you know that like the moment the economy starts to turn and we start easing a little bit, that the reflation stuff comes back. And so I'm like, ah, so hard. And so in my head, I'm like, really? The one thing you're not supposed to own is like, back end us duration, like, yeah, seven years and greater.
00:03:36.060 - 00:03:37.084, Speaker A: You don't want the long bonds.
00:03:37.132 - 00:04:12.730, Speaker B: You don't, you don't. It's just like there's not much value there. It's like inflation is going to average anywhere from like two to 5%. Right. And so your return above inflation on being in that paper isn't great. And to be honest, basically every other asset class has outperformed fixed income for a while now. And so it's like, why put your money in something that's negatively real yielding when you have alternatives? And so I just, I really don't have like the back end of the us curve right now.
00:04:12.730 - 00:04:42.040, Speaker B: That's kind of my take. And then bitcoin, I am not that constructive on a move higher in the near term. I think upside is limited. I think that there's a catalyst in terms of the presidential debate that's happening this week. And if you do get some crypto mentions, I think you could get a little bit of a short squeeze. But in terms of the supply that the market has had to absorb, it's pretty nuts.
00:04:42.420 - 00:04:45.880, Speaker A: You have the Germans, the Germans coin, they've been selling.
00:04:47.620 - 00:04:50.108, Speaker B: Some flows out east as well.
00:04:50.244 - 00:04:51.564, Speaker A: You have the Gox coming up.
00:04:51.612 - 00:05:21.276, Speaker B: Gox coming up. When the headline hits of billions of dollars of bitcoin being transferred to people and to exchanges, that's going to cause the market to move lower. I think 60K held because there's a lot of short covering and people are tactically, that's a good level. You know, I saw a chart last night. I don't know if it was good or not, but in terms of like, BTC balances held by OTC desks, it shot up a lot recently.
00:05:21.388 - 00:05:24.076, Speaker A: Yeah, those charts, that's like glass node data. Usually.
00:05:24.228 - 00:05:25.188, Speaker B: It's tough.
00:05:25.324 - 00:05:41.120, Speaker A: Yeah, we know they don't cover, but for inflows, I think it's a decent marker. It's more like for balances, it's like, I'm pretty sure not one of Galaxy's wallets is on that list. But people are sending coins to OTC desks. I mean, if you see it, even if they just track one, it goes up.
00:05:42.010 - 00:05:44.874, Speaker B: You've also had outflows out of the ETF's most days.
00:05:44.962 - 00:06:06.810, Speaker A: So what do you think? I've been writing about Mount Gox. Right. And just on that specifically, I would say the argument I've been making is not that there won't be selling or that it isn't a lot of coins, but that they're more diamond handed than people think and they're more, and there's less coins, I think, really available to actually be sold from there than the news stories. They say 9,000,140,000.
00:06:06.890 - 00:06:15.112, Speaker B: No, but at the end of the day, even if it's 1 billion, that's a lot of supply to take down at the lows in the market when it's already taking down a lot of supply.
00:06:15.216 - 00:06:18.896, Speaker A: Yeah. My whole argument has been not that it doesn't go down, but that it's.
00:06:18.928 - 00:06:20.504, Speaker B: Not going to be as bad as I think.
00:06:20.632 - 00:06:29.904, Speaker A: So if the market overreacts, then you could look at that as a buying opportunity. But it is going to hit, and that probably is going to. There will be net new supply coming on for sure.
00:06:30.032 - 00:06:51.264, Speaker B: And so it's a tricky market, but yeah, I think the way the market's positioned, at least in the option space, is kind of how I'm thinking about the market. That Q three is most likely going to be very supply oriented. And that in Q four, you'll have a broader rally as you get more.
00:06:51.352 - 00:06:54.288, Speaker A: Quite common in bitcoin world, too, if you look at the seasonality.
00:06:54.344 - 00:07:02.860, Speaker B: The seasonality, but that's what the options market is pricing in terms of where December volume. So end of December upside is on a relative basis.
00:07:04.010 - 00:07:17.706, Speaker A: You're talking about supply, too. Outside of bitcoin, at least we know we're talking about sort of unlocking seized supply or bankrupt supply in the case of Gox. But the altcoin space, the altcoin space is infinite supply, and there's a lot of it coming unlocked.
00:07:17.738 - 00:07:18.578, Speaker B: A lot of it.
00:07:18.634 - 00:07:26.050, Speaker A: A lot of the projects that raised in like 21, they're finally getting. They were on like literally three year cliffs. And that's now.
00:07:26.170 - 00:07:32.202, Speaker B: No, exactly. But here's the thing. You said it best. I think you put together the information it's like $20 billion in crypto.
00:07:32.226 - 00:07:40.302, Speaker A: VC's crypto, liquid hedge funds, liquid hedge funds, total AUM, 20 billion, $80 billion of unlocks in the next two and a half years. Who's gonna buy them?
00:07:40.446 - 00:07:43.726, Speaker B: You know, and so the supply story is really gonna catch up to the market.
00:07:43.798 - 00:07:44.450, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:44.790 - 00:07:45.530, Speaker B: And.
00:07:45.910 - 00:08:01.950, Speaker A: Well, especially if the demand side hasn't really come here yet. We don't see the retails aping into the mag seven. Right. They're not aping into dogecoin. They're not aping into bitcoin, as far as we can tell. Right. So, like, if.
00:08:01.950 - 00:08:14.472, Speaker A: And then if the liquid asset management sector in crypto is only 20 billion total, it can't take down that supply either. So, you know, we're coming out. The VC's created a lot of tokens.
00:08:14.576 - 00:08:16.808, Speaker B: There's magic Internet money out of thin air.
00:08:16.864 - 00:08:18.860, Speaker A: Yeah. No proof of work at all.
00:08:19.640 - 00:08:46.132, Speaker B: No, fair enough. There's a lot of good things happening in crypto. There are, for sure, phenomenal. But in terms of the valuations, it's very tough to wrap your head around because, you know, I believe in tech, and, you know, the adoption will be there, but not everything can be worth a billion dollars. Like, right out the gate. Right out the gate. It's insanely hard to build a billion dollar business.
00:08:46.132 - 00:08:52.084, Speaker B: Yeah, but how many billion dollar protocols do we have that make, like $5 million a year, if that.
00:08:52.132 - 00:09:23.396, Speaker A: Yeah, not many. In fact, we were looking at of the top 20 coins, like on coinmarketcap.com, which obviously includes stable coins and stuff, too. I think only five are the result of venture capital. So you've got $100 billion since 2015 invested in the crypto ecosystem by venture capitalists. According to our research, not all of that went into token projects, but of that, I mean, probably thousands of tokens created out of that money, and only five are in the top 20. Right.
00:09:23.396 - 00:09:39.396, Speaker A: I remember saying, like, where is that value? Token VC's like, where? Where is that value? Right? And I mean, the Ethereum, not venture back. Right. Ico. Right. Cardano up there in the top ten. I don't think it's a good project, but not venture back ico. Right? Like Dogecoin fair launch.
00:09:39.396 - 00:09:42.924, Speaker A: Bitcoin fair launch. Right. Stable coins don't even really count.
00:09:43.092 - 00:09:44.164, Speaker B: They don't. They shouldn't.
00:09:44.212 - 00:09:46.116, Speaker A: I'm saying, like, what is. Show me. Right?
00:09:46.148 - 00:09:46.460, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:09:46.540 - 00:09:59.362, Speaker A: It's basically, like, Solana and, like, avalanche and a couple others that actually have venture money that are actually in the top 20. It's very few, like, so it's also like, guys, please invest in and build stuff people actually want.
00:09:59.466 - 00:10:08.386, Speaker B: Realistically. I mean, the thing people want is like a blockchain that solves security concerns and that's scalable and that's fast.
00:10:08.458 - 00:10:09.138, Speaker A: Fast and cheap.
00:10:09.194 - 00:10:22.402, Speaker B: And like, that's the Holy Grail. That's the Holy Grail. And there's a couple of them that are like going to be very close to like visa level, like TPS and things like that. But how many of them do you need?
00:10:22.506 - 00:10:23.042, Speaker A: That's the other thing.
00:10:23.066 - 00:10:24.706, Speaker B: And like, what is the value of that network?
00:10:24.778 - 00:10:25.578, Speaker A: And this, the whole.
00:10:25.634 - 00:10:27.386, Speaker B: It's like, it's so hard.
00:10:27.418 - 00:10:36.978, Speaker A: That's the whole thing. Like, how much block space do we actually need? Right, like you've got ethereum and it's l two s. Yeah, I mean, if the l two s. If that really long term works, how many other blockchains you really need?
00:10:37.034 - 00:10:38.170, Speaker B: You don't really need that many.
00:10:38.210 - 00:10:39.150, Speaker A: I don't think so.
00:10:39.650 - 00:10:41.990, Speaker B: How many bitcoin l two s do you know? Launch.
00:10:42.490 - 00:10:58.828, Speaker A: We got some stuff we're putting out on this. I don't want to. We'll save this for a later episode, but. Well, I think we think there's 65 minimum being that have fundraised or announced. Right. Like, I don't think bitcoin can support, I don't mean the market. I don't think bitcoin, the network will be able to really house more than like two or three of these things.
00:10:58.828 - 00:11:00.940, Speaker A: And that's if they have the money.
00:11:00.980 - 00:11:02.844, Speaker B: To actually skyrocket, though.
00:11:02.932 - 00:11:18.318, Speaker A: Exactly. So tricky. But yeah, agreed. I mean, I think a couple. I think Solana has been interesting to me because at least it's different than the ethereum ecosystem, like, technologically, but like, how many alt alternatives to eth is there room for? Right.
00:11:18.374 - 00:11:18.702, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:18.766 - 00:11:28.230, Speaker A: Especially if you get all these different roll ups that have different features. Like, why do you really need another blockchain? Or should it just be a roll up? I'm not sure. But anyway, people are still creating those new blockchains.
00:11:28.310 - 00:11:30.702, Speaker B: I know. We'll see, but. Yeah.
00:11:30.846 - 00:11:32.006, Speaker A: Well, interesting.
00:11:32.078 - 00:11:33.934, Speaker B: There are consequences to printing money and.
00:11:33.942 - 00:11:50.264, Speaker A: What, just seasonally in the summer too, right? We're about to end. Like, next week is July 4. We're really entering the height of the summer now. It's going to be just weak. Right. Markets, what do you think? I mean, stock markets are open, crypto markets are 24/7 but, you know, they say, like, selling main go away. Like.
00:11:50.264 - 00:11:52.576, Speaker A: Yeah, there's typically, like, low volume in the summer.
00:11:52.688 - 00:11:55.896, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I think it's really tough.
00:11:55.928 - 00:11:57.800, Speaker A: It is. Leading into a presidential election, though.
00:11:57.880 - 00:11:58.288, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:58.384 - 00:11:59.512, Speaker A: There's going to be some excitement.
00:11:59.616 - 00:12:26.666, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't know. It's really tough to call. I think that, you know, there's going to be less staffing than usual across the street, but outside of that, it's really tough. I think equities, they've rallied a lot. And so folks are going to look at earnings and be like, show me that you're still doing well. Show me that you're still growing.
00:12:26.698 - 00:12:28.354, Speaker A: You're not overvalued and all that.
00:12:28.402 - 00:12:32.242, Speaker B: But I don't even know if people care about value right now. It doesn't make much sense.
00:12:32.306 - 00:12:37.538, Speaker A: And we're likely to have the Ethereum spot ETF's launch perhaps in the next few weeks.
00:12:37.594 - 00:12:38.210, Speaker B: Next two weeks?
00:12:38.250 - 00:12:41.594, Speaker A: Yeah. That could cause excitement. I mean.
00:12:41.682 - 00:12:42.074, Speaker B: No, it's not.
00:12:42.082 - 00:12:43.506, Speaker A: I know people are kind of bearish on that.
00:12:43.538 - 00:12:46.626, Speaker B: I mean, it's not gonna go well.
00:12:46.738 - 00:12:47.418, Speaker A: You don't think so?
00:12:47.474 - 00:12:49.722, Speaker B: People have not had enough time to market the product.
00:12:49.786 - 00:12:50.026, Speaker A: True.
00:12:50.058 - 00:12:51.066, Speaker B: But, like, the.
00:12:51.138 - 00:12:57.674, Speaker A: There was no real bitcoin marketing on, like, day one. Yeah. Although it did have a nice, like, drumbeat for months leading into.
00:12:57.722 - 00:13:04.642, Speaker B: Yes. You had Larry Finko on tv about it. Right. Like, there's the marketing behind ads on newspapers, television.
00:13:04.706 - 00:13:05.216, Speaker A: That's true.
00:13:05.298 - 00:13:16.548, Speaker B: Right. It doesn't have the same marketing, and it's also just the worst product. And so, you know, and everything we've known so far is that, like, crypto is a buy. The rumor, sell the news event, and.
00:13:16.564 - 00:13:18.596, Speaker A: Even the bitcoin ETF's were in the beginning. Right.
00:13:18.628 - 00:13:36.310, Speaker B: We had a strong bitcoin futures ETF was a buy. The rumor sell the news situation, the spot ETF was that the ETH futures ETF was the same thing. And so I don't see anything different. The only thing different this time is you might not actually rally going into that.
00:13:36.470 - 00:13:38.678, Speaker A: Like, we're not really rallying now.
00:13:38.734 - 00:13:39.038, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:39.094 - 00:13:47.342, Speaker A: So to me, it's like, the one thing I would say is that I feel like it might being bearish on the ETH ETF's is actually, like, kind of consensus.
00:13:47.446 - 00:13:47.886, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:47.958 - 00:13:50.502, Speaker A: And I think that might. That might be mid curving.
00:13:50.566 - 00:13:55.534, Speaker B: The price action. It went from, like, a two handle to like, no, no, high three is almost four.
00:13:55.662 - 00:14:04.462, Speaker A: True. Well, that's true. But I mean, like, now everyone's like, oh, they're gonna. So they're gonna. Even on a relative basis, they're gonna underwhelm the bitcoin ETF's. Right.
00:14:04.526 - 00:15:10.620, Speaker B: I think the trade is really in the EtH ecosystem thereafter. So you have $10 billion, $11 billion of ETH that goes from being idle eth to potentially redeemable ETH that can be used in the ETH ecosystem. It can be used to stake farm on Defi, et cetera. And I think the ETF opens the door to kind of more investors looking at DeFi in a more critical way and from an investment perspective. And, like, how should I really be thinking about ETH? And so what I really like, if I had to trade anything from the long side going with ETF, are the DeFi protocols that are actually valuable from the sense that the tokens, right, you had uniswap turn on the fee switch or propose to turn on the fee switch. You've got protocols like Maker Aave and compound that make real revenues and that trade at multiples that are, you know, let's say 20 ish, maybe like, somewhat reasonable. Depends on how you want to think about it.
00:15:10.620 - 00:15:15.852, Speaker B: But these are companies or protocols that trade at reasonable valuations.
00:15:15.956 - 00:15:17.036, Speaker A: And they actually have usage.
00:15:17.108 - 00:15:19.548, Speaker B: They actually have usage. Multi chain.
00:15:19.604 - 00:15:41.176, Speaker A: So you're thinking that the ETF's say, wait a second, let's learn more. Creates an educational thing. And then actually people say, well, not that I should buy the ETF. I should get real ETH and maybe do some of this real stuff, or, like, on chain. Yeah. To me, it's like, if you're gonna be the world computer, you don't wanna, like, take the keys or the gas or the whatever for the world computer and lock it in a vault. You wanna plug it into the wall.
00:15:41.248 - 00:15:41.640, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:41.720 - 00:15:47.896, Speaker A: So, to me, I've never liked this idea about the ETh ETF. Whereas most bitcoiners are really Hodlers, and they think of it like digital gold.
00:15:48.088 - 00:15:58.682, Speaker B: You should be using it and, like, figuring out stuff to do. And so, yeah, I'm optimistic for, like, the rest of crypto and, like, people figuring out what to do with stuff.
00:15:58.746 - 00:16:11.826, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I guess I'm not sure yet whether we're gonna record next week. Cause it will be July 4. But thank you so much as always, my friend Bibnet, for coming on, and maybe we'll see you next week. If not, we'll be back after that. Everybody, brilliant.
00:16:11.898 - 00:16:12.490, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
