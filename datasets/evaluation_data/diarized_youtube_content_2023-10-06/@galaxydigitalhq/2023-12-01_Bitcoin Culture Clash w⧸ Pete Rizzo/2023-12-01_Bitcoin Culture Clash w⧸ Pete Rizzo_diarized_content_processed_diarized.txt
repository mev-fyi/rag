00:00:05.880 - 00:01:10.382, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. You'll want back to attack this verse. No, relent when I quench this thirst no, repent when I press the corn slow ascent till the future's born cause we're growing important and we be flowing inordinately every day owning the moment in every way growing and roaming in every class touching the grass living it up till the reverie pass I'm hovering past my haters stuttering laughs checking the papers. You want to debate us? More likely. Evaders were deadly invaders never rebating and I'm always be waiting for the rhyme don't you blink or you will miss though always evolving like the culture is Peter Rizzo my writing is lightning that's why they call me the bitcoin viking I always be striking the match igniting and rap and keep it exciting that's the story we call for freedom cause we need it challenges meet em and we beat em gotta hunger, need to feed it and there isn't a matter where dissident rapper who could ever rattle me so, haters, keep your fallacies. I'll be at the game. Galaxy as always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital.
00:01:10.382 - 00:01:37.404, Speaker A: Thank you for listening to Galaxy Brains. We have a great show for you today. Peter Rizzo, editor of Bitcoin magazine, is our guest. We're going to get into it deep with him on bitcoin and crypto media, the landscape, how it's evolving. We're also going to talk at length with Pete about bitcoin culture and its history, its present, its future. It's a fascinating conversation, especially if you're interested in the narratives that drive these communities. Of course, we'll also check with our good friend Bibnett Abibi from Galaxy trading, as always, to talk markets and macro.
00:01:37.404 - 00:02:13.236, Speaker A: And before we get to all of that, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to the disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Phineas, we're back from the break. We got one big month push to the end of the year. We've got some good guests lined up coming up on this show. This is a great episode with Pete, but I have to ask, phineas, did you see this story about a whole that was on an airplane between New York and Belgium and they had to turn around cause the horse got loose did you see that?
00:02:13.300 - 00:02:18.784, Speaker B: I'm already thinking of the branding of this section. I think it's gonna be like Alex and Alex and the news maybe.
00:02:19.084 - 00:02:23.876, Speaker A: Or headlines with Alex. Yeah. These are the stories that don't rate for our actual content.
00:02:23.980 - 00:02:25.820, Speaker B: But I have not heard this story. Please explain.
00:02:25.852 - 00:02:33.292, Speaker A: I mean, I feel like the service animal thing, it's gone a bit too far. You don't need a horse on an airplane.
00:02:33.428 - 00:02:40.184, Speaker B: Also, people game the system. They get these things online. Dogs in their vests.
00:02:40.484 - 00:02:56.948, Speaker A: I get it. Look, I get it. A dog. If it's a little dog too. Don't get me wrong, if you really need it, I get it. But does anyone need a service animal horse or a mental health awareness snake? Come on, who's responsible for policing that? That's the thing. I think it's quite decentralized.
00:02:56.948 - 00:03:05.180, Speaker A: I think that's how people are able to game it so well. There is no national service. I actually have no idea. Maybe there is, I don't know, decentralized everything.
00:03:05.292 - 00:03:06.628, Speaker B: Decentralized service animals.
00:03:06.676 - 00:03:12.620, Speaker A: Yeah. And I don't want to be in an airplane and see running up the aisle to the cockpit. That seems pretty scary to me.
00:03:12.692 - 00:03:13.244, Speaker B: Yeah, I would agree.
00:03:13.284 - 00:03:24.972, Speaker A: So good job they turned around. Everyone was safe. Let's get right into the show. Let's talk to Bimnet. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnett. Welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:03:25.068 - 00:03:26.212, Speaker C: Thank you for having me.
00:03:26.348 - 00:03:42.950, Speaker A: What's been going on in markets? I mean, I saw bitcoin after we did our last episode. It went down a little bit, but it's mostly right back in the high 37s. It was at 38 yesterday. And then equity markets I saw are also performing well. What's going on?
00:03:43.062 - 00:04:33.118, Speaker C: So you've had a continuation of the theme over the past couple of weeks with data deteriorating and dovish Fed speak yesterday really marked a new kind of stage to it when you had a relatively hawkish member of the Fed, Waller, kind of come out more dovish than a lot of market participants were expecting. Basically acknowledging that the fact that a lot of the data has turned and some of the forward looking indicators are suggesting that we're going to head to a softer patch of inflation and employment and things of that nature. You saw twos rally 15 basis points yesterday. The dollar aggressively sell off. We're talking euro broke through 110 cable and $27 yen. I think overnight at least touched 146 handle. So dollars sold off aggressively.
00:04:33.118 - 00:05:19.004, Speaker C: Us fixed income went aggressively bid and that's generally risk on and so equities have been reacting pretty well to that news. S and P is flirting with 4600, which is basically close to all time highs. Not even year to date highs. Guys, we're talking about all time highs are within sight for the S and P and the Nasdaq. You've seen a lot of highly shorted names and stuff that's more closer to junk or low quality stuff do really well. Some of it's a function of a short squeeze. Long story short, when the Fed is pivoting like this, the market's going to take it as a signal to buy risk assets, and that's what it's doing.
00:05:19.004 - 00:05:53.720, Speaker C: What's the risk asset? Every currency that isn't the dollar, Russell stocks, meme stocks, things of that nature. Folks feel like the Fed gave them a green light to buy risk. I think that's spilled over into crypto as well. That's why, again, we're still flirting with new trend highs in bitcoin, you know, alter trading pretty healthily as well. And so I think you're just in December and the Fed's telling you that they see a soft landing ahead.
00:05:53.832 - 00:05:57.032, Speaker A: Yeah, it's crazy. So the pivot is on.
00:05:57.168 - 00:06:00.208, Speaker C: It's on. However, the risks to that, that's what.
00:06:00.216 - 00:06:01.216, Speaker A: I was going to get to, are.
00:06:01.280 - 00:06:02.768, Speaker C: That you've got a lot baked in.
00:06:02.816 - 00:06:03.024, Speaker A: Right.
00:06:03.064 - 00:07:01.484, Speaker C: So by the January FOMC meeting of 2025, so it was just like a year and like two months, call it, you've got 130 basis points of cuts. By May of next year, you've got the first 25 basis points priced in. So there's a lot of easing that's priced into the rate curve. What makes it so challenging is you don't know the extent to which they'll cut when they do start cutting. Because if you're motivated enough to cut, the question's like, do you cut 50, do you cut 100, cut 150? What do you do with the QT program that you have? And so it becomes a very hard thing to solve, and you just kind of have to think about the distribution of outcomes. But the risk is that the Fed sees the economy slowing, but doesn't necessarily feel the need to cut rates. And that's where the market could get caught offsides a little bit.
00:07:01.524 - 00:07:47.340, Speaker A: I see. And part of the thing, too, with hire for longer as an idea, which doesn't mean raise more, may mean stay high for a longer period of time. If people start buying stocks and equities are at all time highs or nearing it, and things further out on the risk curve, like crypto or meme stocks, whatever else, are doing well. People feel wealthier and then they spend more, theoretically, and then inflation is stickier. It's this push and pull we've talked about that's going to be so. It's such an interesting position because they're acknowledging some softening and they're signaling that that could lead to easing. Yes, but at the same time, they don't want to signal that too hard.
00:07:47.340 - 00:08:10.812, Speaker A: They want to be hawkish also, so that people, they're kind of like a mean parent who's like, don't go out and spend anything, though. Right? They got to beat us down with language. But we know you're. Yeah, it's just such a tricky situation because it is hard that we've talked about that Volcker situation where they raised a bunch and then they cut a bunch, but then inflation roared back and they had raised like 20%. They don't want that to happen. Correct.
00:08:10.868 - 00:08:42.030, Speaker C: And so it's a fine balance that the fed needs to strike. And there are other considerations are their credibility. Many eyes, they're not that credible. But for them, it's still an important thing to focus on. Yeah, it's tough. However, I would say that their concerns are not necessarily about the part of the economy that has a huge stock portfolio, not necessarily the people that are going to feel richer.
00:08:42.102 - 00:08:44.994, Speaker A: Those people are doing fine. That's a fair point. Exactly.
00:08:45.294 - 00:09:26.276, Speaker C: Those people already have a huge glut of savings. Their consumption habits aren't really going to change that much. Are they really going to buy a new house right now? Like, and so what you're mainly concerned about is the folks in the bottom quartile of the income distributions, the folks that are having to pay student debt. Again, the credit card delinquencies that are picking up the auto delinquencies that are picking up the folks at risk with automation moving in at the fringe parts of the labor market. And so that's kind of where I think the Fed's concern is mainly coming from. In addition, like, there are structural things that have changed that are now helping the Fed.
00:09:26.380 - 00:09:26.692, Speaker B: Right.
00:09:26.748 - 00:09:32.460, Speaker C: So oil has come off a lot. For example, I think you're going on like ten weeks in a row of.
00:09:32.492 - 00:09:45.464, Speaker A: Gas price declines, and that trickles out throughout the economy. Not all, just the stuff that uses gasoline to power it, but also all the products that are made from petroleum. Right. Like everything. Tons of stuff gets cheaper if oil is cheaper, correct. Yeah.
00:09:46.324 - 00:10:12.742, Speaker C: And so, you know, and also the supply chain stuff has eased super meaningfully and I do think there's a certain element of the US consumer is always so strong. They just want to consume, consume, consume. But there is a limit to that. Everybody that bought furniture during the COVID pandemic, they already bought it. They already bought it and stuff like that.
00:10:12.838 - 00:10:17.254, Speaker A: That was a big trend during COVID buying stuff to upgrade your house because you were all stuck in it.
00:10:17.254 - 00:10:24.382, Speaker C: You understand? 16 months to arrive, 16 months later. You have the catch. Do you need a new one?
00:10:24.438 - 00:10:24.726, Speaker A: No.
00:10:24.790 - 00:10:28.790, Speaker C: Yeah, right. And so, you know, same thing with like durable goods. You bought a new fridge.
00:10:28.862 - 00:10:42.606, Speaker A: So I forget. But we're like the, you know, like, I don't want to name any specific companies, but like the mail furniture companies that, like, whether it's like self assembly. Where did they rip during COVID They must have. Right? I'm forgetting now. Honestly. They must have.
00:10:42.630 - 00:10:46.966, Speaker C: Because if you're like, we engaged in historic level money printing, it just didn't matter what you.
00:10:46.990 - 00:10:50.958, Speaker A: And you can't go out. So it was like you're only ordering stuff on online, basically. Yeah.
00:10:50.966 - 00:10:51.614, Speaker C: I mean, just.
00:10:51.734 - 00:10:55.782, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I bought a new bed during COVID I did.
00:10:55.838 - 00:10:57.994, Speaker C: And those fancy sheets that I do.
00:10:58.974 - 00:11:18.334, Speaker A: I'm telling you, if you're gonna spend money on something, you know, things that carry. This is clear aside, but in my view, it's things that, like your body is in. Right. Your bed, your furniture, your shoes should be comfortable. A t shirt, I like to say merely drapes upon your body, but your sneakers carry the full weight of your body. Right. So they should be comfortable.
00:11:18.494 - 00:11:20.478, Speaker C: Got it. No, no, absolutely.
00:11:20.606 - 00:11:21.230, Speaker A: It's a little bit of a.
00:11:21.262 - 00:11:21.710, Speaker B: But looking.
00:11:21.782 - 00:11:38.174, Speaker C: Looking forward. We do get like a bunch of data shortly. Right. So you get PCE, you get non farm payroll soon. You've got Powell speaking, I believe, on Friday and. Yeah. And then you.
00:11:38.294 - 00:11:39.678, Speaker A: And we have another FOMC before the.
00:11:39.686 - 00:11:40.846, Speaker C: End of the year, December 15.
00:11:40.910 - 00:11:41.414, Speaker A: Okay. Big.
00:11:41.454 - 00:11:51.516, Speaker C: Got another ECB meeting as well. Bank of England meeting as well. And so there's a lot of like central bank and data in the next couple of weeks that might change.
00:11:51.540 - 00:11:56.124, Speaker A: Do we get any data on like Thanksgiving and Black Friday and Cyber Monday yet? Have you seen any?
00:11:56.164 - 00:11:56.316, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:56.340 - 00:12:11.088, Speaker C: No, I mean, was it strong? It was really strong, but it's really tough to say because like, you don't get the online sales look really good, but they grow every year. So it's like, did they grow because they grow every year or was there a meaningful pop? Right.
00:12:11.136 - 00:12:11.696, Speaker A: And so.
00:12:11.800 - 00:12:17.328, Speaker C: But yes, people spent money a lot more. Seems like more than they did last year.
00:12:17.376 - 00:12:19.924, Speaker A: Which is always the trend, theoretically. Right. Yeah.
00:12:20.704 - 00:12:43.134, Speaker C: But the nature of the spending, I think, is what's most important because, you know, there's so many buy now, pay later programs happening and people buying stuff on credit in general. And so that's really where the focus is. I mean, I'll tell you, like, even when I order, like, food, they have a pay later section.
00:12:43.174 - 00:12:58.518, Speaker A: Somebody said, I saw a joke. Somebody was like, I just ordered a domino's pizza. And for fun, I decided to pay $1 a month for 24 months or something. They're even offering that now for retail, everything. I even noticed this on Apple. Pay.
00:12:58.606 - 00:12:59.166, Speaker C: Yes, exactly.
00:12:59.190 - 00:13:03.534, Speaker A: It literally says, pay later if you want pretty much do anything, apple will loan you money, apparently.
00:13:03.654 - 00:13:06.510, Speaker C: It's really crazy, but at these high interest rates.
00:13:06.542 - 00:13:08.086, Speaker A: We love credit in this country, don't we?
00:13:08.110 - 00:13:10.328, Speaker C: Yeah, it's gonna be an issue at some point.
00:13:10.486 - 00:13:11.904, Speaker A: Yeah, it's in our DNA.
00:13:13.004 - 00:13:23.284, Speaker C: Here's really what's happening. I mean, partially it's like the fed, like, has binding constraints. Like, if we just kept jacking rates up, shit would definitely break.
00:13:23.364 - 00:13:23.716, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:23.780 - 00:13:30.444, Speaker C: I mean, when tens were approaching 5% and everybody was like, oh, my God, the fiscal path is on. I mean, it still is.
00:13:30.604 - 00:13:33.564, Speaker A: I know, but that made people really sort of freak out about the fiscal.
00:13:33.604 - 00:13:41.064, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. And so what did the treasury do? The treasury was like, oh, we're not coordinated or anything. We're going to cut coupon issuance, though.
00:13:42.084 - 00:13:44.004, Speaker A: Freaking out about whether or not we can spend it.
00:13:44.004 - 00:13:46.188, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. It caused a rally in the back.
00:13:46.236 - 00:13:46.676, Speaker B: It is funny.
00:13:46.700 - 00:13:50.596, Speaker A: Cause the treasury's job is to spend money. That's their job, primarily. Yeah.
00:13:50.620 - 00:13:54.812, Speaker C: Well, it's also to manage the debt profile.
00:13:54.868 - 00:14:14.438, Speaker A: Well, for sure they have to get the money, which is the debt, but, I mean, they're the ones that. They're the bank account for the US government. Correct. And so, of course, if they start seeing. Wait a sec. Our issuance policy is resulting in strong pushback or calls for fiscal conservatism. Or then maybe we should change that.
00:14:14.438 - 00:14:16.222, Speaker A: Cause we'd prefer if they didn't come.
00:14:16.238 - 00:14:16.958, Speaker B: In and cut our money.
00:14:17.006 - 00:14:28.726, Speaker C: I mean, basically, though, here's the issue with all this stuff, is you got a bunch of people that basically only think a couple years forward, right. And there's no incentive. Like, senators are on six year election cycles.
00:14:28.870 - 00:14:31.270, Speaker A: That's the best we've got in terms of longer term incentives.
00:14:31.302 - 00:14:43.236, Speaker C: But I bet you they get elected and like, two years in, they start fundraising again. Their voters aren't really asking them to come up with solutions for where the economy is ten years from now, you've.
00:14:43.260 - 00:14:47.620, Speaker A: Said this, there's no, and you don't get elected saying you're gonna cut, basically.
00:14:47.732 - 00:15:07.224, Speaker C: And it's also like, okay, there's a ton of people under the age of 30, 35, right. They're not the most vocal people about politics. But trust me, in 20 years from now, when it's like, wait, the federal, we spent $2 trillion to just pay interest a year. That's gonna be a problem.
00:15:08.484 - 00:15:41.876, Speaker A: It is a problem, though. Your point about if you take two year House of Representative terms, you basically have to spend. I forget there's simple math on this. It changes all the time. But it's like a congressman person has to raise five grand a week to have a chance at reelection. And they have to start right away. I don't know if it's five grand the number, but so literally, you can pursue two primary strategies as a member of the house, like a home office strategy, which is where you're at home in your home state a lot, meeting with lots of constituents and typically raising money from them, or more policy focused strategy, where you are in Washington more of the time.
00:15:41.876 - 00:15:55.116, Speaker A: Maybe you're building your profile by working on high profile issues, and maybe that's how you raise money, but that you neglect your home state. And basically you have to decide, and you have to be raising. Always be raising. It's like, always be selling. You gotta always be closing.
00:15:55.140 - 00:16:18.756, Speaker C: You gotta be always the only senator not to give any endorsements, but the only senator that's made like a lot of sense to me recently about this fiscal issue and acknowledging this mismatch of incentives was Mitt Romney. He gave a speech about it, guys, we gotta address this stuff, but there's no capacity to. And then like Stanley Druckenmiller.
00:16:18.860 - 00:16:20.460, Speaker A: Sure, sure. And the investor community.
00:16:20.572 - 00:17:07.740, Speaker C: The investor community has acknowledged it. But yeah, it's tricky. And then the last thing I want to leave people with for sure is the rational me, the mid curve me tells me that this is a market in bitcoin, at least that has a lot baked in in terms of expectations of an approval. Right. But in terms of the pricing of the actual flows, the subsequent flows, it's nearly impossible to price that in full. The pathways that an ETF opens in terms of just flows, until you get those flows, it's going to be insanely difficult for this market to price in that kind of stuff. And so, to borrow a phrase from another client of ours, actually, it's by the rumor, buy the news.
00:17:07.852 - 00:17:19.268, Speaker A: Yep. Bim Nadibi from Galaxy Trading. My friend, as always, thanks for coming on Galaxy Brains. Let's go now to our guest, Pete Rizzo, editor of Bitcoin magazine. Pete, thank you so much for coming on. Galaxy brains.
00:17:19.356 - 00:17:20.452, Speaker B: Love to be here.
00:17:20.628 - 00:17:32.460, Speaker A: I've wanted to have Pete on for a while. He's been covering bitcoin for a long time. He was previously the editor at Coindesk. How long have you been actually covering bitcoin?
00:17:32.572 - 00:17:59.756, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. I had my ten year anniversary earlier this summer of my first bitcoin article, I think went out in July of 2013. Probably was following the space for a few months before that. But, yeah, I've been a bitcoin journalist officially now for ten years. I'm not sure if that's an accolade, but I've certainly been doing it for a long time and the space has evolved tremendously. But I think my initial take. I'll stand by.
00:17:59.756 - 00:18:27.396, Speaker B: It, was an optimistic look about people using this new crazy Internet currency to do different things. Like, I interviewed, like, a comedian who had, like, saved money and, like, you know, got a bunch of money off bitcoin. There was, like, I think, a local honey producer who was selling it. Right. So, like, just commerce coming together and. Yeah, looking back on it, reflecting it, I think I was, like, happy that I didn't have, like, such a negative view on it. Like, that's something I think I can stand by, but I don't think I really understood bitcoin at all.
00:18:27.500 - 00:18:39.492, Speaker A: Yeah, I know. It was. I didn't either. I got interested in bitcoin sometime in 2013 also, and really just thought it was cool. I was involved in, like, I was running a tor exit node. I was, like, on IRC. I was like.
00:18:39.492 - 00:18:57.668, Speaker A: I worked in forensic investigation at the time, so I was a little bit of a hacker, and I was a much better trader of bitcoin because I didn't really understand it or care. Right. I just thought it was cool. And then I sold a bunch of bitcoin back then, and then when I really got working on it full time, I was like, wait a second. Oh, my gosh. I should never have done that. And now I.
00:18:57.668 - 00:18:58.372, Speaker A: It's hard.
00:18:58.428 - 00:18:59.184, Speaker B: Rewind.
00:18:59.684 - 00:19:30.632, Speaker A: Exactly. Like, I mean, can you imagine? One of the things I want to talk to Pete about. Pete, you wrote an article for Forbes last year, and. Hold on, ive got it right here. Bitcoin at 21 40. Differing views on the future of money, which I recommend everyone read. And I want to ask you about this, the reason I love this piece so much is that it served as a really good mental model for understanding bitcoin culture and the views on what bitcoin is, what makes it important, just very high level.
00:19:30.632 - 00:20:08.822, Speaker A: You postulated that in your view, there were sort of three camps. There were the monetary maximalists, who believe that bitcoins is primarily used for, but also should primarily be thought of as a monetary network. Yeah. There are the platform maximalists who think bitcoin should be thought of as a technology platform, theoretically, upon which to build applications and stuff like that. And then there were the network maximalists who say the best way to think about bitcoin is as a peer to peer network. Right. Is that still true? Is that still your belief of the three camps as they exist before? We now talk about whether there's changes in the balance of power.
00:20:08.822 - 00:20:16.438, Speaker A: You said in the story, quite clearly, the piece that for the last few years at least, the monetary maximus are sort of in charge of the dominant bitcoin.
00:20:16.486 - 00:20:48.854, Speaker B: Yeah, they've been the dominant force. Yeah, I can jump in there. So I think, one, bitcoin is a technology, but two, it's very obvious that bitcoin has a culture, and I think there hasn't really been enough research or analytical work on how that culture functions. So this was essentially an attempt at that. So essentially, I was trying to look at bitcoin as a sociological movement. You can class certain people as having certain attitudes towards things. And why is that a framework that's helpful? Well, bitcoin is a technology, and it's improving, but I don't think that it has essentially reached its goal.
00:20:48.854 - 00:21:33.622, Speaker B: You can say that most of the participants within the bitcoin ecosystem are trying to improve it in some way, or think that it needs to grow or extend in other ways. That's where you get into what is the bitcoin culture? Why do we have it and how does it function? This was an attempt to clarify that and essentially created three buckets, and it used, we were saying this 21 40 lens. So why 21 40? So at some point, all the bitcoin will be mined, and there's this question of how the network will continue to operate under fundamentally different assumptions than it operates today. This is a longstanding bitcoin conversation with a lot of history and lineage going all the way back to Satoshi. But essentially, we know that the bitcoin network will operate differently in the future, and we, as participants of the network, are building towards that. And there's different attitudes. So essentially, this, as you said, sorted into three attitudes.
00:21:33.622 - 00:22:21.470, Speaker B: And I think it was an interesting lens to examine this, because as you said, I think certain cultures within bitcoin, as you get these sort of hype cycles. My recent thinking on this, maybe not to kind of deviate too much, but is that essentially the sociologies are kind of tied to market cycles, which is essentially when we have a big run up in the bitcoin price. We need to explain this to outsiders. We, the bitcoin culture needs to explain why is bitcoin not going up, why are more people interested in it. And usually that is a certain culture like of comes to the fore. And over the last cycle, really, I think monetary maximalism was the big culture. So if you onboarded into bitcoin from 2020 to 2021, it's likely that the version of bitcoin you know, is essentially bitcoin is money.
00:22:21.470 - 00:23:02.374, Speaker B: It's the best money that's ever existed. Bitcoin is the only decentralized cryptocurrency. And it's only essentially its decentralization is tied in some way to this monetary policy that no one can change. But that is a very distinctive view. And that view has a lot of challenges from other people within bitcoin who agree with a lot of it, but also disagree with some things. Alternative view would be, I think, a group that's kind of coming to the fore now, which essentially the platform maximalists, people who want to build stuff on bitcoin, use money for different types of applications and look to what's going on in other cryptocurrencies like stable coins or DeFi or nfts, and see market activity that they believe should or has to come back to bitcoin. There's a little bit of a difference there.
00:23:02.374 - 00:23:48.784, Speaker B: But yeah, essentially this framework was an attempt to kind of outline where are we going? Because I do think that bitcoin's culture tends to evolve. And I think that the toughest time to be a bitcoiner is your first cycle within bitcoin, because you tend to get exposed and onboarded to bitcoin through a very specific culture. And then what you find is, because we don't understand bitcoin completely yet, the culture tends to shift and change, and it tends to move towards questions that are unresolved. So my hypothesis back then was essentially we had a dominant culture. That culture became dominant because it offered certain answers to questions. And in this case, I think the monetary maximalist offered the easiest explanation for why bitcoin and not crypto. That's essentially what they were able to offer.
00:23:48.784 - 00:24:14.060, Speaker B: But there were cracks in that ideology or essentially, there was some data that didn't quite compute. Essentially, we did see the rise in other cryptocurrency markets of stablecoins, defi nfts markets that now have been around for, like, ten years and seem to have some degree of staying power. And so I think now you're sort of. The bitcoin movement seems like it wants to integrate some new form of information.
00:24:14.172 - 00:24:14.396, Speaker A: Right.
00:24:14.420 - 00:24:55.964, Speaker B: There's like a hunger within the culture to explore some of these things that before were kind of off limits or were viewed as taboo. So, yeah, again, I think the framework was, it tried to capture at the time what I thought the snapshot of the culture was, tried to kind of frame the different technological viewpoints of those cultures. And I think it's interesting now, as you said, because a year later, those cultures are in a very different vantage point. Some are ascendant, some are descendant, and we have a very different picture of what bitcoin looks like. And, yeah, I think it is much different than it was even a year ago. And I think part of that is the market is down. People want new answers for things, but fundamentally, we have to continue exploring and developing bitcoin, and we don't have all the answers yet.
00:24:56.044 - 00:25:01.440, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's an excellent framework. I think about it. I use it as part of my mental model a lot.
00:25:01.472 - 00:25:03.408, Speaker B: And you're the only fan of that article.
00:25:03.496 - 00:25:04.376, Speaker A: Is that true?
00:25:04.520 - 00:25:10.184, Speaker B: Did everyone else. Of all the Forbes articles I think I ever wrote, I think that is, like, the least viewed article.
00:25:10.224 - 00:25:17.008, Speaker A: Are you serious? I think that's one of my. I've read a lot of your work over the years, and that's, I think, my favorite piece, and I actually.
00:25:17.096 - 00:25:22.552, Speaker B: I think it's the most cited. Like, people come up and talk to me about it the most. But, yeah, I think it's, like, from an actual raw analytics.
00:25:22.608 - 00:25:40.760, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, there was one. You must have seen, the one that Nick Carter and I think at the time Hasu wrote called Visions of Bitcoin from, like, 2018, which was a similar effort. They actually came up with a, like, 100% stacked area chart, you know, like a market share chart of the narratives in bitcoin over time. It's, like, really interesting.
00:25:40.792 - 00:25:41.688, Speaker B: Yeah, I have seen that one.
00:25:41.736 - 00:26:05.424, Speaker A: Yeah, it's cool. I love this question because I think it does change a lot. I think it's also really great. And, you know, one of the things I tell, for example, researchers on my team at Galaxy, when they join, if they've entered crypto, which many of them have, you know, I'm older than a lot of them, you know, later than I did. I say, look, maybe they came in because they liked NFTs or DeFi or whatever else. Not everyone comes through the same path these days. There's a lot happening in the cryptocurrency world.
00:26:05.424 - 00:26:24.480, Speaker A: But I say you really should go back and read certainly the complete Nakamoto or whatever that they have on Nook Nakamoto institute. You should go and read some of the old bitcoin talk forums because you need to understand that this happens sometimes when they say, hey, we should do on a blockchain, I'm like how Finney suggested that already you should go back to.
00:26:24.632 - 00:26:45.640, Speaker B: The whole crypto industry is essentially a seeing eye picture. The longer you've been there, like, the more chance that you see the picture within. But the people who are new just see straight noise. They keep telling you that they understand the picture, but they don't. They don't have enough context. And one of the things that you're alluding to that I think is very true, is that. And this is kind of been the focal point of my work or why I work on bitcoin history.
00:26:45.640 - 00:27:20.784, Speaker B: People are like, why would you do such a thing? I think that we have a tremendous brain drain and sort of this returnal summer that happens where every crypto market explosion that happens again in bitcoin and without, you have this tremendous recycling of new ideas. Right. But at the root of it, there are these things that are actually like, core to kind of the problems that everybody is working on. I actually see the bitcoin and crypto markets as being fundamentally pretty similar. I actually view the cryptocurrency markets as like an offshoot of bitcoin. Right. Essentially, in order for them to been created, people joined bitcoin and then they left for some reason.
00:27:20.784 - 00:27:24.344, Speaker B: So that makes them sociologically attached to bitcoin.
00:27:24.464 - 00:27:26.560, Speaker A: They're part of the bitcoin lineage, basically.
00:27:26.672 - 00:27:49.264, Speaker B: They are. And I think this is really important to understand. Right. So as a journalist in the space, I'm often kind of forced to, like, you know, kind of talk about my position as also a bitcoin maximalist and where that comes from. I think part of it is that I did see that happen firsthand. In the beginning, it was really just bitcoin. Bitcoin had pure mass in terms of market share and ideology from Wall street to Silicon Valley.
00:27:49.264 - 00:28:15.844, Speaker B: This was the thing I did see the emergent crypto offshoot culture form. And I think right now, within bitcoin, to really zoom out. I think we essentially have this question of what is bitcoin? And there are three sociologies with some answer to that question. Right? Bitcoin. Our thesis, if you're a maximalist, is that bitcoin is the full and complete instantiation of that idea. We don't need any other cryptocurrencies. Right? Satoshi invented bitcoin.
00:28:15.844 - 00:28:58.156, Speaker B: We might have to improve it, but for all intents and purposes, like that is the invention. You have the crypto crowd, which essentially attempts to kind of position bitcoin as limited or like, it needs to be extended, or this is a revolution that needs to be continued in other ways. And that's their justification. And then you have the no coiners, who are the last group, who just reject that any of this is valuable. And I think you actually have to step that far out to really see that there are sort of like three main cultures. I would say, why are they different cultures? Because they have different answers to a fundamental question. And then they establish a worldview based on that question, which is, what is bitcoin? What did Satoshi actually accomplish? And then within the bitcoin group, there are even sub splinters of that, which is essentially like, because we know that bitcoin needs to succeed in the future, it needs to be cryptographically secure.
00:28:58.156 - 00:29:22.064, Speaker B: We wanted to scale to 8 billion users, or most people have that idea. There are different sociologies within bitcoin. So it's actually interesting that from a cultural and sociological perspective, I think you can zoom all the way out. I think that's all the way out. The 10,000 foot view of essentially bitcoin crypto. No coin fiat land. And then even within bitcoin, there are fissures and factions.
00:29:22.064 - 00:29:31.608, Speaker B: I think, again, some of these cultures relate. I have an unpublished article that attempts to coagulate these theories. Again, like, I don't know who's interested in this stuff.
00:29:31.696 - 00:29:47.232, Speaker A: I like this stuff a lot. This is the. I love the. I think also, to be clear, I think in bitcoin and crypto markets generally, they're such a narrative driven market still, even for reasons as simple as it's hard to understand how to invest on a fundamental basis.
00:29:47.328 - 00:30:31.392, Speaker B: Well, I'll give you the one that I think I spend the most time on and that most relates to. I think what you want to talk about with journalism stuff is that I think the biggest ideology is crypto agnosticism. And I think the problem is that it's most often misidentified as not being an odd ideology. And this is actually something that, being in journalism, then coming to be having a market viewpoint, I had to reckon with. And I think it's essentially that the crypto media as it exists, and the crypto, even the investment industry as it exists, it has to take this sort of objective viewpoint. And what it settles on is this idea that essentially all crypto assets are like stocks. There's not really a material difference between them, and that anyone who has a specific ideology about them isn't a good faith market participant.
00:30:31.392 - 00:31:09.984, Speaker B: They're someone with a skewed sort of worldview. And I think the problem with that is it disregards a lot of actual data, which is that some of these systems are better or worse for users. And that was something that I had to really think about a lot as a journalist early on, because journalists of jobs that are ideological, the job of journalism is pretty ideological. I mean, there's even this kind of thing when you go to journalism school, where it's like your job is to afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted. That's one of the core tenants. You're supposed to essentially try to restore order or some sense of justice to the world. That's why people get into journalism is there's that morality of that calling, and you can get into all the stuff around that.
00:31:09.984 - 00:31:54.368, Speaker B: But I introduced that because I think the consumer harm standpoint is something that I think if there's something that unites a journalist, they should broadly be against stuff that causes consumer harm, and they should be for stuff that's better for people. Let's just. If we get into, like, sort of liberal, western us world journalism, that's kind of why it exists. Right? But then their lens on the bitcoin, crypto, crypto industry tends to either fall into sort of no coinerism, like they either just reject that there's a meaningful invention here, or to the extent that they buy into the market, they're essentially, again, this crypto agnosticism idea, which is that everything is kind of equal. These things are all competing. Their value propositions are just purely defined by their founders, and the market will decide. And I think that's a very problematic viewpoint.
00:31:54.368 - 00:32:49.256, Speaker B: And I think part of my movement over to the bitcoin side was to push back against that and basically say, I don't actually think that is very correct. And I think we actually should be moving more to our market where there's more thesis based cryptocurrency journalism, because I think that is actually more healthy. So with the Bitcoin magazine perspective, our thesis is a bitcoin only bitcoin maximalist perspective. And I think that's useful because you, as a market participant can read that information, and maybe you know that it's coming from a certain ideological bent. But it's not trying to be something that this other form of journalism in the space, which I think we have way too much of, is where it's like, you know, they're out to cover doge ordinals because there's money. Like somebody made $25 million on a cat drawing or something, right? There's nothing. Because I think that part of the industry has sort of tried to get to this general market's perspective.
00:32:49.256 - 00:33:16.698, Speaker B: They really want to treat the cryptocurrency sector as a mature market. And I just wholeheartedly say to them all the time that based on where this technology is, that just seems very untrue. Because if you spend any time kind of looking at the underlying technology and where the thesis are and how we're moving, I still think it's very early days in the whole sector. Right. I was on a panel in Lugano. It was called bits versus sats. Dumb argument.
00:33:16.698 - 00:34:02.664, Speaker B: But essentially one of the things I said was, it's interesting to think, like, what if Satoshi had never made one bitcoin unit? What if the only unit was a Satoshi? Bitcoin would still have never reached $0.01 parity 14 years later. And it's very likely that media coverage of bitcoin would better reflect, I think, the actual state of the technology. If bitcoin was still less than a cent, most of the world wouldn't care. Maybe you and I would even be here. But I think that units bias has driven a lot more coverage and attention to a technology that's still fundamentally pretty rudimentary. If you look at the history of money, this is something that the maximalists say all the time, but we're very early in terms of and knowing what the stuff is.
00:34:02.664 - 00:34:15.416, Speaker B: And then once you're in kind of like the defi land of, like, tokenized everything, multiple layers, like nobody even knows. Like, even the smartest people like you just. You can't. We can't know what the hell you're talking. Like, nobody knows.
00:34:15.480 - 00:34:25.112, Speaker A: Like, maybe it's very early, very young, very nascent. Yeah. And so your point, though, too, is that there's, like, a relativism that the journalists end up playing with. They try to say, okay, if we're.
00:34:25.128 - 00:34:27.064, Speaker B: Gonna cover, they try not to have an opinion.
00:34:27.144 - 00:34:30.704, Speaker A: They try to lead to them counting sort of everything as equal. Right.
00:34:30.744 - 00:35:27.628, Speaker B: When you're saying the argument there is that is the highly problematic opinion, because you end up supporting technologies that ultimately aren't good for the user. So the idea was, as a user who holds money in bitcoin, you have a higher degree of assurances as a user than someone on other cryptocurrencies. And that's undeniably true merely from the fact that how bitcoin launched, how it currently operates, and the influence of certain developer teams within the bitcoin framework. Undeniably true that that is the case, I would argue. But again, the idea here is that their whole goal is to obfuscate that question or not even address it, because essentially they want to cover the market activity because that's what users are interested in. So they end up sort of just playing into the investment mania that has sort of defined these cryptocurrency bubbles. To me, I think the crypto media, and again, early on, it was a lot more of a technology thing.
00:35:27.628 - 00:36:01.896, Speaker B: Coindesk, when it originally started, was a technology publication. We were a lot more an early wired than I. What you have today, where the block works and the block and coindesk, they attempt to position themselves as they're covering the new market. They're the new market journalists. And if you're only smart enough, and if you only have the right coins, and if it's just you had to get in the right coins at the right time, the right knowledge, you could have won big. That's the whole thing, that whether they know it or not, they're participating in this whole system. Right.
00:36:02.080 - 00:36:09.816, Speaker A: They would probably thing argue. Yeah, they would probably argue that they're not. You're saying it's an inevitable consequence of their style of coverage, which is really interesting.
00:36:09.920 - 00:37:04.378, Speaker B: Yeah. They feed into this idea, which is that the coin market cap ization of cryptocurrency, I think they don't realize that pre 2017, that wasn't an aspect of the industry at all. There wasn't this idea that there was a market, that all these technologies were good and the market was going to be this like, benevolent or not benevolent, but this very sophisticated arbiter of innovation that the average person's like, what do they know about computer science? And the answer is, they don't. So what is the average person, with their $5, how are they helping us adjudicate matters computer science? By going 50 x long on Dogecoin, on Bitmax? The answer is they're not. That is not what they're doing. And if you accept that that is not what they're doing. Then you have to sort of question why you're involved in a system that positions that as logical activity.
00:37:04.466 - 00:37:35.754, Speaker A: Interesting. Pete, I want to ask you about Coindesk, the acquisition by the cryptocurrency exchange. Bullish. Who is it? Yan at blockworks had argued that this was a negative for the space because now you have a conflicted exchange owning a journalism outlet. But historically speaking, Coindesk was also owned by DCG, and it was quite good at maintaining that journalistic barrier. But in general, what are your. So I don't think it's a foregone conclusion that there's.
00:37:35.754 - 00:37:41.418, Speaker A: That it's a bad transaction at all. But what are your thoughts on it as a former editor at coindesk?
00:37:41.506 - 00:37:54.458, Speaker B: Yeah, good question. I mean, I think that editorial independence and freedom is something that you're always fighting for, no matter who is in charge of your organization. Right. So this just gets into, like, regular journalism funding as being a problem. You know, just generally just keep in.
00:37:54.466 - 00:37:58.858, Speaker A: Mind, like, Dow Jones owns the Wall Street Journal. It's not like this can't happen.
00:37:58.946 - 00:38:36.250, Speaker B: And then you have Jeff Bezos, who owns Washington Post, and there's always somebody with some interest who runs it. I think coin s has done a great job historically pushing back against that. We saw the reporting they did about DCG when DCG was the owner. I think more, what I think the conflict really does become when you have these different owners is really on the business model side, because, again, journalism is such a problematic business model where if you look at most of the major journalism outlets, most of them are philanthropically run. They're run at a loss because people think it's a greater good in order for this journalism to exist. That was certainly true under the DCG era. I think that it'll be interesting to see.
00:38:36.250 - 00:39:12.296, Speaker B: I was really against that. I always thought that the crypto industry participants should strive to be more free market. They should be run for profit. I think there's a number of reasons for that, but one of them makes them more market savvy. They have to actually interact with it. I think that goes to what I was saying before about this agnosticism that exists in crypto media. And I think part of it is that they're isolated from it, especially the ones that are run with a big set of money that they don't really have to actually acquire from the market is that they're not really accountable to the market in the same way they can just operate outside of it.
00:39:12.296 - 00:39:41.778, Speaker B: Then you get the point where they have the same situation now, where it's like DCG was the sole owner. DCG went under. I won't tell you how many people told me that would never happen, but again, I think, I thought the odds were always pretty high. 99% of startups fail. There was no reason that DCG was somehow immune from that. Bullish is the same, it's a for profit startup, can have the same issues. I think the other TLDR is just that coindesk isn't as systematically important as it used to be.
00:39:41.778 - 00:40:43.364, Speaker B: During the bear market of 2014 to 15, it really was the only game in town, news and information. And now we really do have blockworks in the block and a lot of other for profit bitcoin media and crypto media that are good. I think we really just do need to move more towards thesis driven stuff, though, because I do think that the idea that these crypto journalists can kind of be agnostic or objective, I just don't know how you look at the failures of FTX and then what happened with Luna and not say that like, hey, we need to double down and actually have informed kind of journalism happening in the space, and that journalism happening at the technology layer, not the markets layer, because the markets layer, it isn't as interesting. If you covered the Joge coin run up, how do you feel about them? Was that something that was worth your time and energy to cover? Was that worthwhile? I don't know. I think that the crypto media really does have to grapple with this idea that to an extent they are capable of pushing back on these market actors. Somebody could have always done due diligence on FTX. That was always possible.
00:40:43.364 - 00:41:06.836, Speaker B: We just didn't see that happen until much later in the game. I don't know. I think it'll be interesting. Obviously they have a great team there. I think people should try to hold them accountable, and if there are irregularities, point that out. But I think that it's great that they'll continue. I think it says a lot more about DCG's market position than anything else and just the extreme need there for capital.
00:41:06.836 - 00:41:07.228, Speaker B: Preston.
00:41:07.276 - 00:41:42.096, Speaker A: Pete, let's switch gears a little bit. I want to talk about the platform maximalist cohort, because you mentioned when you were giving some of the overview that there were perhaps some that are ascendant, some that are descendant, etcetera. And I think it's very clear, I've argued, particularly since the, I guess, invention discovery of ordinals, more of a half invention, half discovery the technology. Right? So when Casey Rodemore released the ord client. Right. Which was, I guess, technically mid December of last year, but really January. So we've seen an explosion of activity we hadn't seen in bitcoin, at least in years, I would say.
00:41:42.096 - 00:41:45.032, Speaker A: Right, so primarily digital collection.
00:41:45.048 - 00:41:45.152, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:41:45.168 - 00:42:05.992, Speaker A: What's happening? Yeah. And some tokens, very inefficient standards for tokens like BRC 20, but nonetheless less. They're driving significant volume. And you're also now seeing multiple teams that are planning to build sovereign roll ups on bitcoin. I know of at least two. Right. There's taproot wizards, Khazar labs, and then there's chain way that are both in the market and planning to launch roll ups.
00:42:05.992 - 00:42:20.464, Speaker A: There's discussion. Paolo from Tether has said that he prefers. Right, exactly. And he's still saying RGB is the best way to do tokens. You got taproot assets protocol now or soon. Right. So I'm not crazy.
00:42:20.464 - 00:42:28.992, Speaker A: When I look at it and see that now, I know there's a lot of pushback to this part of the culture, also from the monetary maximalist wing of the party, but it is ascendant, is it not?
00:42:29.048 - 00:43:23.368, Speaker B: It's definitely ascendant. I think the question then is you have to kind of reckon of what is its motivation and what is its attempt? And I think that there's different classifications of that. So I think I try to be a little bit more neutral in this argument where essentially, like, I actually think that it's good for bitcoin that we have both of these camps, and then I'll kind of backtrack and say how I got to that perspective. But essentially, I think that from the ordinal's wing, these tend to be more people coming at this from the platform maximalist perspective. They tend to have this view that in order for bitcoin to be cryptographically secure in the future, we, the bitcoin users, need to create a fee economy and demand for bitcoin, and they seem to be of the persuasion that any means necessary of achieving that is good. So let's just kind of put that in a box. That I think is what they are saying.
00:43:23.368 - 00:43:44.634, Speaker B: And I think you can look at the kind of most extreme versions of that. So the least extreme versions, that's essentially their claim. Their claim is essentially, we know that bitcoin is going to be different in the future. We know that we need to generate this fee revenue or bitcoin. The economy needs to generate a certain amount of fee revenue or be cryptographically secure. That's kind of claim one. There actually are very good counterarguments on the monetary Maxwell side of why that's correct.
00:43:44.634 - 00:44:21.778, Speaker B: But that is their first claim. And their second claim then is that because they think that is true, they think that by any means of establishing a fee market in the bitcoin economy is good. And so they see themselves as kind of morally aligned to bitcoin on those two points. And then I think, again, you can debate both sides of it, but they're fundamentally making both those claims. I don't think they're very interested in the counterarguments. And the counterarguments would be essentially like, well, a lot of the stuff that we're doing on ordinals now is essentially not real value or not a real economy.
00:44:21.906 - 00:44:23.530, Speaker A: Even spam, they might say.
00:44:23.682 - 00:45:31.434, Speaker B: Yeah, the spam argument I have a lot more of a problem with because I think that's used to kind of dismiss like a much more nuanced conversation, which is, I think they're actually arguing those two points. And the monetary maximalists, I think, need to argue back on those two points, but sort of haven't done that. But again, I think that because they think this any means necessary approach is correct and good, they therefore are able to reconcile things that, from a network perspective, maybe aren't that great. So a good example would be, I wrote a separate article for bitcoin magazine that was called how to be a bitcoin maximalist and ultimately outlined eight or nine ways things that you could do to be more of a bitcoin maximalist. I think the most interesting one is that the number one kind of tenants of bitcoin maximalism is that we, as bitcoin maximalists, want to ensure the working of the bitcoin software in perpetuity. That's our foremost goal. I think the ordinals group puts a little bit of pressure on that because essentially they're saying that things like, okay, well, somebody pays for a four megabyte block and then displaces economic activity because they're filling that full block.
00:45:31.434 - 00:46:28.890, Speaker B: And you have to then forever carry this picture of this whale or frog or whatever that is objectively you doing something that's not maybe great for the network other than using the defense points that you would have to argue. And then maybe we should discourage that because ultimately our long term goal is we want bitcoin to succeed. So everybody is kind of arguing from the same framework, but then they have different reasons. But yeah, I think that it is certainly ascendant to your points. And I think that it is ascendant because there was a certain, I think, moralism that came with bitcoin, monetary maximalism, which is essentially that in order to argue why these things aren't good, you have to sort of argue in ways that kind of make it seem like you're limiting people's freedoms, right? Or you're trying to tell people they shouldn't or can't do things. And there's a certain wing of the bitcoin culture that is very averse to that and just says like, no, I can do that. Like, fuck you.
00:46:28.890 - 00:47:25.894, Speaker B: If I want to buy this picture of a frog, I'm going to spend my money on it because I think it's good for bitcoin. I'm going to do that. So I think you have this interesting kind of culture war playing out. But I think the fissure line, if you move away from the technology just to maybe take a little bit out of that lens, is that the real question, I think that these two camps are fighting about now is should bitcoin compete with the cryptocurrency economy? Should bitcoin as a platform, protocol, whatever, actively compete for use cases against other cryptocurrencies? Now the ordinals group, the more platform maximalist people, they're undeniably pro this position. They want to go to war with the cryptocurrency sector. They want to destroy ethereum and they want to take use cases away from it. They want to take stable coins, they want to take nfts and they don't want to take deFi, they want to take use cases that have been established on other chains and bring them back to bitcoin because they think that is better for bitcoin and better for users.
00:47:25.894 - 00:48:02.998, Speaker B: The monetary maximalist side, I think walked themselves a little bit in the corner because from that positioning they deny that the cryptocurrency markets exist or are valuable at all. And so because they deny that they're valuable at all they essentially have to reject the idea that you would even compete for markets. So the ordinals people kind of have this idea that we were going to out compete the other cryptocurrencies and take these markets. And then the monetary maximalist view is like, these markets are crap and we don't even want, there's no reason that you should ever want to.
00:48:03.046 - 00:48:13.124, Speaker A: This is where they start saying like bitcoin not crypto. And you're saying the platform maximals are more bitcoin versus crypto crypto, right. Whereas the dominant lighter than that.
00:48:13.164 - 00:48:20.012, Speaker B: I think their point is that bitcoin is crypto, and that all the things that you can do within the cryptocurrency world you can do on bitcoin.
00:48:20.148 - 00:48:39.844, Speaker A: And this was an old view, right? This is another cyclical thing here, because this used to literally be said back on the bitcoin talk forums, that, like altcoins, were testnets for bitcoin. That theoretically, why we didn't want to add it to bitcoin at that time, if something was proposed, was, well, maybe we should test it first on another chain, and if it's really good, maybe one day it'll be incorporated.
00:48:40.144 - 00:49:21.480, Speaker B: Yes. And I think that if there's a criticism I have of the maximalist kind of wing, is that a lot of them actually do have very valuable expertise. So you take somebody like, I did a fireside at bitcoin Amsterdam with Jacqueline Zucco, who's somebody who's like, been a bitcoin builder for ten years, worked a lot of different technologies, built RGB, which is literally a token standard. And it's, you know, he doesn't like ordinals and thinks that we should do something else. I think it should always be okay within bitcoin for us to reject whether some protocol has met our standard. A great example would be wrapped bitcoin. I think the bitcoin culture has roundly rejected the idea that wrapped bitcoin is a part of the ecosystem.
00:49:21.480 - 00:49:47.542, Speaker B: We just largely don't care. And we've sort of decided that doesn't meet our bar for innovation. We don't consider that an innovation. I think the interesting thing about ordinals, though, is I think that it does. I think objectively, from the. The framework of the people who are in the NFT market, ordinals is a much better protocol for them to be doing what they're doing than the things that they have on Ethereum and other places. And I'll give you a few reasons why.
00:49:47.542 - 00:50:25.328, Speaker B: So one of them is that the problem that the NFT sector really has right now is their projects are just bleeding out. There's no actual value to the random, arbitrary data they're storing on ipfs, and that has no actual relation to Ethereum. So when these markets really deteriorate, they just come apart. I think the interesting thing that Casey Rotomar was able to do is that he was able to actually tie with ordinals the value of a bitcoin more empirically to the actual NFT. And there's a few reasons for that. In order for you to have an ordinal on the ordinals protocol, you have to own a satoshi, and that satoshi is actual bitcoin. And not only that, but that Satoshi could have other properties.
00:50:25.328 - 00:51:14.510, Speaker B: It can be rarer than other bitcoins. So you actually have this kind of component where if you look at what people are doing in ordinals, they're launching projects that, that are not only being minted on actual bitcoin, and thus will always have the value of that bitcoin, even if bitcoin goes up over time. But there's even whole projects being minted out on uncommon sats. What are uncommon sats? Well, they're the first satoshi of every bitcoin block. So it's something that will never go away, will likely only continue to get more rare as people hoard these kinds of things. So now you're looking at an NFT ecosystem where like, like, again, from a user perspective, if someone is going to buy nfts, would you rather them buy nfts in this ecosystem where it's the data's on chain, it's stored by the bitcoin consensus, not on IP fest, it's tied intrinsically to the value of an actual bitcoin. So at the worst, at the end of the day, you have 10,000 satoshis.
00:51:14.510 - 00:51:44.094, Speaker B: Maybe you can pass that on your forebears if your art project doesn't turn out. And then because of the rarity factors of ordinals as protocol, there's weird gamification ways for the projects to just be more intrinsically tied to bitcoin. As things get more rare, there's a little bit more of a connection. Again, like Luke Junior would sort of dismiss all this stuff that isn't intrinsically to do with bitcoin, but it's enough. Right? You really see these things start multiplying. Like projects look for rare sats. The rare sats gain value because they look for them, they mint on them.
00:51:44.094 - 00:53:05.406, Speaker B: Those projects gain value. There's a lot more of a kind of combustion of economic factors that you just purely just never saw in the NFT ecosystem. So I think because of that, yeah, I think some of the stuff, stuff is just not going to go away and because there are users to win from these other networks. Yeah, I think that the people who have this idea that we can take markets away from other cryptocurrency ecosystems, I'm sort of, from the standpoint of godspeed for me as a bitcoin holder, that just makes my bitcoin more valuable. So from my standpoint, I often say to the people who are trying to force me into one of the cultures, why shouldn't I have two cultures that are competing for my attention or my belief that's actually better for me, that you're both advancing bitcoin in your own ways and people try to pin me down on one side or the other. It's like, maybe this is a sign of bitcoin's maturity, is that we actually just have competing cultures, and those competing cultures are making bitcoin more valuable in their own ways. And is one of them rights or wrong? It's like, do they have to be? Because there's no fundamental, kind of like existential question that they're really debating about other than this fee issue, which we've got 100 years, we've got bitcoins continue to be mined until 21 40.
00:53:05.406 - 00:53:32.664, Speaker B: So, yeah, I think the likely scenario is you end up with multiple competing factions within bitcoin. I think that's a net positive. Look, do I think there's going to be a lot of weird trash that comes out of the ordinal movement as we build more protocols and experiment with. Oh, for sure, you're just at the tip of the iceberg of how much weird, nonsensical stuff is going to happen because of that. But I can't stop that. You can't stop that. These are just economic forces at work.
00:53:32.664 - 00:54:18.380, Speaker B: How many more chains are people going to launch before they start being interested in building these things on bitcoin, which they know will last forever? It doesn't take a lot for you to realize that some of these people who got burned on Solana because they loved Sam Bankman, fried and then he left, or they're working on a chain that maybe doesn't even exist anymore before they start moving over to bitcoin and giving a serious consideration. So, yeah, I see that as part of the ecosystem as just. That's not going to stop. You're in the early innings. This is compound and defy summer. If you want a crypto degeneration analogy, this is the shot that went up. And, yeah, it's going to be bubbly just like Defi Summer was, where sometimes it's going to whittle down to nothing and you're going to be like, oh, what happened to that thing? Is it gone? And then it's going to come back.
00:54:18.380 - 00:54:22.412, Speaker B: You're going to get the next wave of yam farming or like, whatever, and.
00:54:22.428 - 00:54:24.516, Speaker A: It'S going to be fits and starts. Yeah.
00:54:24.540 - 00:54:25.676, Speaker B: So you know what I'm talking about.
00:54:25.780 - 00:54:27.140, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I agree.
00:54:27.252 - 00:54:29.628, Speaker B: It's going to be jerky for sure.
00:54:29.676 - 00:55:01.842, Speaker A: And I think, I love the point you make that one of the things that they clearly agree on is that bitcoin should be competing for the other use cases. That is very clear when you look at some, for example, these teams that are trying to build sovereign roll ups. We can't actually tie today roll up sequencer behavior to bitcoin consensus without a hard fork. Yeah, so you wouldn't be able to like slash, for example, the roll up stakers, but you can do a pretty good peg in and peg out, or at least about as trustworthy as all the other bridges across networks. And quickly.
00:55:01.938 - 00:55:15.162, Speaker B: I take a standpoint on this with like BitVM, right? Like you remember the BitVM proposal that came out where it's like, you know, how many thousands of developers looked at bitcoin and then thought it could never do this type of smart contract? Seriously, like twelve.
00:55:15.258 - 00:55:16.690, Speaker A: And then they came up with it.
00:55:16.882 - 00:55:52.102, Speaker B: Launched other chains, right? So when people sort of ask me, it's like, why do you want to be long bitcoin? Well it's like, like look at this thing where it's like it took twelve years for us to figure out how to do something that looked like a native smart contract just with bitcoin as it is. And it's like the difference between that and the twelve years of other people who built other things is that those twelve years of people who built other things are now working on assumptions that are no longer valid. And this is always the thing with Ethereum, like when it came out where it's like a lot of the assumptions that they built Ethereum on originally are simply no longer valid, right?
00:55:52.118 - 00:55:55.670, Speaker A: It was that you couldn't do these things on bitcoin. But if it turns out you can.
00:55:55.782 - 00:56:39.888, Speaker B: Even this idea that like, you know, mining consolidation was bad was a huge, a huge portion of like the Ethereum original movement was all about getting rid of Asics. ASIC miners were bad. ASIC mining would have inevitably lead to the centralization of bitcoin. And this. And you net you. When is the last time you've heard anyone in Ethereum? Never. You will never hear them talk about this because now what we know is that, that the economics of bitcoin mining are such that even though you have large players, the capital risk is so high that the turnover is so meaningful because it's so hard to be competitive for so long a time, that part of the ecosystem is actually decentralized enough and not only that, with the energy compounding, which now we can do, bitcoin can compete for energy sources that have no other demand.
00:56:39.888 - 00:57:27.024, Speaker B: Again, these were things that weren't part of the conversation. I think other cryptocurrencies will always suffer from this inherent defect, which is that they were started by someone who had some value proposition in mind, they had some intention for what they were doing. And the more we go further in time, you can just see that those intentions are degrading. And so what does that give you in terms of the confidence of that project? The project then has to overcome the degradation of the reasons of why it was originally started. And that to me is what has always been seemed so unlikely. That just seems exceedingly unlikely, because it's like the longer you go forward time, the more people are incentivized to work on bitcoin, the more they will come up with smart things. And the more these other people who build other more limited trade offs, the less effective they become.
00:57:27.024 - 00:57:33.864, Speaker B: This is where I think you just see the long case for bitcoin. But again, is it going to be a long time? Of course, yes.
00:57:35.244 - 00:58:14.774, Speaker A: Well, because we're not just going to hard fork upgrade to shoehorn in some stuff. In fact, if you look, one of the most interesting criticisms of ethereum, in my opinion, is, is that its code complexity is just out of control. And you hear this from Peter Spagali, I think, is how I say it. We can remember how to say the guy's last name. He's identified this as basically the biggest risk facing ethereum, that the code is so unbelievably complex and patchwork together that it's a giant ball of wire and basically no one actually knows how it all works anymore. Every time that some issue comes up that they have to mitigate, they implement something that causes new issues that they then have to mitigate. And it's.
00:58:14.774 - 00:58:24.746, Speaker A: And whereas, and that is largely a consequence of literally almost a decade at this point of, I guess, you know, seven years or so of major upgrades.
00:58:24.850 - 00:58:30.810, Speaker B: Like altering it all have to look at. And again, I don't take as negativistic of a view on ethereum as like most.
00:58:30.842 - 00:58:32.522, Speaker A: No, I mean, nor do I don't.
00:58:32.538 - 00:59:19.550, Speaker B: Think, like there's the people who went and built Ethereum were like morally bad or corrupt. No, nor do I misguided on some of their assumptions. And I think that to what you're talking about, it's like, really, you have to understand where that technology came from and it came from people again, who broke away from bitcoin with certain ideas. And because they did that, what they achieve always has to be graded against their initial assumptions, because essentially they can't escape their initial assumptions for building the thing, because without the original assumptions, they would not have built the thing. It's a weird circular argument where, as you're pointing out, and look, I'm not a coder. I don't actually know. I can't materially evaluate the claim whether Ethereum has gotten more technically complex.
00:59:19.550 - 01:00:07.484, Speaker B: It seems that way. But I can tell you that the reasons that they started Ethereum, if you were to write them down on a piece of paper, you could certainly cross a bunch of them out and say that these are no longer relevant. The difference is that while Ethereum is the total, the product of those ideas, bitcoin is not. Bitcoin is decentralized system that can, new people can come in with different ideas and it can sort of move the culture a little bit. But there's never the base kind of concept of there being the monetary policy, there being certain rules. We're never going to upgrade to change these rules in a majoritarian type way because these things are there. Bitcoin has a better, I think, sounder moral footprint, or just not moral, but just intellectual footprint.
01:00:07.484 - 01:00:23.264, Speaker B: The topical area is just a lot more known knowns in bitcoin. There's no knowns, there's no unknowns, and we're working to reduce that. But it's much more cohesive than these other things because these other things were just purely the product of certain people who are still involved in them, who had certain assumptions.
01:00:24.444 - 01:00:43.666, Speaker A: Pete, before we wrap, you are the editor of Bitcoin magazine. Bitcoin 2024 is scheduled to be, I believe, in mid July or so of next summer in Nashville. So I guess we could say bring it home. BTC Inc. Is a Nashville. Yeah, we get on your. Exactly.
01:00:43.666 - 01:00:56.962, Speaker A: And you got Bitcoin park there in Nashville, which I'm actually a member of. What can you tell us about it? I'm sure that's not your data. Ja. You got a whole team that runs the conference. But is it going to be awesome in Nashville? It's been in Miami the past three years.
01:00:57.058 - 01:01:07.106, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, look, I mean, I think that bitcoin conferences are always awesome, no matter how big or small they are. Obviously, the bitcoin conference is a unique spectacle just for how big it is.
01:01:07.250 - 01:01:20.094, Speaker A: You had a great panel last year that you moderated with Shinobi, Matt Carlo and Eric Wall and Udi Wertheimer, and that sort of ordinals. Tapper wizards debate, which was by far my favorite panel, although I will say the two presidential candidate appearances.
01:01:20.474 - 01:01:26.898, Speaker B: I think as. I think it just as someone who tried to architect it, it just immediately went on the rails and then it was just like watching a car sort of tumble down the hill.
01:01:26.946 - 01:01:29.330, Speaker A: But yeah, it was a great spectacle, for sure.
01:01:29.522 - 01:01:49.786, Speaker B: I'm of the belief that, look, bitcoin conferences should just strip down. We just need rooms with white walls where we can all yell at each other. It's a bear market. It's time for us to just have at it. There's no this pretense that there's going to be normal people there. If it was up to me, I would get rid of all that. It's just white padded rooms where there's some boxing gloves, where people can just go at it.
01:01:49.786 - 01:02:11.774, Speaker B: But yeah, look, I think it's good. Bitcoin is recentering. We're having different, more meaningful debates. I think some of those things have to be sussed out a little bit more. We have to do a better job of explaining what's going on. But I think that people who used to be crypto agnostic coming to bitcoin is very positive. I think that hopefully we can channel their creative energy towards doing something useful for bitcoin.
01:02:11.774 - 01:03:07.404, Speaker B: We have to kind of define that for them, I think, in order to be helpful, that's what I say, that people who have been here, it's like we have to also channel this energy that's coming in, because it isn't really going to be that. The dumb idea that you had for Ethereum is going to work suddenly because it's on bitcoin. It might still be a very dumb idea, and there might be new reasons why it's a dumb idea, but you're going to have to deal with these people who are coming, I think, and then educate them up. Okay, what are we trying to work on in bitcoin? What is valuable to us? Where do we need, as you're talking with the roll ups, where do we need attention? Where can you be valuable? And I do think there is a risk there. There could be more tension around that conference, and it could be a time where people do feel like the network is being overwhelmed with things that aren't super valuable. But again, bitcoin is a permissionless technology. And I think I go back to ordinals and Casey, what was his greatest contribution? He didn't ask for permission.
01:03:07.404 - 01:03:45.912, Speaker B: He just set this thing off, whatever it is. Best case scenario, he brings the NFT markets to bitcoin. They're a long term value add for the chain, and all other NFT markets are destroyed. Worst case scenario, he is a disgraced formal protocol guy who brought years of shitcoining to bitcoin and then has to go live in a monastery somewhere just away from the world. But look, look, we need people who are willing to go that far. This is, again, what I've always loved about Casey and his proposal is just a work of human creativity. Ordinals really is going for something.
01:03:45.912 - 01:03:58.696, Speaker B: It has a lot at stake. I'm looking forward to seeing how it play out. And we hope he joins us in bitcoin 2024. I think he's been too quiet on the stage, to be honest. I think it's going to be really exciting.
01:03:58.880 - 01:04:10.558, Speaker A: It's going to be right in between the two presidential national nominating conventions for the two major parties as well. Well, so it's going to be exciting and I'm looking forward to it. I love Nashville. I went to college in Nashville. I went to Vanderbilt, so I always did.
01:04:10.566 - 01:04:22.038, Speaker B: You really? Yeah. Nashville is one city. I mean, look, if people haven't been a lot of character, you can go to the Johnny Cash Museum, you know, obviously tons of live country music. I think, look what? The Bitcoin conference, it's like we got.
01:04:22.046 - 01:04:30.078, Speaker A: To overwhelm Broadway, dude. It's pretty big. But I mean, if we have 20 or 30,000 bitcoiners going out every night and it's going to be a scene.
01:04:30.206 - 01:04:54.006, Speaker B: Well, I think, like part of this is like, you know, bringing the bitcoin conference on the road, seeing more cities, getting more cities involved. I mean, we really did see how, you know, Miami did become involved in the bitcoin sector, right. Meaningfully with swap things, you know? So I do think, you know, it's good to get the conference out there. You know, we did the conference in Europe this year. We're looking at Asia, we're looking at the Middle east. You know, this is part of going forth and orange, building the world, you know?
