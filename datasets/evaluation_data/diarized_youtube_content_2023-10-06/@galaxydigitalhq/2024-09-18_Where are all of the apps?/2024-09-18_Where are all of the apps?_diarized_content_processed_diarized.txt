00:00:00.360 - 00:00:47.115, Speaker A: And the other thing we think about is where are all the apps? Like, where have we seen the app ecosystem explode in the past two decades? You gotta look at your phone, right? That's where all apps are on your phone. And what does building apps on your iPhone mean? It's like a super seamless, really approachable experience in languages that have no limitations. Like EVM at the end of the day, is quite limited in a really end to end platform where developers can just write their logic and everything else is handled. So that's kind of like the thesis we're going on when it comes to building apps. And that's also why we've been focusing a lot on this co processor idea, right? Writing your apps in rust. We do think that is a big change in how developers can approach this.
