00:00:07.280 - 00:00:11.102, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, BImnet, great to see you.
00:00:11.158 - 00:00:12.278, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:12.446 - 00:00:21.702, Speaker A: So we have what's going on in the market. We got some interesting stuff. Today's Wednesday, July 12. We had the CPI numbers. What happened? What do they look like?
00:00:21.798 - 00:00:47.054, Speaker B: Yeah, so we had a pretty soft inflation print. It was lower than expected. Core month on month printed a 0.2 versus expectations of a 0.3. And the unrounded was low as well. The key components that were dragging on these inflation figures relative to expectations at least, were things like airline prices and used autos.
00:00:48.154 - 00:00:57.494, Speaker A: Airline prices are down. It looked like a lot like double digit percent. I don't know if I'm seeing that on the ground.
00:00:58.544 - 00:01:53.194, Speaker B: There's a healthy amount of disillusionment over a lot of the government data that's published, for example, the owner's equivalent rent stuff. And just the housing figures in the CPI data. Folks are like, yeah, we were already expecting that to come down because we know it's a lagging indicator. And so how much weight do you put on it knowing that it's lagged? And people were already expecting it to come down. But I think the most important takeaways from this report is that inflation is headed in the right direction and that you are seeing drops in prices in areas of the economy that are sensitive to interest rates. But outside of that, it's a little bit trickier. In addition, I think a couple of things that are notable are you're going to start to lose some of the base effects that you had earlier this year.
00:01:53.194 - 00:02:15.378, Speaker B: You're not going to be losing like really high prints from a year ago as you add, like numbers going forward. I think that's very notable. I also do think that housing is actually starting to rebound a bit and that you might eventually start seeing rents ticking up a bit and high level, like, rents are still going up like six, seven, 8% a year. That's a lot that is not sustainable.
00:02:15.466 - 00:02:15.938, Speaker A: That's crazy.
00:02:15.986 - 00:02:53.918, Speaker B: And the Fed is actively trying to tackle that and that has not gone away. And, you know, just if you think about parts of the economy, the service sector of the economy is still really hot. So all in all, this is a soft inflation number. But one, I don't think it's going to deter the Fed from hiking in July 2. There are aspects of the economy that are starting to show signs of reinflating, and that is going to be a constant fear for the Fed and market participants. Anyway, besides this sort of one soft reading. I think the price action afterwards was pretty notable.
00:02:53.918 - 00:03:06.622, Speaker B: You had a pretty dramatic rally in fixed income. The belly of the US curve rallied 15, 1617 basis points. That was pretty dramatic. And the dollar index is off over a percent today.
00:03:06.678 - 00:03:10.514, Speaker A: So it's down. The dollar was coming down, coming down pretty hard.
00:03:10.934 - 00:03:42.246, Speaker B: One, that's a function of renewed speculation that the BOJ is going to increase the ban, that they allowed the ten year to trade in by another 50 basis points. So BOJ getting hawkish fears and then two, it's like us rates went down a lot and this could be the end of the Fed hiking cycle. And some folks are saying the hike in July could be the last one because we have disinflation. And it's not a bad thing to have inflation coming down and people still having jobs. That's an okay scenario.
00:03:42.270 - 00:03:43.814, Speaker A: If the labor market looks great right now.
00:03:43.894 - 00:03:48.622, Speaker B: If the labor market looks great and prices come down, then it's pretty much awesome.
00:03:48.678 - 00:03:48.942, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:48.998 - 00:03:50.254, Speaker B: However, that's just not likely.
00:03:50.334 - 00:03:51.270, Speaker A: I know, I hear you.
00:03:51.382 - 00:03:53.734, Speaker B: It's just like people. People get ahead of themselves.
00:03:53.774 - 00:04:03.966, Speaker A: I just like this. You've been talking. You used the word inflation and then you correctly and interestingly, I want to point out, use the word disinflation to describe the growth in inflation coming down.
00:04:04.110 - 00:04:05.166, Speaker B: The deceleration.
00:04:05.310 - 00:04:15.270, Speaker A: It's pricing disinflation. It's not negative inflation. It's still the presence of inflation. This is the thing that I just like. I know people know this, but, like, some people don't really get this.
00:04:15.302 - 00:04:17.406, Speaker B: When we see inflation rate of price.
00:04:17.470 - 00:04:35.278, Speaker A: Change, price increase is still increasing. It's increasing more slowly on a compounded annualized basis. We need to actually get to like two or 3%. Don't we need to have like negative months? Months where inflation is negative in theory.
00:04:35.326 - 00:04:36.750, Speaker B: To get to the two? That's what I'm saying.
00:04:36.782 - 00:04:37.646, Speaker A: To get to the two.
00:04:37.710 - 00:04:38.006, Speaker B: Yes.
00:04:38.070 - 00:04:44.570, Speaker A: So I guess it's good that we're like 0.2 and not 0.3. That's getting pretty close to zero, I guess, on a month over month.
00:04:44.682 - 00:04:56.546, Speaker B: Yeah. But it depends on how you slice it and dice it, too. Okay. Electronic prices are down a lot this year. I was on Best Buy. I think I saw a 42 inch tv that was $150.
00:04:56.610 - 00:04:57.354, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:04:57.434 - 00:04:59.282, Speaker B: I got really upset. That stuff is down.
00:04:59.378 - 00:05:07.822, Speaker A: The 55 inch Samsung I bought like five years ago, which is still a good tv. It's half the price that it was then. Half.
00:05:07.958 - 00:05:10.902, Speaker B: Right. But it's like, people already have tvs. Do they need them no, I know.
00:05:10.918 - 00:05:12.834, Speaker A: And they also last a long time too.
00:05:13.454 - 00:05:21.670, Speaker B: The other thing to think about is you do have student loan payments starting up again, at least the federal student loan payments. And that's a pretty sizable.
00:05:21.782 - 00:05:23.914, Speaker A: Is that September or October?
00:05:24.294 - 00:05:37.030, Speaker B: I think it's either August or September or October. It's within. I actually think it's September. Yeah. But I think the average us price is about $550 worth of, of monthly payments to make.
00:05:37.062 - 00:05:40.038, Speaker A: So that's income that is currently discretionary. Gonna become.
00:05:40.086 - 00:06:21.976, Speaker B: Yeah, it will go straight from like income to the loans or will come from excess savings. And that should be a drag. But again, if you look at what's been happening, corporates raise prices as long as people keep paying it. People keep paying it. Cause they still have jobs and people still spend because they have credit cards and they have room to run and they don't want to change their lifestyles and stuff. And so there is a cycle where this stuff continues and persists. And a warning sign was last week when you had ADP report 400 plus thousand job gains.
00:06:21.976 - 00:06:42.426, Speaker B: Although the actual BLS report on Friday reported less. They did show a pretty material increase in average hourly earnings. And you're still running like 4% plus in average hourly earnings. Like inflation. Right. And so, like, the labor market's hot. People have pricing power in the labor market.
00:06:42.426 - 00:06:55.914, Speaker B: And so it's really tough to see a scenario where this stuff really cools off. Hence why, like, I think today's probably an overreaction, if anything. I mean, stocks going up to the dead highs of the year.
00:06:55.994 - 00:06:57.066, Speaker A: Is that where we went this year?
00:06:57.090 - 00:07:05.684, Speaker B: We went up to 45 20 in S and P. Wow. Yeah. And Nasdaq also hit high.
00:07:06.304 - 00:07:15.512, Speaker A: The market, in your opinion, was taking it as taking an overly bullish view because it's like, yeah, okay. It came in under expectation, but it's still sticky.
00:07:15.688 - 00:07:39.274, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, I think the most important thing is that the threat of reinflation is very real and the Fed is hyper aware of that risk. And they are going to stay higher for longer because that's what the economy necessitates. And you just look around the world like bank of England, they thought they had it in, and then it's like, oh, no, inflation's back. Right?
00:07:39.774 - 00:07:41.822, Speaker A: RBA and BoC, they quiet stopped and.
00:07:41.838 - 00:07:42.518, Speaker B: Then they kept going.
00:07:42.566 - 00:08:27.268, Speaker A: I know, we really need to, like, you got to quietly, like, stuff this monster back under the bed, right. You don't want them reappearing. We're all calm. That's got to be a really traumatic. Okay, real quick, too. I mean, bitcoin looks like it's been mostly pinned, you see, around like the mid 30 thousands we've been chopping around for like, I think maybe three weeks at this point, basically between like 30 and 31 with a couple little dips and pops. But what do you think? I mean, what's your view on just your directionally on bitcoin at this exact moment, given we've got what, gox repayments in the fall, there was just some Silk road bitcoins were moving, I guess, to be twap sold by the DOJ probably.
00:08:27.268 - 00:08:31.324, Speaker A: Currently. I don't know what else. Like, what's your stance on this?
00:08:31.404 - 00:09:14.826, Speaker B: My stance is I do think that there's a healthy amount of long positioning that is in bitcoin, and that's why the rallies have been less than spectacular over the past couple of weeks, because it trades like a crowded position. Folks have this on whether it's in spot option form, whether it's in crypto related equities or whatever it may be. Basically, since the bitcoin etcetera came out, crypto assets have done well and it's already up like almost 90% on year. So it's a really crowded trade that's done really well. That's at the dead highs. And in terms of the next positive catalyst, when are we going to get more ETF news?
00:09:14.890 - 00:09:17.298, Speaker A: Probably in weeks.
00:09:17.426 - 00:09:28.654, Speaker B: Weeks at least. And so there's an absence of catalysts. And then we got a negative catalyst today that we weren't expecting the Silk Road government tokens being sold.
00:09:29.794 - 00:09:41.242, Speaker A: We know, and this is like they announced in March they had about 50,000 coins to sell and they said they'd be doing it in tranches over the next year, which they've basically been doing 10,000 a quarter, it looks like.
00:09:41.378 - 00:09:43.234, Speaker B: So here's their next tranche here.
00:09:43.274 - 00:09:44.306, Speaker A: But that didn't really.
00:09:44.490 - 00:10:13.570, Speaker B: It hasn't. It's a long day, and bitcoin has moved down, you know, probably 400 points on this stuff, you know, so it's tough. It's tricky. I do think that, like, the ultimate direction is higher. I've never been, you know, I'm very confident that this stuff is going to trend higher through year end. But right here, right now, fuels a little crowded. You're at resistance and it's at year eight highs.
00:10:13.570 - 00:10:49.596, Speaker B: So I think what you're supposed to do is just make sure your positions are measured. In addition, take advantages of dips involved to maybe put on some upside structures. I also do think that the downside in bitcoin is certainly limited now with this looming ETF news. I think the bottom on crazy risk off headlines is at least north of 25k for me now. And so it definitely feels like a market that's trending. And long story short, trend's your friend. Buy on dibs, sell on rallies.
00:10:49.740 - 00:10:53.804, Speaker A: There you go. Bibnet Abibi, our friend from Galaxy Digital trading.
00:10:53.844 - 00:10:54.844, Speaker B: Thank you so much, Faizer.
