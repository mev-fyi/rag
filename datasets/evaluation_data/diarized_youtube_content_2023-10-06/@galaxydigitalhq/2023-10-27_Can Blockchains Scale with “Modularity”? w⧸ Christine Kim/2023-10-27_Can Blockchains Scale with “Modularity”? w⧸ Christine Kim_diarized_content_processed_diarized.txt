As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital. Thank you for listening to galaxy brains. We have a great show for you today. Christine Kim from Galaxy Research. She's going to join us to talk about the modularity thesis to scaling blockchains and what it means for the world of blockchain.
00:01:05.334 - 00:01:31.220, Speaker A: She has a great report out and we'll get into it with her. We'll also check in with our good friend Bim Netabeebee from Galaxy trading, as always, to talk about markets and macro. And before we get to all of that, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to the disclaimer in the podcast notes. And note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Phineas Sam Bankman Fried is supposedly going to testify in his own defense at the trial. What do we think about this?
00:01:31.342 - 00:01:35.768, Speaker B: Another week? More Sam Bankman Freed news we can't get enough. What are your thoughts?
00:01:35.816 - 00:01:47.576, Speaker A: I mean, can he possibly get away with not testifying from what we were, you know, I mean, look, we're just observers, but it looks pretty bad for him. Feels like he's got to throw a grenade in there and try to change the narrative.
00:01:47.640 - 00:01:50.560, Speaker B: Well, typically it is a big no no.
00:01:50.632 - 00:01:53.760, Speaker A: Yeah, very bad idea. Usually because it's. Well, you could blow the whole case.
00:01:53.832 - 00:01:54.904, Speaker B: Never know what's going to happen.
00:01:54.984 - 00:01:55.416, Speaker C: Right.
00:01:55.520 - 00:01:59.054, Speaker A: But I feel like he's down bad, so, like, you gotta. It's like a Hail Mary.
00:01:59.094 - 00:02:01.038, Speaker B: It's a Hail Mary. Yeah, it's a Hail Mary.
00:02:01.086 - 00:02:06.406, Speaker A: Yeah. And big bitcoin market moves this week as people really anticipate the ETF. It's been wild.
00:02:06.470 - 00:02:24.470, Speaker B: There is, it seems like we have to give you your flowers a little bit here. I don't want to, you know, blow up your spot too much, but I saw your tweet on Sunday and then the market moved Monday pretty in line with your prediction. And you're not a big predictor necessarily. That's not what you're paid to do.
00:02:24.502 - 00:03:10.520, Speaker A: But, yeah, we don't spend, spend too much time dealing it and talking about short term price predictions. But the options market was flashing these signals that we wrote about and I tweeted about on Sunday and, yeah, I mean, it played out basically as expected. That's the gamma squeeze. Right. Which was the dealers on a net basis were very short gamma and short upside. And so as price bled higher on anticipation of the ETF on Sunday and Monday, it started to take out these levels where people had to buy spot bitcoin, dealers had to buy back a lot of spot bitcoin to stay Delta neutral, which really is what, what, like, caused explosiveness. And I should point out, I mean, this is something we've been talking about, right? Two weeks ago, we had Kelly Greer from Galaxy trading on the podcast to talk specifically about the dealer positioning in the options market.
00:03:10.520 - 00:03:23.816, Speaker A: And that podcast was titled Options market suggests big move. Could bitcoin, options market suggests big move ahead. Right. So we've been talking about, it did play out. I mean, and now we see, I mean, you can see over my shoulder with the block clock. Right. I mean, we're doing great here.
00:03:23.816 - 00:03:26.108, Speaker A: I mean, we're, bitcoin's up over 110%.
00:03:26.156 - 00:03:31.940, Speaker B: Year to date, and now we have Bim net back on the show today to talk about markets again and follow up.
00:03:31.972 - 00:03:33.604, Speaker A: And I think we continue to hammer this home.
00:03:33.684 - 00:03:42.476, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's a market that moves all the time, and it's cool to have people that are paying such close attention to it on the week, on the show every week.
00:03:42.540 - 00:04:03.076, Speaker A: So we'll follow up next week. I don't know when Sam's going to testify, and I don't know for certain, but I saw a headline that he will testify, cannot, that will be among the most watched court appearances, I think, in recent memory. And we'll tell you what happened once it does. But for now, let's get right into the show. Let's go now to our friend Bim net Abibi from galaxy trading. As always, Bemnet, thanks for coming on.
00:04:03.100 - 00:04:04.676, Speaker C: Galaxy brains thanks for having me.
00:04:04.740 - 00:04:22.668, Speaker A: What a week. I mean, we're seeing material movement in bitcoin. You can see over our shoulder. My shoulder. The right now, as we record on Wednesday, it's 37. $34,700 ish is the closer to 800, but who's counting? Yeah, I mean, it's. And we had a material, I mean, huge move earlier in the week.
00:04:22.668 - 00:04:25.664, Speaker A: What do you make of this apparent renewed optimism?
00:04:26.304 - 00:05:06.360, Speaker C: I think it's entirely warranted heading into a catalyst that is highly probable. It was driven by a number of things, but one of the main things was a short squeeze, particularly in the option side of things. The street was generally positioned pretty short gamma into this break. In addition, you had a ton of folks shorting bitcoin at the yearly highs, and a ton of Oi ended up getting wiped out on the perps. And folks saw the technical break, right. 32k was year to date highs. We broke through it pretty easily.
00:05:06.360 - 00:05:56.748, Speaker C: The 200 day moving average that was previously resistance held as support. And now, once you were above 32k, you were above every relevant moving average and technical average you could think of. And so you had a technical breakthrough, a short gamma squeeze, a short positioning squeeze as well. On top of that, the folks that got absolutely blasted and all of those factors coming together. And now the question is, can we continue? And my opinion is an unequivocal yes. I think very few folks anecdotally have caught this move, especially in the traditional community. It's a rally that is under owned, under position.
00:05:56.748 - 00:06:02.596, Speaker C: And so I think every hundred points higher is a lot more painful than every 100 points lower.
00:06:02.660 - 00:06:06.820, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, this is a 20% move from the range we were in just last week.
00:06:06.852 - 00:06:12.060, Speaker C: But when you have Larry Fink coming on television and telling you he thinks about it as a safe haven.
00:06:12.132 - 00:06:13.476, Speaker A: Right. A flight to quality.
00:06:13.580 - 00:06:50.024, Speaker C: A flight to quality, like the world has changed. The beauty about an institution like Blackrock or these tradfi institutions is that they institutionalize an asset by definition. By definition, credence. And so it's not that bitcoin wasn't institutional before, but when Larry Fink puts the blackrock stamp on it, it's different. And it is different this time. And so what have we known always to be true? The liquidity available versus the potential demand. But the potential demand, there's a huge imbalance.
00:06:50.024 - 00:07:26.648, Speaker C: And I think we're just getting a taste of that. This could be, again, another Minsky moment for markets where all of a sudden people realize, oh, wait, we have this new asset. It has a role in investment portfolios and we can't ignore it now because every other institution is looking at it. Here's the beauty about this, is that it becomes so self fulfilling. There's such a positive feedback loop to positive price action at the moment. Every percent higher, it becomes, oh, one of the better asset classes performance this year. It gets better on, on a risk adjusted basis.
00:07:26.648 - 00:07:52.564, Speaker C: The story, the thesis gets more credence. And so you have this convexity of opinion that isn't price based, but it's thought based. And so that's where you are in the market. And that's what these technical breaks are telling you, that when you're above a 200 week moving average or day moving average, it tells you there's a change in the trend. And we know why.
00:07:52.684 - 00:07:53.012, Speaker A: Right.
00:07:53.068 - 00:07:57.404, Speaker C: And so how do you trade things? You buy things going into a known catalyst.
00:07:57.444 - 00:07:57.684, Speaker A: Yep.
00:07:57.724 - 00:08:02.012, Speaker C: Yeah. And that is what tradfi is, I believe, going to do.
00:08:02.068 - 00:08:25.034, Speaker A: Yeah. And we've seen continued strength. It wasn't just the gamma squeeze or the technicals either, right to your point. It's this catalyst that people are really waking up to. Even, you know, we had a pullback after Monday's incredible rally, a minor one, and we're already back right where we were. Right, absolutely. And it wasn't a bit, I mean, I think I saw it go as low as 33 at some point on Tuesday.
00:08:25.034 - 00:08:27.862, Speaker A: Still obviously way above where it was. Yeah.
00:08:27.878 - 00:08:30.830, Speaker C: I mean, after it broke 32, the low was like 32 seven.
00:08:30.902 - 00:08:44.080, Speaker A: Yeah, like you can. Exactly, like you can see. And if you just watch price action marching up like. So, there's clearly a lot of demand out there. To your point on returns, I mean, I think at this level, bitcoin's up 110% this year.
00:08:44.112 - 00:08:45.832, Speaker C: Total return math every moment.
00:08:45.888 - 00:09:15.822, Speaker A: I know. So, I mean, it is basically the best performing asset of the year. I'm not going to mention that I did find two equities in the US, which we won't talk about, but that are slightly better. But those are individual companies. This is a giant global asset. Now, we should say, I guess in your mind, what could harm even leading into ETF approval over the next couple of months? What could make us bearish on bitcoin or what could impact it negatively in your mind?
00:09:16.008 - 00:09:52.876, Speaker C: Well, I think a broader risk off move in markets, if ten start taking out 5% and the curve starts steepening like crazy again, I think you'll see a continuation of the risk off move that you've seen in the Nasdaq and the S and P and everybody being like, oh, inflation's still a huge issue. QT is leading to bonds that have no bid and stuff. So you could go down that spiral of thinking, for sure. In addition, you could have things like gold trade down because all of a sudden there's peace and Israel or ceasefire.
00:09:52.940 - 00:10:02.348, Speaker A: Or situation, or even the reverse. Like, even if, I was gonna say, if we have increased geopolitical conflict and the world doesn't yet treat bitcoin as a flight to quality.
00:10:02.436 - 00:10:11.764, Speaker C: Yeah. Right now it's got a weird hybrid, but ultimately everybody is thinking that there is gonna be a God candle when an ETF is approved.
00:10:11.804 - 00:10:13.204, Speaker A: Right. So it's about positioning ahead of that.
00:10:13.244 - 00:10:23.892, Speaker C: Positioning ahead of that. And so folks are trying to pick their levels by dips. But basically you might have only between now and the ETF might be your.
00:10:23.908 - 00:10:25.274, Speaker A: Last within a month and a half.
00:10:25.644 - 00:10:28.612, Speaker C: Yeah. To get it before that, said Candle. Potentially.
00:10:28.668 - 00:10:29.300, Speaker A: Potentially. Right.
00:10:29.332 - 00:10:29.964, Speaker C: I agree.
00:10:30.124 - 00:11:03.332, Speaker A: And we think we put out a report, Chuck, Charles Yu on my team put out a report yesterday, on Tuesday estimating, really, I think, a very defensible and conservative estimate on the potential inflows to generic ETF's and its impact on price. And I mean, I think we think it could be big. Go check out the reports on our website. But without getting into it. So I think there is plenty of reason to believe. I believe that there will be significant interest in the ETF. I think some people, it's interesting, the responses to that report were either you're overestimating or underestimating.
00:11:03.332 - 00:11:27.102, Speaker A: People either think, well, why would you buy it? You could already buy it on Coinbase or wherever else. Why would you need the ETF? Or there's these other products already in the market. And it's like, well, the channel that has $47 trillion doesn't have access to those products. And so that's why we think it could be big. On the other hand, people are like, oh, it's too small. I think we said 15 billion in inflows in year one and 38 and year three. And people are like, it's going to be up 100 billion.
00:11:27.102 - 00:11:34.542, Speaker A: Right. And there's really no way to know. We're just triangulating. But in any case, we see significant interest, I think, in demand. And obviously the market's anticipating it.
00:11:34.638 - 00:12:13.058, Speaker C: Yeah, no, the long run, how much inflows it gets or not, it's going to be tough to ballpark. But again, we go back to the main points. We know that the american capital markets the best capital market ever in history. ETF's easy product ever to trade on them to trade. So I'm convinced that we have the recipe for a pretty aggressive price movement. Whether it's short term or long term, I think it doesn't matter. But for the big picture, like, is it too early to declare victory? Probably.
00:12:13.058 - 00:12:24.538, Speaker C: I wanna do like a George Bush zero four, like, in front of mission accomplished, mission accomplished moment, but without getting the approval. But if you do get it, it's just monumental.
00:12:24.666 - 00:12:28.634, Speaker A: You were, I wanna point out, you were. I think you literally raised the bit signal.
00:12:28.674 - 00:12:28.930, Speaker C: I did.
00:12:28.962 - 00:12:34.530, Speaker A: Two weeks ago, this week's podcast. Two weeks ago. Yeah, I mean, I said, I'm saying it here. I'm raising the bit signal. Yeah.
00:12:34.602 - 00:12:35.906, Speaker C: You know, I just got to.
00:12:35.970 - 00:12:37.114, Speaker A: You got the spidey sense.
00:12:37.234 - 00:12:54.320, Speaker C: I had the spidey sense on the corn bitcoin. But it's also just the general level of frustration with central bankers and monetary policy. You consistently see these central bankers being asked about the fiscal situation.
00:12:54.432 - 00:12:55.448, Speaker A: They refuse to speak on it.
00:12:55.456 - 00:13:14.114, Speaker C: Right. Well, they speak on it in a way that avoids the main question. They're like, well, our job is to respond to fiscal policy. Right. Is what they say, because that's, that's not their mandate. But ultimately, we're in a situation where we run $1.7 trillion in deficit.
00:13:14.114 - 00:13:18.906, Speaker C: We have congressional leaders that are bifurcated. They can't, they actually can't form a.
00:13:18.930 - 00:13:20.562, Speaker A: Government at the moment effectively.
00:13:20.658 - 00:14:00.666, Speaker C: And you're paying a level of interest that's right now just insane. It's similar to spending on defense or 15% of the budget on interest. And it's only compounding over time. This country is addicted to spending money it doesn't have. And there's no politicians that are like, well, there are a few, but it doesn't look like a situation that's gonna be addressed politically. And therefore, these central bankers need to properly talk about that and address that and that reality, but they choose not to. And in the face of just mounting and surging treasury supply, and they're not even buying it.
00:14:00.666 - 00:14:12.066, Speaker C: And so it's like, do you acknowledge that you gotta buy all this paper and do MMT forever and yield curve control? No, because that tells people that you have no control over the fiscal. And like that should, in theory, debase your currency.
00:14:12.130 - 00:14:20.818, Speaker A: Even Jamie Dimon, I think yesterday had a big quote about this, about how if you look at the recent history of the Fed, you should really not trust what they're saying about the future.
00:14:20.906 - 00:14:21.746, Speaker C: No, absolutely not.
00:14:21.770 - 00:14:22.506, Speaker A: Because they did such a bad thing.
00:14:22.530 - 00:14:48.944, Speaker C: Forecasting is so bad. I mean, it's just been so politically inacceptable to criticize the Fed, but Jamie Dimon can do it now because one, he's the biggest bank and he saved them on whatever that bank that they bought was, but they need him now because all the regional banks are in shit. And the only reason that we didn't have a huge banking crisis is because we spun up some random facility to give banks loans which was effectively favorable.
00:14:48.984 - 00:14:50.592, Speaker A: Fake money, right? I mean, or free money.
00:14:50.688 - 00:14:52.376, Speaker C: Well, it's just expanding your balance sheet.
00:14:52.400 - 00:14:53.056, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:14:53.200 - 00:14:55.992, Speaker C: It's literally like doing more qe from.
00:14:56.008 - 00:14:58.512, Speaker A: A tax perspective, just for banks, just.
00:14:58.528 - 00:15:39.926, Speaker C: At these great terms where you can borrow at par on something that's worth effectively marked down. Right. And so, you know, it's just like every solution that we have to monetary policy and market incidents is print more money, lend more money, lend more dollars in swap lines, I will give you financing versus. And so if the entire premise of our monetary system is built on the ability to print more money, that's not a foundation that makes me comfortable. And it becomes ever present, like when central bankers keep getting asked about it and they can't acknowledge the simple facts that, like, their monetary policy is going to be entirely driven by, by fiscal and fiscal dominance. And so anyway, I could rant.
00:15:39.950 - 00:15:45.950, Speaker A: That is our man. Bimnetabibe. I love it. I love the rant. Bimnetabibbee from galaxy trading. Thank you so much, as always.
00:15:46.102 - 00:15:46.914, Speaker C: Pleasure.
00:15:48.374 - 00:15:52.230, Speaker A: Welcome Christine Kim from Galaxy Research, my friend. Welcome back to Galaxy Brains.
00:15:52.302 - 00:15:53.926, Speaker D: Thanks for having me, Alex, always great.
00:15:53.950 - 00:16:23.874, Speaker A: To have you on. And you know, I wanted to have you on, as I often do. But in particular this reason because you just published a great report about modularity, I think you said. Was it called scaling blockchains? The modularity thesis. This is so hot right now. Modularity, right. And I want to talk about the report because I would say it's a pretty important report from our team and in some ways is a follow up to the ready layer one report that we published in November 2021.
00:16:23.874 - 00:17:01.716, Speaker A: That report, I'm gonna set the stage a little bit and then I'm gonna ask you, what is modularity? But that report in 21 sort of elucidated our thesis at the time, that outside of bitcoin, there was this battle among general computation blockchains. And we effectively argued that it was Ethereum's game to lose. So that report we talked about, Ethereum and ten competitors, it really looks today like most of those competitors aren't very competitive to ethereum and that maybe ethereum is now winning and modularity plays a big role in that. And that's, I think, why these two reports are very nice to go together. Tell us, though, what is modularity? What is it?
00:17:01.900 - 00:18:14.854, Speaker D: Well, I think modularity is a little bit of the big buzzword in crypto. It represents kind of like a real shift in thinking of how we scale blockchains. If we think about how blockchains tried to scale, or how many blockchain developers tried to think about scaling blockchains. Before the modularity thesis, before modularity even became a term, we were thinking about layered scaling approaches where on bitcoin, if you think about it, how do we get funding faster transactions? Let's get a protocol built on top of bitcoin that settles to bitcoin, but doesn't actually execute every single transaction on bitcoin. And so that, I think, was really how the modularity thesis continued to develop out from. The difference, though, with the modularity thesis is that with layered scaling approaches, you have these solutions on top of a blockchain that still allows the execution of transactions. It still allows all of the core functions of a blockchain, which is transaction, execution, settlement of transactions, consensus, and a blockchain trying to fulfill all of those functions will inherently be bogged down with just too many responsibilities.
00:18:14.854 - 00:19:00.450, Speaker D: Over time, you're going to find that the computational resources that your nodes need in order to support even all those layers will continue to increase and grow and become more centralized over time. So the modularity thesis is, why don't we cut out these various functions from the core, from the, from the very, from the very protocol layer, from the very base layer. Let's just create a blockchain that only is able to do, say like two out of four core functions, consensus and data availability, which is the model that celestia is going for and is really the main focus of the modularity reports, the celestia blockchain, and is actually the approach that I think Ethereum developers are trying to trend towards as well.
00:19:00.562 - 00:19:09.294, Speaker A: Yeah, so this would be the new long term plan, although to the extent there is one, certainly the direction of scaling Ethereum.
00:19:09.794 - 00:20:03.152, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, that is what one part of Ethereum developers are thinking about. But the other part of Ethereum developers, which is really interesting from the last couple call notes that I have out from the developer calls, is that for the next upgrade after Cancun Deneb, there's a big push for upgrading the EVM. The EVM is an execution engine, and there's an upgrade called the EOF upgrade, which is the Ethereum object format. And it basically helps the EVM distinguish between transactions that are trying to execute smart contract code versus storing data about smart contracts and the applications that are on top of Ethereum, there is this push to make Ethereum a better protocol layer for executing transactions. But there's another like we were just.
00:20:03.168 - 00:20:21.664, Speaker A: Talking about kind of plays into the modularity thesis too, though, right? Is that we think, or I guess, do you think in the end, and I want to distract too much here, but like, is execution going to be happening on Ethereum or will it be happening elsewhere, you think like on a modular layer or like, how does that play out? I mean, obviously plenty of execution will still happen on Ethereum, so it matters.
00:20:21.704 - 00:21:11.680, Speaker D: But in the short term, right now, all of the execution is happening on Ethereum. Only about what, 10% of gas consumption is from L2 s. But with the subsidization of L2 roll ups with proto dank sharding upgrade, which will make roll ups a heck of a lot cheaper on Ethereum, I think there's these upgrades that are trying to push user activity to L2s, but at the same time you've got developers talking about EOF upgrades, which are upgrades that are going to try and make transaction execution easier and more efficient. On Ethereum. That kind of seems competing between these two. And I think it really reflects the fact that, look, the L2 ecosystem is not fully mature. And so for Ethereum to be kind of putting all of their eggs in one basket, so to speak, it's a little bit too nascent for that.
00:21:11.680 - 00:21:33.402, Speaker D: And I actually think it's a smart idea to continue to develop Ethereum's execution layer and not bet all in on L2s just yet. See how the modularity blockchain thesis pans out. And if it really is that is the way that blockchains scale, then continue to move forward with things like folding sharding, right.
00:21:33.418 - 00:21:53.634, Speaker A: It's tough to support that thesis rather than perhaps like upgrading the l one's capabilities on a standalone basis for stuff that if it works, if it looks like it's working, then you expect the development will really move much more to supporting whatever these modular layers need. More than say, upgrading the EVM.
00:21:54.014 - 00:22:59.910, Speaker D: Yeah, I think so. And I think Ethereum right now is kind of like has its foot in one bucket and the other. It's in this awkward phase where Ethereum is not fully like Celestia going all in on the blockchain modularity thesis, but it's also not fully on the monolithic side where it's like, you know what? We're just going to double down on making sure that we are both a really performant execution layer and data availability layer and all of the other core functions of a blockchain. And I think this really comes down to competition when we're thinking about the ready layer. One thesis of is it Ethereum's game to lose? I think Ethereum is really kind of weighing what new competitors are coming up, and I think Celestia is an example of a different competitor to all of its other alt layer one competitors, because it is uniquely designed to be highly optimized as a DA layer only and highly optimized for supporting rollups, whereas Ethereum is not fully quite there yet.
00:23:00.022 - 00:23:12.274, Speaker A: Interesting. Let's talk about Celestia a little bit more, because I want to understand this, how it works. When you talk about data availability, what data are we talking about? Is it the transaction history data, basically, or transaction data?
00:23:12.624 - 00:23:35.720, Speaker D: Yeah. So every time a user sends a transaction, I want to send a certain amount of this token to you. You can execute that individually on the base layer of a blockchain. But there is quite a lot of scalability gains from compressing these transactions down and bundling them together and just sending them through.
00:23:35.832 - 00:24:29.174, Speaker A: This is what roll ups and stuff do anyway. But when we talk about the but, like an arbitrum or optimism roll up today or an optimistic roll up or whatever, the ones we have today, they're doing execution there, right? They're ordering the transactions, right, which is what the sequencer does or whatever, but then they're rolling them up. And I don't know what exact cryptography we're using now, but it's like, think of it like a Merkle tree, right? Like it's a hash of hashes and type of stuff, and it's all in there, and then they're posting that to the l one, right? But, like, where is the data? What does the data availability mean when, like, what is the data that we're talking about? Is it the hashes of the. Is it the transaction data specifically? Like, when we move? Like, what is Celestia gonna have on it? Right? If it's only data availability, like, will Ethereum, or, like, other roll ups, will they, like, look at the data on Celestia and, like, refer to it? Like, how does, how does that, have we even seen yet how it's gonna come together?
00:24:29.894 - 00:25:34.748, Speaker D: I think there's still a lot of questions about how it's going to all come together with Celestia. I think it's really about trying to generate the proofs, trying to be able to prove that this data was on chain at some point, that the user transactions did exist, that they were committed down. One of the core differences, though, between what celestia is doing and what Ethereum rollups do, like arbitrum and optimism, is that celestia doesn't necessarily have to offer anything around settling the order of transactions. So, like for Ethereum, if perchance a user on optimism or arbitrum wants to execute a transaction on optimism or arbitrum, but do so directly by interacting with a smart contract on the Ethereum level, they can, they can interact with a smart contract on Ethereum and have their transaction executed on any of those roll ups. Right. And so that's like a settlement function that the celestia blockchain will not be necessarily supporting. So that's one kind of key difference about what type of data we're talking about.
00:25:34.796 - 00:25:35.212, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:25:35.268 - 00:25:37.540, Speaker D: And what type of data users can actually interact with.
00:25:37.572 - 00:25:48.244, Speaker A: It's going to be really, this is the first. Yeah, sorry. This is the first test case for the thesis. Right? Like this is the first thing that's going to go into production that actually does modularity, quote, unquote. Right?
00:25:48.324 - 00:25:48.724, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:25:48.804 - 00:26:35.666, Speaker A: Do you think about, like, I like how you described at the beginning of how modularity is kind of an evolution of the layered scaling thesis. Because when we say the modularity thesis, when we say it, I don't think other people are really saying it this way. But when we say it, we really do include the lightning network or these other roll ups or side chains. They're all kind of, even if the layer that we're talking about actually does all four of the things, like a sidechain typically does, it's just arbitrary. They could have done three of the four, and that would definitely be what people are calling modularity. But is that how to think about it? Like, it's sort of just, it is layers. It's just instead of building an entirely full protocol on top of another protocol, it may be taking some pieces of a protocol.
00:26:35.770 - 00:26:40.690, Speaker D: Yeah, it's honestly, I think it's a semantics debate. I mean, everyone, even I'm in it.
00:26:40.722 - 00:26:44.770, Speaker A: I want to be in it. I'm telling everyone. Modularity includes layered scaling.
00:26:44.962 - 00:27:40.062, Speaker D: And I think it really depends on how you, how honestly, when you entered into the crypto industry space, you know, because I think when you think about how to scale blockchains, you think about the amount of transactions that are being processed on a single chain, sharding the idea of sharding which came before the modularity thesis is simply, well, why don't we just like split apart all that transaction load and divide it among, you know, several mini blockchains? It's very natural to try and think of like, well, why don't we just push off certain transaction loads to other layers? Which is where I think we get the layered scaling approach and we get things like sharding all these other concepts. And I think modularity is one of those concepts. But modularity specifically, the way I differentiate it from other layered scaling approaches is that from basically the protocol layer up, no single layer is fully monolithic.
00:27:40.158 - 00:28:15.694, Speaker A: So interesting. So like you end up needing, if you're a blockchain analyst or, well, we'll stick with that. If you end up needing to look in a future where this is widely adopted and this is sort of how the Ethereum ecosystem goes, you end up having to refer to a bunch of different places to sort of reconstruct or understand the total use of Ethereum. Right? Like it's not just Ethereum anymore. It already isn't. To your point about rollups using 10% of gas today, you can't just look at Ethereum, you got to look at the roll ups. But paint for me the picture of what future.
00:28:15.694 - 00:28:27.914, Speaker A: Let's just pick five years and we assume, because maybe it'll take that long. Even if the modularity thesis plays out fully, when you open up your wallet, what are you probably connecting to? Not the l one.
00:28:28.074 - 00:29:06.738, Speaker D: No, definitely not. I think all of the layer one protocols, all of the data availability layers become so obfuscated, so you're hidden. It's like back office stuff. Yeah. And I think you start to get a lot of third party intermediaries in between the actual user interface that users are interacting with. It's going to get very complex. So what you'll have is the Celestia data availability layer, super optimized just to receive batches of proofs of batches of transactions from L2 rollups.
00:29:06.738 - 00:29:23.530, Speaker D: You have all these L2 rollups that are highly optimized and just settling user transactions, ordering them, compressing them down with ZK zero knowledge technology. And then maybe you have a layer three on top of L2s.
00:29:23.602 - 00:29:24.090, Speaker A: Wow.
00:29:24.202 - 00:29:42.818, Speaker D: Where instead of having a generalized execution layer, you have specific networks for a particular application so that certain, if an application becomes very highly used, it doesn't overflow and congest the rest of the L2 network.
00:29:42.866 - 00:29:43.722, Speaker A: So interesting.
00:29:43.818 - 00:30:47.980, Speaker D: And then on top of L2s, you have the front end of what users might be interacting with. And so I think the ecosystem starts to get more complex. And in this entire picture, you have to ask yourself, where is the interoperability between all of these layers? Where does the MEV sit? And I think that is really the weakest link that I see in this blockchain modularity thesis. The reason why it might not turn out is because Ethereum's dominance is because it has the most liquidity, it has the most interoperability between applications. And if we fragment that because of the modularity thesis, and there are no solutions to really kind of bring that layered ecosystem together, then I think that's where the modularity thesis fails, and that's where we collapse back into a monolithic chain, and that's where high costs are kind of a necessary byproduct to having security and to deploying your apps.
00:30:48.172 - 00:31:18.234, Speaker A: Really interesting. I feel like that is a huge question, right? Cause that's where it could work technologically, but be bad for the overall ecosystem. They could solve like, yeah, they all connect. Let's say they do all connect in some way, but it's like, can the users, the transactions, the capital actually freely flows? Is it really composable in one space conceptually? And if it's not, for example, the simplest answer to your point about liquidity is defi, right?
00:31:18.274 - 00:31:18.786, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:31:18.890 - 00:31:40.098, Speaker A: Even now. And it'd be interesting, we should look at this. There's some defi on the roll ups and whatnot. There's pools and amms and whatnot. I'm sure they're not as deeply liquid as on the l one. And what would it take for them to be, right, you don't want, in general, like, capital likes liquidity. It flows to liquidity.
00:31:40.098 - 00:32:10.652, Speaker A: Right. That's why the US capital markets, right. It's got great property rights, efficient markets, nice regulations, blah, blah, blah. So it flows here, right. It doesn't want to be in multiple different places. That's super interesting, because I feel like, are the developers sort of really thinking about that? Because I could see this becoming the type of thing where the technologists, they try to solve the technology problem. But actually there's like a usability question and a capital question that maybe some technologists might not fully grasp.
00:32:10.652 - 00:32:13.828, Speaker A: It's sort of like, you can do it, but should you do it?
00:32:13.916 - 00:33:14.104, Speaker D: Right? I think this is actually the biggest question that developers in the celestia ecosystem are trying to solve. They're thinking about unified settlement layers, unified sequencers, unified everything, to try and solve this issue of usability and interoperability between the layers. But I think it's going to take years to really fully solve. So until we get there, I think there is still a very large value to having everything on a monolithic chain. And the question is, will we ever really get there? Will the efficiency and the liquidity of a Defi ecosystem built on top of a monolithic change ever compete with that of what's on a modular chain? And that's really how we need to think and measure. Kind of like the success of Celestia. Look at the DeFi ecosystem built in the celestia ecosystem and see how efficiently, securely that capital moves around.
00:33:14.484 - 00:34:05.910, Speaker A: It's so interesting, too, because this is one of the only other chains that we really think we see use on is Solana. And it takes a drastically different approach, right, which is monolithic first scale with hardware, etcetera. And when I'm having this vision, I think it's from the movie the watchmen or the comic books, but there's the, or the Ethereum developers. You start from a centralized world. They build a decentralized thing, right? And now they're just like exploding it apart and putting it back together and exploding it apart and putting, I don't mean like destructively. I mean like disaggregating all the pieces and saying, where can we optimize? And then now you're talking about unified settlement. It's kind of like, well, wait, can we take the disaggregated pieces and bring them back together? And some, it's like a jigsaw puzzle.
00:34:05.910 - 00:34:51.082, Speaker A: They're constantly like, you know, trying different ways to arrange it. And like, can it be more efficient in this new configuration? Do you have, I'm sure you do and have thought about it, but, like, what about decentralization in this world? You know, like, does modularity, we think, could it make decentralization better? I mean, some of these are going to have their own consensus, right? So it's sort of like they're not relying on Ethereum. Other ones won't have their own consensus, right? So then they rely on Ethereum. Like, how do you, like, is there a risk that as they blow it apart into modules, but then look for ways to make it interlock? Like, do we, how do you think about decentralization in a modular world? Is there any, I mean, this is sort of a loaded question because I know we don't really know yet.
00:34:51.218 - 00:36:31.644, Speaker D: No, it's a really great question. And I think by introducing more layers and settlement schemes in between the protocols, you necessarily lose out on decentralization because you're fragmenting the number of users, the number of security providers across each layer instead of aggregating them to one layer. And I think this idea of layered scaling approaches, when you really think of why it is that we would want to build on top of, say, ethereum rather than Celestia, it's because of decentralization. It's because of the gains of the fact that Ethereum is the most decentralized, general purpose blockchain in the world. But I think you start to obfuscate from all of the benefits of that. If users are paying in fiat and stablecoins and having the roll up kind of like automatically exchange these fiats and stablecoins and tokens on behalf of the users and then pay batch all of these transactions down to Ethereum, as in like the only customers of the Ethereum blockchain are really these roll ups, these centralized companies that are the primary holders of ETH, primary revenue generators of Ethereum. I think you can get to a future where decentralization is where the future starts to look actually very similar to what we have today, as opposed to the decentralized future that we might have thought of when we first considered web3, of every single user operating their own node, every single user being able to send their own transactions directly from the layer one.
00:36:33.184 - 00:36:55.190, Speaker A: And maybe it's clicking for me because I get most of my information about the Ethereum world from you and you've been made. Is this something where Eigen layer comes in and helps the restaking concept, which is for having all these different places where stuff happens and they all have their own security. Well, can't, isn't that part of the Eigen layer thesis is like, well, maybe we can make it easier for all those other places to use Ethereum security. Is that kind of the idea?
00:36:55.302 - 00:37:17.958, Speaker D: Well, I think the modularity thesis doesn't work if you don't have restaking, because you have to, if you're securing, say, the protocol layer, the base layer, and you envision a world where the protocol layer doesn't do everything, you necessarily need all these other layers, how are you going to secure those layers with the same kind of economic security that you have on the protocol?
00:37:18.006 - 00:37:19.974, Speaker A: You can't start with a whole new validator set.
00:37:20.094 - 00:37:50.136, Speaker D: Exactly. You need restaking. And so I think Eigen layer represents a very core part of the modularity thesis that's necessary to uphold this vision of a secure modular blockchain. And I think even that is still in its very experimental phases. I think Eigen Lair is launching in tranches and we've yet to see an actively validated set from Eigen Lair really take off. So a lot of the modularity thesis is very nascent.
00:37:50.200 - 00:38:13.588, Speaker A: I will say this is fascinating because one way or another, I mean, this is a scaling blockchains is a decades old question at this point. Right. I mean, I think back to the bitcoin block size wars. We've got Johnny Beer's book up here, which is a great book, by the way. I always shill this book. It's, I think, one of the most exciting and interesting books about bitcoin. And also, of course, I mean, bitcoin's history is blockchain's history.
00:38:13.588 - 00:38:28.844, Speaker A: And. Right. The debate was, well, we want to scale bitcoin. A bunch of merchants and others wanted to make it better for payments. Right. I said it's too expensive, the block space is too scarce. We should make it add block space to reduce fee pressure.
00:38:28.844 - 00:38:43.416, Speaker A: And that would enable like micropayments. Right. And that's, of course, bitcoiner's. The bitcoin blockchain went a little bit of a different way, but it has effectively increased the block size over time. But that's a pretty blunt object. Right. Let's just double the block.
00:38:43.416 - 00:39:00.424, Speaker A: It's like, let's just raise the gas limit. Right? And I've heard you say this, they've already raised the gas limit like a bajillion times on ETH, right. It's pretty high. Right. At this point. So there's plenty. Well, I don't know if there's not plenty, but there's just simply increasing the block size isn't enough because it puts all burdens on nodes.
00:39:00.424 - 00:39:21.970, Speaker A: In the end, it like, can really only do it so much. Right. You have other. The supporters of a bitcoin fork that I won't mention have argued that you could have gigabyte sized blocks. That would be fine. They say, well, it's not fine because there are latency issues. You can't download a gigabyte that quickly, so that causes node centralization, also the costs of the nodes to store all that data.
00:39:21.970 - 00:39:33.494, Speaker A: So this really is that same story reimagined again a better, newer way they think of scaling the blockchain to that point.
00:39:33.834 - 00:40:08.666, Speaker D: That issue of, you have to continually increase the block size. One of the core technologies that is often talked about when we talk about modularity thesis is the data availability sampling solution. So instead of basically increasing the block size, you allow nodes to sample data within a block rather than store it all. Yeah. And so instead of having to validate the entirety of the block, you could have a very large amount of data and nodes sampling, say like only 10%.
00:40:08.730 - 00:40:15.946, Speaker A: Yeah, you had the math in the paper, but it's like a very small amount. You can actually get to like 99.999% certainty that the whole block is good.
00:40:16.010 - 00:40:16.506, Speaker D: Exactly the problem.
00:40:16.530 - 00:40:19.282, Speaker A: Just by sampling a couple percent of it, it's really interesting.
00:40:19.338 - 00:40:29.668, Speaker D: But that only works if the point of the protocol is to be a data availability layer and store the data. It has to be temporarily, right? Temporarily store the data so that we.
00:40:29.676 - 00:40:31.068, Speaker A: Can look at it and sample it.
00:40:31.156 - 00:40:58.660, Speaker D: And say that this is verified data. However, if you're trying to make a protocol that also executes transactions, say has an EVM, that's where I think you start to get bogged down with like, okay, then do we actually have to increase the block sizes and all this stuff? But if you can make your layer as efficient of a data availability layer as possible, you can utilize these solutions like data availability sampling. That does allow anybody to be able to run a node on even like your smartphone.
00:40:58.732 - 00:41:16.644, Speaker A: Yeah, because they don't actually have to store it all, they just have to periodically sample some, verify it. Then I guess what you store the blockchain, they're storing as some light node, it stores a series of hashes rather than all the data, because they know that the data was valid and validated.
00:41:16.764 - 00:41:47.784, Speaker D: Yes. And if you have that kind of core decentralized layer for a data availability layer, you can have, say, more centralization on L2s and layer threes, but at least the very foundation of where all that data is being verified and validated is as decentralized as possible. And so I think that's where you start to trend towards a future where you can really have a secure, decentralized, modular blockchain. But there's a lot of pieces. There's a lot of pieces to that.
00:41:47.904 - 00:42:00.100, Speaker A: Yeah, we're gonna be following it before we wrap. What else are you looking at in the Ethereum world? You mentioned the stuff for the next upgrades. When do we expect at this point that Cancun Deneb upgrade, by the way?
00:42:00.252 - 00:42:04.196, Speaker D: Well, my projection, this has proto dank sharding.
00:42:04.300 - 00:42:05.340, Speaker A: 4844.
00:42:05.412 - 00:42:29.480, Speaker D: Yes, yes, 4844, Cancun Deneb. My projection is early next year. The way that testing is going, the way that developers are still identifying new bugs in the software, really just highlight that they're not ready yet to be launching this upgrade on existing public ethereum testnets, and they're going to have to get through that. I think they'll need at least a month to upgrade to.
00:42:29.512 - 00:42:31.176, Speaker A: And that puts us into the holiday season.
00:42:31.240 - 00:42:31.576, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:42:31.640 - 00:43:12.578, Speaker A: So they always, they don't like to write like fall and spring are typically like upgrade season. They don't like, they don't like the holidays. There was one, was it like, it might have been like five years ago at this .4 years ago they did an upgrade on like right around New Year's and there was a bug and so they had to do a quick like patch, like a hotfix patch upgrade, which was fine, but it was like during New Year's, like it was like on January 1 or something. Literally like people around the world were partying, including, you know, I mean everyone, everyone celebrates January 1, right? Like they always show when you, if you stay up and watch tv, like they show every single time zone celebrating it. And I remember that was like, I think they learned that they don't want to do any upgrades around that time because if anything happens, like people are literally like with their families and stuff.
00:43:12.666 - 00:43:13.146, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:43:13.250 - 00:43:19.024, Speaker A: So that's contributing to it also, right? I mean if they finish in a month, like why wouldn't they launch it in December? Probably for this reason.
00:43:19.104 - 00:43:34.912, Speaker D: Yeah. I mean, open source development, especially for Ethereum as a full time job, I mean, as much as possible, we don't want developers to be executing upgrades on holidays, weekends or like late into the night. I will say though, the merge was a unique kind of example of an.
00:43:34.928 - 00:43:37.952, Speaker A: Upgrade that we were driving to it. It was like, we gotta get this.
00:43:37.968 - 00:44:16.294, Speaker D: Done at like 04:00 a.m. At night. But, and I will say one other thing, outside of the Cancun Deneb upgrade that I hope people really pay attention to now is what's going into the upgrade afterwards. So there's a report that I had written about how we're going to have to address the validator set size growth. But in addition to that, there's a lot of questions around. Ok, do we focus the next upgrade on upgrading the EVM, or do we focus the upgrade on upgrading Ethereum's data storage models and moving towards say a vertical type data proof system versus Merkel trees?
00:44:16.674 - 00:44:20.922, Speaker A: You're going to tell us on a different show what Merkel trees are. I'm going to ask later, but I love it.
00:44:20.978 - 00:44:29.298, Speaker D: But these kinds of questions, it's a lot of politics. It's not even, it's going away from really like the technical merit of these upgrades and thinking about what's most important.
00:44:29.346 - 00:44:34.410, Speaker A: To what's the priority. Yeah, we'll get into that. That's really interesting. We don't know yet. There's a couple things on the table.
00:44:34.482 - 00:44:39.082, Speaker D: A couple things on the table. And already we're starting to see these discussions spring on the ACD call.
00:44:39.138 - 00:44:54.630, Speaker A: So some jockeying around. What's like, it's going to be interesting.
