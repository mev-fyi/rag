00:00:06.600 - 00:00:10.566, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, my friend, great to see you.
00:00:10.630 - 00:00:11.598, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:11.686 - 00:00:33.944, Speaker A: So I guess the country and the political complex in the country is bogged down with this debt ceiling debate. Let's just start there quickly. I mean, markets seem kind of pinned, at least in crypto. Markets have been pinned for a couple of weeks. Bitcoin at like 26 to 27 equities. Are they look a little choppy. I've seen some down days.
00:00:33.944 - 00:00:42.264, Speaker A: I've seen some flat days, but everyone's just watching this big event and currently has no resolution today on Wednesday. What are your thoughts on it?
00:00:42.424 - 00:01:16.732, Speaker B: You know, it's another example of dysfunctional government at its finest, partisan politics at its finest, and obviously leaves folks wanting more out of their representatives, first and foremost. Secondly, I think it's relevant for markets, but it's a lot of noise right now. Not that much signal in the sense that I think the real negotiating is going to be closer to the actual x date, literally.
00:01:16.788 - 00:01:17.532, Speaker A: Right up to it.
00:01:17.588 - 00:01:22.124, Speaker B: Right up to it. Which I think is going to really be around June 7, June 8, June 9. There.
00:01:22.164 - 00:01:23.292, Speaker A: So not the June 1.
00:01:23.388 - 00:01:28.478, Speaker B: Not the June 1 that Yellen is saying is like the absolute.
00:01:28.566 - 00:01:30.514, Speaker A: And June 1 is what, next Thursday?
00:01:31.334 - 00:02:00.224, Speaker B: I think sooner than that, I think. But, yeah, somewhere around there. Yeah, next Thursday sounds right. So we've got like a week ish, a week to two weeks to officially get something done. I think we will. The question is, once we do get something done, what does that mean for markets? And to be honest, right now it's really tough. There are some fed folks that have been calling for an additional two rate hikes this year.
00:02:00.304 - 00:02:00.924, Speaker A: Wow.
00:02:01.464 - 00:02:09.088, Speaker B: At the same time, like, we have 30 some odd basis points of cuts priced in for this year. So very divergent from like what the market is saying.
00:02:09.216 - 00:02:09.648, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:02:09.736 - 00:02:18.384, Speaker B: And there's some folks that are calling for, oh, Q four is going to be really bad recession. Like, you know, hard landing camp.
00:02:18.464 - 00:02:31.810, Speaker A: I saw David druck at some CNBC thing, forum out west. He was saying that it's looking pretty clear there'll be some kind of recession, but he said it would be milder. He thought as of this moment, that was his. Yeah.
00:02:31.842 - 00:02:34.650, Speaker B: No, I like the idea of a mild recession back half of the year.
00:02:34.722 - 00:02:35.098, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:02:35.186 - 00:02:36.730, Speaker B: On the Q four.
00:02:36.882 - 00:02:42.738, Speaker A: But have we seen any evidence that that's actually, actually starting yet or it's still in the pure prediction phase?
00:02:42.786 - 00:02:43.362, Speaker B: Squint.
00:02:43.498 - 00:02:44.666, Speaker A: So you got a squint at the date.
00:02:44.730 - 00:03:41.140, Speaker B: I mean, so here, there's a couple of things. Like one of the things we like to look at is like second order derivatives, or, sorry, first order derivatives of economic data. So are initial jobless claims going up at an increasing rate or are they going up at a decreasing rate? And so things of that nature and what we're seeing in that context and some of the other sort of broader leading indicators is that there is some weakness in the US economy. Right. Like small business sentiment surveys, like the CFO things, manufacturing, PMI being sub 50, right, in contraction territory, all of the regional fed surveys being in deep negative territory. The cost of supply chain elements and all those supply chain metrics that have come down a lot. And generally the price of commodities, with the exception of oil, recently they've generally been trading lower.
00:03:41.140 - 00:04:13.826, Speaker B: There are lots of signs that at least the pace of inflation and the pace of economic recovery and growth is cooling. The question is, is it cooling fast enough to bring inflation down and to alter fed path and fed policy in a meaningful way? That's the real TBD. But yes, there are cracks. Got it. Look at mortgage applications. They're down a lot. Credit card spending is up and things of that nature.
00:04:13.826 - 00:04:21.630, Speaker B: So there are signs. But to David Solomon's point, there aren't a crazy amount of signs right now.
00:04:21.702 - 00:04:24.070, Speaker A: And they're not like deep scary signs.
00:04:24.262 - 00:04:36.434, Speaker B: They're not. Commercial real estate is a little scary out there. But again, there was a commercial real estate portfolio sale that went through the other day at decent levels on Cre.
00:04:36.814 - 00:04:56.954, Speaker A: Maybe help explain this to me. One thing I know obviously hurt commercial real estate was COVID and work from home. Right. And you've heard municipal leaders, for example, Mayor Eric Adams in New York has pleaded with business to make your employees come back in. Right. Cause it's not just the real estate, it's the coffee shops and the lunch breaks.
00:04:56.994 - 00:04:57.314, Speaker B: Everything.
00:04:57.394 - 00:04:58.106, Speaker C: Yep.
00:04:58.290 - 00:05:09.662, Speaker A: It's literally the MTA, subways, everything. Taxis. Is that. What else? Is that the main reason? Work from home or what were the other factors?
00:05:09.858 - 00:05:16.870, Speaker B: Oh, no. It's a fundamental change in workplace behavior by the entirety of the US workforce.
00:05:17.022 - 00:05:20.110, Speaker A: Which is work from home, even if not from home, even if just some days.
00:05:20.222 - 00:05:20.590, Speaker B: Correct?
00:05:20.662 - 00:05:21.314, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:05:22.134 - 00:05:31.382, Speaker B: And it's also just like folks expectations of what they need when they are working. Right. In terms of like lounge areas and like sunlight.
00:05:31.438 - 00:05:34.070, Speaker A: You have to build up like more expensive offices, also.
00:05:34.182 - 00:05:38.414, Speaker B: Correct. Right. Because all of a sudden there's a bunch of real estate that nobody wants.
00:05:38.574 - 00:05:39.446, Speaker A: And it's older.
00:05:39.550 - 00:05:39.814, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:05:39.854 - 00:05:51.462, Speaker B: Nobody wants. The older stuff is like going cheap because there's so much supply. Right. And so, and it costs a lot of money to re outfit old buildings and make them like new.
00:05:51.558 - 00:06:13.286, Speaker A: I saw also, you know, one solution to this has been in some places residential, turning them into residential. But I read this great piece, actually. I think it was in the New York Times a couple weeks ago about like, where that's worked and how, and also what types of buildings that's worked on and how, like, a lot of places, including like, a lot of Manhattan is not. You really can't retrofit them.
00:06:13.310 - 00:06:13.518, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:06:13.566 - 00:06:13.822, Speaker A: Right.
00:06:13.878 - 00:06:15.670, Speaker B: Yeah. So it's a huge challenge.
00:06:15.742 - 00:06:17.198, Speaker A: They don't have windows that open, for example.
00:06:17.246 - 00:06:17.494, Speaker B: Correct.
00:06:17.534 - 00:06:20.182, Speaker A: Which you literally need. And residential.
00:06:20.238 - 00:06:30.918, Speaker B: No, these buildings were not designed to be residential. And so, yeah, there is like, this looming thing of like, all, like, go through, like, downtown Chicago, downtown San Francisco.
00:06:31.006 - 00:06:31.678, Speaker A: Not good.
00:06:31.806 - 00:06:32.534, Speaker B: It's empty.
00:06:32.614 - 00:06:33.038, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:06:33.126 - 00:06:38.818, Speaker B: And like you were saying, the stores and the businesses in the areas are like, severely impacted.
00:06:38.866 - 00:06:44.082, Speaker A: New York has to be one of the least in one of the best positions compared to some of those other cities, though.
00:06:44.218 - 00:06:49.174, Speaker B: I think it's much better than San Francisco where they were barely working there to begin with.
00:06:49.754 - 00:06:51.530, Speaker A: A lot of at home tech developers and stuff.
00:06:51.562 - 00:07:00.610, Speaker B: Right, exactly, exactly. And so I actually need to follow up on this. But there was a building that was going up for sale. It was a salesforce building in San Francisco.
00:07:00.642 - 00:07:01.722, Speaker A: A salesforce building.
00:07:01.858 - 00:07:02.370, Speaker B: One of them.
00:07:02.402 - 00:07:02.706, Speaker A: Okay.
00:07:02.770 - 00:07:03.346, Speaker B: They have one.
00:07:03.410 - 00:07:05.822, Speaker A: I think Salesforce Tower is the largest building they have.
00:07:05.938 - 00:07:31.702, Speaker B: But there's another one, the other one that is going up for auction. And it was purchased in 2019 or 2018, something like that, I believe was for north of $200 million. And it's going for much less than that now. Wow. I think it's going to go for 60 million or something stupid. And on top of that, it needs 40 million in additional spending to get it up to snuff.
00:07:31.798 - 00:07:32.214, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
00:07:32.254 - 00:07:33.982, Speaker B: To like release, make it even usable.
00:07:34.038 - 00:07:34.230, Speaker A: Really?
00:07:34.262 - 00:07:34.670, Speaker C: Yeah. Right.
00:07:34.702 - 00:07:44.246, Speaker B: So it's like, you know, one, and then you have the banking side of things where like, you know, bankers have made loans assuming certain property values.
00:07:44.310 - 00:07:44.870, Speaker A: Right, right.
00:07:44.982 - 00:07:45.678, Speaker B: Certain recovery.
00:07:45.726 - 00:07:48.150, Speaker A: And they're pretty long duration loans. Right.
00:07:48.222 - 00:07:49.390, Speaker B: Depends, but yes.
00:07:49.462 - 00:07:49.806, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:07:49.870 - 00:07:53.806, Speaker B: So it's, we'll see what the spillover impacts are.
00:07:53.870 - 00:07:58.068, Speaker A: That's a tough, like, pretty long term question for America in general, right?
00:07:58.156 - 00:07:59.108, Speaker B: No, absolutely.
00:07:59.156 - 00:07:59.340, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:07:59.372 - 00:07:59.984, Speaker A: Wow.
00:08:00.404 - 00:08:10.716, Speaker B: And it's a really interesting challenge. And so it's like, is all of downtown and modern America, is that ever gonna be the same again?
00:08:10.860 - 00:08:17.268, Speaker A: And it's weird because a lot of young people and young workers, they like to live in cities, but they don't wanna go into the office.
00:08:17.396 - 00:08:17.724, Speaker B: Correct.
00:08:17.764 - 00:08:30.164, Speaker A: So it's like there's. That's why that conversion to real residential, if it can be done, is so important. If it can be done. But like I said, I read that it's in large part cannot be done with the buildings we have right now.
00:08:30.204 - 00:08:31.308, Speaker B: Correct, correct.
00:08:31.476 - 00:08:38.980, Speaker A: And it takes a long time, by the way, to either knock down and rebuild or retrofit. Like, these are not small projects.
00:08:39.132 - 00:09:24.088, Speaker B: No, no, absolutely. But, yeah, that's just another sort of overhang out there. But we've been talking a lot about the things that are going to impact folks in Q four. Excess savings are going to come down because of student loan repayments, current existing high credit card balances, and credit card balances that are growing at historically high interest rates. And so we just raised interest rates by 500 plus basis points, et cetera. There's going to be a lot of things in Q four that we need to see happen and that are going to wild, broadly drive weakness.
00:09:24.136 - 00:09:24.440, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:09:24.512 - 00:09:57.544, Speaker A: All right. So in crypto, we've talked about this before, and I think this is probably still the case, particularly for bitcoin. I think most people are looking at it from here. Paul Tudor Jones, I think, said a couple weeks ago that he loves bitcoin. He'll always have some bitcoin, but right now, they said, would he buy it now? Like today, Aaron Ross Sorkin asked him on CNBC, and he's like, he's like, maybe not right now. Like, we had a big run and like, you know, who knows? A lot of people are talking about supply dynamics now. Right.
00:09:57.544 - 00:10:16.964, Speaker A: Because I will say you do have the ordinals driven sort of, like, application layer, possible expansion on bitcoin, which is sort of an interesting, like, maybe that will have an impact on bitcoin performance this year. But that's one thing, supply. What else are we sort of looking at? Like, are you thinking about when it comes to crypto this year?
00:10:17.304 - 00:10:17.664, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:17.704 - 00:10:21.100, Speaker A: No, as you assume, staking is a thing up? I mean.
00:10:21.172 - 00:10:30.052, Speaker B: No, no, absolutely. I mean, just look at the Lido staking statistics. I think we've already, like, restaked the amount that Celsius unstaked. Yeah, it's all time high staking right now.
00:10:30.108 - 00:10:35.276, Speaker A: And so the queue to enter is like 30 plus days now. There's so many people trying to.
00:10:35.340 - 00:11:05.918, Speaker B: Right. So that's a huge story. And, I mean, if you just look at gas prices over the past couple months, like, they've been high. Like, people are doing stuff and maybe it's still memes and dogs, coins and stuff, but people are still doing stuff on chain. So that's constructive. But for me, generally, what I'm looking for is the macro response in bitcoin. This is a year where I think gold is probably going to take out its highs and make new trend highs.
00:11:05.918 - 00:11:28.138, Speaker B: As folks realize that in the hard landing scenario, if these governments and central banks actually achieve their goal of bringing inflation down, right. They're going to bring it down to a level where it's going to force them to reengage the monetary sort of spigot, right? It's like, wait, we're going to bring inflation down by tanking the economy? What's your response to tanking the economy?
00:11:28.146 - 00:11:29.634, Speaker A: How are you going to stimulate the economy?
00:11:29.714 - 00:11:43.506, Speaker B: Print money again? And so it's like eventually you're going to get back to that point. And that's when you should see, like, hard money really perform. And that's when I would expect bitcoin to sort of go take its next leg.
00:11:43.570 - 00:12:05.868, Speaker A: Okay, here's a tough question, too. And I know that people are many minds in this. I think the consensus is one way that we know, but death ceiling, let's say a default or not even a default. Default's like, who knows how this plays, right? But let's just say like a 2011 scenario with like a, you know, it gets done, but we get a credit downgrade or something because of it. Like, you know, it's tumultuous. It doesn't end up getting passed perfectly at the end of night. So it's tumultuous.
00:12:05.868 - 00:12:13.636, Speaker A: And most people, I think, obviously would say what risk assets perform terribly in that scenario. I think they, I saw on CNBC.
00:12:13.740 - 00:12:15.652, Speaker B: Down 10%, plus some people I saw.
00:12:15.668 - 00:12:30.956, Speaker A: It was down 17% in 2011, leading in. And it was that just on the market's fears about what would happen. And that sort of kicked the politicians into gear to get it done. Isn't there an argument, at least on a fundamental basis, that bitcoin should perform well in that scenario?
00:12:31.020 - 00:12:33.508, Speaker B: I think it should. Theoretically it should moon.
00:12:33.556 - 00:12:36.764, Speaker A: Right? It's a global, decentralized, absolutely shouldn't moon.
00:12:36.804 - 00:13:08.488, Speaker B: But it's this, like, what people need to realize is that the dollar and treasuries are the denominator for everything. Every asset on the planet is measured against dollars and therefore treasuries. Right. When you start having doubts about the denominator of what every asset, currency, like you name, it is measured off of. Yeah, bitcoin should rally, right? Because it should force you to think, what should my denominator really be?
00:13:08.536 - 00:13:10.192, Speaker A: And what is money? And all those questions.
00:13:10.248 - 00:13:10.792, Speaker B: 100%.
00:13:10.848 - 00:13:19.144, Speaker A: And it's global. So it's not just Americans. Right. I mean, it's like other people losing faith in America or american, you know, the risk free rate. Not. No longer being risk free.
00:13:19.264 - 00:13:19.992, Speaker B: Correct.
00:13:20.168 - 00:13:23.040, Speaker A: Should. So. But you know, what do you think that would.
00:13:23.072 - 00:13:29.408, Speaker B: Let's say no, because right now it trades like a risk asset. So people are going to see s and p down 10%.
00:13:29.496 - 00:13:31.848, Speaker A: They're going to be like, right, sell everything.
00:13:31.936 - 00:13:50.394, Speaker B: Sell everything that is in. However, I do think that there's a lower bound to bitcoin that I'd say bitcoin is going to outperform. Beta adjusted to s and P, I would tell you. Because they're definitely bitcoin trades partly a risk asset, but also similar to gold.
00:13:50.474 - 00:13:59.890, Speaker A: Right. Because there's a lot of holders that view it that way, but not enough traders. And part of that's like. Cause there's sort of the toddlers and then there's the speculators thing.
00:13:59.962 - 00:14:00.586, Speaker B: Yes, exactly.
00:14:00.610 - 00:14:01.402, Speaker A: And it's like the.
00:14:01.498 - 00:14:13.836, Speaker B: But ultimately, like, there's no way that a default by the US isn't in theory, like a positive development for bitcoin.
00:14:13.940 - 00:14:35.246, Speaker A: Right. I mean, you're looking for other denominators. Like you said, it's really a story of just, you know, it's been almost 15 years since Bitcoin launched, and it's still just not understood well enough. It really does. I think you and I know, and I think our audience does too, really does have properties that make it attractive in an environment like that. It really is. I was saying this.
00:14:35.246 - 00:14:51.526, Speaker A: If you wanna go be a prepper and hide in your bunker, right? Like, well, okay, got some gold, but like, you know, you wanna spend that, you're gonna have to, like, I don't know what, melt it or use the whole coin or the whole gold bar. And you're gonna have to leave your bunker. You're gonna have to go meet someone and trade with it. But bitcoin you could just send at anytime, anywhere.
00:14:51.630 - 00:14:52.038, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:14:52.126 - 00:15:02.278, Speaker A: And it has these monetary policies that do make it interesting. And gold, like, so it should work in an environment like that. But is it just not enough people know that and not enough people think about it that way?
00:15:02.366 - 00:15:31.614, Speaker B: I think it's just a lack of. Of, like, full thought process. I was running a little long, but I actually do think this is an exercise worth talking about. But basically there's a lot of aspects of bitcoin where you're like, oh, it's a great asset in this scenario. That's a sub five probability event. And there's a slew of sub 5% probability events that would make you want to own bitcoin. Right? We are in the middle of one of them, right.
00:15:31.614 - 00:15:44.502, Speaker B: The US government not paying its obligations. In a world where the US government is not paying its obligations, I want to own alternatives. And crypto being another alternative, especially one.
00:15:44.518 - 00:15:47.318, Speaker A: That you can send, real estate's great, but I can't pay you in real estate.
00:15:47.406 - 00:15:48.630, Speaker B: No, absolutely.
00:15:48.702 - 00:15:50.394, Speaker A: Gold you can, kind of, but it's not.
00:15:50.734 - 00:15:53.390, Speaker B: And then it's like money confiscation.
00:15:53.582 - 00:16:00.474, Speaker A: Well, the other one, we had another one of these, which was any kind of uncertainty in the safety of the banking system. So this year has seen no safety.
00:16:01.034 - 00:16:28.282, Speaker B: You don't trust your bank account, right? Like, you lose faith and like, there are bank runs, right? Like this is like, literally you're hitting on these back to back, like kind of things. But again, these are like one you think about. This is happening in the US, right? The same phenomenon is like everywhere. It's like, wait, guys, we're like, other places don't have debt ceilings. They just keep printing money in their own nonsense. Currencies that continue to devaluate over time. Right, right.
00:16:28.282 - 00:16:36.314, Speaker B: And so, like hyperinflation, right? Like we're dealing with an inflation crisis in the US, right, and abroad. I mean, you look, the UK CPI.
00:16:36.354 - 00:16:37.570, Speaker A: Numbers came in hot, right?
00:16:37.602 - 00:16:39.778, Speaker B: Like these, like, the money is just.
00:16:39.866 - 00:16:42.706, Speaker A: Not what, it's not working properly.
00:16:42.730 - 00:16:54.722, Speaker B: It's like the inflation is too damn hot and the monetary responses, like, there's a limit to that, right? Like, you don't want riots on the streets because like the economy is tanking and food prices are still soaring.
00:16:54.778 - 00:16:55.154, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:16:55.234 - 00:17:33.708, Speaker B: Right? And so you are hitting on like all of these like stress scenarios where if you were like thinking back like two years ago, three years ago, or at any point in time, you're like, what are some of the tail scenarios? That should mean that bitcoin's got more value and you're hitting on so many of them. And so that's why for me, even though I see price action, that isn't great at times. It's just a matter of time. If you just pv this kind of behavioral response function over time versus what we know are going to be our challenges going forward, right? Like the value's just way higher. Cause it's an option on all this stuff.
00:17:33.756 - 00:17:39.268, Speaker A: And so anyway, love it. Bimnet abibi from galaxy trading as always, my friend. Great to see you.
00:17:39.316 - 00:17:40.104, Speaker B: Thank you.
