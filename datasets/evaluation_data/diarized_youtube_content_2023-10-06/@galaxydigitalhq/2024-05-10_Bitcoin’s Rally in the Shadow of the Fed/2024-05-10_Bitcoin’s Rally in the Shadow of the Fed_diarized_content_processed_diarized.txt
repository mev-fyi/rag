00:00:08.360 - 00:00:12.902, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnett. Welcome to Galaxy Brands.
00:00:12.958 - 00:00:14.114, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:14.494 - 00:00:42.100, Speaker A: So, you know, it feels, from a news standpoint, certainly less busy than last week and some of the prior weeks with all the data and the Fed meeting. And. But I would say that, you know, in our markets, bitcoin rose from the 56k area all the way back into the sixties, and now we're 62 something or other. That felt good, being back above 60. What was your take on that? Was it just sort of oversold and then, I don't know, people overreacting one way or another?
00:00:42.132 - 00:01:27.098, Speaker B: Yeah. No, I think you had a positive catalyst in broader risk markets with the dovish Fed. In addition, you had an oversold market that was at support, 100 day moving averages, 60k support level, etcetera. And you started to see a little bit of optimism around ETF flows, et cetera. And then you had a bit of a short squeeze. You had a relief rally in bitcoin, and you had similar price action in all risk assets, basically over that time period. And I think it's warranted because I do think the high in front end yields are in.
00:01:27.098 - 00:01:43.714, Speaker B: And that's what Powell stated implicitly at the last FOMC meeting. And that's generally good for risk. And the first order reaction is for people to buy risk assets and for volume to come down and for dollars to sell off. And that's kind of what you had happen.
00:01:43.834 - 00:02:20.522, Speaker A: Yeah. And then what else? I wanted to ask you a little bit about sort of a more macro thesis, especially since we don't have a lot of data to come through today. Where do we see, let's say, if Trump is elected? Like, do we get any hints? Because I remember he was, remember when he was president the first time, he was tweeting at Jay Powell saying, like, you got a lower rates and stuff, meddling a little bit there. I mean, where do you see were Trump to be reelected? A Trump administration going on? Biden's always talking about the White House, always talking about bidenomics. What would Trumponomics look like in your mind?
00:02:20.688 - 00:02:40.486, Speaker B: Right. So I will highlight two things to frame this conversation. Right? So I believe it was in 2018 ish, when front end interest rates were at 2.5% and Trump was starting a trade war with China, and risk markets started to get a little wobbly.
00:02:40.670 - 00:02:41.254, Speaker C: Right?
00:02:41.374 - 00:03:19.794, Speaker B: And Powell, at that time, because of those concerns, partially because of those concerns, most likely because of pressure from the White House as well, decided to cut interest rates when there was no need to. Unemployment was almost at structural lows at that time. And Powell still decided to cut interest rates in 2018. And this was a time when inflation wasn't as much of a concern. Right. And people hadn't really thought that the US could be in a six, seven, 8% inflationary environment ever. So I'll caveat it with that.
00:03:19.794 - 00:04:00.084, Speaker B: But I think the key takeaway is that absolutely, the White House can have an influence on central bankers. And I point to that as kind of the main example, because if you look at the set of facts, which was unemployment around, like, 4.2%. Right. And having achieved solid normalization, the Fed was at that time methodically raising rates, and they were getting back to a place that felt more sustainable. And yet he decided to do an insurance cut at that time. And so that's one. And then the second one is how a second term president behaves.
00:04:00.084 - 00:04:10.832, Speaker B: And I'll give you Barack Obama's first sort of address. You know that event where they do comedic speeches.
00:04:10.928 - 00:04:11.232, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:11.288 - 00:04:12.832, Speaker B: It's the commencement.
00:04:12.888 - 00:04:17.188, Speaker A: What's it called? No, no, it's the Friars dinner or whatever. Yeah, sure.
00:04:17.236 - 00:04:18.444, Speaker B: Where he addresses the media.
00:04:18.524 - 00:04:18.692, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:18.708 - 00:04:22.588, Speaker A: It's all like, well, there's the White House correspondence association dinner. Is that the one you're talking about?
00:04:22.636 - 00:04:36.444, Speaker B: Exactly. And that was one of my favorite correspondence dinner speeches, because essentially Obama was like, yeah, I want to fix immigration policy. You know what, bucket? I'm just gonna do executive action.
00:04:36.604 - 00:04:37.140, Speaker C: Right?
00:04:37.252 - 00:04:42.442, Speaker B: Oh, you know, we have to address this issue. Bucket. Executive action.
00:04:42.538 - 00:04:42.818, Speaker C: Right.
00:04:42.866 - 00:04:47.546, Speaker B: Student loans or whatever it was that bucket. Yes, literally. Bucket.
00:04:47.650 - 00:04:47.962, Speaker C: Right.
00:04:48.018 - 00:04:49.578, Speaker B: And we can say it here, but.
00:04:49.666 - 00:04:51.354, Speaker A: Right, right, right. We know what he's referring to.
00:04:51.434 - 00:05:00.786, Speaker B: Yeah. And that's the kind of mentality that a second term president really comes into, because there is nothing on the other side.
00:05:00.890 - 00:05:01.682, Speaker C: Yeah. Right.
00:05:01.778 - 00:05:12.814, Speaker B: And now take the example with Trump, and you throw in a guy that is probably less fearful of the court system than he's ever been in his entire life, which is, I mean, assuming he gets elected.
00:05:12.894 - 00:05:13.254, Speaker A: Correct.
00:05:13.334 - 00:05:42.354, Speaker B: Assuming he gets elected. This is all under the assumption. And factually speaking, like, real clear politics has it neck and neck leaning a little towards Trump on the betting odds, but it's an even race. But we just. We're just kind of looking at the hypothetical. And so you've got this guy who's not afraid of impeachment. Cause he's been impeached a couple times, he's not afraid of the court system anymore, and he's on a second term, and nothing to really lose.
00:05:42.514 - 00:05:42.930, Speaker C: Right.
00:05:43.002 - 00:05:56.554, Speaker B: And so that's the recipe you have when you, if he enters office. Now, what can we assess about his economic policies that he wants to pursue? Well, tariffs, right.
00:05:56.634 - 00:05:56.970, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:57.042 - 00:06:03.082, Speaker B: Tariffs against China, you know, tariff against, you know, auto imports, basically, USA first.
00:06:03.178 - 00:06:04.146, Speaker A: He's a protectionist.
00:06:04.210 - 00:06:33.170, Speaker B: Protectionist. And we know what that looks like in the commodity sector. That is commodity prices higher, that will ultimately translate to cost of goods increasing and those costs being transferred to consumers via retail prices. So the commodity complex, not looking great under a high tariff regime. Another sort of lever that a president can pull is with his treasury policy.
00:06:33.352 - 00:06:33.886, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:33.990 - 00:07:01.892, Speaker B: If you issue a ton more front end paper versus back end paper, et cetera, and treasury buybacks. And so the treasury is actually a pretty strong agent in terms of impacting economic policy. And you can appoint folks that will sort of implement more dovish kind of policies, ones that will kind of reduce friction in the economy and synthetically give you lower rates.
00:07:02.038 - 00:07:02.724, Speaker C: Right.
00:07:03.344 - 00:07:09.728, Speaker B: And in addition to that, you can appoint fed members that are also more dovish.
00:07:09.856 - 00:07:10.524, Speaker C: Right.
00:07:10.864 - 00:08:24.530, Speaker B: Including the same ambiguity whether or not the Fed chairman can get fired or not. But I will tell you, in the construct of an empowered president that doesn't care about winning another election or the court system, I will, I would guess that he's going to take, he's going to do whatever he wants. If you combine high tariff policy with a loose treasury and more dovish kind of fed members, it's going to be inflationary. I don't see how Trumponomics isn't materially inflationary. And so in this election, you're deciding between inflationary policies that are pretty blatant and in your face, and then you've got the other side, which is like, they still want excessive spending and stuff. They want to do student loan forgiveness. They want to potentially make it easier to get second mortgages on your homes via the Fannie and Freddie being able to potentially make loans, et cetera.
00:08:24.530 - 00:08:35.602, Speaker B: And so really, there's no outcome where I don't see a second term for Biden or a second term for Trump as being inflationary.
00:08:35.778 - 00:08:44.442, Speaker A: Yeah. Is that like the 1970s, eighties? Like the second wave? Is that how worried are you in general about a second wave inflation?
00:08:44.538 - 00:08:50.948, Speaker B: Very concerned. And so right now, you are seeing the signs that us consumer is slowing.
00:08:51.036 - 00:08:51.260, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:51.292 - 00:09:06.780, Speaker B: There was actually a very interesting piece today that how Wall street is kind of mismeasuring the debt burden that's on us consumers right now because of these buy now, pay later programs that don't even actually get captured, that doesn't show.
00:09:06.812 - 00:09:08.692, Speaker A: Up in the credit card data or the correct.
00:09:08.748 - 00:09:37.294, Speaker B: And the credit card data is starting to look worse. The auto loan data is starting to look worse, et cetera. While there are signs that the economy is slowing and while that's deflationary, I worry that the response of the Fed in terms of cutting rates, the response of Congress in terms of more stimulative efforts, especially going into an election, will ultimately kind of outweigh the drag that you get from a slowing.
00:09:37.674 - 00:10:07.042, Speaker A: You and I have talked about this a little bit, too, but some of the infrastructure bill money and the, the inflation Reduction act money, so hasn't been spent. Hasn't been spent. The feds, the feds federal government rightly pushed a lot of that down to the states to figure out how to do it because they can't literally micromanage. I'm happy they actually acknowledged this. They can't literally micromanage the spending on projects all over the entire country from Washington. But the states haven't spent it all, so they're still spending, which is like. And some of it's not even spent at all yet.
00:10:07.042 - 00:10:12.220, Speaker A: Right. So that's also like lingering inflationary pressure as well.
00:10:12.322 - 00:10:58.314, Speaker B: Yeah. No, and when you're consistently running two plus trillion dollar deficits, right, like, that's inflationary, that's a lot of spending. That's a lot of money. And so I think the reinflation risk is super real, and there are ways to play it in the market. But right here, right now, I wouldn't own long end fixed income, especially us fixed income, because of the fiscal path and how unsustainable it is. But it also just, you don't get paid enough for that risk. The risk that inflation is well above and beyond the returns that you're gonna generate, the risk that there's default risk with Congress perpetually having repassing debt ceilings, et cetera.
00:10:58.314 - 00:11:45.844, Speaker B: And so I think bonds are just still very mispriced in the US. And then that creates such weird dynamics with the dollar, right? Is high inflation in the US and higher interest rate policy ultimately, is that dollar positive, negative? There's so many variables up in the air that it's really hard to trade. But ultimately, I do think that crypto will find some footing in that environment because, you know, one thing I know for sure is that that monetary policy is defined and it allows me to plan accordingly. And so, you know, it's really hard right now.
00:11:46.344 - 00:12:06.448, Speaker A: It sounds complicated. I was going to mention, too, before you said when Trump had been pressuring the Fed to act a certain way. Biden has tacitly been doing, not as openly as Trump tweeting, like, lower rates now or whatever he tweeted back then. But Biden has been predicting that rates would get lowered by the fall. Stuff like that. Like saying it publicly, that is pressure.
00:12:06.576 - 00:12:11.912, Speaker B: But I mean, did you even see the guy on his economic council try to talk about debt?
00:12:12.008 - 00:12:19.524, Speaker A: Yeah, that was in the Stephanie Kelton movie, the finding the money. I actually haven't seen that movie yet. I heard it's good. But I did see he could not explain how money is created.
00:12:19.824 - 00:12:28.744, Speaker B: Could not. And I would tell you that what's the sad part is that if you ask any one of our congressmen, wow.
00:12:28.784 - 00:12:31.376, Speaker A: There'S like 460 of them, 435 members.
00:12:31.400 - 00:12:43.896, Speaker B: Of the 430 of them, I would bet that maybe, like, less than 10% could answer those questions in a reasonable way. And for the senate, you'd hope it's better.
00:12:44.040 - 00:12:44.488, Speaker C: Right?
00:12:44.576 - 00:12:55.200, Speaker A: That's what I liked about Neil Kashkari one time. And it's the first vocal clip on our intro. He was like, yeah, yeah. We just have infinite cash. We just push a button and print it. That's the simplest answer.
00:12:55.312 - 00:12:59.004, Speaker B: And Powell's given that on 60 minutes before, too, et cetera.
00:12:59.344 - 00:13:01.288, Speaker A: That doesn't inspire confidence, though, in our opinion.
00:13:01.296 - 00:13:22.240, Speaker B: It does it, because there's nobody that's like, oh, okay, let me look at these CBO projections. And what do they actually mean? And, like, you know, ten years forward from now, like, what are people gonna be upset about? And, like, how can we, like, try to address it now? But there's no possible way of, like, addressing it in the current political economic concept.
00:13:22.272 - 00:13:25.384, Speaker A: Right. Because there's, there's no. The two year term cycles.
00:13:25.464 - 00:13:27.056, Speaker B: Two year term cycles. Yeah, yeah.
00:13:27.080 - 00:13:33.632, Speaker A: You have no incentive to do well by your grandchildren as a politician. Right. You've got to do well by the grandparents who are voting for you now.
00:13:33.808 - 00:13:36.856, Speaker B: Absolutely. And the grandparents that are donating to your campaign now.
00:13:36.920 - 00:13:38.324, Speaker A: And they do vote and donate.
00:13:38.624 - 00:14:01.640, Speaker B: Absolutely. And so it's just like, it's all coming to a head right now. And the policies we make now have such severe ramifications on what we do going forward. And it's to the point where even, like, you know, the fed, like, cutting now, like, the impact of reducing interest expenses is so huge when you compound it over time.
00:14:01.712 - 00:14:07.204, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. One little cut could save us trillions of dollars in 20 years. Right. It's like, crazy.
00:14:07.624 - 00:14:16.404, Speaker B: And so that's like, that's why it's hard for anybody to really be in that policy and not want to cut interest rates. Yeah, it is.
00:14:16.824 - 00:14:22.428, Speaker A: Well, the country needs it, really. I mean, the country's balance sheet needs it badly.
00:14:22.556 - 00:14:24.804, Speaker B: But we can have this debate another time.
00:14:24.844 - 00:14:27.380, Speaker A: But if we have 20% inflation like we did in the seventies.
00:14:27.532 - 00:14:27.860, Speaker B: Yes.
00:14:27.892 - 00:14:29.324, Speaker A: The country doesn't do well.
00:14:29.404 - 00:14:29.900, Speaker B: Does not.
00:14:29.932 - 00:14:35.396, Speaker A: It's a very tricky situation. Next time, I want to ask you about the japanese yen.
00:14:35.540 - 00:14:36.060, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:14:36.092 - 00:14:38.196, Speaker A: What, that thing?
00:14:38.260 - 00:14:40.044, Speaker B: Well, their intervention is not working.
00:14:40.124 - 00:14:51.396, Speaker A: No, I see. It's back up. Let's do it. Seems like they need inflation, though, to get off. They have an incredible amount of debt, too. Eventually they got to inflate that away, probably, but they don't want it to be, like, crazy rapid. Yeah.
00:14:51.396 - 00:14:53.804, Speaker A: That's also because they stepped in twice last week.
00:14:53.884 - 00:14:54.516, Speaker B: Yes.
00:14:54.660 - 00:14:56.028, Speaker A: And, you know, didn't really.
00:14:56.156 - 00:15:02.564, Speaker B: They took down 160 to a low of, like, 152. 151. 84.
00:15:02.644 - 00:15:02.924, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:02.964 - 00:15:05.236, Speaker B: And we're now trading closer to 156.
00:15:05.300 - 00:15:10.692, Speaker A: Yeah. It's, like, coming. Yeah. The trend is intact. That. Yeah. All right, we'll talk about that another time.
00:15:10.692 - 00:15:13.244, Speaker A: My friend Bim Nat Avivi from Galaxy trading. Thank you so much.
00:15:13.324 - 00:15:13.924, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
