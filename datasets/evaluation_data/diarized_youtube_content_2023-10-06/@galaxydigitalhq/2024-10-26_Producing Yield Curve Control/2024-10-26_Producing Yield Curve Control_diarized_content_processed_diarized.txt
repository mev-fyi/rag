00:00:00.200 - 00:00:21.945, Speaker A: The way I think about it is there's already kind of synthetic yield curve control happening in the U.S. it's not it's, you know, very wide band, I would say. But, you know, the levers that effectively produce this yield curve control are twofold, right. Or threefold. Right. So one, the Fed tells you where they're going to eventually take rates to. Right.
00:00:21.945 - 00:00:46.241, Speaker A: So the DOT plot forward guidance, right. Allows the kind of mark the market to kind of be pegged to something. Right. Secondly, which is where long run inflation expectations get pegged to. And so that keeps a lid on the back end. Second way they can control it is by direct balance sheet involvement. So purchases and sales of securities in their balance sheet portfolio.
00:00:46.241 - 00:00:57.865, Speaker A: The third way is adjusting the issuance. This is more treasury issuing more T bills rather than notes and bonds. They can adjust the curve by that.
