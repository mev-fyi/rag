00:00:06.800 - 00:00:10.766, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, great to see you, my friend.
00:00:10.870 - 00:00:11.950, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:12.062 - 00:00:13.774, Speaker A: So a lot has happened.
00:00:13.854 - 00:00:14.190, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:00:14.222 - 00:00:21.966, Speaker A: This last week we recorded last Wednesday and obviously Silicon Valley bank went under and was taken over after our recording.
00:00:22.030 - 00:00:22.674, Speaker B: Yep.
00:00:23.414 - 00:00:25.414, Speaker A: Signature bank was taken over.
00:00:25.494 - 00:00:25.942, Speaker B: Yep.
00:00:26.038 - 00:00:41.708, Speaker A: Reasons unclear. And Silvergate had previously wound down. They weren't actually taken over or anything, but big fears in the banking industry from basically when we recorded last time until mostly yesterday.
00:00:41.756 - 00:00:45.148, Speaker B: But then you can add Credit Suisse onto it as of this morning.
00:00:45.316 - 00:00:46.384, Speaker A: What do they say?
00:00:46.844 - 00:01:17.844, Speaker B: Well, one of their top investors, which is, I believe, a fund or somebody that's related to the saudi arabian family, one of their largest equity holders, basically said they're not willing to put in any more investment or increase their equity stake, and that didn't provide much confidence. What I'm guessing is happening is you're probably seeing further deposit outflows from Credit Suisse, but you've had their credit default swaps go crazy.
00:01:19.334 - 00:01:22.934, Speaker A: It's spreading a little bit. It hasn't stopped spreading yet, I guess.
00:01:23.054 - 00:01:33.590, Speaker B: Correct. And it went from just being a us regional bank issue to now being a little bit more international in the sense that a large swiss bank, basically.
00:01:33.662 - 00:01:37.958, Speaker A: Every bank now, is having to be re underwritten by whoever it is does.
00:01:38.126 - 00:01:59.094, Speaker B: Correct. Right now it's the US government. And so there's this huge moral hazard. Is this what you're supposed to be doing, which is guaranteeing all banks and bank deposits for everyone, including the big guys? Is that what you realistically need to have a fully functioning banking market now?
00:01:59.174 - 00:02:00.806, Speaker A: It's kind of what they've done.
00:02:00.910 - 00:02:54.582, Speaker B: That's kind of what they've done. But it's such an interesting paradox where it's like, okay, you have inflation, you're trying to fight on one hand, and then you have a banking system that really, a bond market that really can't handle the pace and the height of the rate increases that are kind of required to get the inflation down or previously thought. And so it's a very interesting dynamic. And it's like I was talking a couple of weeks ago, I was like we were talking about when the Fed's going to have to undo Qe, sorry, undo quantitative tightening and go the other way. Because we were like, okay, banks can't really buy because when we were talking about weeks ago, banks can't really buy because they've already bought so much in their portfolios and they were underwater on a ton of them. The currency guys, the guys that hedge currencies to buy the bonds, the currency hedging costs were too high. Foreign real money had stopped buying.
00:02:54.582 - 00:03:33.296, Speaker B: And so we were like, okay, where's the marginal buyer treasuries going to come in if the central banks aren't buying anymore? So anyway, it's like there's structural issues in the banking system that are basically telling you your monetary response isn't like, isn't sufficient or is not complete. And so the question is, is the Fed gonna be like, okay, now that they have this facility and they've taken over a couple of the problematic banks and the other banks figure it out, either they get bought or use the facility or whatever it may be, is that enough to contain the.
00:03:33.320 - 00:03:44.014, Speaker A: Right. When we get through the immediate crisis, then what do they do? Right. Cause that's what a lot of the street has been even now, again, repricing their expectations on interest rate.
00:03:44.474 - 00:03:45.730, Speaker B: Absolutely. It's more.
00:03:45.842 - 00:04:05.298, Speaker A: Last week Jay Powell was very strict and hawkish in the Senate. A full repricing with even higher and for longer happened right after that. Now since the collapses and the banking issues, it's going the other way. The street is expecting cuts. Cuts or even, you know, even in. The question is for this next meeting, right.
00:04:05.306 - 00:04:06.378, Speaker B: One of the things, higher for shorter.
00:04:06.426 - 00:04:39.086, Speaker A: Higher for shorter or less high for shorter. Essentially, what's the big question on Wall street this week has been what is Jay Powell going to do? What next week exactly? When he, when the Fed announces a rate, whatever their rate decision is. It had been repriced after he spoke last week to like almost certainly 50 bip increase or close to like 80% probability. And now it's like, I mean, g's says no increase. Other banks still say still 50, like just as predictions. And some people, I don't think any.
00:04:39.110 - 00:04:41.158, Speaker B: Banks say 50 anymore briefly.
00:04:41.246 - 00:04:46.806, Speaker A: Some did over the weekend maybe still. But yeah. So now it's like maybe, you know, zero to flat.
00:04:46.870 - 00:04:50.630, Speaker B: Some people are calling for a cut, right. So it's gone the other way.
00:04:50.662 - 00:04:58.434, Speaker A: In your mind, what's not like the prediction necessarily, but like, walk me through the thinking here for the Fed, because there's issues of credibility on the line as well.
00:04:58.734 - 00:05:03.360, Speaker B: Yeah, well, their credibility is going to take a hit no matter what they do.
00:05:03.462 - 00:05:06.588, Speaker A: Because he was hawkish and then the next day the regional banks.
00:05:06.676 - 00:05:36.520, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, but it's also, I mean, he's got access to data and there's, you know, people are talking about this stuff and it's not like the first dollar got pulled like on Thursday or Friday, like you know, people have known about this stuff. And it's also like, you know, the Fed's a bank regulator. The FDIC is a bank regulator. Like, it's clearly a failure by regulators to effectively monitor banks. So it's a really tricky situation.
00:05:36.592 - 00:05:38.088, Speaker A: The credibility issue already is reported.
00:05:38.216 - 00:05:55.396, Speaker B: It is. But for him, it's like he's got his mandates, the written ones and the unwritten ones, the written ones of full employment and price stability. And there's actually a weird third one. But his other one that is also super important is financial stability. That's not explicitly in his mandate.
00:05:55.520 - 00:05:56.812, Speaker A: But obviously it matters.
00:05:56.908 - 00:06:29.084, Speaker B: Obviously it matters. And to be honest, it might trump the others besides employment, to be honest. But financial stability, people need to have faith and confidence in the system, in the system, in the market. And so if he genuinely thinks that's at risk here, then I think he's got a pause and there's a genuine risk. I mean, our CEO said this morning, it's like, if you're in any banking institution that isn't a US systemically important bank, a GSIB, like, what are you doing with your money?
00:06:29.984 - 00:06:38.696, Speaker A: There's been huge flows out of smaller banks into every person was calling, moving their money to the biggest bank they have access to. What we saw.
00:06:38.880 - 00:06:47.256, Speaker B: It's what you have to do. There's really no option. I get it. The Fed's got a facility to do this, but again, they're only backstopping deposits. Yeah.
00:06:47.280 - 00:06:54.218, Speaker A: You don't know how, theoretically, if that would always be there. So the whole idea is you want to be in a too big to fail bankruptcy.
00:06:54.336 - 00:07:06.014, Speaker B: Correct. And at this point, if you have money in an institution that isn't a too big to fail bank, you're just taking career risk. Like unnecessary.
00:07:06.094 - 00:07:21.164, Speaker A: Like, yeah, which is which. But the Fed, I mean, with this backstop, with this facility, they are trying to signal the opposite of that. They're trying to say, we're covering. You're safe. Well, here's the president said on Monday.
00:07:21.204 - 00:07:44.436, Speaker B: Morning, effectively, though, it's like they're lending versus loans and assets. Right. And they're lending you more money than those things are worth because they're taking it at par. But again, it doesn't stem the fact that equity holders and bondholders of these institutions that have to use the facility that ultimately fail, those are going to get wiped out. They fail.
00:07:44.460 - 00:07:44.884, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:45.004 - 00:07:51.736, Speaker B: And it's also. It's a market confidence thing. It is. It's like these guys couldn't do banking 101.
00:07:51.840 - 00:07:52.524, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:52.944 - 00:07:56.472, Speaker B: So, like, why would you put money in guys that don't do banking 101.
00:07:56.488 - 00:07:58.384, Speaker A: Or they say like, raise until you break, raise until something.
00:07:58.424 - 00:07:59.000, Speaker B: Raise until you break.
00:07:59.032 - 00:08:03.848, Speaker A: But this is something, you've been saying this though. Yeah. There are unintended things, consequences while it looks.
00:08:03.976 - 00:08:20.762, Speaker B: We were saying, I mean, dude, Thorne, we have literally talked about how the bank balance sheets are insolvent, right. Like on this podcast, we, like weeks ago we were like, they've been buying these things and they have to pay out, you know, really high rates on deposits, you know.
00:08:20.818 - 00:08:22.514, Speaker A: Yeah. Structural issue here.
00:08:22.554 - 00:08:38.410, Speaker B: Structural issue. And we've been talking about it in the context of the Fed's balance sheet as well as, you know, other, other banks. But, you know, it's pretty obvious. And that's why we've been in the camp of like, you know, eventually, you know, they're going to have to slow down. QT is going to have to, you know, roll off. So what do you think?
00:08:38.442 - 00:08:44.564, Speaker A: Like, just, I mean, I guess, why not? You know, everyone on the street is trying to make a prediction here. What do you think a dovish hike of 25 is that most likely?
00:08:44.714 - 00:08:46.480, Speaker B: If I was them, I wouldn't hike at all.
00:08:46.512 - 00:08:47.072, Speaker A: You'd pause?
00:08:47.128 - 00:08:56.616, Speaker B: I'd pause. It's a big deal and I just wait and see. Just buy time. The inflation data, we just went through a really strong patch of hot data.
00:08:56.680 - 00:08:58.008, Speaker A: We had CPI yesterday.
00:08:58.136 - 00:09:44.920, Speaker B: CPI was relatively unchanged, right? Yeah, it was an okay number. Nobody was really focused on it. We had PPI today that also came in retail sales as well that were more mixed. But we know the structural stories in the back half of the year suggest a slowing us consumer as a function of one, higher interest rates ballooning, car payments, the reintroduction of student loan payments, federal government student loans, and also just the savings base getting dwindled down in terms of people spending more than they save and that just catching up to them over time, the longer that goes. And then credit card balances have been rising at these high interest rates. That's going to eat into spending, et cetera.
00:09:44.992 - 00:09:46.200, Speaker A: So there's reasons.
00:09:46.392 - 00:10:34.936, Speaker B: And you also had like weird, like January seasonal effects and like, you know, adjustments to the data and stuff over the past couple months. And, you know, one time, you know, Social Security recipients got a raise recently. That was a huge one time raise. Well, it's not one time, but again, it's like one of those things that made the data, you know, kind of seem artificially high in my view. At least there's lots of things that the Fed can look at and be encouraged by and that would warrant pausing of interest rate hikes. But the question now is, will they deliver on kind of the path that the market is suggesting? Which is way more cuts over the next twelve to 18 months.
00:10:35.080 - 00:10:38.624, Speaker A: We'll wait and find out. Bimnet Abibi, our friend from galaxy trading. Thanks so much.
