00:00:08.774 - 00:00:09.366, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:09.510 - 00:00:18.462, Speaker A: But fundamentally and philosophically, I just have just such a huge, huge, I don't know, discontent. They say.
00:00:18.558 - 00:00:45.704, Speaker B: What's the alternative? As you've said, and right now, there's not really one. But the thing is, whether or not it's bitcoin or not, every empire has thought it would last forever or tried to make it last forever. Right? But yet every single empire in human history has collapsed. Right. Like, and so it's it's inevitable. I mean, it is inevitable now, whether we can hang on to this parlor game for 300 more years, who knows? But, like, I mean, it will come to an end.
