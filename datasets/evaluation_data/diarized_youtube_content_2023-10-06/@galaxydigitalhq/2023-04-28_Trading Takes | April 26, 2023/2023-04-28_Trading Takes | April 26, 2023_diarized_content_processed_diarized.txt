00:00:07.440 - 00:00:11.710, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, my friend, great to see you.
00:00:11.782 - 00:00:13.754, Speaker B: Thanks for having me. How you doing?
00:00:14.694 - 00:00:25.620, Speaker A: I'm good. I'm in Texas. I'm in Austin, Texas. You are not in the office either. So this is one of our rare remote meetings. But it's good to see you. I like those glasses.
00:00:25.702 - 00:00:31.864, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you so much. A little under the weather right now. I'm sure you guys can hear, so.
00:00:32.024 - 00:00:46.896, Speaker A: But we never miss our quick update with Bim. Net. And just for our listeners, some of the rest of this episode was previously recorded. That's why you'll see me in the studio with our guest Nick Hanson after this segment. But Bim, let's get into it. It's, you know, we're recording. It's Wednesday, April 26.
00:00:46.896 - 00:01:05.174, Speaker A: A couple things to bring up. The one that struck me the most was waking up this morning and seeing bitcoin basically regaining 30k. You know, it's trading slightly below 29 eight. No block clock behind me to show it right now, but it's a significant move up from where we were in the low 27s. What's going on in markets today?
00:01:05.334 - 00:02:08.594, Speaker B: Yeah, a lot of market volatility has recently been driven by concerns surrounding a regional bank, one in particular, First Republic. They had reported quarterly earnings earlier this week, and it showed that they had lost about $100 billion in deposits at their peak. I believe they were a $200 billion deposit institution and I think roughly a $40 billion market cap institution. And now since the earnings, we've seen their stock pretty much collapse to roughly a 1 billion market cap. And that's all around the idea that there is really no bailout coming or headlines about whether or not there is a bailout coming or there isn't. There was a headline out earlier this morning saying that the government doesn't want to intervene in this situation. And so it's basically going to be up to the market to kind of figure out what they're going to do with this institution.
00:02:08.594 - 00:02:28.772, Speaker B: And as a reminder to folks, this is an institution that basically has made a ton of long, has a lot of long duration assets on its balance sheet and a lot of short dated liabilities. And so just a fundamental balance sheet mismanagement situation that, yeah, this is one.
00:02:28.788 - 00:02:47.024, Speaker A: Of those banks that was teetering ever since Silicon Valley bank. Right. I mean, sort of been, they had the injection from the g sibs. They, the big banks. Just what agreed. I'm sure there was some cajoling, but they agreed to deposit $30 billion there to shore up the balance sheet. But it seems like it's been sort of a dead man walking at this point.
00:02:47.514 - 00:04:06.506, Speaker B: Exactly. Now the market is trying to look ahead as to what a potential solution looks like for this bank and what are the implications more broadly for the rest of the regional banks. And the main thing that sticks out in my head is there's an implicit guarantee right now for the main G SiB banks. They are definitely too big to fail. And if you go back to what Secretary Yellen and other folks were saying right around the time of Silicon Valley, and signature depositors are generally safe. And so the question is like, how should somebody with large pools of money be thinking about where to park their assets? Are regional banks safe, or is there a guarantee above the 250k number that the FDIC has provided, et cetera? And so more and more, the conclusion that we've come to here is that you're kind of setting up a situation where essentially all depositors are guaranteed and you're going to essentially move to a marketplace for deposits that's incredibly competitive. And you're going to have a situation where credit is going to meaningfully tighten because one just think about First Republic bank.
00:04:06.506 - 00:05:30.770, Speaker B: They are going to have to offload $100 billion worth of long duration assets into the marketplace. And so some bank or some institution has to buy those assets. And so when you have assets that are going to maybe trade at a discount, et cetera, what's your real incentive to go extend credit when there's all these distressed sales of banks and bank assets, et cetera? And you know, you're just going to be losing reserves over time as TGA balances pick up, as Qt sort of moves forward 100 billion per month, et cetera, you're going to be losing deposits over time as well. So there's really a very dynamic set of circumstances that are at play here with the banking system. And the market yesterday got very worried about sort of a left tail scenario where you have banking stresses combined with souring economic data combined with a Fed that is most likely going to hike on May 3 and basically a week from now. And so what you had happened was a huge rally in front end duration, and you actually saw may meeting pricing move down a lot, but you had certain parts of the US front end curve moving by 30 basis points. You had gold breaking through two k as folks got concerned.
00:05:30.770 - 00:06:26.474, Speaker B: And so there's a flight to, to quality. And that helped bitcoin a little bit because it was able to recapture the story that had driven so much of the performance this year, which is a failing banking system. The move from twenty k to twenty eight k in bitcoin was largely off the back of Silicon Valley Bank's failure and the apparentness of the need for bitcoin. In moments like those, you had a little bit of that narrative come back into the market when you were in technically oversold conditions, I would say. There was a large binance twap seller last week that had artificially depressed prices. You were at support around 27k in bitcoin. The move higher happened in a low liquidity window, which is us afternoon session.
00:06:26.474 - 00:07:03.378, Speaker B: And so you had liquidations, a little bit of a short gamma squeeze. You had actual buyers come in because of a change in the narrative. And all of a sudden, bitcoin goes from 27,300 to 30,000 in the span of 12 hours. And so it's a pretty dramatic move. I didn't anticipate a move of this magnitude. I did think that another bank potentially failing, or rumors around another potential failure was going to help bitcoin. But the magnitude of this move has definitely caught me a little bit off guard.
00:07:03.378 - 00:07:04.730, Speaker B: It's just so quick.
00:07:04.802 - 00:07:36.634, Speaker A: Yeah, I was taken aback a little bit, too, when, like I said, I woke up this morning, too, and it really had started to pump all the way to 30k. But look, I guess the corn is going to do what it's going to do. The only other thing I'd mention is, you know, pretty impressive to see bitcoin still leading this rally, which is what it did, particularly post Shanghai. Kind of felt like March was the banking narrative, but. And then April came Shanghai for Ethan. You'd think ETH would then be in the driver's seat, but I guess maybe, like you're saying, the banking narrative here is playing a factor still. People are still.
00:07:36.634 - 00:07:51.926, Speaker A: Argentina, central bank appear to have plundered retail bank accounts in order to get dollars. I feel like that was almost a little bit of a Cyprus moment, a bail in moment that also felt like a bitcoin kind of buoyant narrative. But things are looking pretty strong.
00:07:52.030 - 00:08:30.026, Speaker B: No, absolutely. I mean, the stories and the cases for bitcoin are all around us. And I think folks in the west, it's become more apparent recently because you had historically stable institutions failing, so it became more apparent for somebody in Em. Like, bitcoin is a story that plays every day. Hyperinflation is an issue that is present every day. Capital controls and people's dollar bank accounts not having access to them, or awful exchange rates. That's a story that plays every day in em.
00:08:30.026 - 00:09:13.192, Speaker B: And so I think getting the focus of the US is super important to driving it, but it's not necessary. And a lot of what you saw earlier this year was a bitcoin rally that was driven by largely non us folks, if you just looked at the performance of bitcoin in certain regions. And so I try to take a step back and try to think critically about what are the global forces shaping bitcoin, and there are just so many each and every day. So that's why I'm still constructive on it. Technically speaking. It is respecting trends like unbelievably well. Like bitcoin had 110 percent drawdown and it got bought.
00:09:13.192 - 00:09:57.778, Speaker B: And now you're back at it's been setting higher highs and higher lows. It's an asset that is clearly trending. The dollar de dollarization story is not going away anytime soon. I mean, there are headlines literally every day about BRICS and new nations trying to join Russia, China, trade developments, gold gaining more prominence. There are these constructive developments literally every day. I think that's why you're seeing this asset trend really well. The last thing I'll leave you guys with, I think the story of adoption, really, in terms of when it kicks into the next gears, is once you get major institutional adoption again, or at least once you start to see more money flowing in.
00:09:57.778 - 00:10:42.256, Speaker B: Today, the CME CEO was on CNBC talking about bitcoin, CME volumes and ETH volumes, etcetera. And the one thing he noted and wanted to stress about his crypto products was that the large versions of his crypto products are the ones that are doing the best in terms of the ones that are picking up the most traction. He's saying there's a bifurcation between retail and institutional, and he's seeing institutional grow more and more. When he went out to London recently, he said the amount of activity and the buzz around it was super compelling. It as a product he's going to perpetually, essentially be offering. And so I think there's just all sorts of constructive stories at play. And yeah, it's an asset that's trending higher.
00:10:42.320 - 00:10:45.584, Speaker A: Bibnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, my friend, thank you so much.
