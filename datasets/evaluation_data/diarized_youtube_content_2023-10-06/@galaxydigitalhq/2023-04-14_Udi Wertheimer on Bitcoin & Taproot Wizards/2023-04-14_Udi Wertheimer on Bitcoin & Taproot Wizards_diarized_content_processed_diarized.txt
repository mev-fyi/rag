00:01:17.420 - 00:01:21.084, Speaker A: We'll also check in with our good friend Bimnet Afibi from Galaxy trading, as.
00:01:21.124 - 00:01:23.144, Speaker B: Always, to discuss markets and macro.
00:01:23.604 - 00:01:25.492, Speaker A: But before we get into all of that, I need to remind you to.

00:01:41.900 - 00:01:45.004, Speaker B: Of BB from Galaxy Trading. As always, my friend, great to see you.
00:01:45.084 - 00:01:46.204, Speaker D: Thanks for having me.
00:01:46.324 - 00:01:49.516, Speaker B: It's a fun week, I would say. I mean, you had.
00:01:49.540 - 00:01:57.020, Speaker D: It's been a fun year. I mean, what a year. We started at 16k. We're at 30,450 right now. Let's go.
00:01:57.092 - 00:02:00.076, Speaker A: Yeah, I think Mike was on CNBC.
00:02:00.140 - 00:02:21.132, Speaker B: Earlier this week, and Joe Kiernan was like, look, Mike, you said last year that 30k you thought would be the strong support. And Mike was like, I was wrong, but actually, like, you know, from 30k down to 16 five, it was really inorganic for selling due to all of those blow ups, right? So I feel like back at 30, I'm not saying it should, you know that it feels right, like it doesn't.
00:02:21.188 - 00:02:22.244, Speaker D: I mean, it feels low.
00:02:22.284 - 00:02:28.900, Speaker B: We're more than 50% off all time high. Still, it's clearly a bear market, but this feels like a fairer price for bitcoin right now.
00:02:28.932 - 00:02:50.058, Speaker D: It is a fairer price and it's a price that's gotten achieved without that much leverage. Right. This is an ecosystem and an asset class that's been completely delevered. There's much less like OTC lending. There's no crazy FTX perp market. And so credit has really tightened. And so this is really like organic spot driven.
00:02:50.058 - 00:03:18.120, Speaker D: And the other thing to think about, it's bitcoin led as well. Obviously this year, this year ETH is having a little bit of a moment. Now, we can get into that a little bit later. Bitcoin outperforming because it's got a story. And going back to that interview, the theme is pretty clear. Dollar is selling off because the Fed is going to be eventually cutting or the hikes are stopping. You're getting a negative dollar story in the market.
00:03:18.120 - 00:03:53.084, Speaker D: Euro dollar is taking out 110 new highs, gold through two k and is sustaining it. Now we're at new trend highs this morning. The story is there, the chart is there, it's organic, you're getting technical breakouts. And then on top of that, you've got a wonderful community in ETH that's continuing to push development. And you had an awesome upgrade go through last night, and now ETH is through two k. And so lots of things pointing up. I would say the risk to all of this was highlighted yesterday in the CPI report.
00:03:53.084 - 00:04:17.874, Speaker D: We did see reasonable strength in core CPI even though we had a little miss in headline. But there's still remarkable strength in services pricing and inflation, basically correct? Yeah, but we see the writing on the wall. But it's just tough to be like we're going to eventually cut rates. But your core CPI is still above 5%. You're targeting two.
00:04:18.934 - 00:04:53.444, Speaker B: I saw that some people are saying, some economists and Wall street folks are saying, and I think you've said this before too, that they'll have to cut before they get to their 2% target, that they won't get to 2%. What does that mean? Will they? And also is that if that's true, if that happens, that's a game changer for the way people think about central banks managing inflation. If they, if basically we have to accept longer term inflation, even if it eventually gets back down there, they'll have ended their, their policy maneuvers before reaching their target.
00:04:54.504 - 00:04:55.368, Speaker D: I mean, do you think we'll be.
00:04:55.376 - 00:05:00.168, Speaker B: Down to 2% by the time that the street thinks they might cut at the end of the year?
00:05:00.336 - 00:05:40.644, Speaker D: No, no, probably not. But they look favorably upon data that suggests that we're not accelerating again and that we're clearly moving lower. But I think what you're really hitting on is, what is this 2% inflation target, and is it really something that we should just be sticking to as like, that's the rule of thumb. That's the target. That's how the market's going to operate. And if you talk to economists, they'll be like, well, that 2% inflation targeting has generally worked pretty well, and there's a whole ton of data that supports it. But again, times are different now.
00:05:40.644 - 00:06:20.712, Speaker D: And so it's a very interesting debate. The other issue is that you can't just communicate for decades that your inflation, trying to target 2% inflation and then suddenly switch. You have a huge credibility issue if you're going to change your stance. My understanding of where things stand right now in terms of fed and folks that think about inflation targeting, et cetera, is that because of that credibility issue, it's going to be basically impossible for them to outwardly communicate that they are okay with. So they'll always be targeting a higher level than 2%.
00:06:20.768 - 00:06:24.296, Speaker B: They'll just be calling for 2% the whole time, even if they can't raise rates.
00:06:24.320 - 00:07:03.842, Speaker D: So they'll phrase it differently. Like when we were on the way up and Yellen was, you know, fed secretary, like, they, like inflation averaging was how they talked about it. They want inflation to average around 2%. So, you know, it can go above and below. And so it's a moving goalpost. And realistically, like, what the Fed's trying to do is trying to have a set of, like, financial conditions that doesn't harm the economy too much, but doesn't help the economy too much either. Like, not too hot, not too cold with people having jobs and without, like, financial stress in the system where people are like, oh, do I trust my banks? Right, right.
00:07:03.842 - 00:08:00.726, Speaker D: Do I trust, you know, like, the FDIC to ensure my balances? And so they have a handful of jobs, and I think they're doing okay now. But in theory, if you take a step back, where are we? Inflation is not skyrocketing right now. It's high. It's definitely hurting people because on average, the inflation impacts lower income people a lot more, shelters a higher portion of their expenses, all that stuff. So it's definitely still impacting people, but those people still have jobs, and the federal government is still spending trillions of dollars a year, food stamps, federal assistance, freezing, student loans, etcetera. So there's support for lots of people via the employment market, via social transfers, et cetera. And then there's generally financial stability, like stocks are, Nasdaq's up like 15% on the year.
00:08:00.726 - 00:08:07.578, Speaker D: Home prices haven't really collapsed that much. So generally speaking, things look okay.
00:08:07.706 - 00:08:08.346, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:08.490 - 00:08:10.706, Speaker D: And like, and like, wait.
00:08:10.890 - 00:08:31.754, Speaker B: Yeah, it's pretty wild. Let's talk about ETH a little bit in ETH BTC. So you referenced that the. So we're recording on Thursday, April 13, last night, on Wednesday, April 12, around 06:30 p.m. At 06:30 p.m., eastern, Ethereum upgraded to both Shanghai and Capella. But basically it's referred to as shanghai.
00:08:31.754 - 00:08:34.470, Speaker B: It's because now they have consensus layer and an execution layer.
00:08:34.502 - 00:08:34.830, Speaker E: Yes.
00:08:34.902 - 00:08:58.878, Speaker B: But basically this one upgrade, which was primarily to enable unstaking of staked ETH. Right. The completion of the merge. Right. And it was a success, it appears. And there's been a lot of talk about, and there was a lot of speculation by folks leading into the event that would this create a supply shock sell side selling. Right.
00:08:58.878 - 00:09:16.812, Speaker B: All these people have been locked up for three years. Like, maybe they're going to unstake and then sell. We aren't really seeing that. Certainly on a net basis. It looks actually like more people are even depositing now into the staking contract than withdrawing. ETH went through two k on the news. ETH BTC is up.
00:09:16.812 - 00:09:24.508, Speaker B: Bitcoin's up, too. But the last couple, last 24 hours, or I guess 12 hours or so has been an ETH led move.
00:09:24.596 - 00:09:25.464, Speaker D: Absolutely.
00:09:25.804 - 00:09:28.304, Speaker B: Where do we see this going? What are your thoughts on that?
00:09:30.734 - 00:09:57.144, Speaker D: In the camp of one, you have to respect the trend. Clearly, bitcoin and Ethereum are trending. They're trending higher. It's organic, and it's one of those self fulfilling things where it's like Mike said it best yesterday. Basically, when stuff's going up, the adoption cycle actually accelerates. You have two assets that are trending higher. Right.
00:09:57.144 - 00:10:23.144, Speaker D: Then you have technical things. Right? Thirty k. Two k. These are huge psychological levels. Typically when you seen these kind of big levels go, there's normally meaningful follow through. So I'm still generally in the camp that these assets are trending. You're meant to buy dips, and if you see breaks through resistance, you're likely going to get follow through.
00:10:23.144 - 00:10:29.176, Speaker D: Third, I mean, technically speaking, you just have to follow, like, are people depositing more ETH?
00:10:29.240 - 00:10:29.752, Speaker B: Right.
00:10:29.888 - 00:11:05.934, Speaker D: It is now proof of stake network. And I think there's going to be a lot more ETH deposited over time. And clearly the value accrual and how people think about value accrual, like in crypto and in defi, et cetera, is changing. Like ETH is outperforming most of the alts, right? Bitcoin's been outperforming like most of the alts. And so it's clearly becoming very ETH and BTC centric in crypto and less so about random Defi tokens. Other l one s, like ETH has clearly established itself as the preeminent smart contract platform, right.
00:11:05.974 - 00:11:18.282, Speaker B: Especially throughout all these l two s and the development happening there. It's sort of like, why do we need all l one block space if you can go to l two? I'm not saying that's the only way of thinking about it, but I think the market is really sort of looking at it that way right now.
00:11:18.398 - 00:11:18.914, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:11:18.954 - 00:12:13.698, Speaker D: And so I'm constructive on both, but personally I'm still in the bitcoin camp. And I think the fiat debasement narrative has a lot more room to run. And the most important thing happening in markets is the sea shift in monetary policy that the market is starting to sniff out. It's a big deal to go from, we're worried about six 7% interest rates to when is the Fed cutting? You've just had a huge transition. And then you have all of these, these other sort of factors which are super interesting. They're always around, but the geopolitical stuff like Russia and Saudi Arabia cooperating on oil, macron being like, hey, if China and Taiwan happen, I'm gonna pick my own lane. There's so many interesting other narratives that aren't really dollar supportive happening.
00:12:13.698 - 00:13:12.754, Speaker D: That's the sea change that I'm paying most attention to. And it has the best sort of follow through into bitcoin in my eyes. But at some point there is an inflection point with respect to the adoption cycle in bitcoin, where the institutions that are going to come in and the size precipitates bigger institutions and more size. And it gets to a point where it's nonlinear and gets convex totally. And I think you kind of had that well, you need regulation to eventually get there, like at least in the US. But ultimately, I think the world of asset managers, risk takers, pensioners, anybody that manages money, if bitcoin gets through, like 40k or 50k. Again, the fomo that will take place amongst institutions, I think is going to be pretty intense.
00:13:12.754 - 00:13:59.164, Speaker D: What crypto is really after, or at least why I like crypto, is it still hasn't captured nearly a fraction of the wealth in the world and of the global assets, even the attention span, et cetera. And once you really start getting 1.2 basis points of huge, huge multi billion dollar, trillion dollar portfolio, that's when this asset class takes off. And so where does it take off? It's going to take off in the large capacity size thing. And so bitcoin is going to be the first thing to go and like, higher beta stuff like ETH might follow and you might outperform. But really, to get that, like, insane, like, inflection as an asset class, you have to draw in, like, huge, huge pools of money. And the best way to do that is to get big.
00:13:59.244 - 00:14:00.252, Speaker B: Yeah, right.
00:14:00.308 - 00:14:10.036, Speaker D: Like it's a size thing. Like, if you're a big company, a lot more companies can look to invest in you, right? Just talking equity, much more.
00:14:10.060 - 00:14:11.020, Speaker B: Liquidity. Much more.
00:14:11.052 - 00:14:11.768, Speaker E: Exactly.
00:14:11.956 - 00:15:02.784, Speaker D: And that was the whole idea about one of these things, like the FTX perp market. One of the reasons why alts got so big was because of the liquidity. The idea that I'm a hedge fund somewhere, a risk manager or some offshore guy, and I've got capital, and I want to invest in alts. If I can get in and out quickly, if I can hedge that risk, if I can earn the forward interest rates or hedge my staking yield, somehow the ability to do those things makes people more comfortable in that asset class drives adoption, buying, so on and so forth. And so being big liquid only helps you get bigger and more liquid, which then becomes self fulfilling. And then you think about it other ways. It's like, okay, when things get bigger, what happens? Volume comes down because they're dip.
00:15:02.784 - 00:15:16.850, Speaker D: Buyers and institutions dip buy and volume down. That means you can hold more of the position. And so it's like, as you get bigger volume down, more people enter, and then it gets self filling. So there is an inflection point somewhere. Do I know where that is?
00:15:16.882 - 00:15:17.454, Speaker C: No.
00:15:18.634 - 00:15:46.174, Speaker D: Am I getting a sense on when that timing is. Yes, that timing. In my head, I'm thinking you're looking at the having, having the end of the fed cycle, really, Europe not worrying about inflation. There's a lot of variables. But I take my readings from the market, and right now it's the world's best performing asset class, risk adjusted outright and tough not to be looking at it.
00:15:46.334 - 00:15:54.446, Speaker B: Bimnet abibi from Galaxy trading. My friend, as always, thank you for joining us. Let's go now to our guest, Udi Wertheimer, taproot wizard number one.
00:15:54.550 - 00:15:55.126, Speaker C: That's me.
00:15:55.190 - 00:15:56.246, Speaker B: Welcome to New York, my friend.
00:15:56.310 - 00:15:57.062, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah.
00:15:57.118 - 00:16:00.934, Speaker C: I. I'm on vacation now, so I only wear the hat, not the full.
00:16:00.974 - 00:16:06.206, Speaker B: Suit, but, yeah, so, yeah, when you're. So you're saying your work outfit is the full wizard garb.
00:16:06.270 - 00:16:07.286, Speaker C: Exactly, yeah, yeah.
00:16:07.350 - 00:16:10.214, Speaker B: So now you're just the hat and the glasses. But the glasses, I mean, that's part.
00:16:10.214 - 00:16:12.568, Speaker C: Of the glasses are part of the. Yeah, that's official.
00:16:12.656 - 00:16:14.568, Speaker B: Do you wear the glasses with the wizard outfit?
00:16:14.696 - 00:16:15.360, Speaker C: No, absolutely.
00:16:15.392 - 00:16:15.964, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:16:16.544 - 00:16:32.376, Speaker C: It's actually interesting. You know, we had this. We had this wizard shower quest when we asked people to take showers on video with a wizard costume, and a lot of them did it with sunglasses. That was not part of the specifications, but yeah.
00:16:32.480 - 00:16:32.736, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:16:32.760 - 00:16:36.248, Speaker B: Well, they're playing into your long time sunglasses avatar.
00:16:36.336 - 00:16:36.720, Speaker E: Yes.
00:16:36.792 - 00:16:41.320, Speaker B: Which is. I guess you're in real life here with Aman. It's not just an avatar.
00:16:41.432 - 00:16:48.728, Speaker C: Yes. It's. Funny story. That's a photo from, let's see, maybe 20 years ago.
00:16:48.776 - 00:16:48.912, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:16:48.928 - 00:16:53.368, Speaker B: You're in front of a bunch of leaves or something. Bush.
00:16:53.456 - 00:16:54.240, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah.
00:16:54.272 - 00:17:21.360, Speaker C: I think I was in. I think I was visiting Brazil, and it was just. Anyways, you know, later when I was deciding to pick my social media photos, just because social media did not exist before, that's how old I am. So I was looking for my first social media photo, and I was like, man, I don't have selfies. Because that was in a time where people did not take selfies.
00:17:21.392 - 00:17:23.728, Speaker B: It was like a digital camera. Right? Someone took it of you.
00:17:23.856 - 00:17:36.362, Speaker C: So I was like, okay, this is the only photo I have. I'll use this. And it stuck. People are like, wait, why do you have a. I don't. There isn't a reason. But then it caught on, so I just started walking around with sunglasses so that people recognize me.
00:17:36.458 - 00:17:49.106, Speaker B: So for our listeners who don't know Udi, he's a great follow on Twitter, by the way. Give us your background in bitcoin. You've been involved in bitcoin for a long time. I recall you following you for many years at this point.
00:17:49.210 - 00:17:50.218, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah.
00:17:50.346 - 00:17:52.402, Speaker B: How did you get involved in the first place? Or interested?
00:17:52.498 - 00:18:07.734, Speaker C: So, you know, I'm like a software developer by trade in, like, probably ten years ago or whenever it was, I stumbled upon the bitcoin white paper, and then, you know, the usual story of sleepless nights for weeks and.
00:18:09.754 - 00:18:10.162, Speaker E: All of.
00:18:10.178 - 00:18:13.178, Speaker C: Your friends disowning you because you shut up about it.
00:18:13.226 - 00:18:13.386, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:18:13.410 - 00:18:35.784, Speaker C: You won't shut up about it, and they're convinced that you're a criminal. You know, that kind of usual story. And for a while, you know, for a while, I. I was a quiet, shy bitcoiner, which, by the way, I think it's like, the way to go. Like, the kind of. Many of the bitcoin errs I respect the most are the ones who just. Yeah, they, you know, they heard about bitcoin.
00:18:35.784 - 00:18:41.792, Speaker C: They bought a little bit every week, every month, whatever, and they just don't. They live out their lives.
00:18:41.928 - 00:18:43.088, Speaker E: You mean, not like this.
00:18:43.136 - 00:18:45.200, Speaker C: Like we. Like we are, like, I just.
00:18:45.312 - 00:18:45.632, Speaker E: Especially.
00:18:45.688 - 00:18:47.744, Speaker B: They take the time to learn it a bit, too. Right?
00:18:47.784 - 00:18:48.024, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:18:48.064 - 00:18:50.624, Speaker B: Not like I just found out about bitcoin and I'm here to save it.
00:18:50.704 - 00:18:52.416, Speaker E: Yeah. Yeah.
00:18:52.440 - 00:19:25.390, Speaker B: I was a little bit similar. I mean, I think I found out in 2012 about it and then got really interested in 2015 and then started working on it at Fidelity in 2017 or 2016 or 17, and didn't join Twitter until, like, the end of 2017, which was a big no no at Fidelity, by the way. But we just did it anyway. Sorry, fidelity. So you had that sort of normal, that sort of classic story. But how did you become and started to become public about. What was your first foray into public bitcoin world?
00:19:25.542 - 00:20:25.496, Speaker C: Yeah, I made the mistake of combining this personal passion with my professional life, and I joined a bitcoin startup in Tel Aviv probably in 2015 or 16. It was called Colu. Funnily enough, we worked on collared coins back at the time, which is kind of related to the oral stuff that popped up recently that we're going to talk about, probably. But, yeah. So as I started to combine my personal and professional passions together, I started speaking out about bitcoin more, too. And I think that probably. Probably around 2017, with the two big events were the big ico rally and the other was probably the big block size wars in bitcoin.
00:20:25.496 - 00:20:37.636, Speaker C: And I was kind of vocal about both of these. And I think that's how I got this sort of semi popular bitcoin Twitter account over the time. That's probably how it happened.
00:20:37.780 - 00:20:38.092, Speaker E: I think.
00:20:38.108 - 00:20:56.972, Speaker C: At the time, there weren't a lot of people who talked about it, and not a lot of people were skilled enough in analyzing what's going on these days. If I said the basic stuff I used to say back then, today, no one would have even noticed. It was very basic crypto Twitter has.
00:20:56.988 - 00:20:59.676, Speaker B: Gone down the rabbit hole. It's been years at this point.
00:20:59.740 - 00:21:00.980, Speaker C: People are very smart now.
00:21:01.092 - 00:21:01.268, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:21:01.276 - 00:21:03.548, Speaker B: If you say something wrong, you'll find out in about 5 seconds.
00:21:03.596 - 00:21:04.184, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:21:06.374 - 00:21:20.434, Speaker B: Let's talk about. Let's jump forward. We might jump back to. I'd love to ask you about some of the more foundational things you mentioned, the block size wars. We have Johnny Beer's book right behind you. I don't know if the camera can see that, but one of my favorite, maybe my single favorite book, actually, in the crypto space.
00:21:20.974 - 00:21:21.774, Speaker C: It's really good.
00:21:21.854 - 00:21:22.022, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:21:22.038 - 00:21:42.164, Speaker B: It's just great history. If you don't know that history, you should. But let's jump forward. I called you taproot wizard number one. Taproot Wizards is a collection of bitcoin nfts, I'm gonna say, but ordinals on bitcoin. What was your reaction, actually, when Casey Rortimore. Yeah.
00:21:42.164 - 00:21:49.004, Speaker B: Launched ordinals and everyone found out about it. And I guess it was like, I think it's fair to say you probably found out in January or so.
00:21:49.164 - 00:21:49.436, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:21:49.460 - 00:21:52.444, Speaker B: That's really when it started to. People started to realize what had happened.
00:21:52.564 - 00:21:52.908, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:21:52.956 - 00:22:12.104, Speaker C: So I usually fade things, and I definitely faded ordinals, too. I was. I was very skeptical about it. My original thinking was like, okay, this sounds. One, boring. Two, no one's going to care. Three, bitcoin is not a good fit for any of this.
00:22:12.104 - 00:22:45.014, Speaker C: Four, no one's going to care. And I think what changed my mind was when I saw how the bitcoin maximalists were so furious about it. So they were fuming on Twitter, and I was like, wait, what are they even talking about? What is this thing? It doesn't even. Barely even exist, but they seem really mad. And that was so, you know, the first tap of wizard that we inscribed, that was a four megabyte transaction. A four megabyte block. The biggest bitcoin transaction in history.
00:22:45.014 - 00:23:05.852, Speaker C: Kind of made a statement with that one. The point was to kind of, you know, put a big, like, put a big block in front of the bitcoin maximus that they cannot ignore. And that was inscription number 652. Right. We're over a million now. That was.
00:23:05.948 - 00:23:12.308, Speaker B: And it was the magic Internet money meme sort of reimagined with taproot wizards.
00:23:12.356 - 00:23:41.774, Speaker C: Right, right. So it was the, like, in 2013, there was this meme on the bitcoin subreddit that, uh, they used it in order to promote the subreddit. If you think back to 2013, people didn't know what bitcoin was right. Most people, like today, you say bitcoin. Everyone knows at least that it's a thing that exists. But back then, if, if you say bitcoin to someone, either they don't know what it is in most cases or they think you're a criminal. Right.
00:23:41.774 - 00:23:43.102, Speaker C: Those were the only two options.
00:23:43.158 - 00:23:43.446, Speaker B: Right?
00:23:43.510 - 00:24:16.672, Speaker C: So the bitcoin subway was like, okay, we need to like, somehow improve the public image, at least in order to get, like, the only goal was to get more subscribers to the subreddit. That was it. So they did this competition for an ad. They were looking for an ad to advertise the subreddit. And this guy that has this pseudonym, Mavensbot, shows up, draws this wizard, looks like it was made in Microsoft paint. It wasn't, by the way, he told us the story. It wasn't made in Microsoft paint, but it intentionally looks like it was.
00:24:16.672 - 00:24:59.598, Speaker C: And it just says, like, magical in on money, our bitcoin. Join us. That's all it says. And not only did he win the competition and probably like a bunch of bitcoins which were not worthwhile back then, not only did he win that, they put that on the front page of Reddit and it ended up being, at the time, the best performing ad on the entirety of Reddit. And it did wonders for the subreddit. I think it doubled in size very quickly. They say that there was a South park episode that actually was inspired by, or that I keep kicking the mic that has a drawing that is inspired by.
00:24:59.646 - 00:25:04.702, Speaker B: I gotta think about that. I don't recall it, but I haven't watched a lot of South park since like 20, 1516.
00:25:04.758 - 00:25:07.126, Speaker C: Do you remember the Xbox PlayStation wars?
00:25:07.190 - 00:25:07.750, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:25:07.902 - 00:25:11.494, Speaker C: So they pretend to be like Lord of the Rings characters.
00:25:11.574 - 00:25:12.862, Speaker B: Phenomenal episode.
00:25:12.958 - 00:25:17.030, Speaker C: So in one of the, like, that was a multi part episode.
00:25:17.102 - 00:25:21.390, Speaker B: Oh, oh, oh. I think I know the police sketch of them, right? Or whatever.
00:25:21.462 - 00:25:22.406, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:25:22.430 - 00:25:25.430, Speaker C: And they say a police sketch. Or it might not be a police.
00:25:25.462 - 00:25:26.334, Speaker B: Sketch, but a sketch.
00:25:26.414 - 00:25:28.054, Speaker C: Some sketch. Yeah, some sketch.
00:25:28.134 - 00:25:30.854, Speaker B: I remember the kids are missing. The parents are all looking for them.
00:25:31.014 - 00:25:31.494, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:25:31.574 - 00:25:37.206, Speaker C: It shows Cartman in wizard costume and it has like the same call to action and same font, the same.
00:25:37.270 - 00:25:37.902, Speaker B: Interesting.
00:25:37.998 - 00:25:41.262, Speaker C: And it was the same period of time was like a few weeks later.
00:25:41.318 - 00:26:05.782, Speaker B: So it's amazing. So you inscribed inscryption 652, which was the first four megabyte block, you and your taproot wizard friends. And it's a take on that. And then had you already planned on doing this taproot wizards collection when you did that? Or was it sort of like, damn, this is pretty funny and it seems to be getting some traction. Maybe we should take this a step further.
00:26:05.918 - 00:27:03.596, Speaker C: So the evil plan is much worse than that. We actually worked on that for months before, before we even knew about ordinals, we knew that we wanted. I had this theory that as bitcoiners, we have a lot to learn from what happened in the NFT communities in the last couple of years and that we can probably onboard more people to bitcoin if we try to appeal to that crowd. And we were working on a way to have some NFT collection that is somehow connected to bitcoin and bitcoin history. We didn't know, but we didn't have the very important technical piece of how to actually do it. So we had some artwork, we had some ideas around how we're going to engage the community, but we didn't have that very important piece. So we kind of sat on it and waited to see what's going to happen.
00:27:03.596 - 00:27:23.124, Speaker C: And then when all of us showed up and when we saw, going back to how the early reaction I saw, I was like, you know what? This could be a really good fit for this. And so we pulled out all of the plans that we already had and kind of went there.
00:27:24.904 - 00:27:25.416, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:27:25.480 - 00:27:42.350, Speaker C: So the thing though, it was really early. Like, if you, you know, of course, whenever you do something, you never feel like it's early. You always feel like it's late. So we were in inscription 652 and we're like, ah, man, we missed it.
00:27:42.502 - 00:27:43.398, Speaker B: It's too late.
00:27:43.446 - 00:28:10.940, Speaker C: But still, you know, obviously, you look at the whole thing. We're now at the inscription number a million 652 was very early. And that was what was so amazing to me, is such an amazing, it's such an early period, and so very few people were even paying attention to this. And still the bitcoin maxis knew to fume about this when it barely even existed. So that was really a very big signal for us. That was why.
00:28:11.012 - 00:28:27.396, Speaker B: Let's talk about before. There's a lot of places I want to take this conversation. Let's talk about what you learned from the Ethereum Nft community. I've heard you talk about this on other podcasts. What was it about? What is it about? And by the way, you said you fade things. I recall that you faded nfts as well.
00:28:27.460 - 00:28:27.988, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:28:28.076 - 00:28:36.236, Speaker B: At the time. Then you came around. What was it that brought you around to Ethereum's NFT crowd? And then what did you learn from it that you wanted to bring to bitcoin.
00:28:36.340 - 00:28:36.764, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:28:36.844 - 00:28:43.188, Speaker C: So if we think back, like, nfts existed on bitcoin first, probably, like, I don't know, 20 1415.
00:28:43.236 - 00:28:55.876, Speaker B: Yeah, I forget there was. We have this in one of our. I think in the ordinals report that we put out, there was, like, a first one. It was quite a while ago. But then, of course, you have counterparty and stuff and rare pepes, which are still around.
00:28:55.940 - 00:28:56.216, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:28:56.260 - 00:29:00.920, Speaker B: In fact, I believe there's a rare pepe thing being auctioned at pub key this week in New York.
00:29:00.992 - 00:29:02.504, Speaker E: Yeah, that's cool. Yeah.
00:29:02.624 - 00:29:04.408, Speaker B: But, yeah, so start, you know, started.
00:29:04.456 - 00:29:38.244, Speaker C: On bitcoin, and I faded them back then, you know, ten years ago, I faded them and I went, you know, when crypto punk started, I was like, that's like, that's what, 2017. I remember. I vividly recall thinking they're dumb when they were free. Right. And, you know, 2021, 2022, when the real, like, mainstream interests started coming into. I was still fighting them for a while. I think it was only last year in 2022 when I was finally like, you know what? Possibly I was wrong about this.
00:29:38.904 - 00:29:39.472, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:29:39.568 - 00:30:18.484, Speaker C: And I think it was two things that really kind of caught my attention. Like, I'm not, you know, I don't think I'm ever gonna be, like, a big nft collector myself. Don't think I have that skill. But I can really see the kind of passion that people have for this stuff, and that's really important that matters. And with bitcoin, I've spent, what, like, a decade trying to onboard pretty much every single person I ever talked to to bitcoin. Right. And my success rate has been not bad.
00:30:18.484 - 00:30:33.556, Speaker C: Probably, like, around 5% of the. Of the people I talk to, because most people don't care. Right. Like, you can't force someone to care about bitcoin. Most people do not sit around thinking about monetary policies all day. That's just not, you know, not their first priority.
00:30:33.580 - 00:30:35.076, Speaker B: It's pretty nerdy to do that.
00:30:35.140 - 00:30:36.268, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:30:36.316 - 00:31:32.188, Speaker C: So it's not a very cool thing. It's not like when you start that conversation, it's not a conversation people want to have. It's very uncomfortable, you know, so most people, we forget that in crypto because we're all in crypto, so we forget that normal people have, you know, actual lives, and they're not insane like we are. So, you know, it's not a comfortable topic for most people. However, what I kind of realized is, well, we can transfer a lot of those values that we care about. Like, you know, self sovereignty, decentralization, self custody to this new generation of people who never cared about monetary policy, maybe, and maybe not about smart contract tech, but they care about culture, they care about art, they care about community, they care about all those things. And that's kind of a way, that's kind of a gateway drug, I think, into those things we care about.
00:31:32.188 - 00:31:42.984, Speaker C: And we end up with. We can, I think, end up in a similar place where, okay, maybe we didn't sell them on bitcoin specifically, but we sold them on the values, or at least some of them.
00:31:43.724 - 00:32:28.046, Speaker B: Yeah, the ethereum NFT community is, I mean, they're largely non custodial. Right? I mean, they're. Yeah, now the poor, I think you had a great threat, actually. Maybe it was even like at this point, maybe six months ago, explaining to NFT holders and users how to do like, self custody safely because they tend to get rugged a lot, because they're the sort of function of NFT ecosystem involvement requires a lot of times that you keep them in a hot wallet, like in your metamask. You can't join a token gated community with like a. You can, but like, it's much easier than pulling out your ledger or your Trezor hardware wallet to just like keep it at metamask. And then that opens up a bunch of victors.
00:32:28.046 - 00:32:42.474, Speaker B: But nonetheless, right. I mean, NFTs are non custodial almost entirely. Right. And I think you made the point that they may have brought more total people in absolute terms, to self custody than bitcoin has.
00:32:43.184 - 00:33:08.248, Speaker C: I think definitely in the last two years. I think almost certainly they have maybe not in the entire history of bitcoin, but in the last bull run, I'm almost certain you look at numbers of users of metamask and Coinbase wallet and trust wallet, and these ones are way, way bigger than any of the bitcoin self custody ones. Way like orders of magnitude bigger.
00:33:08.296 - 00:33:13.784, Speaker B: Metamask is well over 10 million wallets. I mean, I forget, I think that number is even stale. 20.
00:33:13.864 - 00:33:30.640, Speaker C: Yeah, I think they talked about having 30 million in the, you know, kind of the pick of the bull. And I think that Coinbase and trustwallet, which is the binance one, have similar numbers. And those are not people who are using this with bitcoin.
00:33:30.672 - 00:33:30.816, Speaker B: Right?
00:33:30.840 - 00:33:47.132, Speaker C: Those are people are actively, either they used it with DeFi or with NFT stuff because both of those kind of require you to have a self custody wallet. Well, bitcoin doesn't require you. I think a lot of people go to the exchange, or they buy some and that's it. That's where the.
00:33:47.188 - 00:34:13.488, Speaker B: In fact, a lot of the exchanges, I think maybe binance does now and some are starting to. But I know also on the custodianship side, on the institutional custody side, most don't support nfTs. And I think one of the reasons I was told once was that they all use omnibus cold storage, right. Like hot wallet, then you sweep it all in. But like, that basically only works for fungible tokens. Right.
00:34:13.536 - 00:34:13.744, Speaker E: So.
00:34:13.784 - 00:34:38.472, Speaker B: Cause in some cases you could pay more for a custom vault, like if a sub account or something. But for NFTs basically requires that. Cause you can't just like pay me out whatever bitcoin I put in. Like in bitcoin volume terms, you've got to give me the NFT that I put in. And they're woefully behind on that. So you can't really store. I don't think you can maybe in Coinbase wallet now, which is their non custodial wallet.
00:34:38.528 - 00:34:39.296, Speaker E: Yeah, exactly.
00:34:39.360 - 00:34:41.160, Speaker B: But not on coinbase.com dot.
00:34:41.272 - 00:34:42.004, Speaker E: Exactly.
00:34:42.464 - 00:34:43.764, Speaker B: Which is interesting.
00:34:44.184 - 00:34:44.896, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:34:45.040 - 00:34:52.044, Speaker C: The dynamics of it are very different. So it kind of really drives people to self custody.
00:34:52.504 - 00:35:07.044, Speaker B: So you talk about spending a lot of time, like, all of us who've been in the space have, trying to promote bitcoin and explain its benefits and help people on board. How do you view ordinals now as adding to that picture?
00:35:08.304 - 00:35:50.290, Speaker C: You know, it's really interesting, and that's something that took me a while to understand because the first thing I thought was, okay, that's NFts on bitcoin. That's just, you know, okay, they found a way to do like a token scheme, and they put, like, whatever. It's just. They just copied whatever they did on Ethereum. And actually, it's entirely not that at all. So, inscriptions, I feel like they kind of inherit some features of bitcoin, the important ones. So one is immutability, right? So when you have this jpeg on, like this inscription on ordinals, you cannot, like, the creator can loses all control.
00:35:50.290 - 00:35:52.894, Speaker C: You cannot change the inscription itself.
00:35:55.354 - 00:35:55.642, Speaker E: You.
00:35:55.658 - 00:36:27.976, Speaker C: Cannot change the way that people are allowed to transfer them. So on Ethereum, a lot of NFTs have been experimenting with sort of white lists and blacklists of how you can transfer the actual NFT, which marketplaces are allowed or not allowed to trade it. Those are kind of experiments that players on Ethereum do all the time. I'm not saying it's wrong, it's just not very bitcoin like. So in bitcoin inscriptions, once they're done, they're done. No one's going to change anything on you. It is what it is.
00:36:27.976 - 00:37:09.340, Speaker C: You own it. It's yours, it's over. And some creators might not like that, but for the holder, that gives you a lot of freedom and rights that you might not have on other platforms. So that's one thing, that immutability. Of course, the JPEG is going to be there forever, which is not true for most Ethereum nfts. So that's another part of it. The other thing is that it has this very true, very real scarcity, in the sense that in the Ethereum Nft world, when people talk about scarcity, yeah, sure, you have the bored apes, and the smart contract says there's only going to be 10,000 of them.
00:37:09.340 - 00:37:42.934, Speaker C: So that's it. And that's true. But you can also, at the same day, do another smart contract that has another 10,000 or another 100,000 or another million. And there's really no limit to how many nfts you can create in a day. You wanted to, you could create many millions of pieces every day if you wanted to. With inscriptions, they take up block space, so that's as scarce as you can get. If you want to make an inscription, you have to acquire this very expensive material, which is the bitcoin block space, and you have to use it in order to mold this inscription that you want to have.
00:37:42.934 - 00:38:21.824, Speaker C: Without that, you can't do it. And we all know that there's only going to be 144 blocks every day, each of them up to four megabytes and not more. And that is all you have to work with if you are an inscription creator and everyone has to share this. So that makes those truly scarce. The material that the inscriptions are made of is truly scarce. So I think those two things together, I mean, one, they create a completely different dynamic that just makes the market interesting. It's not just a copy of the Ethereum NFT market, but also, I think they're very similar.
00:38:21.824 - 00:38:42.100, Speaker C: They kind of inherit a lot of bitcoin's properties. So when someone who's interested in Ethereum NFTs is onboarded into the inscription community and starts to try them out, I feel like, I think, yeah, I think they learn some of the stuff that we believe makes bitcoin special through that.
00:38:42.292 - 00:38:42.716, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:38:42.780 - 00:38:44.702, Speaker B: So it is spreading the message and the.
00:38:44.788 - 00:38:49.778, Speaker C: I really think so. I really think, and I didn't get that at first, but these days I really.
00:38:49.866 - 00:39:04.722, Speaker B: Yeah, it's really fascinating what do you think about the fact that an ordinal theory, now, if our listeners don't remember this, we're not gonna go deep into necessarily exactly what it is, but go back and watch our interview with Casey Rodemore from February.
00:39:04.818 - 00:39:05.746, Speaker C: That was a good one.
00:39:05.890 - 00:39:20.758, Speaker B: Thank you. So you got the inscriptions. That's the data burned, inscribed. I love the term inscription, by the way. Love it because I do think of bitcoin as like a digital stone tablet in that way. Right. It is the most immutable ledger.
00:39:20.758 - 00:40:04.060, Speaker B: It is the scarcest block space, I would say, that is reliably scarce. So you inscribe the data, and then you've got the ordinal, which is a unique individual sat, which the ordinal's protocol software then can connect to the inscription. And that's what we're moving around, is sort of the token that determines ownership of the inscription. But it's not a native bitcoin protocol function. It's kind of like a layer built on top. If I say, actually, I want to look at sats in reverse order, or I want to only look at prime numbered sats or whatever, we could make up another way to count individual satoshis. But so is that.
00:40:04.060 - 00:40:21.688, Speaker B: Whereas on Ethereum, I mean, these tokens, they're real. Now, most, you point out most of the data, the jpegs aren't on Ethereum. They're just pointing to some link somewhere. So those aren't real, but the tokens are kind of realer. But then on bitcoin, the data is more real, but the tokens are a little bit less real. How do you think about that?
00:40:21.816 - 00:40:22.240, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:40:22.312 - 00:41:22.064, Speaker C: So on this, what's real? Right. What is real and what isn't? I think what makes the ethereum tokens different is that there's, I guess the tokens are part of the consensus protocol. Like miners or these days, takers have to agree on the state of tokens, where in ordinals they don't. They're not even aware that it exists. And you could easily be a participant in the bitcoin network without even being aware of any of this. That, in my view, fits into the bitcoin ethos pretty well, too, because when you look at a lot of the kind of protocols that people have been building on top of bitcoin over the years, like lightning sidechain stuff, a lot of thoughts around. I remember scriptless scripts used to be a thing that people used to talk about.
00:41:22.064 - 00:42:14.674, Speaker C: Maybe now with taproot that's going to one day happen. Those kind of things have been all about not putting too much stress on the consensus protocol and doing things in a way that people who do not want to participate don't have to be aware of it. That's kind of the bitcoin ethos in a way. And what it does is it allows the base layer to be very efficient, removes a lot of issues with scaling, because really what you're saying is, look, I don't have to involve the entire bitcoin industry and community with this little thing that I'm doing. If they want to, they can. If they don't, they don't have to, and it just becomes easier. So I think that really fits the bitcoin spirit very well.
00:42:14.674 - 00:42:50.584, Speaker C: Now, as to, are they real or not? You know, it's just a way to interpret transactions. Right. I think it's very similar, if you're the type of person who pays taxes, for example, that I think it's actually very familiar to you that it's basically just a first in, first out accounting method, really. That's what all ordinal theory is. And I think that most tax professionals will say that it is very real. So it depends on who you ask. And I think that's kind of what's nice about it.
00:42:50.584 - 00:42:53.632, Speaker C: Like, you don't have to subscribe to it.
00:42:53.768 - 00:43:13.424, Speaker B: I agree that it is very much in line with sort of the bitcoin development ethos, which is funny because some bitcoin developers are very upset about it. I think there's a case to be made that it's. I certainly don't believe this, but that it bloats the chain, you know, I.
00:43:13.424 - 00:43:14.360, Speaker C: Mean, the inscription part.
00:43:14.432 - 00:43:34.444, Speaker B: The inscription part, yeah. The ordinal, I think, is that's exactly how bitcoin developers wanted to do stuff like this. It's even better than using opereturn, which also adds data. But did you think on that point, do you think there will be. I've seen some patterns ord as slow as a new one. Luke Dash Junior had. Or disrespector.
00:43:34.444 - 00:44:11.664, Speaker B: What did he say? He said, you're lying and tricking the code. Someone said, well, aren't people just when they inscribe, aren't they just using taproot and bitcoin exactly as developed? And he said, no, they're lying and tricking the code. My note is accepting them as valid, so I'm pretty sure they're legit. And so then he released or disrespector, which I believe it is essentially like a plugin or a patch that allows your node not to even download the inscriptions in the first place. They can already be pruned if you want, but if you don't want to download them, you can use his. And there's another one that I saw, which was, it's called Ord is slow.
00:44:11.784 - 00:44:12.152, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:44:12.208 - 00:44:58.156, Speaker B: And I think the idea is that it's almost like IEX, the equities exchange, that was trying to combat high frequency trading from the book Flash boys. They wanted to add a speed bump to the high frequency trading so that everybody would. It would be just slow enough that you wouldn't really wouldn't be worth front running or doing high frequency trading there. The idea with this is that your node would just delay the propagation of any block that had an inscription in it just a little bit such that it would become, if everybody ran it, then miners would probably just avoid those blocks and go for the. Anyway, do you think anything like that will either be widely adopted, sort of a patch, or more dramatically, any kind of fork that removes this functionality? What do you think the likelihood of that is?
00:44:58.220 - 00:45:23.734, Speaker C: Well, let's first clarify my incentives. Because people assume, well, he's all about tap or wizards, so he obviously wants inscriptions to keep going. My incentives are very much aligned with killing inscriptions right now, because we already have the entire tepper wizard collection out. It will be great for us if no one else could make inscriptions. We're going to be like.
00:45:23.774 - 00:45:23.902, Speaker E: Right.
00:45:23.918 - 00:45:30.590, Speaker B: Because you can already transfer the sats. That's interesting. A fork, for example. They can't prevent these from being transferred.
00:45:30.662 - 00:45:30.950, Speaker E: Exactly.
00:45:30.982 - 00:45:41.286, Speaker B: And they can't really delete. I mean, they could say, like, find any block. If you run this version of bitcoin core and, like, go out, go back there and delete all of the inscription data off your node.
00:45:41.350 - 00:45:41.734, Speaker C: Good luck.
00:45:41.774 - 00:45:46.198, Speaker B: But we could still just, anyone could just not do that and just run like they would exist.
00:45:46.246 - 00:45:46.590, Speaker E: Exactly.
00:45:46.622 - 00:45:47.022, Speaker B: Good luck.
00:45:47.078 - 00:45:47.674, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:45:49.294 - 00:46:05.550, Speaker C: So, yeah, they cannot make them not transferable because that will require literally blacklisting all of those sats, which is not going to happen, especially considering ordinal's theory is not part of consensus. So you can't blacklist them.
00:46:05.662 - 00:46:09.854, Speaker B: You'd have to add ordinal's theory to the consensus and then block it.
00:46:09.934 - 00:46:10.222, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:46:10.278 - 00:46:44.974, Speaker C: Yeah. So making them not transferable is simply not possible. And so my incentives are very much aligned with the bitcoin developers finding a way to stopping inscriptions from being a thing. That would be great, because then, because yours are already mine, already inscribed, and that's fantastic. However, I am so convinced that it is not something that they can do that. I'm not going to pursue that path. I just don't see a way to stop this because, you know, these two patches.
00:46:44.974 - 00:46:53.266, Speaker C: My opinion about this is pretty harsh. I think it's just children virtue signaling, really.
00:46:53.330 - 00:46:53.970, Speaker E: That's what it is.
00:46:54.002 - 00:47:47.634, Speaker C: Because it has absolutely no effect over anything. If it had, that would have been very concerning. Not for inscriptions, but for bitcoin. Like, if some pissed off children could have manipulate the bitcoin peer to peer network to censor the type of transactions that they don't want, then that would mean that the probably United States government can do it too, and China can do it too. Actually, it's a fascinating discussion. If we want to talk about how the peer to peer network for propagating transactions in bitcoin works, it doesn't have some well known issues that probably, like a state actor probably could try to take advantage of, but not a bunch of angry boys in their basement. No, no.
00:47:48.094 - 00:47:58.870, Speaker B: Let's talk about bitcoin maximalism a little bit. Cause you, I think, were certainly one of the loudest, if not maybe the loudest of the last, you know, called about the last year, maybe in particular.
00:47:59.022 - 00:48:01.166, Speaker C: Some would say I'm obsessed. Yeah, yeah.
00:48:01.350 - 00:48:15.864, Speaker B: And you pointed out that what really got you excited about ordinals in the first place was seeing all the anger from some bitcoin maximalists about it. What is at the core of your criticism of today's bitcoin maximalism?
00:48:16.244 - 00:48:16.812, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:48:16.908 - 00:48:25.464, Speaker C: So for people who don't know me for quite a long period of time, I was probably known as a bitcoin maximist myself.
00:48:26.124 - 00:48:52.556, Speaker B: I just recall I was talking with you about this before we started recording, but you were one of the biggest promoters of the lightning network, particularly during COVID We were all stuck inside, but ud used to run these virtual reality lightning meetups straight up, and those were awesome. So just to echo that, I mean, you were, I think, on the forefront in many ways of bitcoin, mainstream bitcoin culture back then.
00:48:52.660 - 00:48:53.036, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:48:53.100 - 00:48:58.660, Speaker B: So, yeah, what changed or how did bring us up to the present day?
00:48:58.732 - 00:49:35.196, Speaker C: So it's, you know, I think it's all of those. I had all of those revelations kind of together in the same, like, one year period. And, you know, I keep saying, I've always said that, um, even. Even when you were around bitcoin for a long time, I think you always learn new things about it. And always when I say that, I feel like, well, I'm saying that because it's. It's a nice thing to say, but no, I actually I know everything now, surely. I know everything now, right? And then a year later, like, man, damn, I actually did it and it always keeps happening.
00:49:35.196 - 00:50:27.984, Speaker C: And I think that was one of those things that I kind of had this epiphany around, that something changed between 2017 to 2021, something big changed, I think. Because if you look at the previous bitcoin rally in 2017 and just the ICO boom and all of that crap, everyone back in 2017 wanted to onboard into anything in crypto, like ethereum, ripple, iota, icos, whatever was happening back then, they had to go through bitcoin. If you went to coinbase, I think you only could buy bitcoin back then, maybe for a while even.
00:50:28.324 - 00:50:39.364, Speaker B: It was four coins, it was bitcoin, ETH, litecoin and then bitcoin cash eventually, maybe XRP, maybe was the other one at that time, I can't recall, but yes, and even shortly before that, it was bitcoin only.
00:50:39.484 - 00:50:40.708, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:50:40.756 - 00:50:54.668, Speaker C: So you kind of, you want, you know, if you wanted to trade any other coin, you would go, you would buy some bitcoin, you would withdraw it to your wallet. So you end up with an actual bitcoin wallet, then you would transfer some of it to, like, whatever, I don't know, like Poloniex or something back at.
00:50:54.676 - 00:50:59.026, Speaker B: The polo, yeah, polo, Bittrex, Bitfinex, yeah.
00:50:59.130 - 00:51:41.400, Speaker C: And you would use those bitcoins in order to buy whatever shitcoins you wanted to have. Right. And at the end of the bubble, where most of those coins, definitely most of the icos went to zero and disappeared. Short people took a lot of big hits, but they ended up with some bitcoin in their wallet and they became bitcoiners in that sense. And they end up learning about bitcoin out of necessity, kind of. And some of them found long term value in it. Fast forward to 2021, I would say that barely happened at all, because I think, and there are many reasons to that.
00:51:41.400 - 00:52:39.316, Speaker C: Stablecoins became way more popular ethereum, but is also a reason, I think, that people who decided to not play the centralized exchange game instead to try defi stuff and try nfts on self custody platforms, they just bought ETH. They bought ETH, put it in their metamask wallet, started trading it, started trading nfts. And of course, yeah, bull market ended most of these nfts, not all of them, but most of them went to absolute zero and completely disappeared. But they still had some ETH in their metamask, and they're ETH people now. And I think that five years from now, I think we're going to feel this as bitcoiners. I think we're going to have a problem where we missed out on a full bull cycle, where we did not onboard a lot of new people. We onboarded some, of course, but not from the larger crypto experience.
00:52:39.420 - 00:53:24.680, Speaker B: It was less about utility, what bitcoiners did join during that period, and it was about something else. What was it about? That's what I want to get you to, is the laser eyes and the modern maximalism of not only must you be a bitcoiner, but you have to hate everything else. That really, I feel like, did emerge a lot more strongly. Well, after 2017, and maybe even during the pandemic, to be honest. Yeah, although it started, I mean, keep in mind Ethereum went all the way down to like dollar 89 during the last bear market. So I mean, there was a huge, I think bitcoin dominance went up to well over 70%. So there was a fleeback rush back to bitcoin.
00:53:24.680 - 00:53:53.148, Speaker B: But then sometime in, I think in the summer of 2020 is when I really started to notice when Defi summer happened. And then sort of after that, it was like, wait, there's, you know, the icos were dead, but there's this other, for lack of a better word, shit coinery that can now be done. That got people excited about Ethereum that bitcoin had no part of. And it, it feels like around that time is when it really turned to this I call more hardline bitcoin maximalism.
00:53:53.316 - 00:53:54.064, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:53:56.044 - 00:54:35.320, Speaker C: While the Ethereum community gained, a lot of people were fascinated with DeFi and a lot of art collectors and culture connoisseurs. The bitcoin community got a lot of laser eyes and a lot of people who claim to only eat steak. And I don't have a particular problem with people who eat steak. I eat a lot of steak, mostly steak even. But I just don't see how it relates to bitcoin at all. And that's fine. I think it's great to have a sector of bitcoin who's very enthusiastic about stakes.
00:54:35.320 - 00:55:06.494, Speaker C: That's awesome. I just don't think that should be our main value proposition. I don't think that should be the one thing we put in front of everything else. The one moment was kind of difficult for me personally, because, look, I care deeply about bitcoin. It's been a very important part of my adult life. It's a sentimental thing, really. One thing that was kind of difficult for me was in 2021, there was the big Bitcoin Miami conference.
00:55:06.494 - 00:55:19.674, Speaker C: They had this infamous segment with, I think it was Michael Saylor with Max Keiser on stage. And Max Kaiser is jumping up and down and yelling, fuck Elon. Fuck Elon.
00:55:19.754 - 00:55:20.522, Speaker B: We're never selling.
00:55:20.578 - 00:55:41.470, Speaker C: We're never selling. And there's this huge, massive bitcoin logo behind him. And of course, all of the mainstream media picked up on this and they're like, look at those insane bitcoin errs. It's basically like bit connect two, because it did seem like that it was the same, like, you know, when the crowd is standing up cheering, like, yeah, it's fuck Elon. Like, and I'm sitting there, like, thinking, wait, what is this about?
00:55:41.542 - 00:55:42.742, Speaker B: What does this have to do with bitcoin?
00:55:42.798 - 00:55:46.654, Speaker C: What does this have to do with anything? You know, like, fine. You don't like Elon.
00:55:46.694 - 00:55:46.998, Speaker E: Okay.
00:55:47.046 - 00:56:01.348, Speaker C: I mean, okay, but how is that. Why is that the thing that we're putting out there as the representative of bitcoin? And it's great to have a segment of the bitcoin community who is suspicious of Elon and suspicious of other things. Suspicious of vegetables. That's great.
00:56:01.396 - 00:56:01.820, Speaker E: Right.
00:56:01.932 - 00:56:24.104, Speaker C: But I have no problem with that. They should exist, but the fact that they're representative of the bitcoin brand, I think, has done more harm than good in the last few years. It for sure attracted some people. Some people are attracted by that, and that's fine. But I think we should have, like, we should strive for kind of more than just those people.
00:56:24.684 - 00:56:30.114, Speaker B: And that's what, in your mind, ordinals. One of the things ordinals brings here is a broadening of bitcoin culture.
00:56:30.284 - 00:56:32.314, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
00:56:32.694 - 00:56:49.046, Speaker B: With taproot wizards, you talked about the wizard shower, but the other tasks, it's things like make a lightning transaction or donation using lightning, download a wallet. Right. These are sort of bitcoin native tasks.
00:56:49.150 - 00:56:49.902, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah.
00:56:49.998 - 00:56:54.670, Speaker C: So we did this thing, we call it the wizards. Cool. It's like wizard school.
00:56:54.702 - 00:56:55.894, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like Harry Potter.
00:56:56.014 - 00:57:43.224, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. It's like this, you know, it's this web experience people are going through in order to kind of joined the wizard community. And because people, especially more from the NFT crowd, but also kind of old timer bitcoiners have been pretty excited about this, too, because people are fairly excited about this whole type of wizard thing. They wanted to be a part of it. They went through the steps and the quests in the wizard school. And the first quest that we put out was about having people try out lightning. We assumed that most of the people in our audience in our community probably never tried lightning before, because many of them never tried bitcoin before at all.
00:57:43.224 - 00:58:11.452, Speaker C: And even if they did, they didn't really have a reason to try lightning. So we were like, okay, let's just let them try it and see what happens. And we wanted to do something good. We said, okay, let's make it. We made a donation to the Human Rights foundation for their bitcoin development fund. And, you know, we didn't want to charge people a lot. We didn't want them to make people donate, make a large donation.
00:58:11.452 - 00:58:16.076, Speaker C: So lightning kind of made sense because you can have people make small donations.
00:58:16.220 - 00:58:17.004, Speaker B: And it works, right?
00:58:17.044 - 00:58:17.892, Speaker C: And it works.
00:58:17.948 - 00:58:18.116, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:58:18.140 - 00:58:26.142, Speaker C: And you collect all of them, and it ended up, you know, being a nice number. It was $20,000 that we were able to collect from participants and donate.
00:58:26.268 - 00:58:28.774, Speaker B: Where did you guys donate? Where did that get donated?
00:58:29.234 - 00:58:31.002, Speaker C: Yeah, it was all to the Human Rights foundation.
00:58:31.098 - 00:58:31.730, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:58:31.882 - 00:59:07.274, Speaker C: So they. And what was really interesting one, it just worked. It worked very smoothly, too. I honestly, very few people complained about anything. And the few people who did it was because of some issues we had on our back end with all of the interest we got very quickly. But lightning just worked on that particular instance, and people were very impressed. We were looking through responses in our discord server and stuff, and people were like, man, I had no idea that you can make bitcoin transactions so quickly and so cheaply.
00:59:07.274 - 00:59:12.294, Speaker C: A lot of people were like, hey, this is just like Solana. This is really cool. That's what a ton of people say.
00:59:12.334 - 00:59:45.554, Speaker B: It is wild to think about how now if a roll up launches on Ethereum, that thing will have like a billion tvl in like a day for like two days, right? The Ethereum and even just the altcoin sort of ecosystem. And users are very accustomed to, like, bridging to a side chain or whatever, and they just, it's like the bitcoiners don't do it a lot themselves. But lightning works. I mean, lightning, I think, has gotten pretty resilient. I use it a decent amount. It's not, it's. But it should be more widely used.
00:59:45.554 - 01:00:03.762, Speaker B: Bitcoiners aren't really sort of that interested yet. Many of the most hardcore ones are. But I mean, it's funny to hear that, that they weren't aware, because even the bitcoin maximalists have been promoting lightning for a long time. Rightly so, because it's pretty good. I mean, for small payments in particular.
01:00:03.898 - 01:00:42.562, Speaker C: So what we kind of realize and just big picture of what we're trying to do with tap wizards is we don't believe anymore that yelling at, at people on podcasts is going to change their behavior a lot. I used to think that when I was younger, but I don't really think that anymore. And you just look at, I'm not ashamed of this. You look at the rest of the crypto ecosystem and there's already a playbook to how you generate activity around things or you get people to try things for the first time. I think we can learn from that. So that's kind of what we're trying to do. We're trying to say, okay, we're going to stick to bitcoin values.
01:00:42.562 - 01:01:25.406, Speaker C: We're not going to do like crazy defi stuff, but we can get people excited about type of wizards and use that in order to get them to try bitcoin ecosystem stuff. Funny story, when we did that lightning quest, it only lasted for 48 hours. It was pretty short. But during those 48 hours, I had two CEO's of different lightning companies reach out to me asking like, hey, we're seeing a lot of activities. This, you did you do this? And then the next question was, can you stop? Because apparently they weren't really ready to.
01:01:25.430 - 01:01:32.126, Speaker B: Handle that for liquidity. I mean, you definitely caused a large influx of lightning users, new lightning users.
01:01:32.190 - 01:01:33.798, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:01:33.886 - 01:02:11.624, Speaker C: So it was, yeah, it was large in any, you know, in any metric of the lightning network. It was very unusual. Yeah, I think we looked at last time, I looked like maybe a week or two ago, I looked at how many people tried lightning as part of Nustir. Nuster has this cool feature. It's pretty cool to pay, you know, lightning transactions to other people and they, you know, people use it relatively routinely. But the number of users who used it is around again, that was two weeks ago that I looked. It was around 1011 thousand people.
01:02:11.624 - 01:02:39.392, Speaker C: So we got to that number in 48 hours. If we kept the quest going, we would have been way, way, way higher. We just intentionally wanted to make it time limited and we will do other lightning things. So I just think that this method of kind of incentivizing people to try out ecosystem tools, it works.
01:02:39.448 - 01:02:39.752, Speaker E: Yeah.
01:02:39.808 - 01:02:51.832, Speaker B: So what is the incentive? I mean, is it, I complete all the wizard quests and that puts me front of the line for like a taproot wizard. You've already inscribed them all. Right, how many are there, first of all, by the way?
01:02:51.888 - 01:03:22.214, Speaker C: So there are. The number is 21 21. So 21 21 temple wizards. And we, similarly to how, similar to how phoners of other crypto systems will not talk about the airdrop before it happens. We can't talk about it too much. I can't give you the details of how it's going to happen because then people are going to game it. But the general idea is, yes, you participate in the quests, you do well.
01:03:22.214 - 01:03:47.526, Speaker C: One way or another, you'll get your opportunity to be part of the tap with wizards community if you do well on the quest now it is just to set expectations. There are only 21, 121 Tupperware wizards, and there already have been over 20,000 people who participate in quests. And there are going to be more quests. So not everyone's going to win. So you need to do well. Got it?
01:03:47.670 - 01:04:11.232, Speaker B: All right, one last question, udi, before we wrap it up, and it's been a great conversation. I've really enjoyed this, actually. Maybe I'll have one more after that. But one question here. So the bitcoin maximalists were seething a bit about, and still are about ordinals. What about the Ethereum NFT community? Other than the. You've got many who came in and got excited about it, as you pointed out.
01:04:11.232 - 01:04:15.800, Speaker B: But are the Ethereum NFT maximalists, are they also mad about this?
01:04:15.952 - 01:05:18.424, Speaker C: Some are, but I've seen, you know, from my experience, the Ethereum maximalists have been mostly open to at least discuss it. The one thing that you just cannot ignore is that bitcoin maximalist, as soon as they heard of this, before it even became a thing, they immediately, they basically said, it's a scam, it's immoral, it's terrible for the bitcoin network. Anyone who does this is a terrible person. And they clearly did not look into the details, because if they had, they would, I'm sure they would still hate it, but they would use other excuses to hate it. So clearly they hated it before they even looked at it. I think on the Ethereum side, even the ones who are not big fans, at least they're open to look into it first, which I think is supposed to be pretty normal, just normal behavior. Yeah, I don't, of course some people are not going to like it, that's fine.
01:05:18.424 - 01:05:35.604, Speaker C: But I found that most of the Ethereum people have been either they didn't care or they were pretty interested. Mostly people who hated it from both camps have been people who didn't look into it yet. Yeah.
01:05:35.764 - 01:06:19.114, Speaker B: All right, last question. So I know you're very bullish on ordinals, expanding bitcoin culture. You've been working for years to get people interested in bitcoin and teach them how to use it. Fast forward 1015 years. Do you think is bitcoin more important just in an absolute basis than it is today? And then relative to the other cryptos, do you think bitcoin, remember that OG bitcoin maximalist thesis that altcoins were testnets for bitcoin? And we haven't really seen that play out yet, but maybe ordinals is one of the first, most concrete ways that it could. It's starting to play out. So on an absolute basis, and relative to the other cryptos, where do you see bitcoin in ten years?
01:06:19.414 - 01:07:05.154, Speaker C: That's a tough one. Look, on bitcoin, I'm always bullish and probably always going to remain bullish, and I do think that it's, you never know exactly how, like, what is going to happen and why and how things are going to play out. But I think there are very good odds that bitcoin will continue to grow more and more important over the next decade, which is not necessarily a happy thought. It's kind of a pessimistic outlook. It's kind of an outlook of things, just in the general sense of. Of the world. Things might need to go a little bit worse before they can get better.
01:07:05.154 - 01:07:13.914, Speaker C: And in that sense, yeah, bitcoin can play a very important part. As far as, this is great.
01:07:16.054 - 01:07:16.446, Speaker E: Teeing.
01:07:16.470 - 01:07:17.714, Speaker B: Up the outro here.
01:07:21.254 - 01:07:26.254, Speaker C: As far as ornos go. And just bitcoin's importance in the crypto.
01:07:26.334 - 01:07:26.550, Speaker E: Yeah.
01:07:26.582 - 01:07:42.394, Speaker B: Relative to the other cryptos, that epic crypto twitter maximalist battle between ETH maxis, bitcoin maxis, et cetera. Are we not even predicting bitcoin dominance? But that would be one way to explain a view on it.
01:07:42.694 - 01:08:04.258, Speaker C: I think that what I would be interested in is bitcoin hopefully going back to its role as the sort of king of crypto. That's usually how people refer to it back in the day. They would be like, yeah, whatever. There's all those other coins. They're interesting. We'll trade them, we'll build stuff on it. Cool.
01:08:04.258 - 01:08:41.873, Speaker C: But bitcoin is king. That kind of notion, I feel like kind of disappeared recently, in the last couple of years, or at least kind of slowed down a bit because, and I think a big reason of it is just because we didn't onboard new people. I think the big thing that changed is we stopped trying to maintain that image of, yeah, you want to do crypto? Sure, do it. Do whatever you want. You want to trade those? Have fun. I don't care but you should probably have 5% of your portfolio in bitcoin still. You made profits on those.
01:08:41.873 - 01:09:38.775, Speaker C: You should probably put some of it in bitcoin, because that's why we do it. That's the end goal. I think we should strive to maintain that image. But instead, I think a lot of, at least the loud people online have been trying to do kind of the opposite, kind of distance themselves from the crypto culture, which the reason I think it's a mistake is because you don't have to agree with any of the things that the crypto people do. What matters is they are like the lowest hanging fruit for people that you can convert to actually become bitcoin native in the sense that they hold bitcoin and use it to pay for things. They have a mental model of, my savings are in bitcoin. They could have a mental model of, my savings are in bitcoin, and I'm trying to have more bitcoin.
01:09:38.775 - 01:10:10.380, Speaker C: And when I'm spending, I'm going to look at how much does this cost me in bitcoin terms, because that's what matters. That's how crypto used to be. And it's very easy to get there because they're already using ETH or Sol or whatever as their currency for trading nfts or defi stuff or what have you. Changing that to bitcoin is not a very tall order. They already use self custody. They already do all of this stuff. So converting them into people who are bitcoin is really not that difficult, you know?
01:10:10.452 - 01:10:11.172, Speaker E: Yeah.
01:10:11.348 - 01:10:32.220, Speaker C: So I would say if we can't convince these guys, I do not understand how we think the people, just normal people in Germany, are going to use bitcoin as their main currency. I don't understand that. Like, we. We should first test this on the people who are very easy to get to that to get to. And then, yeah, sure, let's do the El Salvador stuff as well, you know?
