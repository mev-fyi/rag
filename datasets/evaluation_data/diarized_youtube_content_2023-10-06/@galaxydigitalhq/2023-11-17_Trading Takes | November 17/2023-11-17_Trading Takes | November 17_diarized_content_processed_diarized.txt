00:00:08.520 - 00:00:12.878, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, BIMnet, thanks for joining galaxy brains.
00:00:12.966 - 00:00:13.894, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:13.974 - 00:00:18.574, Speaker A: Soft. CPI came in soft. So soft things are changing out here.
00:00:18.614 - 00:00:22.366, Speaker B: They are. We talked about a little paradigm shift happening in the day last week.
00:00:22.390 - 00:00:23.470, Speaker A: We talked about it, yeah.
00:00:23.622 - 00:00:52.566, Speaker B: And so what we saw from the CPI report was a decline in prices on a broader based way. I mean, the headline number came in flat. The core CPI number came in at 0.2. These are all indicative of what we like to call a soft landing. Some of the components in particular that drove some of the weakness, or the softening was you had owners equivalent rent declined to like 0.4 month on month versus like 0.6. The services started to cool down a little bit.
00:00:52.566 - 00:01:03.046, Speaker B: Airline fares came off. Energy prices have been cooling, not in the CPI, but like, if you just look at gas prices over the past nine weeks, they're literally down nine weeks in a row.
00:01:03.070 - 00:01:04.198, Speaker A: Like crude, basically.
00:01:04.326 - 00:01:07.814, Speaker B: Yeah. But people pay for at the pump. Crude, crude's been down.
00:01:07.854 - 00:01:09.982, Speaker A: Are they? I don't really drive a lot anymore.
00:01:10.118 - 00:01:12.478, Speaker B: I think the national average is probably low three.
00:01:12.526 - 00:01:15.514, Speaker A: Is there even a gas station in New York, in Manhattan? Five.
00:01:17.134 - 00:01:22.382, Speaker B: But no, it's, it's, it's tough to get a sense, but high level, it seems like the prices.
00:01:22.438 - 00:01:25.574, Speaker A: But that's important. The gas price is a true metric for Americans.
00:01:25.654 - 00:01:27.006, Speaker B: Absolutely. People spend money on that.
00:01:27.030 - 00:01:27.622, Speaker A: It cost money.
00:01:27.678 - 00:01:30.802, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. And why we strip it out because it's volatile.
00:01:30.858 - 00:01:34.802, Speaker A: Like, it's absurd, that whole thing. Krugman is always saying this right here.
00:01:34.818 - 00:02:29.852, Speaker B: The inflation, it's like you always care about the rate of change, not the price level, messed up. And you have any idea how far behind the curve that those figures were when inflation was like 1314, 15%, and they're telling you it was only eight. The figures are absurd and you need to adjust them for the 21st century, and we don't because it's the fed and all these people are just an academic institution that's been around doing the same stuff, want to keep it the same basically, for the past 40 years. And now that they missed catching the inflation story, they're more focused on anecdotal evidence and high frequency points. But high level, it's still nonsense. You can parse the data however you want, but I think the most important thing that the market should really think about is the last mile in terms of getting inflation under control is typically the toughest. That's what history tells us.
00:02:29.852 - 00:02:56.684, Speaker B: And given the price reaction that we've had in markets since that CPI report. I think that's abundantly clear. Just to give you an idea, yesterday was one of the largest loosening of financial conditions of the year, and I think going back a couple of years, but high level, I mean, just to give you a couple bits of information, the Russell was up almost five and a half percent yesterday.
00:02:56.764 - 00:02:57.384, Speaker A: Wow.
00:02:57.974 - 00:03:31.286, Speaker B: Literally its best performance of the day of the year. Right. And nasdaqs back to trend highs almost s and p is 4500. And change bonds have rallied to tens or 450. There's inflows into high yield bond ETF's. And so what you're seeing is folks going really out the risk curve and buying junk, going out the risk curve in terms of duration and buying longer dated paper. And that's kind of what happens when the market gets a sense that the Fed's turning a bit or the data is turning a little bit.
00:03:31.286 - 00:03:35.182, Speaker B: And what is that? That's inflationary, not deflationary.
00:03:35.278 - 00:03:36.662, Speaker A: I see. This is why the last mile is.
00:03:36.678 - 00:03:39.702, Speaker B: So hard, because it becomes such a push pull.
00:03:39.798 - 00:03:46.354, Speaker A: Yeah. You get the good news on inflation, which makes people go out on the risk curve, which can increase inflation. Correct.
00:03:47.134 - 00:04:06.876, Speaker B: Most directly. It's like you had mortgage rates drop recently by to the tune of 25, probably a little bit more now, 30, 35 basis points. And once you had those mortgage rates drop, what happened? Mortgage applications shot up till the highest level since June. So what's going to happen if mortgage rates fall? Oh wait, people are going to be.
00:04:06.900 - 00:04:11.020, Speaker A: Like, oh, maybe housing market's going to tighten again. Everyone's going to jump pile in, right?
00:04:11.132 - 00:05:01.752, Speaker B: And so it becomes such a push pull. And what we have to keep in mind is that one of the things that people don't even talk about, that's a huge thing, is who's going to be doing layoffs in these large multinationals when their stock prices are close to the dead highs? You're going to feel the need to really let go of 10% of your workforce when your stock is within 5% of all time highs. It's so difficult. And these people at the Fed, they're so concerned about breaking things when tens were breaking the 5%. Like, everybody knows the fiscal situation's messed up, right? Like, you gotta let that stuff run. I think if you wanna get back to like some, someplace that's reasonable. But right now, you know, what it kinda seems like is risk.
00:05:01.752 - 00:05:11.176, Speaker B: Markets are gonna rip, you know, people long, risk assets and bonds are gonna do well. That's gonna be inflationary. Nobody's gonna get laid off. And three months from now we're gonna.
00:05:11.200 - 00:05:13.168, Speaker A: Be like, oh, inflation's back.
00:05:13.216 - 00:05:14.000, Speaker B: Inflation's back.
00:05:14.072 - 00:05:23.756, Speaker A: Yeah. This is the big fear. This is the Paul Volcker era fear. They did this, they did a whole cycle. I forget how high it got. And then they come back, really kill inflation. Yeah.
00:05:23.756 - 00:05:30.268, Speaker A: Which would be what? Raise it even further. Keep raising six plus, not higher for longer. Higher for longer and even higher from here for longer.
00:05:30.316 - 00:05:31.052, Speaker B: Correct, correct.
00:05:31.068 - 00:05:35.824, Speaker A: Yeah. And I know Jay Powell is very concerned about that. I mean, but apparently not enough.
00:05:36.484 - 00:05:42.624, Speaker B: Like, no, not concerned. I mean, there are 100 basis points.
00:05:43.484 - 00:06:09.396, Speaker A: I was looking after the CPI came out yesterday, the cuts, literally the day before, it was some 25 bps of cuts by May, but still even some increase priced in before then. And now it's just flat and down cuts in March. Again, according to this is with them how the market is pricing it, 25, I think 28 bits of cuts when I looked this morning in March is what the market is expecting. So I mean, that's absurd. That seems.
00:06:09.500 - 00:06:18.874, Speaker B: But you have to price in some kind of like, you know, premium or discount because they'll go 50 or 100 when they go. Right, right. And the risks are.
00:06:18.954 - 00:06:27.562, Speaker A: But it is a disconnect between, I guess higher for longer doesn't mean no cuts, it just means that we might stay overall higher than usual for longer.
00:06:27.618 - 00:06:28.218, Speaker B: Correct.
00:06:28.386 - 00:06:35.746, Speaker A: But it is a disconnect between the market and the Fed's language. Right? Correct, correct. The market is basically calling the Fed's bluff. They think.
00:06:35.930 - 00:07:09.348, Speaker B: I agree. So here's why that friction exists is one for the effective implementation of monetary policy. The Fed needs less cuts baked into the market because they need money to flow out from the very front end into the rest of the curve because we're issuing so much debt and paper that they need people to buy it. People won't buy that stuff if it has a lot of cuts baked in. They'll just keep the money in the front stuff. And so for the smooth implementation of monetary policy, they actually need less cuts priced in in addition. Right.
00:07:09.348 - 00:07:59.768, Speaker B: If you're the Fed, to preserve optionality, you need to preserve the option of hiking again. You don't want to shock the market with a hike. That's why they're constantly on the more hawkish side, it feels like. But the other thing you're pointing out as well is where is neutral inflation now? More and more it seems like the inflation expectations and realized inflation is kind of hovering around this 3% area, the low threes, instead of this 2% target, there may be a rebasing of just general level of inflation happening across the economy in terms of a quote unquote new normal. And that's what you're seeing in some of the inflation expectation data as well. The Umich, which is really volatile. And you got to caveat it a lot.
00:07:59.768 - 00:08:34.060, Speaker B: But anyway, those like one year inflation expectations are like on a 4% and people that have gotten used to just higher and higher prices, they get accustomed to it and they're like, oh, time for a raise that you're in as well. And it becomes entrenched. And so the fear is that inflation might be entrenched around three to 4% now, which means that interest rates are still too low in that context. And so I see all the soft pieces of data turning in the economy. There's like a freight crisis.
00:08:34.132 - 00:08:43.916, Speaker A: There's, I saw freight and truck, truck driver, someone had the chart of the truck driver layoffs and like the only times it has gone negative, it's been in a recession 100% of the time or something.
00:08:44.020 - 00:09:11.532, Speaker B: Yeah. No, and then also, I mean, just anyone in the lower income quartiles, right, they are getting eaten away at by just the high yields, right? And they just don't have enough disposable income to survive in this kind of environment. Then you get trapped in a debt cycle and you're seeing non performing loans tick up and like default rates of like lower credit score people tick up and stuff. And so that's where the pain is in the economy.
00:09:11.588 - 00:09:37.864, Speaker A: And there is pain and there is, and these are folks that don't have investable money, right? So they're not able to hedge by owning, you know, assets that even by buying the yield and debt, right? So they're just, they're just seeing it at the pump, at the supermarket, right, at the retail stores when they travel for holidays like that, they're bearing the brunt. Right. That's why we often say that inflation is like a tax on the poor, primarily, right, exactly. Wealthy people can pay 5% more for their food.
00:09:37.944 - 00:09:47.152, Speaker B: Yeah. Wealthy people are earning 5% on their checking account and their 401 ks are facts of close to trend highs, right? Yeah. Bibnetta.
00:09:47.168 - 00:09:50.944, Speaker A: Bibi from galaxy trading. My friend, thank you so much for coming on. Galaxy brains. Pleasure.
