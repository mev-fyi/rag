00:00:00.170 - 00:00:46.102, Speaker A: For me like the three major components I look for in any chain to see if it can continue to grow and build products that people want are, you know, what is the developer community like, what is the social layer like and then what's the technology like? And I think for Solana you've got a very differentiated tech approach. You know, it's a monolithic or people are calling it integrated chain right now. It's got a very different narrative from something like Ethereum and bitcoin coin because they're specifically saying, listen, we're focused on execution and scalability. Above all, bitcoin is a store of value. Ethereum could be a high value settlement layer. We're going to be where people build products and where those products can be cheap enough and fast enough that a lot of consumers want to use it. So I think collectively Solana's got that differentiated tech.
00:00:46.102 - 00:00:52.460, Speaker A: It's got a very devoted and committed developer community that was very evident while I was there.
