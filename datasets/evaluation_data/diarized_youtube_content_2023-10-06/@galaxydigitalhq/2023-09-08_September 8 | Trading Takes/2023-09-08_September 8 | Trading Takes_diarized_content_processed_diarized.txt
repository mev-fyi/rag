00:00:07.840 - 00:00:11.614, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet, a BB from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:11.694 - 00:00:12.566, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:12.630 - 00:00:38.078, Speaker A: So it's some exciting stuff has happened just since we last talked. BTC pretty much retraced the entirety of the grayscale pump from last week, which I think a lot of people kind of expected. The ETF stuff was very anticipated and thus probably priced in in a lot of ways. But we also just had another announcement or headline from Kathy Wood and Ark, and 21 shares are filing for an ETH. Spot ETF.
00:00:38.166 - 00:00:38.438, Speaker B: Correct.
00:00:38.486 - 00:00:42.874, Speaker A: Just a few minutes ago. It's Wednesday, September 6. I don't know. Is that a big deal?
00:00:43.534 - 00:01:06.194, Speaker B: I think it is pretty meaningful because we've seen a bunch of ETF, futures ETF filings, and the logic of the grayscale versus Sec decision was pretty clear. The futures product, there isn't much of a difference between futures and spot, at least mathematically.
00:01:06.654 - 00:01:08.374, Speaker A: They said that? They said mathematically.
00:01:08.454 - 00:01:24.574, Speaker B: Mathematically there is no difference. And so if we're making the assumption that futures ETF is going to get approved, the next logical conclusion is a spot ETF. And much like our guest from last.
00:01:24.614 - 00:01:26.582, Speaker A: Week, Eric James Safer.
00:01:26.638 - 00:01:42.846, Speaker B: James Safer, sorry. You know, I agree. I'm a little shocked that there haven't been more filings for Spot ETF, especially. And I do think it's more likely an inevitable type of situation. Cause all these guys, like, they see each other. And then it's one thing after there.
00:01:42.870 - 00:01:56.874, Speaker A: Was that Bloomberg story, even at this point a couple months ago, that said that the SEC was poised to not block those futures ETF's. So I'm shocked that that spot wasn't filed sooner, to your point. Yeah.
00:01:57.414 - 00:02:15.726, Speaker B: Here's the other aspect of it. I mean, ETH is dramatic, dramatically smaller than bitcoin, and there is much more institutional demand for bitcoin as the story that resonates more with folks. And so I do think that some of the bigger players are just focused on bitcoin.
00:02:15.750 - 00:02:17.150, Speaker A: Just one of the other.
00:02:17.262 - 00:02:39.272, Speaker B: Yeah, well, 1ft in front of the others. It's also like you want to have products that people want to trade, right? People want to trade the bitcoin stuff. The demand for the eat stuff is not in the same magnitude. Not that it won't be, but at least at the moment when trying to do a cost analysis, I do think some of your bigger players. Yeah, exactly.
00:02:39.288 - 00:02:41.472, Speaker A: You gotta do education and get it out on wealth platforms.
00:02:41.528 - 00:02:41.816, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:02:41.880 - 00:02:53.284, Speaker A: Okay, so let's talk about other stuff. Cause one of the other macro stories I saw is that the dollar is just really on a pretty big crusade over the last couple months. No, absolutely. Pumping up higher. What impact does that have? What does that mean?
00:02:54.154 - 00:02:55.722, Speaker B: There's a lot of implications.
00:02:55.818 - 00:02:56.282, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:02:56.378 - 00:02:56.658, Speaker B: Right.
00:02:56.706 - 00:02:59.794, Speaker A: Well, do you want to actually, can we start with why? Why is the dollar going up?
00:02:59.834 - 00:04:01.944, Speaker B: The dollar is going up because more folks are believing in a higher for longer stance in terms of interest rates in the US. In addition, it's literally like the best house on the worst street. Japan is stuck at negative interest rates. There's a property bubble that's bursting in China, and they're actively easing and they're cutting interest rates. In places like the UK, you're having a wage price spiral. In Europe, you've had softening of data material, softening of data manufacturing and services, et cetera, versus here in the US, we just had an ISM services that just beat to the upside Powell's preferred measure of inflation, which is super core PCE surprise hire the week before. And then most importantly, in terms of this last real leg in the dollar, I think it's a function of energy prices.
00:04:01.944 - 00:04:32.100, Speaker B: And we're seeing crude top $88 a barrel, brand top $90 a barrel. They have cut, they're committed to, to keeping that supply off the market. Comes out to like 2 million barrels per day, et cetera. But we're producing oil at like COVID levels right now. And that's on purpose because, you know, they have a quote unquote monopoly on energy markets.
00:04:32.172 - 00:04:38.064, Speaker A: Okay, so that's some of why it's been happening. But what are some of the implications of a stronger dollar? I know there was some fears.
00:04:38.454 - 00:05:17.488, Speaker B: So a stronger dollar means that for any commodity importing nation, that the commodity prices are a lot higher. So if you're importing a lot of oil, oil price went up and the dollar exchange rate went against you. And so it's like doubly compounded. And so for nations that are generally consumers of commodities, it's pretty bad. And so that's a major implication. In addition, there's a lot of dollar based debt. And so the higher the cost of that debt as a function of interest rates going up and your currency rate going against you, that fundamentally is going to lead to lower growth.
00:05:17.488 - 00:05:42.574, Speaker B: In addition, over 50% of s and P earnings are abroad. You're going to see earnings take a hit just from the FX impact. If you're in a world where growth is slowing because of things like in China, et cetera, and you are getting hurt on the FX side, of things. I think it's pretty bad for stocks in my head.
00:05:42.614 - 00:05:51.434, Speaker A: And I guess what most things too, that are, I mean, anything priced in the dollar essentially gets more expensive. And so that also includes just assets of all types. Right.
00:05:52.334 - 00:06:14.940, Speaker B: So, yeah, I mean, dollar strength typically means the risk off. Risk off, yeah. But yeah, there's a lot of implications and the question is, like, can it continue? And absolutely all of the structural forces are there. Like as long as Japan is stuck in negative interest rates, their currency is going to get challenged. And so they're out there talking about currency intervention again.
00:06:15.092 - 00:06:15.428, Speaker A: Right.
00:06:15.476 - 00:06:45.702, Speaker B: China's actively trying to defend their currency too. And so it's got broad ranging implications. But the beauty about the dollar right now is it's just such a great safe haven play because you get paid to belong. The thing, it's positive carry to be long dollars and it's a hedge for shit blowing up. And so it's, you know, we've spoken about this before, but it takes on these unique set of properties that become almost self fulfilling.
00:06:45.758 - 00:06:46.406, Speaker A: Right.
00:06:46.590 - 00:07:12.194, Speaker B: And so that's kind of where you're at. And you're testing major levels across, you know, tons of different currencies. I mean, euro looks like it wants to break 107. I think 165 was the low on the year. We're talking about 147, 148 on dollar yen, you're thinking about 150. And currency intervention right now, I think cable is an absolute sale here. I think it's like 126 and change.
00:07:12.194 - 00:07:51.314, Speaker B: It's going to go back down. But then in addition, you're also having some of the most popular currency trades in the world, which is long carry. And these things like Mex and Brazil, those are starting to get unwound now too. And so there's like technical and things that are helping the dollar. And on top of that, you have the Fed that seems like they're reasonably intellectually honest. And so when oil prices go higher, that's going to lead to increased higher headline inflation and core because you can't strip out the energy impact. But to give you an idea, Cleveland fled.
00:07:51.314 - 00:07:57.754, Speaker B: Now cast for August. CPI is a 0.79 month on month.
00:07:58.534 - 00:07:59.174, Speaker A: Wow.
00:07:59.294 - 00:08:05.390, Speaker B: Right. Annualize that, that's, you know, you're talking about 910 percent annualized on the August number.
00:08:05.502 - 00:08:05.950, Speaker A: That's a lot.
00:08:05.982 - 00:08:11.438, Speaker B: It doesn't even have like the big spike. Well, it does have a reasonable spike in energy prices, but you're going to get another one in.
00:08:11.526 - 00:08:13.302, Speaker A: More is coming, potentially more is coming.
00:08:13.358 - 00:08:24.636, Speaker B: And so if you're telling me the Fed is going to be looking at 0.79 inflation prints, and they're thinking about ending hiking policy.
00:08:24.740 - 00:08:25.572, Speaker A: Seems unlikely.
00:08:25.668 - 00:08:34.388, Speaker B: Seems so unlikely. In what world would they have thought? They hiked 500 plus basis points, 525 in short order new year.
00:08:34.436 - 00:08:35.028, Speaker A: I was just gonna ask.
00:08:35.076 - 00:09:00.848, Speaker B: Engaged in QT. And we're a year later, and we're about to print a 0.8 month on month headline, CPI number. You could make a reasonable case that monetary conditions are not even remotely restrictive right now. Home prices are still holding up. Well, you've had moderate crack in the labor market, but people are still spending money. Inflation's still high.
00:09:00.936 - 00:09:09.472, Speaker A: Phineas was just telling me where he lives. In Brooklyn, there's a bunch of luxury stores opening up. People are spending money at all luxury stores all around him.
00:09:09.608 - 00:09:11.608, Speaker B: Yeah. Eventually that has to slow.
00:09:11.696 - 00:09:12.888, Speaker A: You have to think so, right?
00:09:12.936 - 00:09:20.504, Speaker B: Yeah, but at the end of the day, I mean, we just have to think back to the magnitude of money creation that happened.
00:09:20.584 - 00:09:22.688, Speaker A: I guess that's. It's just. There's still so much out there.
00:09:22.736 - 00:09:28.000, Speaker B: So much. I mean, you printed trillions of dollars and you sent it directly to people.
00:09:28.152 - 00:09:29.592, Speaker A: They literally mailed it to people.
00:09:29.648 - 00:09:33.320, Speaker B: They literally mailed it to people. It's not like in certain instances.
00:09:33.392 - 00:09:53.364, Speaker A: What's this thing? Did you see this thing about the. You know, there was the program where you could get a big funding from the feds if you didn't fire people. I forget the name of this program, but, yeah, as an employer. Yeah. And, like, people are still. There's. I read a story in the journal a couple days ago about companies that have sprouted up to help, like consulting companies that have helped.
00:09:53.364 - 00:10:06.864, Speaker A: Helped sprout up to help. Employers still be claiming this money. And it's like, they've now claimed over 180 billion of this money. More than double or something. What? Congress. Like, it's just they're still. They're still pumping money.
00:10:06.864 - 00:10:07.620, Speaker A: They are.
00:10:07.652 - 00:10:09.860, Speaker B: They didn't even realize it. I'll tell you, it's crazy.
00:10:09.932 - 00:10:10.956, Speaker A: People are still doing this thing.
00:10:10.980 - 00:10:34.932, Speaker B: No, people are still doing it. And like one of my strategists I talked to, there's still a reasonable amount of fiscal impulse left from all these programs and all that money that it's got spent over the next quarter, which is insane, but there's also a lot of fraud and abuse in those programs. And the fed. I'm sorry, and the treasury and IR's. All those people, they're coming after it for sure. But you're.
00:10:34.988 - 00:10:37.388, Speaker A: But in the meantime, it's out there. It's getting out there still.
00:10:37.476 - 00:10:37.860, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:37.932 - 00:10:42.820, Speaker A: I mean, in the IR's stuff. There's def. Remember there was the, what are they called? PPE.
00:10:42.932 - 00:10:44.612, Speaker B: Yeah, PPP loans.
00:10:44.668 - 00:10:47.060, Speaker A: PPP program or whatever.
00:10:47.132 - 00:10:47.708, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:10:47.796 - 00:10:52.388, Speaker A: There was tons of fraud in that. I mean, that's what these. But that money got out into the economy, a lot of it.
00:10:52.516 - 00:11:15.606, Speaker B: Well, here's the big concept here, is that when you stimulate to people that have an insanely high propensity to spend, that money goes into the economy and then that money has a multiplier versus when you give money to, let's say, folks with a lot lower propensity to spend, aka rich people, then that money.
00:11:15.630 - 00:11:16.286, Speaker A: They put it in assets.
00:11:16.350 - 00:11:27.974, Speaker B: They put it in assets and it's got much lower velocity. And so what we did is we did the most supercharged version of it and we got inflation. We gave people checks in the mail to literally even better.
00:11:28.014 - 00:11:34.950, Speaker A: They just dropped them right into your account, but you didn't even need to apply. Yeah, I think they used like your prior tax info.
00:11:34.982 - 00:11:45.442, Speaker B: It just showed up. Ridiculous. And so like, yeah, like there are going to be unprecedented, like, consequences to that. And it wasn't just domestically that happened, but I agree.
00:11:45.498 - 00:11:47.010, Speaker A: No, everyone did that.
00:11:47.082 - 00:12:02.738, Speaker B: It's like, oh my God. In Europe, energy prices are real high. Don't worry, we'll print more money, we'll subsidize the cost. Don't worry about it. They were saying there are consequences. You make more money, the value of things relative to those dollars will increase because you're just increasing the denominator.
00:12:02.866 - 00:12:03.626, Speaker A: Very simple.
00:12:03.730 - 00:12:04.970, Speaker B: It's super simple. It's simple.
00:12:05.002 - 00:12:05.386, Speaker A: Supply and demand.
00:12:05.410 - 00:12:23.082, Speaker B: And now I will tell you, the most important thing we talk about today, I think in this context, is fiscal dominance. I kid you not. I saw one or two central bankers getting interviewed about. So Congress is gonna have another huge deficit. What are you thinking about?
00:12:23.098 - 00:12:23.618, Speaker A: Might get worse.
00:12:23.706 - 00:12:40.202, Speaker B: Might get worse. What are you guys thinking? Is a shutdown possible? What are you guys thinking about the fiscal. And these central bankers stand up there and they're like, we can't control fiscal policy. That is a policy of Congress. So our job is to react to it. But more and more, the one thing I believe about, that's what you mean.
00:12:40.218 - 00:12:44.626, Speaker A: By fiscal dominance, that fiscal actually runs the sort of the money, especially when.
00:12:44.650 - 00:13:05.386, Speaker B: You have a constraint like, yeah, the government spends so much money that at a certain point, if they were to spend that money and fund it in the open market, it would cause havoc. And so the central bank has to like print money to buy that at a certain point, and at a certain point, their decision making with respect to how they set interest rates.
00:13:05.450 - 00:13:06.490, Speaker A: It's like their hands are tied.
00:13:06.562 - 00:13:21.384, Speaker B: Their hands are tied by the ability or the necessity to absorb that supply. Not tied, but that's impacted the more material. But that's not an official mandate to accommodate insane levels.
00:13:21.424 - 00:13:24.352, Speaker A: Literally had to do it to control the situation.
00:13:24.528 - 00:13:53.488, Speaker B: But my issue is they're so smart, they can see how disjointed Congress is. They can predict deficit spending pretty well. You know what, don't predict it. Use the CBO's fucking estimates. Sorry, like, oh, you want to claim that? You don't want to get involved in that, it's fine. Use the Congressional Budget Office and tell me how are you going to respond to that? Three, four years of trillion plus dollar deficits. You're not definitely going to be doing QT, right?
00:13:53.496 - 00:13:54.536, Speaker A: You mean look ahead, right?
00:13:54.560 - 00:14:00.856, Speaker B: Don't react and tell us. But if they did, then that would.
00:14:00.880 - 00:14:02.680, Speaker A: Cause bigger problems because we wouldn't like what we heard.
00:14:02.712 - 00:14:07.424, Speaker B: We wouldn't like what we heard. But they're all so smart and they can do math. About five years.
00:14:07.464 - 00:14:08.324, Speaker A: Oh my God.
00:14:08.954 - 00:14:20.690, Speaker B: But that's the predicament all these people find themselves in. And the problem is once inflation's an issue, it's only going to get worse.
00:14:20.802 - 00:14:21.834, Speaker A: They have to act on it.
00:14:21.874 - 00:14:22.786, Speaker B: They have to.
00:14:22.970 - 00:14:27.882, Speaker A: Yeah, that's why it's higher for longer. It's real. No cuts. No cuts are coming anytime soon.
00:14:27.898 - 00:14:30.722, Speaker B: No cuts. You got short rates.
00:14:30.778 - 00:14:34.298, Speaker A: They're basically off the table. Long dollar, we talked about two. Yeah, we did.
00:14:34.386 - 00:14:37.542, Speaker B: Short rates like short stocks, like long dollar.
00:14:37.678 - 00:14:41.638, Speaker A: Bimnet, this is great. It's just getting more interesting.
00:14:41.726 - 00:14:48.102, Speaker B: Yeah. Honestly, I want to dedicate an episode to just, we got fiscal dominant. We need to do fiscal central bank bullshit.
00:14:48.198 - 00:14:52.334, Speaker A: Sorry. Bimnet of BB Galaxy trading, my friend. Thank you so much.
