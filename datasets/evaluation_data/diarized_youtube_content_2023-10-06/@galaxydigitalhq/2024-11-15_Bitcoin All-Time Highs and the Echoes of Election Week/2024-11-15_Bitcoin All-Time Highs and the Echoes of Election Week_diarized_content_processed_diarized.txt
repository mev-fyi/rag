00:00:08.440 - 00:00:13.617, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome back to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:13.761 - 00:00:14.921, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:15.073 - 00:00:39.913, Speaker A: What an exciting time. It's now one week since the election and we, I think we, we recorded right after the election. So this is our second episode with a President Elect Trump. We now have a unified Congress. The House has been called right in favor of the Republicans. Obviously we're going to talk about cryptos which have been outperforming among all asset classes. First though, today there were CPI numbers.
00:00:39.913 - 00:00:42.065, Speaker A: Just what were they and where do we stand?
00:00:42.105 - 00:01:20.165, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean they were smack DAB in line 0.3 month on month for core CPI. The market viewed it as a benign number. You saw twos rally, you know, from like 435 to 425 in yield. And you've sold back off since you had a little bit more pricing put into the December FOMC. So you know, as we speak it's around 20 basis points and the Jan FOMC has about 27 basis points price. So basically over the next two meetings, one cuts expected, most likely 80% chance of one in December.
00:01:20.165 - 00:02:20.355, Speaker B: And I think basically what this price action tells you is that folks were a little bit worried about an upside surprise in inflation. But to be honest, what we should really care about is the forward on inflation and forward expectations of inflation. As we've said numerously on this podcast, Trumponomics is fundamentally inflationary. His main three objectives with the economy are he wants to deport millions of prime age illegal immigrants, that's going to tighten up the labor force. He wants to put tariffs on some of our trade partners, that's again inflationary and cutting taxes as well as pro cyclical and pro growth. And so these three pillars of his policy should net be inflationary. And so I think that's really what the market should be focused on.
00:02:20.355 - 00:02:58.083, Speaker B: And we do have some seasonal effects that should push inflation a bit higher over the next, call it four to six months. And so if you really digest all of that, I still think there's a conceivable path for rates to go higher. I think tens can go to close to 5% versus 440 right now. So I think there's still a really decent repricing of the fixed income curve that you can have over the course of the next couple of months. And as you get into like realizing like what Trump's policies are actually gonna be interesting.
00:02:58.139 - 00:03:21.369, Speaker A: So let's switch to crypto and bitcoin because I mean, please, you can look here at the block clock. Bitcoin is trading at 92 7, $92,720. According to the block clock. We've hit almost 93. I think we might have even hit 93. I mean, we are a stone's throw from $100,000 bitcoin. What's driving the increase is a rhetorical.
00:03:21.417 - 00:04:12.983, Speaker B: Question, but yeah, I mean, well, I think a lot of it is based on expectations of a friendlier administration coming into power. On the back of that, we've seen tremendous inflows into the ETF products. We've also seen a pretty sizable pickup in leverage across all futures and perps exchanges. And there's been consistent buy pressure in the US from large players. And so I would say it's a lot more buyers than sellers. And it had a technical breakout and folks are chasing it. And there's a lot of FOMO in the market and it's in price discovery fundamentally.
00:04:12.983 - 00:04:50.325, Speaker B: And what's the price of something? It's the price that people are willing to pay and every day it seems to be going higher and higher. So I think there's a lot of folks that are now being stopped into bitcoin where if you're an institution, you're looking at it, it's trading like tens of billions of dollars a day. There's an etf, it's liquid, it's a Trump play. It's akin to gold. It hedges you from monetary debasement in theory acts like a risk asset, basically. It's really hard for any institution to ignore. I don't care who you are.
00:04:50.325 - 00:05:00.275, Speaker B: But when you see price action like this, it forces you to pay attention. And quite frankly, it's pretty simple. If you're not long, you're short.
00:05:00.355 - 00:05:32.283, Speaker A: Yeah, it feels like risk is to the upside. Right now we've got a known expected pile of positive catalysts, but they haven't come yet. So we've got very little tangible specifics to work with. And the market seems to just be saying, well, in that case, like I'm just not long enough. Yeah. Or if I have none, like I need to get long this thing because, you know, come. Even if it takes, you know, inaugurations in January, you know, a couple months for xyz, a cabinet nominee to be confirmed by the Senate or regulator to be confirmed by the Senate.
00:05:32.283 - 00:05:44.219, Speaker A: Like once you get out there, I feel like this, it'll be more like headline and sort of on the ground driven. But right now you've just got this period where all you Know, is it's going to be really positive. And so you just, you just have to own it.
00:05:44.267 - 00:05:46.403, Speaker B: You've got a great chart and a great story.
00:05:46.459 - 00:05:46.699, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:46.747 - 00:05:48.275, Speaker B: And that's really all you need in markets.
00:05:48.315 - 00:05:48.819, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:48.947 - 00:05:54.035, Speaker B: And, you know, I would not be surprised if we hit 100k in like the next week or two.
00:05:54.115 - 00:06:04.731, Speaker A: Honestly. I mean, at this rate, it could easily be like tomorrow. Tomorrow. Yeah, this week. I mean, honestly, I mean, you have to assume there'll be some resistance there just from the size of the number.
00:06:04.843 - 00:06:24.057, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, gravity does take hold at some point. And basically, you know, Bitcoin's a 1.7, probably these $1.8 trillion asset, $1.9 trillion asset. And so every 10%, that's like, you know, $190 billion of wealth being created.
00:06:24.057 - 00:06:34.465, Speaker B: And so that's a lot of potential sell pressure. And so definitely at certain levels, you know, gravity. Wow. 93, 300. As we speak, gravity will take hold.
00:06:34.545 - 00:06:34.857, Speaker A: Right.
00:06:34.921 - 00:06:41.729, Speaker B: And folks do sell at big round numbers. And so I would expect there's resistance at 100k.
00:06:41.777 - 00:06:42.521, Speaker A: You have to assume that.
00:06:42.553 - 00:06:44.385, Speaker B: I think that's a fair assumption.
00:06:44.505 - 00:07:01.033, Speaker A: So last sort of question here. You know, there's been a lot of rumors on X and discussion. I know Mike was asked about this on Bloomberg about an hour ago again on Wednesday that we're recording about nation state adoption, whether it's the bitcoin national Bitcoin stockpile.
00:07:01.129 - 00:07:01.449, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:01.497 - 00:07:14.439, Speaker A: Which is what, you know, President elect Trump called it in Nashville in July. Or other nations supposedly maybe looking at it like, does it. Could. Could that be it? I mean, I don't know. I'm looking at. You said it.
00:07:14.607 - 00:07:15.647, Speaker B: I mean, I said it at the.
00:07:15.671 - 00:07:18.871, Speaker A: Top, though, that we've been seeing most of this action during US Hours and.
00:07:18.903 - 00:07:19.119, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:19.167 - 00:07:27.975, Speaker A: And overnight us, it's been selling off a bit. And then. So it doesn't feel to me like a foreign nation is the one bidding. Seems more like US investors and US Institutions.
00:07:28.095 - 00:07:46.531, Speaker B: I think if you play bitcoin out over the next 10 years, the game theory probably suggests that you will see nation states, you know, figuring out ways to buy this. Central banks already do this with gold, where they print soft money and buy hard money.
00:07:46.603 - 00:07:47.099, Speaker A: Very.
00:07:47.227 - 00:07:55.635, Speaker B: And so, you know, if you must be nice. But yeah. I mean, if you're thinking about it from that lens, bitcoin's so cheap.
00:07:55.795 - 00:07:56.187, Speaker A: Right.
00:07:56.251 - 00:08:04.141, Speaker B: Like the moment you start to see real nation states accumulate this stuff. Not saying that El Salvador is in a real nation state.
00:08:04.213 - 00:08:05.445, Speaker A: Big, giant size, though.
00:08:05.485 - 00:08:05.965, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:06.085 - 00:08:06.789, Speaker A: You know, the mri.
00:08:06.837 - 00:08:16.005, Speaker B: But again, but Again, it's like one of those things where if you are doing that, that means that you're conceding the fact that your money's not really good money.
00:08:16.085 - 00:08:16.461, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:16.533 - 00:08:18.585, Speaker B: And so it's really.
00:08:19.365 - 00:08:31.389, Speaker A: This has been. I agree with this. I think if the US is to do this, it's gotta be very careful in how they narrative this. Right. Like we, we haven't bought anything to back the dollar in decades.
00:08:31.437 - 00:08:33.267, Speaker B: Yes. It's backed by the full faith.
00:08:33.341 - 00:08:49.711, Speaker A: Right. And if you have to buy. But I think this is why he called it a strategic stockpile, not a reserve. I think there are ways to get something done. And to be clear, if other nations think we're going to do something like this and they start front running and trying to do it, then we really should do it. That game theory is powerful.
00:08:49.823 - 00:08:57.151, Speaker B: It's super powerful. But if I'm a country that respects my own currency, I wouldn't back it with.
00:08:57.183 - 00:09:01.395, Speaker A: I've said if you were to back your currency with toothpicks, it would harm your currency's value.
00:09:01.725 - 00:09:04.901, Speaker B: But, but you could definitely see a lot of like em nations or like.
00:09:05.013 - 00:09:09.245, Speaker A: That's right. Or like sovereign wealth funds rather than central banks. Like there's ways.
00:09:09.325 - 00:09:09.861, Speaker B: There are ways.
00:09:09.893 - 00:09:15.981, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, well my friend Bimnet ab, I'll let you get back to it. Bimnet from Galaxy Digital Trading. Thank you so much.
00:09:16.053 - 00:09:16.445, Speaker B: Thanks for having.
