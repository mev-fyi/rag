00:00:06.680 - 00:00:11.734, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, my friend, great to see you.
00:00:11.854 - 00:00:12.958, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:13.086 - 00:00:19.222, Speaker A: It's like we could literally. I try to say it the exact same way each time, and you say, thanks for having me, everybody.
00:00:19.238 - 00:00:20.518, Speaker B: What else am I supposed to say?
00:00:20.646 - 00:00:22.074, Speaker A: We gotta do a montage.
00:00:22.494 - 00:00:23.286, Speaker B: Oh, boy.
00:00:23.350 - 00:00:32.354, Speaker A: Well, good to see you, man. Nicer. You know, I guess right now we're down a little bit. You know, viewers of the YouTube channel can see the block clock. 29. Three. You know, it seems fine.
00:00:32.354 - 00:00:49.794, Speaker A: A little bit of a minor deleveraging. I think we saw ETH was below two k. I think it might be back around two k, like we're updating now. 23, 29. 335 on bitcoin, $5 higher. Anything to that? Just before we get into other stuff.
00:00:50.414 - 00:01:22.512, Speaker B: The sell off today really started when you got a surprise print on UK inflation. At surprise, which was higher, and you got a repricing of the UK curve. Basically took terminal rates in UK market to, like, 491, and in the US, they're a little over five. So UK has got an inflation problem. The market was like, it's got a worse inflation problem. It's worse than ing and worsening, and when you're still surprising, higher than high estimates, it's bad.
00:01:22.608 - 00:01:25.224, Speaker A: That's not what we're doing. In the US, we've been, like, flat.
00:01:25.264 - 00:01:33.184, Speaker B: Or slightly lower coming in line, but the data's headed in the right direction. Depending on how you slice and dice it, there's something for everyone.
00:01:33.304 - 00:01:34.048, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:01:34.176 - 00:02:11.790, Speaker B: So it's a little bit tricky. But what I do know for sure is that people are really bad at forecasting inflation. And so I think what you're supposed to do is just react to the data as it comes in. But back to our original point, you had this surprise print, and it caused the market to sell off. Equities moved a little bit lower. Dollar actually caught a bid, and you had crypto sell off when it was dead close to trend highs. Bitcoin was at 30,200, a couple hundred points from literally pico, top of the trend, and it was poor liquidity, and then liquidations begun.
00:02:11.790 - 00:02:26.806, Speaker B: So you had about 200, 250 million in liquidations go through into a thin market with broader risk markets selling off, and now you're back down to 29%. Three. But again, it's like, what is this, a sell off for ants?
00:02:26.870 - 00:02:28.518, Speaker A: Yeah, it seems fine for a crypto.
00:02:28.566 - 00:02:32.854, Speaker B: Person that lived through the last year. I mean, I was like, right, thirty.
00:02:32.894 - 00:02:36.382, Speaker A: K to twenty nine. Three is like, we're still in the same sort of range anyway.
00:02:36.438 - 00:03:30.070, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, for me, you know, I'm looking at a market that's clearly trending. Right? What's clearly, by what I mean, what I mean when I say clearly trending is you've consistently set higher and higher lows and higher and higher highs, and it respects things like trend lines, etcetera. And for me right now, bitcoin is still trending higher, but it did lose some momentum at the highs just today. I think if you think about it, it takes a lot of conviction to buy an asset up 80% on the year. You have to be very convinced for to add to your position at those highs. And so I think it's natural that we get a little bit of a pause, a relief here, if you just think about it. We spent a couple of weeks around twenty eight k, and then we broke out.
00:03:30.070 - 00:04:01.724, Speaker B: So it wouldn't shock me if we were going to consolidate for the next couple of weeks. I think a couple of things that are notable is you haven't really had a huge bid in volume or volumes, haven't really spiked that much in the options market. And so what that tells me is that people aren't scrambling to buy crash protection. Right. So it's not like, oh, we're worried that bitcoin is going to go back through twenty five k, twenty k again. It's more like, okay, you know, we've sold off a little bit, but it's not really a need. There's no real need to panic.
00:04:01.804 - 00:04:02.796, Speaker A: So there's no fear.
00:04:02.940 - 00:04:03.444, Speaker B: No fear.
00:04:03.484 - 00:04:06.052, Speaker A: It's more just in a range, in.
00:04:06.068 - 00:04:15.804, Speaker B: A range following macro overnight, following macro liquidity liquidations. And so that's kind of what it is. I'd say more noise than signal is the best way I would interpret that.
00:04:15.844 - 00:04:28.484, Speaker A: So let's move on from the crypto stuff, because really we're making a whole few minutes outside of not really that impact move. I did see a large tech company is partnering with a large bank to offer a high yield savings account.
00:04:28.564 - 00:04:29.584, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:04:30.244 - 00:04:31.708, Speaker A: Now that's a bank account.
00:04:31.876 - 00:04:32.316, Speaker B: Correct.
00:04:32.380 - 00:04:42.892, Speaker A: Through a nice tech platform giving near 4% or 4.15. So that's competitive with a lot of the money markets and stuff.
00:04:42.988 - 00:04:43.492, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:04:43.548 - 00:05:25.042, Speaker A: How do you think about, because I've said this before, I don't actually have a bank account. As a longtime fidelity employee, to the extent I need to access fiat services, I have typically used my Fidelity accounts, which, you know, they have all the services check gatewire. I mean, it's basically a bank except it's not. And so I wonder. But I can buy things, of course, in those accounts that I can't buy in a bank account, like securities or fixed income products or money market funds, which have been yielding the highest, I would say, of any cash instrument. How do you think about bank deposits versus money market funds in general, like, the trends? I don't know, whatever. Like, I mean, why would anyone be at a bank at this point? I mean, I hate to say that I'm not trying to spark any kind.
00:05:25.058 - 00:06:23.208, Speaker B: Of fear, but it's like, that's exactly the question folks should be asking themselves. Like, why am I at a bank that is paying me substandard yields in a world where the treasury secretary and the Fed basically told you, we're going to insure all deposits, right? We're going to create blanket facilities to, you know, that you can post securities at par and get all this financing for term. And so basically, no banks going under. They might screw equity holders, but deposit holders are safe, and that's coming from senior people in the government. And so if you're telling me I have a blanket guarantee on all deposits, why wouldn't I go to the institution paying me the highest interest rate? Why do I need to be at one of the GSIBs earning like, sub 50 basis points when this company we just mentioned is offering 4.15 and those deposits are basically guaranteed? I don't own stock in that bank. I'm a depositor.
00:06:23.208 - 00:06:32.456, Speaker B: And so what you're having happen, or what I think is about to happen, is a level of competition for deposits that has never been seen.
00:06:32.560 - 00:06:33.136, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:06:33.200 - 00:06:38.076, Speaker B: And it is going to be catalyzed by the fact that technology is better than it's ever been.
00:06:38.140 - 00:06:44.692, Speaker A: Right? So fintechs, other big tech companies, partnering with whomever they might need to correct, to bring it directly where consumers are.
00:06:44.748 - 00:06:55.284, Speaker B: Able to move money from one deposit institution to another in seconds. Right? That means that the competition for deposits is frictionless, essentially.
00:06:55.364 - 00:07:09.964, Speaker A: Right, right. It's not like the Bailey savings and loan, where you gotta squeeze through the door and they're like, I was making this joke before about the bank runs when they were happening, right? When he's like, they're like, we need our money back. George Bailey. Right? And he's like, the money's not here. It's like in Frank driveway and like Peter's house.
00:07:10.004 - 00:07:11.624, Speaker B: Steven's got a good voice for that.
00:07:12.924 - 00:07:26.364, Speaker A: But in those old fashioned bank runs, you just squeeze through the door. If you were like, right now already, SVB, I think, was like the fastest collapse ever, because of wires and mobile banking and whatnot. But I mean, fundamentally even more so.
00:07:26.484 - 00:08:00.704, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, and just to take back, not that I'm a critic of central bankers, but when they were thinking about what the consequences were of jacking up rates this quickly, this high, they fundamentally misunderstood what banks held in their balance sheet and how quickly deposits moved in the context of deposit marketplace. And I think they're dramatically underestimating it now, too. Six months from now, people like you're going to have such intense competition for rates, I bet you those GSIB rates are going to be significantly higher.
00:08:00.784 - 00:08:01.184, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:08:01.224 - 00:08:33.274, Speaker B: And what does that mean? That means their interest rate margins, their nims are going to go down. And that is because, again, you have a blanket guarantee from the government that all deposits are safe. So why am I not in the bank, at least with my portion of my deposits, that I don't need to move to some random country where one bank only has access, et cetera, but on anything that's excess, you should be in the highest possible yield because there's no burden or hindrance to moving that money around frictionless.
00:08:33.614 - 00:08:35.006, Speaker A: And you got fed now coming out.
00:08:35.030 - 00:08:36.598, Speaker B: Too, which fed now, theoretically.
00:08:36.646 - 00:08:43.318, Speaker A: I mean, that's more glue on the interbank side rather than absolutely, but that should make everything move faster. Also, it's going to come out this summer.
00:08:43.406 - 00:09:14.764, Speaker B: And then now, though, you start to get into a scenario which I don't think the Fed has properly anticipated, which is six months down the line, it's going to be highest interest rate deposit institutions win the most. But what is actually happening to reserves in the market six months from now? You're going to have six more months of quantitative tightening. Right. You're going to have a TGA balance that's going to go from 99 billion to. That's the treasury general account. That's the bank account for the treasury. It's really low right now because of the debt ceiling.
00:09:15.424 - 00:09:16.448, Speaker A: They're out of money, basically out of.
00:09:16.456 - 00:09:27.120, Speaker B: Money, but they're going to get money soon. But where does that money come from? That money comes from a banking system. So anytime that treasury account goes up, that is money being drained from the banking system. So you have QT.
00:09:27.192 - 00:09:28.568, Speaker A: They're not printing money for that, right?
00:09:28.616 - 00:09:28.984, Speaker B: Correct.
00:09:29.064 - 00:09:30.204, Speaker A: Normal allocation.
00:09:30.804 - 00:09:31.276, Speaker B: Correct.
00:09:31.340 - 00:09:34.708, Speaker A: That is, yeah, yeah, yeah. So QT. And that will suck more out, too.
00:09:34.756 - 00:09:59.676, Speaker B: That will suck more out. And then get this, you still are dealing with the credit crunch impact of Silicon Valley, right. And the et cetera folks are going to be lending at higher standards. Right. And at higher rates etcetera. And so you're going to have a credit impulse and a lot of shitty institutions, or bad institutions or small ones, et cetera, are non competitive institutions. Non competitive institution.
00:09:59.676 - 00:10:06.476, Speaker B: Imagine you bought a bunch of 30 year duration at the dead lows and yields, and you're not going to be able to pay the highest interest rate possible, right?
00:10:06.500 - 00:10:13.164, Speaker A: So you're going to be much less attractive. You're going to have less money to lend. So small businesses are going to. That portends a lot of tightening.
00:10:13.284 - 00:10:23.932, Speaker B: It's a lot of tightening. And then throw in what we know about the back half of the year, which is, wait, activity is going to slow, right? Like unemployment might start ticking up back then.
00:10:23.988 - 00:10:30.264, Speaker A: You have less small business lending. If the regional banks can't, they're going to be squeezed harder than the GSIBs and the money center banks.
00:10:30.644 - 00:11:00.272, Speaker B: We've talked about it before, right? So there's a strange combination of things that can, like, start to happen in the back half of the year. And I think it's totally like, misunderstood by the market. And honestly, it's a little concerning right now to me. Like, I'm a bank money market person. But stating the facts, the fact pattern is about as bad as possible. Listen to this. You've got about $160 billion between two emergency fed facilities right? Now.
00:11:00.272 - 00:11:26.998, Speaker B: You've had two banks that have had to get taken over by the FDIC. Another one that needed $30 billion in deposits from the largest institutions. Point blank. Our banking system is in crisis and is being masked by the FDIC and these fuck. And these blanket facilities. But nobody cares because it's like, wait, there's just another random fed facility, billions of dollars. The average retail person doesn't care.
00:11:26.998 - 00:11:57.744, Speaker B: But what people don't fail to realize is the US was on the brink of a systemic wide banking crisis and they're able to gloss it over with a discount window facility at a BTFP. But think about this. The idea that the most influential central bankers in the world miscalculated their monetary policy to the extent that it put the entire US banking system at risk, right? Where is the accountability anyway?
00:11:57.864 - 00:11:58.488, Speaker A: Fascinating.
00:11:58.576 - 00:12:01.164, Speaker B: I could literally rant on this for a while.
00:12:02.344 - 00:12:14.416, Speaker A: It is wild. It's truly wild. Right? We said, I was calling whipsaw monetary policy last summer. Cut as fast as possible. Crap. Hike as fast as possible. It's wild.
00:12:14.520 - 00:12:37.924, Speaker B: It's a really hard job and I respect them for doing it. And I don't necessarily know if I would ever want that job or do as well at that job. But you have to realize that bank balance sheets aren't that hard to understand. Yes, I get it. There's 4800 of them in the US. A lot of them, but they're not that hard. And there's clearly a lack of proper diligence in this space.
00:12:38.264 - 00:12:52.726, Speaker A: I've seen people and some policymakers pointing to the fact that only two had to be taken over. It's not that big a deal. And you're like, dude, that's only because they essentially offered to just give everyone money for free in order to stem it. If they hadn't. I mean, if there wasn't that discount window.
00:12:52.830 - 00:12:53.550, Speaker B: Discount window.
00:12:53.582 - 00:12:55.062, Speaker A: Or the special facility.
00:12:55.158 - 00:12:56.814, Speaker B: Yeah, BFP, whatever.
00:12:56.894 - 00:13:00.766, Speaker A: We don't know. I mean, we haven't looked at all 4800 either. But many banks would be under.
00:13:00.830 - 00:13:02.334, Speaker B: Oh, many, many, many.
00:13:02.454 - 00:13:02.806, Speaker A: Why?
00:13:02.870 - 00:13:15.274, Speaker B: But now, think about this, though. The largest institutions now as a function of this banking crisis are now, like, they've lost a pretty big competitive advantage. And so, like.
00:13:15.784 - 00:13:18.120, Speaker A: Oh, you mean the sort of the too big to fail?
00:13:18.152 - 00:13:18.944, Speaker B: Like, too big to fail.
00:13:18.984 - 00:13:20.800, Speaker A: Now, if everyone's kind of backstopped, so.
00:13:20.832 - 00:13:24.264, Speaker B: Small, you can't fail. I don't know how to come up like, what's the counter?
00:13:24.304 - 00:13:41.754, Speaker A: And, you know, the treasury secretary, I remember there was a viral clip when Janet Yellen was in Congress a month ago or so, was asked this by a congressperson about their own local. Actually was, I think it was maybe when she was in front of the Senate. So a senator about their own local small bank, would that also be covered? And she was sort of like, meh, meh. No, but, like, when we.
00:13:41.794 - 00:13:41.946, Speaker B: Like.
00:13:41.970 - 00:13:46.514, Speaker A: So they're kind of saying we haven't backstopped the whole thing, but we kind of know they have.
00:13:46.674 - 00:13:52.570, Speaker B: But here's their angle, is we've backstopped it, but we're only backstopping the depositors, not the equity holders.
00:13:52.602 - 00:13:53.234, Speaker A: That's what they have said.
00:13:53.274 - 00:13:54.922, Speaker B: Right. And so they're, you know, you run.
00:13:54.938 - 00:14:00.498, Speaker A: A bad bank, you're gonna lose all your money. Like, as the owner of the bank. Yes, but if you're just a humble depositor.
00:14:00.586 - 00:14:03.834, Speaker B: Yeah. So they're saying, you know, they're giving the middle finger to the stockholder.
00:14:03.874 - 00:14:08.178, Speaker A: But that was something that depositors. Your point at GSIBs? Right. The biggest banks.
00:14:08.226 - 00:14:08.482, Speaker B: Right.
00:14:08.538 - 00:14:22.326, Speaker A: Literally, the book too big to fail about those banks during the great financial crisis, it's been long understood and implied and believed by the market that they were too big to fail, that if those faced crisis, they would absolutely be backstopped and.
00:14:22.390 - 00:14:22.990, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:14:23.062 - 00:14:25.574, Speaker A: And that was a competitive advantage for them. That's really interesting.
00:14:25.654 - 00:14:30.434, Speaker B: Yeah. But now I'm like, why do I need an account at any of these?
00:14:30.734 - 00:14:32.126, Speaker A: Go wherever the yield's highest.
00:14:32.230 - 00:14:35.390, Speaker B: Go wherever the yield's highest because it's guaranteed by the government.
00:14:35.462 - 00:14:40.594, Speaker A: Very interesting. Bimnet a BB, my friend, as always, from galaxy trading. Thank you so much. Pleasure.
