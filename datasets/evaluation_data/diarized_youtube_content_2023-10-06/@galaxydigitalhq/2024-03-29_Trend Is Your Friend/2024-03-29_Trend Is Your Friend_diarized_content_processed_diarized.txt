00:00:08.039 - 00:00:12.918, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:13.046 - 00:00:14.194, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:14.814 - 00:00:33.768, Speaker A: I'm not there. We took a week off last week. You were off? I was traveling. I still am. But there was big news last week. It was a Fed day last Wednesday and rates were unchanged. But even from far away I heard rumors that there was more dovish than expected, maybe language or something.
00:00:33.768 - 00:00:35.904, Speaker A: Why don't you tell us what happened last week? Yes.
00:00:35.944 - 00:01:30.604, Speaker B: So the big focus going into the Fed last week was the dot plot. And a lot of market participants had expected the 2024 dots to go down from three cuts to two cuts. And so when that didn't happen, the market perceived that as dovish. Even though the Fed did upgrade their growth forecasts and the dots further out, the curve moved higher. However, the market most closely latched onto the 2024 dots because that's immediate monetary policy. In addition, I would say Powell was fairly dovish. During his press conference, he dismissed things like the equity market and some of the froth in financial markets.
00:01:30.604 - 00:02:38.624, Speaker B: He reiterated the fact that he thought financial conditions were tight right now, even though I don't think that they're really that tight. And he stuck to the script and he thinks that it's feasible that they still cut three times this year. I personally, in the face of the strong data we've had, especially recently around CPU PPI, I would not have taken such a dovish stance. And I think a lot of market participants didn't expect them to be as dovish as he was. Because realistically you can make an argument that you don't need to cut at all this year. In fact, the day after FOMC, or on Friday after FOMC, Bostic, another Fed member, came out and said he only saw one cut happening this year. And so as the economy develops, I mean, just think about this, they lowered their unemployment forecast and they increased their growth forecast and yet they're still cutting the same amount.
00:02:38.924 - 00:02:39.284, Speaker A: Right.
00:02:39.324 - 00:03:17.658, Speaker B: Even though data is hot and they've literally had to adjust their forecast because of how hot the data has been. And yet we're still talking about the same number of cuts. And I think it's, it's really foolhardy. What you're seeing in goods inflation is some signs of revival. Oil prices have started to climb. I don't know if you've seen charts of cocoa prices recently, things of that nature. A lot of it's structural because you can't really go much lower in terms of prices high level.
00:03:17.658 - 00:03:58.178, Speaker B: I think there are upside risks to goods inflation and services inflation is already pretty hot. And so I genuinely think that the Fed shouldn't be as dovish as they are. And then from the level of like, what have we really done over the past couple of years? Prices are still up a lot. In aggregate, the price level of goods has been way higher than the 2% inflation rate that folks were being told. If a cup of coffee is now $4 at your local Starbucks, that was $2.02 years ago. Just because it's only going from four dollars to four dollars.
00:03:58.178 - 00:04:37.364, Speaker B: Fifteen cents in this year, people are like, and fed members are like, oh, we've dramatically cooled inflation. Yeah. At the end of the day, what have you really done? And that's facilitated one of the largest bouts of inflation that we've had in modern history. And has that really been addressed? Will it ever be addressed? Are incomes keeping up fast enough for the price level of goods? I don't know. And it's also a tale of two halves. Anybody with assets in financial markets is feeling pretty good. Stock markets are all time highs, home prices are, are keeping up.
00:04:37.364 - 00:04:46.136, Speaker B: And so, you know, but yet if you're living paycheck to paycheck, like, it's, it's, you know, it's a much different world.
00:04:46.280 - 00:05:13.464, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. It does seem like cutting doesn't make a ton of sense when it, when assets are at all time highs and unemployment's doing okay. Right. I mean, I know you're on the sort of, in the last few months, you've turned sort of the hawkish side of this, which has been really interesting. Let's talk quickly about a little bit more global macro. I saw a headline that said the Japanese yen dropped to the lowest value against the dollar in, I don't know, I think it said since 1990. So that would be like 35 years.
00:05:13.464 - 00:05:23.144, Speaker A: What does that mean? What's going on in Japan? Did they abandon yield curve control? What's happening over there? Third or fourth largest economy in the world?
00:05:23.484 - 00:06:11.140, Speaker B: It depends if you group the EU together, but yeah, third largest economy in the world. And I guess fourth if you loop in the EU and China. So it's a pretty big deal. And it's even more important from the standpoint that they were the only central bank, at least in g ten markets that hadn't lifted off from zero or negative, actually. And so what the BOJ did was basically end this huge experiment in monetary easing recently, and they are abandoning ETF purchases, they're raising the overnight rate back to zero. And they have already widened out the band of where back end JGB rates can trade. Don't get it twisted.
00:06:11.140 - 00:07:10.614, Speaker B: They still have pretty easy monetary policy, but they announced a pretty big shift, and that was a natural reaction to some of the things they were seeing. Literally this month you've had huge concessions by large companies to their labor unions in Japan. And so wage inflation has been a pretty hot figure in Japan. And then generally their economy's been doing well, super low unemployment, and so they're starting to see prices pick up. They reacted and got off of zero, and that was a big deal because generally when you get off of zero, you're sending a pretty strong signal to the market that you're going to react to positive price pressure, because that's what central banks are supposed to do. And so it was a pretty big deal for them to shift, but it was well communicated. And the currency only continued to depreciate after, basically.
00:07:10.614 - 00:07:32.034, Speaker B: And so now, given the huge interest rate differentials that still exist between VoJ, the ECB and the Fed, and basically every central bank on the planet, the yen, is going to continue to depreciate unless the BOJ gets more aggressive in monetary policy or that there's actually some form of currency intervention.
00:07:32.374 - 00:07:58.734, Speaker A: All right, real quick, before we. I know, market's about to open. We're recording this on Wednesday, March 27, before us market open. I just want to ask you, Ben, when I left two weeks ago for vacation, we had just started a drop below seventy k to this correction that we've had. I think saw about 17,000. Sorry, 17% bitcoin price decline. We're back at like 71 and a half now.
00:07:58.734 - 00:08:11.214, Speaker A: Maybe by the time I get back to New York next week, will we be like it never happened? What's that last two weeks been like in crypto markets for you, in your mind? And does any of this matter? Is this just some short term noise?
00:08:12.364 - 00:08:53.096, Speaker B: I genuinely think that it's just short term noise. The flows we've seen are still pretty substantial. Bitcoin is an asset class that's here to stay. Risk markets and risk assets are trading super well, especially things like fiat, the basement hedges like gold. I think that's a good risk environment. The fundamentals, are there more platforms bringing on the bitcoin ETF's, more reputable institutions playing and forcing other players to come in? I think you'll see some of that after 13 f filings. There's a pathway to options getting listed on the ETF as well.
00:08:53.096 - 00:09:49.686, Speaker B: And more and more markets are opening up to the bitcoin ETF. And so I think this adoption story is one that continues and the price action that you've had recently testing 60k or 61 and change a bunch of moving average supports and bouncing right back is highly constructive. It shows that it's an asset that's well supported and it's an asset that's becoming more institutionalized because as we know institutions are generally dip buyers. And yeah you've had some healthy developments. BlackRock launching that on chain money market fund and generally ETH commentary hasn't been that great. And you guys, Galaxy Retouch has a great piece talking about that but in alts memes are still trading well and stuff. So I think this is a healthy market.
00:09:49.686 - 00:09:54.678, Speaker B: It just went through a correction but it's likely going to continue to trend higher. Trend is your friend.
00:09:54.846 - 00:09:59.362, Speaker A: Yeah. There you go. Mnet Abibi, my friend from Galaxy trading, thank you so much.
00:09:59.458 - 00:10:00.394, Speaker B: Pleasure. Thanks for having me.
