00:00:02.760 - 00:01:13.550, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. I'm back with another rap I never need jerk, yo I never rest when I rap in jest and I make a song we've got a guest from out west named Caitlin Long, but before we start this, we'll talk markets bim net my dog, he'll take the fog out and parse it the corn might be down but I don't clown with my cash cause I'll be stacking sats till my body turns to ash but before we begin, please refer to the link on the podcast notes and note that none of the information shared during this podcast represents an offer or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital. We have an awesome show today. As I said, we have Caitlin Long, the founder and CEO of Custodia Bank, a Wyoming special purpose depository institution, on the show to talk about FTX's collapse, banking and property rights as it relates to digital assets, crypto contagion, and much more. A wide ranging conversation with Caitlin you do not want to miss. We also have Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Digital trading, as always, to talk about markets and what he sees out there.
00:01:13.550 - 00:01:38.366, Speaker A: And my friend Christine Kim and I will talk about crypto news, some interesting stuff happening in the Ethereum ecosystem, an interesting lawsuit filed by an investment firm against Grayscale, the issuer of GBTC, and much more. I've already read the disclaimer, so I think we're ready to get right into it. Let's do this. Welcome Bibnet, a BB, my friend from Galaxy Digital trading. Great to have you here as always.
00:01:38.510 - 00:01:39.974, Speaker B: Thank you so much for having me.
00:01:40.054 - 00:01:56.430, Speaker A: So, you know, has there been anything big happening in markets? I saw some sell off in the equity markets a little bit. It's been a little rough, but not compared to some of the other weeks that we've covered over this on this show hasn't seemed too notable. Maybe I'm wrong. What are you saying?
00:01:56.502 - 00:03:09.494, Speaker B: Yeah, the equity move has been sort of reasonable. It's not like a huge sell off like you've had in certain periods of this year, but you've had some pretty remarkable moves in other markets, starting with energy. Crude's gone from like $82 a barrel to $72 this week alone. You've had treasury yields fluctuate a lot, but today they're taking out a pretty huge support level at 350 in yield, and you're trading around 344 right now, but that was versus a high of 420 and ten, I want to say, about two months ago. So what you've had over the past ten weeks to two months is a pretty huge rally in duration and in fixed income, pretty reasonable sell off in commodity markets like energy, oil. And so what that broadly represents is an unwind of the inflation trait. The question is, can it continue? And that's really a function of Fed policy and where the data comes in.
00:03:09.494 - 00:04:13.520, Speaker B: The biggest thing week over week that we've had in terms of data developments was non farm payrolls that came in really strong and also average hourly earnings that are fairly robust. Those data points basically told you the labor market's incredibly tight and that it's likely going to push the Fed to keeping rates higher for longer. Not necessarily that the Fed would take it much higher than where terminal rates are priced now. So right now the market's trying to balance growth and economic conditions, which they expect to slow down as a function of tight financial conditions that the Fed has instilled. The still strong aspects of the US economy. In my head, as long as people are employed in the US and there's a tight labor market and people are still getting wage increases. I just got a headline of a large energy company giving all of its employees 9% raises.
00:04:13.632 - 00:04:14.324, Speaker A: Wow.
00:04:16.064 - 00:04:35.664, Speaker B: There's still huge price pressures in wages and a really strong labor market. And home prices aren't moving that much. And so I really do think that until you get the labor market to crack, you're not really going to get the inflation headed in the direction you want or moving in the magnitude that you really need it to.
00:04:35.744 - 00:04:41.952, Speaker A: Yeah. So you have like consumer spending won't really go down much. It won't if everybody's making more money or just everyone. I mean, you hate to see it.
00:04:41.968 - 00:04:43.696, Speaker B: Everyone has a job, you don't want to see it.
00:04:43.720 - 00:04:55.184, Speaker A: But if you're bringing in good income, it's hard for you to push yourself to actually stop spending your spend materially less right now. Of course, if you have less money coming in the door, then you will spend less.
00:04:55.304 - 00:05:15.872, Speaker B: The other thing is the US consumer built a pretty healthy savings base during the pandemic. All the COVID relief checks, three checks, the PPP loans, basically you got inflation relief checks in California even, and particularly.
00:05:16.008 - 00:05:21.120, Speaker A: From March 2020 until the early fall, basically everything was closed.
00:05:21.232 - 00:05:53.774, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. And then the other big problem is everybody that was a homeowner got an opportunity to refinance it right around 3% and asset markets just have gone up. You're well above pre COVID levels. And most asset markets, excluding bonds and stuff, people have money saved, they feel wealthy, they're still employed, and they've locked in 30 year mortgages on low three handles.
00:05:53.854 - 00:05:54.614, Speaker A: It's tough not to crack.
00:05:54.654 - 00:06:10.950, Speaker B: How are you going to crack inflation? You still have nine plus million job openings. That's the predicament the Fed is in. But they're also trying to balance things like financial conditions. What happens to the world if the US took interest rates to 6%?
00:06:11.022 - 00:06:12.314, Speaker A: Wrecking ball, right?
00:06:12.994 - 00:06:13.770, Speaker B: Potentially.
00:06:13.842 - 00:06:14.450, Speaker A: Right. One theory.
00:06:14.482 - 00:06:56.440, Speaker B: Yeah, right. But it's also what we've seen historically is that moving too early can almost be as dangerous as not moving high enough. Right. Prior to the volcan era, they had to go on two batches of raising interest rates, and that's because they made the mistake that inflation wasn't persistent. And one of the anecdotes that sticks out to me all year is that I talked to a trader that's based in local markets. He was a brazilian trader, and he's like, the big difference between you Americans and you Europeans that are looking at this market is you guys have never seen inflation for your whole life. You live in Brazil.
00:06:56.440 - 00:07:26.632, Speaker B: Inflation has been a part of your life and entrenched the entirety of your career and existence. What he was essentially getting to is that once inflation gets entrenched, it's really tough to get out of it. And so that's kind of the risk that's on the forefront of the Fed's minds. But at the same time, the real impact of taking asset markets much lower or getting unemployment rates, it's also really bad. It's also really bad.
00:07:26.688 - 00:07:41.728, Speaker A: So is this why the entrenching of inflation, the concept, and we've heard this too, from a lot of folks, is this why some people are saying either recommending that the Fed do change its target from, say, 2% to 5% or predicting that they'll have to? Is that the idea? One, because.
00:07:41.816 - 00:07:42.568, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:07:42.696 - 00:07:58.688, Speaker A: One, because it could be entrenched and thus they may never get back to two. So let's be realistic or separately. But the thing, it's almost like if you say it, it might happen. It's like by saying that they should change to 5%, are they entrenching inflation 5%?
00:07:58.776 - 00:08:00.004, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely.
00:08:00.424 - 00:08:03.464, Speaker A: I mean, if the Fed changed the target, they absolutely would entrench it.
00:08:03.544 - 00:08:55.952, Speaker B: So one of the key things that we have to think about in all of this is the central bank's credibility is perpetually on the line, but really more so than ever in the standpoint that they got the inflation stuff wrong. Had they been more aggressive with tightening monetary policy sooner, we'd have less of a battle right now. And basically they forecast inflation as being transitory and not structural. They got it all wrong, and not just in the US, but everywhere. And so if they start to, you know, move the goalposts with respect to inflation, that's just another hit on their credibility. So that's one concern that I think a lot of market participants are focused on. But I totally agree with you that a feasible sort of end solution for the predicament that we're in is just us accepting higher base levels of inflation.
00:08:55.952 - 00:09:00.168, Speaker B: And the Fed might need to move its target from 2% to 3%, but.
00:09:00.176 - 00:09:08.480, Speaker A: They don't want to do that until it's already entrenched there because they'll guarantee it if they say it now. So it's sort of like, that'll always come last.
00:09:08.592 - 00:10:00.544, Speaker B: But here's kind of the interesting point. I actually haven't looked at break evens today, but right now the market is telling the Fed that if they pursue their policy of 5% terminal rates, that inflation over one year or two years is expected to get to around their two to 3% target, like mid twos or whatever. And historically, those inflation breakages aren't really great predictors of inflation, so I wouldn't take them. But right now, the signals that the Fed's getting from the market is you pursue your policy, you get us to where you told us you'd get to, and you'll likely see inflation come down. And right now it's being more and more supportive. Basically every day this week you've had a different bank CEO tell you you're going into a recession. Over the next six months to a year, the probabilities are really high.
00:10:00.544 - 00:10:13.352, Speaker B: So the market's already baking it in, in a way. But again, really, in my head, I just keep thinking about the fact that people are still paying 3% mortgages and they're not million job openings.
00:10:13.408 - 00:10:14.664, Speaker A: I know that. The stickiness.
00:10:14.784 - 00:10:25.024, Speaker B: The stickiness, yeah. When you don't have enough people working to begin with, like, like, okay, so what if Twitter lays off 75% of their work staff or there's 9 million.
00:10:25.064 - 00:10:26.056, Speaker A: Other jobs they can get.
00:10:26.120 - 00:10:26.672, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:10:26.728 - 00:10:27.960, Speaker A: Right, yeah, I hear that.
00:10:28.032 - 00:10:29.344, Speaker B: Like, does it matter?
00:10:29.424 - 00:10:47.834, Speaker A: All right, lastly, just on anything interesting on crypto, either in relation to macro we've been talking about, or any, anything else that you're following, I mean, it looks to me mostly bitcoin and ETH have been trading in a flat range since last week when we talked in the high 16s, in the twelve s, twelve hundreds for ETH. Anything out there that you're paying attention to?
00:10:49.614 - 00:11:30.034, Speaker B: Crypto is really tough because it's really about the unknowns right now, the fallout from FTX, the fallout from Genesis and DCG, what's likely going to happen there. So we think that there's still stuff that we don't know that's yet to come out that can be a potential catalyst for the market. But at this point, you know, where I think why I think the market is sort of stagnating is because most of the forced buying and for selling has gone through. In the market. You're a forced buyer. If you had Delta, you needed to replace on exchange, you're a forced seller because the volume went up and you're uncomfortable with the risk. That stuff has basically already happened.
00:11:30.034 - 00:11:53.988, Speaker B: So now you're left with long term players in the space and a handful of speculators, and they're really only going to move around their positions based on catalysts. And so when you, in the absence of any catalysts, there's no news. You're just waiting. And so I think that's kind of why bitcoin has stagnated around seventeen k and ETH's been twelve and 1300.
00:11:54.036 - 00:11:55.744, Speaker A: It's like, which way, western? Which way?
00:11:56.084 - 00:11:58.004, Speaker B: There's no near term catalyst.
00:11:58.124 - 00:12:11.774, Speaker A: Well, and there's some that we. To your point, there's some unknowns, but there's also ones that are known unknowns. For example, more information about the FTX creditors or, you know, what happens with Genesis or any of the other bankruptcies or so. Yeah, right. Sort of pinning us.
00:12:11.894 - 00:12:49.118, Speaker B: But again, it's really tough for me to think about crypto and just focus on the liquid side of things. There are so many interesting things going on outside of the liquid market in terms of all of these bankruptcy assets that you could potentially own, businesses that are for sale, additional equity offerings, basis trades and markets, grayscale CME futures and stuff. So there's a huge opportunity set in crypto right now. And for those that are looking to deploy capital, there's lots of creative ways.
00:12:49.166 - 00:12:51.038, Speaker A: And you're saying, particularly outside of spot.
00:12:51.126 - 00:13:29.874, Speaker B: Outside of spot, yeah. Interesting. And at the end of the day, a company that can generate you 15% on capital is a 15% return on capital. It doesn't matter if you're slinging soybeans or you're making machines, it's 15% return on capital. Right. And so I think there's a lot of people that are looking at the crypto space from that standpoint right now, which is very different than, say, a year ago, where it's just like, oh, my God, here's numbers like catapult. Why wouldn't I want to own a meme token? Because there's all these retail gamblers.
00:13:29.914 - 00:13:34.894, Speaker A: The liquid stuff was wild. Yeah. And now we also see a bit of a reversion on things like valuation.
00:13:35.634 - 00:13:37.402, Speaker B: Things are moving closer to fundamentals.
00:13:37.458 - 00:13:50.134, Speaker A: We've heard a lot of big companies, including tradfi banks, say that they're looking through some of these assets in crypto. Could be very interesting over the next. The landscape could look a lot different in a couple of years, as it does today.
00:13:50.174 - 00:14:27.428, Speaker B: No, absolutely. And the regulatory stuff is kind of the most interesting. In a lot of ways, FTX was bad, but in a lot of ways it can be good. Because what we've always thought as crypto participants is that once the regulatory side clears up, once institutions get a path forward in terms of how they can operate in the space, that's really what's going to get people comfortable. So as long as there's a rule base, a rule set that people get comfortable with and they have a clear, it's one regulator or it's just two or something.
00:14:27.516 - 00:14:30.396, Speaker A: And we know what the rules are. Forget what they are, just we know what they are.
00:14:30.460 - 00:14:32.676, Speaker B: We know that the tech wins, the rails are better.
00:14:32.740 - 00:14:33.788, Speaker A: Yeah, we know that for sure.
00:14:33.836 - 00:14:37.100, Speaker B: And so it's really positive in that sense.
00:14:37.172 - 00:14:50.316, Speaker A: Well, that's how, you know, most of the laws and regulations that we have in the US for financial markets, when are they all were all written? It was the securities Act 1930, 419 33. The 40 act. Right.
00:14:50.340 - 00:14:52.420, Speaker B: The 40 act fund solved right after the Great Depression.
00:14:52.452 - 00:15:33.276, Speaker A: Right. So it's very common out of crises to get regulation and, you know, we and everyone else were working to make sure that the regulations are good and promote safety and transparency and, and of course, don't inhibit this great technology and market that we all work in. We'll see a lot more to come on that we still haven't even started the new Congress yet. In fact, actually, I think technically, while the Senate is now firmly flipped into democratic hands at 5149, actually, I believe there is still a couple pathways for democrats to control the House, although it's very unlikely, I don't think it's actually settled yet. Anyway, Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Digital trading, my friend. Thank you, as always. And we'll hook up with you again next week.
00:15:33.360 - 00:15:34.756, Speaker B: Brilliant. Thank you so much.
00:15:34.860 - 00:15:52.620, Speaker A: Christine Kim from Galaxy Research. As always, good to see you. Some stuff going on in crypto this week, plenty of it. Let's chat about some of it. I guess start with I didn't even know this happened, but you were telling me that there was an Ethereum merge data challenge. I guess. What was that? And it's completed.
00:15:52.620 - 00:15:53.908, Speaker A: Then tell me what they found.
00:15:53.996 - 00:16:35.248, Speaker C: Yeah. So right at the time of the merge, the Ethereum foundation opened up this grant program saying that anybody who is analyzing the impacts of the merge on Ethereum would be able to win like 1010s of thousands of dollars. So they've got a bunch of submissions. Really great work, everything from blog posts to full on reports to just GitHub entries looking at validator rewards, mev network security. And only a couple days ago they released all the submissions and the results. So I think there was gold tier, silver tier, and then bronze and some really cool data that was shared.
00:16:35.296 - 00:16:46.312, Speaker A: Anything specifically stand out, like as telling about the kwame? I guess this would be, this is data to show the impact of the merge, basically. Did it go well or what's, you know?
00:16:46.368 - 00:16:53.392, Speaker C: Yeah. So I thought one of the ones that maybe you'll like is that Ethereum has become more decentralized.
00:16:53.488 - 00:16:54.224, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:16:54.344 - 00:16:55.728, Speaker C: Thanks to proof of stake.
00:16:55.816 - 00:17:01.884, Speaker A: How is that true? I'm not saying it isn't true. I'm saying tell me. I know that's okay.
00:17:03.424 - 00:17:08.760, Speaker C: So pre merge, you know, the top 2020 block producers generated 95% of all.
00:17:08.792 - 00:17:10.520, Speaker A: Blocks, and that's what that was. Pools, basically.
00:17:10.552 - 00:17:14.568, Speaker C: So those are mining pools, like large mining pools, dominated block production.
00:17:14.656 - 00:17:15.444, Speaker A: Makes sense.
00:17:15.824 - 00:17:48.696, Speaker C: Post merge, the top 20 block producers has dropped down, generating the percentage blocks has dropped down from 95% pre merge to now 84% of all blocks. Interesting, because we've got builders and we've also got staking pools. And the largest miner, mining pool, like pre merge, had 28.4% block share. And now after the merge, the largest. Oh, I think this is a little typo, but the largest staking pool now has a 23.7% share, which I think is a very great statistic.
00:17:48.696 - 00:18:49.280, Speaker C: It just suggests that we've got more decentralization on the front of block production. And then another interesting one that I thought was really kind of fascinating is that there's no evidence to suggest that large staking pools have a higher rate of return than individual validity. So there was this idea that if you are a large staking pool, then you can do like execute these strategies where like, maybe you can extract more mev than a single validator can, because you know that you're just gonna get a block a higher percentage of the time. And so maybe, you know, your portion of staked ETH becomes, like, disproportionately larger than the amount of rewards that you're getting. It's not like proportional to the amount of stake that you have. But so far, I mean. I mean, of course, it's like we still have to keep analyzing, but so far, it doesn't seem like there is really that much of an advantage.
00:18:49.280 - 00:19:28.204, Speaker C: So I thought that was really cool. And then finally another one was that this is a no brainer, but it's just good for data to suggest it. But block builders are consistently outperforming independent validators. So when validators locally build their block just from the mempool, their rate of return, their block rewards is always smaller than if you were to rely on a third party builder. So, third party builders are just already so specialized, so much better at building profitable blocks than validators are, which I think is a great sign that this idea of validators being as dumb as possible. You just run the software. You don't try and specialize at all.
00:19:28.204 - 00:19:36.972, Speaker C: It really is panning out that's so different from the mining industry, which was all about specialization and competition, leading to centralized outcomes.
00:19:37.028 - 00:19:46.516, Speaker A: Very interesting. How does the censoring block producer landscape look right now? Is it getting better or worse as well? Separately?
00:19:46.620 - 00:19:46.860, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:19:46.892 - 00:20:25.436, Speaker C: So that's also getting a lot better. We're seeing a higher number of non censoring relays. I think the number of non censoring relays now outnumber the number of censoring relays. I think we saw three new ones this week. We had agnostic relay, a relay by ultrasound, and then one other one that I'm forgetting, but we're seeing that the number of blocks being produced by flashbots relay is still the majority. It's still, I want to say, 70%, but it's down over the last couple weeks because these other relays are popping up. So it's not where we want it to be.
00:20:25.436 - 00:20:26.924, Speaker C: But I like that the trend is.
00:20:26.964 - 00:20:35.652, Speaker A: The trend is in the right direction. Let's keep it going. Interesting stuff. I want to dig into some of those submissions on each merge. That's really interesting. Yeah.
00:20:35.668 - 00:20:43.236, Speaker C: It'll be helpful for a potential report that I write about the impact of the merge. It's really great material that's absolutely been.
00:20:43.260 - 00:20:44.804, Speaker A: Published and the crowdsourced.
00:20:44.964 - 00:20:45.356, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:20:45.420 - 00:21:17.656, Speaker A: Okay. So here's a couple other things. One thing I saw that was interesting. I think we talked about this, but Ledger, the maker of the hardware wallets, not the Ledger X, the FTX subsidiary that so ledger hardware wallet manufacturer. And I think they do some institutional custody related stuff as well, maybe as a service or technology. Their CEO told the block they intend to try to go public in the US at some point and that their stuff has been. They've been seeing huge spikes in sales that people are buying hardware wallets.
00:21:17.656 - 00:21:19.136, Speaker A: They're flying off the shelves right now.
00:21:19.240 - 00:21:23.968, Speaker C: I would hope so. I mean, given the outcome of all that's happened in the last couple of weeks.
00:21:24.016 - 00:21:49.694, Speaker A: I agree. Okay, so good on them. We'll see if that happens. There haven't been a lot of companies that have made it through the. Through the needle, as it were, of going public in the US lately, any crypto companies, but Ledger and Trezor, the two largest manufacturers, shout out, by the way, coinkite. That makes the bitcoin hardware wallet. I like the cold card and the block clock, but Ledger and Trez are still the big, big players in the industry.
00:21:49.694 - 00:22:07.846, Speaker A: I think it would be great. I think I've used their devices for a long time and they're good. So congrats on them if they get there. But interesting to see. This is a funny one. You remember the Constitution Dao from, I guess now, a year ago? This was a year ago. I believe that's crazy because we wrote a report.
00:22:07.846 - 00:22:45.450, Speaker A: Saul Kadir on our team wrote a report about daos right around then, and I believe that came out in December of last year. So what was that? The Dow where they raised money and they were going to try to buy an original copy of the US Constitution. I guess the constitution, when it was published, was like handling copied. I'm making this up. I think it was like 40 or so copies were made to distribute to the state so they could all have a copy or whatever. And one of the original ones was up for auction and a Dow formed and I think they raised like 40 plus million dollars. But then they were outbid by Ken Griffith, the CEO of Citadel securities.
00:22:45.562 - 00:22:55.962, Speaker C: You and Saul were in the office when the auction was happening. And do you remember the confusion around who actually was bidding on behalf of Constitution Dao?
00:22:56.018 - 00:23:41.880, Speaker A: Yeah, because a Dao can't, like, pick up the phone and call. Right. This is a really interesting thing about now. There are ways, particularly in places I believe, like Wyoming, which has a very good and interesting law on daos, both that limits the liability of the DAO members, but also gives it, I forget, has a legal mechanism such that a DAO could hire a real life attorney and then they could act on their behalf. But actually, if I recall, this was FTX that was bidding on the DAO's behalf. So they had actually contracted with FTX, I believe, to actually call, I can't remember if it was Christie's or Sotheby's, whichever one it was, but to actually call in and be like, we're the Dow, we're bidding like 22, 23, 24 million. They ended up losing that Dow and then losing that auction.
00:23:41.880 - 00:24:06.282, Speaker A: But then there was some shenanigans where the coins for the Dow went up in value a lot, even though it was useless. They returned the money. But actually, the constitution, dow tokens, like, appreciated significantly, briefly, not even, like super briefly in crypto terms. Like, over a period of days, some people made a lot of money, which is bizarre. They had no purpose and had returned all the money. But. Oh, so I haven't even got there.
00:24:06.282 - 00:24:09.386, Speaker A: So there's, now there's constitution, Dow two.
00:24:09.570 - 00:24:12.138, Speaker C: What's different about this one, they're selling.
00:24:12.186 - 00:24:44.124, Speaker A: Nfts, I guess, to buy, maybe to raise the funds. It says they also want to purchase a rare copy of the US Constitution. This is from the block it was formed out of the last project. So I guess it is the same group or maybe some of the same people. The original one raised 47 million since the auction was at Sotheby's. But this one will buy. Let's see, they're going to raise money selling nfts and then use the money to buy the.
00:24:45.054 - 00:24:47.950, Speaker C: This doesn't sound that different. This seems like a repeat of it.
00:24:48.102 - 00:24:48.406, Speaker D: Okay.
00:24:48.430 - 00:24:57.814, Speaker C: But I remember that after this, there was actually a bunch of development that happened around privacy protocols for daos so that the bids would not be real.
00:24:57.934 - 00:25:02.870, Speaker A: That's one of the big things, because everyone on earth knew exactly theoretically what their max bid was. Yeah.
00:25:02.982 - 00:25:17.314, Speaker C: So I remember there being a privacy service and applications being like, we want to target our product just specifically for daos. And speaking of Daos, please do go check out our awesome report about Daos on galaxy.com dot, because we do have a good.
00:25:18.174 - 00:26:10.574, Speaker A: And this one just is going to. You're right. They're going to partner with Nucleo and Aztec Network, apparently, which are both privacy focused crypto projects, which I guess will hopefully allow them to fund it privately so that the rest of the world doesn't know their max bid. Weird. Interesting stuff, I guess. Lastly, we don't have a lot of time here, but an investment firm, fir tree, is suing grayscale, seeking information from Grayscale and alleging that, I know a bunch of things, grayscale, obviously the issuer or, sorry, the manager of GBTC, the Grayscale bitcoin investment Trust, as well as a bunch of other ones, including an ETH one and a bunch of other really long tail ones. I don't know why, but they're alleging things like, one, that they could open the redemption window at any time, which is sort of opposite of what Grayscale has at least implied.
00:26:10.574 - 00:26:37.870, Speaker A: They're also alleging general, like poor management of the firm and the trust itself, the Grayscale Bitcoin Investment trust. Very interesting lawsuit. So read about it in our newsletter that came out today. We'll cover it more in depth there. But they did. The first line of the suit, I believe, is that the era, it says, the age of unaccountability in digital asset markets is over. Well, gosh, independent of this suit.
00:26:37.870 - 00:26:41.014, Speaker A: Let's hope that's true. But it would be an interesting one to follow.
00:26:41.174 - 00:26:42.154, Speaker C: Definitely.
00:26:43.574 - 00:27:15.496, Speaker A: Quick break for our listeners. We had no poll last week, but thank you to our listeners who emailed us in comments and ideas for the show to researchalaxy.com, which you can do anytime. Also, hit us up on Twitter research this week. We do have a poll. It is pinned to our Twitter profile. The question is, do you think Constitutiondao two will succeed in purchasing a rare copy of the US Constitution? Yes or no? Hit us up again at glxyresearch on Twitter and make your voice heard.
00:27:15.496 - 00:27:35.560, Speaker A: We'll read the results next week. Now back to the show. Welcome Caitlin Long, our guest, the founder and CEO of Custodia Bank, a special purpose depository institution in the state of Wyoming, longtime bitcoiner and advocate for digital assets and quality custody. Kalin, welcome.
00:27:35.752 - 00:27:38.444, Speaker D: Hey, it's great to be here. Good to see you. Thank you.
00:27:39.384 - 00:28:13.524, Speaker A: Yeah, I was really excited to have you on in general, but in particular during this period in the markets, which have been obviously marked by a crisis of credit and contagion. I mean, going back to the spring, but of course now with FTX, which I don't even know, to be honest, if it's fair, certainly credit was related, but it believes, we think theft also related. So I'm really excited to have you on here. Tell us, tell us who you are and what custodia is so that for our audience members who do not know.
00:28:14.384 - 00:29:03.272, Speaker D: Yep. Gosh. Wyoming native, spent almost 30 years in New York, of which 22 were on Wall street in senior roles. Morgan Stanley credits Weiss and then came back home to Wyoming, moved back here three years ago, but a couple years before that, started to work on a legal and regulatory regime to define the legal status of digital assets. It sounds like it's something that's so meaningless, but in fact, actually it's foundational. And what we're learning in the bankruptcies of some of the digital asset intermediaries is that because they happen in states that didn't clarify what is a digital asset, the judges have no roadmap for determining who owns what in the bankruptcy, and it's a mess. And our goal in Wyoming was to forestall that so that this industry had a strong foundation on which to build.
00:29:03.272 - 00:29:15.964, Speaker D: And we're still building it. It's taken longer in some instances because in part, the special purpose depository institutions have been stalled by federal regulators, but it's a solid foundation upon which to build.
00:29:17.664 - 00:29:38.954, Speaker A: Yeah, it's so interesting. You mentioned sort of like the taxonomy or definitions and how important that stuff is. It seems sort of mundane. I think when you're looking at stuff we can do, right, if we're going to write a bill, it's like, let's get to the good stuff. And it's like, whoa, whoa, whoa. We should actually just define what the heck we're even talking about. Yeah.
00:29:38.954 - 00:30:07.684, Speaker A: And then things like control and ownership and etcetera. But has anything stuck out to you? Anything in particular from these various bankruptcies that we've seen? Obviously with FTX, we have blockfi. Those are the new ones. But you had Celsius and Voyager as well. And three AC is also in bankruptcy and probably others that I'm unaware of, but those are the big ones. Has anything in particular stuck out to you of a quirk of law, like you mentioned definitions or something else?
00:30:08.264 - 00:30:27.364, Speaker D: It's not clear who owns what. That's the problem. And that's exactly the problem that Wyoming set out to solve as the boring foundational infrastructure. And most folks think they own the financial assets that they've deposited into a financial institution. And in fact, they don't. What you own is an IOU.
00:30:28.434 - 00:30:42.730, Speaker A: So it's purely an IOU to a credit. I mean, that's why I was going to ask you, like a bank. Like, if I have money in a bank right now, let's say I walk into, you know, any local bank that's not, by the way, my local bank branch, and I deposit a $1,000 in cash. I don't own that money anymore.
00:30:42.762 - 00:31:07.134, Speaker D: You've legally lent it to your bank, just like with your securities, you've legally lent it to your broker dealer, and they owe it back to you. And the terms on which they owe it back to you may vary, whether it's a demand deposit or a savings deposit that they can put a gate around, but you're not legally owning the base property. What you own is a contractual right, not a property. Right. And that has huge implications, especially in the securities industry.
00:31:08.114 - 00:31:19.454, Speaker A: Yeah. And so how does that, when you, when you set out to build custodia, which, again, it's a. It's an SPDI, which is a special purpose depository institution, but. Right. I mean, is it fair to say shorthand, it's a bank? Right? That's a yes.
00:31:20.094 - 00:31:20.878, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:31:21.046 - 00:31:40.974, Speaker A: Yes. Okay, so I'm gonna start calling it a bank for the purposes of this podcast, rather than the legal technical term, which we know, which I've shared. So why then, how does that, how are you addressing that? Or why a bank and not a crypto custodian or a bitcoin custodian, as the ones we know already exist? What is interesting about doing a bank.
00:31:41.094 - 00:32:47.968, Speaker D: For this, it does get at this very foundational question, which is, who owns the assets? And it turns out in most custodians, there was a lot of brouhaha in the spring when the SEC required coinbase to disclose that in bankruptcy, that you might think those assets are yours, but in fact, actually, they're likely to be commingled with everybody else's assets in a bankruptcy. And here's why. When you own a contractual right, one of the first things a bankruptcy judge can do is break a contract. So you may have a contract to segregate your assets with a custodian, but a bankruptcy judge could come in and break that segregation at precisely the moment when you really needed to rely on it. So one of the things about banks and broker dealers in the United States is that they do have special receivership rules that protect the segregation of assets by statute. And Wyoming went a step further with the special purpose depository institutions and said, if the customer chooses a bailment, that it's not even a question of protecting the segregation of the assets. The legal title to the asset never changed hands.
00:32:47.968 - 00:33:24.114, Speaker D: So this is going to blow a few folks minds, because a lot of folks look at crypto and say, not your keys, not your coins, but in fact, actually, you can separate out the title, the legal title to the asset from who controls the private key. And it's the exact same law. It's called bailment. It's a common law term. It's been around for hundreds of years in english common law. And it's the exact same law that applies to valet parking for your car or a coat check. When you park your car at a garage, you're not turning title to the car over to the garage.
00:33:24.114 - 00:33:47.962, Speaker D: You're just giving them temporary possession of it for safekeeping. And they can do one and only one thing, which is park the car in the garage. They can't turn around and take it for a joyride. They can't lend the car uber. Absolutely. You can do one and only one thing, which is what the owner who has the title directs you to do. And it we should be doing this with financial assets.
00:33:47.962 - 00:34:15.974, Speaker D: But due to a quirk of how financial assets got digitized, they started out in paper, the security started out in paper. Then we had the paperwork crisis in the early 1970s, and then it all got dematerialized. And so it became just ledger, just book entries. And then we've now gone to some form of digitization, but we digitized the analog data. We haven't gone to natively digital securities yet. And we're going there. We're going to get there, I'm sure.
00:34:15.974 - 00:34:32.514, Speaker D: But ultimately, what it means is that what you own in your brokerage account, just like what you own in your bank, is an IOU, and that financial intermediary may or may not actually have in its inventory enough to pay you back when you demand it back. That's the problem.
00:34:32.974 - 00:34:45.634, Speaker A: That is so interesting. A great analogy, too, with the, I guess the parking garage. If they go bankrupt as a business and they close their doors, the cars sitting there are not on their balance sheet. They have to get those back to us.
00:34:46.414 - 00:35:20.416, Speaker D: And that is unique to Wyoming with digital assets. We understood in Wyoming that these are bearer instruments. And so we have an opportunity to take these financial assets and turn them into real property. Not real property as in the legal term, but just physical property, tangible property. Exactly. And allow the law of bailment the same thing that applies to the valet parking to apply to your financial asset. It's what used to be the law when banks were money warehouses, gold warehouses.
00:35:20.416 - 00:36:16.404, Speaker D: It used to be that when you deposited your gold in the 18 hundreds in a bank, it was legally yours and you could go take it out at any moment in time, even if the bank went bankrupt. And so that's the concept. And it seems so fair and so basic and foundational, and yet that's not the basis upon which the traditional financial system, whether it be banking or securities, is built. And we can and will go back to that basic foundation, and we've talked in the past, you and I have, about the means by which, because the system is built the way that it is, the traditional financial system, you get situations like the Dole food case, where in 2017, Dole Food was taken over the Pineapple company, and it turned out that there were more than one third extra Dole food shares that people had brokerage statements showing that they owned than actual dole food shares.
00:36:16.444 - 00:36:17.316, Speaker A: Outstanding.
00:36:17.500 - 00:36:56.496, Speaker D: Okay, so the bookkeeping systems of Wall street, on occasion, can get really that far out of whack one third more shareholders. And what that meant to me when I learned that, was that regular mom and pop investors were having their pockets picked. And sure enough, because, by the way, they thought they were buying real dole food shares, but what they were buying was fake supply. Anytime you create additional supply, it's going to push the price down. The legitimate owners of Dole food shares had their pockets picked. It turns out that there are hedge funds out there who know how to arbitrage these anomalies in the system and make money off them. And this is just fundamentally unfair and wrong.
00:36:56.496 - 00:37:38.734, Speaker D: And so one of the things that attracted me to bitcoin was that I saw that this was a means by which we can get back to an honest ledger that can't be manipulated by nefarious players or even by accident through fault tolerances that have been built into the system over the years. Like failures to deliver. Like in the ETF world, market makers are allowed to go naked short. They can sell more units in the ETF than the actual inventory that they have in inventory. All these kinds of things create price anomalies. And what we really want to get back to is a basic approach of, let's respect property rights in financial assets, so we have an honest ledger. Again, it's not a radical concept, but it is not how the financial system works today.
00:37:40.314 - 00:38:00.294, Speaker A: I love it. You're right. You make it sound extremely reasonable, and it is. So that forms the basis, then, of custodia's bank. What is Custodia going to then do as for products or for services that they provide as a bank? It's on. Right. I'm assuming you're going to be able to store some bitcoin for me.
00:38:00.884 - 00:38:24.464, Speaker D: Yep, it's all on our website. It's US dollar services, traditional ach and fedwire, as well as custody for bitcoin and Ethereum. And then those are the two building blocks for avid, our us dollar instrument, which we have publicly disclosed. We plan to issue both on bitcoin through the liquid side chain, and then as an ERC 20 token as well.
00:38:25.444 - 00:38:44.660, Speaker A: And that is essentially a state I don't want to call stablecoin. And actually, why don't you correct me? Because I've heard you talk about this before, right? Typically, we think of a stable coin as a floating token that is backed by some amount of collateral and usually through some kind of create redeem. It's meant to track the price of a dollar. Is that what you guys. Is that what avid is, or is it something different?
00:38:44.812 - 00:39:33.664, Speaker D: It's not, and it's very different. It's structured as a. You have to be a bank to issue this in the first place. It's structured legally very differently than a stablecoin is structured. And then the rights and obligations of the parties are, of course, quite different, because it's a bank that would be issuing it, and it literally would be a us dollar. It's structured as, in effect, a digital cashier's check. So cashiers checks, there's a lot of law behind cashier's checks, and cashiers checks are right now the law is geared towards them issued in paper form, but what avid is structured to be is a digital version of that, and therefore it's because it's issued by a bank.
00:39:33.664 - 00:40:12.494, Speaker D: And banks are a particular type of corporation bestowed by the government with the ability to issue dollars. Then this canon should be treated as a dollar. To be clear, we are not yet approved to issue it and we have not issued it yet. We did, however, get a patent. We've been in, our applications have been pending that long that we actually were able to get a patent on the basic process by which a bank has accepted a us dollar deposit and issued a token on a permissionless blockchain in exchange for that us dollar deposit. And so that patent was granted to custodia in July.
00:40:13.034 - 00:40:43.218, Speaker A: Congrats. And I do love, by the way, I love the name custodia. I think it's an excellent name for it. I think it really both gives, it gives an easy explanation for what you guys do, but it also has that sort of really uplifting, futuristic vibe to. It sounds like a metropolis. I don't know the words that are coming to mind, which I really like. It's a return to good property rights, but it has this futuristic sound to it, which I really like.
00:40:43.386 - 00:40:48.054, Speaker D: Thank you. We're looking forward to rolling up sleeves and getting open.
00:40:48.894 - 00:41:49.974, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Gosh, there's a lot of things I want to ask you about, but let's stick on the stable coins for a moment, because this would be a tokenized dollar, we'll say, or token version of a bank receipt, as you said, or cashier's check. That's a lot different structure than the sort of pseudo money market funds. Certainly yours would be issued by custodia registered and regulated bank, not a, you know, I'm not calling anyone in particular out here, but not, say, an offshore opaque whatever. So what do you think? What are your thoughts on stables generally? Let me ask this a couple ways. I'll start with, though, leaving aside some of the structure questions, do these extend the reach of the dollar? Is it good for the dollar in general? Is it good for America that 99.5% of them are dollars? What do you think?
00:41:50.554 - 00:42:12.266, Speaker D: Absolutely. And I got to give a hat tip to Nick Carter here, because he was the first to write the essay that I was thinking, which is this is actually going to extend the US dollars reign as reserve currency, because basically the technology that most us dollars move on today is 1970s technology. And so part of the.
00:42:12.370 - 00:42:14.282, Speaker A: This is just better tech, clearly.
00:42:14.378 - 00:42:43.924, Speaker D: Absolutely. And, you know, the US was falling pretty far behind in international circles. It's kind of a laughing stock for how far behind its payment technology has fallen. And if you look at the pics system in Brazil, for example, it blows away the Ach and fedwire systems in the US, and swift as well. And yet the US is the reserve currency. The technology does matter. The US cannot rest on its laurels forever.
00:42:43.924 - 00:43:17.180, Speaker D: And part of the reason the US cannot rest on its laurels forever is that businesses have gone global. And this, of course, has been happening with globalization for a couple decades. A few decades. But the corporate treasurers aren't necessarily patriots in the sense that they're only going to continue to stick with, if it's a us based company, the US dollar. No, they're going to use the currency that is the cheapest currency for them to transact in. It's not just the currency itself, it's how the money moves. In other words, the payment systems, the payment technologies, matter a lot.
00:43:17.180 - 00:44:13.512, Speaker D: They're integral to the currency itself. And as a result, if it turns out that I said this years ago, among the three super regional central banks, what I mean by that is the US is the one that covers the Americas, the Bank of Japan is the one that covers Asia, and then the bank of England, at least still as of today, is the one that covers Europe. They're the three super regional central banks, not the one, not the ECB. Although. Although that is changing because of Brexit. But right now, it's still basically what happens is the cheapest routing for foreign exchange payments is going to hit one of those three central banks. And if money is coming from France to the US, it's probably at least until Brexit, it was either going to go through the bank of England to the US or it was going to go through the Fed to the US.
00:44:13.512 - 00:44:56.526, Speaker D: Ultimately, it has to go through the Fed as well. But the point is, there's an intermediary currency in there because it's the cheapest routing method for foreign exchange execution, because the biggest liquidity has historically been in those three super regional central banks. And so the cheapest bid offer, the best execution, is going to be to put it through those extra hops just because there's not much liquidity, for example, in the thai baht. Right. So it's going to have to go through the bank of Japan before it comes to the US. So ultimately, that's how the foreign exchange market works. And my point is, if you're a US based company and suddenly there's an e version of the yen that is accepted globally, all of a sudden everybody's going to move to that.
00:44:56.526 - 00:45:01.806, Speaker D: And the corporate treasurers that, you know, they'll deal with the foreign exchange even if they're us dollar reporters, right?
00:45:01.830 - 00:45:22.558, Speaker A: Even if you. I see, you're saying they'll use it for rails alone if they have to, just as a bridge. Bridge, yeah, bridge. It might be the best. The asset they ultimately want to hold on either side, perhaps. But if the bridge is just really clogged and slow or crumbling or, you know, old and overgrown or whatever, then. Then they'll just use a different bridge and it should be our.
00:45:22.558 - 00:45:41.334, Speaker A: I mean, come on, let's even. Yeah, yeah. And would that even erode, you think, over, even if they still want to hold, send the dollar and receive the dollar. But if we lose the bridge being dollar based, does that, over time, erode the likelihood of them actually wanting to hold the dollar two, or do you see them as distinct?
00:45:41.374 - 00:46:11.820, Speaker D: Course it does. Of course it does. Now, the US dollar reporting companies will still always want to hold us dollars just to minimize the foreign exchange risk. But the markets are so liquid that they can, even through swaps, minimize that foreign exchange risk, even if they're mostly transacting in that example in yen. But this is important for the crypto markets, because I am a huge fan of bitcoin as an intermediary currency. At one point, it got up to the 11th largest currency in the world. I don't know where it is today, but it's already starting.
00:46:11.852 - 00:46:14.140, Speaker A: It's lower, but yeah, it got pretty big.
00:46:14.332 - 00:46:57.122, Speaker D: Yeah. And it's already starting to break in as an intermediary currency. And at the end of the day, those of us in this market, I'm not interested in the leverage and the trading. I think all that is just cruft and it's not going to survive, especially the leveraged games. But what I am interested in is the technology for moving money and solving the real world problems for the corporate treasurers that I used to work with who had real world pain points, right? And there's a lot of pain. It's not just the cost and the time. It's also the trapped capital that these corporate treasurers had to deal with because I wrote a piece, for example, back in 2015, 2016, about my work with Seagate, the CFO of Seagate global supply chain.
00:46:57.122 - 00:47:28.546, Speaker D: Most of their manufacturing, at least at the time I suspect it still is, is in Thailand. And it took them six days to move money from their thai subsidiary to the US parent. This is their own money. So for them to be able to move intraday was an enormous improvement. Right. To be able to go at the speed of light using something like the Lightning network, that's great. What we really need to do though is work on the engineering and get all this ready to go so that we can start getting real world volumes and we're getting there.
00:47:28.546 - 00:48:24.104, Speaker D: One of the best things that's happened this year is that lightning is scaling and lightning is scaling bitcoin. And I analogize it to what happened with voice over Internet protocol back in 1995 when it was invented. Everybody pooh poohed it and said it'll never work because it can't scale. Well, then broadband came along in 2003 and within a few years, all the old copper wire telephone networks were obsolete. And I think that's going to happen when lightning really does tip and you get it's going to scale bitcoin and suddenly these old payment rails are going to become obsolete. And the real world users of payment systems have such an incentive to move money quickly because they don't have to trap cash. That example of Seagate having to trap its own cash in so called comfort deposits in its bank accounts just to move its own money from one subsidiary to another.
00:48:24.104 - 00:48:49.664, Speaker D: Globally, it took six days. They had to basically fully fund that much capital, very expensive capital, for six days just to move their own money. Right. That's a deadweight loss, economists would say, right. It's super inefficient. And it's not just the cost or the time. It's just how much capital got trapped in the movement of that money.
00:48:49.664 - 00:49:08.774, Speaker D: And now that we can go to cross border at the speed of light for essentially free. Whoa. That's a game changer. And that's why I'm so bullish on lightning. To be clear, though, custodia does not have plans at the moment to implement lightning. We're spending a lot of time looking at it, but it is not business plan at the moment.
00:49:09.154 - 00:49:27.914, Speaker A: No. You guys have other fish to fry, and you're sort of still getting started there, too, as you know. But, I mean, it seems like a no brainer when you're up and running. You've got my. Let's say I'm a. What's the term for the demographic term for a Wyoming? A Wyomingite. Wyomingite, yes, a Wyoming knight, not a Wyoming.
00:49:27.914 - 00:49:52.374, Speaker A: If I'm a Wyoming knight, I got a custodia account, and you're holding my bitcoin. And I know that it's legally still my property, which I really like. Eventually, we start asking for other stuff. I mean, maybe I get some basic banking services. I got an ATM or something, or I come in and you guys, like you said, us dollar services. So I'm assuming I can have a cash account and write checks on it, have a debit card once. You guys are like, right in that.
00:49:53.274 - 00:49:58.986, Speaker D: Yeah. Well, first of all, it's. It's. It's business, actually.
00:49:59.010 - 00:50:02.294, Speaker A: I guess I'm. Oh, it's business. Would you say? It's business only?
00:50:02.874 - 00:50:37.996, Speaker D: Businesses only starting out with us. Businesses only eventually moving to non us. But we're really basically meant to be a back end payments bank. And the custody is an important piece of that. Right? Because you can't provide the, you can't use the technology unless you can provide custody services for it. And obviously, qualified custodian as a bank is a very important piece of the business strategy. And there are a number of people out there saying, I think I saw Bill Ackman saying, custody's got to get solved for this business to really take off.
00:50:37.996 - 00:50:51.172, Speaker D: And to your earlier question, the legal structure used by the custodians that exist today is not consumer friendly. You've got to be a bank or a broker dealer in order to have the special receivership regime, the money transitors.
00:50:51.188 - 00:51:02.900, Speaker A: And that's a remoteness, like a bankruptcy remoteness that you really need. You want, right? I mean, we want you being depositor of digital assets into a custodian it's essential, I mean, in my mind. Really?
00:51:03.092 - 00:51:42.786, Speaker D: Absolutely. And the SEC has historically frowned on trust companies. Trust companies at least have a better argument for segregation, but it's still murky with trust companies in receivership. It's not murky with banks and broker dealers where there's statutory protection for asset segregation. And this is why the SEC has historically frowned on trust companies as qualified custodians and said the only trust companies who can truly be a qualified custodian under the SEC's custody rule are those that provide fiduciary services. But the custodians that provide custody for crypto today aren't fiduciaries and so they don't qualify under, under that rule. It hasn't been tested in court.
00:51:42.786 - 00:52:30.214, Speaker D: But, but the SEC has made it pretty clear they want the custodians to be banks and broker dealers. But here's the irony. The federal regulators aren't letting the banks through and the SEC is not letting special purpose broker dealers through either. So it's pretty clear the answer to all this is that there have to be special purpose banks and special purpose broker dealers to service this industry. These assets are quite different than traditional financial assets for reasons among which we've already discussed. But most importantly in the banking world, as you know, these assets move at the speed of light. When we saw the collapse of terra Luna and the collapse of HUSD and its managed delisting gone awry, these things collapsed within 6 hours.
00:52:30.214 - 00:52:55.906, Speaker D: Okay, so there's a custodia advisor who published a piece on american banker today saying look, the Fed needs to put the banks that are handling digital assets through a stress test where they have 100% withdrawals of all their digital assets, deposits related to digital assets within 6 hours. And I don't think really any traditional bank today would be able to survive something like that because.
00:52:56.050 - 00:53:00.374, Speaker A: Yeah, you're right, the speed is just totally different of this. And especially.
00:53:00.674 - 00:53:17.454, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, and she points out, and I agree with her, traditional assets and digital assets just don't behave the same. So you've, so the whole idea. And there's a, there's a really interesting proposal from Howell Jackson of Harvard Law School and Tim Massett of the Kennedy school. And Dan, I was going to raise.
00:53:17.494 - 00:53:22.286, Speaker A: This with you about Tim Mesad. Right, Tim Massad, was he a former CFTC commissioner?
00:53:22.350 - 00:53:38.714, Speaker D: He was former CFTC. And they're proposing a special purpose bank subsidiary that says you've got to ring fence this from the insured deposit system because you don't want it to leak in they really do. These assets really do behave very differently and the banks are just not set up for these fast settling assets for sure.
00:53:39.294 - 00:54:01.484, Speaker A: That is so interesting. Yeah. I think was, Tim Mossid was saying, we were watching something with him just recently about this paper that they released. Yes, that's exactly what they're talking about. They're suggesting that the regulated stablecoin market can also, it can be ring fenced just under existing regulatory authority. It doesn't require congressional action, in their view, which is interesting.
00:54:01.864 - 00:54:18.976, Speaker D: Yeah, I debated with them a little bit because what they wanted to use was an OCC trust company. And if you look at the OCC trust company capital requirements, they're very thin. So yeah, I think it probably does require congressional authorization.
00:54:19.080 - 00:54:19.528, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:54:19.576 - 00:54:36.568, Speaker D: And then, of course, they look at the structure that custodia has, which is a state charter, which is, which is really quite similar to what they ended up recommending and where the president's working group is coming out as well. Originally the president's working group in the US said, oh no, everything has to be issued by insured depository institutions.
00:54:36.656 - 00:55:00.314, Speaker A: I saw that this was their paper last fall. They said all idis. And there was some stuff that was good there and that they were basically acknowledging that the private markets would be where the stablecoin, the dollar coins would come from and that it wouldn't be as like a centrally issued CBDC, which was good. Good. But yes, the IDI is, we were like, there's no idi doing it currently, to be honest. There's not one. So you're kind of saying no one can do it, at least right now.
00:55:00.314 - 00:55:16.422, Speaker A: Right. Like you're, you're, you're basically knocking out the custodias and the, and let alone the circles and the tethers and the Paxos is none of whom are actually like any of. So it's like you're regulating a market that you're out of existence, briefly at least. And then you're also catch 22. Yeah.
00:55:16.478 - 00:56:01.654, Speaker D: Anyway, so, except, but then they walk back that proposal when they understood and you started to see the OCC acting comptroller Michael Su talk about, no, there's too much intraday liquidity risk. And we're already arguably seeing that the borrowings at the Fed's discount window have popped up. They're still very, very small. But there's some speculation. I don't know the answer to it. I'm just pointing to the fact that some bank experts over the weekend were speculating that maybe the discount window borrowings might be coming from stress in the banks that were serving the digital asset industry. I just saw Morgan Stanley yesterday predicted that in one bank's case that they would lose 60% of their deposits within Q four and a lot of that would have been withdrawn intraday.
00:56:01.654 - 00:56:41.422, Speaker D: And so again, this intraday risk, that's what the president's working group missed in its initial proposal. They've backed off it. So the so called Overton window of what could be done here is these special purpose ring fenced banks, which is exactly what the Wyoming special purpose depository institutions are. And I think there's going to be a companion version of them for broker dealers as well. You really can't fit the round peg into the square hole. You can't use these traditional structures, which is why they haven't been used because the risk management doesn't work. But you also do want the protections for consumers of the special asset segregation and receivership of banks and broker dealers.
00:56:41.422 - 00:56:46.554, Speaker D: So I think we're going to get there in the US. That's my guess. But we don't know.
00:56:47.054 - 00:57:10.526, Speaker A: No, I mean, we don't know and we're not really at the national level appearing to make much progress right now. But Wyoming absolutely stands out. And I know you and many other people worked on putting that law together. And is it being exported out into other states? I've seen that. Certainly some have tried, like. So the language is getting out there. I don't know.
00:57:10.526 - 00:57:12.790, Speaker A: Is it being adopted yet by any other states?
00:57:12.982 - 00:58:06.420, Speaker D: Oh, yes, it is. Well, first of all, the foundational work that we did on commercial law has been adopted at a national level. It took about 18 months for the uniform law commission to stop criticizing Wyoming. And in fact, at one point I had this silent moment of triumph when on a relatively small group call the Uniform Law Commission group saluted Wyoming for its pioneering work. And the Uniform Law Commission article, it's called UCC article twelve, that is now being percolated out about all 50 states, I think only five states that have enacted a version of it, Wyoming included. And boy, like we said in the beginning, the bankruptcy mess in those other states that haven't enacted this is going to be brutal. But for the states that have enacted it, you've got some clarity.
00:58:06.420 - 00:58:50.538, Speaker D: So the judges have a roadmap. That's an example where Wyoming's work did end up going nationwide and the special purpose depository institutions in a few states they've tried, but the bank industry was too powerful in the states where they tried. And it ended up either stripping the most important aspect of it, which is that these have to be depository institutions or ended up getting it killed. They're trying in Texas and Florida right now in Nebraska, they stripped the depository institution piece from it. Why is that so important? Because in order to be eligible for a Fed master account, you've got to be a depository institution. And so the banking industry is clued into this now and is using at the local level their lobbying prowess to strip.
00:58:50.626 - 00:59:35.640, Speaker A: It's no surprise, right? I mean, yeah, it's no surprise. I mean, but it doesn't seem like that's a line they're going to be able to successfully hold, because I feel a wave building behind you and everyone else working on this, and it seems like it's only getting stronger. A couple other questions to raise that I wanted to get your take on in the wake of FTX in particular, which we'll say crypto exchange, and obviously, we don't call them a custodian because that's not what their primary thing was. But of course, course they custodied. Well, I don't know if they really did at FTX, it looks like. But crypto exchange custodies assets on behalf of its users. And we always, you know, there's bitcoiners have been advocating on like January 3 every year, like, pull all your coins down from exchange, first of all.
00:59:35.640 - 01:00:06.642, Speaker A: Always pull them down is what everyone says. Completely agree. Completely agree. But, you know, to stress test, and we know now that, of course, FTX didn't have any, any of any, a large portion of its users assets, including which we've talked about, of course, galaxy and customers who were not lending into their margin pool. So those assets were supposed to be. It's one thing if I'm agreeing to lend you my assets and saying I no longer have title to them, you're doing something. And then for you to screw up, that's one thing.
01:00:06.642 - 01:00:41.902, Speaker A: It's not good, obviously, but it's whole other thing if you're supposed to be custodying it. So anyway, in the wake of this, though, and I love your take on this, a lot of people have been talking about proof of reserves. Our friend Nick Carter, as well as, you know, who's been a longtime advocate for it, I really like this if you're that type of business, but it kind of seems to me that custodia and Wyoming's digital property rights thing in some ways should make this a little bit moot. It's not like you wouldn't maybe also do it, but like, can you square these two things for me. And what are your thoughts on proof of reserve?
01:00:42.038 - 01:00:48.286, Speaker D: Well, guess what? The proof of reserves are in the Wyoming digital asset custody rules. They've been there since 2019.
01:00:48.430 - 01:00:50.286, Speaker A: Oh, let's go. I didn't know that.
01:00:50.430 - 01:00:51.270, Speaker D: Yes.
01:00:51.462 - 01:00:52.994, Speaker A: Wyoming leads the way again.
01:00:53.654 - 01:01:24.090, Speaker D: Exactly. Well, because ultimately, if we step back, how is it that Wyoming was so far ahead? It's very simple. It was keeping to the ethos of bitcoin, keeping to the simple but foundational and oh so important observation that one should have a property right in a financial asset. It shouldn't have to be a con, a contractual right, an IOU. In other words, it should be a property right. And so, and so the audit questions that go along with that are very important. And, and then, of course, there have to be.
01:01:24.090 - 01:01:53.054, Speaker D: Wyoming's special purpose depository institutions are subject to traditional audit requirements. Frankly, custodia has been audited since our first year. We've had, you know, all of us are required to be audited financial institutions. But also there's the proof of reserve. Once, once we do get into custodying digital assets, there is the proof of reserves requirements. And it's so interesting. Jesse Powell has had some very interesting back and forth with CZ over.
01:01:53.054 - 01:02:07.900, Speaker D: Hey, proof of reserves is not a panacea. Jamison Lopp has had some good things to add to Nick, observations as well. It's not a panacea because ultimately, somebody you still are trusting, whoever is doing the proof of reserves, and it doesn't show proof of liabilities either.
01:02:08.012 - 01:02:14.852, Speaker A: Yeah, there are standards, I think, for how you can do a liability side of that audit, but of course, they're not cryptographic. Right. I mean, we can't.
01:02:14.908 - 01:02:16.604, Speaker D: Right. And you are trusting an auditor.
01:02:16.684 - 01:02:18.188, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. But I.
01:02:18.236 - 01:02:19.100, Speaker D: Better than nothing, though.
01:02:19.172 - 01:02:38.484, Speaker A: I have liked Jesse. I've seen Jesse's back and forth with CZ and. And look, CZ, he's called for it. And he's called for it in pretty technical terms, which is great. He said, merkelized cryptographic proof of reserve. We're like, okay, great. If he's calling for that, seems like he is talking about the actual thing that the market wants, but they haven't done it yet.
01:02:38.484 - 01:02:54.804, Speaker A: What they've provided so far has left a fair amount to be desired. He did, however, do one at OKX when he was the CTO in 2014, which is very interesting. So it's not like he doesn't know how to do it, but I agree. And Kraken has done it several times now as well, and they've done it quite well.
01:02:55.424 - 01:03:28.008, Speaker D: And this is a great thing. I love the fact that the industry is moving towards this now. We should have done this years ago. And those of us who were proponents of full reserve banks, full reserve custodians, full reserve exchanges, prove that you're solvent. Those of us who all along have been singing that exact same tune consistently have been challenging intermediaries to do this. And what happened is that so few did. This is where there's historically been a debate between the Rothbardians and the free bankers.
01:03:28.008 - 01:04:27.944, Speaker D: And one of the biggest differences between the two is that there's information asymmetry in financial institutions. And that's the hardest part of the free banking argument, is that you've got, it works as long as you have perfect information, but that just doesn't exist. And, you know, all these intermediaries could have been audited, they could have been disclosing cryptographic proof of reserves, they could have voluntarily offered financial information about their solvency, and they didn't. And in retrospect, we now know not only were many of them not solvent all along, but the yields that people thought they were earning that were really fat, that weren't even remotely high enough to compensate the consumers for the counterparty credit risk that they were taking. And I was trying to warn folks that 20% yields might not even remotely be enough. And it turned out that, in retrospect, unfortunately, they weren't.
01:04:28.484 - 01:05:09.802, Speaker A: Yeah, you've been on this point for a long time, and I think very well vindicated by a lot of the events that ultimately have transpired with these lenders. I understand at its core, too, with your view of property rights, makes things like rehypothecation totally insane, illegal, crazy in your mind. Talk about that a little bit. I don't know. Or maybe another way to ask this question is, has the credit contagion, does it remind you of anything that you've seen in traditional market history? Because I see a lot of parallels. And maybe the rehypothecation that's gone awry here in the crypto markets. Does that bring any bells?
01:05:09.978 - 01:06:03.272, Speaker D: Oh, boy. Yeah. So I'm going to reveal my age a little bit, but I started on Wall street during the bond market crash of 1994, and saw the russian default and asian tiger currency collapse in 97, and then the stock market bubble and collapse in zero one, and then that built up into the mortgage bubble and collapse in zero eight, a repo market contagion in zero eight, the run on the repo market in the great financial crisis. And then we've seen it in Europe. We've seen so many of these, and I'm just giving you some of the history, but they're all credit bubbles, every one of them. And ultimately, it's all too much leverage ended up creeping into the system, and then it came home to rooster. And the triggers for these are always a little bit different and hard to see coming down the road.
01:06:03.272 - 01:06:40.542, Speaker D: But in retrospect, they're always obvious that ultimately, what it comes down to is somebody runs out of the ability to service their debt, and once the defaults start happening, they cascade. And what happens is a lot of folks try to say this is just a liquidity problem. Well, no, not in an asset class like bitcoin, where there's a finite number of bitcoins outstanding. There never will be more than, right now, 19.2 million outstanding. Never will be more than 21 million eventually. And so a liquidity crisis in an asset like that is the same thing as a solvency crisis.
01:06:40.542 - 01:07:10.684, Speaker D: You went insolvent the moment you started leveraging yourself more than one to one, and that's the bottom line. And unfortunately, a lot of folks have have learned that lesson the hard way. But just like in 2008, there really was no such thing as a liquidity crisis. It was a solvency problem all along. The same thing is true here. It's a solvency problem, and it's manifesting as a liquidity problem, and it always starts the same. Somebody can't service their debt, and then the cascading leverage defaults.
01:07:11.384 - 01:07:52.924, Speaker A: So how do you think, Caitlin, maybe to wrap here, how do you think, whether because of the propagation of the Wyoming model, which is very favorable in a lot of ways, I think, as you've described it, or because of the fallout from this contagion and the various other things, FTX and whatnot, we tend to see a lot of market regulation written after market turmoil. All the acts in the thirties and forties came after the Great Depression, the securities act, the 40 act, all these. How do you think market infrastructure in crypto looks different five years from today? I'm picking a random number, or in sort of the medium term, but then maybe even in the long term.
01:07:53.624 - 01:08:21.870, Speaker D: Well, I think in the medium term, and I hope in the next couple of years, I'm one who says, I hope there's regulation, because having been, this is my third crypto winter, and we saw the Gox collapse in my first one in 2014. Then we saw the quadriga collapse in 2018, and then the slew of collapses in 2022. They go on four year cycles. That's not an accident. It's because bitcoin itself has a very distinct, fundamental four year cycle, and I don't think that's changed. Okay, so we're going to be going into a bull market again. If that.
01:08:21.870 - 01:09:37.501, Speaker D: If past is prologue, which I believe it will be, because it's fundamental, we'll be going into a bull market again in a couple of years. And what I fear is that in each of those four year cycles that I just described, the audacity of the, of the crimes and the outright just criminal activity and scams and risky business models that propagated in the bull markets got bigger and bigger and bigger. And I do believe that it's time to step in with a property rights oriented regulatory regime that greenlights the good guys who, by the way, we've been on the sidelines through all this, sidelined because of the regulatory inaction. And there are a number of us who really, truly are trying to work with the regulators, get permission for everything we do. It's a small number of us, but our day is coming. I do believe, to answer your question directly, I think there will be special purpose banks and special purpose broker dealers, and you will end up basically, you'll never, just like the Internet itself, with Tor and dark web, there will be dark markets here that will never be able to be shut down. I saw somebody's tweet and I can't remember who it was that I think it was Marc Andreessen.
01:09:37.501 - 01:10:04.795, Speaker D: Software is really, really, really hard to regulate. You can't. It's speech. You can't shut it down. What you can do is create easier pathways to the lit markets, the legal markets, where the mainstream is going to transact. And ultimately, that's where I think these special purpose banks and special purpose broker dealers will come out. I am sympathetic to the concern that everybody always raises, which is that the regulators get captured.
01:10:04.795 - 01:10:50.834, Speaker D: And so I think as long as the regulation is very property rights focused, it's going to be tougher to capture a regulator. And we see that even so, custodia applied to become a Fed member bank. Well, we're seeing Fed member banks be allowed to wave in to doing crypto activities just simply because they were already Fed member banks. Whereas custodia, as a Fed member bank, leaving our master account discussion aside, we applied to become a Fed member bank to be directly regulated by the Fed in August 2021. That's now, what, 1516 months ago? Yeah. And so we have to get permission and get examined first, whereas the incumbents, including Moonstone bank, which had two employees.
01:10:51.214 - 01:10:56.638, Speaker A: I was going to ask you about moonstone. This is the FTX bank that they bought a 10% interest in. Right, right.
01:10:56.686 - 01:11:15.614, Speaker D: But they were able to just apparently provide a notice to the Fed under the supervisory letter that the Fed put in place in August. So there's such a structural advantage for the incumbents versus an upstart that has to get permission for everything we do and get examined versus the incumbents that don't.
01:11:15.654 - 01:11:29.848, Speaker A: They're allowed. That is ridiculous. But you're one that's also purpose built for doing this exact thing. You'd be a lot better at doing it than. Certainly than a moonstone. But even than other big banks, I think that just happened to already be fed members. Right.
01:11:29.848 - 01:11:49.160, Speaker A: This is your exact thing. I mean, look, I'm not going to name any of my, any bitcoin or friends, but I know several employees at custodia and they're excellent. I know what you built must be great if they working there. And so, like, some random bank just like, decides to start doing this and the one that's purpose built for it and state regulated, like, can't get. That's just.
01:11:49.192 - 01:11:52.440, Speaker D: It is to become federally regulated. That's voluntarily.
01:11:52.472 - 01:12:07.496, Speaker A: Well, that's really what I'm complaining about. Let's go with the. Yeah, let's get the federal regulation approved. You know, someone I'm not, you know, I'm pounding the table here. But yes, I think that's. I think that vision of the future makes a lot of sense. And I agree with you.
01:12:07.496 - 01:12:38.016, Speaker A: I think if we're talking about intermediaries, you know, one thing that we were thinking was that, like, you're gonna have. If you're gonna be decentralized, you've gotta be literally actually decentralized, fully decentralized, whether it's an app or some defi application or whatever. And to be clear, many don't meet that. The standard I'm talking about. Pretty high bar for that standard. And if you're going to be centralized, you've got to be fully centralized, regulated, transparent. And I think there cannot be this ridiculous middle ground of opaque firms like FTX.
01:12:38.016 - 01:12:42.848, Speaker A: Now we know just how ludicrous that company was. They didn't even have a board of directors.
01:12:43.016 - 01:12:43.816, Speaker D: Correct.
01:12:44.000 - 01:12:46.616, Speaker A: Valued at 32 billion. With no board of directors when I did.
01:12:46.640 - 01:12:48.844, Speaker D: Or audited financials. Yeah.
01:12:49.504 - 01:12:59.060, Speaker A: So somewhere there can't be that middle ground. And I absolutely think if you're, you know, you can't regulate the bitcoin protocol. It's not, I mean, you can try, but it's not going to do much or work, probably, right?
01:12:59.092 - 01:12:59.664, Speaker D: Correct.
01:13:01.124 - 01:13:05.732, Speaker A: But you can regulate the intermediaries that sit on top of it. I think that's absolutely right. And you should.
