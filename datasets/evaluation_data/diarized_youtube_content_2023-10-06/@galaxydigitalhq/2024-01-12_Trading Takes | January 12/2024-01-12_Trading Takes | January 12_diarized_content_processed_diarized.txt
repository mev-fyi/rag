00:00:08.320 - 00:00:12.718, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:12.806 - 00:00:13.886, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:14.030 - 00:00:27.430, Speaker A: Wow. Ten years in the making. Bitcoin ETF's approved. If you're listening to this, on Thursday, January 11, they launch today at 09:30 a.m. For trading. Was it a sell the news event? I didn't. Over my shoulder.
00:00:27.430 - 00:00:30.930, Speaker A: I mean, we're recording. What's Wednesday night? It's flat.
00:00:31.082 - 00:01:20.296, Speaker B: It's flat. Yeah. I would just say there's a lot of uncertainty surrounding day one flows with respect to will inflows, outpace outflows of things like grayscale. There's $28 billion of grayscale that's been in, probably on average, at a much lower cost basis than here. The discount is likely to close, you know, higher to close today. And so the question on the approval, and there's been a lot of folks waiting to take profit on bitcoin, waiting for the CTF news. And so I think it's possible that you go down, but I think it's likely that you go up, and this is an asset that's asymmetric to the upside in terms of risk profile.
00:01:20.296 - 00:01:26.960, Speaker B: And you can go to zero, but you could also go to, like, 200,000. Right. So you can, at most lose 100%.
00:01:27.072 - 00:01:28.696, Speaker A: Right. I don't think you could go to zero.
00:01:28.760 - 00:01:29.400, Speaker B: No, you're not.
00:01:29.512 - 00:01:30.472, Speaker A: We didn't go last.
00:01:30.608 - 00:01:50.032, Speaker B: If you're thinking about bitcoin as an asset that's floored at now, let's say, 30, you're trading at 46, and you think that there's a positive supply catalyst coming with the happening turn in fed policy, et cetera, you could be looking at an asset that could easily be worth one hundred k. I think that's.
00:01:50.128 - 00:01:51.224, Speaker A: Well within a year.
00:01:51.344 - 00:02:07.082, Speaker B: So if you're talking about an asset that's got a downside of 10,000 versus an upside of 54,000, that seems like, you know, good five to one risk reward trade right there. And it's now gonna become, in a form that's incredibly easy to access.
00:02:07.178 - 00:02:08.170, Speaker A: So easy.
00:02:08.362 - 00:02:15.530, Speaker B: And, you know, just for what it's worth, like, you know, you're gonna be able to get margin on it, you know, day one for the most part.
00:02:15.602 - 00:02:15.930, Speaker A: Right.
00:02:16.002 - 00:02:49.838, Speaker B: And so there's gonna be a lot of, like, cheap money that's gonna flow into crypto as a function of folks getting financing on a lot of these ETF products. And so there's a lot of cash coming in, a lot of new institutions that now have access to it, you know, millions and millions, tens of millions of retirement accounts and other investment vehicles that will now have cheap access to bitcoin. And so I think the potential is not infinite, but, you know, do I? To the moon does come to mind. Let's put it that way.
00:02:49.886 - 00:02:59.310, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, you heard the intro rap. We had JFK, former president, talking about going to the moon. There was a reason for that choice in that vein.
00:02:59.422 - 00:03:20.894, Speaker B: It is not what bitcoin can do for crypto, but it is what you can do for crypto. I just tried to make something cool there, but I just do want to highlight the fact that alts are ripping higher on the back of this announcement, we've had ETH trade up to, I guess, 2500 and change.
00:03:20.974 - 00:03:22.372, Speaker A: Let's talk about ETH real quick.
00:03:22.558 - 00:03:23.992, Speaker B: Outperformed a ton as well.
00:03:24.048 - 00:03:54.282, Speaker A: I've been very critical of the ETH BTC rally we've seen over the last couple of days. Our clients and counterparties will know that. I've tweeted about it before as well. I'm of the belief that ETH BTC should go lower before it eventually maybe goes higher. You do have ETH ETF applications that have been filed. I think the earliest final approved deny date on their 19 B four s is in May. The logic being from the perspective issuers, that they also have CME futures.
00:03:54.282 - 00:04:03.506, Speaker A: And so futures like spot, you look at the grayscale rolling right. That it should be a similar analysis ultimately from the SEC, but that's a long ways away. That's five months from now.
00:04:03.690 - 00:04:10.386, Speaker B: Yeah, I just look at it from the positioning standpoint. Everybody's positioned in bitcoin and not really that position for ETH upside.
00:04:10.450 - 00:04:11.322, Speaker A: So there's a catch up trade.
00:04:11.338 - 00:04:22.775, Speaker B: There's a catch up trade. And it's also just like, you know, folks looking to take profit on bitcoin, like, what's the next available trade? Right. You know, you look at a cross that's down over 20% on the year.
00:04:22.839 - 00:04:47.871, Speaker A: You'Re like, I'm of a view that, that. I agree with that. And. But I think going forward, where we believe a lot of allocation in bitcoin will be through these ETF vehicles, that inter crypto cyclicality should dampen, particularly before the ETH ETF launches. Right. Because if we believe there's a lot of financial advisor allocation coming, which is the target audience for these ETF's, we've report. We, we believe that.
00:04:47.871 - 00:05:17.182, Speaker A: I believe that, um, that's not sitting on, you know, polo or a crypto exchange ready to go into the next, into ETH, and then into alts. Right. It's stuck in the ETF's. So the rotation trade, I think it, it can still happen now because there's, the money's not in the ETF's yet. As we record this, certainly, like this time, there's still that rotation. You can see it happening. I mean, yesterday when the fake or compromised tweet came out from the SEC, there was a rotation into ETH overnight.
00:05:17.182 - 00:05:25.038, Speaker A: Like, it was a notable one. But that should dampen over time, in my opinion, because financial advisors are longer term allocators and stuff. I don't know.
00:05:25.086 - 00:05:35.194, Speaker B: Yeah, it's been part of my thesis. I just think BTC, you know, ETH is going to be a healthy part of any crypto portfolio. A 5% allocation, a 10% allocation in crypto.
00:05:35.694 - 00:05:36.758, Speaker A: Or higher. Or higher.
00:05:36.846 - 00:05:52.862, Speaker B: Or higher. And so, you know, as more and more people get exposed to the idea that I need crypto in my portfolio, I need crypto in my portfolio because it's a risk diversifier and a performance enhancer. It's tough to ignore ETH, especially once you get an ETF, it's meaningfully different.
00:05:52.918 - 00:05:54.878, Speaker A: From bitcoin, so it's reasonable.
00:05:54.966 - 00:06:36.578, Speaker B: And so it's just like higher beta, lower market cap. And so I definitely, I see it both ways fundamentally. Like, I agree with the macro thesis behind bitcoin more. And so I would obviously like to see bitcoin outperform, but I think it's one of those things you just gotta own both. And in terms of alt exposure as well, I think there's just gonna be so many new institutions that are interacting with crypto that are gonna understand it better. And the education that goes on after, like, I think this is really like a seminal moment for bitcoin, the crossing of the Rubicon, however you wanna think about it. But from this point forward, the world will be different.
00:06:36.706 - 00:06:44.738, Speaker A: Okay, before we break, CPI is tomorrow and Thursday again, January 11. What are you thinking about? What are you expecting for CPI?
00:06:44.826 - 00:07:05.058, Speaker B: Yeah, you know, I want to see. It does matter because there's a lot baked into markets in terms of interest rate cut expectations that are priced out to this year. And so I think the risks to the number are asymmetric in the sense that if it comes in higher than expected, that some of this market pricing might fade.
00:07:05.186 - 00:07:08.274, Speaker A: But in terms of goes later, the cuts go later in the year, or.
00:07:08.314 - 00:07:59.884, Speaker B: Like, correct, less magnitude, less magnitude, but both. And it's tough to price in more cuts in my opinion, therefore, a softer CPI print is not really going to do too much for markets, but high level. What I'm looking at is owner's equivalent rent. We've been expecting it to come down meaningfully over the next handful of months as a function of more supply of apartments hitting the market as a function of vacancy rates also ticking up. And just as the real time indicators for rents have been ticking down versus the owner's equivalent rent metric has been a little bit stickier because of how they calculate the numbers. So expecting a little bit more catch up there and then in things like used autos, I'm thinking there's going to be some weakness. Airline fares and things alike should see some declines.
00:07:59.884 - 00:08:16.646, Speaker B: But in terms of what I'm focused on in inflation, in terms of stuff that might alter people's views, is this freight issue right now with all the conflicts we're having in the Red Sea and how much in terms of freight supplies not getting dusty, that's among the.
00:08:16.670 - 00:08:20.950, Speaker A: Biggest risks for inflation right now. That is the geopolitical supply chain stuff.
00:08:21.102 - 00:08:48.352, Speaker B: Supply chain stuff is huge. Then oil is trading really well. Dollar 73 a barrel on WTI crude gas prices have come off a lot off the highs. And so that's been a positive sort of development. But again, what I'm more worried about is stock market's almost at the dead highs. Crypto is back to the dead highs. Property values with interest rates going down are still relatively firm.
00:08:48.352 - 00:09:24.816, Speaker B: And so I think the market is still underappreciating the risk of reinflation. But all of the indicators we're looking at in terms of manufacturing sentiment surveys, employment data, they're all pointing towards a slowdown in the economy and a slowdown in headline inflation and a slowdown in core PCE, the Fed's preferred measure. And so that's kind of why you're seeing all of these interest rate cuts priced in, in addition to the Fed taking a more dovish stance and a more precautionary stance. And so there are things that can counter that view, and a high CPI print is one of them. And so that's kind of what I'm focused on is a risk to the.
00:09:24.840 - 00:09:27.280, Speaker A: Market, more risk on a high print than a correct.
00:09:27.352 - 00:09:45.144, Speaker B: And then the other sort of big development this week was the back and forth we've had on the Fed's balance sheet. So right now, they're running off the Fed's balance sheet. Right. But you're kind of getting to the point where you might want to consider stopping. In addition, it doesn't make sense to be tightening policy with the balance sheet and easing policy on interest rates.
00:09:45.184 - 00:09:46.112, Speaker A: Kind of negating yourself.
00:09:46.168 - 00:09:46.792, Speaker B: Right?
00:09:46.968 - 00:09:47.744, Speaker A: Unified front.
00:09:47.784 - 00:10:15.758, Speaker B: Correct, correct. And so Lori Logan, who's the head of the Dallas Fed, who used to be a member of the New York Fed, which knows all the plumbing, came out this on Friday, being like, oh, it might be time to stop this quantitative tightening or taper it. And then Williams today was like, you know, it might still be appropriate to engage in. So there's a little bit of a back and forth. And then we just still have to deal with this ongoing fiscal, like over exuberance. I mean, the government spends just so much.
00:10:15.806 - 00:10:22.814, Speaker A: All right, we're going to get to the government. Let's save it for another one. It's a bimnet. Thank you so much. It's an exciting time in this.
00:10:22.854 - 00:10:23.940, Speaker B: I'm so excited, guys.
00:10:24.022 - 00:10:29.584, Speaker A: Truly an amazing. We're excited. Well, that's it. Bim Netabeebe from Galaxy trading. Thank you so much. Pleasure.
