00:00:00.280 - 00:00:55.395, Speaker A: The kind of increase in data availability capacity is still not scalable enough for roll up demand. If we see more roll ups, especially more based roll ups start to launch on Ethereum, you could see the consistent demand by these rollups for blob space just exceed the target that is already set on Ethereum the target of 3 and 6 and the cost from there just increase dramatically and be unaffordable for most for most rollups to keep operating. And this comes to the reason for why peerdas is such an important code change in Petra. This is why Peer DAS is one of the main code changes going into Petra and why it's been expedited, I believe by developers to be implemented sooner rather than later because of the fact that while costs have gone down for rollups, the costs are still not low enough.
