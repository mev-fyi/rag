00:00:08.039 - 00:00:12.190, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, BIMnet, great to have you on.
00:00:12.262 - 00:00:13.246, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:13.350 - 00:00:31.204, Speaker A: I'm not going to do our little shtick here, but yes, today it was Fed day today, Super bowl big day. So. But I'm going to. I'll break the news. This was the first pause of the cycle. No rate hike today. What's the take here? I mean, what's going on?
00:00:31.504 - 00:01:01.132, Speaker B: Sort of. They're sending conflicting messages. The idea that data is strong enough for them to think that they need to raise rates two more times this year, which is what was indicated in their dot plot, yet not strong enough to necessitate a hike. This meeting seems particularly odd. In addition, we did have, like, pretty strong CPI yesterday, right. With core CPI coming in, you know, four, 5.3%, you know, year on year.
00:01:01.132 - 00:01:31.472, Speaker B: We're still over 300 basis points above core, like your core CPI target. You did have some soft PPI data this morning. But again, like, it's pretty clear the US is still well behind its inflation target and the Fed chose not to hike today. And I think at its face you have like, actions speak louder than words. Right. And so just because they're telling you that they're gonna hike two more times, right. I don't necessarily think that they will actually hike those two more times.
00:01:31.488 - 00:01:38.032, Speaker A: That's so interesting. Cause if they were gonna hike two more times, why not do them now or start with one after those two?
00:01:38.088 - 00:02:00.900, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And we've also learned, I mean, the messaging of the Fed early on was that there's clear advantages to front loading and you want the bulk of your rate policy done sooner rather than later than drawing it out. This is a fed that went from being like, oh, front loading is really important to monetary policy. Works with a lag. We're going to pause. Right. But here's the thing.
00:02:00.900 - 00:02:12.706, Speaker B: You also have to think about what other central banks did. The RBA took a pause. The Royal bank of Australia, the bank of Canada took a pause, and they have since had to hike again.
00:02:12.810 - 00:02:13.338, Speaker A: Right.
00:02:13.466 - 00:02:22.410, Speaker B: And, you know, there may be more subsequent hikes. However, those curves were behind the US's and US terminal is pretty high, but.
00:02:22.482 - 00:02:35.346, Speaker A: Pretty strange and different. Has there ever been a hiking cycle in the US where they paused and then hiked again like a pause as opposed to a cessation of hikes? Do we know?
00:02:35.490 - 00:02:57.626, Speaker B: Yes, but it's not common. But it's not common. Typically it's like you hike. Yeah, hike, you stop and then you cut. And that's what's indicated by all the crazy inversion and the curves and what that historically means and stuff. And so it is strange behavior. But the precedent was set by other central banks recently.
00:02:57.626 - 00:03:41.088, Speaker B: And so it's not like crazy. It's just a little intellectually dishonest, I think, because if you were intellectually honest about the data set in front of you and what you've conveyed to the market in terms of what the market thinks your response function is to data, then in theory, you should have gone, there's nothing about the labor market that says it's cracking. You had one uptick in initial jobless claims, one this cycle so far, 14 upward revisions in the labor state. We put it 300,000 jobs last. It is actually crazy.
00:03:41.256 - 00:03:51.248, Speaker A: And so it really is. I mean, we were talking about this, you and I, yesterday. I would just, I would keep hiking. Like, why? Why are they not, yeah, you know, but stocks are high.
00:03:51.256 - 00:03:51.968, Speaker B: But here's the thing.
00:03:52.016 - 00:03:56.328, Speaker A: The unemployment's still low. Like, but I guess they don't want to over hike.
00:03:56.416 - 00:03:58.128, Speaker B: You keep hiking, then it's like, then.
00:03:58.136 - 00:03:59.128, Speaker A: It gets worse than it should.
00:03:59.216 - 00:04:32.492, Speaker B: Yeah, well, so financial conditions are really important. And right now, financial conditions in terms of where the Fed is most focused on is probably with respect to banking system stress or one of their main areas of focus. That's true. The further you jack up front end rates, the more that the curve is going to invert, which, again, as we've talked about in past podcasts, which is literally the worst thing that can happen to a bank balance sheet. They've got liabilities in the front end, assets in the back end. Cost of liabilities go up and their value of their assets go down.
00:04:32.628 - 00:04:33.584, Speaker A: It's bad.
00:04:36.604 - 00:04:57.476, Speaker B: Realistically, there's potential systemic consequences if they just keep going like this, although I think it's probably less likely than it has been historically or recently. Just look at things like the bank stock index, KrE. Those have rallied. People have stopped shorting bank stocks like crazy.
00:04:57.540 - 00:04:58.004, Speaker A: That was a wild.
00:04:58.044 - 00:05:27.288, Speaker B: In addition, bank deposits have kept up, and a lot of these small banks have changed their behaviors in order to adjust for this higher rate environment. Aka, we're going to offer everybody CDs at really high rates. And so, yeah, my deposits aren't going away. I'm just going to pay a lot of money for those deposits. And so their profitability is continuing to go down and down. However, the deposit issue and the solvency issue won't be there.
00:05:27.376 - 00:05:27.864, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:27.984 - 00:06:02.714, Speaker B: And the other thing to keep in mind is that a lot of this rates are going up, et cetera. But ultimately, monetary policy is meant to change the everyday person's life. The everyday person has to buy food and groceries. They gotta buy their apartment or rent their apartment. Like when we're thinking down to, like the average man or woman level, right? Like this, these high rates haven't, haven't really impacted them at all. Right? Grocery prices are still high. They've come down electronics and things.
00:06:02.714 - 00:06:17.716, Speaker B: There's spots, but inflation is still impacting that everyday person. And the only thing that's really gone down in value are, like, asset prices. Crypto's come down in value. Like Nasdaq came off of bubble levels, went down a lot. Now is back at bubble.
00:06:17.780 - 00:06:18.428, Speaker A: That's what I was thinking about.
00:06:18.436 - 00:06:41.788, Speaker B: But it's like commercial real estate. The things that are being impacted are assets, and particularly ones that are sensitive to interest rates. And who owns those assets? Not the average man. And so realistically, you could argue that there's still a lot of wood to chop with respect to getting inflation down for the everyday person.
00:06:41.836 - 00:06:42.476, Speaker A: That's what I'm thinking.
00:06:42.540 - 00:07:00.076, Speaker B: And the issue is it really comes down to the tightness in the labor market, which is there's a lot of job opening still and not that many people have gotten laid off. And, you know, there's tons of mobility in the labor market, and that's not going to change for a really long time. And so it's tricky.
00:07:00.180 - 00:07:05.052, Speaker A: It is tricky. And I guess pausing then, I guess, can make sense too, in that trick. And because it's tricky, they say, you.
00:07:05.068 - 00:07:06.068, Speaker B: Know, yeah, it's possible.
00:07:06.116 - 00:07:29.824, Speaker A: Maybe we don't. And I guess maybe they're finally getting some prudence. Member, I used to call it whipsaw monetary policy, where you're saying they were, they, they had, they cut faster and more quickly and printed more money than in all of history. And then, oh, crap, that was too much cutting and printing. Now we have crazy inflation. And then they, they waited too long to start hiking. And then it's like, well, if I say keep hiking now, maybe they'll have waited, too.
00:07:29.824 - 00:07:35.824, Speaker A: It'll actually get way worse. We'll have a hard landing because they'll have. Right. So they're, they, maybe they're trying to just finally be prudent and just wait a little bit.
00:07:35.864 - 00:07:38.128, Speaker B: And the word feels like pragmatic.
00:07:38.176 - 00:07:40.128, Speaker A: Pragmatic, not prudent. Yeah.
00:07:40.216 - 00:07:52.576, Speaker B: And yes, I think there's more nuance to the job than just looking at data and being like, oh, formula. Basically, my inflation is here. My policy rate has to be.
00:07:52.600 - 00:07:55.824, Speaker A: So they're sensing it. They've got their finger on the pulse.
00:07:55.984 - 00:08:20.126, Speaker B: That's in theory. That's what they've told us that they're trying to do better at, because they missed it on the other way. And so now they've been more dynamic about creating indices that aren't as lagging. Right, like the owner's equivalent. Rent used to be one of those big lagging indicators. They came out with like a diffusion thing, et cetera. They've got all of these, like, nowcasts, Atlanta fed and New York Fed, like the employment.
00:08:20.126 - 00:08:31.606, Speaker B: So they're looking at a much broader set of data, and they also have their own internal surveys, et cetera. So they are, in theory, feeling the pulse of the market a bit better.
00:08:31.670 - 00:08:32.281, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:32.437 - 00:09:06.262, Speaker B: The other thing I'd like to mention is that they need the market to give them credibility. That's one of the big reasons why I think they showed a 50 basis point increase in the dot plot for this year, is because they need people to think that interest rates are going to stay higher for longer. If you have these dramatic cuts priced into the back end of the curve, it's realistically, what are you actually doing? Because, you know, like, you start pricing those, you're not really hiking because the.
00:09:06.278 - 00:09:10.478, Speaker A: Market knows they're gonna come down later, you kind of start pricing those in. Right, exactly.
00:09:10.566 - 00:09:11.854, Speaker B: And so it's one of those things.
00:09:11.894 - 00:09:15.574, Speaker A: Where it's kind of like, we've talked about this before, they gotta talk a tough game.
00:09:15.654 - 00:09:31.458, Speaker B: They have to. And that's just to implement the policy. Like there's, you know, for the smooth functioning amount, they have to raise the TGA and stuff. Yeah, right. There's all this issuance. Nobody's going to want to buy paper that has all of these cuts priced into it. Right, right.
00:09:31.586 - 00:09:51.226, Speaker A: So let's, let's talk, let's do a couple more. Just a minute or two left here. Let's talk about cryptos, um, obviously, and bitcoin, obviously. Um, it's been basically flat all week. Right. I mean, down last weekend was a big, like, risk off for, uh. Yeah, for mostly for alts, but for crypto, I mean.
00:09:51.226 - 00:10:22.104, Speaker A: I mean, a lot of alts were off 15 20%, and they haven't really recovered. But we had all those events on Tuesday, the court hearings, the binance court hearing, the house hearing, the Coinbase sec response to their rulemaking petition stuff. We covered all this, and I was tweeting about this all on Tuesday. In the end, most of that ended up being neutral for crypto. The pause shouldn't that, if pause means maybe cut sometime. We've said for a long time, we think that's bullish. Bitcoin.
00:10:22.104 - 00:10:30.520, Speaker A: Bitcoin sitting at 25, eight again, we're just below that long time channel, just where we were. It seems flat. What's your outlook in the near term?
00:10:30.632 - 00:11:07.272, Speaker B: So, generally speaking, when things are very confusing, lots of moving pieces, etcetera, I tend to look at the charts. Our CEO has this saying, people lie, charts don't. When I look at the charts, the most interesting one right now, unfortunately, is ethanol. And ETH looks like it is breaking support right now. That support being in the range of like 1730 to 1750. And it's support that's held for the past three months. And you're getting closes below those support lines.
00:11:07.272 - 00:12:08.272, Speaker B: And to me, I don't see that many upside catalysts for ETH in the sense that where is the new money coming from to support ETH? A bunch of retail just got burned on some of these, these alts, and there's not a new meme coin popping off. You look at gas prices, they've come off, and then you look at the ETH BTC chart that looks like it's starting to trend lower. And so I really do think that you could be entering a period of ETH underperformance at the same time, on the bitcoin side, I think you're on the cusp of the macro argument being about as strong as ever. Because if we are going to go into a hard learning scenario and we're cutting rates again, or inflation's coming down and we're cutting rates again, risk assets have already started to jump, right? Like Nasdaq is close to the trend highs, S and P is close to the trend highs. And it's one of those things that has no ambiguity about whether or not it is a security. It is definitely a commodity.
00:12:08.328 - 00:12:10.728, Speaker A: The only one that is definitely, and.
00:12:10.856 - 00:12:43.826, Speaker B: The way it trades is one of an asset class that has matured. It does not go down 20%. It goes down like a couple percent here and there. The volatility profile has improved in my eyes, and I think it's one that's gonna perpetually continue to improve as you get more adoption, macro story improves, et cetera. There's gonna be a lot of buyers. I'll tell you, if bitcoin stayed here for the next six months in a row, just up and down a percent, the amount of money that would flow in, I think would be absurd.
00:12:43.890 - 00:12:46.514, Speaker A: That's great, because the volatility, the volatility.
00:12:46.634 - 00:13:13.926, Speaker B: The lower the volume, the more notional that people can fit in. It becomes one of those self fulfilling things. One of the things that is so discouraging about bitcoin, especially for the larger macro types, is this thing moves like crazy on next to nothing. What's going on, etcetera. The moment a lot of that goes away, I think that will draw a lot more new money into the system.
00:13:13.990 - 00:13:14.374, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:14.454 - 00:13:15.390, Speaker B: Myself included.
00:13:15.422 - 00:13:16.334, Speaker A: Much bigger money can.
00:13:16.374 - 00:13:22.710, Speaker B: Much bigger. Yeah, much bigger. Right. Like, yeah. Yards. Yards. It's the market that doesn't.
00:13:22.710 - 00:13:27.230, Speaker B: Like, I'm telling you, you. This market, if it had an influx of ten yards.
00:13:27.342 - 00:13:29.726, Speaker A: Yeah. Up and off, I mean.
00:13:29.790 - 00:13:30.366, Speaker B: Oh, my God.
00:13:30.430 - 00:13:35.234, Speaker A: Bim net. Above Galaxy trading, my friend. As always, thanks so much for coming on. Galaxy brands. Thank you.
