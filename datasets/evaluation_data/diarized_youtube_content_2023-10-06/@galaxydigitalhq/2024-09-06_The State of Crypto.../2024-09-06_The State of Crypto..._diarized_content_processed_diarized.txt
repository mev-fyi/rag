I mean, it's still kind of sideways, like I said, since March, but I mean all time high this year, massively successful, probably the most successful of all time. ETF launch from the Bitcoin ETFs. Plenty of stuff going well in bitcoin world, right? Interesting innovations happening, debates about the future, upgrades and stuff. Like all of that seems mostly okay. Digital gold narrative at a minimum, permeated quite well. Like people get people know what bitcoin is.
00:00:27.595 - 00:00:39.215, Speaker A: The rest of the crypto complex doesn't feel nearly as certain. Right? And I think if you think about 2021, there were these big application categories that drove so much interest in Ethereum as an example.
