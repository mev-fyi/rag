And regardless of who's the president, they're not going to destroy Silicon Valley. Right. They're not going to destroy the system of checks and balances. They're not going to destroy the free market economy that has helped this nation, like, thrive. And so most of the time, you're supposed to think that regardless of the administration or the party that's in office, the economy is not going to really be that responsive to either party. It's the stock market.
00:00:39.721 - 00:00:54.105, Speaker A: You're right. That should be true. And that has been true. You could argue that certain ones have been better than others. But high level, if you go back and look at the chart of the S and P and you click all the way time back, it's just up only.
