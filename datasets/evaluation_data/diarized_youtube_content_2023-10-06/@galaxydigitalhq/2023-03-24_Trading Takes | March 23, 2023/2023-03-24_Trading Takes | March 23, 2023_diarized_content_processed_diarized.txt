00:00:00.400 - 00:00:06.670, Speaker A: Let's go now to our expert in macro, CEO and founder of Galaxy, Mike Novogratz. Welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:06.782 - 00:00:09.166, Speaker B: Galaxy Brains. First time on Monday and podcast it is.
00:00:09.190 - 00:00:09.662, Speaker A: It's the first time.
00:00:09.678 - 00:00:10.710, Speaker B: What took so long?
00:00:10.862 - 00:00:16.286, Speaker A: Well, we were waiting for you to ask us to come on. We were trying to get so famous you couldn't stay away. But we're working on that still.
00:00:16.350 - 00:00:20.674, Speaker B: Yeah. When I had a podcast, it was like, hoveled in my office. You got your own little studio.
00:00:21.134 - 00:00:33.684, Speaker A: Well, I didn't pay for it. I know Galaxy did. So thank you, Mike. The fed raised rates 25 bps today and signaled further rate hikes. It seemed a little hawkish to me. What was your takeaway?
00:00:33.764 - 00:01:05.546, Speaker B: Listen, I think he was right up the middle. What was expected. He was very clear, we probably will have a credit contraction based on regional banks being under stress and that is rate tightening. He broadly was saying, I was pretty hawkish three weeks ago at Humphrey Hawkins testify that we might have to go a lot more than we thought. That's off the table. They went 25, they might or might not go next meeting and then they're going to pause. And that's what the market is pricing.
00:01:05.546 - 00:01:25.054, Speaker B: That's what their dots say now, the market's pricing, they're going to cut rates sooner than they're saying they are. But he gave a pretty clear indication that this banking crises will have a negative impact on the economy and that is a tightening. The market broadly is red at dovish.
00:01:25.174 - 00:01:25.430, Speaker A: Right.
00:01:25.462 - 00:01:46.582, Speaker B: Fixed income is a lot higher. Crypto traded really well beforehand and it was a little buy the rumor, sell the fact. Remember, we've gone from 17,000 to 28 nine the high today. And so we've rolled over pretty hard. I think this is just a position washout, like of us crypto guys. Everyone had kind of gone all in a little.
00:01:46.758 - 00:01:48.646, Speaker A: People went a little too far over their skis.
00:01:48.750 - 00:01:50.486, Speaker B: So this is a natural pullback.
00:01:50.630 - 00:01:55.602, Speaker A: I mean, right now I think we're trading at like 27 five. It's not like a massive retrace.
00:01:55.658 - 00:02:05.690, Speaker B: Yeah, but if you look at fixed income, it's traded 25 basis points higher. And so you would have thought, okay, there's an ease that's being priced in. Crypto would have normally done better with that other than had it front run it.
00:02:05.762 - 00:02:14.514, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. So do you think so? It's not. The dot plot isn't much changed from the last time it saw. So they're sort of hanging in there. Is that what they're trying to signal?
00:02:14.594 - 00:02:44.472, Speaker B: I think they're basically saying 5% this year and then goes down to 3%. They see the economy and inflation slowing. We have a slow economy already, and they see it slowing more. The labor market's stubborn, and so the Fed is not ready to say they're going to cut rates this year. The market is, and we'll see who's true. Powell was very straightforward, though. He said, listen, we're just guessing.
00:02:44.472 - 00:03:21.308, Speaker B: We'll react to the data if the data rolls, and we'll see it's complicated and how fast the transmission is. Regional banks grow lending at around 16, 17%. Money center banks grow lending at 1%. They don't lend Chase Manhattan, Citibank. They're not in the business of lending. They have consumer lending through credit cards, but not to businesses, personal real estate businesses. Regional banks stop lending because how do you build up your bank capital? The best way to build up bank capital is to stop lending.
00:03:21.308 - 00:03:21.772, Speaker B: Right.
00:03:21.828 - 00:03:27.812, Speaker A: Right. They've got the duration stuff. They can't just easily unload. That's the problem. The other stuff they have are loans. They can loan less.
00:03:27.908 - 00:03:29.304, Speaker B: Yeah, they loan less.
00:03:29.724 - 00:03:59.032, Speaker A: Do you, would you say, like, broadly speaking, that part of the thing that gave the Fed the power, the comfort to continue? Cause a lot on the street. We're saying maybe a pause right now. I had talked to some smart people who said that anything other than a pause could be a massive policy blunder, was a quote. Somebody said to me, is it because they're out here saying, we're backstopping the banking system anyway? So, like, what's interesting is, so why.
00:03:59.048 - 00:04:40.526, Speaker B: Did the market roll over? And even crypto roll over is during Powell's press conference, Yellen was quoted at her own press conference on something else, saying, well, we're not going to actually raise the deposit insurance level at this point. And that was seen as really negative. I have no idea what the context of that was. I think there was a big school of thought among central bankers that if they paused, people would see it as, God, things are much worse than they are interesting. And you saw five or six central bankers on the tape, ex central bankers, saying that. And so I thought they should pause and say, hey, we got new information. We'll see what happens.
00:04:40.526 - 00:04:44.434, Speaker B: We got another meeting in six weeks. What's the big deal?
00:04:45.534 - 00:04:50.838, Speaker A: Right? And they sort of step it down. They're still not, they didn't do 50, he did 25.
00:04:50.926 - 00:05:14.466, Speaker B: And they'll see what happens next month. My guess is this was the dovish pause that people were thinking about. And that's why fixed income reacted the way it did. I think stocks rolled over a little bit because Yellen spooked them. And again, stocks have bounced, crypto hasn't. So stocks rolled over and then bounced. Crypto rolled over and has rolled over.
00:05:14.466 - 00:05:35.120, Speaker B: I just think that markets are always, prices are set on the margin. It's more buyers versus sellers. A lot of crypto people had bought and got very bowled up. We have to remember we still have a big headwind in government regulation. They are out to get us right now. It is frickin driving me crazy. It feels un american.
00:05:35.120 - 00:05:51.928, Speaker B: I've spent a lot of time in the last three days on phones with politicians, both Dems and Republicans, but, you know, they've got a banking crisis to worry about. They've got a debt ceiling showdown that I know clock is ticking.
00:05:51.976 - 00:05:57.684, Speaker A: We're in emergency measures or whatever they call right now, where they're moving money around in their pockets to pay for the government.
00:06:00.174 - 00:06:11.478, Speaker B: Not high on the priority of most congressmen or senators. There's some that really care about our industry, which is great, but they got bigger fish to fry right now.
00:06:11.526 - 00:06:26.430, Speaker A: Yeah, I've been banging the drum the last week and a half or so, ten days on bitcoin as a really interesting alternative to the banking system just because it was forged during the last financial crisis. The last banking crisis. What are your thoughts on this overall?
00:06:26.502 - 00:07:05.118, Speaker B: Listen, I don't think it's an alternative to moving money around in payments at this point. The reality is just the system isn't big enough for the amount of stuff that happens that says, I think it's a great report card on financial stewardship. One of the reasons bitcoin is rallying and crypto is rallying is because the Fed is going to get easier. We just took a balance sheet, was in the middle of QT and did some QE. But if you look, we took back half of quantitative tightening in three days.
00:07:05.166 - 00:07:05.902, Speaker A: I saw that.
00:07:06.038 - 00:07:53.094, Speaker B: And bitcoin has always been a response to populism. Governments can't stop spending money, and they did the right thing bailing out the depositors. It cost money. And so as the market perceives, there's no way they're getting out of this giant 130% of debt to GDP without monetizing it. It just helps the narrative of bitcoin. Also instant settlement. All the other parts of crypto, stable coins literally should be smiling right now, because how you move money around on the weekends and being able to move money offshore and all of that stuff, the crypto rails get highlighted at a time like this.
00:07:53.094 - 00:08:11.322, Speaker B: I think it's a fundamental right. People should be able to buy any asset they want to store their hard earned wealth. And so it's crazy. The government has tried to impede us from owning bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, but they are. Yeah.
00:08:11.418 - 00:08:28.310, Speaker A: What gets you excited about the opportunity? I mean, obviously, 2022 was. I'm gonna use a euphemism here. It was a rocky year in markets. It was rocky in the crypto infrastructure space. Obviously, galaxy, we're still here building. What gets you excited about Galaxy and the opportunity for crypto?
00:08:28.382 - 00:09:23.002, Speaker B: Listen, the one thing I am positive at is that our firm, our people, and the whole industry is resilient as hell. I spent my life as a wrestler, and so we pride ourselves on being tough and resilient. But, man, crypto guys are maybe not as tough as wrestlers, but they're pretty damn tough, and they're creative and resilient. And so bitcoin has rallied from 17 to 28, despite Elizabeth Warren and Gary Gensler and regulators around the world trying to smash us, despite fraudsters like Sam Bankman Freed and Kyle Davies and Zoo, whatever his name is, defrauding people, despite block Phi and Celsius and Genesis being poorly managed. Right. And so we had all kinds of crap. And despite all that, were higher in price.
00:09:23.002 - 00:09:47.028, Speaker B: Higher in price. Not because giant institutions are buying tons of it, because crypto is a community based project. Bitcoin, Ethereum have giant communities that believe in it and care about it. Retail is driving us back. There are institutional buyers. We've had hedge funds buying. Our job is to get institutions, our job at galaxy, into the space.
00:09:47.028 - 00:09:51.612, Speaker B: But I want to give a shout out to the crypto degens.
00:09:51.708 - 00:09:53.372, Speaker A: Yeah, the stackers. The SAT stackers.
00:09:53.428 - 00:10:05.362, Speaker B: SAT stackers. The ogs. They are actually providing the floor and support. And I tell it to politicians all the time. I was like, what are you guys talking about? Like, this is a populist movement. Yeah.
00:10:05.378 - 00:10:06.402, Speaker A: These are your constituents.
00:10:06.458 - 00:10:06.954, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:07.074 - 00:10:10.914, Speaker A: Mike, thank you so much for joining galaxy brains. Great to have you, and we'll talk to you again soon.
