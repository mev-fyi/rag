And so there's a pool of capital that is going to speculate on the election outcome before the election, and then there's a ton more capital that's likely going to make a ton of allocation decisions after the election result is known. And so I think it's pretty clear to me that in a Trump presidency or a Trump victory, crypto should outperform and will be a popular trade for folks that have yet to allocate to the space that are looking to potentially allocate. So I think the election's sort of the biggest kind of catalyst that's in the market and in terms of what price action is going to do, leading in.
