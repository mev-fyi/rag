00:00:08.080 - 00:00:12.054, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, welcome to the show, Bim.
00:00:12.134 - 00:00:13.310, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:13.462 - 00:00:25.874, Speaker A: So, obviously, the big stories of this week has been the regulatory actions, the civil suits brought by the SEC against Coinbase and binance. So let's just start right there. Any impact on markets?
00:00:26.514 - 00:00:46.082, Speaker B: Bitcoin is currently trading at 26,610. It was trading basically 27,000 before the announcement came out. While I think there are very meaningful implications for the broader industry, of course, for bitcoin in particular, I don't think there was any implications.
00:00:46.178 - 00:00:47.266, Speaker A: Yeah, down a tiny bit.
00:00:47.290 - 00:01:28.560, Speaker B: Right down a tiny bit. But these cases ultimately don't really impact, you know, things that are commodities, specifically commodities. And so bitcoin trades well. Anecdotally, most of the folks we talked to, they were really impressed by the fact that bitcoin held up so well. And like the macro types we talk through, there's generally, like, an apathetic sort of kind of view about it. Most folks have a bag. They've properly sized it in their portfolio, given the volatility, and then nobody's scrambling to add more, but nobody's trying to sell either.
00:01:28.560 - 00:02:19.814, Speaker B: And so that's why bitcoin has just kind of hovered where it's been hovering for the past several months. And so I think it's quite healthy to see a very resilient asset like this. It's still up more than 50% on the year, still one of the best performing asset classes. It's liquid, it's legal. And so there's a lot of positive cross currents for bitcoin. In addition, you've definitely seen some selling of alts, particularly those named in the suits. And generally speaking, when you have a risk off move in crypto, folks sell alts and rotate into bitcoin when folks are worried about balances on exchange or et cetera.
00:02:19.814 - 00:02:59.068, Speaker B: Again, it's bitcoin into cold storage. And so bitcoin definitely benefits from a flight to quality phenomenon in crypto on a relative basis. And so I think that partially explains some of the resilience behind it. In addition, it's really a market that trades at Max Payne right now. And so folks that short at bad levels, nine times out of ten will get squeezed. And that might have to do with how the market makers operate or whatever, but it is a market that does trade to Max Payne. In addition, you just think about this asset over Memorial Day weekend.
00:02:59.068 - 00:03:55.438, Speaker B: You basically went up to 28,500 from similar levels to now, for no real reason, no real reason, it was just a short squeeze. And so I think this is an asset class that's probably likely going to remain relatively range bound. Basically, everything has been thrown at bitcoin collapses of three arrows, FTX. Now you got the regulatory stuff, the regulatory stuff, the cases, 500 plus basis points of hiking domestically and all tight financial conditions everywhere around the globe, et cetera. And this thing is still holding up really well. And I think, taking a step back, I think that bodes well for the long run future of this asset and the asset class in general. The fact that it's holding up so well in the context of the world's most important government and regulatory agency kind of clamping down on things.
00:03:55.438 - 00:04:41.936, Speaker B: And so I'm optimistic. In addition, I do think that the macro will eventually start to be supportive of things like bitcoin and precious metals and hedges against monetary debasement. To be honest, I thought the biggest news over the past month was the fact that we raised the debt ceiling indefinitely, well, to a specific time, but no cap in theory. And we are going to spend money recklessly without abandon for the next couple of years. And so is every other g ten economy. And, yeah, I mean, the monetary argument becomes apparent every day. It's like one of those things where it's like, wait, our debt goes up every day and it's like, we got to pay interest on it.
00:04:41.936 - 00:05:18.464, Speaker B: And your ability to pay back, that reduces every single day. Every day, bitcoin's around more credible, more participants, more adoption. And so it's one of those things that you just, you know, just need to give it time. And, yeah, I mean, I wish I could fast forward four years and, you know, tell you where bitcoin's gonna be. But I feel pretty confident in saying that, you know, it'll be around, there'll be tons of folks transacting in it in novel ways, potentially, you know, ordinals, whatever it may be. But the monetary argument is only gonna have gotten much, much stronger in four years time, I can tell you that for sure.
00:05:19.324 - 00:05:51.044, Speaker A: That was great. Love the overview, Bim, and I totally agree. Let me, let me just shift gears. We'll do one little question here, though. It's not a little question, but before we wrap, because sort of in our long line of periodic things that I've asked Bimnet Abibi about, as I'm learning macro myself, one was that I saw Balaji Srinivasan, who is the former CTO at Coinbase separately, and an entrepreneur. And he's also the guy right he had the $1 million call price call, which, of course didn't happen for bitcoin.
00:05:51.124 - 00:05:52.764, Speaker B: Or he doesn't know how to price options.
00:05:52.844 - 00:06:06.500, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. But he tweeted a chart that I believe that what the chart said was, was that it has been 14 consecutive months in a row where non farm payrolls have come in, have beaten expectations, or not beaten.
00:06:06.612 - 00:06:08.220, Speaker B: To have beaten expectations, have beaten expectations.
00:06:08.292 - 00:06:33.394, Speaker A: And that's like, by far the longest streak ever. And essentially was suggesting that the BLS data is raw, fake, or manipulated. People have said that in the past. I found a tweet from 2011 where Jack Welch, the former CEO of General Motors or GE, whichever, the owner of GM or whatever, Jack Welch, famous corporate guy, he said the same thing about the BLS data back then. Is that possible?
00:06:35.534 - 00:07:02.432, Speaker B: I will say one more and more serious. Folks that have looked at this data for decades are highlighting that there's some abnormalities. For sure. There are some things that stick out. And 14 months of consecutive upward beats is very surprising. However, it's not in the context of what we know about the labor market. It is really hot.
00:07:02.432 - 00:07:03.160, Speaker B: Right?
00:07:03.352 - 00:07:05.952, Speaker A: So the broad trend is like, you disagree with that?
00:07:05.968 - 00:07:58.238, Speaker B: It's accurate. And so one, I'd like to stress that non farm payrolls is one piece of data. Right? There are tons of other data pieces to properly contextualize the US labor market. The ADP payroll data, that is a private data series produced by one of the largest payroll processing companies, still supports these massive job games. They're saying they're adding hundreds of thousands of jobs as well. The employment components of PMIs and all of these surveys and NFIB data, et cetera. And you can see it in high frequency data, too, like MTA travel and like, you know, in Memorial Day, you had more planes in the sky than ever.
00:07:58.238 - 00:08:07.526, Speaker B: Yeah, right. And so there are ways to properly contextualize the data. With that being said, this data smells funky for sure.
00:08:07.590 - 00:08:13.078, Speaker A: Something wrong with that BLS data, but it's directionally telling you the same thing. All the other trustworthy data saying to.
00:08:13.086 - 00:09:09.376, Speaker B: Your, yeah, fair enough. The other. The weird part about this, though is like for the past two months, you've had a very high adjustment investment in this thing known as death birth component, which is, I believe, estimates how many net new jobs were created as a function of a business starting versus a business going out of business. There are weird things like that in the data that have thrown it off for the past couple of months, like looking at it with a grain of salt. And I think a lot of serious people are looking at it with a grain of salt. However, it's just important to stress that it's not our only measure, and realistically, it's not even, it's not the main priority for the central bank right now. The central priority is inflation, getting inflation down.
00:09:09.376 - 00:09:52.716, Speaker B: And on Tuesday, you've got core CPI that's expected to print at 0.4 month on month. You've had the Royal bank, the RBA, the Bank of Canada surprise hike over the past week because inflation's been too high and data has been too strong in general. And so you're dealing with a Fed that has really no choice but to keep going until prices come down. However, I do think that the committee is as split as they've ever been in this hiking cycle. There are more divergent opinions. In addition, I do think that there are pockets of weak data that are now starting to sort of materialize.
00:09:52.716 - 00:11:12.686, Speaker B: In addition, I think the supply outlook for Treasuries is going to be a much more important factor, especially over the next three to four months as the Treasury's general account builds. But high level, we're going to need to fund a lot of us debt, and that money has to come from somewhere. It's either RRP or bank reserves, and most likely a lot of it's going to come from bank reserves. A decent amount will come from RRP, but that's going to be a liquidity drain on the market, and there's going to have to be a lot of treasury supply that gets absorbed by the market, take reserves down in the broader market to very, like, tight levels, and eventually that's going to catch up to the Fed. And I think they're thinking about it now as to when they might have to ultimately stop doing QT and not necessarily do QE, but at least stop the tightening, stop the tightening, et cetera, when they'll have a serious issue with banks and they'll have to try to re steepen the yield curve, et cetera. And so the Fed's got visibility into that. However, the data, especially the price data, has just been so strong recently that it's just, it's tough to even want to.
00:11:12.686 - 00:11:13.654, Speaker B: People are going to want to spend.
00:11:13.694 - 00:11:19.958, Speaker A: Money over the summer, too, right? People want to get outside and spend money, go to baseball games and whatnot, buy hot dogs, whatever americans do, right?
00:11:20.006 - 00:11:28.774, Speaker B: You know, I hate hot dogs and I think baseball is boring. But you prefer to spend some money this summer. Yeah, I'm ready. I'm ready to hit the beach.
00:11:28.854 - 00:11:33.674, Speaker A: Yeah, let's. Hey, Bimnet, a BB from galaxy trading. My friend, as always, great to see you. Pleasure.
