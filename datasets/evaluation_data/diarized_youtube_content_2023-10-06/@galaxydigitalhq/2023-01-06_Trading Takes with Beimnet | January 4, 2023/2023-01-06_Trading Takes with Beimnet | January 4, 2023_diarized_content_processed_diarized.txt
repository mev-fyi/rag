00:00:06.920 - 00:00:11.446, Speaker A: Let's go to our friend Bimnet of BB Galaxy digital trading. Bimnet, great to see you in the new year.
00:00:11.550 - 00:00:13.582, Speaker B: Thanks for having me. Happy new year, Alex. Yeah.
00:00:13.598 - 00:00:15.886, Speaker A: How are your holidays? And they were great.
00:00:15.990 - 00:00:17.806, Speaker C: You know, would have been better if.
00:00:17.870 - 00:00:21.838, Speaker B: Crypto rallied a lot more, but, you know, I'll take whatever I can get.
00:00:21.886 - 00:00:24.046, Speaker A: At least it was relatively quiet, right?
00:00:24.110 - 00:00:30.270, Speaker C: You know, you know, no middle of Christmas or New Year's calls or anything like that.
00:00:30.302 - 00:00:44.158, Speaker A: There was one. I remember what would have been like maybe 2019. There was a pretty big dump right around the holidays that all the desks were sending color. Like some poor person. That was the one person keeping the lights on over the holiday.
00:00:44.286 - 00:00:44.710, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:00:44.782 - 00:00:48.030, Speaker B: No, I mean, that's a story as old as time.
00:00:48.142 - 00:00:57.118, Speaker C: You know, holiday season teams are understaffed. A lot of young folks on the desks leads to crazy moves in certain.
00:00:57.166 - 00:01:21.022, Speaker A: Instances, especially our markets, which are 24 7365. All right, so let's get into it. I mean, we talked a lot about last year on the last podcast two weeks ago. So let's instead maybe look at today and a little bit going forward. It seems pretty quiet out there. I mean, crypto, I mean, bitcoin volatility, I didn't rerun the table today, but, like, we might be at like the lowest ever on a 30 day historical volatility basis.
00:01:21.118 - 00:01:22.454, Speaker C: It certainly feels that way.
00:01:22.534 - 00:01:23.194, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:23.654 - 00:01:50.628, Speaker C: Again, it just speaks to an absence of activity, both buying and selling. I think a lot of the forced selling from miners has already gone through, and there's not really sort of new institutions like begging to pile into bitcoin right now. In fact, honestly, I think the institutional side has been piling into traditional gold more so than bitcoin.
00:01:50.676 - 00:01:53.172, Speaker A: Gold has been rallying. It has for pretty much a month.
00:01:53.188 - 00:02:24.556, Speaker C: And a half or so. Yeah, it set its lows in late October, early November, around the mid 16 hundreds, and it's now trading at like 1860 and change. It's kind of crazy. In a year where markets were down 20% and change bonds were down 15%, plus dollar went up 15% and change gold was actually flat in all of 2022, and it has started 2023 trading very well. I think there's a number of reasons.
00:02:24.580 - 00:02:28.624, Speaker B: Why it's trading well, but I think, one, there's a general lack of positioning.
00:02:29.124 - 00:02:37.344, Speaker C: Two, I think you've had some central banks on the bid as they're looking to move away from western based money.
00:02:37.924 - 00:02:43.504, Speaker B: But also just generally speaking, I think there's pretty strong seasonals over the next.
00:02:44.644 - 00:02:46.288, Speaker C: That have been happening.
00:02:46.476 - 00:02:53.776, Speaker B: So those have been supporting gold. Again, though, I think the same thesis.
00:02:53.880 - 00:03:10.240, Speaker C: Should be applying for bitcoin. And I kind of think that eventually, once people get comfortable with counterparty risk and more comfortable with the idea of investing in crypto, again, I do think that you'll start to see the digital.
00:03:10.312 - 00:03:15.334, Speaker B: Gold narrative start to take hold again, particularly if this year kind of plays.
00:03:15.374 - 00:03:22.262, Speaker C: Out like I think it will, which is very aggressive.
00:03:22.318 - 00:03:29.614, Speaker B: Well, it really depends. But if you get a hard landing scenario, that's going to incite a very.
00:03:29.694 - 00:03:35.190, Speaker C: Easy response from the Fed, a very aggressive response in terms of cutting rates.
00:03:35.222 - 00:03:38.278, Speaker B: And printing more money. And that should be good for things.
00:03:38.326 - 00:03:42.872, Speaker C: Like, you know, crypto and bitcoin, if you do get to that hard landing and, you know, you have to switch.
00:03:42.968 - 00:03:43.604, Speaker B: Right.
00:03:44.064 - 00:03:46.784, Speaker C: But again, it's still tough.
00:03:46.864 - 00:03:47.144, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:03:47.184 - 00:03:52.096, Speaker A: So gold, what about other commodities? I mean, last year was a pretty big year for commodities in general.
00:03:52.160 - 00:03:53.084, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:03:53.944 - 00:04:24.652, Speaker B: Again, it was kind of like a roller coaster. Like last year, oil started kind of around here, like seventies, like eighties, then went up to like 100, 2130, and then now just came back down to like the low seventies. And so it's been a roller coaster. And I do think that fundamentally we are setting up for renewed strength in the commodity complex. One of those key reasons being the chinese reopening, that's 1.31.4 billion people that.
00:04:24.668 - 00:04:35.670, Speaker C: Have been saving money for three years. They're starting to travel again. I think once they get through this period of mass infections and get, you know, closer to meaningful levels of herd.
00:04:35.702 - 00:04:38.094, Speaker B: Immunity, that's gonna be a lot of.
00:04:38.174 - 00:04:42.406, Speaker C: Sort of activity that's gonna go back into the economy that should be supportive.
00:04:42.510 - 00:04:56.914, Speaker B: Of the commodity complex. In addition, generally speaking, the economy is okay. The US is doing fine, the employment market is fine, it's healthy.
00:04:57.334 - 00:04:59.706, Speaker C: I think that's also sort of constructive.
00:04:59.790 - 00:05:03.666, Speaker B: For the commodity complex. And then the last component is really the dollar.
00:05:03.770 - 00:05:06.290, Speaker C: Every commodity is based on the price of dollars.
00:05:06.402 - 00:05:13.890, Speaker B: I just kind of like, I'm a little bearish to the dollar here in the context of if you think about what the risks are in the market.
00:05:13.962 - 00:05:18.322, Speaker C: And it's inflation shooting much, much higher.
00:05:18.498 - 00:05:21.674, Speaker B: And the ECB, the BOJ and other.
00:05:21.834 - 00:05:23.266, Speaker C: And those two central banks in particular.
00:05:23.330 - 00:05:24.482, Speaker B: Have a lot more to go in.
00:05:24.498 - 00:05:27.810, Speaker C: Terms of raising interest rate policy and tightening financial conditions.
00:05:27.882 - 00:05:38.510, Speaker B: So if we go a lot higher in terms of inflation, those currencies, I think will do better. And then on the flip side, if we get the hard landing and stuff.
00:05:38.622 - 00:05:45.234, Speaker C: Again, just because of how far ahead the US is, they're going to be cutting more aggressively earlier.
00:05:47.014 - 00:06:10.598, Speaker B: No. Or just they're cutting from a much higher level. And so it kind of feels a little asymmetric on the dollar strength side of things. And so if you get a weaker dollar chinese economy, that's recovering and sort of continued strength in the US economy, I think that could bode well for the commodity complex.
00:06:10.686 - 00:06:17.894, Speaker A: Interesting. And then I'm looking at equities. It looks pretty tepid out there. I saw big tech is down a bit.
00:06:17.934 - 00:06:18.134, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:06:18.174 - 00:06:29.376, Speaker A: Struggling. It obviously has been, frankly, for a little while, though. We had a little bit of a rally in the end of the year. Does it look anything? Does the picture look different?
00:06:29.520 - 00:06:36.720, Speaker C: No, I think the picture is really easy. Our CEO has been pretty bang on.
00:06:36.752 - 00:06:38.752, Speaker B: About how he's thinking about the market.
00:06:38.808 - 00:06:43.564, Speaker C: And I think it's pretty consistent with other folks, which is basically you're assuming.
00:06:44.904 - 00:07:01.610, Speaker B: Dollar 220 per share in earnings in the S and P this year. That's without forecast really moving down. And if you apply an S and P multiple of 17, that gets you to where the S and P is right now, we don't really think that multiples are going to expand a lot.
00:07:01.682 - 00:07:14.054, Speaker C: Because interest rates are really high and the Fed's hawkish. So it's not like earnings or multiples are really going to expand and there's a potential that they can go lower.
00:07:14.874 - 00:07:22.634, Speaker B: But that leaves you in a scenario where there isn't that much upside risk to stocks and the downside risk, you know, is there.
00:07:23.254 - 00:07:28.118, Speaker C: But I'm not in the panic doom saying camp, doom saying camp, et cetera.
00:07:28.206 - 00:07:42.950, Speaker B: But you're just kind of stuck in this place where you're not really expecting much in terms of returns. So really, what's the point of taking that risk? I'd rather just go into fixed income or better risk adjusted products and not.
00:07:42.982 - 00:07:44.646, Speaker C: Take the risk of being long a.
00:07:44.750 - 00:07:50.480, Speaker B: Growth company or being long tech that's.
00:07:50.552 - 00:07:53.392, Speaker C: Hyper valued and things of that nature.
00:07:53.448 - 00:07:58.576, Speaker B: So I think equities just don't provide good risk reward here, and that you're.
00:07:58.600 - 00:08:02.256, Speaker C: Just supposed to wait for extensions in one direction or the other if you're.
00:08:02.280 - 00:08:43.350, Speaker A: Trying to trade it and then back to crypto. I totally understand the current risk appetite environment and there's a lot of external factors, macro and monetary policy in particular. But at some point, don't you look at these if we're talking about the majors, the bitcoins and eths, don't you look at these if you have a long term view at some point and say, this might be a good entry, no one in big capital seems to be thinking that way yet. So I guess maybe the flip side of the question is how much downside risk do you think there still is in crypto? Hard to know, obviously. So this is more of a. Yeah.
00:08:43.382 - 00:08:46.014, Speaker B: Am I allowed to talk about single name protocols?
00:08:46.094 - 00:08:47.838, Speaker A: Yeah, we can talk about bitcoin ETH, for sure.
00:08:47.926 - 00:08:48.654, Speaker C: Oh, got it.
00:08:48.694 - 00:08:49.006, Speaker A: Got it.
00:08:49.030 - 00:08:50.638, Speaker C: But not. Yeah.
00:08:50.686 - 00:08:55.390, Speaker B: Well, let's just say that there's. There's still a lot of froth in this market. In my opinion.
00:08:55.462 - 00:08:56.070, Speaker C: There is.
00:08:56.182 - 00:09:00.422, Speaker B: You know, there are definitely a lot of l one that are very overvalued.
00:09:00.518 - 00:09:02.062, Speaker A: And have very limited usage.
00:09:02.118 - 00:09:02.782, Speaker B: For sure.
00:09:02.918 - 00:09:07.868, Speaker A: The sort of l one trades from 2021 and two still hanging over.
00:09:07.956 - 00:09:15.344, Speaker B: Exactly. There's still tons of meme tokens that have a lot of value that I think is dubious.
00:09:17.124 - 00:09:21.900, Speaker C: There's one that's going crazy on Solana right now. I saw this bonk, bonk.
00:09:21.972 - 00:09:24.468, Speaker A: Now this is just a random meme token. I mean, we don't know anything about.
00:09:24.556 - 00:09:27.404, Speaker B: Apparently there's utility. You're going to get staking, you're going.
00:09:27.404 - 00:09:28.300, Speaker C: To borrow against it.
00:09:28.332 - 00:10:06.686, Speaker B: Staking is not utility. But right now, that froth is still there. That froth is still there. So, taking a step back, my landscape of crypto is you've got long only types that believe in the sort of big tokens, and you've got the venture guys that are just playing in the venture arena. Then you've got your sort of speculators, your professional speculators and market makers, and then you've got retail. Retail. They're basically not coming back for a really long time.
00:10:06.686 - 00:10:31.212, Speaker B: They've gotten hurt a lot. $900 million in Gemini earn USt Luna collapSe, FTX Voyagers bridge hacks, Celsius Bridge hacks, nfts that have come down a lot in price. Meme tokens that have come down a lot in price. It's not just in crypto, but in stock markets. They've also done poorly. So I think retails on the mend.
00:10:31.388 - 00:10:34.436, Speaker C: You've got a lot of market makers.
00:10:34.500 - 00:11:09.492, Speaker B: That were taken out on stretchers because of various collapses, various collapses, et cetera. And then speculators, they're a little bit limited right now because, one, they lost liquidity of a major exchange with perps, et cetera. The lending market is frozen a lot. So that leaves you with prove market, which is speculators versus speculators and trickles of long only and venture money coming in. But you also have to think about the supply that's coming into the market.
00:11:09.588 - 00:11:10.964, Speaker C: Obviously, there's the bitcoin supply.
00:11:11.004 - 00:11:14.188, Speaker B: But there's still venture positions that are unlocking.
00:11:14.236 - 00:11:18.060, Speaker A: Yeah. Particularly on those Alt L1 s. There's a lot of those.
00:11:18.132 - 00:11:48.152, Speaker B: And then there's stuff that has to get sold as a function of bankruptcies. So we know about supply and we know that the speculation in one direction or the other is not going to go that extreme. And then you have to put that in the context of what is the liquidity like in the market. And liquidity is not great, particularly, versus three to six months ago, even though you might be deceived by the headline figures.
00:11:48.208 - 00:11:48.736, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay.
00:11:48.760 - 00:12:26.900, Speaker B: There's a couple yards of bitcoin that traded between 16 eight and 16 seven. Been trading there for a week or whatever. So point is, liquidity's then market participants have shrunk. The pie has definitely shrunk. There's still supply coming in, and there's still tokens that are in theory worth probably more than they should be. And then the other thing to think about is in terms of what is there to do in crypto right now. If it isn't to speculate, it's to yield farm.
00:12:26.900 - 00:12:35.524, Speaker B: But the yield farm opportunities aren't really there, and they're probably not worth it on a risk adjusted basis right now in terms of smart contract risk bridging.
00:12:35.644 - 00:12:39.060, Speaker A: Especially with all the fixed income rates where they are as well.
00:12:39.172 - 00:12:56.694, Speaker B: Yeah. And you're not getting paid on your stables unless you're farming. And so it's a very tricky outlook for the market. But in terms of the players in the space and trying to understand the market construct, it's actually pretty clear right now.
00:12:58.314 - 00:13:12.414, Speaker A: Yeah, very, very interesting. So we're going to be waiting around then, I guess, while we're. And it seems like a lot of the markets are pretty, not just crypto, but equities too. We're sort of range bound is your outlook for the near term?
00:13:13.004 - 00:13:38.684, Speaker B: I think range bound is fine, but the way I would think about it is, I think more than any other time in markets, I think you just have to be respectful of new information being data dependent. Essentially, the Fed claims they are. But if you see unemployment start to tick up massively, yeah, we might be going into a harder landing scenario, but I don't think that's the case.
00:13:38.804 - 00:13:40.588, Speaker A: But you got to be focusing on that data.
00:13:40.676 - 00:14:10.584, Speaker B: On the data, economic data and little signs here and there. I mean, there's a central bank that hasn't even gotten off negative rates yet, and their bond market has just started to move. And you could cause, I mean, there's some pretty scary tail scenarios about Asia, Asia FX and fixed income if the bank of Japan really starts going. And so you just have to be kind of nimble and data dependent. And that's kind of what I would recommend to folks for this year.
00:14:10.994 - 00:14:22.114, Speaker A: If you liked our conversation with Bim net, recall that it's part of our weekly podcast Galaxy brains, which you can listen to everywhere on every platform and check out all the links are at Galaxybrains IO.
