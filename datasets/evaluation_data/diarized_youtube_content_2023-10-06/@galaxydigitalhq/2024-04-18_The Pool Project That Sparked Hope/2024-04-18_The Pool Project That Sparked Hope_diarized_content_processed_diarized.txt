It was built as part of what was hoped to be a Texas state park during the decade that Texas was starting to build out its state parks. It's a little bit too small for that, but it's a beautiful structure, and it galvanized and excited everyone in the community when the project for the swimming pool was unveiled. So we can't wait to see that come to pass. For years, that defunct pool has been iconic with representing what's wrong with a small town. And if Galaxy can turn that around, that will be huge. You can see a swimming pool that sits empty as symbolic of the drain of water resources, but also the brain drain resources.
