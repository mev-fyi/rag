00:00:00.240 - 00:00:24.054, Speaker A: But the other thing is the crypto wealth effect. I mean most people who own any crypto own some bitcoin. So even if bitcoin is leading a rally higher and capital literally isn't flowing from bitcoin into other coins, well the people that own those other coins are feeling richer so they just raise their offers. Basically the prices still just go up for other coins. So it can have that beta effect anyway.
00:00:24.174 - 00:00:53.274, Speaker B: So the wealth effect you can, that is manifest in several different categories. So I think you see the wealth effect will impact early stage investments in the ecosystem, whether that's equity investments into things that just promote the vibrancy of these ecosystems, tokens that are being built on top of these platforms. You'll see the wealth effect impact that. I think on the regulatory front, I think you'll see the wealth effect impact political donations to pro crypto candidates. So yeah, as the number goes up I think all of those things become more in place.
