You have it becoming more institutionalized through the ETF's and that coming online. And so the combination of those things as well as, as long as there isn't a major negative catalyst, I mean, we'll see what happens with Gox. We'll see what happens with some of these wallets where we see governments moving things.

And I think people are positioning accordingly.
