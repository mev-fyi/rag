00:00:00.720 - 00:00:02.193, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:02.289 - 00:00:03.805, Speaker B: An infinite amount of cash.
00:00:04.385 - 00:00:11.985, Speaker A: I'm your host Alex Thorne. The US banking system is sound and resilient. Bitcoin made a new all time high. If you're not long.
00:00:12.065 - 00:00:19.365, Speaker B: If you're not long, you're short. Satoshi's gonna come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet. All bitcoin's gonna be erased.
00:00:19.665 - 00:00:20.393, Speaker A: Bitcoin.
00:00:20.489 - 00:00:24.913, Speaker B: Bitcoin's the best crypto. Bitcoin is going to zero.
00:00:25.089 - 00:00:47.517, Speaker A: Welcome back to Galaxy Brains. As always, I'm your host Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Bitcoin not zero. And we have a great epis for you this week. Dan Held from Taproot Wizards Trust Machines and now Asymmetric's Bitcoin Defi Venture fund is our guest. We'll talk with Dan at length about defi on Bitcoin. Bitcoin L2s Interesting stuff that Dan is seeing. He's a repeat guest.
00:00:47.517 - 00:01:13.815, Speaker A: And of course we'll check in with our good friend Binmet, a BB from Galaxy Trading, as always to talk about markets. Big day, Fed day. Before we get to that, I need to remind you to please refer to link to the disclaimer in the podcast notes and note that none of the information this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer recommendation or solicitation by Galaxy or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Let's hop right into the show. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:01:14.595 - 00:01:15.859, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:01:16.027 - 00:01:18.135, Speaker A: Big day today. Fed day.
00:01:19.235 - 00:01:20.507, Speaker C: Almost a Super Bowl.
00:01:20.611 - 00:01:37.981, Speaker A: Well, it did. They came out and they, they, they cut rates by 50 basis points. It seemed like markets were ultimately pricing right around there, but still even I'm actually in Asia right now, but waking up to see the headlines. Seems like there was surprise.
00:01:38.133 - 00:02:31.889, Speaker C: No, there was a little bit of surprise for sure, but I think high level. What the main thing you got to take away from this is that the easing cycle has begun. Right. This is the first time we're cutting rates since basically Covid and we started with a cut that was about was significant enough to actually matter with 50 basis points. It was a small surprise to the market in the sense that you only had 40 basis points priced in going in and so there was some chance that folks were thinking 25. Besides that, I do think it was the appropriate decision. We've seen the labor market start to show signs of cooling.
00:02:31.889 - 00:03:25.465, Speaker C: Inflation has calmed down materially. The employment side of the mandate is important to focus on at the moment. And so when you're already at 525 to 550 and you're seeing the data head in this direction, it's entirely appropriate to cut rates by 50 basis points. There's a couple of things that I thought were notable. One, you did have a dissent for the first time in a while by Fed member Bowman, who wanted 25 basis points. Secondly, they changed their unemployment forecast for the end of 2025 in terms of the unemployment rate to 4.4%, which is an uptick from here.
00:03:25.465 - 00:04:16.905, Speaker C: But it does show that that is kind of what they're thinking in terms of where the labor market is headed. We're probably going to slow down, but there was plenty in the presser that kind of acknowledge the fact that the economy is still in a half decent shape. Growth figures are pretty reasonable. If you look at Atlanta GDP now forecast for Q3 GDP, that's almost close to 3% on an annualized basis. If you look at other metrics that measure economic activity, nothing's really falling off a cliff. And so Powell was definitely kind of cognizant of the fact that stuff's still fine. Basically the path to a soft landing is still there.
00:04:16.905 - 00:05:17.045, Speaker C: And so I do think that the market was caught a little bit by surprise in the sense that you did see fixed income sell off, particularly stuff a little bit further out the curve. And that's just largely a function of like cutting 50 basis points now doesn't mean that they're going to go by 50bps increments on a go forward. In fact, in the dot plot it suggests that they're going to go another 25 and then another 25 meetings, 25 bips in the last meeting of the year to get to, you know, cumulatively 100 basis points cut by the December meeting. And so I think that's probably the appropriate stance of monetary policy. The market reaction though was very volatile. You had stocks rip higher S and p up a percent and then it's finishing the day down like 35 basis points at the moment. Gold hit fresh all time highs.
00:05:17.045 - 00:05:31.405, Speaker C: Then it's going to finish down on the day. Bitcoin, 61k and change. And now you're kind of hovering right around 60k is kind of what it seems like. And so the price reaction was volatile, but again it was expected to be volatile.
00:05:32.505 - 00:06:13.659, Speaker A: Yeah, we're finally in a new regime. From a rate standpoint, which I think is the most interesting part, you've been among the most clear thinkers that I've heard over the last year explaining that rate cuts does not automatically mean bullishness for risk assets, that if rate cuts are necessary, it means possibly weakness in the broader economy, which is bearish. Right. I mean, it's bad if the economy is not doing well. Do you think that it was justified of 50bps? Does it not? See, you know, you said it was. But is the fear about a recession warranting such a, you know, a 50bps cut, not a steady 25?
00:06:13.747 - 00:07:27.763, Speaker C: Well, so I mean, the way I would think about it is, you know, he did the 50bp cut, but he also guided, you know, or they guided via the dot plot, that they're going to go in smaller increments. And so, you know, and he signaled a willingness to basically adjust policy based on the data and you know, if they need to move less frequently or by smaller magnitude, he signaled that he was willing to do that. And so I do think that this struck the right kind of balanced tone where this wasn't like a panic 50 basis point cut. It was more like given the employment data they had since the July meeting, it seemed like they should have probably started cutting in the July meeting, you know, 25bps and then another 25bps for the September meeting. And so it kind of seemed like they were just catching up to kind of where, where the data was not necessarily kind of being like on a go forward basis, stuff's going to be so bad that we got to cut 50. And so that's kind of how it was framed. And it kind of made me less concerned that the Fed was going to incite that type of panic reaction by cutting 50 because of the set of circumstances around it.
00:07:27.763 - 00:08:23.517, Speaker C: But high level, you're right in the sense that I do think that if we are going down a recessionary path or a hard landing path, if that's more likely than a soft landing path, I think equities are very mispriced. To give you guys some context, I think earnings growth for the Magnificent Seven in 2025 is expected to be like 14%. And for the rest of the 493 stocks in the S&P 500 is expected to be around 9%. And so that's a lot of growth to have in an economy that might be slowing down a lot. And so I just think that there's a little bit of a disconnect between, you know, the Fed cutting rates because stuff softening and kind of where forward earnings growth is expected to be. And so that's what I'm cognizant of right now, particularly because you had the S and P at an all time high yesterday.
00:08:23.581 - 00:08:24.861, Speaker A: Right, right.
00:08:24.933 - 00:09:10.073, Speaker C: And so your risk reward for holding these risk assets isn't, you know, it didn't seem that attractive. But I will caveat that with saying that generally when you ease monetary policy and you ease financial conditions, that's broadly supportive of risk from the simple standpoint that cash ultimately has lesser value. But right now, the cash rates are still juicy, it's still very compelling, but it can't be said enough that, you know, if the Fed did cut by like 400 basis points, like that would probably be very risk. So it just. All else equal.
00:09:10.129 - 00:09:25.605, Speaker A: All right, lastly, on this topic, and in general, what about the balance sheet? The Fed balance sheet, I mean, they're cutting the overnight rate here, the minimum rate, the Fed funds rate. But is there any hint of any further Fed action on their balance sheet side?
00:09:26.605 - 00:10:35.685, Speaker C: Nothing concrete. Basically, they stuck with the policy stance that continued balance sheet normalization while lowering interest rates is kind of consistent policy because they're on one end, they're just kind of managing the balance sheet of the Fed to kind of get to more normal. I mean, it kind of like just backing up. Like the Fed balance sheet is so big that if they do like even go back to $100 billion a month in runoff, it's still not doing a whole lot from the standpoint that there's still a ton of net dollars outside of not net, but there's a lot of dollars that offset that balance sheet runoff. The Fed pays out 5% and change on all of the excess reserves in the banking system. That's a ton of money that's flowing back into the economy and things like that. And so just because they're reducing, they've gotten the pace of runoff to a reasonable level and they're continuing.
00:10:35.685 - 00:11:08.165, Speaker C: It doesn't mean that it's really doing that much impact. And so it's at a place where I think the impact is relatively benign. But from a policy consistency standpoint, you know, there are a lot of market participants that are like, you're cutting rates, but you're still running off the balance sheet. That seems inconsistent. And what the Fed is trying to do is trying to communicate the fact that it is consistent policy because you're just normalizing things to healthy levels, both in interest rates and in balance sheet policy.
00:11:08.245 - 00:11:12.105, Speaker A: All right, my friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Trading, as always, thank you so much.
00:11:12.965 - 00:11:13.867, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:11:13.941 - 00:11:24.151, Speaker A: Go. Let's go now to our guest, Dan Held. General partner at Asymmetric's Bitcoin Defi Venture Fund. Dan, welcome back to Galaxy Brains.
00:11:24.223 - 00:11:26.223, Speaker B: Thanks. Loving, Loving being back in New York.
00:11:26.279 - 00:11:39.229, Speaker A: Yeah. It's your second appearance. There's not many people who've been on the show multiple times. I think it's other than, like Internal, you know, Tyler Williams, our head of policy, who comes on a fairly large amount. It's like Nick Carter, basically, I think, is like the only real repeat guest.
00:11:39.407 - 00:11:41.337, Speaker B: Well, I feel. I feel honored, you know.
00:11:41.441 - 00:11:47.273, Speaker A: Well, both you and Nick possess a Taproot wizard honorific on your Twitter.
00:11:47.289 - 00:12:04.233, Speaker B: Literary Taproot Wizard. That's right, yeah. So for those who aren't familiar, the Taproot wizards are an NFT collection on bitcoin. And there were honoraries created that were one of ones for folks who were prominent in the industry. And Nick and I both got one. By the way, the process behind that's pretty funny.
00:12:04.289 - 00:12:04.505, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:12:04.545 - 00:12:05.273, Speaker B: And I don't think the guys.
00:12:05.329 - 00:12:09.627, Speaker A: Because I think some of the other ones that I'm aware of. Jameson Loppers has one. Arthur Hayes.
00:12:09.691 - 00:12:10.619, Speaker B: Arthur Hayes. One was great.
00:12:10.667 - 00:12:11.251, Speaker A: It's phenomenal.
00:12:11.323 - 00:12:13.691, Speaker B: The coconut was brilliant. And he likes to snowboard.
00:12:13.763 - 00:12:14.251, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:12:14.363 - 00:12:16.655, Speaker B: Did you see the Casey Rotimore one?
00:12:16.955 - 00:12:19.243, Speaker A: What is Casey? No, I don't think I did. What is that? What is his.
00:12:19.299 - 00:12:22.251, Speaker B: I presented it on stage to him at Bitcoin Nashville.
00:12:22.283 - 00:12:23.579, Speaker A: I mean, I was there. I just don't remember.
00:12:23.667 - 00:12:28.155, Speaker B: It's fucking crazy looking. I mean, it's got. It's got flair. It's pretty cool. Yeah, it's got a lot.
00:12:28.195 - 00:12:35.851, Speaker A: It's cool. Dennis Porto has one because he was the original. One of the probably earliest oper users. Right. Posting arbitrary data to Bitcoin.
00:12:36.003 - 00:13:02.695, Speaker B: Yeah. So, yeah, the honorees, I think that. I think people like the process. The team actually designs that altogether now, Far Francisco, the designer, is the one who designs it. But there is, like an interesting feedback process where we want to subtly troll folks. You know, I didn't do the ones before I came on board, but then after they made my honorary, I started talking to Udi and Eric and felt there was a good fit there on the marketing side. So that's been a lot of fun working with them over the last year and a half.
00:13:02.695 - 00:13:06.455, Speaker B: They're a blast to work with. Super creative. A really fun brand.
00:13:07.315 - 00:13:07.995, Speaker A: Totally.
00:13:08.115 - 00:13:32.247, Speaker B: But, yeah, I have been involved with a few of the honoraries and it's a funny process where it's like a lot of feedback and you're like, what are these little pieces of someone's personality that you can incorporate into an image, which I think makes them extra special. There's also, if you notice, the later ones have a little bit more kind of not tangibility, but almost tactile imagery. Like the beards almost look textured.
00:13:32.311 - 00:13:32.735, Speaker A: Yeah, they do.
00:13:32.775 - 00:13:33.311, Speaker B: That's what I'm trying to say.
00:13:33.343 - 00:13:34.031, Speaker A: They do. Yeah.
00:13:34.103 - 00:13:39.807, Speaker B: Which we. We kind of lament. We're like, man, the. The best honorees are going to the ones who get them at the end because they're like, right.
00:13:39.831 - 00:13:40.663, Speaker A: They get better as you go.
00:13:40.719 - 00:13:42.155, Speaker B: They get better as you go. Yeah.
00:13:42.535 - 00:13:59.655, Speaker A: We'll talk more. Well, I guess we may as well just keep talking Taproot wizards, because I want to talk about Tapper Wizards, but we've got plenty to talk with you about. But since we've started here, we have. It's not just an NFT collection. There's now a couple where they have the Quantum Cats too, which is actually quite interesting from a development standpoint. GMeow, in my opinion. Yeah.
00:13:59.655 - 00:14:00.263, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:00.399 - 00:14:01.931, Speaker B: Is GM still thing?
00:14:02.043 - 00:14:04.643, Speaker A: I. I don't know. Not really. Yeah, it is.
00:14:04.739 - 00:14:05.899, Speaker B: Wag Me is definitely not a thing.
00:14:05.947 - 00:14:06.355, Speaker A: Definitely not.
00:14:06.395 - 00:14:06.915, Speaker B: Definitely not a thing.
00:14:06.955 - 00:14:09.291, Speaker A: I think Mark Zuckerberg Sister killed that one, right, with that song.
00:14:09.323 - 00:14:10.935, Speaker B: Yeah, Randy. Yeah, that was.
00:14:11.355 - 00:14:13.091, Speaker A: That song was. That was rough.
00:14:13.243 - 00:14:17.299, Speaker B: There was like, that and all the brands like Coca Cola and PEPC, like, talking to each other.
00:14:17.427 - 00:14:27.539, Speaker A: Did you just post everything I was going to say? I saw that. Yeah. When they're like, welcome, friend, and it's like, wag me. Oh, God. That might be the most cringe, like, screenshot I've ever seen this on Twitter that we're talking about.
00:14:27.627 - 00:14:29.027, Speaker B: Zero, I think. Yeah, that was.
00:14:29.091 - 00:14:30.163, Speaker A: That's like top signal type stuff.
00:14:30.179 - 00:14:31.197, Speaker B: It's definitely top signal.
00:14:31.291 - 00:14:31.993, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah.
00:14:32.009 - 00:14:58.697, Speaker B: So the Tapper Wizards is the company and they created the Tapper Wizard Collection and Quantum Cats. Quantum Cats represent, I think, the culture and the ethos behind upgrading bitcoin with an opcat, or some people pronounce it opcat. Yeah, Upgrade, which is a soft fork proposal to bitcoin. And so I think that it's. It's interesting because I'd never heard of it. To the best of our knowledge, we've never seen another NFT collection that was associated with like an EIP or a.
00:14:58.761 - 00:15:00.545, Speaker A: No, you know, I'm not aware of one.
00:15:00.665 - 00:15:23.569, Speaker B: Yeah. Which is really cool. Mimetically it is. And I think Udi and Eric are masters of memetic narratives. They really know how to troll people really well on social. But also packing in memes into that message helps propagate that message. So opcat and the Quantum Cat collection was meant to promote that softwork proposal which we fucking memed that from nothing into something.
00:15:23.569 - 00:15:33.999, Speaker B: And again I say we. I was partially involved, but you know, Udi and Eric of course, really doing the heavy lifting. And the rest of team too. We got a phenomenal team over there. We know Alex joined.
00:15:34.047 - 00:15:35.391, Speaker A: Yeah, Rondell's great.
00:15:35.543 - 00:15:37.807, Speaker B: Awesome. Yeah, we.
00:15:37.991 - 00:15:39.823, Speaker A: You got Ben now too. From you Ben.
00:15:39.839 - 00:15:50.151, Speaker B: Carmen. Yeah, yeah, I know he's a good deal. The squad is really good. I'm the only marketing guy. But Udi and Eric are basically marketers. They're, you know, they're really sharp and they know social better than anyone else.
00:15:50.223 - 00:15:50.599, Speaker A: Right.
00:15:50.687 - 00:16:30.699, Speaker B: You know, so yeah. So when I say we, the. The idea behind Quantum Cats was to promote OPCAT which will allow for trustless bridging to Bitcoin L2s. Now people go, well why is that important in the block sized wars? The outcome of that was that we all agreed as the bitcoin community that bitcoin would scale in layers. So that then pushed people to build L2 technologies, liquid rootstock lightning stacks. Those are some of the earliest ones with varying levels of usage and adoption. But we've sort of hindered them in a way because we're pushing all this economic activity to an L2, except there's not trustless bridging.
00:16:30.699 - 00:16:52.635, Speaker B: And trustless bridging, taking your Bitcoin from L1 and bringing it to that L2, it's dangerous. Right now you've got semi decentralized solutions like tbtc, which that's called Threshold btc. So that's basically a federated model. You've got completely centralized ones like wbtc, which there's now a relationship with WBTC and Justin sun.
00:16:53.215 - 00:16:54.951, Speaker A: You don't usually like to hear that.
00:16:54.983 - 00:16:57.639, Speaker B: You know, it just doesn't put a good spin on things.
00:16:57.687 - 00:16:58.183, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:58.319 - 00:17:41.745, Speaker B: And I think that that also kind of highlights this issue of these weak bridges. These weak bridges or these, you know, having to wrap bitcoin and bring it to an L2, doing that in a way that isn't as game theoretically secure as we'd like. Opcat allows for things like that and other things. And so if which we all agreed as a community, this is how we're going to scale. But we left these bridges intentionally weak without these updates to bitcoin. So with these updates we allow for very strong trustless bridging which I think fulfills the social agreement that we all made, which is that if we're going to push people to L2s as Bitcoin L1 becomes congested and has higher fees, which is a good thing. This isn't a bad thing that these would be equivalent game theoretic security wise.
00:17:41.825 - 00:17:58.765, Speaker A: Yeah. And it's not just the scaling, it's the feature set. Right. I mean the idea is that there's also things people want to do with their bitcoin but that perhaps we don't want done on the L1. Right. And so you can maybe with these L. I was going to say the thing with lightning too, which has quite secure.
00:17:58.765 - 00:18:12.505, Speaker A: It's not really bridging though. Right. Because lightning channels are actually just two of two multisigs. They're secure, but that's not. There's no state there. There's no virtual machine. Lightning's a little bit of a different type of L2 in that sense.
00:18:12.505 - 00:18:16.169, Speaker A: So it doesn't really qualify here either. It's not like that's the solution. Right.
00:18:16.297 - 00:18:35.603, Speaker B: Lightning is great. I think a lot of people, I think Udi and Eric and others should on lightning a little too much where lightning is good, but it's not a catch all. I think a lot of the hardcore puritan bitcoiner types, the very conservative types are being very intellectually dishonest by saying lightning solves all these things. It does not. It's cool. It's great. I like it.
00:18:35.659 - 00:18:35.995, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:36.075 - 00:18:38.403, Speaker B: But let all the flowers bloom. Let's see what the L2.
00:18:38.459 - 00:18:51.187, Speaker A: Right. An OPCAT which is like concatenate. Right. Is where it comes from. And let's. I had Ryan Dell urge people to watch the episode with Ryan Dell. He goes much more in depth into the technic technology behind opcat.
00:18:51.187 - 00:18:51.467, Speaker A: So I'm not.
00:18:51.491 - 00:18:52.731, Speaker B: Ryan Dell's far smarter than I am.
00:18:52.763 - 00:19:06.605, Speaker A: Yeah, me too. I'm not going to like, you know, strain myself to try to explain. Exactly. But it allows for building up multiple pieces of data and then being able to refer back to them, creating tables of the data, which just is very powerful let's say. But it was also created by Satoshi.
00:19:06.905 - 00:19:07.409, Speaker B: Right.
00:19:07.497 - 00:19:09.529, Speaker A: This is a deactivated opcode basically.
00:19:09.577 - 00:19:16.817, Speaker B: That's right. Opcat was originally created by Satoshi and Satoshi deactivated because he. I don't think he had time to really fully explore it.
00:19:16.881 - 00:19:37.555, Speaker A: Yeah, there was worries. I think the story is that like because you can concatenate, you can think about like a stack overflow type of error where like concatenates forever. But as Reindell I think explained on this show, like it's completely solvable. Like it's literally like you can just put in a thing that says like you can't concatenate more than X amount and then you're good. But like. Yeah, I think it was. And he wanted to focus on other things.
00:19:37.555 - 00:19:52.699, Speaker A: And it was like, it's actually such a powerful opcode. It's such a generalized, simple opcode. So many different things can be built on. I think that would be my guess as to why he deactivated. It was like, I don't know where this would take bitcoin. So why don't we focus on, you.
00:19:52.707 - 00:19:56.175, Speaker B: Know, people forget that Satoshi isn't a God.
00:19:56.215 - 00:19:56.511, Speaker A: Right.
00:19:56.583 - 00:20:09.183, Speaker B: Like he, he did a lot of things right. And I think it's incredible. And I've written, of course I wrote up plenty of bitcoin series on bitcoin's origin story. So there's no one more. I mean there's a few, few other people more than myself are more enamored by Satoshi as well.
00:20:09.239 - 00:20:09.455, Speaker A: Right.
00:20:09.495 - 00:20:15.575, Speaker B: What he did, his invention, how he accomplished it. But you know, of course some things weren't perfect. Right. Like.
00:20:15.615 - 00:20:15.887, Speaker A: Right.
00:20:15.951 - 00:20:18.695, Speaker B: How could he have guessed what issuance schedule would have been appropriate?
00:20:18.815 - 00:20:23.937, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean it's a total guess. Right. It's, it's, it was just elegant math. As far as we can tell.
00:20:23.961 - 00:20:25.081, Speaker B: There's like, why four years?
00:20:25.153 - 00:20:27.937, Speaker A: Yeah, it's not clear. It's pretty arbitrary.
00:20:28.041 - 00:20:32.385, Speaker B: I think that was completely arbitrary. And he never even talked. He never talks about why.
00:20:32.505 - 00:20:41.049, Speaker A: I don't think he does ever. I've, I've looked at every, at some point or another. I've read every single thing that he's definitely written that we know is either from his Bitcoin Talk account or whatever.
00:20:41.097 - 00:20:43.713, Speaker B: I feel like we'd have to ask Pete Rizzo, the ultimate bitcoin historian.
00:20:43.769 - 00:20:44.137, Speaker A: We should.
00:20:44.201 - 00:20:47.409, Speaker B: He has really kind of owned that narrative really well as like he's done.
00:20:47.417 - 00:20:48.529, Speaker A: A good job with that, hasn't he, Pete?
00:20:48.577 - 00:20:48.849, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:48.897 - 00:20:49.633, Speaker A: That's a good follow up too.
00:20:49.649 - 00:20:50.969, Speaker B: I love Pete. He's. He's a great guy.
00:20:51.017 - 00:21:05.469, Speaker A: Yeah. He's obviously he's been a writer. He was an editor at CoinDesk and for years now he's the editor of Bitcoin magazine. Yeah. Anyway, so on opcat. So that's the other thing. Reindell and the team are also working on other bitcoin technologies.
00:21:05.469 - 00:21:29.087, Speaker A: Right. It's not clear. I don't think you guys have publicly announced exactly what, other than, you know, the NFT collections that you've released. Hasn't. But certainly advocating for opcat, Right. Is something that They've done, the team has done, and it really has picked up a lot. I mean, now the sort of true bitcoin development, core development, intelligentsia is talking a fairly large amount about opcat.
00:21:29.087 - 00:21:32.263, Speaker A: Right. And doing a lot of, like, hardcore technological research.
00:21:32.359 - 00:21:36.871, Speaker B: It was. It was very underexplored, I think, until we moved it into existence.
00:21:36.943 - 00:21:37.543, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:21:37.679 - 00:21:50.243, Speaker B: And that's where, when Udi and Eric first came together with the strategy behind this, I thought they were a little crazy. I'm like, we're going to use memes and NFTs to promote Bitcoin development culture. I'm like, I'm. You know, that's pretty wild.
00:21:50.299 - 00:21:53.387, Speaker A: I'm open to the concept, but it's right on its face. It sounds weird.
00:21:53.451 - 00:22:02.523, Speaker B: Yeah, it sounds weird, but it worked out brilliantly, I think. You know, when you create, like, really memetic type narratives that are just so easy for people to crack and talk about.
00:22:02.579 - 00:22:03.339, Speaker A: It's a cat.
00:22:03.427 - 00:22:08.059, Speaker B: It's a cat. It's kind of cute, weird looking. We also have, you know, there's a children's book.
00:22:08.147 - 00:22:09.979, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I know. It was good. It's good.
00:22:10.027 - 00:22:15.803, Speaker B: You know, so we've done some things that are pretty funny in that regard also. Oh, did you check out the. You went to bitcoin Nashville, right?
00:22:15.819 - 00:22:16.555, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:22:16.715 - 00:22:17.659, Speaker B: Did you see the hat?
00:22:17.747 - 00:22:26.107, Speaker A: I did, yeah. Massive wizard hat, basically directly next to the bitcoin magazine, like, news desk that.
00:22:26.131 - 00:22:41.089, Speaker B: And we wanted to put it really close to the bitcoin puritans art, because for those who don't know, the bitcoin puritans hate the idea of selling digital art. They consider that a scam. They like to sell physical art, which is pure.
00:22:41.177 - 00:22:41.953, Speaker A: And that's fine.
00:22:42.049 - 00:22:47.313, Speaker B: And that's fine. That's cool. I like physical art too, but we wanted to remind them of tapper wizards.
00:22:47.369 - 00:22:47.633, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:47.689 - 00:22:50.769, Speaker B: And so it also ended up being like one of the largest objects in the room.
00:22:50.857 - 00:22:55.985, Speaker A: It was massive. And it was mentioned in basically every mainstream media story about the conference and.
00:22:56.105 - 00:22:57.105, Speaker B: Trump posted on Instagram.
00:22:57.145 - 00:23:08.541, Speaker A: Yeah, I was gonna say the photos were posted. Yeah, it was quite funny. Oh, well, all right. Before we can talk more about the wizards, I can't wait to see what else they do. It is very fun. I would say it's fun. I mean, it's just fun.
00:23:08.541 - 00:23:25.157, Speaker A: And we're making bitcoin magical again. And that's the thing that is so you are. And I think that's what is. So what's one of the most redeeming things about it? If you're, like, critical of The Taproot wizards, or you hate selling. NFTs is also a very, very strong tech team. Right. I mean, Dell is like cash app, like Ryan real.
00:23:25.157 - 00:23:26.661, Speaker A: These are real people.
00:23:26.773 - 00:23:32.189, Speaker B: I mean, UD's bald. The team is exceptional. Tyler Whittle.
00:23:32.277 - 00:23:32.763, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:32.869 - 00:23:39.071, Speaker B: You know, like everyone I've worked at work with there and the team's been growing quite a bit. Yeah, everyone's really sharp.
00:23:39.183 - 00:23:48.535, Speaker A: It's cool to see and it's part of this whole, you know, since ordinals, this whole renaissance. Maybe this is what we should talk about.
00:23:48.615 - 00:23:49.671, Speaker B: Season 2 Renaissance.
00:23:49.743 - 00:23:54.663, Speaker A: Yeah. Because you now I introduced you as the GP of the asymmetric Bitcoin Defi venture fund.
00:23:54.719 - 00:23:55.271, Speaker B: That's right. That's right.
00:23:55.303 - 00:24:03.289, Speaker A: That's not something that I've. That's not a title that I've used for you before. What are you doing? What is this new venture fund?
00:24:03.377 - 00:24:15.481, Speaker B: You know, being in the space almost 12 years now, I've held a lot of different titles, but I've never been on the VC side. I've always been an operator. And for folks who don't know what that means, an operator means someone who goes and builds something. So building working at a startup or.
00:24:15.513 - 00:24:26.623, Speaker A: Working at a company, you've had your own, you've been an entrepreneur, you've been acquired twice. Twice. You've worked at big companies and small companies. Right. You've worked as an advisor to companies.
00:24:26.719 - 00:24:30.759, Speaker B: I failed to. You know, bitcoin and crypto is a harsh mistress.
00:24:30.807 - 00:24:31.279, Speaker A: It's.
00:24:31.407 - 00:24:36.103, Speaker B: It's a lot. And some of those were kind of by the skin of my teeth sort of maneuver.
00:24:36.119 - 00:24:42.327, Speaker A: You know, I still reference your usage of the OTC lending desks and how you would put corn on all of them and then publish that information.
00:24:42.391 - 00:24:43.023, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, yeah.
00:24:43.079 - 00:24:48.927, Speaker A: I still talk about this because there still is major opacity and there always has been among the OTC lending market.
00:24:48.991 - 00:24:52.359, Speaker B: Can we talk about what you're doing?
00:24:52.447 - 00:24:58.329, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. We're so along the same lines. We are writing a report about this because there is still this opacity.
00:24:58.417 - 00:25:00.561, Speaker B: This was the dream I had, is that someone would write it up.
00:25:00.633 - 00:25:01.433, Speaker A: Yeah, I know.
00:25:01.569 - 00:25:02.737, Speaker B: And it's hard for myself.
00:25:02.801 - 00:25:29.421, Speaker A: One of the things that was so interesting about what Dan would do is you would put your own, your own Bitcoin and say like, you know, you'd do what I think we call like an earn product. Right. You'd get, you'd lend them and see and then you'd publish what the rates are. Right. That you're getting back from all the. None of those Companies including us, like publicly say what the current lending rate is for Bitcoin. And what's interesting now we can go in Defi pretty easily and see like what, what the rates are on AAVE or on whatever for rap bitcoin and stuff.
00:25:29.421 - 00:25:43.565, Speaker A: But again like. And there's a large amount of bitcoin lending happening in Defi but there's a large amount happening over the counter. Probably still the largest amount and definitely before with like Genesis and Voyager and Blockfi and all those companies. Right.
00:25:43.605 - 00:25:46.677, Speaker B: What's interesting too is with the spreadsheet I would put my own coins there.
00:25:46.741 - 00:25:47.077, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:47.141 - 00:26:02.903, Speaker B: I felt that was the only ethical way to do it. You know what's funny is I didn't lose money on any of the ones that were consumer facing. I never put any money in Celsius. That was obviously a scam like from day one. BlockFi pulled my money out a year and a half before when they accidentally sent that person $10 million.
00:26:02.959 - 00:26:03.263, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:03.319 - 00:26:09.199, Speaker B: I was like, this sounds shady. And I tweeted that out. So I actually got caught at Genesis.
00:26:09.287 - 00:26:09.927, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:10.071 - 00:26:13.687, Speaker B: And I thought that was going to be the last one. They were, they were the, they were the legends.
00:26:13.751 - 00:26:35.363, Speaker A: I mean they were legends. There was a quarter where they had a loan book of $14.7 billion. Now granted, that's what they said. That's that. I mean when we publish this report that should be in the next month or so, we're going to show that. And the fall off primarily from them going bankrupt is absolutely insane.
00:26:35.459 - 00:26:37.495, Speaker B: Well, they were, I mean they were so huge.
00:26:37.795 - 00:26:38.315, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:38.395 - 00:26:42.035, Speaker B: And I mean what happened there was, I would say like criminal negligence.
00:26:42.115 - 00:26:42.587, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:42.691 - 00:27:00.389, Speaker B: Like I think everyone who was involved with that over on the Genesis side reflects incredibly poorly on their character and their execution. We're talking egregious breaches of trust. Things that they're being sued for. I don't understand how someone could ethically be involved with that and still be there.
00:27:00.477 - 00:27:00.773, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:00.829 - 00:27:04.709, Speaker B: So I. Shame on whoever worked there is pretty fucking bad.
00:27:04.797 - 00:27:12.645, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean that's a big black mark on the industry. They were behind basically all of the big blow ups actually. Yes. They were the same capital. Yeah.
00:27:12.725 - 00:27:14.757, Speaker B: Yeah. As the counterparty that's failing.
00:27:14.821 - 00:27:15.423, Speaker A: Right.
00:27:15.589 - 00:27:19.179, Speaker B: And then, you know, the maneuvers in bankruptcy were really disgusting as well. Were they?
00:27:19.227 - 00:27:21.179, Speaker A: This I didn't follow very closely, but yeah, I don't know.
00:27:21.227 - 00:27:30.667, Speaker B: So I have recovered 55%. I didn't lose that much there, but yeah, but that's. But 55% recovery and another 20% will be recovering. That was in kind.
00:27:30.731 - 00:27:31.187, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:31.291 - 00:27:46.017, Speaker B: So it was return back in btc. So haircut wise, you know, it'll still sting a bit, but I, you know, I lent what I thought I was willing to lose and certainly felt that. So, yeah, yeah. I mean, the coins they said I had there were there when it collapsed.
00:27:46.081 - 00:28:03.257, Speaker A: So you're doing Venture now. You've teamed up with Asymmetric, which is a pretty big fun. I think they do Liquid as well. Right. That's Joe McCann and others there. Joe, I think maybe our audience. If you don't, if you just got to know him recently, it might be because he was one of the biggest Solana ecosystem investors.
00:28:03.257 - 00:28:08.273, Speaker A: And. Yeah, and specifically Bonk. Right. He loved Bonk. I don't know if he still does, but let me tell you.
00:28:08.289 - 00:28:35.741, Speaker B: Yeah, let me give you the backstory. So Joe, Joe and I met a few years ago through a buddy of ours, Jeff Renault, with Invisible North. And so Joe was immediately someone who, you know, I. Being as early as I was in bitcoin, I like to be contrarian. I don't mind being on the wrong side of something for a very long time. You know, for bitcoin to be popular and cool and being shilled by BlackRock, et cetera, which we'll touch on later. For me, that's.
00:28:35.741 - 00:29:03.875, Speaker B: That's incredible to see. But in the beginning, people thought you were a money launderer, drug dealer. I mean, I go on dates and they're like, what do you do? And I'm like, I work in the bitcoin space. And they're like, so do you sell drugs? Can I buy some molly off you? No. You know, so Joe is that exact same sort of character where he doesn't care about being on the wrong side. You know, he sees things. And like, for example, like, he was very early on Solana where the consensus narrative was like, oh, Solana's dead.
00:29:03.875 - 00:29:33.953, Speaker B: Joe's piling in. So Joe, both on Solana and Bitcoin Defi, he's an early buyer of stacks as well. He's willing to be contrarian, which actually very few venture capitalists are. They normally just crowd chasing FOMO into what everyone else is doing. And so that was a really natural fit for my fund, Bitcoin Defi Venture Fund. I actually shopped it to several different crypto VCs. And with Joey was the best fit there due to our personalities just being very aligned with being contrarian.
00:29:33.953 - 00:30:04.055, Speaker B: And he was the only crypto VC I pitched who was into Bitcoin Defi. And this was like the fall of 2023, we eventually papered things up in about January, February. And so since February, we've come storming out of the gates, raised quite a bit of money and already made six investments, which, as you know, in venture world, that's not how things happen. Normally you raise money for a year, year and a half, and you deploy over three years. Bitcoin defi. I think that narrative is very hot now. It's something that I've been looking at for a long time.
00:30:04.055 - 00:30:37.261, Speaker B: And the fund was the right time, I think, to formalize what I've been doing already, which is cutting angel checks into the space. Formalize that. And so timing wise, we could have been more perfect. I mean, we've gotten in right at the right time, right valuations. It's been fun being a venture capitalist. It's a different thing for me to do. It's a lot, you know, it's a lot of now looking at the mirror of who I used to be as a startup founder and looking at founders and seeing do they have the grit, intensity and intelligence to go execute.
00:30:37.261 - 00:31:07.373, Speaker B: We invest in early stage, so you often don't have much to go by. Like traction wise, like they don't have five years worth of execution with this product. They might just be starting. So really finding out if that founder's got it, what it takes, are they solving a problem that we think of the market as a unique fit. And so you had to name off a couple Bob Meso, Bitlayer. Those are Bitcoin L2s. Those all raised rounds, 3x the rounds that we got in just a few months later because of how hot the sector was.
00:31:07.373 - 00:31:11.869, Speaker B: Fractal. That's one that a lot of people passed up on. Have you heard of fractal?
00:31:11.917 - 00:31:12.257, Speaker A: No.
00:31:12.341 - 00:31:13.977, Speaker B: It's a meta protocol by Unisat.
00:31:14.081 - 00:31:14.881, Speaker A: Oh, interesting.
00:31:14.953 - 00:31:28.401, Speaker B: Yeah. So the Unisat team is building this. Bob Bodley does really good content in the space. Do you ever read his stuff? He's got a good write up on exactly what it is. But Fractal is a meta protocol. We think that space is very underexplored. Bitcoin L2s, of course, are hot.
00:31:28.401 - 00:31:31.325, Speaker B: Quite a few of them out there. I forget the latest count.
00:31:31.705 - 00:31:49.121, Speaker A: I mean, we had said it. Is that the latest count? I'm not sure. We've done plenty of research on this and I don't know, we pegged it at like 65 a few months ago, but I've. Mike Dudas claimed that he's seen pitch decks for over 150, so I don't know if that's true. But in any case, it's a lot.
00:31:49.193 - 00:31:56.537, Speaker B: It's a lot, yeah. L2 wise, you know, I think, I don't think there's going to be a winner take all. There's going to be a spectrum of outcomes. Look at Ethereum L2 landscape.
00:31:56.601 - 00:31:57.205, Speaker A: Right.
00:31:57.945 - 00:32:35.029, Speaker B: I do think we're going to see a Bitcoin L2 at $100 billion valuation, though. Like if Bitcoin's trading at a 4 trillion market cap, $100 billion L2 is actually quite small if you think about it. So I think we're going to see a lot of activity there as, especially as transaction fees on L1 rises, that pushes activity L2s. And if L2s get OPCAT, that would be hugely beneficial. We're equally bullish on meta protocols. So meta protocols, for those who don't know, are not a layer, it's not an L1, it's not an L2. It's like you and I are wearing augmented reality glasses, looking at the Bitcoin blockchain and sharing the same software.
00:32:35.029 - 00:32:37.293, Speaker B: That software that we run would be like the meta protocol software.
00:32:37.349 - 00:32:38.685, Speaker A: So ordinals are a meta protocol.
00:32:38.725 - 00:32:47.469, Speaker B: They're a meta protocol, right? Yeah. And ordinals, you know, you've got ordering theory, that's where ordinals comes from. Because you and I collectively hallucinate and agree that these satoshis are ordered in a certain fashion.
00:32:47.517 - 00:32:51.421, Speaker A: As long as we run that software that looks at it that way, then we can do stuff with that.
00:32:51.493 - 00:33:00.893, Speaker B: Exactly. And then you've got protocol standards, BRC 20, atomicals, runes. I think there's going to be far more exploration there. And that's what fractal is.
00:33:00.949 - 00:33:01.701, Speaker A: Very interesting.
00:33:01.813 - 00:33:06.345, Speaker B: Yeah. Because you know what's cool is any UTXO in Bitcoin can interact with a meta protocol.
00:33:06.885 - 00:33:23.373, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, this is what Ryan Dell is always explaining to me about ordinals and Casey also, that it's important to Casey. One of the main things was that like, because These are just UTXOs, they're not fundamentally changing, that they can make use of literally every software, every transaction type, every wallet. Right?
00:33:23.509 - 00:33:30.205, Speaker B: Yeah. Because you and I are sharing the same collective hallucination or software protocol. You know, the Bitcoin protocol didn't change.
00:33:30.285 - 00:33:30.669, Speaker A: Right.
00:33:30.757 - 00:33:34.621, Speaker B: We, we just interpreted it, interpreted movements on the Bitcoin protocol in our own way.
00:33:34.693 - 00:33:48.357, Speaker A: Right. One of the biggest wallets, the most popular wallets that like real ordinals, you know, aggressive power users like to use, is Sparrow because it has really great like UTXO selection and labeling and stuff. Absolutely not made for ordinals.
00:33:48.421 - 00:33:50.509, Speaker B: No, I mean, X first unisat.
00:33:50.597 - 00:33:55.505, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, those are made for it. Yeah. But one of the. Yeah, and Sparrow is a power, like user type of software.
00:33:55.565 - 00:33:55.977, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:33:56.081 - 00:34:06.977, Speaker A: But like again, like just the same thing. Like it's just a really good bitcoin wallet. It's not like four ordinals. Yeah, obviously. Yes. The X first team unisat you mentioned. Like there's others, I think.
00:34:06.977 - 00:34:09.977, Speaker A: What hero or something. I forget. All these heroes now.
00:34:10.001 - 00:34:10.393, Speaker B: Leather.
00:34:10.489 - 00:34:16.121, Speaker A: Got it. So like there are ones that are built that actually are more usable for normal people that know the meta protocol.
00:34:16.193 - 00:34:17.265, Speaker B: Sparrow is a little advanced, I think.
00:34:17.305 - 00:34:20.569, Speaker A: Yeah. But in any case, point being is. Yeah, it's just bitcoin.
00:34:20.657 - 00:34:33.241, Speaker B: Yeah. Any wallet, like you could use a Sparrow wallet. Not optimized for that to go interact with an E. Exactly. Yeah. So we, we think that's vastly underexplored now as transaction fees rise. You know, anything that you move on the bitcoin base layer is going to be expensive.
00:34:33.313 - 00:34:34.009, Speaker A: Fair point. Yeah.
00:34:34.057 - 00:34:34.881, Speaker B: So we think there's a.
00:34:34.953 - 00:34:37.385, Speaker A: Including ordinals or other meta protocol stuff. Yeah, yeah.
00:34:37.425 - 00:35:09.129, Speaker B: And this will equilibrate over time. You know, bitcoin transact action fees will hit a certain level and that will. Some economic activity on Bitcoin L1 with meta protocols will cease because it's not profitable or worthwhile, whereas that'll be pushed up to like an L2. People could maybe wrap those assets and bring them to the Bitcoin L2. There's all sorts of ways you can do it. But yeah, we see a world where both flourish and metaprotocols are something very distinctly new and different. Those don't exist on Ethereum and they have existed before.
00:35:09.129 - 00:35:12.417, Speaker B: We had. What was it called? Counterparty.
00:35:12.481 - 00:35:13.017, Speaker A: Yeah, counterparty.
00:35:13.041 - 00:35:29.027, Speaker B: It's technically a meta protocol. So yeah, some of these have existed before, but I think it's a pretty new narrative. It's going to be a hot narrative this cycle. Same with the Bitcoin L2s, but that's a given. Everyone's already talking about that. For me, I like the unexplored paths. Very interesting, but cool.
00:35:29.027 - 00:35:31.547, Speaker B: We're building all this infrastructure up at the dapps. Right.
00:35:31.611 - 00:35:32.003, Speaker A: Great.
00:35:32.099 - 00:35:37.091, Speaker B: I've seen the hand wringing over in the Ethereum landscape complaining about that.
00:35:37.123 - 00:35:44.107, Speaker A: In fact, I just last week released a podcast episode where I just ranted the entire time about infra.
00:35:44.211 - 00:35:44.819, Speaker B: It's much infra.
00:35:44.867 - 00:36:12.045, Speaker A: One of the main things I was like, where are the applications? In fact, all the big application categories from 2021 NFTs, Metaverse, DeFi Gaming. Other than Defi, which is strong, it's almost a commoditized utility. It's important, but it's not really growing or like innovation has mostly stalled right now in the broader Ethereum sort of world. The other ones are practically dead. So anyway, yes, I am also one of these people who is calling, I'm yet again asking for your application developments.
00:36:12.085 - 00:36:19.077, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, we do. We did back two DAP founders. Liquidium, which allows you to borrow Bitcoin using your ordinal as collateral.
00:36:19.181 - 00:36:19.789, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:36:19.877 - 00:36:31.385, Speaker B: It's really simple how it works. So it uses discrete log contracts and NFTs are a liquid. You know, we know that NFTs are not the market for that. Like there's not really a bid.
00:36:31.885 - 00:36:32.341, Speaker A: Right.
00:36:32.413 - 00:36:38.925, Speaker B: It's. It's more of like you sell below the floor and someone might buy it. You know, the markets are rather. And then you look at the daily volume, it's pretty small.
00:36:38.965 - 00:36:42.029, Speaker A: Makes it not great for like liquid collateral.
00:36:42.197 - 00:36:42.549, Speaker B: Right.
00:36:42.597 - 00:36:43.325, Speaker A: Loan collateral.
00:36:43.405 - 00:37:09.169, Speaker B: Which is, which is interesting because what they basically created, Liquidium created is a like, it's like you're selling a put. So for the lender, it's like selling a put. So basically the ordinal. So we got an NFT ordinal and someone. The. You basically sign it into a discrete law contract. You, you all sign and then Oracle data's piped in, which is the pricing of that nft.
00:37:09.169 - 00:37:17.257, Speaker B: If it go, if it goes below a certain value, it doesn't try to sell the nft, it just reassigns ownership to the lender, which is very elegant.
00:37:17.281 - 00:37:18.169, Speaker A: It kind of seizes it.
00:37:18.217 - 00:37:18.921, Speaker B: Yeah, they seize it.
00:37:18.953 - 00:37:19.457, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:19.601 - 00:37:26.017, Speaker B: Which is really elegant and simple because you don't need to have like, you don't need like any sort of liquidity or any sort of ordinance where the.
00:37:26.041 - 00:37:27.529, Speaker A: Lender can decide what to do with it.
00:37:27.577 - 00:37:27.969, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:37:28.017 - 00:37:28.265, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:28.305 - 00:37:30.857, Speaker B: Yeah. And I mean the interest rates are crazy, right?
00:37:30.881 - 00:37:34.777, Speaker A: I mean it makes sense. Yeah, but there's a market. I mean it makes sense. There's always a market for something.
00:37:34.881 - 00:37:41.995, Speaker B: Yeah. So we thought that was really interesting. Lending, as we've seen in the Defi world on Ethereum, is huge.
00:37:42.075 - 00:37:42.563, Speaker A: Yep.
00:37:42.659 - 00:38:16.441, Speaker B: So, and we like Robin and the team, so Liquidium is one that we invest in and Sat Flow, now I can't talk about Sat Flow's future plans, but they've sort of, they've got some, a pretty, pretty cool roadmap for what they're doing. SAT Flow currently is a tool that allows you to snipe transactions in the mempool that's ultimately the final order book for clearing. Right. Is like the MEM pool is all the pending transactions and you can snipe those partially signed bitcoin transactions and replace it with your own.
00:38:16.513 - 00:38:17.169, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:38:17.297 - 00:38:27.241, Speaker B: So that's really cool to see what sad flow has done there. I think if you start from a first principles perspective of like that's the real. That's where the action happens and build from there.
00:38:27.273 - 00:38:28.641, Speaker A: It's like MEV basically.
00:38:28.713 - 00:38:34.487, Speaker B: Yeah, it's one of the first mev. Like it's one of the first like MEV visualization tools because like non engineers could use the tool.
00:38:34.551 - 00:38:41.095, Speaker A: That's cool. This is one of the things that critics of ordinals have raised is that it starts to introduce me to Bitcoin.
00:38:41.135 - 00:38:42.711, Speaker B: But yes, the dreaded MEV word.
00:38:42.783 - 00:38:51.967, Speaker A: Yes. Yeah, yes. The. It's funny that we even call it MEV because neither bitcoin nor ETH is it actually miners doing the value extraction at this point.
00:38:51.991 - 00:38:54.855, Speaker B: But right now. Yeah, it's maximum extractable value.
00:38:54.895 - 00:38:55.775, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:38:55.935 - 00:38:56.871, Speaker B: Versus yeah.
00:38:56.983 - 00:39:10.009, Speaker A: Do you think that would lead to like private. More private MEM pools? You know you got was Marathon has their private thing. I forgot what it's called like a out of band transaction protocol type stuff because that's effectively what's happened on Ethereum.
00:39:10.057 - 00:39:11.237, Speaker B: The 4mega Wizard.
00:39:11.349 - 00:39:12.354, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:39:12.465 - 00:39:13.470, Speaker B: Right. Yeah.
00:39:13.582 - 00:39:27.673, Speaker A: Ripping the 4mega as they like to say. All those guys, Charlie Spear, all the ordinals guys. Nick Hansen at Luxor who. Right. They mind that. Yeah. Is that A, will that happen? B, if it does, is that bad.
00:39:27.849 - 00:39:54.923, Speaker B: Game theoretically is going to, you know, ultimately like I think that these markets equilibrate though. Right. Like yeah, you could try to do an out of band transaction but how much will that save you? It might be more of you might, you know, you might do it for this I think introduces some really interesting like futures sort of markets which would be cool game. Theoretically it's going to happen. We can't stop what happens outside of the bitcoin protocol.
00:39:55.029 - 00:39:55.407, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:39:55.471 - 00:40:06.655, Speaker B: You know, so if the game theory needs to be adjusted because there's some sort of catastrophic game theoretic error, then this would be an issue. But I don't think there is one. You know out of ban payments are.
00:40:06.815 - 00:40:15.719, Speaker A: Going to happen regardless and they do happen already. Right. I mean you've already been. Any time you boost a transaction with a mining pool. I don't know. I say this like everyone's doing it. Not many people are doing It.
00:40:15.719 - 00:40:33.523, Speaker A: But even Mempool space offers this. Right. Like there's a thing that can happen. All right, so then, then in the Defi. Let's talk more about the L2s and the DeFi. So there's a bunch of different. I would say what I've mostly seen is basically of the net of the new like this new L2 Renaissance or flood.
00:40:33.523 - 00:40:41.867, Speaker A: Right. I mean it's, it's mostly roll ups. Right. And I think this is a. It's kind of nice actually. You let the Ethereum people like do all this work for years to figure out what the.
00:40:41.971 - 00:40:48.259, Speaker B: That was. The original narrative with Bitcoin maximalism was that let's let the other alts do the experimental stuff and if it works we'll bring it back to Bitcoin.
00:40:48.307 - 00:41:13.883, Speaker A: Right. And that's what we're doing. That is what this is. Right. No roll ups after literally, I guess it's been nine years since Ethereum launched, but I would say it's bit like five or six years of hardcore Ethereum L2 iteration. Now it's pretty clear that the optimistic roll up is absolutely a powerful one. And people think maybe technologically the ZK rollup is even better.
00:41:13.883 - 00:41:27.625, Speaker A: But frankly arbitrum and optimism and base, which are all optimistic rollups on ethics dominate currently. Right. But they need the trustless bridge I think is pretty much the primary thing.
00:41:28.165 - 00:41:49.535, Speaker B: Yeah. And then you look under the hood. You know, I spent the last three years exploring the bitcoin, not Bitcoin, the Ethereum and Solana Defi Worlds, Solana Breakpoint Eth, Denver, nft, nyc and because I wanted to see what was going on there and maybe we could bring some of that back to Bitcoin or at least we could learn from it, you know, under the hood. And a lot of this stuff is basically like oh, it's a multisig.
00:41:49.615 - 00:41:50.119, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:50.247 - 00:41:53.407, Speaker B: I mean with every single Bitcoin L2 that's currently the case.
00:41:53.471 - 00:41:53.807, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:53.871 - 00:42:20.539, Speaker B: Which we are okay with from an investment perspective. The market has decided that they are that multisig or federated or threshold models are legitimate and people are willing to put their assets on that chain. Polygon, the first Bitcoin, the first Ethereum L2 is a multi segment. We view it as a more go to market as really the key here, going to market, getting Dapps TVL users. And then of course when opcat comes out, eventually replacing that for a trust.
00:42:20.587 - 00:42:22.507, Speaker A: Further decentralizing it and whatnot.
00:42:22.611 - 00:42:39.269, Speaker B: Yeah. But I mean under bitvm, under a lot of these, there's A multisig or some sort of further game theory. So it's been exciting to watch what's going on over there. I haven't been super involved watching the latest and greatest. But yeah, it's been.
00:42:39.357 - 00:42:45.341, Speaker A: Well, there's. And it's moving quickly. I mean, honestly, like we talk with those teams. Right. We've. No, I think our audience knows this. We've.
00:42:45.341 - 00:42:48.877, Speaker A: We've invested in Citria. Right. Which is a bitcoin roll up.
00:42:48.901 - 00:42:49.229, Speaker B: Right.
00:42:49.317 - 00:42:58.493, Speaker A: Galaxy has. And I've had Orkin on this show before. Also had Botanix on the show. Right. Which is the spider chain. I actually think this is super.
00:42:58.549 - 00:42:59.117, Speaker B: Is that Willem?
00:42:59.181 - 00:43:07.877, Speaker A: Yeah, Willems. I had Willem on the show from Botanix. And like the spider chain is actually just a totally different design. That is not a roll up, which I. Which is pretty cool. It's one of the main things I like about it, just that it is different.
00:43:07.901 - 00:43:10.407, Speaker B: I'm not stake bitcoin on Bitcoin L1.
00:43:10.471 - 00:43:10.855, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:10.935 - 00:43:14.119, Speaker B: And then that represents staked bitcoin to protect the game. Theoretically. Protect.
00:43:14.167 - 00:43:21.935, Speaker A: Yeah. And it becomes like this overlapping web. It's almost like that together, sort of you can form a single state that then their EVM can.
00:43:22.015 - 00:43:23.735, Speaker B: And then there's more. The states can sync with each other.
00:43:23.775 - 00:43:24.095, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:43:24.135 - 00:43:24.431, Speaker C: Right.
00:43:24.503 - 00:43:28.879, Speaker B: It's pretty cool. I mean, that's where the spider concept comes from. Spider Web, I'm guessing is more where they came from.
00:43:28.927 - 00:43:29.399, Speaker A: That's right.
00:43:29.487 - 00:43:31.551, Speaker B: I like Spider Chain, by the way, versus Botanics.
00:43:31.663 - 00:43:31.887, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:31.911 - 00:43:33.407, Speaker B: No, I've told the team this.
00:43:33.471 - 00:43:40.939, Speaker A: I know they should just change the name to Spider Chain. But they're saying that Botanics Labs builds a spider chain. It's like trying to make fetch happen. You know, they're trying to.
00:43:41.027 - 00:43:46.259, Speaker B: Yeah. I was fucking with William a little bit and I'm like. Yeah, so it sounds like a botanic. Sounds like a gardening tool, like a gardening spray.
00:43:46.307 - 00:43:46.747, Speaker A: It does.
00:43:46.811 - 00:43:47.979, Speaker B: Did you spray with some botanics?
00:43:48.027 - 00:43:51.615, Speaker A: Yeah, it does. It's like botanist but it's got the X. So you know there's like chemicals in it.
00:43:52.835 - 00:43:56.131, Speaker B: Exactly. Kind of cool. I've never heard of a spider blockchain.
00:43:56.203 - 00:43:56.603, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:56.699 - 00:43:57.579, Speaker B: So once, yeah.
00:43:57.627 - 00:44:00.115, Speaker A: We were talking about DLCs. Right. You were talking about Liquidium.
00:44:00.155 - 00:44:00.891, Speaker B: Is that what it was called?
00:44:01.003 - 00:44:12.415, Speaker A: They used to be DLCs. You know, we had Tony Kai on the show once talking about atomic finance. Finance, yep. And DLCs are interesting. They don't require an L2. Right. You can do them today.
00:44:12.955 - 00:44:14.371, Speaker B: But it's on the bitcoin based layer.
00:44:14.443 - 00:44:38.853, Speaker A: Yeah. But it's certainly not like an EVM based stateful persistent application. The way you have Defi and like Ethereum, in fact, they're peer to peer. There's advantages to that, by the way. But is that like, are you thinking that in the call take five years or whatever are we going to have. Basically. And pretty much all the rollups are using the evm, which frankly makes sense for SVM or the SVM because you already have this.
00:44:38.853 - 00:44:55.877, Speaker A: A lot of programs or the Ethereum smart contract, copy, copy, paste, super easy. Right. And is that going to be a huge area here or do you think Bitcoin defi can get big with only things like DLC is before that is sort of a thing or like, you know, how do you think about. Is it. You're interested in both. Both of it, yeah.
00:44:55.901 - 00:45:39.099, Speaker B: I mean, you know, back to kind of our MetaProtocol versus L2 DLCs, you could lump in with meta, not. Not lump in with meta protocols, but have them in the same category. If it's all helping out no one. Basically the, you know, how will settlement occur or you know, what sort of. Is it the Bitcoin base layer or Bitcoin L2 that post state back to Bitcoin or some sort of, you know, how does your transaction get settled basically? And that's usually a function of how expensive it'll be in the trust assumptions. So that's where I keep going back to this word equilibrate, because I think it will. The market will just equalize between people who want to do high value transfers, want a clearance on L1, L2s with weaker game theoretic assumptions.
00:45:39.099 - 00:46:00.377, Speaker B: People put less value there, I think. And if we do get trustless bridging, then we'll see a blossoming of activity happen on Bitcoin L2s. But Bitcoin meta protocols will still be successful even if trustless bridging occurs because you can interact with it on the base layer and you have that settlement guarantee on the base layer. There's some nuances here of course too, with like indexing and stuff like that.
00:46:00.441 - 00:46:01.033, Speaker A: Totally.
00:46:01.169 - 00:46:41.555, Speaker B: But you know, we think I mentioned the $100 billion valuation for one of these L2s. I think that's conservative and here's why. Like that sounds crazy, but when you look at L2s over on Ethereum, people use them because they're faster and cheaper. They're not more expressive though. You can already do everything you can do on ethereum on the L1. You're using the L2 because it's cheaper and Faster Bitcoin doesn't allow a lot of activity on the L1 in terms of expressibility like AMMs, other smart contracts, et cetera. These L2s have a very strong compelling reason for you to bridge your asset to that L2 and it's because you can do all these fun things with it.
00:46:41.555 - 00:46:55.557, Speaker B: It's this playground of defi activity that you can do. I think that's very compelling for people now to, you know, speak on my like as a devil's advocate for my own statement, you know, why haven't we seen that on liquid or rootstock?
00:46:55.701 - 00:46:55.957, Speaker A: Right.
00:46:55.981 - 00:47:02.253, Speaker B: I think a lot of people have asked that. Liquid and rootstock for those who don't know, have been around for five, six years now.
00:47:02.309 - 00:47:02.945, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:47:03.485 - 00:47:23.795, Speaker B: I think both had terrible go to markets like absolutely awful marketing. Rootstock is relatively unknown. I don't know what they did with all that money. Literally never hear of them. They never attracted any dapps. If there's no dapps to use, then why would people bridge their bitcoin over there? The bridging was atrocious. Terrible tooling.
00:47:23.795 - 00:47:40.781, Speaker B: Liquid, same thing. Just never had any dapps that were developed. I think that the builders who are coming in now understand that go to market is your key differentiator here. Because as you know, the design game, theoretic design architecture here is almost all the same. Some are exploring things like BitVM and everything else, but it's all theoretical.
00:47:40.853 - 00:47:41.293, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:47:41.389 - 00:47:57.213, Speaker B: So until then it'll be federated or multi sick models. But yeah, I think, I think that's the majority of the reason why we haven't seen much activity happen on rootstock and liquid. But I think these new, the new wave of builders are definitely laser focused on it and go to market.
00:47:57.269 - 00:48:46.367, Speaker A: I think your point about the feature delta between a Bitcoin L2 that has a virtual machine versus the Bitcoin L1 and that that being a much greater delta feature wise than the ETHEL1 to the ETHEL two, which I think is totally right. And it leads me to this question and maybe you've partially answered it, but I've wondered from where does the demand to use these dapps come? Does it come primarily from bitcoiners who. Because there wasn't a bitcoin ecosystem way to do this stuff. But then there is, let's say they wait for the trussell's bridge or maybe they're fine with the multisig but now that It's a Bitcoin L2 now they're interested maybe in borrowing stables off their bitcoin for example, or are these Bitcoin L2s now competing for Ethereum users? Wait a second, that's a good question.
00:48:46.511 - 00:48:48.335, Speaker B: That's a really good question. What's the audience?
00:48:48.415 - 00:49:17.951, Speaker A: Yeah, because of course part of the backdrop for this is that you and I both know well that the people at bitcoin Nashville, I think even with decent moderation to the puritanism as you called it, having happened over the last couple years, still a very like hard money, sound money focused crowd, not super interested in tokens. Right. That's perhaps even euphemism. At least a large portion of the bitcoin world. Right. Is going to say this is, these are platforms for shitcoins is what they're going to say.
00:49:18.023 - 00:49:18.511, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:18.623 - 00:49:24.367, Speaker A: What do you think that is like existing bitcoiners versus stealing the bitcoiners back from Ethereum and the others?
00:49:24.471 - 00:49:33.585, Speaker B: Well, so if you look at some of the audience metrics, you know, only 13% of Bitcoin owners only hold Bitcoin. 87% hold another asset.
00:49:33.665 - 00:49:34.089, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:49:34.177 - 00:49:45.153, Speaker B: So there isn't this mythical bitcoin maxi massive group. It's quite small compared to other bitcoin owners. The other bitcoin owners own Ethereum and Solana and they've been doing degen stuff over there this whole time.
00:49:45.249 - 00:49:49.601, Speaker A: So it's like they went because they wanted to do that stuff and you couldn't do it on bitcoin so they just did it over there.
00:49:49.713 - 00:50:06.113, Speaker B: Yeah. Now, you know, I think some people will be like, well maybe they just use those for speculation in bitcoins where they save their money. That could happen too. But even as someone who's stored my wealth in bitcoin for over a decade, be nice to borrow dollars using my bitcoin as collateral in a trustless fashion.
00:50:06.209 - 00:50:08.761, Speaker A: In fact, you went around to all the desks and practiced that.
00:50:08.833 - 00:50:12.249, Speaker B: Right. In a centralized way, which sucks. And I got burned and.
00:50:12.377 - 00:50:12.665, Speaker A: Right.
00:50:12.705 - 00:50:30.697, Speaker B: But that's why defi is interesting. Now the caveat of you still have protocol risk for sure. People underrepresent quite a bit, but the no counterparty risk is really interesting. So I think that when we look at that as a single defi function, every bitcoiner would want to do that, right?
00:50:30.841 - 00:50:31.329, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:31.417 - 00:51:01.939, Speaker B: Why wouldn't you want to? I mean you look at if you hodl for 10 years, you either have to sell it, lend it or borrow against it. If you want to have any sort of liquidity event or utilize the capital for anything, we don't have a time preference of 0, we die. So I'VE hoddled for a long time and I haven't sold any of my bitcoin. But you know, eventually I'll want to buy something. And so yeah, I think like that is a basic primitive. What we call like financial primitive is like a different financial instruments or speculative games that primitive of borrowing dollars using your bitcoin as collateral.
00:51:02.027 - 00:51:03.459, Speaker A: That's a very straightforward use case.
00:51:03.507 - 00:51:23.621, Speaker B: Yeah. And I would say the entire, every bitcoin owner would be the audience for that. Right. And then you go down the risk spectrum of like oh do I want to like, you know, take my bitcoin and put it in a liquidity pool? These are far more, I consider riskier games with your bitcoin. But each person's risk is another person's opportunity. So I don't think it's a bad or good thing. It's the market.
00:51:23.621 - 00:51:43.105, Speaker B: Right. If people want to lend, borrow a stake. I think the staking side of this is very underappreciated too. We've got Babylon basically using staked bitcoin on other chains. None of us I think predicted that, but that could be a couple hundred billion dollar demand for bitcoin.
00:51:43.855 - 00:51:52.159, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean I think one of the most interesting things for something like Babylon is that it pays bitcoin denominated yield. And that's very hard to find. Right. In the scheme of things.
00:51:52.287 - 00:52:12.291, Speaker B: Well, and yeah, if you look at how it works it's quite interesting because these other chains, these other proof of stake chains having the gas token as the underlying collateral is quite risky because being secured by a pristine piece of collateral, Bitcoin, a store value gold bar, you know, instead of your own make believe money.
00:52:12.363 - 00:52:35.979, Speaker A: I mean there are questions, there are absolutely questions with restaking protocols on Ethereum that could they encumber the actual security collateral. I mean you're effectively rehypothecating the security collateral of the network itself. Right. And I've raised this question many times. We've studied this. You know, I'm told it's not specifically exactly like that. The risks aren't as scary sounding as I make it sound.
00:52:35.979 - 00:52:43.081, Speaker A: But, but there's none of that with bitcoin for this purpose. So that is interesting. It's different.
00:52:43.193 - 00:53:10.839, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it falls very nicely within the store value narrative. A pristine asset, a pristine piece of collateral that's used as a gold 2.0 esque asset. People want to borrow against it, people want to use it as collateral, people want to use it as proof of stake somewhere else. That's a magnificent use of digital gold. Yeah, I think it very much highlights why bitcoin is valuable and accrues more demand for Bitcoin. So these puritans should be cheering on a couple hundred billion more in demand.
00:53:10.839 - 00:53:28.061, Speaker B: Or you know, Bitcoin's not sold because people can borrow dollars against it. I mean this, this makes number go up and I think this has been their fault, like their problem. They have, they look at it as like this is a shitty casino that will detract from the Gold 2.0 narrative. I couldn't be more of a Gold 2.0 narrative guy. Right.
00:53:28.061 - 00:53:30.721, Speaker B: I've been championing that for basically since the beginning.
00:53:30.793 - 00:53:31.169, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:53:31.257 - 00:53:49.513, Speaker B: Anti payments and more digital gold. This is a future where yeah, you've got digital gold bricks where you can either like use it as collateral, you can borrow against it, you can stamp things into it like an NFT which is very costly to create an NFT on Bitcoin versus Ethereum or Solana. But maybe that's where like the fine art or the best types of products.
00:53:49.569 - 00:54:03.157, Speaker A: And this was our thesis like two months after ordinals launched was. And that's why I love the term inscribe because it does feel like bitcoin is more of a digital stone tablet. Right. It's that permanent, it has that level of fidelity.
00:54:03.341 - 00:54:34.465, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think these are all very complementary also. The Puritans I think had a very wrongly construed and one that actively ignores reality of what circular economies do in their make believe world. People are all paying each other for coffees and papuskas or whatever, which is not happening. To be clear, that is not happening. There is a handful of hobbyists doing a handful of payments. If you go contact these merchants and you ask them how many times do people pay for things in Bitcoin? It's like once a week.
00:54:34.465 - 00:55:14.335, Speaker B: So and the reason why is that using Bitcoin as a payment method does not solve a problem. It's not faster, cheaper or easier. And also why wouldn't I just use a stablecoin? Right. Because now I have volatility. What they were missing is that it was a circ. There was going to be a circular economy on Bitcoin but it wasn't going to be physical, it was going to be digital as in a digital economy of stables, other types of tokens, governance tokens which resemble kind of other types of traditional asset types like equity potentially. If you look at that we saw this emergent digital economy spawn on top of Ethereum and Solana and with ordinals we've seen A glimmer of it.
00:55:14.335 - 00:55:48.911, Speaker B: And the glimmer, I think that little glimmer even in the middle of a bear market is very, very bullish long term. I mean Bitcoin NFT trading volume surpassed Ethereum some days. That's after one year shitty wallet support in a bear market. So that digital circular economy on top of Bitcoin drives the store of value thesis. It also protects Bitcoin's long term gain theoretic security model through more transaction fees which are. We need more transaction fees to replace the subsidy over time. So for me I think they're kind of missing one of the biggest narratives ever in bitcoin.
00:55:49.103 - 00:56:18.155, Speaker A: It's definitely something happening that's like that famous song, right? Let's move on. This is super interesting. We could go on and on about the Bitcoin development L2 how it's going to be used. I think you have a very interesting and pretty bold thesis on this I wanted to ask you about. There's sort of another version of this narrative. I mean it's obviously related the institutions getting interested in bitcoin. You talked about BlackRock now championing the bitcoin narrative.
00:56:18.155 - 00:56:46.174, Speaker A: And they are, and it's the largest asset manager in the world. Obviously fidelity, like the third largest or whatever they are has been championing. I don't know why I can't say this word. They've been advocating for bitcoin. Is there a risk to that? I mean I was getting asked this so much around the bitcoin ETF launches by bitcoiners, by journalists, whomever, like wait a second, like friends of ours that are semi critics, like Joe Weisenthal is like trying to dunk on us for liking the fact that institutions are doing ETFs.
00:56:46.222 - 00:56:53.297, Speaker B: I always love to pull up a 2013, 2014 Joe Weisenthal to remind him of where he sits in the thought leadership category.
00:56:53.441 - 00:57:02.679, Speaker A: Do you think that that is. Is there some kind of risk to underlying bitcoin for all these institutions getting involved? Does it somehow like counteract the core thesis of bitcoin?
00:57:02.767 - 00:57:39.335, Speaker B: There's been a lot of angst around this where people are like, you know, we've sold out or bitcoin's been captured by the institutions. No, this is what winning looks like. I mean how is bitcoin going to be a global money if no banks ever touched it? I find that completely absurd. And so the most of the trolls I see are tradfi folks or like really shitty shitcoiners from like, you know, bitcoin cash where they're just kind of angsty and angry and they're like trying to throw barbs at bitcoin. Same with the privacy coin folks. It's like privacy coin folks be cash and like no coiners where they're all, they're like, oh, look, bitcoin's been captured. It's dead.
00:57:39.335 - 00:58:04.165, Speaker B: No, I mean we're seeing blackrock bend the knee where Larry fucking Fink is shilling bitcoin on cnbc. I mean, that's crazy. I waited a decade to see this happen. And it's incredible. The amount of demand he'll drive, the amount of trillions in retirement accounts that will go into bitcoin because of this is phenomenal. Bitcoin's code didn't change. There wasn't a blackrock line that was added.
00:58:04.165 - 00:58:23.157, Speaker B: There wasn't a blackrock influenced soft fork added. Bitcoin just stayed the same and they bent the knee. And so I think this is one of the greatest. This is what hyper bitcoinization looks like. It's insane to see it happen. I mean, I thought it was actually going to take longer to seem like it was never going to happen. So that's really cool to see.
00:58:23.157 - 00:58:36.531, Speaker B: I mean, we're seeing on the political side too, it becoming a topic of the election, the US election, presidential election. And I think it should be. At least we're fucking talking about us. Before we were just the weird kids.
00:58:36.603 - 00:59:02.725, Speaker A: Yeah, they didn't. We didn't matter at all. Even from Kamala Harris and Tim Waltz's campaign, although I've. Listeners to the show or readers of my content will know I've been very critical of the idea that somehow the Harris campaign has shown daylight between their position and Biden's position. I think it's basically identical to Biden's position. But they were even forced to make a public comment about it, which is actually a lot, to be honest. That was.
00:59:02.725 - 00:59:25.097, Speaker A: Yeah, they were. For now, he, Brian Nelson, this former treasury official who was made this comment and advised the Harris campaign. She called, he referred to us as that sort of industry, meaning like, yeah, we'll support innovation. It was direct question about crypto though. So, I mean they didn't even say crypto, bitcoin, blockchain, anything like that. But still they had to comment on it, which. And of course Trump on the other side gave a 49 minute speech about it.
00:59:25.097 - 00:59:28.085, Speaker A: So like we're. Yeah, we know he likes it, but yes.
00:59:28.165 - 01:00:02.917, Speaker B: And I think this election is really coming down to free markets versus communism. It's kind of Scary. Like the things that Kamala Harris is throwing out around taxing unrealized capital gains which by the way is not done anywhere else in the world other than fucking Norway or something. And they had a huge capital flight after that happened. This showdown for crypto overall, it's free markets versus communism. And then if you dig in deeper in crypto, this is I think a pretty important election for crypto as a whole. I believe the CFTC went after Uniswap.
01:00:02.917 - 01:00:04.685, Speaker B: Uniswap yesterday. Was that today or yesterday?
01:00:04.765 - 01:00:20.473, Speaker A: Yeah, that was this week. And that's actually kind of an interesting one as well, which is really about their front end. It's not really about the actual smart contracts. The deepest threat to crypto from governments is regulating unhosted wallets, self custody.
01:00:20.589 - 01:00:21.009, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:00:21.097 - 01:00:53.187, Speaker A: Or immutable code in the core. And it's really just the US Treasury Department that has been advocating for stuff like this. The market regulators and stuff like, they're all around like the, you know, are you a broker, are you doing tax stuff? It's not the word. I mean is it a security, is it a commodity? Yeah, that stuff's not great. And a lot of the, I think approaches have been bad. But the real core fights are it's Elizabeth Warren. It's the Digital Asset Anti Money Laundering act which seeks to regulate software developers and smart contract code and miners and validators as like bank secrecy act reporting companies.
01:00:53.187 - 01:00:54.875, Speaker A: Which is absurd and not possible.
01:00:54.955 - 01:00:55.835, Speaker B: Yeah, not possible.
01:00:55.915 - 01:01:07.435, Speaker A: I don't think, I don't think Harris is actually going to be meaningfully different on crypto than Biden. And let's face it, we had back to back bull runs for bitcoin under Biden's administration. Has it really been that? I mean, obviously it's been terrible.
01:01:07.475 - 01:01:09.123, Speaker B: Warren and Gensler have been pretty bad.
01:01:09.179 - 01:01:12.411, Speaker A: They have, but they haven't succeeded in killing us or anything.
01:01:12.603 - 01:01:15.085, Speaker B: I mean they're going after literally every single actor in the space.
01:01:15.195 - 01:01:17.321, Speaker A: It's fair. I mean, has been bad. To be clear. It's.
01:01:17.353 - 01:01:22.281, Speaker B: I mean they're literally persecuting every single. They just don't have the resource to persecute all of them. Otherwise they would.
01:01:22.353 - 01:01:26.897, Speaker A: Yeah. You know, he is always going back the chair of the SEC to ask for even more funding.
01:01:27.001 - 01:01:27.361, Speaker B: Right.
01:01:27.433 - 01:01:28.097, Speaker A: For enforcement.
01:01:28.161 - 01:01:49.031, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean this is the classic like late stage, you know, crony capitalism where capitalism, capitalism has been perverted by this massive bloated government where we have all of these three letter, three letter agencies that are dictating every part of our life over what we eat, drink, Buy, sell, read and news. You know, it's quite oppressive.
01:01:49.143 - 01:01:49.487, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:01:49.551 - 01:02:16.655, Speaker B: Like that level of oppression. People don't realize that that occurs until you go out and start a business and then you're like, wait a second, what, why is this regulation there? And some of them are well intentioned, but most of them are just completely, just bureaucratic and bs. I always like to go back to the faa. Okay, let's say the FAA doesn't exist. So people are going to voluntarily get onto airplanes they think will crash. No, they won't. Insurance companies won't underwrite the airplanes for them to fly if they're risky.
01:02:16.655 - 01:02:22.367, Speaker B: There is a check and balance of the market being like, I don't want to die. And so I don't want to fly.
01:02:22.391 - 01:02:23.439, Speaker A: It even rhymes.
01:02:23.607 - 01:02:26.279, Speaker B: I don't want to die, I don't want to fly. I'm not the rapper here.
01:02:26.327 - 01:02:42.801, Speaker A: No, you're right. Right. I mean, you're totally right. I mean it's like there was a great a meme I saw today of somebody who was driving from Chile into Argentina and it was like the road in Chile was privately built and it's in perfect condition. And as soon as they cross into Argentina, it's literally pothole central.
01:02:42.873 - 01:02:48.945, Speaker B: Yeah. There's. There's no incentive for government actors to act in a profit seeking or efficient manner, which the profit means efficiency.
01:02:48.985 - 01:02:51.377, Speaker A: In fact, it's. It's almost the opposite. Right.
01:02:51.561 - 01:02:52.289, Speaker B: As much as they can.
01:02:52.337 - 01:02:53.801, Speaker A: Correct. Because otherwise the budget will get cut.
01:02:53.833 - 01:02:54.025, Speaker B: Right.
01:02:54.065 - 01:03:08.347, Speaker A: So they, they take longer. I mean, there's this section of road. I don't want to say exactly where because I don't want to dox any two location but an American interstate that has been under construction for 25 years and it's not clear what they're doing. I've driven across it many times talking.
01:03:08.371 - 01:03:09.795, Speaker B: The Van Ness route in San Francisco.
01:03:09.835 - 01:03:11.859, Speaker A: I don't want to say. But yes, there's probably many of them.
01:03:11.907 - 01:03:16.019, Speaker B: Yeah. Van Ness. I used to live on Van Ness in San Francisco. I mean, Van Ness was the north south highway.
01:03:16.067 - 01:03:16.627, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:03:16.771 - 01:03:28.859, Speaker B: I think there was some bus lane project that took almost a decade. It was. I spent almost 10 years there and like from the time I lived there to the end, it was basically. Basically a nonstop construction project.
01:03:28.947 - 01:03:54.453, Speaker A: All right, before we wrap, this has been a great. By the way, thank you for coming back. One last thing. Volatility in bitcoin. Every time this happens, happened in August. There was a big global day of this collapse of the Japanese yen carry trade that disrupted all markets including bitcoin. Bitcoin dropped from like 60 plus to 49k briefly before recovering, basically, and now we're still chopping.
01:03:54.453 - 01:04:01.323, Speaker A: But all the old characters came out of the woodwork, like Paul Krugman. I think he was even out doing his thing on bitcoin.
01:04:01.379 - 01:04:01.787, Speaker B: Classic.
01:04:01.851 - 01:04:10.475, Speaker A: Oh, how can it be a store of value if it went down right? Like, what's your take on this? You've been watching these people documenting, I mean, you know, for, for a decade.
01:04:10.515 - 01:04:39.221, Speaker B: More than I'm getting old, Alex. Man, it's just wearing on me. You know, this, the amount of stupid, all the fud. I mean, it's actually led my. You know, outside of crypto, like I bought a bunch of SpaceX because I spent about a year and a half reading into it. Basically when I see fud, a lot of fud, and when you dig in, it's just totally fabricated bullshit that makes me incredibly bullish on something. So, you know, it's a little tiring in crypto after being in the space for such a long time.
01:04:39.333 - 01:04:39.693, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:04:39.749 - 01:04:59.887, Speaker B: So the one about volatility is a classic question. Well, it's not money involved. It's too volatile. Two counters to this. If you look at a chart of gold over the last century, very choppy, there's not a nice linear line. It's all over the place. The other is a first principle is thinking of, okay, if the price is stable.
01:04:59.887 - 01:05:19.793, Speaker B: This is more of like an entropy question. There has to be an externalized heat or externalized volatility injected somewhere else. You can't dampen volatility in a certain region unless you take heat out or unless you take away some of the volatility and pull it out. So yes, the dollar is stable, it's stably declining.
01:05:19.929 - 01:05:22.825, Speaker A: It's the money supply of the dollar that is not stable. Right?
01:05:22.905 - 01:05:44.375, Speaker B: Yeah. To have a subjectively stable purchasing power, you have to have complete control over it and it have to be completely centralized. And it also externalizes the volatility elsewhere. That's what I'm trying to say with that. Externalizes the volatility. You can't suppress volatility forever. A peg has never been maintained perpetually.
01:05:44.375 - 01:06:15.615, Speaker B: And so bitcoin, because it's decentralized, will never have a stable price. Maybe in its very like, decades from now, when it's mature, it might trade like gold, where it's barely up a point every day. But the entire purpose of a store of value asset is to not be centrally controlled. That's why gold and bitcoin are the best store of value assets out there. If the price was stable, that means it would have to be centrally controlled. So volatility is a feature, not a bug. It's a representation of its decentralization rather than a problem.
