00:00:00.720 - 00:00:10.961, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains. An infinite amount of cash. I'm your host, Alex Thorne. The U. S. Banking system is sound and resilient. Bitcoin made a new all time high.
00:00:11.113 - 00:00:11.985, Speaker B: If you're not long.
00:00:12.065 - 00:00:13.697, Speaker A: If you're not long, you're short.
00:00:13.881 - 00:00:20.393, Speaker B: Satoshi's gonna come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet. All bitcoin's gonna be erased. Bitcoin.
00:00:20.489 - 00:00:42.533, Speaker A: Bitcoin's the best crypto. Bitcoin is going to zero. Welcome back to Galaxy. As always, I'm your host Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy. We've got another episode of the Singapore tapes and I'm talking with Arthur Cheong, CIO and founder of Defiance Capital. Arthur Ox on Twitter. Many will know him there and Arthur's a fascinating investor in the defi space in particular.
00:00:42.533 - 00:01:04.811, Speaker A: Lots of interesting insights from Arthur and you're going to enjoy this interview. Before we get to that, I need to remind you to please refer to link to the disclaimer in the podcast notes. I know that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer recommendation or solicitation by Galaxy or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Let's hop right into the interview with Arthur. Welcome back to Galaxy Brains. I'm here with Arthur, founder and CIO of Defiance Capital. Arthur, thank you so much for coming on Galaxy Brains.
00:01:04.883 - 00:01:07.955, Speaker B: No, thanks for having me. I mean, always been enjoying Galaxy Brain podcasts.
00:01:07.995 - 00:01:31.175, Speaker A: That's very nice of you to say. And when we were coming to Singapore for token 2049, my team and I were like, we need to talk to Arthur, one of the most prominent defi and crypto investors in Asia, also based in Singapore. Maybe just start. We're at. This is my first time at token 2049. It's absolutely massive. It actually reminds me of consensus in New York in like 2017.
00:01:31.175 - 00:01:34.971, Speaker A: What's happening in Singapore? Like, why is it?
00:01:35.163 - 00:02:03.349, Speaker B: I think that Singapore, and especially Token in particular has just become the perfect place for the East East Midwest gathering point. There is no other conference that is as diverse and AS International as token24.9 at Singapore at this point. I think that the reason is because in Asia. Other part, if you go and do a conference here, it's really for the local market reason. But Singapore doesn't have a big local market. So you come here for the international exposure.
00:02:03.349 - 00:02:36.657, Speaker B: And so you have like Chinese team, they are based here. You obviously have Singapore based team, Southeast Asia team. Then you also have India as well. But then you have a lot of like the, like all the big US companies, especially Exchanges custody provider, they all have a pretty big Asia Pacific office in Singapore also. It's always been a place they're familiar with. And I think that over the past few years, I think that people in the US kind of realize that Asia has a lot of things happening and some place they want to understand more, which is why you see all the top people all coming in. And I think Token just did a very good job in inviting all the top people in the crypto to come.
00:02:36.657 - 00:02:38.481, Speaker B: So it just become a shelling point at this point.
00:02:38.553 - 00:02:38.857, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:02:38.921 - 00:02:43.505, Speaker B: So I personally, I'm also impressed and surprised by the number of attendees this year.
00:02:43.585 - 00:03:07.357, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I read or somebody told me that there were 20 plus thousand, which is. That's big. I mean, I think the biggest one I've ever attended was a Bitcoin Miami 2022, and it was 25,000. So, like, this is among the biggest crypto conferences ever. Yep. And it's far for a lot of people though, to travel. So there's definitely a confluence happening here.
00:03:07.357 - 00:03:12.773, Speaker A: Yes. Now, you also are based here and Defiance Capital is based here.
00:03:12.829 - 00:03:13.613, Speaker B: Yes, Correct.
00:03:13.749 - 00:03:39.231, Speaker A: How do you. And of course you've been. For our audience who may not know, you're arthur0x on Twitter. A great follow. How do you think about the global nature of crypto? How do you reconcile East First West? Like, what are your insights here to offer from someone based in Singapore, but in this global market? Yeah, it's a very broad question. I apologize for that.
00:03:39.263 - 00:03:43.511, Speaker B: Yes. Yeah. So crypto is definitely a global asset class.
00:03:43.583 - 00:03:43.815, Speaker A: Right.
00:03:43.855 - 00:03:59.751, Speaker B: Like, it's one of the very few assets that you get a global demand and supply dynamics. Like, I think the only other asset class that's similar is U.S. equity market and U.S. treasury. Yeah. No other market come close. And which is why crypto is great.
00:03:59.751 - 00:04:36.513, Speaker B: Right. It's global, intransigent, cultural, geographical boundary, but at the same time, different culture, different geographic, kind of like a different way to think about crypto and the different way to use and invest in crypto. So I think that is where the difference comes in. And I think this is the part that we can kind of really see the difference and kind of feel it, because I think Singapore is kind of like a perfect place to get exposed to the western side of how the crypto community build and think and invest, and also on the Asia side as well. So you get a very perfect blend. If you're able to really speak to both community in a very broad way speaking, you really get a very good synthesis. Synthesis of the information and what's happening in the industry.
00:04:36.513 - 00:04:37.089, Speaker B: Yep.
00:04:37.177 - 00:04:44.965, Speaker A: It's so interesting like how global it is when you focus on defi. Is that, is that your focus by the way? What is the focus on?
00:04:45.345 - 00:04:53.793, Speaker B: So I, I started using Defi in late 2019 so like almost like a ground zero participant since the beginning was.
00:04:53.809 - 00:04:55.441, Speaker A: Like what maker and compound and compound.
00:04:55.473 - 00:05:10.513, Speaker B: Maker and compound and uniso I think was deployed around that time. Close. I think 2019. Yeah, Uniswap was deployed in 2019 and yeah, so that's it. Like the whole Defi telegram group have like less than 400 of us and we're just arguing all the time there.
00:05:10.609 - 00:05:24.343, Speaker A: But you. So now you. But this year and you're managing capital and defiance capital, what kinds of trends are you following this year? Because it's been a weird market. So very bitcoin driven market which is rare for a supposed bull market.
00:05:24.439 - 00:05:59.185, Speaker B: Yes, correct. So our fund is agnostic, we are liquid venture funds. So we focus on the non majors outside of bitcoin and we always been very data driven in what we want to invest in. Because I think you can be very thesis driven, have a great hypothesis but. But you need the data to back up your view and thesis. So what we have seen is defi is still the biggest product market fit. Although that over the past two years there's a lot of like disillusion because you know there's a lot of hacks and like a lot of business the usage and the metrics are non sustainable after the incentive runs out.
00:05:59.185 - 00:06:39.059, Speaker B: But even we've seen some protocol able to maintain the usage and the momentum even after they have finished incentive and actually recover the most compared to the previous all time high. So we started as a defi focused fund and during when the defi was like, you know, overvalued and all those things, obviously we reduced exposure, we started to broaden up the sector. But right now, I mean we still pay attention to every sector. But we also start to think after four years of DeFi summer, Defi becoming very investable again and very interesting again because we are like the space is maturing and we see the unsustainable stuff. Like everyone kind of know that what doesn't work, what is working are working fantastically.
00:06:39.187 - 00:07:03.907, Speaker A: Yeah, it's almost like an essential utility in crypto markets. I mean it definitely is. I mean we do stuff on chain galaxy. Right. And I think these are vibrant credit markets, exchanges, synthetic asset protocols. Why isn't it, you know, when I think about like 24 this year, I Think of it as pretty much a bitcoin and like meme coin driven market.
00:07:04.011 - 00:07:06.117, Speaker B: Correct? The meme coin Solana.
00:07:06.181 - 00:07:24.425, Speaker A: Yeah, that's right. I mean a lot of the meme coins happening on Solana but in Defi, right. I mean most of that trading is on chain but we don't hear a lot about like it's not like Defi Summer with yam finance and all the excitement around those new. What is there to be excited from other than just the stability and usage of Defi like in your mind?
00:07:25.245 - 00:08:13.389, Speaker B: I think the thing to be excited about is it is still the largest product market fit of crypto and we are at a stage that we can mature and scale to the next level, which I think that every exciting new technology and product need to go through. Because like at an early stage there was just a lot of things that doesn't work and we didn't know that what worked and what doesn't work yet. And we kind of wanted like also people are excited about different use case of like crypto like NFT Gaming and Metaverse and Deepin right now and like a little like Dao in general. But my view is at a current stage of blockchain crypto web3 defi have the strongest product market fit outside of Stablecoin and like bitcoin as money, Defi is the best use case and we are at the level we are ready to guess for Defi to get to the next level of growth and industry.
00:08:13.557 - 00:08:32.751, Speaker A: I think that's right about product market fit with Defi. I mean it absolutely works. And I'm thinking about all the failed primitives that were attempted or even hacks. They've really declined significantly. Like I think things are still being hacked but it's not really Defi Smart contract applications so much. Yep. How do you.
00:08:32.751 - 00:08:48.591, Speaker A: Well yeah, I mean that maturity, that level of maturity. Do you think we're reaching a stage where traditional finance might even start to consider being able to, you know, if we leave aside the regulatory questions like is it, is it almost battle tested and ready for bigger markets? Is that what you're saying?
00:08:48.663 - 00:09:24.435, Speaker B: No. So this is a very interesting point. I think that you have two camps and I'm more on a camp where I think that Defi is actually building and we are better off building an alternative and parallel financial system in the short term. Obviously like we don't get all the like you know, short term flow from a traditional capital. I think they will come but obviously like we like if you do it in a more purist method they will not come as fast. But I think that's fine. I think that one thing that if you especially Contrast DeFi and FinTech is FinTech ultimately built on the traditional financial infrastructure and rail and they've kind of hit like a bottleneck in terms of the growth.
00:09:24.435 - 00:09:54.861, Speaker B: Like there is no sort of marginal cost advantage of scaling of FinTech compared to DeFi. They all need to have the same compliance KYC ML procedure and they don't have advantage compared to Tradfi actually. And in fact they're in disadvantage because they do not have access to the Fed. They do not have access to the lowest cost of funding compared to the banks and the big financial firm. So. But Defi doesn't really have this issue. We are building a completely alternate parallel financial systems that it's just completely different architecture, everything's on chain.
00:09:54.861 - 00:10:10.117, Speaker B: So I think the one of the great thing is that for some DEFI product, if they hit product market fit, the marginal cost of scaling is almost zero. Like if like Uniswap, right. They have like few millions of daily active user how much money they spend on marketing, like literally almost zero.
00:10:10.181 - 00:10:10.785, Speaker A: Right.
00:10:11.225 - 00:10:18.073, Speaker B: Except for some of the sponsorship. Whatever. I don't even see them sponsoring token. Like I see MakerDAO doing it as sky, but I don't see Uniswap doing it.
00:10:18.089 - 00:10:19.153, Speaker A: So that is sky now.
00:10:19.169 - 00:10:19.321, Speaker B: Right.
00:10:19.353 - 00:10:23.449, Speaker A: I was on sky stage and I was like I don't recognize the logo. But didn't they just change their name?
00:10:23.497 - 00:10:24.681, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a rebrand from MakerDAO.
00:10:24.713 - 00:10:25.457, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:10:25.561 - 00:11:06.655, Speaker B: So I think that the marginal cost like of scaling is almost zero if you really hit a product market fit. Yeah. And I think that as the number and value of on chain assets, stablecoin, Bitcoin like Solana Eth increase in value, the economy that Defi is servicing naturally increase as well. So I think that's kind of like an ultimate bull case for Defi as a whole. And I think that I want Defi to be an alternative system that over a long run can actually stand toes to toes with threadfi in some sense. But I don't think it will overtake traditional finance because I think that if you live in a very well developed country like Singapore, like us, Europe. Right.
00:11:06.655 - 00:11:21.383, Speaker B: Like the need for Defi is decreased access for the speculation part and like seeking a higher return investment. But for a lot of countries where you have huge economic and financial instability, Defi built a parallel and alternative system that they can utilize and ease their life savings there.
00:11:21.439 - 00:11:46.189, Speaker A: Yeah, that is really interesting. Not everywhere and by the way, yeah, definitely. Not everywhere has this vibrant, mature, safe, a capital market as the advanced nations do. But also, you know, that's why the wealthy from all over the world invest in countries like the US and Singapore. But many people don't have access to that. So Defi can be that outlet for them. You put out some content about AAVE in particular, which is, you know, one of the largest lending.
00:11:46.189 - 00:11:47.541, Speaker A: Is it the largest? Maybe it is the largest.
00:11:47.573 - 00:11:48.093, Speaker B: He is the largest.
00:11:48.149 - 00:12:06.283, Speaker A: So it's the largest lending market on chain. What is your thesis about aave? Why has AAVE been doing so well this year? The rest defi just sort of seems sleepy. Maybe that's a good thing because it means that it's just working. It's not like explain your thought process on aave.
00:12:06.459 - 00:13:02.073, Speaker B: So we wrote a thesis on this one month ago and we published it and I think it got a pretty good reception. The essential part of thesis is so we are a fund that invests in the non majors. So this is the period that we see the most disillusioned about altcoin in general. People are like, what are we investing in? Everything, regardless of fundamentals, are going to be down 50, 70% in a few months after when Bitcoin is down 10, 20%, altcoin drawdown 50 to 70% and meme coin outperforms. So why do we care? So in this kind of context you really look at, okay, what can you really invest in and believe that you will still exist and thrive in a longer period, like more than six months, like 12 months, one year, two years away. And you just go to defi llama, you go to token terminal, whatever, right? You go through what protocol is actually producing revenue and cash flow. There isn't really that many that's sustainable and organic and there's less than 20 of them that really give you a number that you're interested in.
00:13:02.073 - 00:13:41.661, Speaker B: And then AAVE is just consistently in the top five and top 10 of these. And then after you look at a number, then you look at the qualitative metrics, like how defensible is the mold? You know, is this product vertical, like important? Is it going to exist? Like, and then just AAVE just tick all the boxes. And also like you have pending catalyst, you know, the tokenomic changes, all these things just all come in the right time. And I think that people really doesn't have that many good choices. So just, you know, everyone kind of read the thesis or like read like, you know, understand what AAVE is doing. It just becomes very easy to underwrite as investment. And especially in this, you know, altcoin market, there's just not many things that you can underwrite easily without like, you know, taking a huge drawdown risk.
00:13:41.661 - 00:14:07.093, Speaker B: And I think the AAVE people know that if exists, you know, the max downside is relatively capped compared to others. And there's still a lot of upside because you're seeing the growth happening. What really impressed me is AAVE have six quarters of consistent growth in protocol revenue since 2023. And we have seen some pretty crazy correction from second half of 2023 until now. But AAVE revenue consistently grow on a quarterly basis.
00:14:07.189 - 00:14:26.511, Speaker A: Interesting. Do you see this market or how long do you see this market? Maybe is the way to ask remaining a bitcoin driven market. I mean this people have asked me and you've been around a long time as well like you know, where are we in the cycle man? Like shouldn't it if. Shouldn't the hot ball of money have moved down to eth and then longer tail assets? Right.
00:14:26.543 - 00:14:27.275, Speaker B: That's the.
00:14:27.615 - 00:14:30.687, Speaker A: Do you think that's going to happen and if so when or. Yeah, so.
00:14:30.711 - 00:14:33.599, Speaker B: So I think that's like the biggest question everyone was asking.
00:14:33.687 - 00:14:34.095, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:34.175 - 00:15:19.233, Speaker B: And I think first of all is I do not believe in the classic four year cycle anymore because I think the previous four year cycle is very driven by bitcoin halving. And then every single marginal, every next bitcoin halving, the marginal difference to the bitcoin supply and stock to flow is all very minimal. So I think that start to matter less. And the past few cycle and everything we generally only have two sample size, right? The 2017 cycle and 2021 cycle you can't really count. The sample size isn't that big. And one thing that present in these two samples is we have a massive influx of retail from a few big wealth effect which is like I think 2017 was Ethereum as a few selected ICO and 2021 was just everything, right. And the retail are not coming back.
00:15:19.233 - 00:15:47.151, Speaker B: And I think we all know the reason they're not coming back, right. That we have just so much damage last cycle both in like Defi, like Luna and also on the CEFI side like Celsius Blockfi. Everyone got burned institution like retail like sovereign wealth fund, everyone got burned. Like it's very normal that the retail are not coming back so soon. And we also don't have like, we have like 5% risk free interest rate. So all these things combined just means that retail are not coming back. So I think that if retail are not coming back, there's nobody there to buy dumb shit at dumb valuation.
00:15:47.151 - 00:16:12.885, Speaker B: It's all like very smart money market. So that's my base case. I actually do not think the classic outcycle will come back anytime soon. So it kind of means that the dispersion of returns will continue. And I think that's a good thing. It's healthier for the industry so that we do not want the most treacherous, the most attention grabbing but hollow stuff to become like the most valuable protocol. Which happens that if you look at like 20, 21, the top 20 crypto by market cap is so different compared to right now.
00:16:12.925 - 00:16:22.237, Speaker A: Crazy. It really is. Yeah. And 21 and two were like it's almost an anomaly. I was just looking. You can look at almost any metric venture funding. Great.
00:16:22.237 - 00:16:54.143, Speaker A: One, yep. I think 21 and 22 each had 30 billion invested into crypto. Now we're looking at annually like and now we're looking at like I think it was like 6 or 7 if I recall for last year total. Now we're clocking like one to three per quarter. So like down a lot. A third of where it was. You can look at, we were looking at loan book size at the C5 lenders like talking about 20 to 30 billion in a quarter in Q1 22 dropping now to like maybe a billion total.
00:16:54.143 - 00:17:12.265, Speaker A: Right. Is that, do you think we'll see, is that going to happen again? I mean I almost think of it as mania that's meant to be discredited. Like chop off the top of those charts and then you see a. You actually do see a longer term growth if you disregard that. Like was that mania that we're not likely to see again in your mind?
00:17:12.885 - 00:17:40.548, Speaker B: I think it should not be in your base case. I mean you never say never. Right. And I mean nobody was expecting the US equity market to make an all time high almost on like a yearly basis like for the past few years. I mean all the value investors think is overvalued. I think that you need some paradigm shifting stuff to happen. Like it doesn't have, I mean one is like from a pure product innovation point of view, like we have a new like a category that excites a huge number of market like AI.
00:17:40.548 - 00:17:58.907, Speaker B: Like let's say AI. There's like a new kind of things that excite the traditional market. Right. And that's kind of like what pushed the US equity market all time high. Like Nvidia like did a crazy return in the past one year. This doesn't really happen. In this crypto cycle, another thing that can happen is that's just like structural, regulatory and political level.
00:17:58.907 - 00:18:35.917, Speaker B: Right. And I think that if we do get a Republican presidency that is possible to be a paradigm shifting change to the crypto market. I think that what you will see with a Republican president is the regulatory regime is going to change. I think we are going to be much more friendly and much more willing to see that the altcoins that not going to be categorized as securities. And if they get some kind of sandbox and everything they'll be able to be more focused on attaching value capture to the token. And I think this is something we talk about a lot but it's been missing. Right.
00:18:35.917 - 00:19:05.013, Speaker B: Like when we talk about the broken altcoin market, there's a few reasons. First of all, it's imbalance of capital between private market and the liquid market. That's something that I think, I mean you guys have like a vision track that shows the data like hedge fund, like a crypto venture Fund manage roughly 3x capital of crypto hedge fund. So that's a big imbalance I think will take some time to fix. The second thing is just that a big part of the natural buying demand in the US equity market is a stock buyback and dividends. Right. This is almost completely missing in crypto.
00:19:05.013 - 00:19:29.093, Speaker B: I mean we are all investing in growth but I think that there are some protocol that they can start to really return value to the protocol. But with the current regulatory regime you can't really do that easily. I think that almost every US team they're a lot more conservative when they do this. So I think that need to change in that change a lot of outcome, become a lot more investable. Yeah, I think, I think so this is something that can actually make a lot of altcoins become a lot more interesting again.
00:19:29.149 - 00:19:43.319, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a great point. I think that like you said, a sandbox, an innovation and focused regulatory regime or I guess innovation constructive, maybe very bullish for altcoins broadly.
00:19:43.367 - 00:19:43.751, Speaker B: Yep.
00:19:43.823 - 00:19:53.927, Speaker A: Bitcoin doesn't really need much. Maybe even eth now doesn't really look like. I mean they're still. The SEC is still trying to, you know, not really say it's a commodity but they have, I think they throw.
00:19:53.951 - 00:19:56.743, Speaker B: In a tower essential on this. They're easy, easier target to pick, I think.
00:19:56.799 - 00:20:35.825, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. So I think that could be a big structural change. One of the other structural changes that we've had this year has been the launch of the ETFs. Obviously now Bitcoin and ETH ETFs in the US ETH ETFs, you know, sort of like they launched into a very different market than the Bitcoin ETFs did. So we won't, you know, kick a dead horse because I think eventually they'll be like Lazarus and they'll rise. I believe that, but they haven't yet. How does the existence of those products you think impact either the current market that you're seeing, how is it impacting it or how will it, will it drive? Is that vehicle very important? Like what will it do to the way you think about the broader market in crypto?
00:20:35.905 - 00:20:42.041, Speaker B: No, it's very clear, it's important. It's all in the data. Right. Bitcoin have attracted what was the latest number?
00:20:42.113 - 00:20:44.225, Speaker A: 17 billion net worth of net inflows.
00:20:44.385 - 00:21:19.973, Speaker B: And I think that's kind of what separate bitcoin and the rest of the market. This year Bitcoin are outperforming, I would say 80 plus percent of the top 200 cryptos because it's the only asset that's getting sort of like a traditional finance, semi institutional bid. But none of the other asset gets it. And I think when you look at traditional market, one of the big parallel is this increased popularity of passive fund that is liquid that you can trick in and out on an ETF daily compared to the actively managed fund, the mutual funds. And you see all the growth in the crypto asset manager all coming from a passive. I mean yes, it's all bitcoin. So this is big.
00:21:19.973 - 00:21:32.533, Speaker B: And I think that the reason of bitcoin outperformance is also that it's the only asset that get natural buying demand where every other assets like almost like a inverse. Right. You get VC sellings but you don't get natural buying demand.
00:21:32.589 - 00:21:32.877, Speaker A: Right.
00:21:32.941 - 00:21:35.405, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think it's definitely huge. Yeah.
00:21:35.525 - 00:22:01.465, Speaker A: Do you think it'll impact the that rotation? I mean is that another reason why you don't think the sort of alt season is close? Like back in the day, say take 17. Right. People had to. A lot of the trading pairs were bitcoin denominated and the big sort of meta was the ICO and that you need to buy eth for. So there was reasons to have both structurally. Now most of the trading is done with stablecoins. So not bitcoin denominated.
00:22:01.465 - 00:22:21.681, Speaker A: There aren't really ICOs anymore. Right. It's now about like airdrops and points and all the ways to distribute. But you used to have to buy Crypto, you had to go on an exchange and you likely had it on the exchange. So then it was very easy to be like, wait a sec, maybe there's the next new one. And sell bitcoin by eth and then sell eth and buy, I don't know, Cardano or whatever it was. Right.
00:22:21.681 - 00:22:32.873, Speaker A: That the capital in the ETFs is sticky and stuck there. Right. Does that dampen also? Is that a factor? That's sort of a thesis that I have that that it dampens intra crypto cyclicality?
00:22:33.009 - 00:22:54.147, Speaker B: No, I think it definitely does. Right. Because I think like you or not, most investors do fiat currency denominated and largely US dollar. So yeah, I mean, I think people see bitcoin and outcome as a very separate investment right now. In fact, that there's a huge kind of like a, you know, thinking that, oh, bitcoin is something you keep, like you don't really want to lose more Bitcoin, like.
00:22:54.171 - 00:22:54.355, Speaker A: Right.
00:22:54.395 - 00:23:15.857, Speaker B: It's like a lot of Bitcoin OGs that have like, you know, lost so much money on doing all this random ico, all this altcoin is like, I would have done much better like by not doing all this crap and just hodl. Right. And that's kind of how the bitcoin hodl culture have permeated and persisted. And I think that this is actually getting stronger due to the outperformance this year. So I think, yeah, that's definitely true. Like, you know, people are seeing it as a very different investment right now.
00:23:15.931 - 00:23:23.757, Speaker A: Do you think we'll ever get like. I love the way you talk about the parallel economies of on chain versus tradfi.
00:23:23.821 - 00:23:24.229, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:24.317 - 00:23:33.517, Speaker A: But we have seen a little bit leak from tradfi with real world assets. Right. Do you see any more of that happening or do these really stay separate like for a long time?
00:23:33.621 - 00:23:52.967, Speaker B: No, I think that this will continue to happen. There will be a lot of players trying to bridge the gap. So rwa all this like on chain assets, they will continue to increase. Yeah, I think the integration will continue to increase. But they will come because we offer them some benefit and they see a market opportunity for them.
00:23:53.031 - 00:23:56.343, Speaker A: It won't be them adopting our technology for their use. You don't think.
00:23:56.399 - 00:24:13.521, Speaker B: I think that will happen, but I'm not bullish on the pace and the velocity because it took us almost like five years for all these big enterprises or government or central bank to realize that. And enterprise chain doesn't make sense. I don't know if anyone still believe in enterprise chain.
00:24:13.553 - 00:24:16.585, Speaker A: I think probably like less enterprise blockchain, private blockchain. I agree.
00:24:16.625 - 00:24:42.855, Speaker B: No, I don't think that many people still believe in it anymore. Yeah, it took them five years to realize that. Yeah, there's no point to build enterprise blockchain. If you want to use crypto, just use public blockchain. So I think that's what happened. And then when it comes to defi, it probably would take another five years to think that, oh, you know, if you really want to tap on the benefit of defi, you kind of need to make a lot of things like permissionless in some form. But I think it would take them another five years to probably realize that it will not happen so soon.
00:24:42.855 - 00:25:12.243, Speaker B: But meanwhile you're going to see a lot of experiment happening and some players pushing the boundary and if someone able to really push the boundary very hard and everyone will follow through. I kind of think that it's interesting that it doesn't get talked about enough like how Terra has been able to maintain this regulatory arbitrage. Probably you can enlighten me, but they have Canto Fitzro as the custodian of their treasury bill. They are not US regulated, they are based overseas, but they are the largest stable coin by circulation.
00:25:12.339 - 00:25:14.731, Speaker A: They're one of the holders of treasuries in the world.
00:25:14.803 - 00:25:29.307, Speaker B: Like imagine that if you were to launch a new stablecoin, would you copy Tether's model? None of you, none of the lawyer think that you will work is say that you definitely get shut down within like a month. But they have been able to maintain this. But it's not replicable.
00:25:29.491 - 00:25:30.603, Speaker A: It doesn't seem so.
00:25:30.699 - 00:25:36.139, Speaker B: Yeah, so it's just I think if someone able to push the boundary and become extremely successful, that will kind of change the landscape.
00:25:36.187 - 00:25:36.651, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:25:36.683 - 00:25:39.491, Speaker B: But I, I don't have a vision of how that will happen.
00:25:39.563 - 00:25:55.035, Speaker A: I don't really either. But it's a big. I think it's one of those big outstanding questions in crypto long term. Before we wrap, Arthur, tell us your backstory a little bit. Where did you come from before crypto? What got you into crypto and defi in general? I'd love to know myself.
00:25:55.195 - 00:26:19.869, Speaker B: Yeah. So I started my career in the oil trading space. I worked for BP in the trading development program. And at the third year of my working career I just discovered crypto. You know, like Ethereum did like a what, 20x in 2017, I think roughly there. So you're just fascinated at what is driving this asset to outperform. And I heard about bitcoin in like 2013, but I just dismissed it right like most people and it's a scam, it's going to go to zero.
00:26:19.869 - 00:26:52.649, Speaker B: So when it doesn't go to zero and it coming back so strongly, that's where you really think, oh, I might be wrong. You rediscover it and you just. And when you discover Ethereum, then you see that, oh, the potential for all sort of different applications to be built on top of decentralized global economy. And that just fascinate me. So after going down deep into the rabbit hole, I just discovered I want to join in space full time and just see what I can build and do here. So joined in space full time in 2018, did a couple of different things. I tried to launch my own startup as well, but it didn't work out well and I realized I'm a way better investor than builder back then.
00:26:52.649 - 00:27:18.655, Speaker B: So just stay on, continue to invest. And I think what really kicked it off is I didn't really give up in the bear market. I just continue to try to experiment and see what use case actually really works. I think I kind of still believe that some use case is possible in crypto and blockchain in 2018, which trust me, is not the consensus. A lot of people just think that crypto is only good for fundraising. ICO speculation, that's it. No Use case is possible.
00:27:18.655 - 00:27:57.391, Speaker B: And also I think Stablecoin was launched in 2018 and that really continue validated my thesis because Stablecoin, I think that is one missing piece in crypto in 2018 that we need a more stable unit account and it did happen. So when defi summer came, I'm just fully prepared and ready to capitalize on it. And building on that momentum, I launched Defiance Capital in 2020. And over the past four years we just continue to grow, invest. We hit a big roadblock and all this thing, but we come back and I wouldn't say stronger, but I think we are still trying to get back where we are. But yeah, I think we are at a pretty good place and I think this is where I came from.
00:27:57.463 - 00:28:06.359, Speaker A: It's really interesting. 2020 seems like an age ago. Yep, we've come so far and so have you. Arthur. Thank you so much for coming on Galaxy Brains.
