00:00:00.680 - 00:00:03.638, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, an infinite amount of cash.
00:00:03.734 - 00:00:04.366, Speaker B: Cash.
00:00:04.518 - 00:00:11.014, Speaker A: I'm your host, Alex Thorne. The us banking system is sound and resilient. Bitcoin made a new all time high.
00:00:11.182 - 00:00:17.662, Speaker B: If you're not long. If you're not long, you're short. Satoshi's gonna come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet.
00:00:17.766 - 00:00:18.030, Speaker C: All.
00:00:18.070 - 00:00:24.850, Speaker B: Bitcoin's gonna be erased. Bitcoin. Bitcoin's the best crypto else. Bitcoin is going to zero.
00:00:25.480 - 00:00:42.376, Speaker A: Welcome back to Galaxy brains. I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of research at Galaxy. Bitcoin, not zero. And it's a huge week. It's bitcoin's national political convention week, it turns out. Yes, I'm in Nashville. I'm currently at Bitcoin park, but I am in Nashville this week for the Bitcoin conference, bitcoin 2024.
00:00:42.376 - 00:01:16.094, Speaker A: And we have an amazing guest for you, David Bailey, founder CEO of BTC, Inc, which owns Bitcoin magazine. He is our guest, and we're going to get into it with what to expect this week from the conference. News emanating from the conference, it's gonna be exciting conversation. We'll also check with our good friend BiMnet, a BB from Galaxy trading, as always, to talk about markets and macro. Before we get into that, I need to remind you all to please refer to the link to disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Gosh, it's fun. We're down here on the ground.
00:01:16.094 - 00:01:40.030, Speaker A: I'm in Nashville. It's starting to get chaotic. There's, as far as I'm aware, I think there's. I'm personally aware of seven sitting us senators that are in Nashville for the conference, and there's probably more. It has become a big political issue, and there's going to be a lot of interesting news emanating for it. We'll get to that interview with David in a second, but first, let's check in with Bimnet Abibi. Let's go now to our friend Bim Netabeebe from Galaxy trading.
00:01:40.030 - 00:01:42.222, Speaker A: As always, Bimnet. Welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:01:42.286 - 00:01:43.370, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:01:43.670 - 00:01:54.190, Speaker A: So I see equities are down a little bit. Bitcoin is stabilized after coming down. You have the Ethereum, ETF's, and I saw more mount Gox distributions. What are you tracking this week?
00:01:54.890 - 00:02:33.264, Speaker C: Tracking almost everything, but the biggest kind of thing impacting risk sentiment is tech stocks. Nasdaq is down 3% ish today, which makes it the largest drop since December 22. And you've got some concerns around the semi industry. You've got concerns around just over concentration of the top market cap names. You've got what looks like a trend that's a become exhausted. And you've got data in the US that's started to turn pretty aggressively. I highlighted a couple of weeks ago the ISM services being below 50, but you've just continued to get soft data.
00:02:33.264 - 00:03:06.930, Speaker C: New home sales were weak today as a function of this weak data. You've had bonds rally and so you're seeing two year yields at the low end of the trend. You know, more than two cuts baked in for this year. So you've had kind of a repricing of the Fed policy path as a function of data. In addition, you know, you had comments by Bullard, former Fed member this morning that were dovish as well. So that's creating a little bit of a bid to bonds. And you've also had the curve kind of steepen.
00:03:06.930 - 00:03:54.174, Speaker C: And so it's really kind of watching this intersection between softening data and trends and positioning that are correcting. And so everybody, as a function of just the broader strength and momentum, had been getting long tech, they'd been getting short small caps, and you've seen an unwind of that kind of positioning. In addition, you've had a very strong rally in fixed income that I think has room further to go. And in spite of that, bitcoin is holding up really well. And I think that it goes to kind of the big, it speaks to how big the conference is this week. Right? You've got a former president and a likely future president. DJT speaking about bitcoin at a conference.
00:03:54.174 - 00:04:06.294, Speaker C: You've got the vice presidential candidate, you've got RFK junior, and you've got, as you tweeted the other day, there are seven sitting us senators at bitcoin Nashville.
00:04:06.382 - 00:04:08.134, Speaker A: There are also just the ones I know of.
00:04:08.182 - 00:04:59.990, Speaker C: That's just the ones you know, there were rumors that Kamala Harris was going to potentially join that Elon Musk. Long story short, bitcoin is a political issue. There are tons of single issue voters, and I think both sides are awake to that reality. And no matter what is said or done after bitcoin Nashville, I can be confident in the fact that crypto is a mainstream issue. It's a bipartisan issue, and it's something that is going to get addressed by whoever wins the presidency and all signs point to a loosening of regulations and just more openness for crypto. In addition, when you have days like today with Nasdaq down three and bitcoin up one, it only reinforces the idea that it is a diversifying asset. It is providing you a unique stream of returns.
00:04:59.990 - 00:05:40.970, Speaker C: If you really think about what the crux of long term investing is about is finding these streams of uncorrelated returns and putting them into a portfolio portfolio. I think more days like today and you're going to have people that are looking at Nasdaq as a big part of what they do, and they're going to be thinking about bitcoin more. So. And then lastly, I just have to touch on the Ethereum ETF product. I think it's a major milestone for the industry to get this product through, and ultimately I think this is going to help boost adoption. And there are strong arguments as to why. It's also a good diversifier in a portfolio.
00:05:40.970 - 00:06:38.366, Speaker C: However, I would like to highlight that there's still a ton of supply that is probably going to get redeemed out of the grayscale product. They had $486 million worth of net outflows from that product. I do think there's going to be a little bit of pressure just from redemptions out of that ETF, but once you churn through that supply, you're left with a product that's going to have passive inflows that's roughly a third of the market cap of bitcoin over time. I just continue to think that folks will just put this in their portfolio and it'll just start trending higher. And so short term, I'm cautious on ETH. I think bitcoin's probably a better long going into the conference, but long term, I think this is great for the space. And if you see what Hester Pierce said last week, she said there's a path forward for in kind creates and in kind redemptions for the ETH product and for bitcoin.
00:06:38.366 - 00:06:55.392, Speaker C: And so as long as we get a new administration that's open to crypto, a little less hostile, I think these products are going to get better over time and they're going to continue to provide diversified returns and they're going to continue to draw new investors.
00:06:55.576 - 00:07:01.800, Speaker A: Yep, there you go. Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. My friend, an exciting week. Thanks for coming on. Galaxy Brains.
00:07:01.920 - 00:07:02.700, Speaker C: Pleasure.
00:07:04.280 - 00:07:14.082, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, David Bailey, CEO founder of BTC Inc. Parent company of, among other things, the Bitcoin conference in Nashville. David, welcome to Galaxy Brainstor.
00:07:14.176 - 00:07:16.966, Speaker B: Yo, Alex, thank you for having me on your show, dude.
00:07:16.998 - 00:07:41.998, Speaker A: It's been a wild ride for BTC, Inc. By the way, I was just. We were talking before we started about bitcoin 2019 in San Francisco at that old car dealership, which was, by the way, a great conference. That was five years ago, and I've heard that bitcoin 24 in Nashville is going to be, I don't know, yet another step up for the conference that's been a staple.
00:07:42.174 - 00:08:04.766, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it's been, you know, I would say the. The trajectory of our company and the story of our company has been about as volatile as bitcoin. So, you know, we're authentic all the way to the core. No, I mean, there's been so many chapters. I have a fake tell all that. You know, I like to say, one day I will. I will publish, and, you know, I.
00:08:04.766 - 00:08:36.960, Speaker B: The only thing I keep notes on is when something really crazy happens, I'll create, like, the title of the chapter, and then, you know, that's the only thing I kind of, like, log. And the. The chapter titles have gotten so insane that, you know, one of the people on my team the other day was like, you could never publish this because literally no one would ever believe that this was a real thing. Yeah, no, I mean, it's. It's. The companies have been through many ups and downs. You know, the.
00:08:36.960 - 00:09:12.020, Speaker B: The downs, you know, it's yin and yang. You know, like, you can't have one without the other. And it's the downs that shape you and create the dynamics necessary to have the ups. But, you know, right now, we're going through a major up in the company, and not only will Nashville be successful, which we took a lot of chances on Nashville, and there was chances that we took that. Now we're able to calculate, like, did that. Was that a good decision or bad? We made lots of good decisions. We also made some decisions that probably cost us pretty big, too.
00:09:12.020 - 00:09:28.408, Speaker B: But overall, this conference is going to be kind of set the stage for the next, I think, generation of our company and what our focus is going to be for this next cycle.
00:09:28.504 - 00:09:55.852, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely wild. And we'll get into the conference at length, which is right around the corner. I went to college in Nashville, so I always loved going back there. I went to Vanderbilt, and, of course, Bitcoin park is there now, too, which is sort of a big center of gravity. It kind of feels like you've now got in the US, at least in particular, New York, Nashville, Austin, sort of elevating above. I see the pub key posters behind you. Yeah, of course.
00:09:56.036 - 00:10:22.070, Speaker B: Yeah, man. I mean, Nashville is a cool city, and I feel like bitcoin just naturally wants to do things that are, like, not, you know, where we. Even if we're not, we like to pretend we're outcasts. So we got to go to, like, you know, the outcast cities. We got to be on the frontier. And so, you know, Nashville, Austin, I think, are good hubs for bitcoin. Puerto Rico is becoming a great hub for bitcoin.
00:10:22.070 - 00:11:09.600, Speaker B: But, yeah, I mean, I think what Rod has done at Bitcoin park has been fantastic. And, you know, the one thing we like to joke about at our company is we've gone through so many ups and downs. We've grown to 100 employees and shrunk down to ten employees, like, three times. So it's like, the number of people that have worked at our company, it's like, okay, a solid 1% of Nashville at this point has been orange filled our employment at our business. Nashville's fantastic, and we loved being there. We are going to keep the conference rotating locations. And, you know, it's really sad also that Nashville elected an ultra woke mayor.
00:11:09.600 - 00:11:30.426, Speaker B: That's just like, you know, we're not even going to be able to get the mayor to come to the conference. And the mayor of Miami is flying all the way to Nashville to attend the conference. So it's just like the juxtapose of, like, you know, the city we just left, the mayor's still coming. The city we're in, the mayor's like, f. You guys, like, won't even phone call.
00:11:30.618 - 00:11:33.050, Speaker A: Yeah. Is that Francis Suarez coming again this year?
00:11:33.170 - 00:11:34.194, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah.
00:11:34.322 - 00:11:54.270, Speaker A: Cool guy. Yeah, really cool guy. All right, we're going to talk. I want to talk more about the conference, and then I'm going to ask David, you've also been in bitcoin markets for a long time. Some thoughts about some of the recent events and also where you think the market is going. But let's stick to the conference. I think the big thing on everybody's mind is that you guys had announced several weeks ago that former President Trump will be attending and speaking at the conference.
00:11:54.270 - 00:12:31.280, Speaker A: And then, of course, I want to ask about the assassination attempt and how that's altered it. But let's just start before. I mean, what has it been like again? You've been evangelizing bitcoin to people all over the country and the world for years now. If you had told me that this five years ago, eight years ago that Donald Trump, the former president RFK junior Vivek, Edward Snowden, would be headlining this year's conference. I would have been shocked to hear that. How, from your perspective, how shocking is it? Was it inevitable? But also, what's it been like working with this team and getting that arranged?
00:12:31.740 - 00:13:32.440, Speaker B: Yeah. So before we move on in the conversation, I just want to say, Alex, you're one of the, I'm not going to say few, but there's a very select group of people that have been at all the bitcoin conferences from the beginning and have seen the transformation. And I just want to say thank you for being a part of that journey. I feel like for those that just have been to one or watch from the sidelines, they think of it as a commercial event, but really to get to where we're at right now, it has always been a movement, and that first conference was imbued with this is a movement. And so at our organization, that's still what it is to us. And so even though it's a big business now, I guess it's, at its core, it's like we're trying to figure out how to take bitcoin forward, and Trump is really, I guess, the embodiment of us driving for that mission. And this has been a grueling process to make this happen.
00:13:32.440 - 00:14:03.046, Speaker B: I mean, I found a tweet, actually, I put a poll out, should we have Donald Trump speak at the Bitcoin conference? And I tweeted that in March. There's a lot of comments. They're like, that'll never happen, or whatever. But I, you know, we've been basically grinding on this. I've been grinding on this almost full time since then. And so we have a core kind of team inside of the company that's been focusing on the execution here. This has been a crazy sales process.
00:14:03.046 - 00:14:25.860, Speaker B: There's been so many components to this. And at the end of the day, for your audience, I'm not a political person. I'm extremely cynical about politics in general. I'm not even allowed to vote in the presidential election. I live in Puerto Rico. But Donald Trump is. It's not about left versus right politics.
00:14:25.860 - 00:15:47.630, Speaker B: As somebody at my company said the other day, it's like orange versus green politics. And Donald Trump is a vessel for us to let the game theory of bitcoin play out. And it has already generated dividends, and it is going to generate dividends that are hard to even comprehend or calculate over the next four years. It's been extremely challenging dealing with the Trump campaign, not because they're hard to work with, they're great people there, but just, like, he's the most powerful person in the world, there's the massive, unbelievable attention on him. Every conversation I have that has anything to do with Donald Trump, people immediately run and go leak it to the media. My inbox is filled every day with five or six different mainstream media companies trying to get some angle, like, the vortex that is Donald Trump is insane. And, you know, every time I've gotten to spend some time with him, you know, he's just basically fielding phone calls, like, nonstop from the world's most powerful and influential people.
00:15:47.630 - 00:16:22.048, Speaker B: And it's like, how do you get prioritization from someone where it's like, hey, Jamie Dimon is on the phone for you. Hey, you know, the head of Pfizer is on the phone. You know, so. So we've really had to sell hard, like, our industry and what it can do for his campaign and administration, and then we've had to deliver on the promises that we've made. And that is the hard part. It's easy. It's easy to say what we can deliver.
00:16:22.048 - 00:16:59.400, Speaker B: But then they're like, you know, the campaign, they're used to bullshit artists all the time trying to sell them shit. So it's like. It's like, okay, we only believe what's real, like, what has been delivered, what's the momentum we're getting. And so if you want it to progress, you gotta show them the money, figuratively. I don't mean literally, but figuratively, and show them the momentum. And thank God bitcoin is truly, if not the, one of the top opportunities for the United States of America. Because if it wasn't, like, we, we never would have been able to take it this far.
00:17:00.020 - 00:17:06.908, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. It's a. I can't imagine the vortex. I love how you describe that. The vortex that is Donald Trump. He's got his own center of gravity.
00:17:07.084 - 00:17:35.070, Speaker B: It's insane. I will make an offhand comment on a Twitter space, and, you know, someone will be listening, though. They'll quote me, that story will be repackaged 20 times, and then I'll wake up the next morning and there's like, a, you know, some mainstream newspaper in China that's like, you know, taken, like, five words that I've said and turned it into, like, 2000 words on, like, Donald Trump's perspective on so and so. And it's just like, what in the world? Like, it's insane.
00:17:35.730 - 00:17:54.720, Speaker A: Yeah, it's wild. What do you, what do you say to critics that say, you know, bitcoin is, is cypherpunk. It's not supposed to be bitcoin. Not necessarily the bitcoin conference that you run, but in general, it's not supposed to be occupied by politicians, by power. Is that, how do you think about that?
00:17:55.740 - 00:19:02.356, Speaker B: They're not occupying it. Like, what are they occupying? Like, just, just because we're making the case to them that they matter and they should embrace it, it doesn't make it so, so, I mean, like, you know, it's like Donald Trump or Joe Biden or whoever have zero influence over how bitcoin works. It works the same today as it did yesterday, as it will tomorrow. So all we are trying to do is take the ideas of bitcoin and the features of bitcoin that already exist, articulate those features in a way that is compatible with their existing philosophy and ideology, and make bitcoin, make the bitcoin opportunity something that they can get excited about also. And, and it's not about, hey, Donald Trump, forget everything you know about everything, okay? And, like, now, like, let me, like, read you the, like, the cypherpunk manifesto. Like, that's not, that's not going to be productive. So it doesn't make what that says not true.
00:19:02.356 - 00:19:28.440, Speaker B: It just, like, that's not going to be productive. So instead, like, let's take all the parts that they don't want to know about or they don't care about. Let's just not focus on those parts, and then let's focus on the parts that are compatible with their, with their message, and that's how we get them to advance the ball forward. And then, you know, we will deal with what comes next as it comes, but we just got to keep the ball moving forward.
00:19:28.900 - 00:20:02.046, Speaker A: Yeah. He has said some really positive things about bitcoin over the last two months. He was at the libertarian party's national convention. He said he would pledge to keep Elizabeth Warren's goons off your bitcoin. Later, he met, yeah, he met with you and others. I saw you had a picture with him, Amanda Fabiano, and was reported bitcoin miners at Mar a Lago. And then he shortly thereafter said that he wanted bitcoin to be made in America and apparently bitcoin mining.
00:20:02.046 - 00:20:21.700, Speaker A: And now you have in the RNC platform itself, defense of self custody of the right to mine bitcoin, opposing a CBDC. What's it been like talking about those policies with them? Because these are effectively national policies related to bitcoin and I dare say seem like, pretty good ones.
00:20:22.040 - 00:20:54.018, Speaker B: Yeah. No, I mean, again, I think, first off, I just want to point out to your audience that, like, you know, bitcoin doesn't happen on its own. It happens because the people who are part of bitcoin, they go and make it happen. And so, like, you know, we like to say, hey, like game theory, this is going to all happen. Correct. But, like, we're not, like, victims of waiting for someone to come to some idea on their own. Like, we have the capacity to go out and plant those seeds and nurture them and grow them.
00:20:54.018 - 00:22:25.186, Speaker B: And I have been shocked to discover over time the impact that a very, very small number of people can have on the broader landscape if they have absolute alignment and focus and attention on something like the force multiplying impact that a couple hundred people with resources can have is unbelievable. And so I would challenge the people listening to this and people in the community broadly do not feel like you are just a passive observer of what's happening. Like, ten donors coming in with $844,000 a pop, which is a lot of money, but in the scheme of things, 844,000, it's kind of nothing. Also, like, ten donors can be the difference between the democratic party wanting to ban bitcoin and the Democratic Party deciding, oh, we like it because it's money for the unbanked and for immigrants, money and energy applied in a very targeted fashion can just create unbelievable amounts of leverage. So just, like, feel empowered to go do something. And with Trump, I'm not the only person who's been affecting them. The ingredients were there for this to happen.
00:22:25.186 - 00:23:12.560, Speaker B: The environment. The stage was set, let's say. But it's a very small number of people that have moved this needle forward. And then from that kind of initial traction, we were able to snowball each kind of, let's say, success into the next success into the next success. Oh, wow. I got a great response in Mar a Lago saying, I'm the crypto president and I like NFts to, okay, you know what? Let's pardon Ross Ulbricht and say we're going to protect custody to, wow, this got an incredible response. Like, you know, like, how does this integrate into our economy? Okay, let's get, let's bring in the domestic miners and talk about how this is going to affect, you know, energy abundance and, you know, investing into America's energy infrastructure.
00:23:12.560 - 00:23:48.238, Speaker B: Oh, wow. I love this stuff. Okay, well, like, and so you just keep kind of snowballing the effect and, you know, the next dominoes that have like, you know, the next few dominoes to come have already kind of dropped a. So, you know, the people's awareness of the dominoes dropping is a little bit, is lagging to them actually dropping. And so, like, I have a good sense of, like, at least right now where we're at and where this is going. And, like, I think that this is going to get massive. Massive.
00:23:48.238 - 00:25:12.520, Speaker B: And I think that the, what's been promised so far is nothing compared to what will come. I think that, like, you know, what, you know, to your question of what's changed post assassination attempt, which, I mean, what an insane, insane situation. I was watching, actually, his speech live when it happened. I was like, oh, fuck, you know, there's so many things that could be said about it. But, like, I think just in a practical sense, what's changed is that Donald Trump went from the likely president in a bitter competition to, I think, now is widely seen as a landslide victory for the president, where he's going to take the House and Senate with him, and he's going to go into office with a mandate and control of all branches of government and is going to be in the shot collar position to pass transformational policy change in America on issues that are a priority to him. And this issue is a priority to him. And so that is a very special set of circumstances that could not be planned, that have set up kind of a perfect storm for us to achieve things that maybe we thought were 20 or 30 years away from being able to be achieved.
00:25:12.520 - 00:26:44.430, Speaker B: And I think the knock on second order and tertiary effects of, you know, success from these next dominoes to drop to come will result in a massive acceleration of everything at a pace that even, you know, I'm bullish. I tweeted this the other day, like, I'm bullish, and, like, I'm definitely not bullish enough. Like, the, the pace, just as a hypothetical, and this is a purely hypothetical statement, if the United States came out and said, we're establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve, and we are going to have x number of bitcoin that we're going to hold as a strategic asset of the nation, the response that that would generate in every executive branch in every country in the world, in every central bank in every country in the world, in every sovereign wealth fund in every country, I mean, the, it's not like people are just going to sit around and wait for it to happen before they act. They're going to reposition themselves based on this new information quickly. Maybe not all of them, maybe just a few of them will do it quickly, but all we need is a few of them. And then. And then it's just like, you know, the dominoes, they just accelerate.
00:26:45.130 - 00:27:00.962, Speaker A: It is. It's like the game theory, really, at the nation state level is quite simple in my mind. Right. I mean, if you. If you. If the United States were to buy bitcoin or hold bitcoin, um, they could simply not sell the bitcoin they already have. Maybe be a good start.
00:27:00.962 - 00:27:11.426, Speaker A: Um, you can imagine friend and foe, uh, saying, wait a sec, maybe we should do the same. Right. It's not. Not even just. Yeah, yeah. It's. It's a wild situation.
00:27:11.426 - 00:27:18.410, Speaker A: Do you think that's where this is escalating towards? Because it. Yeah, there's a lot of rumors going around of. Of things like this, given what's happened.
00:27:18.450 - 00:27:55.190, Speaker B: Well, the. On the, on the nation state level of this type of reaction. Yes, absolutely. You know, I've heard wild things. I was heard wild things earlier this year coming out of China. And then, you know, recently, I've heard like, that they're already making moves as a direct response to Donald Trump's policy position on bitcoin. And so, you know it when the president says things like, hey, we got to dominate bitcoin or otherwise the Chinese are going to dominate it, and we got to make sure that they don't dominate it.
00:27:55.490 - 00:27:56.162, Speaker A: Right.
00:27:56.306 - 00:28:31.894, Speaker B: There's nothing more powerful you could possibly say to the Chinese to make the Chinese be like, we got to go get into bitcoin right away as fast as possible. Donald Trump's trying to get. Keep us out. Like, that's the most effective sales pitch that there is. So, yeah, it's like, if we want to get the China to Yolo into bitcoin, all we got to do is say we're stopping them. Get a certain person to say we're stopping them from yoloing into bitcoin. And what's also interesting about bitcoin that I think is unique to it, is it would be a little bit different if this was bitcoin was an american phenomenon.
00:28:31.894 - 00:29:17.192, Speaker B: And so, yeah, we got Donald Trump to embrace it, but all the bitcoiners are in America, and all these other nations are like, you know, fuck that. It's not an american phenomenon. It's a global phenomenon. And in the same way that, like, we've infiltrated the inner ranks of, you know, both political parties in the United States, bitcoiners have infiltrated the ranks of every political party on every nation in the planet. You know, I'm hearing from bitcoiners that are in the inner circles of multiple presidents that are out there of huge nations, and they're aligned with us. So it's not like we're out there like, cold selling. We got inside guys and every executive branch in the world who are saying, hey, guys, we really need to reassess our position really quickly.
00:29:17.192 - 00:30:09.810, Speaker B: Look at what's happening in America. And so the aligned interest component of this really accelerates. It really is our super weapon of, of, you know, being able to craft our message hundreds of different, different ways so that it is maximally effective to the person. We need to hear it. So, yeah, on top of it, because it's like, if we act together in unison, the price of bitcoin is going to the fucking moon. I mean, this is the type of when people say, what's going to send bitcoin to a million dollars bitcoin, this is what sends it to a million dollars bitcoin. So it's like, okay, well, everyone's financially aligned, that, like, you know, success here is good for everyone.
00:30:09.970 - 00:30:28.600, Speaker A: So, yeah, conference is going to be. Yeah, it is exciting. How big do you think the conference is going to be? I mean, how is it going to be? Like, overwhelming? Because I've been on Broadway in Nashville many times. Is it going to be a legion of, you know, 35,000 bitcoiners? Going, going.
00:30:30.300 - 00:30:53.546, Speaker B: It'Ll be like 20,000 people. So it'll be just, if you take out, like, the music festival from. From 2022, that was like 22,000 people. I think we had 4000 people who just came to the music festival. So it was 26,000 total. So this will be just smaller than 2022. You know, when I was mentioning earlier, like, okay, we went to Nashville, we mixed it up.
00:30:53.546 - 00:31:27.000, Speaker B: Like, what was that? What did that cost us? Looking at the data, like, it probably cost us, like, a good number of people, but that's okay. There's a lot of new people that are going to be at this event and, yeah, like, it's going to feel. It'll feel overwhelming. But, you know, we've learned a lot of things over at our event experience, and so I feel like this will be a much better user experience than 2022 was and comparable in number of people.
00:31:27.580 - 00:32:14.180, Speaker A: Yeah. Our mutual friend Mike Germano from Bitcoin magazine gave a great talk at the microstrategy conference that I saw about bitcoin's brand, and I just wanted to sort of echo your point about the global nature of it. You've got all these pieces. These nodes on this network, the David Baileys and the Michael Saylors and the whomever else is right out here, all sort of pushing for bitcoin in different ways, but to the same goal. How important, in your mind has been? Because this, to me, seems like what is really the core of, at least Bitcoin magazine, one of your businesses, is empowering these various nodes. How diverse is the bitcoin community opinion? The panelists? The speaker is going to be at, you know, inside the big tent. That is bitcoin at the conference, in your mind?
00:32:14.220 - 00:32:43.080, Speaker B: Oh, massive. And, I mean, we have hardcore progressives. We have people who hate Donald Trump. We have, you know, cypherbunks who are anti the entire political establishment, and they're, you know, vomiting that we're having a politician come to the conference. You know, we're gonna have people in ski masks. We're gonna have to figure out the ski mask situation. That might be a little bit of a sensitive issue this year, but, I mean, the constituency is so broad for bitcoin.
00:32:43.080 - 00:33:38.234, Speaker B: It's really such an interesting cross section, probably the most interesting cross section of any community in the world, to be honest. And when we're working these angles on developing, let's say, opportunities for the bitcoin network at large, we're on the phone talking to billionaires of completely different feathers and completely different parts of the country, different interests, different allegiances, etcetera, who would never talk to us in a million years. We couldn't get on the phone with them. Except when it comes to bitcoin, it's like, okay, again, this alignment that exists. And so it's like, hey, person number x, we need you to work your Rolodex and find y for us so that we can do z in this situation. And they're like, okay, I'm on it. And so it's like, where else do you get that type of coordination? It just doesn't exist.
00:33:38.234 - 00:33:38.690, Speaker B: You know?
00:33:38.730 - 00:33:39.790, Speaker A: So not really.
00:33:40.970 - 00:33:55.962, Speaker B: So I just feel like, you know, as I've become. So through this process, I'm already orange pilled, but I feel like I've been, like, doubly orange pilled. That there's just. There's no way to defeat. Defeat. Defeat us. Like, we're.
00:33:55.962 - 00:34:26.638, Speaker B: We are completely decentralized and distributed. There is no hydra to kill. Yet, simultaneously, the body works together in coordination with this kind of great alignment, and there's really no one who is more than one hop away from a bitcoiner. Basically, every person on the planet knows somebody who loves bitcoin. So this hive mind that we've created, I just don't see how it can be stopped. We're so much more powerful than the nationalism of a country. We're so much more.
00:34:26.638 - 00:35:24.272, Speaker B: I mean, it's like our money, in the same way that our money is the best money on the planet, like, the ideology and alignment of our community is equally as strong and hardened comparative to anyone else's. So, like, I feel like, you know, we are a religious faction that's growing at triple digit percentages year over year that, you know, as our religion spreads, our financial resources expand equally. And so it's just like, I mean, how do you beat that? So, I don't know. I feel like hyper bitcoinization is coming much faster than people think. And I think that the institutions and the nation states that we thought would be completely eliminated, they're going to be part of that process, and there's going to be ones that are not going to make the jump. And then, you know, long term, who knows? What happens is kind of like, newspapers. Think about, like, newspapers.
00:35:24.272 - 00:36:24.930, Speaker B: It's like, okay, most newspapers weren't able to make the jump to digital. Some newspapers were able to make the jump, and they've really increased maybe their influence. The New York Times or the Washington Post have increased their influence in that transition. Will they be able to maintain that influence, you know, 50 years from now? Maybe that's a, you know, that's a tougher challenge. But, like, I think that our trajectory is going to be similar in the sense, like, there are going to be large financial institutions and countries that come along on this transition, or they're early and, you know, they're going to have a major role to play in, like, this kind of next phase. And, you know, in a broader sense, who knows where this exactly looks like, you know, 50 years, 100 years from now? But, like, I think change is going to happen much faster than people think. You only need a couple big governments, countries that are aligned.
00:36:24.930 - 00:36:49.482, Speaker B: Think about, again, the alignment factor we're talking about. Wait until the president of the United States is part of that alignment, that super alignment that has occurred. And it's like someone can pick up the phone and call Trump and say, trump, I need you to open up your Rolodex and make X or y or z happen so that we can spread bitcoin to this other, this other nation. Like, dude, it's just, it's, it's, uh, crazy. It's crazy.
00:36:49.586 - 00:37:16.852, Speaker A: Yeah. I can't believe the level that it's come to um, all right, david, I know you're busy. The conference is right around the corner. Um, so just a couple, couple more quick questions, a little bit more short term focus. You had tweeted about, uh, mount Gox coins. You know, this is on a lot of people's minds because we've started to see these coins finally be distributed to these exchanges like Kraken and bit stamp and whatever else. You made the point that funds like yours, UtxO management, have been looking at and trying to buy these claims for a long time.
00:37:16.852 - 00:37:44.380, Speaker A: As one of the reasons why you. Yeah, as one of the reasons why you don't think there'll be a lot of selling, is that your view, broadly, that Gox is going to be mostly hodled and not saddled? And also, is it just kind of coincidence or is it just something beautiful that these overhangs, whether Mount Gox or the other bankruptcies, appear to be sort of clearing right into this, you know, new bullish phase?
00:37:45.200 - 00:38:43.432, Speaker B: Yeah, dude. I mean, I feel like the, it's divine intervention between Trump being kept alive, you know, the, the biggest overhangs of bitcoin and, you know, a decade being cleared, a halving occurring, the spot ETF being approved. You know, we're about to have $18 billion or something like that in FTX, cash claims paid out. Like, you know, it's just, it's, everything is aligned for, for something really special to happen this next cycle. And, you know, to, to the point about the claims specifically, I think someone linked me to a thread you wrote. I thought your thread was, was beautifully done and very smart. I just, I think that, like, the selling that is going to occur from these coins, like a lot of people who've been buying them, they're institutions that were just trying to turn, they already had a bitcoin position.
00:38:43.432 - 00:39:12.170, Speaker B: They're trying to turn one bitcoin into 1.1 bitcoin. And their time preference was such that, like, hey, that trade made sense because they're just not planning on selling the coin. So, and so I think, like, those buyers are just going to hold, and those are some big buyers, and institutions like value plays like that. So there's a very heavy weight of institutions in this mixed. And, and then I think those that are maybe that we're running an arb strategy and, like, maybe they are going to sell. They're going to sell intelligently.
00:39:12.170 - 00:39:36.020, Speaker B: It's different, in my opinion, than like, a recent bankruptcy of a retail platform where the users get the coins and they're like, I've been waiting for this money to pay my mortgage and I need to sell now. And it's just like mass sells. They're going to be very. I think maybe they've already sold. Maybe they've already hedged out the position. Totally. And sophisticated players are going to be smart about what they do.
00:39:36.020 - 00:40:21.618, Speaker B: And I think there will be some amount of users that kept their claims, got paid out and, hey, want to realize some returns. But, like, Brian Estes, who's a big claim buyer, made the point. He's like, I'm not sure the amount of selling of these coins is going to exceed the amount of cash that was distributed. Like, you know, so I think it's kind of a. I think the, the net effect is like, it's not going to be a big deal. And then, like, the macro view on the situation is like, this was the number one fud factor for a decade and we just cleared it like nothing. And so, like, wow.
00:40:21.618 - 00:40:24.230, Speaker B: Like that. That's what's bullish out of all this.
00:40:24.620 - 00:40:35.172, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Well, I'm going to let you go because I know your phone is ringing. David, I cannot wait to see you and everyone else in Nashville. It's going to be quite a scene. They always are. That. You're right.
00:40:35.172 - 00:40:57.824, Speaker A: They've been great every time. And I just. It was that one year, we couldn't do it in 2020 because of COVID but then 21 was that blowout out in Wynwood in Miami. That was just an absolute crazy one that I think at the time was the largest event in the world during COVID so. And they've been great ever since. And this is. You're taking it to new heights, David, so thank you for that.
00:40:57.824 - 00:40:58.640, Speaker A: I can't wait.
00:40:58.720 - 00:41:25.990, Speaker B: This is going to be, like, 2021. Like, this is going to be the next 2021 experience. And, yeah, I'm excited to see you there. I'm excited to open a new chapter in bitcoin history. And I think for any of your listeners that are on the fence about coming, you know, what do you got to lose? As Donald Trump would say, what do you got to lose? I'll see you in Nashville.
00:41:26.290 - 00:41:33.690, Speaker A: All right. David Bailey, founder, CEO of BTC Inc, Bitcoin magazine, Utxo Management and others. Thank you so much, David.
