As I said, jameson Lopp, CTO and co founder of Casa, is our guest.
00:01:05.134 - 00:01:06.550, Speaker B: We're going to talk privacy, bitcoin.
00:01:06.582 - 00:01:16.238, Speaker A: Bitcoin. Culture, technology, a bunch of interesting stuff. And we'll check in with our good friend Bim Netabeebe from Galaxy trading, as always, to talk markets and macro. Before we get to all of that.
00:01:16.246 - 00:01:18.190, Speaker B: I need to remind you, please refer to link to disclaimer in the podcast.

00:01:28.814 - 00:01:29.532, Speaker C: We're back.
00:01:29.678 - 00:01:43.204, Speaker B: We're still here. It's the new year and a lot of great stories to tell. It's been pretty exciting. Galaxy Brains, 2024. I'm excited about it. Yeah. And I mean, markets have been wild.
00:01:43.204 - 00:02:13.358, Speaker B: The ETF's are in play now we got whole new market mechanics and dynamics at play. Lots of heavy trading between three and 04:00 p.m. New York time. Now, when all the ETF's fix and do their trading, it's getting exciting. And also, it's getting cold out here. I mean, am I getting weak? Are we all getting weak? You get one cold snap in the US and everyone loses it. I thought, isn't it winter? No, you just forget every year how bad it is every year at this time in New York.
00:02:13.358 - 00:02:20.326, Speaker B: It's windy, it's cold. And then everybody gets depressed for a few months, and then we get better and we forget, and we're like, oh.
00:02:20.350 - 00:02:21.150, Speaker D: New York's great again.
00:02:21.222 - 00:02:44.710, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm in New York right now recording. But if you listen to this, on Thursday or Friday, I'll be in Nashville at Bitcoin park for the mining site, which will be a lot of fun. But they were absolutely decimated by the cold. The midwest in general. Nashville, as I say, this is zero degrees fahrenheit crazy, full ground stop at the airport stuff. It's like, I guess, you know, it's like you're not prepared for it. If you're like, in the south, you know, they don't have, like.
00:02:44.710 - 00:02:50.246, Speaker B: It's not like, you know, I'm from Massachusetts originally. You're a vermonter. Like, we got plenty of snow piles. People are used to that thing.
00:02:50.310 - 00:02:50.886, Speaker A: That's exciting, though.
00:02:50.910 - 00:02:51.470, Speaker B: Bitcoin park.
00:02:51.502 - 00:02:51.806, Speaker C: You haven't.
00:02:51.830 - 00:02:54.670, Speaker B: You've been. You went like six, four. I've gone plenty of times.
00:02:54.742 - 00:02:54.974, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:02:55.014 - 00:03:04.590, Speaker B: Big fan. Yeah, it's the, like, sort of bitcoin third place in Nashville. It's also. Nashville will host bitcoin 2024, Bitcoin magazines conference this year.
00:03:04.622 - 00:03:06.394, Speaker D: Now I guess it's 2024.
00:03:06.774 - 00:03:17.182, Speaker B: And so Bitcoin park, real Nexus. In some ways, it's the pub key of Nashville. Or pub key is the bitcoin park of New York. Yeah, absolutely. These things are sprouting up all over the world. The movement is real.
00:03:17.238 - 00:03:17.686, Speaker E: That's cool.
00:03:17.750 - 00:03:26.346, Speaker B: Let's hop right into it with our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brainstorm.
00:03:26.346 - 00:03:27.582, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:03:27.718 - 00:03:43.674, Speaker B: It's been an exciting week. When we recorded last week, we recorded right after the bitcoin ETF's were approved. Yup. But now we're recording on Wednesday, and they've traded for three full trading days. Thursday, Friday, Tuesday. Monday was a holiday in the United States. The markets were closed.
00:03:44.334 - 00:03:45.262, Speaker D: Let's get right to it.
00:03:45.278 - 00:03:48.674, Speaker B: I mean, what are your takes so far on the ETF complex?
00:03:49.014 - 00:04:42.602, Speaker C: I think the total flows into the product are anemic at this point. I think the figures are. As of yesterday, there was $800 million of net inflows into the ETF's, of which grayscale had 1.8 yards that were outflows. And I think a lot of the inflows of the net inflows were a function of people just exchanging bitcoin or some other exposure or some other bitcoin related exposure into the ETF. And so high level, I think the net amount of new money that entered the space because of the ETF is a lot smaller than people think. And I worry from the standpoint that there aren't too many near term catalysts for bitcoin.
00:04:42.602 - 00:04:44.810, Speaker C: The havening is a long ways away.
00:04:44.922 - 00:04:45.682, Speaker D: Three months or so.
00:04:45.698 - 00:05:45.506, Speaker C: Yeah. The ETH ETF is probably way, way longer away. And macro conditions were about as good as they could have possibly been for the ETF launch. Bond yields were at their dead lows, stocks were at the dead highs, and that's starting to turn a little bit now. And so I see a market that has spent the last year, mainly the last six months, bidding up bitcoin and bitcoin related exposure in anticipation of this ETF bringing in new inflows, and we aren't really getting those inflows. I see an asset right now that's basically unchanged on the year we started the year basically at this exact same level. And I think there are going to be a lot of folks that have bought in the run higher than here, basically, that are going to be underwater, and a lot of folks that are probably going to be less enthusiastic about bitcoin because it's not going to have the same volume profile right now.
00:05:45.506 - 00:06:21.918, Speaker C: You've taken out a lot of the speculative positioning. There's no near term catalyst. I don't see a scenario where I'm Fomo chasing bitcoin at the dead highs, whereas you got paid to do that for the last six months. You bought the highs at any point in the last six months, and then it went higher. And then it went higher. Eventually you might have been in some short term pain, but that is not the case anymore. And the way I think about Grayscale is at the start of this, they were sitting around $29 billion in assets, and the ETF approval basically unlocked $29 billion of supply.
00:06:21.918 - 00:06:48.020, Speaker C: Now, a lot of that is hedged, et cetera. But at its core, this was the largest supply event of Q one. It wasn't a demand event, not if you're thinking about it from a near term perspective. But there's a ton of supply that just got unlocked. And so from a demand supply perspective, it looks imbalanced to me still here with grayscale having 25 plus billion dollars in Aum at current levels.
00:06:48.052 - 00:06:48.984, Speaker E: Yup, yup.
00:06:49.284 - 00:07:20.734, Speaker C: And I think this is a market that has a relatively short attention span. And while bitcoin was a hot narrative around ETF launch. That's not to say that it's going to be on people's minds or the forefront of their trading next week. You still have these huge other macro things going on. Gilts moved 20 basis points today. Stocks are all, there's a lot of exciting stuff happening. And so it's going to be tough for bitcoin to hold attention.
00:07:20.734 - 00:07:59.570, Speaker C: But to those of us that are in crypto native world, I think it might mean you see a little bit more focus on alts or other parts of the crypto ecosystem and other ways to engage and make money. But in terms of bitcoin itself, I'm not that constructive here. There are a lot of mixed views out there. But I've been basically bullish since last year, the start of last year, let alone, you know, and right now I'm cautious at best. Yeah, I think that's fair, if not outright bearish.
00:07:59.642 - 00:08:32.216, Speaker B: I think that's fair in the near term, but big picture. Yeah, for sure. I mean, you remain a long term bitcoin bull. Just to clarify for anyone who, I don't think anyone who listens to this show would question that. Yeah, but I agree, and I've been saying too, that I think months three to six, three to twelve matter a lot more for the ETF complex than months one to three because as we've repeatedly hammered home, the primary net new market for these products is the advisors and wealth management channel.
00:08:32.280 - 00:08:32.568, Speaker C: Correct.
00:08:32.616 - 00:09:20.220, Speaker B: And as far as I can tell, none of them are turning it on yet. Many of them need to wait for a month or more just for track record to add one to their platform. So I want to also be cautious to people reading too much into early Aum and volume numbers because again, pretty much the only people that can trade this right now is retail investors. And they, I mean, some have disagreed with me on this, Fred Krueger disagrees with me on the statement, but that retails had access to this for years, whether through Coinbase and River and cash app or through the trust before they converted or through equities that are linked to bitcoin. They've had plenty of ways. And the real platforms that don't are the bank and broker dealer affiliated advisors, and they're not here yet. Yeah.
00:09:20.220 - 00:09:27.452, Speaker B: So in the absence of that net new demand, which I still view as net new, we've just got sort of like retail out here so far.
00:09:27.508 - 00:09:27.868, Speaker D: Right.
00:09:27.956 - 00:09:32.644, Speaker B: And a lot of inorganic flow from these issuers as well.
00:09:32.764 - 00:09:47.150, Speaker C: No, I completely agree with that. And I think the other thing to note is that this is a marginal security now and you can get leverage on bitcoin a lot easier if your.
00:09:47.182 - 00:09:48.414, Speaker B: Retail through the ETF's.
00:09:48.454 - 00:10:06.030, Speaker C: Through the ETF, right. And so same way you could buy other stocks on leverage and margin. It's going to really allow people to kind of lever up if they want to in a relatively cheap way. You're going to pay like sofa plus, like.
00:10:06.102 - 00:10:07.614, Speaker B: So that can be constructive.
00:10:07.774 - 00:10:22.474, Speaker C: That is going to be constructive over the long run. But just right here, right now, it's tough to think that you're going to just break out to new highs in the next two months. Totally localized.
00:10:22.514 - 00:10:30.514, Speaker B: All right. You mentioned macro environment has shifted a little bit. I saw some fed speak previously. Dovish, was it Waller?
00:10:30.594 - 00:10:31.706, Speaker D: Waller in particular.
00:10:31.850 - 00:11:43.584, Speaker C: Waller in particular yesterday was expected to be a little bit more dovish on the dovish side of things. However, he came out with a message that basically said that rate cuts need to be more gradual and there's no need to be as aggressive as they have been in the past because of the balance dynamics in terms of growth and the employment picture. If employment was collapsing and falling off a cliff while inflation was coming down this aggressively, then you would need to cut. But this is a historically tight labor market and growth is still okay and you've got a fiscal impulse that's still fairly robust and we're talking about more tax cuts now and stuff. And so I think what he reiterated was that the cup pricing in the market was a little too aggressive and that you didn't quite go into this, but we've had a pretty dramatic easing in financial conditions over the past two, three months with stocks ripping to fresh highs and bond yields collapse, mortgage rates coming down. And so there is some kind of inflationary effect to that at some point. And overall, the economy's still in a super healthy spot.
00:11:43.584 - 00:12:08.286, Speaker C: And so I think the Fed is trying to take a bit more of a measured approach to the rate cut path and policy. And it's not only been domestic, but you had like six or seven different Fed speakers come out, ECB speakers come out last night that also reiterated similar messaging. And you had a surprise in UK data as well. To the upside. And God forbid, like oil goes higher, right?
00:12:08.310 - 00:12:11.862, Speaker B: Like we live in a, with the various straits and channels and canals.
00:12:11.998 - 00:13:02.286, Speaker C: We live in a post pandemic world, right, with tons of geopolitical risk like everywhere. And so, you know, to go back to, you know, zero interest rates or negative interest rates in the case of Europe is a very tough, you know, thing to swallow. And honestly, I don't think it's feasible in the world we live in right now. And so I think what basically happened is people's expectations of where terminal rates are going to be domestically and abroad have started to come up. And we've seen us fixed income sell off to about 20 basis points depending on what part of the curve you look at. You've had similar moves in Europe in the ECB curve and in the UK curve as well. And so, yeah, I just think that the world was priced to perfection and now it's starting to acknowledge the two sided risks to inflation.
00:13:02.390 - 00:13:05.134, Speaker B: Markets are still pricing some cuts this year.
00:13:05.214 - 00:13:06.014, Speaker C: Tremendous amount.
00:13:06.094 - 00:13:12.206, Speaker B: Right. Was that wrong to. May have looked at the panel wrong, but like, I mean, like 160 basis points.
00:13:12.350 - 00:13:14.782, Speaker C: Yeah, 150, give or take. Whatever.
00:13:14.838 - 00:13:16.150, Speaker B: Yeah, that still seems a lot.
00:13:16.182 - 00:13:24.806, Speaker C: So did they, especially depending on the pace, though, if they're going 50 at a time, that's three. Right. But if they're going 25 and 50, like, that's what.
00:13:24.870 - 00:13:41.290, Speaker B: Right. So those we. I don't know how to say this as a rates person. They repriced higher or the cuts reduced, came in a little bit reduced from where they. So they had been really aggressive even more than that. Now we're back a little, but still forecasting further easing this year. The market.
00:13:41.402 - 00:13:54.330, Speaker C: Correct. And that's just largely based on the fact that inflation has moved much closer to target. It's not at target, but if your mandate is full employment and inflation, because.
00:13:54.362 - 00:14:11.842, Speaker B: Just like they don't want to miss, like have inflation miss or beat to the upside, they don't want to miss to the downside and end up with deflation. So this is part of the soft landing, like trying to. They want to accelerate the rates or reduce them slowly right into their 2% narrative. Yes, if they can, but.
00:14:11.898 - 00:14:20.138, Speaker C: If they can. But at the same time, it's like we've had this discussion before, it's like absolute prices are up like 20 plus percent.
00:14:20.306 - 00:14:21.394, Speaker B: Yeah, those aren't coming back.
00:14:21.474 - 00:14:52.672, Speaker C: That's just not coming back. And they're still focused on this rate of growth or rate of change of prices. And so that's kind of a debate. But overall, the kind of things I'm monitoring are like, savings balances are starting to come off. Like the excess balances from the pandemic have started to get eaten into. You've seen a pickup in credit card default rates and stuff and a lot of the soft data indicators.
00:14:52.768 - 00:15:10.312, Speaker B: Yeah, I saw somebody saying that online. I don't want to say the platforms, but the big online ad sellers, the big tech companies, the search engine giants that do this, are laying off huge swaths of their ad teams and that this has also historically been a leading indicator of a downturn in the economy, ad spending.
00:15:10.448 - 00:15:27.864, Speaker C: No, no, that's fine. There's lots of things like that that are saying you're headed towards a slowdown. And so basically the fed's being like, rates are probably too restrictive in the context of what we're seeing in the future on a forward indicator basis.
00:15:27.944 - 00:15:29.512, Speaker B: Slow down. Yes, yes.
00:15:29.648 - 00:15:38.502, Speaker C: And it's like, I agree with them. The rates are probably too high by like 100, 150 basis points. But at the same time, like, well.
00:15:38.518 - 00:15:46.414, Speaker B: There'S no sense in over cutting too soon. You can always cut more. That's what's great about having brought it up this high. Exactly. You can cut these points tomorrow if they need to.
00:15:46.454 - 00:15:46.990, Speaker C: If they need to.
00:15:47.022 - 00:15:49.470, Speaker B: So start a little lower and slower.
00:15:49.542 - 00:16:09.982, Speaker C: It's like you have, you don't have like the world blowing up. Right. Yeah. And, you know, it's also, I mean, the big thing though is like they're gonna, the fiscal issues are gonna hit them at some point. The math is just going to catch up with it. And I'm, I mean, that, that's, and then that's really when I think, you know, bitcoin gets, this is one of.
00:16:09.998 - 00:16:24.470, Speaker B: The most positive things to come out of the high rate environment in my mind is the. Finally some awareness, some true awareness renewed, much more serious discussion, not just from like gold, you know, gold bugs and long term, you know, everyday people.
00:16:24.502 - 00:16:24.670, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:16:24.702 - 00:16:41.374, Speaker B: About the cost of the national debt and the fiscal spending on, on this. And high rates, of course, increase service costs of the debt. And so it's ra, it's made people really realize, like, wait a second, we're gonna be spending 15, 2030, 50% under some future of our entire budget just servicing the debt.
00:16:41.414 - 00:16:41.926, Speaker D: Right.
00:16:42.070 - 00:16:46.342, Speaker B: It's like you pay your mortgage every month and you don't even take anything off the principal.
00:16:46.438 - 00:17:15.054, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, if our only voters were like between the ages of like 15 and like 30, the world would look totally different. And the care about the fiscal stuff, like you couldn't kick the can down the road. Cause you're kicking it to these two to yourself. And that's like, why? I mean, I'm just like, like, as a, you know, I'm not young anymore. I'm almost 30. But like, I'm like thinking about like 15 years from now, 30 years from now.
00:17:15.054 - 00:17:59.944, Speaker C: The fiscal picture is just abhorrent. And I think at some point, like the market is gonna force the government's hand with this stuff. And bitcoin is kind of one of those barometers on the barometers, because ultimately it comes down to, like, is the dollar the reserve currency? Is there another alternative to it? Like, will markets really push on that? If people are like, I'm not buying 30 year debt anymore. The central bank's going to have to buy it all. I'm not touching it because they're not going to pay it, then that'd be a moment of reckoning. And that's when you'd expect bitcoin to go up. And also, they're going to start expanding the balance sheet pretty soon with the end of QT and then eventual resumption of QE.
00:17:59.944 - 00:18:04.884, Speaker C: And that's going to be a pretty huge upside catalyst for bitcoin, but it's just going to take time.
00:18:04.924 - 00:18:13.652, Speaker B: Yeah, that still looks bad. The long term fiscal and debt servicing picture still constructive there. That's part of bitcoin long term value proposition.
00:18:13.708 - 00:18:21.612, Speaker C: The market was only focused on trading that bitcoin would be at the moon. I don't even know what value it would have.
00:18:21.668 - 00:18:21.932, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:18:21.988 - 00:18:27.184, Speaker B: Like Bim Netabee from Galaxy Trading, my friend. As always, thank you for coming on, Galaxy Brains.
00:18:28.204 - 00:18:34.082, Speaker D: Let's go now to our guest, Jameson Lopp, CTO of Casa. Jameson, thank you so much for coming on, Galaxy Brains.
00:18:34.218 - 00:18:35.414, Speaker E: Great to be here.
00:18:37.394 - 00:19:01.564, Speaker D: I think I've been following your work for quite some time. I know our audience has as well. I've got some interesting topics that I want to talk with Jamison about, but before we do that, I would love if. Jameson, if you could share some of your background. And I'll just prime this. You're the co founder and CTO of Casa a bitcoin, what do we call it? Collaborative custody. A self custody company.
00:19:01.564 - 00:19:10.440, Speaker D: But you've been working in bitcoin for a long time. Just, I'd love if you could introduce yourself and tell our audience a little bit about your background in the space.
00:19:10.592 - 00:20:31.114, Speaker E: Yeah. So I got interested in bitcoin in 2012, spent my first year just meandering around, trying to understand it better. Launched a fork of bitcoin core in 2014. And that was not a network fork, just a software fork, where I was adding a bunch of analytics and instrumentation so that we could better understand what was going on inside of bitcoin node. And that project was called Satoshi. And I considered that a success because it was referred to by a number of developers over the years when making arguments about potential changes to the protocol. I was then lucky enough to go full time in 2015, and I spent the next three years working on infrastructure at Bitgo, where I was basically responsible for all of the indexing, making sure that our databases were up to date with the latest transactions and balances for wallets, our clients managing our send queues, and in general, just trying to keep a lot of the operational backend up and running smoothly.
00:20:31.114 - 00:22:15.074, Speaker E: It was then a very small pivot for me in 2018 to go to Casa, where we were using similar aspects of the protocols, specifically multisignature functionality, so that you can have a wallet where you have multiple keys that are distributed around to give you much higher levels of robustness and security. Bitgo is really doing that for enterprises, helping exchanges and payment processors secure their wallets, and Kasa really focuses on helping individuals achieve really high levels of security. So really what Casa does is we're like a concierge security consultation service, where we offer a very user friendly mobile app that pairs with various hardware devices that keep your keys offline, secure, distributed in multiple locations. And we also offer a really high level of customer service to help people whenever anything goes wrong, if they're having problems with the technology, or just to advise them on making decisions of trade offs between convenience and security and their own self custody setup. So Kasa has been going strong for, I guess, almost six years now, and so far so good. We've actually expanded and rolled out support for Ethereum and some of the top stable coins recently as a result of demand from our clients, who are holding assets in a number of different protocols.
00:22:16.814 - 00:22:38.800, Speaker D: Yeah, Casa is a great, great product. I've used it for a while, so I can say that. Talk to me, Jamison, about multisig in general. This is a. And maybe the Ethereum point is an interesting one to segue into as well, because multisig is native on bitcoin, but not on Ethereum. But before we get into that, what is the. I don't want to say the benefit.
00:22:38.800 - 00:22:45.204, Speaker D: I think that's pretty clear what the benefit of, but maybe you could explain what multisig is and why it's so revolutionary when it comes to digital assets.
00:22:45.744 - 00:23:28.404, Speaker E: I kind of describe a few different tiers of ownership of crypto assets. Tier zero is you're a no coiner, you don't have any crypto assets. That's the vast majority of the world today. Tier one is you own ious for these assets. And what I mean there is, you've gone to an exchange or a broker, you've hooked it up to your bank account, otherwise funded your account, and you've purchased these assets. However, the actual keys to those assets are held by the third party custodian. So at any point in time, a number of things could go wrong, and you could be unable to access those assets.
00:23:28.404 - 00:24:07.570, Speaker E: Next tier is taking self custody. And the vast majority of people who take self custody and they withdraw those assets from the exchange, they generally put them into a single signature wallet. If you put that into what's called a hot wallet, where the actual key is on your computer or your phone or whatever, that's better than having the key with a third party. But it's not great because the key is still potentially exposed to hackers, malicious software. So on. The next step beyond that is putting those keys on a dedicated hardware device. Trezor Ledger, cold card.
00:24:07.570 - 00:25:13.188, Speaker E: There's quite a few out there, and this gives you a really high level of security, prevents pretty much all hacker based attacks of actually just stealing your keys outright. And this is good for most people. However, there are still single points of failure. And specifically, this is because you have one key that controls everything. So if that key gets lost, even if it doesn't get hacked or stolen, but that key gets lost, you're effectively locked out of your money. So the final tier of self custody is one in which you eliminate single points of failure, in which you can be human, you can make mistakes, you can have things go wrong, and then not be catastrophic. And this is where multisig really shines, because it allows you to create architectures that I would argue can far exceed that of the strongest bank vault, or even of something like Fort Knox.
00:25:13.188 - 00:26:44.836, Speaker E: Even Fort Knox is a single point of failure. It theoretically could get destroyed somehow. So when you are able to diversify your key material into different geographic locations, into storage by different hardware manufacturers with different supply chains, and different software and different firmware, really what this allows you to do is you're able to leverage the magic of something we call additive security, which is basically a strength through diversity, so that you know that there can always be potential failure or things that can go wrong or weaknesses in any particular key storage solution. But if your keys are all in different solutions, then you know that anything that goes wrong with one of them is highly unlikely to go wrong with the other ones. And that's how you basically weather a loss situation, is that if a loss occurs, you're only going to lose one of your three or five keys or whatever, and that's fine. You just go get a new device and generate a new key, and carry on. And really this is what CASA is trying to make much easier for people to enter into these types of architectures and to reason about them and think about the trade offs because they have export service to go along with it.
00:26:44.940 - 00:27:06.228, Speaker D: That's a great explanation, Jamison. I think the diversification, even geographically or with multiple types of parties, you have it on your phone or multiple hardware wallets, is a truly powerful innovation when you add. But what's so interesting is that this is basically composable natively on bitcoin.
00:27:06.276 - 00:27:06.484, Speaker E: Right.
00:27:06.524 - 00:27:14.876, Speaker D: This is something that you can, you're not, you know, reinventing bitcoin core technology to do this. Right? You're simply using it.
00:27:15.060 - 00:28:06.018, Speaker E: Yeah. Bitcoin has been a part, it's had this multi signature part of the protocol since, I want to say, 20 2013, 2014. There was an early version of multisig that was not very good, and thankfully almost nobody used it. But then when page of script hash came out, I think late 2013, early 2014, Bitgo was one of the first multisig wallet providers to take advantage of that. And since then, quite a few wallet providers have come out that have supported Multisig. However, the vast majority of wallets out there are free, like use at your own risk type of things. So it's very easy for someone to get in over their head and set up their multisig in a way that's not great.
00:28:06.018 - 00:28:07.786, Speaker E: It could still have single points of failure.
00:28:07.850 - 00:28:34.984, Speaker D: Yeah, there was one I remember. Was it Bitpay's wallet, copay, that had some early multisig functionality, maybe in 1617, but it suffered a, effectively a supply chain saw, open source software, supply chain bug. Right. There was like a compromised library under there that was used to. So, you know, there's a history of these things being dangerous. That's why I think there's a. But now I think it's much more, much more mature.
00:28:34.984 - 00:28:40.060, Speaker D: You guys, unchained capital, a variety of other providers are making use of it.
00:28:40.132 - 00:28:50.524, Speaker E: Yeah. And I think that that's, again, that's a story of why diversity is important. I think the problem there with copay is that all of the keys were being stored in the same software. And so.
00:28:50.604 - 00:28:50.844, Speaker D: Right.
00:28:50.884 - 00:28:56.684, Speaker E: You know, you have a bar in that software, and if it's all the same, then every key is exposed to that same vulnerability.
00:28:56.804 - 00:29:13.944, Speaker D: Yeah, I think with Kasa, even you guys have designed it such that you guys can go away entirely and I can still recover using my keys and the derivation path information and stuff that you guys provide to me.
00:29:14.484 - 00:30:15.886, Speaker E: Correct. This is actually an often overlooked point, like when we say at Casa that we are helping people eliminate single points of failure, that includes Casa itself, we want to make sure that even if Casa blows up or ceases to exist for any reason, or even if Casa turned malicious for some reason, be as paranoid as you want, nation state actor, whatever, that it should not be possible for CasA clients to lose money or to get locked out of their funds as a result of Kasa, the company, failing. And so this is actually one of the first things that happens when you finish initializing a multi signature wallet at Casa, is that we give you all the information and instructions that you need to be able to recreate that wallet and access those funds without using any Kasa software or infrastructure.
00:30:16.010 - 00:30:37.430, Speaker D: Yeah, it very powerful. All right, let's. Let's move on. I have some other stuff I want to ask you about, Jameson. I love the multisig story. I think it's one of the most interesting things about bitcoin in general, that, frankly, is one of the core use cases of it. I also think similarly about proof of reserves or, you know, cryptographic attestations of ownership.
00:30:37.430 - 00:30:56.784, Speaker D: I should say even more broadly, also being a core use for bitcoin. But I want to get into some of what I first learned about your content. You, Jameson, was all the content that you produce. You produce a lot of content. You have for years. I've been sending people to lop.net bitcoin HTML for a long time.
00:30:56.784 - 00:31:19.964, Speaker D: You now have bitcoin page that goes there. I don't know how to ask this. What was the motivation for aggregating all that information? It's a great website that has a whole host of information on almost everything you can think of about bitcoin. How much work is it? What got you started doing that? Was it a project for yourself that then became useful to others? How did you get doing that?
00:31:20.084 - 00:32:38.374, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, pretty much all of my projects are self serving. In particular, the educational resources that I maintain that I think have at this point, over 2000 different links in them started off just as a list of bookmarks in my browser. And really what happened over time is I kept realizing I would get the same questions repeated over and over again, and I would have to go find the answers and the resources. And so it was very redundant. And it was, I guess, back in 2015 or 2016, I was like, I need to just take this list of bookmarks and I need to put them on a website, and then I can just paste the link to the website and say, here, find it for yourself. And so that started off with maybe 100 links, and over the years it has expanded into like 40 different pages and like I said, thousands of different links as the ecosystem has grown and has become much more diversified and has resources that are much more specialized in what they're trying to do. So I maintain that on a almost daily basis, whenever I come across a new resource that I think is good, I'll add it in.
00:32:38.374 - 00:33:24.254, Speaker E: I also have to do regular pruning as various websites go offline and are no longer supported because I don't want a ton of dead links on there. But it mostly runs itself pretty smoothly these days. And I even have been posting metrics about it for my annual report recently, kind of showing that the interest and number of visitors going to my website has been pretty flat during the bear market, as expected. I think based upon previous activities, once you see the number of visitors to my website really spiking, that usually signals that we're near the end of the bull market because retail is fomoing in.
00:33:24.414 - 00:34:05.794, Speaker D: I love that. And you've also written a lot yourself. I'm just browsing your page now on lop.net. And I mean, you've written about a whole bunch of, I'm going to say, you know, semi esoteric bitcoin topics. You know what economically unspendable Utxos are. Just looking at some of your recent ones you've written about who or who may not be Satoshi Nakamoto. One of my favorite ones you did was a whole series on demonstrating and investigating the integrity of metal seed backup plates, where you were blow torching some of them and putting others in acid and showing how they held up.
00:34:05.794 - 00:34:21.554, Speaker D: And I think one of the most important ones that you've done for years is the performance tests on bitcoin node software, but also on Ethereum software. I think that was one of the most interesting ones you did. How do you find the time to do these tests in particular?
00:34:21.934 - 00:35:19.362, Speaker E: I mean, this is what I do for fun. The sort of research stuff is a hobby of mine that I've done for many years. It all started off with my statoshi project almost ten years ago now, and Satoshi started because I started running a bitcoin node. But I was like, okay, what is it doing? I want to understand it better. Pretty much all of these other things are unanswered questions that I wanted to understand better. And as I'm investigating them, I just write down my process of what I'm doing. And my goal here is that even though I do have a number of open source projects.
00:35:19.362 - 00:35:42.164, Speaker E: I'm not a full time open source developer, but I do consider most of what I spend my time doing with research to be in the open source ethos. So I want to make all this knowledge open and accessible so that hopefully it will save a lot of other people a lot of time and effort, and perhaps they can even build upon that further.
00:35:43.344 - 00:36:16.954, Speaker D: Yeah, it's been very useful to me over the years. Let's talk a little bit about privacy, Jameson, because you're one of the most articulate and consistent advocates for operational security, OpSEC, as we say, both generally, but also in particular as it relates to bitcoin. There was a story, I think, in the New York Times about an incident that you suffered. I don't know if you're comfortable retelling that story briefly to our audience, but I think it would provide good color for the rest of this conversation.
00:36:17.414 - 00:37:32.326, Speaker E: Yeah, I've actually written extensively about it. So I have three or four long essays where I described everything that happened and really what I did as a reaction to it. But the short version is that in 2017, as a result of my sort of rise in prominence on bitcoin Twitter, I amassed a large enough audience that eventually some malicious people decided that they would try to extort me. And so they called my local law enforcement and pretended to be me and claimed I had killed people and had hostages and had bombs and really used all of the trigger words that are necessary to get a lethal level of force directed at me. And they were able to do this because it was very easy to find my house. So it was public information. I owned a house, and that address was in numerous different databases that anybody who spent a little time, probably googling or $20 doing a sort of people lookup report could find that address.
00:37:32.326 - 00:39:27.966, Speaker E: So, thankfully, the incident ended without anyone getting hurt. And a number of swatting incidents do not end peacefully, and innocent victims end up getting harmed by police. But really, what I took away from all of that was that the only way I could really defend myself against those type of attacks was to ensure that I wasn't creating a target for someone to point this force at in the first place. So I spent the next year learning a lot about privacy, really extreme privacy, and I sold off all of the assets that I had that were registered in my name, and I moved and I set up new house and vehicles and all of those publicly registered assets under corporations that were anonymously owned by other entities, and then just went to further links to ensure that my name and my physical address were never put into any databases, public or private. And that basically involved creating other mailbox addresses and sort of proxies in a number of different facets of my life. Once I was confident that that shield was set up, I paid private investigators to try to break through it and find me. That's when I embarked upon my quest to go after the person who swatted me, put out $100,000 bounty on them, and the tips started rolling in, and then that turned into kind of a multi year investigation in conjunction with the FBI, who eventually found him.
00:39:27.966 - 00:40:08.484, Speaker E: And we did manage to get him into court, and he pled guilty, and hopefully he's turning his life around. But it ended up being a teenage kid, so kind of got a slap on the wrist and. And I kind of felt sorry for him. He wasn't in a great situation, and he fell in with the wrong crowd, and a number of hacker insecurity types screwed up when they were teenagers. I made mistakes when I was a teenager, too. So I hope that it's a learning lesson for him and that he'll be able to use his skills for good rather than evil in the future.
00:40:09.594 - 00:41:00.790, Speaker D: Well, it sounds like it was a learning lesson for you. And so one of the things that I've been working on, actually, Jameson has a great post from February of last year, how to protect your home network with a gigabit VPN, which I've been working on. And it's a little bit technical, but again, your digital life, your digital traffic, whether you literally leaking your IP address, which can be quite easily tied to your identity, is also a big part of this. I wanted to ask Jameson, you have a real, you had a real on the ground reason why privacy is so important. But what are the more sort of societal impacts in your mind about losing your privacy, either to the government or to third parties? Let me put it simply, why does privacy matter to the everyday person?
00:41:00.862 - 00:42:01.264, Speaker E: Well, the problem is that you don't know what might be used against you in the future. And so in the communication age, information travels instantly and quickly, and once information gets out there, you can't take it back. So much like how I had many aspects of my life that were public back then. I wasn't dreaming of the fact that someone might send a SWAT team to my house because I would become a prominent figure in a niche Twitter community. You never know what's going to happen. And one of the examples that I like, I mean, there's a lot of examples out there, but one of the downsides to the nature of the Internet is that you can go from being a nobody to being a somebody instantly, just if you do or say the wrong thing. We all know what it means to go viral, but a lot of people haven't experienced that.
00:42:01.264 - 00:43:02.974, Speaker E: I think most people won't experience that. But if you are an active Internet user, especially if you're on social media or if you're creating content, if you're speaking your mind, then it's always possible that something you do or say kind of triggers a hive mind and that you end up with the ire of millions of people directed at you overnight. And that is when you will wish that you had strong privacy put in place. So, you know, some good examples of that. There was, I think her name was Justine Sacco, for example. She was a marketing person, and she got on a flight, I think, to go from America to Africa, where she had family, and she made some sort of off color joke about hoping she didn't get AIDS while she was in Africa. And she was someone who had, like, 100 followers on Twitter.
00:43:02.974 - 00:43:57.644, Speaker E: But for whatever reason, luck was not with her on that day. And her tweet went viral, had millions of people talking about it, and people actually showed up at the airport when she landed. So, you know, she went to sleep on the plane and woke up basically an infamous Internet celebrity. And I think she lost her job and had a whole lot of other negative consequences as a result of that. But that's just kind of my point, is that you can go from minding your own business and not having a lot of attention on you to being a sort of niche celebrity. And as we all know, celebrities have had to deal with stalkers and other stuff, and that's something that people in Hollywood are used to, and they have resources and they have infrastructure put in place to help with that, but the average person, not so much.
00:43:58.224 - 00:44:33.756, Speaker D: Yeah. And when it comes to digital bearer assets like bitcoin, the attack vectors can be even more acute and deliberate. One of the other things Jameson tracks that I think he's the only one that actually keeps an archive of this is physical attacks on bitcoiners and on people that own digital assets. This is often called the $5 wrench attack. I think now, with inflation, it's probably more of like a $10 inflation wrench attack. What is that? What? What is that attack? Jameson. And I don't know if you have any prominent examples in your mind, but you can.
00:44:33.756 - 00:44:38.300, Speaker D: Jameson tracks this around the world. This happens a relatively decent amount.
00:44:38.412 - 00:45:53.594, Speaker E: Yeah. I mean, basically, we're talking about physical coercion for you to hand over your money, it's a traditional robbery. The difference, and really what bitcoin changed is that prior to having digital bearer assets, if someone was going to rob you, they were probably only going to do that. If it's a targeted, planned ahead type of home invasion robbery, they're probably only going to do that if they know that you're wealthy and you have expensive jewelry, precious metals, other things that are small enough to carry off, but really highly dense in value, a pretty limited subset of the population that has those things. And most people who are wealthy, they keep most of their assets in illiquid form, whether that's in various banks and brokerages or, you know, physical real estate. I think there was a really good quote that always stuck with me when someone was talking about why billionaires don't get attacked that often. Someone said, well, it's very hard to steal a baseball team.
00:45:53.594 - 00:47:15.364, Speaker E: You know, it's like, what can you get away with from a practical point of view? And so now with these digital bearer assets, someone can easily run off with millions or hundreds of millions of dollars just on a little thumb drive sized device. And so what's happening is that as this ecosystem continues to grow, people who are criminally minded, which I do think is a fairly small subset of the population, but nevertheless something to worry about, they are starting to try to calculate what is my roi if I go target someone who is probably highly wealthy in these digital bearer assets? That's what I've been tracking. There seems to be a pretty strong correlation between the exchange rates of bitcoin and other assets to the number of physical attacks that are happening. I don't want to be a fear monger. These are still relatively small numbers. I think maybe 150 attacks that we know about that have been cataloged. There are definitely far more because a lot of people who end up being physically attacked don't publicize it because they don't want to attract even more attention.
00:47:15.364 - 00:47:50.256, Speaker E: But some interesting things have come out of this, of where these attacks are happening. And we actually saw some press recently where I think it's Sweden is having a lot of these attacks, and it's actually. It's being blamed on a swedish law that requires everyone to publicize their home address. So apparently in Sweden, it's very easy for people to find where you live, and you can't really use the same tools that I've been able to use in the United States to help obfuscate that.
00:47:50.400 - 00:48:26.476, Speaker D: Wow, it's strange and dangerous sounding putting all your information on the Internet like that. So, yeah, I've seen these two. They can be quite frightening, the concept of it. I think it's another reason to try to maintain a low profile and not tell the world that maybe there's twelve or 24 seed words that if they merely got from you, they could take a bunch of your money. Let's transition. I want to ask you, Jameson, you said you got interested in bitcoin in 2012, and you've certainly been working on it for a long time. I see on Twitter you have a taproot wizard icon.
00:48:26.476 - 00:49:10.594, Speaker D: I know you've been outspoken on a variety of bitcoin issues over the years, including during the block size wars in 2016 and 17. What is the state in your mind of bitcoin culture? And I don't want to. For our audience, I think bitcoin culture is significantly bigger and less homogenous than the Twitter and X.com sphere would make you think. I guess in terms of the loudest parts, it seems like we're entering quite an interesting time in bitcoin culture. Maybe with some forks in the road. I don't want to, I should say lowercase forks in the road about what is the true meaning of bitcoin, its value proposition.
00:49:10.594 - 00:49:15.630, Speaker D: How has it evolved over your years watching bitcoin and where do you think it's headed?
00:49:15.702 - 00:51:18.832, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, I wrote a long essay that I think I entitled it a history of bitcoin maximalism, in which I talked about what I saw as being the evolution of the predominant bitcoin culture over the past ten years. And it has devolved, in a sense, but not in an unexpected way. I think as the ecosystem goes more mainstream, you're going to have larger and larger cohorts of people coming in with less and less deep levels of knowledge. So you have more people coming in with only a very surface level of knowledge, and perhaps they're not devoting the same amount of time that some of us ogs who are really nerdy devoted to it. And so what's happening is that they are looking to people in positions of leadership or reputation to kind of tell them what's going on. What should I be thinking about these things that are happening in the community? And so really, what I have kind of settled on that I think is happening, at least in the past year or two, is that there seems to be a contingent of, I guess we could call them influencers or outspoken people in the bitcoin community who have taken a much more moral stance rather than technical and economic stance of what they perceive to be the correct use of bitcoin or the correct path forward for bitcoin. It's really gotten to the point where I felt like just calling people maximalists doesn't really mean much anymore.
00:51:18.832 - 00:52:16.570, Speaker E: That term doesn't mean much because there's many different types of maximalist. I believe I was the first one to coin the term bitcoin monetary maximalist a number of years ago when I got canceled for being involved in a registered securities token. And I explained why I felt like registered securities tokens were completely fine to be interested in. They're like, they're not trying to be bitcoin or even be like a permissionless defi type of thing. And so now we have these people who I don't even call them toxic max anymore. I tend to refer to them as Puritans because they tend to take puritanical views on, like, if you do anything outside of these specific use cases, you are unclean. And, you know, you are not a good bitcoiner.
00:52:16.570 - 00:53:12.162, Speaker E: And so, you know, I've clashed with many people over the years due to my views on bitcoin and the greater crypto ecosystem. Like, as you noted, I have a taproot wizard, and it's not because I'm, like, into inscriptions and ordinals and whatnot. I mean, I've been paying attention to it. I haven't been, like, buying and trading these things, but I got offered a taproot wizard inscription, and I was like, sure, I'll do it just to piss off the Puritans. It's more of a social signaling type of mechanism. It'll be interesting to see where things go from here. There have been some talks of forking, but really, I think that's actually the Puritans hoping that the unclean people will fork off of bitcoin and leave them alone.
00:53:12.162 - 00:53:24.694, Speaker E: And I don't think that's going to happen. As much as I would like to see a fork and an airdrop, I don't think that the actual economic will power is there to pull it off.
00:53:25.384 - 00:53:52.176, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't either. It's been. It really has. I feel like it really accelerated during COVID when everyone was sort of at home and all there really was was clubhouse and podcasts. You saw a real sort of escalation in the homogeneity of the bitcoin viewpoint. I think so. I tend to think that any of these disputes and public sort of debates about bitcoin are ultimately positive.
00:53:52.176 - 00:54:15.754, Speaker D: They help, you know, increase the tent size of bitcoin. And in the end, I mean, I think of bitcoin as a technical and economic thing. Yeah, I agree. I love your point about that. They look at it through more of a moral lens. That's tricky, right. Because morality, everybody has a different view on morality and it's also so prescriptive as to be narrowing rather than expanding the pie.
00:54:15.754 - 00:54:28.262, Speaker D: Okay, just a few more questions for you, Jameson, before we let you go. What's something that gets you extremely excited about bitcoin, just say over the next year or two?
00:54:28.438 - 00:55:36.322, Speaker E: Well, I want to continue seeing improvements at the protocol level. I like the fact that there have been, it seems, an acceleration in proposals for various protocol improvements. Of course, it's been several years now since our actual last soft fork, and I would say we still haven't really taken advantage of everything that taproot and Tapscript and schnor signatures have given to us. There's a lot of tooling that still remains to be built around that, but there's a need for continued improvement to both the security and scalability of the protocol. So one proposal that I wrote about is Opvault. And I think that's interesting. And it kind of goes in conjunction with a number of other covenants proposals that have been getting more traction over the past year.
00:55:36.322 - 00:57:03.106, Speaker E: And the short version is covenants is basically a way to put impose future restrictions on how your bitcoin can be spent. Opvault is a very specific type of covenant, which I found interesting because it actually gives you what I've been calling reactive security. So right now the only security you have for your coins is proactive. You have to build up a really, really high wall of defenses because if any attacker busts through all your defenses, they wipe you out and your money is gone and you can't get it back. Cool thing about vaults is that you can actually construct your bitcoin deposit address with additional conditions that say, okay, if the money is going to get spent out of this address, it actually has to go to a temporary holding area for some period of time, and during that period of time I can yank back the funds. So this actually allows you to get your money back. If your proactive security gets busted through and you basically sweep the funds to a separate recovery wallet that you have set up ahead of time, there's also potential scalability improvements that would allow us to further enhance lightning network.
00:57:03.106 - 00:57:56.716, Speaker E: So while lightning network is kind of like a force multiplier in the sense that you can do theoretically unlimited number of transactions off chain by only doing two on chain transactions, even that can be improved further where we could essentially have shared lightning channels. So imagine if you could have 1000 people sharing a lightning channel and only two on chain transactions, and then doing tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of off chain transactions. So especially with all of the ordinals and inscriptions stuff, putting a lot more contention for the scarce block space, I think that that should make it clear that we still need further scalability improvements.
00:57:56.860 - 00:58:22.024, Speaker D: Yeah, I would love to see Kasa. Seems like a prime venue to implement some cool covenant stuff once vault or CTV or one of these others gets implemented. I would love to see that. I know at fidelity we were quite interested in vaulted custody in general, the same types of ideas. Spencer Hamel and Sam Abbasi, Bob Mcelrath all did work on that. Brian Bishop did work on it as well with them, I think so. That would be awesome.
00:58:22.024 - 00:58:47.416, Speaker D: Okay, just a few more. Jamison, what would you say? Greg? Mac, I wanted to ask you about this. Greg Maxwell was once asked on Reddit what the biggest threat to bitcoin was, and he replied that, no, it wasn't a 51% attack. It wasn't. Sure, there's risks of a code bug or something, there's always those risks. But that it was actually sort of ignorance and apathy among the populace. And you mentioned this a little bit.
00:58:47.416 - 00:59:00.244, Speaker D: You talked about new people coming in and only knowing a little bit. But in your mind, I don't know. You can either agree or disagree with that specific thing, or maybe there's something totally else. What's the biggest risk to bitcoin's continued adoption, in your mind?
00:59:00.584 - 01:00:04.104, Speaker E: Well, to continued adoption, I think, requires ignorance. Just not looking at the state of the world and what's happening. All of the financial shenanigans that people are able to opt out of if they put in the time and effort. But no, apathy, I think, has been the biggest threat and always will be. Because if you look at any of these systems, even as I catalog the downfall of some of the scammier systems, it's very, very difficult to kill a truly decentralized system, even some of the ones that I would call dead. For most practical purposes, the networks are still running, there's still a handful of people running the nose, and the protocol is technically still operational. I've said for a while that bitcoin can't die unless we all agree that it's dead and we stop working on it and stop maintaining it.
01:00:04.104 - 01:01:16.104, Speaker E: This is also why I'm not really worried about a point in time catastrophic attack say a protocol exploit does get found and is actually used on the live network. Or say that there is a 51% nation state attack that essentially prevents transactions from getting confirmed. Those things, while they would be critical, and they would stop the network from being usable for that point in time, as long as those of us who care are paying attention, even if the machine consensus of the protocol and the network is broken for some reason, we can always fall back to human consensus. And this has happened before several times. It's been ten years at this point since the last time that happened. We hope that it doesn't happen, but that's always a disaster recovery option. It just requires that the technical people are still around and care enough to try to analyze the problem, propose a solution, and move forward.
01:01:16.524 - 01:01:51.852, Speaker D: Yeah, I do think that if we ever encountered anything dramatic, bitcoiners would fix it. Sometimes people say, well, what if quantum computing is one of my favorite fuds? I don't know, there's a variety of them. What if it could break EcDSA and steal funds? Or what if, you know, one little quantum computer or big, I don't know, maybe they're big. Could, like, hash the entire, you know, replicate the entire hash rate of the network. And I've always just said, well, I mean, if that happened, I mean, bitcoiners could just hard fork and fix it. Like, it's not like a. We don't want a hard fork, but I mean, if it were existential, certainly they'd fix it.
01:01:51.852 - 01:02:10.684, Speaker D: We would fix it. Right? Well, look, my friend Jameson, I really appreciate you joining us. From an undisclosed location, co founder and CTO of Casa, a great bitcoin and crypto custody company. Is that what you would say? Custody company? That doesn't sound right. Self custody company.
01:02:11.344 - 01:02:57.924, Speaker E: Yeah. Yeah, that's where it gets a little tricky, right? We help people be their own bank. We help you achieve a level of self sovereignty where you still have someone that you can come to to get advice. And you don't have to kind of go out on your own, do the lone wolf thing, because really, if you go out and you're setting up your own bank, as it were, without getting any advice and basically having to do all your own research, it's a lot more likely that you may accidentally introduce some flaws, because this isn't what you do for a living. It's what I've done for a living for nine years now.
01:02:59.064 - 01:03:13.724, Speaker D: Yeah, well, Casa is a great resource. Check out Jameson's content@lop.net. Lopp.net I do all the time and again. Jameson Lapp, CTO and co founder of Casa thank you so much for coming on Galaxy Brains.
