Phineas, my friend from the mountains of Vermont to where do you return this weekend for the holidays? Do you have something special planned? You know, the holidays are always a stressful time, as somebody who puts off my planning, but going to Miami, actually. Oh, let's go.
00:01:52.968 - 00:01:56.950, Speaker B: Doing a little switch this year and going south.
00:01:57.112 - 00:02:16.814, Speaker A: I like that. It's gonna be cold. How about you up north? Hanging with the family? It's gonna be good. No traveling for me this holiday, which is gonna be nice, you know, keep it chill, easy with the kids and the fam. So I hope everybody has a safe and happy holiday weekend, and we will catch you next week for another episode. We're not taking it off. We're back.
00:02:16.814 - 00:02:26.810, Speaker A: But let's get right into this awesome episode now and go to Bimnet. Let's go now to our friend Bim net Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet. Welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:02:26.882 - 00:02:27.642, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:02:27.698 - 00:02:34.054, Speaker A: So bitcoin is still pressing and crypto markets are still going higher. Yeah. No. Is this Santa rally?
00:02:35.194 - 00:02:41.442, Speaker C: Well, it's kind of a multi month rally. Think about bitcoin. It's basically at a Santa Claus rally almost every month this year.
00:02:41.498 - 00:02:42.162, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:02:42.338 - 00:02:53.014, Speaker C: Which I think is why it's so compelling to traditional investors. Even the best traditional investors, they look at their portfolio. Let's say they were heavily weighted at Nasdaq, maybe up 45%.
00:02:53.354 - 00:02:54.082, Speaker A: Not bad.
00:02:54.178 - 00:02:55.314, Speaker C: Pretty good, actually.
00:02:55.434 - 00:02:56.378, Speaker A: Epic. Epic.
00:02:56.426 - 00:03:13.314, Speaker C: Great. Fantastic. One of the best years in a long time for the Nasdaq. Bitcoin's up 150% this year. Right. We've had Solana up over 600% this year. I mean, some of these alt moves have been insane, like thousands of percent crazy.
00:03:13.314 - 00:03:34.898, Speaker C: You know, nfts have done well, et cetera. But high level, there are liquid crypto things that offer competitive alternatives to traditional markets, especially if you're thinking about, like, where the money is right now in the world. A ton of it's parked in bonds earning next to no yield. Right. Well, on a relative basis.
00:03:34.946 - 00:03:35.154, Speaker A: Right.
00:03:35.194 - 00:03:48.466, Speaker C: Like, you know, you still can still get tens, you know, us ten years at 390. Fantastic. And if you go further out the credit spectrum, you can, you know, boost those yields a little bit. But would I rather be long bitcoin? Absolutely. Have you seen the recent bitcoin ads?
00:03:48.530 - 00:03:48.922, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:49.018 - 00:03:53.138, Speaker C: I mean, the Dos equies guy is about to be in front of people's faces.
00:03:53.226 - 00:03:53.562, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:53.618 - 00:03:54.586, Speaker C: Shilling bitcoin.
00:03:54.690 - 00:03:56.474, Speaker A: I knew he was a bitcoiner. You could always tell.
00:03:56.554 - 00:03:57.018, Speaker B: You could always.
00:03:57.066 - 00:03:58.666, Speaker C: He's the world's most interesting man.
00:03:58.770 - 00:04:02.004, Speaker A: Obviously. Of course, he likes bitcoin. It is. It's the world's most interesting money.
00:04:02.114 - 00:04:15.952, Speaker C: Absolutely. However, let's stick to message, though, functionally speaking, there's a new investment vehicle for bitcoin that's going to unlock tons of money that hasn't been able to go in before.
00:04:16.048 - 00:04:21.200, Speaker A: I'm very confident it's going to happen. But can you imagine the rug if it doesn't? No, it's going to happen. Yeah.
00:04:21.272 - 00:04:29.192, Speaker C: And I'm telling you personally, we've published, Galaxy has published estimates of how much the ETF inflows are going to be.
00:04:29.248 - 00:04:31.312, Speaker A: Which were conservative, by the way, which were super conservative.
00:04:31.368 - 00:04:34.246, Speaker C: In my head. They're going to be north of the 30 yards in the first year.
00:04:34.310 - 00:04:36.822, Speaker A: Wow. That's crazy.
00:04:36.958 - 00:04:40.918, Speaker C: Way north. The demand we've seen in crypto related equities.
00:04:41.086 - 00:04:41.694, Speaker A: It's high.
00:04:41.774 - 00:04:57.702, Speaker C: It's high. We're talking multiple billions over the past couple of months. And that's not even with an ETF product. Like, wait for the actual ETF product to launch and it is game over. The prices you're seeing now are just noise.
00:04:57.758 - 00:04:58.902, Speaker A: These are introductory prices.
00:04:58.958 - 00:05:09.040, Speaker C: Introductory prices, absolutely. There's gonna be noise around the actual launch. Right. You know, speculation, stuff going up and down. The volume is going to be pretty intense.
00:05:09.112 - 00:05:09.488, Speaker A: Right.
00:05:09.576 - 00:05:19.072, Speaker C: But if you're a big picture investor in a big picture allocator, right, you are going to be stepping in. Gotta have something and in size, right.
00:05:19.088 - 00:05:19.896, Speaker A: You gotta have some.
00:05:20.000 - 00:05:22.080, Speaker C: The short term noise is just noise.
00:05:22.152 - 00:05:22.784, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:22.944 - 00:06:00.672, Speaker C: Right. Once the ETF product launches, it becomes a buy and hold asset in the US capital market forever. There are, I mean, I don't know about you, but there are things in people's portfolios they don't touch forever. Like, here's what happens. You buy something, it goes up, right? If you ever want to sell it, you're going to have a taxable gain. If you're doing it in a tax deferred account, et cetera, you're just going to passively keep accumulating because people just run these strategies. And so what it constantly brings to mind is that an ETF and an ETF in the US is the best combination of things you could possibly have.
00:06:00.672 - 00:06:25.296, Speaker C: World's best capital market and world's best wealth creation financial innovation product ever created ETF in the US. And it's got a great narrative and all the big boys are joining. It's such an easy trade, it's so mid curve and you don't have to be a genius to do it, but that's where we're headed. And I think you're going to see tremendous inflows and the price appreciation is really just getting started.
00:06:25.360 - 00:06:37.602, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. So it's been a wild year for many reasons. The Fed, though. Absolutely. What's gone on with the Fed this year? It's been a big road. I mean, they continued to raise rates and they stopped.
00:06:37.602 - 00:06:45.066, Speaker A: They also created among the largest bank bailout programs that's ever been created with the BTFP. Is that what it's called?
00:06:45.130 - 00:06:48.762, Speaker C: Correct. And expanded usage of the discount window and things like that.
00:06:48.818 - 00:07:03.556, Speaker A: How would you talk about just. Of course I'm shifting gears a little bit, but we're at the end of the year, you know, chair Jay Powell is getting a report card. Like, what would you say? So if you're, if you believe that.
00:07:03.580 - 00:07:34.586, Speaker C: Their goal was to bring inflation down from 9% to somewhere closer to 2%, which is their target, without harming the employment picture. They've done a great job of doing that. Right. But in terms of like, the long run sustainability of, you know, this policy, time will tell, right. Because there's still material reinflation risks. They're also letting equity markets and bond markets get way ahead of themselves. With S and P and Nasdaq almost at fresh year to date highs.
00:07:34.586 - 00:07:55.946, Speaker C: I mean, they are at fresh. Russell's ripping like crazy. I think that there's going to be tremendous wealth effect from that. I think mortgage rates dropping are going to bring more buyers into the market and not necessarily more supply. So home prices could come back up. You've had tremendous benefit from oil prices declining meaningfully. But that's not to say they're going to decline permanently and stay low.
00:07:55.946 - 00:08:29.308, Speaker C: And so you've got upside risks there and high level. This is still a banking system and a financial market in the US that's strung together by the ability of the Fed to print more money and for the world to not debase the dollar because of them printing their money. And that's just a function of us having no alternative. But how did the US respond to the banking crisis? Oh, we're just going to do this blanket guarantee of all banking deposits in the US. We have the BTFP. Right. There is an issue about doing that.
00:08:29.436 - 00:08:31.492, Speaker A: Right. And creates a moral hazard. Correct?
00:08:31.508 - 00:09:06.200, Speaker C: The moral hazard issue, yeah. And so I don't think, you know, we've yet seen the consequences of that. And I do think that bitcoin plays an interesting role, not necessarily right now, but thinking about where monetary policy is going to be in five years from now or ten years from now, when we're looking at deficit spending that went totally out of control, national debt levels that are just unsustainable and things of that nature. We're going to think back on these moments and be like, oh, wow, maybe that wasn't a good policy choice.
00:09:06.232 - 00:09:17.872, Speaker A: It's the same kind of thing a lot of people said in 2000 whenever they did TARP, right? Like maybe they should have let them fail, right. So then they could learn the lesson and they don't do it again. And like, that's how capitalism's supposed to work, right? Is that.
00:09:17.968 - 00:09:20.304, Speaker C: But that's not how capitalism in the US is ever going to work.
00:09:20.344 - 00:09:27.840, Speaker A: And it's definitely not how banks work in the US, because banks, absolutely, they're frankly pseudo government organizations at this point. I mean, truly, I don't mean that.
00:09:27.912 - 00:09:29.136, Speaker C: They are quasi government organizations.
00:09:29.160 - 00:09:42.464, Speaker A: Yeah, they really are. Because first of all, you need crazy levels of registration to even operate one. The number of banks is declining precipitously over years. But also, like, they are extensions of Fed policy. They are extensions of government policy.
00:09:44.084 - 00:09:52.484, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, they're quasi government entity. Right. During the COVID They did, they processed all of the small business loans and all of that and.
00:09:52.644 - 00:09:53.756, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:09:53.780 - 00:10:25.614, Speaker C: So at high level, I think I would give the Fed a reasonable report card. And it's a really hard job. And I respect what Jay Powell has done. I do find the level of coordination a little bit concerning in the sense that treasury is supposed to be independent from Powell. Right. But more and more, it seems like they're ever intertwined with how they conduct policy from the treasury standpoint and monetary standpoint. And I think that's more moral hazard.
00:10:25.694 - 00:10:27.190, Speaker A: Yeah, it is.
00:10:27.222 - 00:10:33.194, Speaker C: But yeah. Do I think all of these things are going to help bitcoin? Yes. They're going to lower rates and let risk assets rip.
00:10:33.734 - 00:10:39.414, Speaker A: Here's the question I didn't ask, but certainly I love asking. Okay, wait, so let's, how does this impact bitcoin?
00:10:39.494 - 00:10:44.702, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, exactly. I mean, they're letting people and assets moon.
00:10:44.798 - 00:11:22.312, Speaker A: Well, you know, we're heading into, there's contrast with that. There's contrast with, to your point, the bank bailouts and then something like bitcoin, the sort of long term fiscal sustainability and something like bitcoin. There's also a forthcoming, it is going to be a contrast because the halving is going to happen in April. It's a narrative event more than a like sort of data quantitative event in my opinion, at this point. But it's a big narrative event coordinated by code decentralized network around the world simultaneously will algorithmically, incredibly tighten its monetary policy. So amazing. And guess what the markets say.
00:11:22.312 - 00:11:26.320, Speaker A: Guess when the markets are betting rate cuts start happening march, April, May.
00:11:26.432 - 00:11:27.168, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:11:27.336 - 00:11:38.632, Speaker A: This is exactly what happened in 2020. They hiked, they expanded the monetary base as quickly, more quickly and more largely than ever before. Right at the last having.
00:11:38.728 - 00:11:39.072, Speaker C: Yes.
00:11:39.128 - 00:11:42.080, Speaker A: So as it's, get this, get this.
00:11:42.232 - 00:12:11.842, Speaker C: Nice marketing event, there's also a little bit of a contradiction at play with Fed policy once they start cutting because they're also winding down their balance sheet at the same time. Right. And so why are you pursuing easier monetary policy while you're pursuing tighter monetary policy over here with your balance sheet? And so there's an argument to say that eventually they're going to pause that stuff. And if that pause lines up with the first rate cut and the havening. It's going to be gangbusters.
00:12:11.898 - 00:12:12.170, Speaker A: Beautiful.
00:12:12.202 - 00:12:29.624, Speaker C: They're going to be like, the Fed is no longer decreasing its balance sheet. Then it's like, what direction is it going to go? It's going to ultimately go towards expansion because then you can't finance this debt without MMT and all this stuff. And the arguments are just so clear and so obviously well, and it's so reflexive.
00:12:30.364 - 00:12:51.464, Speaker A: Well, everyone is going to go. If you celebrate the holidays this weekend, you're going to go home. And probably just like Thanksgiving, your parents and your aunts and uncles or whoever it is that hopefully you're spending the holiday with, they may ask about bitcoin. It's been quite a year, and I remember last year we started this at 16. Five. And goodness gracious, it's 44k today.
00:12:51.884 - 00:12:55.204, Speaker C: It's on its way to like six digits.
00:12:56.344 - 00:13:02.896, Speaker A: Have a great weekend, bimnet, and we will actually catch you next year, my friend. So thanks so much for having me.
00:13:02.920 - 00:13:09.112, Speaker C: This year, by the way. And I want to say I appreciate all the listeners out there. It's been a great year and hopefully we can have a great 2024.
00:13:09.208 - 00:13:18.736, Speaker A: Bimnodebib from Galaxy Digital trading, thank you so much. Let's go now to our guest, Sam Abbasi, founder and CEO of Hoseki. Welcome, Sam, to Galaxy Brains.
00:13:18.800 - 00:13:19.512, Speaker B: Thanks, Alex.
00:13:19.648 - 00:13:34.016, Speaker A: Sam's an old friend and I'm very happy to have you on the podcast. We're going to talk about some interesting stuff, but first, let's tell people who you are, go through a little bit of your story. For those who don't know you, by the way, great podcast you did with Marty Bent, which goes into a lot of this as well. A friend of the pod as well.
00:13:34.040 - 00:13:35.560, Speaker B: But yeah, that was about a year ago now.
00:13:35.632 - 00:13:38.288, Speaker A: Yeah. How long have you been in bitcoin?
00:13:38.416 - 00:13:40.312, Speaker B: It's been almost seven years.
00:13:40.368 - 00:13:44.576, Speaker A: Good God, sir, I know what that's like. It's been a grind over those seven years.
00:13:44.720 - 00:13:46.564, Speaker B: I've aged about 40 years.
00:13:48.024 - 00:13:55.020, Speaker A: It's like the reverse Benjamin Button, which himself is reversed. I don't know. Right. Like seven equals 40. Um, how'd you get interested in bitcoin?
00:13:55.212 - 00:14:13.692, Speaker B: Sort of by accident. Um, I was doing, I guess the story is I was doing, uh, research in neuroscience. Um, I loved research. I still love research. Uh, but it was tough because the things that I were researching weren't really applicable in real life. Immediately it was drug development for traumatic brain injury. So that takes like ten years to get into people's hands.
00:14:13.748 - 00:14:14.036, Speaker A: Right.
00:14:14.100 - 00:14:37.064, Speaker B: I'm not a very patient person. And this was 2017. I decided to go into software development, and that's when the crypto market was just rocketing. So I created a software development company down in Miami. That's where I'm from. And there was just a lot of demand for people to build crypto tools like ETH wallets. A lot of the ICO stuff back then, and I knew nothing about the space.
00:14:37.064 - 00:15:01.846, Speaker B: I don't come from finance. That was my first exposure to derivatives, to financial products, to unregulated financial products, potentially. And I just became fascinated, to be honest. ETH was sort of like the entry point because it was very easy for someone who has a full stack development background to build things. And the journey into bitcoin was a bit more involved. But, yeah, it was sort of just by chance.
00:15:01.950 - 00:15:07.366, Speaker A: So you ran a development company and what, you're building wallets and stuff? There were a lot of.
00:15:07.470 - 00:15:18.390, Speaker B: We were doing basic stuff before it was like websites, basic platforms, e commerce stuff, nothing really crazy, but there was just a lot of demand for people that wanted to do different types of crypto products.
00:15:18.462 - 00:15:20.606, Speaker A: Yeah, like, a lot of bitcoin forks came out that year.
00:15:20.670 - 00:15:26.302, Speaker B: Yeah, they did. We were part of some of that, too. I mean, admittedly, it was like the dirty part of the space and it.
00:15:26.318 - 00:15:32.262, Speaker A: Was like a gold rush, though. Nobody, I'd say bitcoiners weren't even, I would say, nearly as convicted then as they are now at all.
00:15:32.278 - 00:15:45.612, Speaker B: I mean, things are a lot murkier and like anything in any kind of burgeoning tech or burgeoning industry, the people that are involved that are more risk tolerant are of a certain personality and of a certain disposition that isn't mainstream. It isn't very conservative.
00:15:45.668 - 00:16:00.884, Speaker A: People forget how truly Wild west even 2017 was. I think the biggest exchange at the time may have been Poloniex. Bitfinex was big then, too. But this is a troll box. You're doing a trade on Poloniex.
00:16:01.004 - 00:16:02.260, Speaker B: I think binance existed.
00:16:02.332 - 00:16:02.908, Speaker A: They didn't exist.
00:16:02.956 - 00:16:03.372, Speaker B: Crack it did.
00:16:03.388 - 00:16:08.286, Speaker A: Of course, technically, I think binance may have been founded summer of 2017, but they certainly weren't a player.
00:16:08.390 - 00:16:08.846, Speaker B: Right?
00:16:08.950 - 00:16:12.358, Speaker A: Yeah. Kraken Coinbase, which makes what 2014 might.
00:16:12.366 - 00:16:16.310, Speaker B: Have been like, because it was already crazy enough then. So imagine three, four years before that.
00:16:16.382 - 00:16:27.222, Speaker A: Right? Oh, lord. And I mean, I was interested in bitcoin then, but I wasn't like, trading bitcoin and stuff. So I don't know. I mean, well, you maybe were on the gathering online exchange, you know?
00:16:27.398 - 00:16:36.078, Speaker B: So back then, yeah, it was more opportunistic. Like, I was trying to build a company, and there was demand for a certain product, and I had no conviction about the product. It was just, here's a new technology.
00:16:36.126 - 00:16:41.686, Speaker A: Here's business for you to do development. So. Okay, fast forward, though. So then what happened? That.
00:16:41.750 - 00:17:05.336, Speaker B: So we did that for about almost two years. We closed up shop because of crypto winter in 2019. And then I went to. So, admittedly, I was looking for a bitcoin company to work at. At that point, I understood what bitcoin was, and I was very strong in my conviction. Maybe dogmatic might be the right word, but I couldn't find a good job. I couldn't find, like, there weren't that many companies that the bitcoin ecosystem wasn't really robust enough or built out.
00:17:05.336 - 00:17:32.528, Speaker B: So I found a good opportunity at a company called Algorand in Boston. And I was trying to make my way to Boston because I met you all at the 2019 MIT crypto conference. You, Amanda, Ryan, Stubi, a few other folks at Fidelity. And Boston seemed like the right place to be. Fidelity specifically. There was no job opening, and Algorand was there. So my thinking was, okay, I understand the crypto space well enough and I understand bitcoin well enough that everything else seems like it's bullshit.
00:17:32.528 - 00:17:44.744, Speaker B: Yeah, but what do I know? I'm only two years into the space. I have no background in finance. I kind of learned tech not too long ago either. This project is made up of MIT people.
00:17:44.824 - 00:17:51.336, Speaker A: Silvio McCalli, a brilliant cryptographer. Current SEC chairman Gary Gensler himself said it was a good project back then.
00:17:51.400 - 00:18:13.436, Speaker B: Yep. So why say no, right? So I give that a shot. Brilliant people, like, truly amazing people, worked there for about a year, but that really just strengthened my conviction of bitcoin. There were certain issues with the technology and with the vision of the protocol itself that I thought bitcoin just did a better job, did a better job at addressing. And then the fidelity opportunity opened up.
00:18:13.580 - 00:18:20.284, Speaker A: Preston. Yeah. So we wanted Sam to come to fidelity, and big companies take a long time. But you did make it to fidelity. Did you ever.
00:18:20.404 - 00:18:20.788, Speaker B: Timing.
00:18:20.836 - 00:18:22.028, Speaker A: Did you ever go to the fidelity.
00:18:22.076 - 00:18:25.884, Speaker B: Office for the interview, and that was it?
00:18:26.224 - 00:18:29.576, Speaker A: But you were in Boston to work at Fidelity. Why didn't you work in the office?
00:18:29.680 - 00:18:32.312, Speaker B: I think, what, maybe six or eight weeks before COVID hit?
00:18:32.368 - 00:18:32.992, Speaker A: Oh, yes.
00:18:33.088 - 00:18:34.744, Speaker B: Boston was awesome. I was living in the north end.
00:18:34.784 - 00:18:39.952, Speaker A: We were all great. We got Sam at Fidelity now. Oh, crap. March 12, closing down.
00:18:40.008 - 00:18:44.848, Speaker B: I had the next seven years of my life outlined out in my mind, and it all came crashing down.
00:18:44.936 - 00:18:52.016, Speaker A: So, at Fidelity, you were a bitcoin developer at Fidelity, you were at Fidelity center for Applied Technology Innovation Army?
00:18:52.040 - 00:18:54.192, Speaker B: I was a director in the R and D department, basically, yeah.
00:18:54.248 - 00:18:55.476, Speaker A: And what did you work on?
00:18:55.600 - 00:19:30.422, Speaker B: So just to kind of, like, paint the ground and give some context, fdas, fidelity digital assets, what everyone knows as bitcoin infidelity, was spun out of FCAT, which is the incubator. So my job was to research and develop new products that could be either consumed into existing business units or spun out into their own business units like FDA's. So it's a lot of things. Bitcoin custody, open source bitcoin custody, some lightning research with MIT's business school, Sloan, um, some more audit things that were zero knowledge, proof related. Um, and then ultimately, at the end of it, it was all proof of reserves. Um, so those four things were what I really focused on.
00:19:30.518 - 00:19:41.390, Speaker A: And so I remember one of the things that you did was you worked a lot with proof of reserves and covenants and. Or I should say vaults. We used to call them vaults. I don't know if that's a different thing, but they. They can use covenants.
00:19:41.502 - 00:19:41.886, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:19:41.950 - 00:19:46.542, Speaker A: Um. Vaulted custody, more robust custody. Right. What is that?
00:19:46.598 - 00:19:47.422, Speaker B: Complicated custody?
00:19:47.478 - 00:19:49.374, Speaker A: Complicated, yeah. But powerful.
00:19:49.714 - 00:19:51.306, Speaker B: Yeah. Very powerful.
00:19:51.410 - 00:19:58.466, Speaker A: What could that allow or what? Either the prototype that you were building, open source, you did work on a lot of the open source. Work on it, yeah.
00:19:58.490 - 00:20:01.410, Speaker B: So to give credit where credit's due, this is all Bob McKellarath's research.
00:20:01.482 - 00:20:01.778, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:20:01.826 - 00:20:02.810, Speaker B: All I did was productize it.
00:20:02.842 - 00:20:03.026, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:20:03.050 - 00:20:04.954, Speaker B: Bob did all the hard work before I came.
00:20:04.994 - 00:20:06.218, Speaker A: Shout out, Bob. Bitcoin. Bob.
00:20:06.306 - 00:20:09.554, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, Bob's. Bob's incredible. I don't know where Bob is. Probably on a boat somewhere, I think so.
00:20:09.594 - 00:20:09.722, Speaker A: Right.
00:20:09.738 - 00:20:15.682, Speaker B: In the Caribbean or somewhere, or in Fiji. And with Spencer Hummel as well. We did this work together.
00:20:15.778 - 00:20:16.266, Speaker A: Shout out to Spencer.
00:20:16.290 - 00:20:16.882, Speaker B: Brian Bishop.
00:20:16.978 - 00:20:19.322, Speaker A: Yeah, and Brian Bishop. They published a paper. You guys published a paper, right?
00:20:19.338 - 00:20:20.386, Speaker B: We published two, I think.
00:20:20.490 - 00:20:29.734, Speaker A: And then you also. Not to derail. Cause I do want to ask more about covenants and custody and proof of reserves. A lot more. But you also worked on a paper with what? KPMG.
00:20:30.074 - 00:20:35.354, Speaker B: With KPMG Deloitte proof of reserve. Nick from Castle Carter. He was the practitioner's guide.
00:20:35.434 - 00:20:38.874, Speaker A: Yeah. How to do proof of reserves or, like, the best practices and stuff.
00:20:38.954 - 00:20:39.410, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:20:39.482 - 00:20:47.898, Speaker A: So this is a cause near and dear to both of our hearts, and we'll get a little bit more into proof, but again on covenants and custody. What is that?
00:20:47.946 - 00:21:17.506, Speaker B: So that was my first project at fidelity, massive learning curve because I understood bitcoin at the protocol level, but I realized I didn't understand the granular details of bitcoin. For instance, how transactions work. It's actually quite intricate and it's brilliant. So just to lay the groundwork, it's really two things. A bitcoin transaction is two steps and it's exactly like a physical check. The check has to be signed, only you can sign it and you've got to take it to the bank for funds to move. Doing one of those things is incomplete.
00:21:17.506 - 00:21:33.272, Speaker B: So just like a bitcoin transaction, you've got to sign the transaction and broadcast it to the global bitcoin bank. You can only do one though. You can sign a transaction, not broadcast it. So that's like someone gives you a signed check, it's valid, but you haven't cashed a check, but it is still valid. All you got to do is cash.
00:21:33.288 - 00:21:34.648, Speaker A: It hasn't yet been processed.
00:21:34.696 - 00:22:00.336, Speaker B: Correct, exactly. So covenants exploited that just basic function of how signature verification works and how signatures and bitcoin transactions work, where you can pre sign transactions and basically predestine where they're going to go for things like inheritance, for things like advanced security. The advancing that we were doing was deleting the private key so they can't be spent in any other way. Now there's issues with that. You can't provably delete something. So there's some security vulnerabilities.
00:22:00.400 - 00:22:01.204, Speaker A: Right, right.
00:22:01.624 - 00:22:21.570, Speaker B: But generally it was exploiting the financial concept of covenants, which are, you can and or cannot do things with this asset. So for instance, you know, in some niche cases in like real estate and property investment, this property can't be sold to like an investment group, for example.
00:22:21.642 - 00:22:22.682, Speaker A: Can only be sold to a family.
00:22:22.738 - 00:22:36.802, Speaker B: Or something like that, maintain the integrity of the neighborhood or whatever. And things like loan to debt ratios as well for more advanced types of covenants. So this was the same thing. These funds can only be spent to this address and the keys are deleted, so they can't be spent anywhere else.
00:22:36.898 - 00:22:41.122, Speaker A: So the transaction has already been written. So now there's no keys to create a new transaction.
00:22:41.178 - 00:22:49.812, Speaker B: Not broadcast, but written. Exactly. So if someone does compromise that transaction, that you compromise your custody setup, all they can do is broadcast it to where it was going to go, anywhere.
00:22:49.828 - 00:22:53.572, Speaker A: They don't actually find keys. They find a pre signed transaction, they.
00:22:53.588 - 00:22:54.516, Speaker B: Find a signed check.
00:22:54.580 - 00:23:06.444, Speaker A: All they could do is be like the bank. Yeah, and the bank would be like, well, this thing goes, it's going to this account. Yeah. It can only go to that account, right? Yeah, right. It's like a wire transfer instruction that's already been written. You can't. You could destroy it.
00:23:06.444 - 00:23:10.654, Speaker A: You could find it and destroy it. Maybe that's what you could do. But that only causes havoc. It doesn't.
00:23:10.764 - 00:23:11.826, Speaker B: Well, you have multiple copies.
00:23:11.890 - 00:23:12.554, Speaker A: Yeah. Right.
00:23:12.594 - 00:23:28.226, Speaker B: So even in that case, you're protected. There's some edge cases where if someone compromises your entire custody setup, then you know you're really screwed. But the objective there is risk mitigation. So if they do compromise your setup, they can either seal a bit of funds or they can't seal funds in general because they're only being sent to one place.
00:23:28.290 - 00:23:45.338, Speaker A: I really do like this idea. And you could do this. I could do this myself. I could pre sign it without any. And I raise covenants because there are multiple proposals in bitcoin development to add more robust covenant scripting capabilities. Bitboy 19 obviously comes to mind. There's TX hash, a bunch of others that enable more robust covenants.
00:23:45.386 - 00:23:51.682, Speaker B: It's tricky because there's some social considerations because I mean, the fear is like the government imposing some strict, draconian arbitrary.
00:23:51.738 - 00:24:02.214, Speaker A: So this is like recursive covenants. They talk about like sort of never ending covenants, right? Like this. Can't that I encumber the coins forever even after they're spent once, twice, three times.
00:24:02.514 - 00:24:10.402, Speaker B: Well, recursive is a nightmare. But I mean, even a lighter version of that is simply funds sent from Coinbase can only be sent to whitelist wallets, for example. Right.
00:24:10.498 - 00:24:35.674, Speaker A: And it's one thing if they impose that as a rule on Coinbase, a centralized business. It's another thing if they require them to utilize protocol. But I could right now take my self custody bitcoin, pre sign a transaction to spend it to a different address that I control or into a custodian for all I care, into my digital asset account at Fidelity, for example. And then just destroy the keys and then just store that transaction as my bitcoin.
00:24:35.754 - 00:24:36.174, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:36.274 - 00:24:52.246, Speaker A: And it's safer. And I still want to keep that safe because mostly because I don't want to lose it. But then if you come and hack me, all you can do is effectively move my coin base, my bitcoins, to fidelity. It's elegant in that way.
00:24:52.310 - 00:25:12.172, Speaker B: It is, it's very intricate. I can't recommend doing that for a retail audience because it is very complex. You can easily lose access to your funds. Totally which is already an issue. This is really more for exchanges, for advanced custodians, for high net worth individuals who have the resources to, you know, properly, like, create this regime for their own custody. But I won't personally do that on my funds, for example.
00:25:12.228 - 00:25:43.784, Speaker A: Well, I mean, it's safer, I think, for the average self custody person to use a hardware wallet. Yeah. Or I prefer a multisig setup, which. And there are many companies that will help you with that. You know, the guys at anchor watch Rob and Becca, like, they've come up with some interesting ways that you can be quite expressive using and Repulstra's mini script without needing any new functionality. Apparently, deep in there, in bitcoin script, the coding language, there are really interesting ways to build more expressive covenants already. It's just too hard to use.
00:25:43.784 - 00:25:46.992, Speaker A: So mini script actually allows you to unlock some capabilities.
00:25:47.088 - 00:25:55.392, Speaker B: Well, that's a brilliant thing about bitcoin. You can actually exploit it to really interesting extents, but it's just not as easy as other protocols.
00:25:55.408 - 00:26:14.552, Speaker A: Unfortunately, half the stuff that we've added to bitcoin as a community, it's like discoveries. We discovered bitcoin could be used this way. So very interesting covenants. So let's transition now to the proof of reserve side. Sure, I guess sticking with like your initial research into it, but eventually we'll talk about. Let's talk about Hoseki, what you're building now. Yeah.
00:26:14.608 - 00:26:58.022, Speaker B: So I was a co author on the practitioners guide to proof of reserves, which was, I don't know if sponsored is the right word, but the chamber of digital commerce was the one that organized the whole thing. So myself, Nick Carter from Castle, some folks from KP and G, Deloitte, and a few other auditing firms, it was basically. So it's a holistic assessment of what proof of reserves is and how to apply it. So I think the beginning is a history of proof of reserves. Nick covered that, then a taxonomy on what these terms are and how they apply to the auditing world. And then my bit was how to actually implement it, how an exchange can become compliant with the proof of reserves regime if they choose to do so, both with zero knowledge implementations for the liabilities as well as basic asset verification on chain. So that was brilliant.
00:26:58.022 - 00:27:00.910, Speaker B: I mean, that was so fascinating for me because it was pretty early, too.
00:27:00.942 - 00:27:03.686, Speaker A: This was again like 2021, 2020.
00:27:03.750 - 00:27:06.854, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Published it. 2021, maybe.
00:27:06.894 - 00:27:12.714, Speaker A: Yeah. But two, three years ago, obviously, since FTX in particular, this has become a big deal.
00:27:13.014 - 00:27:17.470, Speaker B: I mean, none of us are visionaries. We just looked at what happened in the last couple of years and said we should do something about this.
00:27:17.502 - 00:27:19.594, Speaker A: And it turns out we have the technology.
00:27:19.894 - 00:27:21.382, Speaker B: Nothing's really happened since.
00:27:21.478 - 00:27:32.174, Speaker A: Some are doing it. I agree. That's slow growing. There is an excellent that was introduced on the Senate by senators Tom Tillis and John Hickenlooper called the Proof act, which aims to move this specific ball forward.
00:27:32.254 - 00:27:35.094, Speaker B: It was HB 1666 from the Texas House that I helped write as well.
00:27:35.174 - 00:27:47.566, Speaker A: So that actually is law now, I think, in Texas. So hopefully that will result in, if you're a us crypto exchange that wants to service Texas, one of probably the largest markets, you would have to comply with that.
00:27:47.630 - 00:27:48.710, Speaker C: Well, the hope is that that bill.
00:27:48.742 - 00:27:53.096, Speaker B: Is a template that other states can just adopt and they should because we already done the work.
00:27:53.120 - 00:28:07.504, Speaker A: I just mean, it's sort of like GDPR in Europe, like if you're a global company and you got to implement it there. A lot of them just sort of implemented it everywhere and sort of maybe that will happen too. So we have a ways to go in terms of adoption of proof reserves. But what are you guys building at Hoseki?
00:28:07.664 - 00:28:15.768, Speaker B: So we're taking this concept of proof of reserves and exhausting it. So we want to financialize bitcoin. That's the objective.
00:28:15.816 - 00:28:16.168, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:16.256 - 00:28:47.340, Speaker B: And in order to do that, you have to have a robust system of property rights. Every advanced nation has a robust way to express ownership of your property. The example I paint is there's a great book, I'm blanking on the name now, but it talks about assets in the developing world. It talks about how people in Egypt, for instance, are actually quite rich in the assets they own. They just don't have a means to leverage them because they can't express ownership of the property rights. So here, for instance, when you buy real estate, you have to get title insurance because you have to verify that the person you're buying it from really owns the house.
00:28:47.412 - 00:28:50.448, Speaker A: Right. And the insurance is in case it turns out they didn't.
00:28:50.636 - 00:28:53.152, Speaker B: Okay, bitcoin, you don't need any of that.
00:28:53.208 - 00:28:54.760, Speaker A: Right? It's, you either do or you don't.
00:28:54.832 - 00:29:11.768, Speaker B: You can verify you own it both at the macro level and at the micro. So what's so unique about bitcoin, as opposed to any other asset class, is you can actually audit the entire supply to the smallest unit as a random third party. You don't have to have any special permissions. That doesn't apply to USD nor to gold. No one knows exactly how many dollars exists in the world, nor gold.
00:29:11.816 - 00:29:13.444, Speaker A: But yeah, USD definitely not.
00:29:13.744 - 00:29:24.532, Speaker B: But with certainty. You can add a bitcoin supply, but you can also do it at the micro level. You can verify to me mathematically, without any doubt, that you own x amount of bitcoin. That's very, very powerful.
00:29:24.628 - 00:29:41.304, Speaker A: And you can do it selectively because we're not account based. Also, of course, on Ethereum, you could have multiple accounts. But I can say, I just want to prove I own these coins. I'm not saying those are all the coins, but I am saying these ones I own, which is actually quite powerful too, because there's a privacy element as well.
00:29:41.924 - 00:30:16.350, Speaker B: We think this is. Frankly, it's not even like I want to see this happen. I think we need a system like this in order to really build this new monetary regime. If you're thinking about a bitcoin standard or something like that, if you don't want to have a credit system on top of it, then you're living in a very austere, potentially financially dark world that almost looks futile in practice. You need credit expansion, which I know bitcoiners are averse to. But frankly, we've all grown up in a sort of a QE, generations of QE systems.
00:30:16.382 - 00:30:54.294, Speaker A: I mean, even if we don't have, like, monetary base debasement. Monetary debasement, which is not what we're talking about lending and credit is growth. That's how a person with an idea, but not the capital to enact it, creates wealth. That's how they build. You know, if you're a farmer, you want to expand to the field over, well, you. You have the tractors and seeds for the current farm, but in order to farm that and generate more wealth, you need to borrow, typically to get another tractor and more seeds. Right? And eventually the proposition between you and the lender, or the investor as well, similar, is that you'll create more wealth than you borrowed and everyone will grow their wealth together.
00:30:54.294 - 00:30:56.198, Speaker A: Right? That's the basics of credit.
00:30:56.246 - 00:31:19.854, Speaker B: So we've really swung the other way in terms of, like, credit products. We're living in a world where you can, like, uber eats and pay later. So you have credit even for, like, the smallest things, like, yeah, getting. Getting a burger, which is extreme, to be clear, which is very extreme, and it's not healthy and it's not robust and it's very unstable. But if you don't have credit, you can't move up. You can move down, but you're stuck. Which is why I think it's quite futile.
00:31:19.854 - 00:31:32.758, Speaker B: Maybe that is what the future looks like. But we have to recognize it's very different than the world we live in today. And so I think having credit products that leverage bitcoin is critical for us to really have a functioning, robust economy in the future.
00:31:32.846 - 00:31:37.917, Speaker A: And so how does proof of reserves or verification work? How does that help that?
00:31:37.917 - 00:31:48.774, Speaker B: So, I mean, really, the most basic use case that we started with was, hey, man, I want to get a mortgage. I don't want to sell my bitcoin. I'd rather not. I'd rather just tell you I own x amount like every other asset that I have.
00:31:48.814 - 00:31:56.550, Speaker A: Right. Because they usually say, you go for a mortgage application, they say we need like the last three months of bank statements or like brokerage statements last 60 days. Yeah, just prove what you.
00:31:56.622 - 00:31:57.006, Speaker B: Assets.
00:31:57.070 - 00:32:02.846, Speaker A: Yeah, just prove what you have. That'll help the lender determine how much, but how big of a loan to give you.
00:32:02.910 - 00:32:05.502, Speaker B: Yeah, but try walking into a bank with a, with a cold card.
00:32:05.558 - 00:32:06.154, Speaker A: Right.
00:32:06.494 - 00:32:07.238, Speaker B: Or a treasure.
00:32:07.286 - 00:32:12.406, Speaker A: Dear sir, I swear, this bitcoin here on blockstream, dot in fo or mempool dot space, that's my bitcoin.
00:32:12.430 - 00:32:18.822, Speaker B: Sir, you can try to explain to them what signature verification is, but they're going to ask you to leave. Yeah, there aren't really good form factors.
00:32:18.878 - 00:32:21.294, Speaker A: Well, they have no mechanism to do it. Right.
00:32:21.374 - 00:32:25.942, Speaker B: And, you know, like, the broker's not going to try and figure out cryptographic verification on the fly.
00:32:25.998 - 00:32:27.838, Speaker A: Right. So if anything, they need someone to help them with.
00:32:27.886 - 00:32:33.412, Speaker B: So it's that or a screenshot of your treasure UI. But at the same time, I felt that was insulting. We're only cutting edge of finance.
00:32:33.508 - 00:32:37.540, Speaker A: I'm relegated to take. And of course, that can be forged. I mean, it's certainly not very good.
00:32:37.572 - 00:32:53.140, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So Hasekis building this platform that allows the tooling, that allows both the counterparty and the potential borrower to express ownership and verify ownership of their assets in order to leverage bitcoin and get credit, ultimately.
00:32:53.332 - 00:33:00.518, Speaker A: So I can say I have five bitcoin and I can you what, use the app to sign a message and prove that?
00:33:00.606 - 00:33:32.148, Speaker B: Yeah, a few different ways. So we have to integrate holistically. So we integrate from both the exchanges and wallets and also just on chain signature verification support. So depending on where your assets are, the counterparties, the organization on the platform can audit you. They'll send you an invitation, they'll come onto Hoseki, plug in your device, sign for different addresses, or log into your coinbase or other exchange account, and then you can selectively then share which assets you want to share with them always toggle it on and off. So data provisioning is built in cool. And they'll just see a clean view of you, the assets you're sharing with them.
00:33:32.148 - 00:33:37.292, Speaker B: And they can send things like subsequent verification, for instance, like proving ownership once means nothing necessarily.
00:33:37.428 - 00:33:40.140, Speaker A: It may mean something, but maybe you need it ongoing. Yeah.
00:33:40.212 - 00:33:50.426, Speaker B: If you have a loan for, let's say, 510 years, maybe the counterparty wants to verify you own this thing in perpetuity, every quarter, every month, whatever it is, easily send a request, you sign and they get the verification. I see.
00:33:50.450 - 00:34:04.374, Speaker A: This is very interesting because this is kind of like one of the criticisms I've seen about proof of reserves at the exchange level is like, well, they could just borrow the money, borrow the coins right before the auditor comes in, but that really only works on a one time basis.
00:34:04.714 - 00:34:18.194, Speaker B: And we were very adamant and very thoughtful about building this sort of clearinghouse model of bitcoin data ownership. So, for instance, if you sign for an address, no other user on the platform can claim ownership of the same address.
00:34:18.274 - 00:34:18.554, Speaker A: I see.
00:34:18.594 - 00:34:29.034, Speaker B: If you delete the address again, same thing. You can't add it for. I think we have, have the timeout to be like 60 days or something. So we, so we're basically mirroring the existing world and amplifying it and optimizing it with better technology.
00:34:29.114 - 00:34:47.658, Speaker A: It's very cool. And, and yes, I like you have exchanges. Some people store their bitcoins there or wherever they are, but it's really, really cool. I don't know of another asset where you could actually be self cut. I can't be like, here's a proof that I have these coins in my safe. Right, but bitcoin well, allows you to do that from, even from self custody.
00:34:47.746 - 00:35:04.366, Speaker B: People laughed at me when I first, when I, when I, when I was first pitching this idea because I kept saying I want to take the concept of proof of reserves that exists at the institutional level and bring it down to the, to the retail level because, I mean, I was told that on my own bank, right, but, but I can't borrow, I can't do anything as my own bank.
00:35:04.430 - 00:35:05.878, Speaker A: I can just store it or send it.
00:35:05.926 - 00:35:15.974, Speaker B: Right. I should be able to at least prove to someone else that I, that I, that I have these assets. So, so we think, again, this is just the, the sort of foundation for this new monetary paradigm.
00:35:16.014 - 00:35:23.950, Speaker A: That's very cool. So then what? Like other mortgages, but then maybe other types of collateral verification.
00:35:24.102 - 00:35:32.622, Speaker B: The whole credit industry, really. There's some education that we've been fortunate enough to experience to, like, visas and passport applications.
00:35:32.678 - 00:35:32.894, Speaker A: Again.
00:35:32.934 - 00:35:42.046, Speaker B: So really in the Caribbean, that's interesting. But again, the same thing. They just have to prove that they own assets, they own financial assets. And if you have bitcoin, if you have crypto, you just don't have a good way of doing it.
00:35:42.070 - 00:36:08.012, Speaker A: There's a global asset. I mean, you can think about plenty of different use cases and sentiments about it. Bitcoin all around the world. You know, if you're in Turkey, then your bitcoins at an all time high against Valiro or in Argentina, maybe you store your wealth there. If you're working with the Human Rights foundation, then you're using bitcoin maybe to, like, censor censorship, resistantly pay activists who, or help them fund their activism. Right. There's many uses, but it is global.
00:36:08.012 - 00:36:13.536, Speaker A: But no matter what use, it is global. So, like, there's. I mean, there could be many reasons. Yeah.
00:36:13.560 - 00:36:30.544, Speaker B: So I've been fortunate enough to travel a lot of the world and see how this could be applicable in different places for several different reasons. And I think that some of when I talk to american bitcoiners, a lot of them are missing that context. They see it purely as an investment, but they're missing the almost, like, survival element of this asset.
00:36:30.584 - 00:36:40.060, Speaker A: Because you talked about property rights being so important. It is. It's one of the main reasons the US economy and capital markets are so vibrant. It's also our legal system and our.
00:36:40.092 - 00:36:41.428, Speaker B: Property rights have a legal framework. Yeah, exactly.
00:36:41.476 - 00:36:56.772, Speaker A: If you're in a country with very weak property rights where you know, a dictator or just anyone official can just take your home, or there's no. Even if they're not going to take it, if there's no verifiable, trusted paper trail to prove ownership, something like bitcoin could be extremely.
00:36:56.828 - 00:37:00.428, Speaker B: It's the same narrative as inflation. Uh, you just can't plan, you can't save.
00:37:00.516 - 00:37:00.788, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:00.836 - 00:37:02.124, Speaker B: And ultimately, you can't move up.
00:37:02.244 - 00:37:19.030, Speaker A: Very interesting. Okay, couple other interesting sort of things bubbling in my head when we talk about this final message. Remember this thing Odell used to do? It was kind of like a dead man switch, kind of like a covenant. It was like, I think for his, it was send bitcoin. If I don't come in and update the.
00:37:19.062 - 00:37:20.478, Speaker B: It was like an alive signal and then.
00:37:20.526 - 00:37:22.958, Speaker A: Yeah, you like broadcast. You basically keep broadening.
00:37:23.046 - 00:37:23.702, Speaker C: Right.
00:37:23.878 - 00:37:24.566, Speaker A: Is that.
00:37:24.670 - 00:37:25.126, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:37:25.150 - 00:37:26.034, Speaker A: Is that a thing?
00:37:26.694 - 00:37:28.070, Speaker B: I don't know if he still has it up.
00:37:28.182 - 00:37:34.766, Speaker A: I don't think it is up. But can you use covenants for that. Is that the type of thing you could like, like something?
00:37:34.830 - 00:37:40.838, Speaker B: Because you can build that agnostic to the bitcoin protocol and just trigger a transaction broadcast if it doesn't receive a message. Yeah, you can totally do that.
00:37:40.886 - 00:37:41.398, Speaker A: Yeah. That's interesting.
00:37:41.446 - 00:37:46.222, Speaker B: There were some, I can't remember now exactly, but lightning had some sort of construct around this too.
00:37:46.278 - 00:38:08.176, Speaker A: That's cool. By the way, can exchanges, you're building this now for retail collateral verification primarily. Is there going to be a boom in, I mean, if this, the HB in Texas, becomes widely adopted or if the Senate bill, the proof act, becomes law? Like, won't there be a boom in proof of reserves?
00:38:08.280 - 00:38:23.408, Speaker B: So we're not retail focused. We were in the beginning. So the evolution of Haseki was first, it was very primitive. It was, let me print a statement that has a Hasci letterhead, my name and address, and the assets I want approve ownership of because the broker, the lender, wants to see something.
00:38:23.456 - 00:38:25.904, Speaker A: And then like Hoseki can be like, we did actually verify this.
00:38:25.944 - 00:38:40.794, Speaker B: Exactly. Customer service line email makes them more comfortable. So that was our first product. But quickly we realized that in order to scale the business, we need to actually target both sides, primarily partnering with institutions. So yeah, we're already seeing a lot of demand from institutions about transparency.
00:38:40.874 - 00:38:41.146, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:38:41.170 - 00:38:57.304, Speaker B: I was skeptical because the whole issue with proof of reserves historically has been the demand and the requirement angle. So, one, customers of exchanges historically and normally aren't really demanding them to be transparent in any real way. And two, they're not required to, to be.
00:38:57.384 - 00:38:59.056, Speaker A: There's no rule mandating it. Right.
00:38:59.080 - 00:39:10.912, Speaker B: And they don't want to be too open about their outflows if they can or if they can help it. So that's always been the issue. But we're actually seeing a lot of demand now from exchanges and other institutions about being public. Interesting. We think it's more of a marketing angle from them, which is fine.
00:39:10.968 - 00:39:14.008, Speaker A: Well. Cause it's kind of a hot, again, since FTX. It's, it is a hot issue.
00:39:14.056 - 00:39:17.072, Speaker B: You have to differentiate yourself. What makes you different today than that? You know?
00:39:17.128 - 00:39:26.204, Speaker A: Yeah. You hear that Dan Maciszewski from CMS? It is a hot issue, Dan. He's skeptical. Not that it's good, just that anyone cares. They do care, Dan.
00:39:26.784 - 00:39:31.368, Speaker B: I just think it has to happen. I don't exactly know the time horizon. I'd like it to happen sooner rather than later.
00:39:31.416 - 00:39:32.008, Speaker A: Me too.
00:39:32.136 - 00:39:33.728, Speaker B: But it has to happen because.
00:39:33.896 - 00:39:35.016, Speaker A: Seems like a no brainer.
00:39:35.080 - 00:39:44.084, Speaker B: Well, we have the tooling to be transparent. And again, it's just a better financial infrastructure. It's better financial infrastructure than what we have today.
00:39:44.784 - 00:40:28.726, Speaker A: Before we end, let's talk a little bit about bitcoin culture and the future of bitcoin. Sam, you've seen a lot of the phases of bitcoin, participate in them. I mean, I think about how you were thankfully extricated from the clutches of the Algorand foundation, but you've worked at Fidelity, you're a startup founder. You've worked on bitcoin technologies and crypto technologies. There's an interesting debate happening in the bitcoin community about the future of bitcoin, as there always is, by the way. But I think spurred on in particular this year because of the rise of inscriptions and ordinals, now people have nfts on bitcoin. Then some other degenerates made a way to do fungible tokens on bitcoin.
00:40:28.726 - 00:40:58.566, Speaker A: And that's driven a lot, I think $175 million in fees alone just from inscription activity paid to miners this year. It sort of raises this long term question. Is bitcoin a technology platform for application development, whereas bitcoin a monetary asset? It obviously is both, but there's two camps. They say it should only be one or the other, or it should be all of them, or. What's your view on this just broadly and doesn't matter? I don't know.
00:40:58.630 - 00:41:29.548, Speaker B: I don't really think it does. I think it will be both. I think it'll primarily be a monetary network that has some ancillary application development on top of it, but I think mainly it'll be a monetary network. You know, I really, like, run the gamut, man. I was completely ignorant when I first started, became very dogmatic, and now I'm kind of just more of a moderate where, you know, I think it's important to. Well, so I wasn't around during the block size wars, right. I was in the space, but I didn't have enough context, really understand what was going on.
00:41:29.548 - 00:42:00.152, Speaker B: So I think this is probably somewhat similar. I'm a capitalist, so if there's demand for something, then there's demand for something. And if people are willing to pay for it, then they're willing to pay for it. If it's functional, then it's functional, which is what I think the current ordinal sort of space looks like. I just think it's important not to. How do I say this? People tend to make bitcoin their identity, which I can't think of a better. I can't think of an analogy, there's.
00:42:00.168 - 00:42:32.082, Speaker A: An interesting, my friend Dennis Porto characterized it this way. There's a concept called the zeal of the convertible. You look at religions, for example, particularly like newer sects of religions, they tend to get increasingly more dogmatic. And it's sort of like I just found out about bitcoin, and now I'm here to defend it, not here to not even save it. It's sort of like in communities, the newest entrants tend to be the most aggressive. Right. And the most close minded, frankly.
00:42:32.178 - 00:42:37.570, Speaker B: But it's been around at least four years of extreme bitcoin. Extreme core contingent of.
00:42:37.642 - 00:42:55.986, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I really think that it was pretty the current we call monetary maximalism. And again, really not necessarily taking sides on this issue. And just sort of my view on the current dominant culture in bitcoin is that it really exploded during COVID That was when you had clubhouse and there was nothing else to do but listen to bitcoin podcasts.
00:42:56.050 - 00:42:56.730, Speaker B: Such a nightmare.
00:42:56.802 - 00:42:57.498, Speaker A: It was the best.
00:42:57.546 - 00:42:59.266, Speaker B: Dude, you loved it. You were all over it.
00:42:59.290 - 00:42:59.974, Speaker A: I did.
00:43:00.314 - 00:43:01.538, Speaker B: But you've had a good radio voice.
00:43:01.626 - 00:43:17.064, Speaker A: Thank you so much. I've been called the James Earl Jones of bitcoin. Even after the block size wars, obviously it emanates from, because the block size wars was also a dispute sort of about a similar idea, I would say less about applications.
00:43:17.484 - 00:43:20.988, Speaker B: Platform in retrospect seemed existential, or it seemed like it was.
00:43:21.036 - 00:43:29.060, Speaker A: Yeah, it was more about like payments and speed versus like, you know, fidelity of the network. And obviously the small blockers prevailed with bitcoin.
00:43:29.132 - 00:43:42.420, Speaker B: Well, I mean, I think it's similar in the sense that you have, you have tech folks that are very opinionated about how it should work, but then you have demand from other people about what they want. And I think the tech folks went out during the block size wars, which was good.
00:43:42.492 - 00:44:11.364, Speaker A: Well, and a lot of people too, like that had, I mean, think about Vitalik Buterin, right. I mean, he wanted to make bitcoin more expressive. That was rejected by the community. So they went and created Ethereum. I mean, and there was many such cases even before the block size wars, because it was common knowledge and agreed upon, I would say was mainstream culture in bitcoin before Ethereum that anything great and Altcoin came up with would one day be incorporated into bitcoin. We know that hasn't happened though, right? Like that. That view is longer the dominant view in bitcoin, but maybe it's ascendant again.
00:44:11.404 - 00:44:15.692, Speaker B: Well, no, I think people still hold that view that eventually we'll come back to bitcoin. But again, I don't know how realistic that is.
00:44:15.748 - 00:44:42.092, Speaker A: Well, it just definitely, it still may be possible for sure. I think it's, I think it was about almost if last year and the year before, it felt almost like a 0% chance that that would happen. Well, now I think it's the chances rising again that it will happen, but it definitely hasn't happened. Right. I mean, all the stuff defined and nfts and whatnot that people built in other cryptos did not in fact come to bitcoin. Really. It's not the base layer.
00:44:42.148 - 00:44:52.476, Speaker B: Well, and I think what's important here too, I mean, I've been fortunate. I mean, before, it's not the right word. I've got the scars of having gone to Ethereum conferences, xxx and also bitcoin conferences. The cultures are very different.
00:44:52.540 - 00:44:52.900, Speaker A: Very different.
00:44:52.932 - 00:44:56.988, Speaker B: When you go to an Ethereum conference, there's a lot of. And I mean, it's in a literal sense, colors.
00:44:57.076 - 00:44:57.652, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:44:57.788 - 00:45:09.988, Speaker B: It's very optimistic and playful. When you go to a bitcoin conference, it's like, dude, we're here to take down the fucking system. So. And that has effects on what the system itself can do.
00:45:10.036 - 00:45:26.574, Speaker A: Yeah. But there are some really interesting developments. I think inscriptions and ordinals are quite interesting. I think generally there's this thing, bit vm, have you seen this thing? Quite interesting. Again, a discovery, effectively a discovery. Wait a second. We can do much more robust scripting right now.
00:45:26.574 - 00:45:44.778, Speaker A: People are figuring out how to use it, but it doesn't require any upgrade. And there's enhanced, I would say this, your interest in new layers, new types of L2 networks, several teams building sovereign roll ups that will sort of have similar functionality to the roll ups in the ethereum world on bitcoin.
00:45:44.906 - 00:45:59.226, Speaker B: So, I mean, how I approach this personally and how we approach as a company is we're bitcoiners. Like, I genuinely don't hold anything else but bitcoin. Um, not, not because I. Not really, because I don't want to. It's just the thing I understand the most. I don't understand synthetic assets. I don't come from finance.
00:45:59.226 - 00:46:21.794, Speaker B: Bitcoin. I have no questions about bitcoin. It makes, it makes sense to me. I'm comfortable. I'm comfortable leveraging that and putting my entire life into it effectively. But I'm not, at least anymore, I'm not dogmatic about it. It's not at the core of my soul, it's money, which is incredibly necessary for the world.
00:46:21.794 - 00:46:32.156, Speaker B: And I think this monetary paradigm will change the world. I don't know if it's going to be for the better or for the worse, but it's going to change the world. I know that and I want to be a part of it, but it's not a moral imperative.
00:46:32.250 - 00:46:35.576, Speaker A: Yeah, let's hope it is for the better. I know people like you guys are working to make it so.
00:46:35.640 - 00:46:36.608, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:46:36.696 - 00:46:38.960, Speaker A: 2024 going to be a big year for Hoseci, dude.
00:46:39.032 - 00:46:52.376, Speaker B: Q one is going to be a big year for Hosegi. Yeah, we've got a lot of announcements. We just brought Xander Karpusis on board from strike. We got another big announcement coming up in a couple months, so. Yeah, stay tuned. We're at hoseciapp on Twitter.
