As I said, michael, Mark Antonio from Galaxy is our guest. We're going to talk with Michael about dows, about NFT licensing, about MEV, and a bunch of other interesting topics before we.
00:01:06.232 - 00:01:34.324, Speaker A: Of course, we're going to check with our good friend Bim net, a BB from Galaxy trading. As always, talk markets. Look at bitcoin on a massive tear up over like 30 or 33% since its cycle bottom. Its yearly bottom of 38 five in just 23 days. Crazy, crazy price action. We're going to get into it with Bim net. Before we get to that, I need to remind you to please refer to link to disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities.
00:01:34.324 - 00:01:52.568, Speaker A: Phineas, it's cold in New York. It feels like winter. Finally. It was like 50 or 60 degrees a few days ago, but today in the thirties and a big snowstorm, we were told. Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't say big snowstorm. We got some snow. I mean, every flight was canceled.
00:01:52.568 - 00:02:02.232, Speaker A: There was hysteria. The mayor begged people to stay in their homes. But there's no snow on the ground. Look, it happens every year.
00:02:02.368 - 00:02:03.120, Speaker B: We freak out.
00:02:03.152 - 00:02:13.320, Speaker A: I think it's more. It's a wink wink so everybody gets a snow day and can stay home. Well, this is what I want to bring up to you, because I read that New York public schools did not get a snow day.
00:02:13.512 - 00:02:13.896, Speaker C: Oh, really?
00:02:13.920 - 00:02:54.394, Speaker A: They forced everyone to do remote learning, which is unpleasant. I was talking with an Uber driver. He told me that his six year old daughter, who's in first grade, had to spend six and a half hours on zoom. It's such a difficult problem. You know, remote work make, I mean, remote school makes sense in the same way that remote work makes sense. But gotta be tough on the kids. Does it make sense for a six year old child to spend 6 hours on Zoom instead of outside throwing snowballs and making snow angels and snowmen? I mean, what has the world come to, sir? Maybe for, you know, older kids, I get it, but does a first grader really need to be doing that? You learn more doing that outside than you do on Zoom.
00:02:54.394 - 00:03:03.586, Speaker A: I was very upset. Snow days were a rite of passage. All right, for me too. My gosh, we had snow days. Exactly. Pretty frequently. Yeah, it was always so fun.
00:03:03.586 - 00:03:23.604, Speaker A: And they add, they pay for more days in order to cover for those. I mean, look, if you're gonna cancel the snow days, I think the taxpayers want that money back for those extra days. I just, I'm very sad about this. As a parent, I would never allow my child to do six and a half hours of zoom. I'm with you. All right, let's not get upset. We got a great episode.
00:03:23.604 - 00:03:31.452, Speaker A: Let's get right into it. Let's go now to our friend Bim Netabeebe from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains. Thank you for coming.
00:03:31.508 - 00:03:32.460, Speaker D: Thanks for having me.
00:03:32.572 - 00:03:35.628, Speaker A: Wow. Yes, wow. I can really say wow.
00:03:35.756 - 00:03:36.284, Speaker B: Speechless.
00:03:36.324 - 00:04:08.336, Speaker A: Speaker one, I was looking at the. So over the weekend we ran up into 48, 49 territory, Monday we crossed 50, then CPI comes out, which we'll talk to on Tuesday morning. All the risk comes off a bit. Bitcoin comes off, frankly less or finishes the day down less than equities, but you kind of get a BARt pattern. But then we just rocket right back up and now we're at yearly highs again. I mean, what is it, 51 six over our shoulder, but it's been as high as 52, a little bit above 52. I don't know what that pattern is.
00:04:08.336 - 00:04:15.198, Speaker A: The up bart down and then like rocket again. I mean, what's going on with the relentless bid on bitcoin?
00:04:15.336 - 00:05:09.708, Speaker D: Just passive ETF inflows and they have been more than material and well above anyone's expectations. And then what's happening is folks are seeing these figures and then trying to front run or anticipate what future inflows are going to look like. And so folks are buying spot bitcoin. They're buying options, upside structures, fresh, all time high stuff, crazy. And on top of that, S and P and Nasdaq are still only like a couple of percent off all time highs. The broader risk background, even with rates selling off after CPI, is still constructive and healthy. And so what you just have, what you're seeing happen is a ton of passive inflows into a product that has limited supply into a product that has a supply catalyst.
00:05:09.708 - 00:05:11.844, Speaker D: Coming up in two to three months.
00:05:11.884 - 00:05:17.372, Speaker A: Is what happens when growing or massive demand smashes against immutable scarcity.
00:05:17.508 - 00:06:24.264, Speaker D: Exactly. And to be honest, for me, I look at the short term stuff a lot, but it's really hard not to think about the big picture implications now of just what will years and years of passive inflows, all these asset managers that now have bitcoin on their platforms, what the outcome of that is going to be, let's say, 510 years from now in terms of bitcoin prices. And my mind has a hard time grasping that. I think it comes down to this concept, which is human brains are generally bad at understanding tail scenarios like 5% probability or less. And so thinking about bitcoin price going up 100, 200% is like, it's hard just functionally for the brain. But more and more I find myself in that area, and it's the first time in a while where I wake up and I'm scared that bitcoin's run away from me before I've gotten a chance to accumulate more.
00:06:24.344 - 00:06:46.484, Speaker A: I know I woke up. This was a common feeling during the 2020 and 21 to bull market when it was like, even in 17, I remember this, too. Wake up during that market and be like, what happened while I was asleep? And first thing you look at your phone and there were days where it's just like, up, two, three, five, 8%. When you wake, you're like, what happened?
00:06:46.564 - 00:07:01.074, Speaker D: No, I mean, you're like, I wasn't bullish enough. Take for example, sailors flows when he's buying, and he was buying a yard over a month or two months, and the ETF inflows are like a yard in three days now.
00:07:01.154 - 00:07:02.458, Speaker A: Yeah, it's wild.
00:07:02.506 - 00:07:07.266, Speaker D: And the math is just like, the supply is just getting taken out of the market.
00:07:07.370 - 00:07:43.490, Speaker A: Yeah, I think you said it earlier. Really? No one? Well, not no one, but a lot of people in this short time period really did not expect this. I think everybody is kind of frankly blown away by the magnitude of the ETF inflows. We had thought and we talked about this, that after the initial seed in internal capital went in, there was a period where we were struggling to see, like, we didn't think the advisor platforms were going to turn on yet. They still haven't. The having was still three, four months away, sort of struggling. And we talked about this and I mean, Bitcoin did go down to 38 five.
00:07:43.490 - 00:08:05.364, Speaker A: I think we thought, I thought at the time that it would go a little lower and stay there for a little longer. But then over the last 22 days it's up 35%. And now it's like the, these ETF's are mostly being bought on retail brokerage platforms, correct. Not just by like small dollar retail investors. Big investors can go there too.
00:08:05.484 - 00:08:11.428, Speaker D: And you're going to see those which big investors bought because of 13 f filings for the first time.
00:08:11.476 - 00:08:16.464, Speaker A: Yeah, one of those it depends March April area.
00:08:16.804 - 00:08:18.636, Speaker B: So it's like we had sort of.
00:08:18.660 - 00:08:36.530, Speaker A: Said, like, it feels like a crab market until the platforms really turn on the access these vehicles. And obviously it's bullish. So we're sort of like, it's crab to bullish. But now you're looking at these flows and saying, wait a sec, is like the baseline a lot more bullish. And then what happens if it gets really bullish?
00:08:36.642 - 00:08:48.034, Speaker D: Exactly. And it's also a function of just that positive price convexity and the positive price feedback loop where it's like, oh shit, bitcoin's price is going up.
00:08:48.074 - 00:08:48.654, Speaker B: Why?
00:08:49.034 - 00:09:06.834, Speaker D: People ask why? And they come to the conclusion it's these ETF inflows. And then they do the math. They're like, holy shit, this could go a lot higher. And then the price keeps going higher and more and more folks buy into the rationale and becomes this spiraling feedback loop.
00:09:06.914 - 00:09:13.042, Speaker A: Real quick, just on CPI, it came in, I guess the analysts were saying.
00:09:13.098 - 00:09:45.268, Speaker D: It came in hotter than expected. And the Fed's measures of, the Fed's preferred measures of supercore CPI were also really hot. There were some seasonal elements to it. This was a January print. And there's a lot of like year end price hikes that get processed in that data. And so it might be a little distorted, but overall, it doesn't seem like the Fed got what it needed to really get more aggressive in terms of easing or the language around easing. And so that has shaken markets a little bit.
00:09:45.268 - 00:10:23.894, Speaker D: And the fallout from that is still to be determined because you still have a lot of data between now and the March f one c meeting. But long story short, you've seen a dramatic repricing of the interest rate market over the past, since the start of the year, where you've priced out a ton of cuts and you're now much closer to what the Fed expects in their dot plot, at least, which is two to three cuts. And so now you're kind of getting to the sweet spot where it might actually make sense that things go back the other way because I don't think we're in a hiking cycle again, but I think it is still appropriate to kind of.
00:10:24.954 - 00:10:30.338, Speaker A: Okay, well, Bim netabeebeat, my friend from Galaxy trading. Thank you, as always. We'll let you get back to the desk.
00:10:30.426 - 00:10:30.730, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:10:30.762 - 00:10:31.534, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:10:33.194 - 00:10:39.106, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guests. Michael Marcantonio, director at Galaxy. Michael, thank you for coming back to Galaxy brands.
00:10:39.170 - 00:10:40.002, Speaker B: Thank you, Alex.
00:10:40.058 - 00:10:44.178, Speaker A: Appreciate it. You haven't been on since we started video, so this is the first time.
00:10:44.226 - 00:10:46.594, Speaker B: It's the first video, yeah. I've always had a face for radio.
00:10:46.674 - 00:10:51.698, Speaker A: But I, but people say that we look similar. I actually shaved a little bit.
00:10:51.866 - 00:11:01.570, Speaker B: We got it a little bit. Well, it's because we typically are style matches, sneakers black. But today we're diverging slightly.
00:11:01.642 - 00:11:02.858, Speaker A: So, Michael.
00:11:02.906 - 00:11:03.082, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:11:03.098 - 00:11:33.376, Speaker A: You were last on. We had published a report about NFT licensing, and you also talked about, I think at the time, this was maybe like a summer 2022 episode that we did. And we talked about rider rips and some of the legal issues around NFTs. We're gonna get into that a little bit, but I wanna talk about a couple other things about it. But first, you've got a pretty fascinating story, how you got to working on crypto. You're a lawyer, you've worked in big law. Tell a little bit of that story.
00:11:33.560 - 00:11:52.320, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, so when I graduated law school, I basically, I think there's a quote from Bill Clinton that said he walked out of law school running for office. And that's what I wanted to do. But I got some advice around the time that that's a terrible idea because, and probably it's because the game has changed.
00:11:52.352 - 00:11:52.496, Speaker C: Right?
00:11:52.520 - 00:12:21.978, Speaker B: When Bill Clinton was graduating law school, he was going to Arkansas and he was able to run an attorney general campaign and like, a shoestring budget with no money. I'm getting out of law school, have no money, have no access to connections, you know, no connections, no access to capital. And you need that apparently, as I learned running for office. So I did the big law thing. I worked at Kirkland and Ellis, a big law firm, did mergers and acquisitions there. Loved it. It was great.
00:12:21.978 - 00:12:36.226, Speaker B: But then a couple years in, I got an opportunity to run for the New York state assembly, and I took a leave of absence from Kirkland, and I ran. This was round one. Should we get into this? Do you want to get into this?
00:12:36.250 - 00:12:36.706, Speaker A: Kind of.
00:12:36.770 - 00:12:37.754, Speaker B: It's kind of an interesting story.
00:12:37.794 - 00:12:38.666, Speaker A: Tell the story.
00:12:38.850 - 00:12:50.722, Speaker B: So I. I immediately, from my connections at Kn E and, you know, just being a lawyer, I raised over 100 grand out the gate.
00:12:50.778 - 00:12:52.146, Speaker A: That's enough to get started for that race.
00:12:52.210 - 00:13:01.306, Speaker B: Right. That's for a New York state assembly race. That's a lot. And I was running against a 20 year incumbent.
00:13:01.370 - 00:13:02.014, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:02.554 - 00:13:16.660, Speaker B: I was running as a Democrat. He was a Republican. And just a little something about New York state politics is if you're bit a Republican in the New York State assembly, you have no power because they have almost a permanent majority in the assembly.
00:13:16.732 - 00:13:16.916, Speaker C: Right.
00:13:16.940 - 00:13:21.044, Speaker B: And the assembly is the equivalent in New York state of the House of Representatives.
00:13:21.084 - 00:13:21.260, Speaker C: Right.
00:13:21.292 - 00:13:22.492, Speaker B: So it's just majoritarian.
00:13:22.548 - 00:13:23.052, Speaker A: Right.
00:13:23.188 - 00:13:29.364, Speaker B: So I was going against this guy big time. This was 2018. I was railing against this guy for just doing nothing.
00:13:29.444 - 00:13:29.828, Speaker C: Right.
00:13:29.916 - 00:13:34.956, Speaker B: Which, frankly, was his custom. Right. He collected a paycheck, did almost nothing all the time.
00:13:34.980 - 00:13:37.318, Speaker A: And to your point, you're saying there wasn't much he could have done anyway.
00:13:37.436 - 00:13:40.610, Speaker B: Nothing he could have done anyway. Can't even blame the guy. Even though.
00:13:40.642 - 00:13:41.226, Speaker A: But he didn't do anything.
00:13:41.250 - 00:13:41.850, Speaker B: But he didn't do anything.
00:13:41.882 - 00:13:42.098, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:13:42.146 - 00:13:43.474, Speaker B: And there was real problems.
00:13:43.514 - 00:13:43.834, Speaker C: Right.
00:13:43.914 - 00:13:46.186, Speaker B: Like, I was running on very local issues.
00:13:46.250 - 00:13:46.498, Speaker C: Right.
00:13:46.546 - 00:13:48.602, Speaker B: I was running on, like, fixing potholes.
00:13:48.658 - 00:13:49.090, Speaker C: Right.
00:13:49.202 - 00:13:56.130, Speaker B: Lowering taxes, fixing our, like, energy system on Long island, which is. Won't get into, but it's a mess anyway.
00:13:56.202 - 00:13:56.854, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:57.154 - 00:14:16.516, Speaker B: Dropped the $100,000 number that I raised. He immediately sues me. Sues me for what? I'm like. What is he suing me about? To kick me off the ballot. The claim that he made was that I was ineligible to run for office. Now, just some background about me. I have been a New Yorker my entire life.
00:14:16.516 - 00:14:23.436, Speaker B: I was born in Huntington Hospital on Long island. I've lived in New York my whole life. I did go to Duke law school down in North Carolina.
00:14:23.500 - 00:14:25.144, Speaker A: Oh, big Duke is puke.
00:14:27.804 - 00:14:32.394, Speaker B: And as a student, there's. I voted on campus.
00:14:32.514 - 00:14:33.214, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:33.594 - 00:14:41.434, Speaker B: Which you have a right to do. There's a US Supreme Court case, simvi of the United States, that gives students a right to vote on campus.
00:14:41.474 - 00:14:44.570, Speaker A: What does that mean, vote on campus? You mean vote for a statewide office or national.
00:14:44.602 - 00:14:47.154, Speaker B: So, like, I'm registered to vote in New York, and you could do that.
00:14:47.194 - 00:14:50.770, Speaker A: Vote at a voting polling center. On campus.
00:14:50.842 - 00:14:57.964, Speaker B: Then I go to Duke and they have all these people running around with, hey, register here to vote. So I do it.
00:14:58.004 - 00:14:58.300, Speaker C: Right.
00:14:58.372 - 00:15:01.692, Speaker A: But you could have voted absentee back in New York. Could have. So you voted there.
00:15:01.828 - 00:15:05.564, Speaker B: But I'm there, can vote on campus. I want to be part of the community.
00:15:05.684 - 00:15:06.036, Speaker C: Right.
00:15:06.100 - 00:15:07.772, Speaker A: And you didn't also vote in both cases?
00:15:07.788 - 00:15:09.796, Speaker B: I did not vote in New York. I only voted in course.
00:15:09.820 - 00:15:10.932, Speaker A: Yeah, totally able to do that.
00:15:11.028 - 00:15:14.068, Speaker B: So I graduate two years later.
00:15:14.156 - 00:15:14.380, Speaker C: Right.
00:15:14.412 - 00:15:15.892, Speaker B: This was like my very first year.
00:15:15.948 - 00:15:16.556, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:15:16.700 - 00:15:37.226, Speaker B: And the New York state courts, highest court in the state hands down a ruling which says that if you vote out of state for, you know, the facts of that case were about an employee, but it was pretty general. If you vote out of state, you sever the five continuous years you need to be a resident of the state in order to run for office.
00:15:37.250 - 00:15:41.834, Speaker A: So they're claiming that you have to then come back live in New York for five years before you can run for office.
00:15:41.874 - 00:15:51.810, Speaker B: Well, the worst part about it was they never clarified in this case. When you sever how long, at what point do you re initiate your residency.
00:15:51.842 - 00:15:52.058, Speaker C: Right.
00:15:52.106 - 00:16:00.842, Speaker A: When you drive your busted car back up from North Carolina and you cross over that bridge like, you know, the George. Whatever the bridge is. And from Jersey to New York, what.
00:16:00.858 - 00:16:08.234, Speaker B: They didn't say was, well, you have to re register to vote in New York because then that, what that would mean is that only registered voters can run for office. Which is actually not true.
00:16:08.274 - 00:16:08.898, Speaker C: Right, right.
00:16:09.026 - 00:16:32.412, Speaker B: So what they basically said is you severed it. So we don't know when the clock restarts, but it's gotta be five years from whenever it starts, but you're kicked off the ballot. Now there's a legal problem here, which is that by exercising one right, namely to vote on campus, as codified by, you know, as promulgated by the US Supreme Court, you were vitiating or undermining another right that you have, which is to run for office.
00:16:32.508 - 00:16:32.908, Speaker C: Right.
00:16:32.996 - 00:16:33.748, Speaker B: How can that be?
00:16:33.796 - 00:16:34.700, Speaker C: Can't be, right?
00:16:34.852 - 00:16:42.212, Speaker B: So I lose 1st, 1st round. Boom. So you're stunned, right? I'm sitting there in court just like.
00:16:42.228 - 00:16:45.384, Speaker A: A localish court, right? This is like local. You're not the New York, it's called.
00:16:45.764 - 00:16:47.580, Speaker B: The Supreme Court, but it's the lowest court in New York state.
00:16:47.612 - 00:16:48.068, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:16:48.156 - 00:16:56.766, Speaker A: And they're different in every state, I think in Massachusetts, what the superior court I think maybe is the. I can't remember. Or the supreme judicial Court is the Supreme Court of Massachusetts. I forget.
00:16:56.950 - 00:17:03.182, Speaker B: Stunned, right? I'm like fuck this. I'm gonna appeal it. I appeal it to the intermediary court.
00:17:03.238 - 00:17:03.834, Speaker C: Right?
00:17:05.694 - 00:17:10.278, Speaker B: I hire a big time lawyer. We go all out. We have all of our arguments.
00:17:10.326 - 00:17:10.990, Speaker C: Right?
00:17:11.182 - 00:17:14.966, Speaker B: Like, he's a student. There should be an exception for students voting on campus.
00:17:14.990 - 00:17:16.054, Speaker A: It's obviously ridiculous.
00:17:16.134 - 00:17:28.188, Speaker B: It's ridiculous, right? Incidentally, by the way, two other cases were going on at that time, both students. So they were using this new court decision to basically churn students off the ballot.
00:17:28.236 - 00:17:28.396, Speaker C: Right?
00:17:28.420 - 00:17:34.164, Speaker B: It's crazy. I lose in the intermediate court. I appeal it to the court of Appeals.
00:17:34.204 - 00:17:34.876, Speaker A: Let's go.
00:17:35.020 - 00:17:40.164, Speaker B: And I'm like, all right, I'm a lawyer. I know this case better than everyone. I'm gonna argue it myself.
00:17:40.324 - 00:17:40.996, Speaker A: Wow.
00:17:41.140 - 00:17:42.628, Speaker B: So I go up.
00:17:42.676 - 00:17:44.588, Speaker A: That doesn't surprise me at all. I did not know this.
00:17:44.716 - 00:18:01.826, Speaker B: I go up and I argued myself. And unfortunately, I had to argue for the right to actually argue. So I had to do two arguments, but they wouldn't even hear me. So they denied me on the first argument.
00:18:01.890 - 00:18:03.242, Speaker A: They wouldn't let you represent yourself?
00:18:03.338 - 00:18:07.666, Speaker B: Well, not that they wouldn't let me represent yourself. They wouldn't let you be heard because they have discretion. They're like the US Supreme Court.
00:18:07.690 - 00:18:07.850, Speaker C: Right?
00:18:07.882 - 00:18:15.540, Speaker B: They have discretion as to what case. And I argued, you know, this is a actually very important case because, like, this is happening to two other people.
00:18:15.692 - 00:18:16.412, Speaker C: Right?
00:18:16.588 - 00:18:17.556, Speaker B: So I get kicked off.
00:18:17.620 - 00:18:17.964, Speaker C: Right?
00:18:18.044 - 00:18:18.748, Speaker B: Devastated.
00:18:18.836 - 00:18:19.084, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:19.124 - 00:18:25.972, Speaker B: Because this is 2018. It's the blue wave. My opponent is so worried about me.
00:18:26.068 - 00:18:27.276, Speaker A: That he's dumbass, that this is the.
00:18:27.300 - 00:18:27.892, Speaker B: Only thing he's doing.
00:18:27.908 - 00:18:28.804, Speaker A: You think he's vulnerable. Yeah.
00:18:28.844 - 00:18:30.852, Speaker B: But not only that, I felt a massive injustice.
00:18:30.908 - 00:18:31.100, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:31.132 - 00:18:33.052, Speaker B: Like, I did all the right things.
00:18:33.108 - 00:18:33.324, Speaker C: Right?
00:18:33.364 - 00:18:43.516, Speaker B: I went to law school. I voted on campus. Like they tell you to do, right? They didn't even. They didn't. By the way, when I voted at the time, this rule wasn't in effect, so they retroactively applied it to me.
00:18:43.540 - 00:18:43.964, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:44.084 - 00:19:01.684, Speaker B: So fast forward real quick. I run again in 2020 because two months after the guy kicked me off the ballot, two months, he's like, you know what? I'm retired. He quits. He quits in the middle of his term. So I'm like, all right, throw my hat in the ring again, 2020. But this time it's an open seat. So it's a special election.
00:19:01.724 - 00:19:03.684, Speaker A: Shouldn't be like you versus other Democrats. Most likely.
00:19:03.764 - 00:19:19.674, Speaker B: Yeah, because it's an open seat. Well, it was first, I had to win the primary, and if I won the primary, I was all but a shoo in to win the general, because the general was a special election, and because Democrats controlled the state, they put it on the same day as the democratic presidential primary, 2020.
00:19:19.714 - 00:19:20.346, Speaker C: Right.
00:19:20.530 - 00:19:26.098, Speaker B: So I'm like, I gotta win this primary. Went all out, ran against a couple Democrats.
00:19:26.226 - 00:19:26.658, Speaker C: Right.
00:19:26.746 - 00:19:30.226, Speaker B: Very established guys. I won by 86% of the vote in the primary.
00:19:30.290 - 00:19:30.490, Speaker A: Wow.
00:19:30.522 - 00:19:32.250, Speaker B: I was like, I could see the light at the end of the tunnel.
00:19:32.282 - 00:19:32.594, Speaker C: Right.
00:19:32.674 - 00:19:37.400, Speaker B: I was like, this is it. This is my chance. Two weeks later, COVID.
00:19:37.552 - 00:19:38.484, Speaker A: Oh, no.
00:19:38.824 - 00:19:47.120, Speaker B: So I left my job during this race. I go all in on this race. COVID happens. And they cancel the special election.
00:19:47.312 - 00:19:47.920, Speaker A: So they didn't fill.
00:19:47.952 - 00:20:09.710, Speaker B: Because of COVID Did not fill the seat until the general election. So they canceled it, by the way, in that election. Also, they sued me again, twice for the residency thing. Again. I won those, by the way, during 2020, the same case comes up. Upper east side kid. He has the exact same facts.
00:20:09.710 - 00:20:15.566, Speaker B: Actually, his facts are worse because he graduated from Yale the year before and voted in Connecticut the year before.
00:20:15.710 - 00:20:15.942, Speaker C: Right.
00:20:15.958 - 00:20:16.510, Speaker B: It's arguable.
00:20:16.582 - 00:20:18.902, Speaker A: Even earlier, retroactive application of it.
00:20:18.918 - 00:20:32.540, Speaker B: Yeah, but he wins. How does he win? Was it something that I did wrong? No, he was in a different court relative to me. And also, he is the son or grandson of a billionaire.
00:20:32.612 - 00:20:33.108, Speaker C: Right.
00:20:33.236 - 00:20:33.876, Speaker A: That helps.
00:20:33.940 - 00:20:39.180, Speaker B: And that's. I mean, that's all I needed to learn about New York state law, you know, and New York state courts.
00:20:39.212 - 00:20:39.428, Speaker C: Right.
00:20:39.476 - 00:20:47.764, Speaker B: And just how justice is done in New York. So, like, I was really focused on that issue for a while. Like, it's. It's pretty bad if young people can't get into politics.
00:20:47.804 - 00:20:50.964, Speaker A: Makes sense, right? Well, especially in our politics today, we need more young people.
00:20:51.004 - 00:20:55.072, Speaker B: So, anyway, during that period, I was like, all of a sudden, it's 2020. Crypto's ripping again.
00:20:55.088 - 00:20:56.284, Speaker A: I was super interested in crypto.
00:20:57.704 - 00:21:14.376, Speaker B: I was bullish on Crypto since 2014 when I was in law school, and I learned about smart contracts. And as a lawyer or a soon to be lawyer in law school, I was like, well, that's interesting. Wait, wait, hold on. If you're saying to me there's this new technology out there, it's about contracts. I was like, I gotta get into that.
00:21:14.440 - 00:21:15.024, Speaker C: Right, right.
00:21:15.064 - 00:21:18.616, Speaker B: Little did I know that smart contracts have almost very little to do with actual contracts.
00:21:18.640 - 00:21:19.320, Speaker A: We're gonna get into that.
00:21:19.352 - 00:21:19.976, Speaker C: Right, right.
00:21:20.120 - 00:21:31.224, Speaker B: But, yeah, so. And then, obviously, you know, after. After that, 2020, you know, I went back to practicing law for a little bit, and then I was like, wow, there's opportunity at Galaxy. Work at Galaxy. And I came to galaxy.
00:21:31.264 - 00:21:31.884, Speaker C: All right.
00:21:32.384 - 00:21:39.576, Speaker A: Let's run the clip of. Michael, you showed me a clip of you campaigning during that election. I just think gets some good context. We'll roll that clip.
00:21:39.600 - 00:22:16.124, Speaker B: Now, the fact of our money taken from this community, given to bondholders that don't live here, that don't care about us, that don't know us, that could care less if the power plant was in a desert or in a thriving middle class community. But we need people to stand up. We need people to fight. We don't need more people to go up to Albany and make friends with people and get into the system. We need people who are going to go up there and are going to raise hell for you.
00:22:16.464 - 00:22:17.524, Speaker C: Yeah. Right.
00:22:18.544 - 00:22:33.448, Speaker A: Okay. So, Michael, it's a fascinating story. I think it doesn't surprise me in the least. I'm happy you came to galaxy. Now let's talk about, we got a couple specific issues that you and I have been talking about for years. At this point, let's start with nfts. But I'll lay it out for the audience.
00:22:33.448 - 00:22:44.400, Speaker A: We really want to talk about nfts and tokenization daos, and we want to talk about bankruptcies. There's been a lot. As a former M and a lawyer and crypto lawyer in general, you've got some interesting takes.
00:22:44.552 - 00:22:45.508, Speaker B: Always an M and A.
00:22:45.616 - 00:23:04.864, Speaker A: Always, I guess once, always. I don't know. But let's talk about nfts. We wrote a report together, along with my colleague Gabe Parker about NFT licenses. We called it NFT licenses, facts and fictions. In fact, if you Google NFT licenses, it's still about the second or third hit that comes up. So that report has done numbers.
00:23:04.864 - 00:23:49.154, Speaker A: The thing we pretty much argued in that paper was that, and this is from completing a survey of the IP licensing agreements or clauses included with many major NFT projects, mostly PFP projects, we argued that the vast majority of them actually convey no tangible rights at all to their holders and that there was a spectrum of marketing from these companies with some being relatively benign or even point blank saying, look, you're really not getting anything but use it. We're not going to sue you if you use it since you bought it. But technically we could on the benign side and then on the sort of predatory side, some even legally, literally claiming that you did own that when you bought the NFT, you got the legal IP ownership, but that you actually didn't.
00:23:49.194 - 00:23:49.370, Speaker C: Right.
00:23:49.402 - 00:24:17.298, Speaker A: So the spectrum, first of all, do you still believe that we need tangible ownership IP, is it some of the pushback that we got on that report was like, well, dude, when you buy the Mona Lisa, like, Da Vinci still holds the IP. He's giving you the physical thing, but he's not selling all the future IP rights to the. But do we still need that? And have we made any progress there that you're aware of?
00:24:17.426 - 00:24:39.254, Speaker B: So we definitely still need it. Yeah. The inspiration behind that paper was that either one of two things were happening. Either it was a giant missed opportunity that we were seeing in the market where honest, good faith actors that were issuing these projects were just failing to actually convey the IP rights that they claimed they were doing.
00:24:39.334 - 00:24:39.478, Speaker C: Right.
00:24:39.486 - 00:24:52.662, Speaker A: We only found, I think, one, what is it? World of women, I think was the one project at the time we found that actually did have a pretty decent durable, certainly an earnest attempt at conveying them, but actually a decent structure to try to do it.
00:24:52.718 - 00:25:51.764, Speaker B: It still had issues, though, is either that or they were just basically defrauding their customers, saying that they're saying that they're conveying these rights when they weren't. And you could prove potentially that they weren't because they actually issued terms of service that clearly state that you didn't own the actual underlying IP. And the missed opportunity, if they were being honest actors, from my perspective, was unlikely. Almost every other structure you can think of in the NFT context, the smart contract design, is actually perfectly suited to actually convey rights in a way that no other structure, to my knowledge, is. So my idea at the time was if you just simply embed into the smart contract an actual contract, the text of what I mean, and the contract could say something along the lines of like, whoever holds this NFT, this contract binds, right?
00:25:51.804 - 00:25:52.340, Speaker A: Right.
00:25:52.492 - 00:26:20.566, Speaker B: In which case, by virtue of transferring the NFT, you transfer the contract because the NFT is always linked to the smart contract. You always have privity with that original smart contract in a way that if you did it in a web two version, the original issuer of the contract would no longer have contractual privity, which just means a link between the original and the resale, you sever that link, right. So if, for example, if I sell you the Mona Lisa, right?
00:26:20.590 - 00:26:21.154, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:22.334 - 00:26:35.006, Speaker B: So, and you sell it to Chris, right. I can't sue Chris for things because I no longer am under contract because I am no longer in contractual privity with Chris, right.
00:26:35.150 - 00:26:36.142, Speaker A: Chris doesn't even know you.
00:26:36.198 - 00:26:55.646, Speaker B: Yeah, but if I'm a smart contract, right, I'm always in contractual privity with the token holder because it derives from that smart contract, right. And because it references the smart contract, right? And so there's really unique properties that NFTs have. However, in any event, world of women wasn't doing that.
00:26:55.670 - 00:26:58.438, Speaker A: Unfortunately they had a different attempt. I mean it was an attempt, it.
00:26:58.446 - 00:27:05.110, Speaker B: Was a good attempt, but theirs was a web two attempt, right? And I hope, listen, I haven't checked world of women in a while, so.
00:27:05.142 - 00:27:06.566, Speaker A: Maybe same, I don't know either, but.
00:27:06.630 - 00:27:31.290, Speaker B: But like they could easily just take that terms of service, put in the smart contract and voila, you've got something there. But most other projects weren't doing it right. And this is a massive misopportunity for another reason, which is like IP rights that are freely tradable is a massive market that should be tapped into by NFT projects by the crypto community.
00:27:31.362 - 00:27:36.080, Speaker A: It seems like this technology is so powerful, particularly for tracking ownership.
00:27:36.162 - 00:27:36.828, Speaker B: Right, right.
00:27:36.876 - 00:28:16.660, Speaker A: And so this is something, let's go back to what we were talking about when you were in college and you found out about smart contracts, because this is directly related. And when I hear you describe what could be done for, you know, these classic pfps or art NFT projects, it sounds a lot like it could have power in other industries. And this is typically what people in the blockchain industry call tokenization, right? I mean is this, these constructs should, if I can transfer the ownership, if the token holder is the, the contract binds the owner of the token and then if the token, it moves now the contract moves with it. Does that have other applications for tokenizing property, real estate, equities, bonds, other interests, IP, right.
00:28:16.732 - 00:28:47.456, Speaker B: One of the biggest issues with our financial markets right now, if you had to look at one really giant inefficiency, is actually like property rights. So property rights are typically not freely tradable, right? With the exception of if you can subsume the right under some sort of security, right. Excluding that, there's no freely tradable market for IP rights. There's no freely tradable market for your deed to your house, right? There's no freely tradeable market for your ownership of your car.
00:28:47.560 - 00:28:51.044, Speaker A: Not that easy. You got to go to auto trader or whatever.
00:28:51.464 - 00:29:31.564, Speaker B: Even the commodification of ideas, which you could throw under IP, there's a whole host of different, there's a giant spectrum of things that could be tokenized if more efficiently. Let's take one thing that I've been really focused on lately in the tokenization space, which is retail borrowing, there was recently some news about how someone issued a smart contract through a protocol. I can't remember the name of the protocol and the collateral. So they borrowed money from the public markets secured by their Patek Philippe watch.
00:29:31.944 - 00:29:32.544, Speaker A: I saw this.
00:29:32.584 - 00:29:37.360, Speaker B: So they sent the Patek Philippe watch to this protocol, whoever it is, guys.
00:29:37.552 - 00:29:38.640, Speaker A: Look it up if you want custodian.
00:29:38.672 - 00:30:26.718, Speaker B: Or something, and they verify that it's real, and then what do they do? They issue a smart contract to the market, to the global market, right. And people will fund that contract and compete to fund that contract, thereby making rates as competitive as possible for that issue. Now, the evidence that one would get from funding that contract should be an NFT, right? Because it's not really that. I mean, you could do it with fungible tokens, but it's not that clean. NFT is the proper vehicle for that. That is evidencing your entitlement to a payment stream from that smart contract in perpetuity. You can freely trade it.
00:30:26.718 - 00:30:31.534, Speaker B: And the best thing about this is it effectively creates a global pawn shop.
00:30:31.574 - 00:30:59.034, Speaker A: If you will, because it's not just the contract which is in the NFT, but it's also the actual infrastructure mechanism through which to get the income stream. Or even if you're an LP in an Amm pool, it's the token, literally, that lets you redeem your assets. So it signifies your ownership, but it is also the key to affecting the contract's terms. By the way, it was called, it was a $35,000 loan from a defi protocol called Arcade.
00:30:59.154 - 00:30:59.698, Speaker B: Arcade.
00:30:59.786 - 00:31:03.482, Speaker A: And it was collateralized with a Patek Philippe watch.
00:31:03.618 - 00:31:05.602, Speaker B: So what if you are, they use.
00:31:05.618 - 00:31:08.714, Speaker A: An escrow company to securely store the physical watch, right?
00:31:08.794 - 00:31:15.546, Speaker B: So if you think about this like this, if you are just a general, you know, retail, you know, person.
00:31:15.610 - 00:31:15.834, Speaker C: Right.
00:31:15.874 - 00:31:26.924, Speaker B: Just, you're not an institution, you're not money bags by any means. You just got some things lying around the house and you need money. How do you borrow in America today?
00:31:27.004 - 00:31:27.196, Speaker C: Right.
00:31:27.220 - 00:31:29.156, Speaker A: Borrowing from the bank, from the credit card, primarily.
00:31:29.260 - 00:31:42.252, Speaker B: But if you don't have, like any, like, if you don't have the right assets, right, right. If you've got low credit, if you've got $20,000, you know, Red October Yeezys, right. You're not borrowing anything against, yeah, you.
00:31:42.268 - 00:31:43.308, Speaker A: Can'T take those down to your local.
00:31:43.356 - 00:31:45.700, Speaker B: Wells Fargo unless you go to the pawn shop.
00:31:45.772 - 00:31:46.524, Speaker C: Right, I see.
00:31:46.564 - 00:31:52.190, Speaker B: And the pawn shop suffers from a lack of a market, right. You're getting screwed.
00:31:52.222 - 00:31:56.134, Speaker A: You don't get competition. There's no transparency, but you're not getting.
00:31:56.174 - 00:32:08.142, Speaker B: Screwed necessarily because the pawn shop, some shady outfit, it's just, there's no market, right. So, you know, it's like, it's a really. It has become predatory, but it's only predatory BEcause there's no market.
00:32:08.238 - 00:32:08.582, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:32:08.638 - 00:32:10.574, Speaker B: And it's too expensive to make a market.
00:32:10.694 - 00:32:11.190, Speaker C: Right.
00:32:11.302 - 00:32:18.468, Speaker B: Except this is the beautiful thing about crypto. It's not that expensive to fork a contract. Make a global market and make a global market.
00:32:18.516 - 00:32:19.316, Speaker A: It's fascinating.
00:32:19.420 - 00:32:22.732, Speaker B: And I think that is going to be a future big area.
00:32:22.908 - 00:32:49.612, Speaker A: So you're going to have like a. You're going to have like a Warehouse somewhere. That is, it's literally, there's the physical security of the collateral, and then you're going to have a website that's literally like, do you want to buy this collateral or this collateral was defaulted on, so now it's for sale from the pawn shop, the Yeezys, or whatever they are sitting in the warehouse. So, like, if you buy it on this website, from the protocol, they'll be shipped to you, but if not, they're securely stored there, and that's where they are, and you can borrow.
00:32:49.748 - 00:32:53.476, Speaker B: Step one is I send my yeezys to this company arcade, let's say.
00:32:53.500 - 00:32:53.828, Speaker C: Right.
00:32:53.916 - 00:32:57.308, Speaker B: They verify the authenticity. They value it.
00:32:57.356 - 00:32:57.876, Speaker C: Right.
00:32:58.020 - 00:33:07.572, Speaker B: Then they issue a smart contract to the market, and they say, fund this smart contract, and this smart contract will pay you every month or every quarter a certain amount of interest.
00:33:07.628 - 00:33:08.132, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:08.268 - 00:33:23.402, Speaker B: And then after x amount of months, years, whatever money, the borrower will repay the principal and then get their yeezys back. That's a giant market.
00:33:23.538 - 00:33:24.574, Speaker A: Yeah, you're right.
00:33:25.234 - 00:33:31.538, Speaker B: One reason why retail loves collectibles, whether it's just like a board ape or whether it's a baseball card, is because stuff they can understand.
00:33:31.706 - 00:33:32.322, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:32.458 - 00:33:37.598, Speaker B: But unfortunately, we don't have sophisticated markets for those types of things.
00:33:37.726 - 00:33:38.394, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:39.014 - 00:34:07.762, Speaker A: That's interesting. All right, let's move on. I also want to talk to you, Michael, about Daos decentralized, autonomous organizations. We've talked a lot about this. This is a legal concept, or at least a governance concept, I should say. I had said once that the vast majority of them, I don't want to necessarily paint them all with the same brush, but they weren't decentralized or enough. They weren't autonomous, really at all.
00:34:07.762 - 00:34:25.106, Speaker A: None of them, really. But what I've learned recently, and we've been talking about for at least the last year and a half, they're not effectively organizations. Well, they actually are. But tell me about how most Daos are being thought about legally as organizations today.
00:34:25.290 - 00:34:34.497, Speaker B: So the most important decision, and we have to do a better job as, like, you know, leaders in this space of making this known to people.
00:34:34.585 - 00:34:35.213, Speaker C: Right.
00:34:35.713 - 00:34:52.681, Speaker B: But the number one question that the founders of a DAO should be asking themselves is, do we incorporate this dow somewhere right now there is a tension here, and I'll recognize the tension. And there's a lot of really smart people in the industry that say don't incorporate.
00:34:52.737 - 00:34:53.073, Speaker C: Right.
00:34:53.153 - 00:35:04.110, Speaker B: And the reason they say that is because it's almost a catch 22 that a regulatory system setup. The catch 22 is if you incorporate, you have a liability shield. And I'll explain what that is in a second.
00:35:04.142 - 00:35:04.614, Speaker C: But you. Good.
00:35:04.654 - 00:35:20.158, Speaker B: You have a liability. Good. But now you have a centralization vector on which securities regulators or other regular laws or other regulators can say, you're not centralized by definition. You're not decent. You're not decentralized by definition because you.
00:35:20.166 - 00:35:21.422, Speaker A: Have an LLC and LLC.
00:35:21.478 - 00:35:22.030, Speaker C: Right.
00:35:22.182 - 00:35:30.200, Speaker B: On the other hand, they say, well, let's not actually, and I've had these conversations with, like, really smart lawyers who are gcs of crypto projects.
00:35:30.232 - 00:35:30.624, Speaker C: Right. Yeah.
00:35:30.664 - 00:35:40.144, Speaker B: And I'm like, you gotta, you gotta incorporate. And what they say is no, because then we risk, you know, claim that we're not decentralized.
00:35:40.184 - 00:35:40.552, Speaker C: Right.
00:35:40.648 - 00:35:57.006, Speaker B: And so on the other hand, what they say is we're not gonna incorporate and we're gonna. And we're gonna hang our hat on this kind of, frankly, it's not a clear standard at all in the law as to whether or not if you are sufficiently decentralized, you are therefore outside of the ambit of the securities laws.
00:35:57.030 - 00:35:57.190, Speaker C: Right.
00:35:57.222 - 00:36:04.478, Speaker A: So, but what has happened when many. Well, there's have been a few cases where that the downside of not incorporating has exposed itself.
00:36:04.526 - 00:36:04.894, Speaker B: Yes.
00:36:04.974 - 00:36:12.894, Speaker A: So there's one, I think, in particular, Uki Dao, this CFtc case against Uki Dao. So what happens sometimes if you don't have that liability shield? So how are they being considered?
00:36:12.934 - 00:36:17.942, Speaker B: So if you are a holder of tokens in a Dao, right, which for.
00:36:17.958 - 00:36:21.078, Speaker A: All intents and purposes, governance tokens. Governance vote on a proposal.
00:36:21.126 - 00:37:01.422, Speaker B: So you own uni tokens, you own comp tokens, right. You own, you know, the list is you own ape tokens, right? They have one ape. And that Dao to which your tokens are linked is not incorporated under the ruling. In Uki Dao, every single token holder, whether or not they participated in any governance votes at all, is a member of what they call a general partnership. And a general partnership doesn't have the protections under the law that are afforded to llcs or corporations, namely, liability shield. Now, what's a liability? Why form a corporation at all.
00:37:01.478 - 00:37:02.074, Speaker C: Right.
00:37:02.374 - 00:37:07.326, Speaker B: People might not know this. Why form a corporation at all? It's not just because that's the thing to do.
00:37:07.390 - 00:37:08.022, Speaker C: Right.
00:37:08.198 - 00:37:16.238, Speaker B: It's because forming a corporation gives you a shield against liability.
00:37:16.326 - 00:37:17.862, Speaker A: You personally, you personally.
00:37:17.918 - 00:37:19.798, Speaker B: As an investor, as an owner, as.
00:37:19.806 - 00:37:21.834, Speaker A: An operator, as an operator, as a CEO. Yeah.
00:37:21.974 - 00:37:24.122, Speaker B: So what that means is, you know.
00:37:24.138 - 00:37:25.794, Speaker A: Like, you create a new legal person.
00:37:25.874 - 00:37:26.274, Speaker B: Yes.
00:37:26.354 - 00:37:26.666, Speaker C: Right.
00:37:26.730 - 00:37:43.354, Speaker A: That can go out in the world, and if the corporation makes a mistake or is sued or becomes legally liable, it's on the corporation as an entity, not, there's no pass through. In most cases, there's somewhat of a shield preventing a penetration of the corporate veil.
00:37:43.394 - 00:37:45.106, Speaker B: They say corporations are people, my friend.
00:37:45.170 - 00:38:01.548, Speaker A: Exactly. Well, that's the idea, though, because if you and I do business and our company does, let's say it's relatively benign, but like a contractual dispute with a vendor, we want the vendor to sue the corporation. Not my personal wealth, my family. That's the idea.
00:38:01.636 - 00:38:22.078, Speaker B: So this was actually a really huge controversy over 100 years ago. So over 100 years ago, businesses, they didn't have this concept of corporations, and it was a huge issue because you had all these rich people pooling their money together. And then the question was, when the entity that they pooled their money in did something wrong, who do you sue?
00:38:22.166 - 00:38:24.830, Speaker A: Which one of the rich people? All of the rich people, whomever.
00:38:24.902 - 00:38:39.238, Speaker B: And so states that wanted that business, they developed laws that said corporation is a separate legal entity. You can sue the corporation, but you can't go after the individual shareholders. And that is a core principle of our corporate law firm.
00:38:39.366 - 00:38:40.054, Speaker A: Capitalism.
00:38:40.134 - 00:38:43.382, Speaker B: Capitalism generally. We would not. No one would do business.
00:38:43.478 - 00:38:45.574, Speaker A: You wouldn't form capital at scale.
00:38:45.694 - 00:38:45.974, Speaker B: Never.
00:38:46.014 - 00:38:49.182, Speaker A: If merely investing in something made you liable for what it did.
00:38:49.278 - 00:38:51.446, Speaker B: Except that's happening right now in crypto.
00:38:51.510 - 00:38:52.422, Speaker A: Correct. In Dao.
00:38:52.518 - 00:39:01.254, Speaker B: So you are a member of a dao. You don't even know this, but you could be liable, what they call jointly and severally liable, which means it's even.
00:39:01.294 - 00:39:02.310, Speaker A: Worse than just being liable.
00:39:02.382 - 00:39:13.978, Speaker B: It's even worse, which means you yourself can be sued for some or all of the liability attached to the entity, literally.
00:39:14.026 - 00:39:31.698, Speaker A: So if. Let's say we have a. Let's say there's two of us, we're the DAo token holders, or the shareholders on the Dow. And the DAO is sued for being illegal in some way. And you, you get on the starship with Elon and go to Mars, and they can't find you. But they find me.
00:39:31.746 - 00:39:32.154, Speaker C: Yep.
00:39:32.234 - 00:39:36.546, Speaker A: They don't charge me with half of it. Cause I was one of two. I get charged with the whole thing.
00:39:36.570 - 00:39:37.362, Speaker B: You could get charged with the whole thing.
00:39:37.378 - 00:39:45.386, Speaker A: And that could be 99 of the 100 get on the starship with Elon demars, and one is held liable for the whole thing. That's joint and severally liable.
00:39:45.450 - 00:39:52.074, Speaker B: You could be in a DAO with 100,000 other folks, but you're the richest guy. They're suing you.
00:39:52.194 - 00:39:52.690, Speaker C: Right.
00:39:52.802 - 00:40:03.010, Speaker B: So this has a really bad effect, which is that when they're sued, as in the case of the Uki DAO, and they say, all right, someone defend it. Nobody stands up.
00:40:03.042 - 00:40:03.354, Speaker C: Right.
00:40:03.434 - 00:40:10.466, Speaker B: Nobody comes forward to defend the DAO because thereby outing themselves as one of the members of the DAO, and now.
00:40:10.490 - 00:40:12.050, Speaker A: They'Re making themselves obviously liable.
00:40:12.122 - 00:40:20.490, Speaker B: Exactly. And so we're gonna develop bad law because what happened with Ooki Dao was they went to court. No one defended Oki dao.
00:40:20.562 - 00:40:20.938, Speaker C: Right?
00:40:21.026 - 00:40:23.666, Speaker B: There were no arguments made in favor of Uki dao.
00:40:23.690 - 00:40:30.610, Speaker A: There were only. I think there were some amicus briefs. Again, that's not a defense. That's just, dear judge, here's how you should think about it.
00:40:30.682 - 00:40:34.174, Speaker B: And there's a default judgment, right. This says, no one came to defend.
00:40:34.474 - 00:40:35.378, Speaker A: We win.
00:40:35.546 - 00:40:37.770, Speaker B: By definition, CFTC wins.
00:40:37.802 - 00:40:38.434, Speaker C: Right. Yeah.
00:40:38.514 - 00:40:52.370, Speaker B: That is a huge problem that needs to be solved. And I would argue that merely incorporating as a DAO is not sufficient to vitiate or undermine your decentralization claim.
00:40:52.442 - 00:40:52.938, Speaker C: Right.
00:40:53.066 - 00:41:04.100, Speaker B: So you can still retain the status of being a decentralized protocol while offloading certain responsibilities, ministerial responsibilities.
00:41:04.172 - 00:41:04.596, Speaker C: Right.
00:41:04.700 - 00:41:10.916, Speaker B: To certain actors. So, for example, if you have a Dao and you hire a law firm, the DAO hires a law firm.
00:41:10.940 - 00:41:11.244, Speaker C: Right.
00:41:11.324 - 00:41:20.276, Speaker B: The law firm is not, like all of a sudden responsible for the DAO. The DAO is not all of a sudden centralized, because they've got a centralized law firm.
00:41:20.340 - 00:41:20.944, Speaker C: Right.
00:41:21.444 - 00:41:29.200, Speaker B: That is an example of a minister, if you will, representing the DAO. Same with corporation.
00:41:29.272 - 00:41:29.744, Speaker C: Right.
00:41:29.864 - 00:41:45.544, Speaker B: And what's cool about the Wyoming Dow law is that the Wyoming DAO law says that actually the code can take precedence. The rules of the DAO encoded on chain. Those rules can be. Then they can take precedence over the LLC rules.
00:41:45.624 - 00:41:46.056, Speaker C: Right.
00:41:46.160 - 00:41:56.200, Speaker B: Such that the incorporators can't secretly change all the rules of the LLC without anyone voting on it. And next thing you know, the DAO is.
00:41:56.312 - 00:41:58.444, Speaker A: It is run by the lawyers or something. Yeah.
00:41:59.644 - 00:42:38.972, Speaker B: I would argue that this has got to be something that those that are running daos need to fix. They need to incorporate. Because if they have any hope of attracting serious capital, by the way. Here's the other thing, not just about the liability, but daos are actually a vehicle through which a tremendous amount of innovation can be spawned. These could be seen as laboratories for innovations on governance, right? Think about this for a second. What doesn't ever get innovated on it's governance, right? Political governance. When was the last time we had an amendment to the constitution, right.
00:42:38.972 - 00:43:25.252, Speaker B: It's impossible to right corporate governance. Very difficult to do right with daos. They could be laboratories for innovative governance structures that can actually be more efficient. Aggregate capital better, protect the rights of holders better, and over time, if they're successful, actually migrate into our general economy such that they could actually influence corporations, right. Corporations could adopt those policies. The last thing I want to say about this is that a DAO, actually, there's a world in which daos actually overtake corporations one day, right. If they do the right things, right? Because one way they cannot overtake corporations is like, all right.
00:43:25.252 - 00:43:29.996, Speaker B: On one hand, you got a corporation in which all the shareholders are protected with the liability shield.
00:43:30.020 - 00:43:30.524, Speaker A: Sounds pretty good.
00:43:30.564 - 00:43:34.100, Speaker B: On the other hand, you got a dow in which every single shareholder is jointly, inseparably liable.
00:43:34.132 - 00:43:34.492, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:43:34.588 - 00:43:35.348, Speaker A: That won't get you.
00:43:35.436 - 00:43:39.820, Speaker B: That ain't going anywhere, right? It's not going to attract institutions. It's not going to attract significant capital.
00:43:39.892 - 00:43:40.196, Speaker C: Right?
00:43:40.260 - 00:44:14.916, Speaker B: And the only reason why anyone with any means would join it is because they didn't know about this quirk. But if they get that, right, I mean, I remember we were speaking with the founder compound, right? And he said something to me that stuck with me, which was like Robert Lechner, right? He said something that was, I thought was just like. I was like, this is how I know we're gonna win one day, right? Which is like compounds like. I think he analogizes to blockfi, right? He said something like, and don't quote me on this, but it was like blockfire or some other centralized lending protocol lending company. Their expenses were through the roof.
00:44:15.010 - 00:44:15.924, Speaker C: Remember this?
00:44:16.344 - 00:44:22.400, Speaker A: Compliance and liquidation levels and all the risk management stuff as it needs to be.
00:44:22.432 - 00:44:40.912, Speaker B: It's just like paperwork after paperwork after keeping the lights on, everything, the expenses for compound zero. So that advantage is the only thing that could undercut that advantage is this liability issue that we need to fix on daos.
00:44:40.968 - 00:45:08.830, Speaker A: And there are interesting things. A lot of people have humorously or criticized or observed that crypto development and innovation is speedrunning various, like, things. Take DeFi, for example. One thing that is exciting about DeFi is if you think about bitcoin, as putting the creation and design of money in the hands of open source developers and open source software development can yield enormous innovation. And it has.
00:45:08.902 - 00:45:09.182, Speaker C: Right?
00:45:09.238 - 00:45:37.286, Speaker A: And it did with bitcoin for sure. But okay, well, what if we put finance and financial engineering in the hands of open source development communities? That's the innovation that you get from DeFi. And sometimes it's humorous, sometimes you get things created by these developers that are globally distributed, random people that build on these projects that, for example, they seem innovative, but they weren't actually created years ago. And these people didn't even know. They don't come from Wall street. They don't know the. But also you get things no one's ever thought of.
00:45:37.286 - 00:46:10.380, Speaker A: And I think maybe the hope would be that similarly on governance, if we were to open up a laboratory for governance innovation to the open source world, then you could maybe get innovations no one's ever thought of. But you do face problems that people have solved in the real world. And the challenge to your point is to bring those solutions to very important problems and figure out how to incorporate those and build on the new stuff. It does seem like a really interesting opportunity. We've seen some, I mean, to be clear, the laboratory, it's happening.
00:46:10.412 - 00:46:10.748, Speaker C: Oh, yeah.
00:46:10.796 - 00:46:29.364, Speaker A: Some of them do incorporate. Some of them, I mean, I think about, compound's a good example like it. A lot of people use. Compound's governance model maker has a very elaborate, I would argue personally a little too complex, but nonetheless fascinating and elaborate governance model. There are others as well. Aragon, back in the day, was going to do decentralized corpse and arbitration.
00:46:30.584 - 00:47:26.502, Speaker B: The vanguard of all this is often going to get a lot of slack. They're going to make a lot of mistakes. A lot of them are going to fail, right? But the beauty of crypto and why I'm in this industry is that the failures are open source. And so you can take that code, right, and you can then fix those problems, right? And the scale and speed of innovation is rapid because you don't need to fund a hundred million dollar R and D trust in order to develop a smart contract because you can just pull it right directly. That also has the interesting property of being something that can actually be reviewed, has the transparency right. So what you don't hear about, let's just on DeFi for a second, what you don't hear about that often these days. And I think there was a recent report that kind of confirmed this in 2022 2021.
00:47:26.502 - 00:47:33.542, Speaker B: Every week you heard about an exploit protocol. Every single exploit here, exploit there you don't hear about them that often anymore. Right.
00:47:33.598 - 00:47:38.702, Speaker A: There have been a, I would say decline. We've seen them in other aspects, but Defi hasn't been as bad.
00:47:38.798 - 00:47:43.486, Speaker B: The reason, though, is because they've improved the tech.
00:47:43.550 - 00:47:43.822, Speaker C: Right.
00:47:43.878 - 00:47:45.742, Speaker B: The smart contracts are better.
00:47:45.838 - 00:47:46.358, Speaker C: Right.
00:47:46.486 - 00:47:50.678, Speaker B: And they will continue to be better. And so this is an interesting model.
00:47:50.726 - 00:47:51.030, Speaker C: Right.
00:47:51.102 - 00:47:54.118, Speaker B: The model is the true free market.
00:47:54.206 - 00:47:54.862, Speaker C: Right.
00:47:55.038 - 00:48:14.744, Speaker B: We throw the code out there. If you're an investor in that protocol, if you hold your funds on that protocol, you might get wrecked and you should look at it, right. But you have every single person that has the skills and the know how to exploit it, able to exploit it. And if they do exploit it, then you're gonna fix it.
00:48:14.784 - 00:48:17.344, Speaker A: The whole world in real time. It's like a real time bug bounty.
00:48:17.424 - 00:48:18.244, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:48:18.744 - 00:48:21.664, Speaker A: It's faster, it's more efficient, and it's easier to learn from.
00:48:21.704 - 00:48:27.840, Speaker B: I think you will get better code. You'll get better code from that process than the alternative process, which is heavily.
00:48:27.952 - 00:48:51.094, Speaker A: This is absolutely, this is a long term argument that's been made for decades at this point about open source software in general, that it is more secure because everyone can work on it and everyone can try to penetrate it. Bitcoin is a great example, too. It's the theoretically the largest bug bounty in the world, 100% if you can. Right now, I challenge anyone. Go out and try to crack bitcoin's blockchain. All right. It's not scary for me to say that because I literally know thousands of people have and are trying to do it.
00:48:51.134 - 00:49:01.470, Speaker B: Well, this is another thing about, like, Ethereum generally, right? So there is a debate right now about whether or not certain things on Ethereum are leading to centralization of Ethereum.
00:49:01.502 - 00:49:02.390, Speaker C: Sure. Right.
00:49:02.582 - 00:49:25.662, Speaker B: So my view on this is like, we should let those things try to centralize it, and if it does, we can fix those things rather than what is currently happening, which is a vocal, I'd say minority, but a vocal group is trying to enforce almost cultural norms. Cultural norms are not a social layer.
00:49:25.718 - 00:49:25.886, Speaker C: Right.
00:49:25.910 - 00:49:44.306, Speaker B: There's a social layer to it. It's like, well, you hear this all the time from businesses. They're like, oh, well, we could do that. We are committed to neutrality. We are committed to decentralization. It's like, dude, try to do it. If it's successful, you'll make a lot of money trying to centralize it.
00:49:44.306 - 00:49:50.338, Speaker B: And if the protocol is that easily centralizable, then there's a mistake in it that we need to fix.
00:49:50.426 - 00:49:51.054, Speaker C: Right.
00:49:51.474 - 00:49:55.810, Speaker B: Because eventually someone's going to come along. That is not going to have those sort of.
00:49:55.922 - 00:49:59.842, Speaker A: Well, this is an argument that I've heard a lot. It's not just Ethereum focused.
00:49:59.858 - 00:49:59.986, Speaker C: Right.
00:50:00.010 - 00:50:23.564, Speaker A: People are actually making this argument right now on bitcoin. There's a faction that thinks that inscriptions and ordinals are literally spam. And there's a variety of things, but one of the things they want to do is add better mempool filtering to bitcoin core so you can filter as much as you want in a mempool. Things will still probably get in on chain in general, but if it were added to core, then it would be meaningfully more difficult.
00:50:23.684 - 00:50:25.500, Speaker B: What is the issue of filtering?
00:50:25.652 - 00:50:35.024, Speaker A: Well, the issue primarily is that you end up with what happened on Ethereum, which is private mempools. Eventually, if the monetary incentive is there to get something on chain, they won't go through the public mempool.
00:50:35.144 - 00:50:35.424, Speaker C: Right.
00:50:35.464 - 00:50:42.912, Speaker A: And that's kind of, I mean, the public mempool on Ethereum is, you know, not fully dead, actually, you were showing me last week, but. But it's, it's been significantly harmed.
00:50:42.968 - 00:50:43.136, Speaker C: Right.
00:50:43.160 - 00:51:10.278, Speaker A: It's hard to. You can't only now look at the public mempool on Ethereum and get a good sense of the activity because there's all these other private locations. And that's a public good that I think, until it's lost, should be protected. If it's lost, then you do things to mitigate and whatnot. And that's Ethereum spent a lot of work on that. But one of the counters to this idea of filtering is that, guys, if the bitcoin blockchain can't handle some monkey jpegs, like, haven't we failed already? Yes, and by the way, it certainly can handle it. People just don't like that fees have gone up a bit in certain times.
00:51:10.278 - 00:51:37.706, Speaker A: Aren't fees, but that's one of the arguments for. Well, they are, but they might not be good for the social layer of how they want to use bitcoin. But I mean, it's a similar conversation, right? Because the idea is like, guys, if there's a problem that if it really is so damaging to bitcoin, we should know it right now, right? Because I'm pretty sure, like, if a government or an alien civilization wants to take down bitcoin, all they have to do is spam it with some monkey jpegs, then it really wasn't that good to begin with.
00:51:37.850 - 00:51:38.154, Speaker C: So.
00:51:38.194 - 00:52:02.608, Speaker B: Similar argument, 100%. And the main question is, if Ethereum is committed to decentralization, the question has to be why? And there's some really good arguments for why. Censorship, resistance, transparency, democratization. But the only way those things are actually going to be real is if the protocol design enables them.
00:52:02.656 - 00:52:03.008, Speaker C: Right.
00:52:03.096 - 00:52:07.376, Speaker B: You're not going to be able to enforce decentralization through social norms.
00:52:07.440 - 00:52:07.904, Speaker C: Right.
00:52:08.024 - 00:52:14.048, Speaker B: So, like, actually people who are trying to centralize the network, right. Are actually doing the network a service.
00:52:14.096 - 00:52:15.112, Speaker A: They're like white hat hackers.
00:52:15.168 - 00:52:15.664, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:52:15.744 - 00:52:16.008, Speaker C: Right.
00:52:16.056 - 00:52:21.176, Speaker B: It's exactly like the exploits for protocols, right. There will be new things that are developed.
00:52:21.240 - 00:52:21.626, Speaker C: Right.
00:52:21.720 - 00:52:53.344, Speaker B: So, for example, the l two s, the sequencers are typically centralized. That is a problem for a lot of reasons, but it also creates enormous efficiency in other respects. The question really becomes, if you're going to decentralize your sequencer, what are the tradeoffs, and how are you best going to make sure that a decentralized sequencer maintains the efficiency while also maximizes the security, the decentralization.
00:52:53.464 - 00:53:32.880, Speaker A: All right, let's do another topic. Bankruptcies. There were a lot in crypto, obviously, and it was bloody, right? There were huge companies, at least inside crypto, bloody fTx, like the most iconic and sort of, I don't know if it was by numbers the biggest blow up, but it was certainly huge. And its bankruptcy filing that Friday in November effectively marked the bottom in this market or caused the bottom. You've looked at a lot of these, you know, lawyers in bankruptcy space, and you're in crypto. You followed them. Was there anything about these bankruptcies that was different than other bankruptcies by virtue of the fact that they involved crypto companies, as opposed to, say, other types of companies?
00:53:33.032 - 00:54:16.476, Speaker B: Two things. First is the asset class, crypto being the primary value that these estates own, have a claim to, and the creditors are claiming that they have a claim to that is very unique. The more unique thing, frankly, and the very interesting dynamic was the creditor class for these estates. So typically with big bankruptcies, you've got a lot of extremely sophisticated creditors, many of whom are secured creditors, which means that the amounts that the estate owes them, they have a stronger claim to by virtue of marking certain of the collateral or the assets that the estate owns, marking it as theirs.
00:54:16.580 - 00:54:17.224, Speaker C: Right.
00:54:18.004 - 00:54:24.196, Speaker B: You also have, though, like bondholders in a lot of these bankruptcies, right? Like, and they form an ad hoc committee of bondholders, right?
00:54:24.220 - 00:54:24.404, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:54:24.444 - 00:54:31.024, Speaker B: These are very sophisticated guys, right. In crypto, it was a creditor class.
00:54:31.444 - 00:54:34.556, Speaker A: Of just retail, almost exclusively, right.
00:54:34.660 - 00:54:46.968, Speaker B: Giant mass of retail, right. We're talking like, let's just take celsius, for example. Celsius I think like 90% or more of the creditors in Celsius were retail.
00:54:47.056 - 00:54:47.784, Speaker A: Unsecured retail.
00:54:47.824 - 00:54:58.344, Speaker B: Unsecured retail. So what this means is the dynamic for the estate was such that, one, they had a ton of capital. Like they had a ton of assets to distribute.
00:54:58.384 - 00:55:01.064, Speaker A: It's a giant pile of retail users assets. Yeah.
00:55:01.184 - 00:55:05.240, Speaker B: And two, they had really no real.
00:55:05.312 - 00:55:08.924, Speaker A: Burden to distribute them quickly because they were all unsecured.
00:55:09.004 - 00:55:09.492, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:55:09.548 - 00:55:23.468, Speaker A: And there was a lack of, like, very sophisticated. Even among the unsecured creditors, there would often be, I don't know, what private equity, ARb funds, who knows what a home. So whose interests would align with the retail unsecured. But most of these didn't have that.
00:55:23.516 - 00:55:40.980, Speaker B: Right. So, like, if you are sitting on billions of dollars of use of creditor funds. Right, and they're all unsecured creditors. For the most part, you can take, and we've seen this in many respects, you can take your sweet time with.
00:55:41.012 - 00:55:43.104, Speaker A: Distributing this, figure it out, right.
00:55:43.604 - 00:56:24.604, Speaker B: Which prolonged these processes. The other thing that was unique is that because they're unsecured creditors and they are retail, the unsecured creditors committees, which is to say, for those that don't know, these are the committees that are basically like the board of directors for creditors. They're like the representatives for creditors. They are the voice for creditors. They're made up with a bunch of retail as well. On Celsius, the UCC was all retail. These are guys that mined bitcoin in their backyard and mined a lot of it and then deposited into Celsius.
00:56:24.604 - 00:56:45.420, Speaker B: We're not talking about Goldman Sachs is on the creditors. Listen. And as a result, you've got retail, leading retail. And on the other side of that is the estate. And so the estate is armed with one, a ton of resources. And what's the first thing the estate does in every bankruptcy?
00:56:45.452 - 00:56:45.732, Speaker C: I don't know.
00:56:45.748 - 00:56:46.412, Speaker A: Hire a bunch of lawyers.
00:56:46.468 - 00:56:53.684, Speaker B: Hire a bunch of lawyers, right. And they've got a ton of money to hire a bunch of lawyers. And they hire the best, the most expensive.
00:56:53.764 - 00:56:54.448, Speaker C: Right.
00:56:54.636 - 00:57:02.168, Speaker B: Then what's the next thing they do? Hire bankers. And then they hire financial advisors, and then they hire auditors, and then they hire all these advisors.
00:57:02.216 - 00:57:02.544, Speaker C: Right.
00:57:02.624 - 00:57:38.856, Speaker A: All right, before we wrap, Michael, just your long term, this has been great. I love getting the perspective of somebody with your legal mind and intellectual interest in the space. And some of the nuances of this thing cause very few people, I think, deal with the, I mean, especially we start talking about bankruptcy, contract law, legal governance issues. Right. These seem very niche, but I find them quite interesting. We've hinted on some of these throughout, particularly around tokenization contracts, organization. What's your long term vision for the impact of blockchains? As somebody who's come from the legal world, they call them smart contracts.
00:57:38.856 - 00:57:50.240, Speaker A: Are we going to get, why haven't, okay, there's two questions. First, why haven't the, are we ever going to see or why hasn't yet any of the legal industry really been obviated yet by these so called smart contracts?
00:57:50.352 - 00:58:25.396, Speaker B: So the future in my mind, and I'm as certain of this as I can be, but this is obviously an article of faith, is one day all securities will be on chain. So every security you own will be an NFT and it will be traded on a blockchain. Now whether that's a permission blockchain or not, regulations will probably force it be permission, but that alone will be a massive innovation. So you will have a system. Let's do a model transaction. You buy a company, the company, it's equity that you're buying. Because typically when you buy a company, you're doing a share purchase agreement where you're buying the equity, the equity that it's issued historically has been in nfTs.
00:58:25.396 - 00:58:56.604, Speaker B: So they're on chain. So the actual merger agreement or share purchase agreement will be a smart contract on chain. And the transaction will consist of the purchaser funding, the smart contract with USDC, let's say, and maybe, let's say if it's a mixed consideration, they're funding part stock, which are also nfTs. And by the way, these nfTs, just to be clear, these are like the most boring nfts. They could be cool, actually.
00:58:56.644 - 00:58:59.156, Speaker A: I mean, you could put an image too. But we're talking, they're literally just tax.
00:58:59.220 - 00:59:15.956, Speaker B: Yeah, like, just like there's a stock certificate and then in the code is like the actual how it can be transferred and when. And, yeah, so you, so you fund, let's say 50% USDC, 50% your own stock. You put that into this smart contract. The smart contract is a legal agreement.
00:59:16.020 - 00:59:17.260, Speaker A: And it's like an escrow too, right?
00:59:17.292 - 00:59:24.148, Speaker B: And it's an escrow, yeah. By the way, as an M and a lawyer, dealing with escrow is a giant pain in the ass. This would be much simpler.
00:59:24.276 - 00:59:35.292, Speaker A: I'm surprised that they just haven't started doing escrow to escrow stuff. Well, I guess you got the cash, you got the stablecoins or the bitcoin or the ETH already, but you don't have the other leg yet. As soon as you do, the escrow on chain will be massive.
00:59:35.388 - 00:59:47.940, Speaker B: So then the smart contract will take the actual securities from the target company that is being acquired and swap. There goes your transaction expenses, gone.
00:59:48.012 - 00:59:48.292, Speaker C: Right?
00:59:48.348 - 01:00:12.840, Speaker B: Transfer agent, gone. Escrow agent, gone. Title insurance, payment agent, gone. You simplify it massively. You also do something that's interesting, which is you actually have standardization in contracts. One of the things that is lawyers bread and butter, and for a good reason, is that M and A agreements are very bespoke. You can't really get a standard form.
01:00:12.912 - 01:00:15.968, Speaker A: So it's not like NVCA, like deal docs or something for a venture deal.
01:00:16.016 - 01:00:40.734, Speaker B: Not really. But you probably could, frankly, right? You probably could. The one limit here is that, like, do we want our private company acquisition agreement to be on chain that everyone can see, right. So there needs to be some privacy stuff that we could talk about that. But everything. All securities should be traded on chain. All instruments should be traded on chain.
01:00:40.734 - 01:01:23.504, Speaker B: Chains will get more innovative, they will get faster. And the entities today that are building for that future, if you are trading on chain today, it is a radically different system. You could port over your equities strategy to binance or to Coinbase and just press go, and it's basically going to trade crypto exactly the same way. You can just one for one. You can't do that on uniswap, right? You can't do that on chain. It's a radically different system. And those companies that prepare for that system, prepare for the future, in which Larry Fink says the future is going to be tokenization.
01:01:23.504 - 01:01:54.758, Speaker B: Everything's going to be tokenized. Everything's going to be on chain. They are going to be, I think, the real winners in the future. I hope so, at least. But that's my hope for crypto. And frankly, the only reason you asked earlier, why hasn't this happened yet? Why haven't lawyers? Why haven't smart contracts obviated like regular contracts? Yet the same question can be asked for why haven't tokens or nfts or even obviated securities? It's regulation. Regulators have to catch up with this.
01:01:54.758 - 01:02:20.818, Speaker B: The only way it's going to happen, and it is happening right now, slowly, but the only way it's going to happen is that the industry, not the crypto industry, like the industry, right, like Wall street sees the massive innovations that can take place and says, okay, we're going to adopt this. Either that or crypto industry keeps plugging forward and we just develop stuff that is just so obviously more efficient. That it needs to be chosen.
01:02:20.866 - 01:02:21.454, Speaker C: Right?
01:02:21.754 - 01:02:35.954, Speaker B: The first deal I did, last thing, the first deal I did, one of the first deals I did was like an early stage venture deal in crypto, and it was small, maybe like $5 million check or something, right? But they just paid with USDC.
01:02:36.374 - 01:02:37.782, Speaker A: It was cross border, no wires.
01:02:37.798 - 01:03:14.328, Speaker B: They sent USDC. I was like, holy crap, this is amazing. This is so obviously the right move. Payments, the future of crypto payments. If we had more stable coins of different currencies, the entire cross border payment swift system could be significantly innovated around or against. You could either innovate through Swift or innovate with Swift, I guess you could say. But either way, you could make that way more efficient.
01:03:14.328 - 01:03:45.214, Speaker B: Right now, I'm excited. I'm bullish on the future, obviously. But the main thing that I think is, is like what we should be focused on is the tech, right? It's not necessarily the next, the next big yield farming opportunity. It's the underlying tech that gave rise to that yield farming opportunity, right? How does it work? How can it be improved? What are the analogs in traditional finance? How is this doing a better job than those analogs?
01:03:45.914 - 01:03:51.558, Speaker A: That's a question you got to be asking. Michael Marcantonio, director at Galaxy my friend, thank you for coming on Galaxy Brains.
