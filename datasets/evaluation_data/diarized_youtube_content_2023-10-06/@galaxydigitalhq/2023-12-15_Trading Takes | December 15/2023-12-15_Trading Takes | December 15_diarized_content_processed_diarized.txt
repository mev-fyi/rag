00:00:08.360 - 00:00:13.638, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnett, thank you for coming on, Galaxy brains, thanks for having me.
00:00:13.726 - 00:00:14.454, Speaker B: Wow, big day.
00:00:14.494 - 00:00:15.230, Speaker A: Fed day.
00:00:15.342 - 00:00:16.334, Speaker C: Unbelievable day.
00:00:16.414 - 00:00:25.358, Speaker A: Super Bowl. Super bowl. And gosh, it is resulting in a. We'll just get right into it. It was a big one. They made news at this one. What did they say?
00:00:25.486 - 00:00:50.264, Speaker C: Basically, one, they kept rates unchanged, so they kept them 525 to 550 banned. Two, in the statement, they acknowledged that growth was slowing more than expected versus the last meeting. Three, they updated their dot plot, which indicates that there are going to be 75 basis points of cuts in 2020.
00:00:50.304 - 00:00:52.312, Speaker A: That's the median across all of them.
00:00:52.448 - 00:00:55.692, Speaker C: The median indicates a 75 bip cut.
00:00:55.848 - 00:00:56.988, Speaker A: Versus over next year.
00:00:57.036 - 00:01:50.104, Speaker C: Over next year versus the street side expectation was 50 for the dot plot. So they outdobed the street expectations, but market pricing was closer to 100 already. But that expanded because of the dovishness of the Fed. And for during the Q and A, basically Powell essentially acknowledged that they're done hiking and that, you know, they're not even going to wait till inflation gets to their target. They're going to in advance of that as they see things, you know, progressing and slowing, that they're going to be more proactive about cutting. And so it was a dovish message, right? It reinforced basically what was said by Waller, you know, the other week, and the market took it insanely well. Dollar sold off pretty aggressively, you know, looking at euro dollar, yen, all that stuff.
00:01:50.104 - 00:02:26.636, Speaker C: Gold ripped, you know, through two. K crypto obviously reacted super well with bitcoin having a plus 4% day almost testing for 4300, basically 1000 to 2000 points away from the year to date high. Russell was up like 3.5%. Dow Jones new all time highs for the Dow, it is bang on risk, on risk assets right now. You know, if you think about it, we just went from 9% inflation, you know, a year and change ago to, you know, it looks like, you know, much more manageable levels of inflation.
00:02:26.740 - 00:02:28.144, Speaker A: The three range, right?
00:02:29.164 - 00:02:44.244, Speaker C: We just printed like a month on month headline that was zero. But, you know, I personally disagree with the Fed and what they're doing right now, but in terms of what it actually does mean for markets, it means you're good to go to buy risk, at least for the next couple of weeks.
00:02:44.404 - 00:02:59.646, Speaker D: And so, you know, that's kind of the camp I'm in. The counter to all that is the services part of the economy is still super hot. If you look at like super core inflation from CPI literally yesterday, right it printed 3.9%.
00:02:59.830 - 00:03:00.174, Speaker B: Right.
00:03:00.214 - 00:03:02.246, Speaker C: And so in the labor market, you're.
00:03:02.270 - 00:03:07.038, Speaker D: Still talking about 199,000 jobs added last month.
00:03:07.126 - 00:03:07.374, Speaker B: Right.
00:03:07.414 - 00:03:11.990, Speaker D: An unemployment rate at 3.6% and a housing market that's still super tight like.
00:03:12.022 - 00:03:14.956, Speaker C: Crazy because people don't really want to sell their homes.
00:03:14.980 - 00:03:17.628, Speaker D: And so I think the risk of.
00:03:17.676 - 00:03:22.052, Speaker C: Reinflation is far greater than the Fed is acknowledging.
00:03:22.228 - 00:03:23.884, Speaker D: At the same time, I understand that.
00:03:23.924 - 00:03:27.916, Speaker C: Next year is an election year and that if you have inflation coming in.
00:03:27.980 - 00:03:33.644, Speaker D: Around 3% and your Fed funds is set north of five, you have very.
00:03:33.724 - 00:03:46.098, Speaker C: Restrictive interest rate policy, and there are cracks in the economy with respect to lower income tiers and some things in the labor market, but it's really not that bad.
00:03:46.146 - 00:03:59.506, Speaker D: And also, I mean, I'm just like, who the hell is really going to be like, I mean, the stock markets back all time highs, crypto is ripping like crazy. Asset prices are coming back, and people are like, oh, yeah, that policy might.
00:03:59.530 - 00:04:02.058, Speaker C: Be too restrictive and we gotta interest.
00:04:02.106 - 00:04:22.024, Speaker A: Yes, it is strange, too, because they've, you know, we've talked about this before, but Jay Powell has long said that Paul Volcker is not a mentor icon for him. Yes, Paul Volcker dealt with this. They hiked because inflation went up, then inflation started to cool, started cutting, then inflation came roaring back, and they had to hike almost up to 20%.
00:04:22.324 - 00:04:22.732, Speaker B: Right.
00:04:22.788 - 00:04:24.452, Speaker A: That's what he doesn't want to happen.
00:04:24.548 - 00:04:24.924, Speaker B: Right.
00:04:25.004 - 00:04:37.846, Speaker A: That's what happens. If you look at the CPI and the Fed funds rate from like the seventies and eighties. That's what happened then. So it does seem like incredibly dovish from them after he's been. They've been hammering us with hire for longer.
00:04:37.870 - 00:04:42.606, Speaker C: For so long. Absolutely. And you know what it's like, it's tinkering.
00:04:42.750 - 00:04:43.794, Speaker A: They're tinkering.
00:04:44.134 - 00:05:05.538, Speaker C: They're traitors like the rest of us. They're reacting to the data. However, I just, I think you just need a little bit more, like big picture understanding of where things are going. And if you're talking about fiscal policy in an election year, right, people are going to be just sending money in.
00:05:05.546 - 00:05:08.002, Speaker D: The mail system, basically, and governments are.
00:05:08.018 - 00:05:13.134, Speaker C: Going to be spending, jobs will be added, et cetera, and that's inflationary.
00:05:14.074 - 00:05:16.938, Speaker D: Then the other big thing, every fed.
00:05:16.986 - 00:05:28.714, Speaker C: I'm like, bitcoin makes more and more sense, don't get me wrong, partially because I'm very biased with respect to crypto, and I work at a crypto. I don't think anyone would be surprised.
00:05:28.754 - 00:05:31.170, Speaker A: To know that you and Galaxy are long bitcoin.
00:05:31.242 - 00:05:31.562, Speaker D: Correct.
00:05:31.618 - 00:05:33.088, Speaker A: I think it's pretty well known.
00:05:33.226 - 00:05:33.996, Speaker C: Fair enough.
00:05:34.140 - 00:05:36.596, Speaker D: But it's like, okay, how did the.
00:05:36.620 - 00:05:46.996, Speaker C: Curve react to the interest rate decision today? It steepened, right? Two's, thirties, two's, ten's, et cetera. And that's because the front end went. But what you have to think about.
00:05:47.060 - 00:05:57.132, Speaker D: Is the deficit stuff isn't going away. Those long term bonds still have to get funded and the Fed's still engaging in their balance sheet reduction. And what do you think?
00:05:57.148 - 00:05:59.584, Speaker C: The deficit's not going to expand in an election year.
00:06:00.184 - 00:06:07.896, Speaker D: And so you're still dealing with a situation where the long term fiscal viability of the US and the ballooning interest.
00:06:07.960 - 00:06:13.604, Speaker C: Payments because we've raised interest rates so high and we've got to constantly refinance as bonds mature.
00:06:13.984 - 00:06:26.120, Speaker D: That's still a huge issue. And easing rates in the front end helps. But the Fed is telling you simultaneously and the market's telling you that it's.
00:06:26.152 - 00:06:28.132, Speaker C: Okay to buy risk assets again, but.
00:06:28.148 - 00:06:50.220, Speaker D: That the long term stuff is still shaky. And so I'm like, wait, bitcoin is a risk asset in lots of ways and it also is a good gauge for long term fiscal viability. And so I just keep seeing this curve, steepener trade and thinking, bitcoin, bitcoin, bitcoin. And I'm not the first person to be.
00:06:50.292 - 00:06:55.468, Speaker A: You're pointing out, though, you're saying with the shaky long term thing, that's telling you to look at something like bitcoin.
00:06:55.556 - 00:06:55.868, Speaker C: Correct.
00:06:55.916 - 00:07:00.348, Speaker A: But with the short term risk on, that's also telling you to look at something like bitcoin. Look.
00:07:00.476 - 00:07:05.332, Speaker C: And so, but, but again, that's like you're talking to a very bitcoin bias person.
00:07:05.388 - 00:07:09.388, Speaker D: But I literally, I mean, the fiscal stuff is just insane.
00:07:09.476 - 00:07:20.428, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And maybe that's part of the impetus for trying to lower, agreeing to lower, or also easing pressure on the banking system, which itself has been rocked by the rates. Right. There's those types of reasons maybe to push forward here.
00:07:20.476 - 00:07:29.012, Speaker C: No, absolutely. And then the other thing I'd like to highlight and which you brought up before this, our convo was how wrong central bankers have been historically.
00:07:29.188 - 00:07:34.420, Speaker D: Everyone is pretty much awful at forecasting inflation. And so you've got these markets, whether.
00:07:34.452 - 00:07:39.596, Speaker C: It'S the bank of England, the RBA, the Fed, pick your central bank of.
00:07:39.620 - 00:07:46.624, Speaker D: Choice, and the interest rate forward path looks like pretty steep cuts that are getting baked in and more and more.
00:07:47.244 - 00:07:49.612, Speaker A: As they become more dovish.
00:07:49.748 - 00:07:59.344, Speaker D: But at the same time, people are really bad at forecasting stuff. And all the time people get stuff wrong. And the magnitude of what's priced now, you're priced to perfection.
00:07:59.874 - 00:08:00.234, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:00.274 - 00:08:20.202, Speaker D: Like, if you think long run inflation is somewhere between two and 3%, terminal rates are now like 320 ish, right? And the fed terminal dots are like two and three quarters a little bit higher than that. And so you're basically priced to perfection in terms of the cut stuff. And I know that, like, and the pal is telling you he's gonna be.
00:08:20.218 - 00:08:26.234, Speaker C: More reactive than the past policymakers because probably gonna be looking at more of.
00:08:26.234 - 00:08:27.506, Speaker D: The high frequency stuff.
00:08:27.610 - 00:08:30.452, Speaker C: And he doesn't wanna cut when inflation gets to 2%.
00:08:30.508 - 00:08:37.316, Speaker D: But it's more, like, right before, like, seeing where stuff is going. And so I'm just like, yeah, so.
00:08:37.340 - 00:08:39.420, Speaker A: There could be more interest rate volatility.
00:08:39.532 - 00:08:40.524, Speaker D: There has to be.
00:08:40.564 - 00:08:44.984, Speaker C: There has to be. And also, which, by the way, is.
00:08:45.364 - 00:08:46.844, Speaker A: That also contrasts with bitcoin.
00:08:46.924 - 00:08:47.660, Speaker D: Yeah, fair enough.
00:08:47.692 - 00:08:48.428, Speaker A: Which is highly credible.
00:08:48.476 - 00:09:11.264, Speaker D: Let's all acknowledge what the financial system is, right? It's a game of musical chairs, right? All these assets are inflated. The magnificence seven trading at insane multiples, right? The bond market now nearly priced to perfection. And you got crypto ripping like crazy. Memes ripping like crazy. I mean, I wouldn't be shocked if you had those.
00:09:11.924 - 00:09:13.660, Speaker C: I can't name the single names, but.
00:09:13.692 - 00:09:24.524, Speaker D: Like, the popular meme stocks doing well again. And so it's just so much froth and like, are we just not concerned about reinflation? Like, am I going crazy here?
00:09:24.684 - 00:09:52.302, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know. We're going to have to wait and see. I should point out that you, that the Fed for really, a long time, has been sort of signaling that this rate cuts would eventually come. Right. And you were saying many months ago that the Fed prior, looking at prior Fed speak, that they were effectively telling you to buy risk assets. And of course, you pointed out, I mean, the Dow Jones industrial average index today at all time highs, today equities are basically at all time highs and.
00:09:52.318 - 00:09:56.594, Speaker C: Had a great year, and so did other risk assets.
00:09:57.014 - 00:09:59.184, Speaker D: I mean, if you t read the.
00:09:59.334 - 00:10:11.636, Speaker C: The Fed properly, basically, you basically had to understand what pal's response function was when the data first started slowing, or when, and if data started slowing, how.
00:10:11.660 - 00:10:14.852, Speaker D: Was he gonna respond? And I thought earlier in the year.
00:10:14.948 - 00:10:20.724, Speaker C: You got a sense that his response function is, oh, I'm gonna normalize policy pretty aggressively.
00:10:20.764 - 00:10:22.836, Speaker D: It was kind of my reading, he.
00:10:22.860 - 00:10:25.688, Speaker A: Doesn'T want to stay higher for longer. He just doesn't.
00:10:25.836 - 00:10:32.784, Speaker D: But I think, I think the data, though, it may require, I mean, you go out and people are still spending money.
00:10:32.864 - 00:10:43.000, Speaker C: Lots of it's the one boon to this market and to the Fed that I think the market's probably not properly.
00:10:43.032 - 00:10:52.856, Speaker D: Appreciating is gas prices. We're talking about 1011 straight weeks of decline. Crude crudes at sub $70 right now.
00:10:52.920 - 00:10:57.632, Speaker A: Gasoline at the pump is sub dollar three everywhere I look, basically. And that's been a while.
00:10:57.768 - 00:11:08.448, Speaker D: And that impacts your sentiment, that impacts where you think future inflation is going to be. Right. And what's an important factor for determining future inflation? Expectations of future inflation.
00:11:08.536 - 00:11:23.880, Speaker A: It says, wait a second, prices are coming down because one of the only things that you go, if you go to the supermarket, maybe you look at the price that's usually written next to the item. But most people don't buy that many things where the price is literally in a big giant led board flashing right at you.
00:11:23.952 - 00:11:24.592, Speaker C: Correct.
00:11:24.768 - 00:11:34.244, Speaker A: That truly is gas prices, gasoline at the pump. That is probably the main place where americans see an index on inflation.
00:11:35.424 - 00:11:40.456, Speaker C: Grocery stores, et cetera. And now that we're talking about inflation this way, I think it's always important.
00:11:40.520 - 00:11:46.432, Speaker D: To reiterate that inflation measures the rate of change of prices, not the absolute level.
00:11:46.568 - 00:11:48.864, Speaker C: And so all we're seeing is the.
00:11:48.904 - 00:11:51.552, Speaker D: Rate of change of prices is now cooling.
00:11:51.608 - 00:11:52.456, Speaker A: It's decelerating.
00:11:52.520 - 00:11:53.464, Speaker D: It's decelerating.
00:11:53.544 - 00:11:54.468, Speaker A: But it's still going up.
00:11:54.536 - 00:11:55.984, Speaker D: Is still going up.
00:11:56.364 - 00:11:56.820, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:56.892 - 00:12:08.024, Speaker C: Although I've read some stuff on the housing stuff, looks like it's gonna start declining meaningfully in the figures, at least. Cause there's like a lead lag effect and also just a lot more supply hitting the market.
00:12:09.084 - 00:12:12.500, Speaker D: But outside of that, prices are not.
00:12:12.532 - 00:12:16.164, Speaker C: Back to where they were before we printed $7 trillion.
00:12:16.284 - 00:12:17.292, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:12:17.388 - 00:12:19.372, Speaker D: And mailed out money to every single person.
00:12:19.468 - 00:12:27.856, Speaker A: We've talked about this. They haven't really admitted policymakers, whether in the federal government or the central bank, they haven't really told people that, like guys, that's never gonna happen.
00:12:27.920 - 00:12:30.416, Speaker C: I don't even think Biden properly understands that inflation concept.
00:12:30.440 - 00:12:35.152, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm not sure. So, Bimnet Abibi, my friend from Galaxy trading, thanks for coming on.
00:12:35.168 - 00:12:37.104, Speaker C: Galaxy brands, as always, thank you for having me.
