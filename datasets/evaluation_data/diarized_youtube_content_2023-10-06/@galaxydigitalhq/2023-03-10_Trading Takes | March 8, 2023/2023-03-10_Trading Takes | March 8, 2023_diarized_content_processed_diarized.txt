00:00:06.920 - 00:00:11.006, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bim net Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, welcome my friend.
00:00:11.070 - 00:00:11.918, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:11.966 - 00:00:19.046, Speaker A: Yeah, great to have you here. Fun day this week. Fun week this week I should say J. Powell himself, the fiduciary of the.
00:00:19.070 - 00:00:22.086, Speaker B: Fed, most important man in markets, the.
00:00:22.110 - 00:00:39.934, Speaker A: Leader of the Federal Reserve, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. He is testifying in his semiannual updates to Congress. He did the Senate, today's Wednesday. He did the Senate banking committee on Tuesday. Yesterday. I think he might still be, as we record this, speaking now before the House Financial Services Committee. What are we hearing from Mister Powell?
00:00:40.354 - 00:01:23.214, Speaker B: Well it was a pretty big sort of hawkish tilt that we had yesterday from his prepared remarks. Basically he's putting 50 basis point increase for the march FOMC on the table. He's also reiterating higher for longer. And essentially he gave a huge policy update speech when the market wasn't really expecting that much. So it was a pretty big deal. We've had a dramatic repricing of front end interest rates, the dollar and risk markets more broadly. After his comments yesterday, I think they were about as meaningful as an FOMC meeting, a Jackson hole meeting.
00:01:23.214 - 00:02:02.860, Speaker B: It really kind of took me a little bit by surprise. But I think the overall message is entirely consistent with what they've been saying, which is they're going to be data dependent. And what did we have? We just had a string of hot employment price, you name it. All the data has been really strong. And so what's the Fed's response function? What's the only thing they can do is jack up front end interest rates. And now as we sit here, terminal rates are pricing at around 565 basis points and 75 basis points for the next two meetings. So some combination of 25 and 50 between the next two meetings.
00:02:02.860 - 00:02:21.810, Speaker B: So it's been pretty dramatic. And you've had s and P break 4k, bitcoin's testing 22k. Right now the dollar has broken out. Euro broke $106 am through 136. And so it's been a very dramatic move.
00:02:21.842 - 00:02:25.490, Speaker A: Yeah, dollar is highest that it's DXy highest that it's been since November.
00:02:25.602 - 00:03:09.534, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. And it's one of those pain trades where a lot of folks were positioned this year to take advantage of dollar weakening as kind of we might have had hit peak terminal rates and the forces abroad were going to lead to more inflation and ECB might have to hike more, et cetera. So the big theme was short dollars going in and now it's the complete opposite. So folks are offsides, don't really have it. And the last thing I'll say about that is as the dollar is insanely powerful right now, you get paid carry because rates are 565. It's a risk off hedge. In case the world is like we got to sell all risk assets, it's going to do well in that environment.
00:03:09.534 - 00:03:28.816, Speaker B: And so it's a currency that's just got this unique combination of being a hedge but also being a hedge that pays. And so it's really starting to get very compelling just to sit in dollars and just sit in overnight rates or short dated duration.
00:03:28.920 - 00:03:43.314, Speaker A: Goodness gracious. You talked about this interesting character, these properties and characteristics of the dollar, how it's trading. But so if they raise 50 at the next meeting, they already raised 25. Right. The last meeting.
00:03:43.394 - 00:03:45.290, Speaker B: It's a big shift in policy that.
00:03:45.322 - 00:03:48.810, Speaker A: Would be very dramatic. Right. And that's what the market is pricing right now.
00:03:48.842 - 00:04:30.428, Speaker B: In theory. Like the way to describe it is the bar is really high. For the Fed to go from like communicating that they need to go from 50 to 25, doing that and then going back to 50, that might throw their credibility into question a little bit. However, at the same time, like if they don't react to much hotter than expected data and they're telling you that they're data dependent and they also, there are tons of fed members that believe in the sort of impact of front loading, which is just doing more of what you're going to do sooner rather than later, then they would also go against their credibility if they don't go 50.
00:04:30.516 - 00:04:31.196, Speaker A: That's crazy.
00:04:31.300 - 00:04:47.984, Speaker B: They're stuck. But Powell, you know, yesterday was like, hey, like we'll go 50 if we have to. Basically. Well, it's to the point where the data has to miss really badly between now and March 22 or the next FOMC for us not to go 50.
00:04:48.064 - 00:04:49.616, Speaker A: Interesting. That's how he set it up.
00:04:49.720 - 00:04:50.896, Speaker B: That's how he basically set it up.
00:04:50.920 - 00:04:54.232, Speaker A: Like fifties, the likely outcome absent very different data.
00:04:54.288 - 00:05:05.524, Speaker B: And then the way to think about it is if he chooses to go 25 and the market's giving him 40 and he leaves 15 bps on the table, that's almost an easing of monetary policy in a way.
00:05:05.684 - 00:05:06.100, Speaker A: Right.
00:05:06.172 - 00:05:06.812, Speaker B: So.
00:05:06.988 - 00:05:08.180, Speaker A: Which he doesn't want to be doing.
00:05:08.252 - 00:05:25.060, Speaker B: He doesn't want to be doing. The other thing I'd be remiss, not to mention is the historic levels of curve inversion that we have now just seen. We are talking about a 210s curve that has now broken 100 basis points. I think as we sit now we're at 107 basis points of inversion.
00:05:25.132 - 00:05:28.250, Speaker A: Explain what this is real quick for our listeners if they don't know the inversion here.
00:05:28.412 - 00:05:43.550, Speaker B: So essentially what these curves measure is the difference between interest rates at different durations. At different durations. So the popular ones to look at are like two year versus ten year, or two year versus five year or two year versus.
00:05:43.662 - 00:05:48.966, Speaker A: So when it inverts now, typically you're supposed to get paid more to hold debt for longer, right? That's the idea.
00:05:49.070 - 00:05:49.566, Speaker B: Correct.
00:05:49.670 - 00:05:52.142, Speaker A: And the opposite is true. Now you're getting paid.
00:05:52.278 - 00:06:37.170, Speaker B: Why is that one? It's a belief in the future path of Fed policy. So the market thinks that if you jack up rates to five, 6%, et cetera, what is that going to do? That's going to slow the economy down, that's going to slow growth down, that's going to slow investment down. Eventually the Fed will have to cut rates as a response to that. What the ten year point is telling you is that the front end interest rate policy is not going to last forever. The Fed's going to have to cut things down and that growth is going to be slower as a function of where the damage that front end interest rate policy is going to do now. And it also has to do with expectations of where long run inflation are going to be. Right.
00:06:37.170 - 00:06:51.508, Speaker B: So right now, one year inflation break evens are around three and a half percent and two years are around three and a half percent. So the market's telling you, even though the Fed wants to get to 2% inflation, that it's only going to get to three and a half with monetary.
00:06:51.556 - 00:06:55.380, Speaker A: Policy in the next two years pricing in what they expect from monetary policy.
00:06:55.492 - 00:07:06.956, Speaker B: Correct. Which is like, I mean, if I was the Fed, I. It would, I mean, it freaks me out a little bit because they're jacking. The market's telling me you got a jack rates to 560 and you still won't be at, you won't hit your.
00:07:06.980 - 00:07:08.132, Speaker A: Target is what the market is saying.
00:07:08.188 - 00:07:11.924, Speaker B: Yeah. And now the market can be wrong for sure. But, but right now looking at, I.
00:07:11.924 - 00:07:43.602, Speaker A: Mean, it's the best prediction market we've got, right? I mean, there's no other real way to guess here. I mean, and then on the, on the inversion, the level of this two tens inversion. Cause I saw some stuff about this. Some researchers were saying that like the other times that it invert that this level of inversion happened was like 1929 and like, and like the crisis in the seventies and then also in the eighties, right before Volker, like, did his thing. So like, very demonstratively, historically speaking, always precedes like a major economic problem.
00:07:43.738 - 00:08:04.574, Speaker B: Yeah, correct. So it's tricky. At the same time, we have this issue right now because the economy is so hot, right? We're talking about historic levels of unemployment, two job openings per unemployed person. That's crazy. And prices that are still going up.
00:08:04.954 - 00:08:09.540, Speaker A: In the non shelter searches the other times. And frankly, every time is different.
00:08:09.682 - 00:08:43.746, Speaker B: You could have a distribution to the time. Every time is different. And to be honest with you, there's a reasonable case to be made that the growth trajectory of the US is totally fine. Just think about the kind of things that are happening, the structural things that have happened post COVID onshoring being a huge one of those things. You're bringing back domestic production into a really tight labor force. And you've also just had like, like generally a lot of underinvestment over the past couple of years. I mean, energy companies are being like a big part of it.
00:08:43.746 - 00:09:18.374, Speaker B: Like, what was the thing to do over the past couple of years? It was to take advantage of low interest rates. How did you take advantage of low interest rates? You issue a lot of debt and you buy back your stock, or you issue a lot of debt and you issue a dividend, not necessarily reinvestment. Reinvestment. And so the US, I think, structurally is headed towards a period of onshoring, reinvestment, et cetera. And now, will the interest rate sensitive parts of the economy slow down? Yes, absolutely. They have to. And just mathematically, homes will get cheaper if mortgage rates rise.
00:09:18.374 - 00:09:18.838, Speaker B: Right.
00:09:18.926 - 00:09:20.246, Speaker A: Fewer people will buy them.
00:09:20.390 - 00:09:24.790, Speaker B: Yeah, they have to. But that's not the whole economy.
00:09:24.862 - 00:09:25.710, Speaker A: Other stuff looks good, though.
00:09:25.742 - 00:10:05.076, Speaker B: Other stuff looks just fine. And that's why right now I keep struggling with this idea. Like, are you supposed to be long interest rate or short interest rates? It's really tough. Part of me is like, can the world, like, can the US economy really handle like 6% inflation, et cetera? And I really do think that a lot of the perception that the market has, and this is just kind of me self reflecting is just a function of just the environment we've been in for the past couple of years. Right. I've never seen high interest rates in my entire career. For the most part, many people haven't.
00:10:05.076 - 00:10:27.068, Speaker B: Many people haven't. I've also been very us focused. When you talk to anybody that is based abroad, especially in Em, they know inflation's a tricky issue. I've seen it their whole lives. It's not something that just goes away. And so I think there's a lot of just bias in the US that's just used to low inflation. Right.
00:10:27.076 - 00:10:29.268, Speaker A: And if it gets high, then of course it will have to come down.
00:10:29.316 - 00:10:31.344, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. Because the economy will correct.
00:10:31.684 - 00:10:32.452, Speaker A: We do it here.
00:10:32.508 - 00:11:00.896, Speaker B: That's how we do it. But I think more and more as time progresses, we're like, holy shit, the US economy is just fine with interest rates at 5% plus. However, I do think you are supposed to realize that there are unintended consequences to monetary policy and we are at uncharted territory with respect to certain things. And that anytime you raise the cost of capital from zero to 6%, there are going to be lot a of.
00:11:00.910 - 00:11:02.024, Speaker A: Something's going to happen.
00:11:03.884 - 00:11:13.384, Speaker B: In the venture world, for example, or in the private world. I mean, you really, like, it's hard. Why are you taking the illiquid risk.
00:11:13.964 - 00:11:16.020, Speaker A: At high valuations for like ten years.
00:11:16.052 - 00:11:44.324, Speaker B: In some cases, when you can get 6% on low duration stuff? Those business models are going to be fundamentally challenged. And also basically business models that have lots of liabilities in the front end or floating liabilities. Right. You know, one of the better examples is that I used to deal with a publicly listed company. Their whole business model was finance in the front end and buy assets in the back end, and all of a sudden they're totally underwater.
00:11:44.364 - 00:11:45.172, Speaker A: It's like reversed.
00:11:45.228 - 00:12:00.556, Speaker B: It's reversed. And if you think about it, like the Fed's balance sheet right now, that's exactly what it is. They have these liabilities, which is they gotta pay these banks interest on excess reserves. What are interest on excess reserves? That's gonna be top of the band.
00:12:00.620 - 00:12:01.124, Speaker A: Really high.
00:12:01.204 - 00:12:04.916, Speaker B: Right. And what do they have on their balance sheet? A ton of assets.
00:12:04.980 - 00:12:07.004, Speaker A: Like long duration assets paying less.
00:12:07.084 - 00:12:12.704, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. I think the average duration of the fed bond portfolio is probably like six years, seven years, something like that.
00:12:13.004 - 00:12:14.844, Speaker A: But they've got overnight rates to pay back.
00:12:14.884 - 00:12:21.188, Speaker B: They got to pay the banks. Yeah, they got to pay the banks on all their excess interest. And so that's how you become insolvent.
00:12:21.276 - 00:12:24.124, Speaker A: Yeah, something's got to give ultimately, but.
00:12:24.164 - 00:12:25.308, Speaker B: Luckily it's paper losses.
00:12:25.356 - 00:12:34.440, Speaker A: And currently, right now, you're saying it mostly looks okay in the economy if it's not even maybe okay, maybe even great, everything works. Jobs. People have jobs.
00:12:34.552 - 00:12:35.648, Speaker B: Here's, here's the other way.
00:12:35.696 - 00:12:39.808, Speaker A: Real wages are still like below inflation, right? I mean, they're like, they're.
00:12:39.856 - 00:12:41.968, Speaker B: Yes, real wages have not.
00:12:42.016 - 00:12:43.168, Speaker A: Wages have grown.
00:12:43.296 - 00:13:05.044, Speaker B: Yes, they have. But here's the thing. So it's different. Like, you have to think about it, like, from what time period? Because I think that the wage growth has been a recent phenomenon versus, like, there were periods where folks were just not getting raises to keep up with it. Well, there was no inflation, so there weren't no raises. So you really have to focus on. On the time period.
00:13:05.044 - 00:13:14.216, Speaker B: But, yeah, I mean, 100 million Americans, because of the Social Security cost of living adjustments, they just got a raise. And that's not necessarily wages, but that's.
00:13:14.280 - 00:13:15.056, Speaker A: Money in your pocket.
00:13:15.120 - 00:13:16.364, Speaker B: Money in your pocket.
00:13:18.624 - 00:13:33.300, Speaker A: I saw a lot of the unions have negotiated significant raises. I saw the airlines. So there are a lot of people who are making more money too. But I just mean to bottle that all up. Like you said, there is structurally a lot of structural positivity in the economy.
00:13:33.412 - 00:13:33.844, Speaker B: Yes.
00:13:33.924 - 00:13:37.864, Speaker A: And it can clearly, it appears at the moment to be bearing these rates.
00:13:38.684 - 00:14:01.148, Speaker B: And the other risk I think is really important to highlight is you have a nation of 1.3 billion people that is just reopening. I know China Powell is being asked about it. But there are huge risks to the commodity complex. Like, God forbid, oil starts spiking again and all of a sudden people are like, wait, gas prices are up. There's a pass through feedback loop of energy prices into the prices of everything.
00:14:01.316 - 00:14:06.060, Speaker A: And then, not to mention, oil is a component in many other materials. Right. Like an. Absolutely.
00:14:06.132 - 00:14:11.108, Speaker B: Plastic. All of the above. And so there's still upside risks.
00:14:11.156 - 00:14:12.516, Speaker A: This is such a tricky man.
00:14:12.620 - 00:14:13.892, Speaker B: Oh, my God. It is.
00:14:14.028 - 00:14:19.692, Speaker A: What's it feel like? I mean. I mean, you know, you're not like you've been in markets a long time, but, you know, not for decades.
00:14:19.748 - 00:14:20.052, Speaker B: Yes.
00:14:20.108 - 00:14:26.388, Speaker A: So. And like you said, your whole career has been in a low interest rate environment, along with basically. Basically anyone who's worked on low interest.
00:14:26.436 - 00:14:28.636, Speaker B: Rates or low volume. Very different.
00:14:28.700 - 00:14:30.812, Speaker A: This is a very different, tricky environment.
00:14:30.868 - 00:14:33.076, Speaker B: Absolutely. You know, I think.
00:14:33.140 - 00:14:34.188, Speaker A: Is it more fun?
00:14:34.356 - 00:14:35.076, Speaker B: It is really fun.
00:14:35.100 - 00:14:36.108, Speaker A: Like, just as a trader, I think.
00:14:36.156 - 00:14:59.838, Speaker B: As a trader, it is so much interesting stuff happening. It's just so dynamic that you just have to adjust your risk. Right. Like trading ten k of dv zero one, like, you know, three years ago is very different than trading ten k DV zero one. Now, like, when the stuff moves three times more, you gotta be taking a third the risk. Right. And so it's very dynamic and it really keeps you on your toes.
00:14:59.886 - 00:15:03.574, Speaker A: Yeah. Love it. Bimnettabib galaxy trading, as always, my friend. Thank you so much. Pleasure.
