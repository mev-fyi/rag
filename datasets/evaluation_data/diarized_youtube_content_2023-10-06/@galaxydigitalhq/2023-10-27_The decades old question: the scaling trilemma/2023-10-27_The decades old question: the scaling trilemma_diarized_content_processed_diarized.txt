00:00:00.280 - 00:00:18.278, Speaker A: Scaling blockchains is a decades old question at this point. Right. I mean, I think back to the bitcoin block size wars. We've got Johnny Beer's book up here, which is a great book, by the way. I always shill this book. It's, I think, one of the most exciting and interesting books about bitcoin. And also, of course, I mean, bitcoin's history is blockchain's history.
00:00:18.278 - 00:00:37.648, Speaker A: And the debate was, well, we want to scale bitcoin. A bunch of merchants and others wanted to make it better for payments. Right? I said, it's too expensive. The block space is too scarce. We should make it add block space to reduce fee pressure, and that would enable, like, micropayments. Right. And that's, of course, bitcoiners.
00:00:37.648 - 00:00:43.224, Speaker A: The bitcoin blockchain went a little bit of a different way, but it has effectively increased the block size over time.
