00:00:00.120 - 00:00:56.894, Speaker A: You know, I kind of spoke about this which is like the interesting thing with the having to me is that like darwinian effect on the mining industry to kind of wipe out inefficient actors. I think it's beautiful. I think it's beautiful. It actually causes them to become more efficient over time as a whole industry and that's what the heaven really does. I mean it's going to all that capital and all those resources are going to get shifted to better operators with cheaper sources of energy with more efficient mining operations and they're going to it causes them to search for even cheaper sources of energy, stranded sources of energy innovate, do things like go to the waste fields and try to get energy from there, burn tires, do these really creative ways to get cheap energy. And so that's what the heaving really does in my mind and that's what I find really fascinating about it. Kind of be outside the price that everyone else focus on.
