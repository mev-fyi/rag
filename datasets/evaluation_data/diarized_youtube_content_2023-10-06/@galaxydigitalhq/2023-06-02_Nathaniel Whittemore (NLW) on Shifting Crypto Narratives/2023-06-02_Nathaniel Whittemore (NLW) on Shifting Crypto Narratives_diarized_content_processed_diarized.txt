00:00:05.120 - 00:00:42.110, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. Hey, we're back. I got no rap, but I'm here to attack. Yeah, sorry I'm not in the studio this week, but we've got a great guest for you, Nathaniel Whittemore, also known as NLW from the Breakdown and the AI breakdown pods. We're going to talk to Nathaniel about a range of stuff, AI and crypto, China's resurgence in the crypto world, the crazy divergence in politics, and major shifts happening in our world with NLW. He's been covering crypto for five years, every single day. It's a great interview.
00:00:42.110 - 00:01:07.972, Speaker A: We'll, of course, also check in with our good friend Bimnet of BB on markets and macro. But before we get to all of that, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to the disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information contained in this podcast represents investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Let's hop right into the show. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. Bimnet, as always, great to see you. How are you doing?
00:01:08.108 - 00:01:10.020, Speaker B: Doing great. Thanks for having me.
00:01:10.172 - 00:01:33.294, Speaker A: So, I don't know. I mean, gosh, I feel like I saw bitcoin volatility is back to almost that pre FTX lows realized volatility, not a lot happening in markets. The debt ceiling, we saw a little bit of a pump over the weekend when it was announced that the debt ceiling, there was maybe a deal, but equity is heavy. Crypto now trading heavy, but still sort of in the same range. What is happening in markets, if anything?
00:01:33.334 - 00:02:36.816, Speaker B: Right now the main focus is still on the debt ceiling. Like, without a debt ceiling resolution formally getting passed through both chambers of Congress and getting signed by the president, it's still the biggest priority for markets because a default would ultimately be catastrophic. So that's the number one focus. The number two focus is on the Fed meeting on June 15. You have about 50% probability baked in for a hike in the June meeting and 100% probability of a hike baked in for the July meeting. So the market is definitely focused on front end pricing here in the US, the recent run of data has been incredibly hot, with a handful of exceptions, but the broad trend is that core inflation is still persistently high, and the factors that go into determining that core inflation suggests that it's going to remain tight. And so the Fed is left with no choice but to continue hiking in the front end.
00:02:36.816 - 00:03:28.864, Speaker B: And so now the question that the market is trying to figure out is one, how many more hikes are potentially possible today? Larry Fink said that we could see another two to four hikes. Last week we had a couple of Fed members saying you could see another two hikes. And so I think you probably have at least another two hikes in the cards. In addition, there's still significant rate cut pricing, mainly in 2024. And so the market can take out that pricing and assume that the Fed is going to be forced to stay higher for longer over that period. In addition, I think the other thing of note is sort of the international central bank backdrop. You have significant inflation in the UK and their latest prints have not been any better.
00:03:28.864 - 00:04:08.042, Speaker B: And so the BoE is expected to hike their next two meetings. Same thing with the ECB. We just had a hot australian CPI print last night. Japan, they're still pondering the end of yield curve control, and now there's chatter about currency intervention. And then fourthly, we are seeing certain pockets of weakening activity, particularly in China and Germany. These are two huge industrial complex nations and they are markets that are continuing to struggle. Look at the Hang Seng recently, underperforming by a lot like chinese industrials.
00:04:08.042 - 00:05:04.634, Speaker B: Chinese tech names have come off a lot. Basically, in China there's a lot of hope surrounding that they're reopening and it just has sort of fizzled out, just because I think historically a lot of their economy has been based on their property market and investments. And so at this point in the cycle, there's just a lot less investment and the housing market isn't like what it once was. Because I do believe that a lot of the historical activity has been driven by private real estate agents in China. And given sort of the recent collapse you've had in home pricing, I think people remember, like Evergrande, et cetera, there's less appetite there. And so China's a market that's continuing to struggle and you're seeing that reflected in their currency, which is breaking out through seven. I think it's at 711 right now and looking like it's about to make new trend highs.
00:05:04.634 - 00:05:28.616, Speaker B: And then Germany's in a recession. So it's a battle of, this is a market that's torn between a bunch of central banks that want to hike because inflation is really strong and pretty notable pockets of weakness in the global economy. So it's a pretty interesting dynamic at the moment.
00:05:28.680 - 00:05:49.010, Speaker A: We still see bond investors had been diverting strongly from what the Fed had been saying, the inversion was suggesting like an imminent recession and thus possibly cuts. But now it really does feel like higher for longer is still in the cards. I mean, is that dynamic still at play with the disparity between the two?
00:05:49.162 - 00:06:30.594, Speaker B: So that level of inversion in the front end, talking about, you know, call it overnight versus the twelve month point or the 18 month point has normalized pretty significantly. I see. And, but however, like, if you look at, you know, a curve like two's five's or two's ten's, those curves are still at historically inverted levels. And they suggest that based on historicals, that something meaningful is about to happen in the economy. And just the other kind of point that folks look at is just like the three month rate versus tenure. And that is, you know, insanely inverted. Right.
00:06:30.594 - 00:07:40.134, Speaker B: I mean, I think, yeah, it's one, it makes, it makes owning fixed income incredibly difficult from a carry perspective. And from an opportunity cost perspective, most funding or leverage that is used to buy treasuries funds and overnight, or the three month point. And so when you're talking about almost 200 basis points of negative carry, it makes it really tough to be long, that long end duration. In addition, it's just like, wait, why wouldn't I take less duration risk and park again an extra 200 basis points? And then honestly, there's one big thing that I didn't touch earlier that I'd like to just quickly go back to the resolution of the debt ceiling and what that means for markets. Once that actually goes through, there's an important sort of component to it, which is like the treasury supply that's going to hit the market after they approve the bill. Essentially, the government is going to need to raise a trillion dollars of funding via treasury sales. Six to $700 billion of that is going to come from t bills.
00:07:40.134 - 00:08:07.904, Speaker B: That means that the market is going to have to buy $600 to $700 billion T bills and another $300 million in $300 billion in other paper. And that's going to drain reserves from the market and it might be draining from banks that aren't in such good situations. And so that's definitely something sort of very notable that I think market participants are watching closely.
00:08:08.024 - 00:08:27.464, Speaker A: Wow. Yeah. It's going to be crazy to see how this goes down. I mean, I've been following the politics of the debt ceiling. You know, it seems like a tough sell for both sides right now to their, to their constituencies. Hopefully we get some kind of totally bipartisan where the fringes vote against, but the strong middle comes through and get something done sooner rather than later.
00:08:28.284 - 00:08:40.392, Speaker B: I hate to sound like a broken record, but I think this is great for bitcoin. I mean, it basically is like, hey, we're the government. We're going to spend as much money as possible up until this deadline, and then we'll, I mean, they're haggling.
00:08:40.588 - 00:09:23.894, Speaker A: If you do the arithmetic on long term fiscal situation in America, it's so ugly and it's basically impossible to do the math and have it work out without, without either massive tax increases or massive government spend cuts in the, you know, over the next 2030 years. And then you have people in Washington. I know, but then you have our people in Washington haggling over, you know, like one or 2%. Right. And like, that's. And it's just, if you think about it, I mean, I mean, Stan Druckenmiller, I encourage people to listen to his speech, teach at the University of Southern California on May 3. It's depressing, but he just lays out the simple arithmetic of things like financing the debt over the next ten to 20 years and the cost of entitlements and the other spending, and it just doesn't add up.
00:09:23.894 - 00:09:25.910, Speaker A: So it's, it literally can't add up.
00:09:25.942 - 00:09:27.382, Speaker B: So it does not.
00:09:27.478 - 00:09:44.774, Speaker A: And then we're haggling over, you know, freeze. What are we talking about freezing fiscal spending at like this year's rate for, until, for next year? Like that's, that's the debate right now. So, yeah, it seems very out of touch. Honestly, the situation, I agree, in terms of bitcoin, fundamentally speaking, makes a lot of sense in an environment like that.
00:09:45.914 - 00:10:00.774, Speaker B: I mean, long run, the only solution is to continue to finance the debt via the Federal Reserve. Like the Federal Reserve will eventually go back to QE. It's not if, but a matter of when.
00:10:02.044 - 00:10:11.144, Speaker A: So anything else just in your mind as you look at markets or crypto markets this week to share and we've talked about bitcoin.
00:10:11.524 - 00:10:34.200, Speaker B: Yeah. No, I mean, I would be remiss to not mention that the biggest sort of attention driver in markets over the past week has been AI and AI names. And we've had several companies report revenues related to AI. Businesses, chip makers, big tech.
00:10:34.272 - 00:10:34.568, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:34.616 - 00:11:28.846, Speaker B: I mean, it's, it's all about AI. And, you know, I think that's where a lot of speculative money is going towards right now. You know, some of the valuations and the names are, you know, I'd say they're hot, they're high, and a lot of the performance and equity markets this year are driven by, you know, a handful of, you know, five to six names. And so, you know, it's a market that, you know, has lost a lot of breath and, you know, is driven by one thing right now, and that's speculation around AI. And so it does feel a little bubble esque and a handful of names at least. So, yeah, I think that's an important story to watch. And obviously, you know, there are certain plays in crypto as well that are receiving positive attention because of their association with AI.
00:11:28.846 - 00:11:48.394, Speaker B: I think if you look at some of the AI tokens, those have been the best performing tokens over the past couple of weeks. As long as the AI narrative in broader markets continues, I would expect the crypto AI stuff to be well supported as well.
00:11:48.414 - 00:11:53.914, Speaker A: Well, that's great. Bim Net Abibi, as always, our friend from Galaxy trading. Thank you so much.
00:11:54.074 - 00:11:55.654, Speaker B: Pleasure. Thanks for having me.
00:11:56.314 - 00:12:03.778, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, Nathaniel Whittemore, also known as NLW by many, and host of the breakdown. Nathaniel, great to see you.
00:12:03.906 - 00:12:05.354, Speaker C: Yeah, it's awesome to be here.
00:12:05.514 - 00:12:18.580, Speaker A: Yeah, it's great to have you on my podcast. I've been on your podcast. I think when I was on there, it was the end of 2021. The title of the episode was the year of institutional bitcoin. Sounds right. That's a. Yeah, that was a long time ago.
00:12:18.580 - 00:12:42.284, Speaker A: That was over. It was about a year and, you know, a quarter ago that we did that. Before we start, let's. I feel like something, you know, for our listeners who don't know Nathaniel, he's been covering crypto basically every day for five plus years in one form or another. So he's someone I really wanted to check in with to sort of gauge where we are in these. In the cycles of crypto. And maybe that's a good marker.
00:12:42.284 - 00:12:51.974, Speaker A: We called that the institutional year of year of institutional bitcoin 2021. What is. What does it feel like today? What is this year? Does it feel like the institutional bitcoin year?
00:12:52.834 - 00:13:41.476, Speaker C: Well, I think there's two things. Does it feel like the institutional year of bitcoin and what does it feel like? If not that, I think we could have a whole conversation about the resilience or the comparative resilience of institutional interest in bitcoin and crypto post FTX collapse and all these things. I think. I actually think that there has been. It's been way less bad than it could have been from a corporate standpoint. Obviously, that's not the case for a governmental kind of narrative or a regulatory narrative. One of the things that makes this moment the most interesting is that we are in a very, very sort of short term, up for grabs period when it comes to crypto narratives, bitcoin narratives, even where we are in the cycle.
00:13:41.476 - 00:14:07.572, Speaker C: Um, you know, and I think that to some extent, there is, you know, the cyclical piece of this. You know, we're about a year out from the having. That's always the time where, you know, there starts to be jockeying for narratives and what it's going to be and what the next catalysts are. But at the same time, there have been a bunch of sort of unexpected things that have happened this year that I think have helped shape that. And I don't think that it's. It's clear. Again, I'm just talking about short term, you know, versus.
00:14:07.572 - 00:14:22.270, Speaker C: Versus kind of long term narratives. I don't think it's exactly clear how broadly speaking people are. You know, people outside the crypto industry specifically, are looking in, at the space other than just kind of ignoring it. But, yeah, we can. We can get into all that.
00:14:22.342 - 00:14:34.430, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah, it's definitely, you know, I don't. I don't see that many people exiting. Let me start. Start with that way of the. Of the institutional. Whether that's the institutional finance that, you know, they.
00:14:34.430 - 00:14:46.590, Speaker A: A famous one was like Goldman Sachs. Right? There was. In 2017, they had a desk. There was that video they put out with the guy that had the ponytail that was like, their head of crypto. I forget the guy's name. And then they closed the desk. And then, like, 2020, they, like, they reopened the desk.
00:14:46.622 - 00:14:46.814, Speaker B: Right.
00:14:46.854 - 00:15:08.592, Speaker A: And I haven't heard that they've closed it this time. And I think for the most part, that's it's sort of like a. You're either holding fast or, you know, still planning to get in. I haven't heard tons of, like, you know what? We thought it was a good idea. Our team wrote a great paper explaining why, you know, crypto is really powerful, but now we're just doing. Now we're backing out completely. I haven't heard a lot of that.
00:15:08.718 - 00:15:33.796, Speaker C: Yeah, I was calling it so last year, up until the point at which FTX collapsed, I was calling it post narrative institutionalization, because if you actually looked across the course of 2022, there were a fair number of big institutional players who were not just not exiting, but actively and quietly but not silently building out infrastructure, presumably for when the next sort of bull run happened.
00:15:33.820 - 00:15:33.932, Speaker A: Right.
00:15:33.948 - 00:16:34.886, Speaker C: There was a presumption that there would be another bull run Blackrock being a great example of a firm that was really sort of clearly making moves to build out its capacity in this space. But there are plenty of others now. Once FTX and that tornado hit, it went from quiet, sort of post narrative institutionalization to really not seeing any announcements. But to your point, you still haven't seen big exits, with the exception of specific sort of investors in FTX, the pension funds and people like that. Not just FTX, but I think more them than others who maybe did decide to take a step back and decided that maybe crypto wasn't for them from an investment profile standpoint, which I think is obviously a little bit more understandable than just some kind of narrative mass exodus that we haven't seen.
00:16:35.070 - 00:17:05.082, Speaker A: So you mentioned that we were in agreement, I think, that a lot of people are still building. We could talk about fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and many others that we've actually heard new headlines from this year or since FTX. You also mentioned some people who have apparently left, like the investors in FTX. I think there was also some in Blockfi and Celsius, big pensions and stuff. We've got gotten burned. I even saw a story today. I think it was Temasek, which is Singapore.
00:17:05.082 - 00:17:10.930, Speaker A: What are they, the executives and investors responsible for their FTX investment are taking a pay cut?
00:17:11.082 - 00:17:30.026, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah, they basically. I think that the. After an inquiry, they said that their investors weren't at fault or anything like that, but as sort of a face saving or whatever. Right. They were taking a pay cut and kind of recognition that, sure, even if it wasn't their fault that they got caught in fraud, they didn't make a mistake. And so that was their sort of way of dealing with it.
00:17:30.026 - 00:17:47.234, Speaker C: And it sounded more broadly, though, that Temasek was just, like, going to take a big step back from crypto, and they've been a fairly significant fun force in the space. So I think that one's bigger than, for example, like the Ontario teacher's pension fund or whatever. I think from the standpoint of just how active they've been.
00:17:47.394 - 00:18:05.468, Speaker A: Yeah, you're totally right. So, okay, so it's not the year of complete pullback. It was a stagnation period, for sure. I saw after FTX, we sort of bottomed out in bitcoin around 16 five. That's where we started the year everything was frozen. Right. There's almost no deals getting done.
00:18:05.468 - 00:18:44.970, Speaker A: I like listening to Nick Carter and Matt Walsh's show on the brink. They read out the deals every week, and there were several weeks with almost no venture deals announced, everything had sort of frozen. Then we go on this big run in January, and then later in March with SBB, we were talking about in the banking crisis. What was your take on that? I think a lot of people, specifically the banking crisis and its relation to the sort of mini bull run that we saw in bitcoin. Is this in your mind? A lot of people, including myself, were saying, you know, that it's a catalyst, it's not necessarily causation, but a lot of people view bitcoin as a hedge against the banks. You know, has a. Has that.
00:18:44.970 - 00:18:49.774, Speaker A: What was your take on that narrative at the time? And has that narrative run its course in your mind?
00:18:50.114 - 00:19:41.258, Speaker C: So a couple of things. The. Whenever you're looking at narrative alignments with specific financial moves in the short term, there is almost always some market structure dimension of it that's lurking as well. So binance was offloading its busd based protection fund, or whatever they called it, the billion dollar fund, because they said they wanted to move it into bitcoin, ETH and other crypto native assets. But it was because Busd was effectively digital, dead in the water at that point because of us regulatory action and blah, blah, blah, blah. And so they telegraphed this move very aggressively and loudly. They said, we are about to start moving a billion dollars of our money that was in the stablecoin into bitcoin.
00:19:41.258 - 00:20:22.314, Speaker C: And obviously, people, that the intention was clearly to allow people to front run that potentially or whatever. CZ is not out here making mistakes, let's put it that way. When it comes to what he's trying to do. And that happened right before, I'm talking right before Silicon Valley bank happened. And so this little tiny gem, and I have no idea, there's other things that could be attributable to it as well, of just starting out of that move up, got caught in this narrative maelstrom around the banks, and that what happened is that it sort of hit all at once. And all of a sudden, it wasn't just the coin desks and the blocks of the world that were writing the. This is what bitcoin was made for, story.
00:20:22.314 - 00:20:55.016, Speaker C: It was every mainstream outlet. Now, I'm not sure to what extent that brought more people in, in the short term as sort of buyers, or whether it made people kind of increase their DCA or anything like that. I think that the bigger impact of that in the long term will be that you got to think that a lot of people were watching that happen at that time. Bitcoin surging as banks fail. They were reading the Yahoo Finance article or the Bloomberg article or, you know, or. Or the USA Today article or whatever. Right.
00:20:55.016 - 00:21:23.694, Speaker C: The even more mainstream sources about that, and it's now filed away in their back of their brain. Bitcoin went up when banks went down, and maybe they didn't move on that now, but, you know, the next time there is a broader sort of more sustained catalyst, they're going to have that in mind. So when it comes to has that narrative run its course, I'm not totally sure that it was ever sort of the thing that was driving short term price. I actually think it's almost on narrative layaway for the next time there. There is a bull run, people are going to remember that.
00:21:23.824 - 00:21:33.214, Speaker A: I love that. Yeah, it definitely happened. Whether or not that's why it happened. Exactly. You're totally right. That is really interesting. It sort of lays the groundwork for a future.
00:21:33.214 - 00:21:51.234, Speaker A: It solidifies that story. Right? Chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks. And here was the american secretary, treasury of the treasury, not our chancellor, right. But essentially. Right. BTFP and essentially wink and nod back, stopping the entire banking system. And meanwhile, bitcoin rising a lot.
00:21:51.234 - 00:21:55.948, Speaker A: Right? A lot, a lot. And then, of. Of course, you mentioned the having. We have that next year.
00:21:55.996 - 00:21:56.704, Speaker B: We expect.
00:21:57.204 - 00:22:27.700, Speaker A: Well, it will happen sometime, probably April or May of next year. The last having occurred right, when. Right after COVID, I think it was May 2020 was the third having. And that was right when Paul Tudor Jones wrote his fastest horse thesis. You know, if gold does well, bitcoin should do well and do better. Um, it did, by the way, do better than gold. Um, and it also will come right before presidential election, when we have multiple candidates now.
00:22:27.700 - 00:22:35.700, Speaker A: Um, talking about bitcoin and digital assets. Have you seen those? You saw RFK junior and Vivek Ramaswamy, uh, talk about it?
00:22:35.812 - 00:22:36.140, Speaker B: Um.
00:22:36.172 - 00:22:52.604, Speaker A: You know, how important is that or how different? I mean, I don't. We've never heard a presidential candidate, I think, ever address bitcoin, ever as a candidate. Obviously, we had Trump say he doesn't like. I'm no fan of bitcoin and digital assets when he was president, and we've seen what President Trump Biden has to say about it. But. And the campaign is a bit different.
00:22:52.984 - 00:23:42.718, Speaker C: It's massively different. And I think the thing that we sometimes underestimate is the extent to which, look, people are smart and people don't have to be bought into everything to have a general sense of unease about how things are going to not be super trustful. Of institutions as they are, to have some big questions, whether they're coming from their left vantage or their right vantage, and to recognize that a thing that's not subject to the same forces could be valuable. Right. I think that when it comes to bitcoin in particular, we dramatically underestimate or we overestimate how much people have to be bought into all the details versus just kind of it intuitively making sense. And that's why I think this was a powerful moment this time around, because it just hit that very intuitive thing. It's like, yeah, it does feel a little weird out there.
00:23:42.718 - 00:23:49.330, Speaker C: Maybe the thing that's not connected to the out there is the thing that, you know, just have a little bit of. Right. I think. I think it's a pretty powerful moment.
00:23:49.482 - 00:24:28.634, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. Outside money or in public blockchains as a neutral contradiction here to this, what some people are calling the unit party. I mean, I know that's what Robert F. Kennedy junior refers to it as, but it does feel like an incredibly tumultuous and divided time in America. I mean, even more, I remember, you know, during the Bush administration, how divided the country was on, let's say, the Iraq war. But this, even then, I felt like they could get together the two sides and get something important for the country done. Now you look in Congress and you just see, you know, just incredible division.
00:24:28.634 - 00:25:00.034, Speaker A: Do you think that. And I was, maybe this is a segue, too, because it's that it's also at a time of incredible technological upheaval. You know, we've been seeing a lot about artificial intelligence, you know, whether or not it's from politicians or from machines, you know, what's your, how do you, how important do you think it's going to be able to be in the future to really know truth or know the provenance of something as being accurate, you know, compared to today? Is it, I mean, I know it's already important today, but how does AI picture in here or also just truthiness, you know, in Stephen Colbert's terms?
00:25:00.494 - 00:26:07.504, Speaker C: So I think that there's, if we zoom up in terms of the shift that we're all living through, you have. So if you look at, there's sort of a shift that's happened in terms of us living in a post consensus world. So I had this guy, Jonas Conis, on the show. I heard him on Demetrio Kofinas show hidden forces first. And he's been writing this series of essays about the, the post consensus reality world that we live in and effectively, his thesis is that ever since the beginning of the Internet, it's not just social media that he tracks it to. But ever since the beginning of the Internet, we've lived in a world where individual groups or different groups could sort of lay claim to their own truth that was separate and distinct from other groups. Truth and the Internet both allows you to find those groups of people and to associate with them, as well as to create context for those different kind of competing truths to clash against one another.
00:26:07.504 - 00:26:51.064, Speaker C: And we see this in politics most dramatically, but it's in lots and lots of different things. And I think, you know, you could see it around the discourses around, you know, I mean, everything right at this point. And the fascinating thing when you dig into this with John is his. He's much less bleak on it than I think a lot of our instinct is to be. And for him, what's clear is just that we have not yet developed institutions that match this post consensus reality that are equipped to handle multiple kind of competing truths. And, you know, he, I haven't seen him yet. He's in the middle of a whole series, so maybe he gets into this in the future.
00:26:51.064 - 00:28:02.350, Speaker C: I haven't seen him articulate yet what he thinks those sort of institutions look like. And it may not just be institutions, it may be different ways of being, right, where we just get comfortable with the idea that just because there are different types of truth, we don't have to always have them competing with one another or whatever. Right. The point being, though, that there is this huge shift happening that is just absolutely undeniable, that sort of eats everything in its wake a little bit. And we're living in the tension between whatever it is and becomes and this sort of historical accident that we lived in for, you know, for the past 60 years or 80 years post world War two, where there could be a consensus truth because media was both mass, but it was also highly controlled. And so we're kind of sloughing off this old world and emerging very painfully in our sort of teenage years of this new world. And I think that we are just starting now to get a preview of, of how dramatic some of those challenges are going to be every couple of years.
00:28:02.350 - 00:28:50.556, Speaker C: You look back at the things that we were arguing about a couple of years before that, and it seems quaint almost, I think, maybe to wrap up the bitcoin thought before talking about AI and sources of the truth. I do think it's pretty notable that. So, one, you've had sort of a evolution of presidential or, you know, or hopeful presidential statements on bitcoin from the one that you pointed out in 2019 from, from then President Trump. I'm no fan of bitcoin and blah, blah, blah. It was all just a pretense to get to the fact that they didn't, they really didn't like Libra. You know, most, most people thought that it was basically Steven Mnuchin talking through Trump, even if he didn't exactly write it up to then, you know, moving forward. When it came to President Biden, initially, there was sort of this very neutral tone.
00:28:50.556 - 00:30:03.640, Speaker C: You know, those sort of, the executive order was very, you know, let's go study things and see what comes out. And obviously, that shifted rather dramatically over the last six months, although I think we could have a whole conversation about to what extent that comes from conviction across the Democratic Party and the White House versus just the people, like, people not being willing to have a fight with the people who are extra angry at crypto post FTX. So those voices being the loudest, which is kind of more what I. More what I think it is. So you, you have, you have that evolution, right, into a very emergent campaign environment in which both of this sort of dark horse outside force candidates on the right and the left are down in Miami speaking at the bitcoin conference. And then the biggest challenger to Trump during the announcement of his campaign on Twitter with Elon Musk, talks extensively about bitcoin and why it needs to be preserved and the right to do that needs to be preserved. And I don't know if the political calculus of deciding to make cbdcs and bitcoin an issue is the right one.
00:30:03.640 - 00:31:15.874, Speaker C: But I do think it's notable that it's happening. It's happening more positively than not. The only politicians that we've seen who have decided so far in this election cycle to make antagonism to crypto campaign platform is Elizabeth Warren, right, who used it as sort of her part of announcement, which is almost inevitable. I mean, I think that one little piece of the psychodrama that is the next election will be a bit of a referendum on whether this is whether certain parts of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party are correct in their assumption that crypto or being antagonistic towards crypto is a good policy. My guess, uh, is that they are slightly misreading increased Twitter engagement, uh, as a indicator that it's a good policy, when actually what that reflects is that the bitcoin and crypto Twitter community punched so far above its weight class in terms of actual engagement. I mean, I, you have to think that the ratio of tweets and loudness among our little corner of the world relative to the number of people participating is just higher than any other community. And now being in the AI space a little bit more, I certainly think it's true.
00:31:15.874 - 00:31:18.738, Speaker C: AI is all everyone is talking about all the time.
00:31:18.786 - 00:31:53.204, Speaker A: Well, hold on. Let's go into AI in 1 second, because you said a lot of really interesting stuff there. Just on the last point I'd actually saw there was, I think it was in a Financial Times article maybe a couple of weeks ago. They said the only two discernible communities that have seen engagement and usage on Twitter grow since Elon Musk purchased it was adult content and cryptocurrencies. So you're, you're totally right that we're batting above our weight class online. I also, I think, I like your point a lot, that it will be a referee. I think it, I think even a little bit more broadly, it'll be a referendum on whether crypto is smart to use as a campaign issue on either side.
00:31:53.204 - 00:32:30.364, Speaker A: But the difference, I think, I think your point is right, because I think the Democrats, to the extent that they do use an anti crypto message, right. Elizabeth Warren's building an anti crypto army. She said. My guess is she's already got all the people that agree with that in her camp anyway. The Democrats aren't courting the middle by being anti crypto. So I think that's where, I think that's where it is interesting on the republican side that some, some appear to be, I think they think it can be a wedge issue for them with at least some segment of the voter base. I don't think anyone's, like turning away from, I don't think anyone's coming to the Democratic Party because they're against bitcoin, to me, in my view.
00:32:30.364 - 00:32:51.976, Speaker A: But anyway, I agree. That's going to be interesting. Let's go on to AI. You're about to jump in there because, I mean, everyone's wondering, you know, what's the, we see a huge venture capitalist narrative shifting, right? It's like, oh, my gosh, you know, OpenAI, Sam Altman's OpenAI launches chat GPT, which is basically available to everyone. What, when was it? Three or four months ago, maybe November. Yes.
00:32:52.040 - 00:32:53.512, Speaker C: Same time as FTX, actually.
00:32:53.648 - 00:32:54.528, Speaker A: Perfect narrative.
00:32:54.576 - 00:32:56.044, Speaker C: Yeah. Perfect timing.
00:32:56.504 - 00:33:05.600, Speaker A: I've got it. I use it. I sometimes use it instead of Google. Like, just tell me the answer to this question. Question. You have to be careful. Sometimes you get incredibly wrong information out of it.
00:33:05.600 - 00:33:35.304, Speaker A: Very confidently, but it's. It's extremely powerful. I think that opened a lot of people's eyes. And then everyone I talked to in Silicon Valley is like, dude, it feels like the pitch decks on AI or AI adjacent companies is like the deluge we were seeing on crypto in like 2019 2020. So it's clearly a big shift, but it's a. It's a real shift, right? I mean, we. It's not just a narrative, is this, this technology appears to really finally be advancing into a way that everyday people may be using it every day.
00:33:35.304 - 00:33:40.396, Speaker A: What's your broad take on AI generally before we try to connect it to crypto or anything like that?
00:33:40.540 - 00:34:56.966, Speaker C: Yeah, so, listen, the way that I always frame the breakdown is that it was about big picture power shifts. And the one that I was exploring in the context of the breakdown was economic power. And the vantage point for that was bitcoin and crypto more broadly, because that was the piece of sort of this big picture power shift that I was most interested in. I started a couple of months ago, the AI breakdown, because basically since chat GPT, my big picture power shiftometer has been going off the charts. And listen, I remember 2018 2019 when all of your crypto friends who are in LA posted their LinkedIn message about how they were returning to their first love, which was the cannabis industry or whatever the fuck it was. You know, this is not that for people who are like, it has been the most obvious inflection point moment, I think, you know, in society, you know, the technological structure of society that maybe we've seen in our lifetimes, in terms of it being so crystal clear that this is an un ignorable force. Now, that doesn't mean that the, you know, VC's aren't going to turn it into incredible froth with things that are just going to be eaten alive.
00:34:56.966 - 00:35:31.642, Speaker C: You know, David Sacks recently said that, you know, it's the only segment of Silicon Valley that's still being invested on based on the dream versus the metrics. And I think that that's probably true, and that always leads to, you know, a whole, a whole washout of losers. But I think that the core of people aren't wrong. Like, it wasn't accidental that it became the fastest growing startup in history, that 100 million people used chat GPT in the first five weeks after it was released. Previous to that, TikTok was the fastest growing and it was nine months. And even that's insane to get to 100 million users. This is unlike things that we've seen.
00:35:31.642 - 00:36:58.760, Speaker C: And I think that the reason that it's hitting people so hard is that it transparently has impacts that extend from every person individually in terms of how they're going to do their job, what job they're going to do, what that looks like in the future, to sort of this middle industrial level of our entire categories of jobs and industries going to be washed away or changed forever to this massive society, you know, structure of society level with questions of, you know, existential risk and where those, you know, industrial and Java, you know, changes, even, even without the x risk question, still become the biggest political issues of the time. And so, you know, this thing just, that was theoretical became not theoretical, you know, almost overnight. And people are now racing to, to catch up and make sense of it in a way that is, I think, profound and mostly very legitimate. And of course, as part of that, you have all of the, every character and every archetype that we've seen in crypto obviously flows in the threader guys on Twitter and whatever, they're all here. But I think that the temptation that some have to write it off because it reminds them of things that, that have been right offable in the past would be a pretty big mistake.
00:36:58.912 - 00:37:26.988, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. It's, it's already, um. I mean, even just that chat use case alone is so powerful, you know, you start to realize what else we can plug it into. So it does this, though, bring us into a post truth world, not just in AI, but also in. Sorry, like, in, in AI writing. But think about, like, mid journey, right? I use mid journey love mid journey as my chat with the mid journey bot on discord to make weird images. And they're incredible, and they're not there yet, I think I can mostly tell.
00:37:26.988 - 00:37:43.836, Speaker A: But remember, there was one that happened. It was, um. Was it a. It was a Donald Trump junior, like with an ar, like in Central park and like. And then there was another one with Donald Trump being arrested by cops, supposedly. And you could tell if you looked at the hands, they just didn't look right. But otherwise, it looked pretty damn close.
00:37:43.980 - 00:37:44.636, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:37:44.780 - 00:37:53.652, Speaker A: Is there a world, a role in particular? Like what's the intersect between crypto and block and blockchain and AI in your mind, if there is one at all?
00:37:53.788 - 00:38:59.184, Speaker C: I think a lot of people are exploring exactly that. So I think that on an intuitive level, people understand that in a world where, in a world where you can't assume, in fact, your default assumption has to be that instead of things being real and prove it to me otherwise, that we're going to start to probably shift to assume that things are fake. And if not, prove it to me otherwise. And to prove it to me otherwise is where potentially a digital public ledger, a shared public ledger that is ultimately a source of shared truth, becomes a really valuable construct. Now, I think that right now that conversation is pretty theoretical versus applied. We haven't yet seen the first AP photographer who's dropping their photos in an ordinal to prove that they took them first or anything like that. But it wouldn't surprise me if we see that in the next few months, or there's some protocol that's designed specifically to do that.
00:38:59.184 - 00:40:29.804, Speaker C: I think that there's going to be a huge amount of experimentation, because again, we were talking about the clear obviousness of maybe in a world where we don't really trust institutions, having a money type thing that's non institutional is valuable. In a world where everything can be faked so effortlessly, maybe having shared sources of truth that are uncorruptible or less corruptible are valuable. For me, the level that it's intersected is so far, there's a clear connection point there, even if we are not sure exactly how it manifests yet. I also think that there are pretty powerful questions that we're going to face around power structures and centralization versus decentralization. I think that in a lot of ways, a lot of AI points to stronger centralization. One, in the fact that it appears, or you would be kind of reasonable to assume, that only the people that can play at massive scale in terms of access to GPU's and access to large models and stuff, value and power is going to accrue to them. Now, we've also seen some counterpoints where a Google memo leaked a couple of weeks ago that basically suggested that open source was just eating the lunch of these guys.
00:40:29.804 - 00:41:26.186, Speaker C: Maybe it won't be like that, but I think on top of that, you also have AI could create momentum for another extreme sort of power grab from a political level as well, in terms of if an industry, if left to its own devices, technology would wipe out an entire industry that represents whatever 3% of american adults. Is the government going to allow that to happen? Or are they going to try to ban the technology for that use case? Those are the types of questions that we're going to face. And I think where it gets complicated is that people who are not particularly interested in draconian control might be even more worried about what free, unfettered AI does. It's sort of. I don't know. I feel like for a lot of folks, crypto will have felt, not like they'll leave it, but it will have felt like a training ground for the types of things that were going to deal with in AI world.
00:41:26.290 - 00:42:13.430, Speaker A: It's going to get real serious. All right, last question. I know we got to run. You've been covering the emergence of China and their interest in crypto in particular. This is something that's near and dear to my heart, because I've been loudly advocating for the United States to not only speed up a progressive framework for regulation, but go in the correct directions of shooting ourselves in the foot while the rest of the world appears to be moving in a very accepting direction for crypto. Again, not easy, but regulatory frameworks that business can actually operate in with clarity and rules that make sense. Just recently, just sort of a recent headline on this, there was supposedly a web3 white paper put out by some part of the chinese government.
00:42:13.430 - 00:42:16.086, Speaker A: You covered this. What did it say and what did.
00:42:16.110 - 00:42:17.234, Speaker B: It say to you?
00:42:17.734 - 00:43:20.430, Speaker C: So this is one of the most unexpected shifts and realignments around crypto, I think, of 2023. In fact, it would be my contender for the big, most important narrative of 2023 so far is sort of the withdrawal of the US and the reemergence of China and the east more broadly as sort of a dominant force. And the US side of the story, I think, is well trodden territory for anyone who's listening to this show, you know, post FTX Operation Choke. .2.0 even if you don't really believe, and it's a coordinated effort, there's no doubt that the sort of disposition, posture, and stance of, you know, the institutions of power in the United States have pushed against and gone away from crypto. Now, in the meanwhile, it appears that China, who had effectively banned or, you know, kind of tried to ban everything about crypto in 2021, has recognized in that, in that sort of withdrawal of the US that the geopolitical stakes may have changed. And, you know, far be it from them to lose out on that opportunity.
00:43:20.430 - 00:43:37.354, Speaker C: There have been a couple places that this has come up. One is around Hong Kong regulations. Last year, Hong Kong announced they would have new forthcoming crypto regulations. This was again around the time of FTX, maybe a little bit before, maybe it was just after, but I remember this.
00:43:37.434 - 00:43:37.746, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:37.810 - 00:44:35.876, Speaker C: Shortly thereafter, it looked as though they were going to be headed for a bigger clamp down, like it was expected that retail would not have a legal path to trade crypto at all in Hong Kong in March of this year. I think whatever, basically whatever month it was, March or April, it started to become, or it started to appear as though that was, it was actually going to go in a slightly different direction and that the regulations were going to be a lot more permissive. Then a few weeks ago, we actually got them. And there are basically, there is a path for retail, for exchanges to offer services to retail. It's in a limited form. Assets that they offer have to be listed on two, or listed in two major indices. But then beyond that, once they are licensed, which, by the way, no one has actually gotten the license quite yet, they have a lot of latitude in determining processes to add new assets on.
00:44:35.876 - 00:45:07.444, Speaker C: So the point being that this is a big, big shift from what it appeared and what they were signaling it was going to be like just seven months ago. So Hong Kong is one piece of it. A second piece of it is banking infrastructure. And this one is. It's not totally clear where, you know, how much real versus narrative it is, but there were a lot of reports over the last couple months that CCP officials were showing up at crypto meetups in Hong Kong and positively engaging with the community. Not as a, like, not as a I'm here to spy kind of way. I'm here to, like, participate kind of way.
00:45:07.444 - 00:45:55.988, Speaker C: That's notable. Second, uh, Hong Kong was signaling more openness for crypto companies getting banking infrastructure up and running with them, including from chinese state sponsored banks who were, you know, going and doing pitches at startup offices to, you know, ask them to. To create bank accounts. Now, again, it's a little unclear how, you know, how real that was versus a Bloomberg article that everyone latched onto, because it's a really interesting narrative. But then the third piece is the one that you mentioned, this web3 paper. So it's from Beijing's municipal science and technology commission. And it's basically sort of a big look at, they call web3 a part of sort of an inevitable set of trends around them, metaverse and AI and all these sort of things.
00:45:55.988 - 00:47:00.400, Speaker C: And it reads, it's not just a crypto paper, it's sort of about a broader set of technologies, but it certainly reads as an invocation to get more, not less, involved. Right? They even go into depth around how different private companies in China, Bytedance, JD Baidu, could all sort of be involved in this and what they could do. And, you know, this is obviously, it's a small part of the Beijing apparatus. It's not like it's, you know, President Xi doing a speech about it or something like that, but this is China. And it's not a system where this type of paper gets out unless it's allowed to get out. And, you know, what we don't know is to what extent this is signaling a shift versus being a test balloon versus, you know, just sort of it actually being the people inside this municipal science and technology commission who someone higher above them said, why not? Fine. You know, it's not even a tacit approval or a test balloon.
00:47:00.400 - 00:47:41.650, Speaker C: It's just a willingness to let it go forward. But either way, it's a hell of a lot different than two years ago when it was, shut up and stop doing this or you'll get arrested. Right. It's a pretty remarkable shift. I think that over the next few months we're going to have a lot better picture of how this all shakes out. But it's certainly, I think that the overall trend line is pretty unignorable. That if you look at middle of last year to middle of this year in terms of where China and China's sphere of influence sit vis a vis crypto, and it's also what the US organizations are, are kind of pushing, pushing back on.
00:47:41.650 - 00:47:48.210, Speaker C: You know, Brian Armstrong wrote a whole big op ed about exactly this. So it's, it's interesting times for sure.
00:47:48.362 - 00:48:08.460, Speaker A: Yeah. Big shifts happening across a range of parts of the sector and the technology and global technology sectors and across the world.
