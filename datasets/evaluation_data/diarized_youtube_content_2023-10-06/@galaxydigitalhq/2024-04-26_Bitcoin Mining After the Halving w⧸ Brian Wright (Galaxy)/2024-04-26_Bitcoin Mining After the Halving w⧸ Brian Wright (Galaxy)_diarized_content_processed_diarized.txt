00:00:00.640 - 00:00:05.646, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, an infinite amount of cash. Cash. I'm your host, Alex Thorne.
00:00:05.670 - 00:00:08.274, Speaker B: The US banking system is sound and resilient.
00:00:08.574 - 00:00:13.594, Speaker A: Bitcoin made a new all time high. If you're not long. If you're not long, you're short.
00:00:13.894 - 00:00:19.354, Speaker C: Satoshi's gonna come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet. All bitcoin's gonna be erased.
00:00:19.654 - 00:00:20.342, Speaker A: Bitcoin.
00:00:20.438 - 00:00:22.114, Speaker B: Bitcoin's the best crypto else.
00:00:22.774 - 00:00:37.854, Speaker A: Bitcoin is going to zero. Welcome back to Galaxy Brains. Bitcoin, not zero still. So that's positive. And I'm your host, Alex Thorne. Thank you for listening. Hey, got some interesting news, but before we get to this, I need to remind you to refer to the link to the Disclaimer on the podcast.

Note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Phineas, my friend, we are back, as usual. We've got a great episode today, the bitcoin having happened last week. We're going to talk with my friend Brian Wright, co head of bitcoin mining at Galaxy, about the having the future of mining and fees, and also what galaxy mining has coming up. What do you think? We just cut that interview. How'd that go in your mind? Very engaging.
00:01:07.506 - 00:01:12.122, Speaker D: Lots of happenings via and because of the having.
00:01:12.178 - 00:01:14.770, Speaker B: And I think it's interesting to hear.
00:01:14.842 - 00:01:16.018, Speaker D: Two folks who know a lot about it.
00:01:16.026 - 00:01:28.188, Speaker A: Break it down. Yeah. Some other news here. Of course, we're going to check in with our friend Bim Netabee from Galaxy trading. As always, too. But some news happening in crypto this week in the crypto world. One, the IR's released a 1099 DA.
00:01:28.188 - 00:02:02.864, Speaker A: That's their digital asset 1099, a draft version of it. This is the thing that they give you at the end of the year in your brokerage account that has the tax information, but they also provide to the IR's, like your brokerage firm sends it to them. The broker rule that was passed as part of the 2021 infrastructure bill requires that. Sorry, maybe it was 22, I can't remember the bill. It adds this authority to the IR's. And now the big question is, it's one thing if your Coinbase account or a normal exchange is going to do this. They're a centralized company.
00:02:02.864 - 00:02:23.524, Speaker A: They're regulated. But the draft includes that unhosted wallet providers should be providing this, too, which I think is an extreme overreach. I've written about this a lot. A piece of software that lets you self custody. Bitcoin should not and is normally not in a position to file this or know what your cost basis is. Tricky. That's still in a draft.
00:02:23.524 - 00:02:54.752, Speaker A: Tax news to start us off block, the maker of cash app, they just announced that they finished designing their new bitcoin mining ASIC chip. So I don't know, maybe we've got a new manufacturer. And then this is interesting. In Hong Kong, bitcoin and ETH ETF's are set to start trading for the first time on Tuesday, April 30. I don't know, it could be big. Although I was told by the guys at Bloomberg that the entire Hong Kong ETF market is smaller than just the bitcoin ETF's in the United States. Wow.
00:02:54.752 - 00:03:24.358, Speaker A: So potentially something there. But it's not. It's not like a us sized capital market. Granted, none are. And then CZ CEO, former CEO of Binance, the largest exchange in crypto, remember he pled guilty to a variety of charges, mostly stemming from lax or non existent, in some cases, AML KYC policies at Binance, the government is. So he paid a big fine and pled guilty. And we're waiting on sentencing.
00:03:24.358 - 00:03:52.744, Speaker A: The government is asking for a three year prison sentence for CZ. I think the recommended for the charges he pled guilty to is 18 months. We're going to find out on Tuesday whether CZ what? The sentence will be pretty wild. I mean, different than SPF for sure, because Binance apparently and thankfully was solvent, so he didn't steal anyone's money. Right? So it's a little bit different. But nonetheless, that's going to be a big story, I think, next week. So check out for that.
00:03:52.744 - 00:04:22.814, Speaker A: Hey, also, I know some people have been upset that we switched to the static intro and not haven't been rapping the intro anymore. But fear not, we are going to be rapping more separately. And this is a great example. Stay tuned to the end of this episode for a special, I mean, I guess having themed rap song Captain Youth and intangible coins. So at the end of this episode called Stealing time, it's really good. It's literally at the end of this episode you listen to the whole thing, you don't fast forward. And anyway, let's go to Bimnet.
00:04:22.814 - 00:04:28.762, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet, a BB from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:04:28.818 - 00:04:29.974, Speaker D: Thanks for having me.
00:04:30.314 - 00:04:53.366, Speaker A: So kind of a quiet time. I mean, you had the bitcoin halving, which had a big impact on the network, the network obviously becoming the monetary asset, becoming scarcer, but fees spiking because of runes and ordinals and stuff. But we're going to talk with Brian wright from galaxy mining in a minute about that. Otherwise though, like BTC, like kind of sideways. What equities like have been down, but kind of like sideways in the moment. Like it's sort of.
00:04:53.470 - 00:04:55.174, Speaker D: Yeah, they've been down for a couple of weeks.
00:04:55.214 - 00:04:56.958, Speaker A: We waiting for a new catalyst or.
00:04:57.006 - 00:04:57.358, Speaker B: Yes.
00:04:57.446 - 00:04:58.542, Speaker A: What are we waiting on?
00:04:58.678 - 00:05:48.994, Speaker D: Well, earnings. So you know, I think this week about 160 companies in the S and P 500 report earnings, including some big tech names. And so that will broadly give the market a sense of how healthy the economy is in terms of are people spending money, how healthy corporate balance sheets are. I know broadly impact risk sentiment. If people start feeling good about stocks again, that should be good for crypto, that should be bad for the dollar, et cetera, et cetera. So it's really important to pay attention to these earnings. I pay close attention to the consumer discretionary companies that have a bigger, a stronger pulse on where the US consumer is.
00:05:48.994 - 00:06:17.298, Speaker D: Also credit card companies as well. One interesting tidbit, one of the lower quality credit card companies recently reported earnings and they had their provisions for loan losses start to tick higher. And it was back to levels that you saw in 2008 and around the financial crisis, we're talking about provisioning of slightly over 5%.
00:06:17.386 - 00:06:20.650, Speaker A: So setting aside capital to cover those losses, is that what that means?
00:06:20.722 - 00:06:23.114, Speaker D: And the delinquency rates are.
00:06:23.274 - 00:06:31.528, Speaker A: So they set aside more as they expect more losses basically. So you're saying what, the consumer is now stretched and they don't have extra cash anymore, they're in debt.
00:06:31.626 - 00:06:32.304, Speaker B: Yes.
00:06:32.724 - 00:07:29.720, Speaker D: And the debt is at a higher cost than ever because interest rates have gone up, savings have come down a lot because far less transfer payments from the government. It's also wages have not kept up with inflation. And so it's a constant burn on people. And more and more people are getting stuck in the debt trap and just spending more money than they're bringing in. And so you are starting to see cracks in that economy in the, you know, everyday person, I would say. And then the other thing to pay attention to, I think from this earnings season is the ability of corporates to respond to increasing costs by raising prices. So over the past couple of years you've seen a lot of consumer staple companies, your big conglomerate types, be able to pass through the costs, the increased cost of commodities, labor and other services to the consumer.
00:07:29.720 - 00:07:57.664, Speaker D: But that was because the consumer was in a much healthier spot and so they could absorb that. But now, if you continue to see some of those costs go up and there's less of an ability of those corporates to pass through that pricing to consumers, where's it going to have to come from? It's going to have to come from their bottom line. And so you're going to see margin compression as the consumer kind of tightens up. And then obviously consumption is like 70% of the US economy. So.
00:07:59.644 - 00:08:02.252, Speaker A: Are people consuming a lot and.
00:08:02.348 - 00:08:20.452, Speaker D: What are they telling you about what they're likely to consume going forward? These corporates are so good and so precise at forecasting every foot, bit of foot traffic in their stores, every bit of sales, et cetera. And so when they speak, you gotta listen. And generally, earnings season's a great time to kind of step back and be like, what's going on?
00:08:20.508 - 00:08:54.018, Speaker A: Yeah. So a number of interesting things that I'm hearing from you here and reasons why earnings matter. One obviously, that you mentioned at the top was it can help people become bullish on stocks. That can sort of change the whole attitude in the risk sentiment in the country in terms of on the investor side, which can impact things like crypto and the dollar and whatnot. But also that you're reading through some of these earnings, like looking through them to help understand, engage the consumer's health overall, which obviously has an impact later on inflation and whatnot. Right. If they're all spending a ton, then inflation could be stickier.
00:08:54.018 - 00:08:54.594, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:54.634 - 00:08:56.530, Speaker D: And it's also like, are they laying off people?
00:08:56.602 - 00:09:08.298, Speaker A: Right. You know, taxi employment situation, which is one of the Fed's mandates. Right. So very interesting. And then I wanted to ask you too, when we think about like, how does this. I guess so. So no fed speak.
00:09:08.298 - 00:09:09.210, Speaker A: No, we're talking about on the map.
00:09:09.242 - 00:09:10.386, Speaker D: We'Re in blackout right now.
00:09:10.410 - 00:09:13.882, Speaker A: Yeah. So what does that mean as they lead into the FOMC or something? They can't talk.
00:09:13.978 - 00:09:14.322, Speaker B: Correct.
00:09:14.378 - 00:09:14.974, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:15.314 - 00:09:35.268, Speaker D: And right now, like, even if they were talking, like, it's just a bunch of noise. All of them come out and like, there's a gazillion speakers every day. And it's like, I get the message, like, data's been hot. You're less likely to cut. Like you're telling me it in 15 different ways. Every governor, to be clear, you've been.
00:09:35.316 - 00:09:45.004, Speaker A: Pointing this out for several months that, like, they would probably get here and that, well, actually you weren't sure whether they would get here. You were saying they absolutely should get here and not cut because the economy was.
00:09:45.084 - 00:09:45.932, Speaker D: It's fine.
00:09:46.068 - 00:10:02.094, Speaker A: Yeah, but now it seems consensus. I mean, obviously the futures markets on rates are basically pricing in barely any cuts, like one cut, maybe one or two cuts down from what? Like seven cuts in January. They thought we were going to have.
00:10:02.134 - 00:10:46.066, Speaker D: Seven cuts, which was insane. But I mean, if you really think about it, I think your one year inflation rates are like the average high threes. Your six month stuff is now looking at probably still high threes, mid high threes. But now your three month run rate of the past couple of inflation prints is mid force. It doesn't seem like you're anywhere close to your inflation target. The one thing I would highlight as well is that market expectations for inflation are, you know, pretty important. And I think that's what you have to monitor the most.
00:10:46.066 - 00:11:00.802, Speaker D: Because if inflation just keeps continuing, these expectations are just going to like start to break out and then people are going to be like, you know, they're going to doubt the fed's ability to actually achieve their mandate and that'll make. And they're going to lose. Yeah, and they're going to lose some credibility and stuff.
00:11:00.858 - 00:11:01.074, Speaker A: Right.
00:11:01.114 - 00:11:18.058, Speaker D: But I just don't know how much more inflation people can really put up with because as we've talked before on the past episodes, like you are getting taxed because of inflation. People are going to end up spending less on tons of activities if their essentials are costing them way more.
00:11:18.106 - 00:11:37.646, Speaker A: And they are. I mean, even we all see this. I have a family. We go and buy groceries. Some single people in New York may not go to the supermarket very often, but we do. And it's been getting more expensive for years at this point. Also, looking at things like electricity, cost is going up, like gasoline, obviously, but you know, that gas, we don't drive too, too much.
00:11:37.646 - 00:11:42.526, Speaker A: I mean, it's been kind of expensive. I don't know, maybe I'm old. I remember when it was like a dollar a gallon.
00:11:42.590 - 00:11:42.886, Speaker D: No, no.
00:11:42.910 - 00:12:11.614, Speaker A: So pretty much anything over like two seems kind of expensive to me, but it's been up. But really the one that I looked at recently was the electricity bill. I was like, maybe I, unfortunately, I don't live in Texas where I can, you have a much freer market on electricity and they have a bunch of renewables. I live in one of these many parts of the country where the grid is controlled by one operator with totally opaque pricing, which is how most of the country's electricity. But it's, we're talking a fair amount and we haven't even come into those summer months with, like, summer. Yeah. Where it gets really hot.
00:12:11.614 - 00:12:26.350, Speaker A: So, um, yeah, they, they're, they're hurting. And also, you see these videos on TikTok. I'm not on there, but they get posted on X. Right. And, um, people are hurting. They're talking about it a lot, a lot of videos of people being like, how? And by the way, some of these people coming around to the. Wait a second.
00:12:26.350 - 00:12:30.270, Speaker A: Why can't we just print more money? Kind of question. Oh, yeah. Which is pretty. Getting pretty interesting.
00:12:30.342 - 00:12:30.614, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:12:30.654 - 00:12:49.470, Speaker A: Tick tock. Set to be banned in the United States. The president just signed a bill that forces the sale of it or bans it. Just as another aside here about the economy, it does seem like the consumer, the average everyday consumer, you can call them the voter, is in a lot worse shape than they are.
00:12:49.502 - 00:12:50.774, Speaker D: It's not getting any better.
00:12:50.854 - 00:12:52.046, Speaker A: Right. It's actually getting worse.
00:12:52.110 - 00:12:59.654, Speaker D: And I don't think it will get that much better. There are no magical solutions to this stuff. Like, the government's not gonna stop printing money.
00:12:59.774 - 00:13:00.822, Speaker A: In fact, they're printing more.
00:13:00.878 - 00:13:01.902, Speaker D: They're printing more money.
00:13:01.958 - 00:13:03.302, Speaker A: So, you know, like record issuance.
00:13:03.358 - 00:13:29.888, Speaker D: Right? Like, and it's just like, it comes down to, like, the wealth inequality stuff, right? Like, rich people can keep their assets, their savings and assets that are more resilient to inflation. They even appreciate, even appreciate even further, right? And so the people that own homes right now, right, as housing keeps going up, they're protected against inflation because, you know, they rent to people, and as rents go up, they'll raise their rents and they'll keep up with the inflation.
00:13:29.976 - 00:13:30.272, Speaker A: Right.
00:13:30.328 - 00:13:50.130, Speaker D: And, like, that's what people spend a lot of their, you know, money on, it is housing and stuff. And so, you know, and then if you don't own these assets and, like, if you want to hedge against inflation, gold, silver, like, those things are already trading super well at the dead highs. And, like, if you really want to keep up, you gotta have big positions in them. And so it's like, it's just so bad.
00:13:50.242 - 00:13:50.698, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:50.786 - 00:14:04.870, Speaker D: And I think, you know, like, which is crazy, but, like, part of the reason why social media exists is to keep people, like, in a malaise so that they don't focus on this stuff. But so the government probably does need TikTok. They just don't know it.
00:14:04.942 - 00:14:23.638, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, but I think right now it's working against them or they think. I mean, I don't know exactly. Why, don't get me wrong, I have no idea. But it does seem like it is a powerful tool for bytedance to impact, like a chinese company to impact America. But again, people, I've seen videos, they are furious about this. They view it as a free speech issue. This is, I thought, a free market.
00:14:23.638 - 00:14:40.104, Speaker A: It's a very strange. That's very strange. But a lot of content on there about the average, like, from people all across the country saying they can't afford basic staples, that they're working two, three jobs. And, you know, I also think about that employment number. Right? Like, a lot of that employment is part time employment, part time employment.
00:14:40.144 - 00:14:44.648, Speaker D: But it's also, the numbers are wrong. They're statistically, and they do.
00:14:44.696 - 00:14:48.728, Speaker A: Don't they update the numbers? Like, every. They're, like, way off all the time.
00:14:48.856 - 00:14:56.072, Speaker D: Well, yes, but I'll give you an example. This is the one that's really been trending recently is we're a nation of, what, 330 million people.
00:14:56.248 - 00:14:56.760, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:14:56.792 - 00:15:08.258, Speaker D: Maybe the labor force is like, 130 million people of that, or maybe a bit higher than that. But initial jobs claims every week are $210,000 or 210,000 people.
00:15:08.346 - 00:15:08.826, Speaker A: Same number.
00:15:08.890 - 00:15:31.880, Speaker D: Same number. It doesn't make sense for a population in a sample size that big that the variability is that low. It's insane to me. And it was crazy when the job market was really hot. Every single month got job revisions higher. There's a huge spread between the household survey and the employer survey. There's so many weird statistical anomalies in this data.
00:15:31.880 - 00:15:35.268, Speaker D: It's like, it's hard not to. Like, not saying you need to be.
00:15:35.276 - 00:15:37.604, Speaker A: A conspiracy theorist, but you have to wonder.
00:15:37.684 - 00:15:39.052, Speaker D: You have to question this stuff.
00:15:39.108 - 00:15:39.436, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:39.500 - 00:15:46.076, Speaker D: Like, even if I'm a fed official, like, I'm going down to the people taking surveys.
00:15:46.140 - 00:16:05.614, Speaker A: You're like the guy in the big short, right? Steve Carell's character. He's flying down and looking at it. Cause, like, the data didn't make sense. This is what I'm saying about the TikTok videos is like, look, you've got data on one hand, but then you just, like, hear from the people that it is bad. I mean, so I don't know. It's a very tough thing. Anyway, it seems like we're a little bit of holding pattern.
00:16:05.614 - 00:16:25.934, Speaker A: We got to let earnings play out. We've got. I saw, I posted this on Monday or on Tuesday that it was the lowest day, and, like, or that was the 7th lowest day ever in ETF, bitcoin ETF volumes actually quite close to the lowest, but there were some in February that were so just people like crab market people trying to just wait and see. Basically. Honestly, we don't have fed for what, several more weeks. So.
00:16:26.014 - 00:16:34.164, Speaker D: So, yeah, here's the thing. I love bitcoin. Think it's great long term holding, but has it lost a little bit of its short term momentum?
00:16:34.324 - 00:16:34.836, Speaker A: Probably.
00:16:34.900 - 00:16:48.348, Speaker D: And you can see that reflected in the volumes. In addition, you had the havning, you had the ETF. A lot of the big narratives for crypto have played out, to be frank.
00:16:48.396 - 00:16:49.144, Speaker A: That's right.
00:16:49.964 - 00:17:04.442, Speaker D: A lot of times markets need catalysts. Markets need, especially in such a speculative asset like bitcoin. You know, people like to see good momentum to continue to participate. And so, you know, to the hardcore bitcoiners, this is just noise.
00:17:04.538 - 00:17:10.210, Speaker A: Or might be just like path to. I have plenty of people who are like, this is great. We can stack here, we can stack everybody.
00:17:10.242 - 00:17:13.978, Speaker D: That's like, in the bitcoin game is like, I need more time to get more bitcoin.
00:17:14.026 - 00:17:14.426, Speaker A: Right?
00:17:14.530 - 00:17:15.506, Speaker D: Like, I gotta have more.
00:17:15.570 - 00:17:16.098, Speaker B: But it's obvious.
00:17:16.146 - 00:17:48.172, Speaker A: I mean, if you look at the ETF flows as one version, like, you can just see like huge run in February and March, and then April's been kind of like basically almost more anemic every day. I think we might have decided that we bottomed, I think, to last week. We had, I think, basically the lowest total inflow ever. The lowest for the biggest ETF's inflow, right. So I think we maybe have bottomed, but we're remember too, on that flow story with the ETF. We haven't had these wealth management platforms and stuff turn on at all yet. Our entire analysis was 14 billion in year one.
00:17:48.172 - 00:18:05.174, Speaker A: Takes us to 75k in price, all from a percentage, a small percentage of these wealth management platforms. Well, we had 13 and it brought us to seven, three, eight. And none of those platforms had turned on yet. So presumably there is more demand side to unlock. But I agree, it feels, you know, we're sort of just.
00:18:05.214 - 00:18:09.174, Speaker D: No, but, but like, that's really what you need for the long term thesis is just more.
00:18:09.214 - 00:18:11.374, Speaker A: I want multiples every month.
00:18:11.494 - 00:18:11.966, Speaker D: No.
00:18:12.070 - 00:18:12.950, Speaker A: Remember when it was 16?
00:18:13.022 - 00:18:13.446, Speaker B: Five.
00:18:13.550 - 00:18:14.718, Speaker A: I was sitting right in the seat.
00:18:14.806 - 00:18:15.118, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:18:15.166 - 00:18:17.114, Speaker A: A year and a half ago. A year and a quarter ago.
00:18:17.744 - 00:18:18.872, Speaker D: Brutal times.
00:18:19.048 - 00:18:25.216, Speaker A: Jesus. Well, we'll keep watching and we will let you know. There it is. My friend Bim netabeebeebeebe from Galaxy trading.
00:18:25.280 - 00:18:26.404, Speaker D: Thanks for having me.
00:18:27.264 - 00:18:32.392, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, Brian Wright, co head of bitcoin mining at Galaxy. Brian, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:18:32.488 - 00:18:34.704, Speaker B: Great to be here. I've always looked forward to being on this.
00:18:34.744 - 00:18:50.600, Speaker A: I've been a big fan of Brian, and we'll get into a little bit about our. We're gonna tease this to a little bit about our history together. We worked at fidelity together, but I've had Austin on, I had had Amanda on. I think Rachel had even been on from the mining team. Beazy, I think maybe was on once. I haven't had Brian on.
00:18:50.632 - 00:18:52.888, Speaker B: Maybe you had Blake, too. Hold down on.
00:18:52.936 - 00:19:07.924, Speaker A: Basically everybody but Brian has been on. But now Brian is here for our big post. Bitcoin having breakdown. So great to have you on. Galaxy brains, Brian. Bitcoin having the fourth having happened. We're in the fifth mining epoch, or supply epoch, of bitcoin.
00:19:07.924 - 00:19:22.460, Speaker A: Miners are getting 3.125 BTC now as a subsidy. It's the inflation of bitcoin. There's about six and a half, 6.25% of supply left to mine. I don't know. The event was.
00:19:22.460 - 00:19:31.796, Speaker A: So we're recording on Wednesday, this comes out on Thursday. It was last Friday. The having block 840,000. What happened?
00:19:31.900 - 00:20:08.036, Speaker B: Yeah, so a lot to talk about here, but I think the biggest story was probably transaction fees. But before I even get to that, also, there was no reorg. That was actually really interesting, because a lot of people were calling for a reorg, in that it would actually only be economically rational to try to reorg. And the rationale on that is that now that we have this concept of rare sats in this epic sat, which was the first sat in the block, mind, in this epoch, that is projected to be valued at. In the millions of dollars, actually, for that sat, many were calling for.
00:20:08.060 - 00:20:09.804, Speaker A: I'm rolling my eyes at this rare sats.
00:20:09.844 - 00:20:22.122, Speaker B: But, okay, yes, but so if there is was demand for that, you know, some people were calling, okay, let's, let's, you know, try to reorg. Actually, if you. If you're the pool that does not mine that block, so you not happen.
00:20:22.178 - 00:20:28.234, Speaker A: So block 839,999 is the last block.
00:20:28.314 - 00:20:28.722, Speaker B: Yep.
00:20:28.778 - 00:20:37.546, Speaker A: And then 840,000 gets mined. That's the first in the new epoch. And then the reorg would be rather than then if you don't win that block.
00:20:37.650 - 00:20:38.026, Speaker B: Yes.
00:20:38.090 - 00:20:44.766, Speaker A: Rather than build on top of that, you actually go back and you try to build a new chain on top of 839, 999.
00:20:44.910 - 00:20:45.390, Speaker B: Yes.
00:20:45.462 - 00:20:59.950, Speaker A: And you basically, if you end up not successful, and by the way, there was an attempt, it looked like, but it was not successful. If you end up not successful, you basically waste money mining on the wrong chain for a while. So that's the opportunity cost you're talking about here.
00:21:00.022 - 00:21:24.506, Speaker B: Yeah. So there is material opportunity costs, but it was a high transaction fee block and then with some expected extra value, but there ended up being another block mine. So block 840 thousand one 1 minute later and then maybe another one six or seven minutes after pretty fast. So we had a sequence of really fast blocks. And so there was no opportunity to. Which I think it's almost good probably that there was just like no story sort of around that. But I mean, everything went as it's supposed to.
00:21:24.506 - 00:21:31.730, Speaker B: You know, we now, we continue to have the hardest money in existence and, you know, 3.125 bitcoin. It's got harder issued. Yeah, it got even harder.
00:21:31.762 - 00:21:57.932, Speaker A: There was. I saw a small pool called spider pool, which I've never heard of, that was mining on that old block for several blocks while everyone else had moved on to just mining the heaviest chain. You know, I guess, I don't know. I was rolling my eyes at the rare sats because of all the. Of all the things in the ordinals world, this emanates from the ordinals world. Right. The idea, the concept of, well, if you're gonna individually label every satoshi, then maybe some are rarer or more valuable.
00:21:57.932 - 00:22:04.284, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's kind of silly, personally. But regardless, you're right on the market, they can go for some money.
00:22:04.364 - 00:22:06.876, Speaker B: Yeah, but the big story was really.
00:22:06.980 - 00:22:17.272, Speaker A: Fees, because that was the thing. Even if you went for that additional rare satisfaction, which could theoretically net you a bunch of money, you could also just go for the block itself because fees were so high.
00:22:17.368 - 00:22:30.864, Speaker B: Yeah. So there was over 40 bitcoin total in that first block. So block 840,000 with 3.125. The first block with 3.125 bitcoin is a subsidy. And then over 37 bitcoin in just fees. But then.
00:22:30.864 - 00:22:57.336, Speaker B: Yeah, you talked about opportunity costs. Then after that, there were a number of blocks that were actually over 20 bitcoin were high fees. So these were really, really profitable blocks to be mining. And so huge opportunity costs, not trying to mine those. So it made a lot of sense why there was no reorg attempt. But I think as a result, you know, as a miner, I had a great weekend, to be honest, and miners everywhere did. And it surprised me a little bit to the upside, which was awesome to see.
00:22:57.336 - 00:23:20.190, Speaker B: Like we and all the miners just had our best weekend in ages and actually happened post having. And you can see this on, you know, hash price is what a lot of miners like to use. And there's just this massive, massive spike over the weekend. As a result of all this runes activity. And so blocks were sustainably over ten bitcoin. I think they were averaging maybe even over ten bitcoin days. Yeah.
00:23:20.190 - 00:23:35.262, Speaker B: At least the next hundred blocks or so. And so just even some interesting stats from this. We had 20 of the top 100 blocks in total fees remind since the having.
00:23:35.318 - 00:23:35.462, Speaker A: Right.
00:23:35.478 - 00:23:57.808, Speaker B: In the last four days or so, basically. And you know, a lot of those blocks actually in the 100 blocks all time that had the most fees. You know, some of those were like really early blocks where, oh, let me send 35 bitcoin and fees. Cause it's like $5 or something like that. And then year to date we've had over 20% of all transaction fee revenue for miners since the having.
00:23:57.896 - 00:23:58.264, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:58.344 - 00:24:01.552, Speaker B: Despite, you know, that only accounting for roughly like 2% of total.
00:24:01.608 - 00:24:09.570, Speaker A: Yeah, we're in, we're what, like 75 days into the year and like 20% of all fees were mined in like the last five days.
00:24:09.642 - 00:24:23.858, Speaker B: Yeah. So you know, really early on and I, and I am expecting, you know, fees to decline. It dipped a little bit on Monday of this week. So a few days after, but then actually went back up Tuesday and we were getting two and a half, three bitcoin fee blocks most of the day.
00:24:23.906 - 00:24:28.978, Speaker A: So literally like 50% of minor revenue as late as Monday and Tuesday.
00:24:29.106 - 00:25:00.536, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And so to me that really surprised me to the upside. When I'm modeling these types of things, we certainly account for, okay, there's some expected volatility with fees, but I think myself and most miners are probably a little bit conservative because you don't know that something like this is going to happen. But it really actually could be if we see these events occur, probably not sustainably, but throughout the year, there's going to be some periods where miners are maybe more profitable than they thought they were going to be just as a result of transaction fees.
00:25:00.660 - 00:25:38.658, Speaker A: Yeah. Last year when ordinals launched, I think technically they launched at the end of December 22. But really January 23, there was like a huge fee spike around ordinals. BRC 20 specifically in like May of last year. And then it got quiet again, but then there was a big run again in the fall. So it does feel like with these types, particularly these token protocols that, I mean, well, both of these have, well, ordinals from Casey Rotomore, also runes from Casey BRC 20 built on ordinals, not from Casey. But these protocols, they're a little sporadic and volatile and when, but they can drive big fee revenue.
00:25:38.658 - 00:26:14.046, Speaker A: And presumably now that you have another one this could continue. And these fees were specifically around minting, creating these tokens. If you're creating a token, once you've created it, you don't have to create it again necessarily. It's going to be jump fits and starts. But it does feel like we've, for example, the mempool itself, the queue of pending transactions hasn't cleared in over a year, I think for the first time ever. So, yeah, there is a backlog, a perpetual backlog in people wanting to get their transaction onto the bitcoin blockchain.
00:26:14.150 - 00:26:22.808, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. And I think it's good that there's demand for block space. I think it's actually a way to measure the success of bitcoin in a way that people really want to transact on chain.
00:26:22.886 - 00:26:44.212, Speaker A: Yeah, well let's, let's dig into that a little bit more. So we got runes and ordinals. And I know many people, you know, we had Casey on this show last February. It's something we follow. I think it's undeniable that you have to follow it. It's, it's a pretty, like you said, I mean, it's a huge percentage and portion of transactions on the bitcoin network. So you just gotta look at the market and acknowledge that.
00:26:44.212 - 00:27:13.244, Speaker A: And so it's relevant. It's very, and again, if it impacts fees a lot, then it's very relevant for both users and miners and the network. What are your thoughts on ordinals generally speaking? Like, you know, I know a lot of bitcoiners are, I would say plenty are ambivalent, which I think is how I sort of think about it. But some are very hostile. They think it's spam. It's not what bitcoin was designed for. It's a Luke Dash junior said that users of ordinals are lying and tricking the code.
00:27:13.244 - 00:27:14.736, Speaker A: What are your thoughts?
00:27:14.840 - 00:27:51.078, Speaker B: Yeah, um, so I'm definitely not an ordinals expert, but I think I approach this from a bitcoin miners perspective, which really for, for me is that if it's, if it's truly bad for bitcoin, then it's bad for miners. That's not what I think I've seen to date. Granted, I don't have, you know, the strongest, strongest understanding of the space compared to others. I certainly follow it. But for me, if, if it leads to higher transaction fees for the miner, that's going to be good. And so if it's at least neutral to good for bitcoin and results in higher transaction fees, miners are probably going to support that. I think that.
00:27:51.078 - 00:27:58.958, Speaker B: And so, you know, for me, this, over the last year and a half, it's something I didn't project, but it's been really nice when we've had these periods of high transactions. So I certainly like it.
00:27:59.006 - 00:28:23.074, Speaker A: Yeah. Speaking of projections, you're, you're, uh, you come from the, the, you know, modeling world, right? Um, how have you had to, how have miners, how have you had to adjust your projections? I mean, are you now, like, building in some, like, fee multiple, like weighted, like, variable now, like before, did you even model fee? I mean, for, we went through a period, I actually published a paper in 2022 called why are bitcoin transaction fees so low?
00:28:23.154 - 00:28:23.418, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:23.466 - 00:28:30.498, Speaker A: And it was about how basically they'd been rock bottom for several years. That's not the case anymore. How are you modeling this? How are you thinking about that?
00:28:30.546 - 00:29:18.080, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a good question because you're right. Like, we almost just totally disregarded fees in our models to some extent. And it changes how you think about it, because miners, well, either model the revenue side of the equation with hash price, which is combining price and network hashrate, which are the two variables that most impact miners, into this one variable, and you just project revenue by doing your hashrate times hash price. And it's a really useful metric. I think Luxor kind of pioneered that, and that's typically the primary reference point that most use. But I think now what you see, if you look at the hash price chart over the last year, it's driven over longer time periods by price and hash rates. So if you sort of compare the hash price chart to a bitcoin price chart, they'll look fairly similar because you'll see, ok, there's a rise as bitcoin price rose.
00:29:18.080 - 00:30:09.154, Speaker B: Granted, you've also had rising hashrate over that time, which has had sort of the opposite impact. That compresses the extent to which it's rose. But where you see spikes, it's because of transaction fees. And you'll see this now it's going to be on the hash price chart forever. Is this massive spike at this having that we just had? And so now I do think it is making miners rethink. Okay, do I almost take the easy way out from a modeling standpoint and just use hash price, or do I actually dig into the underlying variables and have a row in my model for price, have a row in my model for network cash rate and have a row for transaction fees as well? And maybe you do start building in some assumptions where these transaction fees aren't just sort of a close to negligible a percent of your total revenue at like one or 2%. But now suddenly maybe you build in throughout the year a few spikes where you're expecting 50% plus of your revenue to just come from transaction fees.
00:30:09.154 - 00:30:25.524, Speaker B: And I do think that's interesting because I think it's certainly something that equity analysts that are following public miners I don't think are thinking about it kind of a deep level. I think miners themselves are thinking about it. But it also even forces some of these analysts to learn a little bit more about transaction fees and how it impacts the business items like that as well.
00:30:25.564 - 00:31:08.726, Speaker A: Yeah, I was thinking about this and you know, we don't really talk, we certainly don't talk about single name equities, but on the show. But I was on Friday night when the fees were going crazy, I was like, huh, markets close, like for equities. I wonder if like on Monday morning, like basically publicly traded miners should rip, theoretically. I mean, if you had an over the weekend news that say, I don't know, just a big tech company had a massive influx in new revenue, shouldn't the stock go up? And I don't, I didn't actually look to see, I think separately there's been weakness in equities in general, whatnot anyway, but that is, it should be part of the discussion. And by the way, with like l two s and stuff there, there are reasons why there should be higher fee environments in the future anyway.
00:31:08.790 - 00:31:28.668, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And I think for the one weekend you could brush it off and say this was a temporary thing around the having it will last for a short time period. It's not going to have a long term impact on these companies. But if you do start to see it over these much more sustained stretches over the course of months, it will actually require a little bit of rethinking that. Like did everyone actually under project total revenue that these miners were going to get?
00:31:28.716 - 00:31:55.278, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think what's funny too, to your point about this as an event, I mean, look, there was a really iconic fee event on Ethereum when Yuga Labs launched their token. I forget what the token is called, but like, not their not bored apes the collection, but they have a token. Ape. Token. I think apecoin, there was a giant, like insane, like rush to like, like claim it or I forget, whatever, like right at one moment and Ethereum network fees dramatically spiked. And you can literally always go back to that chart and see that event.
00:31:55.278 - 00:32:11.830, Speaker A: Same way you can go to the bitcoin chart, by the way, and see bitcoin fees in December 2017. And know that that was like crypto kiddies. Right? Like, and similarly, we'll be able to say runes launch. Right? Like, but. And it was predicted. I mean, literally, people are on Twitter saying a week ago, like, hey, get your transactions in now. Like, fees are probably going to go crazy.
00:32:11.830 - 00:32:42.568, Speaker A: So you actually could predict it if you were following closely. And similarly, you should be able to say, well, if this new big l two is going to launch, or if this, let's say there's another big roon project or whatever, and it's a known forward date, you should be able to predict that. And it depends how grandly, if you model without your business revenue side, without fees, then you're just being conservative. But at this point, percentage of minor revenue for bitcoin fees has historically been, like one to 5%.
00:32:42.696 - 00:32:51.204, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. We had some periods where, you know, it was like eight to 15 if, like, during this ordinals kind of period. But, yeah, I mean, for a lot of time, like 2%. Right.
00:32:51.364 - 00:33:08.588, Speaker A: Like, where do you. Let me get, like, what do you think? Like, if we just average the daily, that metric for every day of this year now, at the end of the year, what would you think it. Cause I believe we published. We actually published in somewhere. I think Sim on your team tweeted. He tweeted this chart, like, the annualized version of that number. The percent.
00:33:08.636 - 00:33:09.052, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:33:09.148 - 00:33:13.910, Speaker A: And it's like, I think last year was, like one of the biggest at like 5%. Like, what do you think it ends up being this year?
00:33:14.052 - 00:33:27.594, Speaker B: Well, so I think to date, it's probably been well below 15%. So we've got a few months. Right, where bringing down the average a little bit. And then since the having. I mean, we're probably averaging over 100%, frankly.
00:33:27.754 - 00:33:34.578, Speaker A: I think if we do every single day, it's like 59, 60%. But that's with, like, multiple hundreds of percent on Friday and Saturday.
00:33:34.666 - 00:33:40.468, Speaker B: Yeah. So this might even be a little bit conservative, but I'd probably go around 25, 30%. I'll probably be wrong on this.
00:33:40.516 - 00:33:42.788, Speaker A: I was going to guess 20. I mean, I think that's about right, though.
00:33:42.876 - 00:33:43.332, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:33:43.428 - 00:33:46.132, Speaker A: And keep in mind, obviously, the subsidy has declined by half. So, like.
00:33:46.188 - 00:33:47.564, Speaker B: Yeah, that's the thing that's worth mentioning.
00:33:47.604 - 00:33:49.100, Speaker A: It goes up no matter what, basically.
00:33:49.212 - 00:34:05.552, Speaker B: Exactly. Like, your base case is that it doubles from the beginning of the year, essentially. So then, you know, the logic is that you're doubling and then also building in some expectation that runes and ordinals are going to be a lasting thing that will actually impact, impact this stat by a few percent percentage.
00:34:05.608 - 00:34:13.680, Speaker A: Right. Yeah. Quite interesting. Hey, okay, let's talk about the rest of the year for miners because one of the other things that we, we just had a difficulty adjustment up.
00:34:13.792 - 00:34:16.488, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Probably only like 1520 blocks ago now.
00:34:16.536 - 00:34:38.095, Speaker A: Yeah. And I don't even think that I really should have checked this before we came on the air, but I'm pretty sure we've never really seen, like, positive difficulty increase after. Right. After having. Yeah, it's almost always down. Miners become, they earn half as much revenue, theoretically, and they turn off their hash rate, but it's going up. We're not seeing hash rate come off yet.
00:34:38.095 - 00:34:42.711, Speaker A: Maybe we will. What's your sort of expectation, like, into the summer for hashrate prediction?
00:34:42.807 - 00:34:51.239, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Projecting network hashrate. Something I think about like all day long and then when I'm asleep as well. It's.
00:34:51.391 - 00:34:53.511, Speaker A: Your team publishes this every year? Oh, yeah.
00:34:53.527 - 00:34:54.335, Speaker B: We look at it.
00:34:54.479 - 00:35:01.664, Speaker A: Four reports they've been under and they've projected significant growth. And then hash rate has exceeded all expectations. Yes.
00:35:01.964 - 00:35:34.940, Speaker B: So I think this recent difficulty adjustment, just for starters, the halving did occur towards the end of a difficulty epoch and so of a difficulty period. And therefore, this will be a more interesting one to me, this next one, because you'll actually have a full period post having. But I think that this having in general occurred at a very different. In a very different bitcoin price kind of period versus the previous one. Right. The previous one occurred in 2020, if I'm remembering correctly. Bitcoin price was still below $10,000 at the time.
00:35:34.972 - 00:35:35.964, Speaker A: It was like eight, eight, nine.
00:35:36.004 - 00:36:03.806, Speaker B: Yeah, eight, eight, nine, I think that's right. And so it's just different from where for where a lot of miners are in terms of, are they operating at the margins or not? Back in 2020, there were a lot of miners clearly on the margins because, you know, they maybe made, you know, purchases, plans even back in 2017, 2018, you know, when bitcoin price was over $10,000. Then three years later, you have kind of growing hash rate. You have. It's amidst a lot of price volatility during, you know, the early stages of.
00:36:03.830 - 00:36:08.630, Speaker A: COVID Yeah, it was like two months after that, March 12, 2020 crashed to like 3200.
00:36:08.782 - 00:37:04.078, Speaker B: Yeah. And so that was a more kind of dire period for a lot of miners. And you did see a ton of hash rate come offline. I think this is a little bit different in that we have seen bitcoin price appreciation this year and towards the end of last year as well, which I think bailed, frankly, a lot of miners out in terms of their need to go offline or not. Some of the statistics that we do look at, and we certainly publish as well, are just the cost of mine for miners and really their marginal cost of mine specifically, which I think about as you know, their, their power costs kind of divided by the amount of bitcoin that they mine, because that's really the point that they would rationally shut off. And so, um, you know, a lot of miners were hovering, you know, in the high teens, low 20 thousands. The halving occurs, okay, you double that number, maybe they're producing bitcoin at around 40,000 plus, some certainly higher and 50,000 plus, but still at where bitcoin prices today, well above 60,000.
00:37:04.078 - 00:37:51.484, Speaker B: I think there's still a little bit of buffer there that's resulting, actually, in most miners still remaining profitable. Not all. Um, but I think you asked also about what's going to happen over the summer. Well, maybe we may, this next difficulty adjustment, maybe we actually do continue to go up because we don't have to see that many miners go offline, especially if transaction fees end up staying high over the next couple of weeks. But I think what will happen in the summer? Um, you know, increasingly, there is a larger and larger percentage of miners that are operating in Texas. And so you kind of have this, these two competing things that are happening at the same time that I think will lead to a lot of network hash rate volatility, actually, which is that we just had a halving. This is lowering the breakeven price for a lot of the miners in Texas, and at the same time, that prices are probably going to rise in Texas from a power cost perspective.
00:37:51.484 - 00:38:36.114, Speaker B: So you have these two sort of variables going like merging together, breakeven coming down, power prices going up. And I think there's going to be a lot of curtailment activity across miners in Texas, which at this point is a meaningful percentage of the network. And so you'll see some hashrate come offline there, more curtailment activity, as I said. And I think that we'll probably have a little bit more of hashrate plateauing for a bit over the summer, unless there's some unfortunate bitcoin price event. I'm not expecting a huge amount of hashrate to come offline, but maybe we see a little bit of staggered growth as there's more curtailment, there's upgrades of machines, rather than some net new machines coming online. But I will still say my expectation is hash rate is going to be higher at the end of the year than it is today.
00:38:36.234 - 00:38:42.298, Speaker A: I can't remember with whom, but it might have been our friend Kevin from foundry.
00:38:42.426 - 00:38:43.138, Speaker B: Yep.
00:38:43.306 - 00:38:55.954, Speaker A: Or others that we. I can't remember. We made a bet and all I remember is that I said straight up 1000 x a hash or higher. And people said I was crazy. It was like 550 or so in the fall.
00:38:56.074 - 00:38:57.562, Speaker B: We could hit 1000.
00:38:57.658 - 00:38:58.922, Speaker A: Yeah, it's crazy.
00:38:59.018 - 00:39:00.094, Speaker B: It's not impossible.
00:39:00.194 - 00:39:20.622, Speaker A: Um, and so let me add this a little aside. I didn't, we didn't pre, I didn't say we might mention this, but let's talk, talk about the machines. I saw a headline today that block, uh, they've announced that they finished, I guess. I think the story is they finished building, developing their bitcoin mining ASIC chip. Um, I've actually got, I've, I've tweeted about this, but I believe. Oh, it's not in my pocket right now. I've got blocks.
00:39:20.622 - 00:39:27.598, Speaker A: Um, hardware wallet. So they've got now hardware wallet for bitcoin. Obviously, they've got cash app. Um, but they've also got an Asic.
00:39:27.726 - 00:39:28.230, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:39:28.342 - 00:39:31.558, Speaker A: And did I see Jihan Wu announce a new ASic or.
00:39:31.726 - 00:39:32.990, Speaker B: Yes, we're gonna get to two or.
00:39:33.022 - 00:39:34.390, Speaker A: 3 nm or something.
00:39:34.502 - 00:39:42.278, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. I think he, he's really bullish on, I think, where we're going in terms of the efficiency of these chips and the new types of Asics that are coming out, I really think you could.
00:39:42.326 - 00:39:45.982, Speaker A: Get like below like 7 nm, like several years ago.
00:39:46.158 - 00:39:48.022, Speaker B: It's just getting better and better and I think.
00:39:48.078 - 00:39:48.534, Speaker A: Crazy.
00:39:48.614 - 00:40:19.264, Speaker B: Yeah. I think, you know, one, I applaud everyone who's working on this. I think, like, this sort of race improving technology, I think is awesome. I think having more options out there on the market is only good for everyone in the space, actually. I think even the existing manufacturers. I think it's good to have some competition and I think it can even drive them to improve as well. It does make it hard, though, for miners making these purchase decisions because it's a really significant capex outlay when you buy machines, and you've got to get that right.
00:40:19.264 - 00:40:27.328, Speaker B: And it's tough when you don't necessarily know when the next machine is going to come out, how efficient that machine is going to be. So it also creates some uncertainty.
00:40:27.376 - 00:40:55.200, Speaker A: Yeah. Is that why miners tend, I mean, I don't know if they all do, but from what I've seen, they tend to be like we buy what's miners or we buy, you know, what do you call it? Bitmain's machines because like we just like know, like they like, you know, it's like there might be a new one that spikes that's like super good. But like we couldn't plan for that. But we know that like, you know, what's miner is delivering like pretty consistent or whatever. Like it's so much capital. They, by the way you have to send it. Like is that still.
00:40:55.200 - 00:40:59.560, Speaker A: But do you still have to prepay for machines? Remember we were talking about the fidelity like five years ago?
00:40:59.672 - 00:41:01.704, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, it's tough and I think.
00:41:01.744 - 00:41:02.944, Speaker A: Just send money off.
00:41:03.064 - 00:41:37.156, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, both and bitmain like they've produced pretty reliable machines for an extended period of time. And so those definitely are the two largest manufacturers. But yeah, it's still tough for miners. You do still have to prepay. I think both have done a good job actually of adjusting their terms a little bit to accommodate miners because I think that was a major problem in the previous cycle. And yeah, it's important to build these relationships with these miners as well so that you can at least get some sense of when the next machine has come out. And they're also increasingly offering options to maybe get an option to buy the next machine when it does come out.
00:41:37.156 - 00:41:40.504, Speaker B: If you purchased the previous machine and things like that.
00:41:40.844 - 00:41:47.948, Speaker A: Let's talk a little bit about Galaxy's mining business. I know some of our listeners are interested what's going on with it.
00:41:48.036 - 00:42:02.762, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I'm actually excited for the summer when people talk to me. Is the having, you know, bearish? Is it, is it for miners? It's like, well, it's not really bearish for miners. Like I. It's always. I always knew it was going to happen.
00:42:02.818 - 00:42:02.986, Speaker A: Right?
00:42:03.010 - 00:42:31.648, Speaker B: Like, you know, in fact, are you going to ask me four years from now if the having is bearish? No, it's like, yeah, it's always been in my model, you know, ever since I got into mining. I modeled a halving, you know, this year. That being said, for every miner, I don't, you know, I've heard some miners like, oh, I'm looking forward to the halving. I don't. I don't understand that necessarily because your revenue is going to decline, certainly. But I will say, you know, asking about our operation, the one thing I was excited about is I think that, you know, we. I don't think that there's a miner better prepared for the having than we are.
00:42:31.648 - 00:43:03.826, Speaker B: I truly think, you know, our. Helio site down in Dickens county in Texas is the best mining site in the universe. We have, you know, about 200 mw operational today and 800 mw that we're fully approved for and are building towards. And that type of scale at the lowest cost of power out there, I think, cannot be matched. And so I think that that combination, I think, makes me really, really excited for what we are building at galaxy mining.
00:43:03.890 - 00:43:16.158, Speaker A: Yeah, great to hear. I'm just. I promise we'd reference this, but. So we. We did work together at Fidelity. One of the things that we did when we were both there, we're in different jobs. You were working on bitcoin mining at fidelity and event and later running bitcoin mining there.
00:43:16.158 - 00:43:38.038, Speaker A: I was doing venture, but we did collaborate on an internal employee newsletter. Shout out any fidelity current who are listening. Crypto brief was our baby. And I recall in addition to working on that, like every Thursday night during COVID once the sort of, like, work from home had happened, we were also. We were gaming a bit, you and I. I don't think either of us have time to play Call of Duty any longer. But those were good days.
00:43:38.166 - 00:43:55.514, Speaker B: Yeah, no, we were a strong pair on Warzone, I think, you know, like going back and forth between writing updates to the whole fidelity crew on the latest in the crypto market and then turning back to some gaming. Yeah, we go back a while now. We're multiple jobs together. Yeah, we've been friends for a while.
00:43:55.634 - 00:44:01.642, Speaker A: The fidelity mafia in the house. And my friend Brian Wright, co head of bitcoin mining at Galaxy. Hey, thank you for coming on Galaxy Brains, Brian. Yeah.
00:44:01.658 - 00:44:03.014, Speaker B: This was awesome. Thank you.
00:44:03.354 - 00:44:17.584, Speaker A: That's it for this week's episode of Galaxy Brains. Thanks to our guest Bim Netabee from Galaxy trading and Brian Wright from Galaxy Mining. And my friend captain Youth for collabing on that rap. And you know what? Here it is. Let's roll it out. See you next week.
00:44:20.204 - 00:44:48.038, Speaker C: Yeah, captain, you tangible coins intangible. What was rooted in freedom became funny. And all these damn suits, they really just want money. Pointers on the fence but never gonna do nothing is we finna sell loud. Oh, we finna do something. I mean, whoa, y'all gonna pay taxes in full? We keeping on the low. That's from promise.
00:44:48.038 - 00:45:31.822, Speaker C: You don't wanna smoke but if you do, I can roll it up. That escheafa put you in a. Y'all even know what's up? Hunted bands money man, but I don't even fold this stuff. We went digital in zero nine. Y'all ain't really know enough keep tweeting, grifting, acting a fool I love that I just stag y'all watching the news wearing the mask the tiniest stag capitulated fast near the bottom at that the is too sad, but I don't feel bad for em. You get in what you deserve and I was stacked now before the habit makes it worse the supply's finna dwindle while the price is leaving earth and your market share is smaller because I got two at first meanwhile your feet are gonna inflate away and die they call it printing money but it's really stealing time every promise that they make I promise it's a lie won't you keep the CPI? Won't you open up y?
00:45:31.918 - 00:46:14.562, Speaker A: There's a thorn on the track and I'm back with a hit coin on the map it never scares when I spit forever buying the dip and fly in the whip never lyin when I'm trying to dip a couple bips yo, duo's in the room so we rap in the deuce intangible coins and hell captain of you live from the booth dead end off North Avenue preaching truth if you don't hear it now that's on you and if you won't save yourself what more could I do? I already tried to help and you thought I was a fool now you're on the sidelines like, what should I do by an hour? Wait for the price to come down? A few always ask and never act. And I said to sack sats and keep the coins pulled to avoid the black hats. A bulky big multi sig to hold the whole stack, plus a heavy ass chain that could never roll back.
00:46:14.618 - 00:46:41.530, Speaker C: I don't feel bad for them. They get in what they deserve, but I was stacked now before the heaven makes it worse. The supply's finna dwindle while the price is leaving earth and your market share is smaller because I got to at first meanwhile, your feet are gonna inflate away and die they call it printing money, but it's really stealing time. Every promise that they make, I promise it's alive. Won't you keep this CPR? Won't you open up your eye? Captain U. Intangible coins.
00:46:41.642 - 00:46:44.874, Speaker A: Live from New York City. We out here.
00:46:44.914 - 00:46:49.174, Speaker C: Dead end north dag. Yeah.
00:46:51.554 - 00:46:53.294, Speaker A: You better buy before the having.
00:46:54.314 - 00:46:55.770, Speaker C: You're running out of time.
00:46:55.962 - 00:46:56.850, Speaker A: They're stealing the time.
00:46:56.882 - 00:46:57.854, Speaker C: There's no time.
