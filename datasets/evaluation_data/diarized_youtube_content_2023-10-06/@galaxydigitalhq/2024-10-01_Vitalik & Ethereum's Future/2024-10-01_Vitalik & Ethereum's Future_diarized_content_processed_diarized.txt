00:00:00.240 - 00:00:46.225, Speaker A: I will have you know it's not frequent that the founder of Ethereum, Vitalik himself, joins these calls, but he joined this one, and he joined it to express how important that he felt it was for Pector to include a minor, even a minor DA improvement. Until peerdos is ready, he said it's worth it to implement something related to data availability. And I would like to highlight his quote Vitalik said quote the reason why we need to think about this is because realistically, it's just clear that scaling actual uses, actual usage is incredibly important. If Ethereum does not offer this, then people will find it elsewhere and people are going to have an insecure blockchain experience that is not on Ethereum.
