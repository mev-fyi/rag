00:00:06.160 - 00:01:07.808, Speaker A: The world will never be the same we believe the game cause nothing stops the train Hop on board or get out the way and hear what I'm about to say sun the corners yet to run but it's never been this good and the best is yet to come Number go up isn't just another meme It's a way to live and be optimistic about the scene so orange laser beams rising up from underneath the steam and piles of broken dreams and death that's bursting at the seams Satoshi made a motion and the world is saying second only Bitcoin is the lesson and I'm like a broken record There is no better vector or sector for most investors to bet against the never ending spending while a debtor so catch me on the TV dripping energy like TV taking on the world while making every single thing look easy I'm walking down on VC only hoodie on the block Cypherpunks are at the gate and they're never gonna stop Tell the others they are bust Cause there is no second best Leave the haters in the dust and there is no second best get on the fastest horse Cause there is no second best get your head into the game Cause there is no time to rest and there is no second f. Welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:01:07.904 - 00:01:09.248, Speaker B: An infinite amount of cash.
00:01:09.344 - 00:01:23.248, Speaker A: Cash. I'm your host Alex Thorn. The US banking system is sound and resilient. Bitcoin meeting new all time high. If you're not long, if you're not long you're short. Satoshi is going to come on there, laugh hysterically. Go quiet.
00:01:23.344 - 00:01:25.136, Speaker C: All bitcoin's going to be erased.
00:01:25.328 - 00:01:30.460, Speaker B: Bitcoin Bitcoin is the best crypto. Bitcoin is going to zero.
00:01:31.720 - 00:02:13.510, Speaker A: Welcome back to Galaxy Brains. As always, I'm your host Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Bitcoin not zero. And we have a great episode for you this week. American Hodl, well known gentleman and bitcoin bull is joining us to talk about really just all things bitcoin in the future, what the future might look like and if Bitcoin is held by nation states, how Bitcoin will help us become a space faring species and a bunch more. We'll also talk with our good friend Bimnet of BB from Galaxy Trading. As always and before we get to that I need to remind you to please refer to the link to the disclaimer in the podcast notes.

00:02:13.510 - 00:02:25.670, Speaker A: We are entering a new era and I'm not going to delay any further. So let's hop right into it. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet AB from Galaxy Trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:02:25.750 - 00:02:26.614, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:02:26.702 - 00:02:36.482, Speaker A: What a fun time. It continues to be an exciting, exciting time. Bitcoin made a new all time high today and yesterday we're down a little bit from it, but I mean we're down to 93.7.
00:02:36.586 - 00:02:37.250, Speaker B: I know.
00:02:37.370 - 00:02:38.498, Speaker C: God forbid.
00:02:38.674 - 00:02:40.270, Speaker A: What's it feel like to you in the market?
00:02:41.770 - 00:02:54.130, Speaker C: It feels like there is maximum euphoria. I think most folks that are in bitcoin are pretty stretched in terms of their positioning.
00:02:54.210 - 00:02:58.388, Speaker A: Something like 99.5% of all Bitcoin UTXOs are in profit.
00:02:58.474 - 00:03:10.032, Speaker C: Yes. So everybody's in profit. And the main story really is with respect to Michael Saylor, obviously they are buying a ton of bitcoin.
00:03:10.096 - 00:03:11.584, Speaker A: He's ahead of schedule, even from what.
00:03:11.592 - 00:03:25.268, Speaker C: He said, just way ahead of schedule. And the stock has been trading really well and it looks like he's going to be able to do more and more in a quicker manner as well.
00:03:25.324 - 00:03:30.244, Speaker A: It's what he's telegraphing, it's what he's saying. Yeah, he's all over the Internet.
00:03:30.372 - 00:03:31.720, Speaker C: Yeah, no, absolutely.
00:03:32.060 - 00:03:42.420, Speaker A: We ran this too. I mean not to none of this is investment advice but Microstrategy I think is the top risk adjusted best sharp ratio.
00:03:42.500 - 00:03:43.540, Speaker C: I think it's got a sharp around.
00:03:43.580 - 00:03:46.516, Speaker A: Like 6 over 4. Over 4 is what we saw. But that's just year to date.
00:03:46.548 - 00:03:55.293, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like the best performing stock out there. It's large trade like $15 billion.
00:03:55.392 - 00:03:59.580, Speaker A: MicroStrategy owns more than 1.5% of all the bitcoin today.
00:03:59.700 - 00:04:00.092, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:04:00.156 - 00:04:02.684, Speaker C: And that's a great thing because they don't sell.
00:04:02.772 - 00:04:03.440, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:04.020 - 00:04:43.416, Speaker C: And so I think there's a lot of folks that are paying attention to the Saylor story and the microstrategy story. Bitcoin has broken all time highs. It's seeing follow through. Clearly the Trump administration is much more pro crypto than the last administration and the officials that have been appointed and the folks that influence him the greatest seem to be folks that are invested in the, not the success per se, but in the legal viability and pathway and clarity that crypto really needs.
00:04:43.488 - 00:04:44.260, Speaker A: That's right.
00:04:44.640 - 00:05:27.990, Speaker C: And so I think things are looking really good for bitcoin. I would just caution that there is Definitely resistance at 100k, we see it in the order books. It's a nice big round number. And so if folks are a bit cautious, I definitely think that that 100k level should hold on the first test at the very least and subsequently thereafter we'll see what happens. I do think you're probably talking about a bitcoin price north of 100k for 2025, but inside of 2024. I think breaking that 100k level is going to be challenging.
00:05:28.070 - 00:05:47.014, Speaker A: Yep, I think that's right. I think obviously on a longer timeframe, I think nothing stops this train. It feels like we're going much higher. I think you see this priced in that, you know, the bitcoin ETF options launched and tons of volume around the 100k calls and on higher spikes.
00:05:47.062 - 00:05:48.010, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:05:48.670 - 00:05:55.718, Speaker A: So people are anticipating higher prices. But yeah, it does feel like you can't. Like what more positive news can we really get at this point?
00:05:55.774 - 00:05:56.550, Speaker C: No, absolutely.
00:05:56.630 - 00:05:57.702, Speaker A: So it's kind of hard to see.
00:05:57.726 - 00:05:59.750, Speaker C: What, you know, there's a lot of optimism baked in.
00:05:59.790 - 00:06:01.174, Speaker A: Yeah, there is, there is, there is.
00:06:01.262 - 00:06:54.896, Speaker C: And, and that's, you know, if you look at the traditional markets, right, you know, stocks ripped right after the Trump election on hopes of, you know, deregulation and tax cuts and they've reverted back a ton since. And so, you know, when you have crowded positioning, that leads to some vulnerability. And so, you know, I definitely think that there's some signs that are flashing a bit red at the moment, basis being one of them. So we've seen elevated funding levels for a while now in crypto and you know, spots at the dead highs, you know, vols, longer dated stuff starting to pick up a little bit as well with some of the, you know, the options activity. Yeah, but yeah, I mean, can we also talk about how we're now, we now have options, I know, publicly traded options, no credit, occ, credit risk.
00:06:54.968 - 00:07:04.798, Speaker A: It's crazy because, you know, Galaxy, one of the biggest options dealers in the world, but over the counter only does and us and our competitors in that market only service institutional investors. Really?
00:07:04.854 - 00:07:05.374, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:07:05.502 - 00:07:19.918, Speaker A: American retail investors and retail investors make up 44% of all equity options activity. So almost half shout out to Kelly Greer for pulling that stat. They've had no way to do options on bitcoin at all in the US in general.
00:07:19.974 - 00:07:20.462, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:07:20.526 - 00:07:24.030, Speaker A: There's CME options. Right. But that's, I think, also basically institutional only.
00:07:24.150 - 00:07:30.492, Speaker C: The CME is institutional only you can buy inside your ETF that holds the futures.
00:07:30.636 - 00:07:34.796, Speaker A: Oh, the futures ETFs had options. Yes, that was the Only real way.
00:07:34.868 - 00:07:35.788, Speaker C: The only real way.
00:07:35.844 - 00:07:46.796, Speaker A: Now it's like, I mean. Correct. Access are probably going to get these in like fintech apps like Robinhood will probably be adding this, I would just assume. Right. They do tons of business on. Right. They, they were huge on Meme Coins.
00:07:46.796 - 00:08:03.784, Speaker A: Dogecoin at one point was like most of their revenue or at least half of their revenue back in 21. They love the. All that Gamestop trading was on Robinhood. A lot of it. Right. So I think that that's not even. I don't even think that's the biggest story about the ETF options, but it's a big part of it.
00:08:03.784 - 00:08:05.720, Speaker A: Retail can trade these options now.
00:08:05.840 - 00:08:25.820, Speaker C: No, and retail, as you correctly highlighted, has a huge influence on this market. And so I think fundamentally it is a positive catalyst for Bitcoin because it also introduces hedging capabilities for US investors. They can sell calls, they can buy puts.
00:08:26.230 - 00:08:28.398, Speaker A: It makes it more attractive to hold the etf.
00:08:28.494 - 00:08:29.118, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:08:29.214 - 00:08:34.622, Speaker A: Also it reduces volatility or lets them take bigger position sizes because they can hedge and stuff, right?
00:08:34.646 - 00:09:31.786, Speaker C: Yes, correct. And it enhances liquidity generally because options market makers have to buy and sell ton more spot. So the market becomes more liquid from a spot standpoint when you have the options and more folks will look at it because they can hedge stuff and speculate a little bit easier. So yeah, this is a very positive development for the market. And I think you're correctly right in highlighting Robinhood activities because I think last week they recently allowed tokens that they had been more cautious on to list on their platform. And so with this upcoming change in the sec, I think you'll start to see more tokens kind of being listed by Coinbase, by Robinhood and other exchanges that offer access to retail. All in all, these are very healthy, constructive developments.
00:09:31.786 - 00:09:59.826, Speaker C: I think Bitcoin would certainly be higher right now though, if you didn't have some of these geopolitical tensions going on in the market. I think those are front of mind for a lot of investors right now. You know, basically the latest is over the past two days, Ukraine has launched long range missiles into Russia and Russia has responded by being like, this is not good. And you know, the nuclear threat updated.
00:09:59.858 - 00:10:02.514, Speaker A: Their nuclear usage threat and stuff.
00:10:02.562 - 00:10:03.442, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:10:03.506 - 00:10:25.472, Speaker C: And you know, there were some headlines out overnight being like, you know, Putin's open to a ceasefire if you draw, draw the borders as they're currently constructed, et cetera. And so I think there's some openness to negotiating with the US once the Trump administration is in. Yeah, but for the time being, the Ukrainians are escalating.
00:10:25.536 - 00:10:48.174, Speaker A: Yeah. Which is rational, unfortunately, because when you have, I think that the Trump team has pretty implicit, pretty explicitly implied. I know that's explicit. Implicit that they would work towards a negotiated settlement. And so now you've got like a ticking clock. Right. And you effectively want in any sort of negotiation to go in with the strongest hand possible.
00:10:48.262 - 00:10:48.606, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:10:48.638 - 00:10:56.302, Speaker A: So they assume like day one. Yeah, yeah. So you could expect some, I would say, heightened tensions between now and the Trump administration taking office.
00:10:56.406 - 00:11:11.252, Speaker C: No, absolutely. And you're, you're, you're seeing that take hold in currency markets pretty aggressively. Euro is back down to almost 105, the figure which is like crisis, like initial Russian invasion.
00:11:11.316 - 00:11:13.028, Speaker A: One being water.
00:11:13.084 - 00:11:13.556, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:13.668 - 00:11:23.828, Speaker C: So you're 5% away from parity with the dollar and so you know, like that's a big deal.
00:11:23.884 - 00:11:25.076, Speaker A: That shows a lot of concern.
00:11:25.228 - 00:11:28.372, Speaker C: A ton of concern. Yeah. In that market. And so.
00:11:28.476 - 00:11:43.258, Speaker A: Well, keep your eye on the geopolitics and you know, don't everybody stay safe out there. I guess we're getting a crazy volatile. I mean it's all up spot up as the regime we've been in since the election. But you know, we'll keep following it.
00:11:43.394 - 00:11:43.882, Speaker C: Brilliant.
00:11:43.946 - 00:11:46.554, Speaker A: Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Trading, my friend, thank you so much.
00:11:46.642 - 00:11:47.830, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:11:49.810 - 00:11:54.590, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, American Hodl. My friend, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:11:55.250 - 00:12:03.232, Speaker B: Very good to be here. I feel like, you know, we've been meaning to do this for a while but we haven't done it yet. But we always are seeing each other person at conferences and etc.
00:12:03.376 - 00:12:18.480, Speaker A: Yeah, it's the best. We had a great time at Peter McCormack's conference cheat code earlier this year. It was like, it was like I was seeing like American Werewolf in Paris. We were kind of like American Werewolves like bum, bum willing. Around the streets of Bedford uk. I think people were like, what is going on here?
00:12:18.520 - 00:12:26.240, Speaker B: Dude, that was amazing. I, I love wandering around Europe with other Americans and just looking down our nose and disgust at everything like, what is this?
00:12:26.360 - 00:12:27.250, Speaker A: I know.
00:12:27.440 - 00:12:29.550, Speaker B: Hey, you know, this place was good.
00:12:29.590 - 00:12:43.006, Speaker A: Like hundreds of years ago. It's been hundreds of years the year. Not, not that this is the purpose of the pod, but the euro right now is almost like heading towards dollar parity. It's doing terrible. It's down half a percent today. It's crazy.
00:12:43.038 - 00:12:50.542, Speaker B: That's crazy. Wasn't it like, like, I don't know, 15% higher or something at one point? It's down all the way back to parity.
00:12:50.686 - 00:13:17.636, Speaker A: Yeah, I think right now they're like, concern in Europe about the Ukraine, Russia situation, knowing that President elect Trump is likely to force a settlement. So both sides are probably going to be super aggressive now until then to try to, like, increase their bargaining position. But, you know, there was all that stuff. Anyway, that's not what we're here to talk about. You know, Hodl and I. I think I first met Hodl virtually on Clubhouse, but I had heard there was a great. There's a great episode you did.
00:13:17.636 - 00:13:28.012, Speaker A: I think most of us. I first heard of you when you did this great, like, frankly famous episode of Tales from the Crypt with Marty and Matt. Like, it was like 2019 maybe or something. I forget.
00:13:28.076 - 00:14:06.948, Speaker B: That was a legendary episode. Yeah, it was September ish of 2019. And I flew into Brooklyn where they were doing the show back then at that time, and, you know, it seemed like a big deal to, like, fly for a podcast. You know, I'm flying out to go on this, like, crazy niche, small weirdo bitcoin, Joe Rogan, which is, like, kind of what it was at the time. But, like, to me, it was the most important podcast in the world, and all of us, you know, hardcore bitcoiners were listening to it. And so, yeah, I flew out there, did that thing with those guys, and I remember reveling in the feeling of being right when the whole world was telling us we were wrong. So the bitcoin price was very.
00:14:06.948 - 00:14:29.692, Speaker B: It had gotten beaten down tremendously at that point. It was probably somewhere around like five or six thousand dollars. It had gone to 3200 at the lows. And then we were climbing our way back, but slowly, and it still seemed like a secret that, you know, it was only us, you know, the. The guy, the crazy guys who stuck around after 2017 who seemed to know what was going on. So that that podcast was kind of like, reveling in that moment.
00:14:29.756 - 00:14:42.150, Speaker A: We. We can revel now. I mean, what is the. I mean, bitcoin started the year last year, 2023, at 16. 5. And as we record this on Wednesday, November 20, it's 94. 5.
00:14:42.150 - 00:14:46.490, Speaker A: So that's a big, big jump. Big, big jump.
00:14:46.650 - 00:14:50.922, Speaker B: Is it not crazy that we're 6% away from a hundred thousand dollars? Does that not seem insane?
00:14:50.986 - 00:15:00.538, Speaker A: Are you even excited about it? Because some. Somebody was asking here today, like, aren't you, like, euphoric? And I was like, honestly, I think I'm dead inside at this point. Like, I'm just, you know. Yeah, like, yeah, it's what we always.
00:15:00.594 - 00:15:30.942, Speaker B: Thought it feels like we're owed a hundred thousand from 2021 and we didn't get it in 21. So like this time, like in. If we would have had a hundred thousand dollar party in 21, right? Like Michael Saylor's throwing a hundred thousand dollar party. If we would have done that four years ago, it would have felt like a celebration. But now it just feels like the kickoff party to, to the year's event. Because I think we all believe that 25 is going to be extremely bullish and possibly with, with the red wave and the Trump administration. 26, 27, 28, 20.
00:15:30.942 - 00:15:31.918, Speaker B: Do we just keep going?
00:15:31.974 - 00:15:46.762, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's very possible. I, I've sort of been saying like the next, you know, 18 to 24 months, just thinking like then there's maybe, but like at least the whole setup is from a political and policy standpoint is set for like two years basically.
00:15:46.826 - 00:16:34.992, Speaker B: Well, yeah, one of the things, I mean, you talk to the same guys, right? So like one of the things I've been hearing is that the strategic bitcoin reserve, the sbir, if it happens, it's going to happen soon, sooner rather than later, which to me signals first year of the Trump presidency and if it happens during the first year of the Trump presidency and that coincides with, you know, these, these very bullish, you know, tailwinds for, for bitcoin, like the sky is the limit in terms of price. I mean, we could gap up to a million dollars tomorrow because America is stacking bitcoin and they're stacking a million plus bitcoin that, I mean, we all, we all said this was going to happen, but like, let's be real, we were just nerds in a high school auditorium somewhere saying this was going to happen. And now we're like on the world stage. You know, people are inviting us onto yachts and things like that.
00:16:35.096 - 00:16:52.284, Speaker A: It's crazy because you're totally right. I mean even that the US Might do it. Basically every one of our allies and competitors should do something. They'd have to do something. It doesn't really matter if you like it or not. If your top competitor likes it a lot, you better have a strategy, right? It could be anything.
00:16:52.332 - 00:17:36.438, Speaker B: Like, you can't, you can't, you're on notice. And I also think that, you know, there's a, there are rumors that someone in the Gulf is going to announce, you know, in the next few weeks, and that is either, you know, Qatar, UAE or Saudi, and we're going to find out soon. And apparently they have a six figure amount of bitcoin. So like you know, a microstrategy level of bitcoin and you know, what, what does that mean? What does that mean for the petrodollar relationship? What does that mean for geopolitics? What does that mean for global trade? I don't know. But I know that it's going to put pressure on America's politicians to get this SBR ram through. If Saudi announces or UAE announced whoever, you know, if the Gulf is doing that over there, like that puts our petrodollar relationship at risk. And so we have to ensure basically that that continues.
00:17:36.534 - 00:17:57.958, Speaker A: Yeah, we have to be on the same page. I mean, and those guys are kind of like the new Switzerland. Right. Like the Gulf countries are, they straddle east and west, literally like geographically, but also even like, you know, uae, those guys deal with China and Iran as well. Right. And Russia. So like they're kind of like right there in the center now of this, you know, especially energy dominated world.
00:17:57.958 - 00:17:58.726, Speaker A: That's crazy.
00:17:58.758 - 00:18:09.758, Speaker B: I mean something that Michael Saylor said yesterday is that he believes that he has seen sovereign wealth funds buying MSTR now ahead of what they believe is a potential SBR announcement.
00:18:09.854 - 00:18:10.174, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:10.222 - 00:18:45.270, Speaker B: And I mean, so if that's true and that they're already here like that, I just don't even know what to think if we're at nation state level stacking it. Like I've thought about the game theory forever because it's a perfect prisoner's dilemma. And in a prisoner's dilemma the optimal move is to go first. So as an American, obviously I want America to go first and bang the trade hard. And I'm just hoping that we have the leadership to do that here in America because it would be one of the things that sets us up for the next 50, 100 years and also helps offset our deficit by something like I've seen estimates like 16 to 20 trillion. That's a crazy chunk out of the deficit, man. We could actually get America prosperous again.
00:18:45.390 - 00:19:03.750, Speaker A: Yeah, it doesn't make any sense to ignore. I think that's obvious to me. It's like I'd be shocked. I agree. It probably should happen fast because the more you start talking about it, the harder I think it would get for American politicians to do. Because it's like I've always said that like every global reserve currency in the history of the world has failed. Right.
00:19:03.750 - 00:19:38.908, Speaker A: Like, like that there's a linear, there's only one at a time. And so you're you're, you'd have to believe in the end of history to think that the dollar will be forever the global reserve. And then you start saying if you're thinking long term, like, well, if it's not going to be the dollar, what would we want it to be? Well, we definitely don't want it to be like the Chinese remibi or like the Russian ruble. Right. So wouldn't we prefer if it's not ours, that it's some global decentralized, non sovereign thing, even gold? I mean, but, but bitcoin seems to fit. It's just like, you know, we can only, our politicians, our political structure is set up so that like they can only think like a couple years in advance. Right.
00:19:38.908 - 00:19:42.108, Speaker A: So that's why I think it also, if it happens, has to happen quickly.
00:19:42.204 - 00:20:01.472, Speaker B: Oh, 100%. I think there's a category error here that we all make. I agree with you that all fiat currencies have failed. And because we know that all fiat currencies have failed, bitcoiners get in the, get in the habit of thinking that, you know, Weimar style hyperinflation is just around the corner. It's lurking around the corner at any time. And so we have this word for that, which is hyper bitcoinization. Right.
00:20:01.472 - 00:20:26.624, Speaker B: Which is when the world just suddenly wakes up and understands bitcoin. But hyper bitcoinization is like a religious rapture and it's not actually a real concept. The other thing that we've never had is we've never had a world reserve currency that's a fiat currency. So actually we're in truly uncharted territory here. And we don't know what the game is going to look like. But I think we're starting to see what the game looks like going forward. And it looks like sort of a slow, orderly transition.
00:20:26.624 - 00:20:46.780, Speaker B: Like I hesitate to say that because, you know, I'm a bitcoiner and I've been with the crazy libertarians for 10 years now and I, I kind of believe the Weimar stuff. But then there's another part of me that the rationalist side that's going, is this just all working out like we're just slowly and methodically moving the world, transitioning the world to the new digital economy? Yeah, it kind of seems that way.
00:20:46.900 - 00:21:09.642, Speaker A: I mean, when you see Larry Fink talk about it, he's been incredibly thoughtful in saying it's not a risk asset. Right. It's not, shouldn't be thought of as a risk and growth asset. It's a, it's a hedge against debasement. That's what they, they aggressively pitch this. And I've struggled to make this case for years. Like be, you know, because for example, you know, like CPI goes up but bitcoin doesn't hedge against that.
00:21:09.642 - 00:21:31.806, Speaker A: Well, that's not what we meant. You know, it's like very nuanced and they're just out here like, you know. Right. I think of it more like the monetary supply. Like if you look at like Global M2, it like looks a little bit better, like reacts to that than the CPI or whatever. And, and you know, I'm like struggling with these nuances and trying to be like extreme and they're just out here like pounding the fist, like pounding the table with their fist saying no, Bitcoin is an inflation hedge. Period.
00:21:31.958 - 00:21:39.166, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it's, it's, it's crazy. I, you know, Paul Tudor Jones had that framework he came out with in 2020 or 2019.
00:21:39.318 - 00:21:40.222, Speaker A: May 2020.
00:21:40.326 - 00:22:01.360, Speaker B: Yeah. Bitcoin is the fastest horse in the race. And that is, that is my framework. I think I took that from him. And you know, when you think about the monetary inflation that's going on. So you know, Saylor just gave a talk at Cantor recently where he talked about this and he was like, you know, the world is actually going to look more or less the same. Equities are going to continue increasing, gold is going to continue increasing, but bitcoin is going to increase at a much higher rate.
00:22:01.360 - 00:22:04.464, Speaker B: I think it was something like 280x he had in his slide.
00:22:04.512 - 00:22:04.864, Speaker A: Right.
00:22:04.952 - 00:22:31.706, Speaker B: So like, okay, equities are going to do like you know, 6x and like gold's going to do like 2x. Bitcoin's going to do 280x. So if you are an investor who's aware of this macro trend of, you know, continued monetary inflation forever, which I think we all are at this point. Do you want to ride on the slow horse? Gold? You want to write? You want to take gold to the prom? No, it's, it's bitcoin. Like you want the best bang for your buck in terms of, you know, value accrual.
00:22:31.818 - 00:22:39.866, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. I think it's just the trade is so clear and God, the other cryptos have been just so wrecked in its wake this year. It's been amazing.
00:22:39.978 - 00:22:46.810, Speaker B: It's kind of beautiful. Right. They're all just collapsing down into meme coins, which is a, it's a self admission that we're worthless.
00:22:47.310 - 00:22:47.830, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:47.910 - 00:22:49.606, Speaker B: I mean we suck.
00:22:49.718 - 00:22:58.250, Speaker A: Yeah. Basically none of the big ideas have happened. Right. I mean, there, you know, there's some defi. But it's just crypto money in there. Right. It's not like it hasn't permeated.
00:22:58.250 - 00:23:10.940, Speaker A: Yeah, it is that. We've been calling it the barbell market. You've got like deep value, long term, store value, bitcoin on one side and then just like the, the most vacuous, like speculative, speculative trading ever in crypto on the other side.
00:23:11.110 - 00:23:26.064, Speaker B: This, by the way, this mirrors Weimar a bit because people who don't know their history, if you haven't read the book, when money dies. In Weimar, people were gambling on stocks. So that's exactly what's happening now. It's just we have a more pure form of gambling on stocks and it. You just buy a picture of a monkey.
00:23:26.192 - 00:23:28.736, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. It's.
00:23:28.768 - 00:23:42.980, Speaker B: So it's actually like in the early days of shitcoins, I used to get upset and angry because shitcoins were, they were lying and they were saying they were going to displace. I think everyone knows they're not going to displace bitcoin. And bitcoin is king. That's. That's clear across the board. Right. So I don't have to like fight them anymore.
00:23:42.980 - 00:23:51.236, Speaker B: Yeah, but like the meme coin game is just, it's very honestly a game of hot potato. It's like, hey, I'm buying this for a thousand bucks. I want to sell it to you for 10,000.
00:23:51.308 - 00:24:04.468, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's right. It's what I always appreciate about dogecoin. I wrote a paper in 2021 called Dogecoin, the most honest shitcoin. And that's, that was basically the thesis. I was like, look, it has no pre. Mine. It's a fair launch.
00:24:04.468 - 00:24:22.332, Speaker A: So that, that alone, there's no insider, it's proof of work. It's. It's all the basic sort of bitcoin launch style and with just none of the pretension, no promises, no grand vision at all. No not going to be a new Bitcoin, just a joke. Just, just exists for no reason at all. And I always respected that about the Doge.
00:24:22.476 - 00:24:37.030, Speaker B: So whereas the other things, like the things that are, you know, trying to appear as though they're, they're real and tangible, like Ethereum are just getting decimated. Right. Somebody said on Twitter today, they said, if Bitcoin is a digital goal good, does that mean that Ethereum is a digital bad?
00:24:38.130 - 00:25:09.924, Speaker A: I mean, it's been, dude, it's honestly, I have to. I'll even, I'll Even throw some. Some sympathy for the Ethereum investors because, I mean, it's down 62% against Bitcoin since the merge. It's still going lower. I even tweeted I thought that and I still do think, but again, it's not happening yet for sure that, you know, like a more permissive SEC is net better for ETH and altcoins than it is for bitcoin, But. And so I was like, maybe this is the low, you know, for Eth btc and it just has gone lower and lower, I think. I don't know anyone.
00:25:09.924 - 00:25:17.108, Speaker A: Kobe. You see Kobe's thread today, like, about how he doesn't own any. Yeah, he used to be like an Ethereum influencer.
00:25:17.204 - 00:25:34.098, Speaker B: They're running up against the ceiling, this. This ceiling of scale, right? So like, it's now, we're now at an institutional level across the board that you can't find any more retail money to pump this thing. And surprise, surprise, the institutional guys are really fucking smart and they do their diligence and they're looking at ETH and they're saying, what the fuck is this for?
00:25:34.234 - 00:25:40.706, Speaker A: What is this? You know, and do you even need the asset? Like, even if you want to use it, you don't need to store your money in it.
00:25:40.858 - 00:25:47.310, Speaker B: I mean, mstr, a company that just buys bitcoin is kicking the shit out of ETH in terms of performance.
00:25:48.250 - 00:25:56.630, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. What do you think, Saylor? I haven't seen him talk about this yet, but what. I mean, I think he's. I think he said he's for it, but the strategic Bitcoin reserve, I mean.
00:25:56.730 - 00:26:16.366, Speaker B: You know, like at the end of his Cantor talk, he actually provides the strongest argument for the strategic Bitcoin reserve that I've heard yet. And he. He basically analogizes it to. The way to think about it is, you know, go west, young man. Right. Like, for a long time in humanity, we just kept moving further west. And then America was the new frontier.
00:26:16.366 - 00:26:46.978, Speaker B: And then, you know, we colonized America and went to the moon and all the great things happened, but there's no more space left. And like the edge of the world, California, is in steep decline. So where do you go now? You go to cyberspace. And so buying a million or 2 million or 3 million or 4 million bitcoin, that is equivalent to like a Louisiana Purchase or the Alaska Purchase. It is one of these. Buying Manhattan real estate in the early 1600s, like, you want to skate to where the. The puck is going in the future.
00:26:46.978 - 00:27:05.050, Speaker B: And that's the case put forward by Saylor. And I think it's a very strong analogy because a lot of people say like why should we gift the bitcoin bros. This free transfer from the American tax base directly into their pockets. And it's like it's not actually about us. We happen to be like barnacles riding on a whale. And we just got here early. Right.
00:27:05.050 - 00:27:19.714, Speaker B: And so like you can be mad at the barnacles but you can't really be mad at the whale because it's just a force of nature. Bitcoin is just something that's happening and America is going to have to get on board or get left behind just like every other individual corporation organization on earth and country.
00:27:19.882 - 00:27:40.834, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's right. That's when I look at the. You know what Bitcoin can do in a portfolio, right. When we do this analyses on Sharp and it's the third best performer of the year on a risk adjusted basis also. I mean on an absolute basis it's close to the best. If not, you know, it's probably that or micro Micro Strategy is number one on a risk adjusted basis. Nvidia is number two and Bitcoin is number three.
00:27:40.834 - 00:28:13.436, Speaker A: Ethereum is like 25 of the of the like of the ones that we even looked at. Right. I mean we basically this is looking at all the Mag 7 stocks, all the bank stocks. So banks top top stocks, banks, tech, all the indices, commodities and fixed income basically like not bothering to do like every. But it's just when you look at that data we know it's true that like a small allocation in a portfolio can increase the Sharpe ratio and uncorrelated. But that, that holds true for an individual, it holds true for an endowment, it's true for a business. It works in any situation.
00:28:13.436 - 00:28:17.330, Speaker A: Like it doesn't matter. You can scale that into like sort of any use.
00:28:17.500 - 00:28:57.584, Speaker B: Yeah, not only that Alex, but it is true for the market broadly. So MSTR is looking at NASDAQ inclusion here. It's coming up shortly. I think next week is when they take the snapshot and there's a strong possibility that MSTR gets added to the queues. Which means if MSTR gets added to the queues, that 400,000 bitcoin just got added to the queues. So if you're a passive indexer, you are now taking advantage of Bitcoin's accretive value into the future. I mean so now every indexer in America and in and in the world globally, you know, because the Q's are a very Popular product is looking at the SBR if they're smart and saying Trump, get it done.
00:28:57.584 - 00:29:00.220, Speaker B: Because you're pumping all of our bags here.
00:29:00.600 - 00:29:17.356, Speaker A: Yeah, it just makes a lot of sense to nation states need like something to store large amounts of wealth in that they can control inside their borders. And that's basically been gold historically. But you can't do anything with gold. You can't even send it. You can't. You can barely like settle with gold. You're not have to send a warship.
00:29:17.356 - 00:29:27.480, Speaker A: Right. Didn't like France have to send a warship to pick up their gold in the 1970s after Nixon suspended convertibility like 100%. It's not feasible. It's just like.
00:29:27.860 - 00:29:48.730, Speaker B: Well, it's also, you know, for Fort Knox is centralized. And so I mean, I think Fort Knox is pretty well defended, right? Yeah. The odds of somebody breaking into Fort Knox and, and stealing all the gold are rare. But what if somebody has a Superman style villain plan? I think Lex Luthor tried to do this in one of the movies where he irradiated. He wanted to irradiate all the gold in Fort Knox. Right. So that you couldn't use it, you couldn't go near it.
00:29:48.730 - 00:30:00.318, Speaker B: With, with a bitcoin strategic bitcoin reserve, we can do a distributed multi sig across America's army bases here on Earth. So it's like, I mean if you do a three of five, right. We got a key in Fort Knox, we got a key at Fort Bragg, we got.
00:30:00.374 - 00:30:24.106, Speaker A: I was just going to ask you this, like where how should it be held? Because you know, some people have wondered with like El Salvador, like I don't know how they are holding their bitcoin. But you, you know, if Bukele were to leave, you of course would want the bitcoin to stay with the government of El Salvador, like the country. Right. Same thing with our, you know, you don't want the president ne necessarily to have like unilateral ability to move the coins. Like what, what would be your ideal multi sig setup for the guy?
00:30:24.138 - 00:30:40.026, Speaker B: Well, yeah, we need a 3 of 5 multi sig and then there needs to be a series of conditional procedures around that which is something you can do with hierarchical key control. You know, and there are technologies that enable that like, you know, mini script not to pump my own bags. I'm an investor Anchor Watch, called Anchor Watch, which is a new insurance.
00:30:40.058 - 00:30:42.730, Speaker A: Insurance we've had, we've had Rob Hamilton on this show. So.
00:30:42.770 - 00:31:18.398, Speaker B: Right. Yeah, they're doing really interesting things. And so I think the, the Way it looks is it's some type of multisig with hierarchical key control. And then you know, there are on top of that, you know, nuclear style procedures for who's allowed to operate the keys, when and how. And you know, those are all military chain of command things. And then after that I think we take it a step even further and we time lock the bitcoin into the future so that greedy politicians can't get their hands on it and sell it. Because this is, you know, the, the our children, this is their birthright.
00:31:18.398 - 00:31:24.750, Speaker B: And I don't want, I don't want the next administration coming in and saying this bitcoin thing. We're going to dump it all at market, you know.
00:31:24.790 - 00:31:33.902, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like the, there was this during the great financial crisis. Chicago like sold the forward, sold the revenue for every parking meter in the city.
00:31:34.006 - 00:31:35.838, Speaker B: And now the Saudis or somebody owns.
00:31:35.854 - 00:31:56.514, Speaker A: It like yeah, for like a hundred years. And they did it for just like a couple billion dollars. I know like now they can't. And it screws them up. They can't like do parades at. So I think if they close a street so cars can't park there, they have to pay the Saudis what they would have made like basically in perpetuity for just a couple billion dollars. They did this and it's like that's, that's your city streets.
00:31:56.642 - 00:32:23.346, Speaker B: Absolute insanity. And it shows the short sightedness of politicians. And you know, I think that if we are going to analogize it to the Alaska Purchase or the Louisiana Purchase, we wouldn't allow politicians to sell Louisiana. Look how well that worked out for Napoleon, you know what I mean? Like it's, it's not a good move. So we should put procedures in play and we can, we can enforce this in code. That's one of the beautiful things about bitcoin is like we can actually time lock the bitcoin and then there's not a goddamn thing you can do about it. It is time.
00:32:23.498 - 00:32:40.842, Speaker A: It's amazing. I just can't believe that this is like a legitimate, this isn't a crazy conversation we're having right now. This is totally legitimate. It's totally relevant. Yeah, it is. I mean I, I was clipping. I watch Bloomberg TV most days, like because I have the terminal so it's open just in front of me.
00:32:40.842 - 00:33:09.888, Speaker A: And like they were on, on Monday. They like, they were just randomly speculating, the hosts just speculating about the strategic reserve. I clipped that like they had the, like, I mean multiple times they asked me, I was on there yesterday they asked me about it. That was like the main alt interest. You know, I chattered a little bit about bitcoin options on the ETFs, which is the news item. And then there was immediate pivot to the strategic reserve reserve. A friend, a mutual friend of ours called me and was like, hey, great hit, but you weren't even bullish enough on the strategic reserve.
00:33:09.888 - 00:33:17.980, Speaker A: And I was like, I literally said, every fiat currency in the history of the world has collapsed on tv. And that wasn't bullish enough.
00:33:20.200 - 00:33:38.834, Speaker B: I'm extremely bullish. And I think that the bull run is, you know, here, you know, and we're about to get through 100k and then 200, 300, wherever it goes. I don't know, but it's like, think about it. Like we got a bonfire going on in the middle of the forest. We got a little campfire going on. And it's a good campfire. Everything's great.
00:33:38.834 - 00:34:04.706, Speaker B: The strategic bitcoin reserve would be as if a forestry helicopter came over and dumped kerosene on the entire forest. Okay, that is what it is. And the bitcoin price goes to a million overnight. That's just what happens. And a million is just the starting point for nation states. If you're new here and you're just now getting into bitcoin, a million is where the story begins. We are going to go from a million to 20, 30, 40 million.
00:34:04.706 - 00:34:17.666, Speaker B: Like Saylor has 13 million. He's been trotting that number out on CNBC. He's being demure when he says that number. That is a small number. That is him being extremely conservative. We're going to $100 million coin.
00:34:17.778 - 00:34:25.416, Speaker A: Wow. Wow. You heard it here. That's not. That doesn't work. That requires the dollar to be significantly. But it will anyway.
00:34:25.416 - 00:34:31.480, Speaker A: We know it will. We know for sure. It's not 100 million 20. $20 you're talking about, is it?
00:34:31.600 - 00:34:49.176, Speaker B: I think these. No. Well, I did my math a while ago in, in 2015, I did my math on. On bitcoin and so I had it going to $50 million in 2015. I've always been exceedingly bullish on this. So. Yeah.
00:34:49.176 - 00:34:50.978, Speaker B: What would that be in, you know, inflated?
00:34:51.074 - 00:34:59.506, Speaker A: I don't know. You don't have to do the math. I'm just saying the dollar is gonna go down. I think for it to. Maybe not dead, but for it to get that high. That would be my.
00:34:59.658 - 00:35:39.274, Speaker B: One of my thesis here is that we're going to continue to see liquidity crisis that, that, the COVID crunch, you know, the, the V shape recovery. That, that was not an isolated incident. It's not rare. You can tie it directly back to the interventionism we did at the gfc and you can tie the things that happened at the GFC to interventionism that took place during Greenspan's tenure. So I think we're going forward in time and we're going to have increasing liquidity crises. And there's this exponential curve there where the liquidity crises are quicker by, you know, order of magnitude or a doubling, probably quicker by a doubling. And then the amount of monetary stimulus needed to soothe them is, is also doubled.
00:35:39.274 - 00:35:46.372, Speaker B: Right. So you have this exponential in two directions where the time between stimulus is getting lower and the amount of stimulus is getting higher.
00:35:46.476 - 00:36:04.148, Speaker A: Yep. That's interesting. Yeah, it is one of those tools that gets less effective every time you use it. Always have to use more. There is nothing that stops that train, is there? I mean, maybe, maybe the strategic reserve just, it doesn't stop the train. It just gives us more wealth to. In order to maybe fix it one day.
00:36:04.148 - 00:36:04.960, Speaker A: Is that.
00:36:05.580 - 00:36:30.608, Speaker B: Well, it also, that's one of the problems with it too, is it creates wealth inequality. And I think that's part, you know, there's this felt sense that things are deeply unfair. That's been with us ever since the great financial crisis. And you know, that's where we see like these calls for socialism come from. You can basically tie Bitcoin to Occupy Wall Street. I don't know if you were an Occupy guy, but I was an Occupy guy when I was in college. And I was just like, there's something wrong here.
00:36:30.608 - 00:36:55.200, Speaker B: Fuck the 1%, fuck the big banks, whatever. But I'm, I'm a right libertarian. That's my, you know, sort of political, moral compass. And so I think that we were in alignment with the left and the left libertarians at that time. And then there was a fracturing where we split off and went entirely separate directions. And they were seeking to control the institutions in the state and we were seeking to build a new. A new economy.
00:36:55.200 - 00:36:55.600, Speaker B: Right.
00:36:55.640 - 00:36:55.952, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:56.016 - 00:37:26.376, Speaker B: And that became Bitcoin. And so I think there's probably like a collision point where we meet up with the socialist and, you know, swiftly defeat the pew like that. And, and then we continue on with, you know, the digital economy that we've created, which by the way is the most multinational, multicultural, multiracial, multi religious coalition on the face of the earth. I've never seen anything like it. You know, when you're in bitcoin you have friends of all stripes. The news media wants to tell you it's a bunch of, you know, bro, white guys who look like me and Alex, which is true. We're here too.
00:37:26.376 - 00:37:36.208, Speaker B: But hey, bro, lives matter. But, you know, you have friends from all walks of life and everybody in America is able and capable of benefiting from this. And the sooner you figure it out, the better.
00:37:36.344 - 00:38:11.356, Speaker A: Yeah, it is a truly global movement when you travel especially. I mean, I was in Asia, in Singapore and Hong Kong. Just absolutely, tons, tons of bitcoiners there and insane. And everybody. I mean, it absolutely cuts across global and cultural lines. Hoddle for our audience. You know, I, I think I didn't even really introduce you, but I will, as I think you may know if you're listening now, you know, 25 minutes into the interview, that Hodl is one of the most well known bitcoin bulls, I'm going to say, certainly very well known among bitcoiners.
00:38:11.356 - 00:38:22.684, Speaker A: Gave a great talk at bitcoin Nashville you should check out. But maybe Hodl, you know, tell us, like, how you got. Give us. It's the annoying question. How did you get interested in bitcoin? Give us your OG story here.
00:38:22.852 - 00:38:47.468, Speaker B: So, yeah, I'll take it all the way back and I'll say, you know, there were. There were these touchdowns in my life, right? So like when I was nine years old, I was listening to my grandfather, who was a World War II veteran, tell me about gray market currency trading in Casablanca. Boom. There's a touch point. I move forward in time. I'm at the great financial crisis with my father sitting at the kitchen table when I'm back home from college. And, you know, basically I'm bemoaning the death of capitalism and how the boomers had it easy.
00:38:47.468 - 00:39:06.228, Speaker B: And it's going to be hard for me, right? And then boom, I flash, I fast forward and you know, Occupy Wall street and all that stuff happens. And I go, I'm fucked. We're all fucked. The millennial generation is cursed. We're never gonna get out from under this. This rock that we find ourselves in. And then I walk out of a casino in 2000, Christmas 2014.
00:39:06.228 - 00:39:23.600, Speaker B: So about 10 years ago, I had won $5,000. And, you know, I go, hey, what about bitcoin? I remembered bitcoin from when me and a buddy had tried to buy drugs on the Silk Road. But then, you know, we chickened out because sending illegal drugs to yourself through the mail was a felony. And I was like, no, I'm not doing I'm not doing felonies for drugs, man.
00:39:24.220 - 00:39:24.988, Speaker A: So.
00:39:25.164 - 00:39:51.132, Speaker B: So then I walked out of the money, walked out with casino money. And, you know, I bought bitcoin the next day, read the white paper, went down the rabbit hole, read everything online, became a bitcoin crazy person. It took over my entire brain, which will happen to almost everybody on Earth. And, you know, then I started relentlessly stacking. I sold my car, I drove a moped, I brown bagged my lunch. Everyone, everywhere I went, everybody made fun of me. I became the crazy bitcoin guy.
00:39:51.132 - 00:40:11.798, Speaker B: And 10 years later, I feel like that quote of Conor McGregor where he's like, you know, I've lost my mind on this game, right? Like, I've just totally lost my mind. I'm like Vincent van Gogh. I like, I'm ready to cut off my ear any second now. So I'm a bitcoin crazy person. And because I am that way, my portfolio has been doing very well over the last. Over the last 10 years.
00:40:11.934 - 00:40:27.942, Speaker A: Yeah, it's been undeniably a great trade. And, you know, what do you think? What are you going to do with your bitcoin? Bitcoin, you know, like, I mean, anything. Like, we've talked about this. Like, I get asked this question sometimes, and to be honest, I don't have a great answer, which I think is kind of my answer. What? What's your answer?
00:40:28.086 - 00:40:48.300, Speaker B: Yeah, so I'll just be straight up here. And I think one of the best uses for your bitcoin is dynastic wealth. Like, I'm extremely pro dynastic. Well, that's not something you're supposed to say. Warren Buffett wants you to sign a fake giving pledge and then give all the money to your children via charity endowments anyway, but whatever, that's not what I'm about. I am about dynastic wealth. And I think space exploration is another good area that we can spend it on.
00:40:48.300 - 00:41:19.682, Speaker B: I think, you know, tech, AI, capital allocation, future capital allocation there, you know, we, I, I believe in Peter Thiel's great stagnation thesis. I think we've been in a great stagnation. I think bitcoin is an unlock for that capital in order to use it to get over that. Like, I, I align with the E ACT guys, which is, you know, effective accelerationism. For anybody who doesn't know, there are a bunch of tech guys who are basically saying, like, it's, it's either curtains for the world for human beings, like, we're going to get killed by AI or nanobot swarms. Or we're going to make it out the other side. And we're betting we're going to make it out the other side.
00:41:19.682 - 00:41:37.058, Speaker B: So it's an optimistic view of the future. And I think bitcoin is the. Is the capital for the capital allocators of that future. And so that's the answer, is that you're going to have to risk your capital in order to do the things that push humanity forward. I think Elon Musk is a beacon in this regard, and we should all follow his lead.
00:41:37.194 - 00:41:58.310, Speaker A: Yeah, he. He's been super, super involved, and I can't believe the amount of involvement he had in the Trump campaign. And he said, right, like, he put it all on the line, dude. Like, if Trump had not won, like, they were going to go after. I bet he wouldn't be in charge of Tesla or Space X or the boring company within, like, a couple of years, like, they were going to go after him.
00:41:58.430 - 00:42:06.086, Speaker B: There's a parallel there with bitcoiners because we didn't want to be involved in this political election either, because, you know, I mean, we just. First of all, most bitcoiners are extremely.
00:42:06.118 - 00:42:07.254, Speaker A: Wary of the state.
00:42:07.422 - 00:42:35.554, Speaker B: The state has grown to a degree that it, you know, anarcho tyranny, basically, which means the state is powerless to help you, but not powerless to harm you. And so we've been living under that for the last however many years, eight years or something like that. And we didn't want to be involved either. But, like, I think we got involved for the same reason Elon got involved, which is this election was in our way. It was in our way to our goals. Our goal, bitcoinized future. And then we meet up with Elon in space, right? Elon's goal, get to space.
00:42:35.554 - 00:42:52.404, Speaker B: Right. Like, our goal, fix the money, fix the world. Elon's goal, get us off the planet. So, like, Elon's thinking about the interplanetary, you know, redundancy that humans need to survive. And we're thinking about beautifying life here on Earth for human beings in the Garden of Eden, which is planet Earth.
00:42:52.452 - 00:43:08.660, Speaker A: You know, it's a match made in heaven. He's gonna. He and Vivek are gonna lead the doge. The. I mean, I could not help the Department of Government Efficiency, not an actual department, by the way. You do, I think, need an act of Congress to create a government department. But I just.
00:43:08.660 - 00:43:36.940, Speaker A: I was thinking about his TW a couple years ago where he said that the most entertaining outcome is the most likely. And I'M just looking at this Doge and he's posting memes of, like, government seals that say, like, department of. With a shiba Inu. Like, that guy is, Is he the most legendary, like, innovator, I don't know, builder company builder in human history? I mean, is this like the. Are we. We don't get folks like him very often.
00:43:37.450 - 00:44:01.490, Speaker B: Listen, Elon. When Elon comes to your special thing, this happens a lot. Like, he came to Bitcoin and sort of mucked his way around and, like, didn't really know what he's talking about. And, like, it kind of pissed me off, and I think it pissed a lot of us off. But, you know, when, when Elon does the other things, the rockets and the whatever, it's very easy to love what he's doing for humanity. Because, listen, like, I don't, I don't care if you don't like his tweets. I couldn't give a shit less.
00:44:01.490 - 00:44:31.256, Speaker B: This man caught a rocket the size of a Saturn 5 with metal, little tiny metal chopsticks. Like, I, I want more humans who are like that, and I want our culture to celebrate that. And I want to allocate capital to the type of young guys who are going to be like that in the future. So if you are one of those guys and you're listening to me and you're like, I missed out on Bitcoin, first of all, you didn't. There's still time. But second of all, you want to start the next great American company like a Tesla or SpaceX, let me know. I will fund you.
00:44:31.388 - 00:44:45.536, Speaker A: I love that he, he, he was not afraid to fail. Right? There's that great. There's a great documentary about it on Netflix. I saw all. Just the crash rockets. I mean, they crashed so many rockets. NASA never wanted to crash a rocket, so they couldn't innovate like they, they were.
00:44:45.536 - 00:45:06.708, Speaker A: So, I mean, makes sense. Government agency, you know, if they show failure, they're going to cut the funding or whatever. But he, he just like, plowed forward. I mean, hundreds of failed rockets in order to get where he is now. And now. I mean, there's nobody else that can even compete at the moment, right? I mean, they sent the port, the Boeing one went up and the guys got. They're stuck up there right now because they use Boeing instead of SpaceX.
00:45:06.804 - 00:45:19.732, Speaker B: Yeah. I unapologetically love Elon. I love what he stands for. He's the Howard Hughes of our time, except without being crazy, so. Or at least not, not debilitatingly Crazy.
00:45:19.876 - 00:45:20.196, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:45:20.228 - 00:45:26.196, Speaker A: I mean, he seems functional. He seems functional, definitely. I don't know how he does it. He's playing Diablo. He's uploading videos.
00:45:26.228 - 00:45:28.388, Speaker B: I know, he's like the best Diablo player in the world or something.
00:45:28.444 - 00:45:29.540, Speaker A: He's like top 20 or something.
00:45:29.580 - 00:45:29.876, Speaker B: Truly.
00:45:29.908 - 00:45:31.960, Speaker A: He's the only American or something in the.
00:45:32.140 - 00:45:34.300, Speaker B: It's all Korean guys and him.
00:45:34.760 - 00:45:54.128, Speaker A: I mean, honestly, it's. It's a, it's a wild tale. I mean, you couldn't write a character like this. It's truly unbelievable. So when you think about where we're headed with bitcoin, is there, you know, there's that great post. There was that dystopian, you know that post, that dystopian post on Reddit. I'm here from the future and telling.
00:45:54.144 - 00:45:55.456, Speaker B: You to stop Time traveler.
00:45:55.488 - 00:46:02.426, Speaker A: Yeah, the bitcoin time traveler. Can you maybe summarize what that is? But also what is your. What does it look like to you? Sort of when we get there?
00:46:02.578 - 00:46:20.682, Speaker B: Yeah. So, I mean, I don't think bitcoin is a dystopia, nor do I think it's a utopia. When you're new in your bitcoin journey, it's seductive to think it could be a utopia. But utopias don't exist because humans don't like them. Every time we find a utopia, we destroy it because we can. That's what we do. That's who we are.
00:46:20.682 - 00:46:39.784, Speaker B: Right. It's like that's the story of the Garden of Eden. That's an ancient story and we're going to keep doing that through time immemorial. If you found yourself in heaven, you would be bored out of your mind because everything would be just simply too good. Right. So yeah, there are no utopias when it comes to humans. But what I, what I think is that bitcoin is going to the digital economy.
00:46:39.784 - 00:47:26.512, Speaker B: The bitcoin economy is going to take over the world as we're already seeing slowly. And when it does, I think we're going to be able to increase global gdp, you know, by, by a couple of percentage points, which is like, it doesn't sound like a lot, but over time is, you know, compounded annually the keg are on a couple of percentage points. Increased GDP gets us to space exploration and life extension technologies and you know, AI and nanobot and just a post scarcity world is where we're trying to go. That's where we're trying to head. We don't want to be humans trapped here on Earth having resource wars with each other. That's antiquated and seems stupid when we are like at the cusp, you know, of maybe becoming a Kardashev type one civilization. Right.
00:47:26.512 - 00:47:33.900, Speaker B: Like maybe that's a couple hundred years in the future. But bitcoin is a thousand year project. So I feel like I have carte blanche to talk crazy about space, you know.
00:47:35.320 - 00:47:45.408, Speaker A: Yeah, I think you do. I think it's fair. I love that the scarcest asset ever created is going to help us get to a post scarcity world. I think that's right. Fascinating idea.
00:47:45.584 - 00:47:54.938, Speaker B: Yeah. When you have scarcity and money, you, you don't have scarcity in other goods and services. It's kind of a crazy concept when you flip it around like that, you know.
00:47:55.074 - 00:48:19.352, Speaker A: Yeah, I think. Well, I mean. And you can save, right? I mean that's the other. Do you subscribe? I think obviously Safedine Amos is, is deserves credit and, and is the sort of popularizer of the idea that there are downstream effects from inflation that you may not think it's not just that goods get more expensive, it's that actually goods get crappier. Right. That they get. Houses get made with worse materials.
00:48:19.352 - 00:48:29.448, Speaker A: Right. Like the, you know, this idea, you get a 30 year mortgage. Most houses are made with crappy vinyl siding now that will be degraded by the time you pay off the mortgage. Right. Like that. We don't build with stone anymore. Right.
00:48:29.448 - 00:49:12.750, Speaker A: Like to me someone was like, you know, what would you sell your bitcoin for? And I was like, look, I don't know but if I did like if I sold bitcoin to buy a house, that house better be made out of brick or stone. Like I'm not buying, I'm not trading my hard money in for soft, soft, you know, you know, soft commodities. Right. Do you ascribe to that? And, and also do you think 100, do you think that it like takes the need away to invest? I mean I've heard people argue, I don't really agree with this but you know, because you can save and what is effectively deflationary money, right. That goods get cheaper relative to your savings rather than the other way around. You're not forced to go chase like a real interest rate bearing or beating, you know, investment. Like does it create a saver culture against investment culture or how does it alter the investment landscape like that?
00:49:12.790 - 00:49:14.846, Speaker B: Well, you don't have to be as far out on the risk curve.
00:49:14.878 - 00:49:15.070, Speaker A: Right.
00:49:15.110 - 00:50:06.902, Speaker B: So like, you know the Bible, the Bible's recommendation for your wealth is keep a third of your money in gold. Keep a third of your money in your business and keep a third of your money in your land, right? So like that's actually a pretty simple methodology for the average person. I think, I think it's kind of criminal that you go to like med school for eight years or 12 years or whatever to become, you know, like a cardiothoracic surgeon. And then like in your off time, instead of, of focusing on cardiothoracic surgery, which is what we as a society want you to be doing so that you're a kick ass surgeon who can, you know, heal ourselves and the people we love. That you're forced into becoming like a low level investment banker, which is like, that makes no sense to me and I don't think it makes sense to anybody else. So you should have a deflationary currency where you can store the fruits of your labor and your time and your capital. And you shouldn't have that inflated away from you in what is effectively a stealth tax without representation.
00:50:06.902 - 00:51:13.398, Speaker B: I mean, it is literally the thing that we, that we started a revolution in this country for why we threw tea in the harbor is because we were getting taxed without representation. Inflation is taxation without representation, right? So it's abysmal, it's abominable, we hate it, it's antithetical to the American spirit and it's destroying our society, not just here, but globally. It's worse for everyone else everywhere else on earth, right? And so I think that we shouldn't ask, you know, regular people to go out and become investors because being an investor is actually a very difficult job that takes a lot of due diligence and it's a full time profession, right? And if you want to do that in order to earn more capital, that's fine. But it shouldn't be the default in order for you to live a good life. And so, yeah, inflation affects your mind. Inflation, you know, the dollar or Bitcoin, These are measuring 20 tools, right, that you can use by which to figure out correct economic calculation in the, in the market economy. And imagine if you were building a home and every night as you were trying to build the home, somebody, some goblin, like a little crazy goblin came through and just like, like replaced all the tape measures and all the rulers.
00:51:13.398 - 00:51:37.752, Speaker B: That is effectively what inflation does. And you would, you know, you would assume that a home built with, you know, constant different measurements, it would be pretty wonky and lopsided and uneven. And that's the American economy, that's what we, that's the global economy. And it doesn't have to be that way. And I think correct economic calculation is the thing that's going to get us to increase the GDP and then go to the stars. Like that's the flywheel here.
00:51:37.856 - 00:51:44.536, Speaker A: What are you most excited about over the next six months even? Like, is it sbr? Is that what's. What's got you most excited now about?
00:51:44.608 - 00:52:09.414, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, the SBR is huge. That is huge. If that happens, I'm tracking that like a hawk. And then I think the bull run in general is here. Bitcoin is going to go to 2, 3, 400k next year even without the SBR possibly higher. I think that we had a bad cycle last time around. Right.
00:52:09.414 - 00:52:39.134, Speaker B: The cycle was just kind of meh. There was a lot more activity happening in shitcoins actually than there was in bitcoin. And bitcoiners made money. I mean, it was still pretty good. I think it was like 20x from bottom or something like that. So like, hey, like, you know, we're, we're complaining about, but we've also, if you've been around bitcoin for a long time, you've seen it do 100x, you've seen it do 200x and I think that we're kind of overdue for a cycle like that, which sounds crazy when you're sitting at $94,000. But Bitcoin is going to go to numbers that just simply don't make sense.
00:52:39.134 - 00:53:15.036, Speaker B: The other thing I am excited about is I am excited about mstr. I think MSTR is going to be incredibly performant, possibly even more performant than bitcoin over the next 12 months. Months, which is something I expect. And I think the appropriate place for that is in retirement accounts. So like if you're a bitcoiner, I would buy spot bitcoin raw bitcoin first, take it into self custody, cold storage, and with your retirement money, I would buy some MSTR or some IBIT or some fbtc. There are other instruments available to you, but to me I think what Saylor is building is incredibly impressive. And he's actually, you know, people talk about the premium.
00:53:15.036 - 00:53:47.888, Speaker B: There's a lot of talk about like, you know, because it's trading at 3x the Bitcoin holdings. Right. But I think the premium is valid because of the amount of financial engineering that Saylor is doing that he's finding products that, you know, like the institutional bond market actually wants. And that's a rare thing. And the, you know, the bond traders right now are pricing like a 620mstr price with the most recent converts. And, you know, it's currently sitting at whatever, 450 or something. I don't know where we're at right now while we're recording it, but I mean, do the math, right? So, like, yeah, those are, those are the things I'm excited about.
00:53:47.888 - 00:54:03.520, Speaker B: And then, you know, in general, just excited to continue to spend time with family and friends because at the end of the day, money is bullshit. And like, I, you know, me and Alex like to get drunk when we go to conferences. Maybe I shouldn't say that this is Alex's job, but we do like to get drunk. It's fun. So I'll see Alex at the next thing.
00:54:04.620 - 00:54:09.604, Speaker A: I don't know what I'm gonna see you next, but I know that for sure you'll be at Bitcoin 2025.
00:54:09.772 - 00:54:10.420, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:54:10.500 - 00:54:24.452, Speaker A: I don't. I can't wait to see you there. And Hodl, thank you so much for coming on Galaxy Brains. American Huddle Follow. I think you're American Huddle 8 now on on X dot com. You've gone through several iterations of the handle, but you got to shed your.
