00:00:00.160 - 00:00:04.126, Speaker A: What is that? First of all, when I say real world assets on chain, what am I even talking about?
00:00:04.230 - 00:00:19.262, Speaker B: Yeah, so essentially we're just bringing, or issuers are just bringing traditionally off chain assets like treasury bonds, private credit related debt, and issuing tokens around them on the blockchain. So you're bringing those opportunities.
00:00:19.318 - 00:00:24.074, Speaker A: So is this tokenization? Has tokenization finally found a product market fit here?
00:00:25.254 - 00:00:33.862, Speaker B: I don't know if we could necessarily say that because it is just kind of demanded from people who are natively on chain.
00:00:34.038 - 00:00:40.222, Speaker A: Haven't there always been, I mean, like stablecoins, is that a real world asset in your mind? You know, they're dollars, are they not?
00:00:40.358 - 00:00:43.518, Speaker B: Yeah, technically, like stable coins are real world assets.
00:00:43.606 - 00:00:48.686, Speaker A: Would you like, if you produce a chart of like real world asset growth, would you include stable coins or. No.
00:00:48.790 - 00:00:58.054, Speaker B: So actually that's a great question because in the report that we're putting together now, I excluded them, right. Kind of from the whole deal just because the force is kind of working against them.
