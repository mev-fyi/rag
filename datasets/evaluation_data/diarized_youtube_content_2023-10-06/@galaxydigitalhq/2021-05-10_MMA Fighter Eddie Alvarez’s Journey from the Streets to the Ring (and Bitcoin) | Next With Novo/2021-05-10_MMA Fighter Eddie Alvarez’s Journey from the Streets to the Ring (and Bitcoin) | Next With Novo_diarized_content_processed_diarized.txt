00:00:01.560 - 00:00:26.314, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. I'm Mike Novogratz, and this is next with Novo. Good afternoon, everybody. This is Mike Novogratz, next with Novo. And I've got Eddie Alvarez. He is a UFC champion, a bellator champion, a one fighting league champion, a champion in spirit and heart. Eddie, welcome aboard.
00:00:26.414 - 00:00:48.454, Speaker B: Thanks for having me, Mike. I, um, I watch you quite often on CNBC and squawk box and see. See your interview. So for me, like, I fought, I fight, of course, but I'm deep into finances, real estate, stocks, and I feel like I'm. I'm doing a podcast with Michael Jordan right now, so.
00:00:49.474 - 00:00:58.160, Speaker A: Well, well, thank you. Never been called Michael Jordan before, so it's a great compliment. Talk about where were you born? How'd you grow up?
00:00:58.272 - 00:01:35.090, Speaker B: I grew up in Kensington, which is like, sort of, it's an elephant graveyard of Pa or even of Philadelphia. I grew up humble beginnings. My neighborhood was kind of ridden with drugs, but my parents were able to kind of put me into a catholic school. And I think that's what court sort of set me apart from not being. Becoming a product of my. Of my environment and being able to kind of see something outside of where I live and strive. Strive for something more.
00:01:35.090 - 00:01:58.630, Speaker B: And thank you, by the way, because I read recently that you were the one who begun beat the streets. And in Philadelphia, that is, it's like monumental. Beat the streets. Like, it's a. It's a huge deal, and it's how a lot of kids like me growing up kind of were able to kind of. You guys funded a lot of things for us to be able to move in a way that we wouldn't be able to otherwise.
00:01:58.822 - 00:02:31.166, Speaker A: Yeah. You know, actually, one of the. One of the proudest things, you know, we started beating the streets in New York, and then these guys, Brett Moder and his brother Clint Mater, who were both awesome wrestlers, Ed McBride, they came and they said, we're going to do this in Philadelphia. And so they get the credit there. They built a great program in Philly. I'd go to their benefit and cheer them on. And, you know, we all shared the name and shared the ethos of how do you help kids get out of, you know, get a purpose and, you know, beat the streets? Literally learn the discipline from wrestling, learn leadership from wrestling.
00:02:31.166 - 00:02:36.702, Speaker A: And so I'm thrilled that, you know, the program, those guys crushed it and they continue to crush it.
00:02:36.718 - 00:03:14.994, Speaker B: And so, yeah, that was sort of like how I begun. Bill Hunter was my first wrestling coach, and he started kind of the pal program, police athletically. Yep, I played basketball, but I was five foot nothing. And when I got to high school, he goes, our basketball team sucks, and you're five foot nothing, so you're going to wrestle. So, so I said, okay, I'll wrestle. And that, that put me on the path and put me in a very competitive wrestling room, a very competitive environment. Everybody I wrestled with, it was my first year, my freshman year, but everybody I wrestled with wrestled for pal, their whole life.
00:03:14.994 - 00:03:31.554, Speaker B: So I pretty much got my ass kicked my whole first year. And, you know, it's like the environment grows, the organism type thing. I just turned, I turned into a different animal. Just being around the guys every day and diving into that culture of wrestling.
00:03:31.634 - 00:03:37.888, Speaker A: You know, talk about wrestling at national preps, because, because that's, you know, you go to Lehigh. That's, that's a big deal.
00:03:38.056 - 00:04:22.084, Speaker B: Yeah. So that, that was kind of the Mecca. We didn't, we didn't go to Pa states, and Pa states is normally some of the toughest tournament, one of the toughest tournaments in the whole country. And so our little school, North Catholic, from, from Kensington in the inner city of Philadelphia, we found our way to the national preps, and we're going up against powerhouses like Blair Academy, some of the best schools in the whole country. And we fought like hell, man. We were the guys who, like, we came in the tournament and they're like, we weren't technical, but we were tough as hell. And you probably wouldn't want to be on a mat with us because we hated losing.
00:04:22.084 - 00:04:51.368, Speaker B: So we're like, we were city kids who didn't have the same resources as the suburban kids or the schooling or teaching, but we were tough as hell, and we were competitive, and we didn't want to lose. So we did. We did. We did. Well, I took, I took six as a freshman year, starting wrestling. I took six that nationals my junior year, and then I took 6th again because my bracket was, like, crazy deep my senior year.
00:04:51.456 - 00:04:58.344, Speaker A: What was the transition? Did you, you go right from high school? Did you go to college? Did you pivot right to fighting?
00:04:58.644 - 00:05:23.220, Speaker B: So I didn't, nobody in my school ever went to college. Nobody in my family ever went to college. So that college wasn't like something that was pushed real big for my parents. And my parents moved away to Florida when I was 18. Like, as soon as I got out of high school, my parents pretty much moved. I split the bills with my brother and my sister, and we lived in Kensington. We just split the bills up.
00:05:23.220 - 00:05:41.406, Speaker B: And I, I was doing concrete work. I started doing concrete work every day, construction. And at that point, I met my wife. Already. I met my wife when I was 15. We had our first kid when I was 20 years old. I was doing a concrete job.
00:05:41.406 - 00:06:24.478, Speaker B: And right a little bit before that, around 19, I decided I wanted to try my first fight. And for me, it was like I had no options. It was either you're going to live a life, and this is how you're going to supply your family, you're going to do concrete work, you're going to come home and you're going to repeat this cycle for the rest of your life, or you're going to take a shot at something. So I need it to make fighting work. I need it to win. Don't get me wrong, I was scared to death, Mike. I remember around 18 years old, I wrote letters to my, my wife today, writing her letter saying, I'm so confused, I'm scared.
00:06:24.478 - 00:06:58.310, Speaker B: I don't know what to do. Like, I was so nervous about being average or being just the guy who did concrete work, that fear moved me in a way that, like, that I would never have the energy today to, when I look back to perform the same days that I was doing back then, I'm like, I don't know how I found the energy, but emotionally, I think I was so afraid that I never stopped moving. I was. I was, I was waking up and I was concrete work. To training. To training again. To concrete work.
00:06:58.310 - 00:07:00.870, Speaker B: And I lived like that for four or five years.
00:07:01.022 - 00:07:01.754, Speaker A: Wow.
00:07:02.254 - 00:07:07.158, Speaker B: And until I was able to put concrete work down and just focus on training, so.
00:07:07.246 - 00:07:10.074, Speaker A: And what did you get? Good. What did you get good at? Fighting.
00:07:11.294 - 00:07:26.042, Speaker B: So I was. I fist fought. I got a lot of fights on the street. I was an 18 year old kid who, I paid my own bills. No one could tell me what to do. I would go out. My brother gave me his id so I'd be able to get in bars.
00:07:26.042 - 00:07:51.744, Speaker B: And I got in trouble just like anybody in Philadelphia would. Went out as an 18 year old and I would get my fair share of fights. And before I decided I need to try this profession, sort of make some money. I did enough free ones, so I'm sort of trying to make some money off it. And I had my first fight at 19. I knocked the guy out and I went on it. I went on a crazy streak.
00:07:51.744 - 00:07:54.736, Speaker B: I knocked out, like, my first nine guys in a row.
00:07:54.880 - 00:07:55.604, Speaker A: Wow.
00:07:56.744 - 00:08:11.196, Speaker B: The city of Philadelphia showed up to every show and I was starting to make rough, like a rock, like a rocky story. Almost. Almost, exactly. And where I grew up is where Rocky was filmed. Kensington.
00:08:11.380 - 00:08:12.184, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:08:12.844 - 00:08:36.350, Speaker B: And so the money started to pile in. Promoters started to see I was bringing bigger crowds, long, larger crowds. So promoters wanted me on their card, and by the time I was, like, 22, 23, I was making like, 20 or $30,000 a fight. So I remember I was able to. I was able to put concrete aside and just focus on fighting.
00:08:36.502 - 00:08:42.234, Speaker A: Nice. And you in UFC, what league did you start in Bellator?
00:08:43.014 - 00:09:08.070, Speaker B: Yeah, I first. I think my first big league was a bo dog, and that was owned by a billionaire named Calvin Ayer. We flew out to Costa Rica. He overpaid everyone, so we were living like kings. A lot of up and coming fighters were living like kings. And it was because of Calvin starting that Bo dog, I became champion of Bo dog. I flew over to Japan.
00:09:08.070 - 00:09:13.398, Speaker B: I became. I beat all their best guys, and that's when Bellator signed.
00:09:13.486 - 00:09:21.198, Speaker A: So then you came back, you flew, you fought in Singapore, but that was at the end of your career. When did you come into the UFC?
00:09:21.366 - 00:10:00.006, Speaker B: Bellator first, then UFC, yeah, I became the champion of Bellator. I went through, like, a rough patch, a lawsuit with Bellator. They didn't want me to leave, but I wanted to leave, and I wanted to win the UFC world title, so I had to sit for a little bit, but then UFC ended up signing me, and I got to go to the UFC back in, like, I want to say, like, 2015, 2014 ish. And quickly, I rose up and I became the champion in the UFC. I felt like I manifested that. Like, I. I thought about it enough, and I.
00:10:00.006 - 00:10:15.558, Speaker B: And I dwelled on it enough and obsessed about it enough, and then at 30 years old, boom, they're putting this belt around my waist. I'm like, no way. It was like. It was a little bit freaky. Yeah. To see it. Yeah, that's the.
00:10:15.558 - 00:10:47.376, Speaker B: That's the UFC one, and these are the Bellator ones. But I sincerely, I sincerely felt like, I never felt like I was the best fighter, per se in the world or technically or anything like that. I just knew that I wasn't. Absolutely wasn't going to quit until that happened, and I still didn't quit, but I knew that that was going to be something I got, and nothing was going to stop me from doing it. So I was able to get the UFC world title.
00:10:47.520 - 00:10:49.524, Speaker A: Who was the toughest guy you ever fought?
00:10:50.584 - 00:10:51.016, Speaker B: Who? You.
00:10:51.040 - 00:10:52.684, Speaker A: What, you didn't want to fight him again?
00:10:54.264 - 00:11:10.464, Speaker B: Well, the toughest guy ever fought. I did fight again. I fought it. I believe I had real hard fought matches with a guy named Mike Chandler from Missouri. He. He came through the NCAA's. You may know of him.
00:11:10.464 - 00:11:14.192, Speaker B: He wrestled with Ben Askren and Tyrone Woodley and these guys.
00:11:14.248 - 00:11:14.884, Speaker A: Yep.
00:11:15.264 - 00:11:46.594, Speaker B: But he ended up becoming Bellator world champion. He beat me for my world title, and then I fought him again. I beat him back for it. And me and him, our fights were like blood and guts. We fought, shared 50 minutes in the cage together. It was like neither one of us wanted to lose a minute of that fight. So we were like mirror images of each other with the same kind of spirit, heart, will, body frame.
00:11:46.594 - 00:12:02.078, Speaker B: It was like fighting myself. So. Yeah. What it, is it enjoyable? No. But when it's over, you're like, wow, I'm really proud I got through that. Do I want to do it again? Probably not. Yeah.
00:12:02.078 - 00:12:03.114, Speaker B: You know.
00:12:04.494 - 00:12:22.754, Speaker A: Yeah, it was funny. I once asked. I once asked Floyd Mayweather what sport he wanted his kid to play, and he looked at me like I was crazy. And he said, real estate? He said, I don't want my kid to get beaten up. You know, punched. Like, I got punched.
00:12:23.894 - 00:12:53.938, Speaker B: And you know what? I'm the same exact way and people would be surprised at my answer. But when you. When you're in combat sports at the highest level, like, like. But either boxing or mma, you've seen some. You've seen more terrible stories than good stories, and you don't share them because you don't want to talk about it because it could be your reality. Right. That very well, that bad story could be your reality at any point.
00:12:53.938 - 00:13:02.620, Speaker B: So it's something we shove under the rug and we keep our faith and our hope and our belief that we're just going to continue to excel.
00:13:02.802 - 00:13:14.364, Speaker A: Talk about the Madison Square garden. I only saw you fight once, to be honest. It was Madison Square Garden. It didn't end well for you. It did not end well for you, but it was an exciting night.
00:13:14.784 - 00:13:59.512, Speaker B: No, not my night, man. You know that. I've done so many great things before that night, and it was like, it kind of sucks because that's the way the sport is. Like, you can't lose greatly until you win greatly, right? So it's like they both go hand in hand. Like, I can't take a terrible loss on a high level unless I've done some pretty great things to get there. So that Madison Square garden was a great experience. Like, the fight week, the build up, it arguably was one of my largest paydays, and I finally able to make a couple million dollars for one fight.
00:13:59.512 - 00:14:27.524, Speaker B: So that there's a lot of good things that happened. But the fight itself, I would have liked to do over. And I try to make sense of, like, why I couldn't compete at my highest level there. And all I came up with was like, hey, man, you. You fucking fist fight for a living, it's volatile. It's, you never know what's going to happen if you do it enough. Some nights you'll have bad nights, and some nights will be yours.
00:14:27.604 - 00:14:40.224, Speaker A: Are there any fighters that you just love? Like, you love them as people, you love them as competitors. You love watching them. Like, a couple of your, of the last 15 year era of the UFC. Who are your heroes outside of you?
00:14:41.724 - 00:15:21.926, Speaker B: George St. Pierre, of course, has always been, like, a staple of this sport. And someone that people would want to emulate, he's, he's the consummate, like, martial artist. Humble, hardworking, strives for excellence, and always, like, innovating, always not afraid to go out on a limb to try to innovate and do something new. And he's been a guy who's done that, who's transcendent to sport and has done that over and over. So, like, I always looked up to George growing up and wanted to emulate him. I studied his film over and over, so he's definitely one of them.
00:15:21.926 - 00:16:01.872, Speaker B: As far as excitement, like, a guy I have to tune into is Justin Gaethje. I fought. I fought him. They call him the highlight. Me and him were in fight of the year in 2018, and he's a guy, like, I wish that I could approach a fight with the same attitude that he approaches it, because he literally doesn't care about his own well being. And it's. It's very difficult to get to that point mentally, to just say effort and go forward, and he does that, and it's to watch out on tv.
00:16:01.872 - 00:16:12.944, Speaker B: It's like everybody watching wishes that they could be like that, and this guy is truly like that. And it's. It's fun to watch. He's one of my funnest fighters to watch.
00:16:14.164 - 00:16:35.860, Speaker A: I may, you know, because of wrestling, I, you know, and I was associated with helping with the Olympic team. Henry Cejudo and Cormier are my guys. I love both of those guys. I think Cejudo is one of the most underrated guys. I mean, he's just such an athlete. You know, when you're in the really lightweights, you don't get as much credit. But I hope he comes back, wins one more title, and then, yeah, he's.
00:16:35.892 - 00:16:46.750, Speaker B: Already lying for a title shot. And, you know, when you're a competitor, you know, you even. You're still finding a way to compete, right? You're competing with money, but you're.
00:16:46.822 - 00:17:17.943, Speaker A: Well, no, I. Every time I wrestle or fight these days, I break something. I broke this finger, I broke my rib, I broke my tooth, but I still wrestle. Not well, but I still wrestle. Who helped you figure out how to manage your money? Did you do it on your own or did you have a manager or was a mentor? Because I find a lot of athletes and a lot of artists, you know, they're surrounded by people they grew up with, and they don't have, necessarily easy access to great financial advice.
00:17:18.063 - 00:17:53.704, Speaker B: Yeah. So, Mike, I started reading real estate books when I was, like, 20 years old. I was fascinated by real estate, by finances. So, like, I probably read over 100, 200 financial books and real estate books that I wanted to get to a point where I'm now, where I had the money to apply all the things I was learning about. I'm in the position now where I get large lump sums of money from fighting, and I'm able to do all the things I learned. So as far as real estate, that was self taught? Pretty much. And with stocks.
00:17:53.704 - 00:18:28.000, Speaker B: I was training in Boca Raton for a number of years, and there was an older fellow in there named Andy Sankin who trained inside of our gym. Andy worked for a fund. He helped raise money for it, and he worked for a pretty large fund. And he left the fund and started trading his own money. And he used to tell the fighters, if you guys ever want to learn how to invest or whatever, you're more than welcome to come. Because he was a fan of the sport. Well, I went there every morning with coffee.
00:18:28.032 - 00:18:28.604, Speaker A: Wow.
00:18:29.384 - 00:18:53.400, Speaker B: And I sat. I sat in that seat, and some mornings they would say nothing to me. They would trade and do what they were doing, and I sat. And then on slow days, they would turn around and say, this is what we're doing. This is why we're doing it. They would give me their thesis on what they're buying and when they're selling it, and I just listened and listened. I still talk to them to this day.
00:18:53.400 - 00:19:22.022, Speaker B: He's a mentor of mine and helped me kind of move into the stock world. And from stocks, I like to have a line, a lot of lines in the water. So a small portion of my portfolio, I went and got into bitcoin. What about bitcoin? What is. So I went and bought one at $9,800 on. After I kept hearing been about it, everyone told me I'm stupid because I was buying at the high. I got ridiculed.
00:19:22.022 - 00:19:40.038, Speaker B: It made a bunch of bitcoin headlines. And I said, guys, I treat it just the way I treat stocks. I got buy them. I sit on it and the idea is to accumulate and let time do its. Do its job. I don't think they understood. I think they thought I was just trying to buy it to make a quick buck.
00:19:40.038 - 00:19:45.194, Speaker B: But what, you know, I think bitcoin and should I buy more?
00:19:45.574 - 00:20:30.586, Speaker A: Yeah, I think. I think with crypto, which is really, really interesting, is every once in a while in markets, and it doesn't happen often, you have something called a paradigm shift where the whole world resets. And even when you bought it, 9800, bitcoin was becoming a thing, but it wasn't a thing. It wasn't a thing for JP Morgan or Morgan Stanley or UBS or the big institutions, but it was close. And in the last five months, it's become an asset class. And so now they're all coming into it. And so there's an adoption cycle going on with more and more people entering the ecosystem.
00:20:30.586 - 00:21:03.366, Speaker A: To me, it feels like it's going to keep propelling prices up. And so I think it's one of the few investments I'd say, you know what? Buy a little more. Don't look at it too often. It's going to go higher. It's going to go higher next year and higher the year after that. It's an accumulating investment where I don't normally say that about things. Listen, if you get an amazing company that continues to grow and can continue to grow its market, we talk about Tam, total addressable market.
00:21:03.366 - 00:21:46.692, Speaker A: How many people can I sell shoes to? How big is the market for your thing? Bitcoin is a gigantic market because it's everyone on the planet. And so other times, if, you know, there's a, like, I invested in psilocybin, right, magic mushrooms, to cure depression, and had this amazing run, and I was thinking about it yesterday, there's nothing really in the next year that's going to give it more momentum. And so it probably just chops around sideways for a year. And so if you want, you could take your money off the table and wait for later. You know, it's, it's. I think it'll have another run in a year or so. But bitcoin is different.
00:21:46.692 - 00:21:57.664, Speaker A: I think it's just going to keep grinding. It's going to go up, come down a little, go up, go down a little bit. It's going to end up the year much higher, and then the following year, much higher. And so when it gets to 500,000, we can talk.
00:21:58.284 - 00:22:13.824, Speaker B: Yeah, I got. I got excited. When I. Like, every day I see another fund gets involved, and that's what. That's when you get the real movement. Like, yeah, the everyday investor like myself or whatever buys one, got people buy them here. But when the funds that.
00:22:13.824 - 00:22:33.024, Speaker B: The amount of money that's, you know, when you hear another fund, another fund, other large, I'm like, wow, man, this is becoming like a. Like you said, a staple where people are gonna ask their fund, hey, do you own bitcoin? And if they say no, they're gonna be like, why don't you own any? So it's like, that's exactly right.
00:22:33.484 - 00:22:49.184, Speaker A: You went from being a weirdo to buy it to a weirdo not to own it. And that's. That's a big shift. What do you want to do? Like, what's the big dream? You've accomplished a lot of them, right? You got one, almost every world title, but you're only 37.
00:22:49.604 - 00:23:07.088, Speaker B: I want to be you, Mike. I'm looking at my dream right now. I want to say I want to. I want to continue to invest. I want to do real estate at a higher level. I just. I just bought my first commercial, like, bar restaurant, like a commercial property last year, and that's doing.
00:23:07.088 - 00:23:29.746, Speaker B: That's doing really well for me. So I'd love to get deeper into commercial real estate, and I honestly love to be a full time investor. And it. I'm excited about it. I approach investing the same way I do fighting. I'm competitive about it. I like to win, and it's fun.
00:23:29.746 - 00:23:32.254, Speaker B: The more I learn about it, the more excited I get.
00:23:35.074 - 00:23:38.614, Speaker A: Your first restaurant. That's got to be fun. Tell me about that.
00:23:39.194 - 00:23:59.718, Speaker B: Yeah, so I'm more. I'm more on the lines of the real estate. So I bought the building, but I had some. I have some really good operators who were friends of mine. We've done real estate deals in the past, and they came to me after a fight and said, ed, we want to do one right here. It's a perfect location. It's right on second street pike, and it's called.
00:23:59.718 - 00:24:22.120, Speaker B: This is it right here. It's called the Maud house, and it's in Rockledge, pa. They serve number one Philly cheesesteak, which is a new twist on a Philly cheesesteak. It's shaved kielbasi with melted american cheese, and it got voted the number one philly cheesesteak.
