00:00:00.160 - 00:00:50.406, Speaker A: I think one of the interesting stats that you sort of alluded to is I think we had at least 20% of all transaction fees year to date since the having. I think probably even more than that, despite only having two or 3% of total blocks. So I do think that is something that anyone who's modeling mining economics is at least going to have to pay closer attention to. And if you're using hash price, or if you're using a combination of bitcoin price and hash rate to kind of get into minor revenue, I think you at least have to be aware of transaction fees. I think most people in the space, including myself, do expect transaction fees to decline and level off a little bit. But I still expect that to be around 20% of total revenue that miners are getting with a lot of spikes where it's far above that, which now is no longer this kind of negligible amount that doesn't need to be factored into our models.
00:00:50.510 - 00:01:01.194, Speaker B: So if Brian's now including this volatility, potentially elevated fees in his modeling of the business, are you or are investors starting to think about this as well.
00:01:01.234 - 00:01:23.782, Speaker C: As it relates to the transaction fees and are not something that the institutional investors think about because they don't understand it yet. They don't understand the business of bitcoin mining. And doing things like this and getting out in front of institutional investors is only going to help. But in the short term, we can only make money by aping into runes ourselves.
00:01:23.878 - 00:01:43.326, Speaker A: Can I say how kind of crazy that is to me that a public miner would be down because of the having, if that's not priced in, we've got another having four years from now that we should all be modeling, and another one four years after that. And we know it's going to happen. Insane to me if that's not just priced in from the beginning and actually would show how inefficient the market is, if that's the case, how much could.
00:01:43.350 - 00:01:47.274, Speaker C: You grow your hash rate with? $100 million.
00:01:48.314 - 00:02:48.160, Speaker A: So I think $100 million right now probably can buy you about five x a hash worth of asics. So if you're talking like 25 x a hash worth of growth, you've got 500 million just in Asics. But the interesting thing is that's just the machines. Then you actually need the sites and the power, and you need to build the infrastructure. And so I think that's going to start being, I think a pretty serious bottleneck to scaling is that now you are competing just for power capacity with now AI other big data center plays outside of bitcoin mining. But, yeah, I mean, I easily could still build, like, if I were to invest $100 million into our site where we have extremely low power costs, I would project very strong returns. I absolutely think that miners can still make strong investments, but I think that you have to make it not just for the sake of scaling, but really have a strong understanding of the underlying physical infrastructure that you're investing in.
00:02:48.160 - 00:03:19.254, Speaker A: And it has to be paired with low cost power, and then you'll be able to operate profitably, I think, for a long, sustained period of time. And I do think that you do see that. And probably one of the easier metrics, 2.2, is something like a marginal cost to mine metric, or then there's layers on that when you add SG and a, or depreciation into that kind of metric. But there's still many miners, I'm certain, producing bitcoin for under $30,000 a coin and at prices of 65,000 or so, wherever we are today, those are still very healthy margins to pay back that investment.
00:03:19.374 - 00:03:53.676, Speaker C: One of the big issues I have as an analyst is disclosure. All of the miners, they put out monthly metrics. They all have different metrics. You don't understand if their hashrate is actually in use or if it's just mining machines that are just sitting in a data center somewhere that are turned off. And disclosures is a real issue. And at the end of the day, this is a very simple business, right? Like, it's a commodity mining business. Like, you know what your input costs are, you know what bitcoin price is, you know what hash rate is, you know what difficulty level is.
00:03:53.676 - 00:04:02.710, Speaker C: So, like, it shouldn't be difficult to be able to model like we, as an analyst, I should be able to model what exactly each miner is going to earn every day.
00:04:02.782 - 00:05:07.764, Speaker A: I think that now there is a fairly large percentage of total cost that is just going into building electrical infrastructure, sourcing the sites. And I actually think that that does decrease risk if you're looking at valuation of miners, because I do think that you have this kind of pretty steady book value where there's demand for that site, even outside of mining. And so if I were an analyst, that, to me, would be like my absolute flaw on any miners, just like, you know, what is the value of all of that infrastructure that can be repurposed for something else. And then, yeah, the machines have not skyrocketed in the same way that they did in previous cycles. And I think a lot of miners learn from that. You mentioned high cost of power, and I do think that that is fundamentally problematic. If you're investing in infrastructure with high cost power and you're just doing it for the sake of scaling because that's what the market is offering for you, then I don't really have a non cynical take, but I think that if you have very reliable and sustainably inexpensive power, you are going to be able to generate, I think, very solid return on that investment, investing every single dollar just into infrastructure and mining rigs.
