00:00:08.960 - 00:01:08.372, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. I'm back to attack till my heavy bag burst? You could see me on the street with a cold hard beat or sitting at pub key holding cold card keys? Cause we hold our cheese? And we're here this week with a special guest, Trey the lions here to speak, we never rest. Don't forget these markets never close so I'll be covered the space till the sun no longer glows and my voice no longer flows. Whoever's hating sent him to me? I've got plans to make bitcoin great in 2023 for the future. Cause I'm different? Picture this dissident research misfit making mischief with some new financial instruments? We're still here in these crazy days? Crypto's dead is what the fallacy says, yo, the best is yet to come? So don't be mad when we say it's time for me to end this rap and start up galaxy brains, got galaxy brains? As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital. Happy New year. We're here in 2023 to kick this off with an awesome show.
00:01:08.372 - 00:01:42.264, Speaker A: We've got BIM net Abbey from Galaxy Digital trading to talk markets. As always, we're joined by Trey Aslanian, also from Galaxy Digital Trading, to talk about crypto in general. And I'm going to share some fascinating data about crypto VC in 2022. But before we begin, please refer to the link to the disclaimer on the podcast notes, and note that none of the information in this podcast has constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Galaxy Brains, 2023. Let's do it. We're ready to go.
00:01:42.264 - 00:02:37.354, Speaker A: All right, before we get into it with BiMnet and our guests, we released a report yesterday morning on the 2022 crypto VC scene, which showed, despite a big slowdown throughout the year, still the biggest year on record for crypto VC investment into crypto companies. Q four was small, though it was the smallest quarter since 2021 and two years since Q 420 21 at just over 2.4 billion allocated across like 370 or so deals. So obviously, the macro and monetary policy environment is affecting VC investment. It's actually down across the board, not just in crypto VC, but still robust activity. So check out that report. It's on galaxy.com
00:02:37.354 - 00:03:25.414, Speaker A: research. A couple other interesting highlights. The later stage the share of capital invested in later stage deals versus earlier stage deals is ticking up at over 40% in later stage, which is a little bit of a reversal from last quarter, where it was down around 20% of the capital. When I look at deal count too, this is one of the really interesting ones. I like to look at pre seed deals because they indicate the earliest stage of company. So a deal getting done at that stage typically means a new company. And the share of deals that were at the pre seed stage has been falling for years, which in general, in my mind, has been sort of an indication of the maturation of the market.
00:03:25.414 - 00:04:14.274, Speaker A: And also there were some different market dynamics in 1617 and 18 than there are today. Market infrastructure, for example, really outside of some exchanges in that earlier era. And so there was this huge opportunity for entrepreneurs to come in and build things like prime brokerage and custody and lending, etcetera. But for the first time that I've been tracking this since 2016, the share of deals that were done at later stages, so that's series c and later, there were more of those deals than pre seed deals for the first time in Q 420, 22. I'd like to see more. I'd like to see that pre seed deal count stabilize and show us that there are new entrepreneurs coming in to build new things. When we look at the deals and capital invested by subsector.
00:04:14.274 - 00:04:57.062, Speaker A: So, like web3 versus infrastructure or mining, trading, trading still accounts for the most money invested by VC's in Q four. But web3 and daos, metaverse, gaming, all that stuff, sort of nfts all in one sort of bucket. By far the biggest share of deals at over 30%. Deals done, so not capital invested, but deals done. So obviously some shifting narratives, still trading, investing, lending, exchanges are commanding the most capital, but clearly a lot of interest in emerging areas. Right, web3, nfts, daos, gaming, metaverse and stuff. So more to come, but the last couple ones I'll talk about too, is valuation.
00:04:57.062 - 00:05:32.110, Speaker A: Valuation is down. It's down a lot, right? So with less capital chasing fewer deals, I think the founder friendly environment that we saw in the last few quarters is sort of drying up a little. But fund sizes are up. So the funds themselves. So VC fundraising, not investing, really notable here. A very, very tepid fourth quarter, but annually the most ever raised at basically 30 billion raised by crypto VC's in 2022. So down a lot.
00:05:32.110 - 00:06:07.534, Speaker A: But the fund count is up. The total annualized amount out invested is up. And when we look at the median and average fund size, the average fund size now is over $100 million. And the medium is 100 million. It's a really crazy amount of money that's still allocated in this space in 22. So a lot of interesting stuff here. A tough environment we're entering into, I think in 23 for the VC ecosystem, both investors and entrepreneurs alike, given the allocation, is definitely slowed down from allocators into VC funds.
00:06:07.534 - 00:06:43.588, Speaker A: You can see that in Q four. Again, I think it was the lowest since Q 120, 21 allocated into venture funds. And then there's not that many deals, 370 deals. That's down significantly from the high in Q four. Still a lot of interest, obviously, and a lot of money pouring in, but definitely slowing. And so we'll look to just probably depressed valuations and founders unable to raise as much money selling as little of their company as they were in 2022. But some interesting narratives to watch, no doubt.
00:06:43.588 - 00:06:53.940, Speaker A: But that's it. Check out the reports on galaxy.com research. Let's go to our friend Bimnet of BB Galaxy Digital trading. Bimnett, great to see you in the new year.
00:06:54.052 - 00:06:55.852, Speaker B: Thanks for having me. Happy new year, Alex.
00:06:55.908 - 00:06:57.372, Speaker A: Yeah. How are your holidays?
00:06:57.548 - 00:07:04.318, Speaker B: They were great. Would have been better if crypto rallied a lot more, but I'll take whatever I can get.
00:07:04.366 - 00:07:06.542, Speaker A: At least it was relatively quiet, right?
00:07:06.598 - 00:07:12.750, Speaker B: You know, no middle of Christmas or New Year's calls or dumps, anything like that.
00:07:12.782 - 00:07:26.638, Speaker A: There was one, I remember what would have been like maybe 2019. There was a pretty big dump right around the holidays that all the desks were sending color. Like some poor, poor person. That was the one person keeping the lights on over the holiday.
00:07:26.766 - 00:07:39.598, Speaker B: Yeah. No, I mean, that's a story as old as time. You know, holiday season teams are understaffed. A lot of young folks on the desks leads to crazy moves in certain.
00:07:39.646 - 00:08:03.502, Speaker A: Instances, especially our markets, which are 24, 7365. All right, so let's get into it. I mean, we talked a lot about last year on the last podcast two weeks ago. So let's instead maybe look at today and a little bit going forward. It seems pretty quiet out there. I mean, crypto, I mean, bitcoin volatility. I didn't rerun the table today, but, like, we might be at like the lowest ever on a 30 day historical volatility basis.
00:08:03.502 - 00:08:05.674, Speaker A: It certainly feels that way, yeah.
00:08:06.134 - 00:08:31.390, Speaker B: Again, it just speaks to an absence of activity, both buying and selling. I think a lot of the forced selling from miners has already gone through, and there's not really sort of new institutions begging to pile into bitcoin right now. In fact, honestly, I think the institutional side has been piling into traditional gold more.
00:08:31.422 - 00:08:36.717, Speaker A: So gold has been rallying it has for a month and a half or so.
00:08:36.845 - 00:09:31.814, Speaker B: Yeah, it set its lows in like late October, early November, around the mid 16 hundreds, and it's now trading at like 1860 and change. It's kind of crazy. In a year where markets were down 20% and change bonds were down 15%, plus dollar went up 15% and change gold was actually flat in all of 2022 and it has started 2023 trading very well. I think there's a number of reasons why it's trading well, but I think, one, there's a general lack of positioning. Two, I think you've had some central banks on the bid as they're looking to move away from western based money. Also, just generally speaking, I think there's pretty strong seasonals over the next that have been happening. So those have been supporting gold.
00:09:31.814 - 00:10:25.362, Speaker B: Again, though, I think the same thesis should be applying for bitcoin. And I kind of think that eventually, once people get comfortable with counterparty risk and more comfortable with the idea of investing in crypto again, I do think that you'll start to see the digital gold narrative start to take hold again, particularly if this year kind of plays out like I think it will, which is very aggressive. Well, it really depends. But if you get a hard landing scenario, that's going to incite a very easy response from the fed, a very aggressive response in terms of cutting rates and printing more money. And that should be good for things like, you know, crypto and bitcoin. If you do get to that hard landing and, you know, you have to switch.
00:10:25.458 - 00:10:26.094, Speaker A: Right.
00:10:26.554 - 00:10:29.290, Speaker B: But again, it's still tough.
00:10:29.362 - 00:10:34.586, Speaker A: Yeah. So gold, what about other commodities? I mean, last year was a pretty big year for commodities in general.
00:10:34.650 - 00:10:51.178, Speaker B: Absolutely. Again, it was kind of like a roller coaster. Like last year, oil started kind of around here, like seventies, like eighties, then went up to like 100, 2130, and then now just came back down to like the low seventies. And so it's been a roller coaster.
00:10:51.266 - 00:10:51.894, Speaker A: Right.
00:10:52.434 - 00:11:36.200, Speaker B: And I do think that fundamentally we are setting up for renewed strength in the commodity complex. One of those key reasons being the Chinese reopening. That's 1.31.4 billion people that have been saving money for three years. They're starting to travel again. I think once they get through this period of mass infections and get closer to meaningful levels of herd immunity, that's going to be a lot of activity that's going to go back into the economy that should be supportive of the commodity complex. In addition, generally speaking, the economy is ok, the US is doing fine.
00:11:36.200 - 00:12:29.872, Speaker B: The employment market is fine, it's healthy. I think that's also constructive for the commodity complex. The last component is really the dollar, every commodity based on the price of dollars. And I just kind of like, I'm a little bearish to dollar here in the context of if you think about what the risks are in the market and it's inflation shooting much, much higher and the ECB, the BOJ and other, and those two central banks in particular have a lot more to go in terms of raising interest rate policy and tightening financial conditions. So if we go a lot higher in terms of inflation, those currencies I think will do better. And then on the flip side, if we get the hard landing and stuff again, just because of how far ahead the US is, they're going to be cutting more aggressively earlier. No.
00:12:29.872 - 00:12:53.088, Speaker B: Or just they're cutting from a much higher level. It feels a little asymmetric on the dollar strength side of things. And so if you get a weaker dollar chinese economy that's recovering and sort of continued strength in the US economy, I think that could bode well for the commodity complex.
00:12:53.176 - 00:13:04.752, Speaker A: Interesting. And then I'm looking at equities. It looks pretty tepid out there. I saw big tech is down a bit. Yeah. Struggling. It obviously has been, frankly for a little while, though.
00:13:04.752 - 00:13:11.856, Speaker A: We had a little bit of a rally in the end of the year. Does it look anything? Does the picture look different?
00:13:12.000 - 00:13:56.534, Speaker B: No, I think the picture is really easy. Our CEO has been pretty bang on about how he's thinking about the market. And I think it's pretty consistent with other folks, which is basically you're assuming $220 per share in earnings in the s and P this year. That's without forecast really moving down. And if you apply an s and P multiple of 17, that gets you to where the s and P is right now. We don't really think that multiples are going to expand a lot because interest rates are really high and the Fed's hawkish. So it's not like earnings or multiples are really going to expand and there's a potential that they can go lower.
00:13:56.534 - 00:14:44.736, Speaker B: But that leaves you in a scenario where there isn't that much upside risk to stocks and the downside risk is there. But I'm not in the, you know, panic doom saying camp doom saying camp, etcetera. But you're just kind of stuck in this place where you're not really expecting much in terms of returns. So really like what's the point of taking that risk, right? I'd rather just go into fixed income or better risk adjusted products, and not take the risk of being long a growth company or being long tech hyper valued and things of that nature. So I think equities just don't provide good risk reward here, and that you're just supposed to wait for extensions in one direction or the other if you're.
00:14:44.760 - 00:15:25.496, Speaker A: Trying to trade it and then back to crypto. I totally understand the current risk appetite environment, and there's a lot of external factors, macro and monetary policy in particular. But at some point. Don't you look at these if we're talking about the majors, the bitcoins and eths, don't you look at these if you have a long term view at some point and say, like, this might be a good entry. I mean, no one in big capital seems to be thinking that way yet. But, but, and so I guess maybe the flip side of the question is, like, what, how much downside risk do you think there still is in, in crypto? It's hard to know, obviously. So this is more of a.
00:15:25.496 - 00:15:25.840, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:25.872 - 00:15:28.504, Speaker B: Am I allowed to talk about single name protocols?
00:15:28.584 - 00:15:30.352, Speaker A: Yeah, we can talk about bitcoin ETH, for sure.
00:15:30.448 - 00:15:31.120, Speaker B: Oh, got it.
00:15:31.152 - 00:15:31.496, Speaker A: Got it.
00:15:31.520 - 00:15:37.880, Speaker B: But not. Yeah. Well, let's just say that there's, there's still a lot of froth in this market, in my opinion.
00:15:37.952 - 00:15:38.704, Speaker A: There is.
00:15:38.864 - 00:15:40.968, Speaker B: There are definitely a lot of protocols.
00:15:41.056 - 00:15:50.368, Speaker A: That are very overvalued and have very limited usage. For sure. The sort of l one trades from 2021 and two still hanging over.
00:15:50.456 - 00:15:50.904, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:15:50.944 - 00:16:04.400, Speaker B: There's still tons of meme tokens that have a lot of value that I think is dubious. There's one that's going crazy on Solana right now. I saw this bonk, Bonk.
00:16:04.472 - 00:16:07.000, Speaker A: Now this is just a random meme token. I mean, we don't know anything about this.
00:16:07.072 - 00:16:10.784, Speaker B: Apparently there's utility. Get staking and borrow against it.
00:16:10.824 - 00:16:17.240, Speaker A: Staking is not utility. But right now, that froth is still there.
00:16:17.432 - 00:17:05.423, Speaker B: That froth is still there. So, taking a step back, my landscape of crypto is you've got long only types that believe in the big tokens, and you've got the venture guys that are just playing in the venture arena. Then you've got your sort of speculators, your professional speculators, and market makers, and then you've got retail. Retail. They're basically not coming back for a really long time. They've gotten hurt a lot. $900 million in Gemini earn Ust Luna collapse, FTX, Voyager Bridge hacks, Celsius Bridge hacks, nfts that have come down a lot in price meme tokens that have come down a lot in price.
00:17:05.423 - 00:17:51.962, Speaker B: It's not just in crypto, but in stock markets, they've also done poorly. So I think retail is on the mend. You've got a lot of market makers that were taken out on stretchers because of various collapses, various collapses, et cetera. And then speculators, they're a little bit limited right now because, one, they lost liquidity of a major exchange with perps, et cetera. The lending market is frozen a lot. So that leaves you with prov pro market, which is speculators versus speculators and trickles of long only and venture money coming in. But you also have to think about the supply that's coming into the market.
00:17:51.962 - 00:17:56.682, Speaker B: Obviously, there's the bitcoin supply, but there's still venture positions that are unlocking.
00:17:56.738 - 00:18:00.570, Speaker A: Yeah. Particularly on those all l one s, there's a lot of those.
00:18:00.642 - 00:18:30.642, Speaker B: And then there's stuff that has to get sold as a function of bankruptcies. So we know about supply and we know that the speculation in one direction or the other is not going to go that extreme. And then you have to put that in the context of what is the liquidity like in the market. And liquidity is not great, particularly versus three to six months ago, even though you might be deceived by the headline figures.
00:18:30.698 - 00:18:31.226, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay.
00:18:31.250 - 00:19:15.846, Speaker B: There's a couple yards of bitcoin that traded between 16 eight and 16 seven that's been trading there for a week or whatever. So point is, liquidity's then market participants have shrunk. The pie has definitely shrunk. There's still supply coming in, and there's still tokens that are, in theory, worth probably more than they should be. The other thing to think about is in terms of what is there to do in crypto right now. If it isn't to speculate, it's to yield farm. But the yield farm opportunities aren't really there, and they're probably not worth it on a risk adjusted basis right now.
00:19:15.846 - 00:19:17.990, Speaker B: In terms of smart contract risk bridging.
00:19:18.102 - 00:19:21.550, Speaker A: Especially with all the fixed income rates where they are as well.
00:19:21.662 - 00:19:39.194, Speaker B: Yeah. And you're not getting paid on your stables unless you're farming. And so it's a very tricky outlook for the market. But in terms of the players in the space and trying to understand the market construct, it's actually pretty clear right now.
00:19:40.774 - 00:19:54.914, Speaker A: Yeah, very, very interesting. So we're going to be waiting around then, I guess, while we're. And it seems like a lot of the markets are pretty not just crypto, but equities too. We're sort of range bound. Is your outlook for the near term?
00:19:55.464 - 00:20:21.072, Speaker B: I think range bound is fine, but the way I would think about it is, I think more than any other time in markets, I think you just have to be respectful of new information being data dependent. Essentially, the Fed claims they are. But if you see unemployment start to tick up massively, yeah, we might be going into a harder landing scenario, but I don't think that's the case.
00:20:21.168 - 00:20:22.752, Speaker A: Right. But you gotta be focusing on that.
00:20:22.768 - 00:20:53.114, Speaker B: Data, on the data, economic data and little signs here and there. I mean, there's a central bank that hasn't even gotten off negative rates yet and their bond market has just started to move. And you could cause, I mean, there's some pretty scary tail scenarios about Asia, Asia, FX and fixed income if the bank of Japan really starts going. And so you just have to be kind of nimble and data dependent. And that's kind of what I would recommend to folks for, for this year.
00:20:53.574 - 00:21:14.214, Speaker A: Bibnet Abibi from Galaxy Digital trading. My friend, thank you so much. Quick break for our listeners. Yeah, I don't have a poll this week or anything, so maybe just, you know, take a deep breath, stretch, stretch your legs. Thank you. To our listeners. Sorry we were not here last week, but we got a lot of positive feedback saying that folks were missing the show.
00:21:14.214 - 00:21:36.202, Speaker A: Don't worry, we're here again every week for 2023. Send your feedback. As always, hit me up on social or message us at glxyresearch on Twitter or send us an email@researchalaxy.com, dot. Always love and appreciate your feedback and thanks for listening. Let's get back to the show. Welcome, my friend, Trey Aslanian, tre of the house of the lion, as I like to say.
00:21:36.202 - 00:21:37.650, Speaker A: Welcome back to Galaxy Brains.
00:21:37.722 - 00:21:45.214, Speaker C: Thanks for having me, Alex. First one in camera. So I'm repping my sister's team Muhlenberg field hockey shout out to her.
00:21:46.114 - 00:22:04.386, Speaker A: Yeah, this is the first time we've recorded with you in our new studio and it's fun to have you back. You know, I just figured we'd shoot the breeze a little bit about some crypto topics. I don't know if you've been looking at anything in particular that's been interesting over the break, if you were scrolling while at home with your family.
00:22:04.530 - 00:22:15.490, Speaker C: I'm always scrolling. Always scrolling. Yeah. I mean, just a couple things we could talk about. Maybe like the whole shanghai upgrade that's due and then maybe a little noster talk.
00:22:15.562 - 00:22:27.168, Speaker A: Yeah. Oh, noster. Interesting. So Shanghai, I mean, we know it's scheduled, right? Scheduled? Well, it's, it's uh. The, the content of it appears mostly finalized. At least Christine says right. It's, it's withdrawals.
00:22:27.168 - 00:22:49.630, Speaker A: It's staked ETH withdrawals. I don't know what, what was your like there, there was a lot of a consternation in the dev community, but then also sort of in the broader Ethereum development community about this. I mean, everybody wants these scalability upgrades and proto dank sharding and all this. And everyone was upset. I guess not everyone. A lot of people were upset that only staked ETH withdrawals will go in. What are your thoughts on that?
00:22:49.742 - 00:23:09.494, Speaker C: I don't know. I think it's always an important push pull between the devs and the users. I remember the initial ETH two kept getting pushback, and then finally Justin Drake was like, okay, I've heard enough. You guys have yelled at me. We're calling it, we're doing it, and they got it done. So I think something similar happened here. I think this is the last user.
00:23:09.654 - 00:23:11.630, Speaker A: The last piece of the merge too.
00:23:11.742 - 00:23:13.830, Speaker C: Exactly. So I think people just want to put it behind them.
00:23:13.902 - 00:23:41.446, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, Ethereum developers were getting a lot of criticism, mostly from bitcoin maximalist, but they go from the bitcoin maximalists have gone from every critique of Ethereum and they just move on to the next one. At first it was like, the merge will never happen. And it was like, the merge won't work. Then it was like, okay, but your ethos locked up. And so it does feel like sort of like cobwebs and like dirty laundry. They got to like finish and clean up and get it all because also it dramatically affects like network dynamics and supply dynamics.
00:23:41.550 - 00:23:55.250, Speaker C: That's the other thing. I would argue it's a security thing. Right. Like if you think about all the ETH holders in the world, I think it's like ten to 14% are currently securing the network. Other proof of stake networks, that's like north of half, even like two thirds.
00:23:55.322 - 00:24:01.130, Speaker A: Right. And you think maybe more supply would come onto stake if they knew they could on stake when they need to?
00:24:01.242 - 00:24:21.126, Speaker C: Yeah, of course. It's like, you know, you'd have more assets in an ETF than like a closed end fund. It's just, it's, it's more certainty. Yeah. And so, yeah, that'll be really exciting. I think there's a lot of fud around. Like, oh, are people gonna unstake and sell? Because they're basically being held hostage right now, but I am pretty strongly convicted.
00:24:21.126 - 00:24:22.358, Speaker C: It's gonna go the other way.
00:24:22.526 - 00:24:32.222, Speaker A: Yeah, that's really interesting. I mean, you have to. I can think of a few. I've seen the chart of the average price of ETH when it was committed to the beacon chain by, like, supply.
00:24:32.318 - 00:24:33.310, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a lot of red.
00:24:33.422 - 00:24:40.174, Speaker A: Yeah, I forget, but it is. A lot of people are underwater. But a lot of people were then there early. I mean. I mean, the beacon chain launched a couple years ago.
00:24:40.294 - 00:24:40.954, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:24:41.254 - 00:24:45.702, Speaker A: But also, you have to think, like, these are some of the most hardcore Etherians, right. I mean.
00:24:45.838 - 00:24:46.246, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:24:46.310 - 00:24:56.742, Speaker A: So, like, I mean, the people staking on the beacon chain weren't like, you know, passers by, tourists. I didn't think so. I feel like they'd generally be less likely to sell than I think.
00:24:56.838 - 00:25:20.430, Speaker C: There's that dynamic of it. There's also kind of like the exchange staking and kind of the liquid staking derivatives, which is more like I would classify like retail. If you're not setting up your own validator, you probably use one of these services. So I understand the argument, at least on the exchange side, where that might just get arbed out to ETH. Liquid staking derivative is its own animal.
00:25:20.462 - 00:25:20.558, Speaker A: But.
00:25:20.566 - 00:25:25.998, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree. Majority of them, especially early, where just die hard, they're going to keep it there forever.
00:25:26.166 - 00:25:37.960, Speaker A: What do you think about the liquid staking derivatives in general? I've never really fully figured out whether I think this is, whether there's a risk. But you're basically restaking or reusing the staked ETH, right?
00:25:38.112 - 00:25:38.632, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:25:38.728 - 00:26:00.284, Speaker A: Does that impact security in some way? This was something that always concerned me, but I haven't. I admit to our viewers that I have not really figured out exactly what my fear is about this, but it seems the stuff's supposed to be inert and staked, but then is getting basically pledged as collateral elsewhere, perhaps?
00:26:00.834 - 00:26:03.642, Speaker C: Yeah, there's some kind of, like, cascading.
00:26:03.698 - 00:26:05.242, Speaker A: Death spiral or something could happen.
00:26:05.338 - 00:26:10.282, Speaker C: Yeah. No, I mean, they could act maliciously, right. I mean, that would, like, destroy the project, and people are generally.
00:26:10.298 - 00:26:13.402, Speaker A: You mean the derivative? The LSD projects themselves, like, the actual.
00:26:13.458 - 00:26:15.202, Speaker C: People who are physically staking the ETH.
00:26:15.258 - 00:26:21.122, Speaker A: Right. Like, if they rugged or something, then all the derivative tokens are worthless.
00:26:21.218 - 00:26:22.282, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly.
00:26:22.378 - 00:26:26.330, Speaker A: Which I was thinking more like if you have some kind of cascading, like.
00:26:26.482 - 00:26:28.658, Speaker C: If slashing event, like a. Yeah, I.
00:26:28.666 - 00:26:39.122, Speaker A: Guess it wouldn't really make sense. I was thinking more like if all these liquid staking derivatives, derivative tokens are pledged in defi, and then there's a mass liquidation. But that doesn't really impact the underlying stake.
00:26:39.258 - 00:27:15.240, Speaker C: Yeah, with redemptions, as long as no one's acting maliciously, I think you're fine. It's something that I think hasn't been fully flushed out. I know certain projects have looked into because it's usually a dual token model where you have the governance token and then you have the staking derivative. So it's like, how do those two kind of share governance rights kind of like the same with the maker holders versus the DAi holders versus the CDP. You have to reach that happy medium. At this point, I think it's just been like, go, go, go, get as much market share as I possibly can and then kind of figure it out later. And now we're getting to the size where we're at the figure it out later point.
00:27:15.240 - 00:27:16.960, Speaker C: People are starting to think hardly about that.
00:27:17.032 - 00:27:54.034, Speaker A: So what about another one we were talking with Bimnett about was just the Alt L1 trade. He says he thinks there's a fair amount of froth still in some of these Alt l one s that have minimal activity. Activity on chain is declined, but bitcoin and ETH still have activity. Probably binance chain, I'm assuming, still has activity, but we see stuff on polygon and Solanas is declining, but there's still some. But outside of, when you get to the broader ecosystem of layer one blockchains, it's starting to look to me like, what do we really need these for?
00:27:54.424 - 00:28:36.758, Speaker C: Yeah, I've said this before, I'll say it again if you're using an EVM. I'm completely uninterested in what you're doing, unless you're ethereum. Obviously this year I'm hyper focused on the L2 space, specifically on ethereum. I think obviously optimism and arbitrum are market leaders and optimistic roll ups. We're going to get the whole ZK complex and maybe Polygon has something to do with that. But what I'm looking at, I think, even in more detail, and this kind of comes to head with some of the interoperability protocols are going to be like these kind of application specific l two s where it's like Bitdao, they want to spin up their own perpetual swap l two. It's interesting, like ribbon they're making.
00:28:36.806 - 00:28:39.734, Speaker A: Are they all just going to fork optimism, you think, or something like that?
00:28:39.854 - 00:28:47.744, Speaker C: Probably they'll fork some kind of optimistic roll up, but I mean, if you want kind of a closed loop application, I think it's, it does most of the job.
00:28:47.864 - 00:29:22.232, Speaker A: I mean, I always liked this idea for l two s. I know there were some gaming companies that have tradable assets in game and whatnot that basically were doing this. Either it was a sidechain or an l two that just pegs back to ETH. They don't run there. I never really liked the thesis that game developers were going to build on an l one. It always seemed like you're going to look, you pay for the game, they create all the content. The game itself, typically, if it's a standard sort of video game, doesn't need to be decentralized and they need to be able to control the assets while they're in their box.
00:29:22.232 - 00:29:27.928, Speaker A: But like the whole. The hack is then just bridging you back out into the open ecosystem.
00:29:28.016 - 00:29:33.424, Speaker C: Yeah, that's like arbitram, Nova. It's like a layer three. We're going to get to like layer ten by the time we're old.
00:29:33.464 - 00:29:35.848, Speaker A: Yeah, but the layer three layer inflation.
00:29:35.976 - 00:29:39.760, Speaker C: Yeah, right. Yeah, scaling layers, that's like a bitcoin thing, though.
00:29:39.832 - 00:30:20.246, Speaker A: I know, I know. And then also, I mean, the ZK stuff, they, you know, Christine has talked a lot about how you can have a roll up on a roll up on a roll up. You really can do that. And so you could have really, truly, I don't know, incomprehensible levels of scaling theoretically. You mentioned Noster, so Noster is for our audience, who may not know, a decentralized social network, basically a decentralized messaging platform that has, I guess it can be built on many different ways, but I guess the most popular use is as a Twitter like feed. The bitcoiners are all over this. Jack Dorsey has been using it.
00:30:20.246 - 00:30:21.166, Speaker A: Have you been on there?
00:30:21.230 - 00:30:33.254, Speaker C: It's pretty slick. I haven't quite figured it out yet, but it's basically like, it's public private key cryptography. I can take my account anywhere I want, which is super powerful. That's something I've been able to do with ethereum that I haven't.
00:30:33.374 - 00:30:34.598, Speaker A: You'd like to see in social?
00:30:34.686 - 00:31:02.050, Speaker C: That I'd like to see in social. Obviously, I have lens on the Ethereum side, and Farcaster, which are more companies, I mean, for lack of a better word, companies than open protocols. I'm sure they have a whole roadmap to get there. But Nasr right now is decentralized, and that allows for some really cool stuff. It explodes. That's what gets me excited about this whole movement is anyone can work on this. And a lot of interesting people already have.
00:31:02.050 - 00:31:14.974, Speaker C: So I think by the end of the year we'll have a working telegram, no tap. Like we will have the whole suite. I think the battle becomes mobile, which has always been an issue.
00:31:15.014 - 00:31:15.870, Speaker A: It needs to be on mobile.
00:31:15.942 - 00:31:24.126, Speaker C: It needs to be on mobile. They might get some flack from the App Store. I know the main one. Damas or something.
00:31:24.190 - 00:31:24.830, Speaker A: Yeah, damas.
00:31:24.902 - 00:31:33.934, Speaker C: Damas. They had some. The App Store had some issues, some silly issues, I think so. We'll see.
00:31:34.014 - 00:31:35.262, Speaker A: Yeah, the App Stores have electronics.
00:31:35.278 - 00:31:36.686, Speaker C: We gotta make our own phones, man.
00:31:36.830 - 00:32:05.634, Speaker A: I know, I agree. I mean, so noster, it's like, and again, this is, I plead some ignorance here. So apologies if I get this wrong, but it's like a series of relays that just pass these signed messages around, right. So you have a private key. There's some fields, I think I looked, it was like only like eight fields in a Nostra message. Very small, compact and. Yeah, and you just sign a message and then applications can hook into the relays and display them.
00:32:05.634 - 00:32:39.628, Speaker A: And it's pretty straightforward. It reminds me in some ways of like IRC or, you know, where these nodes aren't, these relays, they're not incentivized. And I think that's a criticism that like the web3 community will probably have against something like Noster, because you always hear that argument that, well, you know, why would these nodes, you know, pass these messages around without being incentivized? That's often been the justification for the introduction of a blockchain, right. For. But we have long history of decentralized tools like this existing.
00:32:39.756 - 00:32:45.664, Speaker C: For sure. It's a user that uses it. Who's going to run a bitcoin node. Well, bitcoin, yeah.
00:32:46.324 - 00:33:09.630, Speaker A: I think it's pretty exciting. I have to say, too, Twitter has been not functioning very well. I don't know if you've noticed this. You send a tweet and it's didn't send check back later or something. The other day I was in my notifications and all of them were just gone. And then like 3 hours later all of them were back. And I'm like, is Elon actually breaking this thing? It seems like he might be, yeah.
00:33:09.702 - 00:33:18.326, Speaker C: I don't know. I've definitely heard people say that. I literally just refresh my home button. So I'm a very limited Twitter user.
00:33:18.390 - 00:33:19.646, Speaker A: Yeah. Have you ever tweeted?
00:33:19.790 - 00:33:20.262, Speaker C: No.
00:33:20.358 - 00:33:21.014, Speaker A: Never tweeted?
00:33:21.054 - 00:33:23.246, Speaker C: No. I like some Princeton wrestling.
00:33:23.390 - 00:33:24.606, Speaker A: You've liked some stuff.
00:33:24.670 - 00:33:26.114, Speaker C: Yeah, that's about it.
00:33:26.614 - 00:33:35.198, Speaker A: But you follow a lot of accounts. I've seen your secret account before. I see that you follow a lot of stuff. It's an intel gatherer operation for you.
00:33:35.246 - 00:33:36.022, Speaker C: Longtime lurker.
00:33:36.078 - 00:33:49.142, Speaker A: Yeah, I would love to see that. A decentralized thing. We know Jack wanted it. Right. You saw the text between Jack and Elon? Yeah. Really fascinating, by the way, those. I cannot believe that saga even happened.
00:33:49.198 - 00:33:49.766, Speaker C: Wild.
00:33:49.910 - 00:33:54.342, Speaker A: I mean, all these text messages were released in court. Yeah, it's bizarre.
00:33:54.398 - 00:33:55.494, Speaker C: I think that's why I finally bought it.
00:33:55.494 - 00:34:26.268, Speaker A: And there's a bunch of weird ones. Yeah, there's a bunch of weird ones. A lot of sycophants like, you know, cozying up to Elon, trying to curry his favor, and myriad people just offering him advice about what to do with Twitter. But I think the ones. We read these on a prior episode, but the ones between Jack and Elon were very interesting. Quite. What do you think about bitcoin? Like lightning? Have you been following lightning lately? Is there anything exciting, you in particular, in the bitcoin world?
00:34:26.356 - 00:34:33.024, Speaker C: Yeah, there's. I'm more excited about the bitcoin world than I have been in a while. Obviously, the noster thing, this kind of.
00:34:33.064 - 00:34:34.024, Speaker A: It's like bitcoin adjacent.
00:34:34.064 - 00:34:45.768, Speaker C: It was like. But it's always been my thesis. You don't need everything on chain. And this is the perfect use case for lightning. There's a lot of other cool shit. Like get Albi login with.
00:34:45.896 - 00:34:48.376, Speaker A: It's like a lightning metamask type wallet.
00:34:48.440 - 00:34:49.672, Speaker C: Exactly. I love that shit.
00:34:49.728 - 00:34:50.504, Speaker A: Yeah, it's really cool.
00:34:50.584 - 00:34:53.164, Speaker C: Then you have some perp exchanges, like Collider.
00:34:53.904 - 00:34:54.536, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:34:54.600 - 00:34:57.352, Speaker C: Where you can trade bitcoin denominated. And it's non custodial.
00:34:57.448 - 00:35:01.618, Speaker A: Very cool. Like Ellen markets, too. That's been around for a while.
00:35:01.706 - 00:35:06.210, Speaker C: That stuff's not totally interesting to me, but it's cool that people are thinking about that.
00:35:06.282 - 00:35:27.196, Speaker A: Yeah. There's one that we're going to dive into a lot more, which is miniscript, the bitcoin language. I don't know a lot about it. I recall Andrew Polstra, the chief scientist or researcher or head of research at Blockstream. I forget his exact title. He at a Boston bit devs that I went to. Maybe in 2019.
00:35:27.196 - 00:36:04.456, Speaker A: He gave a presentation on how he was working on it. Was very interesting. I'm told it's complete and merged into core already, and no one knows about that. So we're going to have a guest in a future episode to explain what this means. But what my understanding is they're significant feature additions, basically through the transaction language, which doesn't require any kind of fork. It's just a way to compile new information down into bitcoin transaction format that actually has some really powerful implications for things like vaulted transactions or time locks that make it really interesting. I just learned about this.
00:36:04.456 - 00:36:16.068, Speaker A: I actually recall that. Like I said, I learned about it a while ago. I totally forgot about it. As far as I can tell, very few people are working on it, but we're going to have one of the people working on it come and explain what it is. I think that could be very interesting.
00:36:16.176 - 00:36:17.516, Speaker C: Yeah, I need to do my homework on that.
00:36:17.580 - 00:36:18.124, Speaker B: Sounds cool.
00:36:18.204 - 00:36:20.100, Speaker A: I've got a doc, I'll send you with a bunch of links.
00:36:20.172 - 00:36:20.784, Speaker C: Nice.
00:36:21.604 - 00:36:27.664, Speaker A: I don't know anything else that you're particularly interested in. What's Defi look like these days in your mind?
00:36:29.004 - 00:37:16.812, Speaker C: The Defi stuff is still working on bringing some of the really good stuff about centralized exchanges on chain, and I think that's likely done kind of what I was saying earlier, application specific L2 format. I mean, all you need is a matching engine and a shared order book. So fundamentally, if there's no fiat involved with the trading, there's no reason why it shouldn't be on chain. So I think we'll continue to see that. The GMX of the world, it's kind of like, it reminds me of the AMM versus central limit order book where it's like just our brains are so wired to think, oh my God, central limit order book. Obviously as a trader on the desk, I need to trade in that. But user experience wise, amms are way better.
00:37:16.812 - 00:37:28.348, Speaker C: I think we're finding something similar with GMX where it's like they're on DyDX's tails, and DyDX has been around for a while. We've seen forks to that, and eventually it's who pays the winners.
00:37:28.516 - 00:37:29.108, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:37:29.196 - 00:37:36.594, Speaker C: GMX, you have this variety of assets with something like Gains network, you post die and you're trading against that fund.
00:37:36.674 - 00:37:37.714, Speaker A: Super interesting.
00:37:37.874 - 00:37:40.858, Speaker C: So I think that's probably gonna win out again, which is kinda wild.
00:37:40.946 - 00:37:48.014, Speaker A: It's so weird. What about you? See the Winklevoss letter that they sent to DCG?
00:37:48.794 - 00:37:49.322, Speaker C: I did.
00:37:49.378 - 00:37:50.374, Speaker A: Pretty spicy.
00:37:50.994 - 00:38:05.586, Speaker C: It was very spicy. They're definitely feeling the heat. What I'll say about that is obviously, you know, no inside baseball, but these things tend to take a really long time to iron out. I don't think this case is any different.
00:38:05.650 - 00:38:23.294, Speaker A: It looks pretty complicated. Yes. All right. One or two more topics are one of our favorites. Sam Bankman Freed. I was upset I wasn't in New York. Yesterday when he appeared in court, I saw the video of him squeezing his way past all of the throng of paparazzi.
00:38:23.294 - 00:38:36.482, Speaker A: He pled not guilty to all charges, but he also, his lawyer is motioned to keep the two unknown co signers of his $250 million.
00:38:36.498 - 00:38:37.482, Speaker C: They signed off on it.
00:38:37.578 - 00:38:38.498, Speaker A: Personal recognizance.
00:38:38.546 - 00:38:43.522, Speaker C: Meanwhile, all those people in Celsius blockfi had their addresses doxed, their names doxxed.
00:38:43.618 - 00:39:01.486, Speaker A: Well, and FTX creditors also are having their names and info kept private, at least for some amount of time. Trey's looking at the block clock. It's changing. No worries. But there's gonna there. I believe news organizations have already petitioned to have that lifted. But this isn't a bankruptcy.
00:39:01.486 - 00:39:15.742, Speaker A: It's different. The US government didn't oppose the motion to keep the two cosigners secret. So as far as I understand, there's basically a very low likelihood we'll ever find out who they are. Very weird, though, because when Sam writes.
00:39:15.758 - 00:39:18.294, Speaker C: His tell all, you want to know from the can.
00:39:18.374 - 00:39:23.976, Speaker A: Yeah. Don't you want to know? I want to know. Right. I mean, there's. I'm not going to speculate about who it could be.
00:39:24.120 - 00:39:24.600, Speaker C: Okay.
00:39:24.672 - 00:39:29.824, Speaker A: But, like, there's a bunch of categories of people it could be, and all of them are interesting.
00:39:29.904 - 00:39:30.256, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:39:30.320 - 00:39:54.258, Speaker A: And I want to know. You know, it could be former FTX, other FTX employees that are wealthy and didn't commit any crimes. I think that's probably unlikely. But it could be friends of his parents, right, who are big political fundraisers and professors. It could be who? I mean, who knows, right? I want to know, though. This is the largest such personal recognizance bond, I believe, ever.
00:39:54.386 - 00:39:55.922, Speaker C: Really? And yet we.
00:39:55.978 - 00:39:59.050, Speaker A: And yet, as far as we know, like, a $4 million house was posted.
00:39:59.122 - 00:39:59.774, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:40:00.714 - 00:40:08.290, Speaker A: I don't know. Like, this was really irking me. You think Sam's gonna. What's he doing? They got his Internet. He tweeted.
00:40:08.402 - 00:40:09.354, Speaker C: Yeah. Now he's.
00:40:09.434 - 00:40:11.130, Speaker A: Is he chilling? Is he playing video games?
00:40:11.242 - 00:40:18.786, Speaker C: I think he'll probably be restrained from going on any more Twitter spaces, but he's definitely playing a lot of video games. Yeah. Was that when he played League of Legends or something?
00:40:18.810 - 00:40:23.450, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Apparently he's not that good at it, which is funny. Cause people said he played it all the time.
00:40:23.522 - 00:40:24.874, Speaker C: In hindsight, man. In hindsight.
00:40:24.914 - 00:40:28.314, Speaker A: I know, right? People were like, he must be a League of Legends. Legend.
00:40:28.394 - 00:40:28.818, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:40:28.906 - 00:40:31.658, Speaker A: He's like, I don't know what the tiers are. I don't play League of Legends, but.
00:40:31.666 - 00:40:33.402, Speaker C: At least he's the bronze, which is apparently bad.
00:40:33.458 - 00:40:44.774, Speaker A: Yeah, it sounds bad. Sounds bad. Anything else on the exchange space that you're following? I mean, what about the proof of reserves we've all seen? Does that excite you?
00:40:45.994 - 00:40:47.002, Speaker C: It's helpful.
00:40:47.138 - 00:40:47.738, Speaker A: It's helpful.
00:40:47.786 - 00:40:59.178, Speaker C: I think if there is kind of regulation at 23, which I'm somewhat skeptical of, just given what's going on in Congress right now, I think they're a little preoccupied.
00:40:59.226 - 00:41:00.106, Speaker A: Even pick a speaker.
00:41:00.170 - 00:41:03.738, Speaker C: Yeah. The longest one, by the way, has gone three months for a speaker.
00:41:03.826 - 00:41:07.414, Speaker A: I read that it was, like, in the 18 hundreds. They said it had over 100 rounds of.
00:41:08.794 - 00:41:23.954, Speaker C: So they got their own stuff going on. But I think on the exchange side is probably where we'll see some kind of mandatory separation between assets. Where it's weird in the crypto space now where you just send it and take it off.
00:41:24.034 - 00:41:26.834, Speaker A: It's so weird. It's easy.
00:41:26.954 - 00:41:27.610, Speaker C: Super easy.
00:41:27.682 - 00:41:37.418, Speaker A: But it requires a lot of trust. Yeah, I think that'd be good. I think proof of reserves and or omnibus versus segregated accounts and Bitmex is.
00:41:37.426 - 00:41:40.524, Speaker C: Kind of the gold standard for all that stuff. Yeah.
00:41:41.184 - 00:41:41.936, Speaker A: Just a bitmake.
00:41:41.960 - 00:41:42.152, Speaker C: This is.
00:41:42.168 - 00:42:18.058, Speaker A: Again, I hate to always have to say this, but Arthur and the charges and whatnot and stuff with Bitmex and public notwithstanding, Bitmex has been an exceptional steward of the bitcoin blockchain. They have, I think, among the best proofs of reserve that they've created. They did little things like they used to send all their transactions, what, like 08:00 a.m. In a batch transaction. So they use, like, the littlest amount of block space. There were other exchanges, I won't name who only added transaction batching very recently and used to send a separate bitcoin transaction for every withdrawal. So they've done a whole bunch of stuff like that.
00:42:18.058 - 00:42:22.374, Speaker A: That has always been bitmen research. Johnny beer there. I mean, we've got his book, actually right here.
00:42:22.994 - 00:42:23.930, Speaker C: Read it in an afternoon.
00:42:23.962 - 00:42:24.554, Speaker A: It's a great book.
00:42:24.594 - 00:42:25.098, Speaker C: Page Turner.
00:42:25.146 - 00:42:36.550, Speaker A: Yeah, page turner. Great bitcoiners over there at BitMex. Still. We could go into BitMex, too, because you've been trading these markets for years. I mean, Bitmax has been a roller coaster.
00:42:36.662 - 00:42:40.142, Speaker C: Yeah. That was the mecca back in the day, remember?
00:42:40.238 - 00:42:45.118, Speaker A: Was it? March 12, 2020? Bitcoin's, like, spiraling from, like, six to, like, 3200 or something.
00:42:45.206 - 00:42:45.926, Speaker C: Server issues.
00:42:46.030 - 00:42:46.222, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:42:46.238 - 00:42:46.366, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:42:46.390 - 00:42:50.514, Speaker A: They said they got, like, ddos attacked. Yeah, something like that. Think they pulled the plug?
00:42:50.974 - 00:42:53.326, Speaker C: I mean, if they did, I would say thank you.
00:42:53.430 - 00:42:57.198, Speaker A: Exactly. There was like a cascading series of liquidations.
00:42:57.286 - 00:42:59.460, Speaker C: Yeah, there's, there's $20 million on the bid.
00:42:59.542 - 00:42:59.968, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:00.056 - 00:43:12.640, Speaker C: Till zero. And the network was so backed up, just given all that was happening, you could not send bitcoin into Arb, that back. You send bitcoin in, you buy it there and you sell it elsewhere. Couldn't do it.
00:43:12.672 - 00:43:19.840, Speaker A: Couldn't do it. Lots more we could talk about, Trey, but I really appreciate you joining us here on galaxy brains today. Thank you so much, man.
