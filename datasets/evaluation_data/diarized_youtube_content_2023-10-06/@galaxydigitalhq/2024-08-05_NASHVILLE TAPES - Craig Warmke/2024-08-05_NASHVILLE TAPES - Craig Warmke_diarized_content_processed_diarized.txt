00:00:00.800 - 00:00:11.134, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, an infinite amount of cash. Cash. I'm your host, Alex Thornton. The us banking system is sound and resilient. Bitcoin made a new all time high.
00:00:11.302 - 00:00:19.646, Speaker B: If you're not long. If you're not long, you're short. Satoshi's gonna come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet. All bitcoin's gonna be erased.
00:00:19.838 - 00:00:22.330, Speaker A: Bitcoin. Bitcoin's the best crypto else.
00:00:22.990 - 00:00:25.010, Speaker B: Bitcoin is going to zero.
00:00:25.600 - 00:00:51.980, Speaker A: Welcome back to Galaxy Brains. I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmware research at Galaxy. This is our next edition of the Nashville Tapes. We're talking with Craig Warmke, philosophy professor, co author of the great book Resistance Money fellow at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, about the philosophical case for bitcoin. And I think it's a great book, and you'll enjoy this interview. So let's get right into it.

00:00:51.980 - 00:00:59.578, Speaker A: Welcome to our guest, Craig Warmke, philosophy professor, bitcoiner, co author of Resistance Money. Craig, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:59.634 - 00:01:01.634, Speaker B: Thanks, Alex. I'm a longtime listener.
00:01:01.682 - 00:01:02.546, Speaker A: That's very nice.
00:01:02.698 - 00:01:05.882, Speaker B: Until this past week, which has been busy, I haven't missed a single episode.
00:01:05.946 - 00:01:06.330, Speaker A: Wow.
00:01:06.410 - 00:01:07.978, Speaker B: Yes. So I have one question for you.
00:01:08.034 - 00:01:08.418, Speaker A: Okay.
00:01:08.474 - 00:01:09.514, Speaker B: Where's Bimnet?
00:01:09.682 - 00:01:24.822, Speaker A: Bimnet is tied to the trading desk in New York right now. I don't know if you have been seeing. We're recording this on Thursday, July 25. A little bit of a distress situation happening in markets. The Nasdaq was down 3.8% yesterday.
00:01:24.926 - 00:01:28.134, Speaker B: Wow. I would have loved to have heard what he thought about that.
00:01:28.182 - 00:01:37.574, Speaker A: I know. Well, actually, we talked to him yesterday. You got to listen to this week's episode, because David Bailey was the guest, and Bimnett did talk about that a little bit.
00:01:37.622 - 00:01:37.998, Speaker B: All right.
00:01:38.054 - 00:02:06.750, Speaker A: We're just a little concerned, I think, about the. I don't know, there's like one big tech stock that I won't name that's basically driving the entire us stock market. And it's kind of faltering at the moment. So people are getting concerned, but that's not what we're here to talk about. That's right. Thank you for listening. You and Andrew Bailey and Bradley Ruttler published this great book called resistance money that is sort of a philosophical take on bitcoin, really a philosophical inquiry into bitcoin.
00:02:06.750 - 00:02:08.130, Speaker A: What does that mean?
00:02:08.430 - 00:02:57.418, Speaker B: Well, first of all, we want to make a case for bitcoin to a new audience. This is not, as people who haven't already been orange peeled, an audience that includes academics. And so we felt we needed to publish the book through an academic press, but also people who haven't been orange peeled, who also don't subscribe to many of the ideologies that bitcoiners currently are more likely to uphold. And so we published this book, the philosophical case for Bitcoin. And we think that a case for bitcoin overall needs to be philosophical, because in order to evaluate bitcoin overall, you can't just do it within computer science. You can't just do it within economics. You really want to weigh the harms and benefits that bitcoin brings to the world.
00:02:57.418 - 00:04:28.340, Speaker B: And in order to do that, you need philosophical tools. And so what we do is we say, imagine you take a pill, not an orange pill, but a pill that erases all your memories, and you don't know who you are in the world. And behind this veil of ignorance, as we call it, you have a decision to make. And the decision is whether or not you would go back into a world with bitcoin, this world, basically, or go into a world without bitcoin, where it's been erased out of existence. Nothing like it will ever be. And in order to make this decision wisely and responsibly, you have to look at a whole swath of evidence from factors about bitcoin censorship, resistance to its level of privacy, to the way that it might or might not include people who are financially excluded, but also looking at its negative externalities, its potential pollution in the environment and so on. And so we do this with the reader, not necessarily for the reader, but we go through all this evidence, and we decide by the end of the book that, look, if you didn't know who you were, you'd want bitcoin to exist because you might be someone who needs bitcoin because you are unbanked in India, or you might need bitcoin because you're a whistleblower or a journalist or an activist in Russia who's been financially excluded or censored.
00:04:28.340 - 00:04:58.012, Speaker B: You might be someone who needs privacy for similar reasons. So we weigh all this evidence, and we look through a number of potential objections to bitcoin. We say, look, this is a risky decision. You'd probably want bitcoin to exist. And so we don't argue that anyone in particular should buy bitcoin. And we don't presuppose that anyone needs to subscribe to austrian economics or libertarianism. It's just a very simple pared down case for bitcoin to its essence.
00:04:58.012 - 00:04:59.836, Speaker B: And we think it has to be philosophical.
00:04:59.948 - 00:05:20.904, Speaker A: It's such an interesting way of looking at it. I mean, there's been dozens of, like, introduction to bitcoin. Why you should, you know, whether it's the bitcoin standard or bitcoin money or the history of money, they most usually focus on the history of money. Right. They all start there. There was an aisle called yap, right. And they had rhistones that they.
00:05:20.904 - 00:05:40.116, Speaker A: And that was the oldest form, known form of money, supposedly. Right. And they always progressed from there and talk about coinage and all this stuff. But the philosophical case is quite interesting. It's a whole different way of approaching someone to think about it for the first time. I've never actually even thought to raise it in this way. Yes.
00:05:40.116 - 00:05:44.268, Speaker A: What kind of reception are you getting? And are people getting orange pilled from this book?
00:05:44.364 - 00:06:33.500, Speaker B: Yes. Molly Jane Zuckerman, who has a tendency to be more skeptical at blockworks, I believe she wrote a review and said not only did we convince her, but she thought that if you're going to make a case for bitcoin, this is the best way to make it. It's the philosophical case. It's one that weighs bitcoin overall with its harms and its benefits. Now, we've also encountered an interesting disparity between the critics and the non critics or proponents, if you will. So the proponents have actually read the book, and no one who's ever read the book has had a, a negative evaluation of the book. The only people who've negatively evaluated the book are the people who haven't read it.
00:06:33.500 - 00:06:36.404, Speaker B: So we're pretty happy. We're pretty happy about that. Yeah.
00:06:36.452 - 00:06:40.340, Speaker A: And you guys work with the Bitcoin policy Institute, is that right? What is that?
00:06:40.420 - 00:07:00.364, Speaker B: Yes. So the Bitcoin Policy Institute, BPI, it's a great organization. We are educating lawmakers and the general public, not just about money and the future of money, but specifically bitcoin. And David Grant and. Sorry, David Zell. Yep. David Zell and Grant McCarty are the co founders.
00:07:00.364 - 00:07:13.764, Speaker B: They've done an awesome job. We've had two bitcoin policy summits in DC. They've been highly successful. Senators and lawmakers have come out. And you've spoken at the recent one. You did a really nice job.
00:07:13.892 - 00:07:36.042, Speaker A: Thank you. That's very nice. Yes. A little bit of a rhetorical question, but also they do these fellowships with academics. I remember when I talked to David about this at some point early on. And also, it's the best BPI, by the way, there is a different BPI called the Bank Policy Institute, which I believe Jamie Dimon is currently the president of. So that's we're talking about the better, the correct BPI.
00:07:36.066 - 00:07:37.906, Speaker B: It's like Superman, Bizarro Superman.
00:07:38.058 - 00:08:26.090, Speaker A: One of the most interesting things that I thought and kind of makes, it's a similar. It's related in some ways to your guys approach with resistance money was that they said there was a notable lack of access academic research about bitcoin. And some people are like, well, why do we need academy? Who cares? Bitcoin's doing just fine without it. But they made the point that, well, academic research eventually ends up cited by other research which gets cited in policy memos and becomes part of law or executive orders, and that actually other industries have robust academic research pipelines, if nothing else than for that self serving purpose. Is that in a similar way, you said that it was important to you guys to publish resistance money under an academic press, right?
00:08:26.990 - 00:09:27.866, Speaker B: Why publishing through an academic press? There are problems with peer review, but for people who still trust institutions, an academic press grants an imprimatur on the book, and it helps people take it seriously who otherwise might not. And right now, there's a misinformation pipeline from academics to media outlets to policymakers. It's a sewage pipeline. Let's be honest, a lot of the things that you see in the New York Times, it's fud, basically, not all of it, but a good deal of it. And that makes its way all the way to the policymakers. If you look at some of these, like, blog posts from the White House or reports from the Office of Technology and Science, I mean, you'll find these terrible pieces of scholarship done by people like Alex de Vries and Mora and others.
00:09:27.978 - 00:09:28.858, Speaker A: Mora et al.
00:09:28.954 - 00:10:12.192, Speaker B: Exactly. And so with BPI and my co authors, we would like to create an alternative pipeline where we can feed policymakers and media outlets more reliable research. We're not bitcoin pumpers and we're nonpartisan. And so we felt like we could create this alternative pipeline and just shoot the book through so that we can nudge the world in a way less towards misinformation and disinformation, but towards the truth of the matter, which is that bitcoin is overall good for the world.
00:10:12.376 - 00:10:46.204, Speaker A: I think it really adds a very powerful, thoughtful nuanced critical voice to the discussion, because again, there's dozens. I even wrote the forward to one of these so called histories of money. Right? Like there's so many, and so many people just don't care, which is totally fine. I mean, there are literally dozens of us who do care. But many people just think they just need to. They need to make money and hope that they spend less than they make, that they can buy a car, a house, send their kid to school or whatever. They're not interested in how money works, and that's fine.
00:10:46.204 - 00:11:12.752, Speaker A: So those never really work to explain bitcoin, because now you're, you know, I guess maybe we're nerdy or I'm nerdy. Most people's eyes gloss over at the idea of economics. Right. Like, I was thinking back on this, maybe because I work in New York and I, and I work in bitcoin and bitcoin research, but most people I recall that I remember from college, including me, we were looked at as pretty nerdy for even taking econ.
00:11:12.896 - 00:11:14.424, Speaker B: Yeah, well, you are nerdy.
00:11:14.472 - 00:11:14.792, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:11:14.816 - 00:11:46.894, Speaker B: Yes. I appreciate that. No, I think that's right. If you are an ETF issuer, let's say, or you're coinbase or cash app or whatever, you're selling bitcoin. There are a lot of people who might buy bitcoin but don't because they think it's overall bad or they don't know a lot about it. So how do you educate them? We don't educate them by making argument to buy directly. I don't think because pitches like this, and they are more like pitches and people can feel it.
00:11:46.894 - 00:11:58.130, Speaker B: It feels more like a used car salesman. Why are you doing this? But an argument that bitcoin is overall good for the world whether or not you buy it, I think that really speaks to people and adds some credibility.
00:11:58.430 - 00:12:21.418, Speaker A: Yeah. How much do you think they need to know about how bitcoin works? This is another, I think, path that a lot of bitcoin educators go down, which is, I love content about how bitcoin works, but in terms of converting people into liking bitcoin, not many people know how the dollar works. Is that important or is it less important? I'm not sure.
00:12:21.594 - 00:12:45.872, Speaker B: Well, I'm glad you said this, because the financial plumbing for the dollar is highly intricate. I myself don't fully understand it, despite some years of study. And I think something similar is true for bitcoin. You don't need to know how lightning works. You just need to know what it does. You need to know it's like functional essence. What does it offer? Well, it offers some level of censorship resistance.
00:12:45.872 - 00:13:14.374, Speaker B: It's privacy enhancing and so on. Now, we explain these things in the book, but in a non technical way. And I'll give you an example where we do it. So instead of describing how bitcoin works by introducing, you know, all the technical, like hashing algorithms and public key cryptography and so on, like you would encounter in mastering bitcoin by Andreas Antanaopolis. I mean, that's a great tool. It's the book I use to learn, to learn bitcoin. But this is not.
00:13:14.374 - 00:13:38.994, Speaker B: But you can't give mastering bitcoin, you know, like a 400 page manual, like technical manual for how it works. I mean, that's like sending people to GitHub. It's not a useful thing. And so what we say is that the bitcoin network is like a decentralized publishing system. That's what it does. And miners are publishers, and nodes are like referees who are referring transactions for, like, grammar and things. And then the users are co authoring with each other.
00:13:38.994 - 00:14:09.390, Speaker B: They're sending these little chunks of text to get into this very public but secure document, which is just the text of all the bitcoin being flung around. And so we think if we can compare bitcoin to something that already exists, that people already grasp how to publish something, then I think that this is one step towards understanding and getting rid of people's ignorance so they can more readily accept what bitcoin can actually do for the world.
00:14:09.730 - 00:14:27.734, Speaker A: What has the reaction been in the philosophy community? I don't see a lot of number one Amazon books on the top of the charts, which I know it was or is in the philosophy category. I'm sure this has made some interesting waves on the philosophy side.
00:14:27.822 - 00:14:58.620, Speaker B: It's interesting because in order for us to work on bitcoin, we had to be comfortable with burning bridges. And that's because most academics in the humanities, which is where you would house philosophy, is. So this area of the academy is more hostile to bitcoin than other areas of the academy. And so, you know, my co authors especially, are well connected in the philosophy world and well liked. So there aren't.
00:14:59.160 - 00:15:00.320, Speaker A: Guess I can see it.
00:15:00.440 - 00:15:09.952, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. You know, there aren't, like, rude criticisms, but a lot of it is just, let's ignore this to see if it goes away. It's not gonna go away.
00:15:10.096 - 00:15:15.696, Speaker A: It's just interesting because, you know, I studied philosophy, mostly political philosophy.
00:15:15.768 - 00:15:16.160, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:16.240 - 00:15:34.722, Speaker A: From John Stuart Mill to all the way to the crazy libertarians like Robert Nozick was one of my favorites. That's terrific. But I never. Maybe I didn't get deep in the philosophy department in college. I wasn't really aware of what new philosophy people are working on.
00:15:34.786 - 00:15:35.274, Speaker B: Sure.
00:15:35.402 - 00:15:42.510, Speaker A: Is there. What would they rather have you been writing? What would turn the wheels of the philosophy world if you had written well.
00:15:43.010 - 00:16:41.014, Speaker B: So my co authors and I were actually trained in metaphysics, and I was also trained in philosophical logic. And we discuss such world changing questions as, what is a table? But usually, like, what's the fundamental structure of the world? Do we have free will? Does God exist? These are the kinds of questions. But lately. So first, in the medium term past, there has been a focus on smaller and smaller questions, because philosophers from the tradition that we come from, value, clarity and rigorous. And so the idea is that the smaller question that you can ask, you bite off a smaller chunk, you can actually chew it and make some progress. And so, you know, the areas of philosophy that we come from are more technical, but they don't link up to the real world. And the consequences, you know, the practical consequences come way far downfield, if at all.
00:16:41.014 - 00:17:00.590, Speaker B: And so we are more now like in, I guess, not just metaphysics, but like applied ethics of technology and bitcoin in particular. And people do work on this kind of thing, especially like now with AI. But we're the only ones who work on bitcoin, and we hope that changes with the book.
00:17:00.670 - 00:17:27.788, Speaker A: I think it will. I think it's an inspiring book, and I thought it was a great effort. I haven't really read anything philosophy related since college, although I loved it at the time because I study. I majored in political science and minored in political philosophy. Terrific. And I haven't seen, I feel like we're just at a renaissance in the world, and we should have more philosophers. I would say, in general, philosophers have.
00:17:27.804 - 00:17:55.400, Speaker B: A lot more to offer the world than I think they currently do. So I like to think of philosophy as a discipline, as weighing reasons. And you can weigh all sorts of reasons for all sorts of claims. This is what we're trained in. And I think right now philosophers are weighing reasons for some strange claims and for claims that don't have practical consequences for the world, even though their salaries are often funded by, like, the federal government or the taxpayers.
00:17:55.480 - 00:17:55.936, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:17:55.968 - 00:17:56.368, Speaker B: Too bad.
00:17:56.424 - 00:17:58.800, Speaker A: So you want some more practical? Well, this is certainly practical.
00:17:58.880 - 00:18:13.680, Speaker B: I hope so. I mean, bitcoin is a really important technology. It's one that I think will be around for quite a while. And in addition to that, it's not harmful, but beneficial. And I hope that people are convinced of that, and I hope they read and understand.
00:18:14.660 - 00:18:29.160, Speaker A: Before we wrap, Craig, I wanted to ask you your impressions of the bitcoin conference this year. We're recording on Thursday, July 25. It's the first day of the conference. It's not. The full conference starts tomorrow, but what are your impressions today?
00:18:30.860 - 00:19:05.780, Speaker B: Yeah, it's ginormous. I've never seen anything like it. I've been to a handful of bitcoin conferences, but this is in a league of its own, not only with the number of people who are here, but the energy that's here, no doubt because of probably some of the higher status speakers that will be here throughout the weekend. So I'm excited to see what happens. And one of the things that really excites me about coming to such a conference are all the new social connections and what might result from that. I mean, builders meet each other, so, I mean, all sorts of new things could happen through development and intellectual work, hopefully.
00:19:05.860 - 00:19:06.148, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:06.204 - 00:19:06.748, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:19:06.884 - 00:19:12.700, Speaker A: I think it's gonna be really exciting. And you're speaking here, right? You guys are. Is there a resistance money panel?
00:19:12.780 - 00:19:17.604, Speaker B: There's not, but my two co authors are here, and they'll be monitoring panels.
00:19:17.652 - 00:19:18.300, Speaker A: There you go.
00:19:18.420 - 00:19:21.988, Speaker B: They'll be on the live desk, and one of them will make a very big announcement.
00:19:22.044 - 00:19:24.060, Speaker A: Oh, resistance 22.
00:19:24.140 - 00:19:24.564, Speaker B: Yes.
00:19:24.652 - 00:19:29.040, Speaker A: Re evaluating the case to evaluate bitcoin philosophically. Yes.
00:19:29.660 - 00:19:30.788, Speaker B: So stay tuned.
00:19:30.924 - 00:19:43.828, Speaker A: What's next for you? What's next? What do you got? You book us out. You've got a job, you're a professor. What do you think? Is it moving the ball with resistance money, or what's your next project? Have you decided?
00:19:43.964 - 00:20:26.430, Speaker B: Yeah. So there are larger scale projects that are in the works, which I'm very excited about, not only with bitcoin Policy Institute, but with something else in higher ed. This is related to my, one of my co authors announcements this weekend. Very excited about it. We think that it will be important for bitcoin scholarship and crypto scholarship in higher ed. And at the same time, for the next several months, several of us from the Bitcoin Policy Institute will be writing a book on bitcoin policy, making concrete proposals, not pie in the sky. Here's what we wish would happen, but here's what should happen if we're going to treat bitcoin fairly.
00:20:26.510 - 00:20:45.806, Speaker A: I love that. And the philosophical case for really, is bitcoin good or bad for the world? That actually does have practical applications, particularly with governments around the world trying to decide what their policies and laws around bitcoin should be. Right. I mean, it is still at that fundamental level for at least half the population. Right.
00:20:45.958 - 00:21:22.432, Speaker B: I think that's so. Another bitcoin policy fellow, Troy Cross, recently released a report about the political leanings of bitcoin owners and people who don't hold bitcoin. And surprisingly, at least surprising to me, the distribution across the political spectrum is pretty even. I think education, more than political bias is the biggest problem right now. But in government and in policy, I think it's the other way around. And so we hope to tackle these, these two fronts on the war of information at the same time.
00:21:22.536 - 00:21:23.104, Speaker A: Love it.
00:21:23.192 - 00:21:23.416, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:21:23.448 - 00:21:48.982, Speaker A: Check out that report, the poll also from Troy Cross, it also showed that the largest owner base on political cohort were those who had self characterized themselves as very liberal. That was the largest. I think most people, if you're on bitcoin Twitter, you might think it was the other way around, but it was very diversified. And you're right, it was frankly quite similar to the just natural full population breakdown on those same questions.
00:21:49.046 - 00:21:56.370, Speaker B: That's right. I mean, it's a good lesson to learn that Twitter may not be a representative sample.
00:21:56.830 - 00:21:58.250, Speaker A: Twitter is not real life.
00:21:59.270 - 00:22:00.430, Speaker B: It's a part of real life.
00:22:00.470 - 00:22:11.186, Speaker A: Maybe that might be a philosophical question. We see that for later. Craig Warmke, my friend, philosophy professor, co author of Resistance Money and BPI fellow, thank you for, thanks for coming on Galaxy brands.
