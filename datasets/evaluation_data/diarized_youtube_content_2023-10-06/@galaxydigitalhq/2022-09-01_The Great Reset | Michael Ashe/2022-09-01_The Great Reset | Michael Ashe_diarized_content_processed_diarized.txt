00:00:01.120 - 00:00:24.158, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. I'm Mike Novogratz, and this is next with Novo. Welcome, everybody. Another episode of next with Novo Crypto focused. I'm here today with Michael Ash. Michael runs the investment banking advisory business at Galaxy. You know, it's been three months since.
00:00:24.286 - 00:00:29.242, Speaker B: The great 2022 crypto crash, and I.
00:00:29.258 - 00:00:39.734, Speaker A: Figured it was a good idea to get Michael's perspective on our industry. He sees a lot m and a people trying to raise capital.
00:00:40.034 - 00:00:41.466, Speaker B: And so, Michael, welcome.
00:00:41.610 - 00:00:42.858, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:00:43.026 - 00:00:44.618, Speaker B: We were just talking this term.
00:00:44.666 - 00:00:48.454, Speaker A: Crypto winner kind of is a shitty term. Give me your idea.
00:00:48.954 - 00:00:50.042, Speaker C: I hate the term.
00:00:50.178 - 00:00:54.096, Speaker D: I think it's antiquated. Um, I think maybe when you looked.
00:00:54.120 - 00:00:56.376, Speaker C: At, like, the past resets, let's.
00:00:56.400 - 00:01:05.400, Speaker D: Let's call them, I think it made more sense, right. Because effectively what happened was you had capital falling away from the system.
00:01:05.552 - 00:01:05.936, Speaker C: Right.
00:01:06.000 - 00:01:15.472, Speaker D: And the big difference, and we've heard a bunch of people say it. Dan Moorhead said it at one of the conferences recently, we all of a sudden have real institutional, long term capital in the space.
00:01:15.648 - 00:01:16.176, Speaker C: Right.
00:01:16.280 - 00:01:27.092, Speaker D: And over the past three months, in what everyone is referring to as this new winter, we're seeing partnerships continue to happen. We're seeing institutions continue to come in, whether it's Blackrock with Coinbase or otherwise.
00:01:27.228 - 00:01:27.904, Speaker C: Right.
00:01:28.604 - 00:01:43.300, Speaker D: And we're still seeing, though, on the early stage side, capital being put to work. And I think once you start to see some more macro indicators moving in the right direction, hopefully today is the start of that. I think you'll see even mid to later stage stuff starting to become more.
00:01:43.332 - 00:01:45.296, Speaker C: Active and more prevalent as you're hearing.
00:01:45.320 - 00:01:51.056, Speaker A: It loud and clear. This is not a crypto winner. Galaxy is making that claim right now.
00:01:51.160 - 00:01:52.040, Speaker B: We're going to call it the great.
00:01:52.072 - 00:02:10.884, Speaker A: Reset, maybe the washout of horribly managed businesses, the wash out of excessive risk taking, but not a crypto winner. So, Michael, tell us a little bit what you're seeing. The m and a space. There's one story that, oh, my God, it's so busy. Sam Bankman Fried has been gobbling up companies.
00:02:11.244 - 00:02:12.564, Speaker B: But what's the reality?
00:02:12.724 - 00:02:19.660, Speaker D: I think the reality is that if you look at the past, call it two years, it's been incredibly difficult for m and A to get done in this space.
00:02:19.772 - 00:02:20.044, Speaker C: Right.
00:02:20.084 - 00:02:46.296, Speaker D: And the reason for that, very simply, is that there's been such an abundance of capital at almost whatever valuation. If you're a highly sought after company, you choose it to be. And so this idea of a control premium that exists in traditional markets where to own a company outright, you need to pay a premium over what would theoretically be kind of market value that never existed. So you could actually raise capital at a much higher valuation than you could sell your business at.
00:02:46.320 - 00:02:48.736, Speaker C: And so, rightfully so, no one is.
00:02:48.760 - 00:03:18.224, Speaker D: Going down the path of m and A. Fast forward to three months ago. Yeah, valuations decimated really across the space. And so all of a sudden I think every company, big and small, is reassessing what their m and a strategy is. I think outwardly a lot of the large cap names in the space are saying they want to be aggressive, they want to do these roll up strategies, which all makes sense. We're certainly not yet seeing that level of aggressiveness that I think is outwardly been kind of told to the market.
00:03:18.344 - 00:03:21.080, Speaker C: There's still lots of conservatism, there are.
00:03:21.112 - 00:03:43.094, Speaker D: Still certain parts of the space that are more sought after than others. And so I still believe that there is some fear amongst some of these companies as it relates to what their m and a strategy actually looks like. Even though I would tell you right now, almost every company that we talk to has or will shortly contemplate a potential sale.
00:03:43.514 - 00:03:44.122, Speaker C: Interesting.
00:03:44.178 - 00:03:47.522, Speaker A: So not a lot happening yet, but things will happen.
00:03:47.618 - 00:03:50.986, Speaker B: Listen, there's a little bit of a.
00:03:51.050 - 00:03:56.178, Speaker A: Tale of two cities. The way I see things, there's companies that have a whole bunch of cash.
00:03:56.306 - 00:04:00.946, Speaker B: That raised early, are raised at the right time.
00:04:01.050 - 00:04:09.026, Speaker A: There are a lot of companies that are smaller. They're going to run out of cash. What's the timing of that? When do you see those guys waking up to the new reality of saying.
00:04:09.050 - 00:05:00.328, Speaker D: Oh shit, we're definitely seeing companies who are well capitalized lining up to figure out what their m and a strategy is to try to be a buyer. That's happening. On the other hand, I think what's interesting, and we've talked about this in the past, is that you have companies who maybe they raised capital twelve months ago, maybe it was 18 months ago, who right now are appropriately capitalized, but will likely need to raise capital at some point in the next twelve, give or take months. Right. And if we don't see a significant uptick from a capital markets perspective, if we don't see investors underwriting those types of deals, and we do believe that investors generally are going to be a bit more conservative, they're going to do more diligence, they're going to be probably a bit more thoughtful as it relates to where they deploy that capital. We're going to see a number of companies come into liquidity issues over the next twelve months. They probably won't be the big name.
00:05:00.376 - 00:05:03.302, Speaker C: Brand companies that we've been talking about.
00:05:03.318 - 00:05:14.078, Speaker D: For the past three months. But that's where I think you'll see a lot of m and A, where companies are approaching that liquidity issue, all of a sudden recognize the matter, put themselves up for sale, and becomes a fire sale.
00:05:14.166 - 00:05:15.630, Speaker A: What are the hotspots?
00:05:15.822 - 00:05:18.838, Speaker B: If there's one assignment you want, because.
00:05:18.886 - 00:05:28.534, Speaker A: You know, everybody wants to buy a company that does ABC, what are the hotspots or hot jobs, skill sets or spots?
00:05:28.874 - 00:05:56.462, Speaker D: The two things we're seeing on everyone's wish list, it's licenses and it's geographic expansion. So if you're a us based exchange looking to move into the APAC region or moving to move into the EMEA region, what licenses does that come with? I think the one interesting thing that we've seen, because we've been in market, and we've obviously seen what's happened around the space. If you started building a licensed portfolio.
00:05:56.598 - 00:05:58.734, Speaker C: Five years ago, it may have taken.
00:05:58.774 - 00:06:41.674, Speaker D: You five years to get to where you are today, where you feel like you're fully licensed. That doesn't mean if you started today, it will take you five years. This ever evolving regulatory landscape still will rear its head, even on an m and a front, because a lot of these license plays are going to become less attractive as companies figure out how to gain their own licenses organically, which is, as you would expect, significantly cheaper. And so we certainly watch that the geographic piece is really important. There's a lot happening in the Middle east. There's a lot happening in India and the broader APAC region. We're definitely seeing lots of interest there from the companies that we're talking to.
00:06:41.674 - 00:06:53.830, Speaker D: Look, the one thing which has never, uh, loss any interest is need for cryptographers. Right. Um, and so the need to, to acquire talent today is as intense as it arguably has ever been.
00:06:53.982 - 00:06:55.806, Speaker C: Um, and so we're, we're continuing to.
00:06:55.830 - 00:06:58.474, Speaker D: See companies focus on bringing that talent in house.
00:06:59.454 - 00:07:04.478, Speaker A: There's absolutely no crypto winner talking to Michael Ash. Michael. So we got into this business a.
00:07:04.486 - 00:07:09.102, Speaker B: Few years ago, and my thought was, hire a bunch of people that knew.
00:07:09.118 - 00:07:09.958, Speaker A: How to be bankers.
00:07:10.046 - 00:07:10.478, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:07:10.566 - 00:07:17.874, Speaker A: And put them on a crash course in crypto, so they didn't develop the domain expertise, so you actually can serve as clients.
00:07:19.974 - 00:07:21.838, Speaker B: I saw recently, Molis decided they were.
00:07:21.846 - 00:07:30.790, Speaker A: Going to get into this space. Who are the competitors in the field of providing great advice and service to the crypto community?
00:07:30.902 - 00:07:32.354, Speaker D: Look, I think right now.
00:07:35.814 - 00:07:36.446, Speaker C: Every mid.
00:07:36.470 - 00:07:44.050, Speaker D: Market, every large bank, financial institution is putting together some sort of digital asset blockchain focused advisory coverage group.
00:07:44.182 - 00:07:44.522, Speaker A: Right.
00:07:44.578 - 00:07:57.610, Speaker D: Typically, you would take from your fintech team or your tech team and sort of put together a group of people. Look, I think where we believe what we offer is fundamentally very different is that we've all been in this space for a long time.
00:07:57.722 - 00:07:57.970, Speaker C: Right.
00:07:58.002 - 00:08:23.864, Speaker D: I've been an investor in this space since 2015. When we hire people like, you're right, we hire bankers. But there needs to be that inherent experience or belief or, frankly, obsession with the broader crypto space. And so the large benefit that we bring is if you have all those people in a room sitting in an organization like Galaxy, where you can work with our research team, where you can work with our trading team, you can.
00:08:23.904 - 00:08:26.072, Speaker C: Work with people in this space that.
00:08:26.088 - 00:08:37.691, Speaker D: Are viewing this from a very close perspective, that domain expertise is fundamentally very different. And so there are a couple shops similar to ours that are very focused on this.
00:08:37.847 - 00:08:41.051, Speaker C: Um, one based out of the AIPAC.
00:08:41.107 - 00:08:43.243, Speaker D: Region, um, one on the west coast.
00:08:43.363 - 00:08:45.619, Speaker C: Look, I, you know, I I always.
00:08:45.651 - 00:08:53.051, Speaker D: Say to our team, the. The more people, the more advisors that are focused on the space, the better. Just means that we're doing something that's real and has real opportunity.
00:08:53.227 - 00:08:53.659, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:53.731 - 00:08:55.419, Speaker D: Um, but I think when we actually.
00:08:55.451 - 00:09:10.868, Speaker A: I believe that as well. Like, we're such a young industry, competitors are, in a bizarre way, collaborators. Right. You're proselytizers, you're bringing people into the tent. You're giving advice and teaching people and showing them what might be the future.
00:09:11.036 - 00:09:11.944, Speaker C: That's right.
00:09:12.244 - 00:09:14.004, Speaker A: Just wanna make sure we get our fair share of the.
00:09:14.044 - 00:09:15.944, Speaker D: I was gonna say our job is to beat all of them.
00:09:17.684 - 00:09:19.664, Speaker A: Well, I certainly appreciate it.
00:09:21.324 - 00:09:23.036, Speaker B: You look at your crystal ball.
00:09:23.100 - 00:09:26.372, Speaker A: Now, we've established there's not a crypto winter.
00:09:26.468 - 00:09:31.012, Speaker B: There's a lot of under the hood.
00:09:31.068 - 00:09:36.894, Speaker A: Activity, not a lot of deals yet, other than the few that were real distressed plays. But a lot of companies that raised.
00:09:36.934 - 00:09:40.838, Speaker B: At high valuation will need a new round.
00:09:40.926 - 00:09:52.246, Speaker A: Has any of that started yet? And when does that start, and who will the players be? Is it the Apollos that are going to come in or the fortresses? Because the crypto community doesn't have that kind of capital.
00:09:52.350 - 00:09:53.710, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
00:09:53.742 - 00:10:00.222, Speaker D: I mean, look, I think we're already seeing some of those large cap names. Look at these opportunities. Many of them are thinking about them.
00:10:00.238 - 00:10:03.042, Speaker C: From a secondary perspective, like, start to.
00:10:03.058 - 00:10:35.444, Speaker D: Clean out the cap table. You have early employees, you've got early investors who have been there for three plus years, five plus years in some cases. And for those employees or those early holders. If you're selling not at 8 billion, but at $7 billion, you're probably doing fine. And so we're starting to see some of that. We are starting to have conversations with potential issuers about some of those raises. Look, we are going to see more and more investors rather come into the space, whether it's the Apollos, the fortresses, or otherwise.
00:10:35.444 - 00:10:46.404, Speaker D: You still have Andreessen as an example, sitting on $7.5 billion. You saw lightspeed, went out and raised billions of dollars. There is so much capital right now allocated for this space.
00:10:48.264 - 00:10:49.800, Speaker C: I don't think it'll be for lack of capital.
00:10:49.912 - 00:11:09.298, Speaker D: What will happen is you'll see more and more concentrated capital towards perceived winners. This concept of FAANG, I think, will start to appear in crypto, and for those companies, you will see no shortage of demand. There will be valuation considerations. A lot of the companies today, business.
00:11:09.346 - 00:11:12.938, Speaker C: Models, they're frankly very tied to market.
00:11:12.986 - 00:11:35.914, Speaker D: Pricing and token pricing. And so if the market's on 60%, you can have the best year you've ever had. But if you're contingent upon market pricing, your revenues are down 60%. Well, I think we will see structure, though. You'll see converts, you'll see other instruments used that haven't been used in the past to try to bridge that last round to today's market.
00:11:36.414 - 00:11:36.702, Speaker B: No.
00:11:36.718 - 00:11:43.470, Speaker A: If you think about the custody business, the asset management business, your assets are priced in crypto. Crypto goes down, your fees go down.
00:11:43.502 - 00:11:46.350, Speaker B: And so it is challenging to manage.
00:11:46.422 - 00:11:50.262, Speaker A: These businesses as long as crypto stays 100 of all assets.
00:11:50.318 - 00:11:53.554, Speaker C: Yeah. Well, that's where hedging matters.
00:11:54.374 - 00:12:27.750, Speaker D: Will we see more sophistication on the derivative side? What can we do to try to help some of those treasuries and some of those, frankly, revenue models take out some of that volatility, because there are things people can and should be doing again, you're going to lose some of the upside. What we just down saw over the past three months is going to take out revenues for some companies to a degree which makes them almost not financeable. I think as the industry matures, you will see more and more treasuries and more and more management teams lean in towards trying to utilize derivatives.
00:12:27.822 - 00:12:35.754, Speaker A: I think the mining business learned that the hard way and learned it fastest in this last sell off.
00:12:37.234 - 00:12:38.774, Speaker B: Well, Michael, it's fascinating.
00:12:39.194 - 00:12:52.258, Speaker A: We're establishing, we got to come up with a slogan, there is no crypto winner. We're going to call it the great reset. I think opportunities for your business, for advisory, for banking and for the whole.
00:12:52.306 - 00:12:55.250, Speaker B: Space are as exciting as ever.
00:12:55.442 - 00:13:11.018, Speaker A: I do wonder what the climb out trajectory is. It would be strange to me that there's a voice, because we had the greatest asset bubble of all time, not just in crypto, but outside of crypto.
00:13:11.146 - 00:13:12.774, Speaker B: That is being popped.
00:13:14.354 - 00:13:17.330, Speaker A: You've got this secular trend, which you.
00:13:17.362 - 00:13:21.602, Speaker B: See and I see accelerating, versus the.
00:13:21.618 - 00:13:23.934, Speaker A: Fact that you had to take some of the fluff out of the market.
00:13:24.994 - 00:13:35.646, Speaker B: We'll watch carefully. I think it's going to be less explosive, but a continuous adoption cycle, and.
00:13:35.670 - 00:13:41.550, Speaker A: Then if the central banks flinch or get too easy, you might see that.
00:13:41.742 - 00:13:44.046, Speaker B: Price of bitcoin, price of ethereum accelerate.
00:13:44.150 - 00:13:51.006, Speaker A: Which then will create the hype cycle again. It feels like there's less downside than we all feared two months ago.
00:13:51.150 - 00:13:52.054, Speaker D: I also think.
00:13:52.134 - 00:13:53.194, Speaker B: Don't jinx me.
00:13:53.894 - 00:13:59.514, Speaker D: I also think that the big difference now versus six months ago is we're using the word utility a lot.
00:14:00.444 - 00:14:02.100, Speaker C: And so how do you bring utility.
00:14:02.132 - 00:14:06.684, Speaker D: Into some of these projects that maybe didn't exist within the past two years?
00:14:06.844 - 00:14:08.292, Speaker C: And I think we're starting to see.
00:14:08.308 - 00:14:16.668, Speaker D: Some of these projects move towards that. We're starting to see real life applications, and that, in my mind, should obviate some of the volatility and some of.
00:14:16.676 - 00:14:17.784, Speaker C: The risks that we've seen.
00:14:18.644 - 00:14:20.064, Speaker B: It probably also.
00:14:22.164 - 00:14:50.356, Speaker A: Requires a shift in token economics. A lot of these projects, I've been talking about this a lot. A lot of the token economics make no sense because they were people trying to work themselves around regulation or unclear regulation. And why we've been pushing for clarity and regulation is because then you can at least know how to design a token. I keep saying my mother, I should be able to explain to her how the token works.
00:14:50.540 - 00:14:52.060, Speaker B: At this point, I have really smart.
00:14:52.092 - 00:15:14.564, Speaker A: People explaining to me how the token works, and I have to ask the question, question like six times, and I'm not that smart, but I'm not dumb. And so as an industry, we really need to get to a simpler idea of how different tokens work, and they're going to work very differently. Bitcoin's going to have a different token economic model than uniswap or some other decentralized exchange.
00:15:15.824 - 00:15:21.136, Speaker D: To your point, though, like regulation solves that to some degree, right? Because once there is, and we say.
00:15:21.160 - 00:15:27.604, Speaker C: This a lot, even no matter what the regulatory outcome is, the industry will.
00:15:27.644 - 00:15:37.144, Speaker D: Innovate around whatever that construct actually looks like. Right. And so any clarity at this point, I think is ultimately massively beneficial to the space.
00:15:38.044 - 00:15:47.836, Speaker A: All right, well, listen, I promised my viewers I would never have a banker on for more than 20 minutes because, like, Jesus, bankers in general aren't the most dynamic of guys. It's kind of like this.
00:15:47.940 - 00:15:48.388, Speaker D: It's fair.
00:15:48.436 - 00:15:57.828, Speaker A: The joke of sitting next to the banker at the dinner party. You'd rather sit next to the artist. You're kind of a half crypto Degen, half crypto banker. So we gave you the full 20.
00:15:57.876 - 00:15:58.676, Speaker C: Take it.
00:15:58.860 - 00:16:05.844, Speaker A: Thanks a lot, Michael. This has been great. It's another episode with. Next with Novo, live from the Galaxy old headquarters.
