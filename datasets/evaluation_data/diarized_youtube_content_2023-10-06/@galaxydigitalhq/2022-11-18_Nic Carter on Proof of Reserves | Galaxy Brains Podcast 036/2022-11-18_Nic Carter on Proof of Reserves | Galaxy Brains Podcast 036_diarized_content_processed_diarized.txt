00:00:09.360 - 00:00:29.776, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. We're talking with Nick Carter about proof of reserves. We always think twice, yo, we never need jerk I'm done with FTX, y'all. I'm sick of these jerks. Let's go. As always, I'm your host Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital. We have an awesome show for you today.
00:00:29.776 - 00:01:26.112, Speaker A: As I said, we're talking with Coin Metrics co founder and co founder of Castle Island Ventures, Nick Carter about proof of reserves and how it could help the cryptocurrency industry in the wake of the collapse of FTX. We're going to check in with Christine Kim from Galaxy Research on updates and upgrades in the Ethereum ecosystem. And as always, we'll talk with our friend Bimnet of BB from Galaxy Digital trading about markets. But before we begin, please refer to the disclaimers in the link on the podcast notes and note that none of the information provided during this podcast constitutes investment advice or recommendation, solicitation or offer by Galaxy digital or its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. We got that disclaimer out of the way, so let's get right into it. Let's go to our friend Bim Netabeebe from Galaxy Digital trading. Bim not a lot of macro news happening today in the markets, or this week even.
00:01:26.112 - 00:01:43.524, Speaker A: And obviously the main story is FTX and the attendant fallout, both with affiliated contagion across lenders and funds, the buy side very affected by exchange withdrawal halts, but also in the markets themselves. What are you seeing?
00:01:45.064 - 00:02:49.104, Speaker B: We're seeing sort of a continued grind lower in spot prices. You've definitely bounced from the panic low of the FTX day, but price action in general has not been constructive. Liquidity has been poor vols and sort of protection costs are still fairly elevated. So what that tells me is that this is a market that's fairly fragile. The other thing of note that's actually very important is that with all of the credit that has now left the system, borrows are incredibly tough in crypto, and if you look at things like CME basis, it's implying like 40, 50, 60% below spot on an annualized basis. And that shows you that there isn't that much spot BTC collateral or ETH collateral that's available to folks. In addition, I think a lot of alt liquidity originated in FTX with their perp product.
00:02:49.104 - 00:03:59.712, Speaker B: And so now the only other places you can really trade perps are binance and DyDX and a little bit on OKX. But if you don't have access to those platforms, it's very hard to sell perps. And so there's a lot of liquidity and technical things in the market that highlight that it is a little bit broken. And so my thought process is really around with any investment or any sort of short term tactical trade is who's the marginal buyer and who's the marginal seller. And right now, I think it's very tough to see who the marginal buyer is and a lot of alt tokens. I kind of see some long term hodler types buying bitcoin because it's moved down a lot. And in relation to other assets around the world, the macro stuff, stocks are, you know, close to the local highs.
00:03:59.712 - 00:04:59.884, Speaker B: Dollars sold off a lot, yields have moved a lot lower. So in that context, bitcoin seems like one of the best risk assets to own. And just in that context, so I can definitely see people that are into holding bitcoin in the long run, being like this is a great value opportunity. At the same time, I definitely think that a lot of for selling has gone through in the market in terms of loans that didn't get topped up, folks liquidating collateral, folks getting to levels of spot or spot holdings that they're comfortable with, given the higher volume profile and the increased downside risks. So there's a lot, I do believe a lot of the forced selling has gone through. And that leaves you with in bitcoin at least, it's just minor flows. I'm sure later on in this episode you guys will dive deeper.
00:04:59.884 - 00:05:13.624, Speaker B: But miners have it incredibly rough right now. From a hashrate spot price and energy cost perspective, there's definitely marginal sell pressure from bitcoin miners.
00:05:14.044 - 00:05:26.614, Speaker A: That pressure, it's called $20 million a day of new bitcoin issuance that miners are receiving. That's enough to move pricier. I mean, is it that illiquid? Are the markets that thin these days?
00:05:28.794 - 00:06:00.036, Speaker B: What we observe in terms of liquidity at any given point in time is definitely worse than what we were two weeks ago. $20 million a day is normally not enough to move the market, but it's just the compounded effects over time. 20 million a day, after five days, it's $100,000,000.10 days. You're talking about 200. I don't know about you, but I've been speaking to a lot of folks in crypto this week, and there are very few buyers and very few people of that size. Yeah.
00:06:00.036 - 00:06:51.764, Speaker B: Of institutional length that are trying to get aggressive here. At the same time, there are sort of base effects at play here. It's an asset that's moved down, what, 55% on the year or something like that, 60% depending on what you're looking at. And so a thousand point move higher here is pretty chunky from a percentage standpoint. And also you have, there is a short base in this stuff, so you are prone to squeezes. And so tactically, I could definitely see a lot of short covering rallies, whatever it may be. But at the end of the day, I think there's probably still more fallout from FTX and Genesis and Gemini, urn, that's going to lead to some marginal selling.
00:06:51.764 - 00:07:11.052, Speaker B: And then on top of that, you have the marginal selling from the miners. And so I think my path of least resistance is likely lower. I also just don't see too many upside catalysts outside of. I mean, it's really tough for me to.
00:07:11.108 - 00:07:11.972, Speaker A: Loss for words.
00:07:12.108 - 00:07:14.140, Speaker B: Yeah, I've been on a loss for words before.
00:07:14.212 - 00:07:14.916, Speaker C: Yeah, you have.
00:07:15.020 - 00:07:17.264, Speaker A: I remember earlier this summer. Yeah.
00:07:17.854 - 00:08:05.958, Speaker B: So it's a really challenging environment to sort of figure out what the path forward here is. I think right now my favorite position is not having a position, waiting for what the fallout looks like. I don't think prices are likely to explode higher anytime soon. So while I am constructive on the space and bitcoin is an asset, and generally speaking, when collapses like this happen, they normally buy and forget about it for a little bit. Nine times out of ten, it's generally a good trade, so I'm inclined to think that way. However, the magnitude of FTX and the contagion is still unknown. So until you get more information, I think it's really tough to take a stand one direction or the other.
00:08:06.086 - 00:08:40.578, Speaker A: Totally get it. Yeah, we don't have that much information yet. I did see, I think the bankruptcy attorneys said they're hoping to publish a list on Friday, the day this podcast airs November 18, that will apparently detail the top 50 unsecured creditors. So hopefully that type of information will be very, the market will be very happy to have that, I guess. Lastly, when you look at the sort of alt space, particularly, that was connected to FTX, the Solanas, all the tokens that are maps.
00:08:40.626 - 00:08:42.346, Speaker B: I still don't know what the thing does.
00:08:42.530 - 00:08:44.150, Speaker A: Oxy and maps. Fida.
00:08:44.242 - 00:08:44.846, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:08:44.990 - 00:08:46.774, Speaker A: But also just the Solana ecosystem.
00:08:46.814 - 00:08:47.014, Speaker C: Yes.
00:08:47.054 - 00:08:53.954, Speaker A: I mean, you know, Solana's traded down pretty significantly over this. I saw Defi, TVL and Solana's down by like half.
00:08:54.414 - 00:09:35.038, Speaker B: I mean, well, the thing is, one, like you think about the TVL numbers, they were wrong to begin with. I mean, there was, it was two guys accounting for like, sole TVL back in the day. And I just think it goes to, you know, I'm sorry to get philosophical, but the culture of these VC's that, you know, wanted to get as much value into the Solana ecosystem as possible. If you take a thing like cosmos that's genuine, they didn't do the icos. They aren't huge venture bags. The growth and the hype was organic. And this stuff is just like, hey, we're going to buy this.
00:09:35.038 - 00:10:05.494, Speaker B: You market here, I market here. It has value because we both think it has value. And we found some lender that will lend to us dollar for dollar versus this stuff, or even unsecured. I think a lot of the soul ecosystem was built on building blocks that aren't real building blocks. They're not fundamentally good. It's like you're building a house from straw instead of bricks and solid material. You're not going to survive the winter with a straw.
00:10:05.494 - 00:10:07.490, Speaker B: You're not going to survive crypto winter.
00:10:07.522 - 00:10:09.698, Speaker A: With a straw house. If someone comes to huff and puff.
00:10:09.786 - 00:10:10.602, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:10:10.778 - 00:10:23.066, Speaker A: They're going to blow that house down. I do think Solana, though, we're going to have Saul Kadir from our team speak next week about Solana. He's very bullish on Solana still, and he'll give us his reasons why. I do think that it's not.
00:10:23.210 - 00:10:24.826, Speaker C: I'd love to be there for that, honestly.
00:10:24.850 - 00:10:25.934, Speaker B: Would love a debate.
00:10:26.434 - 00:10:31.294, Speaker A: I mean, look, I think there's. We'll wait and see. We'll table that discussion for now.
00:10:31.754 - 00:10:32.138, Speaker C: Heated.
00:10:32.186 - 00:10:32.786, Speaker B: Just saying.
00:10:32.890 - 00:10:54.538, Speaker A: The markets have really taken a hit. The sort of Sam bankman fried linked assets, including Solana, and many in its ecosystem over the last week or two. It's crazy times, man. Bim net's wearing this hat, says, let's get that bread. It's my hat. And my friend Rhea Bottoria at Castle Island Ventures gave me that hat. Thank you, Rhea.
00:10:54.626 - 00:10:55.322, Speaker C: Shout out, Rhea.
00:10:55.378 - 00:11:01.266, Speaker A: Hope you're doing well. All right, Bim Nadabibi, Galaxy digital trading. As always, my friend, thank you.
00:11:01.410 - 00:11:03.614, Speaker B: Thank you for the hat that I'm keeping.
00:11:05.554 - 00:11:18.186, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Nick Carter, founder, co founder of Coinmetrics, co founder and GP at Castle Island Ventures. The prince of proof of reserves, my friend. Welcome. Good to have you here.
00:11:18.330 - 00:11:25.234, Speaker C: I am thrilled to be here with you again. Alex, beautiful studio. Have. Love it. You guys have upgraded.
00:11:25.354 - 00:12:01.714, Speaker A: We have. And really appreciate that. Obviously, Nick, the FTX situation has been incredibly dramatic in the market and is having wide ranging effects, even just this morning, this is Wednesday that we're recording this genesis. Their lending business has essentially closed its doors, let alone the myriad buy side funds that have assets stuck in FTX. As we said last week, we have assets stuck on the exchange as well. What's your overall take on the current situation as it relates to, and also just the near medium long term impact on the cryptocurrency industry?
00:12:01.834 - 00:12:45.470, Speaker C: It's devastating. I mean, I said this last week, I think it's the worst single event to hit us in crypto. I mean, in the modern era of crypto, just like the level of trust that had been accumulated, their stature, the fact that they were an institutional exchange, they were custodian, the fallout is just enormous. And the regulatory machinations, the wheels are turning now. I mean, there's reprisals coming in Washington, if these headlines are to be believed. So I'm pretty scared about a, the continued fallout among the lenders. Certainly there's others, other exchanges.
00:12:45.470 - 00:13:21.434, Speaker C: No one trust has been eviscerated. No one's going to trust, I mean, for better or for worse, but I expect even Sam said it, there's secret insolvencies out there. So I think other exchanges, liquidity will be tested. We'll see if they're all fully reserved. Devastating for the crypto fund landscape, for crypto VC's. I mean, huge shattering of confidence, and it'll continue this little contagion. It's a continuation of the credit crisis we saw in the summer that was just put on pause, and now this is the last shoe to drop.
00:13:21.534 - 00:13:59.138, Speaker A: Yeah, it looks like they had big losses. Alameda most likely, along with others that we have learned about last spring, and I guess plugged the hole with a hidden internally labeled mislabeled fiat account is what he said. And what I'm referencing for the audience is that the Financial Times published a balance sheet that FTX had apparently gone out to potential investors with late last week, which seemed to add up over on one side of the balance sheet. But then there was a line that said -8 billion hidden internally mislabeled internal, poorly labeled fiat account.
00:13:59.226 - 00:14:02.330, Speaker C: Fiat -8 billion just as small. Over.
00:14:02.402 - 00:14:17.458, Speaker A: Yeah, just casually, you know, this balance sheet, but, you know, over here there's -8 billion. I don't know, but apparently it looks like they were plugging whatever whole Alameda had with these FTX funds. That's the prevailing wisdom at this point, although I'll caveat that we're not exactly certain what happened.
00:14:17.546 - 00:14:22.420, Speaker C: And it is, it's reminiscent of the tether Bitfinex situation, don't you think?
00:14:22.602 - 00:14:23.840, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, when they had to dip.
00:14:23.872 - 00:14:27.784, Speaker C: Into the exchange, they took their loss from, I think, this crypto capital or something.
00:14:27.824 - 00:14:32.192, Speaker A: Crypto capital, 150 million latin american company. They used to store some of the tethers.
00:14:32.248 - 00:14:39.280, Speaker C: God only knew this was years ago, and then they just dipped into the cookie jar and the tether reserves.
00:14:39.392 - 00:14:46.768, Speaker A: They socialized the losses among the Bitfinex account holders and issued them, what are they called? Rhrs. I think at the time. There's some.
00:14:46.856 - 00:14:49.280, Speaker C: Well, I guess that was around. That was the hack. Right.
00:14:49.312 - 00:14:57.766, Speaker A: So that was from the hack. Then. This was the second time they had to socialize losses, and they issued, like, a credit token for the difference, and they eventually paid it back.
00:14:57.830 - 00:15:05.334, Speaker C: Yeah. That's actually remarkable. Bitfinex is the case study in how to recover from a loss like this. In FTX's case, I think it's unrecoverable.
00:15:05.414 - 00:15:06.034, Speaker A: Right.
00:15:06.334 - 00:15:25.292, Speaker C: The hole is too big and the trust is completely lost. I think they did have an opportunity. If Sam had come clean right off the bat, and he was like, we're going to do the Bitfinex thing. We're going to give you a recovery. Right. Token or whatever. The next time Biff and X had their issue, they created the Leo token.
00:15:25.348 - 00:15:25.876, Speaker A: Right?
00:15:26.020 - 00:15:34.324, Speaker C: Right. So, like, there is precedent for ways out of these kinds of crises. This case not possible.
00:15:34.444 - 00:15:37.604, Speaker A: Right. And just or fold Alameda, you know, and keep FTX.
00:15:37.684 - 00:16:04.198, Speaker C: They could have sacrificed Alameda. I mean, I guess that was a big part of the FTX value prop. If you look at the early decks, I was looking at early FTX pitch decks that I had from back in the day. Alameda was front and center in the FTX pitch deck. Obviously a sign that something was amiss, but that was the value prop was, we will seed it with liquidity. It'll be liquid from day one because.
00:16:04.246 - 00:16:07.702, Speaker A: We have all this money we're going to put there. We're going to make markets there. We're going to.
00:16:07.838 - 00:16:19.618, Speaker C: I think it was true. It was very liquid. But of course, having it affiliated prop firm trading on your own exchange is the least kosher thing in.
00:16:19.666 - 00:16:23.938, Speaker A: Yeah, it's essentially totally not allowed in traditional markets.
00:16:23.986 - 00:16:46.494, Speaker C: Yeah. And so that was kind of always our issue with FTX was just the closeness of the Alameda relationship. Of course, they tried to sort of disguise that or imply that there was a chinese wall, which there wasn't at all. So I know a lot of people think it was kind of unforeseeable. I'm not saying we foresaw it, but we certainly always thought there was something iffy there with that relationship.
00:16:46.574 - 00:16:59.926, Speaker A: As a venture investor, which you are. I mean, I have to ask, too. One of the most incredible things. Meaning, like, shocking to have seen $32 billion, last valuation publicly known. No board. No board. I've demanded.
00:16:59.926 - 00:17:03.206, Speaker A: I did venture. We demand a board seat on a seed stage deal. Sure.
00:17:03.390 - 00:17:05.918, Speaker C: As do well, if we lead a series of.
00:17:05.926 - 00:17:12.514, Speaker A: That's what I mean. If we lead it. Yeah, yeah. And we'd like there to be a board. I mean, we'll start asking that early of a stage.
00:17:12.654 - 00:17:50.784, Speaker C: Corporate governance in startups has been so amiss for the last ten years. I mean, Zuckerberg and Facebook, there's all these structures now where there's a single founder who is this sort of icon and is able to command total authority. And this is the worst of it. And I think now the pendulum's gonna swing back towards real oversight, real corporate governance. But remember, in crypto, there's a real hesitancy to take board seats. Andreessen often doesn't do it for a lot of token related deals. Crypto funds often refuse to take board seats for liability reasons.
00:17:50.784 - 00:17:55.016, Speaker C: Because you're on the hook as a board director, I hear you. You are liable.
00:17:55.120 - 00:18:11.318, Speaker A: Let's talk about the pendulum swinging back. Let's talk about proof of reserves, which has been in the conversation a lot the last couple of weeks. This is not a new concept. And, Nick, you tell us you've been following this for a long time. You've got the proof of reserves leaderboard, Nickcarter, check that out.
00:18:11.366 - 00:18:13.206, Speaker C: My website traffic has exploded.
00:18:13.270 - 00:18:38.660, Speaker A: Has it really? I mean, I've said everyone's wondering, and Nick's been one of the only voices, but certainly probably the loudest, in calling for and documenting the implementation of this transparency measure for exchanges. Also can be done by custodians, really, anyone that possesses digital assets on behalf of third parties or other people. So, first of all, what is the concept of proof of reserves?
00:18:38.692 - 00:19:12.050, Speaker C: Tell us. Yeah, we have a nomenclature issue, to be honest with you, and we've actually been sweating over the nomenclature for years. There were advocates of calling it proof of solvency, which is maybe a more accurate term, because it does imply that you are balancing both sides of the balance sheet. I actually preferred proof of reserves as a terminal because you can't ever really prove solvency with a cryptographic procedure, because you need a full accounting of liabilities, like all sorts of exogenous liabilities corporate.
00:19:12.082 - 00:19:12.938, Speaker A: Debt, who knows what.
00:19:12.986 - 00:19:42.662, Speaker C: Exactly. So that can't be cryptographically demonstrated. So I know a lot of people say, oh, proof of reserves, that's just a proof of asset that doesn't include the liability side. Typically proof of reserve, as discussed, and it's a term of art. It's existed for a long time, as you say. The first proof of reserves were being done in 2014, after Gox. It does refer to a, proving your ownership of some crypto assets.
00:19:42.662 - 00:19:52.950, Speaker C: That part is typically quite trivial, and then B, adding up all the depositor liabilities on your exchange or custodian.
00:19:53.022 - 00:20:11.884, Speaker A: So essentially, all the balances that you claim you're showing to your clients, theoretically, all the deposits that haven't been withdraw. But looking at your internal account database and making sure that every balance that's currently being displayed to a customer, you have the cryptographic proof that the actual assets are also there.
00:20:11.964 - 00:20:34.886, Speaker C: Yeah. And the hard part of approved reserve is the liability side. Of course, there's all these merkle tree elements for privacy sake. But, yeah, basically, it's relatively simple conceptually. You have the assets on the one side. That's easy. And then you set up all of the outstanding liabilities, and crucially, you allow your users to verify that they're included in the liability side.
00:20:34.886 - 00:20:41.742, Speaker C: If enough users do it, you don't even strictly need an audit firm. It helps. But if enough users do it, they are the auditors, right?
00:20:41.758 - 00:20:57.476, Speaker A: They'll find that, wait a sec. Like, they'll be in some chat or on a Reddit thread or on Twitter being like, wait a sec. I saw a thousand other people on the exchange share a screenshot that they verified that their assets were inside the merkle tree and provably there, but mine aren't.
00:20:57.580 - 00:21:39.526, Speaker C: So it's like herd immunity. Yeah, it's like herd immunity. If you exclude liabilities, that's how you would cheat a proof reserve, right? You would exclude some liabilities, and if enough users do it, they actually perform the verification. Then you can have very good confidence that the liability set is complete, especially if you include an auditor in the procedure. The auditor looks at your internal database and they ensure that the liability out of station is complete. And so I would say it gives you pretty strong assurances. And luckily, well, now it's not the best circumstances, but it is the most traction I've ever seen for por, by far.
00:21:39.630 - 00:21:56.974, Speaker A: Yeah, I like your point about the herd immunity on the users. What we're saying, too, is that you have the exchange constructs that constructs a giant proof, right? A merkelized proof. And there's a button on your account balance that says verify.
00:21:57.054 - 00:21:57.518, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:21:57.606 - 00:22:07.926, Speaker A: And you're actually cryptographically verifying that your assets are part of that? They're in a branch somewhere of the merkle tree. Correct. And so you could do it on demand, theoretically, the proof of assets part.
00:22:07.990 - 00:22:09.206, Speaker C: You could do it in real time?
00:22:09.270 - 00:22:09.606, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:09.670 - 00:22:12.438, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, it's a little more cumbersome. Of course, maybe they do it on.
00:22:12.446 - 00:22:15.382, Speaker A: A daily basis or something, but there's ways to do it.
00:22:15.438 - 00:22:20.702, Speaker C: Yeah. I could envision a world where we get to real time proof of reserves, which would be awesome.
00:22:20.838 - 00:22:36.902, Speaker A: And so this would have. Would this have helped with FTX? I mean, if what we think happened, happened? Because these weren't. As far as we know, the assumption isn't these were a paper liability that FTX issued to Alameda. It was real assets sent out of the exchange. We think, to Alameda.
00:22:36.958 - 00:22:58.934, Speaker C: Even a proof of assets would have revealed that something was awry. In fact, the on chain analysts of the world know this. FTX was never. He was always very difficult to triangulate their cold storage. Turns out they didn't have any. But most other exchanges, it's actually not that difficult to determine. Well, here's binance's cold storage.
00:22:58.974 - 00:23:07.510, Speaker A: Right? Because you can see the hot wallet. You can see that they keep it around this balance, and periodically, if it gets high, you see where they sweep it to, or if it gets low, you see where they pull it out from.
00:23:07.662 - 00:23:46.240, Speaker C: Most exchanges have a standard, conventional structure for that, and it's easy enough to forensically determine their cold storage. FTX, that was never doable. If they had done a proof of assets or if it was normalized within the industry, then it would have been evident much earlier that something was amiss. We would have seen the funds go to Alameda, assuming that's what happened, and a fuller proof of reserve. Of course, FTX, in their impaired state, they would have never been able to pass a proof of reserve. The way it works is via negativa. The credible firms do the proofs of reserve.
00:23:46.240 - 00:24:12.682, Speaker C: And so hopefully, that's where we get to now. And then the firms that are insolvent or fractionally reserved, they can't pass a por. They don't even attempt it. And so then we know something is wrong because everybody else is doing the proof reserve, and then there's a handful that can't. So Gox was missing coins for years. Quadriga was missing coins for a long time. FTX, we don't know exactly what happens.
00:24:12.682 - 00:24:23.778, Speaker C: There's clearly some missing coins. And so if proof of reserve had been more normalized throughout the industry, those exchanges would have never been able to do a por.
00:24:23.866 - 00:24:24.090, Speaker A: Right.
00:24:24.122 - 00:24:27.258, Speaker C: So that would have been our sign that alert. Something is wrong.
00:24:27.426 - 00:24:33.018, Speaker A: Yeah. That herd immunity is something we need to get to. I think that's why it's so critical.
00:24:33.066 - 00:24:35.020, Speaker C: For even the credible exchanges to do it.
00:24:35.082 - 00:25:11.740, Speaker A: I mean, in some ways, this is a, is a, is a major use case for public blockchains, actually, the fact that digital assets, crypto assets can be cryptographically proven, the control and ownership of them, you could see that it's not just that this would have helped prevent something like an FTX and does add significant safety for both consumers and institutional clients using these types of custodial services. But it's also that this is a story that the traditional financial world can't tell. This is actually a uniquely crypto feature.
00:25:11.852 - 00:25:28.268, Speaker C: It's an incredible strength of the fact that we're using digital bear assets. Crypto assets are provable at a distance. It's trivial for me to prove to a third party that I have a crypto asset. Can't do that with gold. Right. That's why there's a lot of conspiracies around. Is the gold really there?
00:25:28.316 - 00:25:29.764, Speaker A: Is it in Fort Knox, is it not?
00:25:29.844 - 00:25:44.372, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, you just at that point rely institutional credibility for banks. I mean, I assume they have whatever, liquidity or capital, et cetera. I mean, it's heavily regulated. You're relying on the government to doctor.
00:25:44.388 - 00:25:58.212, Speaker A: But also liquidity, for sure. But when you talk about like bank reserve requirements, right. We know they've been reduced to zero in the past. Right. They have a lender of last resort down there in New York and Washington, the Federal Reserve, who can.
00:25:58.308 - 00:26:00.692, Speaker C: We could use one of our ways. Yeah.
00:26:00.708 - 00:26:17.794, Speaker A: And we don't have one, which is, you know, look, again, that's obviously really upsetting situation, but it's the free market at its core. What we want is more transparency among these third party, I'm going to say custodians. But exchanges are also custodians in that sense.
00:26:17.914 - 00:26:52.798, Speaker C: Yeah. I think with this we can achieve an amazing self regulatory measure. So it doesn't have to be top down regulation. I do eventually expect that proof reserve requirements will be written into law in certain jurisdictions, maybe even in the US. But this is something that can be done spontaneously in a bottom up way, which would be incredibly positive for the industry. And I think it wards off later more punishing regulation. That's always been my pitch do this now so that it's not worse when the government comes in after a crisis and tries to regulate you harshly.
00:26:52.886 - 00:27:00.310, Speaker A: There may be other things that we need to get from regulation, but this is one that has direct safety impacts to the positive.
00:27:00.382 - 00:27:24.554, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, the actual implications are very, very significant, and I think there's no excuse now not to do it. Now, will all the exchanges. I heard from an auditor friend that there are 17 exchanges that hit them up and ask them about it. Will they be able to, and I know quite a few have done these informal proofs of asset, which is a good first step. It's certainly not sufficient.
00:27:26.104 - 00:27:29.928, Speaker A: That's like binance and a couple others giving all their addresses to Nansen or whatever.
00:27:30.016 - 00:27:31.672, Speaker C: Yeah, Nansen has some nice dashboards.
00:27:31.728 - 00:27:32.280, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:27:32.352 - 00:27:42.152, Speaker C: That doesn't prove much. Right. Obviously, like, the liability side is essential, but it's a good start. So I do like that that's being normalized.
00:27:42.248 - 00:27:48.784, Speaker A: And Cz did actually tweet. He was calling actually, for a merkelized proof of work standard, so I think he said those words.
00:27:48.864 - 00:28:10.908, Speaker C: Yeah. So CZ is very clearly committed to it. Is binance going to be able to do it? I think on a Twitter space, you said two weeks. I would say there's a 0% chance they're able to do it in two weeks because they have so many assets on the platform, and you have to do this for every asset. There's also not that many audit firms to do it.
00:28:11.076 - 00:28:19.628, Speaker A: Purely an amount of effort, as you're saying, to actually get this done quickly. So you start with what I mean, you said Kraken in the past has done it. They did bitcoin and ETH or something.
00:28:19.716 - 00:28:43.584, Speaker C: So here's the fun history of proof reserves. There's actually a very colorful history went down. Stephane Thomas, of all people, went around helping exchanges do proofs of reserve, which is kind of a weird, crazy little piece of trivia. Kraken did it, I think, in 2014. Ok, coin did it. A smattering of other exchanges. They all stopped.
00:28:43.584 - 00:28:53.512, Speaker C: And then they didn't take the mantle up again until, I think there was one exchange, coin floor that did it. Smaller exchange. They did it for five years straight.
00:28:53.608 - 00:28:55.368, Speaker A: Which was really great shout out.
00:28:55.456 - 00:29:23.436, Speaker C: Yeah. And then in 2021, I believe, Bitmex released one and some code. So that was a great step forward because that's reusable tools. Kraken then redid it, so they kind of sort of came back to proof reserves, which is awesome. Very glad. They've been kind of leading the charge on this. You know what's funny is ok coin, when they did it back in the day, there were actually accusations that they cheated the proof of reserve way back then.
00:29:23.436 - 00:29:35.004, Speaker C: Yep. And there's a now deleted Reddit post accusing Okcoin of cheating their Por. And who was the CTO of OK coin in 2014?
00:29:35.084 - 00:29:36.140, Speaker A: Oh, was it Cz?
00:29:36.212 - 00:29:38.764, Speaker C: None other than CZ. Yeah, none other than CZ.
00:29:38.844 - 00:29:39.508, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:29:39.596 - 00:29:52.206, Speaker C: So he has. He knows he's got a history with Por, so he knows proof reserves. Let's go. So I'm expecting big things. Can binance deliver? I mean, they are the most important institution to do this because they are.
00:29:52.230 - 00:29:53.710, Speaker A: Not regulated and they're the biggest.
00:29:53.782 - 00:29:59.974, Speaker C: They're offshore and they're the biggest. They more than anyone need to do it. It's especially the offshore guys that need to do it.
00:30:00.014 - 00:30:00.594, Speaker A: Right.
00:30:00.934 - 00:30:07.358, Speaker C: It's essential they do it. And I'm not holding my breath, though, because I think it's going to be really, really hard.
00:30:07.446 - 00:30:19.212, Speaker A: At least start with bitcoin and Ethan. Most, according to their addresses, I think their biggest holdings are busd and such. That should be relatively trivial as well.
00:30:19.348 - 00:30:42.764, Speaker C: Yeah. Actually, stablecoins are one space where there's already, I don't know if I would call it a proof reserve necessarily, because the asset is actually treasuries and then the liabilities are the tokens. Tokens on chain. But there's a colorful history now already, I think trust token has been doing these attestations with Armanino.
00:30:42.804 - 00:30:50.582, Speaker A: I believe Armanino is the auditing firm that's been doing most of these. Right. Have they built a special practice on proof of reserve type?
00:30:50.638 - 00:31:00.886, Speaker C: They have, yeah. And they got a lot of flack recently. It's actually kind of threw them under the bus a little bit because they're like, yeah, they're overwhelmed that, you know.
00:31:00.950 - 00:31:05.206, Speaker A: There was some kind of, like, they were on a, like a FTX website or something.
00:31:05.270 - 00:31:19.274, Speaker C: Yeah. So don't work for FTX. Harmonino audited FTX us from 2019 to 2021. They didn't audit FTX International. Now, was FTX us fully clean? Like they might have had issues, too.
00:31:19.314 - 00:31:20.770, Speaker A: Frankly, it's hard to know now.
00:31:20.802 - 00:31:21.866, Speaker C: You know, we don't know, but.
00:31:21.890 - 00:31:22.266, Speaker A: Right.
00:31:22.370 - 00:31:37.010, Speaker C: But I think Armanino is being unfairly maligned here. And they're also the firm that's the most shovel ready from a proof of reserve perspective. So I'm dismayed at seeing the sort of like, Armanino hate.
00:31:37.162 - 00:31:43.512, Speaker A: Well, they're the ones that have done this work already. And this, again, they weren't doing proof of reserves for FTX us.
00:31:43.568 - 00:31:44.024, Speaker C: Right.
00:31:44.144 - 00:32:09.232, Speaker A: Other auditing work they may have done some for. I think it's a really big step. I think when I look at the regulations that have been proposed, whether it's in Lumas chillibrand or this DCCPA or even stablecoin related stuff, there's plenty in these things that would be good for the industry in general. There's also plenty of stuff the industry wants changed. None of them that I am aware of would actually have really made a dent on what happened at FTX.
00:32:09.328 - 00:32:40.378, Speaker C: Yeah. The DCCPA didn't say much about, like, segregating client balances from operating capital or maintaining seniority for depositors in a liquidation situation. Right. Certainly didn't say anything about reserve. It was more about esoteric derivatives, market structure stuff, which this is why I never liked it. It seemed very self serving. It's like, okay, you're expending all this political capital to get weird, hyper specific stuff in place to entrench your regulatory mode.
00:32:40.378 - 00:32:43.046, Speaker C: What about all this other stuff that.
00:32:43.070 - 00:32:46.394, Speaker A: The industry safety should have, consumer protection measures?
00:32:47.334 - 00:33:04.870, Speaker C: Well, I mean, that'll change now. I'm actually quite excited for legislative developments in 2023. I mean, assuming republicans take back the House. Like, I know there's a number of pieces of legislation they've already written, and some of them do pertain to this, to consumer protection.
00:33:04.982 - 00:33:10.444, Speaker A: I think this is just a clear no brainer. I mean, this. It wouldn't have stopped, like you said, it wouldn't have stopped.
00:33:10.534 - 00:33:13.200, Speaker C: Fraud is fraud. No amount of.
00:33:13.232 - 00:33:16.728, Speaker A: But it could have alerted the users to this significantly sooner.
00:33:16.776 - 00:33:21.312, Speaker C: It would have been a canary in the coal mine. Yeah. So, yeah, if someone is intent on committing fraud, they're going to commit fraud.
00:33:21.368 - 00:33:43.038, Speaker A: Yeah. What do you take to this? You know, there's been a lot of people, you know, a lot of bitcoin maximalists, a lot of just general crypto critics who've said, you know, see, like, this is the problem with crypto in one way or another. If it's the bitcoin maximalist, they say, oh, well, if they had. I don't know, I guess if they had been bitcoin, only Sam couldn't have stolen their money. I'm not really sure. But, like, somehow this is a uniquely crypto story. Do you see it that way?
00:33:43.086 - 00:33:58.494, Speaker C: No. Bitcoiners can't. I know. They try to distinguish themselves from the crypto industry. There were a lot of bitcoiners and bitcoin firms that used FTX. So bitcoin was one of the assets that was misappropriated or whatever. Poorly labeled internal account.
00:33:58.534 - 00:34:01.154, Speaker A: Right? Poorly labeled internal account. Hidden.
00:34:01.654 - 00:34:20.024, Speaker C: I understand the desire of bitcoiners to indict the crypto industry with this FTX thing, but they're like. They're part of the crypto industry, right? I mean, most firms that bitcoiners use to get access to bitcoin, those are crypto firms. They do all kinds of stuff. Right.
00:34:20.064 - 00:34:20.336, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:20.400 - 00:34:32.640, Speaker C: You can't be a full purist. I mean, the only way to truly be a purist is to buy your bitcoins on local bitcoins and then, you know, bury them in your backyard and then never transact or do anything.
00:34:32.792 - 00:34:33.080, Speaker A: So.
00:34:33.112 - 00:34:34.800, Speaker C: But that's just not very interesting.
00:34:34.872 - 00:34:44.168, Speaker A: But I agree with your point here on the industry and the sort of on ramps and off ramps and infrastructure obviously all being intertwined in terms of, you know, by coin. It's not, certainly.
00:34:44.256 - 00:34:48.368, Speaker C: And bitcoin is suffering from this thing, too. Yeah. It is not immune in any way.
00:34:48.416 - 00:34:52.472, Speaker A: I mean, you see the block clock behind you? It's got a pretty low number on it for what we're used to see.
00:34:52.528 - 00:34:53.856, Speaker C: I don't like the looks of that.
00:34:54.000 - 00:34:56.004, Speaker B: I'm amazed you got it up here.
00:34:56.464 - 00:35:00.368, Speaker A: Yeah, we were actually having some technical difficulties with the WiFi, getting it online.
00:35:00.416 - 00:35:01.560, Speaker C: I didn't want to start.
00:35:01.712 - 00:35:04.144, Speaker A: Yeah, I didn't want to start the podcast until it had something on it.
00:35:04.184 - 00:35:07.160, Speaker C: The block clock just didn't. It was sympathetic. It didn't want to display the price.
00:35:07.192 - 00:35:21.592, Speaker A: It did not want to. I know our friends at coinkite, by the way, awesome block clock. I don't know. Just. It's. This is the Moscow time that Jack Dorsey had behind him during his congressional testimony, so. But the other point is just that, like, this is just straight up fraud, right? Sec, CFDC regulation.
00:35:21.592 - 00:35:33.736, Speaker A: It didn't stop Bernie Madoff. It didn't stop MF global. It didn't stop Archegos. It didn't stop LTCM. Right. Actual fraud and misappropriation. I mean, wasn't Bernie Madoff, like, the head of Finra.
00:35:33.840 - 00:35:39.048, Speaker C: Yeah. The predecessor to Fenra? Yeah. So, you know Arthur Anderson couldn't stop Enron.
00:35:39.096 - 00:36:15.544, Speaker A: Right, right. I don't. In that way, I don't view this as a uniquely crypto story at all. I think this is an unregulated, opaque organization run by, it turns out, basically, children who, with no board, no governing board of their company, by themselves in a penthouse, basically. And they appear to have misappropriated funds and proof of reserves or any other regulation or transparency measures, not gonna prevent that from happening. But this is one proof of reserves where we could alert.
00:36:15.704 - 00:36:16.216, Speaker C: Correct.
00:36:16.320 - 00:36:37.888, Speaker A: And to your point, if all the good actors in the space are doing it, then you start looking around saying, well, wait a sec, who is not doing it? You say, FTX, why aren't you doing it? Oh, I don't know. It's too technically hard. How can you say that when everyone else is doing it right? And so then that's a giant red flag, and you start to see people not use that exchange. So I think this could meaningfully move the ball forward when it comes to safety in the industry.
00:36:38.016 - 00:37:11.164, Speaker C: It'd be one of the most important developments ever from a self regulatory perspective. This is why I called upon Coinbase to do it. And I know they don't appear to have any imminent plans. When I asked them, they said, well, we're a public company and we're audited. And so just look at our quarterly filings. It's like, that's fine, but that's not very crypto native. You know, like, why don't we take advantage of the innate transparency of blockchain? Look, we get attacked for blockchains being transparent.
00:37:11.164 - 00:37:33.744, Speaker C: This is one of the times when it's actually useful. The fact that it's so transparent. Take advantage of that, guys. Set the tone for the rest of the industry. You improve everybody's prospects if you take a leadership stance, do proof of reserve, and make it something that is totally normalized throughout the industry. So I hope they come around on that, too.
00:37:34.764 - 00:38:01.730, Speaker A: Quick break for our listeners. Our poll last week was, what portion of funds do you think FTX depositors will eventually get back from the exchange? 49% said none of it, 41% said less than 50%, and the rest was negligible. This week, our poll is quite simple. Will Sam Bankman free testify before Congress? Yes or no? That poll is pinned to our profile on Twitter. Go there, vote. Make your voice heard. Now back to the show.
00:38:01.730 - 00:38:10.802, Speaker A: Let's welcome Christine Kim, the queen of the merge, my colleague here at Galaxy Research, into the conversation here with Nick. Welcome, Christine.
00:38:10.938 - 00:38:14.546, Speaker D: Thanks. Hi, Alex. Wow, the merge feels like it was years ago.
00:38:14.610 - 00:38:15.654, Speaker A: It really does.
00:38:16.074 - 00:38:17.930, Speaker D: Those are simpler times.
00:38:18.042 - 00:38:39.030, Speaker A: Actually, we did a podcast two weeks ago, you and I, and we were like, man, pretty slow news week. There was this thing about Alameda's balance sheet. Not so sure. Like, you know what it is like. I guess we'll follow up on that next week. Well, that next week was last week, and, boy, did we follow up on it and did it become big news? Yes. Let's keep the FTX conversation going a little bit.
00:38:39.030 - 00:39:03.884, Speaker A: I saw the House Financial services Committee is seeking to, they're going to do a hearing in December about FTX, etcetera, but supposedly they're in negotiations with the bahamian regulators and I guess Sam Bankman fried to bring him to the US to testify before Congress. What do we think the odds are that Sam banquet fried lands on us soil to test and goes to the Capitol?
00:39:04.584 - 00:39:08.644, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think he'll end up on us soil, but it'll be under different circumstances.
00:39:09.224 - 00:39:11.096, Speaker A: What do you think, Christine? Any chance of it?
00:39:11.200 - 00:39:22.364, Speaker D: I have no idea. I mean, the US government has a lot of sway, so I wouldn't put it past them to force this to happen. And so I don't. He can only hide for so long, right?
00:39:22.704 - 00:39:39.854, Speaker A: I don't know, probably. I mean, the reach of the US government is long and far. I would personally be very surprised if he testifies before Congress. But there will be hearings almost certainly about this issue before Congress.
00:39:40.514 - 00:39:44.178, Speaker D: I think Binance was also on the list of people that they wanted.
00:39:44.266 - 00:40:00.204, Speaker A: I don't know if they were on the list of people they wanted to testify, although maybe they are. They were in the press release of like, the hearing will cover like, FTX, Alameda, like Binance, et cetera or something is what it said, which I thought that was doing binance a bit dirty by including them on that press release, by the way.
00:40:00.324 - 00:40:23.332, Speaker D: Yeah. There was this Financial Times article that was circulating over Twitter where the article had said that a lot of the part of FTX's downfall was because of CZ's tweets. And everyone on Twitter was just ripping on it really hard, saying that this was inaccurate reporting. So lots of controversy, I think.
00:40:23.388 - 00:40:34.212, Speaker C: Yeah. It's like a deliberate attempt to reframe this away from FTX's and Alameda's malfeasance to like, oh, it was actually CZ's fault. It's like CZ just exposed them.
00:40:34.308 - 00:40:34.972, Speaker A: Right?
00:40:35.148 - 00:40:37.164, Speaker C: All he did was make four tweets.
00:40:37.284 - 00:40:37.876, Speaker A: Right?
00:40:38.020 - 00:40:41.220, Speaker C: I mean, and thank goodness he did. I mean, it could have been worse.
00:40:41.252 - 00:41:00.116, Speaker A: What would have gone on longer, perhaps? I mean, I think you can't deny that the CZ's transparency about his actions with the FTT token definitely did dramatically impact sentiment and fears about FTX's solvency. But we know now they weren't solvent.
00:41:00.180 - 00:41:02.164, Speaker C: So they were warranted fears.
00:41:02.284 - 00:41:03.180, Speaker A: Right. Warranted fears.
00:41:03.212 - 00:41:05.508, Speaker C: They did the right thing. He did the right thing.
00:41:05.636 - 00:41:36.670, Speaker A: Okay. So also along these same sort of the same discussion. There were funds last week. So after the, after our podcast aired on Friday, a large amount of funds appeared to have been stolen from FTX. And we didn't know. I think we still don't know who has done this one exchange. Kraken tweeted or their head of security or something tweeted that they actually think they know who it is.
00:41:36.670 - 00:41:55.744, Speaker A: I'm sure they're in contact with whichever law enforcement or whomever they need to be about that. But we don't know what happened here. There's lots of speculation that it could be an insider attack. It's really hard to know. You think about it like, all these FTX employees are gone. Maybe their security team is gone. This is a solid target in that way.
00:41:55.744 - 00:42:16.852, Speaker A: So I don't want to speculate who it could be, but we will say that apparently by total ETH held. Now, this hacker who immediately converted everything they stole into native ETH, apparently is the 35th. Their account on Ethan, on Ethereum is the 35th wealthiest Ethereum holder in the world.
00:42:17.028 - 00:42:19.956, Speaker C: Were they one of the largest holders before the hack?
00:42:20.020 - 00:42:20.484, Speaker A: No.
00:42:20.604 - 00:42:21.148, Speaker C: Okay.
00:42:21.236 - 00:42:21.740, Speaker A: No, no.
00:42:21.812 - 00:42:22.944, Speaker C: Nouveau riche.
00:42:23.364 - 00:42:30.140, Speaker A: Nouveau riche, yeah. But Christine, you were saying about that list. Yeah.
00:42:30.172 - 00:43:20.434, Speaker D: The top account on that list is the Ethereum deposit contract. So basically all staked ETH. The reason why the top holder is the top holder is because everyone just uses that contract to stake ETH on the beacon chain. And there are several other accounts on that list in the top ten. I'm pretty sure that the majority of the top ten are accounts held by exchanges like publicly labeled accounts or smart contract accounts. But this is one of the few that's an externally owned account, basically operated by a user, not by a smart contract or a publicly identified entity. And so this kind of makes me think a little bit to the Dow hack of 2016 about one of the rationales of doing an irregular state change was that we didn't want a large ETH holder to be this, to be a criminal.
00:43:20.434 - 00:43:33.046, Speaker D: But look where we are today, and it's still happened. Obviously, there's not going to be an irregular state change on Ethereum, but that fear has manifested one of the largest ETH holders.
00:43:33.150 - 00:43:39.014, Speaker A: Is that obvious? Regular state change, also known as taking funds from an account in a hard fork?
00:43:39.594 - 00:43:40.114, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:43:40.194 - 00:43:50.850, Speaker A: Yeah. It's funny that it's certain to not happen, though. I mean, I. I think it. I admit, if it's much less likely to occur. I mean, it didn't happen with the parity bug, right? It didn't happen plenty of other times. It could have happened.
00:43:50.850 - 00:43:54.934, Speaker A: But, like, are we certain that we won't have an irregular state change on ETH?
00:43:55.274 - 00:44:00.122, Speaker D: That's. That's a dangerous question. I mean, I think Ethereum is. Is decentralized.
00:44:00.178 - 00:44:00.930, Speaker A: You're certain?
00:44:01.082 - 00:44:02.642, Speaker D: I think. I'm certain, yeah.
00:44:02.698 - 00:44:05.558, Speaker C: Yeah. The odds of that are almost zero.
00:44:05.666 - 00:44:06.334, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:44:06.494 - 00:44:16.718, Speaker C: It's interesting to see these irregular state changes happening on other chains that are impacted by FTX. Like, I think serum, for instance, was forking out.
00:44:16.806 - 00:44:22.742, Speaker A: That's right. Serum's what a Dex on Solana, that FTX, did they even build it?
00:44:22.878 - 00:44:26.830, Speaker C: Yeah, they basically did. And they were marking it in the billions as far as an asset.
00:44:26.862 - 00:44:28.998, Speaker A: On their back, they held SRM token.
00:44:29.126 - 00:44:31.638, Speaker C: But the float was incredibly low.
00:44:31.686 - 00:44:32.710, Speaker A: Was it like 50 million?
00:44:32.782 - 00:44:50.594, Speaker C: This whole thing vindicates the kind of, like, subset of people that were like, forget about market cap, guys. Market cap is a garbage metric. Look at free flow, look at liquid, look at real liquidity measures. So I think we can put the market cap infatuation behind us because that was part of the scheme.
00:44:50.974 - 00:44:51.710, Speaker A: That's true.
00:44:51.822 - 00:45:00.310, Speaker C: Representing themselves as extra solvent based on these totally liquid assets. But, yeah, I think serum is now, or two days ago, did some kind of fork.
00:45:00.382 - 00:45:25.744, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't remember the exact details. And I think the issue is something about, like, the upgrade admin keys to this defi application were held at FTX. So they were forking in order to remove those keys, which, to be clear, sounds like a very prudent. If that's. If I'm describing the issue correctly, then that sounds quite prudent to do. But also, I wonder if they were going to remove his ownership.
00:45:25.824 - 00:45:32.804, Speaker C: Yeah, by doing that, I think they might have forked out. So do they just eliminate a big.
00:45:32.844 - 00:45:52.956, Speaker A: Piece of what creditors perhaps recoverable sum? Very bizarre. Speaking of recoverable sums, Sam Aikman Free donated a lot of money around Washington. I don't know how bankruptcy rules work here, but if some of that was within a clawback period, is that even possible to be clawed back?
00:45:53.060 - 00:45:56.188, Speaker C: I think we're all going to become experts at bankruptcy.
00:45:56.236 - 00:45:57.464, Speaker A: Bankruptcy clawback.
00:45:58.274 - 00:46:10.314, Speaker C: I mean, I think there's also fears or concerns that people that withdrew funds from the exchange at the right of the death will also themselves maybe have that clawed back.
00:46:10.474 - 00:46:12.386, Speaker A: The political donations lot, we don't know.
00:46:12.450 - 00:46:21.938, Speaker C: I think they should give them back the political donations even if they're not legally mandated, because it's clear now that was theft from the users.
00:46:21.986 - 00:46:30.548, Speaker A: Well, hey, we don't know if it was theft, but we do know that it was part of the -8 billion hidden, poorly labeled internal fiat account.
00:46:30.636 - 00:46:33.116, Speaker C: Those are illegitimate donations.
00:46:33.260 - 00:46:34.676, Speaker A: I'm never gonna stop laughing about that.
00:46:34.740 - 00:46:56.944, Speaker C: If like a mobster, you know, to normalize themselves, uses their racketeering money to give it to local politicians. Those politicians do not accept the money. It's blood money. Right? This is the same, I think this is the proceeds from like some, basically a fraud as far as I can tell. So I don't know how anybody that received those donations can hang on to them.
00:46:57.394 - 00:47:22.998, Speaker A: Let's move on. Christine, you've been following, you're well known for following the Ethereum development community. We've talked a lot about, this is sort of tangential. I think we wrap up our FTX conversation here, but what is going on now? They've been meeting again. Remember the developers took a bit of a vacation following the merge, which was way back in September. What's now on the agenda for the developers?
00:47:23.146 - 00:47:32.038, Speaker D: The agenda is definitely focused primarily on Shanghai, the next upgrade. I mean, that's always going to be the focus. It's just what's the next thing to change about the protocol?
00:47:32.126 - 00:47:39.954, Speaker A: What's the next upgrade? Right? We were joking, like, is there a time when like Vitalik comes out and like waves a flag and he's like, we're all done. Everybody pack it up. Like, protocol's ossified.
00:47:40.454 - 00:47:41.534, Speaker C: We did it.
00:47:41.694 - 00:47:43.462, Speaker A: We did it. Congratulations, guys.
00:47:43.558 - 00:47:44.214, Speaker D: Can you imagine?
00:47:44.254 - 00:47:53.388, Speaker A: And I think the consensus and what you said too is, no, absolutely not. They'll never stop upgrading. But anyway, the next upgrade. So what is in the next upgrade now? What's it look like?
00:47:53.476 - 00:49:19.234, Speaker D: So I think developers had really come together about what the core of Shanghai should look like during their first meeting back. And it was at a minimum staked ETH withdrawals and then a couple of other minor optimizations and improvements to the network. But lately, so this week in particular, there's been quite a lot of concern, I think, on Twitter about when exactly staked ETH withdrawals would be enabled in Shanghai, even though it has been confirmed that it's going to go into the next upgrade, mainly because the rest of Shanghai hasn't been decided. So even though we know staked ETH is going to go into Shanghai, let's just say developers agree that three or four other major code changes should be included into that upgrade. Then the timeline for Shanghai gets delayed to next fall or even potentially like 2024 in the worst case. And so the concern is that you made a decision now, but almost like the more important decision is like, what else is going into Shanghai. And can we please figure that out soon so that people have some certainty around, like, is it gonna be next summer, is it gonna be as early as, like next February if they only do staked ETH withdrawals and nothing else into that upgrade? And so I think that's become quite contentious.
00:49:19.234 - 00:50:10.876, Speaker D: I think the three other major changes that are being discussed is, of course, EIP 4844, the scalability upgrade for Ethereum. That is going to require lots of research and development. The second one is EOF implementation. It's basically an upgrade, a new version of the Ethereum virtual machine that would. Yeah, definitely the full implementation of EOF does. It would take a lot of effort. And then the third one is BLS signatures, not as heavy of a lift, but it just introduces a new, more modern cryptographic scheme into Ethereum and allows people to enable a lot more use cases, because Ethereum has a, as a pretty outdated smart contract language, which limits the functionality of what you can do.
00:50:10.876 - 00:50:39.184, Speaker D: So if you just start to include new cryptographic signature schemes like the BLS one, a lot more you can enable. So there's a few others too. But that has been really the focus of the discussion. Last week's meeting was pretty contentious. Lots of debate and discussion going into, you know, what else do we include into Shanghai? And tomorrow there's going to be a meeting again to discuss next steps.
00:50:39.964 - 00:50:51.300, Speaker A: So it's really around timing for Shanghai, which is mostly impacted by what other things are going to go in there. Right? Yeah, but that is, I mean, they push staked ETH withdrawals until 2024.
00:50:51.492 - 00:51:01.524, Speaker D: Well, 2024 mainly for EIP 4844, like the estimation of some people as EIP 4844 is going to take until 2024 and it's included in chancy.
00:51:01.564 - 00:51:17.436, Speaker A: Correct. Shanghai is there far delay. But I mean, that will cause an uproar, I think. And by the way, perhaps rightly so, because that's a lot longer than I think a lot of staked ETH depositors, beacon chain depositors, let alone thought that they would have to wait.
00:51:17.620 - 00:51:22.180, Speaker C: I saw a lot of criticism about that on Twitter.
00:51:22.252 - 00:51:28.340, Speaker A: So what are the odds that they blow it out and they do. Shanghai is just stake ETH withdrawals and they move everything else to a next.
00:51:28.372 - 00:51:50.632, Speaker D: Upgrade, split it into two. So the first meeting, back where they had agreed staked ETH withdrawals was going into Shanghai. There was a lot of consensus around, let's not do two upgrades, let's just keep it into one. Because the amount of testing, energy and governance process to even do a small upgrade is the exact same as a big upgrade.
00:51:50.688 - 00:51:51.008, Speaker C: Totally.
00:51:51.056 - 00:52:08.542, Speaker D: So why not just shove everything into a big one? So that was the consensus. But I think that consensus has started to become far more unraveled through subsequent ratings because of this understanding that Shanghai might become considerably delayed because of how big they want to make it.
00:52:08.678 - 00:52:58.322, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, that would play right into a lot of criticism about that Ethereum developers receive from other networks, from bitcoiners about the staked ETH being locked. Right. But also just, gosh, that could be a long time. I mean, those are important stuff they want, whether it's dank, sharding stuff or whatever else, the sort of core ETH 2.0 ideas that on scalability that we're waiting for on Ethereum. But like, I mean, you know, if you have to do two governance processes, two testing processes, two exchange and stakeholder upgrade processes, well, yeah, that's hard if it's in six month period, but if they're going to delay the thing a year and a half, what they still need to do once, it's like, what's going to do nothing. It would be easy for them to do that process once for this and then take another eight months, eight or nine.
00:52:58.322 - 00:53:09.614, Speaker A: It kind of seems kind of ridiculous to me, actually. I doubt that consensus can hold, but I'm not the, I don't follow the developer community closely on Ethereum at all, so I defer to you on this.
00:53:10.034 - 00:53:38.918, Speaker D: Yeah, you would think that it's a little simpler, but I think it's hard when for the longest time it was, let's try and keep the upgrades as bare bones as possible. But it's like, what is the straw that's gonna break the camel's back? You always think that one additional code change won't actually delay the process that much. And these are upgrades that have been in the pipeline for several years, so BLS signatures, so they don't wanna be.
00:53:38.926 - 00:53:39.814, Speaker A: Delayed either, to be honest.
00:53:39.854 - 00:54:32.186, Speaker D: Exactly. And so I really do think that it's about priorities, like how much does the Ethereum community need scalability now, need greater censorship, resistance, privacy guarantees now? And how do those compete with the staked ETH withdrawal priority, which really is for the benefit of people who had deposited way back when in 2020? And just being true to that promise, which surprisingly, I'm not sure if this is 100% true, but I saw on Twitter that. But on the Ethereum foundation website, like ethereum.org comma, it used to say that staked ETH withdrawals would be enabled six to twelve months after the merge and they took that down from the website, which I think is why there's so much controversy on Twitter this week because of that change on the website.
00:54:32.210 - 00:54:50.616, Speaker A: Oh, specifically website change. Let's talk briefly about Defi. There's been a lot of conversation that FTX wasn't defi. Right. And you know, who, who did Alameda pay off first? Right. They paid compound, they paid gearbox, they paid apricadabra. We saw the same thing with Celsius.
00:54:50.616 - 00:55:10.120, Speaker A: They paid down their Defi debts first. I think the automated, transparent, rigid nature of smart contract enabled, decentralized finance clearly puts it at the top of the creditor stack, basically, which I think is a very interesting positive. Right. You can't call up the smart contract and say, hey, bro, give me another day, bro.
00:55:10.152 - 00:55:11.560, Speaker C: I just need four, bro.
00:55:11.672 - 00:55:24.008, Speaker A: Please, dog, don't please, bro. Or, you know, that meme. So that I think that's, you know, in a lot of ways has really shined through these credit crunches. What are you seeing in the Defi world over the last week or so?
00:55:24.136 - 00:55:34.968, Speaker D: Lots more on chain activity, partially, of course, because people are scared and they want to pull their assets off of exchanges, off of everything or decentralized cold storage, baby.
00:55:35.056 - 00:55:38.738, Speaker A: Ledger said that their, their sales were at an all time high. They're hardware wallet sales.
00:55:38.856 - 00:55:54.638, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. Lots of more focus and interest in self custodying now more than ever. But one of the headlines that got my attention was that Uniswap is now the second largest, has like the second largest trade volume for trading ETH, even ahead of Coinbase.
00:55:54.726 - 00:55:56.726, Speaker A: Wow. Behind binance, I assume.
00:55:56.870 - 00:55:59.078, Speaker D: No, not, I'm saying finance hash. Oh, yes.
00:55:59.126 - 00:56:01.230, Speaker A: Finance has number one, uniswap number two. Wow.
00:56:01.302 - 00:56:38.594, Speaker D: Yeah. Which I thought was like pretty big. And then also DyDX seeing like a 60% jump in their trading volumes. And this, of course, is all playing so nicely into Ethereum's tokenomics, which after the merge is far more sensitive to on chain activity than it was before. So for the first time, we're seeing, I think it was like the beginning of this crisis. So, like about two weeks ago, we saw for the first time, like the contraction of total ETH supply around 6000 ETH. We're basically, since the merge, like 6000 ETH smaller in terms of total supply.
00:56:39.094 - 00:56:41.750, Speaker A: Which I think that's the IP 1559. Right.
00:56:41.782 - 00:56:44.294, Speaker D: Which in addition with the merge, because.
00:56:44.334 - 00:56:53.390, Speaker A: Issuance has gone down, and with merge's overall reduction in issuance, that's transactional activity resulting in higher base fees, which get burned.
00:56:53.542 - 00:57:19.994, Speaker D: Yes. And now that ETH isn't being issued now is being issued at a fraction of what it was before the merge. We're really starting to see Ethereum's tokenomics design work and play out, which has been really encouraging to see. I feel like that's been one of the positives, testing out the resilience of Defi protocols and also Ethereum's tokenomics after the merge, and both have been incredibly strong through this.
00:57:21.174 - 00:57:34.380, Speaker A: Let's wrap it up here. Thank you, Christine. What do you think, both of you? What's on the near term horizon? And Nick, hold on. Actually, you're in here in New York, by the way, which is great. I thought you were a Miami guy. What are you doing up here?
00:57:34.532 - 00:57:40.804, Speaker C: I actually came to New York for a concert. Magdalena Bay. Magdalena Bay band. Very much recommend them.
00:57:40.884 - 00:57:41.492, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:57:41.628 - 00:57:43.132, Speaker C: Amazing serendipity that I'm here.
00:57:43.188 - 00:57:45.732, Speaker A: You're heading back to Miami soon or are you going elsewhere?
00:57:45.788 - 00:57:47.612, Speaker C: I'll be in Texas for the blockchain summit.
00:57:47.668 - 00:57:49.196, Speaker A: Oh, the Texas blockchain summit.
00:57:49.220 - 00:57:57.418, Speaker C: Last one of the year. Yeah. Long, long year of conferences yet. That's a great one, actually. So really looking forward to conversations with policymakers. There's.
00:57:57.436 - 00:58:01.750, Speaker A: Oh, wow. Yeah. And that's the one. That was it. Ted Cruz and people were asking last.
00:58:01.782 - 00:58:04.358, Speaker C: Year, I think he'll be here. There again. Yeah.
00:58:04.526 - 00:58:08.150, Speaker A: So is it a very bitcoin mining focused conference or is it sort of everything?
00:58:08.262 - 00:58:28.426, Speaker C: Yeah. Mining features have certainly very heavily. It's going to be an atmosphere of doom and gloom. The miners are very distressed right now. I mean, that was kind of the big story of maybe three weeks ago. Was the miners suffering overshadowed now by other events, but the mining sector is still very much screwed.
00:58:28.530 - 00:58:34.458, Speaker A: Yep. Tough to hear. I mean, I think they're going to come out of it some way. Hash rate's still at an all time high.
00:58:34.626 - 00:59:01.084, Speaker C: Yeah. So, basically, I think the equilibrium will be found. When hash rate falls, profitability increases. So you will get that negative feedback loop to arrest the insolvencies. But I think there will have to be more minor failures. First, most miners are just not operating profitably right now. Electricity prices, hash rate increasing, and bitcoin price falling is a triple whammy.
