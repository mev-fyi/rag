00:00:01.160 - 00:00:28.120, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. I'm Mike Novogratz, and this is next with Novo. I mean, the first thing I want to say is that, hey, thanks for coming on next with Novo. The second thing I want to say is every time I see with your big smile on your face, all five foot eleven inches tall, with not the physique of Brock Lesnar, I just always wonder how you could get in the ring and smash all those big guys.
00:00:28.272 - 00:00:59.102, Speaker B: I'm fearless, man. It's one of the things, Mike, and you know that in wrestling, we had to go into some really intense situations, right? Olympics semifinals is probably the scariest thing that you're ever going to experience outside of wrestling for the gold medal, and I had to go through that and then wrestle for medal in the Olympic games. Those are the things that make a man scared. Standing across an octagon from another man and having to fight, to me, that was always just fun.
00:00:59.278 - 00:01:28.814, Speaker A: That's so interesting. Yeah. Like, you know, I used to tell a story about, I got a lot of silver medals and never any gold medals, and I'm thinking about you. You lost to Cale Sanderson, maybe one of the greatest three wrestlers in american history, in the NCAA finals. You lost to Gonzaleva, who's maybe one of the best Russians, at least the top five in his era, you know, in the Olympic semis. So what did you learn from losing?
00:01:29.154 - 00:01:58.934, Speaker B: You know, honestly, man, I've been. I've been in. Mike, you know, I've always said this to people. I said the story of my career was always that I fought in, wrestled against these greats, right? Kale Sanderson to Hajimura to Salof to John Jones to stipe Mioce. Right? It was me constantly fighting these and competing against these guys that were all time legends. Well, here's the issue. They don't just give me those chances.
00:01:58.934 - 00:02:32.497, Speaker B: I always earned the right to compete against the absolute best. And sure, I came up short, but it was like I did things well enough to put myself in position to compete against those greats. And honestly, if you fall victim to losing and not accomplishing the things that you want, then that becomes who you are. So you don't lose. You get another chance to learn. I know it might sound a little bit cliche, but you get a chance to learn. And I learned in every single loss from, you know, the Olympic games.
00:02:32.497 - 00:02:57.404, Speaker B: I'm sorry. From the NCAA tournament going from being aa run up to making two Olympic teams. So I learned from that being in the Olympics and losing and getting fourth place to go in and becoming a world champion. I learned from that in mixed martial arts, losing the Jones, learning in that loss to become one of the greatest fighters of all time. So it's not. It's not losing. It's just getting more chances to learn and build and be better from those losses.
00:02:58.464 - 00:03:22.214, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I've lost. I've probably lost a lot more than you have in life. And so I've given that speech about learning from losing, but I was thinking about it like, so what was your great win when you finally became UFC champ? What did that feel like? Did it feel like vindication, all the hard work, or was it just. You know what? It's another good day at the office. I'm going to have a big smile on my face.
00:03:22.514 - 00:03:55.174, Speaker B: Great, Mike, you know, having those wins, right. I won 22 times over the course of my career, only had 25 fights, so winning always felt great. Right. Obviously, the money that came along with it, it's much different from what we were used to, but it was always great. But I remember when I beat Anthony Johnson, we were driving home because I booked the flights. For some reason, I booked the flights. I was never good at booking the flight, so it was memorial day weekend.
00:03:55.174 - 00:04:32.606, Speaker B: I booked the flights. Me, Selena, and the kids, we're driving home from Vegas, and we got this new belt. In the whole time, I just kept thinking to myself, like, I finally did it, you know, like. But there was always a bit of a. There was always a bit of a underlying question as to whether or not I was the champion because of the Jones Snake, right. He was in trouble, so I was getting the belt, but ultimately, I was beating who was in front of me, and I held that belt for years, but I think it was the stipe Miocic fight when I became the double champion, that was the one that you just feel like the king of the world, right? Because it was only. Nobody had done it before.
00:04:32.606 - 00:04:35.110, Speaker B: Like, it was me and Conor McGregor, and.
00:04:35.262 - 00:04:36.634, Speaker A: And he's a big dude.
00:04:37.174 - 00:04:53.002, Speaker B: Dude. He's a big dude. He was bigger the first time we fought, but we. You're the king of the world on that night, Mike. And it was just. It was phenomenal. And then to go to New York City as the champion to fight Derrick Lewis headlined Madison Square Garden.
00:04:53.002 - 00:04:56.482, Speaker B: I mean, I had been there in 2003 for the world championships.
00:04:56.538 - 00:04:56.906, Speaker A: Yep.
00:04:56.970 - 00:05:17.674, Speaker B: And was fifth, so I had, you know, it was a culmination of an entire career. You know, there's a girl that works at the garden. Her name is Jennifer. Very nice lady. Every time I go now, since I've had mine there to give me something. They gave me golf balls that said Madison Square last time. But when she walked in to my fight with Derek Lewis, Mike, it was.
00:05:17.674 - 00:05:37.704, Speaker B: She had a photo, and it was said Daniel Cormier, 15 years of Madison Square garden history, and it was a picture on the left of me wrestling in the world championships in zero three. And it was me getting ready to fight in the elevator in Madison Square in 2018. So just. It came full circle, man, and I'm lucky.
00:05:38.164 - 00:05:40.428, Speaker A: Would you fight in Buffalo? I'm trying to remember.
00:05:40.556 - 00:05:43.572, Speaker B: I did. I fought Anthony Johnson in Buffalo, right?
00:05:43.628 - 00:05:44.494, Speaker A: Anthony Johnson.
00:05:44.604 - 00:05:49.834, Speaker B: Anthony Johnson. I mean, Buffalo was shit. I'm just gonna be honest with you. Buffalo was shit compared to New York City.
00:05:49.914 - 00:05:57.658, Speaker A: I know, but I remember. I remember you forgot your jock strap. And I was with. I was with Dave Esposito.
00:05:57.746 - 00:05:58.034, Speaker B: Yes.
00:05:58.074 - 00:06:04.610, Speaker A: And we drove around New York to the jockstrap store and flew it up to you, and I was like, you guys bought me.
00:06:04.642 - 00:06:06.658, Speaker B: Remember? You guys bought me that jock from New York City.
00:06:06.746 - 00:06:08.530, Speaker A: That's what I had no cup.
00:06:08.602 - 00:06:15.828, Speaker B: I had no cup. About to go fight for the world championship, and here comes my boys down from New York City with a. With a cup for me to wear. That's crazy.
00:06:15.916 - 00:06:19.612, Speaker A: That was fun. I mean, it was fun for us, but it wasn't Madison Square Garden.
00:06:19.788 - 00:06:26.108, Speaker B: It was. It was Buffalo. Buffalo shit, though, man. I don't know. I don't know if you ever go to Buffalo. Buffalo ain't fun.
00:06:26.236 - 00:06:45.374, Speaker A: Yeah. Just. We just had that one night. Trust me. So, you know, listen, one of the things you've done really well, better than most, is transition from fighter to. To second career to personality to kind of beloved spokesman. How did that start?
00:06:46.954 - 00:07:05.254, Speaker B: Um, there was a guy named Kieran Portley that used to work at ESPN. He works now down at CB's. And he just, like. I don't know what it was, Mike. He just had this interest in me as a. As a tv personality. And so I remember I was in Los Angeles once, and he was going to have me host a show called MMA.
00:07:05.254 - 00:07:23.830, Speaker B: I think it was MmA live on ESPN. And so I had to go buy a suit. I went and bought this big brown suit at fashion show mall or something like that in Los Angeles. Or maybe it was like, just that. That road where they make stuff. I buy this big suit, I go up there with my suit. Suit size is too big.
00:07:23.830 - 00:08:13.740, Speaker B: And then that was kind of the start of it. That guy, Kieran Portland continued to press the UFC to give me an opportunity, and then once they gave me an opportunity. I was able to turn it into Fox and then now ESPN, and, um, the more time, the more reps I got, the better, right? The better I got at doing it. I always say to people, they didn't even say this to me, you know, a couple weeks ago, he goes, for a guy, first year outside of the octagon, he goes, I don't know if anybody's had a better second part start as you have. And honestly, some of the calls that I'm fielding and the way that this year has started, it seems like it's going to be even bigger in year number two. So I'm excited, Novo, and I'm pumped about all the things that seem to be on the horizon. Hell, I watched the Super bowl with Mike Tyson, you know, and that's like a dream come true for me.
00:08:13.740 - 00:08:18.304, Speaker B: You know, I got to ask him every question that I've ever wanted to ask him since I was a kid.
00:08:19.204 - 00:08:22.044, Speaker A: How is Tyson these days? He seems to be great.
00:08:22.164 - 00:08:46.740, Speaker B: He's doing really well, right? Like, his. His weed form is like the biggest weed form in the entire country, right? The guy's got a ton of the money again, and. But he's like, he's happy, man. Like, we made jokes and we talked about things that if you talk to Mike Tyson about those two before, Mike Tyson might have punched you in the face. But I think he's in such a great place, like, in his life now that he just jokes. I mean, he's just. Dude, he's.
00:08:46.740 - 00:09:00.574, Speaker B: He has this. This air about him that is unmatched by anyone else that I've ever been around. First time I spent that much time with him, Mike. But he was. I would do anything on tv with Mike Tyson going forward.
00:09:00.654 - 00:09:05.674, Speaker A: That's some funny. Well, he's about the only other champ, like, heavyweight champ that's as small as you.
00:09:06.374 - 00:09:16.486, Speaker B: I feel tall. I was like. I was like, wow, Mike Tyson actually makes me feel tall. But Mike was stoned out of his mind. He smoked eight blunts over the course of one super Bowl.
00:09:16.590 - 00:09:18.110, Speaker A: I was like, what the hell is.
00:09:18.142 - 00:09:19.434, Speaker B: Going on with Tyson?
00:09:21.594 - 00:09:22.962, Speaker A: Living his best life, I guess.
00:09:23.018 - 00:09:24.454, Speaker B: Living his best life.
00:09:24.754 - 00:09:27.346, Speaker A: Hey, looks like you got to be happy for the guy. He went through hell.
00:09:27.450 - 00:09:35.250, Speaker B: He went through hell. And he talks. He talks openly about it. I was a junkie. I was on drugs. I lost everything. And he's like, now I'm happy.
00:09:35.250 - 00:10:01.276, Speaker B: You know, it's a great, you know. You know, you say living his best life, I gotta tell you, man, you are living your best life, because the other day I see you at Super bowl, you would like one of those young rappers. I see you in New Orleans and, you know, for Mardi Gras, you with other rappers, and we were talking, me and all the boys, they're like, Mike Novogratz is living every urban kid's dream. You're hanging out with all the cool rappers. What is going on, Novak?
00:10:01.300 - 00:10:26.830, Speaker A: You know, the hip hop guys like crypto, and I've met them through a few friends. And listen, I, when I think about black America, right, the hip hop guys are very influential. And part of, you know, wanted to give back is trying to give some just simple financial education. Like, we don't educate our kids. We don't educate them, period. But we certainly don't financially educate them.
00:10:26.862 - 00:10:27.270, Speaker B: No.
00:10:27.382 - 00:10:37.230, Speaker A: And so I've used their platforms a few times to go on and talk to their fan bases, and, and it's fun. I've gotten to know little Yachty and, you know, a boogie and two scenes.
00:10:37.262 - 00:10:52.624, Speaker B: I was like, look at this guy right here. Also, what you do, what you guys are doing at mortgage statement, that's tremendous. Like, you know, ever since I met you way back in 2008, you guys have had a real desire to help, and it's like, really showing now.
00:10:53.004 - 00:10:55.948, Speaker A: So let's talk a little bit about wrestling. So you.
00:10:55.996 - 00:11:01.740, Speaker B: Well, first off, before, I also saw you at my boy Habib show, Eagle. How was that one? How was that?
00:11:01.852 - 00:11:16.834, Speaker A: I met Habib in, in Saudi Arabia. Yeah. And first I met him, and that's when we called you. And the next day, I saw him again. He said, you know, I could tell you wanted to get hands on me. You know, he was telling his friend, he's a wrestler.
00:11:16.874 - 00:11:17.066, Speaker B: He's.
00:11:17.090 - 00:11:29.282, Speaker A: This guy was a wrestler. He wanted to get his hands on me, and I actually did want to get my hands on him just to see how tough he was. And so then I started pushing him around a little bit. He was funny. I liked him. He loves wrestling. He loves fighting.
00:11:29.282 - 00:11:35.292, Speaker A: He's got a big personality. And so his show he put together, I went to it because he invited me. It was pretty damn good.
00:11:35.428 - 00:11:45.704, Speaker B: It was good invite only. He told me that he goes DC, this guy Novogratz, he goes, this guy love wrestling. All he talk about wrestling, dude. He loves it. He's the best. Wrestling's the best.
00:11:46.164 - 00:11:52.012, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw, I saw Cejudo down there as well. His unm, they're not many two time are two belt champions.
00:11:52.148 - 00:11:53.780, Speaker B: Yeah, I know. We've done well, right?
00:11:53.812 - 00:12:02.022, Speaker A: These wrestlers, wrestler, I like to tell the story. We were at once a hudo fought. Who's the little guy?
00:12:02.118 - 00:12:03.102, Speaker B: Demetrius Johnson.
00:12:03.198 - 00:12:33.282, Speaker A: Demetrius Johnson. The first time I'm in Las Vegas, I'd won a bunch of money gambling, and I convinced my friend we should take all our money and put it on Cejudo. It was a four to one underdog, and I thought it was easy to put a bet on in Vegas. It isn't, especially on the undercards of USC fight. So we had a march to five different casinos to get our $20,000 bet each. So we were going to win $80,000 when Henry wins. And I tried to call you earlier, and when I finally got in touch, we'd already put the bet on.
00:12:33.282 - 00:12:46.214, Speaker A: He was like, you said, geez, I hope he didn't bet too much. And I was like, we're in trouble. We're in trouble. And then when I had the walkout videos, my friend looked at me and he's like, dude, I'm like, sorry.
00:12:48.074 - 00:12:48.362, Speaker B: But.
00:12:48.378 - 00:12:51.130, Speaker A: I give Henry credit. He came back and beat the guy that second fight.
00:12:51.162 - 00:12:56.312, Speaker B: He's a man, an absolute winner. And it started transitioning to his coaching career, too. Dude's a winner.
00:12:56.448 - 00:13:05.524, Speaker A: We would have saved $40,000 if we had gotten to you earlier. So talk about growing up in Lafayette.
00:13:06.184 - 00:13:06.944, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:07.104 - 00:13:17.352, Speaker A: You know, and your life as a kid. I know you lost your parents at one point. You know what? Wasn't all flowers and.
00:13:17.488 - 00:13:28.772, Speaker B: No, it was. Right. It was difficult. Right. But I think in those, in those, in the journey is where the person's, like, forged. Right. So deal with the loss of my dad and.
00:13:28.772 - 00:14:03.980, Speaker B: And then just the hardships of growing up down there was what really formed who you become. Right. And obviously, there are good things about you, there are bad things about you, but it allows for you to work hard. Like my dad, my stepdad, who became my dad, my father taught me hard work, right. And from the moment I learned, by watching him have multiple jobs, I learned to work hard and commit myself to something. And hopefully we're passing that same thing on to my children, right. Because my children now don't live the life that I live.
00:14:03.980 - 00:14:27.302, Speaker B: They don't deal with the struggles that I dealt with. But I know that in those struggles, I learned a lot of lessons. I always tell people, growing up in Louisiana was hard, right? We didn't have much. But the one thing that you can never have enough of is people that love you. And that's one thing. I was surrounded by a ton of love by my family. And they say it takes a village to raise a champion, and I definitely had a village.
00:14:27.478 - 00:14:30.874, Speaker A: Do you still have people down there? Do you still go down there?
00:14:31.254 - 00:14:41.774, Speaker B: My whole family's still down in Lafayette. Right. My mom is there. She's older now. My stepdad just passed away in 2019. It was. It was a horrible time for our family.
00:14:41.774 - 00:14:48.062, Speaker B: But I think, again, the lessons that he taught us stays with us, and you can see it in all of us.
00:14:48.158 - 00:14:54.302, Speaker A: Well, you know, I bought. Built this house or bought this house in New Orleans. We're gonna have to get you down there for a Louisiana reunion.
00:14:54.478 - 00:14:56.086, Speaker B: Are you in New Orleans now?
00:14:56.190 - 00:15:17.012, Speaker A: I have no, I'm in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Okay. I came out to try to ski, but there's not such great snow. But, yeah, we need to have a little Louisiana. We'll talk about mentors. So you had your stepfather who taught you a lot. You end up transferring to Oklahoma State with one of the toughest son of a bitches and.
00:15:17.012 - 00:15:22.676, Speaker A: And greatest wrestlers coaching John Smith. Did he have an impact on you?
00:15:22.780 - 00:15:42.472, Speaker B: Oh, man, so much, right? I've been lucky, man. You know, even when I made my first world team, noble in 2003, I'm in the middle of a two out of three match with Dean Morrison, who is one of the toughest human beings walking God's green earth. I lose match one. I'm the champ. I'm supposed to go. I lose match one. I go back to the back and I'm sulky.
00:15:42.472 - 00:16:24.048, Speaker B: I'm ready to lick my wounds and kind of pack it in. This was two months after I lost my three month old daughter, and I'm ready to lick my wounds. And I walk to the back of the Fargo dome, noble. And I look up and there's John Smith, Kenny Monday, Kendall Cross, and Frickin Mark branch. And they tell me, hey, it feels bad right now, but it'll be a lot worse if you don't go get the job done. Ultimately, having those types of people around me is what really motivated me in that moment, and it helped me to overcome in that moment. But it's the belief in John Smith as a coach, as a man, and as a mentor that allow for me to really press forward.
00:16:24.048 - 00:16:37.884, Speaker B: And I still talk to him today because there's so much advice from coach Schmidt that I can get. He's the best. You know, he still kind of talks to us like we're college kids. So he'll ask himself that. I'm like, coach? I don't have to answer that anymore.
00:16:39.384 - 00:16:41.792, Speaker A: I'm the champion of the world. Dude has no filter.
00:16:41.848 - 00:16:48.164, Speaker B: He's like, he's like, well, how much money do you have? He's like, straight up. Ask me, he'll start telling me what to do with it. You know? The guy's out of his mind.
00:16:49.024 - 00:16:52.124, Speaker A: Well, you know, you're champion of the world. But he was six times champion of the world.
00:16:53.824 - 00:16:54.632, Speaker B: The best.
00:16:54.768 - 00:17:17.134, Speaker A: He's still tough. We were once down there with a friend of mine who was an all american wrestler. We were just kidding around. We had been drinking a little bit, and we were in the hotel lobby, and I said, come on, christina, see if you can take Smith down. And he was kind of half kidding around. Smith fireman's carried him onto the cement floor. The hotel people came, ran over, and then he had the elbow in his face.
00:17:17.294 - 00:17:19.194, Speaker B: That is something that coach would do.
00:17:20.774 - 00:17:30.758, Speaker A: I would out the guy whose name was Dave Korsani. All right, so next. What's next? You're happy. You got a. You got a beautiful family.
00:17:30.886 - 00:17:31.662, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:17:31.798 - 00:17:32.470, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:32.622 - 00:17:44.364, Speaker B: Two kids. One's arrested, three kids. My wife and I had a kid. Luna is now 18 months. Wow. Selena is about to leave right now to go. We'll bring the kids our lunch at school.
00:17:44.364 - 00:18:01.748, Speaker B: But Luna's now 18 months. I'm 42, might be 43 years old next month. And I've got 18 month. An eleven year old Daniel today. And I have a nine year old daughter named Marquita, who is a phenomenal gymnast. So I'm happy, man. I'm happy.
00:18:01.836 - 00:18:03.908, Speaker A: And I love the fact that you coach your wrestling team.
00:18:03.996 - 00:18:23.634, Speaker B: I do. I love the sport. The sport, Mike, is what gave me everything I have. Because without wrestling, without the lessons that I learned in wrestling, I wouldn't have my education. I wouldn't have this ability to work as hard as I do. There's just so many different things that this sport gives you. And if you can give that back to one kid, two kid.
00:18:23.634 - 00:18:52.154, Speaker B: That's why you guess why you guys do beat the streets, right? Because, you know, look at you today. Wrestling is what allows me to have that mentality, even that fee. Hey, Mike, going into that crypto business, right, it's not easy to try something new when you've had so much success before. But that's a mentality that we have as wrestlers to take on something head on. And now you wanted the biggest voices in the entire market. So it's like, this sport has given me so much. So I just love doing it.
00:18:52.494 - 00:18:56.994, Speaker A: You lead to fight off the front foot, off your heels.
00:18:57.894 - 00:19:13.554, Speaker B: You don't just wait and accept, right? You learn to be a fucking warrior and you go forward and you. You pressure and you break people, and you break down barriers. You break down walls. And it's just a sport, man. It's embedded in us. My son Russell's now, so I'm happy about that.
00:19:13.934 - 00:19:22.262, Speaker A: So let me ask you a couple of quick questions. I know people want to know, who's your favorite fighter out there right now? Who. When you watch, are you just amazed at Francis Ngannou?
00:19:22.438 - 00:19:43.494, Speaker B: Francis Ngannou, the heavyweight champ of the world, because he has this thing about him that it's. It's scary, right? You want the heavyweight champ to be scary. Mike Tyson was scary. That's what made him so special. Francis is scary because he will put your lights out in no time, and he can knock anyone silly. So, yeah, Francis is my favorite. Nice.
00:19:44.994 - 00:19:47.094, Speaker A: In your era, greatest of all time.
00:19:47.434 - 00:19:56.054, Speaker B: Other than you, george St. Pierre. George st. Pierre. He's another one of those guys that one. Two weight classes. I'm pretty.
00:19:56.054 - 00:20:14.326, Speaker B: You guys were in the garden when he beat Michael Bisbank to win his second championship. George St. Pierre, he was the guy that. He was the guy that truly trained, changed the way mixed martial arts was before it was the striker versus the grappler or the grappler versus the kick. George St. Pierre could do everything. So it'll be GSB for me.
00:20:14.390 - 00:20:19.902, Speaker A: It's funny, I saw your. Your teammate, Johnny Hendricks. Was he a teammate of years? He was after you, dude.
00:20:19.958 - 00:20:23.638, Speaker B: He was. He. I co. When I was coaching at Oklahoma State, Johnny was on the team.
00:20:23.766 - 00:20:30.530, Speaker A: I saw him just pound St. Pierre in Las Vegas. I mean, just pounded him. And then they gave the. They gave one.
00:20:30.562 - 00:20:32.554, Speaker B: The fight. They gave the one Johnny won.
00:20:32.634 - 00:20:44.602, Speaker A: Yeah. That was. That was the biggest ripoff I ever saw in UFC. And I have to say, I respected Dana White, because Dana White went on tv 15 minutes later and said, if we ever get refereeing like this again, we're moving out of Las Vegas.
00:20:44.738 - 00:20:45.314, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:45.434 - 00:20:51.254, Speaker A: And I was like, dana White has some intuitive genius around UFC.
00:20:52.644 - 00:21:03.780, Speaker B: He's just. He's a. He's bullish, Mike. He is all things UFC. And that's why this thing goes like. That's why the UFC was first, back when the pandemic started. That's why.
00:21:03.780 - 00:21:09.388, Speaker B: Because Dana has this love for this sport that is unmatched by any other commissioner in any sport.
00:21:09.436 - 00:21:31.768, Speaker A: So it was so interesting. I invited him to New York City once, beat the streets, Times Square, sat him side by side. And when I was talking about UFC, he was like a PhD times three. And then when I was talking about anything else, he could have cared less and didn't know much. Even wrestling, he didn't know much. But around fighting, he hasn't made a bad move. I mean, I really think the dude.
00:21:31.816 - 00:21:45.348, Speaker B: Loves his shit, man. He loves and lives all things UFC. That's why it's growing. It's like. Yet ESPN signed the UFC for a seven year deal. A year in there. Like, hey, we need more years because it literally has built.
00:21:45.348 - 00:22:03.676, Speaker B: ESPN. Plus, every place the UFC goes, it's a monster. I mean, what was the last time he turned on fs one? Be honest. No, when was the last time he turned on? Right. But I'm telling you, when the UFC was there, probably every Saturday, whether you were watching it or not, it was on the tv. Because you knew fights were happening. Yeah.
00:22:03.860 - 00:22:09.004, Speaker A: Unfortunately, I'm starting to have my. All my guys are starting to age out of it a little bit. I kind of start meeting some of the new guys.
00:22:09.124 - 00:22:13.522, Speaker B: Yeah, you got to start meeting them. Well, you got a friend in me that can introduce you to somebody. Anybody.
00:22:13.628 - 00:22:31.254, Speaker A: There we go. There we go. Yeah. So let me ask you one question. I had lunch with oh, God. Ari Emmanuel, Ari Emanuel. And I was asking him, and he was making the claim that since they've taken over, life's getting better for the fighters.
00:22:31.254 - 00:22:52.356, Speaker A: There was always a pitch that in UFC, the fighters don't get as much as they should. The owners take too much of it. Is that is it? And you were, you were a champion. So the champions always did pretty well, especially the charismatic ones. But the. I remember, I remember Hendrix only got paid like $50,000 to fight that championship fight against.
00:22:52.420 - 00:23:12.452, Speaker B: Even now, though, right? Like, some. Even now, there's guys that are unhappy with the fight pick. And honestly, Mike, like, it's going to be that way. But you got a guy like Israel Adesanya who just signed a new contract, and he's one of the highest paid guys in the UFC, not named Habib or Conor McGregor. So for. For. You're going to have some guys that are over the moon happy.
00:23:12.452 - 00:23:36.094, Speaker B: You're going to have some guys that are not happy. Francis Ngannou, he's the heavyweight champion in the world and he doesn't have a contract because he wants more money. He is going to set the market for what you can make. If you aren't conor or Habib or, you know, he will make as much as you can possibly make in the UFC. I never complained about my money because I was making a lot of money, especially as a guy that comes from wrestling, where when I won the open, I would get three grand. Right?
00:23:37.394 - 00:23:38.858, Speaker A: They didn't pay so well in wrestling.
00:23:38.946 - 00:23:59.034, Speaker B: No, they didn't, until you guys came along and they were paying more money. But once we did the fuel of the dream. Remember walking around New York City fueling the dream? It was amazing. But just having an ability to make a lot of money is good, but as would any other sport. I mean, there's guys in baseball, football, making $60 million. They want 100.
00:23:59.164 - 00:23:59.502, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:59.558 - 00:24:09.862, Speaker B: Always going to be a want for more. And at some point, I believe that the UFC is going to pay guys more, but as the sport continues to grow, I think the contracts will, too.
00:24:09.958 - 00:24:18.142, Speaker A: Yeah, it was amazing. When I met Khabib, he put me on his instagram, like, what a shot. And I looked at him. He's got like 40 million followers.
00:24:18.198 - 00:24:28.524, Speaker B: 40 million followers. Habib has. And listen, he had won the night he walked into the octagon to fight Conor McGregor. He left the octagon with eleven. That's how fast he.
00:24:28.984 - 00:24:41.552, Speaker A: I remember we saw you that I was sitting front row. I was telling that story. He jumped right at me, and I was so amped up, I was going to throw a beer on him. I don't know why. Because there was a fight going.
00:24:41.728 - 00:24:45.312, Speaker B: A fight was happening in your wrestler. Okay, let's do this.
00:24:45.488 - 00:24:54.604, Speaker A: And a guy grabbed my arm and said, don't do that. I was like, who are you? And he was Tony Robbins, the giant, his bodyguard. And I was like, why does Tony Robbins need a body car?
00:24:54.724 - 00:24:55.944, Speaker B: He's a giant.
00:24:56.564 - 00:25:02.988, Speaker A: That was fun. That was fun. All right, last question. What's next? You're just starting this career, right?
00:25:03.076 - 00:25:17.184, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. So there's some things on the media side. You know, obviously, I have a ESPN, we're about to do. My contract comes up in the summer. We'll see how much value there is in that. I'm doing this new tv show.
00:25:17.184 - 00:25:29.716, Speaker B: I think Paramount plus is going to be where it lands. It's a massive television series. Obviously, I got my shows. Detail was what Kobe Bryant made up.
00:25:29.780 - 00:25:32.148, Speaker A: I want to see. I want to see you in a movie.
00:25:32.316 - 00:25:33.492, Speaker B: Well, this is.
00:25:33.668 - 00:25:36.900, Speaker A: I want to see you playing either yourself or someone else in a movie.
00:25:36.972 - 00:26:00.506, Speaker B: Well, I'll tell you right now, this show that I'm doing, it's called warriors, and I am going to play Bobby Watkins. He's a 45 year old retired fighter that is going to go back into the ring. So in season one, let's hope that Bobby Watts can find some success. So there's a season two and three and four, because in Hollywood, these people are, like, eager to give away their money. So let's. Let's. Let's hope it works out.
00:26:00.506 - 00:26:08.546, Speaker B: But, yeah, man, just a lot of stuff on the media side. Some interesting conversations that I'm about to have, and then also a conversation with you about crypto.
00:26:08.650 - 00:26:18.490, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, Daniel, listen, I really appreciate you coming on. It's fun talking to you. I'm a huge fan. I'll come cheering you on. We'll get together. We're going to bring it to New Orleans with Dave Barry and a few.
00:26:18.522 - 00:26:33.410, Speaker B: And, yes, the boys get the whole crew back together. Hey, you remember that time we were at the world team trials in Missouri? I won $700. Everybody's gambling this little river bowl casino, and I won. I was happy as I've ever been in my entire life. $700 at the riverboat casino. That's it.
00:26:33.442 - 00:26:37.658, Speaker A: People don't realize when you're on a good role or playing Jack tack, it's just the joy of winning.
00:26:37.746 - 00:26:49.990, Speaker B: There's nothing like it. There's. You want to win in the situation when you're not supposed to. I know I'm not supposed to beat you, but if I get you, man, good night of sleep, I tell you that much.
00:26:50.182 - 00:26:52.510, Speaker A: All right, listen, be well. Thanks a ton, man.
00:26:52.542 - 00:26:55.254, Speaker B: Noble. Thank you, my brother. I'll talk to you later. Enjoy. Jackson.
