00:00:00.760 - 00:00:02.193, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:02.289 - 00:00:03.805, Speaker B: An infinite amount of cash.
00:00:04.385 - 00:00:10.985, Speaker A: I'm your host, Alex Thorne. The U. S. Banking system is sound and resilient. Bitcoin made a new all time high.
00:00:11.145 - 00:00:17.617, Speaker B: If you're not long. If you're not long, you're short. Satoshi's gonna come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet.
00:00:17.721 - 00:00:19.365, Speaker C: All bitcoin's gonna be erased.
00:00:19.665 - 00:00:20.393, Speaker B: Bitcoin.
00:00:20.489 - 00:00:21.885, Speaker A: Bitcoin's the best crypto.
00:00:22.865 - 00:00:24.885, Speaker C: Bitcoin is going to zero.
00:00:25.595 - 00:01:08.651, Speaker A: Welcome back to Galaxy Brains. As always, I'm your host Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy. We have a great episode for you this week. Coy Garrison, partner at Steptoe, former counsel for SEC commissioner Hester Purse, is our guest and we're going to talk with Coy at length about what it would actually mean, tangibly on the ground, if the SEC were to materially change its posture on digital assets. When might that happen in the case? In a bullish case, particularly depending on the outcome of the US presidential election, what it would mean, what the SEC would do immediately to offer relief to various parties, but also what the timeline and structure of sort of a longer term framework might look like. It's a fascinating conversation with Coy. Of course, we'll check with our good friend Bimnet AB from Galaxy Trading to talk about markets and Bitcoin.
00:01:08.651 - 00:01:33.491, Speaker A: I mean 72, 73K this week, so it's been pretty exciting. Before we get to that, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to disclaimer in the podcast notes and note that none of the information this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer recommendation or solicitation by Galaxy or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Let's hop right into it. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:01:33.563 - 00:01:34.659, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:01:34.827 - 00:02:02.925, Speaker A: Wow, exciting time. I don't know if we have the wide shot. People can see the block clock here. We hit 73, 6:35 on Tuesday. My count of the intraday all time high from March 2024 was 73,835. So we were just about a little bit less than $200 off of the all time high for bitcoin this week, a week before the election. I don't know, what's your take on that?
00:02:03.265 - 00:02:32.973, Speaker C: Yeah, I think bitcoin at this point is the $1.4 trillion gorilla in the room. You can't ignore. Right. It is absolutely massive. It is accelerating higher. It's one of those things that like, if you're an institutional investor, you're looking at it being like, okay, what are the arguments for why bitcoin can go higher? There's the whole monetary debasement thing, right, which we can get into.
00:02:32.973 - 00:03:02.239, Speaker C: But you look at trades that benefit from that and you immediately think about gold, which has gone on a spectacular run this year on a risk adjusted basis, one of the best trades you could have done. It's super liquid, it's up, call it 30 to 40% on the year, making fresh all time highs every other day. So that part of the argument is going great. And then you think about it from the regulatory and the adoption side of things. Well, the ETF's incredibly popular.
00:03:02.327 - 00:03:03.271, Speaker A: Incredibly. Right.
00:03:03.343 - 00:03:36.367, Speaker C: The futures product are incredibly popular. The regulatory landscape is probably only going to improve regardless of what candidate is happening. And then you look at kind of the other broader kind of macro risk things, you know, S and P at all time highs essentially same thing with nasdaq, a Fed that's easing, et cetera. And so, you know, it's really, really hard for folks to ignore this. This thing is traded almost in every country in the world. Yeah, right. There are local exchanges, there's a bunch.
00:03:36.391 - 00:03:38.423, Speaker A: Of countries mining it, mining it.
00:03:38.559 - 00:04:21.929, Speaker C: I mean it is unstoppable. It's just a matter of when, not, not if you break through all time highs. And then the question is, what type of FOMO do, do folks get once it breaks? I will tell you, I'm one of those folks that looked at the gold chart, looked at the silver chart and saw it break, have this clean technical break. And you know, if you chose not to follow, particularly on the, on the gold example, you missed out on a ton of gains. Yeah, right. And so, you know, when bitcoin breaks this 74k level, I do think it's going to accelerate and it's going to force people to pay attention. And it's really, I mean, just think about it.
00:04:21.929 - 00:04:32.723, Speaker C: There's the ETFs are insanely. Bitcoin is trading like $40 billion a day. It's super liquid. There's a whole ecosystem around it. Right. You can buy it on futures and.
00:04:32.899 - 00:04:37.159, Speaker A: Do margin finance, buying your fintech apps and your retail exchanges, you can buy it at fidelity.com?
00:04:37.197 - 00:05:16.097, Speaker C: Absolutely. And the other thing I think people are really discounting, which has, I think like gone through a transformational change over the past six months or so, is kind of the financing behind crypto. Right. Since the ETFs have launched, you know, bitcoin has traded more like a general collateral asset, basically an asset you can fund at very low costs. And so folks have been able to get like, real liquidity from their bitcoin without actually selling it. Right. And so when you get liquidity into a market and you're able to finance it, that reduces, you know, sell pressure, and that actually makes people want to own it more because they're like, you buy it on margin.
00:05:16.201 - 00:05:17.097, Speaker A: Yeah, right.
00:05:17.241 - 00:05:41.395, Speaker C: And it becomes almost like a cash equivalent, but you don't actually have to spend the bitcoin to spend cash. And so there's so many positive things happening for it. And you're looking at it being like it just got to, you know, 1.4, $1.5 trillion. And, you know, the naysayers will be like, it's got no, no use case, blah, blah, blah. But all it's done is just defy all the credits constantly.
00:05:41.395 - 00:05:51.827, Speaker C: And now there's just so much momentum behind it that, you know, I think, like, it's really hard for a macro investor or an asset allocator to ignore this. Right.
00:05:51.851 - 00:05:52.291, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:52.403 - 00:06:08.253, Speaker C: Gold's at 19 trillion, but it's got a bunch of central banks, you know, printing money and buying it and also has thousands of years of being money. And yet bitcoin's kind of catching up in a way. Although on route.
00:06:08.389 - 00:06:33.265, Speaker A: Something that I think about with gold too is just another sort of like, you're sort of talking through some of the positives and negatives. Just, you know, it's held in a centralized manner. Gold is not decentralized. Sure. Yeah, I've got a little bit of gold on my finger. There's plenty of, like, gold out there, but the vast majority of it is like underneath the New York Fed or like in a couple depositories, is not capable of being taken delivery of at scale. Right.
00:06:33.265 - 00:06:38.417, Speaker A: So it's not centralized fractions of it as well. And a couple of coins here and there.
00:06:38.481 - 00:06:45.977, Speaker C: And there have been examples of like, governments confiscating gold over time, forcing you to redeem at levels that aren't fair.
00:06:46.081 - 00:06:47.241, Speaker A: Right, right, right, right.
00:06:47.393 - 00:06:51.313, Speaker C: So, yeah, I mean, but like, that's. You don't have to preach to me about the best.
00:06:51.489 - 00:07:26.045, Speaker A: It's one thing that always strikes me though, because, like, the argument for owning gold is, is usually quite similar to what the bitcoiners say about owning bitcoin. Protection against inflation or debasement or from seizure. I mean, yeah, if you have American equal coins in your house, sure. They're probably not gonna be able to seize those very Easily. But the vast majority of people who buy into that trade like gold through a brokerage and don't actually have the gold, to me that's extremely contradictory. And like to own like a government collapse hedge but not actually store it yourself. And the thing is, is you really can't store it yourself in size gold.
00:07:26.045 - 00:07:49.505, Speaker A: It's ph too large and heavy. Super interesting. I want to ask you too about corporate adoption. Right. There's the headlines about Microsoft. Yes. Now I guess an activist, small activist investor did whatever is required to get a question added for shareholders to some upcoming Microsoft board meeting about whether Microsoft should put Bitcoin on the balance sheet.
00:07:49.505 - 00:08:15.541, Speaker A: And Microsoft wrote back recommending that they. Well, they're recommending that shareholders vote against it the board. But also they wrote back saying like, look, we look at everything, including crypto for our balance sheet allocation. But do you regardless of. I don't want to speculate given that that's a single name stock. But like do we see this happening more whether from activists or otherwise? Like, I mean, because like you said, it's really quite difficult to ignore. We're not saying like, hey, you should put on, you know, doggy poggy coin.
00:08:15.541 - 00:08:25.491, Speaker A: Like this is, you know, the state of Wisconsin Investment board bought it. We just saw report that Emory University has bought Bitcoin ETFs. Like this is a. Not a niche asset.
00:08:25.603 - 00:08:25.939, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:08:25.987 - 00:08:31.387, Speaker A: Do you think, you think you're going to see more corporates like have to either be forced to by their shareholders or decide to?
00:08:31.571 - 00:08:52.389, Speaker C: I mean it's, it's a tough one. Like I don't fully, you know, know the nuances behind getting, you know, one of the world's largest companies to hold it on their balance sheet. But I do know that blackrock is a large holder of everything.
00:08:52.517 - 00:08:52.853, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:52.909 - 00:08:56.981, Speaker C: Everything in the U.S. yeah. You know, State Street, Fidelity.
00:08:57.053 - 00:08:57.237, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:57.261 - 00:09:00.837, Speaker A: There are a lot of big shareholders that own Microsoft that like Bitcoin. Yeah.
00:09:00.901 - 00:09:08.173, Speaker C: Besides like Vanguard and Schwab, like most of these companies are like pretty friendly to crypto.
00:09:08.229 - 00:09:15.277, Speaker A: But is the case if you're like managing a corporate balance sheet with a bunch of assets on it, like cash and whatever else.
00:09:15.341 - 00:09:15.661, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:09:15.733 - 00:09:31.837, Speaker A: Like most of them are. Right. Because that's where they, they get the money to buy back their stocks. Right. I mean there's so much cash and all these big companies balance sheets, like is the case. Not the same the case to own Bitcoin as it would be for theoretically an individual or for an endowment. Like it's the risk return profile.
00:09:31.901 - 00:09:34.773, Speaker C: Like it's volatile. I mean Think about like.
00:09:34.829 - 00:09:36.765, Speaker A: But I couldn't. Don't you just do a small.
00:09:36.925 - 00:09:38.869, Speaker C: You can. I mean, I don't see why you shouldn't.
00:09:38.957 - 00:09:45.959, Speaker A: Right? I mean like theoretically the case, the math on like on sharp, how to improve the portfolio, it's the same, right?
00:09:46.087 - 00:10:20.773, Speaker C: No, I mean, put simply, allocating a small percentage of your portfolio into Bitcoin has proven to enhance your returns from outright actual absolute return perspective and also from a reducing volatility perspective. And so every portfolio that has added Bitcoin to a small degree has benefited in an improved Sharp. Yeah, on that portfolio, historically speaking. And that argument with bitcoin at all time highs essentially holds truer than ever.
00:10:20.829 - 00:11:02.667, Speaker A: Yeah. It's funny like when people there's institutional surveys all the time, I know Fidelity has done this survey many times of what is the reason why if you're not doing investing in bitcoin, what's the reason why? And always volatility is the number one answer. And it's funny because I look at that and I think what people really mean is they don't like the downward volatility. Yeah, right. Because like the reality is like, I mean bitcoin has, yeah, it's had many 50% drawdowns and a few like 80 plus percent drawdowns, but it's also just been up forever over a long enough timeframe. So it's kind of like, well, they want the volatility to the upside, they just don't want the downside volatility. But like, you know, it's sort of if you don't like me on my bad days, you don't deserve me on my good days.
00:11:02.667 - 00:11:41.095, Speaker A: Cause this is an asset that like continuously comes back. You've got like the world's biggest economists always talking smack about it and then just always made to look a fool over and over again. You kind of just have to hold through that. I mean think about like even Michael Saylor, right? Like remember when we were talking a couple years ago about like people were worried like oh man, like what's his like liquidation level? Well, I can tell you with certainty it's nowhere near this price. Like he ended up being super right about the price of bitcoin. So it just seems like, you know, how many times are they going to our corporate boards going to say no and how many times are they going to be made a fool of 2, 3 years in the future, like at some point?
00:11:41.595 - 00:12:04.143, Speaker C: Yeah, no, absolutely. I just think it happens over time. You know, the younger generations, you know, as they elevate themselves across you know, various companies and stuff. I can't tell you how many different, like conferences or you know, happy hours, et cetera, where it's like, oh, like, yeah, we're really into bitcoin. The younger, more junior staff versus like the senior PM that's like a little bit more conservative.
00:12:04.239 - 00:12:04.615, Speaker A: Makes sense.
00:12:04.655 - 00:12:11.951, Speaker C: And so I think just as adoption happens and as time passes, you know, you'll see folks get more comfortable.
00:12:12.023 - 00:12:35.849, Speaker A: Yeah, well, we're. I guess we just keep watching. Luckily we. I just feel like a broken record. You know, sometimes it's like, no, it's like, I don't want to apologize for having to constantly tell people that bitcoin, even if you look at the Google trend numbers, like it's not, it's not back like the Google searches, people aren't searching. That comes in after a clean all time high break. You think we start to get some gapage?
00:12:35.937 - 00:12:58.623, Speaker C: No, I mean, I think there's a lot of folks that have been thinking about allocating this year that haven't allocated. And it's all of those people in the middle. And even the folks that are allocated, they're like, I don't own enough. Right. And you just kind of think about all the positive headwinds. It's like, like take the example that Trump wins. Right.
00:12:58.623 - 00:13:02.967, Speaker C: Howard Lutnick. Right. Who is spearheading the transition team.
00:13:02.991 - 00:13:03.175, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:03.215 - 00:13:09.655, Speaker C: The transition team was on podcast the other day saying that he owns hundreds of millions of dollars of bitcoin.
00:13:09.735 - 00:13:10.095, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:10.175 - 00:13:11.799, Speaker C: And that he expects it to be billions.
00:13:11.847 - 00:13:12.239, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:12.327 - 00:13:16.959, Speaker C: Right. That's the guy leading the transition team. The odds on favorite.
00:13:17.007 - 00:13:26.913, Speaker A: I mean, top other people to Vivek is huge. Loves bitcoin. RFK Jr. Loves bitcoin. Don Jr. The former president's son, loves bitcoin.
00:13:26.929 - 00:13:27.561, Speaker C: JD Vance owns.
00:13:27.593 - 00:13:29.285, Speaker A: JD Vance owns bitcoin.
00:13:30.025 - 00:13:43.673, Speaker C: It's really hard for me to be like, the regulatory environment's not going to be good at the very least. And you have things like the options that are going to launch on bitcoin.
00:13:43.689 - 00:13:53.077, Speaker A: At some point for the ETFs. Yeah. Doesn't that dramatically enhance liquidity? Right. It gives people ways to bet in so many different ways.
00:13:53.141 - 00:13:55.317, Speaker C: Gives way folks a way to hedge.
00:13:55.381 - 00:13:55.629, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:55.677 - 00:14:01.653, Speaker C: Earn yield on their stuff. Yeah. I mean it definitely enhances liquidity.
00:14:01.709 - 00:14:24.157, Speaker A: Last episode before the election, which is next week. Good Lord, I'm happy we're going to, you know, no matter what happens, like, I'm just going to be so happy when election season is over. It's so long in this country. You know, there are countries where they cap like campaigning if, like for only like 45 days or something? Like. Yeah, because it's just like, dude. I mean, like, it's way too long.
00:14:24.261 - 00:14:26.877, Speaker C: It is way too long and way too polarized.
00:14:26.941 - 00:14:27.197, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:14:27.221 - 00:14:32.061, Speaker C: I feel like, you know, people just need to sit down and, you know, have a meal with each other.
00:14:32.133 - 00:14:32.557, Speaker A: I agree.
00:14:32.621 - 00:14:48.867, Speaker C: And not be so left or right. But yeah. In terms of the election and how to trade it, the one thing I know for sure is that the market is constantly surprised by election outcomes and even more surprised by price action.
00:14:48.981 - 00:14:49.663, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:49.839 - 00:15:02.431, Speaker C: Subsequently. And you know, the best example that I've heard, and I may have said it on the last podcast, but if you knew the results in 2016. Right. You a day in advance, you probably would have traded it really poorly.
00:15:02.543 - 00:15:08.191, Speaker A: Yeah. It's weird. Right. And so, so what, like the Trump outcome trades didn't actually pan out?
00:15:08.343 - 00:15:17.835, Speaker C: Well, the Trump outcome trades were expected to be stocks down. Right, Right. And stocks ripped. They went from limit down to, you know, falling higher.
00:15:17.915 - 00:15:18.603, Speaker A: Wow.
00:15:18.779 - 00:15:28.963, Speaker C: And so it's, it's, it's really, you know, I think it's one of those things where you're probably meant to be a fast follow rather than a.
00:15:29.099 - 00:15:30.035, Speaker A: On whichever it is.
00:15:30.075 - 00:15:30.443, Speaker C: Yes.
00:15:30.499 - 00:15:32.055, Speaker A: Wait and see where the trend is.
00:15:32.355 - 00:15:33.875, Speaker C: Once you kind of get an inkling.
00:15:33.955 - 00:15:34.331, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:34.403 - 00:15:43.883, Speaker C: Then you kind of go with the trend. But it should be exciting. I'm hoping for a very clear election outcome. That is the main thing.
00:15:43.939 - 00:15:54.921, Speaker A: I agree. I would like it to be clear. Yes. Let's hope we don't have like four or five days of uncertain ambiguity. Ugh, that'd be awful. Well, we're going to know soon. That's it for this.
00:15:54.921 - 00:15:58.777, Speaker A: For this week, though, Bim Nadibi from Galaxy Trading, as always, thanks.
00:15:58.841 - 00:15:59.845, Speaker C: Appreciate it.
00:16:01.065 - 00:16:10.565, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, Coy Garrison, partner at Steptoe, former Council to SEC Commissioner Hester Purse, who herself has been on Galaxy Brains. Coy, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:16:10.865 - 00:16:12.405, Speaker B: Hey, Alex, thanks for having me.
00:16:12.825 - 00:16:44.835, Speaker A: I'm super excited to have you on here because we're a week out from the US Presidential election and our audience and the crypto markets in general are very focused on the outcome of this election because it could determine the future of digital assets in America, perhaps for decades to come from a regulatory standpoint. And Coy, you worked closely with SEC Commissioner Peirce, who many will know has been very forward thinking on regulatory matters as it relates to the crypto industry. You know, what has. What was your experience like working for the commissioner?
00:16:46.575 - 00:17:55.861, Speaker B: So I had a great experience working for the commissioner, I have tremendous amount of respect for her and the intellectual rigor and commitment that she brings to her job. And I think one of the beautiful things about working in her office and with her team is there's a real commitment to fostering a sense of innovation both within the agency itself, but also fostering that entrepreneurial, innovative spirit of America, really. And leaning into that part of the tripartite mission of the agency, right, there's protecting investors, facilitating capital formation and ensuring fair and efficient, orderly markets. And I think sometimes people can focus too much on the concept of investor protection. And part of the SEC's job is to facilitate capital formation as well. So I think working in the crypto space, both for her and previously, when I was in the division of corporation finance, crypto was kind of the opportunity that I had to be exposed to folks that were really on the cutting edge of things and trying to do new things. And the beauty of that is it makes regulators really think deeply about first principles, right.
00:17:55.861 - 00:18:40.521, Speaker B: Of why do we do things the way we do, why do we have the rules that we have? And you have to ask those questions because sometimes the rules don't make sense when a new technology emerges. And I think so. It was exciting from a personal experience and working on it. It was challenging and good and really started off my career. I mean, the last, you know, the last six, eight years of my career, I've really been focused on trying to bring regulatory clarity both, both while at the agency and now in private practice. But certainly I think I was, was and probably am in a minority view of how the commission should be operating in that way. And the last, last four years in particular have been quite, quite difficult in seeing any progress.
00:18:40.521 - 00:18:48.697, Speaker B: But I'm hopeful that regardless of who wins the election, the next administration has an opportunity to really, really turn things around here.
00:18:48.841 - 00:19:15.065, Speaker A: Yeah, we're going to talk a lot about what the approach has been over the last four years under Chair Gensler, and really importantly, what it could look like if there's material change in approach to digital assets under a new chair. For example. Before I get that, I didn't realize that you were at the division of corporate finance. Were you there when Bill Hinman gave his When Harry met Gary, when, how he met gary speech in 2018?
00:19:15.525 - 00:19:39.041, Speaker B: I was, yeah. And I worked for Bill Hinman. He's a fantastic, fantastic guy. And I think he thinks really deeply about these issues and the like. So it, you know, it was really, really interesting. I mean, I started working on the Winklevoss Bitcoin trust filing. I was, I was just the youngest guy in, in an office that reviewed those filings and kind of got assigned to it that way.
00:19:39.041 - 00:20:25.173, Speaker B: And you know, like anything else, it's. You find an area you're interested in and you kind of grow a little bit of expertise and you start getting invited into more and more meetings. So I was able to kind of just become one of the Bitcoin ETF folks that was always in the room on decision making on that. And so that's how I got introduced to Bill. And he was doing deep thinking on decentralization and what it means for ICOs and everything. At the time, ICOs were pretty new. And that was an unexpected, I think, focus under the Clayton term at the SEC of having to wrestle with how do you approach ICOS with the existing securities laws and the like.
00:20:25.349 - 00:20:50.375, Speaker A: Yeah, it was a wild time. I think the speech was delivered by Director Hinman. Is that what we say? Director of Corporate Finance Director Hinman in June 2018. I remember this well, this was a very big deal. The thinking was quite advanced from the director. The sort of. The TLDR perhaps of the speech that I'm recalling was primarily that there are crypto asset securities, but that they can through.
00:20:50.375 - 00:21:10.855, Speaker A: Primarily through decentralization, transition away from being securities and thus needing to follow securities regulations. And he suggested very strongly that Ethereum. His view was that Ethereum had, had perhaps started as an unregistered security, but through decentralization was no longer. Is that like an accurate representation?
00:21:11.315 - 00:21:54.315, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's, that's mostly right. I mean, maybe a little bit of a like loss is that the digital asset itself is never the security, but it's offered in a securities transaction at a certain point in time. Given the promises, the other facts surrounding the token at the time and that over time, as those transactions continue, those promises seem to go away. And the entrepreneurial efforts of others is, you know, not. Not of one central party over time. And that's, that's why how he came to the conclusion that ETH was no longer a security and the like. And I think that that thinking it holds is kind of the genesis and holds true throughout a number of different, you know, policy approaches in this space.
00:21:54.315 - 00:22:14.967, Speaker B: I know like we'll talk about the token safe harbor from Esther and even in fit 21, this, this concept of decentralization and how that interacts with the reasonable expectation of profits from the efforts of others under the Howey test, I think it continues to be form the basis of not Everybody's thinking, but quite a few folks thinking.
00:22:15.111 - 00:22:53.095, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it was very forward thinking. And you're right, absolutely. I would say is sort of. To the extent there is one, it is the standard, I think and by the way, it also sets up, I think very positive incentives for the issuers and projects in general. Right. I mean they're not in a position to dominate the efforts and be that third party. If there is no definable third party, if it's, if the third party is so diffuse that it's effectively any open source developer or a giant sort of diffuse global community of developers and stakeholders, you know, in the case of say like a Bitcoin or an Ethereum today, then it would fail the Howey test.
00:22:53.095 - 00:23:09.601, Speaker A: I think very logically and most, I think who look at this question still agree with that. But it also is really good for the incentives. Right. Because it encourages decentralization. And I think that's. Well, I think it aligns with the goals of the crypto project more broadly. Right.
00:23:09.601 - 00:24:02.793, Speaker A: So I always like that. You mentioned something interesting that he. One of the glosses that you added was that the tokens themselves aren't securities, but the, you know, the schema in which they're offered very well could be. This is actually a recent like sort of development in the crypto litigation case law where the sec, it almost seems like they admitted they were sloppy basically in their literal litigation prose. They had said crypto asset securities a whole bunch of times across all these cases. But then in one of the cases they amended and started saying like crypto assets offered as securities and had a footnote where they basically apologized to the court for being vague or inaccurate because they're now basically adopting what you, what Hinman said in the speech and what you just said to the audience that well, technically the tokens themselves are just tokens. They could be anything.
00:24:02.793 - 00:24:17.343, Speaker A: They don't necessarily be securities. It seems like they took a long time to get to that realization. This was only, I think a month or two ago that it was going around among the crypto lawyers this strange footnote and amendment in one of these cases. I forget which case. I don't want to be too specific.
00:24:17.529 - 00:24:57.305, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I mean this is one of those things that's really frustrating for both lawyers and non lawyers in this space because I mean, I think, I guess my answer is or response a little bit of yes and no. Right. I think the SEC on one hand has really always said that the digital asset is not a security in of itself in terms of you can go back, you know, even to the Dow report. You can find that, you can find that in the representations, too. Courts and actions like Kik and Telegram and stuff. I mean, even, you know, I'm thinking of, I think both cases, certainly the Telegram case, the court is quite clear in the conclusion that the digital asset itself is not the security.
00:24:57.305 - 00:25:36.575, Speaker B: But saying that and then actually is quite different than like inferring that. Right. Or just treating them. You know, you can give lip service to that, which I think essentially is, you know, my critique of the SEC is they've, they've essentially given lip service to that. They've, they've said that as a legal matter, but then brought a number of allegations and charges that really suggest that these tokens kind of continue to be sold as investment contracts in perpetuity so long as certain marketing efforts, for example, are being made by a development team or a central party. Right. They'll glom onto that.
00:25:36.575 - 00:26:03.307, Speaker B: And we've seen that in all their actions against the big exchanges where they've made that allegation. I think that's, to me, the inconsistency and the like. And you're right, the. I can't remember if it was the Binance or the Kraken court. I think it was the Binance court or maybe it was Kraken now. But getting confused, that really kind of held them to task of. You're saying one thing, you're saying that it's digital asset is not a security.
00:26:03.307 - 00:26:30.689, Speaker B: But then you're using this term crypto asset securities. That's very confusing. Right. And the court's obviously right, it is confusing. So they clean it up for or agreed to be more straightforward in that case moving forward. But then on the same day announced a couple of settled actions and new charges against new defendants where they continue to use the term crypto asset securities. So we're just, for as long as Gary Gensler is in charge, we're just going to have to deal with that term.
00:26:30.817 - 00:27:05.417, Speaker A: Yeah. Because it almost seems like there's just not a coherent central plan here. It's sort of like maybe out of, you know, specific enforcement lawyers or under the head of enforcement who, who just left groal. Like maybe they were running with it and but like it's, I think that the confusion even about the term. We're probably might be making a little too much about this. It is just a term, but it, you know, it has big potential legal. I don't want to say ramifications, but, you know, terms matter in the law I mean, the law is literally written word.
00:27:05.417 - 00:27:25.205, Speaker A: And it almost suggests to me like a dysfunction and lack of critical thinking about these deep, these issues. Deeply. Right. Like, it doesn't feel like a, you know, Hinman thinking deeply about decentralization would have arrived at this, like, oops, we totally mislabeled the main thing that we're suing you over.
00:27:26.065 - 00:27:35.803, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it's totally fair. I mean, I guess a couple reactions, you know, just make sure everyone's on the same page. Like, the term crypto asset security is not a legal term.
00:27:35.859 - 00:27:36.347, Speaker A: Right, right.
00:27:36.371 - 00:28:42.605, Speaker B: The, the SEC has jurisdiction over transactions in securities and, and sales of securities themselves, classes of securities, registrations and the like. The term security is defined in the securities laws with like, there's like 30 plus terms, right. Like stock, bond, all that stuff you, what you typically think of. And the really the only one that in general when we're talking about crypto assets, it could fit under is this term investment contract. And so to, you know, to use the term crypto asset security to refer to an investment contract, which by its definition refers to transactions and schemes, is, you know, is what we're driving out here is kind of inconsistent of it's, it's a transaction by transaction analysis when you're dealing with investment contracts. So trying to assign that to a specific asset indefinitely is very problematic. And it is emblematic of the larger problem that you're pointing out, that there doesn't seem to be deep thinking here of what is the goal of all of this, all of these enforcement actions against large crypto trading platforms.
00:28:42.605 - 00:29:11.421, Speaker B: Usually what is the end goal here? Because there's no pathway to registration. It seems like both through enforcement actions and in the rulemakings that we've seen that have touched on crypto, there's a desire to create rules of the road for crypto that cannot be complied with and therefore almost a de facto ban of crypto. And I think that to me, is the most problematic part of the Gensler term with respect to crypto.
00:29:11.533 - 00:29:37.787, Speaker A: Yeah, we're going to talk more about what the future could look like. Let's talk a little bit about your past working for Commissioner Purse and the token safe harbor that she proposed. This is a sort of an entirely different way of thinking about particularly asset registration, disclosure and issuance, maybe just before we get in. And by the way, I encourage people to read this. I think there's two versions of it now. There's an updated version that's quite good. This is among.
00:29:37.787 - 00:29:51.065, Speaker A: This is probably the formative texts of Commissioner Hester Purse's digital asset inquiry and line of thinking encourage our listeners to read those. But maybe you can give us sort of a high level overview of what the Safe harbor is.
00:29:51.405 - 00:30:22.125, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So, you know, Commissioner Purse really had a vision when she hired me to help her write these, this token Safe harbor proposal back in 2019. And I jumped at the opportunity because I think it's a good example of the kind of forward thinking that is needed at the agency. Right. Of we have this problem. You know, she was looking around, seeing ICOS left and right, raising a lot of money and really no clear structure or regulatory apparatus to deal with this. Right.
00:30:22.125 - 00:31:36.989, Speaker B: It's unrealistic to think that some of these, that projects are going to file a S1 registration statement, spend millions of dollars in compliance costs and the like, and do registered offerings with audited financial statements and everything like that. So the thinking was, what if we came up with a exemption from registration that would accomplish a couple goals. One, allow people to experiment with this new technology, experiment with distributing tokens and building a network, but then also protecting the people that are buying the tokens for any reason, if they're buying, to engage in the network, to participate, if they're, you know, even if they're engaging for speculation purposes or investment purposes. And so the idea was why don't, why don't we come up with a common set of disclosures that an issuer that a token project could put out there. Right. And at the outset, both of we are selling this token and we're going to do the following things and then on an ongoing basis, does it make sense to have disclosures and for how long and the like. Right.
00:31:36.989 - 00:32:44.933, Speaker B: And so the tail end of the Safe harbor proposal really tried to come up with a way for folks to kind of exit this exemptive reporting process and essentially borrowing off of the theme of decentralization that we started talking about here. Right. Of is there a point in time that this no longer makes sense for disclosures to be coming from a single project team about this, that we're no longer worried about the securities laws to protect information asymmetries for token purchasers. And so the token Safe harbor idea was really cool. I think a lot of the problems we've seen in the industry could have been sidestepped really, if the agency had been more forward thinking and decided to take up this proposal or wrestle with it or deal with something similar. You know, for what it's worth, I think, you know, the token Safe harbor is fantastic and I think it continues to be a good model to think about, but it also is somewhat limited and it only deals with the initial issuance of tokens. Right.
00:32:44.933 - 00:33:06.541, Speaker B: And I think. I think we've moved on now with many more years of experience to see there's other areas where the securities laws and crypto intersect, where there's a huge lack of clarity and that the SEC could, Could really be more aggressive in thinking about solutions to the problem as opposed to just ways of trying to stuff out the technology.
00:33:06.733 - 00:33:44.505, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's really interesting. I think the proposal, and you're definitely right about it, not covering things like, for example, exchange, really, of the assets themselves. But it does show to me a very thoughtful realization and recognition that most of these crypto networks and the assets that may be involved with them or power them, if they're a decentralized network or wannabe, don't look like a common equity. Right. And literal little things like an S1 registration form didn't have the correct questions, like, for these types of networks. Right. Like, I mean, even at its base.
00:33:44.505 - 00:34:03.771, Speaker A: What I've heard and thought myself when looking at this is that it's not clear how a. Like an Ethereum would have filled out an S1. Like, it's not sure. Right. It has to. Something had to be sort of thought recognized that there was something a little, at least a little different. And this was one of those approaches that recognized that.
00:34:03.771 - 00:34:06.215, Speaker A: Right. That these aren't common equity securities.
00:34:07.115 - 00:34:44.333, Speaker B: Of course. Yeah. And it's par for the course for the SEC to consider exemptions and different approaches for either different types of securities or assets being issued, I guess I should say securities being issued and scaled disclosures and the like. Right. I mean, you have regulation A, you have regulation crowdfunding, you have exempt offerings under Reg. D, for example, that there's no disclosure requirements and the like for accredited investors. And so it's not unusual for the SEC to tailor its regulations for different contexts.
00:34:44.333 - 00:34:55.965, Speaker B: But thus far, you know, apps, you take away Hester Purse. And the SEC really hasn't shown any willingness to tailor its regulations in a way that makes sense.
00:34:56.125 - 00:35:08.005, Speaker A: Yeah, there hasn't been. Mark Ujda and his team have been very good too, but they. But Hester's work has been sort of the intellectual foundation of alternative ideas on this topic.
00:35:08.045 - 00:35:08.197, Speaker B: Right.
00:35:08.221 - 00:35:38.125, Speaker A: There hasn't. I don't know why that Gensler or the commission as a whole can't, you know, convene all the people together and come up with a bunch of it. I mean, instead it's been happening in Congress So let's talk about some of those proposals which do go further than the safe harbor. I think fit 21 is sort of the most, it's certainly the most robust that has passed a chamber. And of course, it passed the House back in May with a pretty sizable bipartisan contingent. Right. I think 70 Democrats voted for it.
00:35:38.125 - 00:36:20.487, Speaker A: 70 or 71 Democrats in the, in the House hasn't been introduced or taken up in the Senate yet. But I think there's definitely, there will be interest, by the way, I think regardless of really Senate outcome or presidential election outcome, I think you'll see, you'll see a version of it introduced probably over the next year. So anyway, that it does have some disclosure requirements. It has some, I think one of my favorite things in fit 21 that it tries to do, whether or not these are the right thresholds, it establishes some, some actual thresholds for what is decentralized and what is not, which, you know, is a tough game. I mean, I think crypto researchers will tell you that actually quantifying decentralization is plenty subjective. Like, there's, it's not, it's not like a binary. Right.
00:36:20.487 - 00:36:54.415, Speaker A: Like some people will say it's a spectrum. To me, I don't really think of it as a spectrum, but it's more like the. Was it the Supreme Court's famous pornography standard? Like, I know it when I see it. It's sort of, I think it is binary, but it's not clear to me, I think, or anyone else like, where the binary line is drawn. But it does try to do that on, on issuance, and it has some disclosure stuff, but it also has a lot on market structure. So let me envision a world for you and get you to sort of paint a picture for us. If we had a world in which, say, broker dealers or national securities exchanges could handle.
00:36:54.415 - 00:37:26.501, Speaker A: I'm just going to say digital assets, but let's say that, you know, a lot of them are securities and some aren't. But let's say that, you know, which is kind of probably what would happen under fit 21. It may be some starters them. And then later or not would be maybe a safe harbor. Or for 21, how does that world change? Because I've seen allegations in some of these litigations that SEC enforcement has brought that they have said, go get a broker dealer. And then the entities that, you know, the, the defendants in these civil cases have gotten a broker dealer and they're not been able to use it. Like, talk me through a little bit.
00:37:26.501 - 00:37:31.905, Speaker A: What like the upside scenario is for changes in market structure, if a different approach or whatever.
00:37:33.405 - 00:38:15.105, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, first of all, I thank you for correcting me. I was remiss about mentioning Commissioner Ueda. He has been quite forward thinking on these issues. So I think that's been a welcome change recently at the agency as well. He's been very vocal dissenting and actions against NFTs and quite vocal about why the Form S1 registration statement makes no sense in this space with respect to market structure. One of the good things about fit21 is it really takes it on and says, hey, sec go amend reg ATS reg ATS is for alternative trading systems.
00:38:15.105 - 00:38:58.993, Speaker B: It's an exemption for exchanges. So if you meet the definition of exchange, you either need to register as an exchange or you need to register as an ATS under an exemption. The problem under the current rules is there's, there's really no way for an ats, which you have to register as a broker dealer with, with the SEC and FINRA to, to engage with digital assets that are not securities under the securities law. Right. So it's kind of this weird position where you have registered entities that would like to engage with digital assets and you have entities that would like to register that are engaging with digital assets. But the SEC's rulebook does not allow that to happen. Right.
00:38:58.993 - 00:39:42.713, Speaker B: And so one of the nice things about Fit21 is because when you're dealing with market structure, I mean this stuff is incredibly complex, right? There's even within, like I'm a securities lawyer, within the world of securities law, there is a subset of people that deal with like equity market structure issues. Right. And it's, it's just, it's a complicated thing. So I think one of the smart things about that legislation was it provided some broad guide posts to the agency, but it says agency write the rules to allow this to happen. Right. And so that legislation would then kick it to the experts at the SEC to flex their expertise and their knowledge to allow for what are the specific details that need to change to be able to allow this to happen. Right.
00:39:42.713 - 00:40:32.467, Speaker B: And I think it's going to require kind of a wholesale new approach to how people think about, you know, again, we talked about at the top. But I think the folks at the SEC need to think through is there a different way to achieve the same regulatory outcome? Right. If we care about protecting customers assets, customers funds, customers, crypto assets, that's what we care about. How can we do that by tweaking our rules? Like the existing rule can't be the only way to get to the desired outcome. And once you set that as the table for SEC staff, they are more than capable and smart enough to propose rules, to get public input on it, to adapt to it and adopt a final rule to allow that to happen. And you just, you haven't seen SEC staff be empowered in that way to date.
00:40:32.651 - 00:41:13.981, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you think if they were empowered and I think here's a question our audience is keen to know. I mean, I know there's no answer, but there's some opinions. Yours is a highly educated one. Let's say for whatever reason, whether it's either a presidential candidate takes power, let's say there is a concerted decree by the, I guess it would be the White House to, or, or, or the chair, whoever, the current chair could change their mind, whatever to, to, to do a material pivot and adopt like some of this approach, either engage in comprehensive rulemaking on market structure and issuance. Let's say in, you know, I'll just be put brass tacks to it. Right.
00:41:13.981 - 00:41:42.915, Speaker A: Former President Donald Trump said in Nashville he would fire Gary Gensler. I think our view and most lawyers views is that he probably doesn't have the authority to fire an independent commissioner, but he could probably appoint an acting chair and immediately sort of change control over the sec. If that were to happen, how fast could a pivot even occur? In sort of the most bullish scenario, whomever that is, if Vice President Harris wins and she makes the same determination, what structural impediments are there? How fast could it actually happen?
00:41:43.545 - 00:42:20.087, Speaker B: Yeah. So folks will be disappointed there. Nothing happens quickly at an administrative agency. Right. And even with the change in administration, you know, even if Gary Gensler follows, you know, precedent and steps down and allows for a new person to be appointed and you know, a new leadership comes on board and let's just assume that process is all taken care of by April of next year and it's as quick as possible. You know, changing the SEC's approach to this is going to take the entire four years of the next administration and the like. Right.
00:42:20.087 - 00:43:04.867, Speaker B: I mean like rulemaking takes years. It doesn't take weeks. It takes, you know, years. Not, it's not something that's done overnight. And I think it's, it's something that people maybe in this industry are, well, they're obviously an understandably frustrated by because we're used to things happening super quickly and look how much things have changed since when we were talking about the token safe harbor back in 2019 to today. So you can see There's a little bit of a mismatch with the technology that evolves and changes every single day, and a regulatory agency that takes years to change its approach and its rule book and the like. But I don't think that can't be an excuse for sitting around and doing nothing.
00:43:04.867 - 00:44:03.691, Speaker B: Right? I mean, I think in my mind, whoever wins the election, the next administration really needs to focus on restoring the SEC to a position of trust and respect. And I think with crypto you do that a couple different ways. I think you got to stop the bleeding. First of all, on Chair Gensler's offensive approach to crypto, right? So that that includes, at a minimum, pausing, likely withdrawing the enforcement actions against the any number of intermediaries, ending the seemingly endless investigations into intermediaries in the space. But it also means taking a look at rules that went through, like the change the definition of dealer, the proposed change to the definition of exchange, the proposed change to safeguarding in custody. You know, really things like that. SAB 121 is a low hanging fruit.
00:44:03.691 - 00:45:28.433, Speaker B: Stuff like that needs to be attacked. But then the second step is, okay, if we are changing direction here and fixing the SEC's approach, how do we want to do this and how do we get meaningful, long lasting change? Because you can take one tack which would be let's move as quickly as possible and let's just direct the staff to issue no action relief to folks so that, you know, so that folks can have crypto trading platforms, so that tokens can be issued, so that wallet providers can rest assured that they're not a broker dealer, so that front ends for defi platforms can rest assure that they're not an exchange. You know, you could just issue some no action positions and the like and those no action positions would only be good for as long as that administration is in power. Right. And so I think what makes way more sense, and especially when you're dealing with such substantive issues that deal with serious interpretations of the securities laws, is you really do want to notice and comment process under the Administrative Procedure Act. And those issues I've just kind of rattled off there off the top of my head, you know, those are just a few of the issues I'm sure folks listening to this probably are saying, oh, he should have mentioned X, Y or Z. Right? So I think there really will need to be a concerted effort at the outset of what are the, you know, let's pick five issues in the crypto space.
00:45:28.433 - 00:45:46.329, Speaker B: Because by the way, the SEC deals with a lot of stuff that's non crypto related that the next chair is going to care about. And how do we prioritize changing that through rulemakings? How do we prioritize that? And that's, that's something they're, they're really going to have to think about. And there's, there's no one right path on that.
00:45:46.497 - 00:46:14.655, Speaker A: Yeah. So some delays in getting personnel squared away in the upside scenario, but you think that some relief from current approach can come relatively quickly. But that doesn't actually do the long term durable fix, which is actually the proactive rulemaking. Do you think they work with Congress? Do you think the SEC needs new authorities? I mean Chair Gensler's. It's kind of interesting. Chair Gensler has argued they don't need any new authorities. Really.
00:46:14.655 - 00:46:33.735, Speaker A: I mean in the past I think he actually said they did need new authorities, but now he says they don't. That you can just force fit all of the crypto issuers, tokens and intermediaries into existing rules. Can you, with better guidance and rulemaking or do you think there is a need for new statutory authorization?
00:46:34.315 - 00:47:08.481, Speaker B: So I guess two thoughts on that. 1. Without a doubt, no matter what, there needs to be coordination between the agency and Congress. You mentioned, you know, your, you thought that market structure will likely be picked up next Congress no matter what. And I agree with that. You know, you can't if you're the sec, why would you waste your time issuing a new rule about secondary trading of cryptos crypto assets if Congress is passing a market structure bill that's going to tell you to implement new different regulations or divide your responsibility up with the cftc. Right.
00:47:08.481 - 00:48:22.385, Speaker B: So I think without a doubt you need coordination on that with respect to new authorities. Short answer is yes. I mean I think if the SEC wants, if you buy into Chair Gensler's vision, which I certainly don't, that the SEC is the regulator of crypto and should be overseeing all of this activity, then I do think you need clear statutory authority to do that. It raises an interesting issue for the industry. If you get, you know, let's, as a hypothetical, let's say if Trump wins the election, appoints a very friendly crypto to the crypto industry chair of the agency and they're willing to, you know, move forward with helpful guidance that allows people to have regulatory certainty, you know, then the industry is faced with a question, right. Do we try to support getting quick regulatory certainty that's based on questionable statutory authority or do we opt for the longer game and really try to push for Congress to give clear, express direction in this space. And I think that's something that's going to have to play out and we're just going to have to see how people deal with that.
00:48:22.385 - 00:48:24.645, Speaker B: And it's going to depend on the issue too, right?
00:48:24.985 - 00:48:42.113, Speaker A: Yeah. I think even rulemaking from a federal agency can be rolled back. It's. It's not as easy, unfortunately, by the way, for when bad rules are made. It's actually you gotta unwind them. It's not literally that easy, but certainly it's easier to roll back than statutes. Right.
00:48:42.113 - 00:49:14.231, Speaker A: And so I totally agree that the legislation is a long longer game versus the immediate relief. It does feel like there would be some immediate relief, though, on some of these issues. And then, then you've got to really engage. These are complicated issues. What would happen? Let me put this to you, Coy. I was thinking about whether it's fit 21 or token safe harbor. Let's say you start as a crypto asset security, and it's somehow possible either it's through the safe harbor or market structure, either through guidance or legislation changes.
00:49:14.231 - 00:49:40.315, Speaker A: And so now a normal broker dealer can offer it to tons of people, any equity security, basically. But over time you become. So now you're traded, let's just say it like fidelity.com which is a broker dealer, a big one, right. It's actually Fidelity Brokerage Services. But, you know, I know because I worked there. But like you're traded like a security, right? And you have disclosures and stuff you got to do because you are a security under the new rules or under the safe harbor, whatever.
00:49:40.315 - 00:50:06.055, Speaker A: But then over time you transition to a commodity, like broker dealers can. They can't trade commodities, can they? Like, how does that. Like, what happens then? Like, if everybody's trading it happily on the New York Stock Exchange, which trades equity securities, like, does it have to move to like the Nymex because it's now a commodity? Like, do you think we'll get that level of clarity like in. Or do we. And do we need to. And again, in this situation where this is all sort of sorted out.
00:50:06.355 - 00:50:58.551, Speaker B: Yeah. No, I mean. Well, I think you do need that level of clarity because, look, the technology is not going away, right? And folks want to be able to trade what I'll just refer to as traditional securities, and they want to be able to trade crypto assets regardless of what those crypto assets are categorized under the law. So I think over time it's inevitable that these two sides will come together. And it really demonstrates the importance of why you need to unleash the ability of the SEC to be more innovative in its approach. Right. You need to allow for testing of how do we allow broker dealers to engage with digital assets that are not securities? What safeguards do you put on that? Right.
00:50:58.551 - 00:51:40.713, Speaker B: Do you limit the amount of non security digital assets that can be used? Does it have to be in a wholly separate subsidiary that has limits on its activities? What should those limits be? You know, room for experimentation and regulation here makes a lot of sense. Regulatory humility and recognizing that maybe the first calibration is not going to be exactly right. So you know, maybe it's a time limited exercise and you learn lessons from it and adapting that. You know, these are the types of changes that quite frankly like this is not how the SEC operates, but it's how the SEC could operate. Right. And I think you need, you need leadership that is going to push for experimentation and changes like that.
00:51:40.889 - 00:52:14.375, Speaker A: Yeah, we've seen some of that out of the UK with the fca, certainly in the Emirates and in the Middle East. Europe took a little bit of a different approach which was like let's just pass a whole new giant pile of rules specific for crypto which I think can also work. But it does seem if we don't want to overhaul the entire securities law architecture, we need some clarifying legislation and rules. You're optimistic that America, regardless of how like the political outcomes and whatever you think America is going to solve this core or do you think we're going to fumble the bag here?
00:52:14.995 - 00:53:09.585, Speaker B: No, I'm, I'm forever an optimist and I have tremendous faith in this, this country and entrepreneurial sphere that really serves as the backbone of it. So I think we will get there. And you know, even within such a divided political atmosphere that we have, you know, you mentioned 71 House Dems voted for fit 21, the SAB 121 Congressional Review act repeal. I think, oh boy, I'm going to mess with the number 13 Senate Dems, something like that. There is bipartisan support for providing regulatory guidance here in different realms. So I think unfortunately, you know, the, the leadership of Chair Gensler on this issue has been unfortunate to say the least. But I think with different personnel under new administration, there's strong opportunities, there's plenty of room for opportunities to try to get it right.
00:53:10.405 - 00:53:34.533, Speaker A: Well, thank you so much for painting that picture for us of what it could look like.
