00:00:00.240 - 00:00:33.084, Speaker A: One of the issues that we saw was that there was a bit of a complacency with certain bitcoiners where. Yeah. Like, basically to do, you know, you either hodl your bitcoin and that's obviously fully self sovereign, or if you do want to do something, I guess you just have to do that custodially. Right. And there was kind of like almost like a acceptance or like complacency, kind of like, okay, that's just the way it is. That's bitcoin. And I think that, you know, last year has taught us a lot of very valuable lessons around.
00:00:33.084 - 00:00:59.314, Speaker A: You know, when you don't kind of know what's actually going on underneath, like, where your returns and yields are coming from, well, then you should be a little bit skeptical. Right. And basically, like, bitcoin's designed to be programmable money, but all of the things that collapsed last year didn't use the programmable feature. Right. Like, it was a trad five setup for and for. But for, you know, bitcoin, which is meant to be this kind of new age of money.
